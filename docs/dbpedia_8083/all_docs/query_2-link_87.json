        "text": "North by Northwest is one of five Alfred Hitchcock on the BBC’s Top 100 American Films, notching in at number thirteen. I’m not sure I agree with that high of a ranking, and those conflicted feelings are making it difficult to write this essay. That’s not to say that I didn’t enjoy the movie, because I really did, but taking a step back and attempting to pinpoint the enduring excellence underlying the film has been surprisingly difficult. Many of the accolades for NxNW focus on this scene:\n\nThe styling and effects in that scene shocked audiences, as it marked a pivotal shift in the quality of special effects that had been achieved up until that point. The tension, as well as the use of perspective and realism were, and in a large way are still, mind blowing. That scene in particular harkens back to Hitchcock’s most revered film, Vertigo, demonstrating the director’s authority over the camera and the audience’s capacity to surrender to the illusions crafted by unexpected vantage points. Both movies twist the viewer’s orientation by inducing a dizzying feeling of swirling directions, both geographically and mentally.\n\nAnother piece of the film that I thought worked beautifully was the switch between Roger Thornhill’s (played masterfully by Cary Grant) sidekicks. In the first act, Hitchcock again leans on his instinct to explore relationships between mothers and sons (essay on Psycho is coming soon!). The whole plot of the movie is kicked off by Thornhill realizing he needed to send his mother a telegram, and the mistaken identity scheme is set in motion. His mother returns to the film when Thornhill calls her from jail after his drunk driving arrest. At first she is as incredulous about his claims as the officers, but she remains by his side while he tries to make sense of what happened to him. She’s a great comedic foil, and her presence helps endear the audience to Thornhill when she plays his reluctant Watson.\n\nWhen the tension is escalated, and Thornhill is on the run, mother is replaced by Eve Kendall. This transition is addressed almost explicitly by Kendall and Thornhill when she begins to undress him:\n\nRoger Thornhill: When I was a little boy, I wouldn’t even let my mother undress me.\n\nEve Kendall: Well, you’re a big boy now\n\nKendall has the aura of a femme fatale, displaying an overt sexuality that is surprising even by our modern standards. For much of the second act, the audience is never sure which team she is playing for as she is consistently bounced between roles as a dangerous vixen and a red herring. Their connection feels genuine, and when they follow their instincts to protect each other, the romance between them becomes inevitable.\n\nPart of what disguises the genius underlying NxNW is that it established a blueprint adhered to by a whole array of spy movies, so much so that now the look and style debuted by this film feel tired at worst and generic at best. NxNw is often compared to James Bond movies and it’s no surprise that Ian Flemming contacted Hitchcock when he was considering directors for the first James Bond movie. Roger Thornhill, the fast talking, womanizing, ad man from New York City, is an American version of Bond — in so far as 007 is an extraordinarily talented man who also possesses pedigree and status, Thornhill is an endearing but ordinary man who gets swept into greatness and adventure.\n\nThornhill’s caddish charm was adopted not only by Bond, but also by Don Draper of Mad Men. The similarities between Draper and Thornhill extend beyond their careers, penchant for flirtation, number of wives, and chiseled, rugged, good looks. They also both experience a multiplicity of their identities, Don’s is a chosen and crafted character, whereas Thornhill’s is thrust upon him, but both experience a split existence.\n\nIn addition to Mad Men, there were many times throughout NxNw where I thought of the Coen brothers and how some of the dark humor used in the first half of the film is reflected in their films about murder and mystery. Hitchcock makes light of Thornhill’s situation when he’s first apprehended by the Vandamm crew, and the sequence making up the first attempt to murder him is also a comedic highlight of the film:\n\nThat tongue in cheek look at violence is adopted by the Coen brothers in many of their movies, but the closest cousin to North by Northwest is a top five contender for my personal favorite movie, The Big Lebowski. These films both focus on men who have more in common than you might think (both are laid back, enjoy day drinking, and likely to assert that this aggression will not stand) and put them into life threatening scenarios spurred by a mistaken identity. They are both grabbed by the scruffs of their necks and dropped into gumshoe shoes where they are forced to sift through the knotted entanglements of the people they are mistaken for. The Coen brothers also make use of their own unusual camera angles to provoke a similar shock of perspective and styling that assaults the senses:\n\nThe greatness hidden within NxNW is that it helped create the standards for thrillers that we take for granted now. It also provided an example to future directors on how to craft a thriller that was humorous and romantic, or a comedy that borrows the plot of a thriller. That willingness to be playful with serious subjects continues to trickle into some of the best, most rewatchable, films today."
