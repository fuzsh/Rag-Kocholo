        "text": "In his directorial debut, Jordan Peele steers away from his comedic reputation to make the suspenseful thriller that is Get Out. The film is very intriguing and keeps you guessing and on the edge of your seat throughout from start to finish as you follow Chris Washington, a young african american man, who travels with his white girlfriend to her family’s house when he uncovers a dark secret. For the typical fan of horror/thriller, it's a must see.\n\nFilm- Precious Knowledge Precious Knowledge is a documentary that takes place in Tucson, Arizona and focuses on how the Unified School district wants to completely ban the Mexican American Studies Program. In the film there were many scenes with examples of rhetorical appeal. I believe that the way the film was set up since the beginning had an impactful and direct emotional appeal on the audience. For instance, in the first scenes of the film we have the opportunity to get to know the main characters in a more intimate level.\n\nDope is a film written and directed by Rick Famuyiwa, which depicts the struggles and achievements of Malcom Adekanbi. Malcom, a teenager who is growing up in the Darby-Dixson neighborhood commonly known as “the bottoms” in Inglewood, California, understands who he isn’t, but struggles throughout the movie to figure out who he is. This film brilliantly explains a few reasons for delinquent behavior, including societal need to label and/or define people, which is often decided based on race, gender, socioeconomic status and social standing, as well as how to overcome obstacles that have been placed in front of us, thereby changing the trajectory of our lives. The following quote from the movie given by Malcom explains how labels have made it hard for him to figure out who he is: “For most of my life I’ve been caught in between who I really am and how I’m perceived. In between categories and definitions…. But when you don’t fit in you’re forced to see the world from many different angles and points of view” (Famuyiwa, 2015). Malcom wonders if he’s a geek, a poor black child who doesn’t know his father and is being raised by a single mom, a menace, a drug dealer or is actually Harvard material.\n\nI was still in elementary school when hurricane Katrina hit Louisiana so I do not remember much except for the fact that my mother woke up my sister and I at four o’clock in the morning to head to my uncle’s house in northern Texas. My mother got scared and decided to leave at the last minute. I remember on our drive there, the thunder and lightning was horrible and it was raining really bad. Besides remembering these few details on my own, I have only heard stories and was taught about Katrina in school. Watching Trouble the Water was very eye opening in the aspects of how some of the people in the ninth ward of New Orleans experienced hurricane Katrina. Although this documentary focused solely on the impact of the ninth ward, there were still\n\nWorking out conflicts face to face can and cannot make a difference in resolving the problem.“These face-to-face interactions build trust, understanding, and a real sense of a shared mission, and this has made all the difference in the world.” This direct quote from Forbes.com explains how this specific way can improve how the world communicates to each other. Many people will disagree with the previous statement, but it is just one of the basic elements of the social system. Admittedly, not everyone believes in face to face interaction. People can choose whichever side they want to, but people can solve their problems by talking to somebody.\n\nThe Alfred Hitchcock film, North by Northwest, provides many high anxiety, suspenseful, and dramatic scenes. The hotel elevator scene, 30 minutes into the film, provides a comedic moment in Roger Thornhill’s desperate attempt to save himself. This scene comes after he and his mother visited the room rented to George Kaplan. While in the room they received a phone call from the men who are after “Kaplan,” upon discovering the call came from the lobby Thornhill and his mother head to the elevators in order to escape before they arrive at the room.\n\nOnce the flirtations between the two in intensify, Hitchcock transitions into using close shots, beginning when Eve discloses her bribe arranging Thornhill being seated with her, and her subsequent reveal that she knows Thornhill wanted for murder. The use of the close shot provides a better, more intimate view of their expressions as they banter back and forth and the sexual innuendos ramp up. Thornhill’s thoughts are particularly evident across his face as he changes from showing interest in the attractive woman across from him, to tension at being recognized by her, to unabashed glee at the prospect of sleeping with same said beautiful woman, and finally to alarm as he learns police are boarding the train.\n\nIn his 2017 horror film Get Out, Jordan Peele not only makes his director debut, but delivers a particularly insightful view into the state of racial affairs in modern America.The stories narrative follows an African American man named Chris, who goes to visit his white girlfriend's parents at their rural home only to uncover a horrifying plot in which the girlfriend and her parents are in fact racist and have been abducting black people and using their bodies in medical experiments involving the transfer of consciousness. On a surface level, the plot of the film has the ability to come across as quite simplistic in scope, an obvious labeling of privileged American whites as racist; however, a deeper analysis reveals careful consideration to\n\nGet Out is a film by Jordan Peele, which was release on February 24, 2017. Get Out is a social thriller, which follows an interracial couple, Rose and Chris. Chris and Rose take a weekend to visit her family, the Armitage family, home in a isolated area surrounded by a forest. The plot spirals out of control following many disturbing discoveries by Chris and in turn, Chris must get out of the Armitage household.\n\nThroughout this class, various discussions and blogs have been used to analyze the different elements of films such as theme, cinematic techniques and genre. It is time to bring all of these separate elements together in the analysis of one specific film, according to class text, “analyzing levels of meaning below the surface story can greatly enhance enjoyment as well as understanding of a film” (Goodykoontz & Jacobs, 2014. p. 10.03). There are several different approaches to film analysis including formalist, auteurist, and generic or any combination thereof. Utilizing a genre theory lens, the 1956 film The Searchers will be analyzed addressing contextual information, story/plot, aesthetic choices, social/personal impact and how these areas come together to develop the film.\n\nI remember watching this film for the first time back in 2001 when it was released and having not watched it in over a decade, I feel I can say that this film is still solid. The Others holds up so well due to the film relying on storytelling, atmosphere and sense of impending doom to create its tension. The Others is one of the rare big budget, well cast horror films that seem to pop up every couple of years and I love it when they do. I feel horror often gets the short end of the stick when it comes to Hollywood.\n\nJean-Marc Vallee’s 2014 film Wild is based off of Cheryl Stryaed’s memoir “Wild: From Lost to Found on the Pacific Crest Trail”. The film changes the genre by having a woman as the main character in a man vs. nature situation a rare chage from the typical hero. Vallee had a budget of $15,000,00 for the film and it brought in $4,112,752 on opening weekend, January 30, 2015. Wild, was nominated for many prestigious awards and won few. (imbd). In a initial review of the film published in The New York Times, noted film critic A. O. Scott wrote, “The film adaptation of her book — itself already a classic of wilderness writing and modern feminism — provides another reason to be grateful that she did”. Proving that the change in the genre did not\n\nPart 1 - In American author's 2009 book, The Help, the primary thesis is the relationship between Black maids and white households in Jackson, Mississippi during the early 1960s. The story is really told from three perspectives, Aibileen and Minny are Black women, both maids, and Skeeter is the nickname of Eugenia Phelan, daughter of a prominent White family. Skeeter has just finished school and hopes to become a writer. In general, the relationship between the Black maids and the White employers is six sided: On one side we have the White employers who have three views: 1) Their personal and private beliefs that can range from extreme scorn and bias to kindness regarding race; 2) Their public persona that must have the \"proper\" attitude about Blacks and \"the help,\" and 3) Their employer attitude, which is condescending and parental. The Black view also has three segments: 1) Their personal and private beliefs that usually range from understanding not all Whites are the same and an extreme love and empathy for the White children for whom they care; 2) The public persona that is deferential, polite, and stoic to their White bosses; and 3) Their attitude and view among the Black community, which usually separates the \"poor and ignorant but rich\" White souls from the Black view of family and common sense. All in all, the relationship is contentious, phony, and based on economic advantage."
