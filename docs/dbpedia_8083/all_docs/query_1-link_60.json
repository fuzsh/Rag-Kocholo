        "text": "The Associated Press Stylebook at UAMS\n\nThe University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS) has adopted the Associated Press (AP) guidelines for grammar, punctuation and writing style. The Associated Press Stylebook provides a uniform presentation of the printed word to make copy written anywhere understandable everywhere. The AP’s standard reference for spelling is The Merriam Webster Dictionary.\n\nUse the first spelling listed in The Merriam Webster Dictionary unless a specific exception is listed in the AP Stylebook or in the UAMS-specific style decisions listed on this page.\n\nIf The Merriam Webster Dictionary provides different spellings in separate entries (tee shirt and T-shirt, for example), use the spelling that is followed by a full definition (T-shirt).\n\nIf The Merriam Webster Dictionary provides definitions under two spellings for the same sense of a word, either use is acceptable.\n\nThe Merriam Webster Dictionary is also the first reference for geographic names not covered in the AP Stylebook or in the UAMS-specific style decisions listed on this page.\n\nThe following selections are the most frequently used guidelines at UAMS. A few have undergone minor revisions, in order to focus on and/or address issues that pertain to the UAMS community.\n\nAP Stylebook Guidelines at UAMS\n\na, an\n\nUse the article a before consonant sounds: a historic event, a one-year term (sounds as if it begins with a w), a united stand (sounds like you).\n\nUse the article an before vowel sounds: an energy crisis, an honorable man (the h is silent), an homage (the h is silent), an NBA record (sounds like it begins with the letter e), an 1890s celebration.\n\nabbreviations and acronyms\n\nA few universally recognized abbreviations are required in some circumstances. Some others are acceptable, depending on the context. But in general, avoid alphabet soup. Do not use abbreviations or acronyms that the reader would not quickly recognize.\n\nUAMS Style is to put the abbreviation after the full name on first reference. For example, National Institutes of Health (NIH) or Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n\nAvoid abbreviations and most acronyms in headlines, except those that are widely recognizable (FBI, EU, US, CIA, IRS, NASA, NATO, COVID, NIH, CDC for example.)\n\nAn acronym is a word formed from the first letter or letters of a series of words: laser (light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation). An abbreviation is not an acronym.\n\nabbreviations before a name\n\nAbbreviate titles when used before a full name: Gov., Lt. Gov., Rep., the Rev., Sen. and certain military designations.\n\nabbreviations after a name\n\nAbbreviate junior or senior after an individual’s name. Abbreviate company, corporation, incorporated and limited when used after the name of a corporate entity.\n\nabbreviations with dates or numerals\n\nUse the abbreviations A.D., B.C., a.m., p.m., No., and abbreviate certain months (Jan., Feb., Aug., Sept., Oct., Nov., Dec.) when used with the day of the month.\n\nRight: In 450 B.C.; at 9:30 a.m.; in room No. 6; on Sept. 16.\n\nWrong: Early this a.m. he asked for the No. of your room. The abbreviations are correct only with figures.\n\nRight: Early this morning he asked for the number of your room.\n\nacademic degrees\n\nUse an apostrophe in bachelor’s degree, master’s degree, etc., but not in Bachelor of Arts or Master of Science. Also, there is no apostrophe in associate degree.\n\nWhen mentioning an academic degree to establish someone’s credentials, do not use an academic abbreviation; instead, use a phrase such as: He has a doctorate in psychology. (NOT: He has a Ph.D. in psychology.) She received her medical degree from UAMS. (NOT: She received her M.D. from UAMS.)\n\nUse an academic abbreviation only after a full name – never after just a last name – and only on first reference. When used after a name, an academic abbreviation contains periods and is set off by commas: Stephanie Gardner, Pharm.D., Ed.D., spoke at the conference.\n\nDo not precede a name with a courtesy title for an academic degree and follow it with the abbreviation for the degree in the same reference:\n\nWrong: Dr. Ronda Henry-Tillman, M.D., is a surgeon.\n\nRight: Ronda Henry-Tillman, M.D., is a surgeon.\n\nSee Degrees and Credentials for how to punctuate degrees and credentials under UAMS Style.\n\nacademic departments\n\nUse lowercase except for words that are proper nouns or adjectives: the history department, the English department, or when department is part of the official and formal name: the Department of Laboratory Sciences or Department of Orthopaedic Surgery.\n\nacademic titles\n\nCapitalize and spell out formal titles such as chancellor, chair, etc., when they precede a name, such as Chancellor Cam Patterson, M.D., MBA. Lowercase elsewhere.\n\nLowercase modifiers such as department in department Chair Ronald Robertson, M.D.\n\naddresses\n\nUse the abbreviations Ave., Blvd. and St. only with numbered addresses: 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. Spell them out and capitalize when part of formal street names without numbers: Pennsylvania Avenue. Lowercase and spell them out when used with more than one street name: Massachusetts and Pennsylvania avenues.\n\nAll similar words – circle, drive, lane, road, terrace, etc. – are always spelled out.\n\nAlways use figures for address numbers: 501 Jack Stephens Drive.\n\nSpell out and capitalize First through Ninth when used with street names: 7 Fifth Ave. Use figures with two letters for 10th and above: 100 21st St.\n\nAbbreviate compass points used to indicate directional ends of streets in numbered addresses: 4301 W. Markham St. Do not abbreviate if the number is omitted: West Markham Street.\n\nUse periods in the abbreviation P.O. for P.O. Box numbers.\n\nUse these forms, as appropriate, for highways identified by number: U.S. Route 1, U.S. 1, Route 1, U.S. Highway 34, Interstate Highway 495, Interstate 495. On second reference only for Interstate, use I-495. When a letter is appended to a number, capitalize it, but do not use a hyphen: Route 1A.\n\nAlso see separate entry for states.\n\nAfrican American\n\nAcceptable for an American Black person of African descent. Also acceptable is Black, which is capitalized under AP Style. The terms are not necessarily interchangeable. People from Caribbean nations, for example, generally refer to themselves as Caribbean-American. Follow a person’s preference.\n\nafter-\n\nDo not put a hyphen after this prefix when it is used to form a noun: aftereffect, afterthought.\n\nDo put a hyphen after this prefix when it is used to form a compound adjective: after-dinner drink, after-theater snack.\n\nafterward\n\nDo not use afterwards.\n\nages\n\nAlways use figures for people and animals, but not for inanimate objects: The girl is 12 years old. The woman, 35, has a daughter, 10. The boy’s sister is 9 months old. The law is eight years old.\n\nUse hyphens for ages expressed as adjectives before nouns and as substitutes for nouns: The 5-year-old boy played in the yard. The race is for 3-year-olds.\n\nFor years expressed in decades, do not use an apostrophe: The man is in his 50s.\n\nAIDS\n\nThis is acceptable in all references for acquired immune deficiency syndrome.\n\nAlzheimer’s disease\n\nLowercase disease.\n\nAmerican Hospital Association (AHA)\n\nAHA is acceptable on second reference.\n\nAmerican Medical Association (AMA)\n\nAMA is acceptable on second reference.\n\namong, between\n\nIn general, use between to introduce two items and among to introduce three or more items.\n\nampersand (&)\n\nUse the ampersand when it is part of a company’s formal name: Procter & Gamble. Otherwise, the ampersand should not be used in place of and.\n\nannual\n\nAn event cannot be described as annual until it has been held in at least two successive years. Do not use the term first annual; instead, note that the sponsors plan to hold an event annually.\n\nante-\n\nIn general, do not use a hyphen after this prefix: antebellum, antedate.\n\nanti-\n\nHyphenate all words containing this prefix except the following, which have specific meanings of their own:\n\nantibiotic: antiparticle (and similar terms in physics, such as antiproton)\n\nantibody: antipasto\n\nanticlimax: antiperspirant\n\nantidepressant: antiphon\n\nantidote: antiphony\n\nantifreeze: antiseptic\n\nantigen: antiserum\n\nantihistamine: antithesis\n\nantiknock: antitoxin\n\nantimatter: antitrust\n\nantimony: antitussive\n\nThis approach has been adopted in the interests of readability and easily remembered consistency.\n\nassociation\n\nDo not abbreviate this word.

Lowercase when the word is used alone.\n\ncities and towns\n\nCapitalize them in all uses.\n\nWhen used in copy, some U.S. cities are not followed by their states. Determining factors are each city’s population, the frequency of the city’s appearance in the news, the uniqueness of its name and experience that has shown the name to be almost synonymous with its state.\n\nThe following U.S. cities stand alone in copy:\n\nAtlanta\n\nBaltimore\n\nBoston\n\nChicago\n\nCincinnati\n\nCleveland\n\nDallas\n\nDenver\n\nDetroit\n\nHonolulu\n\nHouston\n\nIndianapolis\n\nLas Vegas\n\nLos Angeles\n\nMiami\n\nMilwaukee\n\nMinneapolis\n\nNew Orleans\n\nNew York City\n\nOklahoma City\n\nPhiladelphia\n\nPhoenix\n\nPittsburgh\n\nSalt Lake City\n\nSan Antonio\n\nSan Diego\n\nSan Francisco\n\nSeattle\n\nSt. Louis\n\nWashington, D.C.\n\nThere are also foreign cities that are not followed by their countries, with the determining factors being the same as those for U.S. cities.\n\nco-\n\nHyphenate all nouns, adjectives and verbs that indicate occupation or status: co-author, co-chairman, co-sponsor, co-worker.

Spell out all months when using alone or with a year alone. When a phrase lists only a month and a year, do not separate the year with commas. When a phrase refers to a month, day and year, set off the year with commas.\n\nExamples: February 1981 was a cold month. May 22 is the day she will arrive. Sept. 16 was the coolest day of the month. Her birthday is Nov. 27, 1962.\n\nUse an s without an apostrophe to indicate a span of a decade or century: the 1890s, the 1900s.

Some of those elements are given below.\n\napostrophe ( ’ )\n\nListed below are some of the many guidelines related to the apostrophe.\n\nPLURAL AND SINGULAR NOUNS NOT ENDING IN S: Add ’s: the alumni’s contributions, women’s rights, the church’s needs, the girl’s toys.\n\nPLURAL NOUNS ENDING IN S: Add only an apostrophe: the horses’ food, the states’ rights, the ships’ wake.\n\nSINGULAR COMMON NOUNS ENDING IN S: Add ’s unless the next word begins with s (in which case, add only an apostrophe): the hostess’s invitation, the hostess’ seat, the witness’s answer, the witness’ story.\n\nSINGULAR PROPER NAMES ENDING IN S: Add only an apostrophe: Arkansas’ natural resources, UAMS’ centers of excellence, Achilles’ heel, James’ book, Tennessee Williams’ plays.\n\nFIGURES: For omitted figures, add an apostrophe: The class of ’65 will have a reunion this summer. The Charleston was a popular dance in the ’20s.\n\nHowever, without omitted figures, add only a lowercase s (no apostrophe): The custom began in the 1940s. The airline has two 727s. Temperatures will be in the low 60s.\n\nLETTERS: For omitted letters, use an apostrophe: It isn’t time for class to begin. Rock ’n’ roll is his favorite type of music. Her favorite Christmas expression is ’tis the season to be jolly. He is a ne’er-do-well.\n\nTo make single letters plural, use ’s: Mind your p’s and q’s. He learned the three R’s and brought home a report card with four A’s and two B’s.\n\nHowever, to make multiple letters plural, add only a lowercase s (no apostrophe): She knows her ABCs. I gave him two IOUs. Four VIPs were at the event.\n\nWORDS AS WORDS: Add only a lowercase s (no apostrophe) to make plural: His speech had too many “ifs,” “ands” and “buts” in it.\n\ncolon ( : )\n\nThe most frequent use of a colon is at the end of a sentence to introduce a list, tabulation, text, etc.: There were three considerations: expense, time and feasibility.\n\nCapitalize the first word after a colon only if it is a proper noun or the start of a complete sentence: He promised this: Jones would be punished for his crime. He promised this: The company will make good all the losses.\n\nPLACEMENT WITH QUOTATION MARKS: Colons go outside quotation marks unless they are part of the quotations themselves.\n\ncomma ( , )\n\nListed below are a few of the many guidelines related to the comma.\n\nIN A SERIES: Use commas to separate elements in a series, but do not put a comma before the conjunction (words such as and and or) in a simple series: The flag is red, white and blue. (NOT: The flag is red, white, and blue.) He would nominate Tom, Dick or Harry. (NOT: He would nominate Tom, Dick, or Harry.)\n\nHowever, put a comma before the concluding conjunction in a series if an integral element of the series requires a conjunction: I had orange juice, toast, and ham and eggs for breakfast.\n\nUse a comma also before the concluding conjunction in a complex series of phrases: The main points to consider are whether the athletes are skillful enough to compete, whether they have the stamina to endure the training, and whether they have the proper mental attitude.\n\nWITH INTRODUCTORY CLAUSES AND PHRASES: Use a comma to separate an introductory clause or phrase from the main clause: When he had tired of New York City, he moved to Boston. On the street below, the curious gathered.\n\nWITH CONJUNCTIONS: When a conjunction – such as and, but or for – links two clauses that could stand alone as separate sentences, use a comma before the conjunction in most cases: She was glad she had looked, for a man was approaching the house. We are visiting St. Paul and Minneapolis, and we also plan to take a side trip to Duluth, Minn. We visited Washington, D.C., and our senator greeted us personally.\n\nHowever, do not use a comma when the subject of the two clauses is the same and is not repeated in the second clause: We are visiting Washington and plan to see the White House.\n\nIN LARGE FIGURES: Use a comma for most figures greater than 999. The major exceptions are street addresses, room numbers, serial numbers, telephone numbers and years.\n\nPLACEMENT WITH QUOTATION MARKS: Commas always go inside quotation marks.\n\ndash ( – )\n\nGuidelines for two of the most frequent uses of the dash are given below.\n\nSERIES WITHIN A PHRASE: When a phrase that otherwise would be set off by commas contains a series of words that must be separated by commas, use dashes to set off the full phrase: He listed the qualities – intelligence, humor, conservatism and independence – that he liked in an executive.\n\nABRUPT CHANGE: Use dashes to denote an abrupt change in thought in a sentence or an emphatic pause: Smith offered a plan – it was unprecedented – to raise revenues. We will fly to Paris in June – if I get a raise.\n\nPLACEMENT WITH QUOTATION MARKS: Dashes go within the quotation marks when they apply to the quoted material only. They go outside the quotation marks when they apply to the whole sentence.\n\nPut a space on each side of a dash.\n\nellipsis ( … )\n\nAn ellipsis consists of one space, followed by three periods, followed by one space.\n\nOMISSION OF WORDS: Use an ellipsis to indicate the deletion of one or more words in condensing quotes, texts and documents. Be especially careful to avoid deletions that would distort the meaning. Example: He felt strongly that it was necessary to see the constitutional process through to its conclusion, that to do otherwise would be … a dangerously destabilizing precedent for the future.\n\nHESITATION: An ellipsis may also be used to indicate a pause or hesitation in speech or a thought that the writer or speaker does not complete.\n\nSPECIAL EFFECTS: Ellipses also may be used to separate individual items within a paragraph to show business gossip or similar material.\n\nexclamation point ( ! )\n\nPLACEMENT WITH QUOTATION MARKS: Exclamation points go within the quotation marks when they apply to the quoted material only: “How wonderful!” he exclaimed. They go outside the quotation marks when they apply to the whole sentence: I love watching “Gone With the Wind”!\n\nhyphen ( – )\n\nHyphens are joiners. Use them to avoid ambiguity or to form a single idea from two or more words. They should not be used in instances where dashes are required.\n\nparentheses ( )\n\nBe sparing with parentheses. They are jarring to the reader. The temptation to use parentheses is a clue that a sentence is becoming contorted; try to write it another way. If a sentence must include incidental material, then commas or two dashes are frequently more effective. Use these alternatives whenever possible.\n\nperiod ( . )\n\nUse a single space after a period at the end of a sentence.\n\nPLACEMENT WITH QUOTATION MARKS: Commas always go inside quotation marks.\n\nquestion mark ( ? )\n\nPLACEMENT WITH QUOTATION MARKS: Question marks go within the quotation marks when they apply to the quoted material only: He asked, “How long will it take?” They go outside the quotation marks when they apply to the whole sentence: Who wrote “Gone With the Wind”?\n\nquotation marks ( “ ” )\n\nPeriods and commas at the end of quotations always go within the quotation marks.\n\nDashes, semicolons, question marks and exclamation points go within the quotation marks when they apply to the quoted material only. They go outside the quotation marks when they apply to the whole sentence.\n\nColons go outside quotation marks unless they are part of the quotations themselves.\n\nAVOID UNNECESSARY FRAGMENTS: Do not use quotation marks to report a few ordinary words that a speaker or writer has used:\n\nWrong: The senator said he would “go home to Michigan” if he lost the election.\n\nRight: The senator said he would go home to Michigan if he lost the election.\n\nPARTIAL QUOTES: When a partial quote is used, do not put quotation marks around words that the speaker could not have used. For instance, the individual says, “I am horrified at your slovenly manners.”\n\nWrong: She said she “was horrified at their slovenly manners.”\n\nRight: She said she was horrified at their “slovenly manners.”\n\nsemicolon ( ; )\n\nIn general, use the semicolon to indicate a greater separation of thought and information than a comma can convey, but less than the separation that a period implies.\n\nTO CLARIFY A SERIES: Use semicolons to separate elements of a series when the items in the series are long or when individual segments contain material that also must be set off by commas: He leaves a son, John Smith, of Chicago; three daughters, Jane Smith, of Wichita, Kan., Mary Smith, of Denver, and Susan Smith Kingsbury, of Boston; and a sister, Martha Warren, of Omaha, Neb. (Note that the semicolon is used before the final and in such a series.)\n\nTO LINK INDEPENDENT CLAUSES: Use a semicolon when a coordinating conjunction – such as and, but or for – is not present: The package was due last week; it arrived today.\n\nPLACEMENT WITH QUOTATION MARKS: Semicolons go within the quotation marks when they apply to the quoted material only. They go outside the quotation marks when they apply to the whole sentence."
