        "text": "In order to analyse this film and why it is so exciting, one must understand some editing concepts, so please indulge me, and I promise this review will become more exciting the more you read.\n\nLouis Giannetti, author of Understanding Movies, defines classical cutting as a style which “involves editing for dramatic intensity and emotional emphasis rather than for purely physical reasons” (Giannetti 141). Alfred Hitchcock, in North By Northwest, totally embraces this concept by editing in a style which conveys the frantic mind and reality of a man who, by no fault of his own, continues to stumble into situations born from a mistaken identity, which snowball into consequences of massive proportions. From the outset of the film, Hitchcock informs the audience through his editing style that we are viewing the film almost entirely in respect to what the protagonist, Thornhill (Cary Grant), knows and sees through “a series of psychologically connected shots— shots that aren’t necessarily separated by real time and space” (Giannetti 141).\n\nThis concept, and the tenant of classical cutting that the breaking up of shots can be “justified on the basis of dramatic rather than literal necessity,” is best exemplified in the scene in which Thornhill is taken to Vandamm’s office, at approximately the nine minute mark in the film (Giannetti 141). This scene in particular displays a hallmark of Hitchcock’s films, in which he “teases the audience by not providing enough time to assimilate all the meanings of a shot” by briefly cutting to shots which appear to contain important information because they are framed as being from the point of view of the protagonist, though are not given context until much later in the film (Giannetti 151).\n\nWhen Thornhill enters the office, both he and the audience are confused, something which is shown by the collection of fragmentary shots as opposed to one fluid shot or series of shots, a concept pioneered by D.W. Griffith (Giannetti 141). Interspersed between medium shots of Thornhill walking around the room, taking in his surroundings, are a close-up shot of Thornhill holding a cardboard tube so that the words on its white label are visible to the audience; a medium shot of a window, through which two men briefly speak then walk out of frame; and finally in the sequence, a prolonged medium shot of Vandamm (James Mason) as he enters the office, allowing the audience to take in his presence.\n\nContinuity editing is further used to align the spectator with Thornhill in regards to what he is able to see and is therefore aware of during the sequence in which Thornhill is being driven to Vandamm’s home by his kidnappers. Hitchcock utilizes the central tenant of continuity cutting, which is that one “tries to preserve the fluidity of an event without literally showing it all” as it applies specifically to Thornhill, by only showing the audience the pertinent details of the car ride as they matter to Thornhill, rather than condense the actual length of the car ride into a more realistic sequence of shots which show various points of the ride (Giannetti 136). Instead, Hitchcock provides the audience with all of the information they need to know about Thornhill so that they can become familiar with his personality and the situation which he faces. Although the audience is provided with an extremely small segment of the car ride, showing only two shots, one in which Thornhill has a brief interaction with his kidnappers then tries to unsuccessfully escape, and a second in which the car drives up to the Townsend home, in this sequence, “[t]he continuity of actual space and time is fragmented as smoothly as possible” (Giannetti 138).\n\nThe moments in which Hitchcock shifts away from Thornhill’s point of view are to show the audience something which is happening of which he is not aware, or, specifically, when he is unaware that someone is watching him. The first moment this happens is when, at the beginning of the film, Thornhill sits down at a table of friends and calls for a young man to send a telegram; soon after, the camera abruptly jump cuts to a long shot of the room he is in, with the camera still focused on Thornhill. Afterwards, the camera pans over and stops when the frame is centered around the two men who will eventually kidnap Thornhill. The second instance this happens is when Thornhill returns to the Townsend house with the police and his mother; after the sequence in the house is finished, the camera focuses in a long shot on the car parked in front of the door. Thornhill, his mother, and the police enter the frame and begin to enter the car, which is interspersed with cuts of the alleged hostess waving goodbye. As the car drives off, the camera cuts to a medium shot of a man’s back as he trims a bush; to the audience’s surprise, and unbeknownst to Thornhill, the man who turns around to face the camera is one of the men who kidnapped him earlier in the film.\n\nThe scene in which Townsend (Philip Ober) is stabbed, at approximately the 40 minute mark, best exemplifies the classical cutting techniques used by Hitchcock and his editor, George Tomasini, to condense time. Akin to the scene in which Thornhill first enters the office of the Townsend house, Hitchcock once again uses fragmentary shots. Conversely, the effect of these “brief shots, jammed together” is changed from when they were used earlier in the office sequence as Hitchcock changes the pacing before the scene in question, and therefore alters the intensity of its context (Giannetti 147). The sequence wherein Thornhill investigates the office is prefaced with Thornhill being kidnapped, which is characterised by shots that are physically cramped as they are filled with multiple people and fast moving in that they are brief and pushed more rapidly by the fast-moving, quick-witted dialogue provided by Grant. Therefore, by comparison, the sequence of shots in which Thornhill investigates the office, which are longer in length and the frame is occupied only by him, unless he is looking out of the window, causes the scene to feel more investigative and as if time is longer, allowing the audience to momentarily catch their breath from the previous sequence, even though they are still unable to assess what is happening narratively.\n\nParadoxically, before the sequence in which Townsend is stabbed, Hitchcock utilises long, languid medium shots of Thornhill interacting with receptionists; in these two exchanges, nothing of consequence happens narratively and both sequences utilise consistent medium shots as opposed to changing the shot length, and so, the pacing has relaxed. With this as its context, when Thornhill and Townsend converse, although the tension rises narratively through the use of dialogue, the camera continues to use medium shots, thereby visually continuing the theme of the prior, inconsequential shots. Suddenly, time is condensed when, after Townsend is stabbed, the shot is changed to one that is close-up to see Thornhill’s expression as he realises why Townsend has fallen, which quickly cuts to a long shot wherein the people in the room react to Thornhill holding the knife, then to a medium shot as Thornhill runs out of the room, and finally, the scene closes with an aerial extreme long-shot of Thornhill running down the pathway from the building and into a cab. Similar to the scene in which Thornhill is in Townsend’s office, the scene in which Townsend is stabbed utilises fragmentary shots to provide context to the scenes in question and convey to the audience reality as it pertains to Thornhill; though unlike the former, the stabbing scene uses this technique to condense time as opposed to make it feel longer.\n\nHitchcock and Tomasini additionally use classical cutting techniques to create suspense, a concept which is best exemplified in the drunken car chase sequence between Thornhill and the two men who kidnapped him. To create a heightened sense of danger and uncertainty about the situation’s outcome, Hitchcock again borrows from Griffith, utilising his “conventions of the chase” (Giannetti 147). The techniques Hitchcock features in this sequence include parallel editing, which is “the switching of shots of one scene with another at a different location;” increasing the sense of speed by using multiple cuts; and changing “his setups many times” (Giannetti 147). In this scene, Hitchcock engages in all of these techniques by using close-up shots of Thornhill and the two men who kidnapped him in their respective cars, medium shots of other people driving on the road, a long shot of a police car parked on the side of the road as Thornhill whizzes by, and a medium shot of a man riding his bicycle as he is almost struck by Thornhill. In this sequence, Hitchcock creates tension by never making the camera stagnant and employing the use of multiple techniques and styles of shots.\n\nCary Grant’s star persona, including his training and skill as a comedic actor, contributes to his characterisation of the New York publicist Roger O. Thornhill in that he provides to the character a unique personality which Hitchcock did not tamper with narratively. Rather than have Thornhill be a person who reacts negatively to his situation, Hitchcock allowed Grant to interpret how the character would engage with his surroundings based on his own personal talents. This concept is best exemplified by the scene in which Thornhill has been kidnapped and is sitting in a car between his two captors at approximately the seven minute mark in the film. When he tries to escape, the door is locked; normally, considering the narrative context and the real-world implications of something like this occurring, especially knowing that one of the captors has a gun, this moment would elicit a fearful and lamenting reaction from the actor playing this character. Instead, the audience is introduced to the type of persistent optimism and unrelenting snark of Thornhill, no matter what situation he faces, because of Grant’s unique performance in this role, best represented by Grant’s delivery of the line “Locked?” in response to his grim reality.\n\nThis moment highlights the contribution Grant makes to the intrigue and suspense that were a signature of Hitchcock’s films: Grant plays an unwitting man who has been thrust into a situation about which he is uninformed, handling it as best he can. Grant’s unrelenting positivity throughout his character’s journey makes him the perfect vessel for the events which occur in this film to happen to him, exemplifying Hitchcock’s idea that “‘casting is characterization’. . . [o]nce a role has been cast, especially with a personality star, the essence of the fictional character is already established” (Giannetti 281). Instead of allowing Grant’s star persona as a comedic actor to hinder his thriller, Hitchcock utilised this fact to make the character of Thornhill more akin to a real person, embracing the concept that “[i]n a sense, the stars are more ‘real’ than other characters” (Giannetti 281).\n\nThe reason why Grant’s acting style fits so perfectly within this suspenseful film is because the audience can place themselves in the position of someone who just so happens to have a sequence of terrible things happen to them, no matter the grandiose implications or consequences, because this is something which happens to everyone in their every day lives as they journey from one day to the next, even if their lives may not be as exciting as that of Thornhill. In North By Northwest, this acting style, which film scholar Leo Braudy contrasts with Marlon Brando’s, someone who he asserts “tries to get into his roles, and often sinks them in the process,” Cary Grant brings to life the characterisation that he “pumps [the roles] up like a balloon and watches them float off into the sky” (Braudy 434). Despite the circumstances in which the narrative place him, Grant is an actor who can make almost anything comedic; as Braudy points out that “[i]t may be funny if. . . Cary Grant vomited out a porthole, but it’s not funny when [Marlon] Brando does it” (Braudy 435). Instead of stifling this attribute for the sake of his film, Hitchcock rather allowed Cary to play with the titular role as he played with his camera techniques.\n\nI argue it is because Grant's comedic training was integrated so seamlessly in this film through using his humour to make him into a more relatable, sympathetic, and charismatic unwilling hero when faced with the challenges of this film, Hitchcock was not someone who underplayed the role of actors so that he could discredit them. I believe he took the unique personalities each of his lead male actors displayed and crafted his films around them, as is evident with this film.\n\nHitchcock's intent with this film, something I believe is especially supported by his choosing Grant as his protagonist and allowing him to exercise his comedic talents throughout the film, was to subvert not only the thriller genre, but also the idea of what a leading man could be in mid-20th century cinema. What I found so profound in NORTH BY NORTHWEST is that Hitchcock highlights the humour in Grant's delivery of his lines and his physical gestures by allowing the camera to have multiple close-ups on his face or putting him in the center of the frame to capture his reactions to other characters or his speaking and using medium, and sometimes long, shots to emphasise the way Grant's lanky, awkward body moves in such a way that it dominates the frame vertically and horizontally."
