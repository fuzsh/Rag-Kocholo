        "text": "In the movie “North by Northwest,” by Alfred Hitchcock he shows how a film can have an influence on a historical event. Alfred Hitchcock was born August 13, 1899 and died April 29, 1980 being sometimes referred as “The Master of Suspense.” During Hitchcock’s career some major historical events took place, in which he used his films to reflect and sometimes respond to those events. Hitchcock’s films both reflected and sometimes also intervened in contemporary social and political events during his career.\n\nAlfred Hitchcock’s film “North by Northwest,” is today considered one of the greatest films of all time. In 1995 the film was picked by the United States Library of Congress to be saved in the National Film Registry for being important …show more content…\n\nThe types of narration he uses in the film “North by Northwest” are considered two of the basic forms of narration. The two forms of narration that he uses in the film are restricted and omniscient. This is important because the omniscient type of narration is where the person watching the movie knows what is going on in the story. Unlike the restricted form of narration where it is more like real life as in having a more narrow view of events. The fact that he used the omniscient type of narration is important because having the complete knowledge of what is happening in a story actually creates suspense by not knowing when and how events would take place. In the film Hitchcock does not use the two different types of narration separately but actually combines them together. This shows that he did not make the film based on just a certain tone but actually changed tones throughout the film. For example, when Eve is about to send a letter to Vandamm the tone of the film suddenly changes to suspense. This is very important because it changes the view of Eve and other events in the movie to some characters. This shows that the tone changes successfully to suspense by making Thornhill and some other characters question many things that are happening in the film. Hitchcock’s way of using this keeps the viewer intrigued even as the story starts to unfold as the movie"
