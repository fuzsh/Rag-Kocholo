        "text": "Welcome to the cinema soapbox. Today were ranting and raving about the (mostly) industry-wide dismissal of the horror genre and the auteurs who pushed against it, namely the “Master of Suspense,” Sir Alfred Hitchcock. One of the fathers of modern cinema—a real Mamma Mia!-esque squad of figurative dads—Hitchcock earned 46 Academy Award nominations throughout his career. His work would go on to inspire such filmmakers as David Lynch, Brian DePalma, David Fincher, and M. Night Shyamalan.\n\nHollywood is notorious for separating horror films from “legacy cinema,” a pretentious and misguided view that persists today. In recent years, A24 has done the work and collected flowers for the genre, bringing to the screen films that are both artistically notable and genuinely terrifying. Hitchcock would be proud.\n\nAlfred Hitchcock worked in film years before he would become a household name. His tenth film, Blackmail (1929), was the first British “talkie” following the silent film era. From there, he worked like he was running out of time (quip credit, Hamilton). He made 53 movies over 50 years, ending his career with Family Plot (1976). The prestigious filmmaker died in 1980 of kidney failure, but is remembered today for his “Hitchcockian” film style, marked by voyeuristic cinematography and a focus on the human psyche.\n\nOf the 53 films attached to Hitchcocks name, all 53 are legendary. That said, we’re playing favorites here. These are the 15 best Alfred Hitchcock films, ranked."
