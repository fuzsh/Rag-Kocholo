        "text": "Selection of films for preservation in the US Library of Congress\n\nThe National Film Registry (NFR) is the United States National Film Preservation Board's (NFPB) collection of films selected for preservation, each selected for its historical, cultural and aesthetic contributions since the NFPB's inception in 1988.[1][2]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nThroughout the 1980s, several prominent filmmakers and industry personalities in the United States, such as Frank Capra and Martin Scorsese, advocated for Congress to enact a film preservation bill in order to avoid commercial modifications (such as pan and scan and editing for TV) of classic films, which they saw as negative. In response to the controversy over the colorization of originally black and white films in the decade specifically, Representatives Robert J. Mrazek and Sidney R. Yates introduced the National Film Preservation Act of 1988, which established the National Film Registry, its purpose, and the criteria for selecting films for preservation.[3] The Act was passed and the NFR's mission was subsequently reauthorized by further acts of Congress in 1992, 1996, 2005, 2008, and 2016.[4][5][6][7] The National Film Preservation Board's mission, to which the NFR contributes, is to ensure the survival, conservation, and increased public availability of America's film heritage.[8] The 1996 law also created the non-profit National Film Preservation Foundation which, although affiliated with the NFPB, raises money from the private sector.[9]\n\nSelection criteria\n\n[edit]\n\nThe NFPB adds to the NFR up to 25 \"culturally, historically or aesthetically significant films\" each year, showcasing the range and diversity of American film heritage to increase awareness for its preservation.[10] A film becomes eligible for inclusion ten years after its original release.[11] For the first selection in 1989, the public nominated almost 1,000 films for consideration. Members of the NFPB then developed individual ballots of possible films for inclusion. The ballots were tabulated into a list of 25 films that was then modified by Librarian of Congress James H. Billington and his staff at the Library for the final selection.[10] Since 1997, members of the public have been able to nominate up to 50 films a year for the NFPB and Librarian to consider.[12]\n\nThe NFR includes films ranging from Hollywood classics to orphan films.[13] A film is not required to be feature-length, nor is it required to have been theatrically released in the traditional sense. The Registry contains newsreels, silent films, student films, experimental films, short films, music videos, films out of copyright protection or in the public domain, film serials, home movies, documentaries, animation and independent films. As of the 2023 listing, there are 875 films in the Registry.\n\nFilms\n\n[edit]\n\nFilm title Film type Year of release Year of induction Reference 2001: A Space Odyssey± Narrative feature 1968 1991 [14] 3:10 to Yuma Narrative feature 1957 2012 [15] 4 Little Girls Documentary 1997 2017 [16] The 7th Voyage of Sinbad Narrative feature 1958 2008 [17] 12 Angry Men Narrative feature 1957 2007 [18] 12 Years a Slave Narrative feature 2013 2023 [19] 13 Lakes Documentary/experimental film 2004 2014 [20] 20 Feet from Stardom Documentary 2013 2023 [19] 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea Narrative feature 1916 2016 [21] 42nd Street Narrative feature 1933 1998 [22] Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein Narrative feature 1948 2001 [23] Ace in the Hole Narrative feature 1951 2017 [16] Adam's Rib Narrative feature 1949 1992 [24] The Adventures of Robin Hood± Narrative feature 1938 1995 [25] The African Queen Narrative feature 1951 1994 [26] Airplane!
