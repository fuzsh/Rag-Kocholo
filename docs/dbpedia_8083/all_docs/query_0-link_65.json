        "text": "Featuring the master of madness & mystery, experience Alfred Hitchcock’s 1959 spy thriller mystery “North By Northwest” once again on the silver screen at The Cliftex Theatre\n\nBy E. BRETT VOSS\n\nBosque Film Society Founding Board President\n\nThey aren’t really trying to kill a rather “boring” New York City advertising executive played by Cary Grant, are they? And if they are, who exactly are “they” anyway? Find out by becoming a member of the Bosque Film Society in 2023 and make plans to join us for the classic 1959 spy thriller-mystery “North By Northwest” produced and directed by the legendary Alfred Hitchcock at 6:30 p.m. Tuesday, March 14 at The Cliftex Theatre in Clifton with an introductory presentation by Bosque Film Society founding filmmaker in residence Will Godby.\n\nProduced and directed by Alfred Hitchcock and starring Cary Grant, Eva Marie Saint and James Mason, North by Northwest is a tale of mistaken identity, with an innocent man pursued across the United States by agents of a mysterious organization trying to prevent him from blocking their plan to smuggle microfilm, which contains government secrets, out of the country.\n\nNorth by Northwest is listed among the canonical Hitchcock films of the 1950s and is often listed among the greatest films of all time. It was selected in 1995 for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being “culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.” After its first screening, reviewers for The New Yorker and The New York Times immediately hailed it as a masterpiece of comedic, sophisticated self-parody.\n\nIf you want to watch all of our members-only FILM APPRECIATION NIGHT presentations absolutely FREE at the historic Cliftex Theatre, don’t miss another opportunity to see a film classic return to the silver screen by visiting our website at www.bosquefilm.com to check out the benefits and reasons for joining the Bosque Film Society.\n\nEvery month, the Bosque Film Society hosts its members-only FILM APPRECIATION NIGHT featuring classic films chosen by its members every December. After already featuring Metropolis in January and Singin’ In The Rain for Valentine’s Day, the remaining featured showings in 2023 will be North By Northwest (1959) March 14; Wizard of Oz (1939) April 11; Casablanca (1942) May 16; The Big Lebowski (1998) June 13; Gone With the Wind (1939) July 11; Amadeus (1984) Aug. 8; Lawrence of Arabia (1962) Sept. 12; Rocky Horror Picture Show (1975) Oct. 24; Stagecoach (1939) Nov. 14; 4th Annual Christmas Party (film to be determined) Dec.12.\n\nSince this will be a private showing, BYOB will be allowed, and the theatre concession stand will be open for purchases. Although the event will be closed to the public, those wishing to become Bosque Film Society members Tuesday night will be admitted.\n\nEstablished in October 2020, the Bosque Film Society is a non-profit organization focused on promoting film appreciation, education and production in Bosque County, Texas while serving as the “Friends of The Cliftex Theatre,” the longest continuously-operating movie theater in Texas, showing movies on the big screen since 1916.\n\nClick here for more information about becoming a Bosque Film Society member: https://bosquefilm.com/membership/"
