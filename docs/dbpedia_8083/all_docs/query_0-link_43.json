        "text": "The Fort Stockton Film Society is hosting date night with a showing of the classic Alfred Hitchcock film, “North by Northwest” on Saturday, June 11, at 7 p.m. As an added feature, there will be a classic Warner Brothers cartoon screened just before the main feature.\n\n“North by Northwest” stars Cary Grant as a Madison Avenue advertising executive wrongly accused of murder as he tries to outrun a ring of foreign agents led by a menacing James Mason. During the pursuit, he meets Eva Marie Saint who accompanies him as they travel across the U.S.\n\n“North by Northwest” is considered one of Alfred Hitchcock’s finest films and is often listed among the greatest films of all time. With its fast pace, stunning scenery, and Hitchcock surprises, it makes the perfect date night movie, but it’s also suitable for all age groups. It was selected for preservation in the U.S. National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being “culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.”\n\nThe screening will start at 7 p.m., with doors opening at 6:30 p.m. Admission is free, courtesy of the sponsor Edward Jones, but donations are gladly accepted.\n\n“North by Northwest” will be shown at the Nelson Street Theatre, located at 102 South Nelson Street in downtown Fort Stockton."
