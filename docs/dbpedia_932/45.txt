Richard Wynn MP is Notable.

Richard was born about 1625. He was the son of Owen Wynn and Grace Williams. He passed away about 1674

Sir Richard Wynn, 4th Baronet (1625–1674) succeeded his father Sir Owen Wynn, 3rd Baronet at Gwydir in 1660.

He was High Sheriff of Caernarvonshire for 1657, Member of the Parliament of England for Caernarvonshire, 1647–53 and 1661–75, and was associated with the municipal government of Denbigh. In 1659 he appears to have been implicated in the royalist insurrection arranged by Sir George Booth and Sir Thomas Myddelton (whose daughter, Sarah, he had married in 1654) and was for a while imprisoned at Caernarvon.

On his death in 1674 his estate passed to his daughter Mary (1661–89), who married, in 1678, Robert Bertie, who was then Lord Willoughby de Eresby, but later Duke of Ancaster and Kesteven, in whose family Gwydir remained until 1895. The baronetcy passed to John Wynn of Watstay (1628–1719), only son of Henry Wynn, tenth son of the first baronet; the 5th baronet was the last of the line..[1]
