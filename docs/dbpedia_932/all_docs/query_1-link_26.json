        "text": "Haverford’s long-time Vice President of Finance and Administration Richard “Dick” Wynn will retire at the end of this June, Wynn confirmed late Monday.\n\nWynn, who has served as VP since 1985, said he has decided to retire after almost 30 years at Haverford, effective June 30.\n\n“I will work part-time for a year or more as an assistant to Dan Weiss and assist in the transition to my successor,” he wrote in an email.\n\nWynn decided to take a “low key” approach to announcing his retirement, preferring to let word spread rather than making an announcement.\n\nWynn, who is 71, has served under nearly eight presidents and has used his knowledge of finance and higher education to occasionally teach a class, “Economics and Financing of Higher Education.”\n\nA job ad was posted on the Haverford website on Monday, January 27 calling for candidates.\n\nWynn is the second senior staff member to depart from the College since Weiss took over in the Fall."
