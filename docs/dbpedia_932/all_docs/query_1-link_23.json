        "text": "I’m a Melbourne based freelance cinematographer. I started shooting professionally in 2010 having relocated from England to make my home here in Victoria.\n\nStills photography was where my love of image creation came about, my Uncle was a photographer and my father worked at Illford in the North of England. The camera became a way of pushing me out of my comfort zone whilst still being able to hide away in the dark room at the end of the day.\n\nCuriosity is why I do what I do. The need to know how things work, how others think, it makes every job interesting to me, regardless of the subject matter.\n\nThe outputs don’t change my style and overall philosophy. I’ll shoot a range of corporate, TVC, short form narrative and doco, it can end up on any platform, it’s all fascinating to me, there’s always a new challenge.\n\nI’m of the opinion that, when we are able be our best selves, either on set or location, that is when the magic happens, that’s when a collective effort can create something greater than the sum of it’s parts. I love working with a crew and being out of my comfort zone again and again.\n\nIf that’s how you like to roll too then please get in touch…"
