She is predeceased by her husband of nearly 50 years, \"Benny\", Jean Benoit (1924 2001), her parents, Hannah (nee Brennan) and Dan McCann, brothers Dan (Eileen) and Leonard, and sister Doris Cavan (Don). She leaves behind her daughters, Elise and Liane (Louis Molgat), her cherished grandson, Sebastien, to whom she was a beloved \"Gran\", three generations of nieces and nephews, and many friends and neighbours.\n\nBest remembered for her brilliant smile and positive, effervescent personality, Lillian's outgoing nature led her to volunteer during Canada's 1967 Centennial year as a \"step-on\" tour guide for visitors arriving by chartered bus to Ottawa. Gifted with the Irish knack for storytelling, she continued to share her love of Ottawa and colourful tales of the Capital with visitors to the city well into her late 70's. Equally important to her were her years as a volunteer at \"High Horizons\", a weekly respite social group at MacKay United Church for adults living with physical challenges, where she spent every Tuesday from September to May for a record 50 years.\n\nLillian's love of people and conversation stayed with her to her final days and extended to her many caregivers. Special thanks to the incredible staff on the 6th Floor Orthopedics ward of the General Hospital for their tremendous kindness and care over the final weeks of our mother's life, and to Drs. Kirlew and Thomson at Bruyere for their ongoing support.\n\nAt Lillian's request, there will be no funeral. A private interment of her ashes at Notre Dame Cemetery will take place in December, followed in the spring by a gathering of family and friends in her memory at the family home in Ottawa.\n\nAfter any party Lillian hosted, she would inevitably turn to whichever daughter was standing nearby and exclaim with great satisfaction, \"I think that all came off well, didn't it!\". The same might be said of her near century of life: well lived, well loved, challenges borne and overcome, unfailingly cheerful. Yes, indeed Mom, I think that all came off well!\n\nArrangements entrusted to the Whelan Funeral Home tel. (613) 233-1488\n\nMURPHY Bernice Alice (nÃ©e Bonnell)\n\nPassed away peacefully at the May Court Hospice in Ottawa on November 26, 2023 at the age of 88. Predeceased by her parents George and Elizabeth Bonnell (formerly Maddigan) and her sister Ina, wife of Calvin Taylor. Left to celebrate her life and forever remember her are her husband of 25 years Douglas Chase, daughter Donna Sturgeon, son Wayne Murphy and daughter-in-law Laurie Peters, grandchildren William Sturgeon, Abigail (Sturgeon) Miller, and Mila Murphy, brother Ed (Joyce) Bonnell and many nieces, nephews, and extended family members, including former husband Timothy Murphy.\n\nBorn on the Burin Peninsula in Lamaline, Newfoundland, Bernice maintained her ties with the 'Rock', though married and moved to Trenton, Ontario where her two kids Donna and Wayne were born and raised. A travel companion, a hockey-mom and a medical assistant to Dr. Slechta for 20 plus years, Bernice's many professional and personal passions (including continuing her education through courses at Queen's University) and caring nature meant she maintained a broad and active community of friends. She enjoyed calligraphy, loved writing and was a loyal friend sending cards and letters across the globe.\n\nBerniceâs grandchildren (including her beloved grand-dogs Mick and Arlo) were her pride and joy. She held a deep faith enjoying Sunday church services where she staunchly favoured the King James Bible.\n\nBernice will also be remembered for her joy of walking and belonging to numerous walking clubs in the Canadian Volkssport Federation (CVF); she and her husband walked in all the Canadian provinces and all the States in the USA; she amassed over 40,000 kms of walking while a member of the CVF.\n\nBerniceâs family are grateful for all the support and care she received including from Dr. Schlossmacher and Dr. DubÃ©, her family doctor Dr. Ryan, the Pastoral Home Team and the Palliative Doctors Dr. Cross and Dr. Dyason, plus many Personal Support Workers who visited her daily. The May Court Hospice made her final days peaceful and without pain.\n\nThere will be no funeral, but a celebration of Berniceâs life will follow later. As expressions of sympathy, donations may be made in her memory to Parkinson's Canada, to Hospice Care Ottawa or the charity of your choice.\n\nArrangements entrusted to the Whelan Funeral Home tel.

LeBlanc) in New Brunswick, and his daughter the flutist Carmelia, who lives in Australia.\n\nThe funeral service will be held at Christ Church Cathedral in Ottawa, on Saturday 15th July at 3pm. Please add your condolences here. In lieu of flowers, Dad has asked that you please make a generous donation to the University of Ottawa Heart Institute.\n\nMy Dad was born in Salisbury NB, to Ida Rosanna (Taylor) & Arthur Nelson MacWilliam on 19 January 1934– until her dying day, his mother was the matriarch of the village community consisting of a large extended MacWilliam family. As a teenager, already eager to explore the outside world, Dad joined the Railway as telegraph operator.\n\nIn the 1950s, during the Cold War, he enlisted in the Royal Canadian Air Force as an aircraft mechanic, initially at Bagotville servicing helicopters. He was soon also posted to Goose Bay, Gander, Cold Lake (rocket project), and other inhospitable places, though calling Ottawa home soon after marrying my mother Shirley Kyle.\n\nIn the 60s he was posted to Bad-Solingen Germany (4-Wing), where he was highly respected for rapid & reliable servicing & overhaul of fighter jets. The family took the opportunity for some memorable holidays in Spain, Italy, Switzerland & France.\n\nIn the 70s he also served in Inuvik & Thule (Greenland), before finally leaving the Air Force to apply his skills to maintenance & overhaul of Government aircraft in Ottawa. He later took on a position servicing small survey aircraft, which sent him to the Andes in Peru & Bolivia: a 6-week excursion that turned into an 8-month saga complete with a Revolution, a Presidential abduction, and a severe earthquake, and at least one landing with only fumes & angel wings to bring him down safely.\n\nDad had a life-long reputation for his enthusiastic, energetic & skillful sporting activities: squash, baseball, curling (often as skipper), cross-country skiing, bicycling, and more recently golf. Since his retirement, he was a regular visitor at the Chateau Laurier gym facility, where he’d spend 2-3 hours 4 days a week training on all the various equipment, finishing off with a swim (including 1 full length of the pool under-water).\n\nHe and my mother, Shirley MacWilliam, were pillars of the Ottawa cultural scene for decades. Together they hosted artistic ‘Salons’ in their home, which brought together painters, sculptors, musicians, poets and other artistic individuals, who formed a creative network, and became their close friends.\n\nDad was an enthusiastic concert-goer, and also collected many favourite Classical and Jazz LPs & CDs. He had an encyclopaedic knowledge of Classic Movies, and built up a formidable library of DVDs.\n\nHis many close friends will remember him for his singular sense of humour, his genuine kindness, loyalty and great generosity, his sociable spirit, legendary fondness for good food, and always dapper good looks.\n\nLet it be said by all: There went a good and honourable man.\n\nCHOY, Ronald\n\nPeacefully on Monday, June 19, 2023 in his 89th year.

With endless style and creativity, Mary's interests were vast: literature, art galleries, museums and concerts. Yearly, Mary and Jack enjoyed the Ottawa Jazz Festival in their special spot âunder the tree'.\n\nMary loved her neighbours on Roslyn and they loved her back. She was the \"Queen of Brewer Pool\", a devotee of the Rideau Canal and Brewer Skating Oval. Mary created countless magical summers in Norway Bay, enjoying her children, grandchildren and the entire clan.\n\nMary was Love In Action, needing few words to share her trademark insight and wisdom. Her love was of the most special kind, forever yielding and forgiving, infinitely patient with an unmatched depth of giving - always seeking to grow her heart through understanding, grace and never giving up.\n\nMary's faith was deep and her beautiful, quiet nature and friendliness attracted others. We will never keep up with her but as per Mary's orders we will try. As she used to say, \"You will get there\", urging us to never give up on others or ourselves, trusting that we would find our strength when we needed it, that we were never truly alone and that Someone was always with us.\n\nHeartfelt thanks to all of Mary's care team, especially Gidey, Katie, Sue, Virginia, Elise, Eleanor, Charietel, Asha, Rosa, Rose (LIHN) and Drs.

She was always supportive of us and our families in everything we did, and she was always our greatest cheerleader. We know she is up there looking down on us now, watching over us, and guiding our families as we navigate through life without her by our side.\n\nAlthough she is no longer with us in this life, she will live on in the memories that we all have of her. Our mother was a strong, kind, warm-hearted, and generous soul with a heart of gold. Our families will always treasure the time we spent with her.\n\nHer inquisitive mind and sense of adventure led her to visit some of the most amazing places on Earth, including Mexico, the Cook Islands, Alaska, Australia, Hawaii, and Scotland. She was a long-time member of the Girl Guides of Canada. She loved to volunteer and lend a helping hand when needed.\n\nShe was active in her retirement community, whether it was helping to organize events, helping with the weekly church service, planting flowers in the garden, or looking out for her fellow residents.\n\nMom was always smiling and laughing. We know that it is difficult to lose someone so important to you, but my mom's memory will live on forever in our hearts. In her honour, we plan to spend the rest of our days living a life full of kindness and compassion, just as she did.\n\nShe will never be forgotten.\n\nTHIBAULT-LITTLE, Louise\n\nLouise nous a quittÃ© paisiblement Ã l'hÃ´pital avec sa famille aimante Ã ses cÃ´tÃ©s le mercredi 10 mai 2023, Ã l'Ã¢ge de 73 ans.

Private services will follow on Monday. In lieu of flowers, consider donations to Bladder Cancer Canada (https://bladdercancercanada.org/) or a charity of your choice.\n\nDad dedicated his career to public service. After attending Teacher's College in St. John's he taught in small outports in northern and central Newfoundland. In the 1970s, he relocated the family to Scarborough, Ontario where he translated his love of a drive to transporting passengers to their jobs and schools for more than 25 years. It was also common to hear us tell our friends \"Dad will take us\" or \"Dad will pick us up\" and we could always count on a ride, anytime or anywhere. After Dad retired from the TTC, he worked for Canadian Blood Services setting up donor clinics and delivering blood and platelets to hospitals for patients in need. Beyond his resume, he also spent most of his life helping his friends and family with everything from their car repairs, a tour around the city and Niagara Falls, emceeing a party, providing a place to stay for many family and friends, job searches and tax preparation.\n\nWhile he dedicated his career to public service, he dedicated his life to his family and friends. He was the proud husband to his wife of 53 years, Rowena (Barnes); a proud father to his daughter Paulette (Allan Tam) and to his son Shawn (Susan Weston), all who survive him. A few years ago, Mom and Dad moved to Ottawa to be closer to their grandchildren Samuel and Lillian. His grandchildren only knew their smiling Poppy who thought everything they said was either kind, funny or smart. For all he was, to us he was a grandfather, father and husband better than he was anything else.\n\nHe will be lovingly remembered by siblings Bernice Hynes, Halden Anthony (Marie), Judy Bailey, Noel Anthony (Marilyn), and Pauline Hynes (Kevin). As well, he will be lovingly remembered by the Barnes family as a brother-in-law to Fred (Mary), Harry (Grace), Stan (Maisie), Stewart (Mavis), Audrey Nippard, Winnie Waterman (Charles Hewitt), Frank (Pauline), Don (Glenda), Tom (Hilda), Derrick (Betty), Joyce (Ford) Hillier, and Joseph Legge.\n\nHe was preceded In death by his parents and parents-in-law Absalom and Johanna Barnes, brothers-in-law Ambrose Ford, George Barnes, Richard Hynes, Chris Waterman, Roy Nippard, Calvin Bailey, and Lloyd Barnes; and sister-in-law Sybil Legge. Many will also remember him as a good friend and colleague, cousin and much-loved uncle.\n\nAmong the many things that we learned from Dad, right now we remember how he taught us to live our best lives; to laugh as hard as you can and as often as you can; to find humour in almost all situations; to dine and dance with friends whenever you get a chance; love without limit; and when you're getting ready for a road trip, get on the road early, always keep your tank more than Â½ full, ignore maps and never forget when the ferry is crossing.\n\nArrangements entrusted to the Whelan Funeral Home tel.

Together they built a modest, now storied, dream home. She carried on courageously, determined, and unselfishly with boundless energy following his tragically premature death;\n\nA perfect mother;\n\nA loving and caring grandmother and great grandmother;\n\nA delightful mother-in-law;\n\nAlways close to her relatives, offering help if anyone needed it;\n\nA good neighbour and a cherished, loyal, lifelong friend to many;\n\nAlways ready to celebrate anything Irish;\n\nTotally dedicated, well respected worker during a 24 year career, always supporting her colleagues;\n\nAble to chat with and befriend anyone;\n\nPassionate about cataloguing stories of her criss-crossed ancestors, chronicling her daily and special activities,\n\ndriving, knitting something for everyone, Christmas, and being Canadian;\n\nA truly extraordinary person, a nonpareil, smart about what's important in life;\n\nProof that angels exist. This one had watery eyes, a perpetually running nose, shaky hands that made soup and hot\n\ndrinks an adventure, and a weakness for soft cover, light romance novels and souvenir bells.\n\nGoodbye Jean, Mom, Mother, Nana, Great Nana, Aunt Jean, Mrs. Herman.\n\nWe love you.\n\nYour Good Lord is waiting for you.
