        "text": "The University of North Florida announces that Dr. Richmond Wynn has been named the University’s vice president, chief diversity officer (CDO).\n\nWynn will provide strategic leadership for the University’s coordinated model for diversity, equity and inclusion while supporting and facilitating UNF’s Strategic Plan for Inclusive Excellence. As CDO, he will lead and collaboratively assist in recruiting and retaining underrepresented students, faculty and staff; assess and improve the campus climate for diversity and inclusion; promote inclusive excellence in scholarly and creative activity; and engage the community to encourage discourse while countering bias and discrimination.\n\n“There were strong candidates for this position, and we received significant input from the campus community that was extremely helpful in making the final decision,” said UNF Interim President Pamela Chally. “It is clear that Richmond is highly respected and looked upon as a trusted and collaborative leader and a motivator. His vast experience bringing people together will be a great benefit to UNF as he works to address challenges and to build a stronger culture of understanding, respect and unity on our campus.”\n\nAn associate professor of public health, Wynn joined UNF in 2000 and has held a number of roles including director of the UNF Counseling Center since 2019, director of the Master of Science in Clinical Mental Health Counseling program in the Brooks College of Health, and interim coordinator of the LGBT Resource Center (now the LGBTQ Center). He has served as the interim VP, chief diversity officer since November 2021.\n\nWynn has been actively involved with diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives for more than two decades and much of his research and community engagement has centered around the intersectionality of race, disability, sexual orientation and gender identity. He is a respected community leader and a longtime advocate for the LGBTQ community and other marginalized identity groups. Wynn is active with The Community Foundation for Northeast Florida and was recently awarded the Diamond Award for exemplary service to the LGBTQ youth community by JASMYN, where he has volunteered for 26 years. He was also the recipient of UNF’s inaugural Presidential Diversity and Inclusion Research Award.\n\nWynn received a doctorate in counselor education and a bachelor’s degree in sociology from the University of Florida. He earned a Master of Science in Health from UNF specializing in addiction and mental health counseling.\n\nThe University of North Florida has received the Higher Education Excellence in Diversity (HEED) award for seven consecutive years and is recognized as a Diversity Champion by INSIGHT into Diversity magazine."
