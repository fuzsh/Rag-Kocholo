I’ve been involved with computer imaging since it’s early days and I knew from the beginning that it would become mans most powerful visual tool. It’s now clear that the potential of computer imaging is infinite as demonstrated in film, television, games, themed entertainment and Virtual Reality formats.\n\nI try to create images that remind you of something you’ve never seen before. Images that seem familiar but are entirely new.\n\nI hope you enjoy my website.\n\nRichard Winn Taylor II DGA VES"
