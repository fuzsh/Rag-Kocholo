I drew and drew and drew. Perfectly natural, my mother told me. After all, she herself was a gifted artist as was her Lanier mother. How right Mother was! After reading about the Laniers and also the Bassanos, I am sure where we got our artistic gifts. The Laniers and Bassanos were artists, poets, writers and musicians of long ago ... and of now! Add to my Lanier grandmother, my mother, and me-- all the many gifted others with Lanier and Bassano blood. We have the gift! It is in our genes! Ponder the LANIER / BASSANO LEGACY. Thus, the LANIER line is where I start. I know also of the artistic and musical gifts of my BASSANO family. But I want to know about the others, whose lines branch into and out of the Lanier / Bassano lines-- the MALONES, the BIRDS, the WYNNES, the FOWKES, the THOROWGOODS and all the others. Their pages are here too. And what am of my Scottish ancestors -- the NICOLS, the MacKINNONS, and the DOUGLASSES. Maybe my love of exploring and an abiding love of the land. It seems the more I learn of my ancestors, the more I understand myself. To paraphrase an old friend of the family, \"... we are such stuff as genes are made of.\" Updated 2/6/2000!!!

A similar situation arises during the Wars of Roses when our family supported the Lancastrians, through marriage and property ties.

Sir John de ARDERNE and Margery ap MADOC Sir John de ARDERNE and Alice de VENABLES Peter de ARDERNE and Cicely de BREDBURY Charles de ARDERNE and Elizabeth RADCLIFFE John ARDERNE and Ellen DUNCALFE George ARDERNE and Katherine PALMER Richard ARDERNE and Margaret GREENE Alice ARDERNE and John DENNE With thanks to Steve Brown, Lynn Arderne and Bruce Ardern Note from Lynn Arderne: There is a South African branch to the family., begun in the early 1800s, when a young Arderne son, Richard Crewe Arderne, decided to make his fortune in South Africa. Unfortunately he and his wife died shortly after arriving in SA in 1849 but their son, John George Arderne (b. 1838), was the first male Arderne born in Africa and the Southern African branch are all descended from this one man. Bruce Ardern has Ardernes in Cheshire -- Altrincham, Timperley & Mere. DISCLAIMER: please bear in mind, some of the information on these Arderne pages, especially the dates may be skewed. Since I am still gathering material, I have not corrected the more obvious. Please pardon those errors and know that in time, I hope to get it right.

There is a 1769 deed acknowledgement between James and Susannah Watts and Nathaniel Manson in the court records of Halifax Co, VA. James Watts was a witness 12/12/1768 to the Halifax Co, VA will of James Taylor, who gave all to wife Allis (Alice?); other witnesses were John Shackelford and Beaverley Longan. There is note that in 1769 some of James Taylor's account was paid to James Watts. He is listed among others, as a defendant against Alice Taylor in 1770 and 1771.

(year and place from \"Southern Watts, Colonial and Revolutionary Soldiers\".) A second birthdate has been given for him in a DAR document of 1/6/1719.

But when researching the musical life of Venice in the late 16th century by chance one discovers the Bassano family and the fascinating destiny (though still laden with mystery) of Emilia, how can one resist the desire of sharing this stroke of luck? In the wake of Emilia, the beautiful Moor, appear other characters who are more well known, including a certain Shakespeare ... The adventure begins in Venice at the beginning of the 16th century, when a family of musicians originating from Bassano, a small nearby town, established itself there. The probable reason for their move? The Bassanos were of Jewish descent, and the town of Bassano most likely expelled them. They found in Venice a city more tolerant, for the moment. The first document mentioning a musician by the name of Bassano comes from the archives of the Scuola di San Marco, concerning a procession in which \"Ser Alvise da Bassan di maestro Jeronimo\" figured as trumpeter or cornettist: Alvise de Bassano, son of Jeronimo, for whom other documents attest his existence as member of the Doge's band of piffari. To give the details of Alvise's career in Venice, and later Bologna, would take us too far afield, but for those interested in the lives of the Bassanos, we mention a basic work which has been most valuable to us in the preparation of this article: The Bassanos, Venetian Musicians and Instrument Makers in England, 1531 1665, by David Lasocki and Roger Prior, published by Scholar Press. In the 1520s, Alvise seems to have made a trip to England as a player of the sackbut. In fact, the documents concerning the musicians at the court of Henry VIII mention, in addition to the four (!) English musicians stemming from the court orchestra (which had sunk quite low since it had been left to Henry by his father) six newly arrived Italians, among the names of which one finds \"Alvisy de Blasia.\" If the transcription of Alvise for Alvisy seems obvious, what can \"Blasia\" mean? There are various opinions: perhaps it can be traced to San Biasio, one of the churches in Venice? Whatever the case may be, what is certain is that Alvise returned to Venice in 1528. In 1531, he went back to England, this time with three of his brothers, Jasper, John, and Anthony, all in the musical service of Henry VIII. They returned to Venice in 1536. Then, in 1537, another brother, Baptista, left for England. This brother is even more interesting, since he is the future father of ... Emilia. The fascinating quadrille continued, with the departure for London in 1538 of Anthony, followed by Jacomo, another brother, as instrument maker / wine importer! To say the least, the Bassano family was not put off by traveling! What also seems evident is that the talent of the six sons of Jeronimo (in order of birth, Jacomo, Alvise, Jasper, John, Anthony, and Baptista), as instrumentalists and makers of wind instruments, was recognized not only in Venice but also in London. In the years 1535 1540, Henry VIII decided to improve the musical staff at his court, and he charged his Venetian agent, Edmond Harvel, to recruit the Bassano brothers. The Bassanos demanded substantial guarantees, for in order to leave Venice, they were required to obtain the authorization of the Doge and would lose their employment there. Even more important, the Bassanos were of Jewish origin, which meant that they ran certain risks in the contemporary political climate of London, even if Henry VIII, who had broken definitively with Rome, sought their goodwill. The negotiations were successful, and at the end of 1539, Alvise, John, Baptista, and Jasper, along with their respective families, made a definitive departure from Venice for England, rejoining Anthony there. (Jacomo had returned to Italy on the death of his father, Jeronimo, probably to take over his business as instrument maker). Here we are unable to follow their adventure: for this one should consult the book mentioned above. In three generations, the Bassanos-musicians, jurists, and merchants- became, through a few solid alliances, one of the more respectable families of the English \"gentry,\" endowed with a family crest and several properties. And now, finally, to our female character, Emilia. (This preamble was necessary to introduce our character and understand her personality.) Emilia Bassano was baptised on January 25, 1569. We know the details of her youth through the notebooks of the astrologer Simon Forman, whom she consulted a number of times, starting in 1597. Thus, we learn that she lost her father at about the age of seven, then her mother, at the age of 18. Her father, Baptista Bassano, was one of the six brothers mentioned above. Her mother was Margaret Johnson, Baptista's concubine. Shortly before the passing of her mother, Emilia became lady-in-waiting for the Countess of Kent, thus coming into contact with the Court, where her great beauty, dark complexion, and black hair (unusual in England) made her stand out. Numerous conquests are attributed to her, but she was officially the recognized mistress of the old Lord Henry Hunsdon, the Lord Chamberlain, who kept her in sumptuous fashion. She had a son by him, also named Henry. To make the birth more respectable, Emilia was married off to Alphonso Lanier, musician of the Queen, in October 1592. From their union Odillia was born, to die at the age of nine months. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- ********************************************************************** CHAPTER: 007: Bassano2 ********************************************************************** The Masque of Oberon was performed for Prince Henry at Whitehall for New Year's, 1611. This was the year of publication of Emilia Bassano's book: the coincidence is too striking to not take this disc as an illustration of her biography, especially as compositions by the Bassanos are included. During the masques, which frequently punctuated life at court, the members of the royal family mixed with aristocrats, dancers, musicians, and actors amidst sumptuous settings and costumes. Surviving in a very fragmented state, this masque was very patiently reconstructed by Philip Pickett, who even took care to arrange the musicians in the same way as in the Banqueting House of the English court. Needless to say, the visual aspect of the entire experience is lacking, but the effectiveness of the musical performance is sufficient to transport us back in time several centuries, and to imagine Emilia Bassano amidst the fairies. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- In addition to the book cited, one may consult the following website for an exhaustive study of Emilia Bassano by Kari Boyd McBride, Women's Studies, University of Arizona http://www.u.arizona.edu/ic/mcbride/lanyer/lanyer.htm Email: kari@u.arizona.edu\">kari@u.arizona.edu ---------------------------------------------------------------------- The Lanier family was already linked to the Bassano family, since Nicholas Lanier, court musician, had married in his second marriage Lucretia Bassano, daughter of Anthony, and thus Emilia's cousin. Huguenot, originally from Rouen, the Lanier family arrived at the court (represented by Nicholas, flutist and cornettist) in 1561. Nicholas also had six musical sons (the parallel between the two families is fascinating), including Alphonso, born in 1563 from his first marriage. Alphonso Lanier tried unsuccessfully to have himself ennobled, particularly after accompanying the Count of Essex on his Irish Campaign. This permanent barrier to a higher social rank, and thus a better financial situation, would make Emilia say (to her dear astrologer) that her husband had ruined her and obliged her to ply the trade of courtesan in order to survive. Whatever the case, the poor Alphonso Lanier would never be more than Captain of Arms ... Alphonso, who died on September 20, 1613, used far more energy in attracting the attention of his protectors to his feats of arms, and in seeking financial support, than he did in plying his subaltern trade of flutist. After the death of Queen Elizabeth in 1603, he no longer appeared on the lists of musicians of her successor, James I. Emilia began her confidences with Simon Forman in 1597, on the occasion of one of the military expeditions of her husband, this time to the Azores. Simon Forman was reputed to be attentive to his clients, the relationship being part of the treatment which he advertised. What exactly would he have received from Emilia? We do not know very much: perhaps she let herself be drawn in by the astrologer, but not to the point of becoming his mistress. What is certain is that in 1600 all relations between them ceased, Forman addressing her very amiably as sorceress. Unfortunately for us, from this date on it becomes rather more difficult to trace the existence of Emilia Bassano. It is known that she stayed for a while with the Countess of Cumberland at Cookham. Then, four years after the death of Alphonso, she obtained authorization to open a school in the parish of St-Giles-in-the-Fields, from which she obtained some income toward living expenses. (The passing of her husband had given rise to a long lawsuit between Emilia and the Lanier family.) She lived the rest of her life in relative poverty, was arrested and evicted from her school-home in 1619 for non-payment of rent, and was buried on April 3, 1645, at St. James Clerkenwelle at the age of 66. Her son, Henry, who had in turn become flutist at the court, predeceased her in 1633. Such an existence, interesting but scarcely unusual from the point of view of the women of her time, does not justify her posterity. A beautiful courtesan, from a lineage of musicians, adored, then abandoned, Emilia is first and foremost the author of an undisputed masterwork of English poetry, Salve Deus Rex Judaeorum, published in 1611, when she was 42. The first woman published at the end of the English Renaissance, she reveals in this work not only an effective pen but also a strong character, which one would describe today as proto-feminist. Each of the nine poems which make up the collection is preceded by a dedication (sometimes lengthy) to women of her time: in order, Queen Anne, Princess Elizabeth, \"all virtuous women in general\", and the Countess of Cumberland, her protector. Passionately converted, Emilia opts nevertheless for a title which salutes God first of all as King of the Jews. In the contemporary context, how could one have any doubt about her background? Moreover, Emilia does not hesitate to reinterpret the Scriptures in her own way: the principal subject is a meditation on the Passion of Christ, attributing the responsibiblity for the Crucifixion to men alone. In a section entitled \"Eve's Apologie in Defense of Women\", Emilia gives Adam the responsibility for original sin, and deduces from this that today women must defend their religious, social, and political equality with men. This was in 1611, let us remember! Finally, the other claim to fame for Emilia Bassano was that of having been, without a doubt, the mistress of William Shakespeare. We say \"without a doubt\", though this theory, advanced in The Times by the historian A. L. Rowse, is subject to controversy. But all the evidence seems to suggest it. Emilia's mother, as we know, was named Margaret Johnson: she was the aunt of Robert Johnson, lutenist and composer, musician for Shakespeare's theater company. Another piece of evidence is the fact that the Lord Chamberlain, Lord Hunsdon, Emilia's lover, became in 1594 the patron of Shakespeare's company of actors. The scant facts which are known of Shakespeare's biography will never allow absolute certainty. Shakespeare's sonnets are made up of two parts: the first, dedicated to a young man he became very attached to, most probably the young Count of Southampton the second has for its theme the love of the poet for a woman of easy virtue (\"The bay where all men ride\"), though married, with dark hair and eyes, known as the \"Dark Lady\". We know that Emilia, Italian, was of Sephardic Jewish origin, thus of a very Mediterranean type. Another strange coincidence: the romantic character in the Merchant of Venice is a Venetian named ... Bassanio. Where did Shakespeare hunt up this name, and where did he get his detailed knowledge of Italy? Moreover, actors and musicians mixed freely at the Court, and one knows that Shakespeare, as well as Ben Jonson, collaborated with Thomas Lupo, another relative of Emilia's through marriage. Finally, Shakespeare, in one of these sonnets, calls his mistress \"my music\". Who, more than Emilia-Bassano by birth, Lanier by marriage-was immersed in music, even if we do not know if she herself was a musician? Emilia Bassano, poet, courtesan, mistress of Shakespeare? Whatever the truth may be, Emilia, as we see her, is a fascinating and mysterious woman who, today as yesterday, does not reveal herself completely and retains her independence. But she is worthy of being known, and above all serves as a guide to lead us into the musical life of England in the late-16th and 17th centuries. In 1994, a musician named Peter Goodwin, born in 1945, a member of the Philharmonia Orchestra, professor of sackbut and trombone at the Royal College of Music in London, member of His Majesty's Sagbutts and Cornetts, the English Baroque Soloists, and The English Concert, decided to change his name: from then on he would be called Peter Bassano. He was the distant descendant of one Giovanni Bassano. From henceforth, he consecrated himself to the repertoire of his forebears ... ---------------------------------------------------------------------- ********************************************************************** CHAPTER: 008: Bassano3 ********************************************************************** Visit Bassano del Grappa, Italy, the hometown of our Bassano family.

Wife: Lucreece Bassano LifeNotes: she was the daughter of the Bassano family of musicians who came to England to serve Henry VIII. They probably originated from the city of Bassano del Grappa near Venice. At that time, the fabulous Renaissance courts of the Medici were winding down and the artists and musicians of those courts were seeking work elsewhere. So one can imagine that our Lucreece was of a very cultured background. Assuredly, she was as instrumental as her husband, Nicholas Lanier, in passing her own enlightenment on to her children. Born: probably 1530-40, London, England Married: before 1565 in England Died: about 1/4/1633-34; buried in buried at St Alphege, East Greenwich, England Parents: Anthony Bassano and Elena de Nazzi. See their Bassano page. Husband: Nicholas Lanier LifeNotes: Nicholas Lanier of Rouen, France, played the flute and the cornet. He was master flutist to Henri II of France. During the Protestant persecutions, he was a Huguenot to England with safe passage arranged for him by his patroness, the widowed queen Catherine de Medici. Nicholas arrived at the new court of Elizabeth I in 1561. Behold Elizabeth I and check out her garments! The bright young queen Elizabeth I, thrilled at the New Age she generated, drew artists, poets, scholars and musicians to England from all over Europe. Naturally they wished to be near the brilliant star Elizabeth. Here the Arts were glorified. Here was the epicenter of a cultural explosion. This was the time of William Shakespeare and Ben Johnson. Explorers such as Francis Drake were discovering new worlds; Walter Raleigh was forming expeditions colonize them. The Laniers were right in the midst of it. In court, marriages were arranged by the Queen. Nicholas Lanier, was paired with Lucreece Bassano, daughter of an Italian musician of the Royal Orchestra. Nicholas was made Master of Flutes. The couple prospered, acquiring a great deal of property in East Greenwich, Blackheath, and nearby. Three generations of this remarkable family served the British Monarchy as court musicians, poets and artists; their efforts are well-documented- and their efforts were well-rewarded. Born: probably about 1520-30 probably in Rouen, France Married: before 1565 in England Died: will was proved 1/28/1611-12; buried in East Greenwich, England Parents: Their children were: * Innocent Lanier, musician, Gentleman of the King' s Chamber never married; died 1625. * Jerome Lanier, musician on the sackbut (something like a trombone), artist; married twice, m-1st to Phrisdewith Grafton (buried 11/30/1625 in East Greenwich, England), 4 children-- Ellyn Lanier (b./d. 1615), William Lanier (a musician), Nicholas Lanier (d. young), Bridget Lanier; m-2nd to Elizabeth Willeford, 9 children-- Endymion Lanier, Elizabeth Lanier (m.

An Elizabethan Rumour Read with a VERY open mind and vivid imagination. And when you have read this, surf on over to Will's place, Shakespeare's Globe site There is a book, published by Clarkson N. Potter, called The Poems of Shakespeare's Dark Lady (a reprint of the original, printed in 1611). In his introduction to this book of Emelia Bassano Lanier's poetry (Salve Deus Rex Judeorum--Hail, God, King of the Jews), the Elizabethan scholar and author A. L. Rouse speculated that Emelia was The Dark Lady of Shakespeare's Sonnets. Prior to her marriage to Alphonse Lanier, she was involved with the Lord Chamberlain, Lord Henry Hunsdon, son of Mary Boleyn, nephew of Anne Boleyn. It is said that the son Henry Lanier, born to Emelia, was Lord Hunsdon's. The marriage to Alphonse was arranged by the Queen to settle the problem. Alphonse was conveniently at sea most of the time-- a gentleman volunteer, on voyages under command of the Earl of Southampton. The affair with William Shakespeare supposedly took place soon after this marriage. We know Shakespeare wrote hints of his own life into his work -- all artists do that. Remembering this, one can \"read in\" all sorts of \"proof\", when looking at his plays. Looking at the Sonnets to the Dark Lady, it is clear theirs was a passionate, if uneasy, affair. There are enumerable defensive \"swipes\" at her. In reading Emelia's poems, it is clear she was high-spirited --a powerful personality, as Rouse puts it-- with a gift for words. And she was also a woman with a cause, that of women wronged. Still there are glimpses of Emelia's relationship with William Shakespeare. It took place during his early days in London where he had moved his family to live in Bishopsgate. It was also during the early stages of patronage by the Earl of Southampton. Rouse describes a skit of Love's Labour's Lost, played out at the house of the Earl of Southampton, with Emelia as Rosaline and the actor-dramatist Shakespeare himself as Berowne (Biron). And imagine A Midsummer's Nights Dream, before it was officially presented, played in the forests of Southampton's estate. See Emelia as Hermia, seeking her fickle lost love ... Delicious!! ---------------------------------------------------------------------- ********************************************************************** CHAPTER: 010: Beall ********************************************************************** Carol Middleton's Beall Family 1 William and (-?)
