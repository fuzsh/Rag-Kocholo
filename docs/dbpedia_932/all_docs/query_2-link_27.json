        "text": "May 20, 2020\n\nThe Honorable Mike Crapo and The Honorable Sherrod Brown\n\nCommittee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs\n\nUnited States Senate\n\n534 Dirksen Senate Office Building\n\nWashington, D.C. 20510\n\nRE: Urgent Need for the Nonprofit Property Protection Act (H.R. 4523)\n\nDear Chairman Crapo and Ranking Member Brown:\n\nWe urgently request that you support including the language from H.R. 4523, the Nonprofit Property Protection Act, in the next COVID-19 recovery bill.\n\nDuring a time when nonprofits are stretched thin because of COVID-19 to meet essential community services, many commercial insurance companies across the country are unwilling to insure those on the frontlines — homeless shelters, domestic violence shelters, food banks, drug and alcohol treatments programs, foster family and adoption services, animal rescues, child and family services and many more.\n\nAffordable insurance is never easy for nonprofits to find, but we are now in an insurance crisis on top of a national health emergency.\n\nH.R. 4523 is a no-cost solution that will allow nonprofits to fix this problem for themselves. The bill will allow certain financially strong risk retention groups serving 501(c)(3) charitable nonprofits to offer property coverage in addition to the more difficult liability insurance they already provide. Because commercial insurance companies only offer property and liability together as a package for small and mid-sized nonprofits, it hinders these organizations from providing the help nonprofits so desperately need now. Because commercial insurers aren’t interested in affordably serving the small and mid-sized nonprofit market, the legislation would not harm them.\n\nH.R. 4523 is especially urgent now – on July 1st 25 percent of the nonprofits will face the daunting prospect of renewing their property/casualty insurance.\n\nRep. Lacy Clay (D-MO) is the lead sponsor of H.R. 4523. His subcommittee held a hearing on the bill in January. H.R. 4523 is identical to H.R. 6292 in the 115th Congress whose lead sponsor was former Rep. Dennis Ross (R-FL).\n\nWe fervently ask you to do whatever you can to help ensure that the language of H.R. 4523 is incorporated into the next COVID-19 recovery bill.\n\nThank you for your many years of service to our nation and for your consideration of this request.\n\nSincerely,"
