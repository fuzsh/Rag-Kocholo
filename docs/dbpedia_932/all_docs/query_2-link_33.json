        "text": "Betty Thomas was born July 27, 1947 in St. Louis, Missouri, graduating from Ohio University with a BA in fine arts. Initially sidetracked, Betty first taught school in Chicago but found herself restricted and needing more of an open forum for self-expression than a classroom. She found herself drawn inextricably to comedy. After toiling as a waitress, she became part of the Second City improvisational troupe where she made use of her towering (6' 1\") imposing features in aggressive routines and sketches. True to form, she made her film debut in the sketch satire Tunnel Vision (1976) which parodied TV programming. The movie is lesser known today for its satirical bite and more for its exceptional cast of up-and-coming comedy artists at the time including Chevy Chase, Laraine Newman, John Candy, Joe Flaherty, Gerrit Graham, Howard Hesseman, and the team of Al Franken and Tom Davis. Other innocuous comedies/spoofs followed such as Chesty Anderson U.S. Navy (1976), Mit einem Bein im Kittchen (1980), and Loose Shoes (1978) which, at the very least, helped to bulk up her comedy resume. She also appeared as a regular on The Fun Factory (1976), which was three parts quiz show, silly sketches, and audience participation.\n\nIronically, Betty achieved her stardom not in comedy but in hard-hitting drama. Doing a complete about face as tough-talking Officer Lucille Bates on the hit police series Polizeirevier Hill Street (1981), she displayed both grit and vulnerability as she stood nose-to-nose alongside the rest of the male-oriented precinct. She was nominated for six Emmys in all and won the \"Best Supporting Actress\" trophy in 1985. Some equally compelling mini-movie roles came along with this success. In the late 1980s, Betty made an abrupt and concentrated move into TV and film directing, one of her last acting roles being that of the butch, underhanded scoutmaster (and Shelley Long's misery-inducing nemesis) in the obvious comedy film Die Wilde von Beverly Hills (1989).\n\nBetty received her bookend Emmy award while directing the cable sitcom Dream On (1990). She never lost her taste for comedy satire, however. One of her major box office successes would come with the spot-on parody Die Brady Family (1995). She has continued in this lighter vein of late, guiding the one-man promotion machine Howard Stern to a surprisingly entertaining critical hit with Private Parts (1997), which was based on his memoirs, the Jennifer Love Hewitt film Ich kann's kaum erwarten (1998), I Spy (2002), an updated remake of the 1960s TV series, and Wie überleben wir Weihnachten? (2004). In recent years she has directed TV movies and episodes of such series as \"Audrey\" and \"Grace and Frankie.\"\n\nCountry singer/songwriter Bobbie Gentry was born Roberta Lee Streeter on July 27, 1944 in Chickasaw County, Mississippi. Gentry grew up in poverty on her grandparents' farm after her parents divorced when she was a little girl. She learned to play piano by watching the church pianist. Her grandmother traded a milk cow for a piano so Bobbie could practice regularly. She wrote her first song \"My Dog Sergeant is a Good Dog\" on the piano; she later used this song as a humorous part of her nightclub act. At age six, Gentry went to live with her father in Greenwood, Mississippi, where she attended elementary school. Bobbie next moved to Palm Springs, California to live with her mother. It was during this time she taught herself how to play the banjo, guitar, bass and vibes. She began performing at a country club while still in high school and graduated from Palm Valley School in 1960. At age 14, Gentry took her stage name from the 1952 movie Wildes Blut (1952). She briefly worked as a dancer and singer in a Las Vegas revue show called Folies Bergere before moving back to California. Bobbie studied philosophy at UCLA and subsequently transferred to the Los Angeles Conservatory of Music, where she majored in theory, counterpoint and composition while working as a secretary to keep herself afloat. In 1967, Gentry scored a massive smash hit with the moody and compelling story song \"Ode to Billie Joe\", which peaked at number one on the Billboard pop charts for a whole month. Bobbie won three Grammy Awards for this song, including Best New Artist and Best Vocal Performance by a Female. In addition, the Academy of Country Music named Gentry the Top New Female Vocalist of 1967. \"Ode to Billie Joe\" has been covered by such artists as Sinéad O'Connor, Tammy Wynette, Patti Smith and Ike Turner & Tina Turner. Gentry had only modest success with the offbeat \"Okolona River Bottom Band\" and a spirited rendition of Doug Kershaw's \"Louisiana Man\". Bobbie recorded three charming duets with Glen Campbell which included a cover of \"Let It Be Me\" by The Everly Brothers. Bobbie had another substantial Top 30 hit with the sassy \"Fancy\", which did well on both the pop and country charts. (Reba McEntire had a Top 10 country hit with her 1991 cover of this particular song). In Europe, Gentry enjoyed a number one hit in England with \"I'll Never Fall in Love Again\" and a Top 40 success with \"Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head\". In the late 60s, she headlined her own Las Vegas revue show in which she did the dance choreography, designed the costumes, and even wrote and arranged the music. In 1974, Gentry hosted her own short-lived TV variety show. That same year, she wrote and sung the haunting ending credits theme song \"Another Day, Another Time\" for the terrific redneck exploitation winner Macon County Line (1974). \"Ode to Billie Joe\" was adapted into a movie in 1976. Bobbie was briefly married to both Desert Inn Hotel manager Bill Harrah and fellow country singer/songwriter Jim Stafford. In the late 70s, Bobbie Gentry quit the music business and went on to run her own TV production company in Los Angeles.\n\nAt the age of three, André Zacharie Raimbourg and his family moved to a town in the region of Normandy called Bourville. He finished school at the age of 15 and began to work as a baker. He was already playing harmonica, mandoline and cornet when he engaged himself in a village band. In the beginning of 1940 while in the army making music-hall show for the troops, he changed his name into Andrel like his idol Fernandel from whom he was singing the songs. He began to write his own songs, making a name by himself, and so in 1942 took a new name, further from \"Fernandel\": Bourvil(le). He was recognized as a stand-up comic, dressed as a farmer grown too fast for the shirt he wears, hair coming down on his forehead, a simple minded but crafty naive. At the end of the war the radio extended his fame. His first parts on the screen were based only on this character. It's only in 1956 with Zwei Mann, ein Schwein und die Nacht von Paris (1956) of Claude Autant-Lara that he really began to give his real potential as an actor on the screen. His greatest popular successes will come under the direction of Gérard Oury.\n\nSelf professed Star Trek geek who watched and loved the Trek series \"Deep Space Nine\" and set out to write for them. At the time, Star Trek had an open script submission policy and Fuller contributed a spec, leading to a pitching opportunity. When he had sold a couple of stories to Deep Space Nine, Fuller was hired to be a full staff writer for sister Trek series \"Voyager\" in its fourth season. He worked on Voyager for the remainder of its seven-year run, working his way up to co-producer of the series.\n\nDuring the last year of Voyager, Fuller delivered the pilot spec for \"Dead Like Me\" to his agent who immediately sold it. \"Dead Like Me\" was canceled after two seasons, but Fuller was a trusted commodity at this point and moved on to create the short-lived but critically acclaimed \"Wonderfalls\".\n\nFuller has had a meteoric career in television and has worked non-stop since first pitching to Deep Space Nine in 1993. He wrote and produced an animated movie with Mike Mignola called \"The Amazing Screw-On Head\". He then moved on to co-executive produce and write for \"Heroes\" which became a smash hit. Even though it got picked up for a second season Fuller left the show to create his critically acclaimed new show \"Pushing Daisies\"."
