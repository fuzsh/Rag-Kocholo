That concept remains at the heart of everything we do for Main Street families every day.\n\nThrough our HOW MONEY WORKSTM materials, we teach people the basics of personal finance because we believe a solid foundation is the key to making healthy money choices. We pioneered the \"Buy Term and Invest the Difference\" philosophy - a crusade which revolutionized the life insurance industry and the investment business. And from the beginning, we have only offered term life insurance as part of our commitment to only market products that are right for the consumer, a philosophy we still apply to our solutions today.\n\nHOW MONEY WORKSTM\n\nWhen it comes to finances, how much do you know? If you're like most people, you probably know little about personal finance. Perhaps you think long-term security is impossible on your income. But, the truth is, no matter what your income level, you can achieve financial security. You just have to take the time to learn a few simple principles.\n\nUse the settings option to select your preferred subtitles/CC language."
