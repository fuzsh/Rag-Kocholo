        "text": "Physical description\n\nPencil and watercolour costume design on cream paper for Lawyer Pettifog and his Follower, captioned below in watercolour lettered with a brush: 'LAWYER PETTIFOG and his FOLLOWER', depicting a thin, cunning-looking lawyer on the left with demented eyes and a manic grin, presenting a writ in his right hand, and holding other legal documents under his left arm. On the right is a boorish, portly man, standing in profile, holding a cudgel menacingly over his left shoulder. By his left foot is an artist's palette signed in ink: 'Dykwynkyn'.\n\nSummary\n\nThis is a design by Richard Wynn Keene or Dykwynkyn (1809-1887), for characters in the pantomime Jack and the Beanstalk, or, Harlequin Leap-Year and the Merry Pranks of the Good Little People which opened at the Theatre Royal Drury Lane on 26 December 1859, with set designs supervised by the well-known scene designer William Beverley, and costumes and pantomime 'big heads' designed by the artist, sculptor, mask and property maker and costume designer Richard Keene. Pettifogger (as his name appears in the playbill) is described as 'a Limb of the Law' and appears in the scene featuring Jack's Cottage and a Wintry Landscape in Devonshire.\n\nIn an article of 1867 the playwright T.W. Robertson described Dykwynkyn as: 'the presiding genius of all theatrical Christmas revels.' The playbill credits: 'The Masks, Allegorical Devices and Designs by DYK-WYN-KYN the Celebrated Artist in Pantomime Physiognomy'.\n\nFor his pantomime work Keene used the name Dykwynkyn which he characteristically signed on an artist's palette on the ground. He was also responsible for designs for a number of other lavish productions of the day, and for these he was billed as Mr. R.W. Keene."
