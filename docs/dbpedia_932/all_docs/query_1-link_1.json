        "text": "Amity Medical Group is a 501(c)3 nonprofit medical practice serving the community in the greater Charlotte area of North Carolina in Gaston & Mecklenburg Counties. We provide high-quality, affordable, comprehensive primary care services and linkage to care and coordination of care using our Board-certified team of healthcare professionals and in collaboration with our community partners. We come together to serve a greater purpose than what we could offer individually. Our mission and vision serves our community and we hope that anyone we touch becomes even better than they were yesterday. We have an adherence to our cause and are committed to advancing towards a greater cause.\n\nWe are an independent Adult & Pediatric Primary Care practice with an on-site pharmacy specializing in HIV & Infectious Disease Care, LGBTQIA+ Care, Diabetes Care, and Addiction Medicine & Counseling including Medication Assisted Treatment (MAT) for opioid, alcohol, and tobacco addiction.\n\nWe have been recognized both locally and nationally for outstanding quality of care, community leadership, and service. Our staff is dedicated to providing our patients with the best, most comprehensive care possible in a warm friendly family practice atmosphere.\n\nThe vision of founding members came together in 2015 (listed in alphabetical order): Amina Abubakar, Ahmed Elgohary, Wesley Thompson and Richard Wynn. Their original goal was to create a welcoming place in the community with a variety of medical care services, pharmacy and collaborative care resources all under one roof for the underserved HIV community. In late 2015, Ballantyne Family Medicine was co-owned by Wesley Thompson and Richard Wynn providing primary care, internal medicine and primary HIV care.\n\nAmity Group Foundation became a nonprofit organization to start providing grant-funded medical services. Amity Group Foundation was awarded the Ryan White grant for the first time in March 2016. Olivia Bentley became the first official Executive Director in late 2017. Ballantyne Family Medicine merged with Amity Group Foundation in January 2018. Amity Group Foundation changed its name to Amity Medical Group on March 30, 2018. Today, Amity Medical Group remains a 501(c)3 medical practice with grant programs like Ryan White, Mecklenburg County PrEP, CARES Act grant and continues to apply for more awards through HRSA and SAMHSA.\n\nAmity Medical Group continues to innovate everyday and now provides comprehensive primary care, many specialty care services and provides non-medical coordination of care and linkage to care services through our community partners. We continue to collaborate with community partners and bring as many resources under one roof at all of our locations including pharmacy, case management, and more.\n\n*Disclaimer: None of the founding members have any control over Amity Medical Group. Daily operations and decision making is delegated to the Executive Director/CEO who is supervised by the Board of Directors.*"
