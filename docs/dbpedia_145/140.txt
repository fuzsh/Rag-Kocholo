For those who don't know, Animal Crossing was originally a Nintendo 64 game, and was in fact the last game Nintendo released on the system. Not even a year later, the game appeared again in Japan on the GameCube and it's almost identical to the Nintendo 64 version save for a few changes like GBA connectivity. My question is how was Animal Crossing ported to the GameCube so quickly? The debug menu shows remnants of the Nintendo 64 version like Controller Pak support. Did Nintendo just take the original source code, make some changes, and recompile it for the GameCube?

I doubt anyone knows the exact process. Whatever it was, it was probably at least a little similar to what they did with Ocarina of Time and Majora's Mask.

But if it was something that someone outside of Nintendo could easily apply today to any arbitrary N64 ROM, someone probably would have done it by now.

From what I heard, it's essentially a highly customised emulator, and a slightly modified ROM. It's been a while since I read that though, so I might be completely wrong.

Those are the zelda games, which are emulated - Animal Crossing + is an actual GC game (and indeed not a straight port), though extremely likely to have more than a nominal and practical correlation with the N64 one

It does have a NES emulator which somewhat fits that description, though!
