The last time your island was backed up will be displayed in the bottom-left corner of the title screen.\n\nCan I disable island backup after it is enabled?\n\nHow do I restore data from my island backup?\n\nWhat is transferred to the new console with a full island transfer?\n\nWhat is transferred to the new console when a resident moves?"
