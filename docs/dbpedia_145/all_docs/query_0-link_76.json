        "text": "Highlights\n\nOne Animal Crossing: Wild World player achieves a rare feat after just 5 minutes of playing.\n\nOne of the villagers gifts the player a Master Sword item from the Legend of Zelda series.\n\nThe gift shows the unpredictability of Animal Crossing, as most players need to wait a long time to find the item on offer from Tom Nook or Wishy.\n\nIn a surprising twist of luck, an Animal Crossing: Wild World player received the coveted Master Sword just five minutes into their playthrough. Typically, Wild World, like other titles in the Animal Crossing series, uses a random number generator (RNG) to distribute some items to new players. However, receiving one of the rarest items in the game so early on is nothing short of miraculous. This unexpected gift from a villager showcases the delightful unpredictability that keeps players coming back to the charming world of Animal Crossing.\n\nNearly two decades after its launch, Animal Crossing: Wild World continues to captivate players with its enduring charm and innovative gameplay. Widely regarded as one of the best Animal Crossing games in the series, Wild World stands out not only for its mechanics but also for the wave of nostalgia it brings to longtime fans. Wild World launched just a year before The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess, which seemingly gave Nintendo the idea to add a crossover element between these beloved franchises, the Master Sword, adding another layer of excitement for players who were set on hunting the item down.\n\nIn a heartwarming post, Reddit user ducky_wuz_here shared a screenshot from their Animal Crossing: Wild World gameplay, showcasing an unexpected gift from the villager Tabby: a Master Sword. This stroke of luck has delighted the community, sparking humorous comments. Many users likened the moment to the iconic scene from the original Zelda game, where the old man hands Link a sword, saying, \"It's dangerous to go alone! Take this.\" Fans also noted that Tabby, one of the cutest villagers in Animal Crossing, is the perfect character to give this gift, as quirky moves are not out of character for her at all.\n\nThe Master Sword Is a “Basic” Item in Wild World\n\nIn her interaction with ducky_wuz_here, Tabby commented on their Bell shortage, expressing concern over their ability to afford basic items, only to then gift them the Master Sword, a rare item that many players struggle to obtain after hours of gameplay. The sword is a coveted item in Animal Crossing: New Horizons and can only be acquired in Wild World through specific means. Most players purchase it as a special item from Tom Nook's store for 2,800 Bells, or they might receive it from Wishy the Star, though this is not guaranteed. Alternatively, players in 2006 used the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connect to receive the Master Sword as a promotional gift to celebrate the release of The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess."
