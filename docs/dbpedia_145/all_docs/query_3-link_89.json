        "text": "Highlights\n\nNintendo fans have been eagerly awaiting news about a new Animal Crossing game since the company announced there would be no further updates for Animal Crossing: New Horizons.\n\nAnimal Crossing has become one of Nintendo's beloved IPs, and with rumors of a Switch 2 on the horizon, a new Animal Crossing game may be in development.\n\nRecent leaks about the Switch 2 suggest that Nintendo is actively working on new hardware, and if the rumors are true, the console may be released in late 2024 or early 2025, potentially with a new Animal Crossing game as a marketing move.\n\nSince Nintendo announced that it would no longer make significant updates for its latest Animal Crossing game, fans have been expectantly waiting for any kind of news pertaining to the franchise. The series has become one of Nintendo's most beloved IPs, especially after Animal Crossing: New Horizons became a smash hit in 2020. Competing with the likes of The Legend of Zelda, Pokemon, and Mario is no easy task, but Animal Crossing has become home to an incredibly creative and dedicated community.\n\nAnimal Crossing debuted with its first game in 2001, and over the past two decades, the cozy life simulation games have skyrocketed in popularity. The 2017 release of the Switch, a hybrid console that could be handheld or docked at home, was one of the biggest factors to contribute to its modern success. Now, with rumors of a Switch 2 on the horizon, another Animal Crossing game could also be on its way.\n\nRELATED: The Next Animal Crossing Needs a Way to Stop Players From Breaking This Unwritten Rule\n\nA New Animal Crossing Game May Already Be In Development\n\nAccording to Nintendo's release timeline for Animal Crossing games, a new addition appears every couple of years. All the main games in the franchise are separated by a short window of three to four years, except for Animal Crossing: New Leaf and Animal Crossing: New Horizons which had an eight-year gap. However, during this period Animal Crossing: Happy Home Designer was released for the Nintendo 3DS in 2015, and Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp was made available in 2017.\n\nThough it hasn't been confirmed, recent leaks regarding a Switch 2 are suggesting that Nintendo is actively working on new hardware. The name may not be final, but if the sources are correct, then the upcoming console will be able to compete with the graphics of the PlayStation 5. Rumors have claimed that it will also have a new camera feature and an 8-inch LED screen. Some people even think that Nintendo may have already shown a glimpse of it to a few press members at the latest Gamescom 2023 showcase.\n\nWith excitement bubbling around a prospective new device from Nintendo, it's believed the Switch 2 will be released in late 2024 or early 2025. As such, there have been theories that it will debut with a few heavy-hitting titles. Some claim it'll have a Final Fantasy 7 remake as a headliner, but it's also very possible that a new Animal Crossing game is being saved for the Switch 2 launch as well. After all, this would be an incredibly smart marketing move for Nintendo after the triumphs of Animal Crossing: New Horizons.\n\nIf the information about a potential new console is accurate, it's very likely that the next Animal Crossing is already in the works. According to the developers, Animal Crossing: New Horizons took about eight years to create, from its conception to its release date. How far along the game might be can't really be determined at the moment but if Nintendo follows its previous release patterns, a new title is due around the same time as the Switch 2.\n\nUnfortunately, Nintendo itself has yet to comment on the rumors. It's already been confirmed that there won't be any new hardware before March 2024, but any date after that is fair game. It's unlikely that another Animal Crossing game will be released before the next console, though it's not impossible. With any luck, Nintendo will share something concrete soon."
