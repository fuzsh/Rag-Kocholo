        "text": "Nintendo has come a long way with its games and consoles, but one Redditor discovered just how much by comparing the Nintendo 64 and the Nintendo Switch storage capacity. The result: we now have the technology to launch every game from the classic Nintendo console on one cartridge for the Switch.\n\nThe Nintendo 64 is one of the most seminal gaming consoles in the world. It’s what a lot of gamers grew up with and started out using. The N64 was released globally throughout 1996, the successor to the NES and SNES after Nintendo started feeling the heat from SEGA. It debuted games like Animal Crossing and Super Smash Bros., and was discontinued in 2002 when the GameCube took over as Nintendo’s new go-to console. Many of the games that came out on N64 are still cult classics for gamers today, and some have even been remastered for newer gaming consoles. Now, it turns out that every N64 game could fit on the Nintendo Switch.\n\nRelated: Play New SNES Games On Switch Right Now\n\nThe Switch is, of course, the latest and greatest in Nintendo and gaming consoles. Some of its greatest hits, so far, include Animal Crossing: New Horizons and The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. The Nintendo Switch has an internal memory capacity of 32 GB, which is more than enough to hold the roughly 24.83 GB entire N64 game catalog. This calculation is thanks to Reddit user CorsairVI. Based on the fact that the typical N64 cartridge holds 64 MB, CorsairVI was able to come up with that aforementioned figure after accounting for all 388 N64 games. Some Switch games, like NBA 2K19 (31.5 GB) and NBA 2K20 (32.9 GB), require more storage space than the entirety of the N64 game list.\n\nUnfortunately, this is just a fan calculation and has nothing to do with any of Nintendo’s future plans. It’s already been a big year for the Switch, selling out everywhere and debuting one of their most successful games of all time with New Horizons, with more games on the way.\n\nCorsairVI’s calculation and the knowledge of this possibility could seriously haunt retro game fans if Nintendo doesn’t pick it up and run with it. For day one Nintendo fans, having every nostalgic favorite in one piece of plastic would be a 21st-century dream. Imagine a world where gamers can play Banjo-Kazooie, Donkey Kong 64, Majora’s Mask, and both Pokémon Stadium games, all without having to blow on a single cartridge or argue over the good controller.\n\nSource: GameRant"
