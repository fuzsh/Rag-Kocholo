        "text": "The Original Animal Crossing\n\nFor it’s time, the Animal Crossing franchise was unique and introduced a previously unseen style of game on home consoles. It has been described as a social simulator and even as a “communication game\" by Nintendo themselves. The game is open-ended, with players assuming the role of a new mayor in the town of Animal Crossing. The “aim” of the game, if there really is one, is to fulfill various tasks and goals, trying to make the town flourish and it’s residents happy. You move your character around a 3D world, but can do whatever you want, be it exploring, talking to the town's residents, catch fish or hunt bugs. Also unique for the game at the time was that the game utilised the console’s internal clock to observe days, weeks, months and years. This meant that there often tasks or goals that showed up at the same time as real-life events and holidays such as Independence Day, Halloween, the Harvest Festival (Thanksgiving), and Toy Day (Christmas). But more importantly than that, Animal Crossing was the first mainstream game to introduce us to timer mechanics in games.\n\nYou would have to play the game at specific times of the day to attend activities such as fishing tournaments and early-morning fitness classes, which occurred on a regular schedule. The game also rationed out some items and content by forcing you to wait a certain amount of time. E.g. after knocking down some fruit from a tree, you’d have to wait a couple of hours before it grew back again. And this was in an era where micro-transactions did not exist, so you would have to come back later if you wanted more items, there was no shortcut around it! So in this sense, Animal Crossing was one of the first games that encouraged you to play a couple of times every day rather than playing for one huge session, making it more appealing to families, which is Nintendo’s key demographic. The game even had a currency called Bells which functioned in a sense as a soft currency for the game.\n\nThe series also introduced the concept of social mechanics years before they found home in web, Facebook and eventually mobile games. Multiple Town instances could be stored on one cart, meaning that multiple family members could maintain their own town on a single machine. This meant you were incentivized to visit nearby towns to trade items and leave messages, and you might often have a father switch on the game to find out his daughter had visited his town and left him some items. Again perfect for families who had one machine between them but who would use it at different times of the day.\n\nWhat Nintendo had not predicted was that the game mechanics introduced in this game were a perfect fit for casual web and mobile games of the future. The game rewarded you for coming back many times a day rather than playing a longer session. You could play for very short periods of time if you wanted to, and you were incentivised to help other players and vice versa. So the fascination in playing the mobile version of Animal Crossing is to see if the old master can teach us any new tricks?\n\n“Invest and Express” games as they are sometimes known as were some of the biggest hits on mobile as free-to-play took off with titles such as The Smurfs Village, Dragonvale and Tap Paradise Cove being early successes leading to The Simpsons: Tapped Out and Hay Day in more recent times. However, these days casual hit titles have become puzzle orientated, with management style games evolving into deeper mid-core style games. In fact, at the time of writing only Hay Day (Supercell) Township (Playrix) and The Sims: FreePlay (Electronic Arts) are in the top 100 grossing games and that could be considered as part of the genre. So it seems like this is a gameplay style that is fading away and it will be interesting to see if Nintendo can be the one to return it to it’s former glories.\n\nIntroducing Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp\n\nIf you boiled down Animal Crossing to its core, it’s a management game which involves the player dealing with an ever increasing inventory and list of tasks and contacts to manage. One criticism of the console games is that this can over time start to become quite daunting and frustrating to manage. If there is one thing that the mobile version has done an especially good job on, it’s the addition of convenience features to reduce this friction for you. The map shows you which characters are where, and puts a tick next to them if you have completed their next task to help you progress. If you go to your contact book, it shows you which ones you are ready to invite, which ones you haven’t visited yet and which ones are ready to be spoken to. Once you’ve crafted all of the furniture needed to invite a new Animal to your Campsite, the game opens up a popup and gives you the option to do it immediately. On console these sort of features might make it feel too automated, but it’s perfect on mobile for short and rewarding session lengths.\n\nAn element that mobile games have improved upon compared to the original Animal Crossing games, are their forays and experiments with social dynamics. Hay Day is one of the best games for this with it’s innovative peer-to-peer marketplace, it’s Neighborhood system and social based events and goals. Animal Crossing is ripe for very similar mechanics, but has a big issue that needs to be addressed - Nintendo’s conservative approach with allowing player to player communication in their games. Noticeable in all Nintendo products on mobile is that players cannot freely speak to one another using their platform, likely due to wanting to avoid any sort of situation with predatory behavior on the young and vulnerable that could cause huge damage to their brand. The result is a sandboxed approach where social features and elements exist, but in a safe manner that gives the feeling of working together without the possibility of direct communication.\n\nOccasionally you’ll find other Campers in your game who you can visit and trade items with. Quite how these people are selected is a mystery, but it’s useful and makes the game feel more alive. Sadly the system isn’t as good as the marketplace system introduced by Hay Day that allows you to search for specific items or browse a variety of strangers goods to get what you want. In fact, the system is so successful that it is replicated by pretty much every mobile “invest and express” game, such as Playrix’ Township, Zynga’s Farmvilles and King’s Paradise Bay. There are currently far fewer items that you need to progress in Animal Crossing, but it would be a definite improvement to the game if added.\n\nIt’s also possible to add your real friends via either their Nintendo ID or by connecting your game to Facebook and sending requests that way. This is a somewhat unexpected move by Nintendo as it’s more open than their other games. The option is exactly front and center, but it allows a player to create their own friends list in their game using their real life social networks if they connect with them.\n\nThere is also an area in the game called the Shovelstrike Quarry where players can dig for the rarest materials needed to make the most desirable items in the game. To enter the area, a player need to recruit 5 friends or spend some of their leaf tickets. Thus the game has a very limited mechanism for getting players to keep others invested in the game, and to have common goals to work towards.\n\nOverall the social mechanics in the game are extremely limited for a game of this type. There are no leaderboards, alliances, chat or alliance events which are common in rival products. Currently there are no events as part of a live-operations campaign, but these were introduced to both Mario Run and Fire Emblem Heroes, so I’d expect them to arrive in due course, especially around the Christmas holiday period. Despite this lack of features, I predict that Animal Crossing will make a lot of money for Nintendo because of its brand and reputation alone. However, a lack of proven features that drive retention could be a reason why Animal Crossing trails off in January 2018, much like how Super Mario Run faded from a very strong start.\n\nMonetisation\n\nAnimal Crossing is about as straightforward as you can get for a free to play game in terms of monetization, using impatience as it’s key friction point to spend. Many actions in the game have an appointment timer that can be skipped by either using Hard Currency or using an item which in return can be purchased with Hard Currency. For example, if you complete all requests for the day from all Animals, you can use a request ticket to get something else to do. Or if you need to collect fruit from a tree, you can use fertilizer to hurry the tree and collect more fruit. There is no Gacha or paying to become more powerful. Quite simply, you can do everything in the game for free but are gated by time, or you can spend money to speed this process up and progress at a faster rate.\n\nContinuing along the impatience route, you start the game being able to craft just one item in the furniture shop, which acts as a big barrier as items take time to craft. As you progress through the game, Animal requests become more and more needy in terms of items they want you to get, slowing your progress down enormously. You can purchase up to additional slots, which feels like the builder purchase in Clash of Clans, in that it’s a permanent bonus that feels super useful to have and good value for money, even if the economy is likely modeled around having all 3 slots available anyway.\n\nFinally the game also offers Premium Decorations, in the same way that every Invest and Express game since the dawn of time does. Purchasing these items has an additional bonus as not only do they make your Camp look cool, but it means that you can get special visitors such as K.K. and Tom Nook. And of course when other players come to visit you they are likely to be envious, impressed and more likely to give you Kudos for having such items. The player does earn Premium Currency organically through playing the game, but the drip is controlled in such a way that you’ll won’t have enough to get everything you really want.\n\nA Delightful Yet Poorly Monetizing Single Player Game\n\nIn terms of game design, Animal Crossing is extremely dated. There are in fact no new features either from a systems, social or monetization perspective that are new in this title that could be applied to other products. But then again, there doesn’t really need to be. Nintendo games make for an interesting case study because there are numerous areas in all of their games that could easily be optimized to improve their performance in terms of retention and revenues, but that’s never really been their primary goal for any of their games. Nintendo wants you to buy their hardware so mobile games should be enjoyable, but light enough to want players to want more from the Nintendo hardware versions."
