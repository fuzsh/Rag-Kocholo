        "text": "Nintendo Switch owners finally got what they’ve been wanting ever since the launch. Nintendo agreed to make its way into the modern era and added Bluetooth connectivity to its device. Talking of new features, leakers might just have revealed information about one of the biggest upcoming updates.\n\nAlthough officials are yet to confirm GameBoy games’ arrival to their platform, insiders have hinted that Nintendo 64 might be on its way to Switch. If we know anything from previous leaks, this could be huge for the platform that continues to dominate the market.\n\nNintendo Switch: What would Nintendo 64’s arrival bring to the table?\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nThe developers recently added the third edition of the Colors Live series and has already taken Switch by storm. The game also offers a physical copy of the title which looks more appealing since it comes with a SonarPen making players’ lives easier. Following its release will probably be the GameBoy Library, which in turn will set the path for N64’s release.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nAlso Read: Assassin’s Creed Valhalla Is Finally Getting a Viking Age Tour This October\n\nEarlier today (September 15, 2021), Nintendo dedicated channel “Nate the Hate” in a video claimed that the Nintendo 64 library might soon come to Switch. He said, “One of the platforms that will be coming to the Nintendo Switch Online in the future is the revolutionary Nintendo 64.”\n\nThe games will be another lot of exclusive additions; so it is expected the devs will not be giving them out for free. Interestingly, according to Nate, they will not be a part of the standard NSO $3.99 per month subscription as well. Instead, the devs will reportedly add another tier to the subscription service. Since the success of Super Mario 3D All-Stars exceeded the devs expectations, it is only natural they use the same model for the rest of the N64 games. The sales proved players are willing to spend a few extra bucks; if it means they get to play their favorite childhood titles again.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nAt this rate, things are looking really promising for the Nintendo Switch. If the officials confirm any of the rumors parallel to Switch OLED’s release next month, it would make the community go wild."
