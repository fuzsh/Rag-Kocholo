        "text": "Mar 7, 2021\n\n#1\n\nThe N64 is one of Nintendo's most divisive consoles currently, since it has some great strenghts but also big weaknesses, one of them was the massive lack of japanese third party support, the western one was decent, but in Japan most of the companies that gave the NES, SNES and kept giving the Game Boy great games mostly or completely ignored the console, with the exception of Hudson and kind of Konami, and that resulted on the console having a horrible library of JRPG's, Adventure games, Fighting games or Shoot em Ups, which were among the most popular genres in Japan and resulted on the console selling way less copies than the Super Famicom, in fact a huge part of the lost sales from the SNES to the N64 were from Japan only. However even with all those problems the console didn't sell terribly in Japan, with over 5 million units and many of the games by Nintendo or Rare sold pretty well there, which for a console that had so little software appealing for Japanese players (probably even less than the OG Xbox) is surprising, it even sold far more than the Gamecube there which did have more games appealing for them. Probably having exclusive Pokémon games helped at the time\n\nI have seen some threads here asking about things like this and some people seem to know a lot about how japanese players feel about some things (I wouldn't be asking if that wasn't the case), and I would really like to know if people in Japan hate it or consider it an ok console\n\nLast edited: Mar 8, 2021\n\nWhoaIsThatMars\n\nOct 25, 2017\n\n2,600\n\n湘南\n\nMar 7, 2021\n\n#2\n\nObviously, I can't speak for the entire population.

Was pretty fun.\n\nZSaberLink\n\nOct 26, 2017\n\n1,703\n\nMar 8, 2021\n\n#31\n\nThe N64 is one of Nintendo's most divisive consoles currently, since it has some great strenghts but also big weaknesses, one of them was the massive lack of japanese third party support, the western one was decent, but in Japan most of the companies that gave the NES, SNES and kept giving the Game Boy great games mostly or completely ignored the console, with the exception of Hudson and kind of Konami, and that resulted on the console having a horrible library of JRPG's, Adventure games, Fighting games or Shoot em Ups, which were among the most popular genres in Japan and resulted on the console selling way less copies than the Super Famicom, in fact a huge part of the lost sales from the SNES to the N64 were from Japan only. However even with all those problems the console didn't sell terribly in Japan, with over 5 million units and many of the games by Nintendo or Rare sold pretty well there, which for a console that had so little software appealing for Japanese players (probably even less than the OG Xbox) is surprising, it even sold far more than the Gamecube there which did have more games appealing for them. Probably having exclusive Pokémon games helped at the time\n\nI have seen some threads here asking about things like this and some people seem to know a lot about how japanese players feel about some things (I wouldn't be asking if that wasn't the case), and I would really like to know if people in Japan hate it or consider it an ok console\n\nI can't speak to the perception in Japan, but some stats.\n\nN64 sold 5.5M, GameCube sold 4M, and the Wii U sold 3.3M units. N64's strength in sales really came from the US where while it was outsold by PlayStation it still sold pretty well.\n\nAmirMoosavi\n\nDec 10, 2018\n\n2,077\n\nMar 8, 2021\n\n#32\n\nFunny enough DOA1 almost came to N64 via Acclaim. In the end the deal fell through (as did an almost completed Acclaim deal for, believe it or not, VF3 on N64 and PS2) but I think it could've been cool to see how a port fared.\n\nWhoa, really? Never heard of this before, this is all I could find:\n\nTecmo's Fighter: Dead Or Alive on N64? - IGN\n\nCall it a rumor (but it's not), or call it lots of people saying the…\n\nMar 8, 2021\n\n#33\n\nWasn't Grandia a million seller too?\n\nnope. close to 350k, which, back then, is pretty good. Sakura Taisen 1 needed to sell 200k for it to be considered a massive sales success and it sold just a hair better than Grandia.\n\non topic: you look at the highest selling games in Japan from this time frame-- RPGs and Fighting games-- and the N64 has very little representation from those genres-- two genres the Playstation 1 and Saturn absolutely murder in. it's not really any surprise it sold even less than the Saturn in Japan, considering the popularity of Virtua Fighter, Darkstalkers and Sakura Wars back in the mid-to-late 90s.\n\nLast edited: Mar 8, 2021\n\nMar 8, 2021\n\n#34\n\nThis poll [Google translated] from last month shows the most popular games for N64 ranked by Japanese players, and also has comments from them on each.

The N64 was their first home console that basically needed their first-party software, since the third-party output was pretty pathetic. If players ranked the top 5 NES or SNES games, you'd probably at least one or two third-party titles.\n\nHOTSPUR\n\nOct 25, 2017\n\n1,887\n\nMar 8, 2021\n\n#37\n\nI'm 100% buying and modding a Japanese N64 this year.

If an enthusiast buys the PS1, then I can say it was because of the games. But what I mean with my original comment is that ordinary people (especially in those days) didn't look much at the games. It was mostly about the perception of the console and its games. The N64 was seen as kiddy and the PS1 was the cool console from the music company. Quality games do make a difference but they don't make as much of a difference as the enthusiast gaming community believes.\n\nSanctuary\n\nOct 27, 2017\n\n15,339\n\nMar 9, 2021\n\n#48\n\nThe CD thing was obviously a problem for the JRPGs, but I don't know why the fighting games and shoot-em-ups couldn't have come out on N64.\n\n*cough*\n\nWhat we ended up with instead was a pretty shitty version of the game on the SNES.
