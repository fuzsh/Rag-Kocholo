        "text": "For me...\n\n1) Animal Crossing (GCN)\n\n2) New Leaf\n\n3) City Folk\n\n4) Happy Home Designer\n\n5) Wild World\n\n6,000) amiibo Festival\n\nAnimal Crossing GCN is, and still remains even today, my favorite in the series for nailing the overall simplicity and its overall forest vibe making exploring your village an adventure in itself. Sure, the later entries improved upon its many mechanics, but in this case simplicity goes a long way. I really miss the forest vibe that this game had that the later games lacked for me. New Horizons might have something to say about it being my new favorite game, though.\n\nNew Leaf is otherwise my definitive pick if I were to rank the series based on its improvements, especially with the Welcome amiibo update that made a HUGE difference compared to the still-amazing base version. It's even the first portable Animal Crossing game that actually impressed me.\n\nCity Folk may have been underwhelming in some areas, but I still enjoyed it for giving me the Animal Crossing game I've been craving for that Wild World never gave to me. I finally have my own house (as well as my basement returning), maxing out Nook's shop no longer forced you to buddy up with somebody (at the time, I could not find somebody to shop in my shop on Wild World), etc. I did not regret playing this at all.\n\nHappy Home Designer isn't an \"Animal Crossing\" game, but like City Folk I still enjoyed it for what it was. I do like how some of its mechanics made its way back to New Leaf with the Welcome amiibo update (and soon, New Horizons).\n\nA portable Animal Crossing experience is something I wanted since the GCN game and I was happy to see Nintendo fulfill that dream for me back then. Unfortunately, Wild World was not the Animal Crossing experience I wanted as on top of many of the mainstay elements being too absurdly watered-down (many holidays cut, no land levels, no island, no basement, etc. etc. etc. etc.), the top screen only displaying the sky has so little use (while keeping all the action at the bottom for whatever reason outside of tapping on animals to wave at them) that it feels needless; if anything, the touch screen should be used for map and inventory management. Sure, the lack of grass erosion is nice and the Message in a Bottle is neat (though no idea why it hasn't returned in New Leaf), but what good is it for me to gaining the benefit of portability when I'm basically given a $35 tech demo? I would compare this to Super Mario Land on Game Boy in contrast to the much superior Super Mario Bros on NES, but the difference with the former is that I still had a semblance of fun and gotten the most (if not whole) Mario experience out of it, thus I could play it again and again if I wanted. This is the only Animal Crossing game that I had no regrets for trading-in to my local GameStop. I was so disappointed...\n\namiibo Festival is a bad game, yes, but as Gavin Lane said the game did good in pioneering the amiibo line for the series as a whole. At least I rented this one...\n\nPocket Camp is...a neat game for what it is, but it's not on my list since I haven't played enough of it to rank it. Then again, with New Horizons on the way, I probably won't at all...\n\nHaven't played the spin-offs (minus a few minutes of Pocket Camp and never booted it up again), so here's what I think.\n\n4. City Folk: My least-played Animal Crossing. I have almost no distinct memories with this one, because I stopped playing it within a month or two. It doesn't help that I played the original and Wild World in 2007, so this was coming only a year after that. In a vacuum, City Folk is at least as good as Wild World and maybe even the original. But it didn't offer enough new things, and introduced the dreaded grass deterioration. It's the black sheep of the main series it seems, despite being released on the crazy popular Wii.\n\n3. Wild World: Despite losing many features of the original, it added a ton as well. I'm sure it hasn't aged the best, but I remember it being great. I don't think we'd have Animal Crossing as a phenomenon without this title.\n\n2. Animal Crossing: This one has aged so well, especially considering the N64 graphics. I go back to it at least every few years and I adore the atmosphere. This was my first Animal Crossing, and a very strong start for the series.\n\n1. New Leaf: My most-played game of all-time. A masterpiece full of old and new, and brought the series to new heights.\n\nNew Horizons: I didn't number it because I don't think I can be completely fair until I've paid off most of my house, experienced some holidays, have 10 villagers, more seasons, etc. My first impressions are that it's probably the best. Despite only having 8 new villagers and removing a lot of past special characters and cool new features from New Leaf, it's mostly amazing."
