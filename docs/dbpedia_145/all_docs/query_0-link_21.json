        "text": "It's hard to argue that Animal Crossing has changed all that much since its original Nintendo 64 version. If the rise of connected play and high definition graphics hasn't changed Animal Crossing all that much, does Nintendo's next console stand any chance of making a difference?\n\nActually, if the rumors about Project Cafe are true, the Wii's successor could be the hardware platform that Animal Crossing was made for.\n\nTo start with, consider this: the console versions of Animal Crossing have never supported local multiplayer. Sure, the Wii and DS versions supported multi-player, but never between two players in the same town. Local multiplayer has always been a big deal for Nintendo, from the Nintendo 64's four controller slots to the way that Wii Sports is always shown with a group of people playing together. Given that, it's strange to think that if my brother and I wanted to be neighbors in the same town, we would always have to take turns. At GDC 2007, Shigeru Miyamoto talked about how his wife would write letters to their kids in Animal Crossing, but he conveniently glossed over the topic that she never actually played the game with them at the same time.\n\nIf it's true that Project Cafe will feature controllers that have individual screens which can display gameplay, then that last wall between neighbors in Animal Crossing can finally fall. Someone can already be playing the game, and their roommate or kid brother or parent could pick up a tablet-controller and jump right into the game. Each player would get their own gameplay streamed to their controller display independently, meaning they could impact each other as little as they want, or take the effort to coordinate their efforts in a new town competition or holiday event. And when one player is done for the day, they can simply \"log off\" with no impact on the other player at all.\n\nOn the GameCube, my brother and I always played out our wars, town rivalries, and practical jokes in proxy, with delayed results and using our neighbors as secret intermediaries. With a Project Cafe version, I could finally simply log on, pick up an axe, and give real-time chase to my neighbor-stealing, serpent-tongued, trickster of a younger brother.\n\nOr I could just write him another nasty letter. Writing letters to neighbors, virtual or otherwise, has always been a huge part of what made the Animal Crossing games unique, but the interface of a controller has always been horrible for that purpose. It would often take an extremely long time to type out a short, three sentence letter with the GameCube controller, and recently the only decent solution for console play is to buy an external keyboard accessory.\n\nIf the screens on Cafe's controllers accept touch input, then that entire interface nightmare can go away. Other things would benefit greatly as well, such as the text chat system when in multiplayer, managing player inventory, and even designing the custom clothing patterns Animal Crossing let's players work on at the Able Sister's store. The DS version of Animal Crossing already showed how this could be done, and Project Cafe could bring those improvements to the home console.\n\nThere are some parts of Animal Crossing that hasn't changed much since the first Nintendo 64 version. It may be that Nintendo's still waiting for other parts of the game to finally reach their full potential. I hope that the Project Cafe can do that, as well as introduce other unforeseen innovations to propel Nintendo's local social country-village sim. I really do need to get my brother back for making me think there was a Happy Town Academy and that I had to clean up all the items I'd dumped out on my lawn for storage.\n\nA very Cinematic Devil May Cry Style game with a little bit of Character indication that something is wrong but the Hud moved to the controller making for a very Cinimatic presentation If I could play WoW without the Hud I would but I'm not that good.\n\nSuper Duper Scribblenauts.\n\nA versus Puzzle game where each person has a puzzle on their respective screen that manipulates their vs entity on the main screen.\n\nAll the GBA Connection Games.\n\nA platformer that you played on the big screen but the little screen would have bubbles you had to pop, or something similar, before it leaves your little screen and effects the big screen characters. Later on some of those will be good and needed, making it hectic.\n\nA Good RTS, Though for Kicks and giggles StarCraft2\n\nElite Beat Agents Super Awesome Extended Cafe Edition :D\n\nSimon Says, Dut. Dut Dot. Dut Dot Dut. Dut Dot Dut Dop. Dut Dot Dut Dop Dop.\n\nMario Party Mini Game Vs.\n\nPokemon Stadium. Literally, Pokemon Stadium.\n\nGauntlet.\n\nWarioware minigame game.\n\nYou know if it has motion sensing and knows where the TV is than a game where you can bring the screen up like your looking through it and it acts as a detector of sort, like an Xray or MMR.\n\nA Dora game that is an exact reproduction of the episodes because, Dora is really a TV Show about a PC Game. So the three items show up on the big and little screen. Where you need to point. You could do the voice interaction through a microphone. It be a solid game for kids.\n\nElite Beat Agents.. Oh wait.\n\nSuper Mario Time Trials. This would be a versus games that takes levels from Super Mario Bros. 1, 2, 3, Land and pits players in speed runs agains each other. The big Screen would be used to do an announcer style cut to each of the competitors as its going and verbally mentioning how well the players are doing. Also have stats etc. The players themselves would be playing through the level on their own screen. At the end of a round the winner would be declared on the screens and the big screen would show \"ghosts\" of each player running through the level.\n\nAnd RPG with Mini-game style combat, think Mario RPG, done on the touch screen for special attacks etc. Be turn base but allow for people to jump in and take extra characters to move battles faster. So with 4 players everyone would control and do the minigames for a character. With 2 then each person be responsible for 2 characters. Then with one obviously they be doing each of the characters each turn and their mini-games.\n\nA racing game with a Hot Potato type Mechanic. So you be racing like F-Zero with friends but you need too keep this ball that shows up on your screen in play between each other or it will weigh down maybe damage your racer.\n\nA gaming feature a Goo based main character which you can shape on your controller to get through different obstacles as you go on the fly.\n\nAngry Bird Vs. It be Angry Birds with a versus mode where each player get a puzzle on their screen. :P: :\n\nI'm going to stop there.\n\nLOL, I thought you were asking for concepts well. You got them anyway.\n\nIt was my mistake for not mentioning Star Fox. It's also something I've wanted to have on Wii, especially since we got one on DS (it actually got me excited to have a console version).\n\nGoing back in time, it seems that the SNES (Outside Japan) and Virtua Boy were the only Nintendo consoles to not see at least two Zelda games specifically developed for it (not counting games ported to it). There's also the CD-i (which saw multiple games, but I'm only focusing on Nintendo Consoles).\n\nNES\n\n- Legend of Zelda\n\n- Adventures of Link: Zelda II\n\nSuper NES\n\n-A Link to the Past\n\nGame Boy/Color\n\n-Link's Awakening\n\n-Oracle of Seasons\n\n-Oracle of Ages\n\nNintendo 64\n\n-Ocarina of Time\n\n-Majora's Mask\n\nGame Boy Advance\n\n-The Minish Cap\n\n-Four Swords\n\nGamecube\n\n-The Wind Waker\n\n-Four Swords Adventures\n\n-Twilight Princess\n\nNintendo DS\n\n-Phantom Hourglass\n\n-Spirit Tracks\n\nWii\n\n-Link's Crossbow Training\n\n-.................(that's it so far)\n\nWe don't really know for sure if Skyward Sword will ever make it.\n\nLooking at F-Zero, you can see that there's been one on every home console since its birth:\n\nSuper NES\n\n-F-Zero\n\nNintendo 64\n\n-F-Zero X\n\nGame Boy Advance\n\n-F-Zero: Maximum Velocity\n\n-F-Zero: GP Legend\n\nGamecube\n\n-F-Zero GX\n\nWii\n\n-................(*sigh*)\n\nFor Star Fox:\n\nSuper NES\n\n-Star Fox\n\n-Star Fox 2 (Cancelled, but at least it was being made.

They make up most of what gamers want from Nintendo, which is why the Wii doesn't look so good for many of us. When 3rd Party support is weak, what else do you turn to, but the Xbox360 and/or PS3. Still, in my opinion, the Wii is certainly one of my least favorite Nintendo consoles when it comes down to just Nintendo games.\n\nCan you understand how disappointed I am? Five years later, the Wii is missing a lot of game franchises.\n\nQuote:\n\nThis is something I am really truly relieved to hear. Of course, its still just a rumor at this point, but even being a rumor that's still reassuring. I have been very nervous that Nintendo was going to go with the Classic Controller layout and make that permanent. If they return to the GC controller layout that would be awesome.\n\nThe Gamecube layout is useless for fighting games. It's a setup that sounds neat in theory but doesn't really provide much of an advantage and it doesn't work well for some games. The diamond setup for face buttons is the standard so most games will be made for it. It doesn't matter if it's not an ideal setup. QWERTY is not the ideal setup for keyboards but it's the standard so you follow it or your \"better\" keyboard is borderline useless.\n\nAnd the thing is Nintendo invented that button setup in the first place so it isn't like they stole it from Sony. I see the CC not as a Dualshock knock-off but more like Nintendo going back to the standard they invented in the first place. And it has been the standard for a reason - it is very flexible. Yes, some other controller layouts might work better for SOME games but then they also don't work well for other games. But the CC design works well for pretty much everything. It is not always the best but it never really outright sucks either. A controller has to be generic enough to work with a lot of different ideas. The Gamecube controller worked well for games designed specifically for it and like complete balls for everything else. Due to the wide variety of genres and control schemes out there a generic design is a safer bet.\n\nFour Swords is an obvious but very awesome idea. It is one of the best Gamecube games. The only problem is that the hardware requirements for it are insane. Online play should be an option and I like the idea of also including the original game. Why not since few got to play it? Though it seems more Nintendo like to just re-release the Cube game instead of including it as a bonus with a new one. I would only bother with a new one.\n\n-I'd like to play old Virtual Console games online, like what was done on Xbox Arcade and Playstation Network (the Wii REALLY missed out on these).\n\n-With Skype, it'd be nice to call any person on your friend network, even if they're playing a different game. Skype is on PS3, PSP, and now Microsoft will probably use it for their systems, leaving Nintendo out again, if they don't include it (if Sony doesn't stop supporting it).\n\n-I do think that the Gamecube controller design needs to die. It doesn't work to well with too many games, especially games that relies on precision controlling with the D-Pad, like fighters and most other 2D games. Ever play Metal Slug Anthology on Wii? Unless you have the Japanese version, there's no D-Pad support for Gamecube controllers or Classic Controller support at all, which kinda hurts it. Oh, and personally, I don't like using joysticks for fighters.\n\nGamecube's shoulder buttons are also very bad. The extra click was hardly used, even by Nintendo, and the Z button is out of place.\n\nGamecube's 4 face buttons' placement and shapes only made some games harder to play. I was happy to see it not used for the Classic Controller's design, and I don't want it to return for the Cafe's controller.\n\n-More programs on the Nintendo Channel, along with Nintendo Week. Expand.\n\n-Online games with drop in/drop out play with an invitation system.\n\n-ALL GAMES WITH STANDARD CONTROLLER SUPPORT (this is more of a developer thing). There wouldn't be much of a problem with games like Virtua Tennis 4 if the main controller packed in with the system was the Classic Controller instead of just the Wiimote/Nunchuck.\n\nQuote from: famicomplicated\n\nNice concept Bman, although do you think they'll use wires again?\n\nI personally hope for completely wire free, plus a dock to charge everything as part of the console's design.\n\nI expect a wired connection for the same reason iPods still use wired headphones-- there's not enough reason to justify the need of the extra batteries a connection that's only a few feet apart would require-- not to mention the extra hassle of keeping track of the multiple parts. A wireless connection for a controller to a console is one thing, but where's the benefit or practicability of wirelessly connecting something only as far as the distance between your right and left hands? I know some third parties have had some success with wireless Nunchuks because it's sellable as a gimmick. As far as logistics go though, it's just not practical as a standard design. Sure, the wire design on the current Wii Nunchuk definitely is flawed since it hangs down and gets in the way. But if you take a closer look at my design you'll see I addressed that issue by giving the wire a phone-style coiling design. The new wire design solves that issue, so making it wireless would just be overkill in my opinion.\n\nBut I do agree with you that some of dock for recharging batteries built-in to the controllers is a good bet. Especially since the extra weight the use of AAs added was a large part of what let to \"flying Remote\" issue that gave Nintendo so many headaches for the Wii. Since Nintendo already included a charging dock with the 3DS, I'm going to say something similar for Cafe's controllers is nearly certain.\n\nAfter playing along with the Retroactive of Perfect Dark it got me thinking about the evolution of Nintendo consoles and the way that they play first person shooters. Although Nintendo often seems to leave the FPS genre behind compared to its highly prized platforming Mario titles and other first party games, when you look at the evolution of first person shooters on Nintendo consoles, it has always been innovative. Although this is not to say it has always been the best as I was told the N64 used an interesting setup of strafing and aiming using the one analog stick and C-buttons. I can only shudder at the thought of how difficult that must have been. But this was changed again with the Gamecube and for this example I'll use the Metroid titles which used a system of movement with the control stick then aiming while you held down the left trigger. Although this wasn't much better then what I presume using the N64 setup would have been like, it was different. Change was implemented again with the introduction of the Wii, which offered an amazing system of the current point-and-click aiming. This system works wonderfully and it's sad to see that Nintendo hasn't really pushed the genre to compete with the more popular FPS games such as Halo and Call of Duty on the other platforms. On a side note, although it is not a main console, the DS also offered unique controls with the touchpad such as with Metroid Hunters, which also performed well and was fun to play. Again, also very little support from Nintendo to continue the FPS genre on the DS. From all of this my point is to come to the next Nintendo system: Project Cafe. Perhaps I'm missing something but the controller really does not seem to be very innovative as far as I can tell. Placing a DS on a remote is far from unique, why not just play the system with multiple DS systems then? Does anyone have any speculations on how Nintendo might use the new controller to create a unique and different way to play first person shooters, or do you think they might just fall in line with the Xbox 360 and PS3 and just use a dual analog control with some touch screen usage?\n\nJust throwing out my thoughts but in the end I suppose we'll have to wait for the release at E3 to truly know how things will turn out.\n\n$80 for a controller is reasonable considering controllers now cost $50, and in the case of the Wiimote plus chuck you have to spend an extra $20 for the nunchuck so on the Wii you are spending $70 per controller (and that doesn't include other peripherals such as a wheel, zapper, classic controller, etc). We are also living in an era where games cost $60, so for just $20 more than what you'd spend on a game you might beat in a week you can buy a controller which is good for the entire lifespan of the console and beyond. So I don't think its unreasonable to spend $80 especially considering all the hardware the Cafe controller is alleged to come packed with (touch screen, IR, camera, etc.)\n\nAlso, if you can use it as a universal remote for every TV and entertainment device you own then it would also be worth it for that reason alone.\n\nETA: An $80 Cafe controller which streams content is a far more economical prospect than the GCN-GBA connectivity scheme. For one thing, didn't the GBA handheld cost more than $80? On top of that, you had to buy a GBA Cartridge for each and every GBA which was where it really got expensive and absurd. You also needed link cables for each GBA to link up to the GCN.\n\nSince the Cafe is wireless there is no need for link cables, and since content is streamed back and forth there is no need to own multiple versions of the same game in order for 2-4 or more players to all get in on the action. With the Cafe each player only needs their own controller, and that's it... period.\n\nQuote from: Bman87301\n\nAll these game ideas all seem to be based around concepts using multiple touch-screen controllers at once and rectifying the failed GBA to GCN connectivity idea. Maybe I'm missing something, but if getting multiple GBAs together was too pricey to succeed, then where's the logic of assuming an additional controller that has a built-in screen, full set of buttons buttons, and streaming capabilities would be all that more economical? The absolute cheapest I could possibly picture a device like that costing is $80... and again, that's the absolute cheapest-- meaning it would most likely be even higher. I don't understand how anyone could reasonably expect it to be commonplace for people to have multiple of these to play in unison together. I'd only expect one for each system, therefore none of these ideas could possibly work. Unless I'm missing something to your logic...\n\nLet's put it like this. The cost of a GBA was $89.99 and the link cable was $5 I think. So $94.99. Now imagine its 2004 and you need to spend $95 to play Four Swords how its meant to be played per person. Now lets looks at inflation. That $94.99 would be $108.71 per person now.\n\nTake in the fact that you could only use this for a handful of games (Hi! Motion Plus, Wii Board, CC, CC Pro, etc) and to get a whole party together you spend $380 on additional tech to your Gamecube, though realistically everyone should have had a GBA... Now what if instead those 4 other controllers where the Actual game controllers? You'll probably won't more of them anyways. Not to mention as I've said before the cost of all their talking about has gone down dramatically since just last year. Nintendo doesn't have to use the uber screen or anything. Shoot they could use the original DS Phat pretty much everything.\n\nThough in the end the biggest thing this proves is that Current controllers are really a ripoff now.\n\nI still say you're kidding yourselves if you think this is going to be the standard controller used for multiplayer. Wii was by far the most profitable system this generation, so they're not going to abandon the Wii remote-styled wand controls. You're looking at it from a gamer's perspective, which Nintendo already proved with the Wii's success that focusing primarily on gamers is not where the profit is. Sure, Nintendo wants to draw the gamers back as well, but there's no point in doing that if they lose the casual crowd in the process. Since non-gamers would never pay $80-100 for a controller (especially if the console itself is $300+, which it most certainly will be), you can't expect games to be designed around that model-- especially if those games are part of franchises that would appeal to that crowd (Mario Kart, Animal Crossing).\n\nAs gamers, we look down on the casual crowd and want to believe casual gaming is just a fad that Nintendo will eventually abandon, but it's not realistic. If you stop to look at it from Nintendo perspective, as I believe I have, you get a very different view. And I'm picturing a completely different strategy, and so far if this Nikkei story is to believed, I'm right on the money so far-- as my original ideas described in my entry for the check list contest matches up extremely close (and I posted my entry before the story broke). So, I'm pretty confident in my view on this.\n\nQuote from: Chozo\n\nIts going to be the standard controller period. So of course its going to be the standard controller for multiplayer. I'm sure the wiimote will be compatible with the Cafe mainly for backwards compatibility purposes, but the main controller is going to be whatever comes bundled with the console.\n\nWho says this touch screen thing is going to be the only input device included in the box? How do you know it's not going to come bundled with a new type of remote as well as this touch screen device? You don't.\n\nNeed I remind you that the touch-screen and dual analog controls weren't the only details that initially leaked about this system. Pretty consistent reports suggesting Wii-style motion controls were out there too that would use a new tracking system? This info largely seems to have gotten glossed over by the gaming press who've instead been focusing on the touch screen idea, but it was still out there and shouldn't be ignored. Since it seems unlikely that both a 6\" touch screen and a Wii-styled motion pointer (which pointer tracking pretty much guarantees) could be part of the same device, it's fairly reasonable to guess that there's more than one controller with this system.\n\nHeck, I could easily picture two SKUs of the system-- a higher ended one meant for gamers that comes with a motion controller, the touch screen controller, and an HMDI cable. As well as a lower ended one that has the motion controller only, component cables, and bundled with a Wii Sports-type casual game. I'm fairly convinced that this touch screen \"controller\" will come standard with the system (at least in an SKU designed for gamers), and can be used as a controller, but that won't necessarily be its only purpose, or even its primary one.\n\nAssuming it will be \"the standard controller period\" is foolhardy since we haven't gotten any real solid information to determine if this even the only controller. You ought to keep an open mind and not automatically assume you know all the answers before anything has even been revealed.\n\nEdited--- Text wall fixed, happy now?\n\nActually there weren't any rumors about a new remote that I remember. But there was a rumor that it would have better motion sensing than Move\n\nDev Kits out for Months - Better Motion than Move\n\nQuote:\n\nThey have also claimed that the system retains motion control, with capabilities that are ‚Äúbetter than Move‚Äù, meaning that they boast higher fidelity. We do not yet have word on whether or not its motion-controlled solution introduces a camera.\n\nThere have also been rumors that the system is fully BC which means it supports Wiimotes which means there is some IR somewhere included with the system (supposedly on the controller)\n\nNow you could assume that Nintendo would have a Wiimote2.0 packed in the box, and they might, but it would also be kinda silly to assume that the big screened controller that will definitely be the center point of the console will not be the main controller... but I still hold out hope for a Wiimote/chuck 2.0 as an alternative and cheaper control method, especially for multi-player?\n\nWhy couldn't you get a Caf√© controller with dock and a Wiimote 2.0 in the box? It sounds like a great idea to me. We all know that there has got to be a pretty hefty mark-up on Wiimotes after 200million of them have been sold, so it would probably cost Nintendo next to nothing to throw one in the box. and if the system does cost between $350 and $400, it's perfectly possibly that Nintendo would pack the controllers in the box at cost and make up the difference at retail with $40 Wiimote 2.0's and $70 Caf√© controllers\n\nedit: Bman87301\n\ncan we avoid the walls of text please. It's easier to read with line breaks and parapraphs and whatnot.\n\nQuote from: BlackNMild2k1\n\nNow you could assume that Nintendo would have a Wiimote2.0 packed in the box, and they might, but it would also be kinda silly to assume that the big screened controller that will definitely be the center point of the console will not be the main controller... but I still hold out hope for a Wiimote/chuck 2.0 as an alternative and cheaper control method, especially for multi-player?\n\nWhy couldn't you get a Caf√© controller with dock and a Wiimote 2.0 in the box?

This is exactly the kind of thinking I'm talking about-- You're thinking inside the box. Who says 'there can only be one real controller'? The DS uses SNES-style buttons and a touch screen, does that make the buttons any less of a DS aspect? No, SNES-styled buttons worked in the past so they reused them alongside a new touch screen, both of which make up a DS. As gamers, we're used to being in a bubble cut off from the general public, but Nintendo popped that bubble with the Wii. As a result, we need to start learning to look at gaming reports without our 'geek goggles' still on.\n\nLooking at Wii-styled controls through our 'geek goggles', they may appear to be something obsolete that Nintendo needs to replace since Wii failed to become the console of choice for gamers. The problem with that thinking is that gamers are just a niche portion of the market as a whole. Wii was the choice console to the mass market-- therefore motion controls were a success, not a failure. So, which is the most logical move on Nintendo's part? Replace the motion controls or add something new in addition to them?\n\nEven though Wii might not have been the most played console among gamers, most gamers still owned one. Gamers and non-gamers alike both bought Wiis. The way I see it, it wasn't that gamers weren't willing to embrace the motion controls, it's just that 3rd party developers weren't because it took too much extra work to accommodate the special controls. As a result, all the good non-Nintendo-published gamer-centric games went to the consoles that used traditional controls, and the gamers simply followed the games. So my thinking is that Nintendo's solution to the problem will be to also include something in the box that can act as more traditional controller so developers have no more excuses. Especially if it also serves another more primary purpose...\n\nWhat kind of games were most successful on the Wii? I think most would agree local multiplayer party games. Which makes sense when you consider that gathering multiple people for short play sessions is far more practical use for a big TV than a single person sitting in front of it to play an epic adventure for 20+ hours. As far as practicality goes, a long-single player game is best suited for a portable system... but most gamers prefer playing those games with the latest graphics technology which is only available in console form. But... if you had technology that could let you stream content to another device which could coincidentally function as its own controller as well, you'd be hitting two birds with one stone.\n\nThat's what I believe is the main purpose of the touchscreen controller really is. Since local multiplayer works best with Wii-type games on a single screen, why change it, let alone make each player pay $100 for a controller in order to join in? The touchscreen controller will have its own purposes, most of which will be for single player-- it makes the most sense.\n\nYou say it's kinda silly to assume what will definitely be the center point of the console won't be the main controller... That's assuming its intended purpose was to be a controller. I don't believe that to be the case. If its main intended function was for streaming and we just misinterpreted the leaked reports, then it's not silly at all. In fact, the idea that we'd be expected to have to likely pay $100 for each controller, is a lot sillier.\n\nQuote from: BlackNMild2k1\n\nSo you've correctly interpreted it as a separate controller?\n\nWell, I'm glad we have that all cleared up. We've all had it wrong. The rumors have been talking about 2 (TWO) separate controllers this whole time... I guess we should ignore what the orignal source had said about what the tablet controller sorta resembled.\n\nReally we have no idea what is right or what is wrong, but it is kinda crazy to think that the big new feature of the next console, which is rumored to be a controller with a screen in the middle won't be the main controller for the new system.\n\nInstead it will be some system accessory that you set on the side and reference from time to time instead of looking at the television. That makes perfect sense.\n\nBut we will all find out tomorrow morning, so there really is no need to argue over who interpreted it correctly and who has it all wrong.\n\nLOL... You have toknow that's not what I'm saying. I never said you'd be using them both at the same time! I've only re-clarified it how many times already? If you're still not getting it try re-reading it.\n\nHow is this so farfetched? In order to let you play away from the TV, wouldn't it need to have its own controls built-in? You certainly wouldn't be using a remote with a tiny 6\" screen... It sounds to me like such a device would look EXACTLY like a controller with a screen in the middle.\n\nSo we hear a description of a tablet that looks like a screen built into a controller, and the normal conclusion would be that it's the system's controller-- it's understandable. But Nintendo has been known for its non-traditional designs... and IF they were including a device to meant mainly for portable-play away from the TV like I'm describing, it WOULD fit the same physical description... and easily COULD be confused for system's controller if you didn't know better... especially if it could also be used as a controller itself anyway.\n\nI think maybe you're getting irritated with me because my idea actually makes perfect sense, and you just don't like the fact the idea you've had building up in your head for the past month isn't going to happen after all...\n\nI only went back one page, and I answered these from the bottom up, but let me know if I missed something.\n\nQuote from: Bman87301\n\nI'm still quite confident that you're all kidding yourselves because you want to believe a local multi-player design could work, and not because you realistically think it will.\n\nAt this point, I expect this touch screen controller is going to be primarily, if not exclusively, for single player experiences (not counting online), and for giving you an option of playing away from the TV. It'll likely be an auxiliary controller, not the main controller-- which will most likely be another pointer-based controller (which works well for both single player experiences and multi-player parlor games anyway). This touch screen controller will appeal mainly to gamers. I don't see the casual crowd flocking to it, and I don't see Nintendo willing to lose them. Nintendo will be trying to lure in both. That's where this secondary controller comes in... It certainly won't be designed around multi-player.\n\nSo what happens if I want to play local multi and don't have the privilege of using the TV? SOL or Wiimotes on a 6\" screen?\n\nI think a second Caf√© controller, that most certainly won't cost $100, would be a more reasonable solution.\n\nI still think it's silly to think that the big new innovative features of this new system were built around using this streaming controller that you think will be relegated to secondary controller.... an auxiliary item.\n\nQuote from: Bman87301\n\nI still say you're kidding yourselves if you think this is going to be the standard controller used for multiplayer. Wii was by far the most profitable system this generation, so they're not going to abandon the Wii remote-styled wand controls.\n\nNo one said they would abandon the wiimotes, just not use them as the main controller for this next system.\n\nThere could be a new Wiimote 2.0, but then again, maybe this new controller actually addresses the need for a separate controller as it is everything we need.\n\nI think you are kidding yourself if you think the lazy 3rd parties are gonna program single player for one kind of controller and then multiplayer (for the same game?) exclusively for a different kind of controller.\n\nThey are gonna program the game to work with the primary controller in all modes, but that doesn't mean that they can't program the game to work in all modes with a secondary controller too.\n\nUnless they do pack 2 separate controllers in the box or pack a game in with that secondary controller, no dev is gonna assume that any gamer has that controller available and will not pledge exclusive support to the non-standard controller.\n\nQuote from: Bman87301\n\nWho says this touch screen thing is going to be the only input device included in the box?

Also has a camera and we assume ties into the better motion sensing that Move. How? we aren't sure yet, but there has been no indication of a second controller (wiimote or otherwise) in the box.\n\nAll rumors have pointed to one controller. The one with the touch screen. the one with all the buttons and dual analogs. the one with the camera and the one we assume to also have motion tech like gyros and accelerometer.\n\nQuote from: BlackNMild2k1\n\nNo one said it was gonna be ditched.\n\nWe all knew the Wiiu was gonna be fully backwards compatible with all of Wii's hardware just like the rumors said.\n\nI think it's pretty safe to say that you were just wrong. No way to wiggle out of it now.\n\nUm, I was trying to take the high road by trying to let you take some credit rather than gloating... But if you this how you're going to be, then fine, have it your way...\n\nThe fact of the matter is that I was at least 80% right. This whole debate was based on multiplayer design, which I stated would stay mostly motion control based, which it apparently looks as if that is going to be the case. I kept saying only we'd be seeing game designs around a SINGLE tablet-- and low and behold, not a single video clip showed multiple tablets together. I kept saying your ideas weren't likely to work because were mostly based around each players having the multiple screens. Was I proven wrong at all there? I'll be first to admit I still haven't been proven entirely right but this just yet... but seems most likely to assume my assertion was correct for the most part.\n\nI also managed to predict pretty much every feature about the tablet minus the camera... So, how exactly was I so wrong again?\n\nI was wrong about the new remote... One thing out of over a dozen other things I got dead on. How about giving credit when credit is due, rather than being a sore loser?\n\nI gotta say, I'm kinda embarrassed for you that you'd sink this low...\n\nLike I said I went back 1 page.\n\nYou said the new controller would be a secondary auxiliary controller and that it was silly of us to assume the new controller wouldn't be the focus of the system and the controller that all games are designed around. wrong.\n\nYou said there would be a new controller in the box that would replace the Wiimote (not in so many words) and would be the main controller, especially for multiplayer.\n\nPartially wrong.... we don't know anything about multi screen controller gameplay yet. so I can't give you a partially right... yet.\n\nYou said we would be kidding ourselves if this controller was used for multiplayer at all.\n\nWell considering every game they showed multiplayer or otherwise used the new controller... I think that makes you wrong\n\nSo if you were right about some stuff before the last page, then I apologize, but from everything I quoted, it looks like you were pretty off the mark on most of it. And I'm not trying to be rude or gloat or anything, but I just didn't see how you can claim some credit for being right when I didn't see you get anything absolutely correct."
