        "text": "With the release of Animal Crossing: New Horizons, the fifth main entry in the Animal Crossing franchise, on the Nintendo Switch, the series has seen huge numbers of players settling in and enjoying its cozy take on island life. New Horizons introduced players to a slew of new features and a wide array of activities to do on their very own island.\n\nRELATED: Animal Crossing: 10 Quality Of Life Issues That Ver. 2.0 Still Didn't Address\n\nAnimal Crossing has gone through many phases and changes since the original game's release on the Nintendo GameCube in 2002. The series has grown and matured in countless ways, and it's interesting to take a look back to see how much the franchise has changed since those its early GameCube days.\n\n10 Re-Thinking The Idea Of Travel\n\nAnimal Crossing has always introduced players to the main village in a unique way. Throughout the series, players have arrived by different transportation methods to see their town for the first time. These different modes of transportation mirror the overall type of experience the game offers. In the original Animal Crossing, players travel to the small village by train, following the story of a free-spirited adolescent leaving home for a fresh take on life.\n\nAnimal Crossing: New Horizons tasks players with becoming the developer of an island getaway. As such, freedom of transportation is needed, and players get their first glimpses of the village by air in a seaplane. A drastic shift in attitude for the villager is accompanied by a similar change of transportation.\n\n9 A Shift From Town Living To Island Designing\n\nAnimal Crossing is a game about new experiences and leaving the comfort of everyday life for the unknown. The series has shifted from the villager being a member of the town, your only driving force being property ownership and bill-paying, to being head designer of an entire island, along with every responsibility that comes with the title.\n\nRELATED: 5 Video Game Cities That Would Be Great To Live In (& 5 That Would Be Awful)\n\nNew Horizon changes the scope of the villager's role. Placing buildings throughout the island, customizing the town, and maximizing your island's star rating are big changes from the simple joys of fishing or sitting on the beach letting the waves roll in.\n\n8 Tom Nook Has Downscaled His Business Ownership\n\nTom Nook is the raccoon villager that helps the player throughout their time in the Animal Crossing series. He is the proprietor of the Nook's Cranny store, and, in Animal Crossing: New Horizons, he also acts as a travel agent and lead developer for the island. Tom Nook's store remains the main location for everything needed in Animal Crossing.\n\nIn earlier games in the franchise, Tom Nook is a more unsympathetic industrious shop owner, and Nook's Cranny would grow and upgrade as his business improves. What started as a small wooden, tin-roofed building would become a multi-leveled superstore, complete with Tom upgrading his clothing to a majestic blue suit and tie. Animal Crossing: New Horizons has a reduced upgrade path for Nook's shop and wardrobe.\n\n7 The Original Town Map Worked On A Grid\n\nNew players to the Animal Crossing series may be unfamiliar with the way the original town worked. Animal Crossing's GameCube village was split into a grid that had the villager pushing the game world one square in the direction they were walking, reminiscent to games such as The Legend of Zelda. The player view was also tweaked in later releases, when the camera angle was lowered allowing the player is able to view more of their island at once.\n\nThe original \"tile map\" was broken up into labeled sections ranging from A-F and 1-5, similar to that of a chessboard. This grid-like system was replaced in later releases, allowing the player more fluid motion as they walked around town.\n\n6 Fossils No Longer Need To Be Sent In the Mail To Be Identified\n\nFossils have been a staple of the Animal Crossing franchise since the beginning, although the process of identifying them has changed drastically over the various installments. In the original game, fossils that were found buried around town needed to be sent in the mail to be identified. The player would need to write a letter addressed to the Farway Museum and attach the fossil. They would then receive the identified fossil back the next day.\n\nIn its current iteration, Animal Crossing allows Blathers, the curator of the town's local museum, to identify and accept fossils found on the island. No mailing process or waiting is needed.\n\n5 More Freedom In Town Management and Aesthetics\n\nOriginally, villages in Animal Crossing were a set of predetermined towns with buildings and homes scattered throughout the thirty-grid map. Once those locations were set, they could not be moved, and subsequent villagers who moved into town would randomly select a tile to build their house on with no guidance from the player.\n\nRELATED: Animal Crossing: 10 Things Only Fans Know About Tom Nook\n\nAnimal Crossing: New Horizons has drastically changed this style of town management to a more player-focused one. As the head of island development, New Horizons players are able to pick exact locations for everything that is built, planted, or showcased. The series has given the player more freedom in designing their island, a big change from the villager relocating to a seemingly already established town in the original release.\n\n4 Crafting and Terraforming To Create The Perfect Getaway\n\nAnimal Crossing: New Horizons' main theme is freedom in both how a villager spends their time on the island and in how the island looks and functions. Players are given a fresh take on town management that includes terraforming the grounds and crafting furniture to match whatever theme or appearance imaginable. By using the island designing app on their NookPhone, players can modify anything they see on their island.\n\nThese tools offer intricate island design, an aspect not found in the original Animal Crossing, which gave the player a town that could not be modified once the game was underway.\n\n3 Villagers Relocating Are A Player Choice\n\nVillagers in the original Animal Crossing release were much more independent residents of the town. Villagers could move in and out of town without input from the player. How the town expanded and grew was out of the player's hands, making them feel like a bystander in how the town developed.\n\nIn Animal Crossing: New Horizons, the player now has total control over villagers. The location of the homes, as well as which villagers leave or move in, are player choices. Players can entice certain villagers to visit their island, or they can visit mystery islands to find villagers to move to their island.\n\n2 Mr. Resetti Lost His Job To Auto-Save\n\nOver the years, Animal Crossing has employed interesting methods of guiding players into saving their game or scaring them into not resetting when something didn't go their way. When players turned off their GameCube without saving and quitting, Mr. Resetti, a mole with a cranky attitude, would walk them through the importance of saving. Repeated resets would have Mr. Resetti yelling at the player about saving or even pretending to reset the player's progress himself.\n\nRELATED: 10 Anime Characters Who Had One Job (But Failed)\n\nCurrently, Animal Crossing: New Horizons has an auto-save feature that continuously saves everything the player does. Mr. Resetti will seemingly stay underground for good due to this new feature, and the days of him threatening the player with deleting their town are -- unfortunately for some -- over.\n\n1 The NookPhone Puts Everything At One's Fingertips\n\nWith the expanded roster of options in New Horizons, players needed an interface to manage everything. The introduction of the NookPhone allows players to carry these features around in their pocket for easy island development. The NookPhone features various apps and a few other quality of life improvements that should make their time on the island on a more enjoyable experience.\n\nThere was no such smart phone in the GameCube Animal Crossing, which makes sense as mobile phones weren't typically able to connect to the Internet until the early 2000s. But as real-world tech advanced, so has Animal Crossing tech. Thus, the NookPhone was born."
