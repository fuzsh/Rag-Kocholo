One island per Switch.\n\nsigzy wigzy\n\nYeah Nintendo really f***ed this up. One island per Switch. It’s stupid. We all knew about this prior to release, but I’m sorry for those of you just jumping into the game finding this out now. And finding this out the hard way. As far as I know this is the only game that Nintendo’s done this with. Completely asinine.\n\nOn a hot summer's night, would you offer your throat to the wolf with the red roses?\n\nACNH: Moscato DA: 7542-7467-2915\n\nYou can move the island back and forth with the app but that would probably be cumbersome to do all the time. I don't know, it has been over two years since I have done it so I don't remember how long the transfer takes.\n\nI mean it is dumb you can not make multiple islands but I'm not sure why that is coming up on a topic about the TC wanting to use the same island on a Switch Lite that is taken to work.\n\nThat seems to be an entirely different topic.\n\n\"Ta dadada ta daaa!

Having a Switch Lite to take to work seemed like a good idea. Not so much now.\n\nLike I said Nintendo really f***ed up. It is a fantastic idea! That, had idiots not had control, would have worked (as it does for pretty much every other game) and been great. If I remember correctly we didn’t even have access to Cloud saves in ACNH for an entire year after its release!\n\nOn a hot summer's night, would you offer your throat to the wolf with the red roses?\n\nACNH: Moscato DA: 7542-7467-2915\n\nMiIkmanII (Topic Creator)5 months ago#7\n\nYeah, that's really unfortunate. Lame decision. Let players control how they play. No need for these types of restrictions.\n\nProtect society from the emotions of ugly people\n\nMiIkmanII posted...\n\nI just want to play my game on the systems I own. Having a Switch Lite to take to work seemed like a good idea. Not so much now.\n\nIts cheaper and still portable just to have a regular switch / oled model.\n\nBut yeah before the game came out they made it well known that their save style is different.\n\nThe island itself is bound to the switch, not user account.\n\nTherefore you can have up to 8 human players build houses and share experiences on that same island. The design is pro family at home. Your daughter/son/brother/sister could pick up another controller and jump in and help farm items etc. The concept is fine (not asinine, its a really good idea) but not what people expected.\n\nSo the fact you can't xfer via cloud saves makes sense since the island is on your home console.\n\nNow you CAN transfer (move, not copy) the entire island to your other switch, which then essentially deletes it off your other one using the island transfer tool. Then xfer your character saves from one console to the other, but that's time consuming and a pain in the butt. It's also part of an attempt at making sure people earn their items and not dupe by abusing cloud saves. Problem is people spam \"treasure islands\" with hacked saves anyway... (I avoid, defeats purpose of game, and also you might pick up hacked items you can never drop)\n\nPokemon also doesn't cloud save to avoid duping. Especially makes sense here as there is the competitive scene which is supposed to be showing off the fruits of your breeding / training / synergy expertise.\n\nEvery time someone tells me they are thinking of buying a switch lite I tell them its a scam. You can't connect to a TV, therefore can't record / livestream footage, can't play certain games without buying additional joycons making it a more expensive console than the other ones, and can't send in JUST the joycons and have to say byebye to your whole console when they exhibit stick drift."
