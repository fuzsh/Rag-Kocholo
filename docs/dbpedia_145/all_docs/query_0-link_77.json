        "text": "This game has you as a main character going to a new town and setting up a home. You get to meet your various animal neighbors and do a few things such as fishing or bug collecting. You progress in real time so whatever day it is on your gamecube it is that time in animal crossing. For awhile this is somewhat fun, however, over time the game seemed more like a chore than a fun game to play. If I decorated my house wrong I was blasted, the animals kept expecting you to visit. What really got on my nerves is that at first new animals would move in and that was neat and then some would move away, but after awhile the only ones that would move out was the newest one that just came. I would have liked it to be more random. Also, the fishing and stuff got old and I would have liked a few more things to do. They had special days when there would be festivals in town and I thought maybe you could do some new things then, but all you can do is watch the other animals do stuff while you just do your stuff as normal. Also, I am a night person and I would have liked to see at least one habitant of the town not be in bed after a certain time leaving me to wander the town alone. Still, I am betting if you had a friend who had a town and you could visit this game would have been more fun. All in all it has its moments, but for me it wore thin, however it did have me hooked for a bit. So I will not say avoid it, I just think it is a case of it not being for me."
