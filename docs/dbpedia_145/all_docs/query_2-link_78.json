        "text": "Though Nintendo didn’t show its upcoming Switch successor during its Nintendo Direct broadcast Tuesday, the company outlined its release schedule for the second half of 2024. The June Nintendo Direct ran for 40 minutes and showcased everything expected in the coming months, including a brand new Zelda game.
