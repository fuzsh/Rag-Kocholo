        "text": "Super Mario World was a launch title for Super NES, and it marked the first appearance of Yoshi. Super Mario World 2: Yoshi’s Island, which was released four years later, was the memorable first game that starred Yoshi as the main character. For that reason, I will be talking today with Takashi Tezuka, Shigefumi Hino and Hisashi Nogami with a focus on Yoshi.\n\nAnd now for Tezuka-san, Hino-san and Nogami-san!\n\nNogami-san, you’ve been involved with Animal Crossing1 and Splatoon.2 Super Mario World is one of the games we’re discussing today, but you hadn’t yet joined the company when it came out.\n\nHino-san, you’ve been involved with most of the games in the Pikmin3 series.\n\nThat’s right. I’ve been involved with the series from the first game, through Pikmin 3 for Wii U. Later, for development of Super Mario Maker4, I was involved with implementing art I had done for Super Mario World.\n\nKazunobu Shimizu6 was the director of that racing game, wasn’t he?\n\nHowever, that was how F-ZERO7 came to be. In your second year at the company, you came to be involved with Super Mario, Nintendo’s top series. How did that feel?\n\nI felt a great deal of pressure. It was a launch title for Super NES, and the previous game, Super Mario Bros. 38, was really well-made, so it was intimidating to know it would be compared to that. For that reason, I worried a lot over how we could present Super Mario in a fresh way on Super NES.\n\nI think he likes horses. (laughs) When we were making Super Mario Bros. 3, he had drawn a picture of Mario on a horse, and hung it on a wall near where he used to sit. I would look at that and think, “I think he wants Mario to ride something.” When we started making Super Mario World, we were working with the concept of a dinosaur land, so I had Hino do art for a kind of reptile.\n\nYes. Another thing that made an impression was the action of the fence flipping around, and how characters that were in front of the fence would go behind it. Those were things that couldn’t have been done with NES, so I thought they were very interesting.\n\nNogami was part of the inaugural class of the Game Seminar.9\n\nAt Nintendo back then, designers would just do visuals for a few years after entering the company. After that, it was generally understood that you would move on to become a director or planner.\n\nYeah. So then I entered a period of thinking up all sorts of projects, experimenting with them, and canning them over and over. It got to the point where I thought if the next project fell through, I couldn’t stay at the company.\n\nI was involved with development of The Legend of Zelda series, like development of The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past10 and The Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening.11\n\nOh, I see. After that, Super Mario 6412 came out and for a while the focus was on more three-dimensional action and not side-scrolling.\n\nThe company that developed that game was Rare14 in Britain, and it made an impression within Nintendo. The graphics were such as we had never seen for Super NES.\n\nNintendo 64 was on standby for release the next year, so our director, Tezuka, and Hideki Konno15 began devoting their attention to Super Mario 64 and so forth.\n\nWe asked SRD16 to do the programming, and they had a background with the series, so we could leave it to them without worrying. But for a time, we three designers did planning while also doing the actual work on the project.\n\nThere was also a time when each day we would brainstorm ideas. Partway through development, we showed it to those involved with sales and distribution to get some feedback. It got a favourable evaluation, and we were able to get the other staff members to come back! (laughs)\n\nI’d also like people to pay attention to the sound. Koji Kondo17 was in charge of the sound for both of these games. When we were making Super Mario World 2: Yoshi’s Island, we asked him to do the sound for bosses, and the first thing he did was a fairly laidback tune! Hino and I spoke with him about it, and the result was some really cool music, which really impressed me. I never expected less! (laughs)\n\nWhen it comes to sound, you usually can’t compose the music until the game has come together to a certain extent, but we were behind, and I think Kondo was really chomping at the bit. But the rush at the end was insane, so I was quite moved when the ending background music came in.\n\nLook forward to the final volume of this interview series, coming soon: Kirby Super Star!\n\nFind out more about some of the classic games included in Nintendo Classic Mini: Super Nintendo Entertainment System in our developer interviews!\n\nVolume 1: Star Fox + Star Fox 2\n\nVolume 2: F-ZERO\n\nVolume 3: Super Metroid\n\nVolume 4: Super Mario Kart\n\nNintendo Classic Mini: Super Nintendo Entertainment System is out now.
