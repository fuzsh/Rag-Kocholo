        "text": "drizzdo said:\n\nhi,\n\nIs anyone working on a PPC (Pocket PC) emulator for N64.\n\nThere is a Playstation one, so why not N64...\n\nSorry for the dumb question but just would like to know if I should keep hope\n\nDrizz\n\nIt really would be nice. I don't know about the chances of it happening since x86 platform has more \"audience\" and hardware available, but going into obscure theories there are few interesting things to look at from nintendo itself.\n\nthere is already an n64 emulation program for the GC, wich happens to be a ppc platform (custom ppc platform, that is, but ppc none the less). Off course is highly incompatible as far as I know with only a few games working on it (but zelda works flawlessly!! ).\n\ngoing a bit off topic into obscure theories, I see the game cube as being a techlological first step into the upcoming revolution. I don't intend going to deep into this, but I want to note a couple of things. It is assumed revolution will also be a ppc platform, and at that, it is also directly retrocompatible with GC software. given the small anounced size of the console, knowing that nintendo itself says it won't be revolutionary in computing terms, that they have the same people desingning their processors, that they have stated that dev kits for revo wont be so different from those of GC and that developers can start a proyect in GC and just simply and easily import it to REV (wich was shown with Metroid Prime 3, for example), it would seem to me a logical, practical and extremely clever move to me, that in fact GC arquitechture is the foundation for revo (updated, upgraded, with new tweaks and added technoloy, of course, just like our PCs today are based on the same technology from the original IBM AT, even tough that seem like a discouraging statement, given all the legacy shit that fucks todays PCs, but remember when GC was all new, all devs already were praising how good, simple and well tuned GC's architecture was, so it's not the same history, fortunatelly), and I think nintendo has planned that from the start, building their \"revolution\" from the ground, technological ground that is so in this gen developers can concentrate in content because they already now the basic technological shit from the previous generation, wich was already easy.\n\nThis would be confirmated further with all the emus nintendo has started to develop in GC, and the maybe not so NEW virtual console for REVO wich is also an emulator as far as we know, wich I think is simply the product of their advance in the development of the ones we already played in animal crossing, metroid prime, the extra zelda discs...\n\nso yes, there are in fact N64 emus for PPC, from Nintendo themselves, nothing less!!\n\nthe problem is they are binary only, so porting them from a customiced platform such as GC/REVO without the source code (little chances nintendo would release them, and even less on a permisive license) to a more general purpose one like a powermac/powerbook seems difficult, not to talk about the all new, higly secret DRM shit nintendo will implant in their revolution...\n\nwell, that's what we have.\n\nhope you find that interesting.\n\nif anyone wants to somewhat publish my theory ramblings somewhere else, just put a link to the original or give credit in some way. If you don't... well, if you don't I may never know, nor care... just be nice and act with honour\n\nhehe, hi\n\nActually after writting that I came and wrote a more detailed and documented one and tried to spread it to some news sites and blogs. none of them wanted it... I didn't even have a reply.\n\nI ended translating it to my mother language, Spanish (i'm from Spain), and posted it in a forum I used to go by years ago but got invaded by trolls, lamers and just tons of clueles people inundating all with repetitive threads, meaningless polls, and TONS AND TONS of swearing, insulting, fanatic interforum battling (y'know, nintendo vs sony vs microsoft, \"your console sucks and you suck because you don't have mine wich is gazillion time better than that shit you plan\"... etc)... I got sick and left. Now seems a much nicer place, wich is good.\n\nanyway.\n\nHere you go: the full version:\n\nhttp://www.xente.mundo-r.com/radorn/revo_e.html\n\nit is a bit rushed, and the spanish version, wich got done later is a lot more polished...\n\nI may revise the english one soon, but it is at least readable\n\nIf you are interested in spreading it, do so, just give credit, please.\n\nI think it would be a good addition to theories arround, because none gets into questioning this. The rule has been that generation after generation consoles change completelly (at least in the computing part) and I think everybody just assumed that and didn't even consider it being another way\n\nwell, enough xD\n\nand thanks for your kind words."
