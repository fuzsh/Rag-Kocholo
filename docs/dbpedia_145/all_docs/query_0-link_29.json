        "text": "Animal Crossing: Population Growing (Also known as Dōbutsu no Mori, Animal Forest, Dōbutsu no Mori+, or Dōbutsu no Mori e+, or simply known by many as Animal Crossing) was released on September 15, 2002. It began the now popular Animal Crossing series.\n\nWhy It's Growing[]\n\nIt was considered to be one of the best Nintendo GameCube games that was released.\n\nNostalgic music and soundtrack.\n\nIt also spawned a large fanbase that still plays the game to this day.\n\nYou can play with other players.\n\nSimilar to amiibos, you could scan in cards with an E-Reader which could move in villagers that you want in your town.\n\nNice graphics that aged very well.\n\nYou could take fossils that you discovered to a Museum where you could donate to Blathers there.\n\nYou could also play a few NES games if you obtain the console that contains them, and even more games if you hack the game.\n\nOn New Year's Day, you and the villagers can make a coin toss into the wishing well for good luck.\n\nYou can have a total of fifteen villagers in your town. Later games (except for Wild World) allow up to ten villagers in your town.\n\nYou can gain extra bells from villagers by asking them for a job at any time where you can help them out.\n\nYou can earn exclusive Gracie clothing from Gracie by washing her car.\n\nYou can have multiple towns with the use of multiple memory cards.\n\nIf you fully pay back all of your loans to Tom Nook, he'll erect a statue of yourself in your honor near the train station with the statue even looking like yourself.\n\nYou can drop up to nine items at once with the use of the X button which is really useful.\n\nIt's fun to be kicking balls around the town.\n\nThe journals and diaries are really useful which allow you write notes and show the dates of upcoming events and the days that you've played the game.\n\nNone of the works of art come off as being a forgery.\n\nYou can catch Wisp's spirits and he'll help you out afterwards by pulling your weeds, paint your roof or give you an item that's not already in your catalog.\n\nYou can kill snowmen.\n\nThe game has Sale Day which functions just like Black Friday.\n\nSome towns have three tiers.\n\nIn early May each year, there are outdoor windsocks which provide some unique scenary.\n\nYou can earn raffle tickets and use them on Raffle Day for a spin of Tom Nook's wheel.\n\nTwice a year, there's a four-event sports fair.\n\nMr Resetti, while annoying, can be very funny if you reset the game on purpose just to see him yell at your character.\n\nBad Qualities[]\n\nThe villagers are very mean-spirited to the player whenever they refuse to do what the villager says. They would say mean things and call them names. Thankfully, their mean spirited behavior toned down over the years as new games were released.\n\nNowadays, it's very difficult to find people to play with due to the fact that they mostly play the newer games like New Leaf, New Horizons, and Pocket Camp. This is the same problem with Wild World and City Folk.\n\nWe don't really get to learn who Farley is (the mage creature who gives you a Golden Axe at the Wishing Well when you have a Perfect Town).\n\nYour character is forced to wear a hat NO MATTER WHAT, making you look like a viking.\n\nPants, shoes, and socks weren't in this game as well.\n\nThere's a creepy Easter egg where your character's face gets replaced with a gyroid face if you reset a lot of time which can be too frightening for younger players.\n\nIf you visit another town by train, you can risk losing a villager.\n\nSometimes, the villagers will you paint your roof without your permission which you can't prevent and you never get to pick the color. It can take a while get your roof back to the color it was beforehand.\n\nBlathers can't identify fossils on his own, forcing you to mail them to the Faraway Museum for identification. When you do so, you only get three of them back from them per day.\n\nThe game lacks a connected storage space. Among the limited storage space options are inconvenient. You can use dressers to store stuff but only three items for each and they can only hold small items. The gyroid outside your home can store a total of four items. You can attach items to saved letters but there's no way to easily tell which specific item is attached to the letter.\n\nSometimes, the villagers can force you to trade or purchase items you don't want such as a specific item in your possession where they'll force you to trade or sell the item you have. More frequently. they can force you to buy one item out of the five they list one by one.\n\nIntroduces Mr. Resetti, one of the most annoying characters in the series and probably in video game history being tied with Baby Mario's crying in Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island, The Dog's laugh in Duck Hunt and Ashley Graham in Resident Evil 4. He and his other appearances appears in front of player's house whenever the player resets their system without saving giving the player a overly-long lecture saying to not reset. Also he mocks the player constantly to the point cause younger players cry. This thing is even worse if the Nintendo GameCube starts to overheat to the point it turns itself off, Nintendo DS console's battery ran out, when there's a blackout, parents forcing him/her to turn off especially without saving or anyone else especially his/her family especially parents, brothers/sisters, sons/daughters, or even her boyfriend/his girlfriend accidentally turning off the console without saving.\n\nTips to Avoid Mr. Resetti[]\n\nMr. Resetti as said above is considered one of the most annoying characters from the series due to he gives the player a overly-long lecture whenever the player resets the game without saving or causing the aforementioned problems above that it takes roughly two or three minutes which is a very time consuming and stressful. Not only this, but some lectures it cause young children cry. However, there are tips to avoid Mr. Resetti especially if you're under twelve years old.\n\nSimply, as Mr. Resetti says, saving is very important so you must save the game constantly especially when your parents force to you turn off the console and go to sleep or doing purchases with parents etc:.\n\nAvoid playing the console for extended period of time in temperatures over 28,c (82,f) as the console will overheat easily due to the aforementioned high temperatures to the point it turns itself off. If this occur, save the game immediately and turn off the console and wait when the console's intercooler is cold. As suggests you must play the console in low temperatures (recommended 17,c 62,6f or lower) as the console doesn't overheat too much.\n\nIf you are playing Wild World and if your Nintendo DS's batteries are close to running out, simply recharge your Nintendo DS and done because if the batteries ran out, the game resets."
