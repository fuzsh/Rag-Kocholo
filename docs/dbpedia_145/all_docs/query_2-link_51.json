        "text": "In my eyes, I've been looking at some of the previous mainline games and when their respective consoles came out.\n\nThe first game, as some of you already know, was originally released in April 2001 on the Nintendo 64 in Japan only. It was also the final Nintendo-developed game to be released on the N64, as the GameCube had become a thing and the far-better port was already being developed. Said port was one of the first Nintendo titles to be released on the GameCube in December 2001 and was subsequently localized by the North American team in September of the following year.\n\nWild World was released in 2005, a year after the Nintendo DS's release.\n\nCity Folk/Let's Go to the City came out in 2008, roughly two years after the Wii was born.\n\nNew Leaf is a 2013 (November 2012 in Japan) game, coming out about a year or two after the 3DS's release. The amiibo update came in 2016 soon after HHD's release.\n\nNew Horizons obviously in 2020, first announced in 2018 with an originally-slated 2019 release. The Switch came out in 2017.\n\nLots of dates to remember. If Nintendo sticks with this trend, we may get a vague announcement - at the minimum - of the next mainline game sometime late this year or the next as Splatoon 3 content starts slowing down. Whether that will be on the current Switch or the alleged \"Switch II\", I'm up for it coming out on either console.\n\nIn my opinion, Animal Crossing would make a fantastic VR experience as an optional feature. Being able to talk to villagers in first person, as well as fishing and catching bugs sounds like a lot of fun. We already have something like this with the first-person pro camera feature, so it's entirely possible to implement in the next game. Unfortunately, the Switch doesn't have any VR capability, so it would most likely be saved for the next console if Nintendo ever wanted to forget about their Virtual Boy failure and try their hand at it again with updated technology.\n\nSo, the first Switch release in 2017, then we got the AC:NH announcement the next year in 2018.\n\nI know it seems like a lot of time to wait but if the switch to does release later this year, but I would honestly be very grateful if we got an announcement for the next Animal Crossing game the next year in 2025. Even if it is very vague. As long as it is confirmed/guaranteed to be the next mainline game, I would be grateful.\n\nAnd yes, itâ€™s gonna take some time to actually develop fully especially if they want it to be in-depth and feel not unfinished like new horizons, so maybe in two or three years after the announcement, itâ€™ll finally release in 2027 or 2028\n\nAgain, I know that seems like a very long time but we do need to keep in mind that theyâ€™re probably gonna wait until the following year. plus, the 2 to 3 years of development.\n\nI would love for the best features of all games to be combined including some new features that weâ€™ve been wanting, especially deeper friendships with the villagers, and more interactions (e.g. hugging your villagers), that would make for masterpiece.\n\nOf course, for certain features to be improved, like terraforming. I do think it should come back, but they should make it less tedious.\n\nI donâ€™t mind crafting coming back as long as they add the bulk-crafting this time and not make us rely so much on it.\n\nDurability, I think it needs to go, at least for golden tools.\n\nI also want a lot of the furniture sets from new leaf and its predecessors to come back, while still keeping the ones from new horizon, and adding new ones in.\n\ni honestly think it could go either way. i would probably think yes if not for that hefty seven year gap between NL and NH. (i guess it's more like five if you count when we first heard about NH.) of course, NL had its longevity extended with the welcome amiibo update. that said, the time between WA and NH's first announcement was two-ish years, and it's been two-ish years since NH's last major update, so i could see a potential tease for the next animal crossing. personally, i would kind of hope they take their time to develop it and don't rush. (not that waiting seven years did much good for base game NH...) i would hate to relive the experience of an iffy game at launch where most of the content is gradually added over a year. that's not fun to me. i'd prefer to wait a couple more years and get a very fleshed out game at launch, a la NL.\n\ndepending on how much difference there is between the current switch and the switch 2.0, i think they would have to add an interesting gimmick/twist on the next game to better differentiate it from NH for me (even if that's just a departure from the island setting and going back to a town or even city) but i almost dread that they'd go too far into the direction of giving you total control/customization... then it wouldn't feel quite like animal crossing to me. i'd love to see slightly more of a return to NL and being a life-sim rather than a decorating one."
