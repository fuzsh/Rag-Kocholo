I know it has been likened before to the Dreamcast, which is understandable, but I feel like it has more in common with the N64.\n\n- Both the N64 and Xbox were the most powerful consoles of their generation in terms of specs. This also meant that they had the best graphical capabilities and were capable of running games their competitors couldn't (Half-Life 2 on Xbox, Perfect Dark on N64 for example).\n\n- As such, both were very oriented toward Western audiences. The N64 had more support from Western developers than Japanese devs. The same is true of the Xbox.\n\n- North America was by far the strongest market for both consoles, with relatively poor performances elsewhere.\n\n- Multiplayer was the selling point of both consoles. For the N64, it was local multiplayer with the newly introduced four controller ports. For the Xbox, it was online multiplayer with Xbox Live, but also local multiplayer to a lesser extent with the LAN capabilities. In fact, you could argue that the online multiplayer centric approach of console gaming today started with the N64's local multiplayer focus and naturally evolved into the Xbox taking it online.\n\n- They excel in mostly the same genres. The most notable of these are first-person shooters, where they are both clearly well ahead of their competition. They also are both particularly strong in the racing, sports, and 3D action adventure genre.\n\n- Both usually received the best version of multi-platform games (in some cases this isn't true for the N64 vs PS1, but it is for almost any 3D intensive game. It's pretty much always true for Xbox).\n\n- Halo is the sixth-gen's GoldenEye, carrying the torch of further popularizing and shaping the shooter genre, not just on consoles, but in general.\n\n- Both got several notable PC ports and/or multi-platform games. For the N64, it was Turok 1 and 2, Quake 1 and 2, Starcraft 64, Command and Conquer, etc. For the Xbox, it was KotoR 1 and 2, Morrowind, Half-Life 2, etc. I would say they have the most in common with the PC of the consoles of their generation.\n\n-Both finished second in terms of sales.\n\n- Although massively outperformed by their chief competitor, they had a lasting and arguably greater impact on shaping the future of the console industry. For the N64, it was software like Mario 64, GoldenEye, and OoT, as well as standardizing analog sticks and ushering in the multiplayer focus. For the Xbox, it was the internal hard-drive, a more fully fleshed out online service, and the beginning of a shift in the console industry away from Japan toward the West.\n\nHas anyone else made this connection?\n\nPoorRetroGamer 6 years ago#2\n\nAlso, Rare was meant to be a XBOX developer.\n\nI know they failed with Grabbed by the Ghoulies, but they were in the right direction with the Conkers remake.\n\nThat game had the most impressive graphics in the OG XBOX, and it was the most advanced N64 title either,and both came near the end of the life cycle of each console, in the case of both consoles, nearly six months before the sucessor launch.\n\nPC RTX3070 / Consoles: GB SG SAT N64 PSone DC PS2 GBA GBMicro XBOX PSP X360 DS Wii GC PS3 WiiU PS4 XONEX New3DS Switch SeriesX PS5 /Minis: Nes Snes NGeo PSc MD\n\nPoorRetroGamer 6 years ago#3\n\nSEGA titles were split between XBOX , GC and PS2.\n\nThe PS2 had the most titles, XBOX had some important ones and hardcore titles while GC was left with kid friendly games.\n\nSo its not true XBOX was a sucessor to Dreamcast because of SEGA. Its more because the SEGA fanatics were left without a home, so they adopted the new brand after SEGA retirement.\n\nGC doesnt feel anything like the N64, its inferior in every way and Nintendo gave the back to western developers that helped the N64, (Acclaim, Midway etc all had financial trouble during that generation) in favor of japanese studios hoping to increase sales in the japanese market with few 2nd grade jrpg like Tales of.\n\nWe know how it ended for Nintendo, and well done for them, they really deserved to lose that generation to the XBOX.\n\nPC RTX3070 / Consoles: GB SG SAT N64 PSone DC PS2 GBA GBMicro XBOX PSP X360 DS Wii GC PS3 WiiU PS4 XONEX New3DS Switch SeriesX PS5 /Minis: Nes Snes NGeo PSc MD\n\nGenerationX-Men 6 years ago#4\n\nNintendo incorporated many elements that were cut from N64 games into Gamecube titles, such as horseback combat that was cut form OoT.\n\nAlso, the N64 was originally going to use discs with the N64 Disc Drive, which flopped. Gamecube is what the N64 should have been in some ways for that reason. And LOL @ kiddie games. The GC had no more kiddie games than any other console:\n\nhttps://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/top10/1180-the-top-10-gamecube-games-rated-m-for-mature\n\nWith great responsibility comes great power.\n\nRuid 6 years ago#5\n\nSega Systems are where sports gamers went. When Sega stopped making consoles, sports fans went to Xbox.\n\ngoldenraven20 (Topic Creator)6 years ago#6\n\nI understand the Dreamcast to Xbox comparison also. Sports games, online, and the controller are obvious similarities (and Microsoft worked on the Dreamcast hardware), but there are also notable differences between the two to the point where the Xbox seems more similar to the N64 to me.\n\nFor one, about 1/4th of Dreamcast sales came from Japan. Compare that to the N64's roughly 15% of sales coming from Japan and the Xbox's abysmal 2%. A big part of the Dreamcast's appeal was Japanese arcade ports, fighters and shmups especially, which the N64 and Xbox lacked in comparison. Dreamcast was a much more Japanese-centric console than N64 or Xbox.\n\nThe Dreamcast also wasn't the strongest console of its gen, but it was a weird case where it almost falls in between two gens, so it was kind of both the strongest and weakest at different points in its lifespan.\n\nAnd there's no doubt the Dreamcast was the premier console for sports games for awhile, which the Xbox became after the Dreamcast died, but the N64 early in the 5th-gen was also the best for sports games too. There are several genres the N64 lacks almost completely, but sports games are definitely not one of them; they make up about a third of the N64's library, and they were almost always better than the equivalent PS1 versions.\n\nFerarri619 6 years ago#7\n\nI feel like both the Gamecube and Xbox were both successors to the Dreamcast in different ways.\n\nDreamcast/Xbox\n\n-Dreamcast and Xbox had the best online play on consoles for their generations.\n\n-Shenmue, Dead or Alive, Jet Set Radio, among others that I'm forgetting at the moment.\n\n-Large modding communities.\n\n-Hardware specs were best on their generations.\n\nDreamcast/Gamecube\n\n-The hardware is very similar. Both the DC/GCN have the same color LED light when power is on. Both also have a quick little jingle and colorful logo pop up on the screen when turning on the console. Even the insides of the consoles look similar if you take them apart.\n\n-Phantasy Star Online, Ikaruga, exclusive virtual life sims (Animal Crossing, Seaman), etc.\n\n-Both Dreamcast and Gamecube games are now expensive as hell compared to the other consoles in their generations. PS1 versions of non-exclusive games will still be way pricier on Dreamcast. Non-exclusive games on Gamecube will be way less expensive on PS2/Xbox than on Gamecube. Exclusive games are more pricey on Dreamcast/Gamecube than the exclusives on PS1, Xbox, etc.\n\n~Nintendo 64. Get N or Get out.

The N64 may have had decent support from Western developers (though the PS1 got even more Western games), but it still had a solid library of Japanese games. Xbox barely got any Japanese games. And with the N64, many of the Western games were still clearly inspired by Japanese games, while almost all of the Western games on Xbox were thoroughly Western in design and style. As someone with a strong preference for Japanese games, the Xbox has very little to offer me.\n\n\"I am sexy minority. OH! NO! I wanna be a sexy terminator. Sexy will never die. AH~~~~~!\""
