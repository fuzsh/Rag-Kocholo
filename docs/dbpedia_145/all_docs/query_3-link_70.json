        "text": "The aim? The player character is a human in a village of animal neighbours. You start the game by arrive in a new place and gradually develop your village. Day to day activities include embellishing the island, making new items and finding bugs, fossils and fish. As well as finding a way to repay your house loan to local tanuki entrepreneur Tom Nook…\n\nSounds open ended? It is! The game intentionally has making friends, everyday tasks and the slow passing of seasons in its themes. And players can shape their village, game and playing goals in the way they see fit.\n\nThis first game was called Dōbutsu no Mori. It is usually translated into English as Animal Forest.\n\nFirst released on an N64 cartridge in April 2001, Nintendo later released an enhanced version of Eguchi’s game for their new GameCube console.\n\nInitially available in Japan, it was then translated into English for its release in the USA in 2002. But players in Europe would have to wait until the end of 2004 before the game was launched there and they could meet Tom Nook in person…\n\nOver the years, there have been many new versions of Animal Crossing, for different Nintendo console and handheld systems. This included the 3DS, mobile phone, the Wii and the Nintendo Switch. They could feature setting up a village in a forest, a camp, or…an island!\n\nFor instance revious versions have included a variety of settings and formats, such as Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp, a 2017 mobile relase of the game as well as Animal Crossing: New Leaf released on the 3DS, which allowed for the character to become the mayor of their small town of villagers."
