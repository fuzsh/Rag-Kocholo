        "text": "Ethnic group\n\nGerman Bolivians are Bolivians of full, partial, or predominantly German descent, or German-born people residing in Bolivia.\n\nWaves of immigration\n\n[edit]\n\nGerman immigrants began to arrive in Bolivia in the 18th century, and many more arrived in the 19th century.[3] During World War II, Bolivia ceased diplomatic relations with Germany and expelled many Germans.[3] Many German Jews immigrated to Bolivia during the war.[4] Inti SA, Bolivia's largest pharmaceutical company, was founded by German immigrant Ernesto W. N. Schilling Huhn.[5]\n\nA substantial and growing part of the Germanic population in Bolivia are Plautdietsch-speaking Mennonites from Russia, who are of Dutch and Prussian descent. These Mennonites started to immigrate in the 1950s, with large waves of immigrants in the 1960s and 1970s, mainly from Mexico and Paraguay. In 2012 there were 23,818 church members in congregations of these Mennonites, indicating a total population of about 70,000.[6] The total population of German Mennonites in Bolivia was estimated at 60,000 by Lisa Wiltse in 2010.[7] See also: Mennonites in Bolivia.\n\nEducation\n\n[edit]\n\nGerman schools:\n\nDeutsche Schule La Paz\n\nDeutsche Schule Santa Cruz\n\nHistoric German schools:[8]\n\nDeutsche Schule Oruro\n\nDeutsche Schule Sucre\n\nNotable German Bolivians\n\n[edit]\n\nRonald Rivero Kuhn, footballer\n\nHugo Banzer, military officer, twice President\n\nGermán Busch, military officer and President\n\nLuciano Durán Böger, writer and poet\n\nEnrique Hertzog, physician and President\n\nPato Hoffmann, actor and theater director\n\nNoel Kempff, biologist and environmentalist\n\nJaime Mirtenbaum Zenamon, classical guitarist and composer\n\nAlberto Natusch, military officer and dictator\n\nErwin Sánchez Freking, footballer\n\nAchim von Kries, German military officer\n\nBlanca Wiethüchter, writer and poet\n\nJorge Wilstermann, aviator\n\nLidia Gueiler Tejada, politician (the first female President of Bolivia, and the second woman in the Americas to ever become chief of state).\n\nLuis Gamarra Mayser, singer and songwriter\n\nRodrigo Mendoza Heinrich, American War Hero\n\nPedro Kramer, Historian and diplomat\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nBolivia–Germany relations\n\nImmigration to Bolivia\n\nMennonites in Bolivia\n\nHistory of the Jews in Bolivia"
