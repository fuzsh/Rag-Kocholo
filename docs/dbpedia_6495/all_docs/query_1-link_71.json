        "text": "Do you need a VISA to enter Bolivia?\n\nIf you are planning to visit Bolivia, you may have to get a Bolivia visa beforehand. The tourist visa requirements depend on your nationality. The Bolivian government has organized the visa policy for all countries into 3 different groups:\n\nGROUP 1: You do not require a visa or need to pay any kind of fee upon entering Bolivia for visits of up to 30 days. Once in Bolivia, you can extend your stay for up to 90 days. The only requirement is that you present a valid passport with a minimum validity of 6 months.\n\nGROUP 2: You need to apply for a visa either at a Bolivian embassy or directly at the border. Verify the entry requirements and fees with the nearest Bolivian embassy of consulate. Sistema de Solicitud Visas (cancilleria.gob.bo)\n\nGROUP 3: You must apply for a visa IN ADVANCE and can ONLY apply for one directly at a Bolivian embassy. Verify the entry requirements and fees with the nearest Bolivian embassy of consulate. Sistema de Solicitud Visas (cancilleria.gob.bo)\n\nCheck what group you’re in using this list: LISTA DE PAÍSES | Dirección General de Migración (migracion.gob.bo) / Visa policy of Bolivia – Wikipedia or check this passport index.\n\nIf you are having doubts whether or not you need a visa, we recommend contacting the Bolivian embassy or consulate in your country.\n\nIf you need to apply for a visa (countries of group 2 and 3), you will have to fill out a Visa Affidavit form. When taking a trip with us we can provide a letter of invitation.\n\nALL foreigners visiting Bolivia are required (this is a mandatory requirement) to register for the Bolivia enter registration form (SIGEMIG). This is a traveler location form where foreigners can register their accommodation details. This can be done prior to arrival in Bolivia. If you want to complete it before arrival you can find the online registration form here. Make sure to print out a copy of your registration and bring it with you. (Sigemig form tutorial in Spanish)\n\nFor US citizens: U.S. citizens need a visa to enter Bolivia for tourism. This VISA for US citizens is valid up to 10 years, allowing multiple entries. A tourist visa can be obtained at a Bolivian Embassy or Consulate in the United States or neighboring country. In addition, a tourist visa can be purchased at any land or air border. Check the VISA requirements here or the Bolivian embassy info (boliviawdc.org)\n\nVisit or contact the Bolivian Embassy or nearest Consulate for the most current visa information. Check this list with consular offices contact information.\n\nFor citizens of Mercosur member countries: Bolivia also allows certain nationals from countries from South America (Mercosur countries: Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay, Perú, Venezuela, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana and Suriname) to enter the country without a passport. In this case, you will only need your national ID.\n\n(Ciudadanos de países del Mercosur viajan con carnet o pasaporte sin necesidad de visa. Ver: https://migracion.gob.bo/autorizacionturismovisita)\n\nImportant notes:\n\nYou need to submit the required documents both in electronic format and paper format.\n\nDo you need a certificate of yellow fever vaccination? Yellow fever vaccine may be required at entry point, if visiting endemic areas.\n\nDo you need a certificate of Covid vaccination? The COVID vaccine is no longer mandatory when entering Bolivia.
