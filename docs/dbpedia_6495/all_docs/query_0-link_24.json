        "text": "Bolivia is a beautiful and diverse country, famous for its extraordinary landscapes, rich culture and fascinating history. Located at the heart of South America, Bolivia borders six countries and is considered one of the most ethnically diverse countries in South America. From the Andes, through the Amazon, to the sunny Altiplano. Bolivia offers unforgettable experiences.\n\nIn this article, we take a closer look not only at Bolivia’s language, but also at its history, culture, political system and everything you need to know before travelling to this country. Read on!\n\nContents\n\nBolivia\n\nBolivia is a South American country bordered by Brazil to the east, Peru to the north and west, Chile to the southwest, Paraguay to the southeast, and Argentina to the south. The largest city and the biggest economic centre of Bolivia is La Paz, but the historic city of Sucre is the constitutional capital. The country’s government is also located in La Paz. The official name of the country is the Plurinational State of Bolivia.\n\nMoreover, Bolivia has a rich, diverse culture and history. The country was home to many pre-Columbian civilizations, including Tiwanaku and then the Inca Empire, which conquered much of what is now Bolivia.\n\nGeography of Bolivia\n\nBolivia is also characterized by a diverse landscape. To the west, the Andes Mountains rise, and to the east, the land slopes down to lowlands. The Bolivian Plain is home to lush equatorial forests and tropical plains. In the mountains, climate is significantly cooler, with large differences in temperature between day and night and between seasons.\n\nIn the east of the country, in the valleys of the Amazon and Beni rivers, climate is tropical, hot and rainy. The equatorial forests of Bolivia there host numerous exotic species of animals that prefer a humid climate. Jaguars, capybaras, caimans, and tapirs are just a few examples.\n\nThe highest peak in Bolivia is Sajama, a mountain reaching a height of 6542 m above sea level. In Bolivia, there is also the largest salt lake in the world – Uyuni. Lake Titicaca is one of the highest lakes in the world. The largest rivers in Bolivia are Mamoré, Beni and Guaporé. Bolivia is also one of the two landlocked countries in South America.\n\nPolitical system\n\nThe state’s political system is a presidential republic. Bolivia’s constitution establishes a tripartite separation of powers between the legislative, executive, and judiciary branches.\n\nExecutive power is exercised by the office of the president. The president is elected by universal suffrage for a five-year term, without the possibility of re-election. He is the head of state, and his powers include directing state policy, representing the country on the international stage, and appointing ministers.\n\nLegislative power is vested in a bicameral parliament. It consists of the Chamber of Deputies, whose 130 members are elected for five-year terms, while the Senate consists of 36 senators, also elected for the same period.\n\nJudicial power is exercised by the Supreme Court, the Constitutional Court and lower courts.\n\nOver the past few years, Bolivia has experienced political and social instability related to the controversial 2019 presidential election and subsequent protests. As a result, in 2020 there was a change of power and the appointment of a provisional government, which held presidential elections in November 2020.\n\nAdministrative division\n\nIn Bolivia, the administrative division distinguishes two administrative units: larger departments and smaller provinces. The nine departments of Bolivia are (departmental capitals in brackets): Chuquisaca (Sucre), Cochabamba (Cochabamba), Beni (Trinidad), La Paz (La Paz), Oruro (Oruro), Pando (Cobija), Potosí (Potosí), Santa Cruz (Santa Cruz de la Sierra) and Tarija (Tarija).\n\nEconomy\n\nEconomically, Bolivia is unfortunately not a highly developed country. It is largely centred around the mining industry. The most important export commodity of the country is tin. When in the 1980s there was a drastic drop in its prices, Bolivia experienced an economic collapse, resulting in a sharp increase in inflation and foreign debt. The second-largest economic sector is agriculture.\n\nBrief history\n\nThe area that is currently Bolivia was inhabited by several highly developed civilizations, such as the Tiwanaku and the Incas, in pre-colonial times. In 1532, Spanish conquistadors led by Francisco Pizarro conquered the country, established governments, and imposed their culture and religion. For the next three centuries, Bolivia remained under Spanish rule until gaining independence in 1825.\n\nAfter becoming an independent state, Bolivia became a republic and went through many political and social changes. In 1952, there was a national revolution that brought many social changes, such as land reforms, the right to vote for women, and the introduction of health and education for all. Unfortunately, Bolivia did not gain political stability over the next decades. In 1964, there was a coup d’état that effectively stopped the reforms, and the army seized power. Today, Bolivia is formally a democracy, but it still struggles with many problems.\n\nSpanish language in Bolivia\n\nSince the area of modern Bolivia was inhabited by pre-Columbian cultures for at least 20,000 years, the country still has a very diverse population. It consists of numerous ethnic groups, including Quechua, Aymara, Guaraní, and Mestizos. The official language is Spanish, but many other indigenous languages are also spoken.\n\nThe Spanish language spread in through country during the colonization of South America. The Spanish colonizers who settled in Bolivia brought their regional dialects with them. Despite this, the language spoken in Latin America differs from that in Spain. In the old continent, the national standard of pronunciation is the North Castilian dialect, and in South America, seseo pronunciation is preferred.\n\nBasic Spanish phrases\n\nBasic Spanish phrases will come in handy not just in Bolivia, but in a number of other countries.
