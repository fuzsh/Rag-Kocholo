        "text": "As a first-generation Latina in the U.S., I often hear, “Really, you don’t look Cuban.” Maybe it’s my light skin or my name. “Estacie” doesn’t exactly translate very easily. Perhaps it’s the other person’s familiarity with Cuban actors or musicians. Or maybe it is the way I speak English.\n\nI often respond in Spanish “Si, soy Cubana,” knowing I am possibly opening myself up to a language duel—or quizas muchas preguntas.\n\nYou see, the thing about language proficiency is that it isn’t a proxy for language preference or choice. Meaning: how and when I choose to speak Spanish or how well you might think I speak English, isn’t representative of my personal language preference for connection. And for nearly three-fourths of all Latinos in the U.S. who speak Spanish, engaging in our language is un privilegio and a choice, not a necessity.\n\nSo what does this engagement look like? Latinos today are demanding engaging, fresh, culturally relevant, and nuanced content on trusted platforms that value the unique U.S. Hispanic experience. This is so much more than just serving up “Spanish-language content”. It is our collective demand for meaningful, representative content that delivers a bridge to our culture; serving up a place to feel seen, and be seen in content. Interestingly, it is incredibly difficult to find that special combination outside of the Spanish language ecosystem.\n\nLet me explain. Much of the content Latinos are seeking is in Spanish, regardless of their “primary” language. For example, in our Spring 2021 national radio panel, we see that a full 74% of Hispanics who listen to Tejano music are English dominant, along with 40% of listeners of Latino Urban, with 69% of listeners of Spanish Tropical Format identifying as bilingual. Spanish language content doesn’t only draw in Spanish speakers. We see this phenomenon in TV too, where in 2021, a Spanish language show hit the top 10 list for all streamed content for all audiences in any language.\n\nAll in all, 37% of all the impressions from Hispanic viewers to Spanish language content in May 2021 were from English-speaking Hispanics. That’s more than 50 million impressions, showing how Spanish language programming delivers more than in language programming—it delivers a world where Hispanics, of any language proclivity, find relevance and community.\n\nAnd if those examples of the power of Spanish language content to deliver engaged English speakers aren’t enough to convince you, look to social media to see the growing Spanish language presence all over English speakers’ social media feeds. Young U.S.-born Hispanics are influencing today’s most newsworthy and fun trends, by sharing Spanish-language content ushering its cross over to general market pop culture. Late last year the popular “no me importa” remixes on TikTok or the “Mi Mujer Me Gobierna” dance remixes on Instagram Reels, each with millions of views flooded your English-language feed. This is happening because the meaning—that specific sentiment—can only be expressed in Spanish; so we share it leading to its consumption by English and Spanish speakers alike."
