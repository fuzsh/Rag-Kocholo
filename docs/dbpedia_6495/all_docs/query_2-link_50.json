        "text": "Hello again! Today we are going to learn how to ask for personal details, such as nationalities. As you can see below, nationalities can change depending on gender. We are going to divide the adjectives in three categories: first, adjectives ending in –o (male) and –a (female), for instance “mexicano – mexicana”.\n\nThe second ones, male adjectives ending in –s. In this case you might add –a to turn it into a female adjective, for example, inglés (male) inglesa (female). In third place, we have unisex adjectives, when the nationality adjective is the same for both genders, like canadiense (for men and women coming from Canada).\n\nHave a look at the following explanation:\n\nA noun is a word used to denote a person, place, thing or idea.\n\nPerson: John, girl, dentist\n\nPlace: garden, university, Venezuela\n\nThing: book, car, tomato\n\nIdea: liberty, despair, intelligence\n\nIn Spanish, all nouns are either masculine or feminine.\n\nNouns that end in -o are usually masculine. Nouns that end in -a are usually feminine. One cannot predict the gender of a noun that stands for a non-living thing.\n\nExceptions\n\nThere are many exceptions to these rules, that you can learn just by practice. A few examples:\n\nel día\n\nel planeta\n\nel mapa\n\nel idioma\n\nel problema\n\nel sofá\n\nOk! Now you can travel the world! The Spanish language is the second most spoken language in the planet, after Chinese and before English. Wherever you go, you’ll can tell others what your nationality is and understand theirs."
