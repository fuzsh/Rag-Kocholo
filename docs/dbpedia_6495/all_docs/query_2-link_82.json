        "text": "by Diego Guillermo Diaz\n\n\"In this blog post, I describe how languages like Basque, Nahuatl, Quechua, Guarani, and Fang have contributed to the development and expansion of Spanish(es).\"\n\nSpeak in a “Neutral” Accent, Please!\n\nWith more than 543 million speakers in so many places, it’s no surprise that there’s more than one way to speak Spanish. My sister and I grew up in Los Angeles with parents who taught us Spanish words such as ¡che! (hey!), morfi (food), remera (t-shirt), quilombo (mess), and piba/e (girl, boy). Truly, Spanish has always been a part of my life but it took me till about the age of 11 or so to realize that I don’t just speak Spanish, I speak Argentinian Spanish.\n\nLearning to speak Spanish this way has kept me in touch with friends and extended family in Buenos Aires. Middle school was where I took my very first Spanish language class.\n\n​One day, it was my turn to read aloud from the textbook. Afterward, my teacher came to me and asked that I use a “neutral” accent when reading, since some of the students weren’t familiar with the “different accents in Spanish.”\n\nIt was the first time anyone told me my Spanish was different. I couldn’t understand why I had to change the way I spoke.\n\n​​Ever since then, that interaction inspired me to pay closer attention to all things language-related. I have become motivated to learn new languages and explore linguistic diversity.\n\nFor the better part of the last 15 years, I’ve dabbled in a number of languages, and listened to and watched hours of language-related podcasts and YouTube videos. More recently, I even completed an introductory linguistics course at my local community college (with Prof. Thomas) – I just can’t get enough of languages!\n\n​And it has amazed me to learn that, while Spanish’s historical link to Latin is well noted, its ongoing relationship with numerous Indigenous languages on different continents remains under-appreciated.\n\nAn official language in at least 21 countries, Spanish has developed numerous, unique varieties (dialects) across several parts of the globe. This wide diversity results from Spanish’s historical and ongoing contact with many other languages.\n\nSo, if words of Latin origin only make up about 75% of all Spanish vocabulary, where do the rest of the words come from?\n\nAnd what are some of the languages that have influenced Spanish?\n\nIn honor of Hispanic Heritage Month and Native American Heritage Month, as well as Indigenous Peoples’ Day–and basically our collective survival of Pandemic Year 2021–I want to take you on a journey through a few of the languages that have, and continue to, transform Spanish. In this blog post, I describe how languages like Basque, Nahuatl, Quechua, Guaraní, and Fang have contributed to the development and expansion of Spanish(es).\n\nSpanish as a Tool of Colonial Empire\n\nSometimes, many of us today forget that Latin America is multilingual, and that there still exist many places where people don’t speak Spanish at all. Rather, Indigenous languages, such as Quechua (of South America) and Nahuatl (of Mexico and Central America), or Afro-Indigenous languages like the creole language Palenquero (of Colombia) and Garifuna (of Central America and the Caribbean), continue to be spoken despite the reach of Spanish.\n\nThe present-day language situation stems from how, centuries ago, missionaries from Spain saw it as their duty to interrupt Indigenous civilizations, and Hispanicize local peoples through conversion to Catholicism and Spanish-dominant society.\n\n​Very quickly, language became a central tool of the Spanish empire, though not without enduring resistance from Indigenous peoples, or the many millions of Africans enslaved in service to Spanish wealth extraction. Added to these centuries-long processes in settler colonialism, were also processes of language contact.\n\n​Some Indigenous languages only contributed a few words to a particular region or country’s variety of Spanish, while others have had a bigger impact and have mutually influenced Spanish–particularly its sound system (phonology) and vocabulary (lexicon).\n\nBut even long before it dispersed from the Iberian Peninsula, Spanish was influenced by Basque, Greek, Arabic, and varieties of Celtic and Germanic languages. Iberian (Castilian) Spanish was later spoken by soldiers, missionaries, and settlers during their incursions into Aztec, Inca, and other Indigenous empires. With time, as Spanish was spoken by multilinguals of Indigenous and African languages, it began to shift.\n\nSo, what are some of the languages that have transformed Spanish over the years? And what are some of the words and phrases that have resulted from this language contact?​\n\n9 Languages That Have Influenced Spanish\n\n(1) Basque has been spoken in Spain and France since before the times of the Romans, before Latin ever reached the area. It is known as a language isolate, meaning it is unrelated to any other known language. The Royal Spanish Academy recognizes up to 95 Basque loanwords, including izquierda (left) and mochila (backpack).\n\nThere are also several common Spanish last names that are in fact Basque in origin. Today it is considered “vulnerable” with estimates at around 750,000 speakers, but revitalization efforts have been underway for decades.\n\n(2) Taíno belonged to the Arawakan language family spoken in most of the Caribbean. As one of the first languages encountered by European outsiders in the Americas, many words of Taíno origin were adopted into Spanish (and English!), like canoa (canoe), tabaco (tobacco), and huracán (hurricane).\n\nColonization and genocide pushed the language into inactive use within 100 years of European contact. Nevertheless, many place names owe their origin to Taíno, including Jamaica, Haiti, Bahamas, Cuba. ​\n\nThough the language was never written down and hasn’t been spoken in centuries, there are current revival efforts taking place - you can even find Taíno lessons on YouTube!​\n\nLanguage and borrowings into Spanish\n\nApproximate number of speakers*\n\nPresent-day country/region\n\nQuechua (all varieties)\n\nchoclo, palta, ojota\n\n8 to 12 million\n\nPeru, Ecuador, Colombia, Bolivia, Chile, Argentina\n\nGuaraní (all varieties)\n\n​maracuyá, piraña\n\n5 to 12 million\n\nParaguay, Brazil, Bolivia, Argentina, Colombia, Peru, French Guiana\n\nMayan (all varieties)\n\ncigarro, chamaca/o\n\n6 million\n\nMexico, Guatemala, Belize, El Salvador, Honduras\n\nNahuatl (all varieties)\n\ntomate, chocolate, cacahuate\n\n2.6 million\n\nMexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, Nicaragua\n\nAymara\n\nalpaca, chinchilla\n\n2.2 million\n\nBolivia, Peru, Chile, Argentina\n\nFang\n\nabaá\n\n1 million\n\nEquatorial Guinea, Gabon, Cameroon, Rep. of Congo, São Tomé & Príncipe\n\nBasque\n\n​izquierda, mochila\n\n750,000\n\nSpain, France\n\nMapuche\n\n​poncho\n\n250,000\n\nChile, Argentina\n\nTaíno\n\ntabaco, huracán\n\nNo longer actively spoken\n\nCaribbean\n\n(3) Nahuatl is often referred to as “the language of the Aztecs,” but Modern Nahuatl is actually a macrolanguage, with varying dialects spoken in Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, and Nicaragua and the second most spoken language in Mexico after Spanish. Over 4,000 words of Nahuatl origin were absorbed by Spanish speakers and made their way into other languages of the world, like tomate (tomato) and chocolate (chocolate).\n\nOther Nahuatl words are used mostly in Mexico or Central America, such as elote (corn), cacahuate (peanut) and papalote (kite, but originally butterfly).\n\nThe word Mexico is also of Nahuatl origin.\n\nThere are currently between 1.5 and 2.6 million speakers of Nahuatl's many varieties.\n\nDespite a recent reform that legitimized 68 Indigenous languages as official in Mexico, Indigenous communities continue to be marginalized. Some of Mexico's Indigenous languages have already gone dormant, leading experts to predict severe endangerment for those that remain.\n\n(4) K’iche’ is just one of the 30 languages making up the Mayan language family, andthe second most spoken language in Guatemala after Spanish. In total, there are some 6 million native speakers of Mayan languages found in Guatemala, Belize, El Salvador and parts of Honduras and Mexico.\n\nMayan influences on Spanish vary. While a word like cigarro (cigar) is widely understood across Spanishes, and has been borrowed into other languages, chamaca/o (child) is not used as widely.\n\nIn addition, recent archaeological work confirms that cacao is actually Mayan in origin and was later borrowed into Nahuatl, previously believed to be the source of the word.\n\nK’iche’ is recognized as a minority language in Guatemala and seems to be experiencing a resurgence, with the increasing demand for interpreters in the U.S. and even a Spanish-K’iche’ radio show out of California, though it is considered to be “vulnerable” to extinction and other Mayan languages are “endangered.”​\n\n(5) Quechua is a language family that originated in the Andes Mountains and is known to many as “the language of the Incan Empire.”\n\nWith some estimates as high as 14 million speakers, Quechuan languages have the most speakers of any indigenous language or language family and are recognized as co-official with Spanish (and Aymara) in Peru and Bolivia.\n\nVarieties of Quechua can also be found in Colombia, Ecuador, Chile and Argentina.\n\nWords of Quechuan origin like llama are typical within Spanish and other languages, but other words are used exclusively in only a few South American countries: choclo (corn), palta (avocado) and ojota (sandal, flip-flop).\n\nBetween 2007 to 2017, Peru reported an increase in the number of Quechua speakers, from 3.36 million to nearly 3.8 million.\n\n(6) Aymara is spoken by up to 2 million people, primarily in Bolivia and Peru where it’s recognized as an official language, with speakers also in parts of Chile and Argentina.\n\nHaving existed in the same region for so long, Aymara and Quechua have influenced each other extensively, sharing many lexical similarities, often making it impossible to determine if a word is of Quechua or Aymara origin.\n\nTwo common words believed to be borrowings from Aymara are alpaca and chinchilla.\n\nTogether with the less than 800 total speakers of Jaqaru and Kawki, Aymara forms the Aymaran language family. Aymara is classified as “vulnerable”, while Jaqaru and Kawki are considered “endangered.”\n\n(7) Guaraní is unique, because in 1992, it became the first Indigenous language of the Americas to reach official status (alongside Spanish in Paraguay).\n\nWords of Guaraní origin include the country names of Paraguay and Uruguay, as well as maracuyá (passionfruit), ananá(s) (pineapple), and piraña (piranha)--words borrowed into dozens of languages around the world!\n\nThere are some 6.5 million speakers of Guaraní across Paraguay, Bolivia, Argentina and Brazil.\n\nAll varieties belong to the Tupí language family, made up of some 70 languages, with an estimated 12 million total speakers when we also include varieties spoken in Colombia, Peru and French Guiana.\n\n(8) Mapuche (or Mapudungun) is currently classified as a language isolate, spoken by around 250,000 people in mostly Chile but also Argentina. It is considered an “endangered” language. It has played a significant role in the development of the Chilean Spanish variety, with many lexical borrowings only used within Chile and over 300 words of Mapuche origin recognized by the Royal Spanish Academy. Mapuche has been heavily influenced by Spanish, as well as the Quechuan languages which, overall, have had a bigger impact on Chilean Spanish.\n\nMapuche has not received any significant government support and is only considered official in the Chilean commune of Galvarino, as of 2013.\n\nThe most widespread word of Mapuche origin is poncho, which has been borrowed into both Spanish and English. Many words for the flora, fauna and geographical features unique to the region also come from Mapuche. ​\n\n(9) Fang, a Bantulanguage of the Niger-Congo Family, is spoken by about a million people primarily in Equatorial Guinea (West Africa), a former colony of Spain, where Spanish has been the official language since 1844 (though briefly replaced by Fang during the 1970s).\n\nEven as Spanish is the language of education and administration in Equatorial Guinea, many people only use it as a second language.\n\nThe Royal Spanish Academy Dictionary contains over 50 words or guineanisms that the Equatoguinean variety has contributed to the Spanish language, including the Fang word abaá, a communal house for various religious, official and leisure activities.\n\nEquatorial Guinea is the only African country where Spanish is official. Still, there are other notable Spanish-speaking populations in Morocco and the Western Sahara, which remains formally occupied and ruled by Spain.​\n\nConclusion: All Languages Are Valid!\n\nThese are just some languages that have played a role in shaping the many forms that Spanish has taken around the world! And this is just the tip of the linguistic iceberg.\n\nThe numerous Indigenous words borrowed into Spanish are truly a testament to the significance of language contact. However, the road for Spanish has been heavily paved with linguistic injustice and discrimination that have led to the endangerment of countless languages.\n\nFor example, in addition to Palenquero(Colombia), there is also Chabacano, a creole language spoken in the Philippines, a result of Spain’s more than 300 years of rule. There’s Rapa Nui, an Austronesian language spoken on Easter Island (Chile), and Ladino or Judeo-Español, the 15th century language of Sephardic Jews expelled from Spain, which is still spoken today in various countries. Unrelated signed languages can also be found, including Mexican Sign Language, Nicaraguan Sign Language, and Argentinean Sign Language.\n\nWith the help of linguists, community members and social activists, huge strides are being made in recognizing, legally protecting, and revitalizing marginalized languages. There’s still so much room (and hope!) in the world for all languages.\n\nAuthor Bio:\n\nDiego resides in Los Angeles and works as an online Spanish instructor.
