        "text": "According to Ethnologue, 7,151 languages are spoken in the world today. The distinction between a language and a dialect can be a contentious topic, though. Just ask someone on the streets of Edinburgh, Scotland if Scots is a language or a dialect of English!\n\nThere’s also a difference between a language and an official language. Official languages aren’t just used by people to speak to one another; they’re used for for official purposes in a country’s government, schools, courts, national media, and so forth.\n\nSome places, like Japan, recognize only one official language (Japanese). Others, like India, have languages that are official in certain regions of the country (India has 23 of these). Zimbabwe holds the record for official national languages: 16.\n\nBut some countries may have hundreds of languages in use. The island nation of Papua New Guinea holds the record, with 840 spoken languages, many of which aren’t even related!\n\nWhat Are the 21 Languages Most Spoken in the World?\n\nThe world’s top 21 most spoken languages are (in order):\n\nEnglish (1.452 billion)\n\nMandarin Chinese (1.118 billion)\n\nHindi (602.2 million)\n\nSpanish (548.3 million)\n\nFrench (274.1 million)\n\nModern Standard Arabic (274.0 million)\n\nBengali (272.7 million)\n\nRussian (258.2 million)\n\nPortuguese (257.7 million)\n\nUrdu (231.3 million)\n\nIndonesian (199.0 million)\n\nStandard German (134.6 million)\n\nJapanese (125.4 million)\n\nNigerian Pidgin (120.7 million)\n\nMarathi (99.1 million)\n\nTelugu (95.7 million)\n\nTurkish (88.1 million)\n\nTamil (86.4 million)\n\nYue Chinese (including Cantonese) (85.6 million)\n\nVietnamese (85.3 million)\n\nTagalog (82.3 million)\n\nHow Many Languages Does the Average Person Speak by Country?\n\nThat’s a complicated question!\n\nSome countries have a lot of different languages! In these countries, people often speak the national language plus a local language. It may be more productive to look at multilingualism overall.\n\nFirst, about 43 percent of the world’s population is bilingual, that is, they speak two languages fluently. That’s about 3.3 billion people around the world. A lot of those people live in Indonesia, where most people learn Indonesian, Javanese, and English. It’s estimated that 200 million Indonesians alone are bilingual.\n\nBut when it comes to polyglots—people who speak three or more languages—only three percent of the world can claim that title.\n\nA few more places with high rates of bilingualism are:\n\nBrazil\n\nAustralia\n\nCameroon\n\nMexico\n\nChina\n\nThe United States\n\nIndia\n\nPapua New Guinea\n\nWhat Country Has 37 Languages?\n\nBolivia has 37 languages.\n\nLanguages Around the World\n\nSo, who speaks what and where? We’re glad you asked!\n\nThe list presented here comes from the CIA World Factbook, a widely recognized source of data on countries around the globe. The table below lists the official language of each country if there is one, as well as other languages spoken. In selected countries, the percent of the population that speaks each language is also given.
