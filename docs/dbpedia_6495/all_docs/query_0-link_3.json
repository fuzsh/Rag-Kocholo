        "meta_description": "Bolivia - Andes, Amazon, Altiplano: The three most important cities in the Valles are Cochabamba, Sucre, and Tarija—all founded in the 16th century. Each is surrounded by farms, fruit orchards, and dairy land. Cochabamba is the largest, busiest, and most accessible of the cities. Tarija is the most isolated—its mountain roads are tortuous, and the city has never been linked to Bolivia’s rail system. Its climate is milder than that of the Altiplano, however.  The Oriente is the largest and most sparsely populated region, with the exception of Santa Cruz, eastern Bolivia’s only major city, and its environs. Officially known as Santa Cruz de la",

        "text": "Ethnic groups\n\nThe population of Bolivia consists of three groups—Indians (indigenous people), mestizos (of mixed Indian and European descent), and people of European (mainly Spanish) descent. After centuries of intermixing, it is difficult to determine the proportion of each, but it is estimated that mestizos form more than two-thirds of the total, Indians make up about one-fifth, and people of European ancestry (whites) account for about one-twentieth of the population.\n\nThe largest Indian groups are the Aymara, Quechua, and Guaraní. The Aymara, who speak a guttural language, live mainly on the northern and central Altiplano. The Quechua, direct descendants of the Inca, are found in the southern Altiplano and on nearby mountains as well as in the valleys of Cochabamba, Chuquisaca, and Potosí. Guaraní communities, such as the Chimane, Mojeno, Guarayo, and Chiquitano, live in the lowland forests and savannas of southern Santa Cruz department, and the departments of Chuquisaca and Tarija. The great majority of Bolivian Indians are farmers, miners, and factory or construction workers. However, an increasing number have become professionals, and Aymara and Quechua political leaders have been elected to Congress. (Victor Hugo Cardenas, an Aymara from the shores of Lake Titicaca, served as vice president of Bolivia in 1993–97, and in 2006 Evo Morales, also an Aymara, became the country’s first Indian president.)\n\nIn the cities the mestizos, many of whom are either migrants from rural areas or their descendants, are well represented in the offices, trades, and small businesses. The traditional European minority—those of Spanish descent—have long formed the local aristocracy in small towns and rural areas. Their influence remains, although it has diminished since the National Revolution of 1952."
