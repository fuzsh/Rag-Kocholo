        "text": "Bolivia:\n\nBolivia is a landlocked country in South America. The constitutional capital of the country and the home of the Supreme Court is Sucre. The seat of government is La Paz. The largest city in the country is Santa Cruz de la Sierra. The metropolitan area of La Paz has a population of 1.8 million. Whereas, the population of Santa Cruz de la Sierra is 2.3 million. Bolivia shares its borders with Brazil, Paraguay, Argentina, Chile, and Peru. Bolivia has a multiethnic population of 11 million. Along with Asians, Africans, and Europeans, Amerindians, and Mestizos also live in this South American country.\n\nThe country was enjoying political stability until the year 1971 when Hugo Banzer Suárez, with the help of the United States’ Central Intelligence Agency, led a coup d’état against the government of Juan José Torres and established a military dictatorship. Juan José Torres was murdered by a death squad in 1976 in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Under the rule of Hugo Banzer Suárez, a number of Bolivian citizens were tortured and killed for their socialist and leftist leanings. Hugo Banzer was ousted in 1978.\n\nEducation in Bolivia is not the same in rural and urban areas. However, the country still has a very high literacy rate. According to UNESCO standards, Bolivia was declared free of illiteracy in 2008. The economy of Bolivia indicates that it is a developing country. It has a high human development index. President Evo Morales promoted bilingual education. Intercultural bilingual education gave indigenous communities a chance to be a part of the nation without giving up on their culture or language.\n\nThe country is rich in minerals including silver, lithium, and copper. Football is the most popular sport in the country. Before the country was colonized by Spain, the Andean region was a part of the Inca Empire. The Spanish colonization affected the indigenous languages of Bolivia. Bolivia is named after Simón Bolívar, who led various countries of the region against the Spanish Empire and helped them in winning their freedom.\n\nThe Indigenous Population of Bolivia:\n\nThe indigenous population of Bolivia is made up of different ethnic groups. These 3.5 million people live in different parts of the country. Evo Morales was the first indigenous president of Bolivia. His election was considered a win for all the indigenous people of the country. The promotion of Indigenous language education in Latin American countries have kept these old vernaculars from going extinct.\n\nAymara people are the biggest group of indigenous people in Bolivia. The majority of Aymara people live in the Lake Titicaca Basin. Standard Spanish has influenced most of the indigenous languages of Bolivia. But despite that, they continue to thrive in the country.\n\nThe Bolivian Language:\n\nSpanish is the official language of the country as well as the mother tongue of the majority of the population. 36 indigenous languages also enjoy official status in the Bolivian constitution. Out of these indigenous languages, Guarani and Aymara are the most popular. They are spoken by indigenous people in different parts of the country. Quechua languages are also spoken by the indigenous people of Bolivia. By giving official status to these languages, the South American country of Bolivia has protected them from going extinct. Indigenous vernaculars were spoken in various Latin American countries. But after the population of Spanish in the region, all of those languages faded.\n\nThe majority of Bolivian citizens speak Spanish as their native language. It is also the language of the Supreme Court and the government of the country. The variety of Spanish spoken by the Bolivians is known as Bolivian Spanish. It has different regional varieties. Spanish in Bolivia has been influenced by the varieties of the Castilian language that are spoken in the neighboring countries. Spanish pronunciation has also been influenced by regional and immigrant languages.\n\nSpanish, unlike the languages of different ethnic groups, is not restricted to one part of the country. It is the majority language everywhere in Bolivia including La Paz, Santa Cruz de la Sierra, and Sucre. It is the mother tongue of people in the Amazon Basin, the Andean region, and the Eastern lowlands. In short, you can find Spanish speakers everywhere in this country in South America. So, if someone talks about Bolivia language, you can be certain that they are referring to Spanish because it is the only one worthy of that title.\n\nWhat is the capital of Bolivia?\n\nThis is a question that confuses many people. Since both La Paz and Sucre are referred to as the capital of Bolivia, it can be confusing for outsiders to figure out the correct answer. In truth, there are two capitals of this country. La Paz is the executive and legislative capital of Bolivia, which means it is the seat of government. The national congress is also located in La Paz. Sucre, on the other hand, is the constitutional and judicial capital, which means it is home to the Supreme Court of the country. Although Santa Cruz de la Sierra is the largest city in the country, it is not the capital of Bolivia. La Paz is the home of the Bolivian government and the national congress, which means it is the capital where all executive decisions are taken. Whether you plan on visiting La Paz or any other city of Bolivia, don’t forget to learn a few Spanish phrases. You will find it easier to win the hearts of the people of this South American country."
