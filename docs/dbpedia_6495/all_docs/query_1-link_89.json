        "text": "As in many other countries of Latin America, the arrival of Spanish colonists caused, as time goes by, a certain number of population interbreeding and a mix of influences. That led to the huge ethnic diversity the country has now.\n\nBolivia is, with Peru, one of the South American country that has the most important proportion of indigenous population: 60% are Quechua or Aymara.\n\nSince the 70’s and 80’s, these populations have organized themselves a lot in order to vindicate their rights (the abolition of slavery was not until the 1952’s revolution…).\n\nWarning: it is to know that the Spanish term “indio” is very negatively connoted and is often understood as an affront.\n\nDespite the important indigenous presence, a white elite, coming from the Spanish colony, still has the stranglehold on the country’s affairs. The assumption of power of Evo Morales, first indigenous President of Bolivia and in Latin America has, to some extent, changed this status quo. A new policy direction is proposed to the country and despite everything, the world of finance and trade still in the hands of the white minority.\n\nBetween these two opposites, we have a very small minority of African black population, descendants of slaves brought from Africa, Asiatic emigrants (mainly Chinese) and some European groups, emigrated next to the World War II (Germans, Austrians, Italians), as well as Metis communities, resulting from the population mix.\n\nThis ethnic and cultural diversity is a great richness: cultural mixing (dances, art, gastronomy, literature, handicraft…) represent a plural identity and a permanent movement. At the same time, it represents an important weakness for the country, where blockages, social and economic conflicts take turns and proliferate."
