        "text": "This is a student teaching program for Education Majors. This is an excellent opportunity for students to apply methods learned at Pitt Greensburg or Pitt Johnstown to a real-world teaching experience! Students will spend half of the semester in Bolivia and the other half on their Pitt campus to complete their academics and to student teach. The student teaching placement is at Calvert CCS - Cochabamba Cooperative School, a local international school whose curriculum is primarily in English. Spanish language lessons on site throughout the program will allow students to gain or improve basic language skills which will create a better connection to their host community.\n\nDuring the program students will also get to visit two of Bolivia’s most famous sites. Students will take in the breathtaking scenes of South America's largest, and one of the highest in the world, natural lake, Lago Titicaca. In the Chapare, students will adventure through the Amazon, encountering monkeys, hiking through rainforests, and experiencing outstanding tropical fruits and foods.\n\nInterested students at the Greensburg campus should contact Dr. Melissa Marks, Director of Education, at mjm37@pitt.edu and/or Julie Shannon, jas1140@pitt.edu\n\nInterested students at the Johnstown campus should contact Dr. Bethany McConnell, Program Director, at bmm93@pitt.edu and/or Lauren Perri, lap140@pitt.edu\n\nBolivia is located in the heart of South America. It is a land locked country with the Andes Mountains to the west and the Amazon Jungle to the east. Our program takes place in the city of Cochabamba or “Llajta” (its name in Quechua). Surrounded by the spectacular Andes Mountains, this city is Bolivia’s third largest next to Santa Cruz to the east and La Paz to the west. During the Inca Empire, Cochabamba was used strictly as farmland to feed the entire Inca Empire. Remains from this empire provide an excellent opportunity for students to study this ancient civilization. In Cochabamba as well as in the other nine departments of Bolivia, the indigenous groups still practice their traditional customs such as the winter solstice, “Andean cosmovision” (Andean view of the earth), “koa” (ritual to Pachamama, Mother Earth), language, food, “Urkupiña” (a celebration to the virgin), and a “Cholita,” (a traditionally dressed woman). However, due to the Spanish Conquistadors in the 1530s, these indigenous cultures have been mixed with Spanish cultures. Bolivia is a very diverse country reflected in its languages, indigenous practices, politics, ethnicities, and customs. This makes Bolivia an interesting country. The Bolivian people are very proud of their country’s journey throughout history and keep alive their traditions which all too many countries have already lost to the Western World. Bolivia is an adventure within itself making it an amazing place to learn and grow.\n\nStudents will stay with a Bolivian host family arranged by Connect2Bolivia. Bolivian host families will offer the chance to not only learn about the culture but to immerse yourself in the language and improve your skills. Some meals will be provided by the host family. Homestays are in a safe location and are usually located nearby and close to shopping and areas of interest.\n\nYou can expect your housing to have the following:\n\nhomestay with a local family [NOTE: housing arrangements are subject to change]\n\nsome meals (breakfast and dinner)\n\nlinens and towels\n\ninternet in the home (may not necessarily be Wi-Fi)\n\nWe do our best to provide the most accurate information about housing and amenities, but due to the nature of the locations in which we offer programs and limited availability, these items are subject to change. Contact your program manager with any questions.\n\nThe Student Teaching in Bolivia program is suitable for Early Childhood Education, Secondary Education, or K-12 Spanish language education majors. Students will earn 8.0 credits while in Bolivia: Student Teaching Abroad (6.0 credits), Student Teaching Seminar (1.0 credit), Spanish (1.0 credit). The Spanish language course occurs throughout the student's time in Bolivia. All students must also enroll in the corresponding 6.0 credit U.S.-based Student Teaching course at their Pitt campus prior to departure for Bolivia.\n\nThe courses listed below are specific to Pitt Greensburg campus. If you are a Johnstown campus student, please consult your campus coordinator for the Johnstown course numbers.\n\nStudents are required to present their COVID-19 CDC vaccination card to our provider in order to participate in this program.\n\nStudents are required to present their Yellow Fever vaccination card when entering Bolivia. U.S. passport holders require a visa.\n\nGo beyond the classroom setting! In addition to student teaching, students will volunteer at a local youth center that enables children to go to school, and then receive extra help such as tutoring after school hours. This allows students to receive better grades and more opportunities in the future. The center also provides students with daily meals to make sure they are well-nourished and offers other activities such as sports. This is a unique opportunity to gain a better understanding of the culture, the language, and make a positive impact on the local community.\n\nStudents must enroll at Greensburg or Johnstown campus for the first half of the term and pay TUITION and FEES for part-time enrollment directly to Greensburg or Johnstown. This cost is in addition to the Bolivia Student Teaching program fees listed. See www.greeensburg.pitt.edu or www.johnstown.pitt.edu for current part-time tuition rates and fees. Students must be enrolled in corresponding Pitt student teaching course.\n\nSimilar to student teaching in Pennsylvania, it is important to show a clean record when student teaching abroad. For that reason, students must upload their FBI Clearances, Pennsylvania Child Abuse Clearances, and Pennsylvania Criminal Clearances to the Study Abroad Portal once accepted into the program.\n\nAs your body adapts to a new environment, you may find that you require a visit to the doctor from time to time. Doctor visits in Bolivia are generally inexpensive. However, you should plan to have enough money to cover any upfront healthcare costs (even when using your Pitt-provided ISOS insurance). If you have specific concerns, please reach out to your program manager."
