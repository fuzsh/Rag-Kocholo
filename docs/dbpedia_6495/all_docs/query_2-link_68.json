        "text": "Aymara\n\nPurintaxa – Welcome\n\nAymara (Aymar aru) belongs to the Aymaran language family. It is spoken by the indigenous Aymara people in Bolivia, Peru, Northern Chile, and Argentina (Ethnologue). The total population of Aymara speakers is estimated at 2.8 million people. It is believed that the original homeland of Aymara was Peru, and that the language later spread into neighboring areas of Bolivia, Chile and Argentina. Prior to the Spanish conquest of Peru in the 16th century, Aymara was spoken over a larger area than today having lost speakers to Spanish and Quechua.\n\nSome scholars have grouped Aymara together with Quechua because the two languages share about a third of their vocabulary. However, this may be due to borrowing rather than to a common origin of the two languages.\n\nStatus\n\nMost speakers of Aymara are also proficient in Spanish and/or Quechua.\n\nBolivia\n\nAymara Central with 2,098,000 speakers is the official language of Bolivia (Ethnologue). Efforts are underway to promote literacy in the language.\n\nPeru\n\nAymara is a language of a recognized nationality in Peru where where it is spoken by 442,000 people. It is considered to be potentially endangered because older speakers do not pass the language on to the younger generation. Several newspapers are irregularly published in Aymara. There are also a number of publications that carry Aymara literary writings, history, politics, and other informative materials. There are also some Aymara-Spanish texts used in bilingual education and literacy programs.\n\nArgentina\n\nThere are 30,000 Aymara in Argentina, some of whom came from Bolivia looking for work. The language is considered to be threatened since young people are switching to Spanish.\n\nChile\n\nThere are 19,000 ethnic Aymara in Chile, a third of whom have some knowledge of the language. Young people are switching to Spanish, hence the language is being threatened.\n\nDialects\n\nThere are three main varieties of Aymara (Ethnologue). They are mutually intelligible.\n\nAymara, Central spoken in Bolivia\n\nAymara Southern spoken in Peru\n\nJaqaru, a severely endangered member of the Aymaran language family, still spoken by 740 people in Peru.\n\nStructure\n\nSound system\n\nAymara has a relatively simple sound system that is similar to that of Quechua.\n\nVowels\n\nAymara has three vowel phonemes, i.e., sounds that distinguish word meaning. Vowels may be short or long which makes a difference in word meaning. In the table below, long vowels are marked with a colon.\n\nClose\n\ni, i:\n\nu, u:\n\nMid Open\n\na, a:\n\nConsonants\n\nAymara has 26 consonant phonemes. The table below shows the consonants of Central Aymara (based on\n\nNone of the stops or fricatives have voiced counterparts, e.g., there is /p/ but no /b/. In fact, there are no voiced-voiceless oppositions in native Aymara words. They can be found in Spanish loanwords.\n\nStops can be unaspirated, aspirated, or glottalized. Aspirated consonants are pronounced with a strong burst of air that accompanies their release. Glottalized consonants are pronounced with a complete closure of the glottis. They do not have any equivalents in English.\n\nStops unaspirated\n\np\n\nt\n\nk\n\nq\n\naspirated\n\npʰ\n\ntʰ\n\nkʰ\n\nqʰ\n\nglottalized\n\np’\n\nt’\n\nk’\n\nq’\n\nFricatives\n\ns\n\nx\n\nχ\n\nAffricates unaspirated\n\ntʃ\n\naspirated\n\ntʃʰ\n\nglottalized\n\ntʃ’\n\nTrill\n\nr\n\nNasals\n\nm\n\nn\n\nɲ\n\nLaterals\n\nl\n\nʎ\n\nSemivowels\n\nw\n\nj\n\n/q, x, X, ʎ / have no equivalents in English\n\n/tʃ/ = ch in chop\n\n/ɲ/ = first n in canyon\n\n/j/ = y in yet\n\nStress\n\nStress usually falls on the penultimate (next-to-last) syllable.\n\nGrammar\n\nAymara is an agglutinative, and to some degree, a polysynthetic language. The term polysynthetic means that there is a high ratio of morphemes per word. A word in a polysynthetic language can express a meaning which would require a whole sentence in many other languages, e.g., Kunjamaskatasa ‘How are you?’\n\nNouns and pronouns\n\nAymara nouns are not marked for gender, number or case.\n\nThere are four possessive suffixes that mark the possessed object and that must agree with the possessor, e.g., nayan utaja ‘my house,’ juman utama ‘your house.’\n\nLike Quechua, Aymara makes a distinction between inclusive and exclusive 1st person plural pronoun “we” as shown in the table below.\n\nSingular\n\nPlural\n\nnaya\n\nI\n\nnayanaka\n\nwe (exclusive)\n\njuma\n\nyou\n\njumanaka\n\nyou (all)\n\njupa\n\nhe/she\n\njupanaka\n\nthey\n\njiwasa\n\nyou and I (inclusive)\n\njiwasanaka\n\nyou (all) and I (inclusive)\n\nVerbs\n\nAymara verbs are marked for tense, mood, subject, and object. The tense and mood systems are fairly complex. There are hundreds of possible combinations of roots and suffixes.\n\nVerbs are marked for person, e.g., nayax utjta ‘I live/am living’ where both the personal pronoun and verb are marked by suffixes.\n\nTense: present, past, future; the language makes a distinction between recent and remote past.\n\nUnlike other languages, Aymara future tense refers to events that have occurred BEFORE the moment of speech.\n\nThe imperative is used in speaker-dominant situations, e.g., pisam! ‘weigh it!’ as in a marketplace. There are different suffixes that can modify the directness of a request, e.g., Pist’am! ‘Could you weigh it?’\n\nThe copula verb “be” is not used in equational sentences, e.g., Ch’uqix p’ujsawa ‘The potato (is) starchy.’\n\nWord order\n\nThe normal word order in Aymara is Subject-Object-Verb. Adjectives precede the nouns they modify.\n\nVocabulary\n\nBesides words shared with Quechuan languages, Aymara also has a substantial number of Spanish loanwords, e.g., lapisawa ‘pencil’ from Spanish ‘lapiz’, Winustiyas fom Spanish ‘Buenos dias’.\n\nBelow are some common Aymaran words and phrases.\n\nGood day Winustiyas (borrowed from Spanish), Aski urukipan (native Aymaran) Good bye Jakisiñkama Thank you Yuspagara Yes Jisa No Jani How are you? Kunjamaskatasa? Mother Tayca Father Auqui\n\nBelow are the numerals 1-10 in Aymara.\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\nmaya\n\npaya\n\nkimsa\n\npusi\n\nphisqa\n\nsuxta\n\npaqallqu\n\nkimsaqallqu\n\nllantunka\n\ntunka\n\nWriting\n\nUntil recently, Aymara had a form of non-standardized picture writing, used mostly to write Christian religious texts. This writing was originally produced on animal skins and later on paper. Today, Aymara is written with a Spanish version of the Roman alphabet. Many different spelling systems have been used over the years. In 1985, the Peruvian government introduced a new spelling system known as the Aymara Official Alphabet or Unified Alphabet.\n\nP p\n\nT t\n\nK k\n\nQ q\n\nPh ph\n\nTh th\n\nKh kh\n\nQh qh\n\nP’ p’\n\nT’ t’\n\nK’ k’\n\nQ’ q’\n\nCh ch\n\nChh chh\n\nCh’ ch’\n\nS s\n\nJ j\n\nX x\n\nL l\n\nLl ll\n\nM m\n\nN n\n\nÑ ñ\n\nR r\n\nW w\n\nY y\n\nI i\n\nA a\n\nU u\n\nÏ, ï\n\nÄ, ä\n\nÜ, ü\n\nTake a look at Article 1 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in Aymara Central.\n\n1.
