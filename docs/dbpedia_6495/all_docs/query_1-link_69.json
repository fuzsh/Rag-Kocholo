Students who consider themselves capable of higher-level performance may apply to the instructor during the first two weeks of the semester for more advanced placement. They may also be allowed by the department chair to be admitted for credit to a lower-level language course after consultation with the instructor. Students who have had three years or more of a language in high school and drop to first-semester level will not receive credit for the course. No course under 100 level may be taken for credit once a higher course has been passed.\n\nCourses in English\n\nThe department offers elective courses in English on literary, cultural, and social subjects listed under the rubric MLL. Most of these courses are cross listed with associated departments and interdisciplinary programs and count in their major and minor programs. These and many language courses count in many colleges as global and diversity requirements\n\nThe department offers elective courses in English on literary, cultural, and social subjects listed under “International Culture and Literature Taught in English.\"\n\nThese courses may, in most cases, be taken to fulfill preliminary distribution requirements. One of these courses may be included in the major.\n\nStudy Abroad and Travel Grants\n\nThe department encourages all students, especially majors and minors, to spend a summer, a semester, or a full year on an approved program of study abroad.

For the transfer of language and culture study credits for languages not offered at Lehigh, for example, Hindi, Italian, or Korean, credit in MLL 099, 199, 299, or 399 is available depending on the level.\n\nSummer or semester study abroad at approved programs may be incorporated into language majors and minors with the permission of the appropriate advisor to a maximum of 16 credits toward the major and 8 credits toward the minor."
