        "text": "Becoming fluent in Spanish is an invaluable skill that will open doors for you all around the world.\n\nWith over 490 million native speakers and 21 countries on four continents using Spanish as their official language, learning Spanish is one of the best new skills you can acquire.\n\nDepending on where you live, you may or may not come into contact with Spanish speakers frequently. What you may not know is that Spanish â just like English â is a global language that is spoken all over the world.\n\nAnd thatâs part of what makes Spanish so exciting. Learning it will allow you to communicate with people from more than just a few places â youâll be able to expertly interact with locals from over 20 different countries!\n\nSo, whether youâre already planning your next trip or simply want to see how far learning Spanish can get you, here is a list of all the Spanish speaking countries.\n\nSpanish speaking countries map, latest data, flags and capitals\n\nSpanish is spoken in many places beyond just Spain and Latin America. If youâre studying Spanish online, you may not be aware of just how global Spanish is.\n\nThe geographic reach of the language is what makes Spanish an incredibly diverse language. Thatâs why people from Argentina use vos while people from Mexico use tÃº. Itâs also why thereâs so much Spanish slang, which makes the language all the more interesting.\n\nRefer to our tables below where Spanish is an official language as well as their respectiveÂ flags, capitals, populations and more. Weâve also included some of the countries where Spanish is not an official language but still has a significant Spanish speaking population.\n\nTo complement the data, we've also numbered each country individually on our exclusively-created Spanish speaking countries map, embedded above, so you have the literal full picture.\n\nThe following data on Spanish speakers comes from El EspaÃ±ol: Una Lengua Viva, a report on the Spanish language published by Instituto Cervantes. Demographic data comes from the United Nations World Population Prospects 2019 report.\n\nSpanish speaking countries in Africa\n\nDid you know that there is a country in Africa that uses Spanish as its official language? Equatorial Guinea (officially RepÃºblica de Guinea Ecuatorial) is a small country on the west coast of Africa with over one million Spanish speakers.\n\nCountry Flag Capital Population % of population whospeak Spanish natively 1. Equatorial Guinea ð¬ð¶ Malabo 1,225,377 74%\n\nSpanish speaking countries of South America\n\nAs you may already know, South America is the region with the most countries that speak Spanish. With nine Hispanic countries, no other region on our list has as many different nations that use Spanish as the official or national language.\n\nHowever, that doesnât make it the continent with the most Spanish speakers. If you add up all the Spanish speakers in North America (including Central America and the Caribbean), you end up with about 30 million more speakers living in North America than South America!\n\nCountry Flag Capital Population % of population whospeak Spanish natively 2.

Uruguay ðºð¾ Montevideo 3,485,151 98.40%\n\nSpanish speaking countries of Central America\n\nWith the exception of Belize, every single country in Central America uses Spanish as the official language. And even though Belize uses English as its national language, more than half of its population can speak Spanish.\n\nSo, if youâre looking for a region where Spanish is consistently spoken across borders, thereâs no place like Central America.\n\nCountry Flag Capital Population % of population whospeak Spanish natively 11.

Mexico is also the country with the most Spanish speakers in the world, with more than twice as many Spanish speakers than Spain.\n\nWith that said, Mexico is still a very diverse country in terms of languages, with the Mexican Government recognizing 68 national languages. Some of these are Nahuatl, Maya, Zapotec, and Mixtec.\n\nCountry Flag Capital Population % of population whospeak Spanish natively 17. Mexico ð²ð½ Mexico City 128,972,439 96.80%\n\nSpanish speaking countries of the Caribbean\n\nThe Caribbean only has three island nations whose official language is Spanish. However, that doesnât mean Spanish isnât widely spoken all over the Caribbean. In fact, the two non-Hispanic countries with the largest proportion of Spanish speakers are in the Caribbean. Can you guess which ones? Keep reading to find out!\n\nCountry Flag Capital Population % of population whospeak Spanish natively 18. Cuba ð¨ðº Havana 11,317,505 99.80% 19.

Thanks to both migrants and Spanish learners, many countries in every single continent have plenty of Spanish speakers (except Antarctica, unless a penguin or two enroll in our Spanish for beginners lessons).\n\nCountry Flag Continent Capital Population No. ofSpanish speakers % of populationwho speak Spanish United States ðºð¸ North America Washington, DC 331,002,651 56,757,391 17.15% European Union ðªðº Europe Brussels 447,007,596 27,242,000 6.09% United Kingdom ð¬ð§ Europe London 67,886,011 4,830,586 7.12% Morocco ð²ð¦ Africa Rabat 36,910,560 1,671,409 4.53% Canada ð¨ð¦ North America Ottawa 37,742,154 732,110 1.94% Brazil ð§ð· South America Brasilia 212,559,417 556,018 0.26% Australia ð¦ðº Oceania Canberra 25,499,884 492,069 1.93% Philippines ðµð­ Asia Manila 109,581,078 466,165 0.43% Algeria ð©ð¿ Africa Algiers 43,851,044 223,000 0.51% Belize ð§ð¿ Central America Belmopan 397,628 201,339 50.64% Israel ð®ð± Asia Jerusalem 8,655,535 175,000 2.02% Dutch Antilles ð³ð± Caribbean Willemstad 221,001 150,676 68.18% Switzerland ð¨ð­ Europe Bern 8,654,622 124,000 1.43% Japan ð¯ðµ Asia Tokyo 126,476,461 108,000 0.09% Aruba ð¦ð¼ Caribbean Oranjestad 106,766 83,064 77.80% Trinidad & Tobago ð¹ð¹ South America Port of Spain 1,399,488 70,401 5.03% Guam ð¬ðº Oceania HagÃ¥tÃ±a 168,775 60,582 35.90% Andorra ð¦ð© Europe Andorra la Vella 77,265 47,271 61.18% Norway ð³ð´ Europe Oslo 5,421,241 37,000 0.68% New Zealand ð³ð¿ Oceania Wellington 4,822,233 22,000 0.46% Western Sahara ðªð­ Africa Laayoune 597,339 22,000 3.68% US Virgin Islands ð»ð® Caribbean Charlotte Amalie 104,425 16,788 16.08% Turkey ð¹ð· Asia/Europe Ankara 84,339,067 16,000 0.02% Jamaica ð¯ð² Caribbean Kingston 2,961,167 8,000 0.27%\n\nCountries where Spanish is not an official language with the most Spanish speakers\n\nPerhaps to nobodyâs surprise, the United States is the non-Hispanic country with the most Spanish speakers. However, what you may not know is that the United States is the second country with the most Spanish speakers in the worldâsecond only to Mexico.\n\nThatâs right. With 56,757,391 native and non-native Spanish speakers, the United States has more Spanish speakers than even Spain!\n\nHere are the top 5 non-Hispanic countries with the most Spanish speakers:\n\nUnited States - 56,757,391 speakers\n\nFrance - 8,780,000 speakers\n\nUnited Kingdom - 4,830,586 speakers\n\nItaly - 3,704,863 speakers\n\nGermany - 2,081,013 speakers\n\nCountries where Spanish is not an official language with the biggest proportion of Spanish speakers\n\nIf what youâre looking for is not the countries with the most Spanish speakers but rather the ones where you have the highest chance of running into someone who speaks Spanish, then this list is for you.\n\nHere are the top 5 non-Hispanic countries with the most Spanish speakers:\n\nAruba - 77.8%\n\nDutch Antilles - 68.18%\n\nAndorra - 61.18%\n\nBelize - 50.64%\n\nGuam - 35.90%\n\nHow many people in the world speak Spanish?\n\nWorldwide, there are almost 493 million native Spanish speakers. Additionally, there are almost 100 million non-native Spanish speakers. That means there are a total of 591 million Spanish speakers worldwide.\n\nThat makes Spanish the fourth most popular language in the world after taking into account native and non-native speakers. The only languages with more speakers than Spanish are English, Mandarin Chinese, and Arabic.\n\nFun stats about where Spanish is spoken\n\nIf youâre just starting to learn Spanish, you may be curious as to where Spanish is spoken. Here are some fun and interesting facts about countries that speak Spanish that you may not know!\n\nThere are more native Spanish speakers than native English speakers. Spanish is the second language with the most native speakers, second only to Mandarin Chinese.\n\nMexico is by far the largest Spanish speaking country, accounting for over a quarter of the total native Spanish speakers worldwide.\n\nThe United States is the second-largest Spanish speaking country in the world.\n\nOver 24 million people are studying Spanish as a foreign language as of 2021.\n\nAlthough the number of Spanish speakers will continue to grow, the percentage of Spanish speakers worldwide will decrease to only 6.3% by the year 2100.\n\nFAQs about countries that speak Spanish\n\nHow many countries speak Spanish?\n\nThere are 21 countries around the world that use Spanish as their official or national language. Additionally, there are 14 countries with over one million Spanish speakers, making Spanish one of the most widely-spoken languages in the world.\n\nWhatâs the largest Spanish speaking country?\n\nMexico is the largest Spanish speaking country, with close to 130 million speakers. Over one-quarter of all native Spanish speakers in the world are from Mexico. About one in five Spanish speakers is Mexican, making the Mexican accent the most common one.\n\nHow many people in the United States speak Spanish?\n\nAs of 2021, there were 56,757,391 Spanish speakers in the United States. Of these, 41,757,391 speak Spanish as their native language, while 15 million speak it as a second or third language. This makes the US the second-largest Spanish speaking country in the world.\n\nIs Spanish a good language for business?\n\nYes, Spanish is absolutely a good language to learn for business. As the fourth most widely-spoken language in the world, speaking Spanish will allow you to communicate with people in most of Latin America as well as parts of Europe and parts of Africa.\n\nAccording to the Power Language Index, Spanish is the fourth most powerful language in the world. This index takes into account each languageâs geography, economy, communication, knowledge & media, and diplomacy to determine the rankings.\n\nFinally, Spanish is even more important for people in the United States. Not only are there more than 50 million Spanish speakers in the US alone, but Mexico is the largest trading partner of the US. With over $600 billion in trade, Mexico became the largest trading partner of the US in 2019.\n\nHowever, that doesnât even include the 20 other countries which speak Spanish. If all these countries were a trading block, they would be by far the largest trading partner of the US, even surpassing the European Union.\n\nWhat countries have the most Spanish students?\n\nAs of 2021, there are 15 countries in the world with at least 100,000 Spanish students. The countries with the most Spanish students are:\n\nUnited States - 8,079,799 learners\n\nBrazil - 5,237,155 learners\n\nFrance - 3,336,556 learners\n\nUnited Kingdom - 2,030,961 learners\n\nItaly - 897,624 learners\n\nWhat does Hispanic mean?\n\nAs an adjective, Hispanic refers to a country or culture that uses Spanish as its main language. For example, a Hispanic country is one whose official language is Spanish. Spain is a Hispanic country, while Mexico is both a Hispanic and a Latin American country.\n\nWithin the context of the US, Hispanic can also refer to someone who lives in the US and is of Latin American or Spanish descent. In this context, Hispanic refers to the personâs ancestry as opposed to their ability to speak Spanish.\n\nHow to memorize all the countries that speak Spanish\n\n1.

Learn about the history of Spanish colonization\n\nIf youâre not too familiar with Spanish history, you may not be fully aware of the extent of the Spanish Empire. Just as English is predominantly used in former British colonies (Australia, the US, Canada, South Africa, etc.), Spanish is also predominant in former Spanish colonies.\n\nAlthough the topic of Spanish colonization is too extensive to cover in this blog, you can watch the following 10-minute video on the Spanish Empire.

Youâll be able to interact with people, media, and ideas that you otherwise would not have been able to understand.\n\nWith that in mind, make sure to keep up your Spanish studies! No matter if youâre taking intensive classes every day or if you can only dedicate a couple of hours a week, the most important part is to keep moving forward."
