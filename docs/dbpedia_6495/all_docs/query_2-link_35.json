        "text": "Throughout most of written history, since the invention of writing by the Sumerian civilization, languages coexisted in relative harmony even when their speakers didn’t. Some thrived and others waned, yet there are no examples of systematic attempts (that we could find) to prohibit or extinguish a language during antiquity. It is mainly with the emergence of nation-states that some languages became designated as official while many others were discouraged, suppressed, or banned altogether. Such destructive policies towards languages and dialects seem to originate in Europe and are then spread globally during colonization, although one must keep in mind that the sheer volume of documentation centered on European history at the expense of all other civilizations often tends to produce an optical distortion. Linguists calculate that at the current speed, almost half of the world’s 7,151 languages will disappear before the end of this century. This timeline is an incomplete account of language politics in many parts of the world, starting roughly from the beginning of nation-states.\n\n1367: The first English law in colonized Ireland that specifically banned the use of the Irish language is enacted as Article III of the Statute of Kilkenny. The Article makes it illegal for English colonists in Ireland to speak the Irish language and for the native Irish to speak their language when interacting with them.\n\n1380: Under Olaf II of Denmark, Norwegian and Danish are used in education and administration in the Faroe Islands.\n\n1482: The Valencia Bible, the first bible in the Catalan language, is burned.\n\n1492: Gramática de la lengua castellana by Antonio de Nebrija is the first grammar book dealing with the Spanish language and the first grammar book of a modern European language to be published. The book is deemed “the companion of the Empire.” About his work, Nebrija notes in a letter to Isabella I, Queen of Castile: “After Your Highness has subjected barbarous peoples and nations of varied tongues, with conquest will come the need for them to accept the laws that the conqueror imposes on the conquered, and among them our language; with this work of mine, they will be able to learn it, as we now learn Latin from the Latin Grammar.”\n\n1535: The Laws in Wales Act decrees that English is to be the only language used in Welsh courts and that Welsh speakers are barred from holding public office.\n\n1536–1814: Danish gradually comes to dominate many sectors of Norwegian life, as an influx of Danish adminstrators there use their own language instead of Norwegian.\n\n1537: The Statute of Ireland – An Act for the English Order Habit and Language prohibits the use of the Irish language in the Irish Parliament. In 1541, further legislation is passed banning the use of Irish in the areas of Ireland then under English rule.\n\n1567: King Philip II of Spain makes the use of the Arabic language illegal.\n\n1570: King Phillip II of Spain declares Nahuatl the official language of the colonies of New Spain, in order to facilitate communication between natives and Spanish colonists.\n\n1633: Philip IV of Spain decrees that Roma people do not exist, effectively banning the Romani language and traditional culture.\n\n1652: The Dutch East India Company establishes a trading post in Cape Town. European colonizers (Afrikaners) moved to the Cape and gradually establish farms in the Dutch Cape Colony, which functions as a Dutch slave state.\n\n1650–1707: Ehmedê Xanî, a Kurdish intellectual, is considered to be the founder of Kurdish nationalism. Xanî stressed the importance of the Kurdish language within the ongoing struggle against the Ottoman and Persian empires.\n\n1697: Under Peter the Great in Russia, Belarusian loses its status as an official language and is banned from all court and state documents.\n\n1707–1716: La Nueva Planta decrees signed by Philip V, the king of Spain, constitute the first attempt to centralize several territories under a single administration. Imposed by force, Castilian Spanish becomes the exclusive language of the government, administration, publications, commerce, education, and religion, banishing Andalucian, Aragonese, Catalan, Galician, and other languages of Spain.\n\n1737: The Administration of Justice Act is passed by the Irish Parliament, forbidding the speaking of Irish within the courtroom and prohibiting the completion of legal documents in Irish. The Act imposes a financial penalty of £20 each time Irish is spoken in court.\n\n1757: Joseph I, King of Portugal, bans the indigenous Tupinambá language in colonized Brazil.\n\n1760–1764: The Savoy government replaced Sardinian with Italian in all sectors of public life. Prior to 1720, when Sardinia was ceded to the House of Savoy, the island was part of Spain, and Castilian, Catalan, and Sardinian languages enjoyed freedom in all domains.\n\n1770: King Carlos III of Spain issues a decree that prohibits the use of Indigenous languages in all colonies of Spain.\n\n1772: Following the First Partition of Poland, the lands that became part of the Prussian state under the reign of Frederick the Great are subjected to several measures of ethnic cleansing. The Polish language is replaced by German in administration\n\n1775: The Marquis of Pombal, a Portuguese diplomat, prohibits the use of Indigenous languages in Brazil.\n\n1782: The Rebellion of Túpac Amaru II, an uprising of native and mestizo peasants against the Spanish Viceroyalty of Peru, ends after two years of struggle. As a result of the uprising, Spanish colonial administrator José Antonio de Areche bans the Quechua language and most aspects of Inca culture.\n\n1789: The French Revolution begins. At first, the revolutionaries declare liberty of language for all citizens of the Republic; this policy is subsequently abandoned in favor of the imposition of a common language that was to do away with the other languages of France.\n\n1795/1806: Invasion of the Cape Colony by the British Empire as part of the fight for control over diamond and gold mines. Dutch farmers are forced to migrate towards the north, where they establish settlements in the interior of South Africa.\n\n1810: Hawai’i becomes a unified kingdom.\n\n1819: Prussian officials abolished Polish from courts and partially from schools, introducing educational programs in German.\n\n1831: The first residential school opens in Canada. The school system, funded by Canada’s Department of Indian Affairs and administered by Christian churches, is designed to deprive Indigenous children of their native languages and cultures by forcing them to speak English and cut ties with their communities.\n\n1837: In India, the British East India company forgoes Persian as the official language of government offices and the courts and replaces it with local vernaculars, primarily Hindi. In northern India, Urdu replaces Persian.\n\n1839–1842: The First Opium War between the Chinese Qing Dynasty and the British Empire. The conflict terminates through the Treaty of Nanjing, according to which the Qing Dynasty cedes Hong Kong to the British Empire. English becomes Hong Kong’s only official language of politics and administration.\n\n1842: Teaching Romanian in Bessarabia is forbidden.\n\n1848–1871: Unification of Italy.\n\n1850s: In the second half of the nineteenth century, speakers of languages other than German are labeled as Reichsfeinde or “foes of the [Prussian] empire.”\n\n––––By the 1850s, only about half of the population of Wales can speak Welsh, compared to almost 100 percent in the eighteenth century, partially due to the increased number of English-speaking migrants, but also because of the British government’s destructive policies aimed at eradicating the Welsh language.\n\n1851: Norway passes a law forcing Sámi schools to teach in Norwegian.\n\n1857: The September 19 issue of The Cape Argus, an English-language newspaper, describes Afrikaans as a “miserable, bastard jargon,” not worthy of being called a language, and advocates for the “atrocious vernacular” to be stamped out.\n\n1860: Speakers of Occitan form over one third of the French population. By 1993, discriminatory French policy has reduced this proportion to less than 7 percent, and then less than 1 percent by 2012.\n\n1864-1904: Books in the Lithuanian language are illegally published abroad and smuggled into Lithuania, where printing Lithuanian in Latin script is forbidden by the imperial Russian authorities. Lithuanian book smugglers are known as knygnešiai, or “book carriers.”\n\n––––Belarusian, Polish, and Lithuanian are banned in public spaces in the Russian Empire.\n\n1867: The Native Schools Act is established in New Zealand, creating a national system of primary schools, where instruction is to be conducted in English. The Act stipulates that it is the onus of Maōri communities to request a school, form a school committee, supply land for the school facilities, and pay for half of the building costs and a quarter of the teachers’ salaries.\n\n1868: Ezo Island is annexed by Japan’s Meiji government and renamed Hokkaido. As Japanese settlers colonize the island, the native Ainu are forced to attend Japanese schools and their language is banned.\n\n1873: German becomes the primary means of instruction in all Prussian schools in the Polish-speaking territories.\n\n1879: Japan annexes Ryukyu and begins a policy of forced Japanization. Ryukyuan languages are suppressed, and children are punished for speaking their native tongues in school. Today, the Ryukyuan languages are severely endangered.\n\n1880: The Second International Congress on Education of the Deaf is held in Milan. The conference declares that oral education is superior to manual education and passes a resolution to ban sign language in many European countries and the US. In 2010, at the 21st iteration of the Congress in Vancouver, the members issue a formal apology for the ban.\n\n​​1880–1902: Under US rule, the number of schools in Hawai’i where Hawaiian is the language of instruction drops from around 150 to zero.\n\n1880s: Polish schooling is banned in the Russian Empire.\n\n––––German East Africa, a colony spanning territories of present-day Burundi, Rwanda, and Tanzania, is founded. German colonists start the process of de-Arabization, relying on Swahili in administration and encouraging its spread by developing an educational program and creating teaching materials. The Swahili word for school, shule, is a borrowed word from German. Although German is taught at schools, Swahili is the medium of instruction. Today, Swahili is a predominant and official language in numerous East African countries.\n\n1881: Under Alexander II, the Russian Empire becomes an immense multilingual state with over 150 linguistically distinct groups. The Tsars pursue a policy of ruthless assimilation of ethnic minorities: Alexander II prohibits the use of Ukrainian in all schools, theaters, and public performances until 1919, and Belarusian is prohibited until 1905.\n\n––––Jules Ferry Laws in France. Educational reforms aimed at improving literacy rates in rural areas make free primary education compulsory. Any languages other than French are forbidden, even in schoolyards, and any transgression is severely punished.\n\n1885: Mandatory use of Russian in Baltic governance.\n\n1887: Esperanto, an international auxiliary language, is created by Warsaw-based ophthalmologist L. L. Zamenhof. It is intended to be a universal second language to improve communication between nation-states and prevent wars.\n\n––––The United States of America Indian Affairs Commissioner bans Native languages in schools.\n\n1890s: Russian becomes the language of instruction at all schools in the Baltic countries.\n\n1892–1907: At tribal schools in Kurdistan, the teaching of Kurdish, “the barbarian language,” is forbidden. The sole medium of education is Turkish.\n\n1893: United States troops invade the Hawaiian Kingdom without just cause, which leads to a conditional surrender by the Hawaiian Kingdom’s executive monarch, Her Majesty Queen Lili’uokalani.\n\n1895: Taiwan becomes a dependency of Japan after Japan’s victory in the First Sino-Japanese War, and Japanese becomes the island’s official language. By 1941, nearly 60 percent of Taiwanese can speak Japanese.\n\n1896: Teaching and learning in Hawaiian is banned by Act 57, Section 30 of the Laws of the Republic of Hawaiʻi. ​​The use of Hawaiian is from now on restricted to the recitation of the Lord’s Prayer during chapel services.\n\n1898: Norway and Sweden pass laws that completely forbid the use of Sámi in the education system.\n\n1899: The Philippine-American War ends in victory for the United States. As a result, the US declares English to be the primary language of education, ending the centuries-long usage of Spanish. The change does not go into widespread effect until after WWI, when major Catholic universities phase out Spanish in favor of English.\n\n1900: The Language Manifesto, a decree by Nicholas II, makes Russian the language of administration in Finland.\n\n1901–1902: Wrześia children strike in response to the banning of the Polish language in schools. Pupils refuse to participate in class activities, for which they are punished with detention or beaten up. Their parents are arrested by the Prussian police, and the strikes are eventually suppressed.\n\n1905–1970: Australian government agencies carry out a campaign of forced removal of Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children, now known as the Stolen Children, relocating them to church missions where they are punished for speaking their native languages. In some regions, it is estimated that one in three Indigenous Australian children was forcibly removed in this manner.\n\n1908: The Kurdish Society for Cooperation and Progress is the first political Kurdish organization to advocate for a political, social, and economic awakening of Kurdistan. They issue newspapers and publications that highlight the importance of developing the Kurdish language. The organization does not, however, support the idea of an independent Kurdistan.\n\n1910: The Union of South Africa is created as a self-governing dominion of the British Empire. Only Dutch and English become the official languages of the new country.\n\n––––Japan bans Korean and forces Koreans to adopt Japanese names.\n\n1913: The Commission on the Unification of Pronunciation is established by the new government of China, with an aim to create national standards for written and spoken language use. During the talks, there is great disagreement between the delegates as to which variant of Chinese should be chosen as the basis for the new standard. Eventually, the northern dialect of Mandarin Chinese becomes the language of the Republic, though several others, including Manchu, Mongolian, Tibetan, and Uyghur, are recognized as national languages.\n\n1914: World War I begins.\n\n1917: Declaration of Rights of the People of Russia. Lenin believes in absolute freedom and equality of nations and languages and in self-determinism. He aims to reinvent post-tsarist Russia as a multilingual state.\n\n––––In the United States, the Trading with the Enemy Act (50 USC Appendix) passes in June, suppressing the American foreign-language press and declaring non-English printed matter unmailable without a certified English translation.\n\n––––As the United States enters WWI, German is banned in a number of states.\n\n1918: The world’s first Kurdish newspaper is published in Cairo and distributed for free. Due to the language ban in the Ottoman Empire, the newspaper has to be illegally smuggled in.\n\n––––The use of German in Alsace-Lorraine is forbidden.\n\n––––The Armistice of Villa Guisti ends warfare between Italy and Austria-Hungary. The region’s transferal to Italy marks the beginning of the linguistic genocide of the Slavic-speaking population.\n\n––––During the Weimar Republic, ethnic minorities receive protection, and the previously employed methods of severe linguistic discrimination come to a temporary end.\n\n––––Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia gain independence, and the majority-spoken languages become the official state languages of the newly independent states.\n\n––––In an effort to standardize the language, Estonia implements policies that exclude the use of South Estonian in education. South Estonian is diachronically a separate branch of Finnic language from North Estonian, which serves as the basis for modern standard Estonian.\n\n1919: The Dictionary of National Pronunciation is published in China.\n\n1920s: At the end of WWI, the British take control of Tanganyika, the mainland part of Tanzania, and English becomes the official language of the country. Swahili is accepted only in administrations at the provincial or district level. The use of Swahili as a language of instruction in education becomes limited to the first five years of primary school. English is introduced as a subject in the third grade and replaces Swahili as a medium of instruction in secondary school and in higher education. Swahili is available only as a subject.\n\n––––Nativization/Indigenization in the USSR. The writing system of several languages is changed to Cyrillic in an attempt to “unify” the languages. Only languages with long-standing literatures, such as Georgian and Armenian, escape this trend. The Romanization/Latinization of Arabic script affects, among other languages, Azeri, Kazakh, Turkmen, and Uzbek. The USSR operates on a hierarchy of four types of languages:\n\nA. Small languages without scripts of the tiny and territorially scattered ethnic groups: mostly in Siberia. Education and literature should be created in Russian.\n\nB. Small to medium-sized languages without their own scripts of territorially ununited agricultural peoples. Political propaganda, literature, and primary schools in native languages; secondary education in Russian.\n\nC. Medium-sized to large groups using traditional scripts. Everything in native language. Russian shall be introduced no later than the third grade.\n\nD. Bigger languages with their own literatures, typically coinciding with more economically developed nationalities: Ukrainian, Lithuanian, Latvian, Azeri, Georgian, Uzbek, etc. Russian shall be introduced no later than the third grade.\n\n––––Gradual territorial dismemberment of the Ottoman Empire, culminating in the Treaty of Sèvres, according to which Kurds are to be given local autonomy with the right to appeal for independence to the League of Nations within a year. The treaty, however, is never ratified and is later replaced by the Treaty of Lausanne, which considers arguing for separation of any part of Turkey to be a crime.\n\n––––Following the treaty and annexation of the Austrian Littoral (later Julian March) by Italy, the new government starts a harsh process of Italianization of the region: three political parties are banned; around seven hundred Slavic-language institutions are closed (youth and sport clubs, social and cultural institutions, libraries, businesses, banks and other financial institutions, etc.); thirty-one newspapers and journals are forbidden. Also, 488 Slovene and Croatian primary schools are closed.\n\n1921: Members of the Omoto religion in Japan adopt Esperanto as their official language.\n\n––––The rise of Reza Shah Pahlavi in Iran, who believes in the “one nation, one language” policy. Persian (Farsi) is chosen as the only official language, and the use of Turkish is banned. Students who speak Turkish in schools are fined.\n\n––––New York state institutes English literacy tests for voters.\n\n––––The state of Louisiana bans the use of Cajun French from its school systems.\n\n1922: The end of the Ottoman Empire.\n\n1922–1943: Italy under fascist rule led by Prime Minister Benito Mussolini. During his dictatorship, oppressive means are employed to eradicate all other languages but Italian. Numerous war crimes are committed by Italian fascists to transform German- or Slavic-speaking regions into ethnic Italian territories.\n\n1923: Croatian and Slovene are banned from administration in fascist Italy.\n\n1924: Turkish Constitution: Article 12 states that citizens who do not speak and read Turkish cannot become members of parliament.\n\n––––Lenin dies.\n\n––––Belarusian is banned from use in the upper echelons of government and education. Belarusian history is revised to create a single Belarusian-Russian narrative. No more publishing, theater, movies, lectures, choirs, etc. in Belarusian.\n\n––––In the United States, the Immigration Act of 1924 slows immigration from the non-anglophone countries of Europe to a trickle and denies admission to anyone from just about everywhere else (Asians are banned completely, and, in the debate over the bill, Jews are singled out as particularly unassimilable).\n\n1925: The Dutch language is replaced by Afrikaans as the official language of South Africa.\n\n––––The Committee on Unification of the National Language in China decides to adopt the Beijing variant of Mandarin as the new national language.\n\n––––French politician and scholar Anatole de Monzie, as minister of public education, states that “for the linguistic unity of France, the Breton language must disappear.”\n\n1926: The First All Union Turkological Congress held in Baku mandates the Latin alphabet for all Turkic languages.\n\n––––Italianization of German, Slovene, and Croatian names. Claiming that they would be returned to their original form, foreign first names and surnames are amended to sound Italian. After World War II, many of the oppressive laws are lifted, and the ideology of forced Italianization is abandoned. South Tyrol is granted autonomy within Italy on the grounds of its peculiar linguistic situation.\n\n1927: The Communist Party of the Soviet Union recognizes the danger of “petty bourgeois nationalism.” Widespread regional languages with their own literatures are perceived by Stalin as dangerous and capable of their own nationalisms that need to be repressed so as not to pose a real threat.\n\n1928: The Latin alphabet is adopted for writing Turkish in place of Arabic script. The goal is to further undermine the influence of religious leaders and break ties with the Ottoman past. The expected increase in literacy is supposed to aid in the spread of the concept of the nation.\n\n––––In Germany, the Minorities School Act allows children to receive education in their native tongue.\n\n1929: Decree of the Central Executive Committee of the Communist Party of USSR: the use of Arabic script is prohibited and its proponents are seen as class enemies. All publishing houses are ordered to cease printing in Arabic\n\n1930s: In Tanzania, the Language Committee is founded to standardize and promote the development of Swahili.\n\n––––In the USSR, Azerbaijani, Kalmyk, and smaller languages of Siberia shift to Latin-based scripts, though they return to Cyrillic by the late 1930s.\n\n––––The Sun Language Theory is developed as a pseudoscientific nationalist theory, according to which all human languages originate from Turkish. The theory claims that Sumerians were Turks who originated in Central Asia and developed language as a response to being awe-struck by the sun. The sun, as a deity, was the first thing to which a name was given, and all words were derived from this spark of language creation. This conception of Turkish history gains some following and is taught in some schools.\n\n1932: Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia. Approved by 99 percent of voters, the Statute is the first to implement autonomy for Catalonia and make the Catalan language the co-official language of Catalonia, along with Spanish.\n\n––––Under the military dictatorship of Prime Minister Plaek Phibunsongkhram, Thailand enacts the Primary Education Act, which makes Thai the compulsory language of instruction. Following ongoing protests by Thai Chinese, in 1939, the government allows students to learn in Mandarin for a maximum of two hours per week.\n\n1933–1945: Nazi Germany under Adolf Hitler.\n\n1934: The XVII Communist Party Congress in USSR mandates the end of the nativization campaign and a shift from Latin to Cyrillic scripts. This also marks the start of a deliberate Russification policy.\n\n––––The Constitutional Convention in the Philippines sets 1940 as the date by which Spanish will cease to be the official language of the legislature and courts.\n\n1936: Stalin’s constitution. According to Stalin, the USSR is made up of approximately sixty nations, nationalities, and ethnic groups (during Lenin’s time this number was 180). Of seventy-one different alphabets previously in use, only eight were not “unified.” Unification of alphabets was seen as an integral measure toward developing the international language of the proletariat. A proposal is advanced to write Russian in the Latin alphabet, but the peak of the movement has already passed, and the proposal gains little support.\n\n––––Following the example of Catalonia, the Basque Country and Galicia implement the Statute of Autonomy of the Basque Country and Statute of Autonomy of Galicia, granting the Basque and Galician languages, respectively, co-official status together with Spanish.\n\n––––The Spanish Civil War begins.\n\n––––Italian becomes compulsory in schooling and public life on the Dodecanese islands, which are ruled by Italy between 1912 and 1945. Greek becomes an optional subject at schools.\n\n1938: Compulsory teaching of Russian is decreed by the Central Committee of the Communist Party for all students of all nationalities in the USSR.\n\n––––The Mingrelian language is abandoned in favor of Georgian.\n\n1939: World War II starts.\n\n––––Military dictator Francisco Franco comes to power in Spain. During his regime, use of other languages in Spain, such as Catalan and Basque, is banned outside of the home, prosecuted, discouraged, or frowned upon. Castilian is declared the sole official language of Spain.\n\n––––The Yiddish newspaper Der emes (The Truth), which was published in Moscow, is closed. Only seven Yiddish newspapers are left, compared to an estimated 170 periodicals in 1917.\n\n––––Sōshi-kaimei is a policy of pressuring Koreans under Japanese rule to adopt Japanese names.\n\n1940s: Cyrillic script is used for almost all languages in the Soviet Union. A handful of exceptions: Armenian and Georgian have their own scripts; Karelian retains Latin script; Yiddish uses a modified Hebrew script; Estonian, Latvian, and Lithuanian (occupied and annexed to the Soviet Union in 1940) use Latin script.\n\n––––More than one million people of all ages in Brittany speak Breton as their main language.
