        "text": "Bolivian Spanish Translations: Respecting National Pride\n\nBolivians are intensely proud of their country, which they regard to be the heart of South America. Like all Spanish-speaking countries in South America, Bolivia has its own variant of the language. Bolivian Spanish incorporates regional dialects that differ from the Spanish spoken in places such as Peru and Colombia in terms of grammar, syntax, and phonetics. Creating best-in-class Bolivian Spanish translations means respecting the nuances of language variants and ensuring every piece of written content is culturally, socially, and linguistically accurate and appropriate. Around 40% of the population lives in rural areas – a blend of Spanish and Quechua is spoken in the valleys for example. Literacy is comparatively low, and radio is a major disseminator of news, which means that awareness of popular expressions is vital. Our Bolivian Spanish translators are mother-tongue speakers and have either lived, worked, or spent a significant period of time in Bolivia. We know all the peculiarities of Bolivian Spanish – like the misappropriation of the English word full to mean ‘well equipped’, instead of the Spanish Ileno. Or the fact that Bolivia is also the only place that refers to altitude sickness using the word soroche. We also know that while a significant proportion of organisations and businesses use tu and tuteante verb forms for the familiar second-person singular, voseo rather than tuteo is the norm for written and oral communications.\n\nTechnically Accurate Bolivian Spanish Translations\n\nThe Absolute Translations team is made up of highly skilled and experienced translators and linguists with qualifications in a range of different fields, which gives us the ability to produce technically brilliant Bolivian Spanish translations on subjects ranging from deforestation and soil erosion to human rights issues and the effects of renationalising oil and gas industries. Only our translators with the appropriate knowledge and experience are selected to create your content. Their skill and expertise is bolstered by the latest translation memory software, which identifies and saves repeated words and phrases. Meaning we only charge for each individual translation once, cutting the cost of your translations in both the short and long-term."
