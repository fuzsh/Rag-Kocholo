Spanish-speaking patients, for example, have disease (e.g., musculoskeletal diseases, pesticide poisoning, cervical cancer, HIV/AIDS), mortality, and pain burdens at least twice as high as English-speaking patients. At the same time, they have been disproportionately affected by infectious diseases such as the tuberculosis outbreaks or the COVID-19 pandemic. These facts make language a crucial concern for the improvement of health among Latinos in the US. Students in this course examine the relationship between language, health care, and health among Spanish speakers in the US through the dual lens of sociolinguistics and public health. We consider the effect of linguistic and discursive practices on access to health information and examine some of the measures currently in place to improve the transmission of health information across language boundaries.

Students will analyze \"El Movimiento\" through various levels of linguistic and social analysis: structural linguistics (phonetics, phonology, morphosyntax, lexicography, etc.), discourse analysis, sociocultural and linguistic anthropology, critical race theory, and feminist & queer theory.
