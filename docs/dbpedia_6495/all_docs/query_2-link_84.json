        "text": "To understand the origins of the Quechua language, we have to go back in time to a territory currently in Peru and Ecuador know as Chinchay.\n\nThe inhabitants of this area, the Chancas, were a coastal people heavily involved in trade whose economic interests allowed them to interact with other peoples in the north who also used their language, Quechua, as a means of communication to buy and sell products.\n\nThe name Quechua, which some academics think means “temperate valley,” alludes to the ethnic group that lived in the high basin of the Río Pampas in Apurimac, considered to be the original speakers of this language and key to its spread.\n\nThe History Of The Quechua Language\n\nThe Incas, originally from Titicaca, moved to Cuzco speaking their own language, Pukina. When they arrived in the valley of Cuzco, the migrants from Titicaca underwent some distinct linguistic changes. First they had to learn Aimara, the dominant language of the time. After the war with the Chancas, who brought Quechua to Cuzco, they had to gradually start learning Quechua. The definitive step to Quechua came with the last Incas Huayna Capac and Atahualpa.\n\nWhen the Incas started their expansion, Quechua was already spoken throughout the territory of Peru, but they were the ones who started to spread it to the southeast.\n\nIn 1575, Toledo declared Quechua, Aimara and Pukina as official languages of Peru, and as the main languages for evangelization. When this declaration was made, the Pukina speakers were already speaking Quechua or Aimara more and more, which is why Quechua and Aimara remained while Pukina only exists in a few religious catechisms.\n\nQuechua Grammar\n\nTo understand the Quechua language, you have to keep two aspects in mind: the form that words take and how they’re ordered in a sentence. It’s an agglutinating and suffixing language, which means it has a set of suffixes that are added to a root or main word to make it a longer, complete word, like this:\n\nwasi — house\n\nwasiy — my house\n\nwasiyki — your house\n\nwasin — his/her house\n\nwasinchik — our house\n\nwasicha — little house\n\nwasichaykichik — their little house\n\nwasichaykichikkuna — their little houses\n\nAs for its syntax, it’s a language that generally orders its sentences starting with the subject, then the object and then the verb, although this can change.\n\nHere’s an example:\n\nMichi huk’uchata hap’in — The cat chases mice (Michi: cat; huk’ucha: mice; hap’i: chases. Each word has its own case and inflection.)\n\nOther examples:\n\nqari — man\n\nqarim kani — I am a man\n\nwarmi — woman\n\nHuk warmim kani — I am a woman\n\nqari warma — boy\n\nHuk qari warmam kani — I am a boy\n\nAs for adjectives, they always come before the noun:\n\nyuraq hatun wasi — big white house\n\nQuechuan Words\n\nMany of these words are also used in Spanish.\n\nachachay — feeling cold\n\nayayay — feeling pain\n\ncautchouc — rubber (caucho in Spanish)\n\nchakra — farm, field (chacra in Spanish)\n\nchuqllu — corn\n\nchullu — hat\n\nchupi — soup\n\nkancha — court or field for playing sports (cancha in Spanish)\n\nkarka — dirt\n\nkarpa — tent (carpa in Spanish)\n\nkinuwa — quinoa\n\nkhena — flute\n\nk’umpa — hammer\n\nkuntur — condor\n\nllama — llama\n\nmati — mate (a type of tea)\n\nmichi — cat\n\nnanay — lullaby (nana in Spanish)\n\nñatu — someone with a small nose (ñata in Spanish)\n\npalta — avocado\n\npampa — plain\n\npapa — potato\n\npita — thread\n\npuma — puma\n\npunchu — poncho\n\npuna — mountain grass\n\nputu — jug\n\nsapallu — squash (zapallo in Spanish)\n\ntáchu — bucket\n\ntaita — father\n\nwanu — guano\n\nwáwa — small child\n\nwik’uña — vicuña (an animal)\n\nwincha — measuring tape\n\nyapa — something extra (ñapa in Spanish)\n\nSpanish Words That Quechua Adopted\n\nQuechua speakers had to use words from the conquistadors’ language to talk about objects or actions that they couldn’t describe or name in their own language, for example:\n\navión — aviun (“plane”)\n\nburro — burru (“donkey”)\n\ncaballo — cauállo (“horse”)\n\ncarro — carru (“car”)\n\ncuchillo — cuchillu (“knife”)\n\nferia — firia (“festival”)\n\nhigo — iwus (“fig”)\n\niglesia — iglesia (“church”)\n\nmisa — missa (“mass”)\n\nmula — mula (“mule”)\n\nplátano — latanus (“plantain”)\n\nplaza — plaza (“town square”)\n\nvaca — waca (“cow”)\n\nDid You Know?\n\nQuechua only has the vowels a, i and u.\n\nThe Quechua language adds suffixes to words to express friendliness and emotions.\n\nMost words have an accent on the next to last syllable, and the tilde is used in more than just a few specific words.\n\nQuechua doesn’t have gender markers on words. Instead, they use modifying words.\n\nQuechua doesn’t have any diphthongs.\n\nThe letter h is pronounced like in English: hatun (big)\n\nThe letter q is pronounced like a double h: qaway (hhaway, to look)\n\nAs you can see, Quechua is an ancient language full of history, culture and tradition. Like other languages, such as Nahuatl, it’s still a living language and hasn’t disappeared."
