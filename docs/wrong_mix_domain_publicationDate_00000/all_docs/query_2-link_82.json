        "text": "I think neither the published order nor the chronological order do the series justice.\n\nI always have recommended the series in the following order:\n\nI, Robot (some lists omit this, but this is really the \"origin\" story of this universe - The Complete Robot can be substituted here, since it contains the same stories as I, Robot)\n\nThe Elijah Baley series (which obliquely tells the story of Earth's first robotic forays into space)\n\nThe Galactic Empire trilogy (since these 3 books are unconnected to each other, besides taking place in the same general universe, this series can really be read in any order)\n\nThe original Foundation Trilogy\n\nFoundation's Edge\n\nFoundation and Earth (To me, that is really marks the end of the best of the work, and you can stop there. Or, you can proceed to the later additions to the series, which I find do not hold up as well as the others.)\n\nPrelude to Foundation\n\nForward the Foundation\n\nThe reason I like this order is that it preserves the chronology of the reader's discovery of the story. Neither the publication order nor the pure chronological order do this - Prelude and Forward are far weaker entries, and remove some of the mystery the first-time reader would have going into the first Foundation book. Part of the enjoyment of the Foundation novel is that you don't know who Seldon is, in those opening scenes on Trantor, or what role he's going to play in the story. If you read Prelude and Forward first, you'll already have an earful about Trantor and Seldon before you get to Seldon's introduction through Gaal Dornick's eyes in Foundation. I'm also completely ignoring the non-Asimov entries, which in my opinion don't add much to the series.\n\nIf you've already read the original Foundation trilogy, I'd recommend going back to the other series before finishing with Foundation's Edge and Foundation and Earth.\n\nFor those who have already read the books, I could see some merit in reading them chronologically, but for those who are new to the series, I highly recommend ignoring both the publication order and Asimov's own suggestion on reading order.\n\nI like to look at the series as the story of R. Daneel Olivaw, which results in me having a different order than most. For the sake of simplicity and focus, the robot short stories, the Empire novels, and the Caliban trilogy are left out as interesting, but non-essential.\n\nFirst, the four Robot novels should be read before the Foundation novels, in chronological/publication order:\n\nA) The Caves of Steel\n\nB) The Naked Sun\n\nC) The Robots of Dawn\n\nD) Robots and Empire\n\nAfter the Robot novels come the Foundation novels: seven by Asimov, plus the Second Trilogy by Benford, Bear and Brin. Some include the Second Trilogy, others don't. I prefer to include two of them, as I find they improve the overall story of Daneel. Foundation's Fear by Benford can be skipped entirely; it's disrespectful to the source material, adds almost nothing to the overall story, and is just not an enjoyable read.\n\nAs you said, the two common recommendations are to read these either publication order or chronological order. I have a third recommendation: start with the original trilogy, then read the prequels, and end with Edge and Earth.\n\nA) Foundation\n\nB) Foundation and Empire\n\nC) Second Foundation\n\nD) Prelude to Foundation\n\nE) Foundation's Fear (if you really must)\n\nF) Forward the Foundation\n\nG) Foundation and Chaos\n\nH) Foundation's Triumph\n\nI) Foundation's Edge\n\nJ) Foundation and Earth\n\nThis gives a good arrangement stylistically, with the earlier novels followed by the later ones. Asimov's writing style changes distinctly over time. It also gives a good arrangement chronologically, with the prequels foreshadowing the final two books, instead of explaining things you've already read about. (This can be compared to the Machete Order of viewing the Star Wars movies. But I digress.) And best of all, you end with the cliffhanger, instead of reading it and then reading 2-5 more books that don't resolve it.\n\nAnd if the cliffhanger bothers you, I wrote a conclusion which seems to be well-liked.\n\n1st bunch - read the Foundation trilogy - Foundation, Foundation and Empire, Second Foundation - and iRobot, it doesn't matter if you read iRobot or the trilogy first, either order.\n\n2nd bunch - Elijah Bailey trilogy - Caves of Steal, Naked Sun, Robots of Dawn).\n\n3rd - Galactic Empire Trilogy - adds to the series, but really optional, and a little jarring given that it is back to Foundation/iRobot quality writing. If you're going to read any of them, Pebble in the Sky is the most important by far, but less important than all the Foundation and Robot books.\n\n4th - Foundation Sequels (Foundation's Edge, and Foundation and Earth)\n\n5th - Robots and Empire\n\n6th - Foundation Prequels (Prelude and Forward) and I really disagree with an above poster, these books were excellent, and a great cap off of the entire Asimov universe. Don't read these before the others, as they will spoil things big time. They are prequels, in that they take place before the principal - but continue and end the story rather than add back story.\n\nThis list is based on Isaac Asimov's own list of the fictional order of his works, with one correction and one addition:\n\nThe Complete Robot (1982) Collection of 31 Short Stories about robots.\n\nThe Caves of Steel (1954) His first Robot novel.\n\nThe Naked Sun (1957) The second Robot novel.\n\nThe Robots of Dawn (1983) The third Robot novel.\n\nRobots and Empire (1985) The fourth (final) Robot novel.\n\nThe Stars, Like Dust-- (1951) The first Empire novel.\n\nThe Currents of Space (1952) The second Empire novel.\n\nPebble in the Sky (1950) The third and final Empire novel.\n\n\"Blind Alley\" https://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/title.cgi?41602[1]\n\nPrelude to Foundation (1988) The first Foundation novel.\n\nForward the Foundation (1992) The second Foundation novel. (Not in Asimov's list as it had not been written yet.)\n\nFoundation (1951) The third Foundation novel, comprised of 5 stories originally published between 1942-1949.\n\nFoundation and Empire (1952) The fourth Foundation novel, comprised of 2 stories originally published in 1945.\n\nSecond Foundation (1953) The fifth Foundation novel, comprised of 2 stories originally published in 1948 and 1949.\n\nFoundation's Edge (1982) The sixth Foundation novel.\n\nFoundation and Earth (1983) The seventh Foundation novel.\n\nThe list is based on Asimov's list of fictional chronological order in the forward to Prelude to Foundation With one correction. Asimov apparently put The Currents of Space before The Stars Like Dust by mistake.\n\nIn The Stars Like Dust everybody knows that the radioactive Earth was the original home world of humans. Only a part of the galaxy has been explored and colonized yet.\n\nIn The Currents of Space every region and every planet in the galaxy has been explored and most habitable planets have been settled for centuries or millennia. The planet Trantor, near the center of the galaxy, that probably was not even discovered in the era of The Stars Like Dust, has been settled for so long and advanced in population and industry so much that it has conquered half the galaxy. Nobody knows which planet Humans originated on - Earth is merely one candidate.\n\nAnd in Pebble in the Sky The Republic of Trantor has conquered and united all the galaxy and become the Galactic Empire. If I remember correctly the year is seven hundred and something of the Galactic Empire. Earthmen are the only people who claim that Earth is the original home of humans. At whe end of the story a project begins to remove earth's radioactivity.\n\nI'm not sure if the Galactic Empire in \"Blind Alley\" is the same one as in the Foundation series. But I guess it wouldn't hurt to read it. And it might have been referenced in one of the Foundation novels written after Asimov's death like Foundation's Fear (1997) by Gregory Benford, Foundation and Chaos (1998) by Greg Bear, or Foundation's Triumph (1999) by David Brin.\n\nIf i remember correctly \"Blind Alley\" is in year eight hundred and something of the Galactic Empire.\n\nSome people recommend reading Foundation (1951), Foundation and Empire (1952), and Second Foundation (1953) before Prelude to foundation and forward the foundation novels to avoid spoilers of surprises in those novels.\n\nThis list includes other works more or less in the Robots/Empire/Foundation series:\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation_series#Other_authors[1]\n\nOne more novel needs to be appended to these lists. Donald M. Kingsbury wrote, with the permission of the Asimov estate, a novel wich takes place in the new/Second Foundation Empire. The book is called Psychohistorical Crisis. It was published in 2001 and is a fantastic addition to the canon of Asimov's Foundation books.\n\nHere is information I got from the www.FantasticFiction.com site: https://www.fantasticfiction.com/k/donald-m-kingsbury/psychohistorical-crisis.htm\n\nDiscrepancies are explained as a result of an information overload. The further forward or the further back one goes using psychohistory, one gets more of a general overview with precise details being forgotten. There logically has to be a founder of psychohistory but more and more details are subsumed over time.\n\nTake medicine as an example. The Hippocratic oath is almost all we know of Hippocrates of Kos. Quoting Wikipedia: Historians agree that Hippocrates was born around the year 460 BC on the Greek island of Kos; other biographical information, however, is likely to be untrue. That's the history of one world with a time lapse of about 2600 years. Multiply that by the histories of hundreds of thousands of worlds and the advancements of hundreds of arts and sciences.\n\nHippocrates has an Oath. Pythagoras has a Theorem. Euclid has a type of geometry named after him. Can you tell me much more about these learned people without searching for information? That information has been subsumed into a larger picture."
