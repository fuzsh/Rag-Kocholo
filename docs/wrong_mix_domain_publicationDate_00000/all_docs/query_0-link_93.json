        "text": "************************************************************\n\nI will present the list below and you can also see it HERE. I estimated about 240 titles - Locus counted 237 so I was close - though considering that many are series, some like the Vorkosigan Saga or the Culture with quite a few volumes, the actual number of books is much larger.\n\nOf everything below I am familiar with almost all and read a fair number, opened but put down another fair number and of course stayed away from another fair number of them. There may be about 3 or 4 titles I do not have an opinion about since I have only vaguely heard of them, but that's about it.\n\nEdit later: I actually counted what books I read end-to-end from the list and I came up with 99 complete series-to-date/single titles and 17 series I read at least one volume from and later dropped, so I read 116 of the listings either fully or in those 17 cases partially.\n\nI was quite pleasantly surprised by the breadth of the list; sure anyone can quibble about this or that - for me it's stuff like Battlefield Earth or Piers Anthony on but no KJ Parker -but I am sure that for anyone into sff there will be at least 10 choices there.\n\nThis list while not to be taken that seriously is still a great thing since it exposes a very wide swath of sff to a large audience and I am happy NPR had this initiative. Whichever books get the vote, they get the vote so to speak even if Battlefield Earth would be the top, since the fun is in discussion and your choices.

Edison\n\nThe Xanth Series, by Piers Anthony\n\nThe Yiddish Policeman's Union, by Michael Chabon\n\nEven with my usual \"an author only once\" rule for lists which took Baroque and Perdido Street Station out since I prefer The Scar and Anathem and it was a struggle to trim to 10 - I regretfully had to leave First Law, Acts of Caine and 1632 out.\n\nThese choices reflect my preferences today and what I would recommend if someone not familiar with the genre but wanting books that are current and of quality would ask; there are many older books on the list that were landmarks in their time, but I hold pretty strongly the belief that sff dates quickly so it's better to start with the contemporary authors."
