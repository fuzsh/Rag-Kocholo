Introduction What you are holding in your hand is already an obsolete product. It’s also the first time it’s been a tangible object in the process of its creation. The neurones of thought trigger spasmodic movements of digits (an unavoidable meat medium) onto keys, which is converted electronically into 0s and 1s stored on the C drive of my PC. The zeroes and ones, representing words, are eventually sent via e-mail to the publisher, who uses a computer to 'typeset' these words and – having sent me a PDF to proofread – sends them to the printers. It is only then the words hit paper, and this is almost a shame, since the actual is always disappointing compared to the virtual version. And the cheque which is my payment goes straight into a bank account without my ever seeing anything recognisable as money. In fact, Pocket Essentials could have transferred this sum to my account direct. You may have ordered this book from a website and paid by credit card. Certainly its position will have been tracked by computer at some point in its route through wholesale and retail. Think how much computers impinge upon our lives: clocks, watches, calculators, PCs, MACs, any time we buy something, virtually every time we write a letter or pay a bill. Traffic lights. The Underground and Rail Networks. The National Lottery. Air traffic control. E-mail. Computer games. Every phone call. As the clocks in each time zone flicked from 23:59.59 on 31 December 1999 to 00:00.00 on 1 January 2000 the world held its breath: not only that the champagne would be fine, but also that the computers would still be working. International economics teetered on the edge of collapse thanks to decisions about computer chip design taken in the 1970s. * Let us try to understand cyberpunk via economics. The medieval world economy was a mixture of barter and coinage. So many pigs were worth so many bags of grain. The coins were worth the amount of precious metal which made them up. Western countries were emerging as nation states, with a strict hierarchical – feudal – structure in most. The modern world – for the sake of argument from the late fifteenth century – saw nations competing with each other on a greater scale than before, and the establishment of empires across the world: by the dawn of the twentieth century Africa, South America, Australasia and parts of southern Asia had been carved up between half a dozen European nations. Trade was international, and began involving paper currency as a kind of\n\n7\n\nBodyPunk.fm Page 8 Sunday, October 15, 2000 10:13 PM\n\nIOU backed by gold reserves in various banks across Europe and in the USA. Capitalism had taken over from feudalism; the aristocracy and royalty of Europe dwindled in influence, to be replaced by a class of businessmen – part of an emerging middle-class – and the workers who staffed the factories. In the twentieth century, the situation changed again, especially after the Second World War. One by one the colonies had sought, had taken or occasionally had been granted their independence, and the rôle of the nation decreased in world power as the numbers increased. What took the nation’s place were corporations who thought on a global scale, cutting across national boundaries: a company might have factories in Europe and Asia and markets in America and Europe. Whereas in the nineteenth century France, Britain and Germany competed for Africa, today Microsoft, News International, Coca Cola, Time Warner, Nike and a number of other multinational corporations with turnovers greater than many small countries compete for world domination. The Pound and the Dollar are no longer backed by gold, but supported by a kind of collective consensus as to their value. In fact, money increasingly becomes an illusion, with wages going direct into bank accounts and out again to pay for products without ever being in our pockets: the money is just ones and zeroes on the computers of the banking corporations. Banks keep our money in cyberspace, computer memory and networks, not vaults. Of course, for some industries it was all but impossible to avoid operating across national boundaries. From its origins in the 1920s, radio was seen as both an invasive medium of foreign propaganda, and a useful means of disseminating national characteristics abroad. The development of satellites allowed radio, television and telecommunications to spread across the world. In parallel to this, a series of wire networks grew – ostensibly to allow military communications in the event of a war, and this technology allowed academics to communicate with each other via their computers. This evolved into the Internet, a global, virtual community. In the last 30 or so years, the economic emphasis of the world seemed to shift from Europe and North America to the Pacific Rim: the tiger economies of Asia began to dominate, with exports of electronic equipment, cars and so on to the West, as well as their stock exchanges becoming increasingly important. The Japanese, in particular, seemed to be conquering the West by economics. And with the dissolution of the old 'evil' Soviet empire, perhaps there was here a new enemy for America to face... and a chance to tell some new stories.\n\n8\n\nBodyPunk.fm Page 9 Sunday, October 15, 2000 10:13 PM\n\nCyberpunk In the late 1970s and early 1980s a number of writers wished to explore this brave new world, using science fiction as its means. The most visible example of this was William Gibson, whose novel Neuromancer (1984) won the Hugo Award (given by sf fans) and the Nebula Award (given by sf writers) for the best sf novel of the year. Gibson depicted a near-future world dominated by computer networks and Japanese corporations, with artificially intelligent entities possibly running things behind the scenes. He could write with such poetry about computers, because at the time he knew little about them: to him a modem was an exotic piece of equipment. Gibson had published a number of short stories prior to this, and these led to him being labelled as a writer of Cyberpunk by the editor and critic Gardner Dozois. Dozois linked Gibson with Bruce Sterling, Rudy Rucker, John Shirley, and Lewis Shiner as authors of a science fiction set in a near future, dominated by high technology including computers, computer networks and human/machine hybrids. The technology provided the cyber part of the label; the street life of the stories and novels offered the punk part. But Dozois was not the first to use the term; credit for this is taken by Bruce Bethke, whose story 'Cyberpunk' was published in Amazing in 1983 having circulated in manuscript for some time beforehand. It is possible that the term predated even him; certainly the roots of cyberpunk itself can be traced back into the history of sf and literature in general.\n\nScience Fiction Science fiction is a genre of popular fiction, which has been produced in a number of media: written, visual and aural. Sf has roots in European literature, and the use of imaginary lands to comment upon contemporary issues can be found at least as far back as Plato’s Republic. It was only with the rise of the realist novel, in the second half of the eighteenth century, that fantastical fiction became distinguished from general literature. The most obvious form of fantastic fiction of the period was the Gothic novel, and a pertinent late example of this was Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein, or The Modern Prometheus (1818), where recent medical speculations upon the nature of life were used to update the golem myth. In the 1890s, H G Wells wrote a number of what he termed 'scientific romances,' where science again replaced magic as the driving force behind his narratives. The Time Machine (1895) and The War Of The Worlds (1898) both drew upon evolutionary theory, as well as astronomy and other sciences.\n\n9\n\nBodyPunk.fm Page 10 Sunday, October 15, 2000 10:13 PM\n\nHe was not alone, as many other writers of the turn of the century wrote works of proto-sf, such as Robert Louis Stevenson, Jack London and Joseph Conrad & Ford Madox Ford. But these were also writers of books which were respected. Sf as a genre grew up in the pulp magazines of the 1920s and it has been predominantly produced by writers from the United States. The term as used today developed from 'scientifiction,' a word coined by Hugo Gernsback the editor of Amazing Stories, April 1926, to describe: 'the Jules Verne, H G Wells and Edgar Allan Poe kind of story – a charming romance intermingled with scientific fact and prophetic vision.' Gernsback saw sf as a form that would be informed by science, but this shouldn’t be taken to mean that sf is merely predictive. Sf can equally use science (in the broadest sense) as a device with which to examine the present. Sf poses the question 'What if?' One form of the question is to examine the impact of new technology upon a society, and the behaviour of its inhabitants. Another is to suggest a possible revision or advancement in scientific knowledge, and extrapolate the way the world would change. Finally an alternate course of historical events might be suggested. In practice sf can employ different combinations of the question. An increasing number of professional sf writers began to be published in magazines such as Amazing and Astounding Stories, the latter edited by sf writer John W Campbell Jr. At that time, most sf took the form of short stories or novellas in magazines, which could then be linked together in book form; one example is Asimov’s Foundation trilogy (1942-58) which tells the story of a predicted collapse of the galactic empire, and the establishment of foundations to bring about the inevitable new galactic order. Predictions – and their limitations – were at the heart of the sequence. Since sf was a fiction led by ideas, scientific or otherwise, matters of characterisation and style were often ignored. Indeed, since writers wrote in the white hot heat of inspiration, a second draft was a rarity. In the 1950s, this began to change with the emergence of a number of writers who could combine the three elements. Theodore Sturgeon, Robert Sheckley, Alfred Bester and Philip K Dick, among others, brought a new wit and maturity to the form, under the tutelage of editors such as Anthony Boucher (Fantasy And Science Fiction) and Horace Gold (Galaxy). Alfred Bester is best-known in this context for his novel Tiger! Tiger! (1956, variant title and text The Stars My Destination, 1957) which features the character Gulliver Foyle. Foyle is marooned on a spaceship and escapes by jaunting – teleporting – to asteroids inhabited by tattooed men. He vows vengeance on the spaceship Vorga, which failed to rescue him.\n\n10\n\nBodyPunk.fm Page 11 Sunday, October 15, 2000 10:13 PM\n\nThis character can leap from place to place, facilitating a speedy plot and demanding constant invention from Bester, and he provides it – although the English town names used for characters may be distracting to British readers. On several occasions Bester experimented with typography, having letters spill across the page. Philip K Dick was an influence from at least three directions: in his own right, from the adaptation of a novel into the film Blade Runner (1982) and from his suspected influence upon Thomas Pynchon, who in turn influenced the cyberpunks. Do Androids Dream Of Electric Sheep? (1968) is probably his best-known work, featuring Rick Deckard, a bounty hunter assigned to track down and destroy a number of escaped androids. Since the androids are very close to being human themselves, they might almost be thought of as cyborgs; certainly the human characters who dial up their emotions on a Mood Organ should be thought of as cyborgs. Dick’s post-holocaust settings, anti-heroes and seat-of-the-pants plotting all form an influence upon cyberpunk. Dick was never one for narratives involving computer users (although the distinctly below par Vulcan’s Hammer (1960) features two super computers), but he did show a distrust of big business that cyberpunks were to echo. Meanwhile, in Britain, a group of writers centred on New Worlds and its editor Michael Moorcock had become tired with the clichés of bugeyed monsters and outer space; they wanted to explore the inner space landscapes of psychology and the media. Brian Aldiss (Report On Probability A (1968)), Norman Spinrad (Bug Jack Barron (1969)), J G Ballard (The Atrocity Exhibition (1970)) and others did just that, with some financial backing from the Arts Council of Great Britain. J G Ballard became the great writer of the period, with his near-future catastrophe novels, demonstrating that sf need not consist of mad scientists and their beautiful daughters, nor of blond, blue-eyed, square-jawed heroes who can conquer the galaxy single-handedly. What mattered was not the technology itself – the motor car in Crash (1973), say – but its impact on those who used it. The media landscape depicted by Ballard – his sense that in the 1960s we were living inside an sf novel – has developed exponentially during the last 40 years. John Brunner was another writer on the edge of the New Wave, who wrote 4 great novels about the end of the world: Stand On Zanzibar (1968, overpopulation) The Jagged Orbit (1969, the military industrial complex and the Mafia), The Sheep Look Up (1972, pollution) and The Shockwave Rider (1975, featuring a computer virus, as well as the media landscape). Brunner’s fragmented style – featuring a sense of the cinematic, quota-\n\n11\n\nBodyPunk.fm Page 12 Sunday, October 15, 2000 10:13 PM\n\ntions, newspaper clippings – was a homage to the American modernist John Dos Passos and his novel USA (1930-1936). The remorselessly downbeat nature of the novels was an undoubted influence upon cyberpunk. Back in America, black sf writer Samuel R Delany was rewriting the possibilities of sf. Most notably Babel-17 (1966) featured a spaceship into which the pilot could be plugged as a cyborg, and concerned itself with an imagined language. Delany was a great stylist and experimenter; his most successful experiment both in terms of critical reception and sales figures was Dhalgren (1975). An unnamed narrator arrives in a near-future city, and encounters a number of residents before leaving again, having written a novel that may be Dhalgren. The crossover success of Delany showed that writers could have vast sales outside of sf as well as within it. The new waves of sf in Britain and America showed the possibility of authors dealing with real-world politics head-on. Joanna Russ' The Female Man (1975), published half a decade after being written, explored the treatment of women and made uncomfortable reading for some, but rightly became a classic. Towards the end of the novel, Jael has sex with a man – an event which causes surprise and even disgust given the matriarchal nature of the societies depicted. But Davy is no ordinary man, he is a cyborg, with a chimpanzee’s brain, wired to have sex at her whim; this could well be the earliest example of technodildonics in sf. Russ' Alyx narratives Picnic On Paradise (1968) and Alyx (1976)/The Adventures Of Alyx (1987) offered adventure narratives with strong women who were not just male objects of desire or power fantasies. Gibson was to use the name Jael in his early novels, presumably in some kind of homage. Alice Sheldon, writing under her pseudonym James Tiptree Jr, produced another work of proto-cyberpunk in 'The Girl Who Was Plugged In' (1973), in which a 17-year-old girl from the streets is electronically augmented and turned into a walking advertisement. Despite many significant novels being published in the 1970s – the tail end of the British New Wave and the early writings of authors who would emerge fully in the 1980s - the 1970s seems to be a decade of shrinkage within sf, at least written sf. Even the unprecedented box-office success of filmed sf in the shape of Star Wars (1977) seemed to be a retrograde step, taking the naïve sensibility of 50-year-old sf as a model. In Britain there was no regular sf magazine between the collapse of New Worlds in the mid-1970s and Science Fiction Monthly (1974-1976) and the establishment of Interzone in 1982. The world was changing – the old order of presidents like Nixon gave way to someone who had made a living as an\n\n12\n\nBodyPunk.fm Page 13 Sunday, October 15, 2000 10:13 PM\n\nactor, international politics was changing as the Communist Bloc tried to hold on to power and Far Eastern economies began to colonise Europe. Sf had to change to mirror this.\n\nWilliam S Burroughs Parallel to sf – occasionally published as such – was the writer William S Burroughs (1914-1997), best-known for the novel The Naked Lunch (1956). Burroughs was a reformed heroin addict, who began writing whilst he came off junk: comic routines about psychopathic doctors, the link between sex and death, a series of dystopian states, life in the international zone of a north-African town, and various examples of people losing control of their bodies. Throughout Burroughs' work is a Swiftian distrust of the body, or the meat, which is perhaps an influence upon the cyberpunks. After The Naked Lunch, Burroughs experimented with cutups and fold-ins, ways of randomising texts, giving the whole a dreamlike – or rather nightmarelike – quality. Burroughs also drew on various genres of pulp fiction: Rider Haggardesque explorations of jungles, the western, sf (especially in his Venusians) and, most relevant here, the hard-boiled detective genre, with Clem Snide, the Private Asshole. The eponymous The Wild Boys (1971) – although they’re not limited to that novel – could be viewed as supplying one version of the punk ethos. His work stands as an example of how far things can be pushed in terms of the boundaries of taste; it dealt with drugs, sex, and the end of the body. Most important was Burroughs' ability to coin a phrase, inadvertently providing both bands and other writers with titles.\n\nThe Hard-Boiled Detective & Film Noir Mention of hard-boiled detectives suggests another source: the writings of Dashiell Hammett and Raymond Chandler. Private Investigators are on the edge of society, mixing with the rich and the poor, attempting to right the wrongs in society, but at a cost. On a narrative level, Hammett is probably the more significant, with his sociopath protagonists setting events in motion that they can barely keep track of as they try to play the angles – at times they are as much victims of their actions and the whims of others as they are an influence upon others. The Private Eye begins the novel, and sometimes ends it, not knowing the full story. The incident that started a sequence of events is often forgotten or irrelevant to the action; he will start one job in a town, but finish another.\n\n13\n\nBodyPunk.fm Page 14 Sunday, October 15, 2000 10:13 PM\n\nChandler’s protagonist Philip Marlowe is less of an anti-hero, being a literary descendant of the Arthurian knight. The oft-invoked mean streets are a regular setting in dozens of cyberpunk novels, whether San Francisco, Los Angeles or New York. Chandler brings a poetry to his fiction which is quite distinct from Hammett’s more serviceable style; both poles of writing are used by cyberpunks. The clichés of such fiction recur in cyberpunk: the femme fatale, the wealthy temporary employer, the Mr Big, and the suspicious authorities. The femme fatale is the beautiful woman who may attempt to seduce the hero, and lead him to the brink of disaster. The employer is a morally dubious, but financially successful, person who persuades the protagonist to take on a job, often against the hero’s better judgement, and who never quite tells the whole story. The Mr Big is the crime boss, the Godfather, who inevitably contacts the hero at some point to make them an offer they’d better not refuse. And as he goes about his job, skirting criminality, at some point the authorities take an interest, interposing between the hero and his goal. The look of film noir, from The Maltese Falcon (1941) to The Big Sleep (1946) and beyond, is also an influence, particular in the cinematic nature of much cyberpunk. Most clearly Blade Runner pastiches these films, with its scrolling prologue, rainy city setting, the deadbeat, deadpan delivery of the voice-over from the ex-cop, ex-blade runner Rick Deckard. Kim Newman’s The Night Mayor (1989) features a virtual reality which is straight out of film noir. Gibson cites the director Howard Hawks – who made Scarface (1932), The Big Sleep and The Thing (1951, uncredited) – as a direct influence.\n\nCyberpunk: A Provisional Definition Any definition of cyberpunk has to take both elements of the word into account. Computers have long been part of sf, often as a kind of menace. The power of computers to simulate environments is central to much cyberpunk, with the computer user jacking into this virtual environment or cyberspace by some means: through the spine, through eye sockets, through a chip in the head. The virtual environment liberates the protagonist from the constraints of his or her body, allowing them to take whatever form they choose. Often some crisis in the real world can be solved by going into the virtual one, a narrative which shares the shape at least of Shakespearean comedies, where the retreat from a city to a green space solves a personal crisis. Other times the entry into the virtual reality is to rescue someone\n\n14\n\nBodyPunk.fm Page 15 Sunday, October 15, 2000 10:13 PM\n\nwho has got stuck there; this is an even older narrative, echoing Orpheus in the underworld. The critic Joan Gordon rightly noted that the virtual reality represents a dark side to identity or humanity, and is a kind of underworld. But the computers needn’t just be limited to networks; sometimes individuals may be augmented by computers or other equipment – cameras, recording devices, receiving devices. The various types of augmented life – where the flesh is supplemented or replaced by the mechanical – are collectively referred to as the post-human. The punk is referring to the low life, the working or lower middle-class characters, the have-nots, who populate such fiction. Rather than rocket scientists and beautiful daughters, cyberpunk features drug dealers, drug users, musicians, skateboarders as characters, as well as various hackers. As most writers of cyberpunk are middle-class and (increasingly) middleaged, some have seen this as nostalgia or wishful thinking on the part of the writers. Some writers, such as Greg Egan, sensibly leave this punk element out of their fiction and concentrate on the possibilities of the virtual (computer- or mathematically-generated environment) or the post-human (augmented thought processes, without quite being the human-machine combination that constitutes the cyborg). Another aspect of cyberpunk is its linguistic experimentation and stylistic density; the use of computer jargon (real or imagined), street slang or Russian or Japanese loan words is commonplace. For some readers, the brew is just too heady. Finally the setting must be noted. Aside from computer landscapes, most predominantly the setting is America, as an entirely urbanised environment, with San Francisco and Los Angeles having merged, or a sprawl from Atlanta to Boston. Although a number of recent novels have used eastern-European settings, the cyberpunk world is of the Pacific Rim: Japan, South Africa, Australia, occasionally South America and of course California. There is a mistrust of the Japanese, and behind that a racist fear of an undifferentiated Asian horde. Equally problematic is Gibson’s use of voodoo as a parallel to cyberspace.\n\nPost-Cyberpunk & Cyberpunk-Flavoured There was a sense that cyberpunk was so up to the minute, that by the time the general public noticed cyberpunk, it was all over. Bruce Sterling, in his introduction to Mirrorshades: The Cyberpunk Anthology (1986) did much to define and popularise the movement, but he himself wrote things which were not cyberpunk as well. At one point in his introduction Ster-\n\n15\n\nBodyPunk.fm Page 16 Sunday, October 15, 2000 10:13 PM\n\nling argues that cyberpunk is anything written by a cyberpunk author. This is perhaps a homage to Damon Knight who defined sf as that which he pointed at when he said it was sf. Certainly there are stories in Mirrorshades which could only be called cyberpunk if we accept this definition and call those writers cyberpunks by default. It is an irony that I will note more than once that much of what I call post-cyberpunk is closer to our idea of cyberpunk than some of the stories collected in the supposedly definitive anthology. A number of the writers who were also in there – in particular Lewis Shiner – produced novels which were only borderline cyberpunk. Rudy Rucker and John Shirley wrote horror as well as sf. Cyberpunk died in about 1986, if not before. There are further ironies. The central figures of cyberpunk, Gibson and Sterling, turned at the end of the 1980s to writing a steampunk novel, The Difference Engine (1990). Steampunk is a sub-genre of sf set in Victorian Britain, part Verne or Wells, part Dickens, predominantly written by US writers and featuring incredible machines, often steam driven, and melodramatic plots featuring grotesque characters and bands of gentlemen. Initially steampunk was a label attached to the writers K W Jeter (especially Infernal Devices (1987) and to some extent Morlock Night (1979)), Tim Powers (The Anubis Gates (1983), although set too early to be called Victorian) and James Blaylock (a number, including Homunculus (1986) and Lord Kelvin’s Machine (1992)), precisely to mark their distinction from writers like Gibson. Gibson’s fiction, still sf, still cyberpunk, is now published as general literary fiction. Cyberpunk novels have continued to be produced, by writers outside the original brotherhood of the anthology. Neal Stephenson and Greg Egan are probably the best-known examples of these writers, and both are discussed in this book. Stephenson is thus a post-cyberpunk, as are many of the British exponents of the sub-genre. Of course, Britain might be thought to be part of the Old World on which cyberpunk is turning its back; much of cyberpunk is focused on Pacific Rim territories, rather than NATO areas. But just as the Japanese and Chinese culture and economies grew in importance during the 1980s and 1990s, so the European Union, formerly the Common Market, offered a space for the United States of Europe. The fall of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of the USSR equally changed the map of Europe. Some American writers used European settings (Bruce Sterling in Holy Fire (1996), for example, William Gibson in Mona Lisa Overdrive (1988)), but British writers also responded to the changed political map on their doorstep. Paris and other European locations added an Earth-based exoticism, but\n\n16\n\nBodyPunk.fm Page 17 Sunday, October 15, 2000 10:13 PM\n\nthe mean streets of cyberpunk could be representative of British inner-city decay, and the brave new world of the information superhighways could form a contrast to the blasted post-industrial landscape of Britain. Just as London could be returned to cobbles and weeds, so there was sometimes a nostalgic memory of an idealised English countryside. Ken MacLeod’s novels (The Star Fraction (1995), The Stone Canal (1996), The Cassini Division (1998) and The Sky Road (1999)) combine political musings, space opera, future history and some elements of cyberpunk. Downloaded personalities stored in robots, computer-based civilisations, a secret political conspiracy as a virus and so on were described alongside a Balkanised Britain, a new colony on the other side of a stargate and a future straight out of William Morris' News From Nowhere (1890). Given his treatment (and suspicion) of computers and AIs, MacLeod might be viewed as anti-cyberpunk rather than post-cyberpunk. Paul McAuley, aside from a couple of space operas, produced a novel Fairyland (1995) and a trilogy, The Confluence, which required nanotechnology to work its plot, and hovered on the edge of being fantasy. The European setting of Fairyland (1995) is important, as is the setting in Gwyneth Jones' Kairos (1988, discussed later). Just as the cyberpunk movement in the early 1980s looked back to New Worlds, so they increasingly looked across to a new British magazine, Interzone. Whilst it tried to distance itself from New Wave-style sf, it nevertheless published experimental material more often than writing in the hard sf tradition of, say, Larry Niven or Robert A Heinlein. Alongside new and established British writers, such as Kim Newman, Simon Ings, Brian Stableford and J G Ballard, the magazine published both William Gibson and Bruce Sterling. Sterling even had an opinion column in the magazine for a number of years: ironically many Americans looked to Britain to read material which the British regarded as archetypally American. With half an eye on A Clockwork Orange (both book (1962) and film (1971)), British writers have produced some of the most important postcyberpunk novels. Jeff Noon, whose Vurt (1993) was a cult success of the 1990s, wrote novels which shared a number of tropes of cyberpunk. But with south central Manchester substituting for south central LA, he inevitably tapped into a very English kind of sensibility, and an English rather than American psychedelia. The computers, which are central to much cyberpunk, are almost invisible. I have coined the term 'cyberpunk-flavoured' to describe these and other writings, writings which look like cyberpunk, behave like cyberpunk, are often structured like cyberpunk, but which, nevertheless, aren’t cyberpunk. I would argue that Greg Egan,\n\n17\n\nBodyPunk.fm Page 18 Sunday, October 15, 2000 10:13 PM\n\nwhose writing I have noted is hardly punk but very often cyber, is cyberpunk-flavoured. * Aside from Pat Cadigan, the cyberpunk movement was predominantly male. Even in post-cyberpunk, there have been much fewer female writers than male. Of course, most of sf in general is written by men. 1970s feminist sf had been concerned with describing utopias or dystopias, and usually required a distant future or alien planet to allow an exploration of the relations between the sexes, rather than the near-future Earth (or nearorbit) setting of much cyberpunk. Nevertheless, the social exploration of such writing was an influence on cyberpunk. Is the leather-skirted, metalfingernailed Molly featured in William Gibson’s early novels one daughter of Alyx? Molly could be seen as a resourceful character able to defend herself. But equally she could be seen as a male fantasy figure, a dominatrix. Whilst some critics accuse cyberpunk (if not all sf) of being toys for the boys, increasing numbers of female writers are producing it, or something like it. * As the twenty-first century dawns, as the use of the Internet becomes an everyday reality for a sizeable proportion of the First World population, as every second tv advert is for an Internet Service Provider or some other ecommerce, the original romance of cyberpunk has been lost. Any 20-yearold geek can become an e-millionaire, but the same old big businesses are moving in for the kill. Each new novel is marketed as ‘William Gibson meets Quentin Tarantino,’ as the tropes become third or fourth hand. But in amidst the trash, the wannabes, the copycats, there is still a core of readable works. Cyberpunk is dead. Long live the new cyberpunk.\n\n18\n\nBodyPunk.fm Page 19 Sunday, October 15, 2000 10:13 PM\n\n2. Consensual Hallucinations: The Core Reading Two writers tower above the cyberpunk movement as its central visionaries: Gibson the breakout writer, and Sterling the polemicist. But between them the cyberpunk movement was shaped and given form – even if others before them had written on similar themes.\n\nWilliam Gibson William Gibson was born in the USA in 1948, but emigrated to Canada from Virginia after being rejected for the draft to Vietnam. After a period in Toronto, he moved to Vancouver, a city that is part of the Pacific Rim therefore central to cyberpunk’s psychic geography. After a number of short stories later collected in Burning Chrome (1986) – including 'Johnny Mnemonic,' a story quite different from the film, and the breakthrough to the alternate world 'The Gernsback Continuum' – Gibson’s vision of the future was given flight in the novel Neuromancer, which won the Hugo, Nebula and Philip K Dick Awards. Despite the high-tech world he depicts, Gibson had had very little personal contact with computers; Neuromancer was written on a manual typewriter prior to the home computer revolution of the 1980s. If only because he is deluged with faxes everyday, he has refused for many years to have an e-mail address, and was reluctant about trying out the worldwide web; perhaps his imagination might be compromised by being confronted by the reality of what he had imagined. As each new novel is published, so Gibson’s readership seems to increase, and his last three novels have been published as mainstream rather than sf. Nevertheless, his reputation does still largely rest on Neuromancer, which is probably the sf novel that has been written about by academics more than any other. Gibson was one of the many authors to write a script for the third Alien film (which has been pirated on-line), and he also wrote the script for Johnny Mnemonic. The screenplay has been published as a separate volume.\n\nNeuromancer (1984) The Set-Up: Case is a console cowboy, who has stolen from his employers and has been punished by having his nervous system filled with a mycotoxin that prevents him from jacking into the matrix. Armitage cures and then blackmails him into stealing data – the personality of Dixie Flatliner, in read-only memory form – and to carry out his plan. Behind\n\n19\n\nBodyPunk.fm Page 20 Sunday, October 15, 2000 10:13 PM\n\nArmitage is Wintermute, an Artificial Intelligence, who sees the bigger picture of what’s going on in cyberspace... and who is out there... The Hero: Case is the master hacker, able to send his personality into the computer networks. Hanging over him is the threat of poison from within: mycotoxin sacs sewn into his arteries, slowly dissolving. The body just can’t be trusted, nor can other people, and he longs to leave his meat behind, unlike Dixie Flatliner, who longs to be erased. The Femme Fatale: Molly, with her black leather trousers, mirrored contact lenses and retractable, steel, fingernails is the stuff of fetishes, and is not so much the object of desire (although a version of her is in a cabaret hologram) as the active sexual partner. Liberated woman or wet dream? Playing The Angles: For all his proficiency, Case never quite knows what’s going on, whether it’s who he is really working for, what he is really trying to achieve or what is really going on. Like hundreds of private eyes before him, a book of matches guides him to where he ought to go, and a phone call from the Mr Big – here Wintermute – makes him an offer he shouldn’t really refuse, and would help him learn something to his advantage. The Style: From the famous opening line 'The sky above the port was the color of television, tuned to a dead channel,' it is clear that this is going to be a stylish book. Some of Gibson’s computer jargon is real, some has since been adopted. For some the surface shine of Neuromancer has proved too information dense, but Gibson is clearly a master stylist. Through the early chapters Case is described again and again in mechanical terms, as if he is a machine rather than a human being. The other chain of symbolism is that of eyes, watching and looking, a symbolism which curiously coincides with Blade Runner (1982). The Underworld: To know the name of an AI is to control them, perhaps, or at least that’s how it works with demons. The AI Neuromancer’s name works on a number of levels: the neuro being a reference to the nervous system, the new romancer referring to the romance of the new, especially technology, and the whole being a letter away from Necromancer, the summoner of the dead. And under his power, Case does meet up with his dead girlfriend. The Pay-Off: The key starting point for reading cyberpunk, a book whose moment can never quite be recaptured.\n\n20\n\nBodyPunk.fm Page 21 Sunday, October 15, 2000 10:13 PM\n\nCount Zero (1986) The Set-Up: Turner has been assassinated and is rebuilt to help bring in Mitchell, who has been working for Maas Biolabs. Bobby, aka Count Zero, is lucky to survive a bad experience in the matrix. He goes in search of more powerful software. Marly is employed to locate a number of artworks for a boss whose cancer-riddled body is in a vat. Naturally, there is a connection... The Hero: Turner is the more experienced, resourceful hero, able to smell a trap in advance. Count Zero, for all his bravado, is much more at the mercy of others. The Femme Fatale: Marly is tough, but not tough enough. Angie Mitchell, who does defect, has sex with Turner in that post-James Bond rescue kind of way. Playing The Angles: The three narratives take it more or less in turns to be told, and it is not until very late that they come together, rather unsatisfactorily. They are all set in the same world though, the world of the Atlanta-Boston Sprawl and the matrix. The action is again international – India, Mexico, Paris, New York and even into space. Virek, the novel’s Mr Big, is able to keep tabs on his charge despite being on ice, and everybody seems to be bugging, or being bugged by, everybody else. Just as well that you can tell your flying machine to lie about where it’s been. The Style: Computer terminology jostles with hints at Haitian culture and voodoo, whilst the opening pays homage to Robert Johnson. The Underworld: Turner and Count Zero are in a sense the undead, having been repaired after death-like experiences. And some of the characters discuss cyberspace in terms of voodoo. The Pay-Off: Neither Turner's nor Marly’s missions seem enough in themselves to sustain a novel, and the Count’s actions seem obscure. It lacks the sharpness of Neuromancer. 'Barrytown', a recurring setting in the novel, takes its name from a Steeley Dan track, as did Roddy Doyle for his comic trilogy of The Commitments, The Snapper and The Van. 'The sky above the Liffey was the color of Guinness...'\n\nMona Lisa Overdrive (1988) The Set-Up: Seven years later. Kumiko, daughter of a powerful Japanese, is sent to London after the death of her mother. Slick Henry, in Dog Solitude, is hired to look after a body of a man in cyberspace. In Malibu Angie, fresh out of detox, wonders where Bobby is. And a prostitute\n\n21\n\nBodyPunk.fm Page 22 Sunday, October 15, 2000 10:13 PM\n\nnamed Mona has been chosen for her likeness to Angie to take part in some kind of kidnapping. The Hero: None of the male characters are particularly active and heroic – Bobby is in cyberspace, Slick keeps on having fugues, his friend Gentry is too petty and strung out and Colin, Kumiko’s virtual guide to London, can only stand and watch. The Femme Fatale: On the other hand, Angie still holds a few surprises, Kumiko can take remarkable care of herself for a 13-year-old in a strange country, and her friend Sally, also involved in the kidnapping plot, is none other than Molly. Playing The Angles: All roads lead to Bobby, aka Count Zero, who seems to have dropped from sight for seven years. Quite why they want him is anyone’s guess, but it’s all tied up with the nature of cyberspace, and the sense that it all changed 14 years ago, when Case was last spotted. The Style: Fast moving, but to little effect; the four parallel threads that later come together mean than it’s quite hard to follow the action, and each slice of the narrative is very slim. Gibson varies the rhythm by not having the four occur in the same order each time, but that throws off the pattern rather than prevent monotony. The Pay-Off: This is meant to be stand alone, but there would be little point in coming to it without having read at least one of the earlier novels. A slightly different light is cast on these events, but there’s a tying-up of threads rather than anything significantly new. Oh, and Kumiko is surely an earlier version of Chia McKenzie from Idoru.\n\nVirtual Light (1993) The Set-Up: San Francisco, 2005. Berry Rydell is an ex-cop, and now works for a private security agency. He is assigned to track down some stolen goods, except that the owner of them has been murdered and had his tongue cut out. Meanwhile Chevette, the thief, is unaware of the danger she has brought upon herself. The Hero: Rydell has had a chequered career, and has almost been the subject of the true story television programme Cops In Trouble. He is an efficient investigator, certainly more so than the cops he bumps into, although they might not be on the level anyway. Certainly there is the sense that Rydell doesn’t quite know what’s going on. The Femme Fatale: Chevette comes originally from Oregon, but now makes her living as a bicycle courier. She scams her way into a party and takes the dark glasses, unaware of what they are.\n\n22\n\nBodyPunk.fm Page 23 Sunday, October 15, 2000 10:13 PM\n\nPlaying The Angles: The glasses project data into the perception system of whoever wears them, and the data that these store is about the future of San Francisco. This is (ahem) virtually the only appearance of cybernetic technology in the whole novel. Instead the novel is dominated by the mean streets of the big city, gunplay, corrupt cops, narrow escapes and reality tv. There is even a cult that depends upon the continual watching of television – with the film Videodrome seen as being the work of the devil. The Style: The narratives of Rydell and Chevette more or less alternate until they meet halfway through the novel, Rydell’s story being written in the past tense, Chevette’s in the present. There is also the narrative of Yamazaki, which serves mostly to fill in the background of this nearfuture world. The Pay-Off: Arguably cyberpunk lite, although there are many tiny telling details of a tightly extrapolated near future. The glasses are, however, little more than a MacGuffin to set the twin narratives going.\n\nIdoru (1996) The Set-Up: Colin Laney, who is able to piece information together about people from the data trail they leave behind them, is employed to investigate the music star Rez by the gangster-like minder, Blackwell. Blackwell fears that someone has got through his security net to Rez, and fears it might be linked to Rez’s announcement that he is to wed Rei Toei, an idoru or virtual media star. Meanwhile the 14-year-old Chia McKenzie, of the Seattle chapter of the Rez fan club, travels to Japan to see if the rumour of the affair between Rez and Rei is true. The Hero: Colin’s abilities were the result of experimentation with drugs, with him as an unwitting guinea pig. He had worked for Slitscan, a television network, exposing the private lives of celebrities. However one such investigation led to the suicide of the daughter of one of his subjects, and he left the company. This new job was obtained for him through the efforts of Berry Rydell, now a hotel security guard, and Yamazaki, revealed as a student of popular culture. The Femme Fatale: In some ways the seductive Rei Toei, the entirely virtual star of Japan. Kathy Torrance, Colin’s former boss and lover, is also there to make trouble for him. Playing The Angles: There’s a sense of computer paranoia here, that the information we’ve accessed can reveal things about ourselves that we don’t want others to know. After all, they reckon they can deduce things about our personalities and income from the contents of our shopping trolleys (hmm, bread, bagels, pizza and hoummous, all reduced to clear... not\n\n23\n\nBodyPunk.fm Page 24 Sunday, October 15, 2000 10:13 PM\n\nsure I want that revealed about me). Equally there is a narrative of the behaviour of fans – something in the tradition of Beatlemania, or the more recent teenage girl desires for Take That, Boyzone, or whatever the current popular beat combo is. Chia, to complicate matters, has carried someone else’s suitcase through customs, and ended up with an object that she could well do without. The Style: Another ping-pong narrative, alternating between Chia and Colin, although Colin’s tale is complicated by his memories/retelling of his earlier career. The two threads do overlap, but are mostly separate. The Pay-Off: This feels like a middle book in a trilogy (which it is, of course) – nothing is actually resolved, the problems seem as deep as ever, the puzzle of how you can marry a computer-constructed hologram seems unanswered and so on. But it’s above all a thriller, and a very readable novel with a fascinating image of a Tokyo rebuilt after an earthquake and a virtual version of Venice.\n\nAll Tomorrow’s Parties (1999) The Set-Up: Laney can perceive in the data flow of the world that a massive change is coming, like the change that happened in 1911 (don’t ask – Laney doesn’t know either). He also perceives that tycoon Cody Levine is not only connected to the change, but is doing everything he can to bring it about. Unfortunately Laney has fallen ill and now has stalker syndrome, a result of the drug given him as a child to enable him to perceive data traces. So he employs Berry Rydell to start investigating events in San Francisco, although he can’t say precisely what Rydell is doing. The Hero: Laney is more or less static throughout the novel, speaking to Rydell through telephones or virtual light spectacles, arranging for packages to be delivered, and so on. Rydell is again the competent investigator out of his depth, which is hardly unexpected when people aren’t telling him the full story of what’s going on. His rôle in the mean time is often to be beaten up, knocked out or threatened with death. And he still hasn’t had his chance to appear on Cops In Trouble. The Femme Fatale: Chevette is back, perhaps really regretting that she split up with Rydell, but still remembering that they had little in common when the action stopped. She doesn’t have a lot to do until coincidence ensures her reunion with Rydell in a nightclub. Rei Toei is also back, having developed as a personality and left behind Rez as an infantile male (is there a critique of cyberpunk characters in there?) Playing The Angles: Chaos theory and prediction seem to be the core here: how can you predict the future from the mass of data that the world\n\n24\n\nBodyPunk.fm Page 25 Sunday, October 15, 2000 10:13 PM\n\ngenerates? Laney can clearly ride the data, although it may kill him, as can Cody. For Rydell, with the tools and devices put at his disposal, and the right people turning up at the right time, the future seems mapped out. Although he, of course, can’t see it. The Style: Rydell’s is the primary narrative, more or less alternating with the lives of a considerable cast of other characters: Maryalice, Yamazaki, Laney, Chevette and so on, across seventy short chapters, many less than a page long. The thirty-second attention span is rewarded here. The Underworld: Well, the title’s a Velvet Underground track, off The Velvet Underground And Nico album (you know, the one with the banana on the cover). The Pay-Off: The ending, as you’d expect is ambiguous, and as for the change, well, presumably it has happened. Still, the future San Francisco is fascinating, as is the return to the community in the abandoned Oakland Bay Bridge, a setting first used in Virtual Light, and also used (albeit with a different bridge) in Johnny Mnemonic. In 1992, Gibson published Agrippa: (A Book Of The Dead), a text that was only available on a floppy disk and which was designed to be read once before it erased itself. Naturally this presented a challenge to hackers all over the world, and, naturally, the text was hacked and can be found on-line (for example at http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/SF-Archives/Misc/ Agrippa). It is an account of old photographs, relating to Gibson’s father, a reference to the draft, and how Gibson knew he was a writer. Agrippa is a poem, in free verse, with some striking imagery, but at times it struggles to rise above the level of an annotated list (which is perhaps a rich thing to say in a book like this one...).\n\nBruce Sterling Sterling was born in 1954 and had his first story published in an anthology of Texan sf, Lone Star Universe (1976). His first novel, set on a ship which sails across the fine sand of an alien planet, was Involution Ocean (1978). Whilst his second novel wasn’t cyberpunk, it had some elements which would later be typical of the genre. Although he has only produced two or three volumes that could be considered cyberpunk (and both of these are on a far more cosmic scale than the more down-to-Earth (or down-to-near-Earth orbit) than Gibson’s writings), he is a pivotal figure in the field. In the pseudonymously-edited fanzine Cheap Truth published in the mid-1980s, Sterling attacked much of\n\n25\n\nBodyPunk.fm Page 26 Sunday, October 15, 2000 10:13 PM\n\nthe other sf of the field and began to set out his manifesto for a new kind of writing. In 1986 he published the collection Mirrorshades, which drew together a group of writers which he perceived to be part of a cyberpunk generation, and wrote a polemical introduction where he defined the writing as information dense, embracing rather than afraid of technology, embodying a do-it-yourself, punk ethos and so on. If a number of the stories in there don’t now appear to be cyberpunk, Sterling prepared the ground for us by saying that cyberpunk fiction was anything written by a cyberpunk writer. At the same time, the cutting edge, avant-garde nature of the sub-genre has led many critics to suggest that the anthology was the death knell of cyberpunk, having pinned it down as a literary movement.\n\nThe Artificial Kid (1980) The Set-Up: On the planet Reverie, the professional combat artist R T goes on the run from the ruling Cabal with Saint Anne Twiceborn and Moses Moses, a man who has awoken from a sleep of several centuries. The Hero: R T, the eponymous Artificial Kid, is actually Rominauld Tanglin, once one of the leaders of the planet, who had a version of his personality inserted into a body before his death. The Kid is ultraviolent, but is medically fixed at a point prior to puberty, and goes everywhere with cameras filming his actions. The Femme Fatale: Saint Anne Twiceborn was born into a Church on the planet Niwilind, but has a sexual past of significance to the novel. Having fought for the preservation of moas, she is now a political refugee. Playing The Angles: Behind the punk attitude of the Artificial Kid, lies a political thriller of sorts, as the politics of the past collide with the science of the present. This is, however, just an excuse for a series of adventures as he goes on the run. The Underworld: Moses Moses, the Artificial Kid/Rominauld Tanglin and his creator, Professor Crowbar, all in some way attempt to cheat death with success at least on the genetic or personality level. The Style: The Kid says at one point that style is a weapon; this is quite a talky book though, as the characters tell their stories to each other. These are nested within the Kid’s overall first-person narration. The Pay-Off: Most of the novel is set on a floating island; and having echoed Moby Dick in Involution Ocean, here refers to Pinocchio. Fun but fairly forgettable.\n\n26\n\nBodyPunk.fm Page 27 Sunday, October 15, 2000 10:13 PM\n\nCrystal Express (1989) The stories in the first section of this collection are all set in the Mechanist/Shapers universe, and predate Schismatrix in publication: 'Swarm' (Fantasy and Science Fiction, April 1982), 'Spider Rose' (Fantasy and Science Fiction, August 1982), 'Cicada Queen' (Universe 13, edited by Terry Carr, New York: Doubleday, 1983), 'Sunken Gardens' (Omni, June 1984) and 'Life in the Mechanist/Shaper Era: 20 Evocations' (Interzone 7, 1984). The Shapers are one form of post-human, who are the product of genetic engineering, and are sometimes known as the Reshapers. The other form of post-human are the Mechanists, who are humans with artificial body parts, whether additional parts of the brain or prosthetic limbs. Having more or less left Earth behind, the two races interact with each other as rivals and with various alien races. It is perhaps easiest to start with the final story of the sequence, which explains some of the background, although 'story' is perhaps not quite the right word – the pieces are incidents in the universe Sterling has imagined. 'Swarm' documents the encounter of a Shaper, Captain-Doctor Simon Afriel with an alien hive mind, and his wager that somehow humanity (or rather post-humanity) will survive when so many other species with space colonies have died out. 'Spider Rose' records the encounter of a 200-yearold Mechanist in the region of Uranus with a race of trading aliens, and their gift of a genetically-engineered pet to her. In 'Cicada Queen' the induction of Landau into Poly Carbon clique is described, and then his exile as a different kind of post-human. This story is particularly dense in information and ideas, with a complex exploration of the politics of Sterling’s imagined universe. 'Sunken Gardens' features the terraforming of Mars, a planet inhabited by Mechanists and Shapers.\n\nSchismatrix (1985) The Set-Up: Abelard Lindsay is exiled from the Mare Tranquillitatis People’s Circumlunar Zaibatsu, and his old friend and rival Constantine. Over the next century he moves through a series of locations and political affiliations, sometimes trying a scam, sometimes simply trying to fit in. The Hero: Lindsay had been an ambassador with Constantine between his people and the Shapers, and they had been discredited when the Mechanists began to dominate the politics of the post-human solar system. Out on his own, he is always trying to make new alliances; he is resourceful and has a conjuring tongue and (less metaphorically) an artificial arm.\n\n27\n\nBodyPunk.fm Page 28 Sunday, October 15, 2000 10:13 PM\n\nPlaying The Angles: This novel needs to be read alongside the stories in Crystal Express, as both cast a light on each other: Simon Afriel from 'Swarm', the Cicada Queen, terraforming planets and so forth. Lindsay, in his various guises, is the one constant in an otherwise fast-moving, system-spanning novel. The Style: The very pace is its potential downfall: it can be too information dense, with political systems and neologisms taken as read before the action shifts five years or fifty. The novel is thus episodic, ever picaresque, and just when you think you’ve got a handle on things, the location shifts. And characters reoccur from earlier in the narrative, sometimes in disguise, sometimes as computer simulations. Many novelists would get a whole novel out of what Sterling tosses out (or away) in a single paragraph. The Pay-Off: This is a very different cyberpunk to Gibson’s – for a start the computers are virtually non-existent, Earth is off-stage for much of the action and it’s set centuries not months into the future. The punk attitude is there though, and it explores the post-human existence that comes out of cyberpunk’s obsession with the human-machine interface. Cyberpunk would be very different if this, not Neuromancer, had won all the awards. The Shaper/Mechanist short stories and the novel Schismatrix are also available in a single volume, Schismatrix Plus (1996). Not all the stories in Crystal Express are in the Mechanist/Shapers sequence, and other non-sequence stories appear in the collection Globalhead (1992). Heavy Weather (1994) is a novel set in a world of massive storms caused by ecological meltdown. More recently he has written the Arthur C Clarke Award-Winning Distraction (1999), an account of a nearfuture America on the brink of collapse, and the exploits of a spin doctor trying to hold onto power and keep one step ahead of social chaos. Personally I’d find the satire more convincing if Neal Stephenson and J Frederick George, writing as Stephen Bury, hadn’t done it much better in their fictional account of the presidential campaign of 1996, Interface (1994). Sterling has also produced non-fiction, most substantially The Hacker Crackdown: Law And Disorder On The Electronic Frontier (1992), a book inspired by the raid on TSR Games in Switzerland and the removal of their computers, and moving into a wider investigation of computer crime.\n\n28\n\nBodyPunk.fm Page 29 Sunday, October 15, 2000 10:13 PM\n\n3. The Cyberpunk Movement Whilst William Gibson and Bruce Sterling are the more famous writers of cyberpunk, and probably the most successful, they were not alone. Bruce Sterling gathered a number of such writers together for an anthology, Mirrorshades, and introduced it with a polemical account of the subgenre. Nevertheless, the writers were gathered together in what Bruce Sterling saw as a mood of sf, in the tradition of Delany, Bester, Dick, Burroughs and so on, offering a new counter-culture (one which embraced technology unlike the generation of the 1960s), a global culture of remix and interferences, interzones, interminglings, a new vision of sf and of the world. Few, if any, of the writers set out to write cyberpunk consciously, some – such as Greg Bear – would even reject the label. Many of the writers also wrote or went on to write horror, fantasy, non-fiction or magic realism; Greg Bear in particular has produced genre sf rather than cyberpunk, although some recent novels at least nod in the direction of AIs and the near future. It is ironic that many of the writers included in the anthology, indeed many of the pieces included in it, are less comfortably cyberpunk than some of the material I am going to discuss in the chapters on post-cyberpunk and cyberpunk-flavoured fiction. This chapter discusses the writers who were published in Mirrorshades.\n\nGreg Bear Gregory Dale Bear would no doubt deny that he is a cyberpunk writer, and the story he has in Mirrorshades, 'Petra', hardly seems to disprove any such assertion. The tale of a repressive world within an enormous cathedral after the death of God, the flavour is closer to Mervyn Peake than William Gibson. There are hints that some of the non-human characters are mechanical – a power supply of one of them seems to be running down – but it doesn’t seem very close to the sub-genre identified with the anthology. (It is, however, a delightful story). Born in 1951, Bear was first published in 1967, and many of his novels feature complex characters against a hard science background; in the case of Blood Music, genetic engineering and viruses. Further novels have been on a more cosmological scale, although the near-future worlds of Queen Of Angels (1990) and / (aka Slant (1997)) are of interest.\n\n29\n\nBodyPunk.fm Page 30 Sunday, October 15, 2000 10:13 PM\n\nBlood Music (1985) The Set-Up: Vergil Ulam is conducting his own experiments on genetically-modified cells using the facilities at the company he is working for. When his boss fires him, he smuggles the new cells out of the laboratory in his own bloodstream. At first he seems healthier than he has ever been, but then he begins to transform into a new type of human, and the cells within him are behaving like a virus, infecting others. The Hero: Given the structure of the novel, it’s difficult to isolate one figure as a hero from the ensemble of characters. The scientist who starts the virus is misguided rather than mad. His boss could be seen as standing in the way of progress, but it is probably just as well he did. Michael Bernard and Edward Milligan do their best to understand the cellular matter and prevent its spread, but even they aren’t quite heroes. The characters are reasonably well developed for cyberpunk. Playing The Angles: The genetically-engineered cellular matter seems to take on an identity of its own, a kind of collective group identity within the individual host. The host is in part a god to it, but they also invite the god to join them and become one of them. Late on in the narrative we have an account of such a joining, after seeing some characters reject it; we can, just, glimpse a next stage of evolution. And this being hard science fiction, there is also a sub-theme of the Uncertainty Principle, and the impact observation – in this case by trillions of observers – has on the universe. Coo. The Style: There are moments of technical stuff, and voices from within (the DNA talking), but basically this is constructed as an episodic, realist novel. The Underworld: A long shot this, but Virgil (aka Vergil) was Dante’s guide in the underworld of The Divine Comedy. The Pay-Off: A very fruitful novel – the ethics of the international world, of genetic engineering and an exploration of the nature of the virus as invader – the invader from within. Beyond Vergil’s do-it-yourself attitude to experimentation, you’d be hard-pressed to identify a punk ethos though.\n\nPat Cadigan Pat Cadigan was born in 1953 in the United States, but in the 1990s moved to London where she married the critic Christopher Fowler. Her first fiction appeared in Shayol, a magazine she edited. Further short fiction has been collected in Patterns (1989), Home By The Sea (1992) and\n\n30\n\nBodyPunk.fm Page 31 Sunday, October 15, 2000 10:13 PM\n\nDirty Work (1993). Her first novel, Mindplayers, and third, Fools, both won the Arthur C Clarke Award, the first time the same writer has won it twice. She is the only female writer to be associated with the first generation of cyberpunk writers, indeed she has been hailed as the 'Queen of Cyberpunk.' There is perhaps a problem in much cyberpunk that it depicts female characters as femmes fatales, and thus either as empowering or degrading figures or a misogynistic depiction. Given Gibson’s move into the mainstream, Sterling’s parallel non-cyberpunk work, and the broad shift out of the movement by other authors in Mirrorshades (or failure to produce the second novel) Cadigan is the author who has explored cyberpunk most consistently; she is certainly one of the most interesting figures.\n\nMindplayers (1987) The Set-Up: Allie Haas has been arrested for illegal use of mindplaying equipment and is offered the chance to be a pathosfinder – part-cyberspace guide, part psychiatrist. The Hero: Deadpan Allie is clearly the main character, although she is not superheroic: she can make mistakes, she doesn’t know all the answers and she suspects her personality isn’t just her own. The Femme Fatale: Jerry Wirerammer, the (male) friend who got her arrested in the first place, crops up from time to time to tempt her into his world of bootleg dreams and memories; after a while it’s unclear as to whether he is Jerry or a cloned copy of a bootleg of Jerry… Playing The Angles: We follow Allie’s career as she guides mindplayers, counsels those who have split up from others who mindplayed with them, or tries to retrieve the minds of the recently deceased. The Style: The novel is episodic, as we follow her on each assignment. The sub-plot of Jerry Wirerammer forms a kind of continuity. The Underworld: When Allie is assigned to retrieve the confused mind of a dead person we seem to go beyond the realm of the living; forever afterwards she is not convinced that her mind is clean. The Pay-Off: An impressive debut, demonstrating a world where cyberspace is at work and making money for people (something which Cadigan develops with the concept of billable time in Tea From An Empty Cup).\n\n31\n\nBodyPunk.fm Page 32 Sunday, October 15, 2000 10:13 PM\n\nSynners (1991) The Set-Up: The Synners are a group of video makers and hackers, creators of simulations, who are hot-wired into the net in a throat-cutting corporate future. A new intelligence, Dr Artie Fish, is alive in the net and it has contacted them. And not a moment too soon, as they’re going to need all the allies they can get: there is a virus loose that could take out all the computers, and the console jockeys riding them. The Heroes: This is an ensemble piece, with a large cast of characters. Sam is the leading female, and Mark the most important male, but much of the novel is the individuals doing what they do best. Whilst the apocalypse creeps up behind them... Playing The Angles: Cadigan’s early novels are everyday life in cyberspace, and there in a sense that there’s a price to pay for access to it – the Synners are free-market economists or entrepreneurs in their own small way. This financial aspect is perhaps forgotten as the narrative – such as it is – progresses. The Style: This novel falls into the trap of not quite making the real/virtual worlds distinct enough for my taste – but perhaps when you wire in so often there is no distinction. The Underworld: Jones commits suicide frequently for kicks. The Pay-Off: Cadigan’s longest novel, and the least sharp. By the time of Tea From An Empty Cup she can make her point in two hundred pages, but this novel feels flabby.\n\nFools (1992) The Set-Up: Marva, a method actress, finds herself in a club called Davy Jones' Locker, with more money than she ought to have, and the memory of killing a cop. Another woman, Marceline, also remembers killing a cop. And then there’s Marya, a Brain Cop, who’s undercover. I think. The Hero: Again female characters are to the fore… Marva, Marceline and Marya. I think. Playing The Angles: Is Marva truly herself or is she still stuck in a rôle? Has she melded personalities with Marceline by escorting her, possibly in cyberspace? And then there’s the undercover cop who might be one of them, or they all may be a character suffering from multiple personality disorder. I think.\n\n32\n\nBodyPunk.fm Page 33 Sunday, October 15, 2000 10:13 PM\n\nThe Style: The three different voices are distinguished by three different typefaces, which at last allows some semblance of beginning to make sense of it all. The Underworld: Davy Jones' Locker sounds pretty bleeding subterranean to me. The Pay-Off: An ambitious novel that is perhaps too ambitious in its exploration of the melding of personalities and the implications of acting and avatars in cyberspace. It’s supposedly set in the same universe as Mindplayers, but the only real indication of this is a mention of Jerry Wirerammer. One to read and reread, or just to batten down the hatches and enjoy. I think.\n\nTea From An Empty Cup (1998) The Set-Up: A boy’s body has been found in a cubicle in a near future equivalent of the cybercafé or games arcade, and Lieutenant Konstantin is drafted in to investigate how someone could die in the virtual world (AR, for Artificial Reality) and real life (RL). The boy is called both Shantih Love and Tomoyuki Iguchi, but neither of those appear to be real names, and his true identity is lost or irrelevant. Konstantin, a novice at AR, attempts to retrace Shantih’s virtual steps, and goes in search of Body Sativa, whom she believes can help her solve this and half a dozen other AR/RL murders. The Style: A ping-pong narrative structure; after a conversational first chapter, the narrative alternates between the story of Yuki (headed 'Empty Cup') and Konstantin ('Death in the Promised Land'). Yuki is in search of her friend Tomoyuki Iguchi, who has gone missing, and like Konstantin goes looking for him wearing a version of the Tomoyuki body. Whereas the Konstantin thread is police procedural, Yuki’s is much more philosophical, posing questions about the nature of identity, and perhaps demonstrates just how far an author can go in metaphysical terms. The Underworld: The Underworld here is both AR and the lost Japan, which may be resurrected in RL or be another virtual theme park. Konstantin and, to a much greater thematic extent, Yuki both find themselves in the Orpheus rôle. Playing The Angles: To say too much would be to risk revealing the climax of the novel, but reading through you discover that virtually every identity presented by a character is simply a persona obscuring another identity. Yuki’s apotheosis offers another such scenario, and answers a nagging question at the back of my mind: we’ve seen at least three versions of Tomoyuki on-line, but I don’t think we’re told about his real-life\n\n33\n\nBodyPunk.fm Page 34 Sunday, October 15, 2000 10:13 PM\n\nbody. In the final paragraph of the novel, I believe this conundrum is solved. Her latest novel, Dervish Is Digital (2000) is a sequel to Tea From An Empty Cup.\n\nMarc Laidlaw Laidlaw was born in 1960, and his story '400 Boys' appeared in Mirrorshades. His first novel is of interest to us here, but it is quite subtly cyberpunk. His subsequent novels, Neon Lotus (1988), Kalifornia (1993) and The Orchid Eater (1994), are satires or non-sf.\n\nDad’s Nuke (1985) The Set-Up: Dad is the head of the Johnson family in an idyllic enclave of suburban America after the collapse. He’s locked into an arms race with his neighbour, the Smiths, and faces a change in his situation as three children have hit puberty. The Hero: Dad is a character out of a sitcom, wanting to keep up with the neighbours, wanting to join the local men’s club, and failing to quite keep his family in control. Playing The Angles: His eldest son, Virgil, is getting married, he has just told his second son, P J that he (P J) is homosexual, and his eldest daughter is about to have treatment to make her undergo puberty (which will hopefully ensure that she gives up her love for his neighbours' son). But thankfully there is hope with the youngest child, who has been genetically-engineered to digest radioactive waste. All of the children have been engineered to make a balanced family, and ageing is controlled by drugs. The Style: Clearly comic, with an awful lot of inventive details, and hints of satire on the arms race, the image of the home as castle, religious movements, and small town/suburban life in America. Each family has a one-hour programme about their day on the cable tv, anticipating docusoaps by a good ten years. The Underworld: The family go on a disastrous virtual trip to Yosemite, and get trapped in there by a computer failure. The idyll seems to be turning into hell. The Pay-Off: On the surface inoffensive and good fun, but a darker side is subtly obscured.\n\n34\n\nBodyPunk.fm Page 35 Sunday, October 15, 2000 10:13 PM\n\nTom Maddox Daniel Thomas Maddox, born 1945, is a professor of languages and literature and began publishing fiction in 1985. His story in Mirrorshades is called 'Snake Eyes' and may be set in the same universe as Halo; it’s the tale of someone coming to terms with a brain implant and control by an AI, Aleph. Most of Maddox’s short fiction appeared in Omni, and Halo is his only published novel to date.\n\nHalo (1991) The Set-Up: Mikhail Gonzales, having narrowly avoided being killed by an ICBM in an aeroplane, is sent to the space habitat Halo to observe an experiment: Jerry Chapman is dying and they are trying to store his identity whilst he undergoes surgery. The surgeon brought in for the operation is Diane Heywood, former lover of Chapman. And when the process goes wrong, the AI which runs Halo, Aleph, begins to sulk. The Hero: Gonzales is clearly removed from the action, being an observer rather than one of the two lovers. He has a multicultural background – Russian Jew, Hispanic, black, Cuban – but this seems to add little. Playing The Angles: In the epigraphs to the chapters quotations are taken from theorists Jean Baudrillard – who discusses the way that reality itself is turning into a simulation of itself – and Donna Haraway – whose essay 'A Manifesto For Cyborgs' did much to introduce cybertheory to feminism and ended with the preference for women being cyborgs rather than goddesses. An opposite opinion is mentioned in passing in the novel. Meanwhile it is clear that the Western economy is being propped up by the East, with famous American brand names spliced with Japanese and Korean ones. This is building a background world, rather than significant. The Style: The novel is straightforwardly written, in the third person, with occasional interventions from Aleph itself. The Underworld: Twins appear towards the end of the novel: Alice and Eurydice, complete with reference to Orpheus. Later on there is an echo of Persephone’s split life between the underworld and the everyday world. The Pay-Off: The hotshot international opening seems rather at odds with the philosophical explorations of the rest of the book. The first part punk, the rest cyber.\n\n35\n\nBodyPunk.fm Page 36 Sunday, October 15, 2000 10:13 PM\n\nRudy Rucker Rudolf von Bitter Rucker was born in 1946, and has a background in mathematics. In fact he might be considered more in the line of such nineteenth-century mathematician fantasists as Charles H Hinton, Lewis Carroll and Edwin Abbott than cyberpunk. His first novel to be published in book form, White Light, Or What Is Cantor's Continuum Problem? (1980), features a mathematician, Felix Rayman, who enters a realm, Cimön, inhabited by his heroes in the field, Cantor, Hilbert and Einstein. As he climbs Mount On in search of absolute infinity, he experiences or explains a number of aspects of infinity. Cimön is in some senses an underworld, featuring the dead, transmigrated individuals (a reference to Kafka’s Metamorphosis) and Jesus and Satan; it is difficult to be absolutely (ahem) certain whether the realm is real or imaginary, which surely is the point. His story in Mirrorshades, 'Tales Of Houdini,' is an account of the escapes of Harry Houdini. He has gone on to write more short stories (some with Marc Laidlaw), poetry, a steampunk and several cyberpunk novels, non-fiction on mathematics and computer software. With Robert Anton Wilson and Peter Lamborn, he edited the experimental cyberpunk anthology, Semiotext(e) SF (1988). Aside from his four Ware novels, his collection of short stories, poetry and non-fiction Transreal! (1991) is worth seeking out.\n\nSoftware (1982) The Set-Up: Cobb Anderson was the designer of the artificial intelligences which run the robots. When they revolt, setting up a colony on the Moon, Anderson is accused of treason. Now an old man with a failing body, Anderson is offered the chance to be preserved as a robot. The Hero: Anderson’s age means that he is confused when he sees a double of himself, and no one pays particular attention to him if he says something odd is going on. Nevertheless when he is on form, he is still able to think philosophically. Playing The Angles: There is a second double, of Sta-Hi Mooney, the son of the policeman who lives next to Mooney. Sta-Hi is a waste of space, dropping acid at any opportunity, whereas his replacement is well behaved and gets a better job. Which version is better, the slacker or the drone? The Style: The style is reminiscent of Philip K Dick – robots smuggled to Earth in packing crates, an ambiguous patriarch, the policeman who\n\n36\n\nBodyPunk.fm Page 37 Sunday, October 15, 2000 10:13 PM\n\nlives next door and has to do his job somehow, made awkward by his son, and the leader of the robot revolution, Ralph Numbers, who may or may not be a good, er, person. The robots have rebelled against rule by Isaac Asimov’s three laws of robotics, which puts humanity’s benefit ahead of robot health. The Pay-Off: A fun novel which poses some questions about identity, and continuity of identity in a new body. It won the Philip K Dick Award.\n\nWetware (1988) The Set-Up: 2030: Sta-Hi Mooney, now a private investigator calling himself Stahn, is hired to track down Della. Meanwhile Cobb Anderson, killed ten years ago by Sta-Hi, has been resurrected in a new body: wetware. The Hero: Stahn disappears for huge swathes of the action, but he had a wife named Wendy who has been killed and who may now be resurrected if he plays his cards right. And he still hasn’t kicked the drugs habit. Cobb doesn’t get to do much to be honest. The Femme Fatale: Della, who is pregnant, and Berenice, a robot who learned to speak by reading Edgar Allan Poe’s prose. Playing The Angles: Humans begat the robots or Boppers, and Boppers try to build themselves a new body every ten months or so, but now they are able to merge their software with the wetware of DNA and produce a meat robot, Manchile. The Style: Each chapter is given a specific date – either in November or December 2030, or in 2031 – and so the narrative doesn’t have to unfold in strict chronological order. Fortunately this is an aberration which stops after the first half dozen or so chapters. Again there are echoes of Philip K Dick. The Underworld: Anderson has come back from the dead, and imagines talking to God, who describes himself as Eurydice to Anderson’s Orpheus. Wendy is also brought back from the dead, and it might be that the name is an act of homage somewhere along the line to the character in J M Barrie’s Peter Pan (1904), who said that death would be an awfully big adventure. The Pay-Off: Not as satisfying as the first novel in the Ware sequence, but still inventive, echoing bits of Philip K Dick (drug use, an encounter with god, a character named Charles Freck (compare A Scanner Darkly) and so on); the novel is even dedicated to Dick.\n\n37\n\nBodyPunk.fm Page 38 Sunday, October 15, 2000 10:13 PM\n\nFreeware (1997) The Set-Up: The 2050s. Moldies are an artificial life form made from a soft, malleable plastic and genetically-engineered fungi, molds and algae. Like the robots before them, they are not universally liked, and there is a Heritagist movement against them, in favour of pure humanity. Randy Karl Tucker, the illegitimate great-grandson of Cobb Anderson, uses Moldies for sex, and begins working on the manufacture of devices which can control Moldies for a company in India - he is blackmailed into leaking the secrets of the process. Meanwhile Tre Dietz has been happily working on all sorts of software, and the mold-based limpware, until the day his wife is kidnapped by a Moldie heading for the Moon. The Hero: It’s a toss up between Randy and Tre, both of whose histories we get in detail. Stahn/Sta-Hi is back, in slightly more than a cameo rôle as a senator, and Cobb makes a brief appearance. The Femme Fatale: Randy’s mother’s lesbian lover Honey seduces Randy, but his main love is a Moldie. Monique and Parvati can each be dangerous to him, by betraying him, killing him or taking him over. Playing The Angles: The novel focuses on the development and use of a new kind of technology, the Moldie. The Moldies, being intelligent, have ideas of their own, and don’t necessarily want to be so controlled; curiously both they and the Heritagists have the same goal, to get all Moldies off the planet Earth. The best place for them to go is a haven on the Moon. The Style: The story focuses on eight of the characters, but is still told in the third person. Each of the chapters are dated, and the first half dozen deal with their overlapping and separate lives from 2031 (the defeat of the robots on the Moon) to the end of October 2053. The remaining ones deal with events in November and December 2053. Thankfully there are a number of family trees printed at the front of the volume to make the various relationships clear. The Underworld: Death is still not the end, with Cobb back from the dead (again) and Wendy brought back a number of times as well as being cloned for food. The Pay-Off: It’s best to focus here on the individual chapters and the way they interrelate than the narrative as a whole, but Rucker is never less than inventive. Perhaps as a way of rounding out the climax he introduces a number of races of aliens to up the stakes for humanity (and the Moldies, for that matter). There is the kind of casual inventiveness of insignificant detail typical of Philip K Dick’s Ubik (1969; compare that novel’s lavish descriptions of outrageous costumes). It’s worth pointing out that this\n\n38\n\nBodyPunk.fm Page 39 Sunday, October 15, 2000 10:13 PM\n\nnovel includes a fair amount of sexual activities, but it’s not particularly described in an erotic manner (or, not erotic to me, anyway).\n\nRealware (2000) The Set-Up: February 2054. Phil Gottner’s father is missing, presumed dead, having fallen into a wuwu, a kind of klein bottle. At the funeral of what is left of him, Phil meets Yoke Starr-Mydol and falls in love with her. Yoke disappears off to Tonga, and meets up with the aliens (now labelled Metamartians) from the previous book. They give her an alla, a magic wand that conjures objects into being by transmuting atoms. The Hero: Phil has had enough: he has lost a parent, and his girlfriend Kevvie is tripping all the time. (Cobb is still around, in limpware form, and is used to help Yoke travel to Earth from the Moon). The Femme Fatale: Yoke is another independent spirit, but quick thinking enough to be able to save Cobb when he is poisoned with a drug. Playing The Angles: The aliens which appeared briefly towards the end of Freeware are back, and have a bigger rôle to play here. The scope is widening out from the Earth and the Moon to a much more cosmic scale, just as the technology of information has shifted from digital to DNA to fungi to… well, the universe itself. At the same time, the focus is much tighter as Phil and Yoke are the centre of each alternate chapter. The Style: Still very inventive, but less frenetic than the previous book. Indeed this is the most linear narrative in the sequence since Software. Given characters named Phil and Jane, and an alien-pig called a Wubwub, there seems to be a set of Philip K Dick references – his twin sister was called Jane, and pig-like wubs occur at various points in the collected works. The Underworld: Phil goes into the hyperdimensional realm which seems to be a world of the dead – which has more than a whiff of Lewis Carroll and Edwin A Abbott’s classic novel Flatland (1884). The Pay-Off: As Arthur C Clarke should have had said, any insufficiently advanced sf is indistinguishable from fantasy. The wand which changes matter seems to be a magic wand, and the Sorcerer’s Apprentice is mentioned to make this clear. Rucker’s mathematical and cybernetic future shades into the fantastic, and it might be argued that the technology is far too advanced for half a century down the line. On the other hand, the most advanced technology is alien, and progress is speeding up.\n\n39\n\nBodyPunk.fm Page 40 Sunday, October 15, 2000 10:13 PM\n\nLewis Shiner Shiner (1950-) was included in Mirrorshades with the story 'When Human Voices Wake Us,' which involved cloning, and had already written the novel Frontera which is viewed as cyberpunk. Deserted Cities Of The Heart (1988), a richer confection of Mexican-based magic realism, complete with sex, drugs and politics, comes highly recommended.\n\nFrontera (1984) The Set-Up: A decade ago, the Frontera colony on Mars was abandoned, but now Pulsystems is spearheading a mission to return there, for unknown reasons. Kane, nephew of Morgan, the director of Pulsystems, sees fellow astronaut Reese as a father and is suspicious of Takahashi, a vice-president also on the mission. Mars is not as dead as they were led to believe, and an implant in Kane’s head may decide the fate of the colonists, and the mission. The Hero: Kane is a hero who knows he is a hero, saturated as he is in Greek mythology and Hero With A Thousand Faces. Reese is a hero gone to seed, an astronaut on the earlier Mars mission who is returning to his past. The Femme Fatale: Perhaps Molly, Reese’s daughter, or Verb, his granddaughter, who knows more than she should – or Lena, the fourth member of the returning mission. Playing The Angles: Two of the team know more about what they are heading into (and why they are on the mission) than they are letting on to the rest of the crew, and are keeping it quiet for their own reasons. Equally, their arrival is not unexpected, since the colony can listen into their radio communications; the colony has its own good reasons for keeping quiet. And then there’s the second mission, a few days behind the first. The Style: The narrative switches between a number of characters as we get to know their pasts on Earth, and learn the way that the world as we know it has collapsed, and the new world order (mostly involving multinational corporations) which has evolved to take its place. Kane’s own narrative is somewhat fractured, with a certain lack of continuity, but perhaps that indicates his lack of control of his perceptions, or something... The Underworld: Kane is seeking a cave, and name checks Orpheus and Eurydice. The Pay-Off: Another astonishing debut novel from 1984, an annus fantasticus in science-fictional terms. It’s a shame that Shiner has drifted away from sf, but his work is worth tracking down anyway.\n\n40\n\nBodyPunk.fm Page 41 Sunday, October 15, 2000 10:13 PM\n\nJohn Shirley A rock singer and writer born in 1954, his background in music informs much of his work, which spans horror and sf.\n\nCity Come A-Walkin’ (1980) The Set-Up: Here’s a puzzler. Stu Cole becomes a vigilante, tracking down vigilantes, as well as Mafia types and the corrupt. He’s told, if not forced, to do this by the City itself (himself?), which has decided to clean up San Francisco. The only thing is the City is suspicious that Stu’s friend Catz will betray them, especially as she seems to want to persuade Stu that he’s just being a puppet. The Hero: Stu runs a night-club, which is doing all right, when he notices this mirror-shaded customer he nicknames City. Stu has a past, he used to be a burglar, and he becomes cold to the violence he has to commit very quickly, whilst protesting against committing it. The Femme Fatale: Catz Wailen, real name Sonja Pflug, sings in a band which play in Stu’s club. Because she has telepathic powers, her music is able to reach the clientele with a strange force. Like most cyberpunk heroines, she can take care of herself. Playing The Angles: So far, the mean streets of a city (San Francisco, an unusual choice) and punk attitude, if not precisely a given youth movement. Stu has been around for a while. The particulars of the crowds – gay areas, sadists leading masochists around on leashes and other details – suggests it is extrapolating from a 1970s vision of the city (Watergate is invoked, and the criminal Mr Big has taped meetings, so the 1970s milieu is clear). There’s also a sense of a cybernetic future: the idea of machines connecting across the world, a global village, and a call for letters to be sent electronically. E-mail was possible in 1980, but exceedingly rare. The Style: The city is described as if it is alive (it is personified), but conversely the people are like machines; certainly they’ve lost autonomy over their actions. The book has a kind of distance to it, like horror. The Underworld: San Francisco as a city of the dead, and Stu as being as good as dead without his credit rating. At the start and end of the book, Stu is a disembodied voice, suggesting a speech from beyond the grave. The Pay-Off: A dark novel, with an all too plausible vision of the city of the future. With its punk ethos, its violence, its exploration of technology and information, the novel is clearly cyberpunk, and very good indeed.\n\n41\n\nBodyPunk.fm Page 42 Sunday, October 15, 2000 10:13 PM\n\nThe Song Called Youth trilogy (Eclipse (1985), Eclipse Corona (1988) and Eclipse Penumbra (1990)) is based around a musician, Rickenharp, whose influences are pre-punk: he is a rocker, with a taste for The Velvet Underground. The world is in a slow burn of a war, and an organisation called Second Alliance (SA for short) is exploiting the situation to its own ends, isolating a series of racial others. Rickenharp falls in with a motley array of resistance fighters in a derelict Europe, some of whom have infiltrated SA. If the city came alive in City Came A-Walkin’, here the city is dead. Meanwhile, up in orbit, a nearly complete space station is undergoing a coup and loss of political and social stability. Personally, I thought the first volume was a mess, with no plot developing in a satisfying manner, and lots of authorial digression as we are told the future history. Shirley has since revised these volumes. There are also short-story collections which are of interest, The Exploded Heart (1996), written much earlier, and a more solid collection, Heatseeker (1988). Most of Shirley’s other work is in the horror genre. James Patrick Kelley (1951-), author of the story 'Solstice' went on to publish two novels, Planet Of Whispers (1984) and Look Into The Sun (1989) about galactic communications, Wild Life (1994) and, with John Kessel, Freedom Beach (1985). Another writer to appear in Mirrorshades (with the story 'Stone Lives') was Paul Di Filippo, perhaps best-known for his three short novels collected as The Steampunk Trilogy (1995).\n\n42\n\nBodyPunk.fm Page 43 Sunday, October 15, 2000 10:13 PM\n\n4. Post-Cyberpunk The cutting-edge nature of cyberpunk ensured that it rapidly became a cliché: like many avant-gardes it was obsolete as soon as the mainstream media took notice of it. Indeed, some people began to argue that there had never been such a thing as cyberpunk – merely a collection of disparate writers linked together under a marketing label by the golden pen of Bruce Sterling. But computers, AIs, nanotechnology, hackers, prostitutes, junkies or assassins as heroes, multinational corporations, updatings of the Orpheus or Harrowing of Hell narratives and so on continued to be written about. Once Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction had entered the public imagination, every new writer was labelled 'William Gibson crossed with Quentin Tarantino.' This chapter discusses some of the significant writers of what might be seen as post-cyberpunk.\n\nWilhelmina Baird Baird, real name Joyce Carstairs Hutchinson, was born in Scotland in 1935, grew up in England and lives in France. She began publishing novels after she had retired from teaching. CrashCourse was followed by ClipJoint (1994), PsyKosis (1995) and Chaos Came Back (1996).\n\nCrashCourse (1993) The Set-Up: Professional burglar Cassandra Baines, male prostitute Dosh and aspiring sculptor Moke share a squat and dream of getting out of there. Their chance comes when they have the opportunity to star in a high-tech movie which records what they do, and what they feel; the only snag is they won’t be given a script, and they’re not certain all of them will make it out alive. The Hero: Cass is resourceful and caring, and more than able to look after herself (and others) before the movie begins. Once the movie starts, she begins to be a jealous girlfriend. The Femme Fatale: They find Mallore, a 16-year-old girl who has been abused by her father and take her in. Cass thinks she’s acting, but Dosh is smitten by her. And any attempt by Cass to expose her will leave her even more in the jealous girlfriend rôle – and likely to be killed off Playing The Angles: There is much talk early on about the clichés of narrative: the best friend who is killed off to legitimise the hero’s actions, the lone female who makes it through in the end, the comic relief characters in the First Act. And to some extent this exposes the mechanism of the\n\n43\n\nBodyPunk.fm Page 44 Sunday, October 15, 2000 10:13 PM\n\nplot – with some comic relief characters, as well as friends being killed off as an excuse for later mayhem and violence. The Style: Noirish is the word, with the mean streets of an imagined city predominating. A doctored cover quote from William Gibson on the British edition suggests that it is London, but the city feels very different and is referred to as Ashton. The Pay-Off: In approved manner the lone hero(ine), with all the cards stacked against her, is able to see clearly and turn the tables against her enemies. (That’s a dreadful mixed metaphor, but appropriate in the circumstances). The novel both uses and critiques the clichés.\n\nBruce Bethke Headcrash (1995) The Set-Up: Jack Burroughs (Jack – as in jack in; Burroughs – as in William Seward) is fired from his job with the corporation MDE, after an argument with his new (female) boss and goes back to the basement room of his mother’s home. Hanging out as MAX_KOOL in an on-line club, Heaven, he is hired to steal some data from his old company, using a new higher-tech virtual reality suit. This he does with consummate ease, only to find that this is but a test of his skills before the real mission. The Hero: Burroughs seems a bit of a loser in real life, and is sexually frustrated. Whilst his best friend and new business partner LeMat finds a girlfriend with whom he engages in energetic, long and frequent sexual behaviour, he remains celibate. Whenever he is about to jack into virtual intercourse, he is withdrawn from the net, or an event intervenes to prevent it. Playing The Angles: Burroughs suffers homosexual panic when he puts on the VR suit. It is bad enough that he has to don a data bra and bikini, threatening his masculinity, but he also has to insert a Sacroiliac Neural Induction Device into his anus. LeMat certainly doesn’t want to threaten his own masculinity by helping Burroughs with this aspect. Burroughs, caught in an ambiguity between penetration and the horror of being penetrated, spends much of the rest of the book being worried about this device. As this novel is a comedy, it is hard to decide whether this is endorsing the hero as sexually-terrified-asshole (as it were, almost literally) on some sort of unconscious level, or whether it is satirising this tendency. In this book, the entry into true experience of virtual reality, with smell and taste as well as the other senses, is by means of inserting this\n\n44\n\nBodyPunk.fm Page 45 Sunday, October 15, 2000 10:13 PM\n\nProctoProd into one’s anus. Bethke cannot be serious. At the same time this is hardly gut-wrenchingly funny. The Style: A running joke is the use of 'infonuggets' – boxed comments which give information about terms or characters mentioned in the text. The result is that the novel aspires to the condition of hypertext, and that Bethke does not have to disguise his infodumps when they happen, but make a virtue of them. The Pay-Off: Whilst some of the gags are funny (the khyberpunks, who are an on-line teenage mujahedin community, a fabulously wealthy author bearing a starling resemblance to Michael Crichton, and vandals who improve the condition of Burroughs' car by getting him a new stereo and respraying the bodywork) there is a sense of infantilism about this novel. Nevertheless, he mixes cyberpunk clichés and stereotypes with a genuinely gripping plot to produce an entertaining whole. There is little which is original here, but that is hardly the point.\n\nSimon Ings Simon Ings was born in 1965, and began his career in the anthology Other Edens III (1989), before publishing in Interzone, New Worlds and Omni. His second novel City Of The Iron Fish (1994) has been compared to Gormenghast (1950) and to M John Harrison’s Viriconium (1988); it should not be a surprise that he collaborated on a story with Harrison, 'The Rio Brain' (Interzone 104, February 1996). His first novel, however, is post-cyberpunk.\n\nHot Head (1992) The Set-Up: Humanity has succeeded in building machines capable of replicating themselves, but has lost control of them. Malise Arnim was involved in fighting one of the early ones, the Moonwolf, and now Earth faces another invasion. And Malise, just possibly, has the information to stop them. The Hero/Femme Fatale: Malise shows great prowess and ability in fighting others, and getting out of sticky situations. She is augmented with a data-fat, a means of linking to sources of information. This is illegal technology, which doesn’t help Malise in her quest for a quiet life. Her sexual partners are predominately – but not exclusively – female. This is typical of the practice of a number of male Br"
