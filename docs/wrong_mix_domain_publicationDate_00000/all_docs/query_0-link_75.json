He adds, \"Seen from sufficient distance, this is a small topic.\"Sterling offers a brilliant, often hilarious history of shaped things. We have moved from an age of artifacts, made by hand, through complex machines, to the current era of \"gizmos.\" New forms of design and manufacture are appearing that lack historical precedent, he writes; but the production methods, using archaic forms of energy and materials that are finite and toxic, are not sustainable. The future will see a new kind of object ;we have the primitive forms of them now in our pockets and briefcases: user-alterable, baroquely multi-featured, and programmable ;that will be sustainable, enhanceable, and uniquely identifiable. Sterling coins the term \"spime\" for them, these future manufactured objects with informational support so extensive and rich that they are regarded as material instantiations of an immaterial system. Spimes are designed on screens, fabricated by digital means, and precisely tracked through space and time. They are made of substances that can be folded back into the production stream of future spimes, challenging all of us to become involved in their production. Spimes are coming, says Sterling. We will need these objects in order to live; we won't be able to surrender their advantages without awful consequences.",
