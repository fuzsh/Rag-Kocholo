        "text": "book review Distraction\n\nBy Robin Vidimos\n\nSpecial to The Denver Post\n\nDISTRACTION\n\nBy Bruce Sterling\n\nBantam Spectra, $23.95\n\nDec. 20 - Bruce Sterling takes a long, dark look at an encroaching future in his latest piece of cyberpunk fiction, \"Distraction.'' The novel is based in a soon-to-be reality that rises not from apocalyptic ash but from logical extremes of contemporary society.\n\nIn this bleak future, the lives of a disaffected population are held in check by a questionably benevolent government whose rules are enforced by a pervasive web of information technology. Outside the core of this bedeviled and bugged society are the punks of the cyberpunk world, a population of rovers and misfits who live on the edge, working to turn technology to their advantage.\n\nIn Sterling's vision of the nearfuture, the United States government is bankrupt and in the midst of a cold war with Holland. Basic scientific investigation is breathing a final gasp because for-profit labs have been robbed of patent and intellectual rights. U.S. currency has fallen into disuse because all but the smallest bills are bugged, and rival gangs are fighting over the computer hardware preferences.\n\nOscar Valparaiso is a key player in this society. As a political consultant on assignment for his newly elected boss, Massachusetts Sen. Alcott Bambakais, Oscar and the ragtag remains of his campaign crew travel to the Deep South. He is charged with checking into the operations of the Buna National Collaboratory, located just across the Louisiana border in east Texas.\n\nThe Buna Collaboratory is federal pork-barrel politics taken to the extreme. Established to resurrect species rendered extinct by climactic change, this domed installation is lush with vegetation and rife with rare animals. It also houses an organization, riddled with corruption, that has become the power base for Gov. Etienne-Gaspard Huguelet,\n\n\"Green Huey,'' the despotic ruler of the state of Louisiana.\n\nOnce Oscar and his gang descend on the Collaboratory, Oscar forms an alliance with one of the few true scientists left at the lab, Nobel laureate Dr. Greta Penninger. Motivated by her work and being one of the very few people able to overlook Oscar's \"personal problem'' - Oscar is the product of an embryo farm and his DNA isn't entirely human - she agrees to work with him to clean out the lab, provided she is allowed to continue her valued research.\n\nOscar and Greta's work is at a cross-purpose with Green Huey's plans, and the power struggle that ensues reveals more than simple weird science.\n\n\"Distraction'' is an imaginative but fragmented novel. Sterling weaves a whole cloth of the future, threading through details that illuminate his world with cynical humor. For all the originality of this creation, though, the plot never quite gels. The relationship between foreign and domestic intrigues and the power struggle between state and federal governments, while interesting, come together in a confused finish.\n\nThis ambitious fault is not a reason to avoid the novel - the society that is the product of Sterling's creative vision makes"
