        "text": "Isaac Asimov’s Foundation was among the first SF novels I read, and the one that hooked me on the genre. In 2020, the year Asimov would have turned 100, I have set myself the challenge of rereading the Foundation universe in chronological order. The reading order is listed below, with reviews being added as I complete each book. But first, three pieces of housekeeping.\n\nWhile there are dozens of short stories that take place or could take place in the Foundation universe, notably Mirror Image, I have limited the list to those directly referenced within the larger canon. These stories are often brilliant, I simply don’t have time to review each one individually.\n\nThe Second Foundation Trilogy by David Brin, Gregory Benford and Greg Cox, while authorised by the Asimov estate does not appear on this list. Mostly so I don’t have to suffer through Voltaire again. However, the second and third instalments in that trilogy are actually very good. Foundation’s Triumph may even be one of the best shared universe books there is. Again, I cut these out partly for clarity, and partly for timekeeping.\n\nLikewise, other authorised, semi-authorised or unauthorised Foundation books will not be included. This includes Isaac Asimov’s Robot City, Isaac Asimov’s Utopia by Roger MacBride Allen, and the Micky Zucker Reicherd I, Robot novels.\n\nThe chronological ordering of books is below. Click the links once they’re added to reach the individual reviews.\n\nThe End of Eternity\n\nI, Robot\n\nThe Positronic Man (with Robert Silverberg)\n\nNemesis\n\nRobots #1: The Caves of Steel\n\nRobots #2: The Naked Sun\n\nRobots #3: The Robots of Dawn\n\nRobots #4: Robots and Empire\n\nGalactic Empire #2: The Stars Like Dust\n\nGalactic Empire #3: The Currents of Space\n\nGalactic Empire #1: Pebble in the Sky\n\nFoundation Prequel #1: Prelude to Foundation\n\nFoundation Prequel #2: Forward the Foundation\n\nFoundation #1: Foundation\n\nFoundation #2: Foundation and Empire\n\nFoundation #3: Second Foundation\n\nFoundation #4: Foundation’s Edge\n\nFoundation #5: Foundation and Earth\n\nBonus Content"
