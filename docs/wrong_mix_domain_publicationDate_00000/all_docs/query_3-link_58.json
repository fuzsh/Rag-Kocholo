        "text": "It’s taken me a long-long time to realize it, but it’s true. Bruce Sterling is less a writer of stories and more a presenter of extended vignettes of speculative settings. He creates the imaginative space, its ideas and concepts, then mixes in the people who bring it to life. His novels feel more like dynamic tours rather than classic into-body-climax-conclusion arcs. Presenting another such vignette by mixing cyberpunk with global climate change is Heavy Weather (1994).\n\nHeavy Weather is set in the year 2031, a time after which major changes in weather patterns have swept the globe. Devastating agriculture and human health, a new take at life has emerged, one more minimalist yet tech-based. Convalescing in a Mexican clinic is Alex, a young man whose lungs are full of the detritus from the climate fall out. Having received treatment, Alex’s sister Jane decides to kidnap him from the clinic, and bring her onboard her Troupe of storm chasers. Reluctantly becoming a member, he stands in amazement as the Troupe uses the most sophisticated technology humanity has to offer to collect data from the massive tornadoes sweeping East Texas and Oklahoma. It isn’t long before the fever grabs him and he too looks to find the ‘big one’.\n\nTwo years after the publication of Heavy Weather, Hollywood released the film Twister. Using Sterling’s idea and dumbing it down, readers should feel comfortable that the novel being reviewed here adds a thick layer of cyberpunk which makes the whole a more imaginative, less operatic, and for me at least, a more engaging, experience."
