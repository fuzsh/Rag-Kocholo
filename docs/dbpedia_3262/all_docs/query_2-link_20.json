        "text": "Visitation: Friday, March 8, 2024, 2-4 & 6-8 p.m.; Devlin Funeral Home, Inc., Ross Twp.\n\nService: Private\n\nDavid Lyon Fisher, of Ross Township, passed away Friday March 1, 2024 at the age of 72. He is survived by his daughters Sarah, Julie, and Katherine; grandchildren Melody and Darien; siblings Linda, Gary, and Jeff; and many other relatives. He was the loving husband of the late Lynne Ducharme Fisher and son of the late Don and Geddy Fisher.\n\nDavid will be remembered as a man whose quiet facade sometimes hid his steadfastness, loyalty, and wicked sense of humor. He was an incredible mechanic who could work on everything from motorcycles, which he went to school for, to the biggest diesel engines, which he worked on for most of his career. His family never had to worry about car repair or maintenance due to his love of cars and working on them. One of his proudest moments was when he came home from work to find one of his daughters fixing her own car.\n\nWhen his daughters were young, he gladly endured countless hours of playing Pretty Pretty Princess or getting involved with whatever craft was being made. He was even a Girl Scout for a while. He adored his grandkids and moved mountains to make sure they were healthy and happy, just as he always made sure his family was taken care of during Lynneâ€™s lengthy battles with cancer. He always had a story about some joke or prank that happened at work and even more about the hijinks of his younger years.\n\nHe will be deeply missed.\n\nFamily will receive friends Friday 2-4 & 6-8 p.m. at Devlin Funeral Home, Inc., 806 Perry Hwy, North Hills. Service and Interment private"
