        "text": "HARTINGTON — David A. Fischer Sr., 74, Hartington, died surrounded by his family June 18, 2019, at Avera Sacred Heart Medical Center, Yankton, S.D.\n\nVisitation and a rosary were Friday at the church.\n\nFuneral services were June 21 at Holy Family (Sts, Peter and Paul Catholic Church), Bow Valley.\n\nBurial was in the Sts. Peter and Paul Cemetery, Bow Valley.\n\nPallbearers were David Fischer Jr., Joe Fischer, John Fischer, Tom Fischer, Dan Fischer and Tom Wiebelhaus. Honorary pallbearers were all of David’s grandchildren.\n\nArrangements were under the direction of the Wintz Funeral Home, Hartington.\n\nDavid was born Dec. 26, 1944, on the Fischer Family Farm near Hartington, the second of four children, to Alma and Emery Fischer. He spent his youth attending school at rural District 82, breaking horses, participating in horsemanship events and helping his dad maintain the family farm, until he met the love of his life, Vonda Kollars, in 1970. By Valentine’s Day of 1971, the pair were engaged and Aug. 8 of the same year, they were married at Sts. Peter and Paul Catholic Church. During their 47 years of marriage, the pair raised 11 children on the same farm his parents raised him. As history enthusiasts, after each year’s spring planting, David and Vonda took their children on summer vacations to historical sites found throughout the United States. On top of managing the family farm and raising children, David found his time well spent staying active in church and family events.\n\nDavid is survived by his wife, Vonda; children, Ruth and Tom Wiebelhaus, Fordyce; David Jr. and Laura Fischer, Fordyce; Joe and Mindy Fischer, Viborg, S.D.; John and Jana Fischer, Lincoln; Karen Nielsen, Lincoln; Jean and Chris Venne, Lincoln; Mary and Chris Wray, Florissant, Colo.; Lisa Fischer, Ord; Tom and Katie Fischer, Hartington; Dan and Denise Fischer, Hartington; grandchildren, Kyle, Sara, Alexandra, Jakob, Persephone, Selene, Willow, Riggin, McKinley, Rustin and Roger Fischer; Emma, Josh, Seth and Issak Wiebelhaus; Jessica and Daryl Lambert; Levi Nielsen; April Venne; William and Ava Wray; siblings, MaDonna Fischer, Linda and Leon Steffen; in-laws, Collin and Carrol Kollars, Gary and Dori Kollars, Dale and Jan Kollars, June and Richard Derby, Tom and Esther Kollars, Patrick and Joan Kollars, Mark and Lydia Kollars, Todd and Gail Kollars, Paula Jo and Tim Goodrich, as well as countless other nieces, nephews and cousins.\n\nDavid was preceded in death by his parents, Alma and Emery; his oldest sister, Marie; a son, who died at childbirth; a son, Bill; and his wife’s parents, Darlo and Irene Kollars.\n\nMemorials may be directed to the Fischer Family Farm, in card of Vonda Fischer, 89141 561 Ave., Hartington, NE 68739."
