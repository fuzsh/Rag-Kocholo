        "text": "Real Name: David Harry Fisher\n\nAliases: David Fisher, David Harry Snyder\n\nWanted For: Murder, Escape\n\nMissing Since: September 1, 1974\n\nCase\n\nDetails: David Harry Fisher is wanted for prison escape; he was serving a twenty-year sentence for the murder of thirteen-year-old Laura Burbank. She was a frequent visitor to the pet store at B&I Shopping Center on South Tacoma Way in Tacoma, Washington. In June 1970, she made friends with Fisher, then twenty-nine, who was an employee of the pet store. They often talked about their love of animals. She did not know it at the time, but he was the most dangerous friend she could ever have made.\n\nAccording to Dr. David Smith, a psychologist, Fisher is interested in exploiting young, vulnerable girls. He will look for such targets. He will case them, and he will spend a lot of his time thinking about how he can go about overpowering them, controlling them, and using them for \"sexual ends\". He is very interested in finding someone with whom he can carry out his fantasies. On June 30, 1970, Laura disappeared following a visit to the pet store. He was the chief suspect in her disappearance.\n\nWarning our children not to talk to strangers is, of course, good advice. But it may not be enough. The horrifying fact is that more than 80% of all sex crimes committed against children are perpetrated by friends and relatives, people the children know. Such was this case. Laura was lulled into a false sense of security by a man who claimed to share her love of animals.\n\nFisher told Laura that he was an animal trainer. She became entranced by the thought that she might be able to learn to train animals herself. On June 29, 1970, he reportedly told her that he was going to start training monkeys the next day and asked for her help. She said that she would love to help. However, he said that he could not train them at the pet store; he would have to do so somewhere else. She said that was fine, as long as it was not too far away. He told her that it would take place nearby.\n\nAccording to Detective Dick Knabel, their initial investigation revealed that Laura had been at the pet store numerous times. Fisher had made a point of befriending her. She was very interested in the animals there. He apparently took this as an open invitation to further his relationship with her. On June 30, 1970, her parents, Ken and Dorothy, gave her permission to go to the pet store alone because her sister was sick, and her best friend was unavailable. She left around noon.\n\nShortly after 2pm that afternoon, one of Laura's neighbors, riding his daughter's horse, saw her in a parking lot near the pet store. She told her neighbor that a friend of hers was going to teach her how to train monkeys. Fifteen minutes later, when the neighbor rode by the parking lot again, she had already vanished. When she was not home by 2pm, Dorothy started worrying. She had a bad feeling because Laura always came home when she said she would. Ken was unable to sit and wait for her. He spent most of the afternoon and all night driving around looking for her. The next day, he continued searching for her. He knew something was wrong.\n\nAfter Laura was reported missing, the police questioned Fisher, who was at home with his sixteen-year-old wife. She was five months pregnant at the time. Detectives told him that several witnesses had seen him talking to Laura at the pet store. He claimed that a lot of kids talked to him there, but that did not mean that he knew them. He said he had never seen her and denied all knowledge of her. However, the police were suspicious of him because he seemed to show no emotion regarding her disappearance and did not seem concerned about her at all. One officer described him as \"personality-less\". However, no evidence was found to link him to her disappearance.\n\nFor two weeks, no other leads surfaced. The police did not believe Laura had run away, and they suspected foul play. Her family, meanwhile, could do nothing but wait. Dorothy recalls that it was a horrible feeling, not knowing where she was. She could hardly sleep at night. She would wake up in the middle of the night and stare out the window, knowing that she was out there somewhere.\n\nThe police got their first significant break in his case when Fisher's wife came to the station. She told them that one night, he had come home late and insisted that she wash a pair of jeans. She noticed that they were filthy. She wanted to continue reading, but he demanded that she clean them right away. According to Detective Knabel, Fisher was an \"immaculate dresser\". It was not common for him to have soiled clothing. And he was very adamant that she wash them immediately.\n\nFisher's wife also told police that two weeks after Laura went missing, she was doing their laundry when she found a pair of female underpants that she did not recognize. Police believe that Fisher either forgot that he had them or purposefully took them as a souvenir of his crime. Ken and Dorothy identified them as Laura's.\n\nNearly three months later, in September 1970, a group of children playing in the woods near the Rainier Olympia Highway in Olympia, Washington, thirty miles from where Laura had last been seen, found her body in a shallow grave. It was identified as hers on September 22. Although it was badly decomposed, authorities were able to determine that she had been sexually molested and then killed by a blow to the head. They soon learned that on the day of her disappearance, witnesses driving near the crime scene had seen a pet store truck that Fisher had access to.\n\nOn September 25, the police filed charges of first-degree murder against Fisher, but he disappeared. Eight days later, he and his lawyer finally came into the Pierce County, Washington, sheriff's department. He said to the detectives, \"You've got me now.\" Then, he asked to remain free for the birth of his first child. His request was denied.\n\nBecause the evidence was circumstantial, Fisher pleaded guilty to second-degree manslaughter in January 1971. He was sentenced to twenty years at the Washington State Prison in Walla Walla. For three years, he was a model prisoner. His sentence was reduced, and after he allegedly \"smooth-talked\" prison authorities, he was assigned to the prison's minimum security honor farm. In 1974, it had no walls or security fences to keep the prisoners inside. In the late afternoon of September 1, 1974, he simply walked away. No one noticed he was missing until the midnight prisoner count. By that time, he had several hours' head start, and the authorities were unable to apprehend him.\n\nFor fifteen years, Fisher has been free to function in society, and authorities fear that his pathological criminal tendencies remain. According to Dr. Smith, Fisher probably does not recognize his own problems. He probably is not aware that he has a lot of \"internal turmoil\". He has been like this for a long time. According to Dr. Smith, antisocial personalities generally start their deviant or criminal behavior early in life, and it gets worse as they get older.\n\nDetective Knabel notes that Fisher is capable of anything, including murder. He has proven that through Laura's murder. Detective Knabel can only theorize what he has done since his 1974 escape. Since Laura died, three other Tacoma girls have been murdered under strikingly similar circumstances. In 1980, thirteen-year-old Carla Wright disappeared on her way to school on Tacoma's south end. Six years later, in 1986, twelve-year-old Michella Welch disappeared from Puget Sound Park in Tacoma. Five months after that, thirteen-year-old Jenny Bastian disappeared from Tacoma's Point Defiance Park. Eventually, all of their bodies were found in wooded areas not far from the places where they disappeared.\n\nDetective Knabel believes that Fisher is an extremely frustrated person. He knows he is on the run and wanted. Detective Knabel believes it is simply a matter of time before he is caught. He also believes that Fisher is extremely volatile. Laura is the only proven victim of his. Dorothy said there is always an emptiness inside of her. Once in a while, she will catch herself thinking, \"What would Laura have been like now? What would she have done with her life?\" Ken believes that if he could be caught and put away for life, someone else’s life could be saved. He says that a young child's life is very important, whether it is his child or someone else's.\n\nExtra Notes:\n\nThis case first aired on the December 6, 1989 episode; it was updated on the March 21, 1990 episode.\n\nIt was excluded from the FilmRise release of the Robert Stack episodes.\n\nThe show had contacted Detective Knabel looking for story ideas; sheriff's captain Gary Smith suggested this case to Knabel, who then suggested it to the show.\n\nSome sources state that Laura vanished on July 1, 1970, and that Fisher escaped on August 31, 1974.\n\nFor reasons unknown, authorities never informed Laura's family about Fisher's escape. They did not find out about it until 1986, when Dorothy read an article about it in the newspaper.\n\nResults: Captured. On the night of the broadcast, Canadian authorities received a call from a viewer who recognized Fisher as a local door-to-door book salesman named \"Michael Raymond Porter\". On January 4, 1990, he was arrested by officers of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police at his home in Sherwood Park, near Edmonton, Alberta. They confirmed his identity through photographs and a tattoo on his arm. At the time, he was living with his wife of eleven years and their three children. Along with being a salesman, he also performed magic shows in elementary and nursery schools. Surprisingly, he had watched the broadcast and was \"not surprised\" when officers came to arrest him.\n\nAccording to Fisher's attorney, his wife was very supportive of him; she said he was \"always a very caring and loving husband and father\". She was unaware of his criminal history. Former neighbors described him as \"strange\" and said that he \"gave [them] the creeps\".\n\nAuthorities believe that Fisher fled to Canada within days of his escape. He first crossed the border into Manitoba, then went to Vancouver's Skid Road, where he bought a false set of identification papers for $50. He got his job as a salesman soon after and spent several years living in British Columbia. He spent most of his time traveling throughout Canada but made occasional trips back to Washington.\n\nOn January 9, 1990, more than fifteen years after Fisher escaped, he was extradited back to the United States. He continued serving his sentence in a medium-security prison in Shelton, Washington. If it had not been for his escape, he could have been released in 1991. It is not known if he received extra time for his escape. It is believed that he was paroled in the late 1990s; however, this has not been confirmed.\n\nAuthorities in both the United States and Canada investigated several unsolved cases in which Fisher was a possible suspect. Among those were the infamous Highway of Tears murders in British Columbia. He had lived there for several years and often traveled on highways for his work. Most of the victims were found along highways there. However, it is not known if any other crimes were ever officially attributed to him. Jenny and Michella's murders have since been solved due to DNA testing; Fisher was not involved in either case.\n\nLinks:"
