        "text": "FISHER, David James - It is with great sadness we announce the passing of David James Fisher, 57, of Trenton on June 28, 2007 in the Aberdeen Hospital, New Glasgow. David was a wonderful man with a kind, generous heart, who achieved great satisfaction in life helping those around him in anyway he could. David leaves behind a family he dearly loved, his loving wife Mary, who devoted her strength, and endless love in caring for David during his courageous battle with cancer. His loving children, Rodney (Jennifer), Michelle (Jamie) Greig, Grand Prairie, Alta; Jeffery (Kara), Clairmont, Alta; Stephen, Abercrombie; and stepdaughter, Heidi, at home; grandchildren, who David cherished dearly, Ryan, Trinity and Kiersten; father, Harold, Oregon, USA; brothers, Ivan (Ann), New Glasgow; Alan (Paula), Truro; sisters, Arlene (Brian) McCracken, Bluesky, Alta; Debbie (Stewart) Wilson, Berwyn, Alta; a niece and nephews; several aunts, uncles and cousins. David was predeceased by his mother, Betty (Mills); brother, Harold in infancy. David was employed for 39 years at Trenton Works, holding various positions within management. He enjoyed traveling, especially on his motorcycle, and spending time on his son Stephen’s boat. David’s greatest joy of all was spending time with his family, and friends. We love you David, and we will all miss you dearly. Visitation will be 2-4 & 7-9 p.m. Saturday in P. & K. MacDonald Funeral Home, New Glasgow from where funeral service will be held 2 p.m. Sunday in the chapel with Pastor Doug Campbell officiating. Private interment will be in Lorne Street Cemetery, New Glasgow. Donations in David’s memory may be made to the Aberdeen Palliative Care Society."
