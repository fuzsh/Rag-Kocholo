Updated by the P.O.W.\n\nNETWORK with information from Australia's Bob Coker. 2009\n\nREMARKS:\n\nSYNOPSIS: In 1984, the Australian government sent delegates to Vietnam to\n\nfind fresh evidence on missing Australians. It was abandoned when the party\n\nfailed to learn anything about the men's fate. Australian foreign affairs\n\nminister, Bill Hayden, recommended the cases be closed, that the Vietnamese\n\ngovernment had cooperated fully with the search and the subject of the\n\nmissing men, and it should no longer be an issue between the two countries.\n\nYet reports continue to be received in the U.S. from refugees and\n\nintelligence sources convincing many authorities that hundreds of servicemen\n\nare still being held captive. The veterans of Australia, like those of\n\nCanada and the U.S. refuse to accept their governments' dismissal of the\n\nissue.\n\nAt least five Australians are missing who were not directly associated with\n\nU.S. forces. One of the five is Pvt. David J.E. Fisher, lost on September\n\n27, 1969.\n\nFisher was a member of J troop in the Australian Special Air Service, a\n\nservice unit similar to the U.S. Army Special Forces. On September 27, 1969,\n\nJ troop engaged and killed five Viet Cong. As the patrol withdrew they\n\nencountered about 30 of the enemy, and requested an emergency extraction.\n\nThe rescue helicopter dropped ropes through the trees to lift the troops to\n\nsafety. Fisher and the rest of the unit were lifted out on the ropes, but\n\nFisher lost his grip and fell from an altitude of about 30 meters.\n\nSearch teams tried to locate Fisher but were unsuccessful. They were\n\nuncertain if he could have survived, but felt the dense jungle foliage might\n\nhave cushioned his fall. There were also a number of water-filled craters in\n\nthe area and had Fisher been injured and fallen into one of them, he\n\nprobably would not have survived. Fisher was classified Missing in Action.\n\nDavid J.E. Fisher's name does not appear on most U.S. lists since he was not\n\na U.S. citizen. However, as thousands of U.S. veterans would confirm, the\n\n\"Aussies\" were welcome additions to any mission. Their bravery was well\n\nknown, and they were well-liked. 47,000 Australians were sent to Vietnam\n\nbetween 1961 and 1971; 504 were killed and 2,500 were wounded. None were\n\ncaptured -- or were they?\n\nThe Australians sent their young men to help in a war that was not their\n\nown. It is fitting that Americans should include their missing in their\n\nquest for freedom for those still prisoner, missing or unaccounted for in\n\nSoutheast Asia.\n\n==================\n\nhttp://www.awm.gov.au/database/roh.asp?surname=fisher&conflict=VN\n\nFisher, D J E\n\nNumber: 2787344\n\nRank: Private [Pte]\n\nUnit: 3 SAS Sqn SASR (RA INF)\n\nService: Army\n\nConflict: Vietnam, 1962-1972\n\nDate of Death: 27/09/1969\n\nPlace of Death: South Vietnam\n\nCause of Death: Missing presumed dead (battle casualty)\n\nMemorial Panel: 5\n\nCemetery or Memorial Details:\n\nNext Of Kin: Father - Mr W A Fisher\n\nNotes:\n\nSource: AWM153 Roll of Honour cards, Vietnam\n\nRA"
