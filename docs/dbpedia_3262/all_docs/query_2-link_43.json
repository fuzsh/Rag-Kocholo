        "text": "David, the middle Fisher sibling, refers to himself as \"the stable one.\" He joined the family business at the age of twenty, lives in the same house where he grew up and is a life-long member of St. Bartholomew's Church. At the time of his father's death, David had been working at Fisher and Sons for eleven years â€” and was beginning to wonder whether he'd made the right choice. So while he initially resisted Nate's suggestion that they sell the funeral home, David realized it might afford him the opportunity to pursue the things he'd always wanted in life, like going to law school. When Nate did an about face, however, David pushed his own interests aside and agreed to keep Fisher and Sons going."
