        "text": "Lillian Louise Fisher, 53, of Meadville, passed peacefully in her sleep on May 26th, 2023.\n\nShe was born on December 23, 1969 to the late David and Lillian Fisher in Geneva, OH.\n\nLil moved with her mother to Meadville, in the early 90's after her father's death. Lil became a part of The Arc of Crawford County's residential services upon moving to Meadville and enjoyed living with several housemates before moving into the home of Marilyn Penfield, her former staff, in a life sharing arrangement. Lil was fiercely loved by all members of the Penfield clan, joining in their bonfires, camping trips, and family gatherings over a period of 16 years.\n\nLillian was also a part of the day program services offered at UCIP, making many friends there, especially Sue Eells, Joe D, and Karen S. Lil moved into the home of Judy Corey, after Marilyn's retirement, and enjoyed the care and companionship of Judy, her daughter Elaine, and granddaughter Kasey. Other life sharing providers who welcomed Lil into their homes were Sheri and Greg Hoban and Joy and Tim Vogel, along with Danny M. Due to changes in her health, in 2020, Lillian moved into an ARC community home and has enjoyed her housemates, Beth and Cathy as well as the staff there for the past several years.\n\nLil was proud of her Autism diagnosis and traveled throughout PA and New York in the 90's learning about facilitated communication and becoming an amazing self-advocate. One of her greatest memories was meeting Temple Grandin at a conference and it was a moment she kept close to her heart for many years.\n\nLil was an amazing and devoted daughter to her mom, who she visited weekly. Lil always made sure she bought just the right snacks to take to her mom, and they enjoyed a very special bond. Lil had an incredible sense of humor! She kept those close to her in stitches with her one liners! Lil was kind, caring, and truly unique. It is impossible to imagine the days ahead without her smile, her singing, and her joyful presence. Lil was the type of person who touched the very heart of those who were lucky enough to be in her company. She will be deeply and profoundly missed.\n\nLillian was cared for at home, by the dedicated staff at Jefferson Street, and with the assistance of Lakeland Area Hospice. Lil was preceded in death by her parents. She is survived by her sister and two nieces.\n\nVisitation will be held from 10:30-11:00 AM on Tuesday, June 6, 2023, at New Beginnings Church of God, 13226 Leslie Rd, Meadville, where a Memorial Service will follow at 11 AM with Pastor Tory Hough officiating.\n\nLil will be reunited with her mother and laid to rest in Greendale Cemetery.\n\nArrangements are under the direction of STEPHEN P. MIZNER FUNERAL HOME & CREMATION SERVICES, INC., 404 CHESTNUT ST., MEADVILLE.\n\nShare a memory or condolence at www.miznerfuneralhome.com"
