        "text": "“Six Feet Under,” the acclaimed HBO drama that premiered 20 years ago this week, was based on the hard but undeniable truth that “death and life are inextricable,” said the producer Alan Poul. So it’s fitting that its own life began with the death of a different show.\n\nIn 1999, at the same time Alan Ball’s movie “American Beauty,” directed by Sam Mendes, was en route to winning an Oscar for best picture (and winning Ball an award for best original screenplay), Ball’s ABC sitcom “Oh, Grow Up” was floundering in the ratings. At a lunch, the HBO executive Carolyn Strauss pitched Ball a series idea set in a family-run funeral home. Soon after, “Oh, Grow Up” was canceled and Ball wrote the pilot for the funeral-home show on spec, smuggling in variants of his sitcom characters.\n\n“There was a very conservative gay guy; there was a sort of Lothario prodigal son,” Ball said in a recent video interview. “There was a precocious teenage daughter.”\n\nThese were the Fisher children, who would muddle through their various existential difficulties while living and working within the confines of the family’s funeral home. They also represented facets of Ball’s own personality. “As a gay man, I was mining my experience for David,” said Ball, who described David, the fretful brother played by Michael C. Hall, as “a guy whose worst enemy is himself.”\n\n“As somebody who took a long time to grow up and still fought it every step along the way, I was pouring that into Nate,” he added. “And as somebody who aspires to be an artist and aspires to create work that is meaningful, that was Claire.”\n\nBall was used to receiving detailed feedback from network executives on his writing, which made it all the more gratifying when Strauss had just one note: “Could you make the whole thing just a little more [expletive] up?”\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
