        "text": "\"He bought a ticket home, he had booked the 24th,\" Kate said. \"He was supposed to come home, Christmas Eve.\"\n\nSadly David, the youngest of four children, never returned home. He went missing just off Stevensons Island in Lake Wanaka about midday on December 15 while trying to retrieve a drifting boat. The police national dive squad found his body the next day, not far from where he disappeared.\n\nHis body will be returned to his family today.But Fisher's sister Rochelle says he left the world doing what he loved. His job as a tour guide had seen him travel to many places and meet many faces.\n\n\"He lived for the outdoors,\" she said. \"A thrill seeker.\n\n\"It was the perfect job, not many people can say they are doing a job they love,\" Rochelle said.\n\nDavid left school to travel Europe solo at age 15, travelling to Bali, India and many other places around the world. He had spent the past few years travelling around the South Island.\n\nThe former Tauranga Boys College student would return to Mount Maunganui between adventures.\n\nHe would visit friends and work at local cafes including Cafe 88, Me & You, Little & Long.\n\n\"He just touched everybody in his own quiet way,\" Mum Kate said. \"I don't think there was anybody he didn't get on with. He had a heart of gold.\"\n\n\"You would never, ever heard him say a bad word about anybody,\" Mike said.\n\nPhotos of David were hung in his mother's lounge in memory of the 26-year-old. They include photos of David hiking mountains, running marathons and other \"crazy adventures\".\n\nHe was fit, really fit. \"He could run a half marathon in under an hour and a half,\" Mike said.\n\nAnd he would always set himself challenges. A couple of years ago, a community challenge invited people to walk up the Mount 38 times in 50 days to raise funds for the local surf lifesaving club.\n\n\"Dave decided to run it 100 times in 50 days,\" Mike said. \"He did nine times back to back on the last day cause he was behind.\"\n\nEven from a young age, he would do things his way. The day before he was meant to start his first day at intermediate school, David had made his own lunch and biked to Tauranga Primary School, where he intended to re-enrol himself for the next few years.\n\n\"His last two years of primary school we were a little bit concerned that he gets the last two right before he goes to intermediate,\" Mike said. \"But he had other ideas, right up until the last minute he decided he wasn't going to go to this new school and he never did.\"\n\nDavid enjoyed photography and he would often post photos of his scenery on Instagram.\n\nHe had also taken up motocross at age 12 and left college early to start a professional career riding at a national level. \"He was top three in New Zealand,\" Mike said.\n\nHowever, he had to give up motocross at age 18 after multiple broken bones and concussions and began working as a salesman at a motorcycle store in Tauranga.\n\nThe family were at a loss as to what life would be like now without their beloved David.\n\n\"I don't really want to think about it,\" his father said.\n\n\"He is now off on his next adventure.\"\n\nTHANK YOU FROM THE FISHERS:\n\n\"We would like to thank everyone involved in the search and the process of finding Dave. As well as the ones who did their best to try save [him] and all the support we have received since Friday.\""
