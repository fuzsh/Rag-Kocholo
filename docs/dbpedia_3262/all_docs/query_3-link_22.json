        "text": "FISHER Family History, Part I\n\nAugust 2024\n\nThe surname \"Fisher\" is derived from the Old English \"fiscere\" - \"to fish.\" It since became the Middle English \"FISCHER\" and also has Low German variants of \"Fisser,\" \"Visser,\" and \"Wisser.\"\n\nOur branch of the Fisher family begins with David Fisher, Sr.1 (born c. 1795, PA) and his wife, Sophia Weeks1 (or Meeks) (born 1796, PA). They started a family in Clinton County, Ohio, by 1819 and later passed through Vernon Township, Hancock County, Indiana (1833); Madison County, Illinois (c. 1843); and settled in Washington Township (Ashland, between present day Eldon and Agency), Wapello County, Iowa in 1850. From here the family branches out to Nebraska and Kansas: King David2 and his family moved to Hebron, Thayer County, Nebraska and later Sherman County, Nebraska; Sylvester and his family moved to Marshal County, Kansas and Whiterock, Republic County, Kansas (1866).\n\nFollowing King David's death in 1871, his son John Jackson moved to Sherman County in central Nebraska, but in the late 1880's or more likely early 1890's headed west to California and resettled in Sonoma County, the center for some 600 descendants.\n\nDavid FISHER1 (~1794-1868)\n\n1. David Fisher1 was born in 1794 or 1795 in Pennsylvania. He married Sarah Weeks (or possibly Meeks), a native of Pennsylvania, and began their family of at least nine children there. After Sarah passed away (after 1856), David remarried to the widow Nancy (Bowles) Rickey on December 6, 1863, and fathered three more children:\n\n1A.

By 1819, the family moved west to Clark Township, in the general vicinty of Martinsville, Clinton County, Ohio, where the next five children were born.\n\nIn 1833 the Fisher family continued westward into Indiana and on November 20, 1833, purchased 60 acres in the N½ of NE¼ of Section 10, Range 6 East of Vernon Township, Hancock County, Indiana, which is estimated to lie to the northeast of Fortville along modern-day East Broadway (Route 67). His family may have remained behind temporarily as David's fourth son Sylvester was born back in Clinton County, Ohio, that December.\n\nCome the new year, David purchased another 80 acres on April 11, 1834, in the E½ of SE¼ of the same section, which is estimated to lie to the south of modern-day 1050N and north of W1000N. This second estate he sold on March 1, 1837, for $200.\n\nIn 1836, David's second son, King David Fisher, bought the 40 acres of the SW¼ of NE¼ of the same Section 10.\n\nSon Samuel Martin and daughter Catherine both started their families in Vernon and gave David and Sarah their first grandchildren there. Catherine possibly stayed behind in Indiana when the Fisher family moved to Illinois before 1843.\n\nOn April 2, 1850, David sold both his Indiana estate and his son's estate on for $1,100 and moved west to Ashland, Washington Township, Wapello County, Iowa.\n\nOn May 10, 1850, David Fisher paid $900 to Joseph Finarty of Wapello County for the NW¼ of SW¼ and 60 acres of the west side of west half of the NW¼ of Section 14, also the NE¼ of SE¼ of Section 22, all in Township 71 (Washington Township) N of range 12 West containing 140 acres. The 100 acres on the west side of Section 14 was to be the family home for the rest of David's and Sarah's lives. This farm was very near the town of Ashland which does not exist anymore. It was between Eldon and Agency, Iowa. The home was a 3-room house made of soft white pine, sided vertically with 12\" boards. Batting was placed over the siding edges. There was a lean-to on one side of the house. This house is still used as a shop on the farmstead across the road from where it was built.\n\nBy the census of August 1850, David's family and his son Samuel Martin's family were both resettled in District #13 in Wapello County, Iowa.\n\nSarah (Weeks) Fisher passed away about 1857 in Wapello County, Iowa, and was buried at the Ashland Cemetery in Wapello County.\n\nDavid remarried to Mrs. Nancy (Bowles) Rickey, the widow of the murdered Dr. Foster Rickey. Nancy and her two youngest sons, John and Curtis Howard Rickey, were enumerated with David in 1860[Cen 1860] however they were said to be married on December 6, 1863. They had three more children.\n\nDavid Fisher passed away on July 27, 1868, at the age of about 73. David is also buried at the Ashland Cemetery in Wapello County.\n\nAt David's death there was a court division of David's land and it was sold at public auction. The following is a list of heirs of his estate:\n\nName Relation Years Months Residence Nancy Fisher widow -- -- Iowa Martin Fisher son 52 6 Kansas Catherine Garrison daughter 51 3 Iowa David Fisher son 49 10 Missouri Mary Ann Parsons daughter 44 8 dead Elizabeth Miller daughter 47 8 dead Sarah Ellen Davis daughter 41 7 Indiana John Fisher son 37 11 Missouri Sylvester Fisher son 35 -- Nebraska Eliza Jane Parkhurst daughter 32 8 Iowa Melissa daughter 4 3 Iowa Isaac son 2 11 Iowa Wilbur son 0 4 Iowa\n\nAfter David's death, Nancy and her children stayed on with Martin Fisher, a close family relative, and his family in Wapello County. She continued on in Washington Township through at least the 1885 Iowa state census, in which she and sons Isaac and Wilbur were enumerated in Township 71 North, Range 12 West, Section 22, Southwest-Southeast, along with the widow Mrs. Elizabeth Ellen (Chapman) Priest, whose elder sister, Harriet J. Chapman6 had married David's grandson, John Jackson Fisher3.[Cen 1870,1880, 1885]\n\nSources\n\nCen 1820: 1820 Census, Clark Township, Clinton County, Ohio\n\nCen 1830: 1830 Census, Clark Township, Clinton County, Ohio\n\nCen 1840: 1840 Census, Vernon, Hancock County, Indiana\n\nCen 1850: 20 Aug 1850 Census, District 13, Wapello County, Iowa\n\nCen 1856: 1856 Iowa Census, Washington Township, Wapello County, Iowa\n\nCen 1860: 3 Jul 1860 Census, Ashland Post Office, Washington Township, Wapello County, Iowa\n\nCen 1870: 10 Aug 1870 Census, Ottumwa, Washington Township, Wapello County, Iowa\n\nCen 1880: 3 Jun 1880 Census, Washington Township, Wapello County, Iowa\n\nCen 1885: 1885 Iowa State Census, Washington Township, Wapello County, Iowa\n\nSamuel Martin FISHERΔ (1815-1892)\n\n1A. Samuel Martin FisherΔ was born in Pennsylvania in 1815. He married Rhuphema in Hancock County, Indiana about 1835 and had six children. A few months after Rhuphema's death, Samuel remarried to his brother's widow, Sophia Pritchard2. Sophia died a year and a half later and then Samuel remarried to Nancy P. Carter a few months after that.\n\n1A1. George W. FisherΔ 16 Feb 1837 4 May 1902 (65) 1A2. Sarah Fisher 1838 May 1860 (22) 1A3. James T. Fisher 24 Aug 1846 9 Nov 1871 (25) 1A4.

Fisher 1852 Aft 1910 (>58)\n\nSamuel Martin married Rhuphema, a native of Clinton County, Ohio, around 1835 in Hancock County, Indiana, where they bought property in Vernon Township. Their first child was born there in 1837 and soon after the family moved about 55 miles west to Madison County to a farm adjoining the widower George Hunter.[Cen 1840] Soon after George married the widow Permilla (Davis) Pritchard1, the mother of his future sister-in-law and later wife, Sophia Pritchard2.\n\nThe Fishers next relocated to Rock Island County, Illinois, probably by 1846, where the next three children were born. Between 1847 and 1850, the family moved across the Mississippi River to Fredonia Township, Louisa County, Iowa, where their sixth child was likely born.[Cen 1850] By 1858 the family moved about 340 miles southwest to Nehama County, Kansas; and ultimately in 1866 the moved another 100 miles west to White Rock Creek, Republic County, Kansas. Samuel was the first to settle the White Rock Creek area along with his wife, five children, and one grandchild.\n\nIn October 1866, Samuel, some visiting friends of his from Nemaha County, and other White Rock Creek settlers, went on a hunting trip through Holmwood and then southwest from Whitestone. There they were ambushed by a band of eight Indians. Outnumbered, Samuel offered no resistance and allowed the Indians to make off with surplus provisions, revolvers, and revolver ammunition. The Indians left them with a little food and their rifles and warned them not to hunt in that area as it was Indian hunting ground.\n\nGlad to escape so easily, the hunting party returned to the previous night's camp but during the next morning, a lone Indian rode up and took a fancy to John Marling's powder horn. The Indian decided it would make a nice gift and decided to take the powder horn much to Marling's chagrin. John Marling three months earlier had his wife dragged away with a rope around her neck and assaulted by Indians and was therefore unwilling to give any Indian anything. Samuel Fisher feared creating unnecessary trouble and so advised John Marling to surrender the powder horn. John did so. The Indian took the powder horn, wheeled his pony around to leave but suddenly turned and shot Samuel in the back. Before Marling could fire back, Samuel pleaded not to return fire.\n\nSamuel carried the bullet, and even a measure of respect for the Indians to his grave. He treasured a complete Indian suit and huge feather headdress which was given to him by other Indians.\n\nIn 1871, Samuel and Rhuphema's son, James T., died at the age of 25. That same year, Samuel's younger brother, King David died across the state line in Nebraska.\n\nRhuphema died on August 31, 1885, and was buried at the Persinger Cemetery in Republic County.\n\nFour months later, Samuel remarried his brother King David's widow, Sophia3, on December 22, 1885, in Loup City, Sherman County, Nebraska. They lived in Republic County but this marriage only lasted a year and a half before Sophia died.\n\nSamuel's farm was reportedly located near Otter Creek and present day Pawnee Lane (Road 510) in Republic County (6th Prime Meridian, Township 2 South, Range 5 West, WÂ½ of NWÂ¼ of Section 5, and also the EÂ½ of NEÂ¼ of Section 6, near the state line).[Grave] (This is lies to the south of Granite Road about 5 miles WSW of the city of Republic, and 2 miles due north of White Rock Cemetery.)\n\nSophia (Pritchard) Fisher3 died on May 17, 1887, while in her 60s. She was buried in Republic County, probably on her husband's farm.[Grave]\n\nOnce again, Samuel was remarried by year's end, this time to Nancy P. Carter on September 13, 1887. They wed in Republic County.\n\nSamuel moved to the tri-state area of Missouri, Arkansas, and Oklahoma, as did his niece, Ellen C. (Fisher) Pound, sometime between 1887 and 1891.\n\nSamuel Martin Fisher died in November 1892 at the age of 77 years in Benton County, Arkansas. He is reportedly buried at Stone Chapel Cemetery in the Flat Woods area southeast of Southwest City, McDonald County, Missouri.\n\nCatharine (FISHER) GARRISONΔ (1817-)\n\n1B. Catharine FisherΔ was born in 1817 in Pennsylvania. She married Elvy Garrison on March 28, 1833, in either Clinton County, Ohio, or Vernon Township, Hancock County, Indiana. They had at least 10 children:\n\n1BA. Sarah J. Garrison (1835) -- -- 1BB. Mary Ann GarrisonΔ (1837) 3 Jun 1898 (61) 1BC. Silas Garrison 5 Jul 1840/1841 27 Dec 1893 (53) 1BD.

By the 1860 census, they resettled in Batavia, Des Moines Township, Jefferson County, Iowa, where her brother King David, sister Mary Ann (Fisher) Parsons, and their families had settled in 1850 and 1851, respectively.[Cen 1860]\n\nCatharine was present at the death of her brother, King David, in Nebraska on July 12, 1871.\n\nElvy Garrison died on August 29, 1888, at about the age of 76.\n\nKing David FISHER2 (1819-1871)\n\n1C. King David Fisher2 was born on February 19, 1819, in Clinton County, Ohio. He stood about 6' 6\" tall. King married Sophia Pritchard3, a native of Indiana in 1840 or 1841. They had at least nine children, probably 12, born in Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, and Nebraska:\n\n1CA. John Jackson Fisher3 6 Jan 1843 8 May 1906 (63) 1CB. Mary C.

Fisher 9 Dec 1865 -- --\n\nAs a young man, King bought 40 acres in the SWÂ¼ of the NEÂ¼ of (Township 17 North), Range 6 East, Section 10, in Vernon Township, Hancock County, Indiana, in 1836. His father owned property to the north, northeast, and southeast in the same section.\n\nKing is said to have met his wife, Sophia Pritchard, near Louisville, Kentucky. They were wed in 1840 or 1841 and began their family in Illinois in 1843 with the birth of their first son, John Jackson. By 1846, the family moved to Indiana where the next four children were born.\n\nKing David allegedly left home to follow the Gold Rush to California but apparently returned to relocate to Batavia, Des Moines Township, Jefferson County, Iowa by the time of the 1850 census, along with his sisters Catharine (Fisher) Garrison, Mary Ann (Fisher) Parsons, and their families. Here they resided through the 1860 census until 1862 when the family moved again, this time to Big Sandy, Hobbs Precinct, Jefferson County in the Nebraska Territory—the heart of Pawnee territory—and homesteaded in the center of Section 9, Township 2 North, Range 2 West. Son John homesteaded in the northeast part of the same section. The family was run off the homestead in the summer of 1867 by Indians, ironically the same year that Nebraska gained statehood. It was probably in this attack that King David's second eldest son Isaac was killed. The Fisher family retreated east and resettled temporarily in Tarkio, Atchison County, Missouri for two years.\n\nOn June 1, 1869, King mustered in as a founding member and First Corporal (then at the age of 50) of the Nebraska Cavalry Militia, First Regiment, Company A, at Fort Butler to defend against Indian raids such as the one that drove his family out in 1867. He mustered along with three privates: Sylvester, age 19 (his son); James, age 24 (likely his nephew); and William, age 17 (likely his nephew and James' brother).\n\nIn 1870 a company of regular Army was stationed to the north at Kiowa which relieved Company A. At that time many soldiers took up claims in central and southern Thayer County, which likely prompted King's move from Big Sandy to Hebron. King homesteaded on Section 9 of Township 2 North, Range 2 West.\n\nKing David Fisher died of \"lung fever\" (or perhaps typhoid) in a dug-out on July 12, 1871, in Hebron, Thayer County, Nebraska. King David, by request, was buried on the homestead on a hill facing north overlooking the Little Blue River and the Oregon Trail. The hill had been a lookout for marauding Indians and lay between two springs (one known as Avalon Springs and later renamed Corliss Springs). King chose his final resting place so that he would never be thirsty. King Fisher's sister and son noted that he had joked with settlers of the area that they would have to shoot someone to start a graveyard—and he was the first of the group to die in Hebron.\n\nSome say the tombstone originally contained the description \"1st Sergeant, Fort Butler\" but if so no trace remains. Furthermore, a Hebron poet by the name of G. W. Wasson penned a 22 verse poem to commemorate King Fisher, part of which reads:\n\nAnother contemporary of King Fisher's was D. W. Hendershot, among the early settlers of Hebron, wrote to his grandchildren recalling:\n\nAmong King Fisher's estate was a rifle named \"Black Leg.\" King had broken the stock when he slipped and fell on the frozen Little Blue River. and patched the stock with a piece of brass. The rifle was passed to King's second youngest son, Ira who bagged his first elk around the Loup and Dismal rivers using \"Black Leg\" and later put it on display at the North Platte courthouse.\n\nAfter King\n\nKing's widow, Sophia received her patent (#1371) for 160 acres on February 7, 1876, but later moved to Clear Creek, Sherman County, in central Nebraska, by the 1880 census along with her three youngest sons and the families of her two eldest sons, John and Sylvester. Sophia remained in Clear Creek into 1885[Cen 1885] when her brother-in-law Samuel's wife died in August 1885 to the south in Republic County, Kansas. Sophia and Samuel married on December 22, 1885, in Loup City, Sherman County, and lived in Republic County. This marriage only lasted a year and a half before Sophia died.\n\nSophia (Pritchard) Fisher3 died on May 17, 1887, while in her 60s. She was buried in Republic County.\n\nKing Fisher Legacy\n\nKingfisher creek, township, and county, in Oklahoma, are said to be named for King David Fisher who camped along the creek in the days before the Chisholm Trail crossed through.\n\nPhoto caption:\n\n\"Picture of King David Fisher marker at Hebron, Nebraska. Nadine Walter made trip to Hebron to take this picture.\"\n\n\"Kingfisher\"\n\n\"For a long time the impression existed that the town of Kingfisher, county, creek, and township were named for the Kingfisher bird that is native of this general area of the southwest.\"\n\n\"Another theory was that the town was named for a John King Fisher (1854-1884), who controlled 5000 sq. miles in Dimmit County, Texas (southwest of San Antonio on the Mexican border). His parents were Joby (Jobe) and Lucinda Warren Fisher. Joby's parents were James and Anna Ladd Fisher. James came to Texas from Illinois. This King Fisher was known as an outlaw but died while helping on the sided of the law.\"\n\n\"Some people were of the opinion that there were two men who owned ranches in the vicinity of what is now Kingfisher. One man's name was King and the other Fisher. They thought King had operated the stage station in the early days, so when the town was laid out it was named after these two men.\"\n\n\"John D. Miles was appointed agent of the Cheyenne and Arapaho Indians in 1872 by President Grant, with headquarters at Darlington near El Reno. Mr. Miles became familiar with this part of the territory and its traditions, so is one of the most reliable authorities for the explanation that the creek was so called in honor of King Fisher (King David Fisher), a ranchman in the early day whose range and camps were on this stream. At that time he was known as a livestock trader, gambler, and when necessary, Indian fighter. He traveled in Oklahoma buying and selling cattle and he also had a string of stallions.\"\n\n\"Mr. Miles is also the authority for the explanation that \"Uncle John's\" Creek, which unites with Kingfisher Creek at the northeast corner of the townsite, was so-called owing to the fact that another ranchman who was popularly known as \"Uncle John\" held his cattle upon the grazing grounds along the creek.\"\n\n\"Settlements in Oklahoma along the famous Chisholm Cattle Trail, which started in 1867, and extended from Texas to Abilene, Kansas, were trading posts and stage stations. This was where stage coaches that carried passengers from Caldwell, Kansas to Ft. Reno and Ft. Sill could stop to change horses, food, eat, and rest. The \"King Fisher Stage Station\" was located just west of the present Kingfisher Post Office on the north banks of Kingfisher Creek and the road from there followed up 13th Street.\"\n\n\"This cattle trail lasted for about twenty years. When the Department of Interior made its plans to open Oklahoma Territory to white settlement in the early part of 1889, it had to provide for the location of two land offices. One land office was located on an acre of ground in the southeast corner of NW/4 of Sec. 15-16N-7W, at or near the \"King Fisher Stage Station\" on the Chisholm Trail. After the opening, the settlers joined these two names together and the village and town which grew up around the land office has since been known by the name of \"Kingfisher.\"\n\n\"King David Fisher\"\n\n\"David and Sarah Fisher were the parents of King David Fisher. He was born February 19, 1819, in Clinton County, Ohio, and grew to be about 6' 6\" tall. Both David and Sarah were born in Pennsylvania. David Fisher was born about 1794 and Sarah about 1795. They moved to Ohio with their family about 1818.\"\n\n\"Land records in Vernon Township, Handcock [sic] County, Indiana, showed David Fisher Sr. of Clinton County, Ohio, bought land in Ohio in November, 1833, and sold it April 2, 1850. King Fisher also owned land in Clinton County and sold it the same time his father did. David Fisher, Sr. then purchased land in Wapello County, Iowa, May 10, 1850 and lived there the remainder of his life. Sarah passed away first; David Fisher, Sr. passed away July 27, 1868.\"\n\n\"King David Fisher met Sophia Pritchard (who was born July 12, 1825) near Louisville, Kentucky. They were married in 1840 or 1841 and were the parents of 12 children.\"\n\n\"In 1849 King Fisher went to California to the Gold Rush. He had the reputation of going off and leaving Mrs. Fisher and the children to look after themselves the best they could. On one of these periods of being absent from home, he came to this part of Oklahoma where a town bears his name.\"\n\n\"On June 2, 1852, a daughter, Ellen C., was born in Wapello County, Iowa. The family probably remained there for ten years or more, as four more children were born there.\"\n\n\"King Fisher and Sophia homesteaded in the center of Sec. 9-2N-2 in Thayer County about two miles southeast of Hebron, Nebraska. This farm was crossed by the Little Blue River.\"\n\n\"Fort Butler was a stockade built about one mile southwest of Hebron for the protection of the settlers from Indian attacks. King Fisher served as 1st Sgt. at the fort. He always called his rifle 'blackleg'.\"\n\n\"Mrs. Garrison also told of 'hair raising' experiences in Indian raids.\"\n\n\"King Fisher's third child, Isaac, born May 10, 1847, was killed by the Indians. The Fisher family with their neighbors were driven out of Thayer County, in 1867, by the Indians, so they lived at Tarkio, Missouri, for two years before returning to their homestead.\"\n\n\"Mrs. Garrison was with King Fisher at the time of his death. He died of Lung Fever (others say it was typhoid) in a dugout and was buried, at his request, on the homestead. It was on a hill facing north, just below is the Little Blue River, and just across the river was the Oregon Trail. There is a tombstone that reads: King David Fisher, born Feb. 19, 1819, died July 12, 1871, 52 years, 4 mos., 23 days.\"\n\nPhoto caption:\n\n\"This is the grave of King Fisher, on a hill near Hebron, Nebr. The child standing behind the tombstone is his great-grandson, King David Fisher II.\"\n\n\"King Fisher, For Whom City Is Named, is Buried On Hill Near Hebron, Nebr.\"\n\n\"King Fisher, frontiersman for whom Kingfisher creek, city and county (the only ones in the United States) were named, is buried near Hebron, Nebr. His children are all deceased, but a great-granddaughter, Mrs. Mabelle [sic] Fisher Clark, lives at North Platte, Nebr., and a granddaughter, Bertha A. Hartsock, 70, lives at Welch, Okla.\"\n\n\"Information concerning King Fisher has been supplied by these surviving relatives. He was born somewhere in the east in 1812 [sic], a member of a family of 13 or 14 children, and died in Nebraska in 1869 [sic].\"\n\n\"He met his wife, Sophia Pritchard, near Louisville, Ky., and they became the parents of seven sons and two daughters. One son, Isaac, was killed by Indians.\"\n\n\"Fisher, a horse trader and sometimes gambler, was also an Indian fighter when necessity demanded, although he was a friend to all civilized Indians. Long before the opening of the country to settlement, he traveled in Oklahoma, buying and selling cattle, and also had a line of stallions.\"\n\n\"One of his camping places was on the banks of what came to be known as Kingfisher creek, and when a stage station later was built there it likewise received the name of Kingfisher.\"\n\n\"An unusual circumstance occurred in connection with King Fisher's death. He foretold his passing two weeks before he died, although a physician summoned by his wife could find nothing wrong with him at that time.\"\n\n\"At his own request he was buried on a hill on his ranch where frontiersmen had used a telescope to watch for marauding Indians. His old musket hangs in the courthouse at North Platte, Nebr.\"\n\n\"The old log ranch house still stands and is the only original building left on the ranch.\"\n\nElizabeth (FISHER) MILLER (1821-<1868)\n\n1D.
