FISHER, MD, PhD\n\nhttp://www.massgeneral.org/mghdermatology/staff/fisher.htm\n\nCutaneous Biology Research Center\n\nBuilding 149, 13th Street\n\nCharlestown, MA 02129\n\nphone: (617) 643-5428\n\nfax: (617) 726-4189\n\nAbout David E. Fisher\n\nDavid E. Fisher is a researcher, clinician and academic, and serves as Chief of the MGH Department of Dermatology, Director of the MGH Cutaneous Biology Research Center and Director of the Melanoma Center at MGH. He is also the President of the Society for Melanoma Research, the largest international society dedicated to the study of melanoma. A professor of Pediatrics at Harvard Medical School, Fisher came to the MGH from the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI), where he directed the Melanoma Program.\n\nHis research has focused on the molecular mechanisms of melanocyte biology; specifically, the developmental, signaling and transcriptional pathways responsible for human melanomas, hyperpigmentation, albinism and hair graying. Most recently, his work at the DFCI identified the transcription factor, Mitf, as essential for the development of normal melanocytes as well as responsible for cancerous transformations. As a clinician, he has worked to translate these new understandings into advances in diagnosis, treatment and prevention of human diseases related to the skin and associated disorders.\n\nA graduate of Swarthmore College with a degree in Biology and Chemistry, Fisher is also a concert cellist and received a degree from the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia. After completing a doctoral degree at Rockefeller University, he began his medical training at Cornell University Medical College and his residency in Internal Medicine at the MGH. Following the completion of clinical fellowships in both adult and pediatric oncology at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Children's Hospital Boston and his postdoctoral research at MIT's Center for Cancer Research, Fisher joined the DFCI staff.\n\nResearch\n\nThe Fisher Lab studies cell death and proliferation signals in relation to development and disease, particularly cancer. We attempt to understand critical modes of cell homeostasis with a goal of molecular targeted therapy for human disease.\n\np53, Apoptosis, and Cancer Therapy p53 mutations are the most common genetic aberrancy in human cancer and confer tumor cell resistance to apoptosis by many drugs. We study apoptosis in p53 wild type or deficient tumor cells containing defined oncogenes. In addition we have constructed a cell-free apoptosis assay which recapitulates p53's regulatory role, allowing for molecular dissection and direct biochemical purification of death mediators. These studies have identified key intermediates and several negative modulators of p53-dependent apoptosis which may be targets for cancer drug design.\n\nControl of life and death in melanoma Malignant transformation of melanocytes produces one of the most treatment resistant malignancies in man. We have identified a transcriptional network which regulates melanoma cell survival and proliferation as well as melanocyte differentiation during development. Using diverse methods including mouse models, human tumor expression arrays, and cellular assays, we examine mechanisms through which melanoma cells evade death, with the goal of improving therapy. These studies also include examination of the role of UV in melanocyte biology and carcinogenesis.\n\nMitf transcription factor family in development & cancer Mitf is a helix-loop-helix factor homologous to Myc, whose mutation produces absence of melanocytes and severe abnormalities in osteoclasts, the cells responsible for bone mineral resorption. Mitf mutations occur in humans with Waardenburg Syndrome, a condition involving pigmentation and deafness,. Mitf acts as a master regulator of melanocyte and osteoclast development and is targeted by several critical signaling pathways. Recently, members of the Mitf family have been discovered as oncogenes in a variety of human malignancies. Their roles in cancer as well as means of targeting them for therapeutic benefit are under active investigation.\n\nThe Cutaneous Biology Research Center can be found at: http://www.massgeneral.org/cbrc/pages/cbrc_cores.htm.\n\nLab Members\n\nSuprabha Devi Technologist\n\nGillian Fell Graduate Student\n\nBrian Fiske Technician\n\nAdam Friedman Graduate Student\n\nPeter Gordon Research Fellow\n\nRizwan Haq Research Fellow\n\nVivien Igras Research Supervisor\n\nAkinori Kawakami Research Fellow\n\nMehdi Khaled Research Fellow\n\nCarmit Levy Research Fellow\n\nJuying Li Research Fellow\n\nJue Judy Liu Graduate Student\n\nEiichi Makino Research Fellow\n\nDevarati Mitra Graduate Student\n\nKelly Oâ€™Hanlon Administrative Assistant\n\nKatey Robinson Graduate Student\n\nNunciada Salma Research Fellow\n\nThanh-Nga Tran Research Fellow\n\nRosa Veguilla Graduate Student\n\nSatoru Yokoyama Research Fellow\n\nXiansi Zhao Research Fellow"
