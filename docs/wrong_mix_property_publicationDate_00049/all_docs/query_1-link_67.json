        "text": "One of the enduring memories of my film-going exploits in the early 1982 was of the first time I saw Ridley Scott’s Blade Runner in September 1982. I’d been mesmerised by Scott’s audacious visuals, blown away by the sheer texture of the films art direction and special effects and had happily bought into the film’s many philosophical concerns. It seemed at the time that in the wake of the global success of the soap opera of Star Wars (1977), science fiction cinema was back on track and had produced something that could stand alongside Stanley Kubrick‘s 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) as the best the genre had to offer. Having only recently read the Philip K. Dick novel on which it was based, 1968’s Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, I was mildly disappointed that it hadn’t actually adapted the book but it had kept enough of Dick’s original story while creating something wholly new and fascinating to leave me stunned by what Scott and his team had achieved.\n\nBut on the way out of the cinema that evening, Vangelis’ sequencer-driven end titles theme still ringing in my ears, it quickly became clear that the young couple who had sat in the row in front of me were less impressed. They were confused by the plot, concerned that star Harrison Ford – then at the peak of his popularity thanks to Star Wars and Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981) – was “a bit of a wimp” and most damningly in their eyes they couldn’t work out where all the spaceships were. Star Wars had become the new norm for screen science fiction and although genre nerds like myself were loving Blade Runner, the general public were baffled by it, echoing many of the concerns voiced by that couple in an Isle of Wight cinema that early autumn evening.\n\nDespite claims to the contrary, Blade Runner wasn’t a massive box office flop but given the vast sums of money poured into its production by producers The Ladd Company, it didn’t do well enough. In modern parlance it “under-performed.” Critical reaction was mixed – some writers fell for the film’s charms immediately, most were more resistant, citing the films lack of pace, supposedly difficult storyline and lack of characterisation as its chief flaws.\n\nAnd yet the film endured. Almost as soon as it was run through the first projector, academics were poring over its themes, teasing out nuances and meanings that had eluded many on their first viewing. Home video releases, though severely compromising Scott’s vision, gave the film a new lease of life and it started to pick up a sizeable cult following. Younger critics began re-evaluating the film and a new generation of film-makers were inspired by it. Soon you couldn’t move for films that attempted (and mostly failed) to emulate “that Blade Runner look.” It was on its way to becoming a classic and although you can still find plenty who remain resistant to its charms, today Blade Runner is generally seen as a milestone in science fiction cinema, an extraordinary, singular and hugely influential piece of work.\n\nAs already noted the screenplay – written by Hampton Fancher and reworked by David Peoples – abandons much of Dick’s novel. Even the title comes from somewhere else, from Alan E. Nourse’s 1974 medical science fiction thriller The Bladerunner which had been adapted into a never-filmed treatment by William S. Burroughs under the title Blade Runner (A Movie). Burroughs would publish his treatment as a novella in 1979 under the same title. But it retained enough of the essence of Dick’s novel to impress the author. Dick had publicly criticised Fancher’s early scripts in a piece written for the Los Angeles based Select TV Guide but when he was sent People’s rewrite and was invited to view a twenty minute special effects test reel he was more enthused. “I recognized it immediately,” he told John Boonstra in an interview for Rod Serling’s Twilight Zone Magazine published in June 1982. “It was my own interior world. They caught it perfectly.” Sadly by the time the interview was published, Dick was already dead, having succumbed to the effects of a stroke on 2 March 1982 at the age of just 53. He never lived to see the release of the first big screen adaptation of his work, though his 1953 short story Imposter had already been adapted twice for television, first by the British series Out of This World (1962) and again in 1981 for the Italian series Il fascino dell’insolito (1980-1982).\n\nThe plot follows the investigation of Rick Deckard (Ford), a former special police officer known as a Blade Runner who, in November 2019, finds himself recruited once again to help track down and “retire” a group of replicants, genetically engineered humanoids created for military service or off-world servitude who have escaped and arrived illegally on Earth looking for a way to avoid the four year lifespan afforded replicants. As he tracks down and “retires” each of the group, Deckard meets and falls in love with Rachael (Sean Young), a Nexus 6 replicant created by Eldon Tyrell (Joe Turkel) whose corporation is the largest manufacturer of replicants. After killing Zhora (Joanna Cassidy), a former member of a “kick murder squad” masquerading as a dancer in a bar, and Pris (Darryl Hannah), a “basic pleasure model” (Leon (Brion James) is killed by Rachael when he tries to attack Deckard) he tracks down the group’s leader, the physically and mentally superior Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer) who is reaching the end of his lifespan and has nothing left to lose.\n\nFrom the very opening shot, a vast hellish nocturnal cityscape, the camera moving towards the huge Tyrell pyramid, intercut with close ups of an eye (subliminally perhaps suggesting the eye in the pyramid, the Eye of Providence, the all-seeing eye of God) Blade Runner is visually breathtaking. Never had a science fiction film created a world so immersive, as “lived-in” as the nightmarish Los Angeles of the near future, a city constantly in the dark, constantly lashed by pouring rain where the street-level poor are looked down upon by the wealthy from their towering skyscrapers. Huge advertising hoardings boom out messages 24/7, low-flying ships extol the virtues of off-world living, the streets teem with people who all give the impression of having lives beyond the frame of the film and the skies are full of “skimmers”, flying police cars.\n\nScott has said that the effect he was after was of “Hong Kong on a very bad day” and the look and feel of the city is very much an extension of the kind of detail – beautifully realised here by cinematographer Jordan Cronenweth, production designer Lawrence G. Paull, art director David Snyder, concept artist Syd Mead and the effect teams supervised by Douglas Trumbull – that Scott had afforded his previous film, Alien (1979). The bland, soulless futurescapes of most previous films set a few years ahead were brushed aside by Scott’s vision of a grimy, but functioning, future city, a sprawling urban nightmare as far removed from the glittering towers of Metropolis (1927) or the sterile world of Logan’s Run (1976) as it was possible to imagine. Thanks to the convergence of these design disciplines, Blade Runner has a visual depth that modern CGI spectaculars simply can’t match.\n\nIt’s largely the look of the film that gets remarked upon the most even today – and with good reason – but Blade Runner is far more than just a visual treat, a high tech updating of the classic film noir look . It’s a film that can be viewed and read on many different levels – as a simple police procedural; as a meditation on the ethics of bio-engineering living creatures that will eventually grow to develop emotions every bit as real as our own; it casts a jaundiced eye over the growth of unchecked corporate power; it touches on issues of race (Deckard’s boss, Bryant (E. Emmet Walsh) disparagingly refers to the replicants as “skin jobs” and clearly regards them as inferiors and in the much derided voice over in the original cut Deckard explicitly links the term to the racial epithets hurled at America’s black population); it reflects early 80s American fears that the Japanese were becoming their economic rivals and that there was no way for America to keep up; and perhaps most crucially, it explores that favourite Philip K. Dick obsession – what is it that make us human, sets us apart from the animal or the replicant and can we always be sure of who or what we actually are?\n\nThe latter formed the basis of one of the film’s most enduring mysteries. Is Deckard himself a replicant? Ford and producer Michael Deeley have always argued that he isn’t, Fancher wanted his true nature to remain ambiguous and Scott was clear that he believed that he was. The evidence seems to support Scott. In the film, the eyes of the artificial beings, the replicants and the bio-engineered owl seen in Tyrell’s office, reflect the light in a particular way, giving them a distinctive copper glow. Deckard’s eyes are seen to behave in the same way in several shots. In the Director’s Cut and Final Cut versions, Deckard briefly daydreams about a unicorn running through a forest. At the end of the film, after fellow Blade Runner Gaff (Edward James Olmos) has obliquely threatened Rachael’s life (“It’s too bad she won’t live. But then again who does?”) Deckard retrieves her from his apartment and on the way out finds an origami unicorn left by Gaff and Deckard nods knowingly. How could Gaff have known that Deckard dreamed of non-electric unicorns unless he was privy to an implanted memory of the kind we know Rachael has? Is Deckard’s nod a recognition that Gaff had been to the apartment and spared Rachel, or a final understanding that he’s not human at all?\n\nIn the original theatrical cut of the film a continuity blunder fuelled the flames of speculation. Bryant tells Deckard that six “skin jobs” arrived on Earth and that one was killed while trying to infiltrate the Tyrell Corporation. This should leave five more replicants on the loose but we only ever see four – Roy, Pris, Zohra and Leon. Some fans have speculated that the missing replicant was Deckard, captured and reprogrammed to believe that he was a human police officer and sent out to track down the others. It’s a nice theory but the truth is far more mundane. There was meant to be a sixth replicant, Mary, to have been played by Stacey Nelkin and seen in an opening sequence showing the replicants’ escape, but the character was cut early in production when the scenes was scrapped – but only after Bryant’s dialogue reference had been filmed. Scott rearranged the script to suggest that Rachel was the missing fifth replicant but in subsequent cuts dialogue replacement corrects Bryant’s “mistake.”\n\nIntriguingly, the blu-ray release of the film featured another “version” of the film (there have been many…) made up of outtakes and alternative cuts, one of which features Deckard and Rachel talking in his spinner as they drive through the countryside at the very end of the film and during which she speculates that Deckard may not be human. The sequel, Blade Runner 2049 (2017), would seem to suggest that Deckard is in fact human after all – or a form of Nexus we haven’t seen before – as he’s still very much alive thirty years later and we’re told repeatedly in Blade Runner that the Nexus 6 comes with a four year lifespan.\n\nHarrison Ford took on the role of Deckard as he was intrigued by the story and was looking for a meatier role after the comparatively lightweight Han Solo and Indiana Jones. Despite it now being one of his most iconic roles, Ford wasn’t the first choice for the part. When writing the script, Hampton Fancher had envisioned Robert Mitchum in the role and in one of those extraordinary “what if” moments, Dustin Hoffman was briefly attached to the project before departing citing differences with Scott over the film’s vision. It’s impossible to imagine Hoffman – or anyone else – in the role now. Many find Ford’s performance too dour but it’s perfectly suited to the film noir tone of the film and his down-at-heel, world weary Deckard fits into the nightmarish world he inhabits perfectly. His low energy performance reelects the ennui of those living in the appalling Stygian depths of the city.\n\nAll of the performances are good though the show is comprehensively stolen by the brilliant Hauer whose turn as Roy batty is electrifying and he was rarely this compelling again. Famously he re-wrote the film’s most oft-quoted dialogue (“I’ve seen things you people wouldn’t believe…”) in so doing helping to create one of science fiction’s most eloquent and moving monologues. His portrayal of Batty as a violent but ultimately compassionate man – not a machine or an artificial being but as a passionate human being – contrasts brilliantly with Ford’s more depressed and buttoned-down reading of Deckard. In the original voice over (abandoned in subsequent versions of the film), Deckard delivers a touching eulogy for his nemesis after he’s saved his life just as his own four year lifespan runs out: “I don’t know why he saved my life. Maybe in those last moments he loved life more than he ever had before. Not just his life, anybody’s life – my life. All he’d wanted was the same answers the rest of us want. Where do I come from? Where am I going? How long have I got? All I could do is sit there and watch him die.” The replicants all seem so much more full of energy than the humans simply because they’re desperate to cling to what precious little is left of their dwindling and artificially restricted lives. “More human than human” is the motto of the Tyrell Corporation and it’s clear that they had no idea exactly what that meant – that their artificial offspring were probably better than us in ways that they could never have imagined.\n\nBlade Runner is beautiful to look at, possessed of a complex narrative that can read in so many different ways and blessed with some fantastic performances. And then there’s the music… It was composed and performed largely by Greek electronic music legend Vangelis (he’s joined by British saxophonist and frequent collaborator Dick Morrissey on the haunting Love Theme) who deployed a huge array of then state-of-the-art synthesizers, including the formidable Yamaha CS-80 (in an interview with Electronic & Music Maker in November 1984, Vangelis described it as “the most important synthesizer in my career – and for me the best analogue synthesizer design there has ever been”) and the still new Emulator sampler. The result is a beautiful, often deeply moving score as richly layered as the visuals and just as influential.\n\nThe entire soundscape is extraordinary in fact, not just the music – the advertising jingles (including an extract from Nipponia’s recording of Ogi no Mato) rub sonic shoulders with a burst of Harps of the Ancient Temples by harpist Gail Laughton, while If I Didn’t Care, a 1939 recording by The Ink Spots sits alongside strange, almost animal-like sounds created by Vangelis. Bud Alper’s sound effects complete the soundscape, adding immeasurably to the immersive quality of the film.\n\nBlade Runner is chock full of little details and textural flourishes that aren’t always obvious on first viewing but which demonstrate just how much detail and attention Scott brought to the film. When Deckard looks at a photograph of Rachael, supposedly as a child but actually part of her implanted memories, a shadow passes over it and we hear he sound of children laughing, giving the eerie impression that the still image has briefly burst into life. Elsewhere, after being beaten by Leon, Deckard takes a sip from his drink and a tiny sliver of blood from his injured mouth seeps into the glass. Fans of the novel will appreciate little tips of the hat like the artificial animals (in the book, World War Terminus has wiped out most of the species on Earth leaving the survivors to tend to robot pets) like Tyrrell’s owl or Zohra’s snake. Particularly appreciated are the questions asked by Blade Runner Dave Holden (Morgan Paull) of Leon that mention a turtle in the desert, a reference to the closing paragraphs of the book.\n\nOn the other hand we may lament some of the things that didn’t make the transition. Mercerism, the strange virtual religion that uses technology to link adherents to the endless struggles of Wilbur Mercer and his constant, Sisyphus-like struggle to climb a hill while being bombarded with rocks was always going to be a tough act to visualise so Fancher and Peoples’ decision to jettison it is understandable. But the moment in which Deckard is arrested while investigating an opera singing android (the artificial beings are never referred to as replicants in the book) and taken to a police station that appears to be run entirely by androids is one of the most paranoid moments in Dick’s particularly paranoid oeuvre and it’s shame no room could be found for it.\n\nThe police station scene finds Deckard musing for the first time on what it is that makes us human and questioning the ethics of what he does for a living. It would have fitted perfectly in a film that worries about the same things. It was also one of the concerns of the literary science fiction movement dubbed cyberpunk, which frequently pondered the issues of how extensive body modifications using technology might affect us. In many respects Blade Runner now looks like an early outrider of the cyberpunk movement. William Gibson, whose 1984 novel Neuromancer was the standard bearer of the movement, told Paris Review magazine that “I was afraid to watch Blade Runner in the theater because I was afraid the movie would be better than what I myself had been able to imagine. In a way, I was right to be afraid, because even the first few minutes were better. Later, I noticed that it was a total box-office flop, in first theatrical release. That worried me, too. I thought, Uh-oh. He got it right and ­nobody cares!”\n\nGibson went on to note that “Over a few years […] I started to see that in some weird way it was the most influential film of my lifetime, up to that point. It affected the way people dressed, it affected the way people decorated nightclubs. Architects started building office buildings that you could tell they had seen in Blade Runner. It had had an astonishingly broad aesthetic impact on the world.” And it continues to exert both influence and an enduring fascination to this day. It’s not a perfect film – in any of the many versions released over the years there are still things that don’t really add up – but although much misunderstood at the time was the finest science fiction film since Kurick’s 2001. Today it is rightly regarded as a flawed masterpiece, its influence undeniable, its ability to charm and beguile still evident after all these years.\n\nIn 2017, Denis Villeneuve directed the long talked about sequel, Blade Runner 2049. Fans had every right to be concerned. How could it possibly hope to match up to the original, in terms of look, influence and intellect? We shouldn’t have worried. Villeneuve and his producers (including Ridley Scott) had the good sense to retain Hampton Fancher, teaming him with co-writer Michael Green and their solution was to take off in a different direction, complementing the themes of the first film without ever trying to slavishly replicate the look. It turned out to be a more than worthy sequel."
