For me, the movie, Blade Runner is a shoot 'em up adventure, man vs cunning machines with a highly distracting background where the machines can blend into the background scenery. I don't remember how much rain there was in the movie but it seemed to give the whole picture a glossy look, but also allowing everything to flow together towards a single goal.

It seemed like it was set in a large flat dusty city where the various components were having a hard time staying in view as each character, including androids, negotiated their way through the story. The story view was level with the characters, I wasn't seeing past the characters' view of their surroundings. No spectacular overhead views. The reader was exposed to the character's confusion. Not a lot of difference between the people and the androids problems. No one was having an easy time.

He wrote a lot of emotional content into his characters and some of that came from his efforts to write serious drama about life in ordinary times. None of which was published until after he died.

DADOES is more of a longish short story than a book. Also, judging from the few PKD short stories I have read, he was not much on background and imagery. The basic story of the movie is right there in the story but Ridley Scott had to create a lot of \"wallpaper\" to give the movie its look, imagery that was not in the short story. Quite frankly I think he got it right. I believe PKD saw an early edited version of Blade Runner before he died and he thought he got it right too.\n\nCharlie\n\nSeems books are never made into movies. The movie can complement the book or use it as a launching pad, but never seems to mimic it. I guess books just have too much data in them even though a picture can represent a thousand words. The written word can easily show the story behind the story, but a movie seems to be stuck just telling the story. Written or spoken stories trickle into the mind one word at a time, building a foundation of expanding thoughts. The reader fills in their own gaps. Movies come in on multiple fronts all at once, without a foundation, they cruise through the mind as a prepackaged event. Ideas from books are included in the movie, and dialog and actions can be spoken and done by other characters, and sometimes all that survives is the title. The books are used as advance advertising, lending their popularity to a project that is not going to show the book as it was written and might need all the recognition it can get. From an economic view, the movie industry firmly believes the screen view needs to be pumped up with electrifying movie practices. EMPs to keep the audience's attention from wandering. Thus Do Androids Dream Of Electric Sheep changes from a search of individual identity with a dreary background to an thrill packed hunt of escaped criminals against a glossy background.\n\nFor sci-fi/fantasy, I have trouble remembering a book which was faithfully adapted as a movie besides LOTR, which I hold as probably 'as close as it is possible to get in a big-budget film'.\n\nPerhaps the mystery genre is in general an easier topic to adapt - Agatha Christie's mysteries were adapted, often very close to the originals (and often with some things removed/added).\n\nA mystery is a mystery, someone dies, someone searches for someone, and usually the guilty party is brought to justice, one way or another. Political thrillers could be more likely to roil the waters of the status quo, depending on how close to the world they present their picture of what went wrong and how it was or wasn't fixed. I don't think mysteries can change the world as much as science fiction has. Science fiction can literally be anything, so changing the layout of the story can change the whole set of ideas the author was working on.\n\nIronically a story is likely to have a greater readership if large numbers of people reading the same story are coming to different conclusions of their understanding of what the story was about and what the story was trying to say.\n\nI agree the mystery stories are easier to adapt than a lot of science fiction. I just read The Thin Man by Dashiell Hammett. The movie and the book are both good, just two different kinds of stories with the same characters and settings and still managed to end up in the same place. The book was very gritty and the movie was happy go lucky. Agatha Christie stories might be closely followed because the stories are good to start with. Keeping the story intact is paying respect to Agatha Christie and it's probably easier to make a success out of a clearly known success. However, I love the way that Margaret Rutledge re-interpreted Miss Marple, there will probably never be another like her, or the character she created.\n\nFrom the Verge Article by Adi Robertson:\n\nNourse hasn’t written a literary masterwork; the characters aren’t deep or interesting enough, and the conflict wraps up too easily. Still, it’s an engaging story that feels dated yet not quaint, and unlike a lot of little-known mid-century fiction, it’s easily accessible as an ebook.\n\nThe Bladerunner\n\nAlan E NourseApril 12, 2013\n\nSold by Simon and Schuster\n\nBladerunner seems to have an effect on some people, perhaps that's all that's needed.\n\nI don't need a literary masterpiece. I don't need steamer trunks packed with emotional baggage. The conflict wraps up too easily? Wow, that's just too bad. And the dated business, does that mean writers are supposed to be able to accurately predict future events or is the comment about language, where we pretend in everyday life everyone is giving everyone the respect they deserve. Character development is a go to checklist item that is needed for the benefit of humanity to be able to say \"In my imagination, or at least the book I'm reading, I'm becoming a better person by living out my emotional bottlenecks that prevents me from being all that I can be.\" The fact that Charles Dicken's is still popular, his messages are still relevant, probably has to do with the concept of acknowledging a situation while reading about it but still failing to learn to act by reading about it. Books are quite good as sedatives, and sometimes the more entertaining, the less likely anything is going to change. Books have been changing history, but it appears to be more in a horizontal direction, expanding consciousness but not elevating the global infrastructure. The improvements always seem to come with a price. What was Alan Nourse witnessing in the medical world he was clearly a part of that prompted him to write Bladerunner. Surely a bed of roses wouldn't have prompted a response such as the one he wrote. It could be chalked up to pure imagination, just a bit of fun. Maybe he didn't appreciate pay to play medicine. Maybe he din't care. Burroughs could pick up the least obvious harmonic vibrations in life and make a symphony out of them, so maybe something in the book spooked him. There is plenty of medicine going around but not everyone gets what they need. Is sculpting genes an improvement or a step towards creating the standard model citizen that people will be molded into at birth. Is the next Einstein sickly, lying in a ditch, dying from lack of medical attention? The fact that the line between medicine that is needed and medicine that goes along with a vanity license plate are becoming indistinguishable from each other might have been evident to Mr. Nourse all those years ago.\n\nI read the novel with an old tie-in cover before I got around to seeing the movie. Every book and movie adaptation are separate entities, though some vary from each other more than others. But it's two different mediums with different formats. Movies have elements that written fiction do not, the visual and auditory performance, but also a lot of limitations, particularly with regards to length. Written fiction is produced by one, sometimes two authors, while movies are produced by the creative imput of dozens of people, including usually more than one writer. So expecting movies to be exact replications isn't realistic. They are different kinds of story-telling. And the movie had Rutger Hauer.\n\nDick's written works played with interesting philosophical and ethical issues, which make good premises for movies, but story structure isn't cinematic. The cultural details like Mercerism, the satiric nature of some of the social commentary that is more in line with Brave New World, the mysticism and chemical enhancement aspects, etc. and a lot of his endings don't make for an easy movie adaptation. So movie adaptations for Dick's stuff tend to keep the philosophical issue, keep the sense of dystopia and paranoia surrounding technology, and then adapt it into more streamlined and straightforward thriller plots, in Bladerunner's case with a neo-noir style -- rain, darkness, crowded city streets, strippers, etc., that is with SF, the cyberpunk aesthetic. But they kept the main premise and it comes down to the main set-up -- a bounty hunter who takes out androids but develops empathy for them, the Other. Basically, the androids are, as often the case in English language SF, stand-ins for non-whites, and both the movie and the book use that emphasis.\n\nThe impact of the movie has not been its plot, though, but its cinematic style, which combines the beloved of critics noir of movie thrillers with science fiction tech elements. The film's use of imagery, lighting, set design, etc. all had an impact. And though the movie didn't do well out of the gate, it did make Hollywood folk very interested in Dick's work, so he's definitely become the favorite SF author of the film world. Some of that impact is still around, but some of it has faded. When I had my daughter watch it when she was younger, she gave up on it before the end, so we fast forwarded so she could see Hauer's speech. The movie was too slow and the lighting too dark for her. She was used to a very different aesthetic, pacing and editing. Bladerunner is very much a 1980's film.\n\nIs that how it works, the book comes out, has some popularity, the movie comes out and really boosts the book sales? Did the Harry Potter movies boost book sales of the book the movie was based on or had the book already peaked and the movie was the next revenue boost in the Harry Potter series before the next book came out?\n\nBooks and stories that are adapted aren't one hundred percent always popular before adaptation, though usually they are. (The ones used for anthology t.v. series often aren't.) The movies that adapt popular books tend to do better in sales than ones that have original scripts on average. And a movie adaptation of a book always boosts the book's sales, even if the movie doesn't do that well, because the movie then becomes the ultimate word of mouth for the book, especially if they do a tie-in cover edition of the book. A successful movie can put a book back on the bestseller list for quite awhile, because a lot of people like to read the source material, even if it is different from the movie (or t.v. show.)\n\nIn the case of Harry Potter, the book series became a phenom seller before the movies came out and were topping the list of phenom sellers. When the movies came out, they boosted the sales of the books further so that Rowling became the biggest phenom selling author of all time. Further, the merchandising off the movies and the establishment of amusement parks for Harry Potter continue to keep sales going on of the books, which is combined with the fact that popular children's/YA sellers tend to stay in print for very long periods, decades and decades, since they can be reintroduced to each new generation of kids and have long term places in school libraries.\n\nWhat the Harry Potter movies also did was help the Harry Potter book series grow the YA section of bookstores to ten times their size, bringing in lots of new readers who browsed outward from Harry Potter, and opening up opportunities for lots of authors, some of whom also became bestsellers and had movie or t.v. adaptations. Fiction is a symbiotic market and adaptations help with symbiosis and word of mouth. The movies remind people that fiction writing exists and might be worth checking out. Bladerunner continues to bring in readers not simply to Dick's works but to science fiction in general, as do the movies Total Recall, The Minority Report, The Man in High Castle t.v. show, etc. The Expanse brings in new readers to SF, Star Wars brings in new readers through tie-in novels and comics, Game of Thrones, Brave New World, I Am Legend, The Martian, etc."
