(From SB Nation Atlanta - Kris Willis) It took a few days longer than was originally thought but Kyle Korver has landed in Atlanta via trade with the Chicago Bulls for cash considerations according to an official press release by the team and general manager Danny Ferry.

"I appreciate the toughness and the competitive energy Kyle brings to the game every night, and we're very excited to add him to our team." said Ferry. "Adding him makes shooting an even greater strength for our club."

Korver averaged 8.1 points per game last season while playing 65 games with the Bulls. He hit on .435 percent of his three point attempts and adds yet another shooter to the Atlanta roster. The Hawks already acquired Anthony Morrow from New Jersey and drafted sharpshooter John Jenkins in the 2012 NBA Draft.
