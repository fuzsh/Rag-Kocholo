Despite having until a deadline of July 10th on whether or not they would pick up his option and keep him on the roster, the Chicago Bulls instead informed Kyle Korver that a decision would be made on his status by this coming Sunday.

What seemed strange initially makes more sense now as the Bulls are looking to trade Korver, possibly to the Minnesota Timberwolves in a sign-and-trade agreement. The Atlanta Hawks were another team looking to acquire Korver as well.

In his two seasons with the Bulls, Korver has proved to be a solid role player off the bench, improving drastically in his second year in Chicago as opposed to his first.

Last season Korver averaged 8.1 points on 43 percent shooting from the field and from behind the three-point line in almost 23 minutes of playing time off the bench. He appeared in 65 of 66 regular season games and started seven of them.
