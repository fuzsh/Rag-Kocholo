The active Atlanta Hawks improved their long-distance shooting Monday, acquiring small forward Kyle Korver from the Chicago Bulls for a trade exception and cash.

The 6-foot-7 Korver averaged 8.1 points for the Bulls in 65 games last season, including seven starts. He ranked 10th in the NBA by making 43.5 per cent of his 3-point attempts.

First-year Hawks general manager Danny Ferry has been busy since taking over a few days before last month's NBA draft.

He traded two longtime starters, All-Star guard Joe Johnson and forward Marvin Williams. Those deals brought in guards Devin Harris, Anthony Morrow, Jordan Farmar and DeShawn Stevenson, and forwards Jordan Williams and Johan Petro. The Hawks also signed guard Lou Williams.

Korver gives Ferry and coach Larry Drew an experienced shooter who can help replace Johnson and Williams.

"I appreciate the toughness and the competitive energy Kyle brings to the game every night, and we're very excited to add him to our team," Ferry said. "Adding him makes shooting an even greater strength for our club."

The 31-year-old Korver has made at least 40 per cent of his 3-point shots in six of his nine seasons with Philadelphia, Utah and Chicago. He set a league record by making 53.6 per cent of his 3-point shots in the 2009-10 season with the Jazz.

Ferry's first draft pick for Atlanta last month was another strong 3-point shooter, guard John Jenkins of Vanderbilt. Jenkins was regarded as one of the top shooters in the draft.

The team requested waivers on Farmar on Monday.
