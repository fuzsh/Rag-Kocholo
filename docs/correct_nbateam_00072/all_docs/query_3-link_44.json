        "text": "“I was done,” Korver said Monday afternoon at Media Day. “I was just done. I took a good chunk of time and kind of got away from the game and really evaluated a lot of things and tried to decide if I still had the desire to play. Talking to my wife, my family, look at my kids, you know, we didn’t really talk it through anything yet, but just tried to get a good feel for where they’re at in life and after doing all that, I wanted to come back and I still wanted to play, still love the game and so I’m excited to be back.”\n\nAfter some heart-to-heart chats with his family, Korver determined he was ready to come back, ready to take on this new challenge. “I think really I needed to have the blessing of my wife and family,” Korver said. “You guys hear this too, surely, you’re schedules are tough as well and the older I get, there’s a family cost to continuing to play. It’s a real thing. So once I felt like my family was in a spot where, even though we went through what we went through, we’re good, we can keep going, that gave me the freedom to really decide for myself if I still love the game or not, if I wanted to put the work in. I don’t want to just come here and just be around. I want to come here and work, play well, make shots, win games. It’s a lot but once my family was good, shortly after that, I still have the desire.”\n\nIn 1999, Altman brought in a kid from Pella Iowa with a knack of shooting the long ball. “When I recruited Kyle we knew we had a good shooter,” said Altman. But Korver still felt he had something to prove. “None of the guys came here with a lot of fanfare,” said Korver. “We came with a chip on our shoulder and coach showed us how to use that.”\n\nThe summer league’s legacy lives on in LeBron. He remains arguably the greatest active player at age 33, a time when his peers are either slowing down (Carmelo Anthony, Dwyane Wade) or long since retired. The only other players still active in the 2017-18 season from the ‘03 summer league were Kyle Korver (who played for the Cavs last year), Udonis Haslem (14 games for the Heat last season), and ol’ Perk (one game for the Cavs), who has long since stopped crying on the bench."
