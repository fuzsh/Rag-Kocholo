        "text": "THE ART OF SHOOTING VIA KYLE KORVER\n\nEarlier I spoke of a great email newsletter resource I receive from Nova Southeastern assistant Brooklyn Kohlheim. Here is an example of something that I got from her that we will share with our team. It a great article on Kyle Korver written by Jeff Zillgitt for USA Today. It's an outstanding article (Coach Kohlheim told us in her newsletter \"If you don't read any other article here, you MUST read this.\") You can read the entire article here but here are a few excerpts we took from it:\n\nWhere does a basketball player find the perfect shot? In a gym? A high-tech sports science and medical lab? On a paddleboard on the ocean? In marriage? Mind? Body? In a system that accentuates three-point shooting?\n\nFor Atlanta Hawks guard Kyle Korver, the best three-pointer shooter in the NBA, it is all of those places and more.\n\nHe began searching for the perfect stroke.\n\n\"I started breaking down every single little detail of this simple stroke and tried to make it perfect. Get one perfect stroke and try to do it again. And just got lost in trying to perfect the stroke,\" he said. \"I focused on one detail and after 100 strokes, that didn't feel like a detail anymore. That felt natural.\n\n\"There was a smaller detail after that. I found a new detail and then a new detail and then a new detail. Eventually I was stroking, and eventually I wasn't that tired.\n\n\"That exercise of finding that stroke was revolutionary to me in shooting. You take the same concept of the stroke and do it with your shot.\"\n\nHe set a record last season for most consecutive games with a made three-pointer at 127 and is flourishing with the Hawks, a key reason why the Eastern Conference leaders were running on a 19-game winning streak and stand at 40-8 entering Monday's game against New Orleans.\n\nSan Antonio Spurs coach Gregg Popovich called Korver the best shooter in the league. He leads the league in three-point shooting percentage (53.7%) and is on pace to become the first player in NBA history to shoot at least 50% from the field, 50% on three-pointers and 90% on free throws.\n\nKorver loves shooting, and he loves talking shooting.\n\n\"To be a great shooter, to be a consistent shooter, which is what constitutes a great shooter — the goal is to make your shot exactly the same every single time,\" he said.\n\nHe has made three-pointers seem easier than they are. \"If you shoot it with all the leverage you have in your mechanics — using your legs and your technique — there's a way to make a three-point shot feel like it's not as far,\" he said.\n\nThis season is as close as Korver has felt to taking the same shot every time. \"This is the best I've ever shot, for sure,\" he said. \"There's a lot of reasons for it. As you get older, you should just become a better shooter. You've shot more shots.\"\n\nKorver has a 20-point checklist that helps him determine how sound his shot is. \"It's things I've identified that are keys to my shot,\" Korver said.\n\nWide stance.\n\nExaggerated legs.\n\nDrop through heels.\n\nEngage core.\n\nSlight bend at waist.\n\nUp strong.\n\nElbow straight.\n\nOne hand.\n\nFingers spread.\n\nSlight pause.\n\nElbow up.\n\nLand forward.\n\nSee the top of the rim.\n\nBall on fingertips.\n\nStrong shot.\n\nShoulders forward and relaxed.\n\nBall and arm risen straight.\n\nHold the follow through.\n\nKeep the release point high.\n\nOn turns, square shoulders.\n\n\"I'm not going to check every single one of them every time,\" Korver said. \"There's a certain point, a certain feel I'm trying to get to every day. Some things, you do more naturally. Some things, I have to think about them. As I'm shooting, I have this list in the back of my head, and I know I'm not doing one or two of them. Once I feel I get all 20 of them clicking, then I'm going to have natural rhythm in my shot.\"\n\nA lifetime of basketball and the pursuit of the perfect shot have made Korver one of the most accurate three-point shooters in NBA history. He's No. 6 on the all-time three-point shooting percentage list, and it's easy to imagine Korver shooting 1,000 shots a day. Not the case.\n\n\"I don't ever shoot a ton of shots at once because I want to shoot them game-like,\" Korver said. \"You can't shoot 500 shots at the exact speed and exact intensity that you're going to in a game.\n\n\"Very rarely will I shoot more than 150 shots at once.\"\n\nHe has four opportunities to feel good about his shot on gameday: during the morning shoot-around, after the morning shoot-around, during his pregame routine and during warmups just before tip-off.\n\n\"That helps me more than shooting a ton of shots at once and trying to find this rhythm that everyone talks about,\" Korver said. \"I want to seek perfection. Four times during that day, that's what I'm trying to do.\"\n\nHis high-energy pregame routine is worth watching and if you have a ticket to a Hawks game — home or away — you can watch it. He begins his routine about 50 minutes before game time with player development coaches passing, defending and setting screens.\n\nKorver takes shots from several spots on the court, including several spots around the three-point arc. The routine is tailored to the Hawks' offense, and Korver has to make a certain number of shots before he can move to the next spot.\n\nMost players won't leave the floor on a miss. Korver isn't most guys.\n\nHe can't leave the court without making 10 consecutive free throws and three consecutive three-pointers from the top of the arc. One miss and he starts over.\n\n\"Ten in a row, three in a row,\" Korver said. \"I've done that for a while. If I make all of my shots, I can have it done in less than 10 minutes — eight or nine minutes if I miss two, three, four shots.\"\n\nHOOPTHOUGHT NOTE: This is only a SMALL portion of this article -- well worth reading in it's entirety here."
