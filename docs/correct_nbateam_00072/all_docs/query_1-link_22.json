        "text": "The Chicago Bulls have traded three-point specialist Kyle Korver to the Atlanta Hawks. (Jesse D. Garrabrant/NBA/Getty Images)\n\nThe Chicago Bulls traded shooting guard Kyle Korver to the Atlanta Hawks on Friday and the deal will be complete pending a physical passed by Korver, according to the Chicago Tribune.\n\nAlso discussed in the deal is a possible sign-and trade-deal with guard Kirk Hinrich. The Hawks recently showed interest in Korver after receiving a traded player exception in the Joe Johnson deal to the Brooklyn Nets.\n\nKorver, 31, is a 10-year veteran who averaged eight points and two rebounds last season. He is one of the league's top three-point shooters, having shot 40 percent or better each of the past four seasons."
