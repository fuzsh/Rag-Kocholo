        "text": "Pella's Kyle Korver is first Iowa NBA all-star\n\nKyle Korver is the first Iowa high school graduate to be named to an NBA All-Star roster.\n\nKorver, who graduated from Pella in 1999, was named to the Eastern Division squad Tuesday in place of injured Heat guard Dwyane Wade. He will join Atlanta Hawks teammates Paul Millsap, Al Horford and Jeff Teague on the East.\n\nThe 33-year-old is the first former Iowa high school player to make one of the rosters since NBA All-Star history began in 1951. Cedar Rapids Washington's Bob Netolicky was a four-time all-star in the ABA.\n\nKorver, in his third season with the Hawks, is on pace to be just the second player in league history to make more than half of his shots from the floor and arc, while nailing better than 90 percent at the line. Current Golden State Warriors coach Steve Kerr did it in 1995-96 while playing for the Chicago Bulls.\n\nThe game will be played at 7:30 p.m. Iowa time Sunday in New York City."
