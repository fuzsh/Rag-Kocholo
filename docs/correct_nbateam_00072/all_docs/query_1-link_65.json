        "text": "According to a report by KC Johnson of the Chicago Tribune the Atlanta Hawks are close to obtaining Kyle Korver from the Chicago Bulls in exchange for what is probably a sign-and-trade deal for Kirk Hinrich.\n\nKorver averaged 8.1 points and 2.4 rebounds per game with Chicago last season while hitting 43 percent of his three-point attempts. He is a marksman and has over 1,100 makes from three-point range in his career. The Hawks have made shooting a priority this offseason and Korver fits that mold well. Korver joins new additions John Jenkins and Anthony Morrow as players that should help space the floor well for Atlanta."
