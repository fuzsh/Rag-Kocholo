        "text": "Kyle Korver is one of, if not the, best pure 3-point shooter in the NBA. That being said, the 11-year veteran has never been known as a dynamic player.\n\nHeading into the Hawks' Wednesday night contest against the Pacers, Korver had not successfully dunked in a game in three years. That changed on a second-quarter two-on-one fast break.\n\nMORE: 2015 Dunk Contest entrants | Will LeBron finally compete in Dunk Contest?\n\nThe one-handed slam was just the 16th of his career.\n\nThe Hawks entered Wednesday with the best record in the Eastern Conference at 34-8 and winners of 13 straight."
