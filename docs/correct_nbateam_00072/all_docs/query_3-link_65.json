        "text": "According to Yahoo!'s Adrian Wonjarowski, the field for this year's NBA 3-point contest is almost set.\n\nMonday, the insider reported Atlanta Hawks' guard Kyle Korver as well Golden State's Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson as well Portland's Wesley Matthews and the Clippers' JJ Redick.\n\nKorver, in his 12th season out of Creighton, is one of the reasons the Hawks are riding a league-best 16-game winning streak and is considered the best team in the league by some.\n\nThe 6-foot-7 shooting guard leads the league in 3-point percentage (53.1) and is on pace to be the first player in league history to shoot better than 50 percent from the field, 3-point range and 90 percent from the free-throw line.\n\nCurry, who bested LeBron James for most votes in being chosen an all-star game starter, is having an MVP caliber season. He's averaging 22.8 points and 8.2 assists per game. The Warriors have a league-best 36-6 record.\n\nThompson recently broke the NBA's single-quarter scoring record, dropping 37 in the third against Sacramento.\n\nRedick is ranked No. 6 in the league in 3-point shooting, draining 113 of his 256 attempts this season and Matthews is shooting just under 40 percent at 39.9 from deep.\n\nOne more player will be added to the competition set for February 14 at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn, N.Y."
