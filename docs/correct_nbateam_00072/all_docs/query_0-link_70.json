        "text": "CHICAGO -- Jose Calderon, George Hill, LeBron James, Jeff Green and Ante Zizic will start tonight for the short-handed Cavaliers against the Chicago Bulls, coach Tyronn Lue said.\n\nCalderon is taking the place of Kyle Korver, who is not with the team because of a family emergency. Larry Nance Jr., Cedi Osman, Rodney Hood, Kevin Love, and Tristan Thompson are all out with injuries.\n\nThis means Lue will use JR Smith, Jordan Clarkson, and John Holland off the bench, with London Perrantes as the ninth man and last available player.\n\nThe Cavs are 20-10 when Calderon plays at least 10 minutes, and 17-8 when he starts, this season.\n\nThe Bulls are shorthanded too. Lauri Markkanen, Zach LaVine, and Kris Dunn are all out tonight.\n\nLue had little to offer in terms which of the wounded will return, and when. He said he had no specific game targeted for Love's return next week -- Love previously told cleveland.com he hoped to return during the upcoming three-game homestand. Love's missed 20 games with a broken bone in his hand.\n\nNor did Lue have a timetable for Thompson to return from a sprained right ankle. The team said he'd be out two weeks when it happened. If so, he'd play Monday against Milwaukee.\n\nLue said Hood's lower back issue is a \"day to day\" thing and he said it wouldn't be smart for Nance to play right now with his right hamstring injury.\n\n\"He wanted to play but it wasn't a smart thing to do,\" Lue said. \"You saw the Phoenix game, every time he made a shot or an athletic play he always grabbed the back of his hamstring. So, when you have to do that, it's not smart to try to risk it. Especially when we're down guys already and we're trying to go to the playoffs healthy.\n\n\"If he does something that's serious to it he could be out six to eight weeks and that would hurt us.\"\n\nOsman is probably going to be out another week or so with his left hip flexor strain."
