        "text": "The Hawks improved their long-distance shooting Monday, acquiring small forward Kyle Korver from the Bulls for a trade exception and cash.\n\nThe 6-foot-7 Korver averaged 8.1 points for Chicago in 65 games last season, including seven starts. He ranked 10th in the NBA by making 43.5 percent of his 3-point attempts.\n\nFirst-year Hawks general manager Danny Ferry traded two longtime starters, All-Star guard Joe Johnson and forward Marvin Williams. Those deals brought in guards Devin Harris, Anthony Morrow, Jordan Farmar and DeShawn Stevenson, and forwards Jordan Williams and Johan Petro. The Hawks also signed guard Lou Williams.\n\nKorver gives Ferry and coach Larry Drew an experienced shooter who can help replace Johnson and Williams.\n\nThe 31-year-old Korver has made at least 40 percent of his 3-point shots in six of his nine seasons with Philadelphia, Utah and Chicago. He set a league record by making 53.6 percent of his 3-point shots in the 2009-10 season with the Jazz.\n\nThe team requested waivers on Farmar on Monday.\n\nKINGS-RAPTORS: Sacramento acquired forward James Johnson from Toronto in exchange for a second-round draft pick in 2014.\n\nJohnson is entering his fourth NBA season. He averaged 9.1 points, 4.7 rebounds and two assists while starting 40 games last season.\n\nJohnson was drafted 16th overall by the Bulls in 2009. He was traded to Toronto during his second season.\n\nNETS: The Brooklyn Nets signed veteran swingman Jerry Stackhouse to a one-year, $1.4 million deal, and forward Mirza Teletovic to a three-year, $9.8 million contract.\n\nStackhouse appeared in 30 games with the Hawks last season, averaging 3.6 points and 9.1 minutes. The 17-year NBA veteran did not appear in any of Atlanta’s six playoff games.\n\nTeletovic spent last season with Caja Laboral Vitoria of the Spanish ACB League. He averaged 16.3 points and 6.9 rebounds in 31.1 minutes.\n\nNO MATCH YET: The Knicks have still not matched Houston’s three-year, $25 million offer sheet for Jeremy Lin. Teams have three days to match the offer sheet for their restricted free agents, so the Rockets believe the clock expires at 11:59 EDT on Tuesday night."
