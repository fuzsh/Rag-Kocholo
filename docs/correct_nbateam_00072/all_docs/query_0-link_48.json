        "text": "When it rains, it pours.\n\nThe shorthanded Cleveland Cavaliers were dealt another blow, as they're taking on the Chicago Bulls on Saturday without Kyle Korver, who's away from the team due to personal reasons.\n\nThe veteran marksman had been starting at the two-spot, with Rodney Hood expected to claim it once he returns from a back injury. Hood's on the shelf alongside Kevin Love, Tristan Thompson, Larry Nance Jr., and Cedi Osman.\n\nKorver is averaging 9.4 points on 45.8 percent shooting from the field and 43.9 percent from long range to go along with 2.2 rebounds and 1.2 assists over 68 games. The one-time All-Star, who turned 37 today, is owed $7.5 million annually over the next two years.\n\nThe depleted Cavaliers are coming off a loss to the Portland Trail Blazers, and are 5-7 since the All-Star break. The club, which has made three consecutive Finals appearances, is barely holding onto the fourth seed in the Eastern Conference.\n\nTyronn Lue will trot out a starting lineup of Jose Calderon, Jeff Green, George Hill, LeBron James, and Ante Zizic."
