        "text": "Wizards Hawks Basketball\n\nAtlanta Hawks Kyle Korver (28) reacts to hitting a three pointer against the Wizards in the final minutes of a basketball game during the Eastern Conference Semifinals game 2 on Tuesday, May 5, 2015, in Atlanta. The Hawks beat the Wizards 106-90 to even the series 1-1. Curtis Compton(/Atlanta Journal-Constitution via AP)\n\n(Curtis Compton, AP)\n\nCLEVELAND, Ohio -- The Atlanta Hawks are a team without stars, but the name that most people know is Kyle Korver. The 13th-year pro holds NBA records for consecutive games with a 3-pointer (127) and highest 3-point percentage for a season (53.6 percent).\n\nBecause of that skill, the Hawks run a variety of set plays for Korver to get open from deep. All Korver needs is just a fraction of a second to catch and shoot, which makes him a very difficult player to defend.\n\nBelow we take a look at some of the ways this season that Korver was able to get open from 3-point range:\n\n1) The cut-and-screen\n\nLet's start with the not too distant past, as we go back to Game 1 of Atlanta's series with the Washington Wizards. It's a tie game in the third quarter, and the Hawks need a bucket, so they run a play for Korver.\n\nAs you see above, the play begins with Korver cutting into the paint and dragging his defender with him. You can notice that while this is taking place, Al Horford is behind him preparing to set a screen.\n\nKorver then cuts back to where he was, but when the defender turns around, he is now looking right at Horford. This gives Korver the amount of time he will need to catch and shoot the ball.\n\nThe play happens so fast that Marcin Gortat does not have enough time to recognize what is happening. He should have popped out to defend against the Korver shot, but instead Korver has an easy jumper that he makes.\n\n2) Hanging around the perimeter\n\nSometimes Korver doesn't have to do too much to get open. If we head back to the series with the Brooklyn Nets, we see an example of why it's so tough to defend him.\n\nHere we see Jeff Teague cut into the lane. Jarrett Jack comes off of Korver to play help defense. This is a huge mistake, as you can now see that Korver has no defender on him and is wide open for a shot.\n\nWith no one in Teague's passing lane to Korver, the result is about as easy a shot as the 3-point specialist will find. It's an example of why the defender cannot leave Korver open under any circumstances.\n\n3) Coming off screen for the shot\n\nThe Hawks have a variety of set plays for Korver, and here's one that they used against the New York Knicks in the regular season.\n\nKorver starts in the corner but runs to the top of the key. On his way, Korver gets a screen from Mike Scott that will prove to be enough to free up an open shot.\n\nYou'll see above that the screen delays the defender just enough for Korver to catch the ball without anyone guarding him. With the quick trigger he has, an uncontested catch means that he'll be able to shoot without trouble.\n\n4) Coming off screen against the Cavaliers\n\nThis play against the Cavaliers from the regular season isn't too different than the one against the Knicks. It shows that Atlanta can variate their plays for Korver enough to keep a defense honest.\n\nLike the last play, we see Korver start in the corner. This is his starting position for many plays. Right now he isn't even close to open, but that will change quickly.\n\nKorver gets a screen from Kent Bazemore, and it traps James Jones, who now has no chance to keep defending Korver. Meanwhile, Kyrie Irving has recognized what is going on, and now he will try to recover.\n\nAlthough, Irving does do a good job to get out against Korver, it's still not good enough. When Korver can catch the ball without any defense, he's already in position to shoot.\n\n5) Fake screen and pop out\n\nIn many instances, another Atlanta player is setting a screen for Korver to free him up. However, sometimes, it's Korver who sets a screen or pretends to set one in order to get open.\n\nAbove, Korver comes out of the corner to set a screen on Klay Thompson. At this point, Thompson is expecting the play to move towards him.\n\nInstead, Korver jumps away from Thompson out to the perimeter. Thompson has a delayed reaction because he was assuming there would be a screen play. This delay is enough time for Korver to catch the ball and take a wide open shot from deep."
