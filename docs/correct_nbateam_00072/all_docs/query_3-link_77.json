        "text": "The Cavs entered the season thinking they could compete for the 8-seed in the East with a re-signed Kevin Love and a combination of veterans and hungry young players.\n\nA dozen games into the season, they're 1-11, Love is hurt and they legitimately look like the worst team in an NBA filled with awful teams.\n\nKyle Korver is their most likely trade piece and the Sixers have already been connected to him. On their podcasts the last two weeks, both Woj and Brian Windhorst have brought up the connection and indicated that a trade would already be done if the Cavs were willing to accept two of the Sixers' second-round picks in the 2019 draft.\n\nThere will be a huge market for Korver's services - every team needs more shooting - so Cleveland is right to not jump on the first offer it gets. But it's hard to imagine any team offering a first-round pick, even if it's a late first. Korver is a great shooter but he's 37 years old.\n\nThat's where the Sixers' collection of second-round picks comes into play. They have three: their own and the ones belonging to the Kings and Bulls, two teams projected to pick toward the top of the second round. That's an advantage.\n\nThe only other NBA team with three second-round picks in next year's draft is the Hawks, who obviously won't be making a win-now trade.\n\nWhat makes Korver even more attractive to a shooting-needy team like the Sixers is that he's under contract next season as well. He's slated to make $7.5 million next season but only $3.44 million of that is guaranteed, meaning if he suffers a long-term injury, the Sixers can waive him before July 7, 2019 and pay only the $3.44M.\n\nThe Lakers have just as much of a need for Korver as the Sixers but seem unlikely to trade for him because they want a completely clean cap sheet next summer to chase stars.\n\nWe saw last season the impact Ersan Ilyasova and Marco Belinelli had on the Sixers' second unit, and we've seen this season that the Sixers' second unit needs a boost. They just don't have the same depth from a year ago.\n\nKorver is a better shooter than Ilyasova or Belinelli. He's shot 45% from three over the last nine seasons. Insane. Nearly a decade of elite, elite shooting from distance, and that's on nearly five attempts per game.\n\nIf JJ Redick and Korver were to share the court, the spacing would be terrific. The defense would suffer, but it would give the Sixers an offense-based lineup for when they're trailing by 10 points with six minutes to go.\n\nUnfortunately, the best, perhaps only course of action for the Sixers here is to wait out the Korver trade market. It doesn't make much sense to trade a first-round pick for him, and once the Cavs come to that ultimate realization, the domino could fall."
