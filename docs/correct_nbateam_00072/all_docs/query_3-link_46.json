        "text": "For generations of Pella's residents, the Korver family has brought compassion to those who are grieving.\n\nNow the community is supporting the Korvers as they mourn.\n\nKirk Korver, 27, died in Iowa City on Tuesday following a sudden illness. He was the youngest member of one of Iowa’s most prominent athletic families and the son of the senior pastor at Pella’s 3,000-member Third Reformed Church.\n\nWade Van Vark, one of Kirk’s Pella High School teachers and coaches, is among those who are now offering comfort to the family.\n\nSix years ago, Van Vark’s 16-year-old son, Blake, was killed in a car accident. When he started a fundraising drive to create a community baseball field named after his son, the Korvers were there to donate time and material contributions.\n\nVan Vark, his voice breaking with emotion, said he and others are giving back.\n\n\"In the community, it's our turn, our time to play that role,\" Van Vark said.\n\nFollow the Des Moines Register on Facebook | Download the Des Moines Register app for breaking news alerts\n\nFor many people, the words \"Pella\" and \"Korver\" are difficult to separate. Spiritual values and athletic competition are important.\n\n\"Korvers are Pella, in a way,\" Pella High School principal Eric Nelson said. \"They're what we strive to be.\"\n\nKirk, like his three older brothers, including Cleveland Cavaliers guard Kyle, was a Division I basketball player.\n\nKyle has been a 15-year NBA veteran. The Cavaliers posted this statement on their website: \"We are very sad to share that Cavaliers guard Kyle Korver’s brother, Kirk, passed away on Tuesday. Kyle has been excused from the team to be with his family. We extend our deepest condolences and heartfelt best to Kyle and his entire family as they go through this very difficult time.\"\n\nCavs superstar LeBron James spoke to the media Wednesday during a morning workout, offering his condolences to his teammate.\n\n\"I have sympathy for my brother, for his family,\" James said. \"It's tragic for him to lose a little brother in the fashion it happened. My prayers go out to all the family and everyone who has anything to do with his family.\n\n\"I hope he takes as much time as he needs to get back to himself, which obviously won't happen over night or over the next couple of months or maybe even the next few years,\" James continued. \"The healing process starts now and we're a part of his support group.\n\n\"He has a lot of support here.\"\n\nMORE: LeBron James speaks out about Kirk and Kyle Korver\n\nKirk Korver died following an undisclosed sudden illness in Iowa City Tuesday afternoon, according to Dan Sorensen, a spokesman for the family. Sorensen is executive director of operations for Third Reformed Church of Pella. Kirk’s father, Kevin, is the senior pastor at the church and his mother, Laine, is a church leader.\n\n\"They're such wonderful people,\" Pella football coach Jay McKinstrey said. \"They're full of love and full of grace.\"\n\nOn Tuesday night, more than 500 people showed up at the Third Church to support the family. The people just showed up, without even a word being shared on social media.\n\n\"It was kind of an overwhelming thing,\" Sorensen said.\n\nRELATED: Kirk Korver died from 'sudden illness,' family spokesperson tells Register\n\nAll four Korver brothers — Kyle, Klayton, Kaleb and Kirk — were Des Moines Sunday Register all-state basketball players.\n\nKyle and Kaleb played at Creighton, Klayton at Drake and Kirk at Missouri-Kansas City.\n\nKirk stood 6-7. He was an easygoing giant who loved to laugh.\n\n\"Everyone associated with the Pella basketball program is broken-hearted over the untimely passing of Kirk,\" former Pella boys' basketball coach Mark Core said said. \"He was not only a terrific athlete, but a kind-hearted young man with a tremendous sense of humor and ability to put people at ease.\"\n\nWhile the Korver family is most closely associated with basketball, Kirk was a four-year football player at Pella.\n\n\"You just wanted to have him as a friend,\" McKinstrey said.\n\nThe Korver family moved to Pella from California. Kevin became a prominent community leader in his role as a pastor.\n\nKyle Korver, an All-American at Creighton and a 2015 NBA all-star, linked the name to basketball in Iowa, too.\n\nBy the time Kirk took the varsity basketball court, he was occasionally jeered with \"He's not Kyle\" chants.\n\nHe took the taunts in stride.\n\n\"He was always able to handle things in the proper way,\" Nelson said. \"It wasn't easy, with your brother in the NBA.\"\n\nFROM THE ARCHIVES: Pella's Korvers are the first family of Iowa basketball\n\nVan Vark, a family friend, recalled how the Korvers helped fund the construction of the baseball field at Pella Sports Park that bears his son Blake's name.\n\nKyle donated T-shirts and Van Vark recalled Kirk carrying box after box of them to a charity fundraiser.\n\n\"The whole family pitched in,\" Van Vark said. \"Kyle and all the boys and parents reached out to us. They didn't ask how to help, they just did it.\"\n\nThose who wish to support the Korver family with messages can do so at the Third Church website.\n\n\"They've lifted so many people up, they've been so giving of their love,\" Van Vark said. \"It's everywhere here.\""
