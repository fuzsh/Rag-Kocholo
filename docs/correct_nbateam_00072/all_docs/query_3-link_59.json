        "text": "For Korver, the offseason is supposed to bring the opportunity to train, strengthen and refine his skills. No one loves routine more than Korver, and no part of the NBA calendar year serves as a better opportunity to jump into a developmental regimen than the summer does. But last summer, hindered by a pair of surgery rehabilitations, Korver did not get the chance to work through his preferred prep work. This summer, he will. “I’m looking forward to a good summer of training again and being able to get back to what I like to do in the offseason,” he said.\n\nOhm Youngmisuk: Kyle Korver says he doesn’t hold a grudge against Matthew Dellavedova, who ended Korver’s year in Game 2 of the Eastern Conference Finals last postseason when the Cavs point guard dove for a loose ball and rolled into Korver’s ankle. Korver underwent surgery to repair the ankle last offseason. “You can’t acknowledge it or it is a thing,” Korver said when asked how to guard against reacting if things get chippy with Dellavedova this series. “You just play. I don’t think there is any kind of ill will.”"
