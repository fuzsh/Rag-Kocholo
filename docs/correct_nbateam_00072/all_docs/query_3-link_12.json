        "text": "CLEVELAND: There were moments on Monday night at Quicken Loans Arena in which Cavaliers guard Kyle Korver resembled Hakeem Olajuwon, Dikembe Mutombo and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.\n\nNo joke.\n\nIf you watched Game 4 of the Eastern Conference finals, which the Cavaliers won 111-102 over the Boston Celtics, then you saw Kor­ver playing defense and swatting shots like those retired big men did during their NBA careers.\n\nIf you didn’t see the game, find a highlight package because Korver, who is 37, recorded three blocked shots on Celtics high-flying guard Jaylen Brown, who is 21.\n\n“Jose [Calderon] said something to me about shaking the finger [like Mutombo used to after blocks],” Korver said with a smile after the Cavs evened the best-of-seven series that will shift back to Boston for Game 5 on Wednesday night.\n\nKorver finished Game 4 with 14 points, four rebounds and three blocks. He made 2-of-2 2-point shots, 2-of-5 3-pointers, 4-of-4 free throws and consistently challenged Brown.\n\n“He’s a tough matchup for me,” Korver said of Brown. “He’s a young guy, super athletic. I’m just trying to play him smart and trying to take away his angles and was fortunate to get a couple there.”\n\nKorver’s first block came with 1:54 to go in the first quarter and led to a 3-pointer by George Hill nine seconds later.\n\nKorver’s second rejection occurred with 11:20 remaining in the second quarter and, five seconds later, Korver made three free throws after being fouled in the act of shooting a shot from long range.\n\n“I’ve loved Kyle ever since we made the trade to get him here,” said LeBron James, who finished with 44 points, five rebounds and three assists in 42 minutes. “I have no idea how Griff [former Cavs General Manager David Griffin] was able to pull that off still to this day. He’s just a true professional.\n\n“There’s not many of us ’03 [draft] class guys still around. I feel like we’re just cut from a different cloth because we’ve been around for so long. We have this work ethic, and you see [Korver] every day putting in the work, putting his mind, his body into it. It’s not about his age. I think it’s just always keeping his body in the right position.”\n\nKorver’s final block took place with 4:54 left in the second quarter when he poked a Brown shot out of bounds.\n\n“Kyle was great for us,” Cavs center Tristan Thompson said. “I think in the post with Jaylen Brown, that’s a tough coverage. Jaylen Brown has worked on his game in the post when he has a mismatch. He’s got some good moves down there. Kyle walled him up, stayed strong and then jumped him, changed his shots. Kyle was huge for us tonight in the second quarter defensively, getting us going. It’s a full team effort, and we’re going to need everyone to step up and be huge for us in Game 5.”\n\nKorver, who played 25 minutes Monday, added another memorable play toward the end of the third quarter with the Cavs ahead 89-74 when he sprinted down the court and dove on the floor for a loose ball that Celtics guard Terry Rozier poked out of bounds.\n\n“That’s a guy that’s all about winning, and whatever it takes to win,” Cavs coach Tyronn Lue said. “You very rarely see a 36-year-old running full speed against Marcus Smart, against Rozier and diving for the loose ball and laying it all on the line. Kyle is just a pro’s pro, man. He does everything right.\n\n“Every night he gives it 100 percent effort. … The veteran guys that we’ve had that have come through here — like Channing Frye, Richard Jefferson and James Jones — they know what it takes and understand what it takes to win.”\n\nLue then was told that Korver actually is 37 years old.\n\n“He’s 37 now?” Lue said. “God dang. We’re playing him too many minutes. We need him, though. We need him.”\n\nLue’s comments drew laughter from media members. Korver chuckled as he reflected on the dive onto the floor as he ran alongside Rozier, Smart and Marcus Morris.\n\n“I was trying,” Korver said. “I’m going to be hurting [Tuesday]. My back is a little sore, my elbow is a little sore, but this is fun basketball. It’s the playoffs. We’re at home. The crowd was rocking and it just kind of takes over you sometimes. So, yeah, whatever it takes.\n\n“I thought a lot of guys stepped up [Monday]. I thought Larry [Nance Jr.] was great. When Kevin [Love] got in a little foul trouble I thought Larry came in and gave us a huge spark.”\n\nJames also marveled at how Korver defended Brown.\n\n“He’s guarding Jaylen Brown, one of the most athletic wings we have in our league,” James said.\n\n“He’s 21 years old. Jaylen can fall on the ground 10 times and probably spring up and just as likely never feel it. I don’t remember Kyle falling too much like that. I’ve got to keep his body as fresh as possible.\n\n“But, listen, he’s doing whatever it takes to try to help us win, with the blocks, with the strips. Obviously his shot-making is very key for our team as well, but it’s just the intangibles he’s doing for us defensively that has put him in a position to be on the floor.”\n\nMoving forward\n\nKorver said the Cavs team that played the first two games in Boston “wasn’t us” as he thought about the two double-digit losses that preceded two double-digit wins in Cleveland.\n\n“That was really poor, poor basketball on our end, so we’ve come home and we’ve taken care of business,” Korver said. “We got to win one there, though, if we want to win the series, and I think hopefully we can take a lot of what we’ve done here the last couple games where we’ve had better movement, better body movement, better ball movement, screens, passing and our defense has been a lot more aggressive.”\n\nLue said the message is to “have the same approach going into Boston.”\n\n“I think playing with more speed and more pace, pushing the basketball,” Lue said. “I think taking care of the basketball is most important, especially on the road.”\n\nAdded Celtics coach Brad Stevens: “It’s the best two out of three to go to the NBA Finals. Doesn’t get better than that.”\n\nMichael Beaven can be reached at 330-996-3829 or mbeaven@thebeaconjournal.com.
