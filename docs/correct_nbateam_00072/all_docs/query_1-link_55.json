        "text": "\"How can I — as a white man, part of this systemic problem — become part of the solution when it comes to racism in my workplace? In my community? In this country?\"\n\nOver the past 15+ years, NBA star Kyle Korver has played for the Philadelphia 76ers, the Chicago Bulls, the Atlanta Hawks, the Cleveland Cavaliers, and, most recently, the Utah Jazz. So he clearly knows a thing or two about the world of basketball.\n\nWell, in the wake of a racist incident involving Oklahoma City Thunder's Russell Westbrook and a white Utah Jazz fan, Kyle opened up about his own white privilege both on and off the court in a recent essay titled \"Privilege.\"\n\n\"What I’m realizing is, no matter how passionately I commit to being an ally, and no matter how unwavering my support is for NBA and WNBA players of color…..I’m still in this conversation from the privileged perspective of opting in to it,\" he wrote.\n\nThe 38-year-old acknowledged that simply having a greater awareness of one's white privilege wasn't enough, and advocated for direct action, starting with himself: \"How can I — as a white man, part of this systemic problem — become part of the solution when it comes to racism in my workplace? In my community? In this country?\"\n\nKyle went on to propose additional actions for fellow white people — including educating oneself, de-centering and listening to others, and supporting leaders and policies who prioritize racial justice — and to ruminate on things like white guilt vs. white responsibility and loud racism vs. quiet, subtle racism.\n\nAs for his closing point? \"Time for me to shut up and listen.\"\n\nHis essay has since gone viral on Twitter, garnering 180K+ likes and 76K+ retweets, not to mention sparking a lively thread of thoughts, counterpoints, and thanks in the comment section.\n\nAnd finally, Kyle's essay compelled Sports Illustrated's Khadrice Rollins to pen a response piece that suggests some thoughtful next steps for both the Utah Jazz player and anyone else coming to terms with their white privilege.\n\nYou can read Kyle's full essay here.\n\nShare This Article"
