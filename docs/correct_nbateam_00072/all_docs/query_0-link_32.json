        "text": "Josh Smith may not hear the groans from the Philips Arena crowd when he squares up to take a 3-pointer this season. Why? Listen to Smith tell it. “You haven’t seen the roster?” Smith turned around a reporter’s question about his long-range shooting plans on a rebuilt Hawks roster. “We’ve got Kyle Korver, Devin Harris, Louis Williams, Anthony Morrow, Anthony Tolliver. Am I missing anyone? Jeff Teague. … So there we go. That answers that question. I didn’t even say my name did I? Call me mid-range shawty.”\n\nFormer Chicago Bulls guard and small forward Kyle Korver on Monday sold his 16-room mansion in Glencoe for $1.34 million. On July 13, the Bulls traded Korver, 31, to the Atlanta Hawks. However, his mansion had been on the market longer than that. Korver first had listed the mansion in April for $1.499 million, and he later reduced its asking price to $1.475 million and then to $1.449 million."
