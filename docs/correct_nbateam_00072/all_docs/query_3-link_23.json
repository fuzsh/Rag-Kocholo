        "text": "If you want to know what Kyle Korver does — and he has been doing it in the NBA for 14 seasons now — you just need to look at 77 seconds of play during the third game of the Cavaliers and Toronto Raptors series. Seventy-seven seconds, that’s all. And when you look at him in that short burst of play, you can see how important he might be on this current championship run\n\nThe Cavs were down by three at halftime, and throughout the third quarter, it had been back and forth between the two teams. As the third quarter was winding down with 47 seconds left, the Cavs were ahead by one point, and Kyrie Irving drove the lane. He saw Korver in the corner on the left side, kicked the ball out to him, and Korver drained a 3-pointer falling out of bounds with a guy in his face.\n\nThe next time down, Korver started on the baseline, circled up to the 3-point arc and took another pass from Irving. With what looked to be very smooth and effortless (but what we know is not), Korver caught the ball and spun and jumped and fired all in one motion, draining another 3 before the defense could stop him. The third quarter ended, but just 30 seconds into the fourth quarter, Korver did the same thing. Another spin and move 3, and the Cavs were now ahead by five points.\n\nKorver’s nine points in a little more than a minute started the Cavs run that put the Raptors down. J.R. Smith had been in foul trouble, and some of the other players besides LeBron James were somewhat listless. But there was no doubt about what Korver did and why: the Cavs needed a little jump start, and the 36-year-old knew the jump start needed to come from him.\n\nIf you think Korver’s scoring explosion in Game 3 was just a lucky coincidence, then take a look at Game 4 on Sunday when the Cavs won and swept the Raptors. The Cavs were tied 28-28 after the first quarter, and then Korver went to work. He scored 16 points in the second quarter with four 3-pointers (on 4 of 6 shooting), and the Cavs went ahead 61-49 at halftime. They really never looked back and won easily.\n\n“He’s automatic,” LeBron James said after the game. “When (Korver) steps on the floor, eyes have to be on him. … Just his ability to be out on the floor just helps us all out offensively because it just creates more space. From the time we got him all the way to now, and as we continue to play throughout the postseason, he’s been huge for our ball club.”\n\nThat is one thing NBA role players know they need to do — get the blessing from the team’s Chosen One when playing on the Chosen One’s team. But the interesting thing about Korver is that he might be the Cavs key secondary role player whom all championship teams have had. Think Bruce Bowen with the Spurs, Bill Bradley with the Knicks, Michael Cooper with the Lakers, Don Nelson with the Celtics. Guys who know they’re not stars, but know that their roles are key to winning a championship.\n\n“In order to have a good 3-point shooting team, teams also need someone who can command in many different ways from the outside,” Korver told The Athletic. “We have that here in Cleveland with LeBron. But by having three or four guys who can shoot out on the line while LeBron is in the game, it creates more space for him. He can take it to the hoop, dump off to a big guy rolling to the hoop, or kick it back out to hit a three.\n\n“In order to create that space, you have to have guys who can knock down outside shots. That’s how the league has changed since I came into it. It used to be that the 3-point shot was just thought of as an option after you got the ball inside on the block. Sort of what you try if nothing else is working. But now the 3-point shooter’s role is to move and create space in plays.\n\n“I know that’s my role. But I’ve always played that way.”\n\n***\n\nMost people think of Korver as some white guy from Iowa who does little more than stand around far away from the basket and fire 3-pointers. Not true on most of that, and mostly he is thought of that way because the media likes to portray him in a way the public can relate. But in many respects, Korver is very different: a guy who is always in constant motion, and a product of the Los Angeles inner-city who grew up watching Michael Cooper play great defense and shoot 3s on passes from Magic Johnson.\n\nThe Korver family moved out to California from the south side of Chicago in the early 1970s, and his grandfather served as the senior pastor at Emmanuel Church in Paramount, a crime-ridden suburb of Los Angeles back then. Kyle’s father, Kevin, and his uncle Ken became assistant pastors.\n\nOne of the focuses of the church was rebuilding and fixing up dilapidated housing in the Los Angeles area — 15 to 20 every Saturday. The church’s work became famous for their volunteer in Southern California, and was honored by receiving the “Thousand Points of Light” award and invitation to visit the White House from President George H.W. Bush. But in addition to religion, the family was equally enamored of basketball; the court they built in the church parking lot was where the family and neighborhood gathered almost every day.\n\n“Growing up, my whole family loved basketball, and we loved watching the Lakers playing the Celtics on TV on Sunday,” he says. “We’d go out and play after those games in the church parking lot, and my uncles were all Celtics’ guys and my cousins and me were all Lakers and Magic guys, trying to play like them. We’d have fun battles.”\n\nKorver now sees that experience as being both a church-going volunteer to improve poor neighborhoods and having hoops as his primary way to express himself in L.A. had a profound effect on who he became, both on the court and off. “Growing up in my neighborhood and playing basketball in Paramount, I was the only white kid out there, and it really shaped how I saw the world for the rest of my life,” he says.\n\n“Playing in the church parking lot was where all the basketball players in the city gathered, and I did too because I loved playing the game. That experience at that time was an incredible bridge for my mind. Race was never a focal point for me, because I never looked at the other guys playing as having black skin or brown skin or white skin. It was just ‘these guys want to play basketball, and I do too, so let’s get a game going.’ ”\n\nThe family moved to Iowa in 1993, after the 1992 riots in response to the court acquittal of four officers accused of beating Rodney King. Korver and his family remember seeing buildings and homes burning from his bedroom window.\n\nKyle Korver was devastated by the move, going from big time Los Angeles to little Pella, Iowa and a population of 10,000 in the sixth grade. What was ironic, however, was that his family was returning to the city where his parents met: Laine and Kevin started dating while both playing basketball for Central College in Pella in the mid-70s.\n\nThe list of which members of Kyle Korver’s family played basketball in high school and college is extensive. Suffice it to say, he didn’t have to go too far from his parents for advice. In fact, his mother scored 73 points in an Iowa high school game. “She told me once when I was in high school, I think, ‘Kyle, if you look at the front of the rim, you hit the rim. You look at the back of the rim, you hit the back of the rim. Look just over the front of the rim and the ball goes swish.’ ”\n\nKorver smiles when he thinks of that, but he also knows that he gets his mom’s competitive nature. “In some ways he is like his mom in that way, but he got a double dose of being competitive from coming from a family where everyone plays basketball,” says his uncle Kris Korver, who coaches men’s basketball at Northwestern College in Orange City, Iowa. “He’s never played for second in anything. He gets that look in his eye even when he is playing cards. That has served him well in the NBA.”\n\nBut he also gets a lot from his father.\n\n“We see sports as primarily a great gift from the Lord by which our boys would grow up to become men and also men with values, integrity and character,” Kevin Korver told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution in 2013. “We’ve been most concerned with the men they are becoming rather than the athletic achievements. We are very grateful for all they have achieved, but we are most grateful for how basketball has helped shape our sons — interacting with people of different backgrounds, all the dynamics of different races, learning to have disappointments. It’s a great shaper of character.”\n\n***\n\nThe irony of all this is how the general sports fan doesn’t care much about Kyle Korver being a man with “values, integrity and character” if he is not hitting 3s for your team and maybe helping to advance them to an NBA championship. What has changed is that the game is different now in many ways, and he has adjusted to it. He is not just a specialty outside shot maker, but also a guy who holds his own on defense and ball movement.\n\nOf the 58 players drafted in 2003 (Korver was No. 51 out of Creighton University by the New Jersey Nets), there are probably only three players ranking ahead of him in the NBA’s all-time pantheon of players: LeBron James, Carmelo Anthony and Dwyane Wade (Chris Bosh is a maybe). Korver is now the fifth ranked NBA player of all-time in points scored from 3-point land, and seventh best in percentage made.\n\n“When I first saw him his first few years in the league, he seemed to be one of those guys you thought might stick around for a short time because they have a specialty,” says Larry Drew, the Cavs assistant coach who was Korver’s head coach for a few seasons with the Atlanta Hawks. “I never thought he would get to this point, I’ll be honest. But when I coached him, I understood him better because I saw who he was as a person and how he truly understood how to shoot the ball within what the team needed. Defensively, you cannot make a mistake against him. He will make you pay. That’s his value.\n\n“It is amazing in many ways, because you think he would have slowed down over time and he hasn’t slowed down and he continues to get better. What I really admire about him is that he is an unselfish shooter, meaning he will come out from underneath and make a cut to the line and he knows he can make the right pass as well as shoot. He knows he commands a lot of attention, but also that attention is because of his overall basketball IQ skills and not just his specialty of shooting.”\n\nWhat happened is the game has changed, and made Korver and his teammate, Channing Frye, so much more valuable now than they were when they came into the league. Some of this came from limiting defensive hand checks and making shooting from the outside easier, and some has come from the spread-the-floor offensive style which took advantage of the multiple skills of NBA superstars like James, Russell Westbrook, James Harden and Steph Curry. In other words, the skills of the big men on the block with their back to the basket have fallen out of favor.\n\nBut having guys like Korver and Frye out on the 3-point lines, with a high shooting percentage as well, allows James to have multiple options when he has the ball. Frye shot 40.9 percent from the floor during the regular season, while Korver shot 45.1 (combined for Cleveland and Atlanta). The league average was 35.8 percent.\n\nThat is the role Korver plays, making more shots and thus making more offensive options for the superstar player.\n\n“Since I came into the league, the mindset has changed,” Korver said. “In my first four or five years in the league, they wanted to go inside first before the ball came back outside. Both in me passing or me posting, inside first. There weren’t a lot of 3s on the fast breaks, either. Having three guys outside was unheard of. But you just have to look at the numbers. Compared to what was shot when I came into the league and now is a huge difference.”\n\nThe team numbers bear this out. When James and Korver came into the league in 2003, teams were averaging 5.2 3-point shots made out of 14.9 taken. This year, in the regular season, teams were almost double their attempts and makes over 2003: 9.7 made out of 27 attempts.\n\nIn 2003, only three teams made more than six 3s per game and none made more than nine. This year, 11 teams made more than 10 3-point shots per game, and the top four — the Rockets, Cavs, Celtics and Warriors — are all contenders for the championship.\n\n“Defensive principles, many of them that you have grown up with for years, are going out the window,’’ Warriors coach Steve Kerr told NBA.com earlier this year. We’ve all had to sort of adapt to a new way of playing defense because of the much-bigger influence on the 3-point line. You used to play inside-out (defensively), but now everybody is playing outside-in. So how do you defend that? How do you approach that with personnel? It’s a big challenge, but it’s fun to us because it’s different.’”\n\nWhere this goes for Korver is not certain. He is a free agent after this season, and he becomes more expensive for the Cavs because they will be over the salary cap, and the luxury tax they will pay on his contract makes him almost double the expense. He thinks he has a few years left, but he likely doesn’t want to be an off-the-bench shooter on a bad team.\n\nHe is married to pop singer Juliet Richardson, (best known for her 2005 album “Random Order” and hit single “Avalon”) and they live north of Los Angeles. They also have three children under the age of five, so there is the possibility that Kyle Korver will be needed to man the childcare issues at home when and if his wife feels the need to get back in the music biz.\n\nAdded into this mix is his private foundation he created, in which he contributes nearly $750,000 a year for inner city education programs and home renovations for the disabled.\n\nSo the little smiling Iowa boy who wants to grow corn when he retires he is not. Nor is he the one who preens constantly and wants attention from the media after every game. He is none of those, and likes it that way. And the reason he is that way is because he knows where he fits in the hierarchy of the NBA these days.\n\n“Right now [my wife and I] really don’t know what is in store for us,” he says. “I feel like we love building relationships and meeting people, and I think that comes from our church background and both of us being in the public eye.”\n\nBut in the current right now, it is about a championship.\n\n“Championships are one of the main reasons you play sports,” he says. “I never won one in high school or college or my years in the NBA. To be the last man standing is why we do this. It would be amazing to be a part of that.”"
