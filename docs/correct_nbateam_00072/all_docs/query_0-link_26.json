        "text": "Al Bello/Getty Images\n\nAnd the free agency show must go on.\n\nOf course, this part of free agency is a tad boring.\n\nGone is the drama of players going back on comments about loyalty (Wade), not wanting to be second fiddle (Bosh) or caring about their legacy (James) in order to make a dream team, thus taking away all form of competitiveness athletes are supposed to have, ruining the reason sports are supposed to be played and...I regress.\n\nNow begins the signing of the role players.\n\nThe Chicago Bulls added a three-point threat in former Utah Jazz shooting guard Kyle Korver.\n\nAccording to sources close to the situation, because in free agency sources no longer have names, Korver will sign a three-year deal for an estimated $15 million.\n\nNewly signed Bull Carlos Boozer spoke highly of Korver and suggested the Bulls seek him out saying he can \"shoot the heck out of the ball.\"\n\nThe Bulls were without a sharp shooter after losing Ben Gordon to free agency last season, trading John Salmons during the season and Kirk Hinrich this offseason, opening up cap space to sign at least one of the big three.\n\nUnfortunately for the Bulls, they were unable to sign one of the big three and are left wondering if they are now stuck going after worse versions of the players they let go."
