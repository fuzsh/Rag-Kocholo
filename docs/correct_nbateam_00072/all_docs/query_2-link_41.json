        "text": "Rick Scuteri/Associated Press\n\nWith the Atlanta Hawks in the middle of a playoff race in the Eastern Conference, their front office may be willing to trade key players, including sharpshooter Kyle Korver.\n\nContinue for updates.\n\nKorver Likely to Stay in Atlanta as Hawks Reportedly Plan to Keep Core\n\nThursday, Feb. 18\n\nAdrian Wojnarowski of The Vertical reported Atlanta is \"expressing its intentions to rivals that Hawks plan to keep team intact at deadline, holding onto [Al] Horford and key guards.\"\n\nKorver Linked to Cavs\n\nThursday, Feb. 18\n\nTerry Pluto of the Plain Dealer noted on Feb. 15 that he keeps \"hearing [Korver is] a possible trade target\" for the Cleveland Cavaliers. However, Fox Sports' Sam Amico reported on Thursday the pursuit is on \"life support.\"\n\nHawks Examining Entire Roster\n\nTuesday, Feb. 9\n\nAccording to Kevin Arnovitz and Brian Windhorst of ESPN, the Hawks are having \"serious internal discussions\" leading up to the Feb. 18 trade deadline about using Korver, Al Horford and Jeff Teague as trade bait.\n\nPer the report, Atlanta's ownership and management \"have conceded internally that unless Atlanta can recapture the magic of last season's historic run, this season's team is a fringe contender.\"\n\nThe Hawks entered the All-Star Weekend with a 31-24 record, good for first place in the Southeast Division and fourth in the Eastern Conference.\n\nArnovitz and Windhorst noted Hawks head coach and president of basketball operations Mike Budenholzer regards Horford and Korver as \"essential\" to both the product on the court and the chemistry in the locker room.\n\nThe report added that even though Korver's ability to shoot from three-point range will likely draw a lot of interest, he is \"less likely to leave\" than Horford or Teague."
