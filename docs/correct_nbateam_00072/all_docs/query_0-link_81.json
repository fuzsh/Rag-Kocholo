        "text": "If the Miami Heat were “Hollywood as hell,” the 2010-11 Bulls were Chicago as hell.\n\n“As hard as any team that we ever played,” Heat legend and longtime nemesis Dwyane Wade said.\n\n“You knew every time you stepped on the floor against those guys they were going to be a physical matchup, an old-school Eastern Conference game,” Heat forward Udonis Haslem said. “And you probably were going to need a couple of bags of ice after the game.”\n\nA couple bags of ice. The Bulls were giving those out all season, along with the Ls they were dishing out almost every game.\n\nThe Bulls won 62 games that season. It was the peak of the post-Jordan Bulls. It was the team that every Bulls squad will be measured against until one makes it back to the NBA Finals.\n\nThose Bulls captured hearts across Chicago and surprised the rest of the league with hard-nosed play ushered in by their maniacal first-year coach Tom Thibodeau. They junked up games with suffocating defense, sacrificed their bodies for loose balls and lost themselves in the team. They had Derrick Rose in his prime, a 22-year-old hometown hero who couldn’t be stopped.\n\nThose Bulls had the right players with the right personalities at the right time. They were all, pardon the cliché, humble and hungry, cognizant of their roles and committed to not standing out as the weak link. Their bond — which remains to this day — wouldn’t allow them to let down their teammates or their city.\n\n“I’ve been fortunate to be a part of a lot of great teams, not only as a head coach but as an assistant coach as well,” Thibodeau said. “But I put that team up there with any of them just because of how hard they played. And I thought they played up to, and maybe exceeded, all expectations. And that’s really how you measure your team.”\n\nThey had toughness. They had togetherness. They had Rose. They had Thibs. They had a bench mob. They had a present and a future.\n\n“We just had guys who hated to lose and loved to just grind and play hard,” said Kyle Korver, a reserve forward on that team. “It wasn’t always pretty when we won, but we had great defense, a great team scheme and we just kind of wore people down. When you’re playing in a blue-collar town like Chicago, I think they just really appreciate that. They were behind us 100 percent. The United Center was rocking every night. And on top of that, Derrick, he was amazing. The intensity that he brought every night, how he led us with that intensity, he was special.”\n\nIt was a team that was supposed to have staying power, a team everyone thought would reboot the glory days and, sooner rather than later, hang a seventh banner inside the Madhouse on Madison. It wasn’t to be. It all ended tragically, a result of well-documented injuries, the gut-wrenching and cold-blooded reality that comes with sport.\n\nBut what a season it was.\n\n“That year in particular, it put the Bulls back on the map,” former Bulls big man Carlos Boozer said.\n\nFor everything they did, everything they embodied, that year’s Bulls are still adored. And they always will be. When the Bulls from that era return to the United Center with other teams, they are celebrated and cheered like the returning heroes they are.\n\nNo one will ever forget the 2010-11 Bulls. This is their story.\n\nTHE GRIND\n\nJOAKIM NOAH, center: We worked our asses off.\n\nDERRICK ROSE, point guard: Nobody would really understand the grind. It was a grind, bro. I think nobody understands how locked in every single person was on that team.\n\nTAJ GIBSON, power forward: Everybody had something to prove. Everybody understood defense. But we were just hungry and eager to win. We understood early, when you win big everybody wins, from top to bottom. That was our mindset. We just fed off each other. But we worked hard in the gym. We were always in the gym.\n\nLUOL DENG, small forward: Nobody was hungry for numbers or anything. It was all about winning games. I think early in the season we started to realize how good we were. And we just made that the No. 1 thing, to win.\n\nRONNIE BREWER, swingman: We put our heart into it for the city. We were so passionate about winning and winning for the city because they deserved that. And I think that’s basically what fans should know. We did it for the city.\n\nGIBSON: Chicago is a place with a great fan base, first off. But if you go hard and you play your heart out with blood, sweat and tears and do what you got to do to help that team and help the organization, help the city, that city will love you the rest of your life.\n\nBREWER: The fans and the people of Chicago could relate to guys who busted their butt, grinded and worked hard day in and day out to get a positive outcome. I think that’s why fans really enjoyed us so much.\n\nJOHN PAXSON, executive vice-president, basketball operations: They were excited. A lot of it stemmed from Derrick being a hometown kid and having success. That was the thing, I think, everybody took pride in. Here was this homegrown young man excelling, and now the team is back to a level that could be something special for a long period of time.\n\nAfter consecutive 41-win seasons that each ended with a first-round playoff exit, the Bulls fired coach Vinny Del Negro after the 2009-10 season. They turned over the franchise to Tom Thibodeau, a longtime NBA assistant who had won a championship two years prior as associate head coach under Doc Rivers in Boston.\n\nThibodeau’s only head coaching experience came 26 years earlier, for one lone season at Division II Salem State. He was 25. Now, he was a well-respected NBA assistant, one of the hottest names on the market and the man management ultimately entrusted with the returning the Bulls to national prominence. Thibodeau was as good as advertised, going on to win the Coach of the Year award that season. Thibodeau spent the summer at the Berto Center, the Bulls’ practice facility in suburban Deerfield, and so did most of the players, who hadn’t yet formed relationships with trainers across the country. When players went to get shots up or lift, they wound up spending hours with Thibodeau. Those workouts set the foundation for what he expected out of them.\n\nPAXSON: We did a lot of work on a lot of guys that year before we hired Tom. We had Vinny, and that obviously didn’t work out for us. We were looking for — I guess more than anything what you find when you start digging in on Tom and get to know him is that he’s just a basketball lifer. This is his life. He’s not married. This is what he does. And we felt we were talented enough in terms of having Derrick and how good he could be and some of the other pieces we had. We felt that we needed someone who would teach and coach them every day. When we look back also, you knew a lot of stories about Tom as an assistant coach. But there’s something to be said for people that pay their dues and are given an opportunity. And he was given an opportunity, and we went on to have one terrific year.\n\nBRIAN SCALABRINE, reserve forward: He established perfection. That’s what he was after. Practices were fast. There wasn’t a lot of wasted time. The ball was up the floor. Everyone sprint to your spot. If you came off a screen and you bobbled the ball, reset. If you delayed on a cut, reset. It was perfection at the highest level. We didn’t scrimmage a lot. We didn’t go five-on-five a lot. But it was high-level detail and perfection. That’s what he demanded. Every drill had to be perfect.\n\nGREGG POPOVICH, San Antonio Spurs coach: He’s a fighter. He’s a competitor. And he’s going to win the battles. By that, I mean defensively he’s going to have standards. He’s going to make demands, and he’s not going to back off. And he usually wins that battle. There are a lot of teams at a certain point in the season that players will win the battle and the defense goes to hell. And that’s what you remember most about Thibs. He’s going to get every ounce out of somebody, especially at the defensive end. His whole heart is going to be there every play. You’re going to hear from him. He lives it and breathes it more than anybody.\n\nGIBSON: He always yells. But that’s just his way of showing that you’re always on his mind. I realized that. When he’s yelling at you, you’re constantly on his mind. You’re thought of. You don’t want to be a person that he just lets you do whatever and he doesn’t say anything.\n\nBREWER: Yes, Thibs was hard. Yes, he practiced hard. Yes, he got flak for it. But at the end of the day, we enjoyed the journey. And we really, really appreciated him holding us to that accountability to where you had to come and work hard day in and day out. We really took that challenge.\n\nPAXSON: They had really good leadership from Tom. He got them to play hard. He got them to defend. And it’s not that easy to do … But we had a group of guys who bought into that and were willing to be coached on that. And Tom did a really good job with that.\n\nDARREN COLLISON, Indiana Pacers guard: I liked Thibs because Thibs was a defensive coach. When you played against Thibs’ teams, you knew you were going to be in for a good, defensive matchup.\n\nSCALABRINE: Thibodeau, that year, if you want to get technical about it, which is not great for your story, but he kind of was the first to commit to “downing” or “icing” the pick-and-roll, where guards were seeing this for the first time and were, like, “Oh my God, what am I going to do against this?’” Nowadays, stars just cool the ice on the pick-and-roll. But back then it was new. We were doing something. And Taj Gibson was switching on the pick-and-roll, and they rarely saw that kind of stuff. We were innovative defensively. I think we were ahead of the curve. And we had active bodies and length.\n\nBREWER: Coach Thibs did a really good job emphasizing, “Hey, we’ve got a lot of talent, but talent doesn’t win games. Hard work and dedication wins games.” I think that we really realized that.\n\nGIBSON: We understood that Thibs, he had everything down pat as far as what we needed to do to go far in the playoffs. He said we’ve got to be a good homestretch team. We got to win the games we’re supposed to win. And we’ve got to get a high seed. We got to get home-court advantage. That was our main goals. And we just knocked them down. Every day, he had the goals up on the board and we just knocked them down. Be a top-five team on defense. Be a top-five team in rebounding.\n\nSCALABRINE: I don’t know if basketball is always played that way. There’s a certain amount of unpredictability. But not that year. That year, we tried to work at a level that was much faster than you played the game and the attention to detail that you would want in the fourth quarter of an NBA Finals.\n\nKYLE KORVER, reserve forward: He just grinded a toughness mentality into us.\n\nPAXSON: Tom was just a grinder, an every day, grind-it-out kind of guy. And that group was very similar.\n\nSCALABRINE: Thibodeau was the most dominant personality. We never really had a real dominant leader like the teams I’ve been on in the past with, like, (Kevin) Garnett and (Paul) Pierce and Jason Kidd. It’s unique being around that. Thibodeau was the main voice of the team.\n\nDENG: When Thibs came along, we just knew that he was a great defensive coach; great details. But we didn’t know how his coaching style was going to be … We didn’t know what to expect, but we just wanted to win. We were tired of losing.\n\nBUILDING A TEAM\n\nThe Bulls positioned themselves to be a major player in the summer of 2010, the most highly anticipated free agent class in NBA history. LeBron James, Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh were all unrestricted free agents, and the Bulls had meetings with all three. Chicago, like many teams, had spent the previous season shedding salary and preparing its pitch.\n\nThey traded John Salmons to Milwaukee for expiring contracts midway through the 2009-10 season, relieving themselves of his $5.8 million player option for 2010-11. They traded Kirk Hinrich and a first-round pick to Washington, getting off the final two years, $17 million owed him. And they allowed Ben Gordon to sign with Detroit. All told, the Bulls created roughly $30 million in salary cap space, enough to land two of that summer’s prized free agents.\n\nPAXSON: There were a handful of teams that were in that position that had money to spend, and we were one of them. We put a lot of time and thought into it. We always felt that we presented ourselves to LeBron and the other guys very well. The one thing we did that we thought was pretty powerful was putting up on a screen the lineup of Derrick, Joakim, Luol and then plugging in LeBron or whoever else it was, a Bosh or a Wade. Our selling point was this is a great team, and this is a team that’s going to win championships.\n\nWhile all three players supposedly were interested in the Bulls — Thibodeau reportedly made a good impression on James — James and Bosh famously joined Wade in Miami, tipping the scales of competitive balance and ultimately becoming the Bulls’ nemesis.\n\nPAXSON: There are so many factors that play into it. Some nice things have been said about us since then, that we did a good job. But it doesn’t count when you don’t get the big prize. It was a learning experience in terms of going through all of that and trying to prepare for it. We gave it our best shot. Unfortunately, we weren’t able to get a guy like LeBron to come to Chicago. We always felt we were in the game with all of them. We felt we were in a position that if we could get two with the players we had, Derrick being the cornerstone of that (team) but also having Joakim and Luol and those type of guys, we thought if we got two we’d be a championship-level team. But that’s the heartbreaking part of this business sometimes.\n\nWhen the writing was on the wall that they had swung and missed on the marquee free agents, management quickly moved on to Plan B. The Bulls brought in two-time All-Star Carlos Boozer, inking him to a five-year, $72 million deal. Technically, the transaction was as a sign-and-trade with Utah, which gave the Jazz a trade exception instead of losing Boozer for nothing and gave the Bulls a 2011 second-round pick they ultimately flipped and turned into Nikola Mirotic.\n\nBoozer was lauded as the dominant big man the Bulls always needed. But due to his defensive limitations, he ended up standing out on a defensive-minded team. A broken hand before the start of the season sidelined Boozer for the first 15 games, and it was a big adjustment for him leaving more of a facilitating point guard in Deron Williams and teaming with a scoring point guard in Rose.\n\nPAXSON: Carlos helped us. Tom got him to compete on the defensive end. Carlos was a really good defensive rebounder who could help start our break, and he had a little bit of a mid-range game that you could play through. So he really helped us. He was a big part of that team that went to the conference finals.\n\nBREWER: It was an up-and-down year because they signed him to that huge deal, and I think all fans are, like, “Ah, man, we signed this guy to all this money. He’s supposed to be averaging 30 points and 20 rebounds.” People go in slumps. People get hot. We still went to Booz. He still was one of our main guys. It just so happened that other guys on the team stepped up and played well.\n\nCARLOS BOOZER, power forward: It really wasn’t a down year. It was different. You’ve got to think, in Utah my point guard was Deron Williams, who was averaging 11, 12 assists. He was a pass-first point guard. Going to Chicago, I had a scoring point guard who was averaging 25, 30 points a game. Some games he was doing more than that. So you’ve got to understand, when you’re playing with a scorer at your point guard position, that’s like playing with Allen Iverson. You’ve got to play off him. Most of the plays were for him. Ninety-five percent of the plays were for him, and the other five percent ended up in his hands anyway. He was just that good. Me averaging, I think it was almost 18 points per game that year was awesome because (Rose) was our main threat.\n\nBREWER: Fans are fans. They’re going to have their opinion. And you want them to because that’s what makes the games so exciting and why we love it so much. But I think he really stuck with it. He was very positive. When Taj came in the game and played well, he was so supportive of Taj. He was happy that Taj was doing well. When Joakim came in and was playing well, he was so excited for Joakim and was excited that he played well.\n\nBOOZER: The only tough part of that year for me was breaking my hand and missing the first 15, 20 games of the season. I remember having to come in after the first 15-20. But I played the rest of them.\n\nBREWER: Even though sometimes Booz didn’t have a great game or he was getting subbed out in the fourth quarter for different reasons, he just stayed positive because at the end of the day, the end goal was to win. And if we won the game, he was happy. Maybe it might have affected him some emotionally and with some confidence level. But he handled it really, really well, like a professional, like he’d been his entire career. I was very appreciative of Booz and what he brought to the team with toughness and his skill set.\n\nBoozer’s signing set off a domino effect that ultimately set up the Bulls for the season. James officially chose Miami the day after Boozer’s deal became official, but the Bulls recovered well with sneaky shrewd signings that elevated their shooting and synergy, defense and depth.\n\nThey signed Korver on July 13, inked Brewer on July 16, came to terms with Kurt Thomas on July 26 and added Keith Bogans on Aug. 11. Korver, one of the most prolific 3-point shooters in NBA history, was the biggest splash. The Bulls nearly had both Korver and JJ Redick, whom they gave a three-year, $19 million offer sheet on July 9. A week later, the Orlando Magic matched it.\n\nAt the time, none of the signings moved the needle, and they certainly weren’t the seismic moves the Bulls had hoped to make that summer. But they were substantial in their own right, and each of those under-the-radar additions helped the Bulls on their march to that magical season. Even Bogans.\n\nSCALABRINE: What I remember most about Keith Bogans is Kurt Thomas always making fun of him.\n\nBREWER: Kurt would get onto him because typically in the NBA at shooting guard you scored a lot and you were athletic. I mean, that’s generally what comes to mind when you think of a typical NBA shooting guard. Either he can shoot the ball really well, score the ball really well, and he’s usually athletic. Well, that wasn’t what Keith was. So Kurt always joked with him about him not having hair, him not being athletic, him not scoring a lot of points, him not being able to dunk.\n\nSCALABRINE: When we would go out and we’d be talking to some people and they’d be, like, “Do you start?’” And Keith Bogans would be, like, “Yeah, I start for the Bulls.” And then Kurt Thomas would run over there and be, like, “Yeah, but you won’t see him in the second and fourth quarters.” (Laughs). No matter how good of a game he had, you never see him in the second and fourth.\n\nIt was non-stop. When you say a silent assassin, that man (Thomas) would roast people. I don’t know if he could survive in today’s day in age because players are sensitive now. He’d roast your outfit. He’d roast your car. He’d roast the way you shoot. He’d roast you all day long. And he always does it with a compliment. You know, “Keith Bogans is the man. He’ll be in that starting lineup setting the tone. Hell no, you won’t see him in the fourth quarter.”\n\nBREWER: YouTube was still prominent at that time. So you could type Kurt Thomas’ name in and see all the altercations that he got into. So nobody really wanted to try him because dude was not scared to throw an elbow or throw a punch or get in an altercation. We looked him up on YouTube all the time.\n\nSCALABRINE: I saw him in Dallas this season while calling games. He comes up to me and out of nowhere. He didn’t even say hello. He roasts Keith Bogans. “I saw Keith the other day. He’s in better shape now than he was when he was the starting two-guard for 82 games.” And then he just kept walking, like, kept it moving.\n\nDENG: Keith is one of those guys where, as a teammate, he was very professional when he came in. He never, ever complained about how he was treated in terms of starting and then coming off. But he played his role to a T. Kept working. Stayed in shape. Kept guys loose in the game just by cracking jokes and everything. So guys like that are really guys that don’t get a lot of credit, but they did so much for us.\n\nBREWER: He didn’t get a crazy amount of attention. But he came in and did his job day in, day out. He didn’t want his name in the headlines. But he went out there and guarded the best player every night. Didn’t ask Thibs to draw up a thousand plays for him to get shots. Came in there, worked hard, did his job and did what he’s supposed to do. And that’s what you want as a professional, a true consummate professional.\n\nSCALABRINE: The defensive mentality is the thing that gets lost, how he guarded the best player and he could bring it to start the game. He’d get right into the game. And when he’d go out, he just wouldn’t sub in again until the half. He was just a guy who could make open shots. He was good for Derrick. He would guard tough players and establish the defensive identity at the start of games. He doesn’t get a lot of credit, but I thought he was really important to establishing how you want to play at the beginning of the game.\n\nBREWER: What kind of made me want to go there is I got a text message from Booz and Kyle. They had their minds made up that they were going to go there. I hadn’t signed at that point, and they were, like, “Man, I think this could be something really special. This is the guys that they’re bringing back. There’s going to be playing time.” Booz, Kyle and myself, we had a relationship going back from when we were in Utah. So we were basically brothers and best friends coming to the team.\n\nTHIBODEAU: That team was a hard-playing, really-together team that played for each other. I think the expectations for that team was, like, a 40-win team, or a 41-win team and ended up having the best record in the league.\n\nTHE RIGHT MIX\n\nSCALABRINE: You know what’s unique about that team? There’s an element of all the personalities. Think about it. You have Derrick Rose. To me, if you are a kid from the inner city and you hoop, or you’re a little white kid growing up in the suburbs, you want to grow up and be like Derrick Rose. Just think of that population. Then you have Joakim Noah, how different he was when you look at his personality. It’s like this, “I don’t care. I’m going to wear these clothes. I’ve got my wild hair. I’m just out here.” And it’s almost probably along the same lines as the Dennis Rodman population back in the ’90s where it’s just all the wild people in the world just love Joakim Noah.\n\nAnother one, I think, would be Kyle Korver and his little mix. He kind of looks like Justin Bieber, and all the teenage girls think that he’s cool with his hair and all this stuff. And then you have me for all the middle-age white men living in their basement of their mom’s house trying to make it in life. You had Luol Deng and the connection with Africa. I mean, you just go on and on. There were so many different demographics on that one team. And then you add in the coach. Everybody who loves Bill Belichick and the hard-nose coach from back in the day could associate with Thibs. So I really felt that we were America’s team that season.\n\nBREWER: Everybody had different personalities, and they weren’t scared to show it.\n\nDENG: Jo always looked at himself as a rock star.\n\nROSE: I had Jo, I had Lu, very solid vets who give out positive vibes, positive energy. And I feed off of it because that’s who I am. I’m a positive guy. And they’re worldly. They were not only talking about basketball. They were talking about what’s going on in Africa. What’s going on over there in Sweden, like, global shit. It wasn’t like it was only solely on basketball. So I felt like they were almost like my big bros and I was just learning from them.\n\nDENG: I was the guy, probably, who loved to joke around and party, but everyone thought I was the guy who was at home reading a book (laughs), which I did. I really give this image that if we’re close you will know. But I’m very silly, and I think the team knew that.\n\nGIBSON: It was a lot of good memories. After hard-fought games, we would have fun, go out. Thibs would understand that men are going to be men. We would go out and party together.\n\nSCALABRINE: I’ve never been a partier. But that year, I think I went out more than any other year in my career. I wasn’t going out and drinking. I was just going and hanging out and wrapping it up at 1:30 a.m. And I never went out as a player. That year, I mean, the stories, I could go on and on. I’m not going to talk about the stories of going out.\n\nGIBSON: The league back then was different. Guys were doing all-nighters all the time.\n\nBREWER: I don’t know how many times we went out to eat and we had four, five or six guys together off the team eating. Every home game. On the road. Going to the movies. We wanted to go out together. Anything. We were always moving as one unit. And I think that translated to the basketball court because it was, like, “That’s my brother’s keeper. He has my back. I have his back.” And we genuinely liked each other and cared about each other. And you could really tell that by how much we hung out and did stuff together.\n\nROSE: I just remember everybody enjoying it. You could tell that they were celebrating it for the whole team, for the guys who weren’t going out. I loved seeing my teammates enjoy it more than I am, more than I do. I went out here and there. But I’m not a partier like that. But they understood that. They understood, “You did this tonight, but we’re going to celebrate like you were there.” I made an effort to go whenever I could. But the majority at the time, I was at the crib.\n\nDENG: It was fun, man. It was fun. For a few years in a row starting with that team, it was a team where we just all got along. We played hard for each other. Everybody understood their role. But more than anything, we liked each other. Everybody on the team got along.\n\nGIBSON: We were friends. Everybody was cool with each other. We had a good group of guys where everybody just went out there and played hard. We didn’t have any fakeness. We had everybody on the same page. Everybody was doing what they had to do. But everybody was getting everybody in line. If one guy slipped, we were always pulling him close, like, “It’s all right, man, we’re here.” We didn’t really have too many bad apples. That’s one thing I can appreciate from being around this league a long time.\n\nROSE: We played unselfishly. Everybody had one common goal, and that was to win the championship. But we knew that it was going to be very tough. I think everybody was just cool with each other on and off the court. We had that bond that you need, that chemistry that you need for your team to go pretty deep in this league.\n\nDENG: What made it really unique is we expected each other to get the job done. You kind of relied on everybody. You didn’t look over your shoulder. And you kind of knew what everybody was going to give you.\n\nBREWER: We were such a close-knit group. No matter who led the team in scoring, at the end of the day if we won that was the most important thing. And I think that that separates a lot of teams and what makes teams special. It’s not who gets the headline every night but at the end of the day who wins the games. And I think that’s what we really bought into and wanted to be really special and win as many games as we possibly could.\n\nTHIBODEAU: Just the way they shared the ball, the way they played defense. They played for each other. They were happy when anyone did well.\n\nGIBSON: We were all humble guys or real quiet guys.\n\nDENG: When you look back, we had an MVP that everybody bought into on the team, everybody loved. Everybody wanted him to get that MVP. We knew how good Derrick was, and everyone played their role. I remember the year that I was an All-Star, I almost felt shy about it. I felt like, “Don’t even say it.” Even when I found out I just felt like there’s guys on the team that play just as hard. I remember my first year when me and Derrick went to the All-Star (in 2012), I felt like Jo was an All-Star. But I got it. So I was like, “Man.” That’s how much we loved each other. We didn’t really care about All-Star or all these numbers. It’s one of those things where you wish you could go back to where you just hooped. It was just hooping.\n\nPAXSON: When you have a successful season or a successful period, there’s so many people that contribute. It’s not just one guy. It speaks volumes about the game of basketball. It is a team game. We all want the great players. You don’t win without great players. But there’s more to it than that. It’s the synergy of the group. That is as important as anything. And when you’ve got it, you know it. And when you don’t have it, you’re always searching for it. And I think that team had just tremendous synergy.\n\nBENCH MOB\n\nThe Bulls also had a dominant bench unit. They were a motley crew, with flaws aplenty. But together, they made it work. Behind blanket defense and brilliant rebounding, they found success and formed the second-best bench crew in the league behind Dallas.\n\nThey didn’t score much, ranking in the bottom third of the league in bench points at 27.5 points per game. But they made damn sure you didn’t score either. They held opposing benches to 26.2 points per night and 39.4 percent shooting, leading the league in both metrics. On many nights, they rescued the starters from poor starts. They also mastered how to maintain leads, so much so that Thibodeau would close games with certain reserves. As the season wore on, Bulls fans celebrated that bench crew, affectionately labeling it the bench mob and arriving at games with signs and T-shirts commemorating their efforts.\n\nSCALABRINE: They loved the bench mob.\n\nGIBSON: Our bench got more praise than our starters half the time. We had a whole movement. We had a whole “Bench Mob” movement. Guys were making so much money at the time. Everybody was eating free. Everybody was getting love all around the city from just playing hard.\n\nPAXSON: You had Korver and you had Ronnie Brewer. You had players that accepted the minutes they got and contributed to winning, and that’s what this thing is really all about. But you have to have professional guys that accept that.\n\nBREWER: We didn’t care who got the glory. And we didn’t care who led us in scoring. We didn’t care whose name was in the paper, or who’s the most popular in that situation. We just wanted to be, like, “Hey, when we come in we want to set a precedent that we’re going to make a difference in the game.” No matter if we were up by 10, up by 20, or down by 10 or down by 20, we wanted to come in and make a difference. Once we got in and we did that, we played defense really, really hard and that led to our offense.\n\nDENG: We had guys who were coming off the bench that could start on so many other teams. And I think that gave us confidence. The days that we didn’t have it, they had it. Even the back-to-back days, they had it.\n\nPAXSON: Kyle Korver was a really good example. He was a shooter that, as he’s still doing all this time later, just comes in and makes shots and he spaces the floor for you. Kyle might have been a forgotten guy in that thing. C.J. Watson was another guy. He played the backup position to Derrick. When he was needed to play the off guard, he could do that some. We had Ömer Aşik, who was a very good player at that time who kind of gave us some support and anchored our defense. He’s a really good defender and rebounder.\n\nSCALABRINE: C.J.’s a point guard, and he could set guys up. And a lot of stuff never really bothered him. You had a lot of plays ran for Korver, so he was drawing double teams and stuff like that. Ronnie Brewer was great on the baseline. And you had the two bigs, which were basically Ömer and Taj Gibson. They had some mixing in there. But obviously Taj Gibson and Ömer ended up having pretty good careers. So a lot of those guys, just the dynamic of that fit worked when going against other teams.\n\nBREWER: It’s really tough in professional sports because if you’re a starter, you know in the back of your head that the guy behind you wants your position. Nobody wants you to get hurt. But if you do get hurt and they get to step into that position, they get to show not only the coach, but the front office and every other team, that if given the opportunity this is what I can do. We didn’t want anybody to get hurt. But we knew once your name is called, you have to stay ready so you don’t have to get ready. And we genuinely felt like that all the time. That wasn’t our mentality, “Hey, the guy behind me wants my position or wants my spot or wants my minutes or wants to get paid what I get paid.” It was, “Hey, if I’m given the opportunity, I do not want to let my team down. I do not want to let my teammates down. And I’ve got to play up to this level not to do that.”\n\nDENG: Honestly, it got to a point that year where our bench was so good that a lot of times — if you go back through the games, I wonder how many leads we had going into the fourth where our bench came in and just finished the game.\n\nSCALABRINE: Korver would get a few buckets for us. And C.J. would make big shots. And then, if you had some guy that was hurt, you had Kurt Thomas, who was going through a midlife crisis having to play for our team, he would step up and just pick and pop and make big buckets.\n\nPAXSON: I didn’t know him before we got him. Tom obviously knew him and said he was a winner and a pro. And that’s what he proved to be. He proved to be a great vet who you could throw into the game. He was always tuned into the defensive end of the floor. My recollection of Kurt is that he always was a really good team defender, a good rebounder for his size and position.\n\nSCALABRINE: Midlife, man. He should have retired, but he can’t walk away. He just kept hanging on. Midlife. That’s his nickname. Midlife.\n\nBREWER: Kurt was great. We knew that if we ever got into any type of altercation he was going to have everybody’s back to make sure that they were good. He would joke around and he’s a funny guy, a great guy to be around. But then you still got to take into account that he’s still an OG enforcer. He would still punch and elbow or clothesline somebody at the drop of a dime.\n\nSCALABRINE: But he was good. Kurt was good. I don’t think people realized how good of a player he was. I think he had a few double-double nights. He was good for us.\n\nBREWER: He was old, but he was still talented. He might not have played for a lot of games. But when his name was called, when somebody was hurt, when someone was in foul trouble, he came out there and did his job. And you have to respect that. And that’s why we called him the OG.\n\nGIBSON: Kurt Thomas was solid. I loved playing with Kurt. I learned so much from him. Everybody learned so much from him. He was the type of veteran who could go out, literally go out to the club, come in the very next day, be the oldest guy in the gym and give you the most effort and still do his job … Some games, his jumper was just on. And right when we needed him.\n\nBREWER: Thibs was very, very, very big on watching film the next day. Or after the game getting with your position coach and going over the film. And to be able to watch the games and see that the starters didn’t end the game, the guys who came in off the bench closed or basically were the closers, we took pride in that.\n\nD. ROSE, CHICAGO’S FAVORITE SON\n\nFor as good as the bench was that season, the Bulls’ ultimate closer was Rose. The offense centered on him, and he delivered time and again in the clutch.\n\nThat was Rose’s third season. He was coming into his own after two enormously promising seasons that saw him win Rookie of the Year in 2008-09 and average 20 points in 2009-10. The 2010-11 season would be Rose’s best. He averaged a career-high 25 points with 4.1 rebounds, 7.7 assists and one steal. He played 81 of 82 games and averaged a career-best 37.4 minutes. At season’s end, Rose, at 22, was named the youngest MVP in league history.\n\nBREWER: I hadn’t been around a player like that in my career where he wanted to be the best and he was going to try to work as hard as he possibly could to be the best.\n\nSCALABRINE: I played with Garnett and Pierce and Kidd and (Kenyon) Martin and all these guys. I thought (Rose) was going to go down as the greatest player that I ever played with. I was thinking top 10 player for sure, maybe have an opportunity to be on Mount Rushmore. That’s how highly I thought of him before his injury.\n\nPAXSON: He was unique in that he was so young, but so determined to be great. And he did it in such a quiet way, which was kind of refreshing. Derrick was not one to talk and boast. At that time he was the kind of guy who’d go out and just show you who they are instead of tell you who they are. That’s what he did. He was comfortable that way. And his teammates just respected the heck out of him.\n\nGIBSON: He was just a dog as far as competitiveness. Every guard that came into the building, he said he had a mindset of attacking them. He didn’t want to take days off as far as going at guards. A big-name guard would come into the arena and he would make sure he would go at them and try to dominate the game. His defense was sound. He wanted to really play that “I’m not going to let you score” mentality and it showed every game. You would see certain guys, certain opponents miss games. He just was taking them out. That year, he was attacking non-stop. He always told us “I’m going at him tonight. I’m going at this guy tonight. He’s not scoring on me tonight.” A lot of these guys are the leaders of this generation now. So it’s crazy. It’s a crazy thing.\n\nBREWER: We used to joke around and kind of try to push his buttons and be, like, “Hey, D. Rose, we were out there warming up and Russell Westbrook was talking crazy like he’s about to go at your head.” Or (Rajon) Rondo. Or Dame Lillard. Whoever. Maybe it’d be Steph Curry. Or maybe it’d be, “Hey, John Wall is the best player coach (John Calipari) coached.” Keep on going down the line of people. And to see how he reacted, not talking a lot because that’s not what he did. He wasn’t much of a talker. But to see his actions and how he took that to heart and how much attention to detail he had about being great was phenomenal.\n\nDENG: I remember going back meeting with (Jerry) Reinsdorf before we drafted, and he asked me who to draft. At the time, we had the No. 1 pick and there was a bunch of talk about who should go No. 1 and who shouldn’t. I remember meeting with him and I said, “Honestly, (Michael) Beasley’s a great player, but Derrick is something that doesn’t come often.” It’s just one of those things. Everything fell in your hands to pick it. So I was for Derrick. I think a lot of other guys were. But that’s when I really felt I was part of the build-up, when I sat down with the owner and he asked me. And when it happened, I remember being so happy and looking forward to it, that we got a guard that good. And you could tell right away in training camp that he was going to be special…I just remember seeing what I saw and I’m, like, “I haven’t seen this.”\n\nPAXSON: Derrick seemed to do special things all the time that year. He just had that determination that he wanted his greatness to translate into winning.\n\nSCALABRINE: The year before, he would do well at the end of games, except that team wouldn’t get stops. Now all of a sudden, the last four minutes of a game teams would get two field goals and a free throw, and Derrick Rose would go off because he was so unstoppable. But I don’t know if it was much different the year before. He became a mythological figure down the stretch.\n\nCOLLISON: I don’t think there was a game plan. It was just “If he gets his, just make sure you try to stop everybody else.” He was so quick. He caused problems in the teeth of our defense, similar to what he’s doing right now. He was just more athletic.\n\nSCALABRINE: You were getting an opportunity to play with greatness.\n\nOn May 3, 2011, Rose was named MVP. With Noah, Gibson, Brewer and assistant coach Ron Adams sitting on a ballroom floor, backs against a Kia, the award’s sponsor company, Rose delivered a heartfelt acceptance speech that had him fighting back tears.\n\nHe thanked his teammates, management, ownership, his agent, B.J. Armstrong, and his family. When he got to his mother, Rose almost broke down. It was a moment no one saw coming. Rose had never revealed that level of emotion in a public setting. He was too quiet and kept to himself too much. But for those four-plus minutes, fans got to see the person teammates call the true Derrick Rose.\n\nBREWER: People worked really hard to try to get Pooh out of his shell to show the fans how he really is, because he was so quiet and kind of kept to himself on a national scene. He didn’t want all the glory. But when you got to know him and be around him, he was a very outgoing person. You could see him laugh and smile and joke.\n\nGIBSON: If you didn’t know him, if he didn’t know you, or you weren’t a teammate, or you didn’t have any kind of relationship with him, he was quiet. He did not talk to you.\n\nDENG: Every time you got Derrick to do something, it was special because you got him out of his shell.\n\nBREWER: Just because it was D. Rose and he was quiet, it’s not like we excluded him from our interactions. He was in the middle of it. That’s when he would come out of his shell and you would actually see the true D. Rose and his character and who he really was. That’s why I think so many guys who played with Derrick Rose really respect and appreciate him so much because they know who he really is as a person on and off the court.\n\nTHIBODEAU: That was the best thing about Derrick is his humility. He was so dominant, but when his teammates played well he was happy.\n\nGIBSON: At the time, he didn’t really talk much. So whenever he did say something, he really meant it.\n\nBREWER: I didn’t know it was going to be an emotional speech.\n\nGIBSON: It was coming from the heart. He was telling the truth. He wasn’t sugarcoating anything. That was the real him.\n\nBREWER: D. Rose is as good as it gets, man. He’s a phenomenal dude. It was a blessing to be able to be on the same team he was. And he deserved everything that he got. He tried to do so much for the city. For him to do that while playing for the Chicago Bulls, it’s very humbling to see how far he came and what he’s doing.\n\n‘GET DAT JO’\n\nJoakim Noah didn’t struggle with shyness. He had the most colorful personality on that 2011 team and served as the perfect complement to the soft-spoken Rose.\n\nAs the starting center, Noah provided defense, energy, toughness and leadership. He also inspired confidence, unafraid of anyone and ready to battle everyone.\n\nThe Bulls signed Noah to a five-year, $60-million dollar contract just before the start of the season. But his season was interrupted by ligament damage in his right hand. He was sidelined from mid-December through late February and missed 34 games that season. But he embodied the city of Chicago with his passion and hustle plays, while becoming an ambassador for the city through his community engagement off the court.\n\nWADE: Chicago is a tough city, and he’s a tough player. He gave everything he had to the game. With no ego. He just went out there and put his body on the line. It’s that kind of city. They love guys who are just tough. The fans see the dunks and all that stuff. That’s pretty. But a guy who, every night, they know what they’re going to get from them, they know he’s going to lay his body out there and give them everything, they will always love him for that.\n\nNOAH: It’s never the same as how it used to be, but I still get love.\n\nNoah, who hadn’t yet signed with the Memphis Grizzlies, was at the Bulls’ game on Oct. 29 this season, a 149-124 beatdown by the Golden State Warriors. But Noah’s appearance on the jumbotron during a break in action electrified the fans so much they almost had to pause the game.\n\nNOAH: I hadn’t been in the arena in a long time. Chicago’s like a second home, and it makes me feel really special to be able to first of all get love from the organization, for them to receive me like that, bring my family to the game, it really feels like home. For them to put me on the jumbotron like that and get love from the fans is just special because I really worked as hard as I could. Even though we didn’t win a championship, I think that people in Chicago really respected those teams because we worked our asses off.\n\nHASLEM: Just the ultimate competitor man. Every rebound, you’ve got to make sure you box out. He was just a great defensive presence out there. Being a force. Getting his guys involved. Keeping his guys encouraged and engaged. But the energy and the passion that he played with.\n\nDENG: Everybody always loved hanging out with Jo because he was just such a light-hearted, loving guy. He’s the kind of guy who, if he goes out and we all eat, he wants to pay the bill. He’s just that kind of guy.\n\nBILLY DONOVAN, Oklahoma City Thunder coach, Noah’s college coach at Florida: Complete winner. I would imagine great in the locker room. Knows what goes into winning. There’s nothing selfish about him. It’s all about winning for him. He understands the level of sacrifice it takes. He’s a great teammate. He’s a great guy to have on your team. He’s selfless. He’s going to bring energy every night. He’s going to cover for his teammates. He’s going to encourage his teammates. He’s a consummate team guy.\n\nNoah had a way of supplying incredible sound bites. The best from that season came after the Bulls’ loss to Miami in the Eastern Conference finals. During his postgame interview in the locker room, Noah, with conviction and without hesitation, famously labeled LeBron, Wade and the Heat “Hollywood as hell.” When the late Craig Sager followed up on the phrase, Noah stuck to his guns, doubling down by looking Sager squarely in the eye and repeating, “Yes, they are Hollywood.”\n\nBOOZER: That’s Joakim, man. He was like our Dennis Rodman. He was our guy that would try to get under the other team’s skin. I remember being in Utah before I got to Chicago, and I saw him do an interview about Cleveland. He had a smooth sound bite, like, “When people bring up vacation, don’t nobody talk about vacationing in Cleveland. Like, who wants to be here?” Even though I found that funny, I played in Cleveland. Cleveland fans are terrific. I had a great time there. I really enjoyed being in Cleveland. I was, like, “That’s the kind of guy you want to go to war with.” He’s one of those guys that’s going to talk trash, but he’ll also back it up. And he gives you everything he has, not just in the games but also in practice every day. Jo was his own personality all by himself. He’s got that hippie swag. But when he steps on the court, he’s like a lion.\n\nBRINGING THEIR ‘A’ GAME\n\nThe Bulls went 9-8 through their first 17 games, showing few signs that they’d be in for a special season. They started December with back-to-back blowout losses, getting smoked by 29 at home against Orlando, and losing by 12 at Boston. But that was the turning point in their season.\n\nAfter those two thuds, Chicago reeled off seven straight wins. The Bulls lost consecutive games only twice the rest of the season and never allowed a skid to extend beyond two straight defeats. They lost by double digits only five times that year and finished with a 7.3-point margin of victory, the second-best in the league behind San Antonio.\n\nThey went 36-5 at home, won nine straight and 28 of 32 to end the season.\n\nSCALABRINE: Derrick was good. But he wasn’t next level. And then he started just taking over. The roles started getting defined. I think Thibodeau, because it was his first coaching job, started to evaluate and determine what works and doesn’t work. And then coach stopped playing me, and then everything started taking off from there. I played, like, the first six games and we were .500. He sat my ass down and then we were great.\n\nGIBSON: That (Magic game) was a game we just learned from. We always stressed that if we want to go far in the East we got to set the tone and leave a mark when we play those teams as far as Orlando, Boston, Miami. Orlando was a dog. I remember the previous year they kind of embarrassed us a whole bunch.\n\nDENG: I don’t know if that’s what turned the season around. It was more getting comfortable with what Thibs was trying to do. Because at first, not everybody understood what he was trying to do. Not everybody was on the same page. And I think once we started winning and putting runs together, we just kind of trusted each other.\n\nBREWER: He stayed on us. Thibs always made us hold ourselves accountable. I mean, if you would have been around Thibs you would have thought we were one of the worst teams in the NBA. But Joakim had a saying, “Humble yourself, or the game will humble you.”\n\nDENG: We looked at the standings and we saw where we were in the standings. And every game you were approaching the playoffs.\n\nBREWER: We were winning games, but we still were playing and moving around like we were in the hunt to try to make the playoffs. We knew we were a good team. We knew we were winning. So our swag was a little different. But it didn’t change our preparation at all. And that’s what made it so much fun because we were, like, “Hey, yeah we won five in a row, six in a row, seven in a row. But that doesn’t mean anything. We can get beat by the worst team in the NBA if we don’t bring our ‘A’ game.” That’s what made it special and made that group of guys really, really special.\n\nHOLLYWOOD AS HELL\n\nThe Bulls dispatched the 37-win Indiana Pacers in five games in the first round. They took a 3-0 lead and held the Pacers to 90.2 points per game in the series. In the semifinals, Chicago closed out the upstart Atlanta Hawks in six. They held the Hawks to 85.7 points per game, limiting them to 73 points in both Games 2 and 6.\n\nIt set up an Eastern Conference showdown with the Heat. Chicago swept the three-game regular season series, winning all three by a combined eight points. The rivalry was intense, with Chicago fans resenting how that team came together, with all three stars spurning the Bulls. Once the Bulls took off that season, it became a real rivalry. And every regular-season victory was celebrated.\n\nThe Bulls got off to a good start in the playoff series, winning Game 1 at home by 21 points while holding the high-powered Heat to 82 points. But that was their only win. Miami won Game 2 85-75, with the Heat really turning up its defense in the fourth quarter. James took over, scoring 29 points and grabbing 10 rebounds, while Wade had 24 and nine boards. James also started defending Rose during key points in the game, particularly in the fourth quarter. The Heat won three straight, two at home and one more at the UC, to move on to the NBA Finals.\n\nDONOVAN: I went down to Miami in the playoffs and saw Joakim to watch him play. They were young. I think there was a lot of toughness in that team. There were guys emerging and coming into their own. There was a lot of excitement about that team and it was going to be a team to be reckoned with for a long period of time.\n\nGIBSON: We won the first game, blew them out.\n\nPAXSON: I haven’t thought about this stuff in a long time, but we get to the conference finals and we win Game 1. And you start thinking, “Man, we’re three wins away from getting to the NBA Finals.” And obviously we didn’t. We lost four in a row to LeBron. And that was disappointing. But we were set up to be really good for a long time with the idea of being able to change our team a little bit at times and get better around Derrick.\n\nGIBSON: The second game, we had the lead and it came down to a one-possession game. We missed some easy bunnies at the rim late.\n\nGibson tied the game at 73-all with 7:16 left. But the Bulls would get outscored 12-2 the rest of the way, with their only points coming on another Gibson basket that cut their deficit to 78-75 with 2:29 to go. James and Wade closed it out from there. Gibson scored eight of the Bulls’ 10 points that quarter. But he’ll mostly be remembered that series for dunking on Wade in Game 1.\n\nWADE: By the time we got to the playoffs and they smacked us in Game 1, we had to settle in and understand, “OK, listen, these guys, they ain’t playing no games. The only way we’re going to beat them is if we get into a fight with them.” And we had to get in there. I think they beat us by, like, 20-something on the rebounds in Game 1. And we came back and kind of controlled that and it changed the series.\n\nPAXSON: What got us in the end was, after we won Game 1 — and it’s the greatness of LeBron — defensively, in key situations, because we were in those games, we had chances to win them, but they put LeBron on Derrick. And LeBron’s size and strength negated some of the things that Derrick could do at the end of games that would have helped us win. My memory tells me that that was the key in that series.\n\nKORVER: I’m sure we can go back and look at things we could have done better and plays that could have been better. But we ran into a Miami team, they played really good. They ended up losing to Dallas. But the shots they were hitting against us that Game 2, I think we had a lead in Game 2. And then LeBron and D. Wade both just hit just, I mean, left-handed running layups, like, tough shots. And they were guys who had been there before. They had kind of been in those moments before.\n\nBREWER: Those guys had such a high skill level that it made it tough. But at the same time, it made you really appreciate the competition and the battle that you went through. And I wouldn’t change it for the world. I really enjoyed it. It didn’t turn out how I wanted it to. But I really loved it. It’s some of the best memories I have of that. LeBron James is great. Dwyane Wade is great. They deserve everything they got. I wish it would have turned out a little bit differently because we wanted to win a championship so much for the city that hadn’t had a lot of success in a while until we came along. But we gave it all we had. We lost to a better team and a better talent.\n\nWADE: I think, ultimately for us, we just had a little bit more talent. And even though we beat them in five, it wasn’t that easy. They definitely made us work for it. But we were just a more talented team. They played as hard as any team that we ever played.\n\nGIBSON: It was a really close series.\n\nHASLEM: Those guys made us tap into every part of our game, every aspect mentally and physically in order to beat those guys.\n\nDENG: You know, that’s the year that I felt we should have won the ring.\n\nGIBSON: When you think about it, Miami went on to lose to Dallas and I think we beat Dallas that year.\n\nPAXSON: It’s hard not to think that something really special was going to come out of that given that we were three wins away from an NBA Finals and we felt like we were in the best shape ever.\n\nHASLEM: You never know. They definitely challenged us. They pushed us. And they made us find out how good we could be. If it wasn’t for those guys pushing us, who knows what kind of team we would have been. Those guys pushed us every time.\n\nTHE AFTERMATH\n\nWADE: The unfortunate thing for them is that the next year D. Rose got hurt. As a fan of the game, you want to see that team continue to take that hit that they took in the Eastern Conference finals and come back next year and meet us again in the Eastern Conference finals and see what they’ve got and see what we got.\n\nKORVER: It’s very rare that teams that are young in their first time in those experiences, no matter what you do in the regular season, to just walk into the postseason and go all the way to the championship. There’s moments where you have to have experience. You have to have been through those hard times together as a team, and that was our first time doing that.\n\nBOOZER: Just a special season. We felt like if we could have kept that team moving forward, the experience that we had losing to the Heat that year in the conference finals, if we could have been healthy after that season the experience would have carried us on to the finals. And then you see what happens when the ball goes up in that series.\n\nPAXSON: It’s so hard to get to. You have to have a little luck along the way. But we felt we had prepared and made some pretty good decisions along the way, too. And it also shows you how fragile the business can be. When you do feel like you’re close, something dramatic can happen and it changes the course of your franchise.\n\nWe got lucky in the draft getting that pick with Derrick. But some of the other choices that we had made, going back to Luol and some of the other things we had done, getting Joakim, I just felt like we were on the cusp of something sustainable and really, really special. And unfortunate, the next year Derrick goes down. And it was never the same.\n\nGIBSON: It was fun. The city was jubilant and was excited for next year.\n\nThe NBA went into a lockout that summer, costing teams valuable practice time. Before it happened, the Bulls drafted No. 30 that summer, selecting a swingman named Jimmy Butler out of nearby Marquette University. Butler, it was said, loved to play defense. But unlike his new teammates, he didn’t get to work out with Thibodeau all summer at the Berto Center and it took him a while to garner playing time. The lockout and the need to make up for lost revenue caused the league to agree to a truncated 66-game schedule that all but eliminated practice and rest time. Rose started getting nagging injuries, and he played 39 of the team’s 66 games. The Bulls returned the entire team except for Bogans, whom they traded during their first practice of the preseason. They added veteran guard Richard Hamilton and had the best record in the league once again, going 50-16. They looked like they would again challenge Miami for a Finals berth. But everything changed when Rose went down at the end of an easy win over Philadelphia in the first game of the playoffs, tearing his left ACL. After that season, the Bulls dismantled the bench mob and waited for a Rose return that never happened. Rose’s star dimmed and that perfect relationship between Rose, the Bulls and Chicago would never be the same.\n\nKORVER: Is there anything we regret? I think we overachieved as a group. We squeezed every ounce that we had out of ourselves. We left it all out there for sure. I think everyone was just exhausted by the time the season was over. It was a great season. I just think we didn’t have quite the experience that we would have needed to beat that Miami team to win the championship.\n\nGIBSON: I remember after we lost in the East finals, I didn’t have to buy a meal. I was eating everywhere free. I was just enjoying Chicago. I was going to Gibson’s like four times a week. I was in there. I still to this day know every waiter. I know the chefs, everything. I was going in there, literally, in shorts and slippers. Like, I was living there.\n\nDENG: I wish that we would have gotten a ring, a championship for the city. But honestly, when I look back, everything happens for a reason. And I really believe we gave it everything. I’m sure there’s people who could say you could change a few things here and there. But everything happens for a reason. God blessed us with so many other good things. But if we would have won a championship, it would have been great. We didn’t. But everyone from that group went on and had a good career.\n\nNOAH: I was working out with Taj all summer.\n\nDENG: We’re all still in touch.\n\nNOAH: What you’ve got to understand is you spend so much time in the locker room with these guys, and you spend more time with these guys than your own families. I was going through a lot in New York and lost my confidence, didn’t even know if I wanted to keep playing. And then you have a guy like Taj. I was working out with him all summer. It brought my joy back because it brought me back to those times. And to be with him every day, to see how motivated he is, and we’re the same age. And being in the gym every day, working out, it gave me my hunger back. It gave me my edge back. That’s what it’s all about. It’s bigger than just that year. It’s like, what, seven years later, and I’m going through my things. And just having my brother there to support me while I’m going through my struggles, that’s what it’s all about.\n\nBOOZER: We were just a band of brothers, and we still talk to this day. To this day, we wish that we were still together, still playing.\n\nThe Athletic’s Stephen Noh and Tony Jones contributed to this story, interviewing Noah and Korver.\n\n(Top photo: Jonathan Daniel / Getty Images)"
