        "text": "On the one hand, Kyle Korver entered Thursday night tied for 38th for 3-point percentage at 40 percent. On the other hand, Korver set an NBA record from that distance last season shooting at a whopping 53.6 percent. So what would happen if the league invited Korver to participate in the 3-point shootout as part of All-Star weekend? “I’d have to think about it,” Korver said. “I haven’t heard anything yet.”\n\nKorver, after all, drained 53.6 percent of his 3-point attempts last season for Utah. That’s an NBA record. But for one night, Derrick Rose was the best long-range shooter on the floor. He drained a career-high five triples on just six attempts Saturday night against the Timberwolves. “His shot looks the same every time,” Korver said. “His weight is going forward, he’s holding his follow-through and he has great body control.”\n\nRose agreed that his surge is due to hard work, not a change in his form, and “the confidence to shoot it. They’re leaving me open, so why not?” Defenders are leaving him open not because they’re generous or lazy. “It’s a pick-your-poison type of thing,” Korver said. “And you know what? They’ll keep daring him to shoot because he is so good at getting to the basket. “(Teams) start the game hoping he’ll be off … then he goes 5-for-6 and they scratch their head and say: ‘What do you do?'”\n\nAfter missing the team’s last practice in Chicago before a seven-game road trip, Bulls reserve swingman Kyle Korver participated in the team’s morning shootaround in Houston before Tuesday’s contest against the Rockets at the Toyota Center. Korver had an MRI on his right knee Monday to investigate soreness following Saturday’s home win against Washington. “[I’m doing] quite a bit better. Had a MRI and a bone scan yesterday. They said it was a bone bruise and the [fat] pad under my kneecap got bruised,” said Korver before the team’s shootaround. “Just waiting for that to heal a little bit, but I’m going to try close-out drills today, see how that feels and if it’s all right, try to go, but we’ll see.”\n\nBulls swingman Kyle Korver has paid $1.38 million for a 16-room mansion in Glencoe that once was listed for $2.95 million. Korver, 29, signed a three-year, $15 million contract during the summer to join the Bulls from the Utah Jazz. Now, he has become the rare Bull to buy in Glencoe. Most Chicago-area homeowning Bulls over the years have bought downtown or in other northern suburbs like Northbrook, Highland Park and Lake Forest."
