Tom Clancy’s Splinter Cell 3D is a remake of Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory developed by Gameloft and published by Ubisoft. It was both an exclusive and a launch title for the Nintendo 3DS. While the game is a port of Chaos Theory, it includes features from Conviction as well, including projected text and fusion vision. In 2007 China and North Korea are unhappy with Japan’s new Information Self-Defense Force as they believe it violates Article 9 of the post World War II constitution (there is a news report about the I-SDF in a cutscene in Pandora Tomorrow).

Which restricts Japan from possessing any armed military force capable of striking outside its own borders. China and North Korea set up a blockade in the Yellow Sea and the United States is forced to respond, as per their agreement with Japan following World War II. They send their most advanced ship, the USS Clarence E. Walsh, into the Yellow Sea hoping China and North Korea will back down. Meanwhile across the world, Sam Fisher is sent by Third Echelon into Peru to rescue a programmer who worked on reverse engineering the Masse Kernels.

While much of the gameplay of Splinter Cell 3D is similar to Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory, there are some changes and differences between the two versions. The biggest feature of the game is the 3D, making use of the no-3D glasses technology of the Nintendo 3DS. Additionally, all of the features and gadgets for the player to use are all grouped on the lower touch-screen. The objectives, similar to Splinter Cell: Conviction, are displayed in the environment as a projection (something Chaos Theory never did). Much of the version seems to be based on the PlayStation 2/GameCube versions of Chaos Theory.
