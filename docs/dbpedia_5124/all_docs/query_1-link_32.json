        "text": "The Nintendo DS version of Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell Chaos Theory is one of those games that, pardon the pun, slipped under the radar. Though we knew the game was in development, it was only when the game was nearly completed just a few weeks ago that Ubisoft finally pulled the wraps off the product and gave DS gamers a glimpse of the direction the game has taken for the newest handheld creation of the stealth action series. This Nintendo DS product will ship to stores on June 28th, but Ubisoft has given us an early peek at the game with the final build a few weeks before the release date.\n\nPrevious handheld renditions of the Splinter Cell series appeared on the Game Boy Advance, but in side-scrolling fashion due to that system's inability to do 3D as easily. The GBA versions essentially boiled down to Sam Fisher-meets-Prince of Persia, with more puzzle elements than action. The side-scrolling environments also made for some clunky stealth mechanics, but it was the best the designers could do in the limitations given to them.\n\nThe Nintendo DS version of Chaos Theory is a fully 3D experience, using the system's hardware capabilities to pull off the engine. Though the game isn't quite as pretty as the console versions that showed up on the GameCube, PlayStation 2, and Xbox earlier in the year, the Nintendo DS features essentially the same gameplay mechanics of the bigger console productions. Anything that Sam Fisher could do on the big screen can now be done on the DS system's dual-screen setup.\n\nThe game puts players through an extensive training mission that teaches players the basics of guiding Sam Fisher through his abilities and the complex control structure. Here, you'll learn all the essentials that it'll take to sneak around in the dark: run, walk, crouch, roll, hug the wall, climb and hang from ledges, dangle, cling and crawl pipes in the rafters. And, of course, this training mission teaches weapon handling, something that will certainly come in handy right from the start.\n\nThe Nintendo DS version uses every conceivable control input of the handheld system to give players as much control over Sam Fisher as possible. Movement's pulled off via the D-pad, and combine that with the L trigger you'll be able to change your speed from a walk to a creep. The touch screen not only allows for simple navigation through inventory and the different goggle modes, it's also a way to maneuver the third-person camera around in either digital or analog fashion. Players can either tap the arrows to move the camera in that direction, or simply tap and drag on any other part of the screen to move the camera around like a \"mouse look\" on the PC.\n\nThe touch screen also comes into play during special sequences, like picking locks and entering codes. And it seems kind of silly to say so, but it's pretty cool actually typing in an acquired passcode number into an on-screen keypad. It just feels the part.\n\nThere's no denying it, though: Splinter Cell DS's framerate isn't exactly prime. In motion, the game moves at sub 30 frames per second but due to the game's careful pace the less-than-fluid refresh isn't all that bad. The reason for the slower framerate is most likely due to the lighting effects in the game; players will move through differently lit environments, from fully illuminated rooms to complete darkness. Sometimes it's a mixture of both, with some rooms having the fluorescent lights flickering down the hallway. Turning on the different goggle modes definitely brings that framerate down even more due to the extra rendering involved to provide the \"ooh neat\" effect.\n\nWe were able to play around with the game's multiplayer option through the use of a second copy of the game. One of the biggest selling points of Chaos Theory is its Spies/Mercenaries multiplayer where opponents duke it out in enclosed arenas. Here, Spies, essentially one or two \"Sam Fisher\" characters, wander around the environments and attempt to hack into the three different computers around the arena. The mercenaries work in a FPS perspective and attempt to blast the spies before they can do their hacking duties.\n\nAs cool as the concept is on the Nintendo DS, the balance is a little off due to the inability to configure the control scheme on the handheld version. It's as if the developer didn't play around with Metroid Prime Hunters: First Hunt to see how to do FPS games properly on the Nintendo DS; the mercenary control does work, but only for right handed people, and only using the stylus since the \"look\" control is only on the touch screen -- forward, backward, and strafe are mapped exclusively to the D-pad and not the A, B, X, and Y. And no amount of configuration changes can alter that. The other downside is, of course, Sam Fisher's \"aiming\" function using the touch screen; in single player mode, it's a bit more cautious and careful so taking your thumb off the A, B, X, and Y buttons to slide the finger around the touch screen for precision aiming isn't all that bad. But in the much more fast-paced multiplayer mode, it's an unbelievable hassle that players will really have to get used to before mastering. Spies will more resort to sneaking up behind players and snapping their necks instead of using weaponry, which is honestly the way it should be anyway.\n\nThe DS version of Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory's strengths definitely lie in its single player campaign. The multiplayer is certainly a plus, but so far the complex control structure makes the deathmatch-style modes a little more clunky than the same mode on the console versions. We'll hold off on our final word for our full review at the end of this month.
