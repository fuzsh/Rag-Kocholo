        "text": "A few days ago Gameloft released some new screenshots of the upcoming iPhone version of Tom Clancy’s Splinter Cell Conviction that we first saw back at GDC. They also promised a “new revelation\" regarding the game, which we’ve since discovered to be an iPhone-exclusive level where players try out their sea legs and captain a speed boat down the Potomac River.\n\nIn other news, Gameloft is also releasing an iPhone Iron Man 2 game. IGN got a peek at the game, and it sounds like it’s going to provide an impressive amount of fan service with multiple Iron Man suits, Warmachine, and all kinds of suit upgrades that you earn across nine included levels that presumably span the major scenes of the movie.\n\nFinally, the last tidbit from Gameloft is little more than a 16 second teaser trailer:\n\nSo far the thread in our forums nearly unanimously agrees that this is some kind of Prince of Persia game, and with the movie coming soon, it would make a lot of sense that Gameloft would release this with the movie just like they did with the Avatar game. Since all three of these games seem like they have potential to be pretty cool, stay tuned for more updates as we get them."
