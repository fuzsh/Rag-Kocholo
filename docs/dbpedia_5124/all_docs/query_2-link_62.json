        "text": "Game Developer known as Your_Friend_Dillon showcased a new WIP of their passion project, an Unreal Engine 5-based first-person shooter inspired by the stealth elements of Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell, the level design of Dishonored, and the cybernetics of Deus Ex series.\n\nAccording to the developer, the stealth in this game favors ambush-driven gameplay versus pure ghost-style approaches but there will be achievements if you're able to pass through levels undetected.\n\nHave a look at some other demo clips below:\n\nRight now, Your_Friend_Dillon is solo developing the project but plans to secure funding to hire an animator and level designer. While there's sadly very little information about this project, the developer highly encourages everyone interested to give them a follow to stay up to date.\n\nAlso, don't forget to join our 80 Level Talent platform and our Telegram channel, follow us on Instagram, Twitter, LinkedIn, TikTok, and Reddit, where we share breakdowns, the latest news, awesome artworks, and more."
