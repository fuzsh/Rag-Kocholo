        "text": "Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Pandora Tomorrow is the mobile version of the console game of the same name and the third mobile game in the series. Like the previous two games it is a stealth based platform game played from a side view perspective and consists of similar gameplay. The game is set in the Indonesian jungles where the player has to hunt down and stop the guerilla group Suhadi Sadono. The objective of each level is simply to get past all the guards and reach the exit. The guards can either be sneaked past or be taken out with a silent attack or by firing the gun. Making too much noise or being seen in the light leads to alarms being triggered. In addition to the guards there are also mines, lasers and turrets to watch out for. Lights and mines can be taken out by using the gun."
