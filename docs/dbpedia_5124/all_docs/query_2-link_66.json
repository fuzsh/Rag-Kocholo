        "text": "NEW YORK - April 8, 2005 - Gameloft, a leading developer and publisher of video games for mobile phones, announced today that its title, Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell Chaos Theory, is now available for gamers worldwide.\n\nSam Fisher is back and his enemies have evolved with him. Armed with better weapons and ready for knife fights in close quarters, he will need all his stealth skills to infiltrate a Peruvian army base, slink behind transparent Japanese folding screens, and negotiate an underground train station. The magnificent backgrounds and interactive settings, where water levels rise, rain falls, and trains pass, complement the action packed gameplay.\n\nOn the day of its release, Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell Chaos Theory was made available to Gameloft's 130 operating partners, as well as 150 affiliates. Seven hundred different versions were developed in Gameloft's internal studios to accommodate 180 mobile phone models and 5 languages. The game is available today in 65 countries worldwide.\n\nIn conjunction with this announcement, Gameloft reports that the Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell series has sold more than 3 million units.\n\nReleased in November 2002 and inspired by Ubisoft's infiltration game for PC and console, Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell for mobile phones became an instant hit and was a huge success, essentially revolutionizing the mobile game genre.
