In addition to the PC, the game will be available on the Xbox® video game system from Microsoft for Holiday 2004, as well as on the N-Gage platform, published by Gameloft®. Details on other platforms will be forthcoming. The game, which debuted to massive buzz and won numerous awards at the recent Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) in Los Angeles, including official show awards for Best PC Game, Best Action Adventure Game, and a Special Commendation for Graphics, is expected to be one of the year's most talked-about titles.
