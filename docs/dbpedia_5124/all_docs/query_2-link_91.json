        "text": "Are you ready for two Splinter Cell games?\n\nThe latest episode of the Xbox News Cast with Colt Eastwood podcast may have dropped a hint about the development of another Splinter Cell game from Ubisoft.\n\nThe popular video game developer previously announced that it was remaking the first Splinter Cell game with a \"modern-day audience\" in mind.\n\nSecond Splinter Cell Game Remake Details\n\nThe latest Xbox News Cast with Colt Eastwood episode had Middleagegameguy, AKA MAGG, as its guest speaker regarding the EU's approval of Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard - a deal the UK's Competition and Markets Authority blocked in favor of a free market.\n\nDuring the talks, MAGG starts talking about a new Splinter Cell game 47 minutes into the show. However, he stopped himself before he could say anything more to protect a buddy of his who works for Ubisoft Toronto.\n\n\"Splinter Cell is coming, I know because I-\" MAGG said.\n\nHowever, MAGG was willing to confirm that Splinter Cell is a third-party multiplatform game, meaning that gamers can play the game on PlayStation and Xbox video game consoles, and even the PC if it's included. Since Ubisoft disclosed plans to remake the first Splinter Cell two years ago, it is safe to assume that Ubisoft might make the game playable on the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S, per Gameranx.\n\nRead More: Former ByteDance Executive Reveals TikTok Provides Access to Chinese Government\n\nWhile it's true that Ubisoft is remaking the first Splinter Cell game, MAGG could also be describing a separate Splinter Cell game altogether, or if it's the same one Ubisoft is currently working on. However, Ubisoft may be working on another Splinter Cell game alongside the remake of the series' first entry; it's been a decade since Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Blacklist was released and two decades since the first Splinter Cell game hit the market.\n\nRegardless, Splinter Cell fans and those waiting to get a chance to play the first Splinter Cell games for the first time would be looking forward to such additions to the gaming industry.\n\nEverything We Know About The Splinter Cell Remake\n\nAside from it being made with a \"modern-day audience\" in mind, the upcoming Splinter Cell remake could \"keep the spirit and themes of the original [2002] game,\" while exploring its characters and the world they live in to make them \"more authentic and believable.\"\n\nAdditionally, gamers can expect visual and design updates that bring the original 2022 game up to speed with current gaming mechanics and trends, per Tech Radar. However, contrary to rumors, it would be linear and not feature an open world.\n\nWhile there is no news about the gameplay of Splinter Cell's remake, stealth will still be its main focus, with it featuring improved AI engagement that allows NPCs to improve how they react and what they're reacting to, per senior game designer Andy Schmoll in an interview with IGN."
