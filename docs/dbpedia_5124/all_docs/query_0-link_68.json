        "text": "Stealthy super-spy Sam Fisher makes his Nintendo DS debut in a packed Game Card that boasts not only a massive single-player game but also two wireless multiplayer modes! Awesome 3D graphics show off the power of Nintendo DS as you infiltrate enemy installations under cover of darkness and strike with deadly force using hand-to-hand techniques or an arsenal of prototype weaponry. Plus, use the Touch Screen to manage your items, toggle between different visors, hack computers and even pick locks. In the multiplayer mode, use the DSâ€™ local Wi-Fi connection to team up with a friend and work together in special cooperative missions, or go head-to-head in the two- or four-player Versus mode, in which Spies must hack terminals to steal vital data while Mercenaries must defend the data at all costs. (Multiplayer modes require all players to have a copy of the game.)\n\nWhat you need to know\n\nThis content is sold by Nintendo of Europe SE.
