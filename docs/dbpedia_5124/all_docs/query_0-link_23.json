        "text": "The Splinter Cell remake will be rewritten to be more relevant to a “modern-day audience”.\n\nA job listing for a scriptwriter spotted by PSU has revealed some details about the upcoming Splinter Cell game, and it looks as though it’s going to get a rewrite and update the original.\n\n“Using the first Splinter Cell game as our foundation we are rewriting and updating the story for a modern-day audience,” it reads. “We want to keep the spirit and themes of the original game while exploring our characters and the world to make them more authentic and believable.”\n\nLoading\n\nPlay\n\nSplinter Cell was originally released back in 2002 and introduced Sam Fisher – an NSA black ops agent who is investigating the disappearance of two CIA officers. As the story unfolds, Sam finds himself in the middle of a plot full of political intrigue as the world teeters on the brink of all-out war. It’s up to Sam to use his stealthy abilities to avert a global crisis.\n\nNow, it looks as though that crisis will have a more modern spin, although it's not clear exactly what form that will take.\n\n“As a Scriptwriter at Ubisoft Toronto, you will join the Narrative team and help create a cohesive and compelling narrative experience for a new audience of Splinter Cell fans,” reads the listing.\n\nLoading\n\nPlay\n\nThere’s been very little revealed about the project since the remake was announced last year.\n\nIGN’s Splinter Cell original review gave it 9.4/10 and said: “The incredible amount of polish, the sleek and developed presentation, the functional nature of everything, the satisfying twist in play that focuses on logically deciphered situations that need to be solved with a keen eye and common sense, and the sheer amount of style, panache, and coolness attached, make Splinter Cell a valid and worthwhile addition to every patient, intelligent gamer's collection.\"\n\nWant to read more about Splinter Cell?
