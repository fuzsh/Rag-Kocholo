        "text": "London, UK - February 9, 2005 - Ubisoft, one of the world's largest video game publishers, today reveals additional titles currently in development for the new Nintendo DSTM handheld console.\n\nAt the Nintendo DS European press conference, Yves Guillemot confirmed the release of Star Wars: Revenge of the SithTM this spring, and announced that a Nintendo DS version of King Kong, based on Universal Pictures' December 14, 2005 release, King Kong, from three-time Academy Award® winner Peter Jackson (The Lord of the Rings trilogy), is currently in development for release during the 2005 holiday season. Furthermore, this Summer Ubisoft will publish BombermanTM DS, from Japanese developer Hudson Soft Co., Ltd.\n\nIn addition, Ubisoft reveals today that its highly-anticipated stealth sequel Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell Chaos TheoryTM will also come out on the handheld platform later this year. Other games based on internal franchises will enrich the company's line-up in the future.\n\nThese titles join those announced earlier as official Nintendo DS launch titles: Rayman® DS, SprungTM and Asphalt: Urban GTTM. SprungTM and Asphalt: Urban GTTM, which has already sold well over 180 000 units, are currently available in the US and Canada, and Rayman® DS will hit North American shelves in March. All three will be in stores for the machine's European launch.\n\n\"Our full support of the Nintendo DS is clearly visible by the number of titles coming out with the launch,\" said Yves Guillemot, Chairman and CEO of Ubisoft. \"We are proud to offer one of the most diverse line-ups of any major editor.
