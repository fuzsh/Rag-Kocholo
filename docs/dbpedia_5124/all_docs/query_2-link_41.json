        "text": "Ubisoft is best known for popular titles such as Far Cry and Assassin’s Creed. While the company has mostly stuck to open-world design in recent years, there was a time when it experimented. Longtime fans of Ubisoft fondly remember its early success, Splinter Cell.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStarring the spy Sam Fisher, voiced by Michael Ironside, Splinter Cell was one of the most phenomenal stealth-action games of that time. However, its success can be attributed to a unique development approach, which wouldn’t work today.\n\nSplinter Cell Developer Opens up About Unique Development Approach\n\nTom Clancy’s Splinter Cell is still considered to be a legendary title when it comes to video games. The last installment arrived more than a decade ago. With Ubisoft working on a remake of the first game, it’s quite interesting to see how it all unraveled.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGame Informer sat down with one of the developers of the original Splinter Cell, Ed Byrne, and discussed the game’s production process, its initial design, sound, and idea, and how it was specifically crafted as a “Metal Gear Solid 2 killer.”\n\nSplinter Cell was the first serious game for Ubisoft Montreal, which had a name for making kid-friendly titles. The team was full of inexperienced youth back then. However, to overcome their circumstances, the developers opted for a multiple-directors approach.\n\nUnlike other games, Splinter Cell didn’t have a single director handling everything for the game’s development. The development team divided its direction into separate “packets” by pairing all level designers with environment artists, with a set of two tasked with making its own stage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe unique approach of having multiple directors onboard the project allowed Ubisoft Montreal to boost its efficiency and creativity. Developers were able to focus on several different crucial aspects of the game, such as gameplay mechanics, storytelling, and technical performance, which allowed them to develop a game that defined an entire genre.\n\nIt’s truly a surprise how the approach worked back then, as it simply can’t work in the modern gaming landscape. Due to the sheer size of video games such as Grand Theft Auto 6 and Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, multiple director approaches can hinder the entire development due to conflicts in key decision-making and game vision, which can lead to inconsistencies.\n\nIs Ubisoft Still Developing Splinter Cell Remake?\n\nIt feels like the Splinter Cell remake has been on its way for an eternity now. It’s been years since we last got a hint about the game. From what we’ve been hearing so far, the team behind the remake is going to rebuild the stealth game for all new audiences without heading away from the source material.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNews regarding the upcoming game has been few and far between, though fans got a small taste in 2022 as Ubisoft released a trailer for the Splinter Cell franchise, marking its 20th anniversary. In it, the developers confirmed that players could complete the upcoming title without killing anyone, allowing for more flexibility and a wider selection of gadgets.\n\nHowever, players’ concerns have reached new heights. Recently, it was revealed that Ubisoft Toronto, the division responsible for developing the Splinter Cell remake, is facing layoffs.\n\nAre you excited about the release of Splinter Cell‘s remake? Let us know in the comments."
