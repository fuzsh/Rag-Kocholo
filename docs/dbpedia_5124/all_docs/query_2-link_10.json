We assume the role of Sam Fisher, a federal agent and an operative of a secret unit within NSA (National Security Agency). The protagonist's task is to perform missions given to him by the agency, usually involving elimination of incredibly dangerous enemies, destroying documents, or infiltrating secret installations. Contrary to such series as Rainbow Six or Ghost Recon, where the emphasis is put on teamwork and commanding a unit, Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell focuses on controlling one character, making it more of a stealth game. There is no shortage of open confrontation opportunities in the title, though. In such scenarios, we can choose from 13 available weapons and other useful gadgets.\n\nPCPS2XBOXGBAGCN"
