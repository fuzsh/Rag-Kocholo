There is a lot of walking around and the action can seem clustered around certain areas of the level, but there is so much to hold your attention while you're on your way to the mission objective. Since even the easiest missions require you killing every terrorist on the level, that last guy lingering out there can be the biggest psychological threat. It's little mind games like this that make R6 such a treat. The mental tensions are made so engaging because of the little details in the sound, backstory and controls of the game. It all adds up to a tremendous amount of fun. The only thing that gets in the way is the game's length. Even with the bonus Eagle Watch missions and even after you've jacked up the difficulty to the highest level, R6 can seem to be not enough of a great thing.

On the box, you'll notice an \"E\" slapped there. E stands for \"This game is for Everyone.\" No it's not. This is probably the first Game Boy Color game that's tailored for a much older crowd. It's definitely not for the Pokemon Generation, with all the text, storylines, political situations, and troop micro-management. It's incredibly complex, too much for its own good. This game feels more like a project some designer wanted to take on as a challenge to see if it was possible to make an accurate, portable Rainbow Six. Don't get me wrong, this game obviously wasn't just thrown together. It really looks like a lot of time went into the development. It's just not a lot of fun to play.\">Reviewed by Craig Harris\n\nApril 14, 2000\n\nAh, the wonky ESRB rating. On the box, you'll notice an \"E\" slapped there.

Although this game isn't as revolutionary as Rainbow Six was when it hit the shelves last year and doesn't do much more than ride off of the laurels of its predecessor in the single-player mode, the game expands so much on the multiplayer aspect of the game that it has quickly become a favorite around the office at the end of the day.

The new weapons don't really do much to enhance the game, but there was already a substantial arsenal in Rogue Spear to begin with, so I really can't blame Red Storm for not including more. The graphics engine is definitely going to require a major overhaul in future iterations of the series too.

Viewed as a spin-off of, rather than as an addition to, the Rainbow Six series, Covert Ops Essentials easily does what it sets out to do - cater to hardcore fans with a little bit more of everything they've come to love from the product line. But the devil's in the details as well. Spastic players hoping for a full-fledged mission pack or campaign will find naught but a hefty handbook on field operations and a laughable smattering of new missions.

For others, it's a done deal at an even higher price. I'm somewhere in between, appreciating the solid gameplay and slick level design that made the core game so compelling, but I tend to think that $30 is a bit steep considering the quantity of additions here. It's definitely worth it for fans who are just craving more of that intense action found in the original game; had this been priced ten bucks lower, it'd be a much easier recommendation for the rest of us.\">Reviewed by Steve Butts\n\nMarch 10, 2004\n\nFor some, that's not enough to justify a thirty-dollar buy-in.

This game is a kick and a half. The fun of playing online and the addictiveness of Lone Rush far outweigh any lingering problems. It's better than the original, but then Ubisoft has had 10 months to crank this out. It's great to see four old maps brought over -- Peaks, Presidio, Garage, and Airport 1 -- but I wish Presidio and Airport 1 had not been altered. Some map changes to these old maps ruin the best conflict points. Only Peaks offers solid play for the new online modes, because the others are just too small for their own good.\">Reviewed by Hilary Goldstein\n\nAugust 5, 2004\n\nBlack Arrow has bugs and other minor annoyances, but that doesn't matter.

Outside of the cost issue, the content is pretty solid. You'll find that the classic missions and the new campaign won't last longer than a day, but the new multiplayer options are sure to extend the life of the title quite a bit. We'll have to wait and see whether or not the online community embraces the new modes but they definitely add a new level of interest to the multiplayer experience.\">Reviewed by Steve Butts\n\nJune 15, 2005\n\nWell, it's free.

The new gameplay mechanics, notably the intuitive cover system and inverted rappelling, are simply outstanding. While the visuals are solid, the textures and colors are muted and appear washed out.

Moving a squad around and using their various weaponry makes for some really gratifying moments in combat and made me want to finish Predator despite its other anger-inducing mechanics.

It’s a shame that humdrum maps and a poor matchmaking setup occasionally sours the promising designs of each class’ special abilities, but when it works, few free-to-play shooters grant such a memorable and thoroughly entertaining experience. Its relaxed approach to microtransactions mark it as a rare free-to-play shooter that manages to avoid the threats of paying to win, and with a few more visually distinctive maps, Ghost Recon Online could give its retail cousins a run for their money. For PC gamers in particular, it’s a welcome but flawed return to form for the popular franchise.\">Reviewed by Leif Johnson\n\nAugust 29, 2012\n\nWhile not without its issues, Ghost Recon Online is a fun and entertaining cover-based team shooter that rewards cooperation.

Your may get that familiar feeling, but that's certainly oodles better than that rot-gut anger you feel after downloading a stinker.\">Reviewed by Levi Buchanan\n\nApril 6, 2005\n\nChaos Theory is an excellent game -- there is no way to dispute that, even if you are a franchise veteran and you do indeed notice that the game provides relatively few new thrills. But the same thrills are thrills nonetheless. I've spent the last few weeks talking about the appeal of games that can be played with a single button. Chaos Theory is definitely not a one-touch game. It's complex, but Gameloft's control scheme and pacing compensate for the limited input of a handset. Gameloft rarely stumbles with their offerings, and Chaos Theory is no exception. When it pops up on your deck, download it. Your may get that familiar feeling, but that's certainly oodles better than that rot-gut anger you feel after downloading a stinker.\n\nReviewed by Levi Buchanan\n\nJune 16, 2005\n\nSplinter Cell Chaos Theory is easily one of the top three games for the N-Gage -- and it's probably the best of those three. Gameloft's attention to details specific to the platform pays off in spades -- games built from the ground up for a specific system just feel better. Better control, better level design, better graphics. And Splinter Cell Chaos Theory has all of these going for it, nevermind that's it's just a very compelling play. If you have an N-Gage and have just been itching to buy some MMC, make Splinter Cell Chaos Theory your top choice.\">Reviewed by Levi Buchanan\n\nJune 16, 2005\n\nSplinter Cell Chaos Theory is easily one of the top three games for the N-Gage -- and it's probably the best of those three.

But it's almost too complex for its own good; overwhelmingly complex control and an unsatisfactory framerate hurts the game design, but not so much that it makes the experience a bad one. Single player is far more satisfying than the multiplayer in the Nintendo DS rendition, which is a harsh 180 from the console's favored four player, two-on-two combat.\">Reviewed by Craig Harris\n\nJune 28, 2005\n\nIt's clear that Gameloft put a lot of time and energy into the Nintendo DS version of Splinter Cell; its presentation and use of touch-screen show that the team focused on bringing a unique Splinter Cell experience on the dual screen handheld.

The control scheme on today's phones are more conducive to \"one-button\" gaming. Splinter Cell Chaos Theory is not an easy game for beginners to dive into. The controls are unforgiving and it requires a lot more time than many mobile gamers are accustomed to committing to a title. But the achievement is still there. I think the revolution is still coming, but games like Splinter Cell Chaos Theory a"
