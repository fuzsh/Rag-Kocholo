        "text": "\"Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell,\" the game that had Xbox stealth-game enthusiasts drooling last year, has made the jump to PlayStation 2. And while it has changed a few things along the way, this hasn't changed it's still an excellent game.\n\n\"Splinter Cell\" stars Sam Fisher, voiced by Michael Ironside (\"Total Recall,\" \"Top Gun\"). Fisher is a Splinter Cell agent with the right to spy, steal, destroy and assassinate in order to ensure that American freedoms are protected. However, if Fisher is captured, the U.S. government will deny knowledge of his existence.\n\nThere are a few changes in the PlayStation 2 version, most notably a new exclusive mission in addition to the nine previous ones. The nine Xbox missions were shortened somewhat for the PlayStation 2.\n\nThe graphics don't look quite as sharp as they did on the Xbox, but they look awfully good for a PlayStation 2 game.\n\nThe game play is fairly simple to pick up. Fisher's movements are controlled by the left analog stick. Crouching is accomplished by pushing the circle button. Fisher is also quieter when crouched, and thus, will need to be in crouch mode for much of the game.\n\nMost of the other movements that Fisher will need can be achieved with a fairly intuitive series of button pushes. The tutorial will take the gamer through the movements needed, so the gamer won't have to learn on the fly. Even so, it will require some practice to execute the right moves at the right times.\n\nFisher has a wide variety of weapons and gadgets from which to choose, adding to the authentic Tom Clancy feel of the game.\n\nThe sound is good, with new intro music by the Prague Orchestra. The voice acting is good throughout. The sound effects are suitable, recreating the sound of weapons fire or the creak of a floorboard.\n\nThe game is heavily scripted, so replay value is minimal, but the experience is a good one while it lasts.\n\nUltimately, the new content in the game won't justify a purchase for those who own \"Splinter Cell\" on the Xbox, though they might enjoy renting it to try out the new levels and check out the other changes. But for PlayStation 2 owners who haven't experienced \"Splinter Cell,\" this is among the best military stealth games available for the system.\n\nThe game is rated T for teen, for blood, gore and violence.\n\nMatthew Price can be reached at mprice@oklahoman.com.\n\nArchive ID: 1300905"
