        "text": "Ubisoft will launch eight Nintendo 3DS titles in the first few months of the system's life, far more than any other game publisher, it said Wednesday.\n\n\"Ubisoft's creative teams have developed a rich and diverse line-up of games that take advantage of the amazing innovations that Nintendo has designed with its new handheld platform,\" said Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot in an emailed statement.\n\nThe games, including established franchises like Rayman and Splinter Cell, will all be available in the first half of 2011 following the 3DS launch in the U.S. on March 27.\n\nDescriptions of the games and screenshots, provided by Ubisoft, are below.\n\nRabbids Travel in Time (above, left): Rabbids are bwaaaaaack and this time they have an infallible plan to invade the human world: conquer history in their first platform adventure developed exclusively for the Nintendo 3DS.\n\nRayman 3D (above, right): One of the most popular franchises of all time lands on Nintendo 3DS with an outstanding platform experience that will take advantage of the Nintendo 3DS specifications with impressive graphics, stunning 3-D effects and full use of the Circle Pad. An adaptation of the acclaimed Rayman 2 original game on Dreamcast, Rayman 3D will feature major updates on key game play elements such as accessibility, progression and learning curve.\n\nAsphalt 3D (above, left): Developed by Gameloft and published by Ubisoft, Asphalt 3D brings all the excitement and speed of the Asphalt franchise to stereoscopic 3-D, featuring more than 40 licensed vehicles, 17 exotic track locations and complete StreetPass functionality.\n\nCombat of Giants Dinosaurs 3D (above, right): This 3-D take on the popular kids’ franchise mixes exploration and customization with real-time combats. Players ages 7 to 10-years old will be immersed into a cataclysmic universe and live the ultimate 3-D fighting experience.\n\nDriver Renegade (above, left): The first and exclusive action driving game on the Nintendo 3DS that lets the player experience the intensity and brutality of urban car chases in 3-D. Players will embody the Driver series hero John Tanner and use the accelerometer to unleash their urban driving skills.\n\nTom Clancy's Ghost Recon Shadow Wars (above, right): The first tactical, turn-based Ghost Recon game, featuring eye-popping 3-D cut scenes and in-game effects, deep team management options and a 1 vs. 1 multiplayer mode on the same console.\n\nTom Clancy’s Splinter Cell 3D (above, left): Sam Fisher is back in this masterpiece of the stealth/action genre, mixing the tension and realism that makes the essence of the franchise with unprecedented immersion and accessibility thanks to the stereoscopic 3-D and innovative controls of the Nintendo 3DS.\n\nJames Noir’s Hollywood Crimes (above, right): A brand new intellectual property developed exclusively for the Nintendo 3DS, James Noir’s Hollywood Crimes makes the player the main character in a mind-twisting puzzle adventure taking place in an interactive 3-D world, with 150 puzzles and mind games to solve.\n\n(Chris' note: Besides the fact that \"James Noir\" is a ridiculously stupid name on the level of Joseph Sports, I'm excited that Ubisoft is doing a bald-faced Professor Layton knockoff for the 3DS launch since the real thing won't be out in the U.S. for a good long while.)\n\nImages courtesy Ubisoft\n\nNBC Sent 27 Creators to Paris. It Only Needed Snoop and Olympic Athletes\n\nIn an attempt to lure in younger viewers, NBCUniversal sent dozens of social media influencers to the 2024 Paris Olympics. But the athletes and entertainers were the ones who went viral.\n\nThousands of People Are Playing Valve’s Secret New Shooter Right Now\n\nNo official details exist yet for Deadlock, the rumored 6v6 team shooter from Valve.
