        "text": "ŞÜKRÜ ILICAK\n\nhttps://a8inea.com/fatih-terim-giati-irthe-stin-ellada-o-adais-ntais-ton-gipedon/\n\nTranslation/gist: N.Mavromates\n\nAfter a series of agreements signed during Erdoğan's visit to Athens to ease relations between the two countries, we expected Turkish students and baklava companies to come to Greece. Instead, football coach Fatih Terim unexpectedly arrived. Given his record, let's hope Terim is not part of the reconciliation package between the two countries. I know next to nothing about football and cannot know what the Panathinaikos officials were thinking. However, the sudden arrival of the 70-year-old Terim, who has had a career full of extremes and has been retired for almost two years, strikes me as odd. It is also almost unlikely, for anyone who knows little about Turkey, to be unrelated to the recent fraud case bearing his name.\n\nIn recent months, Turkey has been rocked by a financial fraud scandal. The so-called 'Fatih Terim Fund' is a Ponzi scheme or 'pyramid scheme', as it is better known, with the protagonist - ostensibly - the lady manager of a bank branch next to the Galatasaray stadium. From this story of very famous footballers and businessmen who have fallen victim to their greed, an excellent film could have been made by the Coen brothers. With Terim's advice and blessing, and with extremely absurd promises (up to 300% interest!), they handed over several million dollars in bags without a receipt to the lady in question.\n\nOf course, the money has gone missing and seven people have already been arrested while investigations into the case are in full swing. The banker about whom Fatih Terim claimed to be \"as close to me as my daughter\" is on trial, with a possible prison sentence of up to 226 years. Every day new scandalous details are surfacing. And, as far as I read in the Turkish media, Terim's name is still not on the case file - neither as a victim nor as a witness. I guess this is something that can only happen in Turkey or in countries in the same 'league' as Turkey. Whatever certain people do, they have absolute immunity from the regime, as long as the mess doesn't end up touching the \"leader\".\n\nMurathan Mungan, one of Turkey's most important living poets, once said of the Turkish mentality: 'You can be anything in Turkey, but you can't be an embarrassment'. This is a phrase that is embodied in Fatih Terim. In any other country, his footballing life would have ended because of the incidents he had been involved in since the 1970s. However, because he is in Turkey, he is even called the 'emperor'.\n\nYou can read about his numerous incidents in the newspaper archives: manhandling or spitting in the referee's face, in another case knocking him down with his head, swearing at the referee and even being heard on live TV, threatening the referee in the dressing room after the match, kicking players, punching his opponent, being red carded but refusing to leave the stadium and challenging the stands before being forcibly removed by the police, swearing at children, breaking into nightclubs, breaking the head of a man who sent flowers to an actress he liked, fighting with a police officer and punching him, and much more.\n\nIt was written and said many times in the Turkish media that he was protected and saved by \"favored friends\" and \"secret hands\". Each time, even in the punishments inflicted on him, he 'went soft'. And he himself stated in his interviews: \"Nothing will happen to me. I have powerful friends\".\n\nWe know very well at least one of these hidden hands. Terim has never hidden the fact that he is the best friend of Mehmet Ağar, the deepest and darkest \"prince\" of the Turkish state. To give you an idea, Ağar was accused of the disappearances and murders of hundreds of people, mostly Kurdish dissidents, in the 1990s, when Tansu Çiller was prime minister, and was later jailed on charges of \"leading a criminal organization.\" There are also very serious allegations that Ağar is one of the major pillars of the cocaine trade in the Middle East. After the 2016 coup attempt, the exact nature of which is still unknown, Ağar's men once again filled positions in the security bureaucracy that had been vacated by the Gulenists. Despite all the lawsuits and allegations against him, he remained, once again, untouchable.\n\nTherefore, in my estimation, Terim is one of the symbols of the decline that has taken place in Turkey. He symbolizes the worst that has happened in the country in recent decades. He is an 'emperor' in the reign of ignorance, unable even to utter two words at once. The law does not apply to him. He is always right and always victimized when he is not a winner. It is always someone else's fault. The referee, the press, the owner of the kebab shop that set up shop next to his son-in-law's business... And, among other things, he has gotten a bad reputation for his excessive greed.\n\nYou don't need to be a clinical psychologist to diagnose that he suffers from multiple personality disorders. All you have to do is watch a five-minute interview with him. That doesn't mean he will fail on the field of course. But one particular trait that fans should keep in mind is that he always finds an excuse when he's struggling, creates unnecessary tension with management, quits and runs away on the first flight.\n\nAccording to the Cumhuriyet newspaper, Terim's bank accounts started to be examined ten days ago. I don't know if anything will come of this, but one can't help but wonder if Ağar's best friend advised Terim that it would be good for him to stay away from Turkey for a while until this case is covered. I guess one day we'll find out if this is just a football transfer or not.\n\nDid you also wanted to reduce the violence in the stadiums in Greece? With guys like this, good luck!\n\nPS. The accused lady banker's trial began today, 29/12/2023, and her statements about Terim have already started to be published in the Turkish newspapers. His departure from Turkey, four days before the start of the trial, is now looking more and more like an escape."
