        "text": "The prominent Turkish football expert Fatih Terim will continue his career on the Panathinaikos bench, Greek media reports.\n\nTerim will succeed Ivan Jovanović, who led the club since July 2021, on the bench of the Athens first league team.\n\nAlthough the management of Panathinaikos has not yet confirmed the change in the coaching position, Terim made a statement to the Turkish press.\n\n“It’s true, I made an agreement with Panathinaikos. We finished the talks yesterday, tomorrow I’m traveling to Athens, where the first training session awaits me in the afternoon,” said the Turkish expert.\n\nTerim’s last job was at Galatasaray, which he managed from 2017 to January 2022. He led the Istanbul club on four occasions, for a total of 13 years, winning eight Turkish championship titles and the UEFA Cup in 2000. He also coached the Turkish national team on three occasions, and also managed Milan and Fiorentina.\n\nPanathinaikos is currently in second place in the Greek Super League with a point less than the leading PAOK."
