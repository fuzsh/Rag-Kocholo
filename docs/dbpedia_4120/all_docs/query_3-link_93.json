        "text": "The long awaited Euros start today in France. Turkey will be participating in the Euros for the fourth time in its history, the last time being in 2008 when the team reached the semis and lost to Germany 3-2 after a great performance. Many domestic and international commentators see Turkey as a team consisting of a number of talented players: Arda Turan from Barcelona, Hakan Calhanoglu from Leverkusen, Caner Erkin who recently signed for Inter Milan, and the new big story, and the 18-year old Danish-Turkish winger Emre Mor who signed for Dortmund for 16 million euros a few days ago. Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has recently commented that Turkey might be the ‘surprise package’ and even go on to win the tournament. The head coach Fatih Terim ‘the Emperor,’ however, emphasized not the talent of his individual players as the primary strength of his team but an ethos he summarizes in a slogan-like manner: “It’s not over till we say it’s over.” (Biz bitti demeden bitmez). In a pre-tournament friendly against Montenegro, Turkey struggled to find the net throughout the game but managed to win with a last minute header from Mehmet Topal. After the goal, ‘The Emperor’ in a cool fashion turned sideways to the nearest camera next to the bench, looked straight into the camera, waved his pointing finger, and uttered the words with great clarity moving his lips slowly: Biz bitti demeden bitmez, he said, with a big smile, speaking to the national spectators at the other side of the broadcasting assemblage, sitting at home, watching the rather boring friendly game. The national team, Terim explains, wins by a spirit that refuses to give up, fights patiently to the end, and resuscitates itself the moment when the national and the international public too hastily declares it to be the defeated side.\n\nThat moment, when Terim did his rhetorical trick, many spectators were probably risen from a state of boredom into the realm of myth. Terim knew very well that he was forging a much bigger and powerful narrative than the celebration of a mediocre 1-0 friendly win over Montenegro. He was conjuring the collective memory of two past moments, the two previous “late come backs” in the near history of Turkey’s national football team. The first one is fresher in memories: the ‘last minute’ qualification for the Euro 2016 itself. Half way into the qualifying round for the Euro 2016, things were grim for Terim and Turkey. Having only won against the weak Kazakhstan in the initial 5 games of the group stage, the team stood fourth, but the third place, needed for qualification, looked far from possible. Then, the tide changed, and Turkey won 4 of its last 5 games, including wins against Czech Republic and Holland, clinching the third place in the final game, with a 1-0 win over the group winners Iceland after a last minute free kick goal. Terim decisively said “it’s not over till we say it’s over” at the post-match press conference that day, now speaking confidently against critics who wrote Turkey off half way into the competition. The second moment that Terim reminds the national public is the Euro 2008 campaign, the last time Turkey participated, when Terim was once again the national coach. After half time against the Czech Republic, Turkey trailed 0-2 in the final game of the group stage, and chances looked slim. The team, however, made an impressive come back, winning the game 3-2 to qualify for the quarter finals. What’s more, Turkey now faced Croatia in the quarters, scoring a 120th minute equalizer to take the game to the penalties and win there. The national character, Terim emphasizes, lies in this spirit of not giving up till the last minute, fighting till the very end even when the public opinion (read spectators) have already decided that Turkey are the losers. Today, as Euro 2016 begins, the slogan Terim created, a myth of a nation that resists defeat and pursues victory till the very end, not giving up, is the central theme of all commercials, television clips, and YouTube compilations that announce and celebrate the start of the tournament with Turkey among the contenders. NTVSpor, the major all-day sports channel in Turkey, uses the European newspapers’ headlines during the Euro 2008, especially after the come backs against the Czech Republic and Croatia, and depicts a second coming of a nation that resists defeat till the last minute and unexpectedly comes back to win at the last breath. Turkey is feared by its European rivals, in this framing, for their unexpected reversals of defeat, and persevering mentality: sonuna kadar savaş, fight the war until the end, many videos show players say the words. What a coincidence that Turkey is drawn in the same group against Croatia, and the Czech Republic in the group stage the very victims of these late come backs in 2008.\n\nThe theme of not giving up the war effort till the very last minute, beyond the moment when the international opinion agrees that ‘the war is over,’ is a fundamental theme in the construction of Turkish nationalism, a narrative taught in modular form to all students in elementary and secondary schools in Turkey. This is how the narrative goes: By the end the World War I, in October 1918, when the German Empire surrendered to the Allies, Turkey was deemed by the international community as a defeated state while in fact the mobilized army was not absolutely defeated in the battlefield. As we are all taught in school, “we were not defeated on the battlefield but diplomatically declared as defeated because Germany, our ally, was.” We had lost on the table by formality not by reality. And then, a young officer by the name of Mustafa Kemal went against the diplomatic efforts of the Ottoman government in Istanbul and decided to fight against the treaties signed by Istanbul as imposed by the victorious Allies. The heroic officer went underground, took a boat through the Black Sea to the Asian Minor, and organized a levée en masse against the Allies who started occupying Istanbul and other coastal cities as part of the Treaty of Sevres that sealed the Ottoman defeat. The war effort organized and led by Mustafa Kemal, the Turkish War of Independence, followed and gave birth to a new nation and a new state with a parliament in Ankara against those ‘traitors’ in Istanbul who bowed at the face of defeat and consented to the dismantling of Ottoman sovereignty over subjected minorities, the Armenians, the Greeks, and the Kurds. That is, just like the 120th minute equalizer against Croatia in the Euro 2008, the Turkish nation-state was born in extra-time after the international opinion was convinced that the Central Powers, and along with it the Ottoman Empire, has lost. Turkish nation-state was born as the negation of Ottoman defeat, transforming itself into a new name in the process. It was this extra-time war effort, surprising and shocking to the European public opinion, led by Mustafa Kemal from 1919 to 1923, that eventually established the Republic of Turkey, replacing the Ottoman Empire as a new member of the Society of Nations with which the Allies eventually agreed to cooperate. The version of the World War I that we learn in Turkey is one in which the war is not over till we say it’s over. It is this defeat-negating historic reversal, gained at the expense of prolonging the war effort, that is said to have rescued the Turks from the devastating Treaty of Sevres and won us the Treaty of Lausanne in 1923 – negating the claims for war crimes and reparations as well as for the establishment of an independent Kurdistan, an independent Armenia, and international control over the Straits and the Western port of Smyrna. Mustafa Kemal decided that it wasn’t over till the Turks said it’s over, and by motivating his troops to fight till victory against the Greek Armies, secured Turkey’s territorial integrity within the border we know today. Even the formal gains at the negotiation table at Lausanne were secured by the powerful exertion of Ismet Pasha, who is said to have broken the marble table at one stroke and survived with not a bone broken in his hand.\n\nThe ‘Emperor’ Terim is no foreigner to politics or history and knows very well the emotionally mobilizing power of the myths of nationalist historiography. A few days before the tournament, he invited the popularly known historian of the Ottoman Empire, Prof. Dr. İlber Ortaylı to give a small speech to the squad preparing for the Euro 2016. There the historian, known for his nationalist politics, lectured on the role of sports in raising the nation’s international prestige with a story of how he was greeted by an Italian in Puglia in the early 2000s, who, upon learning the visitor was from Turkey, passionately shouted “Imperatore,” referring to the head coach Terim who coached Italian giants AC Milan at the time. The aged historian told the young athletes of how in our modern times the sportsmen are as important as artists and Nobel Prize winners for raising national culture and its glory, reminding the historic status of the upcoming Euros while the Emperor Terim watched him speak in great pleasure. Beyond mere analogies between history and football exists some real patterns that shape Turkey’s football culture, though. Terim is the third highest paid coach of the whole Euro 2016 after the Roy Hodgson of England and Antonio Conte of Italy, perhaps the only coach to earn significantly more than the majority of the players under his management which is a rare distribution of power, money, and prestige in the current state of football where national coaches occasionally find it hard to establish authority over their high earning stars. The myths have power to shape reality, as is conventionally said, and Turkey’s national team is a very head coach oriented one just like national myths of history. It is impossible to find any major commercial video or a digital image of the national team where the Emperor does not appear as the almighty figure placed as the center of focus. Mass media regularly understates the role of individual player performances when reviewing games and loves to give the story of Terim the ‘great motivator’ who, with his rhetorical tricks like his small but clever message to the camera in the friendly against Montenegro, manages to unite the nation, the players and the spectators, improves the morale of the players, and silence cynical criticisms by ‘some sections of the media’ that are supposedly disrupting national harmony. That is, success and victory are represented and believed to lie in the figure of the Emperor much more than in an extremely talented group of individuals – there is no society without the state, yes it might be true, but Turkey seems to fear even the image of a social solidarity and cooperation that is not bound to the leadership of a strong statesman. As much as I might be repeating the out of fashion theories of Oriental despotism where individuality is given no place in society and subordinated to strong patriarchal leaders, this is because Terim and his loyal admirers themselves use this theory to justify and shape their actions and words. We are yet to hear our own version of Lehmann, the German goalkeeper who said that only after playing in Arsenal for a decade that he understood the futility of the concept of a ‘leader player’ that was so popular in Germany and that a good team might simply be 11 talented players who get along well, intuitively relate to one another’s moves, and play good football together. We have come a long way from the 1950s in Turkey when, as in England, the national coach was simply called ‘the single selector,’ which defined his function as not more than selecting the best players in the country. The commercial media, moreover, knowing very well the tested and confirmed formula of emotional manipulation, sticks to the same images and narratives over and over again – Turkey united under a strong leader, where national cohesion and the ethos of warring till the very last minute, not giving up, brings international victory and recognition. And just like the Treaty of Sevres, the starting point of the myth of nationalist birth, the march to the Euros always comes coupled with the image of a hypocritical and bad intentioned Europe – the insidious referee! – plotting to have Turkey lose. The persistence of this very effective myth is pretty difficult to explain without heeding to the power of nationalist historiography on Turkey’s fate and its history with European and especially British diplomacy that every student is taught to be the secret force digging a hole for the Ottoman Empire. Given the country has been a UEFA member for 55 years by now, having even had a Turkish president in the UEFA’s Executive Committee for years, that UEFA is so hastily mapped onto ‘the Europe we know’ is impressive, to say the least. The image of UEFA and the formal elements of competition – referees, draws, and all other formalities – never cedes to be associated with a potentially malign conspiracy: we are almost sure, even before the kick off, that UEFA will use every formal means there is to put Turkey in a disadvantaged position. Against this ‘English politics’ – my favorite idiom for the despised power of diplomatic cunning in the Turkish language – the nation, in order to win, will rely on something that is irreducible to formality – the ethos of fighting to the last drop of our blood and the courage to head the opponent’s kicks, two generic idioms players never forget to utter in pre-match interviews as a sign of soldierly loyalty.\n\nThere are infinite ways to win and lose and many ways to interpret wins and losses but the molds of criticism in Turkey, especially during these highly valued competitions such as the Euros, seem to repeat a well-established pattern: it is as if Turkey cannot achieve anything legitimately unless it is in the image of the War of Independence, the historical sequence from the Treaty of Sevres to the Treaty of Lausanne, victory won against formal disadvantage by the deeds of a warring ethos that negates formal limitations and takes the opponent to that final second where the decisive factor is not organizational or technical superiority but will, morale, and character: “it is not over till we say it’s over.” The more we interpret our achievements and failures using the established molds of explanation and national criticism, the more we seem stuck in the eternal repetition of a national fate that knows only one path to achievement, improvement, and recognition: war until the final whistle, unite to win, and never trust the referee. A path which, on the long run, never fails to fail."
