        "text": "You can’t really escape the glory of Galatasaray’s history when you visit their home on the north edge of Istanbul’s city centre.\n\nAs you emerge from the metro station attached to the Nef Stadium, large pictures of great moments in their history line the exit tunnel — there’s the 2000 UEFA Cup final, when they beat Arsenal; there’s Metin Oktay, their all-time leading scorer; and yes, there’s Graeme Souness planting a yellow and red flag into the centre spot of Fenerbahce’s pitch after the 1996 Turkish Cup final.\n\nThere probably won’t be any additions from this season to the wall of fame, though. Galatasaray, the most successful club in Super Lig history, the only Turkish club to ever win a European trophy and who only missed out on the title by one goal last season, are in the middle of their worst season in a generation, perhaps ever.\n\nGalatasaray are 11th in the Super Lig, 32 points back from runaway leaders Trabzonspor, closer to the relegation zone than the European places, never mind the top. This is an improvement too: at the end of January, they were three points off the drop zone.\n\nTo put this into some form of context, Galatasaray’s lowest-ever finishing position is 11th, which was 40 years ago. They have won the Turkish Super Lig 22 times since its establishment in 1959, the most of any club. They have finished in the top three in 51 of the division’s 65 completed seasons.\n\nThis sort of thing simply does not happen to Galatasaray. But it is happening, caused by years of imprudent management, the acrimonious departure of a legend, a nationwide financial crisis, an unpopular president and, depending on who you ask, a whole combination of other, wildly different factors.\n\nThis might not just be a blip, but the start of a new normal. The automatic dominance of not just Galatasaray but also Istanbul’s other giants Besiktas and Fenerbahce, who have shared 57 Super Lig titles between them, could well be over.\n\nBut it could also be the beginning of a more sensible time, of changing how a behemoth is run and turning Galatasaray into a modern football club.\n\nTalk to anyone about why Galatasaray have been so bad this season and most will sigh slightly before offering some variant of, “Well, there are lots of reasons.”\n\nThey did, after all, only miss out on the title by a single goal last term and if the season had lasted another week or two, their form was such that they probably would have been champions.\n\nBut this season has been the equivalent of the kitchen ceiling collapsing because you have not bothered to fix the leak in the bath directly above it. If it is possible for a league title to paper over the cracks, it would have done.\n\nThe first and most basic factor mentioned is simply that the squad is not very good, and last season’s close call was brought about more by a late-season wobble by eventual champions Besiktas than their own excellence.\n\nThe midfielder Gedson Fernandes, late of Tottenham’s bench, was viewed as the catalyst last term, but his loan signing from Benfica was not made permanent — for shrewd financial reasons, according to senior figures at the club. But of the players that were signed, only Bafetimbi Gomis’ arrival in January made much immediate impact.\n\nInjuries have been a problem, most notably club stalwart, goalkeeper and captain Fernando Muslera, who was hurt in December just before the most calamitous run of the season. Fans point to refereeing decisions but then again fans always do. Defender Marcao being suspended for six games for headbutting and punching team-mate Kerem Akturkoglu during a game did not help.\n\nAnd then there’s Fatih Terim. “The Emperor” isn’t just the dominant figure of Galatasaray’s last quarter-century but Turkish football in general. This was the fifth season of his fourth spell in charge, with eight league titles under his belt, and he remains the only manager to win a European trophy with a Turkish club. Living legend does not cover it.\n\nAll of that did not stop him from being sacked in January, after a defeat at home to Giresunspor left them in 12th, and replaced by Pep Guardiola’s former assistant, Domenec Torrent.\n\nDespite the bad results, the decision to sack Terim did not go down especially well. Most fans you talk to did not want him to go. A couple of games after he was dismissed, fans turned up to the stadium wearing Terim masks, some of which were confiscated by overzealous security staff. In the final minutes of the match (which Galatasaray lost), they chanted “Imperator Fatih Terim”.\n\nThe majority of the blame from the fans has been directed not at Terim but at Burak Elmas, the new president. Elmas was elected last summer by a relatively narrow margin (he beat second-place Esref Hamamcioglu by 41 votes), and the perception is that he has not delivered on the promises he made in his campaign.\n\nElmas pledged to reform the way the club is run, which will inevitably take some time so the fans have not seen the results of that yet, but more difficult to get around is Elmas’ promise Terim would be in charge for the whole three years of Elmas’ presidential term. Elmas was the only candidate who promised to work with Terim: the perception is that without using Terim’s name, Elmas might not have been elected.\n\n“Terim was dismissed by Burak Elmas in a scandalous manner,” says Emre Yilmaz, from fan group and YouTube channel Red And Yellow Wall. “His promises were important, but he failed to deliver them fully after he was elected president.”\n\nIt did not help that the club previously insisted that, while Terim was in charge, they had not spoken to Torrent, only to reveal later on that they had done exactly that. The Athletic understands that the proposal was for him to initially be Terim’s assistant, an attempt to fudge things slightly by keeping the legend and attempting to modernise simultaneously. “The main problem is not Torrent,” says Yilmaz. “It’s the process of Torrent’s arrival.”\n\nMetin Ozturk, who came third behind Elmas in the election, said recently: “The point they have brought us to is to rejoice in the defeat of Goztepe and Rizespor (two struggling teams).” Cutting. A man with an axe to grind, perhaps, but his views reflect a large portion of the fanbase.\n\nFrom the club’s perspective, the belief is that Terim’s methods belong in the past, a great man who the game has left behind, that in private he would agree with their attempts to modernise but then do and say what he wanted in public anyway.\n\nThey feel that this season’s calamity had been coming, with poor football despite the good results last season. The fitness of the squad was questioned too: some players approached the club hierarchy this season to suggest that they did not think training was up to scratch. “The team was not fighting (under Terim),” a club source told The Athletic.\n\n“Terim works in cycles,” says John McManus, author of the excellent Welcome To Hell?, a history of Turkish football. “His management style is so much based on personality and getting the most out of players, that has a shelf life. It felt like that was coming to the end of a cycle.”\n\nThere could be a spicy evening at the end of March when the next general members’ assembly is scheduled. The rumour is that Terim, who despite being sacked is still a Galatasaray member, is planning to address that meeting. If he does, he is unlikely to hold back. Technically speaking, Elmas could be unseated at that meeting, but it would require a complicated set of circumstances that have never happened before in the club’s history. Still, these are extraordinary times.\n\nTerim is frequently encouraged to run for the presidency, but The Athletic understands that he is weighing up coaching options, rather than administrative ones. That said, if he did run, he would probably win by a margin of roughly a billion votes.\n\nBut the biggest reason that Galatasaray are struggling is simple: money. They are creaking under the weight of their own debt. All the big clubs in Turkey are: by May 2021, the total arrears of Galatasaray, Besiktas, Fenerbahce and Trabzonspor was in the region of 17 billion Turkish lira: at the time, that worked out to around €1.7 billion. Galatasaray’s share of that was around €410 million. Not quite Barcelona levels, but still a hefty hole.\n\nIt was at that stage the government stepped in and, with the help of four large banks, ordered a restructuring of the debt and repayment programme. “Turkish clubs are no longer financially sustainable,” said Turkish Football Federation chairman Yildirim Demiroren. “Therefore, this plan has become compulsory for us to implement.”\n\nThe clubs have been given a couple of years’ grace to get themselves together, then they will have to repay the full amount over nine years. The plan was tweaked slightly a year ago, but the theory remained the same: to ensure all of the big boys are debt-free by 2030. For Galatasaray, that means paying back around 3.2 billion lira, which, thanks to the depreciation of the currency (more on that later), works out to a more manageable-sounding but still hefty €200 million.\n\nThe upcoming TV rights deal is a problem too. The present arrangement, signed in 2015, is worth in the region of €450 million a year. The new tender has not been signed yet, but the top bid is believed to be closer to €135 million.\n\nYou can see why people are worried. “It’s going to get worse before it gets better,” said a senior figure at Galatasaray. Throw in further financial fair play-related regulations, and the picture is not pretty. “The federation has us hooked by the right ball, and UEFA has the left,” another source familiar with the restrictions told The Athletic.\n\n“It’s not that these teams have been challenged significantly, it’s just that they have been poorly managed,” says McManus. “They know they won’t go to the wall — if they need to be bailed out by the government, they will be bailed out.” The clubs are too big to fail, but they are paying a hefty price for it.\n\nSo how did Galatasaray get here? Boiled down to its essence, it is the same reason any business or industry gets into financial trouble: for years, decades even, Galatasaray and the other big Turkish clubs have been spending more money than they have earned.\n\nA big part of that is spending on players. Your classic Turkish Super Lig signing was the expensive star, probably slightly over the hill or who had failed in one of the bigger European leagues. Didier Drogba, Wesley Sneijder, Claudio Taffarel, Gheorghe Hagi and Gica Popescu all line the Galatasaray hall of fame, while Roberto Carlos, Mario Gomez, Samuel Eto’o, Guti and a long list of other, less illustrious — but often not much cheaper names — have all beaten that path.\n\nThe party is well and truly over now. Mesut Ozil’s arrival at Fenerbahce last year is very much seen as the outlier, Ryan Babel’s €2.5 million salary will be off Galatasaray’s books when his contract runs out in the summer and although Besiktas have a few familiar names, the lavish statement signings are no longer worth the risk.\n\nRadamel Falcao was perhaps the final straw. He signed a three-year contract at Galatasaray in 2019 that started well enough, with a goal on his debut against Kasimpasa. But over the next two years, he missed almost exactly half the games he should have been available for through a slapstick variety of injuries. The occasion he collided with a team-mate in training and fractured his cheekbone was perhaps the nadir.\n\nBy the start of this season, his third, everyone agreed to write the whole thing off as a bad job and his contract was terminated. A senior figure at the club estimates the whole thing cost them around €25 million. The club knew they had to do things differently, but if anyone doubts the need for this new age of prudence, you just have to say one name: Falcao.\n\nThis was a consequence of a flaw in the structure of Turkish football. “These election cycles where presidents are remembered for winning championships rather than keeping the clubs on a good financial footing mean they’ve been badly run for a long time,” says McManus. Presidents generally have three-year terms, and it is safe to say that promising to tighten belts does not exactly make for a snazzy campaign slogan.\n\nStatement signings and the promise that trophies would follow became the model to follow. The problem is that the model involved spending way beyond their means.\n\nWe could be here for a while if we recounted all the ways that Galatasaray have wasted money in recent years. They paid £700,000 to the agent of a player who only made five appearances. When signing one player, five different agents came forward, demanding their cut of the deal. Over the last five years, the estimate is they have paid around £40 million to agents, which would put them roughly in the middle of the pack if they were a Premier League club. But they are not a Premier League club and do not have a budget like them.\n\nThese sorts of anecdotes are not especially unusual in top-level football, but you can think of them as the large pile of dry wood and paper, set alight by the flame of broader financial problems in Turkey — most prominently, that their money simply isn’t worth what it once was.\n\n“You can’t underestimate the impact of the currency devaluation,” says McManus. Ten years ago, you could get around 2.20 lira to the Euro, but by December 2021, it had tumbled to 18.60. At the time of writing, it is a shade over 16, and you do not have to be an economics ace to realise that is pretty bad news for a previously free-spending institution that does a lot of business abroad.\n\nThere are signs of life on the pitch, not least in Europe. It was one of the curiosities of Terim’s time in charge this season that they were mainly desperate in the league, but finished top of and were unbeaten in a Europa League group with Lazio, Marseille and Lokomotiv Moscow. That got them into the round of 16 against Barcelona, against whom the 0-0 draw in the first leg at the Nou Camp was entirely at odds with their domestic form.\n\nAlthough even that has been improving. They have won three of their last four Super Lig games, including a 2-1 defeat of Besiktas this week.\n\nThe team is fitter than before. Torrent introduced double training sessions when he arrived and has said that the first month or so of his tenure was essentially a pre-season, with the slight inconvenience of having to play competitive games among all the training.\n\n“When the coach first came, the average running distance in the team was seven or eight kilometres,” said Elmas recently. “It has now reached nine or 10 kilometres. There will be more improvements.” Torrent added, “When we arrived, the team was in a very bad situation, but now we are slowly coming out of that.”\n\n“I can understand now, what the plan is,” says Onder Ozen, former coach and now one of the more respected TV pundits in Turkey. “They play from the back, he uses the goalkeeper like Guardiola. Before Torrent, I didn’t understand Galatasaray. Nobody understood. Now, they’re a little bit more efficient. Torrent’s job is very difficult.”\n\nThat latter point is key. Whether Torrent will be given the time to see if his changes work, by an impatient fanbase and a sceptical media, elements of whom remain loyal to Terim, remains to be seen. “Torrent is like the stepfather your mother married too soon after your beloved father passed away,” noted one observer. “He may turn out to be a good guy, but you still have trouble liking him.”\n\nThe club insist he will be given time: a senior figure at the club told The Athletic that Torrent is their man for the long term, that his appointment was designed to change the playing philosophy of the club and that will inevitably take time.\n\nThere is a perception from the club that elements of the Turkish media and Galatasaray fans will not give Torrent a chance, charged with the crime of not being Terim. “He only thinks and talks about football,” says Ozen. “Never other things. This is the big difference between him and Terim. I respect Mr Terim, but Turkish football needs new ideas, new projects, new football language. Torrent has all of that. But I’m not sure whether fans, board members and the media trust him.”\n\n“Turkish fans and media will give you time if they don’t know you,” says Banu Yelkovan, a journalist for BeIN Sport and newspaper Hurriyet, “but then they will eat you alive.”\n\nChanges are coming off the pitch, too. Much like in England, historically Turkey has had a “manager” culture, which is to say one figurehead tries to do everything, from coaching the team to signing the players. Arguably no figure embodied that more than Terim, but now Torrent is happier concentrating on the training ground and leaving recruitment to someone else.\n\nThey have recently appointed Pasquale Sensibile, formerly of Roma, as their new sporting director, but arguably the smartest move has been introducing Luis Campos as a consultant. Campos is the man credited with building the Monaco side that won Ligue 1 in 2017 and went deep in the Champions League, and finding most of the Lille squad that did similar last season.\n\nMany of those players were sold for significant profits, a tactic that would be crucial to Galatasaray’s longer-term stability. That is what the business model of not just Galatasaray, but all the big Turkish clubs, is now. They are actively trying to find young, saleable players that will make everyone happy: ideally, those players would win silverware in Turkey, then be sold on to make the club more financially viable.\n\nGalatasaray will be sold to players as a place where reputations can be revived (think of Renato Sanches at Lille), and as a highly visible shop window. There is no real reason they can’t be another version of Lille or Benfica or even Ajax, clubs who have come to terms with their position as staging posts for talented players who need a competitive environment to prove themselves.\n\nThat process has started. The older players on big contracts, such as Babel and Sofiane Feghouli, will leave when their deals expire. They paid fees for seven players last summer: the 31-year-old Patrick van Aanholt was one, but the other six were all 24 and younger. Waste will be limited: they walked away from signing Gedson Fernandes permanently when Benfica’s demands became too much, and if a transfer involves dealing with more than one agent for a single player, they will do the same again.\n\nCampos’ fingerprints were also all over recent reports that Galatasaray are negotiating with Lille midfielder Xeka. The Portuguese midfielder had initially agreed a deal with CSKA Moscow, but after world events made him reconsider that move, Galatasaray have apparently swooped.\n\nThere will inevitably be some scepticism. They may have to sacrifice shorter-term victories for longer-term stability, which could make the hierarchy less popular. One senior figure called it a “battle between ignorance and boldness”.\n\nTurkish football is changing and Galatasaray are at the forefront of that change. The idea is it will no longer be the well-remunerated pseudo-retirement home it has long been perceived as. The road back will be long, and it might not be popular, but they are on the right track. Maybe one day soon, there will be some new pictures to add to that wall outside the stadium.\n\n(Top photos: Getty Images. Design: Sam Richardson for The Athletic)"
