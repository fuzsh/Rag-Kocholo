        "text": "Fatih Terim steps down as head coach of Panathinaikos after failing to secure the Greek Super League championship, citing misaligned plans with the club’s president\n\nFatih Terim’s time as head coach of Panathinaikos has come to an end as the iconic Turkish coach annonuced his resignation on Thursday.\n\nTerim revealed his departure through a social media post on May 17, citing differences in plans for the upcoming season with the club’s president, Giannis Alafouzos.\n\nUnder Terim’s management, Panathinaikos struggled in the Greek Super League, failing to secure the championship. The team’s decisive 4-1 loss to PAOK, coached by Razvan Lucescu, effectively ended their title hopes.\n\nThis defeat left Panathinaikos six points behind the league leaders with only one match remaining.\n\nIn his statement, Terim expressed his disappointment in not achieving the season’s goal of winning the championship.\n\nHe wrote, “Our aim was to complete the 2023-2024 season as champions and give the precious Panathinaikos fans a championship they had been waiting for 13 years. After evaluating the situation with Mr. Alafouzos last night, we concluded that our plans for the 2024-2025 season did not align.”\n\nTerim also thanked the Panathinaikos supporters, President Alafouzos, the club staff, and the broader football community for their support during his six-month tenure. “I extend my heartfelt gratitude to everyone who welcomed us in Athens, especially the Panathinaikos fans, President Giannis Alafouzos, and the club staff. I wish Panathinaikos all the best in the future.”\n\nThroughout his time at Panathinaikos, Terim led the team in 26 matches, achieving 14 victories, 6 draws, and 6 losses. Despite their efforts, Panathinaikos stands in fourth place in the Greek Super League with 71 points, trailing behind PAOK, who are set to win the championship."
