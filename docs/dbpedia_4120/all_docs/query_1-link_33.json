        "text": "Turkey searching for new head coach on road to Russia 2018\n\nFatih Terim departs after four years into his third spell\n\nTurkey to face other three sides in the top four in Group I\n\nTurkey are looking for a new manager to help guide them to the 2018 FIFA World Cup Russia™ after the departure of coach Fatih Terim. The Crescent-Stars, who are in impressive form after winning four of their last five games, currently occupy third in Group I on the road to Russia 2018 behind leaders Croatia and second-placed Iceland.\n\nTurkey face a crucial double-header in September's qualifying matches, first travelling to fourth-placed Ukraine, who the Crescent-Stars pip only on goal difference, before hosting table-toppers Croatia three days later. They then host Iceland on 6 October before finishing the Group I campaign away to already-eliminated Finland as they search for their first appearance at the finals since they finished third at Korea/Japan 2002.\n\nThe Turkish Football Federation (TFF) announced on Wednesday that they had parted ways with the 63-year-old, who was currently in his third spell as senior national team boss.\n\n\"Some non-football issues have been wearing out our football director Fatih Terim and the management of Turkish football federation,\" said the TFF statement. \"The two sides agreed that it would be more healthy for both parties to part ways.\"\n\n\"We would like to thank our valuable manager for his services to Turkish football.\""
