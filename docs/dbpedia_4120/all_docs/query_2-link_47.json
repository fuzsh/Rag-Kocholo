        "text": "ANKARA, Turkey — Turkey’s soccer federation says it has parted ways with national team manager Fatih Terim.\n\nThe announcement on Wednesday came weeks after Terim and his two sons-in-law were involved in a fight with a restaurant owner.\n\nThe Turkish Football Federation statement said Terim, 63, and the federation agreed that \"it would be healthier for both sides to part ways,\" saying non-football related issues were harming both Terim and the federation.\n\nIt also thanked Terim, who has headed the national team since 2013, for his services.\n\nTerim previously managed Galatasaray, Milan and Fiorentina. There was no word on who would replace him.\n\n[relatedlinks]"
