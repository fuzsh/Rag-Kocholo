        "text": "Hard work and passion are bywords for Turkey coach Fatih Terim as the \"Emperor\" closes in on his biggest throne - the top of European international soccer and ultimate professional recognition.\n\nTerim, a member of soccer royalty back home since his playing days for Galatasaray and the national team, of which he was also a captain, led Turkey through a tough qualification group to reach the tournament.\n\nEven when his team was almost out of contention, Terim, with his trademark unbuttoned white crisp shirt and Mediterranean tan, kept faith, telling Turkish media: \"We will qualify that's for sure. I know it.\"\n\nTurkey beat Norway away 2-1 in the penultimate qualifier essentially sealing qualification in spectacular manner.\n\nTerim has since seen his team come back to beat Switzerland and the Czech Republic in the group stage before stunning Croatia with a last-second goal to force penalties and move through to the semi-finals where the strong Germans are waiting.\n\n\"When we are together and united we can beat anyone,\" Terim said, testimony of his team's never-say-die attitude he himself has instilled.\n\nIn his second stint as national team coach, Terim, who also led Turkey to the tournament in 1996, has his eyes set on a much bigger target.\n\nTwelve years ago the fact that Turkey were playing in a major international competition at all after an absence of decades was already a success, going out in the group stage with three defeats.\n\nThis time Terim, known at home as \"Imparator\" - emperor - wants what he failed to get last time.\n\nAfter his Turkey spell, Terim returned to club football in 1996 and his beloved Galatasaray, winning a string of championships as well as the UEFA Cup in 2000, the first European trophy for a Turkish club.\n\nThat success landed him a job in Italy's Serie A with Fiorentina, before taking over Milan in 2001.\n\nBut what was seen at the time as the start of a glittering international career ended abruptly less than half a year later with his sacking.\n\nSince then Terim, a players' coach who treats them as soldiers going to war with dressing room speeches that range from battle cries to psychological warfare, has won nothing.\n\nHis second spell with Galatasaray ended in disappointment and mutual acrimony with club officials.\n\nNow Terim, 54, sees his team's success as a second chance for an international career that has eluded him.\n\n\"I told a group of Italian journalists only that I would like to work there again. That's all. I like the country and I have never hidden that fact,\" Terim told reporters a few days ago, after being quizzed about Italian media reports linking him to several clubs.\n\nEven if Turkey lose their semi-final to Germany, one thing is certain. He will enjoy cult status back home as the big European clubs shower him with offers fit for an emperor."
