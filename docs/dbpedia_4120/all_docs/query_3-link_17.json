        "text": "Although supporters are banned from Galatasaray's training ground, there's one fanatic, an old eccentric with a faraway gaze in a faded brown suit, who is allowed in to watch practice whenever he likes. He's a poet, and every day he picks his moment to overwhelm the sound of boot thudding against ball by orating stream-of-consciousness verse at the top of his voice. His odes are inspired by his favourite muse. 'Fatih Terim, Fatih Terim,' he starts up melodramatically. 'Emperor of Galatasaray...'\n\nAs figureheads go, Terim stands alone in Turkish football. He was already worshiped for breathing new life into the national team before he began casting his spell on the country's most exalted club. Galatasaray currently shine like never before. They are on the verge of their fourth successive championship. With the domestic cup in the bag and a European final next week, they have in their sights a treble that would send the club's 18 million supporters worldwide into unprecedented raptures. Tell him he's probably the most successful coach in the entire continent operating outside the superpower countries of Spain, Italy, England and Germany and he won't disagree. Strutting around in own-label leisurewear embossed by his ornate signature, he's as comfortable with his status as the main man.\n\nIt's sunset at the club's luxurious complex in the lush Florya district of Istanbul. Terim is sitting under the trees in the dappled shade sipping tea, his two grinning daughters rush over for a kiss hello, and he contemplates his lot. 'It's a nice life and we have had four years of success but I ask myself what more can I do? That's my way. One of my principles is to go further and further. No limits.'\n\nHe is ambitious, out of contract in the summer, and keen to broaden his horizons. AC Milan, among other European heavyweights, are keeping a close eye on developments.\n\nPeople constantly beg him to stay. He's an icon in these parts. 'He is the soul of the club, his influence is huge, he is simply number one,' gushes Gala's attacker Arif. 'He's like a father to us and a brother to us.' And an uncle, who has been known to pay the players from his own pocket when wages were late. And a godfather, who accepts no messing and no disrespect and acts accordingly if any rules are breached.\n\nHe has cracked it with his players. He has managed to get the balance between fear, trust, respect and love. They play for Terim as much as they play for themselves or their shirt. The relationship between players and boss works, he reckons, because he is young enough, at 46, to understand what makes them tick, but also experienced enough to guide them. They talk a lot, about life as well as football matters, and it has created a fantastic bond. Team spirit is one of their major assets.\n\n'All my players know if anything happens they must come and talk to me,' he insists. 'Personal problem, parents problem, wife problem, girlfriend problem, I have seen everything.' His penchant for talking, coupled with his immense confidence and charisma, has kept everyone on track during a bizarre season - on the one hand so thriving on the field, on the other so turbulent off it. In the aftermath of the Leeds incident some have forgotten that Galatasaray bore grief of their own. The Turkish earthquake was incredibly hard to come to terms with. Hakan Sukur's ex-wife was killed and Claudio Taffarel required therapy to overcome anxiety attacks.\n\nThe deaths of two Leeds fans in Instanbul dismayed and saddened Terim, an anglophile, because he found it so inexplicable. He has willingly performed the role of spokesman and diplomat and he will continue to do so as long as people demand soundbites, but inwardly he believes it is time to move on. Closing the chapter rather than stoking the fire would have been a better prelude to Copenhagen. 'But,' as he is fond of saying, 'what can you do?'\n\nMental fortitude, not a characteristic normally associated with Turkish football, has become a Galatsaray hallmark. This is the strongest Cim Bom team Terim, a stylish libero and captain here in his playing days, has seen. With influential foreigners like Hagi enjoying Indian summers and the Turks approaching peak it's the crest of a wave. It seems a summer exodus is on the cards. Sukur, rated by Terim as one of the most dangerous strikers in the world, is hotly coveted, as are Arif and the dynamic young Emre (suspended for the final).\n\nAt the moment Terim bullishly argues that anyone who doesn't want to play for Galatasaray can go. 'We'll build another team,' he retorts. 'There's only one type of person I don't like. If somebody says, yeah that's enough for me, I'm very angry. You must always be hungry.'\n\nThe other type he's not too keen on are ill-informed critics, who express surprise that his team, who have beaten the likes of Milan, Borussia Dortmund, Real Mallorca and Leeds this season, are so impressive. Surely they deserve more respect: 'Economically we are nothing, organisation is nothing, we have only five foreigners! My five cost maybe the same as one Bergkamp. No, make that one Vieira - Bergkamp is too expensive.\n\n'This is a big success for us, and a good chance to get more money, more foreigners, more success. It's an important time. We have to work hard to maintain this otherwise we'll end up with one final every hundred years, like now.'\n\nThey have been waiting for the go-ahead for a $110 million, 48,000 stadium for two years. They are $25 million in debt. Winning the Uefa Cup would bring more than glory.\n\nBut what glory if they do lick Arsenal. They are so consumed by the challenge they eased off domestically last Friday and lost at Altay when a point would have guaranteed the title. That has to wait while the romance of being the first Turkish side to grace a European final enthrals Instanbul. 'On the 17th of May life will stop,' predicts Terim, proudly.\n\nAnd he and his group of professionals might just join the party too. On the plane back from Leeds everyone was mystified to see the players quietly reading or listening to Walkmans. No celebrating yet. 'We were waiting. If we come back from Copenhagen with the cup we can do everything...' Only on the emperor's orders will festivities begin."
