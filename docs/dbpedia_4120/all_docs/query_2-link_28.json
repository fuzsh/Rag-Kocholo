Firat has worked in three Iranian clubs, namely Sepahan, Saipa and Gostaresh.\n\nLocal media reports suggest that Brazilian coach Sergio Ricardo de Paiva Farias, who won the AFC Champions League title with Pohang Steelers in 2009, and Italian Walter Zenga are on the list.\n\nAccording to the sources close to club, the new head coach of Esteghlal will be named on Saturday."
