        "text": "Collaboration between Panathinaikos and Fatih Terim ended abruptly on Thursday night, with the 70-year-old coach unable to fulfill his mission of leading the team to a title after fourteen years. Despite his legendary status in Turkey and past successes in European football, Terim’s tenure proved to be a mismatch for the club’s organization and environment.\n\n>Related articles\n\nSee Also\n\nSerious car accident in Nea Erythraia with one injured motorcyclist\n\nDuring his five-month tenure, Panathinaikos experienced a downfall, losing its identity and facing the risk of disaster, prompting the club management to take action. As a result, Christos Kontis, a former coach of Volos and a trusted collaborator of Ivan Jovanovic, will take over until the end of the season. Kontis, known for his success in returning teams to football normality, is tasked with restoring the team’s mentality and performance.\n\nFollow en.protothema.gr on Google News and be the first to know all the news\n\nSee all the latest News from Greece and the World, the moment they happen, at en.protothema.gr"
