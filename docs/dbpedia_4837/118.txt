Kentucky Derby Countdown | Chateaugay, 1963

The Courier-Journal is recapping Derby winners in reverse order heading into the 141st Kentucky Derby on May 2. Today: The 89th winner, Chateaugay (1963).

Keeneland’s Blue Grass winner Chateaugay swept to the outside on the far turn, picking off horses and wearing down front-running Never Bend in midstretch for a 11/4-length triumph. From Panama, Braulio Baeza became the first foreign-born jockey to win America’s most coveted race. Chateaugay, a son of 1955 Derby winner Swaps, paid $20.80 to win as the fifth choice in the field of nine.
