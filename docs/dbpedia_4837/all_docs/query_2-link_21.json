        "text": "Editor's note: Follow along for live coverage of the 150th Kentucky Derby.\n\nThe first leg of the Triple Crown, the Kentucky Derby, \"The Fastest Two Minutes In Sports,\" has been run at Churchill Downs in Louisville, Kentucky, since 1875. It usually takes place on the first Saturday in May (except for 2020, when it was run in September because of the coronavirus pandemic).\n\nOnly two Derby winners have broken the 2-minute barrier, Secretariat in 1973 and Monarchos in 2001. The morning line favorites hadn’t fared too well either, as only 40 favorites have crossed the finish line first since 1908, when pari-mutuel wagering was made available at the Derby.\n\nHere are the Kentucky Derby winners over the years, with the winning horse and the winning time in parentheses. Eventual Triple Crown winners are in bold.\n\nKentucky Derby winners list\n\n2023 - Mage (2:01.57)\n\n2022 - Rich Strike (2:02.61)\n\n2021 - Mandaloun (2:01.36)\n\n2020 - Authentic (2:00.61)\n\n2019 - Country House (2:03.93)\n\n2018 - Justify (2:04:20)\n\n2017 - Always Dreaming (2:03.59)\n\n2016 – Nyquist (2:01.31)\n\n2015 - American Pharoah (2:03.02)\n\n2014 - California Chrome (2:03.66)\n\n2013 - Orb (2:02.89)\n\n2012 - I'll Have Another (2:01.83)\n\n2011 - Animal Kingdom (2:02.04)\n\n2010 - Super Saver (2:04.45)\n\n2009 - Mine That Bird (2:02.66)\n\n2008 - Big Brown (2:01.82)\n\n2007 - Street Sense (2:02.17)\n\n2006 - Barbaro (2:01.36)\n\n2005 - Giacomo (2:02.75)\n\n2004 - Smarty Jones (2:04.06)\n\n2003 - Funny Cide (2:01.19)\n\n2002 - War Emblem (2:01.13)\n\n2001 – Monarchos (1:59.97)\n\n2000 - Fusaichi Pegasus (2:01.00)\n\n1999 - Charismatic (2:03.20)\n\n1998 - Real Quiet (2:02.20)\n\n1997 - Silver Charm (2:02.40)\n\n1996 - Grindstone (2:01.00)\n\n1995 - Thunder Gulch (2:01.20)\n\n1994 - Go for Gin (2:03.60)\n\n1993 - Sea Hero (2:02.40)\n\n1992 - Lil E.
