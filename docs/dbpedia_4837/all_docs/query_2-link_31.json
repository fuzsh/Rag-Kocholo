        "text": "The latest news, updates, highlights and insights from the 2024 Kentucky Derby.\n\nMystik Dan wins 150th Kentucky Derby\n\nMystik Dan is your winner of the 150th Kentucky Derby, winning in a photo finish by a hair over Sierra Leone and Forever Young. Mystik Dan entered the race with with 18-1 odds.\n\nThe underdog made up ground in the second half after the pack got off to a hot start with early leaders Fierceness and Track Phantom taking the pack through first half of the race in 46.63. The finishing order is 3-2-11-4.\n\nMystik Dan’s trainer Ken McPeek becomes the first trainer since 1952 to win the Oaks and Derby in the same year.\n\nGO FURTHER\n\nKentucky Derby: Mystik Dan wins in photo finish over Sierra Leone, Forever Young\n\nThe 2024 Kentucky Derby was an incredible event that somehow exceeded its hype\n\nHere’s what I learned about the Kentucky Derby today: It lives up to the hype and then some.\n\nIt’s a great event. The sound that comes from the grandstand as the horses make their turn towards home is something you can’t forget.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThorpedo Anna and Mystik Dan wore the same bridle to win their races\n\nThe press conference ends with the reveal that Thorpedo Anna and Mystik Dan wore the same bridle to win their races. McPeek says maybe they should auction it off to charity. “That’s a pretty lucky bridle. I gotta get back there and make sure nobody swipes it.”\n\nA Kentucky Derby love story\n\n“Years ago, when Lance and I were dating, he was late to pick me up because he was at the races. I wasn’t going to go,” says Sharilyn Gasaway. Why she’s glad she did? “I didn’t know but my mom knew he was going to ask me to marry him that night.”\n\nMcPeek says he felt sure they had won even with that photo finish, and then gets choked up sharing how it felt to turn to his wife who was standing there next to him to see it happen.\n\n'I was just smiling the whole time'\n\n“I was just smiling the whole time. It’s an amazing feeling when you have the horse under you and you now they’re gonna go forward and forward and forward.” Brian Hernandez reflects on how strong Mystik Dan felt throughout the race, from a powerful start with sure footing all the way to the finish.\n\nAn emotional win for Mystik Dan owner\n\n“To me, this is for him,” says owner Lance Gasaway, whose father passed away a year ago today. “Dad would’ve loved it, he loved the game.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThorpedo Anna and Mystik Dan were too fast for each other\n\nThorpedo Anna, the winner of Friday night's Kentucky Oaks, and Mystik Dan used to be training partners. But then they weren't anymore. Why? McPeek says they were too fast for each other and that you don’t want to push them over the edge.\n\nJockey jokes about photo finish wait\n\n“From the fastest two minutes in sports to the longest,” says Brian Hernandez with a laugh, referencing the long minutes of waiting to hear which horse won the photo finish.\n\nMystik Dan jockey reflects on race\n\n“Oh god, did we win the Kentucky Derby?” The thoughts on jockey Brian Hernandez’s mind the second after he crossed the finish line.\n\n“My horse was just cruising along so comfortably, it never felt like we were going that quickly. Other horses were piling up and we had a little pocket there. We may have taken a little off the inside fence but that’s okay,\" said Hernandez.\n\nMystik Dan, the 'old soul'\n\n“This horse is an old soul, he’s just so chill,” says Sharilyn Gasaway, one of Mystik Dan’s owners.\n\nNo Preakness guarantee yet\n\nTrainer Kenneth McPeek didn’t commit to running in the Preakness. Says he doesn’t make fast moves, \"never make a decision until you absolutely have to.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n'I believe in mojo'\n\n\"I believe in mojo,\" Mystik Dan trainer Kenneth McPeek said.\n\nMcPeek has praise for his jockey, too, not just the mojo. “This is typical Brian, he knows what he’s doing out there. We rarely second guess anything he does.”\n\nWhat happened to Fierceness?\n\nFavorite Fierceness ultimately finished in 16th, which put him below the alternate, Epic Ride, The offspring of Justified, Just Steel and Just a Touch (who a few people picked as the winner on the broadcast) finished in the bottom five.\n\nFierceness’ low finish probably took down a lot of exacta and trifecta bets where bettors paired their longshot pick with the 3-1 favorite. I’m sure we’ll get some answers later as to what happened with Fierceness.\n\nMystik Dan’s jockey still in shock\n\n“It still hasn’t sunk in,\" said Mystik Dan’s jockey Brian Hernandez. Hernandez hails from Lafayette, La., something Louisianans are very proud of.\n\n\"We have to thank all the guys back at the barn…. I don’t know how long it’ll take to sink in but it’s a surreal moment.\"\n\nFull finishing order\n\nHere is the full finishing order of the 150th Kentucky Derby. Fierceness, the big favorite before the race, finished just behind Epic Ride, who was a late add this week after a scratch.\n\nMystik Dan\n\nSierra Leone\n\nForever Young\n\nCatching Freedom\n\nT O Password\n\nResilience\n\nStronghold\n\nHonor Marie\n\nEndlessly\n\nDornoch\n\nTrack Phantom\n\nWest Saratoga\n\nDomestic Product\n\nEpic Ride\n\nFierceness\n\nSociety Man\n\nJust Steel\n\nGrand Mo The First\n\nCatalytic\n\nJust A Touch\n\nThe press is awaiting the winners. As are these hats and seats.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat was an expensive sip\n\nWoodford Reserve made only 150 bottles of the “Baccarat” version. One of those has been set aside for the winner, although it wasn’t clear when they would receive the bottle.\n\nThe Baccarat edition costs $15,000. You can get the regular 150 bottle (seen on the stage) for about $45-50 at your local liquor store.\n\nLoad more updates"
