        "text": "The biggest long-shot winner in the Kentucky Derby’s 149-year history was Donerail, who won “The Run for the Roses” in 1913 at 91-1 odds.\n\nA $2 win bet paid $184.90 on the horse after its half-length win at Churchill Downs over front-running favorite Ten Point.\n\nThe next four horses with the longest odds ever to win the Derby have cashed tickets for bettors in the 21st century.\n\nRich Strike (2022): 80-1\n\nThe second-biggest long shot to win the Derby was not in the field until Ethereal Road was scratched the day before, with Rich Strike being added from the also-eligible list. Kentucky Derby favorite Epicenter was leading and dueling down the stretch with Zandon when Rich Strike — the longest shot in the 20-horse field — came charging up the rail for a stunning upset by three-quarters of a length.\n\nHouston furniture store owner Jim “Mattress Mack” McIngvale lost $2.6 million in wagers on the race, including $1.5 million on Epicenter to win, that would’ve paid an estimated $12 million had the favorite prevailed.\n\nCountry House (2019): 65-1\n\nMaximum Security crossed the finish line first at Churchill Downs in 2019, but was disqualified for interference 22 minutes after the race. Country House, a 65-1 long shot who crossed the finish line second, was then declared the winner.\n\nA horse player at The Mirage racebook turned $8 into $78,000 when Country House was declared the winner. He hit matching $4 superfectas that paid $51,400 each ($39,000 after taxes).\n\nMine That Bird (2009): 50-1\n\nThe son of 2004 Belmont Stakes winner Birdstone had the third-longest odds in the 19-horse field. He had trouble out of the starting gate on a sloppy track and was eight lengths behind the rest of the pack before pulling away to win by 6¾ lengths for the longest margin of victory in more than 60 years. A $2 win bet paid $103.20.\n\nGiacomo (2005): 50-1\n\nThe big, gray colt won the 2005 Kentucky Derby by a half-length over Closing Argument, a 70-1 long shot. A $2 win bet paid $102.60."
