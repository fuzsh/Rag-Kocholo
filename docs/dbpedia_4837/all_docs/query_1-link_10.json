        "text": "Own a piece of prime horse racing history - the actual saddle Hall of Fame jockey Braulio Baeza wore while riding thoroughbred Chateaugay to victory at the 1963 Kentucky Derby. The same combination of horse, jockey and saddle also successfully competed in the Belmont Stakes that year... the only time that race was run at Aqueduct. Additionally,Baeza used this super saddle while winning the 1961 Belmont aboard Sherluck at 65-1 odds, preventing Carry Back from winning the Triple Crown. He also wore it in winning the 1961 Kentucky Oaks aboard My Portrait. During the '63 Derby, things didn't look too promising for Chateaugay, who was running in sixth place through the first three-quarters of a mile. Coming out of the backstretch, Chateaugay moved to the far outside and raced into fourth, and as they turned for home, Baeza spotted an opening between the second-and-third-place horses. He raced through it to pull alongside Never Bend and then moved ahead to win the race by 1.25 lengths. Baeza was the leading money winner in American racing from 1965 to 1969 and retired in 1976 after having won 3140 races in the United States. Over a half-century later, the saddle remains in EX condition and comes with an LOA from Baeza himself. A true treasure!"
