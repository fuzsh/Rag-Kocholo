        "text": "While the touted and much-deserving colt, Orb, took home the roses in the 139th Kentucky Derby, many New Yorkers understandably leaned toward Verrazano, the colt that won the Wood Memorial at Aqueduct in early April. They may be forgiven a somewhat provincial affection for a horse named for the bridge over the narrows linking Staten Island and Brooklyn, but the main span of that landmark structure across the gateway to the Hudson River and New York’s harbor hadn’t been completed in 1963 when another horse — one named for a small upstate New York town — led the field under the wire in the 89th Kentucky Derby.\n\nChateaugay, a chestnut son of Swaps, was bred in Kentucky by the Ohio sportsman and real estate magnate John W. Galbreath at his Darby Dan Farm in Lexington, Ky. Galbreath named the colt for the town and nearby Lake Chateaugay by the Canadian border where, years earlier, he was involved in post-World War II economic development efforts to help revitalize struggling small communities.\n\nGalbreath’s business success provided the resources for him to continue to indulge his lifelong love of horses and a quest that, by 1963, had become a 30-year effort to breed and race the finest thoroughbreds in the land. Chateaugay was Galbreath’s first Kentucky Derby entry and the first Darby Dan homebred to compete in a Triple Crown race.\n\nThe colt’s dam was Banquet Bell, a daughter of Native Dancer’s sire Polynesian, which made him a full brother to Galbreath’s champion filly, Primonetta. While not quite as precocious as his older sister, who was undefeated at 2, Chateaugay had notched two wins in five starts as a juvenile before embarking on the Triple Crown trail in early 1963.\n\nTrained by James P. Conway, who was known as Jimmy, Chateaugay made his way to Louisville, Ky., by way of a pair of victories in allowance races in Florida and Kentucky, respectively, followed by a win in the Blue Grass Stakes at Keeneland.\n\nChateaugay’s regular rider was Braulio Baeza, a solemn and slender, 23-year-old Panamanian who was instantly recognizable by his unfailingly upright, elegant posture in the saddle. Described by the renowned Sports Illustrated turf writer Whitney Tower as “wondrously gifted,” Baeza was as quiet and serious as he was capable in guiding a racehorse. He already had a Belmont Stakes victory to his credit, riding Sherluck to spoil Carry Back’s bid for the Triple Crown in 1961.\n\nI recall vividly that my late mother, who was a savvy observer of racing in New York, was a big fan of Baeza’s riding. I’m not sure if she admired him for his success on the track, his striking appearance on a horse, his quiet demeanor or all of those qualities, but she instinctively knew back in 1963 that he was a rider worth watching. So watch him we did as he piloted Chateaugay against a nine-horse Derby field that included two other impressive colts from the East Coast: the 2-year-old champion from Cain Hoy Stable Never Bend with Manuel Ycaza riding, who won the Flamingo Stakes at Hialeah, and Greentree Stable’s speedster No Robbery who’d won the Wood Memorial with John Rotz aboard.\n\nNone of those three horses had been defeated that spring, but lining up in the gate with them at Churchill Downs was Candy Spots, a solid California invader ridden by Bill Shoemaker. A flashy chestnut with unusual white markings on his rump and gaskin, Candy Spots was bred and owned by Rex C. Ellsworth, who also bred, owned and raced Swaps, the 1955 Kentucky Derby winner, before he eventually sold the horse as a stallion for $2 million — to John Galbreath.\n\nCandy Spots, who’d won both the Santa Anita and Florida derbies that spring, was the heavy favorite at post time in Louisville, with No Robbery as the second choice, followed by Never Bend and Patrice Jacobs’s Bonjour, winner of the Derby Trial. Despite his victory in the Blue Grass, Chateaugay was sent off as the fifth choice at 9-1.\n\nBreaking from the inauspicious No. 1 post, Baeza took Chateaugay back early in an effort to save something for the crucial last quarter-mile, while Never Bend quickly sprinted to the front. No Robbery quickly followed, and just behind that pair was an uncharacteristically unruly Candy Spots, who nearly ran up on No Robbery’s heels before Shoemaker was able to steady and settle him.\n\nThe order remained unchanged through the backstretch, but the maneuvering soon began as horses entered the far turn. The pacesetter Never Bend still held the lead, but No Robbery, who was known for bearing out in earlier races, began to tire, while Candy Spots remained in third.\n\nCruising along patiently with Chateaugay in sixth place, Baeza soon swung the colt to the outside on the turn. By the time the field hit the quarter pole, Baeza had shifted Chateaugay into high gear, deftly moving him between horses at the top of the stretch to take aim at Never Bend. Gradually wearing him down, Chateaugay drew clear of Never Bend by a length and a quarter at the finish, with Candy Spots, who never really fired, in third. On My Honor, a 30 to 1 long shot who had trailed the field, closed swiftly to nab fourth place from No Robbery, who faded to fifth.\n\nWith the victory on Chateaugay, Baeza became the first foreign-born jockey to win the Kentucky Derby. He guided the chestnut back to the infield winner’s circle, where the colt promptly showed his disdain for red roses, leaping and wheeling when attempts were made to place the obligatory blanket of flowers over his withers.\n\n“You never forget that,” Baeza observed when we spoke about his Derby-winning experience by phone recently. “He jumped around, but I stayed on. I wasn’t going to come off then!”\n\nDespite his antics, Baeza characterized Chateaugay as a kind horse, and the colt soon was shipped to Pimlico for the Preakness Stakes. Memories of that contest prompted the former jockey’s only expression of regret about his 1963 Triple Crown experience as he recalled the blistering one-mile workout Chateaugay had clocked just two days before the Preakness.\n\n“He got away from the rider,” Baeza lamented. “He wanted to run back to the barn or something. Mr. Galbreath wanted to know if the horse was hurt. He wasn’t hurt, but we told Mr. Galbreath he wouldn’t win. He already ran his race,” he recalled.\n\nBaeza added: “Since the horse wasn’t injured, Mr. Galbreath said ‘We’ll run.’ We ran, and he got tired, but we were second.”\n\nChateaugay finished three and one-quarter lengths behind Candy Spots, but the colt firmly redeemed himself three weeks later in the Belmont Stakes. Run at Aqueduct while the Belmont Park grandstand was being reconstructed, Chateaugay led Candy Spots by two and one-half lengths to claim two of the Triple Crown’s three jewels. With two more stakes wins added to his stretch of classic victories, Chateaugay was named the year’s 3-year-old champion.\n\nChateaugay continued to race at ages 4 and 5, but he never quite regained his earlier form. He was retired to stud at Darby Dan Farm, where he sired four stakes winners in his first crop as a stallion. In 1971, he became the first Kentucky Derby winner to be sent to Japan for stud duty. He remained in Japan from 1972 to 1985 and sired the 1981 Japanese 2-year-old champion, Hokuto Flag, before his death there at age 25.\n\nBaeza’s successful career continued through the 1960’s and early 1970’s as he rode numerous champions to victory, including Buckpasser, Dr. Fager, and Arts and Letters, with whom he won his third Belmont Stakes in 1969. The nation’s leading rider in earnings from 1965 through 1969, Baeza was inducted into the National Museum of Racing’s Hall of Fame in Saratoga Springs in 1976, but retired soon after, having amassed 4,013 winners during his 21 years in the saddle in Panama and the U.S. Now 73 and the only surviving member of Chateaugay’s Kentucky Derby-winning team, Baeza remains active as a racing official at Louisiana Downs and Hialeah Park.\n\nJimmy Conway continued to train for Darby Dan Farm until 1966, when he resumed operation of a public stable. Active in racing for 38 years until his death in 1984 from illness at age 73, Conway was posthumously inducted into racing’s Hall of Fame in 1996.\n\nJohn W. Galbreath died in 1988 in Ohio at age 90, but not before celebrating a second Kentucky Derby win in 1967 with Proud Clarion, another Darby Dan homebred. In 1974, Galbreath’s Little Current captured the famed Preakness trophy that previously had eluded him.\n\nDarby Dan Farm remains one of the country’s pre-eminent breeding farms under the leadership of Galbreath’s grandson, John Phillips, who continues to race homebreds with his family members under the Phillips Racing Partnership colors. Phillips characterized his grandfather’s reaction to Chateaugay’s Kentucky Derby victory as “an amazing and wonderful thrill that he shared with the entire family,” when we spoke by phone recently.\n\n“He loved horses, and, while he wouldn’t necessarily have put it this way, it really marked his ‘graduation’ into racing’s elite.”\n\nIt was a fitting accolade that could accurately be applied to all of those connected with Chateaugay’s decisive Derby victory.\n\nAs for my mother, her enthusiasm for Baeza’s and Chateaugay’s success took a more colorful and creative turn later that year, when she fashioned a very special Halloween costume for her then 9-year-old, budding-horsewoman daughter.\n\nWith riding breeches and boots, a black velvet-covered hunt cap, a dark brown turtleneck sweater and a pale pink — almost fawn-colored — sleeveless blouse all readily available in my closet, my mother cleverly layered the blouse over the turtleneck. On the left front panel of the blouse she applied the distinctive interlocked “DD” logo of Darby Dan Farm that she’d meticulously cut out of a patch of chocolate brown iron-on fabric.\n\nI’m sure the significance of my lovingly homemade costume that replicated the racing silks of that year’s Kentucky Derby-winning jockey was totally lost on the neighbors whose doorbells I rang that Halloween night in 1963, but my mother and I both knew it was all about Chateaugay – the horse named for that small town in northern New York – his stylish rider, and their big day in May."
