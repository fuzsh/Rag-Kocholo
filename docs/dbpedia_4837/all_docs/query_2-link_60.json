        "text": "In a photo finish, 18-1 Mystik Dan beat 9/2 Sierra Leone by less than a nose to win the 150th running of the Kentucky Derby on Saturday at Churchill Downs in Louisville, Ky. Forever Young finished just another nose back in what could be the closest three-horse finish in Derby — or Triple Crown — history.\n\nMystik Dan, whose handlers also won the Kentucky Oaks, held off Sierra Leone at the wire in one of the tightest Triple Crown races in history.\n\n“This is unbelievable,” jockey Brian Hernandez Jr. said. “The longest few minutes of my life. To see your number flash up to win the Derby, I don’t think it will sink in for a while. This is a lifetime achievement.”\n\nMystik Dan was first, followed by Sierra Leone by a nose, Forever Young at 7-1 by another nose, and Catching Freedom at 8-1.\n\n3-Mystic Dan paid $39.22 / $16.32 / $10.00\n\n2-Sierra Leone paid $6.54 / $4.64\n\n11-Forever Young paid $5.56\n\n$2 Exacta 3-2 paid $258.56\n\n$1 Trifecta 3-2-11 paid $1,113.84\n\n$1 Superfecta paid $8,254.00\n\nHere’s the complete order of finish:\n\nFierceness jumped out to an early lead with Just Steel and Track Phantom right behind, jockeying for position around the first turn where Track Phantom took control.\n\nIn the final stretch, Sierra Leone came from 14 lengths back to make a charge up front and Mystik Dan surged along the rail.\n\nHernandez and trainer Kenny McPeek had teamed to win the Kentucky Oaks for fillies on Friday with Thorpedo Anna.\n\nMystik Dan ran 1 1/4 miles in 2:03.34.\n\nGloomy skies and occasional rain drops gave way to blue skies and sunshine. The dirt surface was upgraded to fast a couple hours before the race after being muddy to start the day’s card.\n\nThe threat of wet weather dissipated as the day went on. Fierceness was holding as the 3-1 favorite, followed by Sierra Leone at 9/2. Forever Young, from Japan, was at 6-1, followed by Catching Freedom at 8-1 and Just a Touch at 10-1.\n\nNow that he has captured the first leg of the Triple Crown, his handlers must decide if he will run in the Preakness Stakes on Saturday, May 18, and/or the Belmont Stakes on Saturday, June 8. The Belmont will be run at Saratoga Race Course, due to renovations planned for Belmont Park.\n\nPayouts and complete order of finish will follow.\n\nFierceness was the 3-1 favorite. Trained by Todd Pletcher and ridden by John Velazquez, the bay colt broke from the No. 17 post, which had never produced a Derby winner. Fierceness won the Florida Derby by 13.5 lengths in his last race.\n\nSierra Leone was the second choice at 5-1. The dark bay/brown colt cost $2.3 million, making him the highest-priced runner in the full field of 20. He is trained by Chad Brown and was ridden by Tyler Gaffalione, who entered the race a combined 0-for-13 in the Derby.\n\nCatching Freedom was another top choice at 8-1. The bay colt is trained by Louisville native Brad Cox and was ridden by Flavien Prat.\n\nHere are the starting positions for the Derby:\n\n1 — Dornoch, 22-1\n\n2— Sierra Leone, 9-2\n\n3 — Mystik Dan, 18-1\n\n4— Catching Freedom, 8-1\n\n5 — Catalytic, 34-1\n\n6 — Just Steel, 20-1\n\n7 — Honor Marie, 15-1\n\n8 — Just a Touch, 11-1\n\n9 — Encino, SCRATCHED\n\n10 — T O Password (JPN), 48-1\n\n11 — Forever Young (JPN), 6-1\n\n12 — Track Phantom, 40-1\n\n13 — West Saratoga, 22-1\n\n14 — Endlessly, 48-1\n\n15 — Domestic Product, 27-1\n\n16 — Grand Mo the First, 48-1\n\n17 — Fierceness, 3-1\n\n18 — Stronghold, 35-1\n\n19 — Resilience, 32-1\n\n20 — Society Man, 48-1\n\n21 — Epic Ride, 47-1\n\nMORE SPORTS COVERAGE\n\nInjured Mets pitcher suffers frustrating setback: ‘Not sure’ what’s wrong\n\nLittle League World Series 2024 FREE LIVE STREAM: Southwest vs. Midwest (8/14/24) live stream, time, TV channels, date | Watch LLWS online for free\n\nYankees make Jazz Chisholm injury decision, call up former top prospect\n\nYankees’ Aaron Boone likes this plan to punish teams for Aaron Judge treatment\n\nLittle League World Series 2024 FREE LIVE STREAM: Asia-Pacific vs. Canada (8/14/24) live stream, time, TV channels, date | Watch LLWS online for free"
