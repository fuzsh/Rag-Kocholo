        "text": "It was only by a nose, but that was all it took for Mystik Dan to bring home a Kentucky Derby victory to southeast Arkansas.\n\nCo-owned by Star City farmer Lance Gasaway, Mystik Dan survived a late charge by Sierra Leone and Forever Young to win the first leg of horse racing’s Triple Crown at Louisville, Ky., on Saturday in a photo finish. Gasaway, a former wide receiver at the University of Arkansas at Monticello, is part of the 4G Racing ownership team, which includes his cousin Brent Gasaway, Brent’s wife Sharilyn Gasaway and Daniel Hamby III.\n\nMystik Dan, who had 18-1 odds coming into the Derby according to NBC Sports, paid $39.22 to win, $16.32 to place and $10 to show. Sierra Leone, the second favorite at 9/2 odds, paid $6.54 and $4.64 with a narrow runner-up finish, and Forever Young, at 7-1, paid $5.58 for third.\n\nBut the result wasn’t confirmed until Churchill Downs released an official photo of the finish. Mystik Dan’s nose reached the wire first, with Sierra Leone nearly beating him from the outside and Forever Young just an inch or so behind Sierra Leone.\n\n“We felt perfectly confident we got the win,” Lance Gasaway told NBC.\n\nMystik Dan jockey Brian Hernandez Jr., who won the Kentucky Oaks aboard Thorpedo Anna on Friday, probably sweated out the few minutes between the finish and final determination more.\n\n“That was the longest few minutes I’ve ever felt in my life, waiting for the name and number above us,” Hernandez told NBC. “It was exciting when we hit the wire, but I wasn’t sure if we won. It was a rush to sit here and wait for it.”\n\nThe win came on a pair of significant anniversaries. Saturday’s Kentucky Derby was the 150th running and also the first anniversary of the passing of Gasaway’s father, Clint, who was 85.\n\n“This is for him,” Gasaway said, hoisting the winner’s trophy. “He’s smiling down at us.”\n\nMystik Dan, the winner of the Southwest Stakes at Oaklawn Park earlier this year, was the 17th qualifier for the Derby based on a points system Churchill Downs uses, but drew the No. 3 post, close to the inside. He stayed near the front of the pack, close to the rail, for most of the oval, but charged out to about a 2 ½-length lead before Sierra Leone and Forever Young made their moves and narrowed the gap.\n\nThe next Triple Crown race is the Preakness Stakes in Baltimore on May 18, but Gasaway didn’t exactly commit to the challenge. The last horse to win the Triple Crown was Justify in 2018."
