        "text": "The Kentucky Derby stands as the pinnacle of American horse racing, showcasing the finest three-year-old thoroughbreds on the iconic Churchill Downs track in Louisville, Kentucky.\n\nThis prestigious event occurs on the first Saturday of May and is the highlight of the two-week-long Kentucky Derby Festival.\n\nThe race is famously known as \"the most exciting two minutes in sports\" due to its breathtaking pace and short duration, covering a distance of 1 mile. In 2024, the record time of 1:59:40 set by Secretariat in 1973 - the year he won the Triple Crown - will celebrate its 51st anniversary.\n\nThe Derby is not only a test of speed and agility but also of enduring legacy, often referred to as \"The Run for the Roses\" because of the rose garland awarded to the winning horse.\n\nThis competition is the first leg of the United States' Triple Crown of thoroughbred racing, drawing around 150,000 attendees to one of the world's most exclusive sports events.\n\nHistory of the Kentucky Derby\n\nKentucky's role as a crucial horse breeding hub dates back to colonial times, thanks to its vast pastures rich in calcium, which are ideal for developing top-tier racehorses.\n\nThe inception of the Kentucky Derby was influenced by Meriwether Lewis Clark Jr.'s visit to the Epsom Derby in England-an event first held in 1780.\n\nInspired by the prestige and tradition of the Epsom Derby, Clark returned to Kentucky and established the Louisville Jockey Club in 1872 to raise funds for building a top-notch racing facility on the outskirts of Louisville.\n\nThe track, known as Churchill Downs-named after John and Henry Churchill, who provided the land-officially adopted this name in 1937, though the first Derby ran as early as 1875.\n\nInitially, the race covered 1.5 miles, but this was adjusted to its current 1.25 miles in 1896. The inaugural race was witnessed by approximately 10,000 spectators and featured 15 competing horses.\n\n'Aristides,' ridden by African American jockey Oliver Lewis and trained by Ansel Williamson, had the honor of winning the first Kentucky Derby, setting a precedent for over a century of prestigious racing that continues to captivate and thrill audiences worldwide.\n\nWho are the Kentucky Derby winners?"
