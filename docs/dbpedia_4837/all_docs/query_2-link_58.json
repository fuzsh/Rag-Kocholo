        "text": "Michael Reaves/Getty Images\n\nThe 150th Kentucky Derby required a photo finish to decide the winner between three horses, with Mystik Dan (at 16-1 odds) finally getting announced as the victor.\n\nWith over 156,000 in attendance, the thoroughbred held onto a narrow lead over Sierra Leone (5-1) and Forever Young (6-1) across the finish line.\n\nFierceness (7-2) entered the race as the betting favorite, jumping out to an early lead at the quarter pole before falling behind down the stretch and eventually finishing in 15th place.\n\nKenneth McPeek, Mystik Dan's trainer, became the first trainer to win both the Derby and the Kentucky Oaks on the same weekend since 1952 after Thorpedo Anna emerged victorious at the Oaks on Friday.\n\nHere's the final race chart, finishing times, and purse for the 2024 Derby.\n\n2024 Kentucky Derby Finishing Time, Race Chart and Purse\n\nMystik Dan 2:03.34, $3.1 million\n\nSierra Leone (Nose) $1 million\n\nForever Young (Nose) $500,000\n\nCatching Freedom (1 3/4 length behind), $250,000\n\nT O Password (6 1/2) $150,000\n\nResilience (7 3/4)\n\nStronghold (12 3/4)\n\nHonor Marie (13 1/2)\n\nEndlessly (13 3/4)\n\nDornoch (18)\n\nTrack Phantom (18 1/2)\n\nWest Saratoga (22 1/2)\n\nDomestic Product (22 1/2)\n\nEpic Ride (23 1/2)\n\nFierceness (24 1/4)\n\nSociety Man (32 1/4)\n\nJust Steel (33 1/2)\n\nGrand Mo The First (36 3/4)\n\nCatalytic (40 1/2)\n\nJust A Touch (53 3/4)\n\nThe Derby contained a record-breaking guaranteed $5 million purse, with $3.1 million going to Mystik Dan. This surpassed the previous $3 million purse, which had been in place since 2019.\n\nMcPeek gave credit to jockey Brian Hernandez Jr. after the win, calling him \"one of the most underrated riders in racing\" although he acknowledged that the underrated label would likely no longer apply after the historic win on Saturday.\n\n\"Brian just did an amazing job,\" McPeek said. \"Just a brilliant, brilliant, brilliant jockey and ride. I mean, the draw helped us from the beginning. We talked about that.\"\n\nThe result went under review before it was declared official, causing some brief confusion regarding the winner. Hernandez called the wait before the official announcement \"the longest few minutes of my life,\" via the Associated Press (h/t ESPN).\n\n\"To see your number flash up to win the Derby, I don't think it will sink in for a while,\" Hernandez added.\n\nAfter the leader changed several times throughout the race, Mystik Dan surged to the front down the inner rail of the track before maintaining the lead down the stretch and just barely edging out Sierra Leone and Forever Young.\n\n\"When he shot through that spot, he was able to cut the corner and I asked him to go for it,\" Hernandez explained, per the Associated Press. \"He shot off and I'm like, 'Oh man, I've got a big chance to win the Kentucky Derby.'\"\n\nMcPeek was able to complete a career Triple Crown on Saturday after previously securing wins at the 2020 Preakness Stakes as well as the 2002 Belmont Stakes.\n\nCatching Freedom, a horse that entered the Derby with 8-1 odds, placed fourth while T O Password (47-1) finished at No. 5."
