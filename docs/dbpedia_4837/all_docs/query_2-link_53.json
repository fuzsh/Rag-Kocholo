        "text": "LOUISVLLE, Ky. — The margin was a nose but the smiles were a mile wide. In one of the closest finishes in almost 30 years, Mystik Dan won the 150th running of the Kentucky Derby.\n\nThe horse was generally overlooked by most but he ran a smart race on the rail and poked his head in front in the final strides to hold off Sierra Leone and Forever Young in the blanket finish.\n\nIt also completed a rare double for trainer Kenny McPeek and jockey Brian Hernandez, who also won the Kentucky Oaks on Friday with Thorpedo Anna. It was only the fourth time that has been done.\n\n“That was the longest few minutes in my life I’ve spent waiting for them to hang the dang number up,” Hernandez said.\n\nMcPeek was effusive with his praise for Hernandez.\n\n“Brian did an amazing job,” McPeek said. “He’s just a brilliant, brilliant, brilliant jockey. He’s probably one of the most underrated riders in the business. But not anymore.”\n\nRead more >>>\n\nMystik Dan won by less than a nose over Sierra Leone to win the 150th running of the Kentucky Derby at Churchill Downs on Saturday.\n\nMystik Dan entered the race at 17-1 odds. It was the first Kentucky Derby win for jockey Brian Hernandez Jr.\n\nForever Young finished third and and Catching Freedom was fourth.\n\nMystik Dan pulled ahead down the final stretch and was able to just hold off late charges by Sierra Leone, the No. 2 pre-race favorite, and the Japanese horse Forever Young, which finished a nose behind Sierra Leone.\n\nFierceness, the pre-race favorite at 3-1 odds, faded down the stretch and finished 15th.\n\nLOUISVILLE, Ky. — It’s really quite simple. If you’re in horse racing, regardless of your job or position, you want to get to the Kentucky Derby. But the reality is very few make it.\n\nPhil D’Amato has won multiple training titles at Santa Anita and Del Mar. He’s had 32 starts in the Breeders’ Cup. He’s missing only one thing from his rather impressive resume and that box will be checked Saturday when the gates open in the 12th race at Churchill Downs.\n\n“This is pretty much what I’ve worked my whole career to get to this point,” D’Amato said. “It’s been my dream to have a horse in the Kentucky Derby. And to finally achieve that, I’m still taking it one day at a time. I can’t really put it into feelings. And to be able to share it with my friends, family and owners, it’s just a good feeling.”\n\nWhen he talks about his “whole career” you are talking years, not decades. The 48-year-old Los Angeles native has been a head trainer only since 2014 when he took over the barn of the late Mike Mitchell. That’s not that long of a wait, unless, of course, you are the one waiting.\n\nRead more >>>\n\nTrainer: John Ennis\n\nJockey: Adam Beschizza\n\nOwner: Welch Racing\n\nPurchase price: $160,000\n\nLifetime record: 5-2-2-1\n\nWinnings: $253,166\n\nDerby points: 35\n\nLast race: Third in the Blue Grass Stakes\n\nMorning line: 50-1\n\nComment: Epic Ride got into the race when Encino was scratched. When that happens after the draw, it’s called an “also eligible.” Conventional wisdom would say that an AE can’t win the race. But, we’re only a couple years removed from Rich Strike, who also scratched into the race and won the Kentucky Derby at extremely long odds. He’s better than at least a handful of horses in the race. Four of his five races have been run on the synthetic surface at Turfway. He has got some early speed and may challenge for the lead. The question with a lot of these horses is if he has the distance.\n\nLOUISVILLE, Ky. — Even though all the attention is on the big race there are several major undercard races, some of which include horses from Southern California.\n\nPerhaps the best performance came from Formidable Man in the Grade 2 $600,000 American Turf, a 1 1/16 mile race for 3-year-olds. Trained by Michael McCarthy, the colt went to the lead and kept it all the way around before faltering in the stretch and losing by 1½ lengths to Trikari.\n\n“He ran very well, I’m very proud of him,” McCarthy said. “First time traveling, big crowd like this, the horse ran well and was a game second. … I thought he was too big of a number on the odds board (24-1), but he’s obviously a horse who is on his way up. [On the lead] is kind of where we wanted him. I told [jockey] Luis [Saez] to go ahead and put him in the game and I thought Luis rode him wonderfully.”\n\nInterestingly, the winning jockey on Trikari was Umberto Rispoli, who rides in Southern California.\n\nAnother Santa Anita-based horse who almost won was Vlahos, who finished third in the Grade 2 $600,000 Pat Day Mile. He led most of the race but got run down by Seize the Grey and Nash.\n\nHe is trained by Doug O’Neill and was ridden by Edwin Maldonado.\n\n“I thought I was going to be able to make the rail, but they pushed me outside,” Maldonado said. “He gave everything he had. At the eighth pole he changed leads on me. He was out of gas but he still kept trying. Heck of a race for a horse going a mile for the first time.”\n\nTrainer: Danny Gargan\n\nJockey: Frankie Dettori\n\nOwner: Reeves Thoroughbred Racing, West Paces Racing, GMP Stables, Carl F.

If this were a television movie the story would be about this 106-1 shot finishing second in the Wood Memorial. He goes to the Derby, picks up Dettori and magic happens. Well, don’t count on it. He is the only gelding in the race and has only one win, a maiden race just before the Wood. This will be his first race outside of New York.\n\nLOUISVILLE, Ky.— The odds haven’t fluctuated much with post time closing in. There has been $30.984 million pushed in the win pool, $12.137 million in the exacta pool (first and second) and $15.733 million in the trifecta pool (first, second and third).\n\nThere is also a superfecta bet, first through fourth, but it just doesn’t have the popularity of the trifecta. The super, as it’s known, only has $125,991 in its pool.\n\nAs for the favorites, it remains unchanged: Fierceness, Sierra Leone and Forever Young.\n\nHere are the odds with two hours to post time:\n\n1-Dornach 21-1\n\n2-Sierra Leone 5-1\n\n3-Mystik Dan 16-1\n\n4-Catching Freedom 8-1\n\n5-Catalytic 32-1\n\n6-Just Steel 22-1\n\n7-Honor Marie 13-1\n\n8-Just a Touch 10-1\n\n9-Encino (scratched)\n\n10-T O Password 47-1\n\n11-Forever Young 6-1\n\n12-Track Phantom 41-1\n\n13-West Saratoga 23-1\n\n14-Endlessly 47-1\n\n15-Domestic Product 28-1\n\n16-Grand Mo the First 45-1\n\n17-Fierceness 7-2\n\n18-Stronghold 36-1\n\n19-Resilience 29-1\n\n20-Society Man 46-1\n\n21-Epic Ride 44-1\n\nTrainer: Todd Pletcher\n\nJockey: John Velazquez\n\nOwner: Repole Stables\n\nPurchase price: Homebred\n\nLifetime record: 5-3-0-1\n\nWinnings: $1,703,850\n\nDerby points: 136\n\nLast race: Won the Florida Derby\n\nMorning line: 5-2\n\nComment: If he runs his race, he should win. And, based on past performances, if he doesn’t win he might not even hit the board. People are wondering if he is a “bounce” horse, meaning he runs great every other time. In this case, the Kentucky Derby is the “other” race. His last race was a 13 ½-length win in the Florida Derby. If jockey John Velazquez pushed him down the stretch, it would have been an even bigger win. Velazquez has won the Derby three times and is considered one of the best jockeys at rating a horse on the lead as evidenced by his win on National Treasure in the Preakness last year. It would be the first Derby win for owner Mike Repole, who sinks millions of dollars every year in buying horses, all in the hopes of winning the Kentucky Derby.\n\nTrainer: Victor Barboza Jr.\n\nJockey: Emisael Jaramillo\n\nOwner: Granpollo Stables\n\nPurchase price: $135,000\n\nLifetime record: 5-2-0-4\n\nWinnings: $214,650\n\nDerby points: 40\n\nLast race: Third in the Florida Derby\n\nMorning line: 50-1\n\nComment: Grand Mo the First needed some dropouts to get in the race. He hasn’t won in 2024 nor does he have a stakes win. His first two races were wins on synthetic turf at Gulfstream Park. He then went to Santa Anita and finished third in the Zuma Beach (where his dirt career started), leading to three consecutive third-place finishes. The colt was a distant third in the Florida Derby behind Fierceness. He does seem to find trouble whenever he runs. There is little to indicate he has what it takes to win against this field at 50-1 morning-line odds.\n\nLOUISVILLE, Ky. — Another $5 million was poured into the win pool in the past hour, upping its total to $24.378 million. Fierceness is holding steady at 7-2, a number he’s been at for the past six hours. Sierra Leone is second at 5-1 followed by Forever Young at 6-1.\n\nIt’s unusual to have swings of more than one point with this much money in the win pool, but there were two in the past hour. Just Steel went from 25-1 to 23-1 and Society Man dropped from 48-1 to 46-1.

His first four races were on the turf and the last two on synthetic. With that said, he has won five of six starts. His last race was the Jeff Ruby Steaks, which he easily won by four lengths. His trainer, Michael McCarthy, didn’t want to run in the Derby, but the owners did. Those that pay the bills often win those arguments. The horse also won the last El Camino Real Derby at Golden Gate Fields, which gives him an entry into the Preakness Stakes.\n\nLOUISVILLE, Ky. — Last year’s Kentucky Derby Day at Churchill Downs saw 143 horses enter the starting gate. Most will remember Mage, who crossed the finish line first in the world’s most famous race. But forgotten by all who didn’t known them were Chloe’s Dream and Freezing Point, who never made it to the finish line, who never made it back to their stall, who were euthanized after suffering life-ending injuries and were the sixth and seventh fatalities in 10 days.\n\nRacing continued at the storied track until the death count reached 12 and racing ceased at Churchill Downs on June 4, when it was moved to nearby Ellis Park for the remainder of the meeting. The Horseracing Integrity and Safety Authority (HISA) issued a 197-page report about the fatalities on Sept. 12. It was filled with charts and graphs and all the things they teach in presentation school. What it didn’t have was a singular reason for the rash of deaths.\n\n“It’s not like we didn’t uncover the causes,” said Lisa Lazarus, who runs HISA. “It’s that there wasn’t one singular factor that caused each of the fatalities. But we did learn a whole lot from the investigation and the data we’ve been collecting. With that we’ve been working very closely with Churchill Downs to enhance what was already a very rigorous safety protocol process.”\n\nRead more >>>\n\nTrainer: Larry Demeritte\n\nJockey: Jesus Castanon\n\nOwner: Harry L.

Larry Demeritte is only the fourth Black trainer to run in the Kentucky Derby since the Depression. He runs a small stable and has made only 14 starts this year. The horse has been busy, running 10 races lifetime. The road to the Derby started Sept. 16 with the Iroquois Stakes at Churchill Downs. West Saratoga won it by 1¾ lengths. There is not a lot to show he can run at this competition level, the same thing you would have said about Rich Strike in 2022.\n\nLOUISVILLE, Ky. — Before the seventh race the track condition was upgraded from muddy to good and then one race later it was upped again to fast, the top rating for a dirt surface.\n\nNo doubt, the lack of expected rain played a major role in the track’s condition. Both the track and the bettors prefer a fast track, but because there is not a specific machine that determines a track’s condition it’s left up to humans to give it a designation. So, these things are a judgment call.\n\nThrough the years, the track has been rated fast 104 times, good 11 times, muddy seven times and sloppy nine times. There are other designations, some of which aren’t used anymore.\n\nOnly three times in the 2000s has the track not been fast. It was muddy when Orb won in 2013, Justify won in 2018 and Country House won by disqualification in 2019.\n\nTrainer: Steve Asmussen\n\nJockey: Joel Rosario\n\nOwner: L & L Racing, Clark Brewster, Jerry Caroom and Breeze Easy\n\nPurchase price: $500,000\n\nDerby points: 70\n\nLifetime record: 7-3-2-1\n\nWinnings: $405,000\n\nLast race: Fourth in the Louisiana Derby\n\nMorning line: 20-1\n\nComment: Trainer Steve Asmussen is the best trainer to have never won the Kentucky Derby. It’s a statistical oddity that the all-time winningest trainer is 0-25 in the biggest race in the sport. It’s not looking good for a win this year. Track Phantom’s only style is running on the front, and he usually comes up short at longer distances. His three wins came at 1 1/16 miles, and he faltered when going 1 1/8 and 1 3/16 miles. He finished fourth in the Louisiana Derby. He is adding blinkers, which might be seen as a desperation move to get him to go longer. He did break his maiden at Churchill Downs.\n\nLOUISVILLE, Ky. — Barring a strange change in betting patterns, Fierceness will be the favorite in the 150th Kentucky Derby. Is that a good thing? The last five years the favorite has not won the race. The last one to win was Justify, who went on to win the Triple Crown, in 2018.\n\nIn the last hour, $4 million more was bet to win on the Derby. That number will grow with every hour until post time. The win pool is at $19.455 million. By comparison, the place pool (first or second) is at $4.383 million and the show pool (first, second or third) is at $4.386 million.\n\nHere are the odds with four hours to post time:\n\n1-Dornach 22-1\n\n2-Sierra Leone 5-1\n\n3-Mystik Dan 15-1\n\n4-Catching Freedom 8-1\n\n5-Catalytic 32-1\n\n6-Just Steel 25-1\n\n7-Honor Marie 13-1\n\n8-Just a Touch 10-1\n\n9-Encino (scratched)\n\n10-T O Password 48-1\n\n11-Forever Young 6-1\n\n12-Track Phantom 41-1\n\n13-West Saratoga 23-1\n\n14-Endlessly 48-1\n\n15-Domestic Product 27-1\n\n16-Grand Mo the First 44-1\n\n17-Fierceness 7-2\n\n18-Stronghold 35-1\n\n19-Resilience 29-1\n\n20-Society Man 48-1\n\n21-Epic Ride 45-1\n\nTrainer: Yoshito Yahagi\n\nJockey: Ryusei Sakai\n\nOwner: Susumu Fugita\n\nPurchase price: $729,603\n\nLifetime record: 5-5-0-0\n\nWinnings: $2,049,451\n\nDerby points: 100\n\nLast race: Winner of the UAE Derby\n\nMorning line: 10-1\n\nComment: This is the horse where people have the biggest difference of opinions. The conventional wisdom is that you automatically throw out a horse that comes from the Middle East because they are 0-18 in the Derby. But at some point a Japanese horse, usually running in Dubai or Saudi Arabia, will eventually win the Kentucky Derby. So is this the year? This colt looks pretty good as he is undefeated in five starts and won both the Saudi Derby and the UAE Derby. Before that he won three races in Japan. This will be the first Derby start for both the trainer and jockey. However, trainer Yoshito Yahagi has won two Breeders’ Cup races, both in the same year at Del Mar. The move from the 11 to the 10 gate means he went from being the first horse loaded to the last horse to go in the gate, so there won’t be a lot of standing around. The Derby uses a double-load system where two horses are loaded at the same time.\n\nLOUISVILLE, Ky. — The track was upgraded from sloppy to good before the seventh race. The rain has stayed away so far on Saturday and The Weather Channel has also dropped the rain chances into the teens. At 7 p.m., the time of the Derby, the chance of precipitation is now 10% with a temperature of 79 degrees.\n\nA sloppy track is one that is wet but has no standing water. A good track is one that has not completely dried out and is not as consistent as a fast track. Assigning a track condition is mostly noticed by handicappers but not that important to the general public.\n\nSome horses run better on wet tracks while others slip and slide and hate running in the slop.\n\nMystik Dan, running from the 3 in the Derby, won the Southwest Stakes at Oaklawn by eight lengths, so he would be looked at if the track were wet. And Sierra Leone, in the 2, won the Risen Star at the Fair Grounds on a sloppy track.\n\nTrainer: Phil D’Amato\n\nJockey: Antonio Fresu\n\nOwner: Sharon and Rick Waller\n\nPurchase price: Homebred\n\nLifetime record: 6-3-3-0\n\nWinnings: $827,200\n\nDerby points: 125\n\nLast race: Won the Santa Anita Derby\n\nMorning line: 20-1\n\nComment: When Encino was scratched, Stronghold moved from the 18th gate to the 17th, which has never had a winner in 44 tries. He got his first win in a maiden race at Churchill Downs, where he beat two other Derby horses, Resilience and Track Phantom. Given his somewhat light schedule there is a good chance we haven’t seen his best yet. He won a good stretch battle with Imagination in the Santa Anita Derby. This is the first Derby for both Phil D’Amato and Antonio Fresu. Just being the Santa Anita Derby winner gives you some gravitas, but his best race is not likely to beat the best race of Fierceness or Sierra Leone.\n\nLOUISVILLE, Ky. — Phil D’Amato is the only California trainer with a horse in the Kentucky Derby. It’s his first Derby, but will it be his last one as a California trainer.\n\nIt’s no secret that California racing is in distress with low purses, low attendance and a shrinking number of horses. Without supplemental gaming income the future is not very bright. In fact, Golden Gate, in its final days, has been scheduling racing only two days a week.\n\nD’Amato was at his barn on Wednesday talking casually to two reporters from California and one from Kentucky, mostly about Stronghold. He wasn’t trying to hint at anything, just answering questions.\n\nHe was asked about the future of racing in California.\n\n“I think everybody in California is worried about it,” D’Amato said. “But we’re all, at the same time, trying to work together to see if we can get it going back in the right direction. California definitely is a beautiful place to train, the weather’s great, [I was] born and raised there. So definitely, I would like to see California racing keep going.\n\n“At the same point and time, you’ve got to always look for the future. In Kentucky, these purses are incredible. So, you’ve got to always have your foot in the door over here to take advantage of all Kentucky has to offer.”\n\nFoot in the door, or out the door?\n\nLOUISVILLE, Ky. — Once again, no significant movement on the tote board as to who will be the post time favorite for the Kentucky Derby. Catching Freedom did tick down from 8-1 to 7-1, just behind Forever Young for the third favorite spot.\n\nFierceness at $2.776 million bet to win on him is the favorite and Sierra Leone is the only other horse with more than $2 million bet on him at $2.037 million. The total win pool has been going up about $2 million an hour and is now at $15.416 million.\n\nHere are the odds with five hours to post time:\n\n1-Dornach 22-1\n\n2-Sierra Leone 5-1\n\n3-Mystik Dan 15-1\n\n4-Catching Freedom 7-1\n\n5-Catalytic 32-1\n\n6-Just Steel 25-1\n\n7-Honor Marie 12-1\n\n8-Just a Touch 10-1\n\n9-Encino (scratched)\n\n10-T O Password 49-1\n\n11-Forever Young 6-1\n\n12-Track Phantom 40-1\n\n13-West Saratoga 23-1\n\n14-Endlessly 48-1\n\n15-Domestic Product 28-1\n\n16-Grand Mo the First 44-1\n\n17-Fierceness 7-2\n\n18-Stronghold 34-1\n\n19-Resilience 29-1\n\n20-Society Man 47-1\n\n21-Epic Ride 46-1\n\nA little after 6 p.m. on Saturday, Resilience will be pulled from his stall in Barn 19 and readied for the walk from the backside to the paddock at Churchill Downs. He’ll be accompanied by his trainer, Bill Mott, who will make the walk for the 11th time with his 13th entrant in the Kentucky Derby.\n\nAlso in tow will be owners Emily Bushnell and Ric Waldman, each making the storied stroll for the first time. But missing will be the person who made Resilience possible, who made Wall Street dreams for many probable and who, at one time, was the king of California thoroughbred breeders.\n\nMartin Wygod died in La Jolla on April 12 after struggling with lung disease. Emily is his daughter and Ric is his longtime bloodstock agent. Resilience was not an inheritance gift by Wygod, the horse was free.\n\nRead more >>>\n\nTrainer: Brad Cox\n\nJockey: Florent Geroux\n\nOwner: Qatar Racing, Resolute Racing and Marc Detampel\n\nPurchase price: $300,000\n\nLifetime record: 3-1-2-0\n\nWinnings: $281,700\n\nDerby points: 75\n\nLast race: Second in the Blue Grass Stakes\n\nMorning line: 10-1\n\nComment: He is a son of Justify, and like his father, did not run as a 2-year-old. In fact, next to the Japanese horse T O Password, he is the most lightly raced horse in the race. When speaking to the media, trainer Brad Cox lights up, showing his belief that the horse has a significant upside. He battled Sierra Leone to a strong second in the Blue Grass Stakes. He has never run a bad race, although he has run only three times. He’s also getting some interest from the wiseguy crowd (bettors).\n\nLOUISVILLE, Ky. — As the big race gets closer and the betting starts to increase, it gets more difficult to change the odds because there is so much money in the mutuel pool. The order of the top horses has not changed since the morning. Fierceness is at 7-2, up from his 5-2 morning line number. Sierra Leone is still 5-1 and Forever Young is 6-1. If Forever Young wins, he’ll be the first horse to win both in the Middle East and the Derby. He would also be the first horse bred in Japan to win the race.\n\nSo far, $13.019 million has been bet to win on the race.

But, he has been here before as an assistant for both Todd Pletcher and Chad Brown. The horse’s jockey, Ben Curtis, is also making his first Derby appearance. The colt has won twice over the Churchill surface, first in his maiden win and then in the Kentucky Jockey Club, a Grade 2 victory. He won’t be as far back as other closers, so you can probably expect to see him mid-pack before making his move. He might draw some interest from the wiseguy crowd (professional gamblers).\n\nLOUISVILLE, Ky . — The second most asked question at Churchill Downs on Saturday, right behind “Who will win the Derby?” is “Will Taylor Swift be at the Derby?”\n\nWhile this could be seen as a shameless attempt to get people to read this item, there is a bit of plausibility to the rumor.\n\nYou see, Travis Kelce is in Louisville and was hanging out with The Chainsmokers on Friday night. He plans to be at the Derby. Swift was doing a concert in The Netherlands on Friday, but she does have a private jet and she’s not scheduled to perform again until Thursday in France.\n\nWhether it is worth it to fly the almost 5,000 miles to see her boyfriend is a question that is currently unanswerable.\n\nBut if she does show up, will it be a bigger deal than when Queen Elizabeth II showed up at the Derby in 2007? Guess it depends on how you define “bigger deal.”\n\nLOUISVILLE, Ky. — It was a race that was over even before it started. There was a lot of speculation that Fox was trying to grab all the Triple Crown races, especially after getting the Belmont Stakes.\n\nBut NBC beat them to the punch and announced that the Kentucky Derby will remain with the network through 2032. The financial terms were not disclosed. The television rights for the Preakness, which is also on NBC, expire next year. The Kentucky Derby has been on NBC since 2001.\n\n“Telling the rich stories surrounding the Kentucky Derby on the first Saturday in May is part of the fabric of NBC Sports, and we are thrilled to continue that tradition with Churchill Downs,” said NBC Sports president Rick Cordella in a statement. “We look forward to surrounding the Kentucky Oaks and Kentucky Derby with wall-to-wall coverage and extensive promotion on the platforms of NBCUniversal.”\n\nNBC has assembled a smart group of analysts headed by Jerry Bailey and Randy Moss. It also uses part-time Del Mar race caller Larry Collmus to call its two Triple Crown races and the Breeders’ Cup.\n\nIt was thought that Fox wanted in the racing game in a bigger way, especially after buying 25% of NYRA Bets, the advance deposit wagering arm of the New York Racing Assn.\n\nOne of the more talked about betting angles is to look at what races produce the most Kentucky Derby winners. It’s no secret that the Florida Derby is by far the best predictor with 25 wins. Ray Paulick of the Paulick Report, in conjunction FanDuel, put together the list below.\n\nThe list of races and number of Kentucky Derby winners is supplemented with the horse that won it this year, only if they are in the race. If the space is blank, the winner didn’t make it to Saturday or the race no longer exists.\n\nFlorida Derby, 25: Fierceness\n\nBlue Grass, 23: Sierra Leone\n\nWood Memorial, 20: Resilience\n\nSanta Anita Derby, 19: Stronghold\n\nFountain of Youth, 14: Dornoch\n\nSan Felipe, 13\n\nArkansas Derby, 7\n\nLouisiana Derby, 5: Catching Freedom\n\nHoly Bull, 3\n\nHutcheson, 3\n\nJeff Ruby Steaks, 3: Endlessly\n\nRebel, 3\n\nRisen Star, 3: Sierra Leone\n\nRobert B.

Endlessly’s odds got bigger as he moved from 48-1 to 49-1. And Grand Mo the First climbed from 44-1 to 45-1.\n\nSo far, $10.133 million has been bet to win on the Derby.

The first race on Saturday had a sloppy designation. On Friday, it was muddy.\n\nThe different designations can be confusing. A dirt track that is in its best shape is called “fast.” It’s the preferable way that races are run. The next step down is “good,” which means the track isn’t fast, but it’s not terrible. If the rain is light or stays away, the track may get to good by the time the Derby begins. It would take magic to get to fast.\n\nThe next designation below good is “muddy,” which means that the track is wet but there is no standing water. The lowest designation is “sloppy,” which is given when there is standing water on the track.\n\nThere are two designations for the turf. The best is “firm,” meaning exactly what it says, and then there is “good,” which means the grass is in top form and might even be slippery. If it goes below that, the race is taken off the turf.\n\nLOUISVILLE, Ky. — Kentucky Derby 150, just like 149 and 148, will be run without trainer Bob Baffert, the most recognizable name in the sport, even to those who don’t follow it. And, for the first time, none of his horses were moved to other trainers, meaning the race won’t have all the best horses in it.\n\nThe overwhelming number of people who attend the Derby are not there to see a great horse race but attend an epic party with hats. But to those who do care about the racing, the sentiment of who is the villain and who is the victim may be shifting in the now three-year fight between Baffert and Churchill Downs.\n\n“It’s very split, you’ve got half the people who say keep the ‘cheater’ out, we don’t want him,” said Louis Rabaut, host of Rabaut & Co. on ESPN Louisville radio and co-host of the Horse Racing Happy Hour. “The other half is, ‘We want the best horses here.’ It’s been long enough.\n\n“Obviously it’s not the issues they are talking about anymore. I’m thinking last year it was about 80% that we’re glad he’s not here but this year it’s 50-50, that’s a big shift.”\n\nRead more >>>\n\nTrainer: Chad Brown\n\nJockey: Tyler Gaffalione\n\nOwner: Peter M.

But a lot of people will point to his race in the Blue Grass Stakes, where he wouldn’t go into the gate, holding up the start. His jockey said the crowd noise at Keeneland was bothering him. Well, Keeneland and Churchill Downs on Derby Day are two very different situations and not to his benefit. Another problem is he comes from behind, and in a 20-horse field from an inside post the situation gets even tougher. He needs a speed duel up front to have a chance in the stretch. All that said the $2.3-million purchase is the second favorite.\n\nLOUISVILLE, Ky. — As early betting starts for the 150th Kentucky Derby, Fierceness is the favorite at 3-1, just off the morning line odds of 5-2. Sierra Leone is second at 5-1. The surprise is the action that the Japanese horse is taking — Forever Young, 10-1 on the morning line, is 6-1 and the third betting choice:\n\nA horse that has shipped from the Middle East has never won the Derby .

There shouldn’t be any torrential downpours but the weather forecast does show intermittent rain throughout the day. On Friday’s Kentucky Oaks day the track was sloppy and some horses had trouble handling the surface.\n\nAccording to The Weather Channel, the first hint of rain should be around 3 p.m. ET when the probability of showers is 22%. It remains in the 20s the rest of the afternoon.\n\nSometime between 6 p.m. and 7 p.m. the sky goes from mostly cloudy to partly cloudy. At post time of 7:03 p.m., the temperature is predicted to be 79 degrees with a 22% chance of rain and a southwest wind of about 7 m.p.h.\n\nBut, it’s Kentucky in May and it’s the weather, so it’s really anyone’s guess.\n\nLOUISVILLE, Ky. — While all the attention is on the $5 million Kentucky Derby there are plenty of big races over the week. Next to the Derby in stature is the Kentucky Oaks, for 3-year-old fillies. It’s essentially the female version of the Derby.\n\nThe race was won by favorite Thorpedo Anna. She took the lead on the first turn, held on down the backstretch and pilled away down the stretch to win by 4 ¾ lengths over a track made sloppy by nearly day-long rain. The filly is trained by Kenny McPeek and was ridden by Brian Hernandez Jr.\n\nThere was a Southern California horse in the 14-horse race. Things didn’t go so well for Where’s My Ring, who finished 10th.\n\n“she didn’t break and I know for sure she didn’t like the track,” said trainer Val Brinkerhoff.\n\nYou could see the filly had trouble grabbing the dirt, almost appearing as if she was slipping on the surface.\n\n“She broke a little slow today,” said jockey Jose Lezcano. “There were a lot of horses that had speed. I tried to go [with them] but she relaxed. I got a little run from her in the middle of the race but she just finished even.”\n\nShe was running her ninth lifetime race. She ran her first race at Del Mar and then the next six at Santa Anita. Brinkerhoff shipped her to New York to run in the Gazelle Stakes where she not only broke her maiden but won by 4 ¼ lengths in a graded stakes race.\n\nShe’ll likely return to Southern California as they decide her next race.\n\nLOUISVILLE, Ky. — One of the most reliable indicators of how betting will go is what’s known as the “will pays.” It shows where bettors seem to be looking. The bet, in this case, is a $1 wager where you connect the winner of the Kentucky Derby. The payoffs are what the bet “will pay” now that you know who won the first half.\n\nWhat it tells us is that Fierceness should be the easy favorite, followed by Sierra Leone. The next tier of horses is made up of Catching Freedom, Forever Young, Just a Touch and Honor Marie. It also tells you that the “wiseguy” horse, or the longshot the professional gamblers are keying on, is Honor Marie, who was 20-1 on the morning line.\n\nHere’s a look at what a $1 Oaks/Double will pay now that it’s known that Thorpedo Anna (No. 5) won the Kentucky Oaks. Also remember that Kentucky has penny breakage meaning the result does not round off to 10-cent increments like it does in California.\n\n1-Dornoch $233.07\n\n2-Sierra Leone $25.99\n\n3-Mystic Dan $118.43\n\n4-Catching Freedom $51.47\n\n5-Calytic $447.33\n\n6-Just Steel $195.01\n\n7-Honor Marie $92.47\n\n8-Just a Touch $69.63\n\n9-Encino (Scratched)\n\n10-T O Password $433.24\n\n11-Forever Young $58.29\n\n12-Track Phantom $324.95\n\n13-West Saratoga $668.15\n\n14-Endlessly $307.34\n\n15-Domestic Partner $136.63\n\n16-Grand Mo the First $820.11\n\n17-Fierceness $16.68\n\n18-Stronghold $174.41\n\n19-Resilience $163.45\n\n20-Society Man $663.40\n\n21-Epic Ride $629.79\n\nRegardless whether you think this is Kentucky Derby 150, Kentucky Derby 150* or Kentucky Derby 149½, most of the animus around this year’s historic race will be forgotten, if only briefly, when the gates open at Churchill Downs on Saturday evening.\n\nSomewhere around 20 of the best 3-year-old horses in the world will be hoping to win the most famous horse race on the planet and cement their place in history and lucrative fees in the breeding shed.\n\nThe reason the race doesn’t have a full octane endorsement among the public is because not all of the best 3-year-olds will be running after Churchill Downs expanded its ban of trainer Bob Baffert, who has won this race six times. It’s hardly an argument anymore that Baffert is the best trainer of Derby prospects currently in the game.\n\nChurchill Downs banned him for two years after 2021 winner Medina Spirit tested positive for a legal medication banned on race day. The belief was that the ban was two years, but Churchill Downs left an out clause that said it could be extended. Despite no violations of any kind, Baffert was inexplicably banned for a third year because Churchill Downs didn’t believe he was contrite enough.\n\nRead more >>>"
