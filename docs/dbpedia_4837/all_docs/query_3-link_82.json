        "text": "Full Kentucky Derby Winners List by Year\n\nFrom the inaugural running of the Kentucky Derby in 1875 right up to the present day, we have all the winners in the tables below. We decided to split these into blocks of roughly 20-25 years, so you can view different eras as the race evolved into the must-see event it is today. All of the Triple Crown winners are in bold.\n\nLast 20 Kentucky Derby Winners\n\nIn amongst the latest successful horses in the Kentucky Derby, there are two Triple Crown winners in American Pharoah and Justify. Controversy both on and off the track has had a hand in recent editions. That has led to amended results.\n\n*Promoted to winners after first past post disqualified.\n\nPast Kentucky Derby Winners – 1984-2004\n\nDuring this period, no horse managed to achieve the Triple Crown. Back in 1988, however, Winning Colors became the last filly to win the Kentucky Derby. Her trainer D. Wayne Lukas would saddle three more horses to victory in The Run for the Roses in the 1990s.\n\n† denotes a filly.\n\nAn Era of Famous Kentucky Derby Winners – 1964-1983\n\nThe 1970s proved a modern era golden age for the Kentucky Derby, producing three winners of the Triple Crown in just five years. Secretariat is probably the most famous of those, but Seattle Slew and Affirmed both matched Big Red’s achievements to the track, even if they couldn’t clock such fast times.\n\n† denotes a filly, * promoted to winner after first past post disqualified.\n\nPrevious Kentucky Derby Winners – 1939-1963\n\nNo decade produced more successful Triple Crown bids than the 1940s. Each of Whirlaway, County Fleet, Assault and Citation got their shot at immortality off to the perfect start by winning the Kentucky Derby during and in the aftermath of World War 2.\n\nKentucky Derby Winners By Year – 1919-1938\n\nWhen we think of the 1930s, the time of the Great Depression, the Triple Crown concept became cemented thanks to the exploits of Gallant Fox, Omaha and War Admiral. They followed on from Sir Barton, the first horse to win the Kentucky Derby, Preakness Stakes and Belmont Stakes.\n\nList of Kentucky Derby Winners from the Early 20th Century – 1900-1918\n\nBack in 1915, Regret became the first of three fillies in Kentucky Derby history to win the big race. Although a successful Triple Crown bid wasn’t pulled off until after World War I, many Hall Of Fame talents and American Horses of the Year won at Churchill Downs.\n\n† denotes a filly.\n\nAll Kentucky Derby Winners from the 19th Century – 1875-1899\n\nThe earliest editions of the Kentucky Derby helped put the race on the map. But for its trailblazers, it would never have developed into America’s most famous horse race today.\n\nWhat Past Editions Mean for Kentucky Derby Winners Today\n\nIf there’s one thing Kentucky Derby results create beyond themselves, then that is trends. These are stats which, taken with other data, can help you find wagers on the big race. Trends come with zero guarantees, though.\n\nThey can help you if you want to know how to bet on the Kentucky Derby in an effective way. Info such as the final odds, performance of favorites, qualifying points and speed figures fit here too.\n\nOddsmakers from all the leading Kentucky Derby betting sites use data like this, along with results from prep races, to create prices. Trends can apply to horses making the show, but also just the winners.\n\nKentucky Derby Winners by Post Position\n\nLate scratchings after the final field is revealed can effect Kentucky Derby post positions and the draw. This is so there aren’t gaps between the horses jumping out the gates come race time.\n\nStats show a low draw doesn’t produce winners. No horse has successfully jumped out of gates 1-3 in the last 15 years, while gates 4-6 have only produced three successes.\n\nThree of the last six winners came out of gates 7 or 8, though. Five of the nine most recent successful horses came from a double figure draw. That is also the case for eight of the last 13 editions of the Kentucky Derby. A middle-to-high draw seems to give horses an advantage.\n\nTrainers & Jockeys\n\nThere are four active jockeys with multiple Kentucky Derby wins. These are Mike Smith, Victor Espinoza, Mario Gutierrez and John Velazquez. Eddie Arcaro and Bill Hartack share the all-time record for winningest jockeys in the race with five victories apiece.\n\nCalifornia trainer Bob Baffert ties Ben Jones by saddling six successful horses in the big one. Baffert is banned from having runners at Churchill Downs right now, though. Other active racehorse trainers with multiple Kentucky Derby wins are Doug O’Neill and Todd Pletcher.\n\nKentucky Derby Winners And Odds\n\nFavorties enjoyed a hot streak between 2013 and 2018 with the most fancied runner winning in all those years. Since then, however, horses with bigger Kentucky Derby odds have triumphed at Churchill Downs.\n\nLongshots have pulled off a couple shocks in recent years. Country House got promoted to winner in 2019 after Maximum Security was disqualified by stewards for causing interference. An even bigger outsider, Rich Strike, pulled off a massive shock in 2022.\n\nThe lesson here is that looking back over final odds can’t really help you bet on the Kentucky Derby. Favorites have won it before and will so again in future. Every now and then, a longshot turns up and causes an upset.\n\nFAQs\n\nWhat is the biggest winning margin in Kentucky Derby history?\n\nThe largest margin of victory in the Kentucky Derby is shared by four horses. All of Old Rosebud, Johnstown, Whirlaway and Assault won by 8 lengths.\n\nWho is the most famous Kentucky Derby winner?\n\nEach era has its famous winners, but you can make cases for both Secretariat and American Pharoah. Both went on Triple Crown successes. Secretariat set a record time for the Kentucky Derby, while American Pharoah also won the Breeders’ Cup Classic.\n\nHas a filly ever won the Kentucky Derby?\n\nYes, they have. Just three fillies are on the Kentucky Derby roll of honor. They are Regret, Genuine Risk and Winning Colors.\n\nIs there anything that recent Kentucky Derby winners have in common?\n\nNot really. The latest winners of the Kentucky Derby have all come from different barns. They have had different jockeys riding them too. The favorite hasn’t won the race since 2018."
