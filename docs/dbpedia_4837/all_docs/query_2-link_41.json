        "text": "Watch the full 2024 Kentucky Derby\n\nMissed the race or want to witness history again? Check it out in its entirety below.\n\nFull order of finish\n\n1. Mystik Dan\n\n2. Sierra Leone\n\n3. Forever Young\n\n4. Catching Freedom\n\n5. T O Password\n\n6. Resilience\n\n7. Stronghold\n\n8. Honor Marie\n\n9. Endlessly\n\n10. Dornoch\n\n11. Track Phantom\n\n12. West Saratoga\n\n13. Domestic Product\n\n14. Epic Ride\n\n15. Fierceness\n\n16. Society Man\n\n17. Just Steel\n\n18. Grand Mo The First\n\n19. Catalytic\n\n20. Just a Touch\n\nMystik Dan jockey discusses where the race was won\n\n\"Around the far turn, my horse was so game being up on the inside,\" jockey Brian Hernandez Jr. said after the win. \"I came through a really tight spot and we kind of climbed up on top of the rail a bit. When he shot through that spot and was able to cut the corner and I asked him to go for it, he shot off. I was like, ‘Oh man, we have a shot to win the Kentucky Derby.'”\n\nIt was Hernandez's first Kentucky Derby victory.\n\nTrainer Ken McPeek praises jockey Brian Hernandez Jr.\n\nMcPeek told NBC Sports that Brian Hernandez Jr., who led Mystik Dan to victory, \"did an amazing job.\"\n\n\"I mean, just a brilliant, brilliant, brilliant jockey in-ride,” McPeek said while still waiting for an official ruling on the finish from Churchill Downs. “Brian’s amazing. Probably one of the most underrated riders in racing. But not anymore.”\n\nHernandez was also elated by the win.\n\n“This is unbelievable,” Hernandez said, while still mounted atop Mystik Dan. “That was the longest few minutes I’ve ever felt in my life, waiting for them to hang that number up. ... It’s hard to put into words.”\n\nWatch the photo finish of the Kentucky Derby\n\nMystik Dan finished just ahead of Sierra Leone in a dramatic photo finish.\n\nMystik Dan wins Kentucky Derby\n\nMystik Dan took home the 150th running of the legendary horse race. He finished at 16-1 odds. Sierra Leone took second place.\n\nMoments away from the Kentucky Derby\n\nAll 20 horses are walking to the gate. The race will happen in exactly 5 minutes at 6:57 p.m. ET.\n\nSierra Leone is the best closer in the race\n\nSierra Leone is a deep closer; he prefers to sit far off and slowly rev up for one big charge. He stands to benefit if he has a hot pace to run into Saturday.\n\nFierceness, by contrast, has shown a desire to run at or near the front; a pace that heats up too much could doom him if he gets drawn into it. More modest early fractions, by contrast, should put him in a stronger position when the race turns for home.\n\nIt's almost go time\n\nIt's off to the races as they say.\n\n'My Old Kentucky Home' playing now\n\nFans of 19th-century hitmaker Stephen Foster should turn on NBC now for the timeless \"Old Kentucky Home\" performed by the University of Louisville's Cardinal Marching Band.\n\nThe official state song of Kentucky remains a popular feature of Derby Day despite growing discomfort with the the song's antebellum tale.\n\nWhile Foster's tune was composed to decry slavery, \"Kentucky Home\" has also been viewed as a romanticized telling of America's most disgraceful times.\n\nMy pick for the Kentucky Derby\n\nWhat I love is trying to find a long shot, and I’ve got my eye on one in particular. He has a running style that has fared well in the past, not contesting the pace but not sitting so far off it that he gets buried in traffic. His most recent race, the Arkansas Derby, was his best yet, and there’s reason to think he could improve further. He also checks both “final fractions” boxes, and his top Beyer speed figure is 95 — on the right side of the line, where just about every Derby winner this century has been.\n\nAnd, hey, I’m sentimental, too. His trainer is 88 years old, he has won four Derbies before, and he still heads to the barn in the wee hours of every morning in search of more. I’ll admit my heart is probably talking my head into this one, but the odds will be big and the Derby only comes around once a year, so why not? I’m going with D. Wayne Lukas and Just Steel.\n\nWest Saratoga presents good value for bettors\n\nNBC Sports' Al Bernstein says West Saratoga could present good value.\n\n\"Take a look at West Saratoga, the horse who was bought for $11,000. It’s an emotional story, as his veteran trainer (Larry Demeritte) has never had a horse this good, and he’s been fighting cancer in recent years. West Saratoga’s owner is one of those owners who is likely to buy horses at the tail end of a sale, after all the big buyers have gone home with their six-figure and beyond purchases. Harry Veruchi says he likes to buy horses for between $10,000 and $25,000, and West Saratoga was at the bottom of that range.\n\n\"West Saratoga has piled up enough points in the prep races to qualify for the Kentucky Derby, but these are deeper waters. Logic says he can’t get it done, but that’s why they run the races, where the unexpected and unpredictable tend to happen once in a while.\"\n\nNBC Sports, Churchill Downs extend partnership through 2032\n\nNBC Sports announced earlier today that it will continue to present the Kentucky Derby on NBC and Peacock through 2032.\n\n“As we celebrate the 150th running of the Kentucky Derby, Churchill Downs is proud to extend the relationship with NBC Sports,” Churchill Downs CEO Bill Carstanjen said in a news release. “As our media partner for the last 23 years, NBC has artfully captured the most exciting two minutes in sports and the spectacle of the senses that surrounds it.”\n\nHorses headed to paddock\n\nHorses just went round the track on their way to the paddock. The stands are filling up as we approach the call to post.\n\nLatest odds for Kentucky Derby\n\nFierceness, Sierra Leone and Forever Young remain the favorites 20 minutes prior to the race.\n\nJayson Werth 'living the dream and breathing it all in'\n\nEven though he's played on baseball's biggest stages, former MLB outfielder Jayson Werth said those diamonds don't match the Kentucky Derby.\n\n\"This is the biggest event in probably all of sports,\" he told NBC Sports duiring the Derby walkover. \"It's a little overwhelming, it's a little hectic, it's a little nerve wracking. But we're here nonetheness. \"\n\nThe 10% owner of No. 1 Dornoch said he understands the long odds his horse beat just to make it to Churchill Downs on the first Saturday of May\n\n\"We're just living the dream and breathing it all in right now,\" said Werth, a member of the 2008 World Series champion Philadelphia Phillies.\n\nFavorites for a reason\n\nIn a field as big as the Derby — 20 horses, easily the most that will run in a major race in the U.S. this year — it’s natural to expect chaos and to look for a long shot that’ll blow up your bank account for only a small investment.\n\nAnd, certainly, we’ve witnessed some massive Derby upsets; who among us doesn’t wish they’d plopped down a few bucks on Rich Strike at 80-1 two years ago?\n\nBut as thrilling as the Rich Strikes are, they’re also rare. In horse racing, favorites win around 35% of all races run across the country in a given year.\n\nHow much does it cost to run a horse in the Kentucky Derby?\n\nIt could range from tens of thousands all the way up to $4 million to run a horse in the Derby.\n\nThe average cost from the 2023 Kentucky Derby field was approximately $446,000.

There is also a clear view of the Twin Spires.\n\nChurchill Downs spokesman Darren Rogers told NBC Los Angeles that the paddock area added 3,600 new seats and standing room for 3,200.\n\nHow much does the winning horse bring in?\n\nThe winner of Saturday's Kentucky Derby brings in a whopping $3.1 million.

A Minion, from the popular \"Despicable Me\" franchise. (\"Despicable Me 4\" rolls out in theaters in July.) The Minions' official account promoted the Derby with a post, featuring an image of the yellow cartoon character. \"The odds just got odder,\" the caption read.\n\nUniversal Pictures also had a Minion on-site at the Derby. NBC Sports reported the on-site Minion was Kevin.\n\nCelebrities love the Derby\n\nEvery year, the Derby draws in a lot of A-listers (a mix of celebrities, athletes and musicians) who flock to Kentucky to catch the race and check out the parties.\n\nAmong the biggest parties? The Barnstable Brown Gala, which took place on Friday. Hosted by Louisville native Patricia Barnstable Brown, the gala raises money for diabetes research and support for the University of Kentucky’s Barnstable Brown Diabetes Center. This year's guest list reportedly included Kid Rock, Aaron Rodgers, Tracy Morgan, Josh Groban, Sheryl Lee Ralph, Smokey Robinson, Jack Harlow and many others.

But as most onlookers know, it's also very much a big day for hats. Today, you'll see attendees sporting large, lavish hats that are decorated with everything from ribbons to fascinators.\n\nKentucky Derby Museum curator Chris Goodlett told NBC News' Philadelphia affiliate that the hat-wearing tradition is as old as the race itself.\n\n“The presence of ladies in the grandstand added great splendor to the racing scene,” Goodlett told the outlet. “News articles in 1875 make reference to the dress of the ladies, with specific mention of hats.”\n\nFierceness is a boom-or-bust favorite\n\nThis year’s favorite, Fierceness, enters the Derby with a peculiar track record. He has won three previous races in absolutely dominating fashion, by a combined total of 31 lengths.\n\nBut his two other races have been total clunkers: a 20 ¼-length seventh-place finish in last fall’s Champagne Stakes and a baffling third-place finish (as the 1-5 favorite against suspect competition) in February’s Holy Bull Stakes. Many see Fierceness as the ultimate boom-or-bust horse — one who either wins with ease or loses in a rout.\n\nOn Saturday, Fierceness’ first task will be to break cleanly and establish his preferred forward position. That alone is no given, because he’s breaking from the 17th post and will need to work his way toward the inside quickly.\n\nTrikari wins the $600,000 American Turf Stakes\n\nLongshot Trikari rallied to a thrilling upset victory in the American Turf Stakes.\n\nThe 47-1 dark horse covered the 1 1/4-mile course in 1:43.59, came strong late and roared past favorite Formidable Man in the final strides.\n\nA $2 win wager on Trikari returned a monster $96.34 payout.\n\nHorse safety top of mind this year\n\nThe safety of racehorses is top of mind at the 150th Derby, after 12 horses died last year.\n\nChurchill Downs Inc., the track’s parent company, said it reviewed its safety protocols and industry standards and implemented “key enhancements” for the 2024 races.\n\nThe updated protocols include: track maintenance, the establishment of a safety management committee, increased veterinarian oversight and implemented predictive technology to identify potential injuries before they happen.\n\nThe Derby's red carpet is in full force\n\nThe red carpet at Churchill Downs is popping so far.\n\nThis weekend's event features a 360 Glam Cam on the red carpet \"for celebrities to show off their Derby Day outfits and make their race picks,\" according to an NBC news release. (The cam is not unlike what you'd see at big Hollywood events.)\n\nE! News is also reporting live from the event, with Zanna Roberts Rassi giving fashion insights and posting content on social media in the hours leading up to the event, NBC said in its release. Rassi posted on Instagram this week, saying she's bringing \"all things FASHION, HATS, CELEBS, MINT JULIPS….

Meriwether Lewis Clark attended the Epsom Derby in England. When Clark made his way back to the States, he sought to create a track similar to England’s that Kentucky racers could call home.\n\nA few years later, that desire came to fruition when Churchill Downs was born. The track’s first official race day came May 17, 1875, with three major stakes races — the Kentucky Derby, the Kentucky Oaks and the Clark Handicap.\n\nWho can race and what is the purse?\n\nWho: 20 3-year-old horses\n\nPurse: $5 million\n\nDistance: 1¼ miles\n\nForecast: 79 degrees with a 35% chance of rain"
