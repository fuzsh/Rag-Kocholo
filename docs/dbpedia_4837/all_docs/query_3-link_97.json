        "text": "The saga continues of the almost Triple Crown winning horses. Forty-six horses have won two legs of the Triple Crown. Of those, sixteen won the Kentucky Derby (KD) at Churchill Downs and Preakness Stakes (PS) at Pimlico only to be beaten in the Belmont Stakes (BS) at Belmont Park.\n\nTwo others, Burgoo King (1932) and Bold Venture (1936), won the Derby and Preakness, but were forced out of the Belmont with the same injury–a bowed tendon–that effectively ended their racing careers. As a side note – Bold Ventures jockey Ira Hanford attended the Kentucky Derby in 2006 with Kentucky Derby Tours where he was honored in the Gallop to Glory exhibit in Lousiville.\n\nIn 1978, Alydar finished second to Affirmed in all three races, which is the only time that has happened.
