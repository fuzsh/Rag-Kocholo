        "text": "GEORGETOWN, Ky. â The oldest living Kentucky Derby winner is thriving in Georgetown. The horse, Silver Charm, celebrated his 30th birthday in February and is living out his retirement in the Commonwealth.\n\nSilver Charm was born in Florida in 1994.\n\nâPeople have different opinions, but I think you could generally say that a horseâs age can be calculated by multiplying their age by three and adding seven and by that calculation, Silver Charm, the oldest living Kentucky Derby winner, is 97,â said John Nicholson, president and CEO of Old Friends Thoroughbred Retirement Farm.\n\nIn the horseâs 24 starts, he had 12 wins, including the Preakness Stakes and the 123rd Kentucky Derby in 1997.\n\nToday the horse is living his best life at Old Friends Thoroughbred Retirement facility in Georgetown.\n\nNicholson said Silver Charm has been acting as a âspokes horseâ for other retired horses by elevating the concept of thoroughbred retirement.\n\nâSo, when you think about it, he not only lived a good life here, but heâs made possible a great life for retired thoroughbred horses from that point forward, and youâre talking hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of horses that have enjoyed a great life at Old Friends,â he said.\n\nMichael Blowen founded the farm after being a movie critic for the Boston Globe. He said it was his love for horses that made the place possible.\n\nâWhen I was at the Boston Globe, when I was covering the movies, I was around a lot of movie stars and I never felt that way too much about, you know, meeting the movie stars, but I felt I felt like a huge fan when I met these horses and thatâs how it all started,â Blowen said.\n\nNicholson said athlete-horses like Silver Charm worked hard and did what they were told to do, so now itâs their time to enjoy retirement.\n\nâNow is their opportunity to have a life where theyâre the ones who tell us what they want and what they like, and weâre here to serve them and I think thatâs part of the special philosophy of Old Friends,â said Nicholson.\n\nThroughout his four years racing, Silver Charm won nearly $7 million in prizes.\n\nOld Friends Thoroughbred Retirement Farm has 161 retired horses. The average age is 15.5 years old, making Silver Charm one of the oldest on the farm."
