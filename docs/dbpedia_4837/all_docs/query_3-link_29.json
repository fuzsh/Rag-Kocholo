        "text": "On June 8, 1963, Chateaugay, owned by Darby Dan Farm, trained by J. P. Conway and ridden by Braulio Baeza, won the Belmont Stakes at Aqueduct. With wind down the backstretch, he finished the one-and-one-half-mile race in 2:30.20 seconds, establishing a track record for that distance. Before this race, there was no track record at Aqueduct for this distance. Chateaugay went off the second choice at 9-2, beating the favorite Candy Spots, who went off at 1-2. While many in the crowd were disgruntled by Chateaugay’s win, probably few were surprised because he was the second favorite. And probably only a very few were actually amazed by Chateaugay’s accomplishment.\n\nAmong those amazed by Chateaugay’s Classic victory was his jockey, Braulio Baeza. In a recent phone conversation with Baeza, he relayed to us that only 12 months earlier, he piloted the then 2-year-old Chateaugay on a half-mile work at Belmont Park and thought the horse was “weakening under him.” The horse just couldn’t breathe. Conway, Chateaugay’s trainer, monitored the colt’s work, observing he couldn’t run any farther.\n\nThere was hope that Chateaugay had promising racing potential as his older full sister was Primonetta, also trained by Conway. She won the 1961 Prioress Stakes, Delaware Oaks and Alabama Stakes. At this same time, in June 1962, Baeza rode Primonetta on her return start for her 4-year-old campaign, a race she won by 20-plus lengths. Primonetta would go on to win six more races that year, including the Spinster Stakes, and be named Handicap Filly or Mare Champion of 1962.\n\nIt was at this time that Bernard F. Brennan V.M.D., a long-time friend and associate of Conway’s, received a call from the trainer requesting that he examine the colt. Conway’s description of Chateaugay’s condition, according to The Baltimore Sun, was: “It was a sort of fluttering, or maybe even like a paralysis in his throat. It was like he would run as far as he could go on one breath, and when that ran out, he couldn’t go any further.”\n\nBrennan’s examination was conducted by the method of palpation the larynx. His diagnosis was a paralyzed cartilage in the horse’s upper airway, inhibiting the horse’s oxygen intake. He advised Conway that there were no medications to treat this condition, and a surgical procedure was recommended called sacculectomy, now commonly called ventriculectomy. Brennan was confident that if the operation was performed correctly, it would work.\n\nDiscussion about Chateaugay’s condition ensued, and John Galbreath, owner of Darby Dan Farm, decided that because Brennan made the diagnosis, he should perform the surgery. On July 4, 1962, the surgery was performed. The prescribed aftercare for Chateaugay entailed providing water and wet hay and hand-walking him frequently during the day. On Aug. 4, the trainer resumed training the horse.\n\nChateaugay made his first start on Oct. 17 at Belmont Park and won his first race on Oct. 25 at the track. Chateaugay made a total of five starts as a 2-year-old, winning two races. In November, Conway started him in a stakes race to see how Chateaugay would handle himself in the company of good horses. The horse ran fourth, and the trainer was pleased, sharing with Brennan after the race, “We have a nice horse.”\n\nChateaugay was shipped to Hialeah Park in late 1962 to prepare for the winter racing meet. On February 23, 1963, Chateaugay won a race at Hialeah. After this, the horse contracted a skin disease, and Conway couldn’t put a saddle on him. By the time the disease cleared up, and Chateaugay was back in training, he had missed the Flamingo Stakes and the Florida Derby.\n\nChateaugay was shipped to Keeneland and won his next start in allowance company. He then won his next start, the Bluegrass Stakes. He also won the Kentucky Derby at Churchill Downs, and then placed in the Preakness Stakes at Pimilico.\n\nTo this day, Baeza maintains his amazement in the results of the operation. He said Chateaugay “was a completely different horse following the surgery and recuperation – he was 1000 percent different, the surgery was a miracle.”\n\nChateaugay was the first known Classic winner to have successfully undergone this procedure.\n\nBrennan and J. P. Conway continued to enjoy many successful years together, campaigning many stakes-winning horses including Rego, Wanda, Twice Worthy, and Garden Verse. Baeza is still working in racing at Hialeah Park and Louisiana Downs. Brennan is retired and lives in FL. He remains an avid student of equine veterinary medicine and horse racing. He was in attendance at the Belmont Stakes on Saturday, commemorating Chateaugay’s victory 50 years earlier."
