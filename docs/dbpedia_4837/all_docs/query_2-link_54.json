        "text": "Mage took center stage – and first place – at the 2023 Kentucky Derby.\n\nThe horse entered the race with 15-to-1 odds and came away with an upset victory at Churchill Downs on Saturday. Now, the 3-year-old colt has the chance to win the Triple Crown if he crosses the finish line first at the Preakness and Belmont Stakes.\n\nComing off the heels of the Derby victory, here are five things to know about Mage.\n\nMage is the grandson of Big Brown and Curlin\n\nMage joined the company of his grandfathers with the 2023 victory at Churchill Downs. Big Brown won the Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes in 2008, while Curlin won the Preakness in 2007.\n\nMage’s sire, Good Magic, finished second in the 2018 Kentucky Derby and is Curlin’s colt. Big Brown is the sire of Puca, Mage’s dam.\n\nMage only had three starts before the 2023 Kentucky Derby\n\nMage’s Derby victory came in just his fourth ever start.\n\nThe horse won his competitive debut on Jan. 28 and made each of his first three starts at Gulfstream Park in Hallandale Beach, Fla. He placed second to Forte, the initial Kentucky Derby favorite before being scratched Saturday morning, in the Florida Derby on April 1.\n\nMage joined Big Brown, Regret (2015) and Justify (2018) as the only horses to win the Derby after making just three previous starts. Mage, Justify and Apollo (1882) are the only Derby winners that never raced as 2-year-olds.\n\nGustavo Delgado Sr. is Mage’s trainer\n\nMage’s team is full of Venezuelan roots.\n\nGustavo Delgado Sr., Mage's trainer, is from Maracaibo and is now based in South Florida. His son, Gustavo Delgado Jr., is an assistant trainer for Mage and took part in the purchase of Mage at auction for OGMA Investments, Ramiro Restrepo, Sterling Racing and Commonwealth.\n\nJavier Castellano was Mage’s jockey at the Kentucky Derby\n\nIt was a sweet 16 for Javier Castellano at the 2023 Kentucky Derby.\n\nThe Hall of Fame jockey, who is also from Maracaibo, earned his first Derby win in his 16th career attempt when he rode Mage. He had been one of four jockeys with 15 or more Derby mounts who did not have a victory at the Run for the Roses.\n\nCommonwealth users make up 25% of Mage’s ownership\n\nAlong with the Delgados and other primary owners, over 300 Commonwealth shareholders profited from Mage’s Derby victory.\n\nCommonwealth is a company that allows users to purchase shares of an athlete. Those who purchased stakes in Mage, which were valued at $50, receive portions of the horse’s purses, sales and future breeding."
