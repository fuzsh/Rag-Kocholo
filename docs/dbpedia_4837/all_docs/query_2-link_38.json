        "text": "This exhibit celebrated the 30th anniversary Kentucky Derby win of the filly, Winning Colors. ‘Winning Colors: Famous Fillies’ featured history, artifacts and more about the only three fillies to win the Kentucky Derby, Regret (1913), Genuine Risk (1980) and Winning Colors (1988).\n\nThe exhibit featured the gold cup presented to the Klein Family, the owners of Winning Colors, for her Derby win. The trophy was acquired by the Museum from the San Diego Hall of Champions and has now been fully restored to its original condition. Winning Colors was the first Kentucky Derby win for Hall of Fame Jockey Gary Stevens and Hall of Fame Trainer D. Wayne Lukas. Many of the artifacts come from the acquired D. Wayne Lukas Collection.\n\nIn addition, the exhibit highlighted the history of the Kentucky Oaks as well as other champion fillies including Personal Ensign, Lady’s Secret, and Zenyatta."
