These talented individuals have made significant contributions to various artistic movements and styles, reflecting the richness and diversity of German culture. Readers can look forward to delving into the lives, works, and enduring legacies of these renowned creators who have earned their place among history's greatest artists.\n\nThe world of famous artists from Germany is fascinating, and an exploration showcases the unique styles, artistic merit, and creativity of each painter. From the Renaissance to modern times, these exceptional artists have represented their respective eras, influencing generations of painters with their innovative techniques.\n\nAmong the numerous famous painters from Germany, a few notable examples include Albrecht Dürer, Caspar David Friedrich, and Otto Dix. Dürer, a pivotal figure in the Northern Renaissance, is celebrated for his remarkable engravings and woodcuts, which forever altered the course of printmaking. Friedrich, by contrast, epitomized German Romanticism through his evocative landscapes that expertly convey the sublime power of nature. Meanwhile, Dix stands as a leading proponent of the Neue Sachlichkeit (New Objectivity) movement, using his distinctive paintings to critically examine the complexities of post-World War I society. These influential artists are just a small representation of the pantheon of famous German artists who have made an impact on the art world.\n\nThe vast array of artists from Germany demonstrates the nation's profound and lasting influence on the global artistic community. By celebrating the work of these famous German artists, one gains a deeper appreciation for the remarkable contributions they have made to the world of art. Their enduring legacies continue to inspire countless painters from Germany and beyond, ensuring their place in history as some of the most exceptional and visionary creators of all time.\n\nRanked by\n\nAngelus Novus, Revolution des Viadukts, Der Goldfisch\n\nBirthplace : Münchenbuchsee, Switzerland\n\nAssociated periods or movements : German Expressionism, Der Blaue Reiter, Cubism, Surrealism, Expressionism\n\nNationality : Germany\n\nArt Forms : Painting, Drawing\n\nPaul Klee (German: [paʊ̯l ˈkleː]; 18 December 1879 – 29 June 1940) was a Swiss-born artist. His highly individual style was influenced by movements in art that included Expressionism, Cubism, and Surrealism. Klee was a natural draftsman who experimented with and eventually deeply explored color theory, writing about it extensively; his lectures Writings on Form and Design Theory (Schriften zur Form und Gestaltungslehre), published in English as the Paul Klee Notebooks, are held to be as important for modern art as Leonardo da Vinci's A Treatise on Painting for the Renaissance. He and his colleague, Russian painter Wassily Kandinsky, both taught at the Bauhaus school of art, design and architecture. His works reflect his dry humor and his sometimes childlike perspective, his personal moods and beliefs, and his musicality.\n\nHans Bellmer\n\nThe Machine Gun(neress) in a State of Grace, La Poupee, The Doll\n\nBirthplace : Katowice, Poland\n\nAssociated periods or movements : Dada, Surrealism\n\nNationality : France, Germany\n\nArt Forms : Painting\n\nHans Bellmer (13 March 1902 – 24 February 1975) was a German artist, best known for the life-sized pubescent female dolls he produced in the mid-1930s. Historians of art and photography also consider him a Surrealist photographer.\n\nTwo Japanese Wrestlers by a Sink, Woman with a Daffodil, Girl with a White Dog\n\nBirthplace : Berlin, Germany\n\nAssociated periods or movements : Contemporary art, Realism, Realism, Surrealism, Expressionism\n\nNationality : United Kingdom\n\nArt Forms : Painting\n\nLucian Michael Freud, OM (; 8 December 1922 – 20 July 2011) was a British painter and draftsman, specializing in figurative art, and is known as one of the foremost 20th-century portraitists. He was born in Berlin, the son of Jewish architect Ernst L. Freud and the grandson of Sigmund Freud. His family moved to Britain in 1933 to escape the rise of Nazism. From 1942–43 he attended Goldsmiths College, London. He served at sea with the British Merchant Navy during the Second World War. His early career as a painter was influenced by surrealism, but by the early 1950s his often stark and alienated paintings tended towards realism. Freud was an intensely private and guarded man, and his paintings, completed over a 60-year career, are mostly of friends and family. They are generally sombre and thickly impastoed, often set in unsettling interiors and urban landscapes. The works are noted for their psychological penetration and often discomforting examination of the relationship between artist and model. Freud worked from life studies, and was known for asking for extended and punishing sittings from his models.\n\nLongeuil, Normandie, Spook I\n\nBirthplace : New York City, New York\n\nAssociated periods or movements : German Expressionism, Der Blaue Reiter, Die Brücke, Cubism, Expressionism\n\nNationality : United States of America, Germany\n\nArt Forms : Painting\n\nLyonel Charles Feininger (July 17, 1871 – January 13, 1956) was a German-American painter, and a leading exponent of Expressionism. He also worked as a caricaturist and comic strip artist. He was born and grew up in New York City, traveling to Germany at 16 to study and perfect his art. He started his career as a cartoonist in 1894 and met with much success in this area. He was also a commercial caricaturist for 20 years for magazines and newspapers in the USA and Germany. At the age of 36, he started to work as a fine artist. He also produced a large body of photographic works between 1928 and the mid 1950s, but he kept these primarily within his circle of friends. He was also a pianist and composer, with several piano compositions and fugues for organ extant.\n\nLightning with Stag in its Glare, The End of the Twentieth Century, 7000 Oaks\n\nBirthplace : Krefeld, Germany\n\nAssociated periods or movements : Fluxus, Conceptual art\n\nNationality : Germany\n\nArt Forms : Performance, Sculpture\n\nJoseph Beuys ( BOYSS, German: [ˈjoːzɛf ˈbɔʏs]; 12 May 1921 – 23 January 1986) was a German Fluxus, happening, and performance artist as well as a painter, sculptor, medallist, installation artist, graphic artist, art theorist, and pedagogue. His extensive work is grounded in concepts of humanism, social philosophy and anthroposophy; it culminates in his \"extended definition of art\" and the idea of social sculpture as a gesamtkunstwerk, for which he claimed a creative, participatory role in shaping society and politics. His career was characterized by open public debates on a very wide range of subjects including political, environmental, social and long term cultural trends. He is widely regarded as one of the most influential artists of the second half of the 20th century.\n\nCaspar David Friedrich\n\nMoonrise Over the Sea, Wreck in the Ice-sea, Wanderer above the Sea of Fog\n\nBirthplace : Greifswald, Germany\n\nAssociated periods or movements : Romanticism, German Romanticism\n\nNationality : Germany\n\nArt Forms : Painting\n\nCaspar David Friedrich (5 September 1774 – 7 May 1840) was a 19th-century German Romantic landscape painter, generally considered the most important German artist of his generation. He is best known for his mid-period allegorical landscapes which typically feature contemplative figures silhouetted against night skies, morning mists, barren trees or Gothic ruins. His primary interest was the contemplation of nature, and his often symbolic and anti-classical work seeks to convey a subjective, emotional response to the natural world. Friedrich's paintings characteristically set a human presence in diminished perspective amid expansive landscapes, reducing the figures to a scale that, according to the art historian Christopher John Murray, directs \"the viewer's gaze towards their metaphysical dimension\".Friedrich was born in the town of Greifswald on the Baltic Sea in what was at the time Swedish Pomerania. He studied in Copenhagen until 1798, before settling in Dresden. He came of age during a period when, across Europe, a growing disillusionment with materialistic society was giving rise to a new appreciation of spirituality. This shift in ideals was often expressed through a reevaluation of the natural world, as artists such as Friedrich, J. M. W. Turner and John Constable sought to depict nature as a \"divine creation, to be set against the artifice of human civilization\".Friedrich's work brought him renown early in his career, and contemporaries such as the French sculptor David d'Angers spoke of him as a man who had discovered \"the tragedy of landscape\". Nevertheless, his work fell from favour during his later years, and he died in obscurity. As Germany moved towards modernisation in the late 19th century, a new sense of urgency characterised its art, and Friedrich's contemplative depictions of stillness came to be seen as the products of a bygone age. The early 20th century brought a renewed appreciation of his work, beginning in 1906 with an exhibition of thirty-two of his paintings in Berlin. By the 1920s his paintings had been discovered by the Expressionists, and in the 1930s and early 1940s Surrealists and Existentialists frequently drew ideas from his work. The rise of Nazism in the early 1930s again saw a resurgence in Friedrich's popularity, but this was followed by a sharp decline as his paintings were, by association with the Nazi movement, interpreted as having a nationalistic aspect. It was not until the late 1970s that Friedrich regained his reputation as an icon of the German Romantic movement and a painter of international importance."
