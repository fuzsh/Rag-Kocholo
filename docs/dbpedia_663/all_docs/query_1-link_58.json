Lichtenstein is shown at work on a painting, a sculpture and a creation using a special iridescent plastic background that changes character as the position of the viewer changes.

Artists and friends talk about the life and work of American artist Andy Warhol (1928–87): Phillip Johnston, director of the Carnegie Museum of Art; Tom Armstrong, director of the Andy Warhol Museum; Mark Francis, curator at the Andy Warhol Museum; Vincent Fremont, art sales agent and consultant at the Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts; Charles Wright, executive director of the Dia Center for the Arts; Fred Hughes, chairman emeritus and co-founder of the Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts; artists Roy Lichtenstein, Yoko Ono, Jamie Wyeth and Philip Pearlstein; art historian Henry Geldzahler; art curator David Whitney; art dealers Leo Castelli and Ivan Karp; John Warhola, Warhol’s brother; and friends Jane Holzer, Kenneth Jay Lane, Brigid Berlin, Dominick Dunne, James Curley and Sean Lennon. Describes the new Andy Warhol Museum, located in an industrial warehouse built in 1911 in Pittsburgh. Shows various works by Warhol. Includes aerial views of Pittsburgh.\n\nComments: Produced to promote the museum’s spring 1994 opening. Adequately orients the viewer to the space and locale of the new museum, and to its mission of propagating the art-historical significance of Warhol and his work. Limited by the somewhat bland and superficial level of a public relations piece, however. Somehow all of the interviewees, whether Lichtenstein or Armstrong, seem to say the same thing. They never really offer any intimate knowledge of Warhol as a person and an artist or any highly sensitized reaction to his work, making the artist seem even more like a commodity. Production quality high. (Staff)\n\nAud./Grade Level: H; C; A\n\nART CARS\n\n2 min. col. video 1986 United States English\n\nDir. Christian Jara Prod. Martin Rhatigan\n\nProd.

They relate how the works were selected to show the relationship between modernism and mass culture and point out the influence of advertising, comics, caricature and graffiti. Includes interviews with some of the artists included in the show: Roy Lichtenstein, James Rosenquist, Jeff Koons, Jenny Holzer, Elizabeth Murray, Peter Halley and Robert Yarber. Critic Arthur C. Danto comments on the ideas presented in the exhibition.\n\nEvaluation: Serves as a visual catalogue for the High & Low exhibition, with an advantageous view of the installation. Evaluates some of the issues surrounding the show and increases our understanding of why pieces were selected. Like an apologia or post-mortem, it raises some questions about how the curators defined and limited their topic and about the success of the exhibition in meeting its goals. Evaluators found the comments of the artists more satisfying to see and hear than the discourse of the curators. Very slick production, but could have been more innovative since so much of pop culture is based in the video image. Acceptable, even intriguing, if disappointing at times. Technical quality good to very good. Content fair to good. Programming potential mostly good (range of opinion from fair to very good).\n\nComments: Badly written. Falls into the trap of using too much art jargon and ironically parallels the theoretical and contextual spewing of Varnedoe and Gopnik. The authority of these two curators is marred by their awkwardness in front of the camera. In a few cases when Varnedoe is speaking, the camera wanders around the exhibition rather than staying fixed on the work being discussed. The curators and critics make the same points, so the narration and commentary are redundant. Do we really need another film on a badly conceived show?

Agency: Manhattan Media Enterprises, Inc.\n\nSource (US): Manhattan Media Enterprises, Inc.\n\nDescribes the interrelationship between fine art and images from popular culture, including advertising, graffiti, caricature and comics. Describes how artists appropriated images from printing typefaces, mail order catalogs and newspapers, or incorporated the objects themselves into their works. Explains that the influence of popular culture on “high” art occurs in many periods, from the Cubist work of Pablo Picasso and Georges\n\nBraque, who used newspaper clippings in their paintings and collages, to the comic-book images of Roy Lichtenstein. Shows works by Alexander Rodchenko, Kurt Schwitters, Fernand Léger, Francis Picabia, Marcel Duchamp, Raoul Hausmann and Joan Miró. Also presents work by Pop artists Richard Hamilton, Claes Oldenburg, James Rosenquist, Robert Rauschenberg and Jasper Johns. Looks at the graffiti-inspired art of Cy Twombly and Jean Dubuffet. Examines how cartoons by animator Winsor McCay and comic-book artists Robert Crumb and George Herriman influenced Ed Ruscha, Philip Guston, Elizabeth Murray and Jeff Koons. Concludes with the work of Jenny Holzer. Produced in conjunction with the exhibition of the same name at the Museum of Modern Art, New York City, in 1990. Narrated by curator Kirk Varnedoe.\n\nEvaluation: Informed, professional, articulate, interesting and valuable, given that it is essentially a filmed lecture. Serves as a record of and guide to the exhibition. For some evaluators, a nice adjunct that may give a better sense of the thinking behind the exhibition than the exhibition itself. In reasonably clear terms, outlines the thesis for the exhibition. Mostly accessible, substantially relates who, when, why and how. Addresses how popular culture got into art but not if and why it becomes art once appropriated: does not distinguish “high” from “low.” Somewhat exclusionary—for example, section on graffiti ignores artists like Keith Haring (1958–90) and Jean-Michel Basquiat (1960–88). Overworked script, too many adjectives; Varnedoe an uneasy narrator in front of rear projections and transparencies of the art. If not overly complicated for the unschooled, perhaps oversimplified for the knowledgeable. Technical quality fair. Content fair to good. Programming potential fair to very good (balanced range of opinion).\n\nComments: Effectively outlines the context and constructs of the exhibition.

Hosted by art historian Edwin Mullins. Masterworks from Great Museums series.\n\nEvaluation: MASTERWORKS: NATIONAL GALLERY OF SCOTLAND: HENRY RAEBURN: REV. ROBERT WALKER SKATING\n\nThe visual approach of this series is to focus the camera on the individual painting in question, with some cutaways to other works by the artist, and—in this instance at least—minimal camera movement. Voice-over narration provides history, background and analysis of the painting. The script provides a succinct discussion of Raeburn’s career and style, Edinburgh patrons, the role of the portraitist in his period, and even the Raeburn room at the National Gallery of Scotland. A little visual analysis supports the speculative identification of this painting as a Raeburn. (But is an unattributed painting the proper focus to discuss Raeburn?) Good art-historical information, but static filmmaking. For most evaluators, a nice, if limited, approach; a minority found it elementary, insubstantial and dull. Series format, economically spending ten minutes per painting, is basically good. Technical quality, content and programming potential all judged good.\n\nMASTERWORKS: NATIONAL GALLERY, BERLIN: HANNA HÖCH: CUT WITH THE KITCHEN KNIFE\n\nAmbitious stab at explaining the artist, her society and the Dada movement, of which she was part–all in just ten minutes. Essentially accurate, fairly effective with interesting subject matter, though it cannot provide enough exploration of the historical references to Weimar Germany or Dada for the uninformed viewer. Höch’s detailed photomontage is difficult to film in a way true to the work; it requires a careful, slow reading to discover its juxtapositions and disjunctions. Details are often dark and hard to see; framing and loose camera don’t integrate the fascinating bits of information back into the whole work. Reading it as a cast of characters deprives the full image of some of its angry power. Too “nice” a film, without real feeling for how “shocking” Hoch’s political and social life was, but does heighten the viewer’s interest. Technical quality fair to good. Content fair to very good (even range of opinion). Programming potential good.\n\nMASTERWORKS: MUSEUM OF MODERN ART, NEW YORK: UMBERTO BOCCIONI, JOAN MIRÓ\n\nScript very ambitious; dense, wordy, overloaded with information. Narrator is sententious and oracular, pompous, overbearing. The format offers a chance for careful exposition of a single painting but we get a relentless barrage of words and so much information that it’s difficult to follow. Too much interpretation with inadequate formal analysis. And whose is the anonymous voice of authority? Cries out for a human presence. Never allows us to just look.

Roy Lichtenstein (1923–97) in Whaam! and Girl at Piano was influenced by comic strips. The favorite subjects of Jasper Johns (b. 1930) are flags, illustrated with his Three Flags, numbers, the alphabet and targets. Claes Oldenburg (b. 1929) finds beauty in ordinary objects, as in his sculpture Clothes Pin.

Close to an ode, with no critical discussion despite the presence of curators and experts. Good-looking, with light touch, this is perhaps a perfect marriage of style and subject.

The first part was filmed in 1972 in Lichtenstein’s small studio in Long Island, New York; the second part was filmed in 1988 in his huge studio on the ground floor of a former warehouse in Manhattan. Traces his sources of inspiration: cartoons, advertising and European masters, with an emphasis on satire and self-reference.

Interviews are punctuated with extremely loud hammering noises (1972) and phones ringing (1988). Meanwhile the artist and critic Annette Michelson continue their conversations about Lichtenstein’s work, ignoring the background noises. While the interview does focus on painting, rather than the biography of the artist, ultimately the film tends to distance the viewer rather than draw us into the artist’s work.

Source: Arts Council of Great Britain (GB)\n\nLooking at Pop art, art historian Robert Hughes sees the movement as an act of survival in the age of the mass media, but also as an evasion of the artists’ responsibility to direct taste, judgment and moral choice. The mass media brought images stripped of complexity and at the same time produced a culture of congestion and glut. Pop art developed as an attempt to compete with this barrage of commercial messages. Hughes examines its birth in the United States with American painters Robert Rauschenberg (1925–2008) and Jasper Johns (b. 1930), who took familiar symbols and artifacts—refuse from garbage cans, targets, the national flag—and transformed them into ambiguous art objects. British painter Richard Hamilton (1922–2011) talks about the collage and the exact repetition of the process of consumer advertising undertaken for his piece The Critic Laughs (1968). The uncritical glance of the television viewer is recreated in the work of American artist Andy Warhol (1928–87). Repetition and sameness are the essence of his series of perfectly standardized objects, but Hughes argues that the idea is only temporarily interesting—boredom is built in. Looking at works by Americans James Rosenquist (b. 1933) and Roy Lichtenstein (1923–97), Hughes observes that Pop art needs the museum more than ever; in the “real” world of Las Vegas, their work would be swamped by the sheer excess of neon consumerism. American sculptor Claes Oldenburg (b. 1929) creates ironic sculptures of familiar objects made dysfunctional by a change of scale or material. His works represent a more positive element in the Pop art approach, that of commenting on aspects of society. Hughes considers that the value of Pop art lies in an openness to modern culture but that it suffers from a tendency to reproduce the instant recognition of the mass media message. His view is that Pop art, caught up in a competition with the commercial world, has failed to be truly critical of it. Rauschenberg appears on-camera in a filmed interview.

Examines Warhol’s legacy and his status as a media celebrity.\n\nEvaluation: Good blend of form and content, a compilation of historical footage and music of the period edited so well that, while overblown and lengthy, it presents the sensibility and aura of Warhol. Technically slick and, much like the artist, with a good sense of humor about itself. Serves as introduction and tribute to Warhol and his circle, giving a good sense of his work and status in the art world, and of a particular era in American culture. Offers an impressive range of interviews with his network of collaborators, other artists, dealers and critics.

Captures a sense of individual achievement while emphasizing the diversity of twentieth-century art in the United States. Shows works by Marsden Hartley, Arthur Dove, Georgia O’Keeffe, Edward Hopper, Stuart Davis, Milton Avery, Gaston Lachaise, Max Weber, Josef Albers, Joseph Stella, Ben Shahn, Richard Serra, Ellsworth Kelly, Arshile Gorky, Franz Kline, Mark Rothko, David Smith, Louise Nevelson, Helen Frankenthaler, Jackson Pollock, Willem de Kooning, Roy Lichtenstein, Claes Oldenburg, Andy Warhol, Lucas Samaras, Richard Estes, Jasper Johns and others. Includes a historical sequence focusing on events leading to the founding of the museum in 1930 by Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney. Narrated by Russell Connor, head of public education at the Whitney.\n\nComments: A once-over-lightly visit to the Whitney, offering a brief history of its founding and a survey of its contents. Though brief, it packs much valuable material into a half hour. Quotations from the artists’ writings are interesting. Good cinematography and an excellent narration make this a useful introduction to modern art for general audiences but it’s too superficial for use with art students.
