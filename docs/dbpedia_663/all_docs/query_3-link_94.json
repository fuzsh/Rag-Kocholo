In 1983 I organized what turned out to be a large exhibition entitled Nuremberg: A Renaissance City, 1500–1618 at the University of Texas in Austin. Little did I realize that my fascination with Albrecht Dürer would prove so persistent. As a scholar of Northern European art of the early modern period, I have mostly, in my publications, stayed safely within my chosen geographic and temporal boundaries. I have, however, long been interested in the afterlife, or Nachleben, of the art and artists that I study. Several invitations to write about the historiography of Northern Renaissance art and especially about Dürer’s treatment by scholars, collectors, and admirers since his death have now brought me, with understandable trepidation, to the nineteenth century. My book offers a chapter in the history of reception of this great Nuremberg master. My project has clearly benefited from the marvelous studies of Dürer’s afterlife by Matthias Mende, Berthold Hinz, Jan Białostocki, and, more recently, Andrea Bubenik and Anja Grebe, among others. Nevertheless, my focus is different. I am fascinated by the different roles accorded Dürer in the decorative programs of dozens of museums erected in the nineteenth century. Most of these institutions are in the German-speaking lands, but others are as far afield as St. Petersburg, in Russia, and St. Louis, on\n\nSmith, Albrecht_PRINT.indd 13\n\nthis side of the Atlantic. Surprisingly, Dürer does not appear in the decorative schemes of his hometown Germanisches Nationalmuseum.1 Established in 1852, this institution moved into its permanent home, a former Carthusian monastery complex, five years later. These art museums are, or, before the destruction of World War II, were, lavishly ornamented with portraits of famous artists either in series or in narrative and allegorical cycles. Dürer, as the most celebrated German artist, offers an ideal case study about nineteenth-century cultural perceptions and his association with other noted masters. There are excellent books about the rise of German museums by Volker Plagemann (1967) and others, as well as monographs focused on single institutions. Otto Martin (1983), Sabine Schulze (1984), and Thorsten Marr (1999) have authored helpful dissertations on museum decoration. With rare exceptions, notably James Sheehan (2000), the literature is written, appropriately, in German. A secondary goal of my book is to make these museums and their relevant scholarly studies better known beyond the German-speaking readership. All translations, unless otherwise noted, are mine. This book is the product of many kindnesses extended to the author. My thanks begin with Sandy, my wonderful wife, who reminds me that there is much more to life than work. In 2000 I was appointed the inaugural holder of the Kay Fortson Chair in European Art at the University of Texas,\n\n7/27/20 10:55 AM\n\npreface\n\nxiv\n\nSmith, Albrecht_PRINT.indd 14\n\nwhere I have taught since 1979. I wish to thank Mrs. Kay Fortson and the board of the Kimbell Art Foundation of Fort Worth for their continuing faith in my teaching and research. Through their largess, I have been able to travel with several of my graduate seminars to Europe, including most recently in fall 2018 to Vienna. I have received a Faculty Research Assignment (2015) and the Walter and Gina Ducloux Fine Arts Faculty Fellowship (spring 2018) from the University of Texas in support of this project. I wish to thank Douglas Dempster, my dean; Jack Risley, my former chair; and Joe Barroso, our departmental accountant. Sydney Kilgore, Mindy Johnston Niendorff, and Mark Doroba in the Fine Arts Library were unfailingly helpful. I am grateful for the two-month research grant that the Alexander von Humboldt-Stiftung of Bonn awarded me in spring 2015. Wolf Tegethoff and Ulrich Pfisterer warmly welcomed me as a fellow at the Zentralinstitut für Kunstgeschichte in Munich. In 2014 Juliet Simpson and Jeanne Nuechterlein invited me to speak on the topic of “Dürer on the Museum” at the “Primitive Renaissances”: Northern European and Germanic Art at the Fin de Siècle to the 1930s symposium at the National Gallery, London. I was encouraged by the participants’ positive responses, especially since I felt like a stranger in a strange land (the nineteenth century). I have since presented my project at several universities. I wish to thank Babette Bohn (Texas Christian University); Donald McColl (Washington College); Klaus Krüger, Elke Werner, and participants in the Kolleg-Forschergruppe BildEvidenz (Freie Universität, Berlin); Elizabeth Ross (University of Florida); Tamar Cholcman and Assaf Pinkus (University of Tel Aviv); and my colleagues and students at the University of Texas.\n\nI appreciate the help and comments that I have received from many individuals.

Jeffrey Chipps Smith Austin, Texas January 6, 2019\n\n7/27/20 10:55 AM\n\nIntroduction\n\nF\n\nor so many visitors to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, the lure of the fabulous artistic treasures within dominates the experience. Even when waiting for the museum to open on the front steps by Fifth Avenue, the tendency is to people-watch with one’s back to Richard Morris Hunt’s monumental Beaux-Arts façade, designed in 1895 and completed in 1902 by his son Richard Howland Hunt (fig. 1).1 I rarely stopped to contemplate the façade beyond admiring its symmetry and classicizing features. Hunt’s east front no longer dominates as it once did, since long flanking wings muting its original projection before the rest of the museum were added by McKim, Mead, and White in 1909–10, while the front steps and plaza were reconfigured by Roche Dinkeloo Associates in 1970 and the Koch Plaza was added in 2014. The façade is more of a protective barrier that safeguards the art within and only begrudgingly admits visitors funneling through its doors. Thus I was surprised many years ago when I first noticed medallions with sculpted bust portraits of Albrecht Dürer (1471–1528) and Rembrandt van Rijn\n\nSmith, Albrecht_PRINT.indd 1\n\n(1606–1669) in the spandrels over the entrance, as if they are greeting the museumgoers (fig. 2). Upon stepping back for a broader view, one sees paired roundels of Bramante (1444–1514) with Michelangelo (1475–1564), and Raphael (1483–1520) with Diego Velázquez (1599–1660), adorning the adjoining bays. In April 1895, just three months before his death, Richard Morris Hunt showed the museum’s trustees a drawing that included more sculptural areas but without a fully defined program. Medallions with artists’ portraits were, however, part of his plan.2 Inscriptions would give the names of Raphael, Michelangelo, Bramante, and Vincenzo Scamozzi (1548–1616), the Venetian architect, together with those of Hunt and his son. By the end of 1897, the program had been reduced to six medallions, three keystone heads of Athena, and four caryatids, which would embody the four branches of art (painting, sculpture, architecture, and music). The sculptor chosen to effect this plan was Karl Bitter (1867– 1915), a Viennese artist who arrived in New York in 1888 and soon became Hunt’s collaborator.3 The\n\n7/27/20 10:55 AM\n\nAlbrecht Dürer and the Embodiment of Genius\n\n2\n\nFig. 1 Richard Morris Hunt, entrance façade of the Metropolitan\n\nMuseum of Art, New York, 1895–1902.

Originally, Phidias and Beethoven were considered, but they were subsequently replaced with Dürer and Velázquez when Luigi Palma di Cesnola, director from 1879 to 1904, worried that all six proposed visual artists were Italian. Bitter’s full-size plaster models were placed on the façade for the trustees’ approval in February 1899. The final sculptures were carved in limestone rather than marble as Hunt had originally proposed. Why were these six artists selected to decorate the museum’s façade? What do they say, if anything, about the institution and its ambitions? The New York program is relatively modest. It is a late example of a practice observed especially throughout the German-speaking lands during the nineteenth century. This was the great age of new art museums, institutions that signaled cultural awareness and, often, political aspirations. Albrecht Dürer played a starring role in this story. He appeared more often than any other Northern European artist as he came to embody the artistic heritage of the German nations. Recognizable likenesses of the Nuremberg master grace or once graced the interiors and/or exteriors of more than thirty museums globally.5 Sometimes he stands alone in full length; other times, as in New York, he is presented as a bust. Karl Bitter based his likeness on Dürer’s Self-Portrait of 1500 in the Alte Pinakothek in Munich (fig. 3).6 He also replicated part of this picture’s inscription: “Albertvs Durervs Noricvs” (Albrecht Dürer of Nuremberg). Elsewhere, museums are adorned with painted, carved, and, at the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, even tiled episodes of Dürer’s life. Alternatively, he appears in the midst of a historical\n\n7/27/20 10:55 AM\n\nIntroduction\n\nallegory. Dürer is the quintessential genius who stands for the brilliance of late medieval–early modern German art and as an inspirational model for nineteenth-century audiences. The story that follows explores the use of Dürer as both historical figure and symbol in the decorative programs of the new art museums that were constructed from the 1820s until the end of the nineteenth century from St. Petersburg and Stockholm to New York and St. Louis.7 Most of the museums are in modern Germany and Austria.\n\nFrom Hero to Genius\n\nThe nineteenth-century museums discussed in this book are or once were adorned with portraits of famous European artists. The latter represent the elite practitioners, members of a highly selective canon whom their contemporaries and/or later audiences determined had exceptional creative skills and often praiseworthy character. Whether we label them as heroes, mortal gods (Dei mortali), superartists, geniuses, or simply rare talents, these artists were believed to embody the heights of human potential and creativity. No less than the images of saints adorning churches, these artists’ portraits, arrayed on museum façades or in its stairways and galleries, stood as exemplars of the possible as well as models for those striving for personal betterment. As Edgar Zilsel remarked, it is a normal human reaction to admire individuals who have exceptional physical skills, leadership qualities, or spiritual gifts.8 Societies have long visualized their heroes or honored them in song and verse. Pliny the Elder praised the first public library in Rome, established in the first century c.e., where painted and sculpted portraits of authors were displayed\n\nSmith, Albrecht_PRINT.indd 3\n\nbeside their books.9 Petrarch’s De Viris Illustribus, with its biographies of notable Roman statesmen and generals, inspired Altichiero’s now-lost cycle of paintings in Francesco Carrara’s palace in Padua. The 1379 dedication of the picture cycle extols the thirty-six full-length portraits: “[You] have given them outward expression in the form of most excellent pictures, so that you may always keep in sight these men whom you are eager to love because of the greatness of their deeds.”10 Similar cycles of uomini famosi became popular in civic and private palaces. Randolph Starn notes that Renaissance Italians, “by transforming the imagery that they had inherited, . . . reappropriated the figure of the hero to display the claims of their own power, ideology, and art.”11 Such programs anticipated the portrait series on museums, theaters, libraries, and other public buildings in the nineteenth century.12 In De re Aedificatoria (1452), Leon Battista Alberti praises the ancient practice of erecting public sculptures of mortals who “deserved lasting commemoration for some distinguished reason.” He adds, “Still others felt that effigies of those worthy of mankind’s praise, and deserving to be commemorated along with the gods, should be set up and displayed in sacred places, so that future generations, when paying their respects, might, in their zest for glory, be incited to follow such example.”13 One contemporary funerary program honoring local artists, including Giotto and Brunelleschi, was established in Florence Cathedral in the fifteenth century.14 Vasari incorporated portraits of Michelangelo, among other artists, together with personifications of the fine arts, in the frescoes of the Chamber of Fame (1542) in the Casa Vasari in Arezzo and in the Sala Vasari (1561–69) in his house in Florence.15 The divine artist (divino artista, Deus artifex) as an idea and appellation has classical roots. Plato\n\n3\n\n7/27/20 10:55 AM\n\nAlbrecht Dürer and the Embodiment of Genius\n\n4\n\nSmith, Albrecht_PRINT.indd 4\n\ndescribes Homer as “the best and most divine of all” poets.16 In 1550 and 1568 Vasari referred to Michelangelo’s and Raphael’s creations and their persons as divine.17 He begins his life of Raphael by opining that “the possessors of such rare and numerous gifts as were seen in Raphael of Urbino, are not merely men, but, if it be not a sin to say it, mortal gods.”18 Even earlier, in an ekphrasis of the engraving Melencolia i, published in Elementa Rhetoricae of 1541, Joachim Camerarius praises “Albrecht Dürer, the most accomplished artist, from whose divine hand [diuina manus] many immortal works still exist.”19 The artist’s hand is compared with the hand of God, which is often depicted in scenes of the creation of the world.20 What makes an artist divine, however, is less easily defined. Dürer stressed invention and imagination, divinely bestowed gifts, as distinguishing features of the great artist. In his draft for a handbook on painting (Food for the Young Painter) of 1512, he writes, “Acquiring the art of painting properly is difficult. . . . For it comes through inspiration from on high. . . . Many centuries ago this great art of painting was highly esteemed by mighty kings, and they enriched excellent artists and held them in great worth, for they deemed such ingenuity a creativity in the image of God himself. For a good painter is inwardly teeming with figures, and were it possible that he might live for ever, he would always, from out of these inner ideas of which Plato writes, have new things to pour forth in his works.”21 He considered being inventive, being so full of figures, as godlike.22 In Dürer’s case, suggestions about the divinity of the artist are raised by his Self-Portrait of 1500 and its reception (fig. 3). Many have remarked upon its visual correspondence with frontal depictions of Christ as Salvator Mundi or as Man of Sorrows.23\n\nIn place of Christ’s blessing hand, the Nuremberg master has substituted his own creative hand, the one that painted the portrait in “undying colors.” In 1842 Jules Michelet may have been among the first to write about this resemblance; however, in his Christ and the Adulterous Woman of 1637, Georg Vischer had modeled Christ upon this portrait of Dürer.24 Was Dürer claiming divinely inspired creativity or, more simply, a personal form of devotional imitatio Christi? In 1500 Conrad Celtis, perhaps moved by this portrait, composed four epigrams praising Dürer: “As another Phidias, a second Apelles you come to us.”25 The last poem compares him with Albertus Magnus (ca. 1193–1280), then celebrated as the greatest German philosopher. Celtis ends by remarking that both men deserve the name “Albrecht the Great,” since “God created equal the genius [ingenium] of each of them.”26 The words ingenium, “ingenuity,” and “genius” share the same Latin roots: gignere, generare, or genere, meaning originally “to father, beget, or give birth.”27 Rudolf Steiner, writing in 1900, observed, “Genius is all about creating, producing, propagating. . . . In essence, ingenuity is intellectual procreation.”28 Ingenium, as used in the early modern period, often conveys the notion of an innate talent, something that springs from one’s imagination or creative powers rather than one’s training.29 This was one of several words used to convey the idea of inspiration and may not have been precisely synonymous with our modern sense of genius.30 According to the Grimm brothers’ Deutsches Wörterbuch, the first volume of which was published in 1854, the word Genie was defined already in the sixteenth century as “the genius in us, an innermost divine voice in the heart, which can reveal the secret to us.”31 Köhne observes that a fundamental change\n\n7/27/20 10:55 AM\n\nIntroduction\n\nin the concept of genius occurred at the end of the seventeenth century, when it went “from a quality that one possessed to something one was, [marking] the historical turning point at which human beings began to see themselves as self-luminous, possessing a luminosity of the mind that radiated charisma and impact in the world.”32 In 1790 Immanuel Kant had declared that “a genius was naturally endowed with the talent that gives the rule to art. Because innate creativity comes from nature it is nature—through genius—that determines the principles of art.”33 Increasingly, genius was less about the specific actions and works of the persons said to be geniuses and more about their inner lives, the “tension and power of [their] thinking, feeling, and striving.”34 Descriptions of Dürer’s inner life even before his death in 1528 and up to the present stress his piety, his virtuousness, his industry, and often his melancholic temperament. Camerarius remarks, “The nature of the man is never more certainly and definitely shown than in the works he produces as the fruit of his art.”35 Nevertheless, since an artist’s character was often inferred from his art, Dürer remains tied to his Melencolia i (1514), his elusive allegory about the relation between melancholy and creative inspiration.36 Erwin Panofsky claims this engraving was “a spiritual self-portrait of the artist.”37 Although melancholy is now recognized as depression, classical writers and their early modern cousins, from Marsilio Ficino (1489) and the Florentine Neoplatonists to Robert Burton (1631), associated this temperament with creativity, specifically with bouts of exceptional insightful frenzy (furore), which, if not contained, threatened madness.38 Artists, writers, and musicians, among others, often cultivated a melancholic image especially during the Romantic period, when it was believed to be one of the defining traits of the genius.39 As Jan Białostocki\n\nSmith, Albrecht_PRINT.indd 5\n\nFig. 3 Albrecht Dürer, Self-Portrait, 1500. Oil on board. Alte\n\nPinakothek, Munich. Photo: bpk Bildagentur / Bayerische Staatsgemäldesammlungen München / Art Resource, New York.\n\nhas discussed, there was ample nineteenth-century literature, often of non-German origins, extolling the melancholic Dürer.40 The Nuremberg master’s own work demonstrates his understanding of Ficino’s writings. Camerarius describes the artist\n\n7/27/20 10:56 AM\n\nAlbrecht Dürer and the Embodiment of Genius\n\n6\n\nSmith, Albrecht_PRINT.indd 6\n\nas given to “pleasantness and cheerfulness” rather than “a melancholy severity [and] a repulsive gravity.”41 In his Commentary on the Soul (1548), Philipp Melanchthon writes positively about tempered melancholy, such as the “well-known heroic melancholia of Scipio or Augustus or Pomponius Atticus or Dürer,” which “is the noblest, and stands out for its fine qualities of every sort, ruled as it is by a temperate mixture, and arises from the favourable position of the stars.”42 Although Dürer has been so closely associated with melancholy across the centuries, it is surprising that none of the dozens of portraits of the artist adorning nineteenth-century museums represents him overtly as a melancholic. The Romantic era granted unusual authority to artists. Friedrich Schlegel claimed, “What humankind is to other life forms on earth, so the artist is in comparison to other human beings.” Novalis (Georg Philipp Friedrich von Hardenberg) exclaimed, “The artist stands above other human beings, like a statue on its pedestal.”43 For writers, beginning with Wilhelm Heinrich Wackenroder and Ludwig Tieck, Dürer occupied the peak of German art as he, in their imagination, personified all of the pious virtues they longed to see in a Christian artist. Whether we consider him hero, divino artista, superartist, or genius, however, matters less than the broad, centuries-long recognition of his exceptionality. Dürer embodied the glory of past German, indeed Northern European, artistic greatness and, just as importantly, served as a model for a new century of German artists aspiring to find their own creative identity. In his Appeal to Painters of the Present Day (1804), Friedrich Schlegel laments the current state of German art: “When we consider the infinite number of great compositions which Raphael produced, although snatched away in the bloom of age and the zenith of his fame, or the iron industry\n\nof the genuine Dürer, displayed in his innumerable creations of every kind, executed on the most various materials, although to him also a long term of years was denied, we shrink from comparing our own puny period with the vast proportions of that majestic epoch.”44 Concurrent with this celebration of artists, dozens of public monuments honoring Martin Luther, Johann Sebastian Bach, and Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, among others, were erected in marketplaces, parks, and other prominent sites during the nineteenth century.45\n\nDürer, the Canon of Famous Artists, and the Great Age of Museums\n\nAlthough the museum portraits of Albrecht Dürer offer a fascinating case study for his Nachleben, or posthumous reception, he is inevitably accompanied by one or more other renowned masters drawn from an evolving canon of “worthy” artists. Which artists were included and how did this membership change over the century? How and by whom were these artists selected? Does the frequent proclaiming of a canon of past artists convey doubts about the current state of the visual arts? Answers to these questions are tied to the rise of art history, with its biographical emphasis, as a discipline in the nineteenth century. Certain masters were celebrated for their achievements, their character, and their broader impacts on the history of art. Dürer was literally the face of German art, yet he was lauded as well for his piety and work ethic. The nineteenth century witnessed the rise of new museums across Europe and especially in the German-speaking lands. Princely collections, such as those in Munich, Dresden, and Vienna, were housed in sumptuous new buildings. Political\n\n7/27/20 10:56 AM\n\nIntroduction\n\nrivalries and ambitions helped fuel this phenomenon. The three initial museums on the Museumsinsel in Berlin exemplify Prussian efforts to demonstrate the growing cultural profile of their capital. Cities, local art societies, and even art schools erected museums. From the Glyptothek (1816–30) and Alte Pinakothek (1826–36) in Munich onward, it became fashionable to decorate these new museums with portraits of artists, often joined by allegories. The resulting programs hinted at the richness of the collections. Yet even by the loose attribution standards of that time, most museums could not claim to own art by Michelangelo or Raphael. Dürer was better represented in these collections because of the availability of his prints. Often these decorative programs were less about ownership than about pedagogical goals. Just as museums began to organize their galleries chronologically and by schools (e.g., Italian or, more specifically, Florentine or Venetian painting), their decorative cycles frequently provided an abbreviated history of art. Specific masters embodied a time and place, as Rubens embodied the Flemish Baroque, and Titian, the Venetian Renaissance. Using Dürer as my example, I shall explore the messages and narratives of these museums. Paintings (including frescoes), sculptures, and even tiles were employed in these campaigns. Dürer’s portraits appear or once appeared on portals and façades, in entrance halls and around grand staircases, and in loggias, ceremonial rooms, and galleries. Sculptures range from larger-than-life-size statues to busts to relief portraits. Some paintings detail episodes of the Nuremberg master’s life and myth or include him in a grand narrative about the Middle Ages, the Renaissance, or the Reformation. As part of a broader cycle, he can be shown alone or in the company of other artists, the choice of whom often bears\n\nSmith, Albrecht_PRINT.indd 7\n\nspecific meanings. Sometimes he is the sole German master. Later he is often joined by Hans Holbein the Younger (1497–1543) or the brass sculptor Peter Vischer the Elder (1455–1529). Interestingly, artists such as Albrecht Altdorfer, Hans Baldung Grien, Hans Burgkmair, Lucas Cranach the Elder, Matthias Grünewald, Tilman Riemenschneider, and Martin Schongauer, now considered central to the development of German art around 1500, rarely figure in these museum cycles, if they figure at all. The choice of which older artists to include mirrors the texts of general surveys of German art of this period. Among his contemporaries, Dürer is frequently paired with Raphael because each was considered to represent the apogee of art on his side of the Alps. They often hold hands or warmly greet each other. Several cycles, especially those after about 1850, juxtapose Dürer and his early modern contemporaries with nineteenth-century German painters, sculptors, and architects. The greatness of the age of Dürer is credited for inspiring the new “Renaissance,” or vibrant rebirth, of German art shortly after 1800. With just a few exceptions, these programs make no reference to German art and artists during the long interim separating Dürer and Holbein from, later, Christian Daniel Rauch (1777– 1857), Peter von Cornelius (1783–1867), and Karl Friedrich Schinkel (1781–1841). Munich, Berlin, and other towns abounded with pride in the achievements of these and other modern masters. Nationalism, an especially complicated and often fractured subject before the unification of Germany in 1871, was an underlying catalyst or motivating factor.46 Not surprisingly, several of the modern artists honored in these programs were involved in designing and/or embellishing the new German museums. These projects involved many of the century’s most famous masters, including the architects\n\n7\n\n7/27/20 10:56 AM\n\nAlbrecht Dürer and the Embodiment of Genius\n\n8\n\nSchinkel, Leo von Klenze, Gottfried Semper, Carl von Hasenauer, Friedrich August Stüler, and Johann Heinrich Stark; sculptors Rauch, Ludwig Schwanthaler, Ernst Rietschel, and Ernst Julius Hähner; and painters Cornelius, Friedrich Overbeck, Wilhelm von Kaulbach, Moritz von Schwind, and Hans Makart. Hosts of lesser-known masters, often with local and regional reputations, were also engaged in these projects, which were highly coveted and often lasted a decade or longer. Competitions were sometimes used to select the artists and architects.\n\nAudience and Intentions\n\nThe museums discussed in this book vary in ambition. Some are huge in scale and others much more modest. A few are national institutions in capital cities. Several are princely collections displaying the cultural refinement of their noble patrons. Still others have regional or local significance. Nevertheless, they share certain pedagogical goals and a growing awareness of their audiences. There have been sharply different opinions about who should have access to museum collections. Historically, a princely gallery was private and intended primarily for the enjoyment of the noble family and some members of the household. Artists and other “suitable” visitors were admitted under certain circumstances. The appropriateness of some visitors depended on their social class and level of education. These restrictions would change significantly over the course of the nineteenth century. The British Museum in London, which opened in 1759, offered a more inclusive model. A German visitor, Karl Philipp Moritz, in 1782 remarked, “The visitors were of all classes and both sexes, including some of the lowest class; for, since the Museum is the\n\nSmith, Albrecht_PRINT.indd 8\n\nproperty of the nation, everyone must be allowed the right of entry.”47 Admission was free for all. In contrast, the Altes Museum in Berlin in 1829, the year of its opening, charged visitors ten groschen.48 Munich’s Alte Pinakothek remained free until 1910, when a fee of one mark (roughly equal to five euros) was first levied, though the museum was free twice a week. The number of visitors would climb sharply over the nineteenth century. In 1870 the Gemäldegalerie in Dresden recorded around 100,000 visitors; the Nationalgalerie in Berlin had more than 250,000 visitors in 1879. At peak hours the museums were often overcrowded, which impacted the viewer’s experience, the air quality within the galleries, and the condition of the objects. The Nationalgalerie initially limited admissions to five hundred visitors at any given time. Some museums controlled access by restricting when one could visit. By being open only a few hours during the week, some institutions essentially excluded visitors from the lower classes who did not have flexible working schedules. For example, in 1839 the Royal Saxon Painting Gallery, the predecessor of the Gemäldegalerie, in Dresden, announced that it was open from nine in the morning to one in the afternoon during the workweek but only to decently dressed (“anständig Gekleidete”) visitors.49 Thus clothing rules were another way of excluding the poor. Czar Nicholas I (r. 1825–55) required men to be attired in uniform or tailcoats and women in court dresses before being admitted to the Hermitage in St. Petersburg.50 Initially they had to obtain tickets from the Ministry of the Imperial Court. Stepan Gedeonov, the Hermitage’s director from 1863 to 1878, obtained permission from Czar Alexander II (r. 1855–81) to allow free entry to all who wished to visit the museum. Some constraints, however, were practical, such as opening for only a\n\n7/27/20 10:56 AM\n\nIntroduction\n\nfew hours around midday, especially in the winter, because of the galleries were long illuminated solely by natural light. Fortunately, during the course of the nineteenth century most museums became more welcoming to all social classes of visitors. Leo von Klenze, architect of the Alte Pinakothek in Munich, remarked, “It is far better for the nation to pay a few additional attendants in the rooms, than to close the doors on the laboring classes, to whose recreation and refinement a national collection ought to be principally devoted.”51 During the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, there was a lively debate, especially in Berlin, about the role of the museum.52 At that moment Berlin had no public museums, but planning discussions were underway that eventually resulted in Schinkel’s Altes Museum (1823–30). Was the purpose of a museum and its art to be a “Bildungsschule des Geschmacks” (an educational school of taste)? That is, should it be a place for instruction of the broader laity rather than exclusively a place for gratification of individuals who already understand art? Or was it to be a setting for a more humanistic self-education through the close examination of fine art? The German concept of Bildung, or education, includes learning as a means of personal cultivation and character formation.53 Many believed that museums could be tools for morally uplifting the citizens. Schinkel adopted the motto “Erst erfreuen, dann belehren” (First delight, then instruct). He felt the goal of a museum was to provide the public the opportunity for moral enlightenment.54 In 1807 the Prussian culture minister Karl, Freiherr vom Stein zum Altenstein, wrote that art exemplifies the highest expression of humanity.55 Since it is the purpose of the state to elevate its citizens, this task is uniquely suited to the fine arts and science.\n\nSmith, Albrecht_PRINT.indd 9\n\nIn 1828 Schinkel and Gustav Friedrich Waagen, the influential art historian, and, beginning in 1832, the first director the Berlin Museum (Altes Museum), wrote, “In our opinion the noblest and main purpose of the museum is to awaken—where it still slumbers—the public’s sense of visual art as one of the most important branches of human culture, and—where it has already been awakened—to provide it with suitable nourishment and the opportunity for ever-greater refinement. This should take absolute precedence over any other purposes that may concern different classes of human society.”56 Waagen remarked, “The first and highest purpose of a museum is the spiritual education of the Nation through the promotion of the perception of beauty. Only the second purpose is historical.”57 For Waagen, beauty was a means for educating the lower classes (“unteren Klassen”). Leo von Klenze described his Glypothek in Munich as more of an institution for the nation than for the student artist, a place suitable to lead art into life and to mingle with the living.58 The goals of bolstering the public’s education and morality through contact with fine art were repeatedly articulated during this era.59 How a museum might achieve these goals also engendered disagreements. Quatremère de Quincy, who hoped to succeed Dominique-Vivant Denon as director of the Louvre (the former Musée Napoléon), argued “the élan that brings beautiful things into bloom”—that is, the intrinsic beauty of certain works of art—was threatened by the new museographic obsession with chronological and didactic displays. He warned of “killing art to turn it into history.”60 Masterpieces, as the highest expression of artistic creativity, were believed to offer the greatest educational and moral benefit. Others opted for gallery or exhibition displays surveying\n\n9\n\n7/27/20 10:56 AM\n\nAlbrecht Dürer and the Embodiment of Genius\n\n10\n\na school or period of art.61 Over the course of the nineteenth century, the more historical approach came to dominate, though never wholly at the expense of the aesthetic experience. The inclusion of portraits of Dürer and other leading artists on and in the new museums celebrated the greatest masters who by their very presence physically embodied the sweep of history.\n\nAlbrecht Dürer on the Museum\n\nThe chapters that follow offer a detailed, though not exhaustive, examination of the cultural and political dynamics that prompted the rise of new art museums and the unique role accorded Dürer in their artistic programs. The ordering is loosely chronological. Chapter 1 considers how the secularization of monasteries and Napoleon’s systematic looting of Europe’s artistic treasures around 1800 prompted a new and increasingly focused appreciation of older German art as a manifestation of German national identity. The concerted collecting efforts by the Boisserée brothers and Ferdinand Franz Wallraf of Cologne exemplify attempts to preserve this vulnerable patrimony. Why Dürer? This question must, of course, be answered, since his very inclusion on so many museums reveals he played a unique role within German national identity. Chapter 2 explores the artist’s self-fashioning, including his self-portraits and ubiquitous AD monogram, and his early posthumous cult. Around 1800 writers and artists championed Dürer as the embodiment of German genius. This celebration of his life and art peaked in 1828 in the many elaborate jubilees associated with the three hundredth anniversary of his death. Together these discussions provide a foundation for understanding the different roles and\n\nSmith, Albrecht_PRINT.indd 10\n\nsettings accorded to the Nuremberg master as new museums began to arise. Chapter 3, on the Alte Pinakothek in Munich, and chapter 9, on the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna, present detailed case studies for the origins and the culmination of this decorative practice. In different ways, Dürer is singled out within the contexts of Bavarian and Habsburg cultural politics. The Alte Pinakothek almost immediately inspired programs of varying ambition across the German-speaking lands and far beyond. Its architecture and its use of artist portraits, including Dürer’s, became the prototypes for a host of new museums. The rich diversity of iconographic programs and artistic solutions is addressed in the intervening five chapters. Many of the museums under discussion were severely damaged or wholly destroyed in World War II. For instance, the Alte Pinakothek and Berlin’s Neues Museum in Berlin have lost virtually all of their original decoration. One must rely on old photographs and other primary sources to revive these once-grand cycles. In other cases, our knowledge sadly remains incomplete. Nevertheless, what emerges from these museums is the profound admiration accorded Albrecht Dürer throughout the nineteenth century.\n\n7/27/20 10:56 AM\n\nChapter 1\n\nPreludes\n\nThose who do not know him lack part of the knowledge of our history; but for those who do know him the name Dürer, whenever it is pronounced, sounds like “Germany, Germany.” —Hermann Grimm (1866)\n\nT\n\no understand how Albrecht Dürer became synonymous with German art and cultural aspirations,1 it is necessary to step back a few decades before the first foundation stones were laid for the Alte Pinakothek in Munich on April 7, 1826. The upheavals of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, including the demise of the Holy Roman Empire, the secularization of Catholic Church properties, the triumph and then defeat of Napoleon, and a new political order post-1815, had shocked German society. The first part of this chapter addresses an emerging cultural awareness of some leaders that art as “inalienable national property” must be protected.2 The answer to the question “Why Dürer?,” which will be addressed in chapter 2, begins with\n\nSmith, Albrecht_PRINT.indd 11\n\nhis own self-fashioning and his posthumous fame. In life and in death, this Nuremberg master has enjoyed remarkable recognition for his artistic skills, his knowledge, and his perceived upstanding moral character. With his death, however, Dürer’s person and his narrative became malleable. Others began to delineate the character and contours of an increasingly mythic celebrity, one that would fit the varying needs of contemporary and future audiences. For many Romantic writers and Nazarene artists, he was Germany’s counterpart to Italy’s Raphael. Both men served as bearers of meaning, representatives of a time of faith and the highest artistic achievements. The growing cult of Dürer around 1800 blossomed fully in 1828, when jubilee celebrations honoring the three hundredth anniversary of his death were staged across Germany. This is precisely the moment that new museums in Munich and Berlin, and not long before those in other cities, were being planned and constructed. Often the nobles and civic leaders, architects, and artists involved in these Dürer-Fests were the patrons, designers, and decorators of these new institutions.\n\n7/27/20 10:56 AM\n\nAlbrecht Dürer and the Embodiment of Genius\n\n12\n\nThe Historical Moment and the Rise of the Art Museum\n\nIn 1793 the Museum de la République française opened in the Louvre Palace in Paris. The former royal residence was now a museum hung mostly with art confiscated from the nobility and Catholic Church. A national institution, one accessible to everyone, was born. Created amid the chaos of the French Revolution, the Louvre would become the inspiration for later museums across Europe. Writing in 1792, Armand-Guy Kersaint claimed the Louvre would “speak to all nations, transcend space, and triumph over time.”3 As a center of scholarship, it would permit “the reunion of all that nature and art have produced.” The utopian potential of the museum included social benefits. The armies of the First Republic conquered Belgium and the German lands west of the Rhine River. They then moved victoriously across the continent and to Egypt. Art as the booty of war was shipped back to Paris.4 The looting was systematic, especially under Dominique-Vivant Denon, whom Napoleon appointed as director of museums and general director of the Musée Napoléon, the Louvre museum’s new name from 1804 to 1814.5 Denon dispatched special agents with lists of desired works of art and even country guidebooks to seize important objects from foreign lands “pour enricher la République.” Triumphal processions of the treasures of other nations paraded through the city’s streets on their way to the Louvre and Bibliothèque nationale. This stripping of their cultural patrimonies stunned the affected countries. Yet this was just one of the events that subsequently prompted a reevaluation of art and national heritages. In 1773 Pope Clement XIV (r. 1769–74) suppressed the Society\n\nSmith, Albrecht_PRINT.indd 12\n\nof Jesus.6 In 1781–82 Emperor Joseph II (r. 1765–90) secularized most of Austria’s monasteries. Elector Maximilian IV Joseph of Bavaria (r. 1799–1806) closed Bavaria’s monasteries in 1802–3. The results of these and other secularizations were the dislocation and frequent destruction of vast quantities of art. Ripped from their religious contexts, devotional objects became works of art, often on the commercial market. Nobles and towns alike frequently gained ownership of church libraries and art collections. Occasionally, this prompted the foundation of new institutions or the rapid expansion of others, such as the Royal Bavarian Library (the future Bayerische Staatsbibliothek) in Munich.7 Following Napoleon’s initial surrender, in May 1814, and then his final defeat at the Battle of Waterloo, on June 18, 1815, Prussia and other nations sought the return of their plundered art.8 The situation in Cologne offers insights concerning not only the city’s immediate demand to restitute its art but also the new awareness of the importance of German cultural heritage. Lists of missing works were drawn up, and agents were dispatched to Paris seeking repatriation. Ferdinand Franz Wallraf, acting on behalf of the city of Cologne, petitioned Eberhard von Groote, its Prussian representative in Paris, to press for the restitution of its stolen art.9 Here, as was perhaps typical, the results were mixed. For instance, Peter Paul Rubens’s Crucifixion of Saint Peter, seized by the French from the Peterskirche in Cologne in 1794 and taken to Paris, where it was displayed in the Grand Gallery of the Louvre, was returned in 1815 through von Groote’s efforts. Accompanied by a procession of the “painters, artists, and friends of art of Cologne,” the altarpiece, crowned by a laurel wreath and baldachin, was transported from the city hall through the streets to the Peterskirche. A lithograph made twenty-two\n\n7/27/20 10:56 AM\n\nPreludes\n\nyears later commemorates the festive event, showing the painting being carried through the streets at the head of a long procession of local dignitaries and citizens.10 Many other objects, however, either disappeared or remain in Paris today.11 In 1816 von Groote urged the establishment of a Central Commission for Art and Antiquities in Prussia to counter what he perceived as the “ever more incessant spirit of destruction due to petty interests, lack of love for and attention to antiquities, and false notions of modern art and its worth.”12 The French conquest of Cologne in 1794 had started a destabilization of the city’s cultural heritage. The secularization of Cologne’s churches, ordered on June 9, 1802, resulted in the closure of sixty-seven institutions, including all of the city’s collegiate, abbey, and cloister churches, all separate chapels, and other religious buildings.13 Wallraf began actively buying art locally in an attempt to save it.14 In 1818 he bequeathed his art collection to the city of Cologne, which it received upon his death in 1824. The gift included 1,724 paintings, 3,875 drawings, 42,419 prints, 521 manuscripts, and around 6,000 coins and medals.15 The scale of this donation stimulated discussions about a city museum to display the collection. A permanent solution, the Wallraf-Richartz Museum, was only realized in 1861.16 Germany, under the new title of the German Empire, became a unified country only in 1871. The political map was extensively altered even before the defeat of Napoleon in 1814–15.17 With France’s seizure of the lands west of the Rhine, a redistribution of territorial sovereignty within the Holy Roman Empire was agreed to in 1803. Ecclesiastical principalities lost their lands and political authority. Thousands of monasteries and other church institutions were closed. Secular authorities\n\nSmith, Albrecht_PRINT.indd 13\n\nannexed church property. Most of the imperial free cities lost their status and sovereignty as they were absorbed into large states. Between 1801 and 1806/7 an estimated 60 percent of the German population changed rulers at least once.18 When the Kingdom of Bavaria was established, in 1806, regions such as Franconia and Swabia, including the imperial free cities of Nuremberg and Augsburg, were joined with the historical Duchy of Bavaria. Baden and Württemberg experienced a 950 percent and an 850 percent increase in population respectively.19 Under French pressure, Emperor Franz II (r. 1792–1806) dissolved the Holy Roman Empire in 1806 and became Franz I, emperor of Austria (r. 1804–35).20 The Kingdom of Prussia, founded in 1772, lost half of its territories under the terms of the Treaty of Tilsit, of 1807; however, it expanded dramatically into Saxony, Westphalia, and the Rhineland, including Cologne, as a result of the Congress of Vienna (September 1814–June 1815).21 More than half of Germany had new rulers post-1815.22 These and other events resulted in a reconfiguring of much more than new maps and political jurisdictions. They challenged traditional identities, loyalties, and histories. Even before the upheavals of the 1790s and ensuing decades, the question of what it meant to be German was actively discussed. German historical consciousness—that is, a shared identity based on language and civilization— emerged in the arts and literature, as in the writings of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe on the Strasbourg Cathedral (1772) and, more romantically, the books of Ludwig Tieck and Wilhelm Heinrich Wackenroder. In his Treatise on the Origin of Language (1772) and other writings, Johann Gottfried Herder stresses the importance of one’s mother tongue, which lies at the core of one’s identity. He remarks, “Only through language are nations made, only through\n\n13\n\n7/27/20 10:56 AM\n\nAlbrecht Dürer and the Embodiment of Genius\n\n14\n\nSmith, Albrecht_PRINT.indd 14\n\ncommon language do people achieve humanity.”23 Even when language and history lacked political unity, they could provide an assumption of cohesion, one that distinguished Germans from other neighboring cultures, such as French or Italian. Lacking a coherent present, artists, writers, composers, and others often sought an imagined national past characterized by Charlemagne’s establishment of the Holy Roman Empire, medieval piety, the soaring achievements of Gothic churches, and the brilliance of Albrecht Dürer. Richard Wagner’s Die Meistersinger (1867/68) exploits Hans Sachs to stoke contemporary nationalism. Hannu Salmi remarks, “In a nationalist culture, imagination was both synchronic and diachronic. Synchronic thinking emphasized situating the nation in relation to surrounding cultures and other nations. Diachronic thinking . . . emphasized the importance of historical continuity: the nation had ‘always’ been. The days of its magnificence could be long past, but glory could be returned if the nation realized its own station and significance. The diachronous approach ensured the popularity of historically focused art, which indeed continued in Europe throughout the nineteenth century.”24 Whether looking back to Dürer or to the German fairy tales assembled by the Grimm brothers, this imagined past and the very process of imagining provided “symbolic capital” for constructing the nation and the renewal of its greatness. This looking back inevitably involves an understanding of time. Reinhart Koselleck posits that time can be thought of not as linear or recurrent and cyclical but as sedimented or layered, much like a geological formation: “Historical times consist of multiple layers that refer to each other in a reciprocal way, though without being wholly dependent upon each other.”25 For a writer like Goethe, this layering of\n\nhistory permits a dialogue between the individual’s “immediate experience and mediated tradition.”26 For present purposes, Albrecht Dürer belongs both to the historical past and to the cultural present in nineteenth-century Germany. Artists and writers drilled down to the stratum of the early modern era and extracted select elements of his person and oeuvre for their current needs. More broadly, the Nuremberg master represents just one example of the probing of the past in the search for cultural identity. Marisa Bass astutely observes, “To pursue one’s lineage implies a desire to understand the history sedimented in the body as a point of origin.”27 Dürer served as one of Germany’s points of origin. The rise of a German historical consciousness acted as a catalyst to new institutions, including historical-preservation societies and museums of art and history.28 In 1819 the Society for the Study of Older German History, established in Frankfurt, founded the Monumenta Germaniae Historica, dedicated to the study of German history from the fall of the Roman Empire to 1500, which published its first volume in 1826 and still thrives today.29 Concern about the material history of the past prompted the inventorying of art-history monuments (Denkmäler) in the Prussian territories in the 1820s.30 Already in 1815 architect Karl Friedrich Schinkel authored a report “on the preservation of Denkmäler and antiquities throughout our country,” with recommendations for how to prepare inventories.31 Inspired by memories of the recent Napoleonic looting, which resulted in the losses of not just specific objects but also, due to their removal from their original locations, their historical contexts, he called for the state to fund the effort. The initial campaigns occurred in Prussia beginning in 1821. The publication of often highly detailed, scholarly Kunstdenkmäler volumes, done on local and\n\n7/27/20 10:56 AM\n\nPreludes\n\nregional bases, flourished throughout the nineteenth century and continue to be compiled in the twenty-first century.32 Reporting in 1844 on the success of German historical societies in preserving the past, Karl August Klüpfel, a Tübingen professor, remarked, “How much the situation has improved in the past ten to twenty years! What indifference, what desire for destruction raged against the remains of the so-called ‘dark Middle Ages’ at the time of the dissolution of the German Empire, even among those whom one would count as ‘educated.’ How much was wasted back then, how much deliberately destroyed or tastelessly modernized, that today would be preserved and maintained as a holy relic.”33 Preservation efforts were mixed, depending on local interests, available specialists with appropriate expertise, and funding. Was it better to leave paintings, sculptures, and other religious objects in churches, potentially subject to neglect and ruin, or to move these into a new repository? Did the “sublime experience” of viewing an object at its original site trump other options?34 One need only think of Caspar David Friedrich’s paintings of desolate church ruins or the hundreds of nineteenth-century pictures of church interiors where priests stand before ornate altars as worshippers shuffle through gloomy interiors.35 How could this engagement with the object ever be the same once it was removed and displayed elsewhere? Or did a new alternative narrative have to be constructed?\n\nThe First “Museum” of Old German Painting\n\nConsider the challenges faced by Sulpiz and Melchior Boisserée, wealthy brothers who had been orphaned at an early age, and their friend Johann\n\nSmith, Albrecht_PRINT.indd 15\n\nBaptist Bertram, who grew up in Cologne during the French occupation.36 Between September 1803 and April 1804 the brothers, then twenty-one and eighteen, and Bertram, age twenty-eight, resided in Paris, where they lived in the Palais Holbach, the house of Friedrich Schlegel, the Romantic poet and writer, who taught them about art, literature, and philosophy. Their visits to the Musée Napoléon at the Louvre proved life changing.37 They witnessed the artistic treasures that Napoleon’s troops had seized from across Europe. Sulpiz recalled, “We didn’t have enough eyes” to see what was there.38 He remarked that one would have to make a long trip through distant lands and cities to find as many famous ancient and Christian artworks.39 The men’s preliminary thoughts about acquiring German works arose during this visit. Upon returning to Cologne, the young men reacted to the ecclesiastical secularization and the physical destruction of many churches by collecting medieval German art. Sulpiz later explained how they began purchasing art:\n\n15\n\nIt happened a few months after our return [from Paris], when we were walking with Schlegel on the Neumarkt, the city’s largest square, that we encountered a stretcher filled with all sorts of objects, including an old painting on which the golden halos of the saints shone from far. The painting, which showed the Carrying of the Cross with the weeping women and Saint Veronica, seemed to have some merit. I [. . .] asked the name of the owner, who lived there in the neighborhood; he did not know where he should leave the big picture and was happy to be rid of it for the price he asked. [. . .] to avoid any fuss or mockery we decided to take the dusty antiquity through a back door into our family’s house.40\n\n7/27/20 10:56 AM\n\nAlbrecht Dürer and the Embodiment of Genius\n\n16\n\nFig. 4 Circle of the Master of the Lyversberger Passion, Christ\n\nCarrying the Cross, ca. 1470.

Photo © Bayerische Staatsgemäldesammlungen München.\n\nHis words express a certain embarrassment that neighbors might see him with this example of “dusty antiquity.” This large painting, measuring 164.8 by 220.6 cm, is thought to have come from St. Gertrud in Cologne (fig. 4).41 The men soon overcame their initial hesitancy as they actively sought paintings in Cologne and from the surrounding Lower Rhine\n\nSmith, Albrecht_PRINT.indd 16\n\nregion, including Early Netherlandish art, which then was considered part of this German heritage. Among their treasures was the Adoration of the Magi Altarpiece (ca. 1455) from St. Columba in Cologne, which they attributed to Jan van Eyck (ca. 1390– 1441) and is now recognized as a masterpiece by Rogier van der Weyden (1399/1400–1464).42 Meanwhile, in another of his influential essays, Schlegel praised the “old Cologne school,” in particular the Dombild Altarpiece, or Adoration of the Magi Altarpiece, in Cologne Cathedral, which he ascribed to Master Wilhelm.43\n\n7/27/20 10:56 AM\n\nPreludes\n\nIn 1810 the Boisserées and Bertram moved their collection, which eventually contained 216 pictures, to Heidelberg. They displayed the paintings in three rooms and a gallery hall in the Palais Sickingen on Karlsplatz. The collection attracted many notable visitors, from nobles, such as Emperor Franz I of Austria and Prince Metternich, to government officials and intellectuals, including Goethe, the Grimm brothers, Wilhelm von Humboldt, and Leopold von Ranke, to artists and architects, like Peter von Cornelius, Karl Friedrich Schinkel, and Antonio Canova.44 Traveling incognito, Ludwig, crown prince and later king of Bavaria (r. 1825–48), toured the collection in 1816. Beyond the growing recognition of its artistic importance, the collection was praised for its “Germanness.” Indeed, this was the first major art collection devoted solely to early German and Netherlandish paintings. The pictures were culturally significant, products of a national artistic tradition that was distinctive and wholly separate from the flourishing art in Italy. By about 1815 financial pressures prompted the Boisserée brothers and Bertram to initiate conversations with prospective buyers. Sulpiz had proposed a permanent collection or museum in Berlin. Their negotiations with Prussian government officials proved unsuccessful. The finance minister Heinrich von Bülow argued against the purchase because Berlin had enough museums already and the paintings were “small works.” Religion may have been a factor as well. Cologne remained Catholic, while much of Prussia was Protestant. Most of the paintings predated the Reformation and contained religious subjects. In late 1818 they moved their pictures to Stuttgart at the invitation of King Wilhelm I of Württemberg (r. 1816–64) and Queen Catherine. Although the public was very enthusiastic about visiting the collection, the desired sale never\n\nSmith, Albrecht_PRINT.indd 17\n\nmaterialized.45 On January 9, 1819, the sudden death of the queen, who had considered purchasing the collection, using her own funds if necessary, affected the negotiations. To help publicize their treasures, the Boisserées and Bertram hired Johann Nepomuk Strixner (1782–1855) to make lithographs of the more noteworthy pictures.46 They were inspired by Strixner’s lithographic reproductions of the Bavarian royal collection in Munich and Schleißheim, which started to appear in print in 1815. Beginning in 1821 Strixner created thirty-eight sets, each with three pictures, for 114 reproductions. Each print included the picture’s subject, attribution, and approximate date. While some of the attributions and dates were subsequently corrected, this information remains invaluable for what it reveals about the state of research during the first quarter of the nineteenth century. After extensive negotiations, they sold the collection on February 12, 1827, for 240,000 guilders to Ludwig I, king of Bavaria, who had admired it years earlier.47 In Munich their pictures were merged into the vastly larger royal collection. Many of the finest paintings were displayed in the Alte Pinakothek when it opened in 1836. Johann Georg von Dillis, Ludwig I’s gallery director, incorporated these into his ambitious scheme of hanging paintings according to nation and school.48 The Alte Pinakothek was envisioned, much like the Louvre, as a national museum encompassing the best of early modern European painting. The art of Cologne and the Lower Rhine was now just one chapter of this broader historical narrative. About 270 pictures were displayed in two large rooms and eight smaller cabinets.49 The Boisserée and Bertram collection, while well represented, lost its unique character even while contributing invaluably to the nucleus of the new Munich museum. Dillis sent about thirty of\n\n17\n\n7/27/20 10:56 AM\n\nAlbrecht Dürer and the Embodiment of Genius\n\n18\n\nSmith, Albrecht_PRINT.indd 18\n\ntheir paintings to the Moritzkapelle in Nuremberg.50 Others were distributed to sites around Bavaria. The Boisserées’ travails illustrate an uncertainty or ambivalence about collecting older German art, much of which was anonymous and unfamiliar. The merits of Italian Renaissance art and ancient Greek art, which Giorgio Vasari (1511–1574) and Johann Joachim Winckelmann (1717–1768) respectively had done so much to champion, were widely recognized by connoisseurs and scholars alike. Fitting German art into the collecting desiderata or coherently into the canon of art history was just beginning at that time. Friedrich Schlegel observed, “Old German painting is superior to the Italian, not only in its more exact and painstaking technical execution, but also in its longer attachment to the oldest, most marvellous, profound, Christian-Catholic symbols,\n\nof which it has preserved a far greater wealth.”51 With the establishment of new museums, efforts to preserve and study older German art grew dramatically. Romantics admired these works as expressing the same sort of pious faith and distinctive national character that they attributed to the great Gothic cathedrals, such as Strasbourg and Cologne. Not surprisingly, Sulpiz Boisserée campaigned tirelessly to raise interest and funding to finish the construction of the Cologne Cathedral, a monumental enterprise achieved between 1842 and 1880.52 The very act of looking to the past, whether to Cologne’s Gothic masterpieces or to the art of Albrecht Dürer, was to make Germans aware of their proud heritage while also offering inspirational models for moving contemporary German culture forward.\n\n7/27/20 10:56 AM\n\nChapter 2\n\nSelf-Fashioning and the Early Cult of Albrecht Dürer\n\nL\n\nong before the nineteenth century, Dürer was literally and figuratively the face of German art. From at least 1563 until 1852, stone portrait busts of Dürer and Jan van Eyck decorated the façade of the house at Lange Nieuwstraat 29 in Antwerp (fig. 5).1 The residence belonged to the painter Jan Adriaensen, who in 1545 and 1549 was dean of the Guild of Saint Luke. In 1549 he bequeathed his house to the guild as a meeting place. Prints from 1830 and 1849 document its appearance before the building was demolished in 1852. The façade, redecorated in 1563, displayed a classical doorway with figures of Mercury, god of trade, and Minerva, protectress of the arts, and, above, an allegory of painting, a female seated at her easel, flanked by these two busts. Dürer’s likeness, which is based on Hans Schwarz’s 1520 portrait medal (fig. 13), is inscribed with his name and “germanorvm / decvs” (the glory of Germany). Van Eyck’s depiction derives from one of the riders in the Just Judges panel of the Ghent Altarpiece (1432) that was long thought to be a self-portrait. The sculpture bears the texts of his name and “belgarvm splendor” (the splendor,\n\nSmith, Albrecht_PRINT.indd 19\n\nor brilliance, of Belgium). The pair are honored as the leaders of their respective schools of art. Dürer’s almost yearlong stay in Antwerp in 1520–21 certainly enhanced his local fame and association with the city’s artists. Portraits of Dürer and Van Eyck bearing these same phrases also once adorned a now-lost elaborate silver ceremonial goblet, dated 1549, owned by Antwerp’s Guild of Saint Luke.2 The busts are undated but were likely made either at the same time as or not long after the goblet. Matthias Mende has suggested the busts originally were displayed within the house and only added to the exterior when the façade was redone in 1563.3 In any event, these sculptures initiated what would become a long tradition of glorifying Dürer, either alone or in concert with another master, in an architectural context. The Nuremberg master cultivated and achieved an unprecedented level of recognition and fame during his lifetime. Dürer was a painter, printmaker, draftsman, designer, theoretician, poet, imperial court artist, city councilor, and friend of nobles, humanists, and artists alike. His art, especially his printmaking, was known and eagerly collected\n\n7/27/20 10:56 AM\n\nAlbrecht Dürer and the Embodiment of Genius\n\n20\n\nFig. 5 Willem van den Broecke or Antwerp sculptor, Albrecht\n\nDürer, ca. 1550–60.

His AD monogram, much like a modern commercial trademark, was widely used and, within the limits of contemporary law, jealously guarded. Yet in spite of his efforts, his art and monogram were copied, forged, and appropriated in other ways. Dürer painted at least three independent self-portraits, and another four are set very\n\nSmith, Albrecht_PRINT.indd 20\n\nprominently within altarpieces originally located in Venice, Wittenberg, Frankfurt, and Nuremberg.4 The single pictures today in Paris (1493), Madrid (1498; fig. 6), and Munich (1500; fig. 3) were private works that remained in his possession.5 Dürer carefully crafted each as a statement of self through his choice of pose, clothing, and accompanying texts. Artistic skill is wedded with knowledge and invention. The Munich portrait’s intentionality and its Christlike associations have been smartly addressed by Joseph Koerner and many other scholars.6 For present purposes, I am more interested in these likenesses as commemorative images or portraits, memorials that will last long after the flesh-andblood Albrecht Dürer has died. He was aware of his own mortality. He inscribed the Munich picture with his monogram, the date of 1500, and the following text: “Albertus Durerus Noricus / ipsum me proprijs sic effin- / gebam coloribus aetatis / anno xxviii” (I, Albrecht Dürer of Nuremberg, painted myself thus, with undying colors [or, with my own colors], at the age of twenty-eight years). The word proprius can carry a double sense of “own” and “immortal.”7 If his colors are undying, then so is his portrait, the everlasting product of his hand and record of his carefully conceived visage. Dürer might die, but his art and memory live on. This portrait, created as a highly personal statement of self, was given, likely by the artist near the end of his life, to the city hall in Nuremberg.8 Its audience and context changed. Karel van Mander reported seeing either this Munich portrait or a replica when he visited Nuremberg in 1577. Dürer’s sense of his own self-worth and of the benefits of self-promotion were even more pronounced during his 1505–7 trip to Venice and in the years that immediately followed, when he prominently included his likeness in four significant\n\n7/27/20 10:56 AM\n\nSelf-Fashioning and the Early Cult of Albrecht Dürer\n\naltarpieces. In these he is both creator and fictive participant. The Feast of the Rose Garlands (1506), painted for the German merchants’ Church of San Bartolomeo in Venice, shows Dürer standing at the back right, behind the Virgin and Child and kneeling donors (fig. 7).9 He wears an expensive fur-trimmed robe and looks directly out at the viewer. His hands hold a sheet of paper identifying him as “Albertus Durer Germanus” (Albrecht Dürer the German) as if to prove that a German artist could paint so beautifully. His pride in the picture is evident in the letters he sent from Venice to Willibald Pirckheimer in Nuremberg. Writing on September 8, 1506, Dürer bragged, “I’ve shut the mouths of the [Venetian] painters who said I was good at engraving but had no idea how to use colours in painting. Now everyone’s saying they’ve never seen finer colours.”10 In the Martyrdom of the Ten Thousand (1508) he stands beside Conrad Celtis, the recently deceased imperial poet laureate (fig. 8).11 Dürer is more soberly dressed in black, befitting both the death of his friend and the gruesome tortures of Christians that surround them. The artist again stares at the viewer. “Albertus Dürer alemanus” (the German), reads the text on a large sheet supported on a messenger’s stick. Friedrich III the Wise, elector of Saxony (r. 1486–1525), commissioned the altarpiece presumably for the palace church in Wittenberg. Emperor Rudolf II (r. 1576–1612) acquired the Martyrdom of the Ten Thousand in 1600 and the Feast of the Rose Garlands in 1606 for his art collection in Prague. Dürer set himself apart from other figures in the remaining two altarpieces. The Assumption and Coronation of the Virgin (or Heller Altarpiece; 1507–9) was painted for Jakob Heller, a successful Frankfurt merchant (fig. 9).12 It adorned the altar\n\nSmith, Albrecht_PRINT.indd 21\n\nFig. 6 Albrecht Dürer, Self-Portrait, 1498.

The central panel was purchased in 1614 by Duke Maximilian I of Bavaria (r. 1597–1651) and transported to Munich, where it burned in the Residenz fire in 1729. In partial satisfaction of the terms of the acquisition, Maximilian paid for a copy of this panel to be made by Jobst Harrich in 1613–14 to replace the original. Harrich’s replica and the original wings,\n\n7/27/20 10:56 AM\n\nAlbrecht Dürer and the Embodiment of Genius\n\n22\n\nFig. 7 Albrecht Dürer, Feast of the Rose Garlands, 1506, detail.

While the apostles gather around the Virgin Mary’s empty tomb, the artist appears behind. He wears a knee-length blue robe with a trim of brown fur and a black beret. He looks confidently out. Instead of a simple sheet of paper, he holds a wooden board, reaching almost from the ground to his waist. The inscription is again “Albertus Durer Alemanus” with the date and his monogram. Dürer has portrayed himself as a pious Christian and as the skilled artist of this painting.\n\nThe most influential altarpiece, at least in terms of its self-portrait’s afterlife, is the All Saints’ Altarpiece (Adoration of the Holy Trinity, Landauer Altarpiece; 1511), now in the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna (figs. 10–11).13 Matthäus Landauer, an affluent Nuremberg copper merchant and entrepreneur, commissioned the painting and its elaborately carved wooden frame for the single altar of the chapel of the Zwölfbrüderhaus, or Twelve Brothers’ house, a charitable home for a dozen destitute aging craftsmen.

Dürer is literally alone, as if he were the only person left on the earth. His isolation in the lower right foreground draws the viewer’s attention. Dürer’s brownish-gray robe reaches to his feet. It is ornamented with brown and black fur trim, brown fur lining, and horizontal bands of black fur. His deep-red cap matches his stockings, while his shirt is a lighter red. The artist has devoted considerable care to his likeness. His head turns slightly to look at the viewer. The wooden sign, now a veritable billboard, is inscribed “albertvs dvrer noricvs” (Albrecht Dürer of Nuremberg) plus 1511 and his monogram. Rudolf II purchased this painting in 1585, the first of the three altarpieces containing Dürer self-portraits that he owned. Duke Maximilian I of Bavaria owned the fourth picture. Thus the two greatest collectors of Dürer’s art possessed his likenesses. Their taste for anything by the Nuremberg master sparked the so-called Dürer Renaissance of the decades around 1600.14 Artists and other notables enjoyed at least occasional access to these princely collections, where they could study Dürer’s creations, including his self-fashioning. As the most prolific German draftsman of his day, Dürer sketched himself repeatedly. Among the most famous of these sketches is the silverpoint drawing he made in 1484, when he was about thirteen years old.15 Others from about 1491 and 1493 were studies.16 The 1493 sketch appears on a sheet with depictions of pillows on both the recto and verso. Particularly striking is the carefully observed nude self-portrait (ca. 1503) rendered in pen and brush with white highlights on a green-grounded\n\nSmith, Albrecht_PRINT.indd 23\n\nFig. 9 Jobst Harrich, Assumption and Coronation of the Virgin\n\n(Heller Altarpiece), 1613–14, detail.

These drawings plus, doubtlessly others, that do not survive were for his personal use or were shown to a limited number of family and friends. Dürer had a different purpose in mind for the self-portrait that he sent to Raphael in Rome sometime between 1510 and 1515.19 Mentioned by Giorgio Vasari in his biography of Raphael of 1550, the likeness is believed to have been a watercolor on fine canvas that could be viewed from front and back. The two masters exchanged gifts in recognition of their mutual admiration. Raphael reciprocated by sending the Nuremberg master a drawing of three nude men, to which Dürer proudly penned an inscription, “1515 Raphael of Urbino, who was held in high esteem by the pope, sent this picture of nudes to Nuremberg for Albrecht Dürer in order to show him his skill” (fig. 12).20 Raphael’s red-chalk drawing is in the Albertina Museum in Vienna. After Raphael’s death, in 1520, Dürer’s self-portrait was in the possession of Giulio Romano in Mantua, where Vasari viewed it. Joachim von Sandrart saw it in the ducal collection in Mantua a century later. Unfortunately, the portrait subsequently disappeared. This exchange between Dürer and Raphael would provide the basis for their frequent association in literature and art, including the decorations of many nineteenth-century museums. Dürer also commissioned his own portrait. In his Netherlandish journal, the artist records paying Hans Schwarz two gold gulden “für mein angesicht” (for my face) in September 1520.21 Schwarz (1492–after mid-1520s [ca. 1550?]) was an Augsburg sculptor and Germany’s first great portrait medalist. He resided in Nuremberg for\n\nSmith, Albrecht_PRINT.indd 25\n\n25\n\nFig. 12 Raphael, Study of Nude Men, 1515. Red-chalk drawing.\n\nAlbertina Museum, Vienna. Photo: Albertina Museum.\n\nabout a year in 1519–20 before scandal prompted his return to Augsburg. Schwarz’s boxwood model (Herzog Anton Ulrich-Museum, Braunschweig) was then cast in silver, bronze, and lead (fig. 13). The inscription reads, “albertvs dvrer pictor germanicvs” (Albrecht Dürer German painter). The artist is rendered with long locks that flow over his fur-trimmed robe. It is unknown how many impressions were made during the artist’s lifetime. A second edition, with a slightly different inscription, was produced before Dürer’s death in 1528. Yet another version, which praised Dürer as\n\n7/27/20 10:56 AM\n\nAlbrecht Dürer and the Embodiment of Genius\n\n26\n\nFig. 13 Hans Schwarz, Albrecht Dürer, 1520.

Already in 1519 Dürer prepared designs for his own self-portrait medal.22 His drawing for the obverse’s text and for the reverse’s text, date of 1519, and coat of arms (a shield with an open door [Tur, or door, a play on his family’s name]) is in the British Museum in London. The self-portrait drawing that once accompanied this sketch is lost. One impression of Schwarz’s medal of Dürer inspired the Augsburg sculptor Hans Daucher (ca. 1485–1538). In 1522 Daucher carved an allegorical stone relief starring Dürer (fig. 14).23 As Emperor Maximilian I and others look on, two men with\n\nSmith, Albrecht_PRINT.indd 26\n\nweapons drawn engage in mortal combat. One warrior, dressed in old-fashioned armor, sprawls on the ground. He is soon to be defeated by Dürer, whose likeness is based directly on Schwarz’s medal. The latter wears fashionable contemporary attire with decorative slit sleeves. The precise meaning of this scene remains unclear. Is Dürer defeating a personification of vice or dispatching Apelles, who, as the embodiment of old art, is now replaced by the new art of Dürer? Regardless, the relief featuring Dürer, a living artist, is a sophisticated collector’s item made for a noble or scholar. It demonstrates his fame. No text identifies him. It is his familiar likeness that communicates his identity. His flowing\n\n7/27/20 10:56 AM\n\nSelf-Fashioning and the Early Cult of Albrecht Dürer\n\nshoulder-length hair, highlighted here as it is in his self-portraits and Schwarz’s medal, becomes his defining visual feature. Melchior Lorck’s 1550 engraved portrait of Dürer, based on Schwarz’s medal, includes a long inscription, part of which reads, “Such a man you see here, with his visage and comely hair.”24 In 1527 Matthes Gebel (ca. 1500–1574) authored a second portrait medal of Dürer.25 He is shown as older, with much shorter, well-trimmed hair. His robe is cloth rather than fur-trimmed. The inscription reads, “Albrecht Dürer represented in his fifty-sixth year,” and on the reverse, “His virtue is famous 1527.”26 It is uncertain whether Dürer commissioned this second medal from Gebel or the Nuremberg sculptor made it on his own initiative as a celebrity portrait. Gebel reissued his medal in 1528 and again in 1529 as a posthumous memorial. His portrait of Dürer in turn inspired other artists, including Erhard Schön (ca. 1490–1542) of Nuremberg, whose woodcut of Dürer’s likeness first issued around 1528 enjoyed broad circulation (fig. 15).27 The design, which survives in two woodblocks now in the Princeton University Art Museum and the Albertina of Vienna, was published in Nuremberg in at least eight editions between Schön’s death and about 1590. Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, who collected Dürer’s prints, made his own pen-and-ink drawing after Schön’s portrait of the artist, whom he labeled “O manly Dürer,” in about 1828.28 Dürer’s likeness achieved a level of fame and visual familiarity unrivaled by any other early modern Northern European artist before and perhaps including Rembrandt and Rubens. He carefully crafted a distinctive identity as a pious, skilled, and highly successful artist. If in life Dürer sought to define his likeness, other artists, including Gebel, Daucher, and Schön, offered “their”\n\nSmith, Albrecht_PRINT.indd 27\n\n27\n\nFig. 15 Erhard Schön, Portrait of Albrecht Dürer, ca. 1528.

Or phrased differently, the “I” became “him” as he came increasingly to be depicted and defined by others during the last decade of his life. After April 6, 1528, control of his portrait fell exclusively and permanently into the hands and imaginations of others. Dürer, especially through his portrait, became an object to be defined and narrated by others. Which Dürer did they pick? Was it the vigorous artist of his 1500 self-portrait or the older and slightly diminished version offered by Gebel and Schön? His posthumous image became an icon of celebrity and increasingly the face of a German golden age, which with time was perceived as having slipped away.\n\n7/27/20 10:56 AM\n\nAlbrecht Dürer and the Embodiment of Genius\n\n28\n\nFig. 16 Lucas Kilian, Portrait of Albrecht Dürer, 1608.

Most were based directly or indirectly either on the artist’s own likenesses or on those made by Schwarz, Gebel, and Schön. In about 1601/2 the Nuremberg goldsmith Christoph Jamnitzer (1563–1618) crafted a dazzling gilt-silver ewer and basin for Emperor Rudolf II.29 Its program, based on\n\nSmith, Albrecht_PRINT.indd 28\n\nPetrarch’s “Triumphs,” includes the ewer’s Triumph of Fame, featuring portraits of illustrious rulers, knights, scholars, and artists. One section depicts Raphael, Pietro Bembo, Giambologna, Petrarch, Michelangelo, Dürer, Hans von Aachen(?), Wenzel Jamnitzer, and Johann Neudörfer the Elder. Dürer, whose image is based on Schwarz’s medal, and Michelangelo gaze at each other. This reunion of famous men takes place before the skyline of Nuremberg. The elegant engraved portrait of Albrecht Dürer by Lucas Kilian (1579–1637) of 1608 creatively combines elements of the older master’s art (fig. 16).30 For it Kilian has extracted the bareheaded portrait from the Feast of the Rose Garlands. In 1606 Emperor Rudolf II purchased the altarpiece from the Church of San Bartolomeo in Venice and had it carried over the Alps to Prague. Yet the engraving’s inscription informs the viewer that Kilian’s source was the replica or partial copy of the altarpiece that Hans Rottenhammer (1564–1625) made in Venice before the original was shipped.31 Kilian’s artist holds a sheet of paper inscribed with the imperial printing privilege rather than Dürer’s name. He stands behind a stone parapet with inscriptions, a compositional device that Dürer incorporated into his engraved portraits from 1519 to 1526, such as those of Willibald Pirckheimer and Philipp Melanchthon.32 When Kilian created his Double Portrait of Albrecht Dürer (also called Albrecht Dürer in the Temple of Honor) of ca. 1617 (fig. 17), he did not repeat the 1608 engraving.33 Instead, his two depictions of Dürer are based on the portraits from the Heller Altarpiece and the Adoration of the Holy Trinity Altarpiece. He wears a cap in each. The two Dürers flank a table set before a great arched portal topped with his coat of arms and open to a vaulted building beyond. Attributes of his practical\n\n7/27/20 10:56 AM\n\nSelf-Fashioning and the Early Cult of Albrecht Dürer\n\nskill and theoretical knowledge, such as a painter’s palette with brushes and a mahlstick and geometric tools, are arrayed on the table and hang from the pediment. He is commemorated as the “prince of German painting.” The text at the bottom proclaims, “vivit post fvnera virtvs” (Virtue lives even after death). Kilian likely saw the central panel of the Heller Altarpiece in the Residenz palace in Munich after its acquisition by Duke Maximilian I in 1614. Kilian’s engraving of 1608 provided the basis for subsequent replications of Dürer’s portrait in the Feast of the Rose Garlands. The most influential of these illustrates Joachim von Sandrart’s Teutsche Academie der edlen Bau-, Bild- und Mahlerey-Künste, published in 1675.34 Sandrart’s biographies of artists, the German counterpart to Vasari and van Mander’s respective accounts about Italian and Netherlandish masters, include engraved bust portraits. He carefully copied the upper half of Kilian’s Dürer while setting him before a lighter backdrop. Until the flurry of writings about Dürer around 1828, Sandrart’s biography was the most autho"
