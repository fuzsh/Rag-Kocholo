Prussia then invaded France.\n\nOn 19 September, it besieged Paris and the first Prussian troops arrived in Versailles.\n\nOn 5 October, William I and Bismarck moved into the town to prepare the proclamation of the German Empire from the Château.\n\nSince the mid-1860s, Prussia had emerged enlarged and fortified from its campaigns against Austria and Denmark.\n\nIt now extended from the Rhine to Russia.\n\nBismarck, its Chancellor, attempted to federate the other German states around Prussia in order to create an empire at the expense of the Austrian-Hungarian empire, its rival.\n\nHe wanted Germany to become the new power of central Europe, between France and Russia.\n\nHe had managed to constitute the Confederation of Northern Germany which united all the states except those of the south.\n\nHesse and Baden, followed by Bavaria and Wurtemberg finally joined in November 1870.\n\nOtto von Bismark\n\nKönig Ludwig II. von Bayern\n\nAt the request of Prussian Minister President Otto von Bismarck (and in exchange for certain financial concessions), Ludwig wrote a letter (the so-called ‘Kaiserbrie’) in December 1870 endorsing the creation of the German Empire.\n\nWith the creation of the Empire, Bavaria lost its status as an independent kingdom, and became another state in the empire.\n\nLudwig attempted to protest these alterations by refusing to attend the ceremony where Wilhelm I was proclaimed the new empire’s first emperor.\n\nWas this also out of love of the place and Louis XIV?\n\nWhatever the reason, his brother Otto negotiated in his place.\n\nHowever the Bavarian delegation under Prime Minister Count Otto von Bray-Steinburg had secured a privileged status of the Kingdom of Bavaria within the German Empire (Reservatrechte).\n\nWithin the Empire the Kingdom of Bavaria was even able to retain its own diplomatic body, and its own army, which would fall under Prussian command only in times of war.\n\n.Prinz Otto von Bayern\n\n© Copyright Peter Crawford 2013\n\nAfter the creation of the greater Germany, Ludwig increasingly withdrew from politics, and devoted himself to his personal creative projects, most famously his castles, where he personally approved every detail of the architecture, decoration and furnishing.\n\nAnd so the proclamation of German unity could be made.\n\nThe proclamation of the Empire was fixed for 18 January 1871 in the Hall of Mirrors.\n\nAn altar was set up here for the religious ceremony.\n\nA stage was installed along the side next to the Salon of War, facing the spot where the throne of Louis XIV stood.\n\n600 officers and all the German princes were present except Ludwig II of Bavaria.\n\nAfter the Te Deum, Bismarck, in his cuirassier’s uniform, read out the proclamation.\n\nWhen he had finished, the Grand-Duke of Baden shouted “Long live his Majesty the Emperor William!” The room rocked with the assembly’s “hurrahs!”.\n\nThe Chancellor had finally made his dream come true under the paintings of Le Brun glorifying the victories of Louis XIV on the Rhine.\n\nHe had also achieved his revenge for the defeat of Iena in 1806.\n\nThe Germans soon left Versailles to the elected representatives of defeated France.\n\nWappen des Königreichs Preußen\n\n© Copyright Peter Crawford 2013\n\nThe German Empire consisted of 27 constituent territories (most of them ruled by royal families).\n\nWhile the Kingdom of Prussia contained most of the population and most of the territory of the Reich, the Prussian leadership became supplanted by German leaders and Prussia itself played a lesser role.\n\nPrussia’s “political and cultural influence had diminished considerably” by the 1890s.\n\nIts three largest neighbours were rivals Imperial Russia to the east, France to the west, and ally Austria-Hungary to the south.\n\nAfter 1850, Germany industrialized rapidly, with a foundation in coal, iron (and later steel), chemicals and railways.\n\nFrom a population of 41 million people in 1871, it grew to 68 million in 1913.\n\nFrom a heavily rural nation in 1815, it was now predominantly urban.\n\nDuring its 47 years of existence, the German Empire operated as an industrial, technological and scientific giant, receiving more Nobel Prizes in science than Britain, France, Russia and the United States combined.\n\nDropping the Pilot\n\nIt became a great power, boasting a rapidly growing economy and the world’s strongest army and its navy went from being negligible to second only behind the Royal Navy in less than a decade.\n\nAfter the removal of the powerful Chancellor Otto von Bismarck in 1890 following the death of Emperor Wilhelm I, the young Emperor Wilhelm II engaged in increasingly reckless foreign policies that left the Empire politically isolated.\n\nIts network of small colonies in Africa and the Pacific paled in comparison to the British and French empires.\n\nWhen the great crisis of 1914 arrived, it had only two weak allies (Austria-Hungary and Ottoman Empire) left.\n\nIn World War I its plans to quickly capture Paris in 1914 failed and the Western Front (against Britain and France) became a stalemate.\n\nThe Allied naval blockade made for increasing shortages of food.\n\nThe Empire collapsed overnight in the November 1918 Revolution as all the royals abdicated and a republic took over.\n\n© Copyright Peter Crawford 2013\n\nTHE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE DEUTSCHES KAISERREICH\n\nOn 10 December 1870 the North German Confederation Reichstag renamed the Confederation as the German Empire and gave the title of German Emperor to the King of Prussia as President of the Confederation.\n\nKönig Wilhelm I von Preußen\n\nDuring the Siege of Paris on 18 January 1871, King Wilhelm I of Prussia was proclaimed German Emperor in the Hall of Mirrors at the Palace of Versailles.\n\nThe 1871 German Constitution was adopted by the Reichstag on 14 April 1871 and proclaimed by the Emperor on 16 April, which was substantially based upon Bismarck’s North German Constitution.\n\nGermany acquired some democratic features.\n\nThe new empire had a parliament called the Reichstag, which was elected by universal male suffrage, however, the original constituencies drawn in 1871 were never redrawn to reflect the growth of urban areas.\n\nAs a result, by the time of the great expansion of German cities in the 1890s and first decade of the 20th century, rural areas were grossly overrepresented.\n\nLegislation also required the consent of the Bundesrat, the federal council of deputies from the states. Executive power was vested in the emperor, or Kaiser, who was assisted by a chancellor responsible only to him.\n\nThe emperor was given extensive powers by the constitution.\n\nHe alone appointed and dismissed the chancellor, was supreme commander-in-chief of the armed forces, and final arbiter of all foreign affairs.\n\nOfficially, the chancellor was a one-man cabinet and was responsible for the conduct of all state affairs; in practice, the State Secretaries (bureaucratic top officials in charge of such fields as finance, war, foreign affairs, etc.) acted as unofficial portfolio ministers.\n\nReichstag\n\nThe Reichstag had the power to pass, amend or reject bills and to initiate legislation.\n\nAlthough nominally a league of equals, in practice the empire was dominated by the largest and most powerful state, Prussia.\n\nIt stretched across the northern two thirds of the new Reich, and contained three fifths of its population.\n\nThe imperial crown was hereditary in the House of Hohenzollern, the ruling house of Prussia.\n\nWith the exception of the years 1872–1873 and 1892–1894, the chancellor was always simultaneously the prime minister of Prussia.\n\nWith 17 out of 58 votes in the Bundesrat, Berlin needed only a few votes from the small states to exercise effective control.\n\nThe other states retained their own governments, but had only limited aspects of sovereignty.\n\nFor example, both postage stamps and currency were issued for the empire as a whole.\n\nCoins through one mark was also minted in the name of the empire, while higher valued pieces were issued by the states, but these larger gold and silver issues were virtually commemorative coins and had limited circulation.\n\nWhile the states issued their own decorations, and some had their own armies, the military forces of the smaller ones were put under Prussian control.\n\nThose of the larger states, such as the Kingdoms of Bavaria and Saxony, were coordinated along Prussian principles and would in wartime be controlled by the federal government.\n\nThe evolution of the German Empire is somewhat in line with parallel developments in Italy which became a united nation state shortly before the German Empire.\n\nCoat of Arms of the Russian Empire\n\n© Copyright Peter Crawford 2013\n\nSome key elements of the German Empire’s authoritarian political structure were also the basis for conservative modernization in Imperial Japan under Meiji and the preservation of an authoritarian political structure under the Tsars in the Russian Empire.\n\nOne factor in the social anatomy of these governments had been the retention of a very substantial share in political power by the landed elite, the Junkers, resulting from the absence of a revolutionary breakthrough by the peasants in combination with urban areas.\n\nAlthough authoritarian in many respects, the empire permitted the development of political parties. Bismarck’s intention was to create a constitutional façade which would mask the continuation of authoritarian policies.\n\nIn the process, he created a system with a serious flaw.\n\nThere was a significant disparity between the Prussian and German electoral systems.\n\nPrussia used a highly restrictive three-class voting system in which the richest third of the population could choose 85% of the legislature, all but assuring a conservative majority.\n\nAs mentioned above, the king and (with two exceptions) the prime minister of Prussia were also the emperor and chancellor of the empire – meaning that the same rulers had to seek majorities from legislatures elected from completely different franchises.\n\n© Copyright Peter Crawford 2013\n\nCONSTITUENT STATES\n\nBefore unification, German territory was made up of 27 constituent states.\n\nThese states consisted of kingdoms, grand duchies, duchies, principalities, free Hanseatic cities and one imperial territory.\n\nThe Kingdom of Prussia was the largest of the constituent states, covering some 60% of the territory of the German Empire.\n\nSeveral of these states had gained sovereignty following the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire.\n\nOthers were created as sovereign states after the Congress of Vienna in 1815.\n\nTerritories were not necessarily contiguous – many existed in several parts, as a result of historical acquisition, or, in several cases, divisions of the ruling family trees.\n\nSome of the existing states, in particular Hanover, were abolished and annexed by Prussia as a result of the war of 1866.\n\nEach component of the German Empire sent representatives to the Federal Council (Bundesrat) and, via single member districts, the Imperial Diet (Reichstag).\n\nRelations between the Imperial centre and the Empire’s components were somewhat fluid, and were developed on an ongoing basis.\n\nThe extent to which the Emperor could, for example, intervene on occasions of disputed or unclear succession was much debated on occasion – for example with the Lippe-Detmold inheritance crisis.\n\n© Copyright Peter Crawford 2013\n\nTHE ECONOMY UNDER BISMARK\n\nRailways\n\nMünchen Hauptbahnhof\n\nLacking a technological base at first, the Germans imported their engineering and hardware from Britain, but quickly learned the skills needed to operate and expand the railways.\n\nIn many cities, the new railway shops were the centres of technological awareness and training, so that by 1850, Germany was self-sufficient in meeting the demands of railroad construction, and the railways were a major impetus for the growth of the new steel industry, however, German unification in 1870 stimulated consolidation, nationalisation into state-owned companies, and further rapid growth.\n\nGerman Railways\n\nUnlike the situation in France, the goal was support of industrialisation, and so heavy lines crisscrossed the Ruhr and other industrial districts, and provided good connections to the major ports of Hamburg and Bremen.\n\nBy 1880, Germany had 9,400 locomotives pulling 43,000 passengers and 30,000 tons of freight, and forged ahead of France.\n\nIndustrialisation\n\nGermany before 1800 was heavily rural, with some urban trade centers.\n\nIn the 19th century it began a stage of rapid economic growth and modernization, led by heavy industry.\n\nBy 1900 it had the largest economy in Europe.\n\nBefore 1850 Germany lagged far behind the leaders in industrial development, Britain, France and Belgium. By mid-century however, the German states were catching up, and by 1900 Germany was a world leader in industrialization, along with Britain and the United States.\n\nIn 1800, Germany’s social structure was poorly suited to entrepreneurship or economic development. Domination by France during the era of the French Revolution (1790s to 1815), produced important institutional reforms, including the abolition of feudal restrictions on the sale of large landed estates, the reduction of the power of the guilds in the cities, and the introduction of a new, more efficient commercial law.\n\nNevertheless, traditionalism remained strong in most of Germany.\n\nUntil midcentury, the guilds, the landed aristocracy, the churches, and the government bureaucracies had so many rules and restrictions that entrepreneurship was held in low esteem, and given little opportunity to develop.\n\nFrom the 1830s and 1840s, Prussia, Saxony, and other states reorganized agriculture, introducing sugar beets, turnips, and potatoes, yielding a higher level of food production that enabled a surplus rural population to move to industrial areas.\n\nThe beginnings of the industrial revolution in Germany came in the textile industry, and was facilitated by eliminating tariff barriers through the Zollverein, starting in 1834.\n\nThe take-off stage of economic development came with the railroad revolution in the 1840s, which opened up new markets for local products, created a pool of middle manager, increased the demand for engineers, architects and skilled machinists and stimulated investments in coal and iron.\n\nThe political decisions about the economy of Prussia (and after 1871 all Germany) were largely controlled by a coalition of “rye and iron”, that is the Junker landowners of the east and the heavy industry of the west.\n\nIndustrialization progressed dynamically in Germany and German manufacturers began to capture domestic markets from British imports, and also to compete with British industry abroad, particularly in the U.S.\n\nThe German textiles and metal industries had by 1870 surpassed those of Britain in organization and technical efficiency and superseded British manufacturers in the domestic market.\n\nGermany became the dominant economic power on the continent and was the second largest exporting nation after Britain.\n\nBanks and Cartels\n\nGerman banks played central roles in financing German industry.\n\nDifferent banks formed cartels in different industries.\n\nCartel contracts were accepted as legal and binding by German courts although they were held to be illegal in Britain and the United States.\n\nThe process of cartelization began slowly, but the cartel movement took hold after 1873 in the economic depression that followed the postunification speculative bubble.\n\nIt began in heavy industry and spread throughout other industries.\n\nBy 1900 there were 275 cartels in operation; by 1908, over 500.\n\nBy some estimates, different cartel arrangements may have numbered in the thousands at different times, but many German companies stayed outside the cartels because they did not welcome the restrictions that membership imposed.\n\nThe government played a powerful role in the industrialization of the German Empire.\n\nIt supported not only heavy industry but also crafts and trades because it wanted to maintain prosperity in all parts of the empire.\n\nEven where the national government did not act, the highly autonomous regional and local governments supported their own industries.\n\nEach state tried to be as self-sufficient as possible.\n\nDespite the several ups and downs of prosperity and depression that marked the first decades of the German Empire, the ultimate wealth of the empire proved immense.\n\nGerman aristocrats, landowners, bankers, and producers created what might be termed the first German economic miracle, the turn-of-the-century surge in German industry and commerce during which bankers, industrialists, mercantilists, the military, and the monarchy joined forces.\n\nTechnology\n\nTechnological progress during German industrialization occurred in four waves: the railway wave (1877–86), the dye wave (1887–96), the chemical wave (1897–1902), and the wave of electrical engineering (1903–18).\n\nSince Germany industrialized later than Britain, it was able to model its factories after those of Britain, thus making more efficient use of its capital and avoiding legacy methods in its leap to the envelope of technology. Germany invested more heavily than the British in research, especially in chemistry, motors and electricity. Germany’s dominance in physics and chemistry was such that one-third of all Nobel Prizes went to German inventors and researchers.\n\nThe German cartel system (known as Konzerne), being significantly concentrated, was able to make more efficient use of capital.\n\nGermany was not weighted down with an expensive worldwide empire that needed defense.\n\nFollowing Germany’s annexation of Alsace-Lorraine in 1871, it absorbed parts of what had been France’s industrial base.\n\nBASF Ludwigschafen Works\n\nBy 1900, the German chemical industry dominated the world market for synthetic dyes.\n\nThe three major firms BASF, Bayer and Hoechst produced several hundred different dyes, along with the five smaller firms.\n\nIn 1913, these eight firms produced almost 90% of the world supply of dyestuffs and sold about 80% of their production abroad.\n\nThe three major firms had also integrated upstream into the production of essential raw materials and they began to expand into other areas of chemistry such as pharmaceuticals, photographic film, agricultural chemicals and electrochemicals.\n\nTop-level decision-making was in the hands of professional salaried managers; leading Chandler to call the German dye companies “the world’s first truly managerial industrial enterprises”.\n\nThere were many spin-offs from research—such as the pharmaceutical industry, which emerged from chemical research.\n\nBy the start of World War I (1914–1918), German industry switched to war production.\n\nThe heaviest demands were on coal and steel for artillery and shell production, and on chemicals for the synthetization of materials that were subject to import restrictions and for chemical weapons and war supplies.\n\n© Copyright Peter Crawford 2013\n\nSOCIAL ISSUES UNDER BISMARK\n\nGermany’s middle class, based in the cities, grew exponentially, but it never gained the political power it had in France, Britain or the United States.\n\nThe Association of German Women’s Organizations (BDF) was established in 1894 to encompass the proliferating women’s organizations that had sprung up since the 1860s.\n\nFrom the beginning the BDF was a bourgeois organization, its members working toward equality with men in such areas as education, financial opportunities, and political life.\n\nWorking-class women were not welcome; they were organized by the Socialists.\n\nGerman City Street Scene\n\nBismarck built on a tradition of welfare programs in Prussia and Saxony that began as early as in the 1840s.\n\nIn the 1880s he introduced old age pensions, accident insurance, medical care and unemployment insurance that formed the basis of the modern European welfare state.\n\nHis paternalistic programs won the support of German industry because its goals were to win the support of the working classes for the Empire and reduce the outflow of immigrants to America, where wages were higher, but welfare did not exist.\n\nBismarck further won the support of both industry and skilled workers by his high tariff policies, which protected profits and wages from American competition, although they alienated the liberal intellectuals who wanted free trade.\n\nAfter achieving formal unification in 1871, Bismarck devoted much of his attention to the cause of national unity under the ideology of Prussianism.\n\nHe opposed conservative Catholic activism and emancipation, especially the powers of the Vatican under Pope Pius IX, and working class radicalism, represented by the emerging Social Democratic Party.\n\nKulturkampf\n\nPrussia in 1871 included 16,000,000 Protestants, both Reformed and Lutheran, and 8,000,000 Catholics. Most people were generally segregated into their own religious worlds, living in rural districts or city neighborhoods that were overwhelmingly of the same religion, and sending their children to separate public schools where their religion was taught.\n\nThere was little interaction or intermarriage.\n\nOn the whole, the Protestants had a higher social status, and the Catholics were more likely to be peasant farmers or unskilled or semiskilled industrial workers.\n\nPope Pius IX\n\nIn 1870, the Catholics formed their own political party, the Centre Party, which generally supported unification and most of Bismarck’s policies, however, Bismarck distrusted parliamentary democracy in general and opposition parties in particular, especially when the Centre Party showed signs of gaining support among dissident elements such as the Polish Catholics in Silesia.\n\nA powerful intellectual force of the time was anti-Catholicism, led by the liberal intellectuals who formed a vital part of Bismarck’s coalition.\n\nThey saw the Catholic Church as a powerful force of reaction and anti-modernity, especially after the proclamation of papal infallibility in 1870, and the tightening control of the Vatican over the local bishops.\n\nThe Kulturkampf launched by Bismarck 1871–1880 affected Prussia; although there were similar movements in Baden and Hesse, the rest of Germany was not affected.\n\nAccording to the new imperial constitution, the states were in charge of religious and educational affairs; they funded the Protestant and Catholic schools.\n\nGerman Junior School\n\nIn July 1871 Bismarck abolished the Catholic section of the Prussian Ministry of ecclesiastical and educational affairs, depriving Catholics of their voice at the highest level.\n\nThe system of strict government supervision of schools was applied only in Catholic areas; the Protestant schools were left alone.\n\nMuch more serious were the May laws of 1873.\n\nOne made the appointment of any priest dependent on his attendance at a German university, as opposed to the seminaries that the Catholics typically used.\n\nFurthermore, all candidates for the ministry had to pass an examination in German culture before a state board which weeded out intransigent Catholics.\n\nAnother provision gave the government a veto power over most church activities.\n\nA second law abolished the jurisdiction of the Vatican over the Catholic Church in Prussia; its authority was transferred to a government body controlled by Protestants.\n\nNearly all German bishops, clergy, and laymen rejected the legality of the new laws, and were defiant in the face of heavier and heavier penalties and imprisonments imposed by Bismarck’s government by 1876, all the Prussian bishops were imprisoned or in exile, and a third of the Catholic parishes were without a priest.\n\nIn the face of systematic defiance, the Bismarck government increased the penalties and its attacks, and were challenged in 1875 when a papal encyclical declared the whole ecclesiastical legislation of Prussia was invalid, and threatened to excommunicate any Catholic who obeyed.\n\nThere was no violence, but the Catholics mobilized their support, set up numerous civic organizations, raised money to pay fines, and rallied behind their church and the Centre Party.\n\nThe government had set up an “Old-Catholic Church,” which attracted only a few thousand members. Bismarck, a devout pietistic Protestant, realized his Kulturkampf was backfiring when secular and socialist elements used the opportunity to attack all religion.\n\nIn the long run, the most significant result was the mobilization of the Catholic voters, and their insistence on protecting their religious identity.\n\nIn the elections of 1874, the Centre party doubled its popular vote, and became the second-largest party in the national parliament—and remained a powerful force for the next 60 years, so that after Bismarck it became difficult to form a government without their support.\n\nSocial Reform\n\nBismarck built on a tradition of welfare programs in Prussia and Saxony that began as early as in the 1840s. In the 1880s he introduced old age pensions, accident insurance, medical care and unemployment insurance that formed the basis of the modern European welfare state.\n\nHe came to realize that this sort of policy was very appealing, since it bound workers to the state, and also fit in very well with his authoritarian nature.\n\nThe social security systems installed by Bismarck (health care in 1883, accident insurance in 1884, invalidity and old-age insurance in 1889) at the time were the largest in the world and, to a degree, still exist in Germany today.\n\nBismarck’s paternalistic programs won the support of German industry because its goals were to win the support of the working classes for the Empire and reduce the outflow of immigrants to America, where wages were higher but welfare did not exist.\n\nBismarck further won the support of both industry and skilled workers by his high tariff policies, which protected profits and wages from American competition, although they alienated the liberal intellectuals who wanted free trade.\n\nGermanisation\n\nRathaus Posen – 1900\n\nOne of the effects of the unification policies was the gradually increasing tendency to eliminate the use of non-German languages in public life, schools and academic settings with the intent of pressuring the non-German population to abandon their national identity in what was called “Germanization”.\n\nThese policies had often the reverse effect of stimulating resistance, usually in the form of home schooling and tighter unity in the minority groups, especially the Poles.\n\nThe Germanization policies were targeted particularly against the significant Polish minority of the empire, gained by Prussia in the Partitions of Poland.\n\nPoles were treated as a ethnic minority even where they made up the majority, as in the Province of Posen, where a series of anti-Polish measures was enforced.\n\nNumerous anti-Polish laws had no great effect especially in the province of Posen where the German-speaking population dropped from 42.8% in 1871 to 38.1% in 1905, despite all efforts.\n\nLaw\n\nBismarck’s efforts also initiated the levelling of the enormous differences between the German states, which had been independent in their evolution for centuries, especially with legislation.\n\nThe completely different legal histories and judicial systems posed enormous complications, especially for national trade.\n\nWhile a common trade code had already been introduced by the Confederation in 1861 (which was adapted for the Empire and, with great modifications, is still in effect today), there was little similarity in laws otherwise.\n\nIn 1871, a common Criminal Code (Reichsstrafgesetzbuch) was introduced; in 1877, common court procedures were established in the court system (Gerichtsverfassungsgesetz), civil procedures (Zivilprozessordnung) and criminal procedures (Strafprozessordnung).\n\nIn 1873 the constitution was amended to allow the Empire to replace the various and greatly differing Civil Codes of the states (If they existed at all; for example, parts of Germany formerly occupied by Napoleon’s France had adopted the French Civil Code, while in Prussia the Allgemeines Preußisches Landrecht of 1794 was still in effect).\n\nIn 1881, a first commission was established to produce a common Civil Code for all of the Empire, an enormous effort that would produce the Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch (BGB), possibly one of the most impressive legal works of the world; it was eventually put into effect on 1 January 1900.\n\nIt speaks volumes for the conceptual quality of these codifications that they all, albeit with many amendments, are still in effect today.\n\n© Copyright Peter Crawford 2013\n\nYEAR OF THE THREE EMPERORS\n\nKaiser Frederich III\n\nKaiser Wilhelm I\n\nOn 9 March 1888, Wilhelm I died shortly before his 91st birthday, leaving his son Frederick III as the new emperor.\n\nFrederick was a liberal and an admirer of the British constitution, while his links to Britain strengthened further with his marriage to Princess Victoria, eldest child of Queen Victoria.\n\nWith his ascent to the throne, many hoped that Frederick’s reign would lead to a liberalisation of the Reich and an increase of parliament’s influence on the political process.\n\nThe dismissal of Robert von Puttkamer, the highly-conservative Prussian interior minister, on 8 June was a sign of the expected direction and a blow to Bismarck’s administration.\n\nBy the time of his accession, however, Frederick had developed incurable laryngeal cancer, which had been diagnosed in 1887.\n\nHe died on the 99th day of his rule, on 15 June 1888.\n\nHis son Wilhelm II became Kaiser.\n\n© Copyright Peter Crawford 2013\n\nWILHELMINE ERA\n\nKaiser Wilhelm II\n\nWilhelm II sought to reassert his ruling prerogatives at a time when other monarchs in Europe were being transformed into constitutional figureheads.\n\nThis decision led the ambitious Kaiser into conflict with Bismarck.\n\nThe old chancellor had hoped to guide Wilhelm as he had guided his grandfather, but the emperor wanted to be the master in his own house and had many sycophants telling him that Frederick the Great would not have been great with a Bismarck at his side.\n\nOtto Eduard Leopold Fürst von Bismarck\n\nHerzog von Lauenburg\n\nA key difference between Wilhelm II and Bismarck was their approaches to handling political crises, especially in 1889, when German coal miners went on strike in Upper Silesia.\n\nOtto Eduard Leopold, Prince of Bismarck, Duke of Lauenburg (1 April 1815 – 30 July 1898), simply known as Otto von Bismarck, was a conservative German statesman who dominated European affairs from the 1860s to his dismissal in 1890. In 1871, after a series of short victorious wars, he unified most of the German states (whilst excluding some, most notably Austria) into a powerful German Empire under Prussian leadership. This created a balance of power that preserved peace in Europe from 1871 until 1914.\n\nAs ‘Minister President of Prussia’ 1862–90, Bismarck provoked wars that made Prussia dominant over Austria and France, and lined up the smaller German states behind Prussia. In 1867 he also became Chancellor of the North German Confederation. Otto von Bismarck became the first Chancellor of a united Germany after the 1871 Treaty of Versailles and largely controlled its affairs until he was removed by Kaiser Wilhelm II in 1890. His diplomacy of Realpolitik and powerful rule gained him the nickname the “Iron Chancellor“.\n\nBismarck demanded that the German Army be sent in to crush the strike, but Wilhelm II rejected this authoritarian measure, responding “I do not wish to stain my reign with the blood of my subjects.“\n\nInstead of condoning repression, Wilhelm had the government negotiate with a delegation from the coal miners, which brought the strike to an end without violence.\n\nThe fractious relationship ended in March 1890, after Wilhelm II and Bismarck quarrelled, and the chancellor resigned days later.\n\nBismarck’s last few years had seen power slip from his hands as he grew older, more irritable, more authoritarian, and less focused.\n\nGerman politics had become progressively more chaotic, and the chancellor understood this better than anyone, but unlike Wilhelm II and his generation, Bismarck knew well that an ungovernable country with an adventurous foreign policy was a recipe for disaster.\n\nWith Bismarck’s departure, Wilhelm II became the dominant ruler of Germany.\n\nWalther Rathenau\n\nUnlike his grandfather, Wilhelm I, who had been largely content to leave government affairs to the chancellor, Wilhelm II wanted to be fully informed and actively involved in running Germany, not an ornamental figurehead.\n\nWilhelm allowed politician Walther Rathenau to tutor him in European economics and industrial and financial realities in Europe.\n\nWalther Rathenau (September 29, 1867 – June 24, 1922) was a German industrialist, politician, writer, and statesman who served as Foreign Minister of Germany during the Weimar Republic. He was assassinated on June 24, 1922, two months after the signing of the Treaty of Rapallo, 1922.\n\nBismarkean foreign policy “was too sedate for the reckless Kaiser.”\n\nWilhelm became internationally notorious for his aggressive stance on foreign policy and his strategic blunders (such as the Tangier Crisis), which pushed the German Empire into growing political isolation.\n\n_____________________________________________________________________\n\nGERMAN ART, MUSIC, ARCHITECTURE and LITERATURE\n\nin the KAISERREICH\n\n‘William I Departs for the Front, July 31, 1870’\n\nAdolph Menzel\n\nART\n\nBiedermeier Style\n\n‘Biedermeier’ refers to a style in literature, music, the visual arts and interior design in the period between the end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815 and the revolutions of 1848.\n\nBiedermeier art appealed to the prosperous middle classes by detailed but polished realism, often celebrating domestic virtues, and came to dominate over French-leaning aristocratic tastes, as well as the yearnings of Romanticism. Carl Spitzweg was a leading German artist in the style.\n\n‘Eisenwalzwerk – Ironworks’\n\nAdolph Menzel\n\nThis style continued to be popular throughout the Kaiserreich and Wilhelmine period.\n\nIn the second half of the 19th century a number of styles developed, paralleling trends in other European counties, though the lack of a dominant capital city probably contributed to even more diversity of styles than in other countries.\n\nAdolph Menzel enjoyed enormous popularity both among the German public and officialdom; at his funeral Kaiser Wilhelm II walked behind his coffin.\n\nHe dramaticised past and contemporary Prussian military successes both in paintings and brilliant wood engravings illustrating books, yet his domestic subjects are intimate and touching.\n\n‘Coronation of Prince Wilhelm Friedrich Ludwig of Hohenzollern\n\nas King Wilhelm I of Prussia – Schlosskirche, Königsberg’\n\nAdolph Menzel\n\nHis popularity in his native country, owing especially to politically propagandistic works, was such that few of his major paintings left Germany, as many were quickly acquired by museums in Berlin. Menzel’s graphic works and drawings were more widely disseminated; these, along with informal paintings not initially intended for display, have largely accounted for his posthumous reputation.\n\n‘Hirtenknabe’\n\nFranz von Lenbach\n\nKarl von Piloty was a leading academic painter of history subjects in the latter part of the century who taught in Munich.\n\nAmong his more famous pupils were Hans Makart, Franz von Lenbach, Franz Defregger, Gabriel von Max and Eduard von Grützner.\n\nThe term “Munich school” is used both of German and of Greek painting, after Greeks like Georgios Jakobides studied under him.\n\n‘Gekreuzigten Diebe’\n\n(Crucified Thief) – 1893\n\nLovis Corinth\n\nLovis Corinth – ‘Self Portrait’\n\nThe ‘Berlin Secession’ was a group founded in 1898 by painters including Max Liebermann, who broadly shared the artistic approach of Manet and the French Impressionists, and Lovis Corinth then still painting in a naturalistic style.\n\nThe group survived until the 1930s, despite splits, and its regular exhibitions helped launch the next two generations of Berlin artists, without imposing a particular style.\n\nNear the end of the century, the Benedictine Beuron Art School developed a style, mostly for religious murals, in rather muted colours, with a medievalist interest in pattern that drew from Les Nabis and in some ways looked forward to Art Nouveau or the Jugendstil (“Youth Style”) as it is known in German.\n\n‘Das Heilige Herz Jesu’\n\n(The Sacred Heart of Jesus)\n\nWuger Steiner\n\nThe Beuron art school was founded by a confederation of Benedictine monks in Germany in the late nineteenth century.\n\nBeuronese art is principally known for its murals with “muted, tranquil and seemingly mysterious colouring”.\n\n‘Sede Sapietiae’\n\nThough several different principles were in competition to form the canon for the school, “the most significant principle or canon of the Beuronese school is the role which geometry played in determining proportions.” Lenz elaborated the philosophy and canon of a new artistic direction, which was based on the elements of ancient Egyptian, Greek, Roman, Byzantine and early Christian art.\n\nBeuronese art had a large influence on the Austrian painter Gustav Klimt. In 1898, shortly after the beginning of the Vienna Secession, Father Desiderius Lenz had his book published – ‘Zur Aesthetic der Beuroner Schule’ (On the Aesthetics of the Beuron School). It is assumed that Klimt will have read Lenz’s work with enthusiasm and images of the Beuron Abbey, for instance, may show sections of the decorated ceiling which appear to have made quite a direct impact on Klimt’s decorative, golden paintings.\n\n‘Kreuzigung’\n\n(Crucifiction)\n\nFranz von Stuck\n\n‘Geist des Sieges’\n\n(The Spirit of Victory)\n\nFranz von Stuck\n\nTwo of the greatest artists of the Wilhelmine age were Franz von Stuck and Max Klinger – who today are often described as German Symbolists.\n\nFranz Stuck (February 24, 1863 – August 30, 1928), ennobled as Franz Ritter von Stuck in 1906, was a German symbolist/Art Nouveau painter, sculptor, engraver, and architect.\n\nStuck’s subject matter was primarily from mythology, inspired by the work of Arnold Böcklin. Large forms dominate most of his paintings and indicate his proclivities for sculpture.\n\n‘Selbstportrait’\n\nFranz von Stuck\n\nHis seductive female nudes are a prime example of popular Symbolist content.\n\nStuck paid much attention to the frames for his paintings and generally designed them himself with such careful use of panels, gilt carving and inscriptions that the frames must be considered as an integral part of the overall piece.\n\nThe number of Stuck’s pupils who achieved great success served to enhance the teacher’s own fame.\n\nYet by the time of his death, Stuck’s importance as an artist in his own right had lapsed.\n\nStuck’s reputation languished until the late 1960s when a renewed interest in Art Nouveau brought him to attention once more.\n\nIn 1968 the Villa Stuck was opened to the public; it is now a museum.\n\n‘Der Arbend’\n\n(Evening)\n\nMax Klinger\n\nMax Klinger (February 18, 1857 – July 5, 1920) was a German Symbolist painter, sculptor, printmaker, and writer.\n\nKlinger was born in Leipzig and studied in Karlsruhe.\n\nAn admirer of the etchings of Menzel and Goya, he shortly became a skilled and imaginative engraver in his own right.\n\nHe began creating sculptures in the early 1880s.\n\nFrom 1883-1893 he lived in Rome, and became increasingly influenced by the Italian Renaissance and antiquity.\n\nLudwig Fahrenkrog is an example of the way that art, politics and religion became interwoven during the Wilhelmine period, leading up to the ‘Great war’.\n\n‘Schicksal’\n\n(Fate)\n\nLudwig Fahrenkrog\n\nLudwig Fahrenkrog (20 October 1867 – 27 October 1952) was a German writer, playwright and artist.\n\nHe was born in Rendsburg, Prussia, in 1867.\n\nHe started his career as an artist in his youth, and attended the Berlin Royal Art Academy before being appointed a professor in 1913.\n\nHe taught at the School of Arts and Crafts in Bremen from 1898 to 1931.\n\nHe was also involved in the founding of a series of folkish religious groups in the early 20th century, as part of a movement to create what its adherents referred to as the Germanische Glaubens Gemeinschaft.\n\n‘Die heilige Stunde’\n\n(The Holy Hour)\n\nLudwig Fahrenkrog\n\nFahrenkrog was trained in the classical tradition, and had a successful artistic career.\n\nHis style, however, was more dependent on Art Nouveau and Symbolist influences than on the classical tradition, and he always stressed the religious nature and mission of art.\n\nThe “religious mission” in question is the revival of the pre-Christian Germanic faith and the rejection of Christianity, which is hinted at in paintings such as ‘Lucifer’s Lossage von Gott’ (Lucifer’s Renunciation of God, 1898).\n\nWhile Fahrenkrog’s work can be seen in the context of contemporary art movements, it was also strongly influenced by his participation in the religious movement taking place at the same time.\n\n‘Im walde – Des-Knaben Wunderhorn’\n\nMoritz von Schwind\n\n‘Rose’\n\nMoritz von Schwind\n\nThere was a tendency in the Kaiserreich to idealize the middle ages.\n\nThis tendancy is to be found in literature, architecture (Ludwig II), and the visual arts.\n\nMoritz von Schwind, (January 21, 1804 – February 8, 1871) although technically an Austrian, produced works for the German market, including the Bavarian king Ludwig II.\n\nIn 1834 he was commissioned to decorate King Ludwig’s new palace with wall paintings illustrating the works of the poet Tieck.\n\nHe also found in the same place congenial sport for his fancy in a “Kinderfries”.\n\nHe was often busy working on almanacs, and on illustrating Goethe and other writers through which he gained considerable recognition and employment.\n\nIn the revival of art in Germany, Schwind held as his own the sphere of poetic fancy.\n\nclick below for more information about\n\n© Copyright Peter Crawford 2013\n\nGermany and Austria\n\nMUSIC\n\nWotan und Brunhilde\n\nRichard Wagner\n\nEarly in the 19th century, a composer by the name of Richard Wagner was born.\n\nHe was a “Musician of the Future” who disliked the strict traditionalist styles of music.\n\nHe is credited with developing leitmotivs which were simple recurring themes found in his operas.\n\nHis music changed the course of opera, and of music in general, forever.\n\nWagner’s use of ancient German mythology in his ‘Ring’ cycle was a considerable boot to the growing nationalism of the Kaiserreich, and his last work, the sacred music drama ‘Parsifal’, created a link between German nationalism and quasi-Christian sentiments.\n\nParsifal and the Flower Maidens\n\nIn general the music of Wagner provided a strong stimulus for the emerging and developing Völkisch movement which had become fashionable among the educated middle and upper classes in the Kaiserreich.\n\nThe later 19th century saw Vienna continue its elevated position in European classical music, as well as a burst of popularity with Viennese waltzes.\n\nThese were composed by people like Johann Strauss the Younger.\n\nOther German composers from the period included Albert Lortzing, Johannes Brahms, Robert Schumann, Felix Mendelssohn, Anton Bruckner, Max Bruch, Gustav Mahler, and the great Richard Strauss.\n\nThese composers tended to mix classic and romantic elements.\n\nSalome – Richard Strauss\n\nvon Stuck\n\nRichard Strauss\n\nRichard Georg Strauss (11 June 1864 – 8 September 1949) was a leading German composer of the late Romantic and early modern eras.\n\nHe is known for his operas, which include ‘Der Rosenkavalier’ and ‘Salome’; his lieder, especially his ‘Four Last Songs’; and his tone poems and other orchestral works, such as ‘Death and Transfiguration’, ‘Till Eulenspiegel’s Merry Pranks’, ‘Also sprach Zarathustra’, ‘An Alpine Symphony’, Symphonia Domestica and ‘Metamorphosen’.\n\nStrauss was also a prominent conductor throughout Germany and Austria.\n\nStrauss represents the great late flowering of German Romanticism after Richard Wagner in which pioneering subtleties of orchestration are combined with an advanced harmonic style.\n\nARCHITECTURE\n\nIn architecture, Historicism (historismus), sometimes known as eclecticism, is an artistic and architectural style that draws inspiration from historic styles or craftmanship.\n\nAfter the neo-classicist period (which could itself be considered a historicist movement), a new historicist phase emerged in the middle of the 19th century, marked by a return to a more ancient classicism, in particular in architecture and in the genre of history painting.\n\nGottfried Semper\n\nMünchner Festspielhaus\n\nAn important architect of this period was Gottfried Semper, who built the gallery (1855) at the Zwinger Palace and the Semper Opera (1878) in Dresden.\n\nThe building has features derived from the Early Renaissance style, Baroque and even features Corinthian style pillars typical of classical Greece (classical revival).\n\nThere were regional variants of this style.\n\nExamples are the resort architecture (especially on the German Baltic coast), the Hanover School of Architecture and the Nuremberg style.\n\n‘Altes Museum’ – Karl Friedrich Schinkel\n\nKarl Friedrich Schinkel (13 March 1781 – 9 October 1841) was a Prussian architect, city planner, and painter who also designed furniture and stage sets.\n\nSchinkel was one of the most prominent architects of Germany and designed both neoclassical and neogothic buildings, and was a strong influence on building styles in the Kaiserreich.\n\nNeue Wache – Karl Friedrich Schinkel\n\nSchinkel’s style, in his most productive period, is defined by a turn to Greek rather than Imperial Roman architecture, an attempt to turn away from the style that was linked to the recent French occupiers. (Thus, he is a noted proponent of the Greek Revival.)\n\nHis most famous buildings are found in and around Berlin.\n\nThese include Neue Wache (1816–1818),\n\nThe Neue Wache (“New Guard House”) is a building in Berlin. It is located on the north side of the ‘Unter den Linden’, a major east-west thoroughfare in the centre of the city.\n\nSchauspielhaus – Berlin – 1821 – Karl Friedrich Schinkel\n\nDating from 1816, the Neue Wache was designed by the architect Karl Friedrich Schinkel, and is a leading example of German neoclassicism. Originally built as a guardhouse for the troops of the Crown Prince of Prussia, the building has been used as a war memorial since 1931.\n\nNational Monument for the Liberation Wars (1818–1821), the Schauspielhaus (1819–1821) at the Gendarmenmarkt, which replaced the earlier theatre that was destroyed by fire in 1817, and the ‘Altes Museum’ (old museum) on Museum Island (1823–1830).\n\nHe also carried out improvements to the Crown Prince’s Palace.\n\nLater, Schinkel moved away from classicism altogether, embracing the Neo-Gothic in his Friedrichswerder Church (1824–1831).\n\nSchloss Neuschwanstein under Construction\n\nThe predilection for medieval buildings has its most famous exemplar in the castle of Neuschwanstein, which Ludwig II commissioned in 1869.\n\nNeuschwanstein was designed by Christian Jank, a theatrical set designer, which possibly explains the fantastical nature of the resulting building.\n\nChristian Jank (1833–1888), was a German sce­nic pain­ter no­ta­ble for his pa­lace de­signs for King Lud­wig II of Bavaria.\n\nChristian Jank\n\nJank was born on 15 July 1833 in Munich, the Bavarian ca­pi­tal.\n\nHere he ori­gi­nally worked as a scenic painter. Among other things he was in­vol­ved in the sce­nery for Richard Wagner’s opera Lohengrin. His work pi­qued the in­te­rest of Lud­wig II, who com­mis­sio­ned him to create con­cepts for his ar­chi­tec­tu­ral pro­jects in­spi­red by Wag­ner. Jank’s historistic drafts were the basis for Neuschwanstein Castle, which was built star­ting in 1869 by Eduard Riedel and later Georg von Dollmann. Jank was also in­vol­ved in the in­te­rior of Linderhof Palace. His con­cepts for Falkenstein Castle could not be rea­li­zed, as the pro­ject was aban­do­ned after the king’s death in 1886. Jank him­s­elf died in Mu­nich on 25 No­vem­ber 1888.\n\nThe architectural expertise, vital to a building in such a perilous site, was provided first by the Munich court architect Eduard Riedel and later by Georg Dollmann, son-in-law of Leo von Klenze.\n\nThere is also Ulm Cathedral, and at the end of the period the Reichstag building (1894) by Paul Wallot.\n\n‘Jugend’ – January 1900\n\nThe Art Nouveau style is commonly known by its German name, Jugendstil.\n\nDrawing from traditional German printmaking, the style uses precise and hard edges, an element that was rather different from the naturalistic style of the time.\n\nThe movement was centered in Hamburg\n\nWithin the field of Jugendstil art, there is a variety of different methods, applied by the various individual artists. Methods range from classic to romantic.\n\nOne feature that sets Jugendstil apart is the typography used, whose letter and image combination is unmistakable.\n\n‘Der Kuss’ – Peter Behrens\n\nThe combination was used for covers of novels, advertisements, and exhibition posters.\n\nDesigners often used unique display typefaces that worked harmoniously with the image.\n\nHenry Van de Velde, who worked most of his career in Germany, was a Belgian theorist who influenced many others to continue in this style of graphic art including Peter Behrens, Hermann Obrist, and Richard Riemerschmid.\n\nAugust Endell is another notable Art Nouveau designer.\n\nMagazines were important in spreading the visual idiom of Jugendstil, especially the graphical qualities. Besides Jugend, other important ones were the satirical Simplicissimus and Pan.\n\nYoung Germany (Junges Deutschland) was a loose group of Vormärz writers which existed from about 1830 to 1850.\n\nIt was essentially a youth movement (similar to those that had swept France and Ireland and originated in Italy).\n\nIts main proponents were Karl Gutzkow, Heinrich Laube, Theodor Mundt and Ludolf Wienbarg; Heinrich Heine, Ludwig Börne and Georg Büchner were also considered part of the movement.\n\nThe wider circle included Willibald Alexis, Adolf Glassbrenner and Gustav Kühne.\n\nThe so-called Biedermeier poets reacted by withdrawing into the realm of the family and idyllic nature.\n\nHeinrich Heine\n\nThis resignation was replaced in the poems of Heinrich Heine by new political directions and a realistic outlook.\n\nMany writers had to go into exile after the revolution of 1848, among them Karl Marx and Carl Schurz. Throughout the 19th century the forms introduced by Goethe and Schiller prevailed: in poetry, the Lied derived from folksongs; in drama, the historical tragedy in blank verse; in prose, the novella, an artistically structured story centered on an extraordinary event.\n\nAnnette Elisabeth von Droste-Hulshoff and Eduard Morike were the leading poets; Franz Grillparzer and Christian Friedrich Hebbel, the dramatists; Jeremias Gotthelf, Gottfried Keller, Conrad Ferdinand Meyer, Wilhelm Raabe, Adalbert Stifter, and Theodor Storm, the storytellers.\n\nFar ahead of his time was Georg Buchner, who rejected bourgeois values and wrote such plays as Woyzeck (1850; Eng. trans., 1957), in which he anticipated modern styles.\n\nGeorg Hegel\n\nLiterature in the Reich was not only restricted to poetry, novels and biography, however.\n\nGermany became, during this period, a world leader in philosophy.\n\nHegel was the precursor of these great philosophers.\n\nHe was followed by Arthur Schopenhauer, and later Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche.\n\nGeorg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel (August 27, 1770 – November 14, 1831) was a German philosopher, and a major figure in German Idealism.\n\nHis historicist and idealist account of reality revolutionized European philosophy. He was considered to be the ‘official philosopher’ of the Prussian State.\n\nHegel developed a comprehensive philosophical framework, or “system”, of Absolute idealism to account in an integrated and developmental way for the relation of mind and nature, the subject and object of knowledge, psychology, the state, history, art, religion, and philosophy.\n\nIn particular, he developed the concept that ‘mind’ or ‘spirit’ manifested itself in a set of contradictions and oppositions that it ultimately integrated and united, without eliminating either pole or reducing one to the other. This concept is known as dialectic.\n\nArthur Schopenhauer\n\nArthur Schopenhauer (22 February 1788 – 21 September 1860) was a German philosopher best known for his book, ‘Die Welt als Wille und Vorstellung’, in which he claimed that our world is driven by a continually dissatisfied will, continually seeking satisfaction.\n\nA key focus of Schopenhauer was his investigation of individual motivation. Before Schopenhauer, Hegel had popularized the concept of Zeitgeist, the idea that society consisted of a collective consciousness which moved in a distinct direction, dictating the actions of its members. Schopenhauer, a reader of both Kant and Hegel, criticized their logical optimism and the belief that individual morality could be determined by society and reason. Schopenhauer believed that humans were motivated by only their own basic desires, or Wille zum Leben (“Will to Live”), which directed all of mankind.\n\nFriedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche\n\nFriedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche (October 15, 1844 – August 25, 1900) was a German philosopher, poet, composer, cultural critic, and classical philologist.\n\nHe wrote critical texts on religion, morality, contemporary culture, philosophy, and science, displaying a fondness for metaphor, irony, and aphorism.\n\nNietzsche’s key ideas include the “death of God,” the ‘Übermensch’, ‘the eternal recurrence’, ‘the Apollonian and Dionysian dichotomy’, ‘perspectivism’, and ‘der Wille zur Macht’ (the will to power).\n\nCentral to his philosophy is the idea of “life-affirmation”, which involves questioning of all doctrines that drain life’s expansive energies, however socially prevalent those views might be.\n\nHis influence remains substantial within philosophy, notably in existentialism, post-modernism, and post-structuralism, as well as outside it.\n\nHis radical questioning of the value and objectivity of truth has been the focus of extensive commentary, especially in the continental tradition.\n\nSCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY\n\nPhysics – The work of Albert Einstein and Max Planck was crucial to the foundation of modern physics, which Werner Heisenberg and Erwin Schrödinger developed further.\n\nThey were preceded by such key physicists as Hermann von Helmholtz, Joseph von Fraunhofer, and Gabriel Daniel Fahrenheit, among others.\n\nWilhelm Conrad Röntgen discovered X-rays, an accomplishment that made him the first winner of the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1901 and eventually earned him an element name, roentgenium.\n\nHeinrich Rudolf Hertz’s work in the domain of electromagnetic radiation were pivotal to the development of modern telecommunication.\n\nMathematical aerodynamics was developed in Germany, especially by Ludwig Prandtl.\n\nAt the start of the 20th century, Germany garnered fourteen of the first thirty-one Nobel Prizes in Chemistry, starting with Hermann Emil Fischer in 1901.\n\nNumerous important mathematicians were born in Germany, including Gauss, Hilbert, Riemann, Weierstrass, Dirichlet and Weyl.\n\nGermany has been the home of many famous inventors and engineers, such as Hans Geiger, the creator of the Geiger counter; and Konrad Zuse, who built the first computer.\n\nGerman inventors, engineers and industrialists such as Zeppelin, Daimler, Diesel, Otto, and Benz helped shape modern automotive and air transportation technology including the beginnings of space travel.\n\nAlexander von Humboldt’s (1769–1859) work as a natural scientist and explorer was foundational to biogeography.\n\nWladimir Köppen (1846–1940) was an eclectic Russian-born botanist and climatologist who synthesized global relationships between climate, vegetation and soil types into a classification system that is used, with some modifications, to this day.\n\nAlfred Wegener (1880–1930), a similarly interdisciplinary scientist, was one of the first people to hypothesize the theory of continental drift which was later developed into the overarching geological theory of plate tectonics.\n\nWilhelm Wundt is credited with the establishment of psychology as an independent empirical science through his construction of the first laboratory at the University of Leipzig in 1879.\n\nSigmund Freud, who was in fact Austrian, was the inventor of the dream deutung.\n\nDomestic Affairs\n\nUnder Wilhelm II, Germany no longer had long-ruling strong chancellors like Bismarck.\n\nThe new chancellors had difficulty in performing their roles, especially the additional role as Prime Minister of Prussia assigned to them in the German Constitution.\n\nThe reforms of Chancellor Leo von Caprivi, which liberalized trade, and so reduced unemployment, were supported by the Kaiser and most Germans except for Prussian landowners, who feared loss of land and power and launched several campaigns against the reforms.\n\nWhile Prussian aristocrats challenged the demands of a united German state, in the 1890s several organizations were set up to challenge the authoritarian conservative Prussian militarism which was being imposed on the country.\n\nEducators opposed to the German state-run schools, which emphasized military education, set up their own independent liberal schools, which encouraged individuality and freedom, however nearly all the schools in Imperial Germany had a very high standard and kept abreast with modern developments in knowledge.\n\nArtists began experimental art in opposition to Kaiser Wilhelm’s support for traditional art, to which Wilhelm responded “art which transgresses the laws and limits laid down by me can no longer be called art.”\n\nIt was largely thanks to Wilhelm’s influence that most printed material in Germany used ‘blackletter’ (fraktur) instead of the Roman type used in the rest of Western Europe.\n\nAt the same time, a new generation of cultural creators emerged.\n\nFrom the 1890s onwards, the most effective opposition to the monarchy came from the newly formed Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD), which advocated Marxism.\n\nThe threat of the SPD to the German monarchy and industrialists caused the state both to crack down on the party’s supporters and to implement its own programme of social reform to soothe discontent.\n\nGermany’s large industries provided significant social welfare programmes and good care to their employees, as long as they were not identified as socialists or trade-union members.\n\nThe larger industrial firms provided pensions, sickness benefits and even housing to their employees.\n\nHaving learned from the failure of Bismarck’s Kulturkampf, Wilhelm II maintained good relations with the Roman Catholic Church and concentrated on opposing socialism.\n\nThis policy failed when the Social Democrats won ⅓ of the votes in the 1912 elections to the Reichstag, and became the largest political party in Germany.\n\nFeldmarschall Paul von Hindenburg\n\nGeneralquartiermeister Erich Ludendorff\n\nThe government remained in the hands of a succession of conservative coalitions supported by right-wing liberals or Catholic clerics and heavily dependent on the Kaiser’s favour.\n\nDuring World War I, the Kaiser increasingly devolved his powers to the leaders of the German High Command, particularly future President of Germany, Field Marshal Paul von Hindenburg and Generalquartiermeister Erich Ludendorff.\n\nHindenburg took over the role of commander–in–chief from the Kaiser, while Ludendorff became de facto general chief of staff.\n\nBy 1916, Germany was effectively a military dictatorship run by Hindenburg and Ludendorff, with the Kaiser reduced to a mere figurehead.\n\nForeign Affairs\n\nWilhelm II wanted Germany to have her “place in the sun,” like Britain, which he constantly wished to emulate or rival.\n\nWith German traders and merchants already active worldwide, he encouraged colonial efforts in Africa and the Pacific (“new imperialism”), causing the German Empire to vie with other European powers for remaining “unclaimed” territories.\n\nWith the encouragement or at least the acquiescence of Britain, which at this stage saw Germany as a counterweight to her old rival France, Germany acquired German Southwest Africa (today Namibia), German Kamerun (Cameroon), Togoland and German East Africa (the mainland part of current Tanzania). Islands were gained in the Pacific through purchase and treaties and also a 99-year lease for the territory of Kiautschou in northeast China.\n\nBut of these German colonies only Togoland and German Samoa (after 1908) became self-sufficient and profitable; all the others required subsidies from the Berlin treasury for building infrastructure, school systems, hospitals and other institutions.\n\nBismarck had originally dismissed the agitation for colonies with contempt; he favoured a Eurocentric foreign policy, as the treaty arrangements made during his tenure in office show.\n\nAs a latecomer to colonization, Germany repeatedly came into conflict with the established colonial powers and also with the United States, which opposed German attempts at colonial expansion in both the Caribbean and the Pacific.\n\nNative insurrections in German territories received prominent coverage in other countries, especially in Britain; the established powers had dealt with such uprisings decades earlier, often brutally, and had secured firm control of their colonies by then.\n\nThe Boxer Rising in China, which the Chinese government eventually sponsored, began in the Shandong province, in part because Germany, as colonizer at Kiautschou, was an untested power and had only been active there for two years.\n\nEight western nations, including the United States, mounted a joint relief force to rescue westerners caught up in the rebellion.\n\nOn two occasions, a French-German conflict over the fate of Morocco seemed inevitable.\n\nUpon acquiring Southwest Africa, German settlers were encouraged to cultivate land held by the Herero and Nama. Herero and Nama tribal lands were used for a variety of exploitive goals (much as the British did before in Rhodesia), including farming, ranching, and mining for minerals and diamonds.\n\nIn 1904, the Herero and the Nama revolted against the colonists in Southwest Africa, killing farm families, their laborers and servants.\n\nIn response to the attacks, troops were dispatched to quell the uprising.\n\nMiddle East\n\nBismarck, and Wilhelm II after him, sought closer economic ties with the Ottoman Empire.\n\nUnder Wilhelm, with the financial backing of the Deutsche Bank, the Baghdad Railway was begun in 1900, although by 1914 it was still 500 km (310 mi) short of its destination in Baghdad.\n\nIn an interview with Wilhelm in 1899, Cecil Rhodes had tried “to convince the Kaiser that the future of the German empire abroad lay in the Middle East” and not in Africa; with a grand Middle-Eastern empire, Germany could afford to allow Britain the unhindered completion of the Cape-to-Cairo railway that Rhodes favoured.\n\nBritain initially supported the Baghdad Railway; but by 1911 British statesmen came to fear it might be extended to Basra on the Persian Gulf, threatening Britain’s naval supremacy in the Indian Ocean. Accordingly they asked to have construction halted, to which Germany and the Ottoman Empire acquiesced.\n\nEurope\n\nWilhelm II and his advisers committed a fatal diplomatic error when they allowed the “Reinsurance Treaty” that Bismarck had negotiated with Tsarist Russia to lapse.\n\nGermany was left with no firm ally but Austria-Hungary, and her support for action in annexing Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1908 further soured relations with Russia.\n\nWilhelm missed the opportunity to secure an alliance with Britain in the 1890s, when it was involved in colonial rivalries with France, and he alienated British statesmen further by openly supporting the Boers in the South African War and building a navy to rival Britain’s.\n\nBy 1911 Wilhelm had completely picked apart the careful power balance established by Bismarck and Britain turned to France in the Entente Cordiale.\n\nGermany’s only other ally besides Austria was the Kingdom of Italy, but it remained an ally only pro forma. When war came, Italy saw more benefit in an alliance with Britain, France, and Russia, which, in the secret Treaty of London in 1915 promised it the frontier districts of Austria, where Italians formed the majority of the population, and also colonial concessions.\n\nGermany did acquire a second ally that same year when the Ottoman Empire entered the war on its side, but in the long run supporting the Ottoman war effort only drained away German resources from the main fronts.\n\n© Copyright Peter Crawford 2013\n\nTHE CAUSES OF THE ‘GREAT WAR’\n\n© Copyright Peter Crawford 2013\n\nThe causes of World War I, which began in central Europe in late July 1914, included intertwined factors, such as the conflicts and hostility of the four decades leading up to the war. Militarism, alliances, imperialism, and nationalism played major roles in the conflict as well.\n\nThe immediate origins of the war, however, lay in the decisions taken by statesmen and generals during the Crisis of 1914, ‘casus belli’ for which was the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria and his wife by Gavrilo Princip, an irredentist Serb.\n\nThe crisis came after a long and difficult series of diplomatic clashes between the Great Powers (Italy, France, Germany, the British Empire, the Austria-Hungarian Empire and Russia) over European and colonial issues in the decade before 1914 that had left tensions high.\n\nIn turn these diplomatic clashes can be traced to changes in the balance of power in Europe since 1867.\n\nThe more immediate cause for the war was tensions over territory in the Balkans.\n\nAustria-Hungary competed with Serbia and Russia for territory and influence in the region, and they pulled the rest of the Great Powers into the conflict through their various alliances and treaties.\n\nBackground\n\nIn November 1912, Russia was humiliated because of its inability to support Serbia during the Bosnian crisis of 1908 – also known as the ‘First Balkan War’, and announced a major reconstruction of its military.\n\nOn November 28, German Foreign Secretary Gottlieb von Jagow told the Reichstag, that “If Austria is forced, for whatever reason, to fight for its position as a Great Power, then we must stand by her.“\n\nAs a result, British Foreign Secretary Sir Edward Grey responded by warning Prince Karl Lichnowsky, the Germany Ambassador in London, that if Germany offered Austria a “blank cheque” for war in the Balkans, then “the consequences of such a policy would be incalculable.”\n\nTo reinforce this point, R. B. Haldane, the Germanophile Lord Chancellor, met with Prince Lichnowsky to offer an explicit warning that if Germany were to attack France, Britain would intervene in France’s favor.\n\nWith the recently announced Russian military reconstruction and certain British communications, the possibility of war was a leading topic at the German Imperial War Council of 8 December 1912 in Berlin, an informal meeting of some of Germany’s top military leadership called on short notice by the Kaiser.\n\nAttending the conference were Kaiser Wilhelm II, Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz – the Naval State Secretary, Admiral Georg Alexander von Müller, the Chief of the German Imperial Naval Cabinet (Marinekabinett), General von Moltke – the Army’s Chief of Staff, Admiral August von Heeringen – the Chief of the Naval General Staff and General Moriz von Lyncker, the Chief of the German Imperial Military Cabinet.\n\nThe presence of the leaders of both the German Army and Navy at this War Council attests to its importance, however, Chancellor Theobald von Bethmann-Hollweg and General Josias von Heeringen, the Prussian Minister of War, were not invited.\n\nWilhelm II called British ‘balance of power’ concept “idiocy,” but agreed that Haldane’s statement was a “desirable clarification” of British policy.\n\nHis opinion was that Austria should attack that December and/ if “Russia supports the Serbs, which she evidently does…then war would be unavoidable for us, too,” and that would be better than going to war after Russia completed the massive modernization and expansion of their army that they had just begun. Moltke agreed.\n\nIn his professional military opinion “a war is unavoidable and the sooner the better“.\n\nMoltke “wanted to launch an immediate attack“.\n\nBoth Wilhelm II and the Army leadership agreed that if a war were necessary it were best launched soon. Admiral Tirpitz, however, asked for a “postponement of the great fight for one and a half years” because the Navy was not ready for a general war that included Britain as an opponent.\n\nHe insisted that the completion of the construction of the U-boat base at Heligoland and the widening of the Kiel Canal were the Navy’s prerequisites for war.\n\nThe date for completion of the widening of the Kiel Canal was the summer of 1914.\n\nThough Moltke objected to the postponement of the war as unacceptable, Wilhelm sided with Tirpitz. Moltke “agreed to a postponement only reluctantly.”\n\nIt should be noted that this War Council only showed the thinking and recommendations of those present, with no decisions taken.\n\nAdmiral Müller’s diary states: “That was the end of the conference. The result amounted to nothing.” Certainly the only decision taken was to do nothing.\n\nWith the November 1912 announcement of the Russian ‘Great Military Programme’, the leadership of the German Army began clamoring even more strongly for a “preventive war” against Russia.\n\nMoltke declared that Germany could not win the arms race with France, Britain and Russia, which she herself had begun in 1911, because the financial structure of the German state, which gave the Reich government little power to tax, meant Germany would bankrupt herself in an arms race.\n\nAs such, Moltke from late 1912 onward was the leading advocate for a general war, and the sooner the better.\n\nThroughout May and June 1914, Moltke engaged in an “almost ultimative” demand for a German “preventive war” against Russia in 1914.\n\nThe German Foreign Secretary, Gottlieb von Jagow, reported on a discussion with Moltke at the end of May 1914:\n\n“Moltke described to me his opinion of our military situation. The prospects of the future oppressed him heavily. In two or three years Russia would have completed her armaments. The military superiority of our enemies would then be so great that he did not know how he could overcome them. Today we would still be a match for them. In his opinion there was no alternative to making preventive war in order to defeat the enemy while we still had a chance of victory. The Chief of the General Staff therefore proposed that I should conduct a policy with the aim of provoking a war in the near future.”\n\nThe new French President Raymond Poincaré, who took office in 1913, was favourable to improving relations with Germany.\n\nIn January 1914 Poincaré became the first French President to dine at the German Embassy in Paris.\n\nPoincaré was more interested in the idea of French expansion in the Middle East than a war of revenge to regain Alsace-Lorraine.\n\nHad the Reich been interested in improved relations with France before August 1914, the opportunity was available, but the leadership of the Reich lacked such interests, and preferred a policy of war to destroy France.\n\nBecause of France’s smaller economy and population, by 1913 French leaders had largely accepted that France by itself could never defeat Germany.\n\nIn May 1914, Serbian politics were polarized between two factions, one headed by the Prime Minister Nikola Pašić, and the other by the radical nationalist chief of Military Intelligence, Colonel Dragutin Dimitrijević, known by his codename Apis.\n\nIn that month, due to Colonel Dimitrigjevic’s intrigues, King Peter dismissed Pašić’s government.\n\nThe Russian Minister in Belgrade intervened to have Pašić’s government restored.\n\nPašić, though he often talked tough in public, knew that Serbia was near-bankrupt and, having suffered heavy casualties in the Balkan Wars and in the suppression of a December 1913 Albanian revolt in Kosovo, needed peace.\n\nSince Russia also favoured peace in the Balkans, from the Russian viewpoint it was desirable to keep Pašić in power.\n\nIt was in the midst of this political crisis that politically powerful members of the Serbian military armed and trained three Bosnian students as assassins and sent them into Austria-Hungary.\n\nDomestic Political Factors\n\nGerman Domestic Politics – Left-wing parties, especially the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) made large gains in the 1912 German election.\n\nGerman government at the time was still dominated by the Prussian Junkers who feared the rise of these left-wing parties.\n\nIn the 19th and 20th centuries, Junker was an often pejorative designation for a member of the landed nobility in Prussia and eastern Germany.\n\nSupporting monarchism and military traditions, they were seen as reactionary, anti-democratic and protectionist. This political class held tremendous power over industrial classes and government alike.\n\nIt is possible that the Junkers deliberately sought an external war to distract the population and whip up patriotic support for the government.\n\nRussia was in the midst of a large-scale military build-up and reform that they completed in 1916–17.\n\nIt is also argued, however, that German conservatives were ambivalent about a war, worrying that losing a war would have disastrous consequences, and even a successful war might alienate the population if it were lengthy or difficult.\n\nFrench Domestic Politics – The situation in France was quite different from that in Germany as going to war appeared to the majority of political and military leaders to be a potentially costly gamble.\n\nIt is undeniable that forty years after the loss of Alsace-Lorraine a vast number of French were still angered by the territorial loss, as well as by the humiliation of being compelled to pay a large reparation to Germany in 1870.\n\nThe diplomatic alienation of France orchestrated by Germany prior to World War I caused further resentment in France.\n\nNevertheless, the leaders of France recognized Germany’s strong military advantage against them, as Germany had nearly twice as much population and a better equipped army.\n\nAt the same time, the episodes of the Tangier Crisis in 1905 and the Agadir Crisis in 1911 had given France a strong indication that war with Germany could be inevitable if Germany continued to oppose French colonial expansionism.\n\nMore than a century after the French Revolution, there was still a fierce struggle between the left-wing French government and its right-wing opponents.\n\nAustria\n\n© Copyright Peter Crawford 2013\n\nIn 1867, the Austrian Empire fundamentally changed its governmental structure, becoming the ‘Dual Monarchy of Austria-Hungary’.\n\nFor hundreds of years, the empire had been run in an essentially feudal manner, with a German-speaking aristocracy at its head, however, with the threat represented by an emergence of nationalism within the empire’s many component ethnicities, some elements, including Emperor Franz Joseph, decided that a compromise was required to preserve the power of the German aristocracy.\n\nIn 1867, the Ausgleich was agreed on, which made the Magyar (Hungarian) elite in Hungary almost equal partners in the government of Austria-Hungary.\n\nThis arrangement fostered a tremendous degree of dissatisfaction among many in the traditional German ruling classes.\n\nSome of them considered the Ausgleich to have been a calamity, because it often frustrated their intentions in the governance of Austria-Hungary.\n\nFor example, it was extremely difficult for Austria-Hungary to form a coherent foreign policy that suited the interests of both the German and Magyar elite.\n\nThroughout the fifty years from 1867 to 1914, it proved difficult to reach adequate compromises in the governance of Austria-Hungary.\n\nAt the same time, a form of social Darwinism became popular among many in the Austrian half of the government.\n\nThis thinking emphasised the primacy of armed struggle between nations, and the need for nations to arm themselves for an ultimate struggle for survival.\n\nAs a result, at least two distinct strains of thought advocated war with Serbia, often unified in the same people.\n\nSome reasoned that dealing with political deadlock required that more Slavs be brought into Austria-Hungary to dilute the power of the Magyar elite.\n\nWith more Slavs, the South Slavs of Austria-Hungary could force a new political compromise in which the Germans could play the Magyars against the South Slavs.\n\nAnother fear was that the South Slavs, primarily under the leadership of Serbia, were organizing for a war against Austria-Hungary, and even all of Germanic civilization.\n\nSome leaders, such as Conrad von Hötzendorf, argued that Serbia must be dealt with before it became too powerful to defeat militarily.\n\nA powerful contingent within the Austro-Hungarian government was motivated by these thoughts and advocated war with Serbia long before the war began.\n\nProminent members of this group included Leopold von Berchtold, Alexander von Hoyos, and Johann von Forgách.\n\nAlthough many other members of the government, notably Franz Ferdinand, Franz Joseph, and many Hungarian politicians did not believe that a violent struggle with Serbia would necessarily solve any of Austria-Hungary’s problems, the hawkish elements did exert a strong influence on government policy, holding key positions.\n\nIt is important to understand the central role of Austria-Hungary in starting the war.\n\nConvinced Serbian nationalism and Russian Balkan ambitions were disintegrating the Empire, Austria-Hungary hoped for a limited war against Serbia and that strong German support would force Russia to keep out of the war and weaken its Balkan prestige.\n\nImperialism\n\nSome attribute the start of the war to imperialism.\n\nCountries such as the United Kingdom and France accumulated great wealth in the late 19th century through their control of trade in foreign resources, markets, territories, and people.\n\nOther empires, Germany, Austria-Hungary, Italy, and Russia all hoped to do so as well in economic advantage.\n\nTheir frustrated ambitions, and British policies of strategic exclusion created tensions.\n\nIn addition, the limits of natural resources in many European nations began to slowly alter trade balance, and make national industries seek new territories rich in natural resources.\n\nCommercial interests contributed substantially to Anglo-German rivalry during the scramble for tropical Africa.\n\nThis was the scene of sharpest conflict between certain German and British commercial interests.\n\nThere have been two partitions of Africa.\n\nOne involved the actual imposition of political boundaries across the continent during the last quarter of the 19th century; the other, which actually commenced in the mid-19th century, consisted of the so-called ‘business’ partition.\n\nIn southern Africa the latter partition followed rapidly upon the discoveries of diamonds and gold in 1867 and 1886 respectively.\n\nAn integral part of this second partition was the expansion in the interior of British capital interests, primarily the British South Africa Company and mining companies such as De Beers.\n\nAfter 1886 the Witwatersrand goldfields prompted feverish activity among European as well as British capitalists.\n\nIt was soon felt in Whitehall that German commercial penetration in particular constituted a direct threat to Britain’s continued economic and political hegemony south of the Limpopo.\n\nAmid the expanding web of German business on the Rand, the most contentious operations were those of the German-financed N.Z.A.S.M. or Netherlands South African Railway Company, which possessed a railway monopoly in the Transvaal.\n\nRivalries for not just colonies, but colonial trade and trade routes developed between the emerging economic powers and the incumbent great powers.\n\nBerlin-Baghdad Railway\n\nThis rivalry was illustrated in the Berlin-Baghdad Railway, which would have given German industry access to Iraqi oil, and German trade a southern port in the Persian Gulf.\n\nA history of this railroad in the context of World War I has arrived to describe the German interests in countering the British Empire at a global level, and Turkey’s interest in countering their Russian rivals at a regional level.\n\n‘It was felt in England that if, as Napoleon is said to have remarked, Antwerp in the hands of a great continental power was a pistol leveled at the English coast, Bagdad and the Persian Gulf in the hands of Germany (or any other strong power) would be a 42-centimetre gun pointed at India.’\n\nOn the other side, “Public opinion in Germany was feasting on visions of Cairo, Baghdad, and Tehran, and the possibility of evading the British blockade through outlets to the Indian Ocean.”\n\nBritain’s initial strategic exclusion of others from northern access to a Persian Gulf port in the creation of Kuwait by treaty as a protected, subsidized client state showed political recognition of the importance of the issue.\n\nIf outcome is revealing, by the close of the war this political recognition was re-emphasized in the military effort to capture the railway itself, recounted with perspective in a contemporary history: “On the 26th Aleppo fell, and on the 28th we reached Muslimieh, that junction on the Baghdad railway on which longing eyes had been cast as the nodal point in the conflict of German and other ambitions in the East.”\n\nThe Treaty of Versailles explicitly removed all German ownership thereafter, which without Ottoman rule left access to Mesopotamian and Persian oil, and northern access to a southern port in British hands alone.\n\nOtto von Bismarck\n\nRivalries among the great powers were exacerbated starting in the 1880s by the scramble for colonies, which brought much of Africa and Asia under European rule in the following quarter-century.\n\nIt also created great Anglo-French and Anglo-Russian tensions and crises that prevented a British alliance with either until the early 20th century.\n\nOtto von Bismarck disliked the idea of an overseas empire, but pursued a colonial policy to court domestic political support.\n\nThis started Anglo-German tensions since German acquisitions in Africa and the Pacific threatened to impinge upon British strategic and commercial interests.\n\nBismarck supported French colonization in Africa because it diverted government attention and resources away from continental Europe and revanchism.\n\nIn spite of all of Bismarck’s deft diplomatic maneuvering, in 1890 he was forced to resign by the new Kaiser (Wilhelm II).\n\nHis successor, Leo von Caprivi, was the last German Chancellor who was successful in calming Anglo-German tensions.\n\nLeo von Caprivi\n\nAfter his loss of office in 1894, German policy led to greater conflicts with the other colonial powers.\n\nThe status of Morocco had been guaranteed by international agreement, and when France attempted to greatly expand its influence there without the assent of all the other signatories Germany opposed it prompting the ‘Moroccan Crise’s, the ‘Tangier Crisis’ of 1905 and the ‘Agadir Crisis’ of 1911.\n\nThe intent of German policy was to drive a wedge between the British and French, but in both cases produced the opposite effect, and Germany was isolated diplomatically, most notably lacking the support of Italy despite Italian membership in the Triple Alliance.\n\nThe French protectorate over Morocco was established officially in 1912.\n\nIn 1914, there were no outstanding colonial conflicts, Africa essentially having been claimed fully, apart from Ethiopia, for several years, however, the competitive mentality, as well as a fear of “being left behind” in the competition for the world’s resources may have played a role in the decisions to begin the conflict.\n\nThe Arms Race\n\nA self-reinforcing cycle of heightened military preparedness…was an essential element in the conjuncture that led to disaster…The armaments race…was a necessary precondition for the outbreak of hostilities.\n\nIf Archduke Franz Ferdinand had been assassinated in 1904 or even in 1911, there might have been no war. It was…the armaments race…and the speculation about imminent or preventive wars that made his death in 1914 the trigger for war.\n\nSome historians see the German naval build-up as the principal cause of deteriorating Anglo-German relations.\n\nThe overwhelming British response, however, proved to Germany that its efforts were unlikely to equal the Royal Navy.\n\nIn 1900, the British had a 3.7:1 tonnage advantage over Germany; in 1910 the ratio was 2.3:1 and in 1914, 2.1:1.\n\nSo decisive was the British victory in the naval arms race that it is hard to regard it as in any meaningful sense a cause of the First World War.\n\nThis ignores the fact that the Kaiserliche Marine had narrowed the gap by nearly half, and that the Royal Navy had long intended to be stronger than any two potential opponents; the United States Navy was in a period of growth, making the German gains very ominous.\n\nTechnological changes, with oil- rather than coal-fuelled ships, decreasing refuelling time while increasing speed and range, and with superior armour and guns also would favour the growing, and newer, German fleet.\n\nOne of the aims of the ‘First Hague Conference’ of 1899, held at the suggestion of Russian Emperor Nicholas II, was to discuss disarmament.\n\nThe ‘Second Hague Conference’ was held in 1907.\n\nAll the signatories except for Germany supported disarmament.\n\nGermany also did not want to agree to binding arbitration and mediation.\n\nThe Kaiser was concerned that the United States would propose disarmament measures, which he opposed.\n\nRussian interests in Balkans and Ottoman Empire\n\n© Copyright Peter Crawford 2013\n\nThe main Russian goals included strengthening its role as the protector of Eastern Christians in the Balkans (such as the Serbians).\n\nAlthough Russia enjoyed a booming economy, growing population, and large armed forces, its strategic position was threatened by an expanding Turkish military trained by German experts using the latest technology.\n\nThe start of the war renewed attention of old goals: expelling the Turks from Constantinople, extending Russian dominion into eastern Anatolia and Persian Azerbaijan, and annexing Galicia.\n\nThese conquests would assure Russian predominance in the Black Sea.\n\nOver by Christmas\n\nField Marshal Lord\n\nHoratio Herbert Kitchener\n\nBoth sides believed, and publicly stated, that the war would end soon.\n\nThe Kaiser told his troops that they would be, “…home before the leaves have fallen from the trees,” and one German officer said he expected to be in Paris by Sedantag, about six weeks away.\n\nGermany only stockpiled enough potassium nitrate for gunpowder for six months.\n\nRussian officers similarly expected to be in Berlin in six weeks, and those who suggested that the war would last for six months were considered pessimists.\n\nVon Moltke and his French counterpart Joseph Joffre were among the few who expected a long war, but neither adjusted his nation’s military plans accordingly.\n\nThe new British Secretary of State for War, Lord Kitchener, was the only leading official on either side to both expect a long war (“three years” or longer, he told an amazed colleague) and act accordingly, immediately building an army of millions of soldiers who would fight for years.\n\nSchlieffen Plan\n\nAlfred Graf von Schlieffen\n\nGermany’s strategic vulnerability, sandwiched between its allied rivals, led to the development of the audacious (and incredibly expensive) Schlieffen Plan.\n\nIt aimed to knock France instantly out of contention, before Russia had time to mobilize its gigantic human reserves.\n\nIt aimed to accomplish this task within 6 weeks.\n\nGermany could then turn her full resources to meeting the Russian threat.\n\nAlthough Count Alfred von Schlieffen initially conceived the plan before his retirement in 1906, Japan’s defeat of Russia in the Russo-Japanese War of 1904 exposed Russia’s organizational weakness and added greatly to the plan’s credibility.\n\nThe plan called for a rapid German mobilization, sweeping through the Netherlands, Luxembourg, and Belgium, into France.\n\nSchlieffen called for overwhelming numbers on the far right flank, the northernmost spearhead of the force with only minimum troops making up the arm and axis of the formation as well as a minimum force stationed on the Russian eastern front.\n\nHelmuth von Moltke\n\nSchlieffen was replaced by Helmuth von Moltke, and in 1907–08 Moltke adjusted the plan, reducing the proportional distribution of the forces, lessening the crucial right wing in favor of a slightly more defensive strategy.\n\nAlso, judging Holland unlikely to grant permission to cross its borders, the plan was revised to make a direct move through Belgium, and an artillery assault on the Belgian city of Liège.\n\nWith the rail lines and the unprecedented firepower the German army brought, Moltke did not expect any significant defense of the fortress.\n\nThe significance of the Schlieffen Plan is that it forced German military planners to prepare for a pre-emptive strike when war was deemed unavoidable.\n\nOtherwise Russia would have time to mobilize and crush Germany with its massive army.\n\nOn August 1, Kaiser Wilhelm II briefly became convinced that it might be possible to ensure French and British neutrality, and cancelled the plan despite the objections of the Chief of Staff that this could not be done, and resuming it only when the offer of a neutral France and Britain was withdrawn.\n\nIt appears that no war planners in any country had prepared effectively for the Schlieffen Plan.\n\nThe French were not concerned about such a move. They were confident their offensive (Plan XVII) would break the German center and cut off the German right wing moving through Belgium.\n\nThey also expected that an early Russian offensive in East Prussia would tie down German forces.\n\nAssassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria\n\nOn 28 June 1914, Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria, heir presumptive to the Austro-Hungarian throne, and his wife, Sophie, Duchess of Hohenberg, were shot dead in Sarajevo, by Gavrilo Princip, one of a group of six Bosnian Serb assassins coordinated by Danilo Ilić.\n\nThe political objective of the assassination was to break off Austria-Hungary’s south-Slav provinces so they could be combined into a Greater Serbia or a Yugoslavia.\n\nThe assassins’ motives were consistent with the movement that later became known as ‘Young Bosnia’. Serbian military officers stood behind the attack.\n\nAt the top of these Serbian military conspirators was Chief of Serbian Military Intelligence, Dragutin Dimitrijević, his righthand man Major Vojislav Tankosić, and Masterspy Rade Malobabić. Major Tankosić armed (with bombs and pistols) and trained the assassins, and the assassins were given access to the same clandestine tunnel of safe-houses and agents that Rade Malobabić used for the infiltration of weapons and operatives into Austria-Hungary.\n\nThe assassins, the key members of the clandestine tunnel, and the key Serbian military conspirators who were still alive were arrested, tried, convicted and punished.\n\nThose who were arrested in Bosnia were tried in Sarajevo in October 1914.\n\nThe other conspirators were arrested and tried before a Serbian kangaroo court on the French-controlled Salonika Front in 1916–1917 on unrelated false charges; Serbia executed three of the top military conspirators.\n\nMuch of what is known about the assassinations comes from these two trials and related records.\n\nAssignment of responsibility for the bombing and murders of 28 June is highly controversial because the attack led to the outbreak of World War I one month later.\n\nConsequences\n\nThe murder of the heir to the Austro-Hungarian Empire and his wife produced widespread shock across Europe, and there was initially much sympathy for the Austrian position.\n\nWithin two days of the assassination, Austria-Hungary and Germany advised Serbia that it should open an investigation, but Secretary General to the Serbian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Slavko Gruic, replied “Nothing had been done so far and the matter did not concern the Serbian Government.”\n\nAn angry exchange followed between the Austrian Chargé d’Affaires at Belgrade and Gruic.\n\nAfter conducting a criminal investigation, verifying that Germany would honor its military alliance, and persuading the skeptical Hungarian Count Tisza, Austria-Hungary issued a formal letter to the government of Serbia.\n\n© Copyright Peter Crawford 2013\n\nSerbia was a state in the Balkans that came into existence as a result of the Serbian Revolution which lasted between 1804 and 1817. Despite serious and extremely brutal oppression and revenge by the Ottoman authorities, the revolutionary leaders, first Karađorđe Petrović and then Miloš Obrenović I, succeeded in their goal to liberate Serbia after centuries of Ottoman rule.\n\nThe letter reminded Serbia of its commitment to respect the Great Powers’ decision regarding Bosnia-Herzegovina, and to maintain good neighborly relations with Austria-Hungary.\n\nThe letter contained specific demands aimed at preventing the publication of propaganda advocating the violent destruction of Austria-Hungary, removing the people behind this propaganda from the Serbian Military, arresting the people on Serbian soil who were involved in the assassination plot and preventing the clandestine shipment of arms and explosives from Serbia to Austria-Hungary.\n\nThis letter became known as the ‘July Ultimatum’, and Austria-Hungary stated that if Serbia did not accept all of the demands in total within 48 hours, it would recall its ambassador from Serbia.\n\nAfter receiving a telegram of support from Russia, Serbia mobilized its army and responded to the letter by completely accepting point #8 demanding an end to the smuggling of weapons and punishment of the frontier officers who had assisted the assassins and completely accepting point #10 which demanded Serbia report the execution of the required measures as they were completed.\n\nSerbia partially accepted, finessed, disingenuously answered or politely rejected elements of the preamble and enumerated demands #1–7 and #9.\n\nThe shortcomings of Serbia’s response were published by Austria-Hungary and can be seen beginning on page 364 of Origins of the War, Vol. II by Albertini, with the Austrian complaints placed side-by-side against Serbia’s response.\n\nAustria-Hungary responded by breaking diplomatic relations.\n\nThe next day, Serbian reservists being transported on tramp steamers on the Danube crossed onto the Austro-Hungarian side of the river at Temes-Kubin and Austro-Hungarian soldiers fired into the air to warn them off.\n\nThe report of this incident was initially sketchy and reported to Emperor Franz-Joseph as “a considerable skirmish”.\n\nAustria-Hungary then declared war and mobilized the portion of its army that would face the (already mobilized) Serbian Army on 28 July 1914.\n\nErzherzog Franz Ferdinand von Österreich\n\nUnder the Secret Treaty of 1892 Russia and France were obliged to mobilize their armies if any of the Triple Alliance mobilized.\n\nRussia’s mobilization set off full Austro-Hungarian and German mobilizations.\n\nSoon all the Great Powers except Italy had chosen sides and gone to war.\n\nA review of the consequences of the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria shows that it was the initial actions of the Serbian Government (see above – Serbian military officers stood behind the attack – probably members of the Black Hand – an organisation formed on 6 September 1901 by members of the Serbian Army).\n\nDragutin Dimitrijević Apis (right) and his associates\n\nChief of Serbian Military Intelligence Dragutin Dimitrijević Apis stated that he had organized the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria, in Sarajevo on June 28, 1914 –\n\n(the assassin was Гаврило Принцип – (Gavrilo Princip) – who was an athiest.\n\nГаврило Принцип – (Gavrilo Princip)\n\nGavrilo Princip was born in the remote village of Obljaj near Bosansko Grahovo, at the time de jure part of Bosnia Vilayet within the Ottoman Empire, however the province had since 1878 been occupied by Austria-Hungary which governed it as its condominium, a de facto part of Austria-Hungary. Princip was too young to receive the death penalty, being only twenty-seven days short of his twentieth birthday at the time of the assassination. Instead, he received the maximum sentence of twenty years in prison. He was held in harsh conditions which were worsened by the war. He contracted tuberculosis,[3] and had one of his arms amputated in 1917 when the disease infected an arm bone (probably because of a badly performed procedure to repair a bone broken during his capture).[10] He died on 28 April 1918 at Terezín 3 years and 10 months after he assassinated the Archduke and Duchess. At the time of his death, Princip weighed around 40 kilograms (88 lb), weakened by malnutrition, blood loss from his amputated arm, and disease.\n\nHis politics are unclear. Some of his associates were Muslims. ).\n\n– in the process, Dragutin Dimitrijević Apis used not only his power over elements of the Serbian military, but also the Black Hand.\n\nDragutin Dimitrijević was born in Belgrade in 1876. At sixteen Dimitrijević went to the Belgrade Military Academy. A brilliant student, Dimitrijević was recruited into the General Staff of the Serbian Army immediately after his graduation.\n\nCaptain Dimitrijević and a group of junior officers planned the assassination of the autocratic and unpopular king of Serbia. On 11 June 1903, the group stormed the royal palace and killed both King Alexander and his wife Queen Draga. During the attack Dimitrijević was badly wounded, and, although he eventually recovered, the three bullets from the encounter were never removed from his body. When Dimitrijević heard that Archduke Franz Ferdinand was planning to visit Sarajevo in June 1914, he sent three members of the Young Bosnia group, Gavrilo Princip, Nedeljko Čabrinović, Trifko Grabež and four others from Serbia to assassinate him. At this time, Dimitrijević was Chief of Serbian Military Intelligence.\n\nLeaders of the Black Hand in turn had penetrated Narodna Obrana and used the Narodna organization to infiltrate the arms and assassins into Sarajevo.\n\nSo it can be categorically stated that responsibility for the ‘Great War’ lies with the actions of the Serbian Government.\n\nSubsequently Serbian reservists were mobilized and moved into Austro-Hungarian territory.\n\nIn response to this invasion of their territory (combined with the assassination of the heir to the Austrian th"
