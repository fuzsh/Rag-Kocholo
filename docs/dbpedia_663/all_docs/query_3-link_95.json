        "text": "Sotheby’s Master Paintings Evening Sale in New York on 29 January 2020\n\nMASTER OF THE BRUGES LEGEND OF SAINT URSULA, CIRCA 1480-1485 | MADONNA AND CHILD, HALF LENGTH, WITH AN EXTENSIVE LANDSCAPE SEEN THROUGH TWO WINDOWS BEYOND\n\nLUCAS CRANACH THE ELDER | THE LEFT AND RIGHT INTERNAL WINGS OF THE FEILITZSCH ALTARPIECE: SAINT PETER WITH A DONOR, PROBABLY JOBST VON FEILITZSCH; SAINT PAUL\n\nGiovanni Battista Tiepolo, Madonna of The Rosary with Angels. Signed and dated on the pedestal: JOA. BATTA: TIEPOLVZ.F. / ...1735, oil on canvas, 96¾ by 61½ in.; 246 by 156 cm. Estimate in excess of $15 million. Courtesy Sotheby's.\n\nSotheby’s announced that one of the greatest works by Giovanni Battista Tiepolo remaining in private hands will be offered as the headline work in their Master Paintings Evening Sale in New York on 29 January 2020. Painted in 1735, The Madonna of the Rosary with Angels is an important early work by the great Venetian artist, dating from a period that is considered one of the artist’s most significant and one that brought him recognition as among the greatest painters of 18th-century Europe. Other Tiepolo altarpieces from this time hang in prominent churches and museums throughout the world, establishing the forthcoming auction as a rarified event. Estimated to achieve in excess of $15 million, the monumental painting is one of the rarest and most significant works by Tiepolo ever to come to market.\n\nTiepolo is widely regarded as Venice’s foremost artist in the 18th-century, whose decorative and imaginative style not only had a profound and lasting impact on Italian art, but was also a vital precursor to Romanticism and the Belle Époque movements. Major works of such astounding quality by Tiepolo are rare on the international market, for much of his work was carried out in frescoes and altarpieces that remain in situ. The present work last appeared at auction at Sotheby’s in 1989, where it made a record £1.3 million / $2.1 million.\n\nChristopher Apostle, Head of Sotheby’s Old Master Paintings Department in New York, said: “Tiepolo is one of those seminal figures— so imaginative and innovative – to have completely transformed the way we view art. An artist rooted in the tradition of his Venetian predecessors Titian and Veronese, he was at the same time incredibly modern, able to tailor his works to suit the tastes of the time. Proof of his genius is in the painterly ability to express beauty, from highlighting the sensual apparel and fabrics of silk and satin, transforming painted figures into three dimensions, to his bold application of color and treatment of light.”\n\nSigned and dated 1735, the altarpiece is a work of his early maturity, a period in which Tiepolo fused the dramatic composition, grand scale and bold coloring of his Italian Renaissance paintings with the fantastical, theatrical elements of the Grand Manner. In the present altarpiece, the Virgin holds a rosary in her outstretched left hand as if offering the beads to a devotee, and she wears the less typical red cloak that associated her with royalty, as well as the roses that each prayer in the rosary symbolizes. The gold brocade hanging behind the Madonna recalls early Venetian masters like Giovanni Bellini, and the attendant angel kneeling in the left foreground echoes the placement of similar figures in the works of Mannerist painters Correggio and Parmigianino.\n\nThe overall emotion and grandiosity of the Venetian masters Titian, Tintoretto, and Veronese is evident in Tiepolo's works from the 1730s, and paying homage to these artists was likely encouraged by his patrons. Further, the work bears stylistic similarities with the artist’s Adoration of the Christ Child, which is presently displayed in St. Mark’s, Venice. Both paintings are boldly composed and colored and demonstrate Tiepolo’s theatrical flair.\n\nDespite the artist’s prominent signature and date, as well as the monumental size of the canvas, the original location of the altar where the painting resided has yet to be determined. It was most likely commissioned for a Dominican church, which was the order that is most closely associated with promulgating the Rosary throughout Europe. Tiepolo would have been aware of the popular devotional practice, as it enjoyed renewed emphasis during the papacy of the Dominican Pope Benedict XIII (1724 –30).\n\nPrior to 1735, Tiepolo had received no major commissions for church altarpieces in Venice, the demand for such work there in the 1730s having slackened considerably. Instead, it may have been produced for some ecclesiastical site in or near Udine, where Tiepolo was employed at the time.\n\nBy the early nineteenth century, Tiepolo’s altarpiece had made its way to England, and the first documented owner of the painting was John Webb, Esq., who amassed an impressive collection of Old Masters, including works by Raphael, Giulio Romano, Caravaggio, David, Greuze, Rembrandt, and Velazquez. The next owner of the illustrious altarpiece was Hugh Andrew Johnstone Munro, called Munro of Novar, a close friend and patron of J.M.W. Turner who also owned Tiepolo's Martyrdom of St. Agatha (circa 1755), now in Berlin's Gemäldegalerie.\n\nBoth works by Tiepolo were sold by Munro's heirs in 1878 and purchased by Galerie Sedelmeyer, and both later entered the collection of Sir Joseph Robinson, South African gold and diamond magnate and politician. Robinson purchased Dudley House in London in 1894 and began collecting to fill his 80-foot picture gallery. At the age of eighty-five, in 1923, he took the decision to sell his collection at Christie’s. However, upon arriving at the auction rooms the night before, wheelchair-bound, in order to say a final goodbye to his beloved pictures, he fell in love with them all over again and proceeded to apply prohibitively high reserves on the lots so that, in the end, just twelve of the one hundred and sixteen lots found buyers, and the remainder, including the present Tiepolo, returned to store. The Tiepolo and much of the collection passed to Robinson's daughter, Ida Louise, who married Conte Natale Labia, Italian ambassador to South Africa (d. 1936), and remained in the family until their two sons sold some of the paintings, including this one, at Sotheby’s in 1989.\n\nSotheby’s has also announced that Sir Peter Paul Rubens’ The Virgin and Christ Child, With Saints Elizabeth and John the Baptist will be offered as a highlight of Sotheby’s Masters Week in January 2020, marking the first appearance of the work at auction since 1946, where it is estimated to achieve $6/8 million. The annual week of auctions at Sotheby’s New York features masterworks spanning six centuries of the pre-Modern period, including impressive Old Master Paintings, Drawings, Sculpture and 19th Century European Art.\n\nSir Peter Paul Rubens (Siegen 1577 - 1640 Antwerp), The Virgin And Christ Child, with St. Elizabeth and St. John the Baptist. Oil on panel, 47⅞ by 37⅝ in.; 121.6 by 95.5 cm. Estimate $6/8 million. Courtesy Sotheby's.\n\nSir Peter Paul Rubens (1577 – 1640) is one of the most well-known and revered artists of the Flemish Baroque style that flourished in the early 17th century. Though he resided in Antwerp, Rubens traveled throughout Europe and his influence was for felt for generations. The present painting is a large-scale work on panel depicting the popular subject of the apocryphal meeting of the Christ Child and young John the Baptist, which is believed to derive from the Meditationes Vitae Christi, attributed to St. Bonaventure. The scene was particularly common in Italian paintings of the time, and Rubens would have drawn inspiration for his work from Leonardo’s well-known depiction of the subject as well as a version by Guilio Romano, which was acquired as a Raphael in 1604 by Rubens’ Italian patron, the Duke of Mantua.\n\nWhile the present painting was studied by renowned Rubens’ scholar Ludwig Burchard just after the end of World War II, it was not widely known to other by scholars and researchers. Having remained in private collections since it was last sold at auction in 1946 at Sotheby’s London, and only publicly exhibited once in 1951 in New York, the painting was unseen by the scholarly community until it was brought to the attention of Sotheby’s Chairman George Wachter and Senior Vice President for Old Masters, Otto Naumann.\n\nWorking with Rubens scholars Fiona Healy and Arnout Balis, Naumann concluded that the present painting is indeed the prime version of the composition, and that other previously known examples are either copies or can be attributed to his workshop. Notable among these is a well-known version from the Thyssen-Bornemisza Collection in Madrid, which is presently on long-term loan to the Museum of Catalan Art in Barcelona, It was most recently attributed in a Thyssen Collection catalog as an “autograph replica c. 1618…possibly executed with studio assistance.”\n\nNaumann’s research of the present painting included independent scientific examination including dendrochronological analysis (tree-ring dating) of the painting’s wooden panels by Professor Peter Klein, which concluded the painting could have a plausible creation as early as 1610. With the aid of scientific dating, Naumann’s research positions the present painting as the earlier and original edition from which all other known examples were based, and it was likely executed three to six years after Rubens returned to Antwerp from Rome in 1608.\n\nThe Thyssen version, which has been dated to circa 1618, also bears significant stylistic differences to the present painting, which can be attributed plausibly to the introduction of Anthony van Dyck into Rubens’ studio around 1614. Van Dyck’s elegant manner of painting and his characteristic quality of grace are apparent in the Thyssen version, which is notably softer in the faces of the Virgin and St. Elizabeth, and in the sculptural folds of Mary’s red robe. These changes, among others, demonstrate that the Thyssen version is an artful reinterpretation of the present original.\n\nThe timely rediscovery of this masterpiece and the dedicated research spearheaded by Otto Naumann and his colleagues have resulted in its planned inclusion in a forthcoming volume by Fiona Healy of the Corpus Rubenianum Ludwig Burchard dedicated to The Holy Trinity: The Life of Virgin, Madonnas, The Holy Family.\n\nRecently rediscovered drawing for his famed series The Triumphs of Caesar. Estimated to achieve in excess of $12 Million. Courtesy Sotheby's.\n\nSotheby’s will offer one of the most art-historically important drawings ever to appear at auction: Andrea Mantegna’s only known preparatory drawing for one of the canvases in the Triumphs of Caesar, the Italian Renaissance artist’s most influential and revered work. Recently rediscovered, the masterwork will headline Sotheby’s Old Master Drawings auction in New York on the 29th of January 2020, when it is estimated to fetch in excess of $12 million.\n\nAndrea Mantegna (c. 1431-1506) was one of the most innovative, influential and celebrated artists of the Italian Renaissance. His importance was very recently underscored by the major exhibition, Mantegna and Bellini, dedicated to his work and that of his brother-in-law Giovanni Bellini, held at the National Gallery, London, and the Gemäldegalerie, Berlin. Approximately 20 drawings by Mantegna are known, all except two (including the present work) are in the collections of major museums, such as the British Museum in London. The sale of this drawing is of enormous significance: only two other drawings by Mantegna have appeared at auction in the last half century.\n\nDated to the late 1480s, the drawing is the only known preparatory study for Mantegna’s famed and celebrated masterpiece, the Triumphs of Caesar – a series of nine monumental paintings depicting the triumphal procession of Julius Caesar and his army through ancient Rome. The paintings are part of the British Royal Collection at Hampton Court Palace, where they have resided since they were acquired by King Charles I in 1629. The King bought the paintings directly from the Gonzaga family, Dukes of Mantua, who were Mantegna’s most important patrons.\n\nThe present pen and ink drawing is a study for ‘The Standard Bearers and the Siege Equipment,’ which is the second canvas in the Triumphs series. The drawing theatrically recreates a section of the processional that includes gigantic statues on carts, a model of the tower of Alexandria, and oversized siege weapons.\n\nThough sold as an autograph work by Mantegna in 1885, the drawing subsequently disappeared into private collections, and was totally unknown to scholars until shortly before the Mantegna and Bellini exhibition in London and Berlin. Its inclusion in that exhibition caused much excitement, but only since the exhibition have other extremely significant aspects of the drawing been identified, following further careful research by Cristiana Romalli, Senior Director and Italian specialist in Sotheby’s Old Master Drawings Department. On the basis of new technical analysis using infrared photography, performed by Sotheby’s Department of Scientific Research, Romalli was able to establish that the main figure on the left side of the composition was altered very significantly during the process of the drawing’s creation. Underneath the figure of Aesculapius, the Greek god of medicine, which appears in the finished drawing and the final painted version, there is actually another entirely different figure, identified by Romalli as Helios, the Roman god of the Sun, which the artist chose to obliterate and replace as he developed his composition.\n\nThis change conclusively proves that Mantegna himself was the author of the drawing, and this remarkable and unexpected discovery sheds exciting light on Mantegna’s restless working method, in which he continued to edit, refine and perfect his compositions, even in the final stages. Moreover, it is unquestionable proof that this is the only known surviving preparatory study for the Triumphs.\n\nSpeaking of the drawing, Cristiana Romalli said: “The discovery of a previously unseen underdrawing, more than five hundred years after it was made, is a moment of considerable importance for the study of this complex, intriguing and highly influential master of the early Italian Renaissance. By examination under special filtered infrared light, we were able to detect the hidden figure of Helios, revealing a major change in the composition that proves Mantegna’s authorship. This change in fact defined his whole approach to the finished painting that we see today. The exceptional and rare opportunity to bring to light this news, obscured for centuries, is what defines the excitement and thrill of the drawings market. It is a great privilege to be handling the sale of a drawing of such extraordinary importance and rarity.”\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nEdward Hopper - Fondation Beyeler\n\nFondation Beyeler in Basel\n\n26 January to 17 May 2020\n\nEdward Hopper (1882–1967) is widely acknowledged as one of the most significant artists of the 20th century. In Europe, he is known mainly for his oil paintings of urban life scenes dating from the 1920s to 1960s, some of which have become highly popular images. Less attention has so far been paid to his landscapes. Surprisingly, no exhibition to date has dealt comprehensively with Hopper’s approach to American landscape. From 26 January to 17 May 2020, the Fondation Beyeler in Basel is presenting an extensive exhibition of iconic landscape paintings in oil as well as a selection of watercolors and drawings. This will also be the first time Hopper’s works are shown in an exhibition in German-speaking Switzerland.\n\nHopper was born in Nyack, New York. After training as an illustrator, he studied painting at the New York School of Art until 1906. Next to German, French and Russian literature, the young artist found key reference points in painters such as Diego Velázquez, Francisco de Goya, Gustave Courbet and Édouard Manet. Although Hopper long worked mainly as an illustrator, his fame rests primarily on his oil paintings, which attest to his deep interest in color and his virtuosity in representing light and shadow. Moreover, on the basis of his observations Hopper was able to establish a personal aesthetics that has influenced not\n\nonly painting but also popular culture, photography and film.\n\nThe idea for this exhibition arose when Cape Ann Granite, a landscape painted by Edward Hopper in 1928, joined the collection of the Fondation Beyeler as a permanent loan [it sold at Christie's in 2018]. For several decades, the work belonged to the celebrated Rockefeller collection, and it dates from a time in which Hopper received growing attention from critics, curators and the public. In 1929, he was thus invited to take part in the Museum of Modern Art’s second exhibition, Paintings by Nineteen Living Americans.\n\nIn the art-historical tradition, “landscape” signifies an image of nature as opposed to ever-changing actual “nature”, which as such cannot be fixed as an image. Landscape painting always shows the impact of man on nature and Hopper’s paintings reflect this in a subtle and multifaceted way. He thus established a distinctly modern approach to a time-honored genre of art history. Unlike academic tradition, Hopper’s landscapes seem unbounded; in one’s mind, they are infinite and always appear to be showing only a small part of an immense whole.\n\nHopper’s American landscapes are geometrically clear compositions. Their main elements are houses, symbolizing human settlement. Railroad tracks structure the images horizontally and stand for man’s endeavor to conquer wide expanses of space. A vast sky as well as specific lighting moods − bright midday sunlight and the glimmer of dusk − illustrate the immensity and constant transformation of nature even in an actually static landscape painting. A lighthouse can thus become a point of reference in the vastness of the sea and the coastline.\n\nHopper’s landscape paintings seem to deal with something invisible, occurring outside the image, as illustrated for example by Cape Cod Morning (1950): a woman is looking out from a bay window, her face bathed in sunlight, staring at something the viewer cannot see because it is located beyond the pictorial space. Hopper’s visible landscapes always have an invisible, subjective counterpart that appears inside the viewer. As is the case with all his paintings, Hopper’s landscapes are defined by melancholy and loneliness. They often convey a sense of eeriness and apprehension. Hopper also shows the sometimes brutal intrusion of man into nature by confronting natural and urban landscapes. Hopper played a major role in establishing the notion of a melancholy America, defined also by the dark sides of progress – a vast, unlimited space, which became immensely popular especially through its development in films such as Alfred Hitchcock’s North by Northwest (1959), Wim Wenders’ Paris, Texas (1984) or Kevin Costner’s Dances with Wolves (1990).\n\nAs a special highlight, filmmaker Wim Wenders has produced a 3D short film entitled Two or Three Things I Know about Hopper, screened in a dedicated room. The film is Wenders’ personal tribute to Edward Hopper, who made a lasting impression on him and influenced his cinematic work. He travelled across the USA on a quest for “Hopper’s spirit”, condensing the resulting footage into a film that will premiere at the exhibition’s opening. In a poetic and moving way, the film shows just how indebted cinema is to Edward Hopper as well as the extent to which Hopper was in turn influenced by movies.\n\nThe exhibition Edward Hopper comprises 65 works dating from 1909 to 1965. It is organized by the Fondation Beyeler in cooperation with the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, the worldwide major repository of Hopper’s work.\n\n↧\n\nEdvard Munch and the Cycle of Life: Prints from the National Gallery of A\n\nChrysler Museum of Art\n\nFebruary 28–May 17, 2020\n\nThe Chrysler Museum of Art will present its first-ever exhibition of Edvard Munch’s iconic works in Edvard Munch and the Cycle of Life: Prints from the National Gallery of Art. On view February 28–May 17, 2020, the show will consist of 50 prints, including The Scream and Madonna. It will include images Munch developed for his 1902 exhibition Frieze of Life, as well as the entire 1908–1909 series Alpha and Omega, his invented story of the first humans. The exhibition will also offer Munch’s satirical look at his own life and failures at love.\n\n“The work of the Norwegian artist has come to symbolize the crisis of modern life. The Chrysler’s exhibition is an original concept that focuses on Munch’s career-long obsession with the theme of the cycle of life, from the seeds of love and the passing of love to anxiety and death,” said Lloyd DeWitt, Ph.D., the Chrysler’s chief curator and Irene Leache Curator of European art.\n\nMunch’s early years were marred by illness, tragedy and death as his mother and sister both succumbed to tuberculosis. He suffered from anxiety and depression as well as chronic bronchitis yet developed a successful avant-garde artistic career in Kristiania (present-day Oslo), Norway. While the many lonesome figures in his work suggest he was a solitary figure, he was highly involved in the bohemian and artistic life of Kristiania, as well as Paris and Berlin, as the first section of the Chrysler’s exhibition explores. He illustrated programs for the renowned Norwegian playwright Henrik Ibsen and made a portrait of the leading French poet Stephan Mallarmé.\n\nThe second section looks at the cycle of life and includes prints connected to Munch’s 1902 exhibition, Frieze of Life. The project grew out of images from the mid-1890s on the theme of love, like Madonna and Attraction. Munch expanded these into the Frieze first exhibited in Berlin in 1902. Included were images on death, such as In the Land of Crystals of 1897, and anxiety displayed in The Scream of 1895. The lithograph version in the exhibition is one of only 25 impressions of the print that exist today. The iconic image documents a dusk stroll in Kristiania during which the sky turned bright red and Munch experienced the “scream heard through all nature.” The unusual face of the screaming figure may have been based on an ancient Peruvian mummy he saw at the Universal Exposition of 1889 in Paris. The focus on the cycle of life allowed Munch to process the many traumas and psychological challenges he faced, principally anxiety and addiction, which led to his 1908 hospitalization in Copenhagen. His psychiatrist used modern treatments, including a version of electroshock therapy. During his eight months of treatment, he produced Alpha and Omega.\n\nOften revisiting themes in the Frieze of Life that focused on love, separation and death, Alpha and Omega chronicles the story of “the first humans” who live and die on an island. The characters are inspired by Munch and Tulla Larsen, a much younger woman with whom he had a disastrous affair that terminated in Munch’s suicide threat and gunshot wound that disfigured one of his fingers. Munch frequented the Copenhagen Zoo while under treatment and satirized Larsen’s friends as different zoo animals that ultimately attack and kill Alpha, ending the story and closing the cycle of life. The works in this exhibition show a remarkable side of Munch, who unflinchingly confronts his failures and inner demons through his powerful imagery.\n\n“These are fragile prints that can only be exhibited every few years in order to protect them against light exposure so that future generations can enjoy them,” said DeWitt. “The National Gallery of Art and the Epstein family have been exceptionally generous in lending an astounding 50 sheets so that our audience can experience the full range of work of one of the most well-known and powerful artists ofthe 19th and 20th centuries.”\n\n↧\n\nHENRY MARTIN GASSER\n\n↧\n\nFriday the 24th marks the 100th anniversary of the passing of Amedeo Modigliani\n\nFriday the 24th marks the 100th anniversary of the passing of Amedeo Modigliani. I realize anniversaries of deaths normally aren't newsworthy however it was a remarkable event.\n\nMost importantly is that his funeral procession from the pauper's hospital to Pere Lachaise cemetery included just about every modern artist in Paris.\n\nBut also that his passing tended to bring him the recognition he deserved yet didn't adequately receive during his career.\n\nMany historians agree that when the \"Prince of Montparnasse\" passed away it marked the end of the era of Bohemian lifestyle so many modern artists enjoyed during that special period of collaboration in Paris.\n\nOf course there was also the melancholy drama of Jeanne Hebuterne, his lover pregnant with his 2nd child who leaped to her death the morning after he died.\n\nI was surprised that none of the Modigliani aficionados in the US planned any kind of commemoration.

The year 2019 marks the 450th anniversary of artist Pieter Bruegel the Elder’s death, and to commemorate it, the DIA’s Conservation department and the European Art department collaborated to trace the life of the painting from its creation in 1566 to the present, including the story behind the DIA’s exciting acquisition of the work in 1930.\n\n\"The Wedding Dance,\" 1566, Pieter Bruegel the Elder, Netherlandish; oil on wood panel. Detroit Institute of Arts.\n\nThe DIA was the second museum in the U.S. to acquire a painting by Bruegel, and it soon became one of the museum’s most prized and beloved works. This exhibition features three other works from the DIA’s collection, as well as conservation images (x-ray and infrared), archival materials, pigments and a variety of tools inspired by Bruegel’s complex quest to source and create the colors used in the painting. The exhibition will be located in Special Exhibitions Central, adjacent to the Detroit Industry murals.\n\nNewly acquired, this print by van der Heyden after Bruegel the Elder’s design helps illustrates the popularity of The Wedding Dance after its creation.\n\nThe first gallery starts with the DIA’s acquisition process, which includes archival telegrams from DIA director Wilhelm Valentiner (1880–1958) during his trip to Europe in 1930. Following the acquisition of this work, the exhibition delves into the major 1941 conservation treatment by legendary conservator William Suhr (1896–1984), where the records of his careful and deliberate treatment of the work will be displayed, including the discovery of the codpieces, which shocked patrons and created buzz in the news.\n\nComposite image of the Wedding Dance depicting half of the painting in normal light and the other half in infrared.\n\nIn the central gallery the painting itself will reside in the middle of the room, unframed and in a case that allows for the public to observe it in the round. This space will also focus on the visual analysis of the painting where conservators utilized the DIA’s science and imaging labs, allowing mysteries to be uncovered using technology. In the final gallery of the exhibition, the public will be brought to the moment of the painting’s creation. DIA conservators were able to not only identify the techniques and materials used by Bruegel, but they were able to trace the origins and manufacturing of some of the painting’s pigments, revealing how time consuming and temperamental some were to acquire or produce.\n\n”This exhibition gives our visitors a special opportunity to explore the science behind the work we do here at the DIA,” said Salvador Salort-Pons, DIA Director. “This painting is a treasure in our collection, and by experiencing its history and background, visitors will gain a new understanding of not only the work of Bruegel himself, but also museum curators and conservators.”\n\nThe Wedding Dance was one of many works by Bruegel, whose depictions of leisurely and sometimes joyful scenes of peasant life made him one of the most influential artists of his time. His work inspired generations of family members, all following in a similar style. This exhibition will be accompanied by volume 93 of the Bulletin of the Detroit Institute of Arts devoted to an art historical and conservation overview of the picture.\n\nA companion show titled “From Bruegel to Rembrandt: Dutch and Flemish Prints and Drawings from 1500 to 1700” will also be on view at the DIA starting February 15–July 26, 2020.\n\n↧\n\nFrom Bruegel to Rembrandt: Dutch and Flemish Prints and Drawings from 1550 to 1700\n\nDetroit Institute of Arts (DIA)\n\nFebruary 15–July 26, 2020\n\nThe Detroit Institute of Arts (DIA) presents an exhibition of prints and drawings from artists such as Pieter Bruegel the Elder and Rembrandt in “From Bruegel to Rembrandt: Dutch and Flemish Prints and Drawings from 1550 to 1700” on view Saturday, February 15–July 26, 2020. This exhibition is in conjunction with “Bruegel’s The Wedding Dance Revealed.”\n\nThe exhibition features more than 100 prints and drawings from the DIA’s permanent collection. From elaborate engravings by Hendrick Goltzius (1558–1617) to the use of dots, dashes and “squiggles” by Rembrandt (1606–1669), Bruegel to Rembrandt reveals the range of printmaking techniques and styles used in the 16th and 17th centuries.\n\n“Self Portrait in a Velvet Cap with Plume,” 1638, Rembrandt Harmensz van Rijn, Dutch; etching printed in black ink on laid paper. Detroit Institute of Arts:\n\nDrawings by Dutch and Flemish masters span lively portrait sketches to detailed preparatory drawings and were used by artists as brainstorming “sessions” for more complex works or as visual references for future pieces.\n\nVisitors will be able to view the works through the eyes of the artists, who turned to everyday subjects, portraying the landscape and people around them with humor and loving detail. The themes include representation of everyday life, the importance of landscape, the role of Greek and Roman classical models and the use of religious imagery during the Counter-Reformation.\n\n“This exhibition shows the incredible depth of Dutch and Flemish art in the DIA collection. It includes selections from the encyclopedic collection of prints and drawings gathered in the 1880s by newspaper magnate James E. Scripps (1835-1906) and given by his widow, Mrs. Harriet J. Scripps (1838-1933) in 1909, as well as rare drawings identified by DIA director Wilhelm Valentiner (1880–1958) during the 1920s and 1930s,” said Clare Rogan, DIA curator of prints and drawings. “Over the years we have continued to collect treasures in this area and the pieces in this exhibition include some of the more fun or ‘quirky’ prints and drawings from our collection from this time period.”\n\n↧\n\nDrawing on a Legacy: Highlights from the John Driscoll American Drawings Collection\n\n↧\n\nArt History News December - January\n\nDrawing on a Legacy: Highlights from the John Driscoll American Drawings Collection\n\nJonathan KantrowitzatArt History News - 1 week ago\n\n*Palmer Museum of Art* *January 21st - June 7th 2020* [image: John William Hill, Under the Falls, Niagara, c. 1870] John William Hill, *Under the Falls, Niagara*, c. 1870, watercolor on paper, 29 x 21½ inches.

It figures in key movements in European art, from Renaissance grotesques to Rococo interiors, on through Art Nouveau and beyond. Bridging cultures and materials, arabesque did not settle into a single form or style but rather burst open the aesthetic possibilities available to artists, tracing a winding path from decorative border to overall principle of design. The nineteenth-century flowering of this motif is explored in the Clark Art Institute's exhibition Arabesque, on view December 14, 2019-March 22, 2020. Forty-five works across a variety of media trace the development of the arabesque line from the highly detailed compositions of the German Romantics through the pictorial experiments of Nabi and Art Nouveau artists.\n\n\"The Arabesque exhibition provides a fascinating look at the influence of this beautiful design motif across generations and across a number of artistic disciplines. Drawn from museum collections across the country-as well as works from the Clark's own collection and that of our neighbors at the Williams College Museum of Art-it is a visually stunning display that will encourage our visitors to explore the evolution of this important decorative motif and its influence on so many artistic movements,\" said Olivier Meslay, Hardymon Director of the Clark. \"We are indebted to the many generous lenders who help to bring these works to the Clark, and to Clark Trustee Denise Littlefield Sobel, who provided generous support to the exhibition.\"\n\n\"Arabesque has complex cultural origins, and its reception by nineteenth-century European artists offers a fascinating story to tell,\" said Anne Leonard, Manton Curator of Prints, Drawings, and Photographs, and curator of the exhibition. \"It was an engine for experimentation, not just in the visual arts but also in music, dance, and literature. This exhibition and its related programs will present arabesque as a kind of inter-arts metaphor for imaginative freedom and formal innovation.\"\n\nRococo to Romanticism\n\nUntil about 1800, arabesque in European art typically served as a decorative addition to a central motif or larger design. That began to change with German Romantic artists such as Philipp Otto Runge (1777-1810), Peter von Cornelius (1783-1867), and Eugen Napoleon Neureuther (1806-1882). Inspired by developments in the literary realm, these artists pushed the boundaries of arabesque with experimental designs that crept well out of the traditional frame, sometimes occupying the entire composition.\n\nNeureuther's drawing The Ballad of Lenore (1835) illustrates Gottfried August Bürger's poem of a young woman carried off to the grave of her lover, a soldier who has been killed in war and returns as a ghost. The sheet is remarkable for its compression of the narrative into five vignettes on a single sheet, divided by arabesque borders.\n\nIn Adolph Menzel's (German, 1815-1905) etching The Willow Tree (1843), the artist has shaped the trailing branches of the willow tree and joined them to the stalks of ground plants to form a continuous frame around the image. Menzel molds nature to the demands of art while presenting a scene of chivalric romance, comically watched over by a treetop figure.\n\nThe medieval flavor of The Willow Tree recurs in a red ink drawing by Walter Crane (English, 1845-1915), Prince Charming in the Forest (undated). Like Menzel, Crane has formed tree branches into a sinuous pattern that both conceals and reveals the drawing's story. The image emerges from a negative space of surrounding foliage, with sprigs jutting out at three of the four corners. In both works, the arabesque line is central without overwhelming the composition or its narrative.\n\nIslamic-Inspired Arabesque\n\nThe term arabesque, a French word derived from the Italian \"arabesco,\" speaks to the motif's origins in the art and architecture of the Middle East and North Africa. But by the end of the eighteenth century, artists had little awareness of its origins outside of Europe. That began to change in the nineteenth century with a new historical awareness that prompted artists and designers to understand the roots of ornamental styles used in different times and places.\n\nOne of the most important figures to document the history and sources of arabesque design was the British architect and writer Owen Jones (English, 1809-1874), whose lavishly illustrated Alhambra (1842) and The Grammar of Ornament (1856) became essential sourcebooks for European artists and designers. Jones traveled to Spain's Alhambra Palace in 1834 and 1837 and made drawings that became the basis for his illustrations, lending authenticity to the volumes. Full-page plates from both of these fundamental publications are included in Arabesque.\n\nThe popularity of \"Orientalizing\" interior furnishings accelerated the domestic use of designs meticulously recorded by Jones and others. A large length of silk furnishing fabric inspired by Alhambra, on loan to the exhibition from the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, demonstrates the adaptation of such patterns for the domestic sphere, far removed from their historical and architectural context.\n\nPortable objects, such as mosque lamps, became collectible items for European home interiors in the late nineteenth century, coveted for their distinctive shape, ornate inscriptions, and decorative enameling and gilding. Philippe-Joseph Brocard (French, 1831-1896) began collecting these lamps as an antiques restorer in Paris and eventually learned the techniques to fabricate his own. A c.1880 example from the Clark's collection, modeled on an example from medieval Cairo, provides context to help visitors understand the widespread appeal of these exquisite lamps.\n\nArt Nouveau furniture designer Carlo Bugatti (Italian, 1856-1940) developed an eclectic signature style using an unusual variety of natural materials. Both his architectural training and his fascination with Islamic art are evident in a table on loan from the Art Institute of Chicago, which incorporates Moorish arches and Arab calligraphy, among other decorative elements.\n\nArabesque as Design Principle\n\nSome of the most productive and innovative European uses of arabesque in the nineteenth century occurred when artists laid aside preconceived notions about prior models and instead let the sheer energy of the arabesque line lead where it would. That approach yielded eccentric and extraordinary results like Aubrey Beardsley's (English, 1872-1898) illustrations for Oscar Wilde's Salome, of which three will be presented in Arabesque. Beardsley's highly original style and exquisite linework, influenced by Japanese prints and heralding Art Nouveau, attained a level of decorative refinement rarely seen before or since.\n\nThe sinuous, calligraphic lines of Tiger in the Jungle (1893) also evokes Japanese prints and Asian ink drawings, two profound influences on the Nabi artist Paul Ranson (French, 1861-1909). The simplicity of black ink on yellow-printed paper belies the great elegance and sophistication of Ranson's line, which shuns volume and perspective to present the muscular tiger as a flat, purely decorative motif.\n\nExperiments with all-over arabesque by the Nabi artists culminated in the high-spirited poster designs of Alphonse Mucha (Czech, 1860-1939) and Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec (French, 1864-1901).\n\nImage courtesy Clark Art Institute\n\nMucha's depictions of women could, through today's lens, be seen as generically beautiful and sensual, but upon closer examination the \"Mucha woman\" is not a single stereotype. In Zodiaque (\"La Plume\") (1896-97) she is angelic and virginal, in the guise of a Renaissance portrait. In Biscuits Lefèvre-Utile (1896) she is hearty and rustic. In both images, Mucha ingeniously blends the woman's looping and swirling hair with an abstract border pattern.\n\nIn contrast to Mucha's portrayal of fantasy abstractions, Toulouse-Lautrec portrayed well-known figures who were also his close friends, such as Jane Avril. Arabesque includes two works depicting the famous can-can dancer: Jane Avril (1899) from the Clark's collection and Divan Japonais (1893) from the Smart Museum of Art, University of Chicago. In the former, the subject herself embodies the arabesque form, her body twisting like the brightly colored snake on her black dress. In Divan Japonais, Avril is depicted seated rather than performing. The elegance of her upright form harmonizes with the arabesque shapes surrounding her: the curved back of her chair, her companion's hat and cane, the scrolls of the double basses in the pit orchestra, the hands of the conductor, and the performer onstage.\n\nImage courtesy Clark Art Institute\n\nThe idea of all-over arabesque is echoed in Henri Matisse's (French, 1869-1954) painting titled Pianist and Checker Players (1924). From the Oriental carpet on the floor to the wallpaper with its Moorish architectural echoes, there seems no end to the exuberant play of arabesque pattern and texture across the composition. The checkers game, an emblem of rule-bound order, holds sway at the center of this profusely ornamental yet harmoniously structured picture.\n\nTwo years before Matisse painted Pianist and Checker Players, the Ottoman Empire fell, confirming many Europeans' sense that the certainties of the old order had been destroyed. Hope of an all-encompassing harmony, decorative plenitude, or belief in a spiritual unity holding together the cosmos seemed to echo incoherently from another age. In such a climate of disillusionment, arabesque lost some of its relevance, though artists did not entirely abandon it: artists such as Pablo Picasso and Max Ernst made use of the device in their work. But because of arabesque's shape-shifting character, the variations on it may continue without end. As a symbol of imaginative freedom, it remains unrivaled.\n\nImage by Bridgeman Images/courtesy Clark Art Institu\n\n↧\n\nMURALISM…. IDENTITY AND REVOLUTION\n\nThrockmorton Fine Art has on view a special show of Mexican murals and photographs dating to the Mexican Revolution, from 1910-1920. MURALISM…. IDENTITY AND REVOLUTION will be on view at Throckmorton Fine Art in New York through February 29, 2020.\n\nIn a revolt against dictator Porfirio Diaz, the demand for agrarian reform signaled a new age in Mexican society. As Civil War raged in Mexico from 1910-1920, the people of Mexico expressed their belief that the land should be in the hands of the laborers who worked the land. The Mexican people also cried out for universal public education and health care, as well as broader civil liberties.\n\nAt the end of the Revolution, the government commissioned artists to create art that helped to educate the mostly illiterate masses about Mexican history. The plan was to spark the Mexican people to craft the nation’s history in a way that helped define Mexican identity after the Revolution.\n\nThe images featured non-European heroes from Mexico’s illustrious past, present and future – Aztec warriors battling the Spanish, humble peasants fighting in the Revolution, common laborers of Mexico City, and the mixed-race people rising to dominate the next decades.\n\nThe Mexican Revolution marked a true break from the past, launching a more egalitarian age on a grand scale. The muralists reoriented history, uncovered lost stories and created a new narrative that can still be seen publicly in Mexico and beyond.\n\nSpencer Throckmorton says, “Three artists are especially well known known for the way they expressed themselves through murals. Known as Los Tres Grandes they include David Alfaro Siqueiros, Diego Rivera and Jose Clemente Orozco. While murals are generally defined as any piece of artwork painted or applied directly on a wall, ceiling or other large permanent structure, mural painting characteristically includes architectural elements of the given space incorporated into the picture.\n\n“We are fortunate to have on view a collection of more than a dozen photographs by Tina Modotti of important murals created by Diego Rivera. He is well known for his murals of Mexican workers, miners and laborers created during the 1920s and 1930s,\" he says. \"Among highlights are murals from the Ministry of Education and National Palace including Revolutionary Workers, Peasants and Soldiers Laughing (1928) and the Festival of the Flowers. A photograph from World Wide Photo dating to 1933 depicts the mural Rivera created for the Detroit Institute of Art.\n\n\"\n\nThe Throckmorton MURALISM show includes photographs of Diego Rivera by Bernard Silberstein, Edward Weston’s “Tina Reciting,” Guillermo Zamora’s 1946 portrait of David Alfaro Siqueiros, Manuel Alvarez Bravo’s 1928-29 “Pair of Legs,” and his 1931 “Optic Parable.”\n\nOther highlights of the show also include Hector Garcia’s 1945 portrait of Jose Clemente Orozco and a 1940 photograph by Garcia of Diego Rivera,\n\nFlorence Aguin’s 1951 portrait of Frida Kahlo, Lucienne Bloch’s 1933 photo of “Frida in Front of Unity Panel,” Lola Alvarez Bravo’s 1942 “Judas,” Manuel Alvarez Bravo’s 1930s “Horse in Display Window” and Tina Modotti’s 1927 “Sickle, Bandolier and Guitar.”\n\n↧\n\nPure Drawing: Seven Centuries of Art from the Gray Collection\n\nArt Institute of Chicago,\n\nJanuary 25 to May 10, 2020\n\nHighlighting one of the most important gifts in the history of the Prints and Drawings department, Pure Drawing: Seven Centuries of Art from the Gray Collection brings together more than 100 works from celebrated art dealer Richard Gray and art historian Mary L. Gray. Assembled over nearly 50 years, the Gray Collection encapsulates a long and distinguished history of artmaking dedicated to the medium of drawing. From January 25 to May 10, 2020, Pure Drawing documents that endeavor, showcasing one of the most immediate, exploratory, and intimate of art forms.\n\nProminent Chicago gallery owner Richard Gray and his wife Mary L. Gray were longtime benefactors and supporters of the city’s cultural institutions. Motivated by their deep sense of civic responsibility and longstanding relationship with the Art Institute of Chicago, they have given 91 works from the collection to the museum. The exhibition Pure Drawing celebrates their extraordinary legacy. With a deep and sustained interest in the variety of ways artists put pen or pencil to paper, the Grays built a collection that is exceptional in both quality and breadth. Focused on key periods and places—fifteenth to eighteenth-century Italy; seventeenth to twentieth-century France; seventeenth-century Holland; and twentieth and twenty-first century America—they sought out works defined by excellence and boldness of execution. The most celebrated names appear throughout: Peter Paul Rubens, François Boucher, Giovanni Battista Tiepolo, Canaletto, Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres, Paul Cézanne, Edgar Degas, Vincent van Gogh, Georges Seurat, Henri Matisse, Pablo Picasso, Willem de Kooning, and Jackson Pollock.\n\nExtending from Renaissance drawings to works of art brut and beyond, Pure Drawing encompasses the richness of drawing techniques and media in the Western tradition, from black and red chalk, graphite, conté crayon, wash, and pastels to charcoal, watercolor, collage, and pen and ink. Although landscapes, still lifes, and the occasional abstraction are to be found in their collection, the Grays gave prominence to one of the great subjects in Western art: the human figure.\n\nA few examples give a sense of the scope of the exhibition. Tiepolo’s masterly red-and-white chalk drawing on Venetian blue laid paper, The Head of a Young Man in Profile to the Left (1749/50), (above) conveys an immediacy of expression and empathetic rapport that suggest drawing from life.\n\nJacques-Louis David’s Nude Soldiers Gesticulating with Their Weapons (1796/97) is a powerfully executed preparatory work for his iconic painting\n\nThe Intervention of the Sabine Women (1799).\n\nEdgar Degas’s Study for a Portrait of Monsieur and Madame Louis Rouart (1904) evidences the artist’s relentless experimentation with the medium of pastel.\n\nPicasso’s Man with a Clarinet (1911) represents the consummation of Analytical Cubism, pulling apart and reassembling the figure in order to capture its totality.\n\nBoucher’s “Study of a Draped Woman Leaning on a Pedestal” (1759-61), white and black chalk. “It almost feels like an abstraction,” Salatino says. “It’s all about the drapery and less about the figure. He gets completely consumed in the massiveness of this cascading drapery. It’s one of the great French drawings of the 18th century.”\n\nAuguste Rodin’s “Nude Woman Standing, Seen from the Back with Her Hands on Her Hips” (1898-1900), graphite with stumping, watercolor and pen and black ink with a light blue wash. “We had no good Rodin watercolors, and this is a truly great one,” Salatino says. Fake Rodin drawings were prevalent in the early 20th century, when the artist was hugely popular. Bbut this one has been verified as authentic. “And the other issue you have to be concerned about is condition because they are often quite faded,” according to Salatino. “And this one is not.”\n\nWassily Kandinsky’s “Untitled” (ca. 1915), watercolor. This colorful, semi-abstract work was created during an unsettled time in the artist’s life, shortly before the Russian Revolution. “We had no great Kandinsky from this most important moment,” Salatino says. “This was a great favorite of our director, James Rondeau.”\n\nPicasso’s “The Artist and Model” (July 24, 1933), watercolor and pen and black ink. This is part of what McCullagh calls an “incredible string” of Picasso drawings in the collection. The work was consigned twice to the Gray Gallery, according to partner Paul Gray, and his father “couldn’t pass it up” the second time. “It’s one of the best subjects of the artist from one of the most renowned periods of his career,” he says.\n\nShowcasing one of the finest private collections of its kind, Pure Drawing traverses 700 years of artists’ myriad attempts to understand, reflect, and interpret the world through drawing.\n\n↧\n\nIn the Picture - Van Gogh Self-portraits\n\nVan Gogh Museum, Amsterdam\n\n21 February - 24 May 2020\n\nPeople throughout the world recognize Vincent van Gogh - the man with the red beard and intense expression. Our image of the artist has been primarily shaped by his self-portraits.\n\nIn the 19th century painters made self portraits to practice, experiment, or to set out their identity. They also made portraits of one other, often as a token of friendship.\n\nThe spring exhibition In the Picture tells stories about identity and image, in 75 portraits.\n\nThe self-portraits of Vincent van Gogh are the thread running through this exhibition.\n\nVan Gogh paints his famous Self-portrait with Bandaged Ear in 1889. In this work, Vincent portrays himself as being both vulnerable and strong. Things were difficult, yet he continued to paint.\n\nGet an overview of artworks used in the exhibition's communication\n\nImage and identity\n\nIn the Picture shows that a portrait says more than you may initially think. Is it about a good resemblance, expressing the inner self or rather about defining an image? Like people nowadays carefully think about how they present themselves, for example when taking seflies, so did the 19th century painters. What do we show of ourselves? What not? Such considerations are of all times.\n\nMajor names and new faces\n\nThe exhibition features an outstanding selection of works by major names and new faces. The portraits of Vincent van Gogh are united with artists’ portraits (1850-1920) by painters including Berthe Morisot, Gustave Courbet, Paul Cézanne, Edvard Munch and Helene Schjerfbeck.\n\nIn addition, modern and contemporary artists inspired by Van Gogh, such as Francis Bacon and Guillaume Bruère respond to his self-portraits.\n\n“The portrait. That’s something old,\n\none might say – but it’s also brand new.”\n\nVincent van Gogh\n\n5-6 September 1889\n\n(read the full letter)\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nCaravaggio-Bernini. Baroque in Rome\n\nIn the first decades of the 17th century a new generation of ambitious artists led by the brilliant painter Caravaggio and sculptor Bernini shook the eternal city of Rome from its slumber. They introduced a new language to art that dispensed with elegance and incited the emotions. This was Baroque, a spectacular artistic style charged with drama, dynamism and bravura, which sparked intimate collaborations between painting, sculpture and architecture. This was a revolution in Western art, one that started in Rome and resonated throughout Europe.\n\nCaravaggio-Bernini. Baroque in Rome is an exhibition of more than 70 masterpieces by Caravaggio, Bernini and their contemporaries. The paintings and sculptures are on loan to the Rijksmuseum from museums and private collections around the world.\n\nBarok in Rome\n\nThis joyous Italian counterpart to the reserved and austere Protestant Dutch culture of the 17th was overlooked in the Netherlands. Elsewhere, however, it sparked an artistic revolution, and its impact was felt throughout Catholic Europe. The leading lights of Baroque in Rome were Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio (1571-1610) and the sculptor Gian Lorenzo Bernini (1598-1680), two geniuses around whom many other talented artists flocked. The arts in Rome were booming in the first decades of the 17th century, and in the space of just a few years the eternal city was transformed into an international pressure cooker bursting with new artistic ideas and initiatives. This vibrant climate formed the ideal conditions for the birth of a new style, one that would be only be named ‘Baroque’ much later – from the Portuguese barocco, for the irregular form of a natural pearl. More than ever before, painters teamed up with sculptors, and the central figures in this exhibition – Caravaggio, Bernini and their kindred spirits – embody this artistic fraternalism. Together, their works tell a story of immense artistic vigour in Rome and radical renewal in the arts in the approximate period from 1600 to 1640. The exhibition will be guided by key terms in the artistic vocabulary of the time, such as wonderment (meraviglia), vivacity (vivezza), motion (moto), jest (scherzo) and horror (terribilità).\n\nCaravaggio and Bernini\n\nBaroque began in Rome in the moment around 1600 when Caravaggio was causing a sensation with powerful chiaroscuro paintings imbued with an utterly innovative and intense naturalism. His radical art started a movement with many followers – they would later come to be known as Caravaggisti – including Italian artists such as father and daughter Gentileschi, Borgianni, Bartolomeo Manfredi, Guercino, Baglione and Mattia Preti, as well as the Dutch artsist Ter Brugghen and Honthorst van Van Baburen, for example. Just a few years after Caravaggio’s death in 1610, the multitalented sculptor Bernini came to the fore with a series of impressive and technically virtuoso sculptures that evoke drama, natural vitality and motion. In the decades that followed, Bernini’s sculptural work gave new impetus to Caravaggio’s legacy, one that radically altered the face of Rome. The sculptor’s innovations are felt to this day in any number of artistic terrains, including lifelike portraits, grand mausoleums, sculpted fountains and church architecture.\n\nHighlights\n\nThe exhibition highlights are Caravaggio’s mesmerising Narcissus, his Boy Bitten by a Lizard and The Crowning with Thorns, and Bernini sculptures such as the rarely exhibited early work Bacchus, his poignant Saint Sebastian, the bust of Medusa, as well as striking marble portraits of Thomas Baker and Cardinal Richelieu, and a painting titled Self-Portrait. Other paintings in the exhibition are by Ludovico and Annibale Carraci, Guido Reni, Giovanni Baglione, the Gentileschis, Nicolas Poussin, Simon Vouet, and the eccentric artist Tanzio da Varallo.\n\nOther sculptures include works by Alessandro Algardi such as his black marble Sonno (Sleep), the dancing Rondinini Faun by the Flemish-Roman sculptor François du Quesnoy, and Francesco Mochi’s never-before-seen bronze horse at full trot.\n\nPartnership\n\nThe exhibition came about in close collaboration with the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna, where it ran from 15 October 2019 to 19 January 2020.\n\nBook\n\nA richly illustrated catalogue is being published in Dutch and English editions to accompany the exhibition, titled Caravaggio-Bernini.

Working in pencil, watercolor, egg tempera and his much-beloved personal medium of drybrush, Wyeth, throughout his life, was a resolute champion of the universal life force of each person he chose to paint, and of the unique, difficult, ever-changing rural American world in which he chose to live. His art was controversial as it was popular, and he remains one of very few living artists to be celebrated by important single-person exhibitions at The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York (1976) and the National Gallery of Art, Washington, DC (1987). Andrew Wyeth’s 1966-67 exhibition, at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Art in Philadelphia, the Art Institute of Chicago and New York’s Whitney Museum of American Art, was one of the best-attended museum exhibitions in history.\n\nThe young Andrew Wyeth grew up in a prominent artistic family. His father, Newell Conyers Wyeth, was an important illustrator and realist painter and a strong, early influence on his fifth child, Andrew. The family lived in Chadds Ford, Pennsylvania (population 3600), in Delaware County about 25 miles southwest of Philadelphia and summered in Cushing, Maine in the rural midcoast area. Andrew, who began by emulating his father, making illustrations, soon eschewed illustration and instead chose the people and familiar landscape of his surroundings as the subjects that would endure throughout his life.\n\nBeginning in about 1940, Andrew Wyeth portrayed his closest neighbors. His iconic Christina’s World, painted at the Olson farm in Maine, depicts Christina Olson, disabled from the waist down, whom Wyeth had seen dragging herself across a Maine field.\n\nChristina’s World (1948), purchased by the Museum of Modern Art, New York, for $1,800., brought Andrew Wyeth to great prominence which continues to this day. But perhaps his most characteristic works of this period and through about 1970 are landscapes that imply personal struggle and depict quintessential American beauty.\n\nFirewood (Study for Groundhog Day) (1959), Riverboat (1963),\n\nand Maine Door (1970), all in the Forum Gallery exhibition, are examples.\n\nAlthough Andrew Wyeth had begun to paint provocative female nude subjects in 1945, it was in the early 1970’s that he began an extraordinary, 15-year, artist/model relationship with his Pennsylvania neighbor, Helga Testorf that resulted in more than 240 works, nearly all completed in secrecy and not shown or exhibited until 1986.\n\nTwo of these works,\n\nLetting Her Hair Down (1972)\n\nand In the Orchard (1974)\n\nare in the Forum Gallery exhibition. The Helga paintings were controversial for many reasons, but may well be the most insightful, sensitive and beautiful figurative works Andrew Wyeth completed.\n\nIn the 1980’s, Andrew Wyeth produced fully mature and developed landscapes and figure paintings, and the Forum Gallery exhibition includes Anchor Man (1983), The Blonde Study (1985) and Housebound Study (1986).\n\nIn the 1990’s, his involvement with his chosen models at an end, Andrew Wyeth returned to his neighboring landscapes as his subjects, imbuing each work with a personal and poetic vision, inspiring the viewer to provide a narrative, an identification with the focus the Artist brought. In Jimmy’s Porch (1991), East Point Lighthouse (1991) and Pickup Sticks (1994), all included in the Forum exhibition, Andrew Wyeth again showed why his unique and highly personal art transcended realism and Americana while incorporating both, and became one of the most celebrated artists of the Century.\n\n↧\n\nCézanne: The Rock and Quarry Paintings\n\nPrinceton University Art Museum (March 7-June 14, 2020)\n\nRoyal Academy of Arts, London (July 8-Oct. 8, 2020)\n\nFrom the mid-1860s until shortly before his death in 1906, Paul Cézanne created some 27 canvases that take rocks as their principal subjects. Among the artist’s most extraordinary landscapes, his paintings of rock formations have never been the exclusive subject of an exhibition or publication.\n\nFeaturing some 15 of the most important works – including scenes of the rocky terrain of the forest of Fontainebleau, the Mediterranean coastal village of L’Estaque and the area around Aix-en-Provence – this exhibition will explore the character and development of these works, the Romantic or picturesque fascination with the unusual or inhospitable landscape, and the close relationship of this motif to the artist’s numerous paintings of Mont Sainte-Victoire, both shaping and shaped by the radical changes that he made in his art over the final decade of his life.\n\nCézanne: The Rock and Quarry Paintings will also feature selected watercolors and related documentary material. Together, they reveal the artist’s fascination with geology, which began when he was a schoolboy in Aix-en-Provence and ultimately helped shape the radical innovations of his artistic practice.\n\nOrganized by the Princeton University Art Museum, Cézanne: The Rock and Quarry Paintings will be on view in Princeton from March 7-June 14, 2020, before traveling to the Royal Academy of Arts, London, from July 8-Oct. 18, 2020. The exhibition will include significant loans from museums and private collections in the U.S. and abroad, including the Musée d’Orsay, Paris; the National Gallery, London; the Kuntshaus Zürich; the Museum of Modern Art, New York; the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York; and the Baltimore Museum of Art.\n\n0\n\nThe exhibition is curated by John Elderfield, an independent Cézanne scholar who was until recently the Allen R. Adler, Class of 1967, distinguished curator and lecturer at the Princeton University Art Museum, and is chief curator emeritus of painting and sculpture at the Museum of Modern Art.\n\nAs a young artist in the mid-1860s, Cézanne found that rock formations were ideal subjects for his innovative use of thick paint applied directly to the canvas with a palette knife. In the late 1870s and early 1880s, as he painted in the Mediterranean coastal village of L’Estaque, such themes aided his return to sculptural subjects after he had absorbed the lessons of Impressionism. Finally, from the mid-1890s to almost the end of his life, he sought secluded places in which to paint, finding them both in rocky terrain deep in the forest of Fontainebleau and at two sites close to his home in Aix-en-Provence – within the abandoned Roman Bibémus Quarry and high up in the estate of a local manor house known as the Château Noir.\n\nCézanne: The Rock and Quarry Paintings will present a selection of works from the mid-1860s to early in the 20th century that reflect the artist’s interest in increasingly close-up depictions of rock formations, their geological structures shaping the compositions of the canvases. Cézanne was certainly conscious of the long history of European artists painting rocks and forests in the studio, but he avoided the often fantastic or picturesque aspects of such works, painting his canvases outdoors. As such, he learned from the plein-air practices of 19th-century artists, including the Impressionists’ personal responses to the shifting patterns of light on outdoor scenes. However, Cézanne’s unpopulated paintings reflect a more distanced, formalized view of nature as having its own, ancient order, an order that he recreated in conspicuously assembled, flat patches of colored paint. While abstraction was not his own aim, his innovations were deeply influential on early 20th-century artistic developments that moved in that direction, with both Henri Matisse and Pablo Picasso reportedly having said, “Cézanne is the father of us all.”\n\nA fully illustrated catalogue will accompany the exhibition, featuring a major essay by Elderfield; an essay on the geological context of the work by Faya Causey and introductions to the sites at which Cézanne painted by Anna Swinbourne, both independent scholars; and catalogue entries on the works in the exhibition by Sara B. Green, Annamarie Iker and Ariel Kline, graduate students in the Department of Art and Archaeology at Princeton University. The catalogue will be published by the Princeton University Art Museum and distributed by Yale University Press.\n\n↧\n\n*Frida Kahlo: Appearances Can Be Deceiving\n\nde Young museum\n\nMarch 21 - July 26, 2020\n\nNickolas Muray, \"Frida with Olmeca Figurine, Coyoacán\", 1939.\n\n\"The gringas really like me a lot and take notice of all the dresses and rebozos that I brought with me, their jaws drop at the sight of my jade necklaces and all the painters want me to pose for them.” — Frida Kahlo, letter to her parents while visiting San Francisco, 1930\n\nIn 1930, Frida Kahlo first visited the United States, traveling to San Francisco with her husband, Diego Rivera. Ninety years later she returns to the de Young museum in the exhibition, Frida Kahlo: Appearances Can Be Deceiving. Offering an intimate perspective on the iconic artist and examining how politics, gender, trauma, sexuality, and national identity influenced Kahlo’s diverse modes of creativity, the exhibition showcases a trove of the artist’s personal items from the Frida Kahlo Museum in Mexico City, including photographs, clothing, jewelry and hand-painted orthopedic corsets, alongside about twenty of Kahlo’s paintings and drawings.\n\nToday, Kahlo is known for her unique personal style as much as for her extraordinary art practice. A celebrity during her life, now elevated to icon status, her image is instantly recognizable and widely reproduced. Memorialized in arresting self-portraits and myriad photographs, her image is as much an expression of her creativity as her paintings are. Both her art and style reflect her deeply held personal beliefs, which led to the creation of a magnetic and enduring icon.\n\nKahlo had a special bond with San Francisco and the city greatly impacted her art. Her encounters with “Gringolandia” (as she called the United States) were formative and complex, and it was during these visits that Kahlo began to fashion her indigenous Mexican identity both in her self-portraits and in her iconic style. While in San Francisco, she painted a double portrait of herself and Rivera, which was the first time she depicted herself in what would become her iconic Tehuana-inspired dress, marking the beginning of her self-constructed persona.\n\n“Kahlo used her appearance to express her Mexicanidad, her identity as a Mexican woman at a time when her country was undergoing great political and social change,” explains Hillary Olcott, Associate Curator of the Arts of Africa, Oceania, and the Americas. “This became especially important when she left Mexico, and traveled to San Francisco for the first time. She created the double portrait here in the city, which is also where it was first shown outside of Mexico.”\n\nThe exhibition also reveals how Kahlo used her dress and other creative enterprises as outlets to cover but also to contend with the physical and emotional traumas that shaped her life. Many of these personal items came to light in 2004 after decades of being sealed off in her lifelong home, La Casa Azul (now Museo Frida Kahlo) in Mexico City.\n\nThis critically acclaimed exhibition originated at the Frida Kahlo Museum in Mexico City in 2012. The presentation at the de Young features paintings loaned from American museums and private collectors, highlighting relationships Kahlo established in San Francisco.
