        "text": "Introduction\n\nIn this part we will explore the 18th and 19th century philosophical movements known as the Enlightenment and Romanticism, which were characterized by themes of reason and passion, respectively.\n\nFrom the Handbook\n\nFrom Neo-Classicism to Impressionism\n\nEnlightenment culture was a European movement largely confined to the noble and professional classes. It was associated with a condemnation of despotism, criticism and distrust of the established church and a greater respect of the classical past.\n\nHowever, prior to the Revolution in France, the 18th century was dominated by the decorative rococo style, portraying hedonistic delights. There was also a greater orient influence giving rise to the use of porcelain, lacquered furniture and wallpaper. In trade, the consumption of sugar, cotton, tea and coffee enhanced the European economy. The decorative rococo style also flourished internationally, and can been seen in the churches of Johann Michael Fisher and Dominikus Zimmermann. It was also visible in the palaces off Sans-Souci and Charlottenburg.\n\nCharlottenburg Palace, Berlin, Germany, decorative rococo style used in the dance-music room\n\nFischer, Johann Michael: St. Michael’s Church, 1692\n\nBy the middle of the century this preoccupation with taste, fashion and sensibility was beginning to give way to the emphasis on reason that characterised the Enlightenment. There was a new seriousness that appeared in the writings of the French philosophes responsible for the Encyclopédie. One of the most prolific critics was Denis Diderot who favored the sober and moralising works of Chardin and Greuze. There was a growing interest in the increasingly well-educated public and in the power of images to convey ideas. Contemporary incidents were elevated to history status, using the ideals of classicism and democratic ideals.\n\nNapoleon had a great impact on the establishment of Neo-classism in France as he harnessed the spirit of classicism and employed art and architecture to help bolster his right to rule. His ambition for Paris was to emulate ancient Rome; the Arc de Triomphe, the triumphal ways, the Egyptian obelisk on the Place de la Concorde and the Vendôme column all reflect this ambition.\n\nRomanticism to Realism\n\nThe impulse to modernity was expressed in the nineteenth century in three main ways: through Romanticism, the realism of Courbet and the work of the Impressionists. With this we see a departure from the optimism and rationalism of the Enlightenment movement as Romantic artist were often defined by subjectivity, pessimism and self-alienation. Around Europe these was a new demand for political freedom, which were portrayed in works like Emanuel Gottlieb Leutze’s Westward the Course of Empire Takes its Way (Westward Ho!), and Thomas Cole’s The Course of Empire.\n\nThe mural was painted by Emanuel Gottlieb Leutze in 1861 and symbolizes Manifest Destiny, the belief that the United States was destined for Western exploration and expansion originating from the initial colonies along the Atlantic seaboard to the Pacific Ocean.\n\nA five-part series of paintings created by Thomas Cole in the years 1833–36. It reflects popular American sentiments of the times, when many saw pastoralism as the ideal phase of human civilization, fearing that empire would lead to gluttony and inevitable decay.\n\nMeanwhile the Impressionists’ approach was to observe and record what they saw. They took everyday themes as their subject matter and challenged academic standards through their apparent lack of finish and their use of colours in ways which reflected the studies of theorists such as Chevreul.\n\nHowever, many aspects of Impressionism, including their use of light and colour, had their precedents in Rubens or Delacroix. Nor did the advent of Impressionism mean an end to the representation of contemporary historical events. Like Manet’s The Execution of the Emperor Maximilian.\n\nThe Execution of the Emperor Maximilian, Manet, 1867 to 1869\n\nThe impact of the industrial revolution\n\nThe industrial revolution was another great impact on the 19th century. Its influence on art can be seen in pieces like Loutherbourg’s Coalbrookdale by Night and Adolph Menzel’s Rolling Mills of 1875. The development of photography, like mass-produced ceramics, was typical of the mechanical processes that accompanied rapid urbanisation and the factory system. Writers such as Foucault have argued that its early use in prisons and workhouses was emblematic of the growing power of the state and of its tendency to classify those that did not conform to the demands of factory labour. One of its consequences was to encourage artists to abandon the pursuit of illusion in favour of works in which sketchiness and spontaneity predominated.\n\nThe Crystal Palace was a cast-iron and plate-glass structure originally built in Hyde Park, London, to house the Great Exhibition of 1851\n\nThe manufacturing processes associated with the industrial revolution also led to the creation of prefabricated buildings, like the Crystal Palace.\n\nThe social problems caused by the industrial revolution further exacerbated the growth of nationalist, socialist and anarchist movements and the demand for political reform.\n\nImperialist adventures\n\nAnother aspect of the response by governments to the tensions of the century was the involvement of Britain, France, Russia, Germany and Italy in imperial adventures in Africa and Asia. From as early as Napoleon’s campaign in Egypt, Africa had fascinated artists, as can be seen in works such as Antoine-Jean Gros’s Napoleon in the Plague House at Jaffa (1804) and Marie Guillemine Benoist’s Portrait of a Black Woman (1800).\n\nNapoleon in the Plague House at Jaffa, Antoine-Jean Gros, 1804\n\nPortrait of a Black Woman, Marie Guillemine Benoist, 1800\n\nImpressionism to Post-Impressionism\n\nAfter Germany defeated France in 1871 there was an economic depression that affected Europe. Economic tensions fuelled fin-de-siècle anxieties and unease about the disorientating effects of urban life which can be seen in such works like Manet’s A Bar at the Folies-Bergère, 1881.\n\nA Bar at the Folies-Bergère, Manet, 1881\n\nOlympia, Manet, 1863\n\nIt was also during this time that female nudes were painted in a less allegorical manner and more provocatively, by artists like Degas, Gauguin, Toulouse-Lautrec, Klimt, Schiele and Sickert. The most controversial female nude of all was Manet’s Olympia.\n\nImpressionism itself can be seen either as the logical conclusion of the scientific positivism of the earlier century or as a retreat into individualism and self-expression. On the one hand, it’s symptomatic of the artists’ interest in the colour theories of Chevreul, James Clerk Maxwell and Charles Blanc and the optical and psychological researches of thinkers such as Charles Henry. On the other, it can be interpreted as the pursuit of what Baudelaire called ‘the transitory, the fleeting, the contingent’.\n\nBy 1880 many artists seemed to have grown tired of what the Symbolist poet Gustave Kahn called ‘the everyday, near-at-hand and the contemporaneous’. A desire to express the unsettling nature of the modern world can be seen in works such as Munch’s The Scream or Gauguin’s Spirit of the Dead Watching and van Gogh’s The Night Café. At the same time, other Post-Impressionist artists such as Seurat were seeking to replace the transitory and intuitive nature of Impressionism with a more programmatic approach. Their works emphasised the unity of the picture surface and privileged the decorative rather than the descriptive qualities of their work.\n\nSpirit of the Dead Watching, Gauguin, 1892\n\nThe Bathers, Seurat, 1884\n\nWHA Chapter Fourteen: Enlightenment and Liberty\n\nThere were many power struggles during the 18th century, most notably the ascendancy of France in Europe and the marshalling of the Prussian people into a future German state. The monarch of France, Louis XIV, played a great role in the Spanish Succession, Austrian Succession, the Seven Years War and the French Revolution. The true beneficiary of these conflicts was Great Britain, as England and Scotland formed the new united kingdom. The British then went on to take Quebec in North America and Canada. The British conflict between the French in America is what lead to a rebellion and ultimately lead to the colonies of the United states.\n\nChristianity continued to have a hold in the 18th century with an increased concentration on devotion and piety. Secular pieces also continued to gain ground, as philosophers and thinkers question Christianity. The beginning of industrialization opened up new possibilities and the need for better conditions for workers. Much of 18th century art reflected the two main characteristics that defined the 18th century, continued absolutism and Enlightenment (Reason). There was also a great awareness of the past which lead to a renewed sense of Christian spirituality. Excavations of Pompeii and Herculaneum also revived a taste for antiquity in the arts. (Adams, 2012)\n\nAbsolutism\n\nThe political practice of absolute power, usually taking the form of a monarchy or dictatorship. One ruler had supreme authority and was not restricted by written laws, legislature, or customs. Much of their rule was justified by the “the divine right of kings” theory, which meant that their authority was divinely ordained by God. Though many argued that this type of centralized decision making was best, it often lead to unchecked and tyrannical rule. For example Loius XIV, Frederic the Great and Catherine the Great.\n\nEnlightenment\n\nThis movement stemmed from those who were skeptical and questioned Christian teaching and ideology and their notions of absolute rule. These thinkers and philosophers based their ideals on observation, logic, science and the power of the human mind. \"The goals of rational humanity were considered to be knowledge, freedom, and happiness\" (Britannica, 2017). Some of the key figures include, John Locke, Isaac Newton and Immanuel Kant.\n\nImmanuel Kant\n\nA German philosopher concerned with knowledge, ethics and aesthetics. He was a great contributor to the Enlightenment movement through his philosophies about idealism, rationalism and empiricism. He had a great influence on all philosophy since, as many studied and wrote about his works, known as Katianism.\n\nThe Age of Rococo\n\nThis highly decorative style formed in extension to Baroque. It arose form the French court and reflect the continued separation of the courts and the people. It is a highly criticized movement in the arts and often viewed as a frivolous attempt for the upper class to fulfill their whims, however it can also be viewed as a form of escape, as artists reacted against academic rules and restrictions. It can be described as spontaneous, playful and decorative, following two major themes, 'nature and the pursuit of happiness' (Copplestone, 1983:258). \"Its genius lay in nuances, subtle juxtapositions of forms, gentle gradations and mingling of colours, the elusive dancing rhythms of only slightly differentiated motifs\" (WHA 609)\n\nIt started as an architectural movement where the wealthy French aristocrats started decorating their homes in a new Rococo style that was associated with King Louis XV. They focused particularly on the salon (living room) and transforming that into a central space for aristocracy, a place to entertain guests and engage in intellectual conversation. \"Rococo salons are characterized by their elaborate detail, intricate patterns, serpentine design work, asymmetry, and a predisposition to lighter, pastel, and gold-based color palettes\" (Lumen, 2017). These themes also influenced sculpture and painting, using serpentine lines, and highly ornamental details to convey themes of love, nature and playfulness.\n\nThe Princess' Salon is a prime example in the development of the rococo style. The oval shape had become popular as it was easier is it gave a sense of looseness. The tall arched windows allowed for great spills of light, reflecting of the painted woodwork and looking glasses. We see how the serpentine embellishments and rich textures combine to create an effect so grand, the viewer feels dwarfed by it. This room embodies the new genre pittoresque which means pictorial motifs. Popular motifs were shells, flowers, tendrils, leaves and scrolls. It represents lightness, elegance, gaiety and novelty (WHA). It is this curvilinear form and sensuality and whimsicality that inspired many painters of that time.\n\nFrench Rococo Artists\n\nJean Francois de Troy\n\nParticularly famed for creating scenes that represent the French aristocrats and their lifestyles, providing a more realistic take on their fashions, pastimes and manners.\n\nIn A Reading from Moliere the figures are stylishly and sensually posed in a large an opulent room. The rich textures of the decor and fabrics are playfully and brightly rendered through his combination of light and colour.\n\nIt highlights the popularity of 'Enlightended' salons where the wealthy not only share their intellect, but also their appreciation of life and fashion.\n\nA Reading from Molière, Jean François de Troy, 1728\n\nDenis Diderot\n\nDuring the age of Enlightenment, thinkers and philosophers encapsulated everything they deemed worth knowing in the great French Encyclopedia (1751). Diderot was a novelist, essayist and editor who contributed to the Encyclopedia. \"The Encyclopédie was to bring out the essential principles and applications of every art and science. The underlying philosophy was rationalism and a qualified faith in the progress of the human mind\" (Britannica: Niklaus, 2002)) He didn't comment much on the theory of art, but rather focusing on how and artwork made him feel. His judgements were based on his own high value of morals which often made his remarks on the works of others quite stern.\n\nThe Rococo influence in Great Britain\n\nIn Great Britain there was a more rational and moral approach to artistic matters. The scottish architect Colen Campbell advocated for the return to Classical principles and embarked on bringing good manners and prosperity back through his Neo-Palladian home designs. These homes declared the respect and propriety of the owner through its use of stonework, columns and pediment.\n\nClassicism\n\nThis also translated into landscape, with parks and formal gardens become a great contribution to visual art in the 18th century.\n\nThe design of these gardens resemble a sense of nostalgia but also the ability of man to dominate and control nature without being rigidly formal, like The Park at Stourhead.\n\nThe Death of General Wolfe, Benjamin West, 1770\n\nNeoclassicism\n\nThe terms Classicism and Neoclassicism are often used interchangeably. Though the later refers to works that were inspired by antiquity. During the mid 18th century there was a divide among artists; one the one hand those who wanted to revolt against restraint and pursue fantasy, beauty and the sublime, and those who sought antiquity, harmony and rational thinking. Artists who did not agree with the frivolous sensuality of Rococo art insisted on a return to order, promoting a more cerebral art. Pieces need to be moral, serious and rational, fitting better with the age of Enlightenment. \"Neoclassicsm is characterized by clarity of form, sober colors, shallow space, strong horizontal and verticals that render that subject matter timeless\" (Gersh-Nesic, 2014). The drivers of Enlightenment in England and France were proclaimed thinkers about human affairs, tradition and the common good like Hume, Voltaire and Roussou.\n\nIn France and America Neoclassical style represented a desire for democracy and the abollishment of monarchy. Thomas Jefferson was the driver of the American version of Neoclassical style referred to as Federal style. He himself was an architect and a collector of Classical Roman sculpture and we see these influences in his buildings, Monticello and Rotanda (Adams, 2012). Neoclassical architecture is defined by its sense of naturalism and its underlying assertion of order and authority. In France, early Classicism was linked to Louis XIV as an attempt to boost his prestige. It later became synonymous with Napoleon who wished to reflect his own imperial ambitions. He took the triumphal arch to new heights which influenced the Western arts.\n\nExercise: Research, draw or paint a classical portrait\n\nSir Joshua Reynolds\n\nDuring his time at the Royal Academy he delivered yearly Discourses in which he gave advise to new artists, often using many of his own thoughts and aspirations about art. Ironically he himself struggled to live up to his own theories in practice.In Discourse IV he writes about The General Idea.\n\nThe General Idea\n\nThis is a presiding principal that regulates every part of art. It regards leaving out particularities and retaining simply general ideas. The general ideas extend to all parts of art, including invention, Composition, Expression, Colouring and Drapery. And when employed together, they can be referred to as Grand Style. To attain it one should be well studied in the analysis of shat constitues dignity of appearance in real life.\n\nThe General Idea in Invention\n\nA proper subject is not invented but exists from writing or history, making them generally interesting to the public. The subject should be presented with a general air and without the fuss of minuteness and smaller details. The 'invention comes in how the artist portrays the subject grounded and with all parts equal to the whole. The artists also shouldn't get to caught up in representing the context of the subject, as this too should be left to the imagination of the spectator. The artist should deviate from strict historical truth and focus on the grandeur of his design.\n\nThe General Idea in Expression\n\nA figure's expression should be considered in perspective to their situation and to represent that generally and in a dignified manner, or it may be considered vulgar.\n\nThe General Idea in Colouring\n\nA quietness should reign over the canvas with no great variety of tint or displays of light. The colours should be kept uniformed and simple. Monotony allows for harmony.\n\nThe General Idea in Drapery\n\nAgain, the artist should not be overly concerned with the minute details of every fold or caught up in representing the texture of each varying fabric. The artist should be created naturally and with grace, with elegant folds that advantage the figure.\n\nThe above information was gathered from:\n\nThe Complete Works of Sir Joshua Reynolds, available here.\n\nReflection on General Idea\n\nIt is though Reynolds was creating a specific set of rules for what he believed to be tasteful. Taste in his opinion is something that is simplified and subdued. I think some of his ideas have merit and there is value in things being harmonious and not overly fussy, but it cannot apply to all things. For me, it also feels like his ideas are taking away my freedom to interpret and present art in my own way. On the one hand, I don think their should be principals and ideas, as that helps us to analyze art, but on the other, I also think that boundaries are meant to be crossed.\n\nPortrait Painting\n\nThroughout history portrait painting has had the primary role of memorializing famous or influential people, particularly during Greek and Roman times. These were of people with great influence or historical impact. This trend continued and then close to the end of the Middle Ages there was an emergence of private portraits commissioned by wealthy individuals. During the Renaissance and well into the 19th century, portraits remained a way of honoring historical figures and famous individuals, however, with the rise of wealth and status, more individuals sought portraits to show off their wealth. In the 18th and 19th centuries neo-classical artists in particular showed off the status and importance of their patrons by depicting them in fashionable clothes, with classical poses. Portraits can be done with different compositions, like, full length, half length, head only, front view, profile etc.\n\nDuring the Renaissance the rise in the status of artists and painting lead to the formation of Academies where artists could study and practice. Artists who studied at the academies were trained in the area of academic art, which is to represent a subject true-to-life but in a high minded manner. The French Academy of Fine art was well known and established school. They characterized academic art as follows:\n\nRationality\n\nFor paintings to represent intellect, the subject matter had to be well reasoned through use of classical reference and religious/ historical allegory. This involved careful planning, sketching or the use of wax models.\n\nMessage\n\nThe painting should have a high moral message. These could be of Christian values, humanistic behavior, ideals or eternal truths.\n\nIdealized\n\nArtist should use idealized rather than overly realistic forms. Thus working from classical sculpture was popular.\n\nHistorical\n\nPaintings of a historical nature should feature the accompanied historical dress\n\nPerspective\n\nThe rules of the Renaissance theories on perspective, foreshortening and the use of chiaroscuro must be applies.\n\nColours\n\nShould be represented in a naturalistic way with bright colours being used sparingly.\n\nSurface\n\nThe canvas surface should be smooth, with no lines or brush strokes visible.\n\nFor a long time the Academies dominated the art world, imposing their conventions and rules for art. Studies had to representational and the abstract was not allowed. Students spent years simply sketching figures form sculpture and learning anatomy and geometry. Only after many years of study, observation and sketching were they allowed to start painting.\n\nLady Elizabeth Compton, Joshua Reynolds, 1780-82\n\nPortrait of Madame Récamier, Jacques-Louis David, 1800\n\nComtesse d'Haussonville, Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres, 1845\n\nFrom the above neoclassical paintings of David, Reynolds, and Ingres we can certainly see the toned down colour palette, although Ingres has made use of sharper blues and reds in some areas. The poses have been kept graceful and classical, while the expressions are subdued. While these portraits surely represent class and taste, you can't help feeling that they lack personality and character.\n\nThe Academicians of the Royal Academy, Johan Zoffany, 1771-72\n\nJohan Zoffany\n\nHe was a German neoclassical painter who worked mostly in England and a founding member of the Royal Academy in 1768. He was a theatrical painter well known for his large scale portraits containing casts of people, like The Academicians of the Royal Academy.He depicts the life-drawing room where models are being set up in poses. The artists seem to be observing and contemplating and no one is drawing. This reflects the intellectual nature of art. The inclusion of sculptures and busts in the background give further notice to how artists would have been discussing and contemplating the Classics. In his painting Charles Townley And Friends In His Library, 1782, he once again displays the importance of studying classical sculpture.\n\nFrom the Sketchbook\n\nTo start my planning I actually first looked at the head shots of famous actors. I was trying to find one that has discernible features but also the correct angling.\n\nOnce I had chosen the image of Johnny Depp I looked for inspiration in other classical portraits of the 18th century. Men were mostly portrayed as stately, noble and stern, so I wanted to keep this tendency. I used a portrait by Jacques-Louis David as a model for the pose. I cropped the image to have greater focus on the face. I then worked on combining these in a sketch first straight on the canvas, to ensure I got the proportions and combinations correct.\n\nKeeping in mind Sir Joshua Reynolds teachings of the general idea, I chose to work with a lighter palette. I softened the hair and though I was meticulous in using shadow and light to create more defined features, I also allowed myself not to get too fussy with exact details. Like his facial hair or eyelashes for example. I believe that the pose and expression does a good job at representing the actor.\n\nI have tried to work with soft brush strokes in order for the canvas to remain smooth as the strokes should not be seen. Though I used a toned down palette, I think my colours probably still look to rich, if I compare it to some of the other portraits, this is likely because I worked with undiluted paint. If I had worked with more washes, I may have been better at creating the sort of softer dreamier edges that some of the other classical portraitists used.\n\nI quite enjoyed the task, even though it was challenging and required much focus. It is an interesting technique and I can appreciate that it does create a Grand feel. It does make the subject feel sophisticated and noble. However, it is restricting and doesn't allow for much creative spirit. The energy that can come from broader strokes or contrasting energy is missing. The combination of more exciting methods can give a painting the opportunity to not only show the sitter's character, but also that of the painter.\n\nExercise: Experiment with landscape painting in watercolours\n\nThe growing popularity of the genre in England saw the appearance of numerous books of instruction for the landscape painter, each with their own approach. In watercolour, accurate attention to effects and the means which produce them is\n\nvital; washes and opaque passages have their own qualities. Reflect on the properties of the medium that made it so popular for this type of work, both for artists and audiences.\n\nBackground\n\nWatercolour painting came to Western art during the 1400's, but were mostly used as preparatory sketches. During the 15th Century, German artist Albrecht Durer illustrated the power of watercolour in his graphic and accurate depiction of animals and landscapes. While in the 17th century Flemish artist Anthony van Dyck created wonderful depictions of biblical subjects, and mythological creatures. William Reeves' invention of soluble watercolour hard cakes further propelled this medium. During the 1800's, artists from the school of English Landscape Painting raised the status of watercolours paintings and became know as the Golden Age of Watercolour Landscapes. Artists like Girtin and Turner raised the bar for landscape painting. A new Romantic Style develped with their wide range of colours, free brush work and painterly effects and textured papers making this medium popular for audiences throughout the UK. Other advantages for artists was the ease of carrying it around for plein-air painting and its quick drying properties.\n\nWing of a Roller, Albrecht Durer, 1512\n\nA Meadow Surrounded by Trees, Anthony van Dyck, 1635\n\nAlexander Cozens\n\nDavid Cox\n\nT H Fielding\n\nTheodore Henry Adolphus Fielding was an English painter, author and engraver. He is well known for his work in watercolours and in particular his mastery of perspective. He was a teacher at the East India Company Military Seminary at Addiscombe and also published several books on the tools and techniques o painting..\n\nIn his book On painting in oil and water colours, for landscape and portraits (1839) he writes about the practice of painting with watercolours. Here are some of his thoughts:\n\n​\n\nThe advantage of watercolours is the clarity and light it provides when painting aerial perspective.\n\nA superior transparency, great fro creating depth in shadows.\n\nThe best way to preserve a watercolour painting is by framing it in glass with edges well secured.\n\nHe suggests using warmer colour firs as prepatory and then adding cooler colours for finer work, areas of light should first be left untouched.\n\nThe foreground colours should always be painted in more vibrant warm colours with depth of contrast compared to the middleground and background. Cool colours can always be added later if needed.\n\nB weary f using too much water when mixing, so as to maintain a deeper colour, however you also don't want your paint to have a dry chalky appearance (This really may vary on the kind of effect you want to create)\n\nDrawing skills are an essential part of creating a good composition.\n\nSkies in landscapes should be gradiated through a series of washes and sponging.\n\nDon't mix too many colours and rather work in gradiations of tints.\n\nMastering washes, colours and softening edges require much practice and trial and error.\n\nBrushes should be well washed between different colour applications as it could lead to muddy colours.\n\nHe recommends paying attention to light and shadow. Wheter the light is natural or artificial? Where is comes from? How it reflects? The shadows they cast. How this affects the colour of an object.\n\nTheodore Henry Adolphus Fielding, 1781-1851\n\nTheodore Henry Adolphus Fielding, 1781-1851\n\nThomas Girtin\n\nTechniques\n\nThough this is a great medium for beginners to explore and play around with, it can also take a long time to truly master this medium. Combining various techniques or tools can have different effects and these take time to explore. I will briefly mention some basic tools and techniques followed when using watercolour.​\n\nWork with a variety of brushes, from flat to filbert\n\nCreate a good composition sketch that is detailed, but not too dark\n\nFrom the Sketchbook\n\nI am particularly drawn to the atmospheric details in Girtin's landscapes. His urban scene of La Porte St. Denis, Paris has a sort of abstract quality to as it seems unfinished in some places. Living in a large city myself I'm also more drawn to representing city life rather than landscapes. I find the geometry and symmetry created by buildings more an exciting, so I new I wanted to create a type of cityscape or urban scene. I also quite like seeing the interaction between the harsh lines of the city and the softness of the people who live in it, so I looked for images that have people in them too. Drawing inspiration from Girtin, I tried to create atmospheric blends, so once I had places down blotches of colour I would use another wet brush to spread and blur those. I have tried not to leave any hard edges. Similarly to the other artists, I have chosen to use a simple colour palette, but just working in more intense hues. I have chosen to work in blues and yellows with some orange to intensify the sunset. These colours also create a nice contrast and mood. Like Cozens, I was drawn to an image showing luminous light, as there is something powerful in how the light casts contrasting shadows and changes the appearance of colours. I made use of masking fluid to keep some of the areas more luminous. I feel like I have managed to capture the relationship between the city, nature (sun and clouds) and the people who live in it. The use of blurry and atmospheric hues give the impression that all three these elements are united. One really has no purpose without the other.\n\n* This painting is still not quite finished an requires finishing touches. Masking fluid still needs to be removed and I am still wondering whether I want to incorporate ink pen to give it a sketchy feeling as I have done with some of my previous watercolour portaits.\n\nDuring the late 18th to 19th century there were profound changes in the attitudes towards art. Paris was the center of Western art with artistic styles developing faster than before. These styles were influenced by the political, social and cultural transformations that preoccupied the 19th century. All eyes were focused on France, whose aristocracy and middle class had embraced Enlightenment and grown weary of absolutism, war and polite Christianity. Looking toward America and their establishment of a republic seemed like the perfect model for making them a more modern nation. At the end of the 18th century the people headed the French Revolution, looting, fighting and burning the street in their attempt to abolish political corruption. In 1799, Bonaparte staged a coupe and appointed himself as 'first consul', marking the end of the Revolution and the start of the Napoleonic era.\n\nIn America, the land was being tamed by the Europeans, providing them with a clean slate to build a major industrial and political power. It was a time of migration, combat, enterprise and commerce. All topics that dominated the American art scene. In England the Industrial Revolution was fueling mass consumption and economic growth, albeit at the high cost to the living quality of the workers, and a new thirst for expansion. By the end of the century, the British Empire controlled a fifth of the world's land and one quarter of the world's population. In other parts of Europe there were also conflicts regarding the church, the aristocracy and the monarchy, with a push for new social orders.\n\nRomanticism\n\nRomanticism does not really define a particular artistic style, but rather an artistic philosophy and the embrace of various styles. It was a movement governed by emotion and mans ability to 'return to nature', social justice and the individuals right to express freely. \" The turmoil of Romantic thought was a reflection of events in which hope and despair, enthusiasm and apathy alternated as man searched on for the freedom initiated by the Enlightenment\" (Copplestone, 1983:288). In politics, the Romantics aspired for individual rights and liberty. In art it meant following passion and emotion as the Romantics no longer judged art by a set of rules, but rather by inner reflection ans sensibility. \"Whereas the Neoclassical artists had striven after a style of impersonal clarity for the expression of universally relevant and eternally valid truths, the Romantics sought to express only their own feelings, beliefs, hopes and fears in all their myriad of forms\" (WHA, 640). Lithography also became a popular publishing technique, It is a process of creating drawings on stone with greasy chalk and it typifies the spontaneous fluency of the Romantic Movement.\n\nAntoine-Jean Gros\n\nAnother student of Jaques-Louis David, and probably his most successful student. Concerned with representing the aspirations of the empire and celebrating the glory of Napoleon, as is evident in Napoleon in the Plague House of Jaffa. He has used a grand style and allegory to depict the significance of this moment. He has depicted Napoleon as the ultimate rules, one with almost divine like gesture and touch. He handling of colour and rich strokes show the emotional intensity with which he backs the regime and serves as propaganda. This was the springboard for a freer more emotional style.\n\nNapoleon in the Plague House of Jaffa, Antoine-Jean Gros, 1804\n\nFrancisco de Goya\n\nA Spanish artists, considered one of the greatest and most prolific artists of the 19th century. His work embodied the characteristics of the Romantic movement, combining subjectivity, imagination, and emotion and was the creator of a new type of modern history painting. His works started as light hearted but later grew to be pessimistic and dark. \"Goya was an astute observer of the world around him, and his art responded directly to the tumultuous events of his day, from the liberations of the Enlightenment, to the suppressions of the Inquisition, to the horrors of war following the Napoleonic invasion\" (The Art Story, 2017).\n\nThe Third of May 1808, Francisco de Goya, 1814\n\nThe painting shows French Soldiers shooting innocent civilians after in uprising against the French army of occupation. Goya hated injustice and he is directing the viewer's attention to the victims, showing you their faces to connect you with them sympathetically. The twisted bodies in the foreground point out the gruesomeness of Napoleon's thirst for power. It is a chilling image of referred to as the first modern painting.\n\nTwo old men eating soup, Francisco de Goya, 1819-1823\n\nThis is one of 14 'black paintings' that Goya created o the walls of his home. He was 70 at the time and had suffered an unknown illness that left him deaf. The image is haunting and provokes the viewer to the of the finality of life. The figure on the left has grimace on his face and an expression that may allude to insanity. The figure on the right appears almost skeletal and lifeless. He used broad and free brush strokes and incorporated a palette knife. Their is a clear plan to how each stroke has the potential to enhance the expression of these two men. It certainly shows a shift in the interpretation of subjects.\n\nThe Raft of the Medusa, Théodore Géricault, 1819\n\nThéodore Géricault\n\nThis French painter worked with a dramatic and flamboyant style. He was skilled in capturing the energy of moving figures, which is seen in The Raft of Medusa. On the raft are the survivors of a French shipwreck. The survivors are being decimated by the sun, sea and starvation. It was a controversial portrayal of of a French captain who abandoned his lower ranking crew to save himself and his officers. As with Goya, he is placing the focus on the victims. There is a passionate and realistic virtuosity to the composition.\n\nRomanticism and Philosophy\n\n\"Romanticism is a philosophical movement during the Age of Enlightenment which emphasizes emotional self-awareness as a necessary per-condition to improving society and bettering the human condition (Philosophy Basics, 2017). It was largely centered in Germany which is why most of the painters were much more closer associated with the German poets and philosophers than those of France. It stood in opposition to the preceding schools of Rationalism and Empiricism of the preceding Age of Reason. It moved from the objective to the subjective, representing a freedom of expression which greatly affected the Arts.\n\nWanderer above the Sea of Fog, Caspar David Friedrich, 1818\n\nCaspar David Friedrich\n\nThis German painter 'sought to paint thoughts and emotions which could not be put into words' (WHA: 651) and in doing so to the Genre of landscape paintings to new heights. His moody landscapes transports the viewer into the wilds of nature, which for his has great spiritual significance, a contemplation of God's magnificence and presence in the world.\n\nIn the Wanderer Above the Mist he has created a rare viewpoint that elevates the viewer. There is an intimacy and mystery about the figure and the landscape he looks out on. The figure is alienated and standing on the edge of reality, a poetic representation of Friedrich's own grappling with faith and the natural order.\n\nHis work was not well received by critics, as many didn't understand his allegorical representations of God in nature. Even so, his paintings went on to become a great proponent in Modern Art.\n\nRomantic Landscape Painting\n\nSlavery remained legal in England until 1834, in France until 1848 and in the USA until 1865. Artists played a strong role in creating an awareness of this disturbing trade and the particular atrocities committed at sea. It was a combination of humanitarian demands and political pressure that finally lead to the abolishment of the slave trade.\n\nThe Bridge Of Augustus Over The Nera, Jean Baptiste Camille Corot, 1826\n\nJean-Baptiste-Camille Corot\n\nIn France the transformation of Romantic landscapes took a slower course than in Germany and England. One French artist that was a proponent of the genre finally meeting an even more transcendental spontaneity and freedom was, Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot. The emotional authenticity in depicting an uncorrupted nature inspired a cult following which later inspired may impressionists. the French Academy at this time had given an academic respect to the the landscape genre, although they still persisted in a close study of nature, know as etudes. Only once you truly understood the form of nature, could you move on to creating imaginative compositions of it. Corot focused on the subtleties of tone rather than hard lines and depictions, seen in The Bridge of Augustus Over the Nera by his use of free and loaded brush strokes.\n\nArchitecture and the Romantic Movement\n\nIn architecture there was also a demand for representing the new ideals of the 19th century. This still posed a problem, as architects were dependent on patrons and the freedom movement in painting was harder to translate in building. Following a decline in the 'Empire Style' that was promoted by Napoleon, there was definitely a need for a new architecture, thus, during the course of the 19th century there were several revivals in style, including Classical (Greek and Roman), Italian Renaissance and Gothic. With Gothic being a particular favorite around Europe and England. A good example is the Houses of Parliament in London, built by Sir Charles Barry and Augustus W.N. Pugin. For Pugin the revival of Gothic architecture was like a revival of faith. He was a great proponent for the revival of Gothic architecture. In England, France and Germany architects felt that it represented a 'national genius' and 'patriotic feeling' (Janson & Cauman, 1982: 301).\n\nHouse of Parliament, London, 1839-52, Sir Charles Barry and Augustus W.N. Pugin\n\nBibliothèque Sainte-Geneviève, Henri Labrouste, 1843-50\n\nHistoricism\n\nHistoricism is the idea of finding meaning and significance in historical periods in a specific social context, like time, place and location. It holds that these social contexts have an 'organic succession of developments', which can be studied (Mastin, 2008). There are different branches and influincers in the filed of Historicism, most notably Georg Hegel, Karl Marx and Charles Darwin. Hegel developed a dialectical scheme with which to synthesize the events of history. Marx believed that society was in a constant struggle of classes and he was a great proponent for socialism, or Marxism. Darwin was a naturalist who through his studies of natural history came up with his theory of evolution. The study of history also effected the arts, as painters began to depict glimpses of times passed. This is evident in the work of Ingres, who captured an Historical tableaux of the imagined life of Raphael and Leonardo through exquisite still-lifes.\n\nThe Pre-Raphaelites\n\nIn 1827-1910 there was a group of artists who founded the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood with the aim of returning to nature and rouncing academic practices. The group consisted of William Homan Hunt, John Everett Millias and Dante Gabriel Rosetti among others.\n\nJohn Everett Millais\n\nThis English painter became on of the most famous exponents of the Pre-Raphaelite style with his depiction of Christ in the House of His Parents. The painting was received with much controvercy due to the all-to-realistic depiction of the carpenters workroom filled with dirt. Previously religious subjects were depicted in classical garb, in clean and poised condition.\n\nHe later developed a new powerful from of realism and moved away from the Brotherhood.\n\nChrist in the House of His Parents, John Everett Millais, 1849–50\n\nRealism\n\nThe Realism Movement began around 1840 and is recognized as the first from of modern art. Realists rejected the traditional norms of art, choosing to represent the revolutions and social changes that marked this time period. This meant moving towards depictions of real every day life. They also abandoned may transitional techniques like perspective and anatomy. This often lead to an 'ugly' portrayal of the life and events around them. The Realists' motto, 'one must be of one's own time', sprung from a Romantic idea. It encouraged artists to select unpictueresque and unconventional subject matter. This was also confirmed in the writings of Russian born Nikolai Chernyshevskii, an essay entitled The Aesthetic Relation of Art to Reality. He writes that art should reflect current and social moral problems, not only in subject matter but also in technique.\n\nGustave Courbet\n\nThis great French painter was central to the Realism Movement. He rejected the Academies traditional style and insisted on capturing what he observed in its full and blemished reality. He was concerned with much of the social events of his times and used his work to highlight those that are overlooked, like his fellow country folk. He often depicted events that would be considered minor in the realms of history and depicted them as grand historical moments, like in A Burial at Ornans. His method of applying paint thickly and in broken flecks and slabs, were stylistic innovations later admired and promoted by modernist painters.\n\nThe Stonebreakers, Gustave Courbet, 1849\n\nThe Stonebearers are clearing a road that is being built. They are depicted in warn and tattered clothing. He has set them in isolation, symbolic of being economically and physically trapped.\n\nJean-François Millet\n\nThis French portrait painter was greatly occupied with capturing the lives of those without possessions. He often painting peasants in the midst of hard labour as he viewed this as true virtue and godliness. His work was often viewed as controversial or serving a socialist agenda. For Millet it was more about giving a voice to more than half of the French population who were not yet reaping the benefits of financial prosperity. His use of Naturalism and non romaticized subjects paved the way for later Modern painters and photographers.\n\nIn The Angelus, he depicts a man and woman pausing during the church bells to pray. He affords them with a quiet dignity, despite the dirt on their clothes, by presenting them as central to the subject and with sculptural like poses. Both ideas that were previously used for religious subjects. The sky appears to be faiding to dusk, but their toil still continues. In many of his paintings there appears to be a looming darkness that the subjects cannot escape. Though these paintings were shocking or controversial at the time, they are now veiled as nostalgia.\n\nThe Execution of the Emperor Maximilian, Edouard Manet, 1867\n\nEdouard Manet\n\nFrench poet and renowned art critic, Chalres Baudelaire called for an artist who would take account of the transformation of 19th century society and modern life. Manet answered this call by producing many striking images of modern urban life. It is his combination of old and new that gave him a unique voice. Using techniques or conventions from the old master and injecting the new ideas of realism and naturalism with a fine balance.\n\nThe Execution of the Emperor Maximilian was first banned for its depiction of the Mexican Emperor being executed by Mexican nationalists dresses in French uniforms. This makes Maximilian appear as a victim of the imperial regime, which Manet, a convinced socialist, hated.\n\nThe painting represents the way in which Manet redefined the Romantic notion. Not through a sole focus on emotion or sympathy, but on artistic honesty and suited the notion of the Realists, 'one must be of one's own time'. It encouraged artists to select unpictueresque and unconventional subject matter.\n\nA View of the Mountain Pass Called the Notch of the White Mountains (Crawford Notch), Thomas Cole, 1839\n\nThe USA\n\nIn America, painters were very much concerned with the realist idea of painting around their own time and circumstances. This meant favoring still lifes and landscapes. With America having grand and untouched scenery, it made it the ideal subject for artists.\n\nThomas Cole, and English born American painter, lead the landscape genre through his foundation of the Hudson River School. He was particularly adept at capturing the wilderness of America, through his bold use of colour and chiaroscuro.\n\nAnother social issue facing America was the plight of the African Americans ho had been freed from slavery when it was officially abolished in 1865. During the following decades African Americans were more frequently included in genre scenes. They were, however, often depicted in jovial scenes, dancing and grinning, which perpetuated the myth of a stable social structure, when really this continued to be a central issue in America up to the African American civil rights movement of the 1950s and ’60s. Two artists concerned with highlighting the life of African Americans were Homer and Tanner.\n\nDressing for the Carnival, Winslow Homer, 1877\n\nWinslow Homer\n\nThis expressive American artists is best known for his paintings of marine subjects.\n\nThe late 19th century saw a rise of paintings depicting African Americans at carnival time, often shown as mindless, jolly and condescending. But Homer's is deeply nuanced and captures and almost tragic preparation for the African-American festival known in the South as Jonkonnu.\n\nThe Thankful Poor, Henry Ossawa Tanner, 1894\n\nHenry Ossawa Tanner\n\nTanner was partly of African American descent and himself endured persecutions by white gang youths. He wanted to depict the seriousness of the lives of African Americans, representing scenes in a touching and empathetic way. Art historian Judith Wilson said that he had the great ability to, “invest their ordinary, underprivileged, Black subjects with a degree of dignity and self-possession that seems extraordinary for the times in which they were painted\" (Wilson, 1992). The First Lesson and The Thankful Poor are two of his greatest examples of this.\n\nPhotography\n\nBefore the invention of the camera there was the camera obscura, basically a dark room with a lens in one hole that projects the outside view onto the opposite wall. Many artists made use of some form of it, like Vermeer and Canaletto. Nicéphore Niépce, a Frenchman concerned with lithography succeeded in fixing images from camera obscura to metal and glass plates, between 1822-26. Though the result was not brilliant, the potential of it was noticed by Louis-Jacques-Mandé Daguerre. In 1837 he experimented with a technique later labelled daguerreotype in which he was able to record a scene on a copper coated plate with silver. Meanwhile in England 1837, Fox Talbot experimented with a technique in which the camera recorded a negative image that again had to be exposed in order to transfer it to sensitized paper to create a positive print. The advantage of these negatives is that multiple prints could be made or even transferred to lithographs. Meanwhile the daguerreotype method was growing in success, especially in America for the use of portraits. They were seen as an alternative to paintings and still considered the relationship between artist and sitter.\n\nFrom the beginning the relationship between painting and photography was complex and many questioned the medium as a form of artistic expression. For the Romantics however it met their desires to capture visual appearance, but others questioned whether one could see or feel the artist's touch. Others realized how it could be a shortcut to art, providing the opportunity to capture detailed images without the intense training in life drawing and perspective.\n\nYoung boy with gun and powderhorn, Whitehurst, Daguerreotype, 1890,\n\nThe Tomb of Sir Walter Scott, in Dryburgh Abbey, William Henry Fox Talbot , 1844\n\nThe subject of photography as art was one of great contention. During a lawsuit in Paris, a judge ruled that photography required though, spirit, taste and intelligence thus qualifying as art. They were still, however excluded from the salons and exhibited separately.\n\nPhotographs were also considered an important tool for capturing and recording moments of truth and reflections of the real world.\n\nThis became all to clear during the American Civil War, where photographers captured the gruesome scenes of soldiers strewn across the fields, as can be seen in A Harvest of Death, Battlefield of Gettysburg. The low angle chosen by O'Sullivan highlights the magnitude of the devastation.\n\nA Harvest of Death, Battlefield of Gettysburg, Timothy O'Sullivan, 1863\n\nPhotographs soon became an aid in painting. Thomas Eakins, an American Realist painter, was one of the first to embrace photography as a tool in painting, arranging to have studio models posed and photographed. Others followed suit, particularly naturalistic painters, who were able to use photographs as a means of capturing fleeting moments and details that are often missed by the human eye.\n\nDuring the 19th Century there were many political developments in Europe, as the different nations had a growing interest in establishing new national identities, leading to this century being known as the century of revolutions. The greatest impacts being the French Revolution and Napoleon, the political after effects of this as well as the Industrial Revolution ,1789–1845. And from 1849-1914, the fuller impact of an industrial society including new forms of states and of diplomatic and military alignments.\n\nFrance was the main focus of activity during these 'revolutions, though by no means exclusive. These events played a great role in in creating a new artistic climate, Realism, one that challenged the previously accepted conventions of Classicism and Romanticism. Realists were no longer interested in facades, but rather in truth and accuracy (Copplestone, 1983). The Salons however still played a great role in controlling the art during this time. They favored only conventional Classical approaches and styles. As the Salons were the only form of public exhibition and ways for artist to gain recognition it create a divide among those who wanted to play safe an maintain their recognition, and those who were willing to push boundaries with new realistic and experimental ways, like Courbet and Manet. In revolt, a small group of artists, notably Impressionists established the Salon des Refuses in 1863 for those works rejected by the Salon. Much of the public was outraged by these exhibitions as they could not understand the loose handling and broken patches of the Impressionists work. At one of the Impressionist exhibitions in Paris, 1876, one critic described the participants as, \"five or six lunatics, one of which is a woman\" (The Art Story)\n\nThe Impressionist movement is characterized by a fascination with light, individual and visible brush strokes, and unrefined surface, the reflection and movement of light, particularly water, a diversity of combinations in colour hues. They looked at a fleeting moment and tried to capture these changes in nature as they eye would experience them. The archetypal Impressionist painting is a landscape our out door subject painted in plein air. It does not rely on tonal contrasts but on small touches of vibrant colour. Most Impressionist artists typically conveyed middle-class visions of care-free happiness. These also included urban night life and the vitality of street cafes, bars and cabarets. The Impressionist Movement brought importance to the materials of paint and how they formed part of the content of a painting.\n\nIt was Monet's conviction that he was challenge the way we see, and how all moments are fleeting perceptions. He became ever more concerned with the decorative qualities of color and form. He worked on creating a series of images on the same subject during different times of the day. Below is a series of Haystack paintings showing these different impressions of light and colour.\n\nHaystacks in the Morning, Claude Monet, 1890\n\nHaystacks - End of Summer, Claude Monet, 1891\n\nHaystack, Morning Snow Effect, Claude Monet, 1890\n\nView of Paris from the Trocadero, Berthe Morisot, 1871-72\n\nBerthe Morisot\n\nAs a female artist Morisot was barred from painting some subjects available to her male counterparts. Even so she was still considered an innovator of the Impressionist movement, covering a wide varied of subject matter. He style was fresh and spontaneous. In View of Paris from the Trocadero we see her casual approach to composition and fluid brushwork. Her subjects were always of a personal nature and later often included her favorite model, her daughter.\n\nEduard Manet\n\nHe produced many striking images of modern urban life. It is his combination of old and new that gave him a unique voice. Using techniques or conventions from the old master and injecting the new ideas of realism and naturalism with a fine balance. However it was Manet's refusal of convention and his ability to challenge three-dimensional perspective that inspired the artists that followed to explore the unconventional. His painting A Bar at the Folies-Bergere became one of his most evocative works. There is a combination of artificial and natural, illusion and reality, making this a great 'modern' image.\n\nA Bar at the Folies-Bergère, Eduard Manet, 1881-2\n\nThey viewer is not only captivated by the barmaid, but by a peek into what is in the reflection of the mirror behind her. Her expression and empty stare may also refer to the loneliness of city life.\n\nEdgar Degas\n\nHe preferred not to be labelled as an impressionist as he felt he had his own individual style. Unlike the others, he was not obsessed with landscapes, but rather urban life. He was still concerned with light and movement, but still captured his subjects with a great Realsim. He loved modern life and aimed to capture both the illusion and reality it had to offer. Particularly intrigued bu the human figure, he created several oil and pastel paintings of female dancers and singers, often in unusual positions. He wanted to capture the realism of this difficult and tiring profession. The woman are depicted strong, disciplined and engaged in their craft, with muscles bulging and fatigue showing. He said he depicted honest woman who were not over involved in their physical condition.\n\nWomen on the Terrace, Edgar Degas, 1877\n\nDancers, Edgar Degas, 1884\n\nJaponisme\n\nIn earlier centuries Western painter were unlikely to embrace and learn from non-Western art, but this changed in the late 19th century, as their was a successive wave of discovery of alien cultures, first of which was Japanese. Many of the Impressionists were influenced by Japanese Prints, which were a combination of bold linear designs. They had a sense which made them quite different from traditional Western art and its perspective view of the world. Their influence helped artists to further break the spell of Classical tradition. Prints were of of vulgar subject matter and used bold colours and unorthodox viewpoints. It had a particularly influence on Degas, who says it helped him to see form. It also affected artists like Monet on viewpoint.The concern with reconciling three-dimensional illusions with a flat painted surface is where Japanese art had its greatest influence, particularly when looking at works by Mary Cassat, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec and Paul Gauguin.\n\nThe Coiffure, Mary Cassat, 1891\n\nCassat was an American artist who exhibited with the Impressionists in Paris from 1879 onward. Influenced by Japanese woodblock prints, she created this image of a woman doing her hair.\n\nJane Avril au Jardin Paris, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, 1893\n\nLautrec created graphic posters that represented Paris nightlife. Here we see how Japanese art has influenced the compositions as he combines patterns, pictorial elements and lettering.\n\nThe Vision After the Sermon, Paul Gaguin, 1888\n\nGaguin enthusiastically collected Japanese prints and use them along with other non European works as inspiration in his own work. The combat seen in The Vision After the Sermon is similar to the Japanese Manga. He has used dark contours, brilliant colour and their are no cast shadows which leaves the space feeling flat.\n\nNeo-Impressionism\n\nAround 1880 artists were reacting against Impressionism, and it faced a crisis. They felt that the fleeting nature in which work was capture created limitations. 'Monet, Pissarro and Renoir began to feel that their art had serious shortcomings, not least of which was a lack of solidity, permanence and emotional commitment' (Copplestone, 1983: 311). However Renoir would argue that it allowed for a freedom to create on any subject, without dictation on what to paint. Regardless, artists wanted, once again, for art to be more 'meaningful'. Another delima they were faced with was a lack of greater official recognition, as shows were met with little financial success.\n\nDivisionism or Pointillism\n\nIn this technique, small strokes or dots of colour are placed next to each and form an image when viewed from a distance. It is mostly associated with its inventor George Seurat and his student Paul Signac. Seurat Called it chromo-luminarism.\n\nSocialism also had a great influence on Neo-impressionist artists like Signac, Pissaro and Henri Edmond Cross. Though today their works would simply seem carefree or lyrical, at the turn of the 19th century they were seen as propaganda, highlighting the great social struggle between the workers and capital.\n\nSymbolism\n\nThis was a movement that turned to imagination and fantasy, by suggesting ideas through symbols, shapes, forms and colours. Artists made use of abstract means to represent psychological truths, putting it at the forefront of modernism. Artists made use of feelings, ideas and personal experiences to express truth in an often more nuanced and suggestive way. It began as a literary movement that celebrated the use of imagination as an important form of creativity, greatly inspired by the French poets Stephane Mallarme, Paul Verlaine and Arthur Rimbaud (Becket, 1994)\n\nConsider works by Emile Bernard, Gustav Klimt and James Ensor.\n\nSpringtime, Emile Bernard, 1892\n\nDeath and Life, Gustav Klimt, 1908-16\n\nDeath and the Masks, James Ensor, 1897\n\nPaul Gauguin\n\nThough this French artist was schooled in Impressionism, he broke away from the movement to pursue his own expressions. He liked experimenting with colour theories and decorative approaches to painting. He travelled regularly to the south Pacific, \"where he developed a new style that married everyday observation with mystical symbolism, a style strongly influenced by the popular, so-called \"primitive\" arts of Africa, Asia, and French Polynesia\" (The Art Story). Innocence vs. Knowledge and Savage vs. Civilized became central themes of his work. Looking at his paintings Spirit of the Dead Watching and Where do we come from?, Who are we?, Where are we going?, we feel the intimate connection he found in the Polynisian culture. The compositions are rhythmic and poetic, combined with a sense of imagination and local folklore. The latter representing an allegory of human life from infancy to old age.\n\nSpirit of Death Watching, Paul Gauguin, 1892\n\nWhere do we come from?, Who are we?, Where are we going?, Paul Gauguin, 1897\n\nAllegory\n\nAllegorical paintings were widely used throughout history to covey deeper moral or spiritual meanings such as life, death, love, virtue, justice etc. What makes Allegory different from Symbolism, is that an allegorical painting has to be deciphered by the viewer and are often only intelligible to those who have insight to the cultural context. During the 19th century it had widely fell out of favour, but for a few artist using it to test he ambiguity with which a viewer would interpret their works. Artists like Walton Ford and Kara Walker and Edvard Munch.\n\nArt Nouveau\n\nArt Nouveau was a movement in the decorative arts and architecture throughout Europe during the turn of the 19th century. Its aim was to modernize design, drawing inspiration from organic and geometric forms, particularly flowers. It was a revival in craftsmanship and design. The Academies placed a high importance on Painting and Sculpture, which meant that craft work was considered a lower form of creative expression. The Art Nouveau movement sought to change this by creating their own style, one that is not just an imitation of styles that came before. It resulted in pieces that were shaped organically and with a sense of freedom. For example, looking at the Tassel House, we see the curved shapes that resemble vines not only in the design of the stairs but also echoed in the decoration of the tiles and walls. A more radical example is the Casa Mila, with its asymmetrical and jagged planes creating an organic interplay between the interior and exterior.\n\nTassel House, Brussels, Belgium by Victor Horta, 1892-3\n\nCasa Mila, Barcelona, Spain by Antoni Gaudi, 1905-7\n\nIn painting, artists like Gauguin and Lautrec also experimented with Art Nouveau in their use of expressive lines. This movement really was the stepping stone to modern art and letting go of the past. Architects and artists alike approached their designs with a new sense of freedom. In America, the introduction of metal and steel as a building material saw structures reaching new hights, as skyscrapers started filling the skylines. Its greatest imapact was the ability to prefabricate building parts, which lead to mass production and faster building times. One architect who truly developed the combination of stone and iron for structural and decorative purposes is Baron Victor Horta, a Belgium architect.\n\nIt became a popular feature in this Age of Iron to leave the metalwork exposed and celebrated, like the Eiffel Tower or the Bibliotheque Nationale in Paris.\n\nThe elaborate style of Art Nouveau in Europe was greatly influenced by the works of English artists exhibited there, like Aubrey Beardsley and paintings by the Pre-Raphaelites (Copplestone, 1983)\n\nDomestic Architecture\n\nOn both sides of the Atlantic the middle class had a new need for small detached homes that were designed to the individual's special requirements. Generally these designs represented an escape for the 'city workers', a form of rural bliss.\n\nPost Industrial Revolution\n\nMany cities were still reeling from the political, social, cultural and economic changes brought about by the Industrial Revolution. Though it was a time of great technological growth and advancements, it also represented a huge gap in wealth and power, which left many nostalgic for simpler times, in particular the Impressionists.\n\nArtists turned to religion, mysticism and new transcendentalism in order to escape the bourgeois life, that was bent on materials and capitalist interests (Selz, 1981).\n\nPaul Cézanne\n\nPaul Cézanne is credited with paving the way for modern art. As a Post-Impressionist, he was at the forefront of taking some of the Impressionist ideals and combining them with meaning and meditation. He sought to return art as a sculptural or structural representation, where each part is integral to the whole. He had a unique method of combining colour in distinct tonal various to create form.\n\nExercise: Collect some 19th-century images of everyday life\n\nCollect some images of rural life by Realist and Impressionist artists and some images of the city by Impressionist and Post- Impressionist painters.\n\n- Think about the extent to which the rural works present stereotypical figures and what the urban images tell you about everyday life. Reflect on how close the artists were to the rural and urban scenes they depicted.\n\n- Look at their depiction of landscape and think about whether they represent scenes of the countryside as a working or a holiday environment.\n\n- Think about how the reproduction of such images on calendars and souvenirs has influenced the way in which we respond to them.\n\nRealists\n\nThe Realism Movement began around 1840 and is recognized as the first from of modern art. Realists rejected the traditional norms of art, choosing to represent the revolutions and social changes that marked this time period. This meant moving towards depictions of real every day life. They also abandoned may transitional techniques like perspective and anatomy. This often lead to an 'ugly' portrayal of the life and events around them.\n\nGustave Courbet\n\nA great French painter central to the Realism Movement. His method of applying paint thickly and in broken flecks and slabs, were stylistic innovations later admired and promoted by modernist painters.He rejected the Academies traditional style and insisted on capturing what he observed in its full and blemished reality. He was concerned with social events and those that are overlooked, like his fellow country folk. He often depicted minor events as grand historical moments, like in A Burial at Ornans. The focus in this image is truly on the people and the event. The landscape merely serves as a backdrop. The artist clearly has a emotive response to the people as he has taken time to show each facial expression and response. As a viewer you can sense the admiration and respect for this community who has lost someone dear and is taking the time to honor them. There is a sense of closeness in this community and that the burden of this loss is carried by all of them. The colour palette further adds to the somber feeling. He is showing that all life is precious and deserves to be honored. This is also reflected in the great representation of church men in their robes, sashes and scepters.\n\nJean-François Millet\n\nThis French portrait painter was greatly occupied with capturing the lives of those without possessions, often painting peasants in the midst of hard labour as he viewed this as true virtue and godliness. For Millet it was more about giving a voice to the less wealthy working class which made up more than half of the French population who were not yet reaping the benefits of financial prosperity. In The Gleaners we see three woman harvesting. They are hunched and working low, showing the intensity of this kind of labour. He painted with a very Naturalistic style, not over-dramatizing or romanticizing his subjects. He meerly aimed to tell the truth about these countrymen. Many interpreted his work as having a socialist agenda, but as a viewer today looking at it, you simply experience a glimpse of what a day was like for these harvesters. The figures are still the main subject and focal point in the image, however the landscape certainly forms part of the narrative. His use of perspective and the buildings in the background give you a sense of how vast the land is that they have to clear, again providing you with an insight to how grueling their day might be. The colour palette is almost monochrome with mostly dull and dusty colours, which also highlights the nature of the work. Similarly to Courbet, there is a sense of deep respect for his subjects.\n\nEduard Manet\n\nHe produced many striking images of modern urban life. It is his combination of old and new that gave him a unique voice. Using techniques or conventions from the old master and injecting the new ideas of realism and naturalism with a fine balance. Luncheon on the Grass is a great example of combining the old with the new. We have the classical female nude with curved figures and romanticized features, alongside two gentlemen conversing in a park setting while fully dressed. This contrast alone confused The Salon at the time. What was Manet trying to say about the relationship between the 4 figures? The men appear to be almost ignoring the female , while the female seems to be posing or modelling for the viewer, while the female in the background hardly seems to be part of the luncheon at all. the food, landscape and setting seems very much staged, which as a viewer also makes you question its purpose. Manet often used sets and models to create his work which may explain the lack of depth, inconsistent lighting and posy-ness of the figures. As a viewer it reminds me of a more modern magazine add, likely selling some cream or beauty product that makes you feel comfortable in your own skin. However it was Manet's refusal of convention and his ability to challenge three-dimensional perspective that inspired the artists that followed to explore the unconventional. In contrast to Courbet and Millet, Manet's subjects were wealthier and able to explore more of the pleasures in life. Here the landscape serves as a playground. The subjects have food, conversation and time, luxuries the labouring countrymen would not have had.\n\nJules Breton\n\nThis French Painter was heavily influenced by the French countryside and used traditional methods to capture its beauty, often with almost idyllic vision. Growing up in the countryside he had a great admiration for the landscape as well as the peasants who served it. He is particularly drawn to how the sun interacts with the land, which can be seen in his works The End of the Work Day and The Song of the Lark.\n\nWhat is interesting about his depictions of the peasant and the landscape compared to Millet and Courbet, is the sense of hope that you get from his work. There is off course still a great respect for those working the land, but his figures appear to feel as though their work is rewarding. The woman in The Song of the Lark is depicted with a great Realism and Naturalism, as she walks the land barefoot. As a viewer I don't feel that this is to show her poverty, but rather her connection to the earth. She appears to be taking in the sky and her surroundings as this sun sets in a great radiant ball of red. His landscape is presented vast and with colour, a nod at how her labours are serving the land.\n\nThe Song of the Lark, Jules Breton, 1884\n\n​Impressionists\n\nImpressionism was a modern art movement that began in 1860. It was a collection of artist who rejected the conservatism of the French Academies and their 'salon' exhibitions. Their goal was to capture the momentary and sensory effect of a scene, as a result many of them were plein air painters. Like the Realists they abandoned traditional techniques and explored increasingly loose brush strokes and intense colours with an almost distorted impression of form. Their work was often criticized as looking unfinished. Science and the study of how the eye perceives had a great impact on this movement as artists tried to capture optical an lighting effects.\n\nGustave Caillebotte\n\nThough his work falls more under the spectrum of Realism, he was a great supporter of Impressionist art. It was also his choice of subject matter and highlighting every day life that sets his work apart. He was particularity fascinating by how the ever modernizing urban environment had the ability to alienate individuals. In Paris Street, Rainy Day he has put an emphasis on how individuals seem caught up in the city life. The concern about what to wear, how to behave and getting from A-B without even making eye contact. The landscape is presented with great depth and perspective. The detail in the architecture, lines and colouring shows that he does respect mans ability to create a great urban landscape, it is likely more the effect of that landscape on the people that concerned him. Having grown up in the city myself I can appreciate how people may get caught up and forget to take in their surroundings, but as an overall image, I still feel a sense of romanticism and nostalgia, perhaps that is just because of the depiction of the rain, which I associate with calm, serenity and growth. Thus my impression of his paintings is likely different from his intention.\n\nClaude Monet\n\nHis plein air technique of applying the brush quickly with emphasis on light and atmosphere became the hallmarks of Impressionism. In Vetheuil in the Fog we can see his captivation with light, particularly in the reflections on the water, where is fast short brush strokes really makes the water fells as though it is actual flickering. The image has movement and as a viewer your captured in the moment, the exact moment in fact that he was experiencing while painting it, so it is almost like stepping into his shoes. Colours are still quite realistic, although very vivid. This is a type of landscape that is to be enjoyed. You can imagine yourself along the river banks, taking in the sun, watching boats row by as you much on a sandwich. His technique makes the landscape feel alive, moving and ever changing, as it would be.\n\nPost Impressionists\n\nPost impressionism is a response to the opticality of Impressionism. It encompasses a wide range of artistic styles, but its central idea is that it represents the artist's subjective vision. Painting now longer just represented a glimpse of the world, but also of the artists soul. Paintings became highly symbolic and emotional.\n\nHenri Rousseau\n\nHenri Rousseau was a French self-taught painter. He painted with a characteristic flat figurative style, often creating surreal and dream-like scenes in primitive or natural settings.\n\nIn The Dream he has taken the traditional subject of the the female nude and interpreted in his unique style. the female reclines, curiously on a couch in the jungle. She appears to be captivated by her tropical and exotic surroundings. He explained that she is really on her couch in Paris, merely dreaming of the jungle. He has used vibrant colours and a flat plain to further enhance the dreamlike feel. Ironically Rousseau had never been to a jungle and created his landscapes from imagination. It was his way of escaping the modernized lifestyle. As he is the creator of the landscape, the rules of reality and naturalism need not apply. He is clearly showing that those stuck in the urban jungle would rather dream about being in the actual jungle.\n\nExercise: Still life in the 18th and 19th centuries\n\nIn the 17th century still life made use of allegory. In the next century symbolic meanings became less important. In France the Academies still had a great influence on works, pushing more noble and traditional agendas, though there were many artists who began to revolt against these traditions and techniques. Art that represented day-today life was not commonplace during this time. The still life was seen as a form of practice, for artist to hone their techniques and build their skill, not as it's own excepted genre. However, when Jean-Siméon Chardin was excepted to the Academy, he made great strides in highlighting this genre as one of importance. These were not without moral overtones, however, conveying a sense of order and rectitude in a harmonious world. Either try your hand at drawing or painting a still life, or reflect in your learning log on how artists’ writings have helped you to understand their work.\n\nGustave Courbet\n\nAs mentioned before, he rejected the Academies teaching of idealism and focussed on representing subjects realistically, with blemishes and all. Looking at Still Life with Apples and Pomegranate can still see that there is a very traditional approach to his composition. Objects have been staged with a specific light source creating interest. He has stuck true to his realism, in showing the gritty surroundings (He was in prison while painting this) as well as the state of the kitchen ware. The shapes of the apples also aren't glamoured and there bumpy exteriors give them a rustic feel. He used a broad and summary technique to capture the subject, and they have been kept as the focal point of the composition.\n\nStill Life with Apples and a Pomegranate, Gustave Courbet, 1871-2\n\nTable, Napkin, and Fruit (A Corner of the Table), Paul Cézanne1895-1900\n\nPaul Cézanne\n\nHe was a French post-impressionist painter who paived the way for the modern painting movement. His paintings related one object to another through rhyming shapes and colours within his overall composition. He looked at items as sculptural and considered their make-up and material. This gave his work an architectural and analytical feel, viewing objects in terms of cylinders, spheres and cones, making a great impact on Cubism.\n\nWe can see his manipulation of space and objects in Table, Napkin and Fruit. The fruit appears to be on the flat wooden surface, but alos as though floating at the same time. He doesn't draw you into the scene, but rather around the canvas, almost as though the surface is flat and 3 dimensional at the same time.\n\nVincent Van Gogh\n\nHe used bold colours and shapes to alter the visual appearances of things for emotive or expressive effect. His celebrated pictures of sunflowers lack the meticulous accuracy of a botanical illustration but have all the intensity of a passionate response to nature. Similarly to Cézanne the subject appears flat and 3 dimensional at the same time. However, as a viewer, the emotional response definitely is stronger to the Basket and Six Oranges, which was van Gogh's goal. His fast strokes and soft edges make the fruit feel alive, while his sharp and contrasting colours make the fruit inviting. Though he has made use of lighting contrasts, these are subtle and even toned, also providing a sense of harmony between each element on the canvas.\n\nStill Life with Basket and Six Oranges, Vincent van Gogh, 1888\n\nJean-Baptiste-Siméon Chardin\n\nMany of the still lifes created by Chardin was in decoration of homes and shops, like decorative fireplaces and spaces above mantle pieces or doors. Similarly to the Dutch Masters he focused on using everyday items, like kitchen ware or flowers and creating softly lit snapshots of domestic life, ordinary objects of a middle-class household, often in the kitchen or the store room rather than on display. The clarity and realism in his work was exemplary. He aimed to evoke pleasure in looking at his scenes. The objects he chose did not really have a symbolic meaning, but they were rather chosen for their interesting shapes or textures. For him it was about creating harmony on the canvas. The simplicity and luminosity of the work simply allows the viewer to appreciate the geometry and balance used to create them. Even though there is a crisp realism to his work, it is also not too fussy with details, a delicate balance that makes him a master still life painter.\n\nThe Silver Goblet, Jean Baptiste Siméon Chardin, 1768\n\nBasket of Peaches, Jean Baptiste Siméon Chardin, 1768\n\nReflection\n\nWhen it comes to still life, I generally feel like they tend to be a bit staged. Off course they need to be in order to create something of visual interest. I admire artists like Chardin who can create such a crisp realistic image, which we would now call photo-realistic art. And while I appreciate the technique and skill hat would go into their work, I don't necessarily find it as appealing as the works by van Gogh and Courbet. This is because I am an emotional viewer, so looking at works that affect me emotionally are more appealing. I think you would have to make use a more stylistic and expressive approach, like van Gogh to create that emotional response.\n\nFrom The Sketchbook\n\nI have taken a bit more inspiration from the work of Impressionist and post-Impressionist artists like Degas, van Gogh and Monet to create my composition. From the Impressionists I took the idea of breaking with tradition and not just representing a the classic bowl of fruit or flowers. Still life is not my go-to genre, but the ones that usually grab my attention are ones that play on light and reflection. Monet was also intrigued by water and it's ability to change according to the atmosphere and I think that using wine is an interesting exploration of this. Like Degas I wanted to capture my subject in an unusual angle. The image is cropped and angled from a higher viewpoint making it trickier to interpret as it feels like they all blend together. Like van Gogh I have kept to a simple and contrasting colour palette. Although yellow and red aren't quite complimentary, they do provide a warm contrast. I have also worked with think colours and brush strokes as he did, trying not to blend to much of the colours so they stand on their own. I enjoyed painting this with the idea of looser lines, as it takes away the pressure of being perfect or overly bogged down by details.\n\n* This painting is still unfinished as the last layer is till waiting to dry. Additional highlights and shadows still need to be added as the next layer.\n\nExhibition visit\n\nI was very fortunate that Christie's was having an aution in Hong Kong and as such all pieces were open for public view. There are view opprtunities like this in Hong Kong and the public were allowed remarkably close. There were 1000s of items on display, but I have uploaded some of my favorites. It was quite a surreal experience to stare at the work of Rembrandt and El Greco as their works date back so far. It is amazing to think what they achieved with the materials they had. I particularly liked get up close to the work of van Gogh and Monet, as you always read about their ability to create texture and impressions, but seeing it for yourself is quite different.\n\nProbably on of my favorite pieces of the day is Head of Man, 1959, by Francis Bacon. This is a very different take on a portrait and the use of colours and strokes give a very emotional feel to the piece. I like how bold and free he is with the brush, almost as if he lets his tools guide him. As an artist this is a kind of style I would like to explore and experiment with further.\n\nVisit an eighteenth-century neoclassical house\n\nHere you can view my report on the US Capitol Building here.\n\nReflection"
