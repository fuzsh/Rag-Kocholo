Previously, Kate received her Master of Arts degree and Certificate of Advanced study from the Cooperstown Graduate Program and received training at the Northeast Document Conservation Center (Andover, MA), the Conservation Center for Art and Historic Artifacts (Philadelphia, PA), the Philadelphia Museum of Art and the Art Institute of Chicago. Soon after arriving at SAAM, Kate was invited to join the editorial board of the American Institute for Conservation (AIC) Book and Paper Group’s pioneering publication, the Paper Conservation Catalog. Kate served as Project Director from 1989-1994 for the NEH grant supporting the publication and advised the AIC paintings and textiles specialty groups on launching similar projects.

To prepare for the major museum building renovation starting in 2000, Kate worked with SAAM and National Portrait Gallery colleagues to help design the new, visible labs of the Lunder Conservation Center.

Newland has been Director of Publishing at the Menil Collection since late 2011. After academic work on Sino-Japanese Buddhist architecture and art, much of the art on paper, and a gap year in a fine print gallery that was a ULAE dealer in their heyday, he worked in museum publishing in Seattle, Los Angeles, New York City, and Philadelphia before Houston. Along the way he learned to love papers, inks, and dry mediums, and he has thought a lot about documentation and description of same. A major professional concern in the art books he produces is revealing to the reader through pictures and texts what can be seen when viewing the artworks, as is how the ink kisses the paper. The latter is the most evident in the Jasper Johns Catalogue Raisonné of Drawings; and the former in the Menil Drawing Institute series that he co-conceived with David Breslin and Binocular Design, and Edward Kopp. Some favorite book projects include Trisha Brown: Dance and Art in Dialogue 1961–2001; C.C. Wang: Mind Landscapes; The Sensuous and the Sacred: Chola Bronzes from South India; Robert Motherwell Drawing: As Fast as the Mind Itself; Artists We’ve Known: Selections from the Walter Hopps and Caroline Huber Collection; and Ruth Asawa Through Line.\n\nDr. Corina (Cory) Rogge is the Director of Conservation at the Menil Collection. She earned a B.A. in chemistry from Bryn Mawr College, a Ph.D. in Chemistry from Yale University and held postdoctoral positions at the University of Wisconsin–Madison and the University of Texas Health Sciences Center (Houston). Before joining the Menil Collection in the summer of 2023 she served as the Andrew W. Mellon Research Scientist at the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston (2013-2023) and the Andrew W. Mellon Assistant Professor in Conservation Science in the Department of Art Conservation at State University of New York Buffalo State College (2010-2013). She is the Vice President and Fellow of the American Institute for Conservation and an Associate Editor for the Journal of the American Institute for Conservation. While much of her research focusses on 20th century artists, paints, and pigments and she is the principal author of Franz Kline: The Artist’s Materials, she works on materials across all cultures, media, and ages."
