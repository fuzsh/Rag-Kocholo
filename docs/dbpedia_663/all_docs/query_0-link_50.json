        "text": "This anthology examines the workings of historical imagery in fourteen essays, offering fresh perspectives from leading researchers on a central question for contemporary art history. Drawing on the results of an international conference held in Vienna in 2018, the authors approach images from the premodern period in terms of their fabrication, deployment, and reception. The focus lies on wide-ranging media— architecture, sculpture, painting, metalwork, stained glass—in similarly wide-ranging contexts: from monumental installations in the most public zones of urban churches to exquisite devotional objects and illuminated books reserved for more exclusive settings. This spectrum reflects the broad interests of the conference’s dedicatee, Michael Viktor Schwarz, whose introductory interview lays out the parameters of the subject."
