His paintings of nudes, landscapes and still lifes were very popular.\n\nAlong with many other artists of \"The Bridge\" his work was condemned by the Nazis as \"degenerate\" and nearly all of it destroyed.\n\nHowever he remained a very popular artist in his homeland and had many exhibitions and awards right up till his death.\n\nAs with all artists whose works regularly achieve high monetary values at auction, there is a need to be cautious and scrutinise its legitimacy and descriptors for errors and identify any historically incorrect attributions previously given that may need to be investigated and clarified. Because sometimes there are attributions that are deliberately devised to deceive.\n\nAny formal attribution should be examined very carefully indeed, if only to verify that the quality, academicism and indeed the accuracy of that assignment to that name, is well established and rightfully ascribed. Confirming that it is specifically accurate, correctly researched and a credible academic attribution is essential and it should always be kept in mind, that any attribution, no matter at what level of credibility or status it comes from, is still only an opinion that it might be by that artist.\n\nIt's a matter of personal interpretation and judgement as to how you view and respect it.\n\nThere are many differing levels of forgery that we encounter in our fine art authenticity and attribution investigations. Most common are those that are created with the addition of a fake signature or monogram, usually applied to an otherwise similar work of art to that of the artist it claims to be by.\n\nThe painting or drawing usually only has to be one of a comparable type, subject and of reasonable age to be passed off as an original, but one that was created by an anonymous follower. An artist who was only painting in the style of that artist.\n\nUnfortunately, this type of fraud has been going on in the art world for centuries and makes the task of investigating a given attribution or underpinning a work of arts authenticity, an involved and complex responsibility.\n\nTo help understand the generally observed and well accepted semantics that are used in auction descriptions, they are set out further down this page. They define exactly what the 'expert' view of the work being offered is and they also have a distinct bearing on the financial outcome.\n\n***\n\nÂ\n\nÂ As a specialist fine art consultancy conducting art authenticity and attribution investigations internationally, we have been confidentially serving both private individuals and corporate clients. People from all over the world and for well over 45 years from our bases in Europe, the UK and north America.Â\n\nIn so doing, we have investigated the authenticity of both single works of art and complete collections for clients. Conducted in-depth authentication and legitimacy investigations and directed full academic and forensic applications. Researching the origins of works of art, from different geographical regions, genres and from all eras.\n\nWe also scrutinize and conduct research necessary to verify the provenance and ownership lineage as a matter of due diligence.\n\nÂ\n\nÂ We are able to assist and advise you in all fine art related matters, particularly issues relating to the investigation of the legitimacy and attributions of German and European fine art, including the works of Erich Heckel, his circle and any other work of art that you need assistance or advice with.\n\nSome examples associated with that name appear below simply as comparative illustrations.\n\n*No inference is made, nor is it intended as to the question of their legitimacy here on this page. Moreover they are an across the board, representational view of the differing types of works of art that have, are, or may in the future be offered and advertised for sale at auction internationally in the public domain that you may need specialist advise on.\n\nÂ\n\nStep one in the Art Authentication and Attribution process.\n\nThe Pre-Authentication Assessment\n\nÂ Â\n\nÂ\n\nÂ We strongly advise clients before embarking on a full investigation of legitimacy or an artist or studio attribution inquiry, that it is always wise to engage us to undertake an impartial preliminary assessment conducted first. One made to balance any issues that may be present that could make the longer term exercise unviable.\n\nÂ This is a professional advisory service that we provide, based upon the images you supply, the full details of work of arts acquisition, its history and provenance as is known to you, along with sight of any documentation, previous research or analysis that you may have had formerly conducted on it. You should then have a far better understanding of both the prospects or any pitfalls we might face, before making a decision.\n\nThis is a logical and cost effective professional review and advisory for which there is a modest set fee.\n\nOur FAQ section covers this in more detail.\n\nFAQs\n\nCONTACT US\n\nCONTACTEZ NOUS\n\nÂ\n\nWe will respond to you promptly.\n\nÂ\n\nÂ\n\nÂ\n\nÂ\n\n* ABOUT A WORK OF ARTS DESCRIPTOR AND ITS TERMINOLOGY *\n\nAs if in this case as if they were defining the works of the artist;Â Â\n\nErich Heckel - German (1883-1970)\n\nÂ\n\nÂ\n\nÂ *It is very important to clearly understand the general auction terms that are widely used in a published descriptor and to be cautious of works that may just be created in the 'manner of' the artist, or those which could be variants of the artists works of art that 'bear an applied signature' or monogram.\n\nÂ Where the name, Erich Heckel - German (1883-1970)is given with the first name/s and surname of the artist, usually cited as, Erich Heckel including the dates to be specific, then in their qualified and professional opinion, they are in no doubt, it is a genuine and authentic item and one painted by that specific artist. This is usually fully qualified by its inclusion in any catalogue raissone, or by the guarantee of the opinion given by appropriate and internationally recognized expert authority on that artist.\n\nÂ When Erich Heckel - German (1883-1970)is the term used, or it is similarly defined as Attrib. to ' [abbreviated,] or Attribue, imputer Ã , imputÃ©e, or atribudo, or ascribed to, then in their opinion it is 'probably' a work by the artist, at least in part. But... there is no guarantee. It is only an opinion that it only 'possibly' may be by the artist.\n\nÂ But if the term Erich Heckel - German (1883-1970) - circle of, entourage, or âCircle of â Erich Heckel is specifically used, then in their opinion, it is a work only of the period of the artist, but showing their influence. Or by someone closely associated with the artist, BUT not necessarily by their pupil, assistant or student.\n\nÂ When the name is given thus; Painted in the âStyle of or âFollower of Erich Heckel - German (1883-1970) is used, this means that in their opinion it is a work of art executed only in the artistâs way, in their 'style', but not necessarily by a pupil. Yet it may be a contemporary, or nearly a contemporary of the artist.\n\nÂ If the phrase in the âManner of Erich Heckel is used or is definedâ¦.â then in their opinion it is also only a work painted in the style of the artist, but of a later date and definitely not by the artist as named.\n\nÂ When the term âAfterâ¦. \"; is the term used, then in their opinion it is a copy (made at any date) of an authentic and original work by the artist. This also applies to prints made 'after' an original work of art either by the artist or another artist/ printmaker.\n\nÂ Signed - Erich Heckel ; âDatedâ¦.â or âInscribed â Then in their opinion the work has been signed/dated/or inscribed by that specific artist. The addition of a question mark ? however, indicates a strong element of doubt.\n\nÂ When the term 'Bears signature', is used or the name, Erich Heckel is specified followed by the words; \"With signature â¦.â, or âWith date â¦.â or âWith ......inscriptionâ¦.â or âBears signature of Erich Heckel . / date / or inscriptionâ Then in 'their opinion,' either the signature / date / or inscription is spurious, apocryphal, of doubtful authenticity, forged and has been added by someone else other than the artist.\n\nÂ\n\nÂ\n\nWe can assist and advise you in all fine art related matters."
