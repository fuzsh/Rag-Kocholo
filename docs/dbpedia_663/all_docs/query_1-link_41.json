        "text": "(UPDATED Friday, Aug. 10, 2007)\n\nAUSTRALIA / MELBOURNE\n\nNATIONAL GALLERY OF VICTORIA -- To Oct. 7: \"Guggenheim Collection: 1940s to Now.\" On loan from the Guggenheim museums in New York (the principal lender), Venice, Bilbao and Berlin, a display of more than 85 works by 65 artists in a variety of media - painting, works on paper, sculpture, photography and new media. Ranging from \"the beautiful to the confronting,\" the show documents the evolution of western art with representative works from each decade: postwar figurations, Abstract Expressionism, Minimalism and Pop Art. Artists of the 21st century are also represented: Jeff Koons, Suling Wang and Olafur Eliasson, among others. The works also are arrayed so as to offer a meditation on today's global society, especially its political repression, wars and consumerism.-- www.ngv.vic.gov.au\n\nSYDNEY\n\nART GALLERY OF NEW SOUTH WALES -- To Sept. 23: \"The Arts of Islam: Treasures From the Nasser D. Khalili Collection.\" The Iranian-born scholar has assembled one of the world's largest collection of Islamic art -- about 20,000 items that span the 13 centuries since the birth of the religion. The ambitious exhibition brings together a selection of 350 artworks, including ceramics, painted glass objects, woven textiles and illuminated manuscripts. The show ends with 19th-century pocket watches and lacquer boxes that attest to a European influence in Islamic art at that time.-- www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au\n\nAUSTRIA / BREGENZ\n\nKUNSTHAUS BREGENZ -- To Sept. 9: \"Mythos: Joseph Beuys, Matthew Barney, Douglas Gordon, Cy Twombly.\" This is the second instalment of a two-part exhibition that explores the sources of art: objects and myths. In the first part, \"Re-object,\" Marcel Duchamp provided the basis for the artistic strategies of Damien Hirst, Jeff Koons and Gerhard Merz. In \"Mythos,\" Joseph Beuys is the curatorial basis for Barney, Gordon and Twombly. Each artist presents large-scale works, supposedly a concisely formulated work statement, and an exploration of the theme of death. -- www.kunsthaus-bregenz.at\n\nVIENNA\n\nALBERTINA -- To Aug. 26: \"Expressiv! Die Künstler der 'Brücke'.\" About 260 works by the members of \"Die Brücke,\" the German artistic movement founded in Dresden in 1905. The founders, Kirchner and Schmidt-Rottluf, and other European artists -- Pechstein, Gallen-Kallela and Van Dongen -- chose to depart from the old art establishment. The group was dissolved in 1913, but the stylistic similarities, such as distortion of the subject and strong colors, survived in Expressionist works of Munch, Soutine, and Kokoschka, among others. -- www.albertina.at\n\n-- To Aug. 29: \"Desert Dreaming: Australian Aboriginal Art.\" The American philanthropist and collector Donald Kahn, a patron of the Albertina, was one of the first to discover the aesthetic diversity and fascination of Australian Aboriginal art and, in the 1980s, to start a large-scale collection of Aboriginal art. About 35 large-format pictures from this collection are on show. -- www.albertina.at\n\nKUNSTHALLE WIEN -- To Sept. 2: \"Chen Zhen: Der Körper als Landschaft.\" \"I don't play with incomprehension: I try to create it,\" Chen once said. One of the many artists who left post-Mao China in the 1980s, Chen (1955-2000) settled in Paris where his installations received prompt acclaim. Centered around \"Jue Chang, Dancing Body,\" a 2000 interactive installation of chairs and beds assembled into a gigantic percussion instrument, the exhibition offers photographs, sculptures and installations created in the 10 years leading to the artist's death. Using the human body, illness and Chinese medical practices as metaphors, they document Chen's attempt at structuring his own identity within the frame of conflicting Eastern and Western cultural models. -- www.kunsthallewien.at\n\nOBERES BELVEDERE -- To Oct. 2: \"Gustav Klimt und die Maler-Compagnie.\" With his brother Ernst and Franz Matsch, Klimt (1862-1918) founded the Artists' Company in 1883: It carried out commissions for the decoration of homes and theaters, a lucrative occupation in a booming Vienna. Ernst died in 1892 and Klimt distanced himself from the conventional Matsch to found the Viennese Secession. The museum is offering a selection of ceiling paintings, curtains and easel works by the three painters, as well as paintings by a couple of other artists. -- www.belvedere.at\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
