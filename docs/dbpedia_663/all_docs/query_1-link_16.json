See LÃ©on Rosenthal, La Peinture romantique. Essai sur l'Ã©volution de la peinture franÃ§aise de 1815 Ã 1830 (Paris: L. Henry May, 1900), p. 305.\n\nHappily, since the present article was written (2001) and published (2003), several excellent works on the Nazarenes have appeared in English: Mitchell Benjamin Frank, German Romantic Painting Redefined: Nazarene Tradition and the Narratives of Romanticism (Aldershot, England: Ashgate, December 2001); Cordula Grewe, Painting the Sacred in the Age of Romanticism (Farnham, England: Ashgate, 2009) and the same authorâs The Nazarenes: Romantic Avant-garde and the Art of the Concept (University Park, PA: Pennsylvania State University Press, 2015), and--less well known because accessible only online--Charles Davis, Auf den Spuren der Nazarener: Re-reading Vittoria Caldoni. Friedrich Overbeckâs Portrait in the Neue Pinakothek on a Heidelberg University site. In addition a substantial chapter (pp. 35-90) is devoted to the Nazarenes in Albert Boimeâs Art in an Age of Counter-Revolution (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2004).\n\n2On Jacob Burckhardt's concept of the \"Existenzbild,\" see Lionel Gossman, \"The Existenzbild in Burckhardt's Art-Historical Writing,\" MLN 114 (1999), pp. 878â929; Lionel Gossman, Basel in the Age of Burckhardt: A Study in Unseasonable Ideas (Chicago: Chicago University Press, 2000), pp. 375â81. The Venetians had proclaimed that the production of pleasure was the chief object of painting and that even its moral and religious effect derived from that source (Luzio Dolci, Dialogo della pittura, 1557). To Sperone Speroni (Dialoghi, 1558), who was himself portrayed by the master, Titian's painting representedÂ \"il paradiso del corpo\"; see Daniel Arasse, \"Le Corps fictif de SÃ©bastien et le coup d'oeil d'Antonello,\" in Claude Reichler ed., Le Corps et ses fictions (Paris: Editions de Minuit, 1983), pp. 55â72.\n\n3Â The term \"Primitives\" was rare at the beginning of the nineteenth century. In French writing on art, \"gothique\" was used to convey a pejorative judgment, while \"naÃ¯f\" conveyed a more neutral or even positive judgment. In German writing, the favored terms were \"altdeutsch,\"Â \"altniederlÃ¤ndisch,\" etc. The term \"Primitives\"Â was applied first to Italian art and only later to French or Flemish art. See Suzanne Sulzberger, La RÃ©habilitation des Primitifs Flamands 1802-1867 (Brussels: Palais des AcadÃ©mies, 1961), pp. 14â16 (AcadÃ©mie Royale de Belgique, Classe des Beaux-Arts. MÃ©moires, XIII, 3.) See also note 100 below.\n\n5 See Leonore Koschuik, \"Franz Kugler (1808â1858) als Kunsthistoriker und Kunstpolitiker\" (Ph.D. diss., Freie UniversitÃ¤t Berlin, 1985), pp. 121â35; Jacob Burckhardt, \"Bericht Ã¼ber die Kunstausstellung zu Berlin im Herbst 1842,\" Kunstblatt, 12 January 1843; Jacob Burckhardt, \"Overbeck (Friedr.),\" in the Brockhaus Conversations-Lexikon (Leipzig: F.A.

Jean de Mot (Brussels: Misch et Thron, 1904), pp. 12â23. The original German text was unfortunately not available to me. (All translations from French and German are by the present author, unless otherwise indicated.)\n\n7 For a brief overview of their influence on the Italian \"Puristi,\"Â the students of Ingres in France, and the English Pre-Raphaelites, see Herbert Schindler, Die Nazarener: romantischer Geist und christliche Kunst im 19. Jahrhundert (Regensburg: Verlag Friedrich Pustet, 1982), pp. 68â72. On the Nazarene influence in Italy, England, and France respectively, see the contributions by GÃ¼nther Metken and Henri Dorra in Die Nazarener, exh. cat., ed. Klaus Gallwitz (Frankfurt a. M.: StÃ¤dtische Galerie im StÃ¤delschen Institut, 1977), pp. 327â36 (Metken), 355â64 (Metken), 337â54 (Dorra).\n\n9 The full title is: De la poÃ©sie chrÃ©tienne dans son principe, dans sa matiÃ¨re et dans ses formes. Formes de l'art. Peinture (Paris: DebÃ©court, 1834). The second volume, published in 1851, bore the revised title: De l'art chrÃ©tien (Paris: A. Bray). An English translation appeared as The Poetry of Christian Art (London: T. Bosworth, 1854). A new and revised edition in 4 volumes was published by Hachette in 1861â67 and reprinted in 1874.\n\n10 Quoted in Dorra 1975, p.137. See also Daniel Ternois, âLe PrÃ©raphaÃ©lisme franÃ§ais,â in his 1993 edition of Amaury-Duval, LâAtelier dâIngres, p. 388. On the growing vogue of the Nazarenes in liberal Catholic circles, see Callort 1983, p. 59.\n\n11 Charles-RenÃ© Forbes, Comte de Montalembert, \"Du Vandalisme en France: lettre Ã M. Victor Hugo,\" Revue des Deux Mondes, 2d ser., 1 (1833), pp. 421â68, quote on p. 425.\n\n12 See Sigrid Metken, \"Nazarener und 'nazarenisch' âPopularisierung und Trivialisierung eines Kunstideals,\" in Die Nazarener 1977, pp. 365â88, quote on p. 373; see also Jens Christian Jensen, \"Bemerkungen zu Friedrich Overbeck,\" in Andreas BlÃ¼hm and Gerhard Gerkens eds., Johann Friedrich Overbeck 1789-1869, exh. cat. (LÃ¼beck: Museen fÃ¼r Kunst und Kulturgeschichte, 1989), pp. 12-19, quote on p. 13.\n\n13 Lutezia: Berichte Ã¼ber Politik, Kunst und Volksleben 35, 19 May 1841, in Heinrich Heine, SÃ¤mtliche Werke, 12 vols., ed. Paul Beyer et al. (Leipzig: Hesse & Becker, n. d.), 10.141. Heine, as one might expect, did not much appreciate the Nazarenes. Christian material, he objected, did not have to be represented in spindly contours and as \"abgehÃ¤rmt und farblos\" as possible; see Lutezia 43, ibid., p. 166.\n\n14 Ingres's student was EugÃ¨ne Emmanuel Amaury-Duval; the passage quoted is from his review, \"L'Exposition du Bazar Bonne Nouvelle en 1846,\" Revue Nouvelle 7 (February 1846), pp. 77â94, and is reprinted in Ternois 1993, pp. 410â15, quote on p. 412. In the final version, this was modified to read that France should be proud to be able to \"opposer un grand nom franÃ§ais aux Overbeck et aux Cornelius\" (p. 415). Likewise, Gautier praised Ingres for having found \"ce que cherchait si laborieusement Overbeck\" in his Christ with the Doctors of the Church; see the Moniteur universel, 10 April 1862, quoted in ThÃ©ophile Gautier, Correspondance gÃ©nÃ©rale, 12 vols., ed. Claudine Lacoste-Veysseyre (Geneva: Droz, 1985â2000), 8.29. Gautier devoted four articles in the <>feuilleton section of the Moniteur universel (10 and 12 August, 6 and 13 September 1854) to \"L'Ecole moderne allemande.\"Â Though by no means uncritical of what he saw as its idealistic and intellectual character and its indifference to sensuous nature, Gautier seems to have accepted the art of the Nazarenes as a model against which French religious artâthat of Ingres, Chenavard, Lehmann, and his friend Gabriel Tyrâmight be measured. Thus Lehmann's vision of Italy \"n'est pas moins poÃ©tique que celle de M. Overbeck dans le cÃ©lÃ¨bre tableau de ce maÃ®treÂ Ã la pinacothÃ¨que moderne de Munich\" [that is, Overbeck's Italia and Germania] (Moniteur universel, 10 June 1864, quoted in Correspondance gÃ©nÃ©rale, 8.463), while Tyr, \"une espÃ¨ce d'Overbeck franÃ§ais\" (Moniteur universel, 8 November 1855, in Correspondance gÃ©nÃ©rale, 6.126), is said to have understood and appropriated \"bien mieux et plus profondÃ©ment qu'Overbeckâ¦la naÃ¯ve poÃ©sie des peintres primitifs\" (Moniteur universel, 24 February 1868, quoted in Correspondance gÃ©nÃ©rale, 10.45â46). Commenting on Baudelaire's attacks on \"l'Ã©cole nÃ©o-chrÃ©tienne d'Overbeck\" (see \"Salon de 1846\" in Charles Baudelaire, CuriositÃ©s esthÃ©tiques: L'Art romantique; et autres oeuvres critiques, ed. Henri LemaÃ®tre [Paris: Garnier, 1962], pp. 170â71) and in general on \"l'erreur de l'art philosophique\"ârejected by Baudelaire as \"un retour vers l'imagerie nÃ©cessaire Ã Â l'enfance des peuples,\" and a misguided attempt to \"rivaliser avec l'imprimerie pour enseigner l'histoire, la morale et la philosophie\"(\"L'Art philosophique,\" ibid., pp. 504â05)âHenri LemaÃ®tre explains that \"l'Ã©cole allemande suscita un grand intÃ©rÃªt en France Ã l'Ã©poque de Baudelaire\" (ibid., p. 37). In fact, Baudelaire conceded that the \"philosophical\" artistsÂ \"dessinent trÃ¨s bien, trÃ¨s spirituellement\" and occasionally display great talent \"dans un genre faux,\" so that he was sometimes forced to admire them despite his conviction that they were \"hÃ©rÃ©tiques,\" unfaithful to the true vocation of art (ibid., p. 512).\n\n15 Quoted in Quentin Bell, Victorian Artists (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1967), pp. 15â16.\n\n16 \"The great Overbeck, that prince of Christian paintersâ¦.\"Â Augustus Welby Pugin, Contrasts, or A parallel between the Noble Edifices of the Middle Ages and Corresponding Buildings of the Present Day, shewing the Present Decay of Taste (London: Charles Dolman, 1841), p. 18. In a footnote, Pugin recommended that \"all those who are interested in the revival of Christian art should prepare engravings from the work of this great artist.\" On Overbeck's influence on Pugin's drawing and decoration, see Phoebe Stanton, Pugin (London: Thames and Hudson, 1971), p. 140.\n\n17. William Vaughan, German Romanticism and English Art (New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1979), p. 21.\n\n18 Ruskin was a notable exception with his claim that there was nothing of artistic value in the \"muddy struggles of the unhappy Germans.\"Â John Ruskin, Modern Painters, in Complete Works of John Ruskin, 39 vols., ed. E.T. Cook and Alexander Wedderburn (London: George Allen, 1903â1912), 3.350. They lack not only \"mechanical means and technical knowledge\" (ibid.) but insight and imagination, with the result that Overbeck, for one, \"degrades the subjects he intends to honour.\" Modern Painters, in Complete Works, 5.50. In \"Notes on German Galleries\" (1859), a Virgin by Overbeck in Cologne Cathedral is judged \"execrable beyond all contempt\" and an obvious plagiarism of a Titian. Complete Works 7.488. The model for the Jacob and Rachel of Naecke and FÃ¼hrich, which in turn inspired Dyce, was probably the painting by Palma Vecchio in the Staatliche Kunstsammlungen, Dresden.\n\n19 David Brown, Sir Charles Eastlake and the Victorian Art World (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1978); Marcia Pointon, William Dyce 1806â1864.

See also on Ruskin and the Nazarenes, pp. 237, 277. It is noteworthy that Overbeckâs widow selected Margaret Howitt (1839-1930), the daughter of the prolific English writer Mary Howitt (1799-1888)and herself the author of a memoir (London, 1866) of her friendship with the notable Swedish woman novelist and feminist reformer Fredrika Bremer, as well as the editor of her motherâs autobiography (1889), to write a biography of Overbeck and that the text was originally composed in English and intended for publication in Great Britain. In the end, it appeared in German translation as Friedrich Overbeck: sein Leben und Schaffen: nach seinen Briefen und andern Documenten des handschriftlichen Nachlasses, 2 vols. (Freiburg im Breisgau: Herder, 1886).\n\n23. George Eliot had already encountered the Nazarenes on her visits to Germany in 1854 and 1858. In the novel, Naumann is said to have projected a work to be entitled \"Saints Drawing the Car of the Church\"Â â probably an ironical reference to Overbeck's celebrated, but also much criticized The Triumph of Religion in Art (1833â40). See Hugh Witemeyer, \"George Eliot, Naumann and the Nazarenes,\" Victorian Studies 18 (1974), pp. 145â58.\n\n25 Kurt Karl Eberlein, Caspar David Friedrich, der Landschaftsmaler: Ein Volksbuch Deutscher Kunst (Bielefeld and Leipzig: Velhagen und Klasing, 1939), p. 6: \"Es gab weibisch-feige Romantiker, die in das Universale und Internationale flohen, kurz gesagt: Literaten; und es gab mÃ¤nnlich-tapfere Romantiker, die in das Nationale und Deutsche stÃ¼rmten, kurz gesagt: KÃ¼nstler.\" This \"true German\" romanticism is \"deutsche Kampfkunst, ist Opferkunst.\" What Eberlein admired in Friedrich and the Northern romantics was \"Lichtliebe, Steinliebe, Grabliebeâ¦Naturkult,\" together with a \"Greek\" element:Â \"kÃ¤mpferisches Wesen,â¦Untergangswillen,â¦Schicksals- und Todesliebe\" (p. 2).\n\nâThere were timid, womanish Romantics, who fled to the Universal and the International, in short â literary types; and there were manly and bold Romantics, who fought their way to the National and the German, in short â artists.â This âtrue Germanâ Romanticism is a âGerman art of struggle, an art of sacrifice.â What Eberlein admired in Friedrich and the Northern Romantics was âlove of light, of stone, of the grave, the cult of nature,â along with a âGreekâ element: âa deep combative nature,. . .a drive to doom and destructionâ¦a love of fate and deathâ (p. 2). It would have been impossible for Eberlein to find those features in the work of the Nazarenes.\n\n26 On Schlegel's rejection of a new romantic mythology and on the difference between the Northern romantics (Novalis, Runge, Friedrich) and the Nazarenes in this regard, see KÃ¤the Brodnitz, Nazarener und Romantiker: Eine Studie zu Friedrich Overbeck (Berlin: Emil Ebering, 1914), pp. 31â33.\n\n27 Pierre Cabanne, L'Art du XIXÃ¨me siÃ¨cle (Paris: Somargy, 1989), p. 86.\n\n28 Caspar David Friedrich in Briefen und Bekenntnissen, ed. Sigrid Hinz (Berlin: Henschel, 1968), p. 85. Likewise, on pp. 113â14: âSollte denn das wohl der hochgepriesene Kunstsinn unserer Zeit sein, sich in knechtischer NachÃ¤ffung einer frÃ¼heren, wenngleich schÃ¶nen Kunstzeit zu gefallenâ¦Ist es aber nicht, wenn wir aufrichtig sein wollen, etwas Widriges, ja oft Ekelhaftes, vertrocknete Marien mit einem verhungerten Jesuskind im Arme zu sehen, und mit papierenen GewÃ¤ndern bekleidet. Oft auch wohl mit Absicht verzeichnet und geflissentlich VerstÃ¶sse gegen die Linien- und Luftperspkective gemacht? Alle Fehler jener ZeitÂ Ã¤fft man tÃ¤uschend nach, aber das Gute jener Bildwerke, das tiefe, fromme, kindliche GemÃ¼t, was diese Bilder so eigentlich beseelt, lÃ¤sst sich freilich nicht mit den Fingern nachahmenâ¦Was unsere Vorfahren in kindlicher Einfalt taten, das dÃ¼rfen wir bei besserer Erkenntnis nicht mehr tun.â\n\nLikewise, Friedrich Theodor Vischer, on the romantic school, in his review of Overbeck's Triumph of Religion:Â \"Ein neues Mittelalter trat auf, aber kein wirkliches, ein in einem fremdartigen Geiste, dem modernen, reflectirtes, kÃ¼nstliches Mittelalter.\" Deutsche JahrbÃ¼cher fÃ¼r Wissenschaft und Kunst 31 (6 August 1841), p. 123. As for Overbeck's madonna, she has none of the naivetÃ©Â of early Italian art: \"Ja, sie ist schÃ¶n, diese Madonna, diese reine Taube sonder Galle. Und dochâes ist etwas darin, ich weiss nicht was, etwas Almanach, etwas Vielliebchen und Vergissmeinnicht. Es ist ein Zug der in allen neueren Madonnen unverkennbar ist: man sieht ihnen eben eine Zeit an, wo es StammbÃ¼cher, viele Spiegel, Modejournal und Titelkupfer von TaschenbÃ¼chern giebt. Wie soll es auch anders mÃ¶glich sein! Wie kann ein Mensch seine Zeit verlÃ¤ugnen!â¦Nein, Eure Madonnen sind nicht Madonnen der alten Kirche: sie haben in den Stunden der Andacht gelesen, sie sind in einer Pension, in einer TÃ¶chterschule aufgewachsenâ¦ja sie trinken Thee, wenig, aber etwas.\" Deutsche JahrbÃ¼cher fÃ¼r Wissenschaft und Kunst 32 (7 August 1841):Â 126. The point was repeated succinctly at the end of the century by Cornelius Gurlitt (1900, p. 222): \"Man wollte nicht einsehen, wie gewaltig sich die LebensverhÃ¤ltnisse geÃ¤ndert hatten.\"\n\nIs the much praised feeling for art of our time to be a pleasure in slavish imitation of an earlier, albeit beautiful age of art?. . .If we are to be forthright and honest, is there not something repellent, often quite wretched in the sight of dessicated Marys clad in paper draperies and holding starveling Jesuses in their arms? Often deliberately represented in this manner, with deliberate violations of linear and spatial perspective. Every error of that time is aped so as to deceive the viewer, but what is good about the early artworks, their deep, pious, childlike spirit, the element that so distinctively animates them, cannot in fact be imitated with the finger. . . Because of our greater knowledge we may no longer do what our forefather did with childlike naivety.\n\nLikewise, Friedrich Theodor Vischer, on the Romantic School, in his review of Overbeck's Triumph of Religion: âA new Middle Ages emerged, but not an authentic one, a calculated artful Middle Ages produced by an alien modern spirit.â Deutsche JahrbuÌcher fuÌr Wissenschaft und Kunst 31 (6 August 1841), p. 123. As for Overbeck's madonna, she has none of the naivetÃ© of early Italian art: âYes, she is beautiful, this Madonna, this pure dove, totally without gall. And yet, there is something there, I donât know what it is, something reminiscent of calendar art and forget-me-nots, something ever so sweet and friendly. Itâs a trait one recognizes in every modern Madonna; they all have the look of an age of family albums, mirrors, fashion magazines and pocket book frontispieces. How could it be otherwise! How can anyone escape his or her own time!. . .No, your madonnas are not the madonnas of the early church. They have read our books of prayer and edification, they grew up in boarding schools for children and young people. . , and yes, they drink tea, not too much, but some.â(Deutsche JahrbuÌcher fuÌr Wissenschaft und Kunst 32 (7 August 1841): 126.

Likewise, Gurlitt (1900, p. 219) held that the painstaking efforts at fresco of the Nazarenes are in such stark contrast with the free and lively handling of this technique by the Tiepolos (Giovanni Battista and his son Giovanni Domenico) that if they were all to be rediscovered in an archaeological dig, the researcher would find it impossible to believe the Nazarenes came later: \"Es ist fÃ¼r den Nachlebenden ganz ausserordentlich schwer, bei den Unbeholfenheiten nicht zu lÃ¤cheln.\"Â (âIt is extraordinarily hard for a later generation not to smile when confronted with such ineptitude.â) For an illuminating account of the marginalization of the Nazarenes in nineteenth- and twentieth-century Germany and the identification of the Northern German romantic school (Runge, Friedrich) with authentic German romanticism, see Mitchell Benjamin Frank, German Romantic Painting Redefined: Nazarene Tradition and the Narratives of Romanticism (Aldershot, England and Burlington, VT: Ashgate, 2001).

Jansen, 19th-Century Art (New York: Harry Abrams, 1984), Preface and Acknowledgments. The critique of art histories written from the perspective of a triumphant modernism is probably not unrelated to the suspicion with which all \"metahistories\"Â (Jean-FranÃ§ois Lyotard) have come to be regarded.\n\n39 Michel Laclotte notes in La Peinture allemande Ã l'Ã©poque du Romantisme (exh. cat., Orangerie des Tuileries, Paris [Paris: Editions des musÃ©es nationaux, 1976], 1976â77, p. ix) that \"l'histoire de l'art est faiteâ¦d'incessantes rÃ©surrections et remises en cause. La premiÃ¨re moitiÃ© du XIXÃ¨me siÃ¨cle allemand en offre un spectaculaire exemple. Ses hÃ©ros, Friedrich et Runge, ne furent-ils pas totalement oubliÃ©s jusqu'au dÃ©but de notre siÃ¨cle et n'assistons-nous pas aujourd'hui en revanche au juste retour des NazarÃ©ens, longtemps encensÃ©s puis misÂ Ã l'index Ã leur tour?\" (âThe history of art is made up of repeated revivals and challenges. The first half of the nineteenth century in Germany offers a spectacular example of this. Were not its heroes, Friedrich and Runge, completely forgotten until the beginning of our own century and are we not now witnessing the -- perfectly justified -- return of the Nazarenes, who were long idolized and then placed in their turn on the index?â)\n\n40 The National Gallery in London acquired a Schnorr von Carolsfeld (Ruth in Boaz's Field, 1828) in 1998; the J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York both acquired canvases by Caspar David Friedrich in the 1980s and 1990s. Though the National Gallery in Washington, D.C. obtained a large number of prints by Ferdinand Olivier through the Rosenwald Collection in 1950, active acquisition of prints and drawings (by Cornelius, Pforr, Overbeck, and Schnorr von Carolsfeld) has occurred only since the 1980s and 1990s. In England, the Queen's collection contains a number of Nazarene works, largely as a result of Prince Albert's interest, as does the British Museum. In the United States, the most substantial public collections of nineteenth-century German art appear to be the Frye Collection in Seattle (acquired by Charles Frye, the son of a German immigrant, from the estate of Josef Stransky, a conductor of the New York Philharmonic and a collector of German art, in the second or third decade of the twentieth century), the RenÃ©e von Schleinitz Collection at the Milwaukee Art Center, and, for drawings and prints, the collection bequeathed to Harvard University by John Witt Randall of the class of 1834, now in the Fogg Museum. However, there was no direct purchasing of German romantic prints and drawings by the Fogg until 1985.\n\n42 Robert Rosenblum, Modern Painting and the Northern Romantic Tradition: Friedrich to Rothko (New York: Harper and Row, 1975).\n\n43 In similar vein, see Sarah Kent's review of the 2001 exhibition at the National Gallery in London in the British weekly Time Out (28 Februaryâ7 March 2001, pp. 20â21): \"German painters like Adolph von Menzel blasted a path for French Impressionists like Degasâyet hardly anyone knows anything about them\"; the \"robust images\"Â of Wilhelm TrÃ¼bner and Hans Thoma may \"lack the charm that often takes French Impressionism perilously close to sentimentality,\" butÂ \"it's possible that this show will provoke a radical reappraisal of the merits of German over French Impressionism.\"\n\n44 Schmoll noted that the basic idea of the exhibition can be traced to Meier-Graefe himself. Since, as a champion of modern French art, he was looked on as an enemy in the circles of Wilhelm II, however, he agreed to remain in the background behind the museum directors Hugo von Tschudi (Berlin) and Alfred Lichtwark (Hamburg). \"Meier-Graefe Ã¼bernahm jedoch in Wahrheit die Hauptlast der Auswahl und der Katalogbearbeitung, auf dessen Titelblatt er aber um der Sache willen nicht erscheinen durfteâ¦Aber die Meier-Graefesche Linie einer Entwicklung auch der deutschen Malerei, die schlussendlich zum Impressionismus hinfÃ¼hrt, war deutlich herausgearbeitet.\"Â (âIn fact, Meier-Graefe assumed principal responsibility for the selection of works and the preparation of the catalogue, on the title page of which, however, given the character of the exhibition, his name does not appear. Nevertheless, Meier-Graefeâs line of a development leading ultimately to Impressionism, in German painting also, was clearly set forth.â) Josef Adolf Schmoll, \"Deutsche Malerei des 19. Jahrhunderts in heutiger Sicht,\" Anzeiger des Germanischen Nationalmuseums, 1978, p. 127. The descriptions of individual paintings in the catalogue focus in fact strikingly on color and painterly qualities.\n\n45 See, for instance, Paul Friedrich Schmidt, Biedermeier-Malerei (Munich: Delphin-Verlag, 1923), pp. 83â85:\n\nâEverywhere in Germany, around 1830, there was a turn, in visual perception, toward the purely painterly. This cannot be described as anything less than an anticipation of early Impressionism. That a form of visual perception corresponding to the nineteenth-century materialist view of the world had to come is beyond doubt. Thanks to their brilliant gift for sharp formulations and the concentration of talent in Paris, the French were able to conceptualize the new way of seeing and present it to the world as Impressionism. But it was the Germans who discovered it thirty years earlier.â\n\nThus it was by taking over German ideas, Schmidt alleged, fitting them out with slogans, and presenting them as they would the latest fashions, that the French acquired the undeserved reputation of being pathbreakers in art and literature in the nineteenth century, whereas \"even in places where the possibility of creating a tradition existed, such as Dresden or Munich, the Germans never knew what to do with the golden seed they had discovered. They remain the pioneers of the materialist principle, in painting as in other areas, for together with Constableâbut more radically than heâthey were the first to capture light and atmosphere and to achieve a purely optical representation of surfaces.\" And in a somewhat similar vein, Hans Weigert, Geschichte der deutschen Kunst (Berlin: PropylÃ¤er Verlag, 1942), p. 496:\n\nâWhereas impressionism entered Germanyâwhere Adolf Menzel had been overtaken by the idealism of the DeutschrÃ¶mer [i.e. Anselm Feuerbach and Hans von MarÃ©esâL.G.] and by the efforts of Wilhelm Leibl and his circle to capture the totality of the objectâwith great suddenness and revolutionary pronouncements, it developed in France gradually and continuously. Here we observe, as in the sculpture of the Gothic cathedrals, the capacity of the French to build on previous work and to transmit tasks from one generation to the next.â\n\n46 A distressingly common view often presented in seemingly non-ideological, purely factual guise. Here, for example, is an art historian writing about the painter Friedrich Wasmann: \"Wasmann's example demonstrates how native talents can develop in the German with great success, despite counteractive training, when he is isolated in some remote corner of the country. Our strength, unlike that of the French, does not lie in belonging to a school.\"Â (Schmidt 1923, p. 44).\n\n47 Holland Cotter, \"Ach, Such Industrious Romantics,\" New York Times, 15 June 2001. In 1978, a German scholar, arguing that German painting of the first half of the nineteenth century, especially that of early romanticism (notably Caspar David Friedrich), was at last winning international recognition, conceded that there is still much disagreement about \"an adequate appreciation of the Nazarenes.\" See Schmoll 1978, pp. 127â34, quote on p. 133. In 1989, another German scholar made the same observation: there was renewed interest in Runge, Friedrich, Menzel, Hans von MarÃ©es, Anselm Feuerbach, but not in Friedrich Overbeck. See Jens Christian Jensen, \"Bemerkungen zu Friedrich Overbeck,\"Â in BlÃ¼hm and Gerkens eds. 1989, p. 12. By 1999, nothing had apparently changed. According to Brigitte Heise, the ranks of German romantic painters are filled, in the minds of today's viewers, by the names of Caspar David Friedrich and Philipp Otto Runge. But in their own time, in contrast to Overbeck, they were hardly known to a broad general public. Overbeck's fame had certainly faded, Heise concedes, by the end of his long life. But in the first four decades of the nineteenth century, she argues, he was central to all theoretical discussion of art. Today, however, the non-professional viewer has little familiarity with or access to Overbeck's work. \"Ein Blick auf die Geschichte der Rezeption Overbecks im Rahmen musealer PrÃ¤sentation des 20. Jahrhunderts wirft ein deutliches Licht auf die Tatsache, dass selbst die Fachleute sich schwer taten mit der Vermittlung des Werkes eines so bekannten KÃ¼nstlersâ¦Bei jeder Ausstellung der Werke Overbecks und in den begleitenden Publikationen klingt an, dass es zur 'Ehrenrettung' des KÃ¼nstlers geschehe, dass sein Werk in seiner eigentlichen Bedeutung wieder in das Bewusstsein derÂ Ãffentlichkeit gerÃ¼ckt werden mÃ¼sse.\" (âA glance at the reception history of Overbeckâs work in the context of 20th century museum presentations makes it abundantly clear that even professionals had a hard time communicating the work of such a well known artist to the public . . . In every exhibition of Overbeckâs work, as in all the accompanying publications, the same note is struck: namely that the artistâs reputation has to be rescued, that his work, in its distinctive meaning, has to be restored to the consciousness of the public.â) Brigitte Heise, Johann Friedrich Overbeck: Das kÃ¼nstlerische Werk und seine literarischen und autobiographischen Quellen (Cologne, Weimar, Vienna: BÃ¶hlau, 1999), p. I.\n\n48 In the case of Overbeck, Heise (1999, p. 3) has summarized deftly and with understanding the obstacles that make it difficult for the ordinary modern viewer to appreciate his art. \"Die Kunst Overbecks ist entstanden aus tiefer, christlicher Ãberzeugung und auf der Grundlage streng gelebten katholischen Glaubens, in einer Haltung also, die heuteâ¦schwer nachzuvollziehen ist. Damit wird das Werk als Ã¼berholt oder nicht tradierenswert beurteiltâ¦.Seit dem Realismus und Impressionismus haben sich die Sehgewohnheiten des Betrachters entschieden verÃ¤ndert. Eine Kunst wie die Overbecks, die vor allem den Bildinhalt in den Mittelpunkt rÃ¼cktâ¦ist dem heutigen Betrachter fremd gewordenâ¦. Der Betrachter erwartet von einem Werk der Malerei Genuss und sinnlichen Reiz, keine Erbauung und Erweckungâ¦. Die bildnerischen Mittel, mit denen der Maler die christlichen Inhalte seiner Werke formt, basieren auf einemÂ Ãsthetikbegriff , der ohne kunsthistorische und philosophische Quellen in seiner eigentlichen Bedeutung nicht erfahrbar ist. Ohne diese Grundlagen erscheinen die GemÃ¤lde dem Betrachter oft steril, unsinnlich und ohne technische Bravourâ¦. Overbecks GemÃ¤lde und Zeichnungen sind durch Reproduktionstechniken vielfach popularisiert und trivialisiert worden. Sie wurden zum Teil zu frÃ¶mmelnden Heiligenbildernâ¦verunstaltet, die dem ursprÃ¼nglichen Werk nicht mehr entsprechenâ¦So wird das Urteil 'Kitsch' eilfertig auf das originale Werk Ã¼bertragenâ¦. Dem heutigen Betrachter, der mit romantischer Kunst in erster Linie die Landschaftsmalerei verbindet, erscheint Overbeck als Vertreter der religiÃ¶sen Figurenmalerei oft als ein rÃ¼ckwÃ¤rtsgewandter Aussenseiter. Nicht gesehen wird, dass in seinem Werk wesentliche Aspekte der Geistesgeschichte seiner Zeit manifestieren.\"\n\nâOverbeckâs art grew out of strong Christian conviction and rested on a foundation of deeply experienced Catholic faith. It was thus grounded in an outlook that is hard to replicate fully today. Because of that his work is judged obsolete or not worth integrating into a living traditionâ¦Since Realism and Impressionism the visual habits and expectations of the viewer have been decisively altered. An art like that of Overbeck which places a pictureâs content at its centre . . . has become quite alien to the modern viewer. . . The viewer expects painting to provide enjoyment and sensuous pleasure, not edification and intellectual or spiritual awakening. . . The pictorial means the painter employs to form the Christian contents of his work are based on an aesthetic, the distinctive character of which cannot be understood or experienced without knowledge of its art-historical and philosophical sources. The paintings thus often appeared to the viewer lacking that foundational knowledge as sterile, meaningless and lacking all technical bravura. . .Overbeckâs paintings and graphic art were widely popularised and trivialised thanks to developments in the technology of reproduction. In some measure they were transformed into popular devotional images that no longer corresponded to the original works. . .And so it came about that the term âkitschâ was over-hastily applied to the original works. . .To the contemporary viewer who associates Romantic art first and foremost with landscape painting, Overbeck, as a leading representative of religious figure painting, often seems like a backwards-looking outsider. It is overlooked that his work expresses and displays essential aspects of the cultural and intellectual history of his time.â\n\n49 See the catalogue entry in BlÃ¼hm and Gerkens eds. 1989, p. 126:Â \"Jede emotionale Beteiligung, jede Spannung und Bewegung, wie sie etwa bei Tizian und Correggio einfliessen, werden hier bewusst vermieden. Der formstrenge Aufbau und die betonte LinearitÃ¤t, die zeichenhafte Auffassung Christi und die zurÃ¼ckhaltende Farbgebung lassen das Werk in seiner idealtypisch formulierten Bildsprache als ein Hauptwerk des Meisters ansehen.\" (All emotional investment, all tension and movement, such as flow into the work of Titian and Correggio, are here sedulously avoided. Thanks to the strongly formal composition, the prominent linearity, the predominantly graphic representation of Christ and the restrained color tones, the work can be considered, in its ideal-typical pictorial language, one of the artistâs masterpieces.â) Overbeck's work shows some affinity with the Martin Schongauer version of the theme (Fig. 22), though compared to a drawing by his friend Joseph Anton Ramboux (Fig. 20), which is vividly evocative of late fifteenth- and early sixteenth-century German art, Overbeck's treatment is distinctly and typically more Raphaelesque.\n\n50 Herbert Lehr, Die BlÃ¼tezeit Romantischer Bildkunst: Franz Pforr der Meister des Lukasbundes (Marburg an der Lahn: Verlag des kunstgeschichtlichen Seminars, 1924), p. 38; Sabine Fastert, Die Entdeckung des Mittelalters.

Later German painters, including the \"DeutschrÃ¶mer\"âFeuerbach, BÃ¶cklin, MarÃ©esâlearned from the French and, to some extent, the Belgians a different approach to paint. Thus Feuerbach wrote: \"Nicht genug danken kann ich dem Meister [Couture], welcher mich von der deutschen Sptizpinselei zu breiter, pastoser Behandlung, von der akademischen Schablonenkomposition zu grosser Anschaffung und Auffassung fÃ¼hrte.\" (âI cannot thank the master [Couture] enough, who led me from the German habit of using the brush for sharp outlines to a broader, impasto style, from the outline design of the academies to grander conception and handling.â) Reported in Heinrich WÃ¶lfflin, Kunstgeschichte des 19.

According to MÃ¤hl (p. 290), it is unmistakable,\n\nâdass sich die Gesellschaftsutopie [Friedrich] Schlegels zunÃ¤chst einmal auf die kleinen Zirkel des privaten Lebens bezieht (auf die 'Eingeweihten' also, die wie der Kreis der Jenaer Romantiker selbst, als neue 'Gemeinde' betrachtet werden konnten). Die 'unsichtbare Kirche,' von der Schlegel, wie so viele andere in dieser Zeit, spricht, versteht sich als Opposition gegen die herrschenden Formen der Gesellschaft und sollte zunÃ¤chst durch einen 'Bund der KÃ¼nstler' verwirklicht werden, da von ihnenâ¦das Heil der Welt zu erwarten sei.â ([It is unmistakeable] that [Friedrich] Schlegelâs social utopia concerns first of all the narrow circle of private life (of the âinitiatedâ in other words, who, like the circle of the Jena Romantics itself, can be considered a new âcommunityâ). The âinvisible Churchâ of which Schlegel speaks, like so many others at this time, sees itself as in opposition to the dominant forms of contemporary society, and was to be realised first of all through a âfraternity of artists,â since it was from artists that the salvation of the world was expected to come.)\n\n56 See, for instance, Scheffler 1909, p. 36. Christoph Heilmann (The Conoisseur, 195 [August 1977], p. 315) has written that the NazarenesÂ \"expressed their artistic intentions in the most pure and characteristic way\" in their drawings, with portrait and landscape as the most striking, since here \"the abnegation of both artistic individuality and apprehension of the actual 'sujet' are generalised to the utmost degree. This can be seen also in the so-called 'Freundschaftsbilder'... Equally, the landscapes, drawn in thin, pointed pencil apply a highly sensitive linear technique and have nothing to do with 'NaturgefÃ¼hl.'\" In a similar vein, Georg Poensgen (C. Ph.

Kerle Verlag, 1957], p. 29) has emphasized \"das stark Stiliesirende, dem Reiz der Linien-, Licht- und FlÃ¤chenbehandlung den Vorrang gegenÃ¼ber psychologischen Akzenten EinrÃ¤umende\" (âthe strongly stylizing tendency, making room for the charm of emphatic line, light and surface treatment, at the expense of the psychologicalâ)in the portraits of Carl Philipp Fohr.\n\n57. See the handsome book of Hans Geller, Die Bildnisse der deutschen KÃ¼nstler in Rom 1800â1830 (Berlin: Deutscher Verein fÃ¼r Kunstwissenschaft, 1952); Heribert Hutter and Wanda Lhotsky, Julius Schnorr von Carolsfeld: RÃ¶misches PortrÃ¤tbuch (Vienna: Kupferstichkabinett der Akademie der bildenden KÃ¼nste, 1973); and Klaus Lankheit's classic Das Freundschaftsbild der Romantik (1952). On the Zimmerkenotaph (1801â1809) made for Friedrich of WÃ¼rttemberg to commemorate his close friend Count Johann Carl von Zeppelin by Philipp Jakob Scheffauer, the neoclassical WÃ¼rttemberg sculptor, see Christian von Holst, ed., SchwÃ¤bischer Klassizismus: zwischen Ideal und Wirklichkeit, 1770â1830, 2 vols. (Stuttgart: Staatsgalerie, 1993), 2.275â76. A similar Zimmerkenotaph for the brothers Carl and August Ruoff, by Scheffauer's colleague in Stuttgart, Johann Heinrich Dannecker, is described and illustrated 2.180â81. In 1796, Dannecker made medallions of himself and his friend, the poet Schiller; he kept the one of Schiller for himself and gave Schiller the one of him (2.218â19).\n\n58 Julius Schnorr von Carolsfeld's hugely successful Bilderbibel (1855) was published in many countries and many languages. On its success, especially in Great Britain, see Keith Andrews, The Nazarenes (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1964), p. 66; and Julius Schnorr von Carolsfeld 1796-1872, exh. cat., Museum der bildenden KÃ¼nste, Leipzig, 1994 (Leipzig: Edition Leipzig, 1994), pp. 237â39. The Bilderbibel has recently been reprinted by Dover Press in its Pictorial Archive series and is currently advertised on the website of the \"Hollywood Jesus Store,\" which purports to offer \"Pop Culture from a Spiritual Point of View.\"Â New editions also appeared in Russian and German in 1991 and an abbreviated version is available on the internet at www.bilderbibel.de. A typical judgment of the Bilderbibel is that of Hans Weigert (1942, pp. 474-75):\n\nâDie Hauptschuld der Nazarener ist die Banalisierung des Heiligen, das seiner Ferne und seines Geheimnisses entkleidet sich nur durch Sinnigkeit und eine fade Lieblichkeit vom AlltÃ¤glichen unterschied. In des Schnorr von Carolsfeld Holzschnitten zur Bibel wurde der SchÃ¶pfergott zum lieben Grossvater. Von dieser Kunst stammt geradenwegs der heutige Devotionalienkitsch ab, und unser aller Vorstellung von den Gestalten der christlichen Mythologie ist von dieser Kunst verniedlicht und verdorben worden.â (âThe chief sin of the Nazarenes is their banalising of the sacred which, deprived of its distance and mystery, is distinguished from the everyday only by its delicacy and cloying sweetness. In Schnorr von Carolsfeldâs woodcuts illustrating the Bible, the God of Creation assumes the appearance of a benevolent grandfather. Our current devotional kitsch stems directly from that art and our widely shared vision of the figures of Christian mythology has been trivialised and degraded by it.â In contrast, the âmanlinessâ of Alfred Rethel, who started out as a student of the Nazarene artist Wilhelm Schadow, is said to have enabled him to move beyond those âmeekly pious, suffering tear-jerkers,â as he described them.)\n\nIn contrast, the \"manlinessâ of Alfred Rethel, who started out as a student of the Nazarene artist Wilhelm Schadow, is said to have carried him beyond those âstillfrommen und duldenden TrÃ¤nenkÃ¼nstler,â as he called them. See also Sigrid Merken's informative essay, \"Nazarener und 'nazarenisch'â Popularisierung und Trivialisierung eines Kunstideals,\"Â in Die Nazarener 1977, pp. 365â88.\n\n59 See the rich study of Bruno Foucart, Le Renouveau de la peinture religieuse en France, 1800â1860 (Paris: ArthÃ©na, 1987).\n\n60 Quoted in Vaughan 1979, p. 183. In an essay on Overbeck's drawings, Gerhard Gerkens makes a similar point. \"VerÃ¤nderungen der Wirkichkeit, VerkÃ¼rzung und selbst eine gewisse Entleerung der Zeichnung von allen ZÃ¼gen, die sie mit dem Leben verbinden, sind nicht UnvermÃ¶gen,\"Â he noted, \"sondern willentliche Entscheidung.\" (âChanging and reducing reality and even in some degree eliminating from their drawing those features that connect it with life are not a consequence of incapacity,â he noted, âbut the result of a deliberate decision.â Gerhard Gerkens, \"Overbeck als Zeichner,\" in BlÃ¼hm and Gerkens eds. 1989, pp. 34â41, quote on p. 39). See likewise, Christoph Heilmann's review of the 1977 exhibition of the Nazarenes in Frankfurt in Connoisseur 195 (August 1977), p. 315: \"The Nazarenesâ¦were devoted to a renewal of Art on a religious basis and saw their ideal in the purity of life and art, such as had been realised, in their opinion, by DÃ¼rer and Raphael. Naturally, the means of expressing theirâ¦feelings underwent a continuous process of repressing reality in every range, which consequently also meant renouncing colour, in the sense of light and atmosphere, in favour of the contour. Colour became an additional ingredient, supplementary to the disegno of the subject.\"\n\n61 In his fine monograph on Pforr, Herbert Lehr (1924) tried to make the case that Pforr was a truly gifted artist whose work suffered to the degree that it was influenced by the allegedly less talented Overbeck in whom the philosopher and the theologian far outweighed the artist.\n\n62 Thus Scheffler (1909, p. 10): \"Insofern ist der Hellenismus dieser MÃ¤nner [Winckelmann and Lessing] dem Raffaelitentum der Nazarener keineswegs entgegengesetzt. Der Gegensatz dieser sich dort hellenistisch und hier christlich organisierenden Gedankenkunst liegt in den gleichzeitig versiegenden ursprÃ¼nglichen SchÃ¶pfungskrÃ¤ften des Barock und Rokoko. Diese aristokratischen SchÃ¶pfungskrÃ¤fte wollten zu dem beginnenden demokratischen Zeitalter nicht passen; darum wurden sie als dekadent von den Ã¼ber neue bÃ¼rgerliche Kultur Reflektierenden abgelehnt und gingen in der Traditionenblidung verloren.\" Compare Heinrich WÃ¶lfflin's characterization (1893) of Wackenroder's Herzensergiessungen eines kunstliebenden Klosterbrudersâa main source of inspiration for the Nazarenesâas \"ein Protest gegen den zeitgenÃ¶ssischen Betrieb der Kunst, gegen das blosse Hantieren mit erlernten Kunstrezepten, wo ein blindendes Kolorit, eine geistreiche Ausstreuung von Lichtern und Schatten, eine Ã¼berraschende Komposition und kunstreiche VerschrÃ¤nkung der Gruppen die einzige Absicht des Malers bilde.\" Heinrich WÃ¶lfflin, Kleine Schriften (1886â1933), ed. Joseph Gantner (Basel: Schwabe, 1946), p. 206.\n\n(âThe Hellenism of these men [Winckelmann and Lessing] is in that respect in no way opposed to the Raphaelitism of the Nazarenes. What this intellectual art -- established in one case on a Hellenistic foundation , in the other on a Christian foundation -- stood out against was the original creative energies of the Baroque and the Rococo which at the time were fading. These aristocratic energies were not ready to adapt to the rising democratic age; and so they were rejected as decadent by those giving thought to the new culture of the middle classes and were thus lost to living artistic tradition.â Compare Heinrich WÃ¶lfflin's characterization (1893) of Wackenroder's Herzensergiessungen eines kunstliebenden Klosterbrudersâa main source of inspiration for the Nazarenesâas âa protest against the contemporary practice of art, against the mere exploiting of learned artistic recipes, in which the sole aim of the artist was to achieve blinding colour effects, an ingenious distribution of light and shade, startling composition, and clever grouping of figures.â)\n\n63 Both subjects were treated by Overbeck, the first in a painting (Museen fÃ¼r Kunst und Kulturgeschichte, LÃ¼beck), the other of a drawing enhanced by watercolor (1815; Staatliche Museen, Kupferstichkabinett, Berlin); see Die Nazarener 1977, pp. 60, 70, 201, 236.\n\n64. See the comments of Rosenblum (1956, p. 97) on Carstens (in contrast to David): \"Like French art of the time, [Carstens's] drawing finds its inspiration in antique history, yet it is an interpretation of antiquity which has no public ramifications, no lessons of virtue to teach to a new bourgeois audience. Rather, it is a private, highly personal approach to antiquity.\" In his Letters on the Aesthetic Education of Mankind, Schiller likewise focused on the transformation, harmonization, and emancipation of the individual, not on institutional or political change in itself.\n\n65Â Caspar David Friedrich in Briefen 1968, pp. 9, 85. See also, ibid., p. 106: \"Dieses Bild von â erinnert mich wieder an das oft schon Gesagte: dass, wenn auch in unserer Zeit wiederum ein Raffael oder sonst ein ausgezeichneter KÃ¼nstler wie die der Vorzeit aufstÃ¼nde mit ebenso grossen Naturanlagen und FÃ¤higkeiten wie seine VorgÃ¤nger, er wÃ¼rde dennoch nicht wie jene malen. Seine Werke wÃ¼rden und mÃ¼ssten immer das GeprÃ¤ge seiner Zeit an sich tragen.\" (âThis painting by ---- reminds me once again of the often quoted comment to the effect that even if a Raphael or another superb artist like those of the early period were to arise in our time, with just as remarkable natural talents and capacities as his predecessors, he would nevertheless not paint in the same way they did. His works would always, inevitably, bear the mark of his own time.â)\n\n66.Â Letter to Sutter, 10 October 1810, quoted in HowittÂ 1.162: \"â¦ein vollkommener KÃ¼nstler nicht ohne Philosophie gedacht werden kann, so wenig wie ohne Poesie.\"\n\n67.

The development of reflection in our life today has made it a need of ours, in relation both to our will and judgment, to cling to general considerations and to regulate the particular by them, with the result that universal forms, laws, duties, rights, maxims, prevail as determining reasons and are the chief regulatorâ¦Consequently the conditions of our present time are not favourable to art. It is notâ¦merely that the practicing artist himself is infected by the loud voice of reflection all around him and by the opinions and judgments on art that have become customary everywhere, so that he is misled into introducing more thoughts into his work: the point is that our whole spiritual culture is of such a kind that he himself stands within the world of reflection and its relations, and could not by any act of will and decision abstract himself from it.â\n\nÂ The writer E.T.A. Hoffmann explores the potentially tragic consequence of this situation for the artist in the tale Die Jesuitenkirche in G, written between 1815 and 1816.\n\n68.

The theme of Apollo Among the Shepherds also inspired Schick's friend Joseph Anton Koch in a work currently in the Thorvaldsen Museum, Copenhagen and the Neue Pinakothek, Munich.\n\n70Â As the sign of a consciously founded, sometimes conspiratorial community, rather than a traditional one, whose origins, as Rousseau put it, are lost in the mist of antiquity, the oath topos was popular in the revolutionary climate of the last third of the eighteenth century and the beginning of the nineteenth and was taken up by a number of artists, for example, Gavin Hamilton in his Oath of Brutus (1767), Fuseli in his RÃ¼tli Oath (1779-81), David in his Oath of the Horatii (1785) and the unfinished Tennis Court Oath (1791â), and Joseph Anton Koch in his Oath of the 1500 Republicans at Montenesimo (1797).\n\n71 Heinrich WÃ¶lfflin, commenting on a work by Overbeck in his 1911 Berlin University lectures on the history of painting in the nineteenth century, may have been the first to apply the term to the Nazarenes: \"Er trat jener Sezession bei, die sich nach Rom aufmachte.\" (Heinrich WÃ¶lfflin, commenting on a work by Overbeck in his 1911 Berlin University lectures on the history of painting in the nineteenth century, may have been the first to apply the term to the Nazarenes: \"He joined that Sezession that moved to Rome.â) WÃ¶lfflin 1993, p. 38.\n\n72 HowittÂ 1.109-14; Ludwig Grote, Joseph Sutter und der Nazarensiche Gedanke (Munich: Prestel, 1972), pp. 98â113.\n\n73 The student \"muss erst seine Hand Ã¼ben und den Mechanismus mehrerer Zeichnungsarten sich eigen machen, ehe er zur Malerei und den hÃ¶heren Theilen derselben Ã¼bergehen kann.

Geschichtsrezeption in der nazarenischen Malerei des frÃ¼hen 19. Jahrhunderts (Munich and Berlin: Deutscher Kunstverlag, 2000), p. 55. Winckelmann himself, in the very text where he first defined \"edle Einfalt und stille GrÃ¶sse\" as the essential characteristic of the art of the Ancients (Gedanken Ã¼ber die Nachahmung der griechischen Werke in der Malerei und Bildhauerkunst, 1755), repeatedly evoked the \"Ruhe und Stille\"Â (\"tranquility and calm\") of Raphael in contrast with the manner of later painters like Caravaggio or the Dutch. To many people those qualities appear \"leblos\" (\"lifeless\"), he acknowledged, but to the practiced eye they are \"bedeutend und erhaben\" (\"noble and meaningful\"). Winckelmann singled out the Dresden Madonna with Child for special praise:\n\nâSehet die Madonna, mit einem Gesichte voll Unschuld und zugleich einer mehr als weiblichen GrÃ¶sse, in einer selig ruhigen Stellung, in derjenigen Stille, welche die Alten in den Bildern der Gottheiten herschen liessen. Wie gross und edel is ihr ganzer Kontur! \" (\"Look at the Madonna, with her face full of innocence and her more than merely womanly grandeur, in a posture of blessed calm, characterized by that tranquillity that the Ancients imparted to the images of their divinities. How grand and noble is her entire contour!â [J.J. Winckelmann, Ewiges Griechentum: Auswahl aus seinen Schriften und Briefen, ed. Fritz Forschepiepe (Stuttgart: Alfred KrÃ¶ner, 1943), pp. 15â16, 23â25.]\n\n84Â HowittÂ 1.83. The young LukasbrÃ¼der may well have been aware of the similar criticism of painterly technique and \"bravura brushstrokes\" in Winckelmann's Geschichte der Kunst des Altertums (1764). In antiquity itself, Winckelmann noted, the sculptor Myron was censured by some later writers for his \"hardness.\" In this,Â \"the ancient writers have very often judged of art in the same manner as the moderns; for the firmness of drawing, the correctly and severely rendered figures of Raphael, have appeared hard and stiff to many, when compared with the tenderness of the outlines and the round and softly treated forms of Correggio.\" However, \"as in learning music and speech, it is essential to produce the tones of the one and the syllables and words of the other with sharp clarity in order to achieve purity, harmony, and fluency of expression, drawing leads to truth and beauty of form in art not through vague, fluid, suggestive strokes of the pen or brush, but through manly and exactly delimited outlines, even when these are somewhat hard.\" Quoted from English translation by G. Henry Lodge, The History of Ancient Art, 4 vols. (Boston: James R. Osgood, 1872), 3.199â200; cf. J. J. Winckelmann, Geschichte der Kunst des Altertums (Vienna: Phaidon Verlag, 1934), pp. 216â18.\n\n85Â The Goethe-Meyer text, drafts of which go back to 1813â14, appeared in the first volume of Ãber Kunst und Altertum in 1817.

He defended public exhibitions and public criticism of art because he saw in them a counterweight to the influence of the market. \"Salon of 1767,\" in Salons, ed. Jean Seznec and Jean AdhÃ©mar, 4 vols. (Oxford; Clarendon Press, 1957â67),Â Â 3.55â56. His critiques of Boucher and Baudouin in particular focus on the influence of the petit goÃ»t of well-to-do private clients. When artists become the servants of wealth and luxury, he argued, \"great talents are degraded and made to produce works of no consequence, and the subject matter of art is diminished to insignificant bambochades.\" \"Salon of 1769,\" in Salons, 4.65â66. Thus he feared that a sketch by Greuze for a painting on the topic of \"the punished son\" may never be worked over into a finished painting because of the \"wretched taste of the times,\"Â and even if it is, \"Boucher will have sold fifty of his indecent, stale marionettes before Greuze sells two magnificent paintings.\"Â \"Salon of 1765,\" in Salons, 2.158â59. Diderot himself, however, occasionally recommended works he considered of enduring value to his readers, on the grounds that they were a wise long-term investment of capital.\n\n88 On the transformation of the artist's status, see \"Kommentar: Die Romantische Schule des Sehens,\" in Apel ed. 1992, pp. 747â48.\n\n89Â Such a community of artists had been suggested by the youthful Friedrich Schlegel: \"Ob dann das Heil der Welt von den Gelehrten zu erwarten sei? Ich weiss es nicht. Aber Zeit ist es, dass alle KÃ¼nstler zusammentreten als Eidgenossen zu ewigem BÃ¼ndniss.\" \"Wie die Kaufleute im Mittelalter so sollten die KÃ¼nstler jetzt zusammentreten zu einer Hanse, um sich einigermassen gegenseitig zu schÃ¼tzen.\" (âShould we expect the learned to bring about the salvation of the world? I know not. But it is time for all artists to band together as sworn members in an everlasting union.â âLike the merchants of the Middle Ages, todayâs artists should come together in a guild, in order to lend each other some measure of support and protection.â) See hisÂ \"Ideen,\" in AthenÃ¤um 32, p. 143, reprinted in Friedrich Schlegel, Kritische Ausgabe, ed.

The former, through their severe drawing, finally attained to correctness; and character is manifest in the firm, spare strokes even of the smallest figure.âÂ [Quoted from the G. Henry Lodge translation, Winckelmann 1872, 3.176]\n\nKant too had maintained that for all the visual arts \"ist die Zeichnung das Wesentliche, in welcher nicht, was in der Empfindung vergnÃ¼gt, sondern bloss durch seine Form gefÃ¤llt, den Grund aller Anlage fÃ¼r den Geschmack ausmacht. Die Farben, welche den Abriss illuminieren, gehÃ¶ren zum Reiz, den Gegenstand an sich kÃ¶nnen sie zwar fÃ¼r die Empfindung beliebt aber nicht anschauungswÃ¼rdig und schÃ¶n machen.\"Â (âIn the figures of the Greeks, the most noble contour brings together or circumscribes all the parts of the most beautiful nature and ideally beautiful objects.â âThe perfect contour is the supreme goal of the artist.â (Ewiges Griechentum. . . Kant too had maintained that for all the visual arts âdrawing is the most essential aspect. In drawing it is not what pleases by way of feeling but only what pleases through its form that constitutes the basis of a predisposition to taste. The colors that brighten the outline design belong to the seductiveness of a work and can indeed make the subject matter in itself pleasing to our feelings, but not worthy or beautiful.â ) Quoted in Rosenblum 1956, pp. 97.\n\nThe historical significance of the emphasis on contour and line, its anticipation of twentieth-century art, has been well pointed out by a French scholar:\n\nâOn sait quel est l'enjeu du dÃ©bat: la proclamation de la supÃ©rioritÃ©, non plus du dessin mais du simple contour, sur toutes les autres parties de l'art, position extrÃªmiste qui surgit de plusieurs cÃ´tÃ©s en ces annÃ©es cruciales, Ã©tait grosse d'avenir. A court terme, ce sont les 'primitifs', c'est le David des Sabines et tout Ingres qui en dÃ©veloppent les consequences. A plus longue Ã©chÃ©ance elle porte en germe les audaces de Gauguin et de Matisseâ¦.âÂ Â (It is clear what is at stake in the debate: the assertion of the superiority to every other aspect of art no longer of the design but simply of the contour itself -- an extremist position that arose in various quarters in these crucial years and that was destined to have a significant future. In the short term, it is the so-called âPrimitives,â the David of the Sabines and all of Ingres, who develop its potential. But if we take a longer view, it contains in nuce the audacious innovations of Gauguin and Matisse.)

Sculptor, Illustrator, Designer (London: Studio Vista / Christie's, 1979) and the outstanding study of Flaxman by Symmons (1984).\n\n98 When it was first published in Paris in 1808 (2d ed. 1811), Artaud de Montor's study of early Italian painting bore the title ConsidÃ©rations sur l'Ã©tat de la peinture en Italie dans les quatre siÃ¨cles qui ont prÃ©cÃ©dÃ© celui de Raphael. For a new edition with a different publisher in 1843, however, the title was changed to Peintres primitifs: Collection de tableaux rapportÃ©e d'Italie.\n\n99 See AndrÃ© Chastel, \"Le GoÃ»t des 'PrÃ©raphaÃ©lites en France\" (1956), in his Fables, Formes, Figures, 2 vols.

(Paris: Treuttel et WÃ¼rtz, 1811â23) by Jean-Baptiste-Louis-Georges Seroux d'Agincourt, a wealthy French amateur, who was the companion of Angelica Kauffmann in Rome. (Italian, German, and English translations of this work appeared in 1825, 1840, and 1847 respectively.) Seroux's stated aim was to be \"the Winckelmann of the Middle Ages.\" He also had high regard for DÃ¼rer (see 2.138), then still outside the accepted academic canon, though by no means neglected. DÃ¼rer's influence is visible, for instance, in the work of the mid-eighteenth century Scottish artist John Runciman (1744â1768); see David and Francina Irwin, Scottish Painters at Home and Abroad, 1700â1900 (London: Faber and Faber, 1975), pp. 111â12. Carstens expressed admiration for DÃ¼rer before the appearance of Wackenroder's Herzensergiessungen; see Hans Eichner and Norma Lelless, \"Nachwort,\" in their edition of Friedrich Schlegel's GemÃ¤lde alter Meister (Darmstadt: Wissenschaftliche Buchgesellschaft, 1984), p. 213.

See also Rosenblum in Transformations in Late Eighteenth-Century Art (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1967), pp. 163â67. Quentin Bell has emphasized that the turn to the early Italian painters was part of the same quest as the turn to ancient models: \"While the great majority of pupils of David were content to follow their master in the pursuit of classical antiquity, there was one pupilâand the most giftedâwho for a time strayed into another path and sought excellence in the earlier manifestations of Italian art. Ingres could look back beyond Raphael and in his 'Paolo and Francesca' produces something that seems much closer to the Quattrocento than to the classical prototypes of his master.\" See Quentin Bell,Â \"The Life Room as a Battlefield,\" in his Bad Art (London: Chatto and Windus, 1989), pp. 115â63, quote on p. 131.\n\n103 Quoted in Rosenblum 1956, p. 162.\n\n104On the Primitifs or Barbus, see E.J.

ThÃ©ophile Gautier reports that the artist Gabriel Tyr, a student of Orsel's and thus close to the esthetic ideals of the Nazarenes, used to say \"qu'il fallait baptiser l'art grec et le faire agenouiller sous l'arceau byzantin ou l'ogive gothique\" [âWe need to baptise the art of the Greeks and get it to kneel beneath the Byzantine or the Gothic archâ] (Gautier in Moniteur universel, 24 February 1868, quoted in his Correspondance gÃ©nÃ©rale, 10.45â46.\n\n108 In his three-volume Histoire de l'art moderne en Allemagne, which appeared simultaneously in French (Paris: Jules Renouard) and in a German translation (Geschichte der neueren deutschen Kunst [Berlin: Auf Kosten des Verfassers]) between 1836 and 1841, Count Athanesius Raczyncki professed belief in \"das positive SchÃ¶ne undâ¦die ewigen Wahrheiten.\" (âthe positively beautiful and . . . eternal truths.â ) There is, he claimed, \"etwas HÃ¶heres als die Mode und ihre Lehren: es sind die unverÃ¤nderlichen Gesetze und die Erscheinungen der Natur, welche uns in die Absichten des SchÃ¶pfers einweihen.â¦\" (1.3). According to Raczyncki, the two main strains in modern German art, the classical and the Christian, both aspire toward \"truth\" and are essentially idealist rather than realist in inspiration and character. Later art historians have upheld Raczyncki's implicit association of neoclassical and Nazarene art, despite Goethe's emphasis on what separates them. Thus Hans Hildebrandt in Die Kunst des 19. und 20. Jahrhunderts (Wildpark-Potsdam: Athenaion, 1924), pp. 77â78: \"Ohne es zu ahnen, Ã¼bertrug der Nazarener [i.e. Overbeck] viel von den GrundsÃ¤tzen des heidnischen Klassizismus in seine Auffassung des Christentums, das ihm nur mildes Dulden und sanfte VerklÃ¤rung in SchÃ¶nheit war. Dieser Kompromiss prÃ¤gt sich augenfÃ¤llig in der formalen Durchbildung seiner Werke aus. Eine andere LÃ¶sung als die rein harmonische des Bildaufbaues um eine Symmetrieachse fiel Overbeck niemals ein.\" (âWithout being aware of it, the Nazarene [i.e. Overbeck] carried many of the principles of pagan classicism over into his conception of Christianity, which for him involved only mild suffering and tranquil transfiguration into beauty. This compromise is clearly visible in the formal elaboration of his artworks. No solution other than the purely harmonious one of composition around a symmetrical axis ever occurred to Overbeck.â)\n\nClassicism and Romanticism are now seen as âdifferent solutions proposed for the same historical situation at the beginnings of modernity. Notwithstanding the fact that one took effect after the other in the course of history, they sprang from the same root and were parallel phenomena rather than opposites.â) See also Scheffler 1909, pp. 9â10; Weigert 1942, p. 467; Rosenblum 1956, pp. 59â62. Most recently, Klaus Lankheit has argued that the old ideal of classical and romantic as polar opposites (as in the art history of Georg Dehio and Gustav Pauli) is no longer acceptable. Classicism and romanticism are now seen as \"verschiedene LÃ¶sungsversuchen fÃ¼r dieselbe geschichtliche Situation am Beginn der Moderne. Unbeschadet der Tatsache, dass sie in historischem Ablauf nacheinander wirksam geworden sind, entsprangen sie beide derselben Wurzel und waren eher Parallelerscheinungen als GegensÃ¤tze.\" \"Klassizismus und Romantik,\" in Klassizismus und Romantik in Deutschland 1966, pp. 17-20, quote on p. 17.\n\n110 Overbeck's journal for 31 October 1811, quoted in HowittÂ 1, p. 188.\n\n111 See Jensen in Klassizismus und Romantik in Deutschland 1966, pp. 47â48.\n\n113 HowittÂ 1.382â87. Salomon Bartholdy's relation to the Nazarenes appears to have been somewhat ambivalent. In one letter to his niece, Fanny Mendelssohn, sister of the composer and wife of the artist Wilhelm Hensel, he expressed considerable impatience with them and their work; see Felix Gilbert, ed., Bankiers, KÃ¼nstler und Gelehrte: UnverÃ¶ffentlichte Briefe der Familie Mendelssohn aus dem 19. Jahrhundert (TÃ¼bingen: J.C.B. Mohr, 1975), pp. 55â56. Bartholdy's ambivalence probably reflects in part the tension in the large Mendelssohn family between those who converted to Protestantism and those who, like Dorothea Schlegel and her two sons, converted to Catholicism.\n\n116 \"Ein Maler soll aber malen kÃ¶nnen.\" Quoted in Michael Dirrigl, Ludwig I KÃ¶nig von Bayern, 1825â1848 (Munich: Hugendubel, 1980), p. 182 (vol. 1 of a 4 volume-study, Das KulturkÃ¶nigtum der Wittelsbacher).\n\n117 DÃ¼sseldorf Academy (1826), Philipp Veit took over the leadership of the StÃ¤delsches Institut in Frankfurt am Main (1830) and later became director of the Art Gallery in Mainz (1854), Ferdinand Olivier was appointed secretary-general of the Academy and professor of art history in Munich (1833), Johann Anton Ramboux became curator of the Wallraf collection in Cologne (1843), Julius Schnorr von Carolsfeld became director of the Art Gallery and professor at the Dresden Academy (1846). See Apel ed. 1992, p. 757 (\"Kommentar: Die Romantische Schule des Sehens\").\n\n119 On the interest among the \"second generation\" of Nazarene painters in psychological realism, at the expense of narrative meaning, and the resulting stylistic modifications, see Cordula Grewe, \"The Invention of the Secular Devotional Picture,\" Word and Image 16 (2000), pp. 45â57.

The initials of the three friendsâPOPâare inscribed in a circle in the lower left section of the sketch.\n\n123Â See the excellent discussion in Heise 1999, pp. 87â88.\n\n124Â See especially E. Ann Matter, The Voice of My Beloved: The Song of Songs in Western Medieval Christianity (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1990), pp. 150â77, and Rachel Fulton, From Judgment to Passion: Devotion to Christ and the Virgin Mary, 800â1200 (New York: Columbia University Press, 2002), pp. 273â74, 289â350.\n\n125Â At the time of Pforr's illness, as he lay close to death, Overbeck noted in his journal (26 April 1812): \"Ach, meine Natur ist allzu fest an ihn gewachsen! Mit ihm und durch ihn habe ich den wahren Mai meines Lebens genossen! Pforr! Mein Bruder! Deine Liebe war mir sonderlicher denn Frauenliebe! Und nun! Muss ich mit dem Gedanken vertraut zu werden versuchen, durch das Grab von dir getrennt zu werden!\" (âAlas, my whole being has grown all too firmly attached to his. With him and through him I enjoyed the true Springtime of my life! Pforr! My brother! Your love was more special to me than the love of woman! And now! I have to try to get used to the idea of being separated from you by the grave.â) Quoted in HowittÂ 1, p. 231. In Overbeck's Entry of Christ into Jerusalem (completed in 1824), Pforr is represented with the other LukasbrÃ¼der and Overbeck himself walking behind the Apostles. In 1834â35, Overbeck persuaded the Frankfurt Kunstverein to publish a series of engravings and lithographs after drawings by Pforr (HowittÂ 1, p. 539); and in 1865, not long before his own death, he ordered a marble plaque for Pforr's tomb and represented Pforr as the bridegroom with the idealÂ \"Maria\" of their youthful fantasies in a series of illustrations on the theme of Christian Family Life. HowittÂ 2, p. 388. His last thoughts, on his deathbed, were of Pforr.\n\n126Â A comment by Overbeck, reported by Schnorr von Carolsfeld in one of the latterâs letters to Johann Gottlob von Quandt, makes Overbeckâs severe view of portrait painting abundantly clear. Schnorr had been planning to make a portrait of Vittoria Caldoni, the daughter of a vineyard keeper and wine-maker in the Alban hills around Rome. He proposed to represent this much painted model (over 100 portraits of her survive) with a spindle in her hand, momentarily interrupting her work and looking out at the viewer. According to Schnorr, Overbeck objected that this conception of the projected painting âwas inconsistent with the true style of the portrait. Bringing examples of the most outstanding portraits to my attention, he showed me that the greatest masters of the genre avoided representing the individuals whose portrait they were about to create in any kind of activity. These individuals were not represented as though the viewer had come upon them unexpectedly and by chance; rather they presented themselves to the viewer deliberately in their innermost being.â (Cited by Davis, Auf den Spuren der Nazarener [see endnote 1], p. 15.) A somewhat similar view was expressed in the mid-20th century by Sir Philip Hendy, then Director of the National Gallery in London, in connection with a Portrait of a Young Man by Botticelli in the Galleryâs collections: âIn modern timesâ¦the portraitist puts all his skill into getting an immediate likeness and is apt to be content with making a facsimile illusion of the sitterâs outer skinâ¦The great portraits of the world, however, are by idealists. The artistâ¦is seeking in form what is basic and permanent and he modifies and rearranges it to express his ideas. Consequently he brings to portraiture the power not only to eliminate the momentary and superficial but to idealize what is deep and lastingâ (The National Gallery, London [New York: Harry N. Abrams, n.d., 1st English ed. 1955], p. 107)\n\n127Â \"â¦ein MÃ¤dchen jung und schÃ¶n, blond, zart und Ã¤usserst liebenswÃ¼rdig, in einfacher doch geschmackvoller Kleidung;â¦kurz ein MÃ¤dchen, wie es Deutschland im Mittelalter hÃ¤tte hervorbringen kÃ¶nnen.\" (a maiden young and beautiful, blond, gentle, and infinitely, clad in simple yet tasteful dress;. . .in short, a maiden such as Germany could have brought forth in the Middle Ages.â) Quoted in HowittÂ 1.65.\n\n128Â \"Ob ich es Weib oder Mann nennen sollte. Ein Wesen, war alles was ich sagen konnte, ernst doch sanftâ¦mit dunkeln Haaren, nur Kopf und HÃ¤nde sichtbarâ¦; in der Mitte etwas Heiliges, Ueberirdisches; in Stellung und Geberde etwas GeheimnisvollesÂ â kurz ein Wesen, das man nicht bloss lieben, sondern das man anbeten kÃ¶nnte; dessen Anblick einen hinreissen kÃ¶nnte zu den heiligsten GefÃ¼hlen.\" Quoted in HowittÂ 1.65.\n\n129Â \"Ich mÃ¶chte den, der sich der Kunst weihen will, fragen, wie man einen, der MÃ¶nch werden will, fragt: kannst Du das GelÃ¼bde der Armut, der Keuschheit und des Gehorsams ablegen und halten, so tritt ein.\" Letter of 15 December 1810, quoted in Fastert 2000, p. 38.\n\n132 See Elisabeth Foucart-Walter and Pierre Rosenberg, Le Chat et la Palette. Le Chat dans la peinture occidentale du XVe au XXe siÃ¨cle (Paris: Adam Biro, 1987), p. 172. The cat resembles the falcon in that both are symbols of wildness tamed and restrained. The falcon is usually taken to represent the Gentile converted to Christiantiy, the cat to represent the devil overcome by the Virgin as in Giulio Romano's Raphael-inspired Madonna with the Cat, now in the Museo di Capodimonte, Naples.\n\n133 Other possible references that have been suggested include the \"kÃ¤mpferischer KÃ¼nstlerwille\" (âthe fighting artistic drive) of the painter of battle scenes (Pforr's earliest ambition) and self-sacrificing love, as in some medieval texts. The falcon would thus be the symbol of Pforr's love of art. Heise 1999, pp. 81â82.\n\n134 On Pforr's Entry of Rudolf of Habsburg as a \"deliberate provocation aimed at the painting of the period,\" see Le Bris 1981, p. 96.\n\n136 \"Es ging aber wegen der Bauarth nicht gut an, es gebrauchen zu kÃ¶nnen.\" Quoted in Lehr 1924, p. 108; Fastert 2000, p. 74.\n\n137 See Fastert 2000, pp. 73â74. For a brief overview of the political significance of the figure of Rudolf of Habsburg in the years of the struggle for German freedom and national unity, see KohlhÃ¤ufl 1999, pp. 122â23.\n\n138 See Wilhelm Schlink, \"Heilsgeschichte in der Malerei der Nazarener,\" Aurora, forthcoming.\n\n139 Die Nazarener 1977, pp. 152â53, 201; BlÃ¼hm and Gerkens eds. 1989, pp. 205, 208.\n\n140 The use of female figures to represent friendship or brotherhood may also have signaled a less militarist ideal than might have been evoked by the use of a traditional masculine couple such as David and Jonathan. In Pietist writing, the Braut or Betrothed, as the symbol of the soul faithfully awaiting its lover, the Savior, transcended the distinction of masculine and feminine. By choosing to represent their friendship through two female figures, Overbeck and Pforr may well therefore have intended to emphasize its spiritual and religious aspect rather than the martial and political character that friendship often had in Germany at the time of the national struggle for freedom and national unity. Correspondingly, their idea of national unity is likely to have been different both from that of republicans, whose models were the heroic citizens of antiquity, and from that of a new breed of nationalists inspired by the Prussian education reformer, Friedrich Ludwig Jahn, whose popular gymnastics clubs for young German men of all classes were meant to serve simultaneously as a training ground in the patriotic struggle against the French and as the model of a post-liberation social and political order free from outmoded ancien rÃ©gime distinctions and territorial divisions. In contrast to the disciplined, muscular, male body celebrated at Jahn's Turnfeste or Gymnastics Festivals, the first of which was held in Berlin in 1811, Pforr's and Overbeck's female figures and the somewhat androgynous male figure of Overbeck's portrait of Pforr suggest a less regimented, more spiritual and religious idea of unity and fraternity.\n\n141 In the Freundschaftsbild, a form specially favored by the Nazarenes and executed by them with great delicacy and charm, the head only is represented; multiple figures are most often arranged in parallel, indicating independence, almost never with arms around each other. On this, see Lankheit 1952; also Die Nazarener 1977, pp. 169, 174.\n\n142 On mariological interpretations of the Song of Solomon, see Fulton 2002, chap. 6; and Max Engammare, Qu'il me baise des baisers de sa bouche: Le Cantique des Cantiques Ã la Renaissance (Geneva: Droz, 1993), pp. 26â66. Curiously, the name Sulamith was chosen as the title of the first important Jewish periodical in Germany. As the subtitle spelled out, the aim of the periodical, which began publication with the Leipzig firm of A.L. Reinicke in 1806 and survived until around the time of the 1848 revolutions, was \"BefÃ¶rderung der Cultur und HumanitÃ¤t der jÃ¼dischen Nation\"âi.e., in the spirit of the philosopher Moses Mendelssohn, raising the cultural level of the Jews, developing their HumanitÃ¤t, and thus reconciling Christians and Jews in an enlightened German society, without requiring that the Jews cease to be Jews. Most of Moses Mendelssohn's children and grandchildren, however, sought to achieve an even closer association with German society and culture by taking the further step of converting to Christianity, albeit without losing sight of and pride in their Jewish origins. Several of these individuals (the Veit brothers, Dorothea Schlegel, Jacob Salomon Bartholdy) were well acquainted with the LukasbrÃ¼der and shared their goals. The use of the Shulamite figure by Overbeck and Pforr in association with the figure of Mary may thus reflect in some measure the less strictly Enlightenment conception of the relations of Germans and Jews developed by the romantic generation following Moses Mendelssohn. As the Shulamite was \"black,\" yet \"comely,\" and in Christian thought both the bride of Solomon and the bride of Christ, the converted German Jews were Christian, yet in some measure Jewish at the same timeâunited with their fellow Christian Germans, yet distinguished by their own past and traditions.\n\n143 Cotter 2001 (review of exhibition of paintings from the National Gallery, Berlin, at the National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.). Overbeck himself was probably inspired by it when he chose the diptych form for a particularly fine drawing (1814) combining the Annunciation and the Visitation (Kupferstichkabinett, Kunstmuseum, Basel), the first panel of which bears the title Ave Maria and the second Benedicta in Mulieribus. The drawing was doubtless made in preparation for a painting presently in the Museo Nacional San Carlos in Mexico City (Fig. 91).\n\n144 See the description of Pforr's Self-Portrait by Thea Vignau-Wilberg in Deutsche Romantiker: Bildthemen der Zeit von 1800 bis 1850, exh. cat., Kunsthalle der Hypo-Kulturstiftung, Munich (Munich: Hirmer Verlag, 1985), p. 30. Compare Robert Rosenblum's commentary on Ingres's Madame Aymon, also known as La Belle ZÃ©lie of 1806 (MusÃ©e des Beaux-Arts, Rouen): \"In order to emphasize the flat picture surface, Ingres, much like Picasso, seems to see the same object from multiple viewpoints, although his ostensible adherence to the data of the objective world creates a perhaps even more disturbing image than that of the twentieth-century artist. Thus the chin and the left side of the face are seen frontally, whereas the mouth, the right side of the face, and the part in the hair are seen obliquelyâ¦. The nose appears to be seen both frontally and from the side, thus helping to bridge the gap between the two diverse points of view.\" Similarly,Â \"the eyes appear to have been observed separately,\" so that the sitter has a slightly wall-eyed look. Rosenblum 1956, pp. 175â76.\n\n145 Â (Muther 1, 133).\n\n146 See the comment on Overbeck's Familienbildnis (1820â22; Museen fÃ¼r Kunst und Kulturgeschichte, LÃ¼beck) in BlÃ¼hm and Gerkens eds. 1989, p. 132: \"Vater, Mutter und Kind sind eng verbunden und als Einheit verstanden. Dennoch ist jede Person durch eine dominante Farbe des Gewandes deutlich unterschieden und jeder ist ein eigener Bereich zugewiesenâ¦Ihre Blicke streben zwar in verschiedene Richtung aber durch die KÃ¶rperhaltungen sind sie wieder aufeinander bezogen.\"Â A similar, more detailed comment on this work in Jens Christian Jensen, Malerei der Romantik in Deutschland (Cologne: DuMont, 1985), p. 100, and on the drawing entitled \"Jakob wirbt um Rahel\" (1808; Museen fÃ¼r Kunst und Kulturgeschichte, LÃ¼beck) in Die Nazarener 1977, p. 200.\n\n147 Michel Le Bris (1981) made this same point with reference to Pforr's Entry of Rudolf of Habsburg. In \"the sharpness of the contours, the vivacity of the colours, laid on in flat tints almost without nuances within clearly divided surfaces\" and \"the composition of the scene itself, splintered into a multitude of animated groups, each independent of the others and drawn with extreme preciseness of detail, yet without detracting from the overall unity,\" Le Bris (1981, p. 96) saw the striking originality of Pforr's work and \"a deliberate provocation aimed at the painting of the period.\" In contrast, according to Heinrich WÃ¶lfflin in his Berlin lectures of 1911, what characterized French Romantic painting, notably Delacroix, was precisely the opposite: Delacroix admired Rembrandt as the greatest of all painters, \"because in his work everything is dominated by a grandiose unity of the partsâ¦. Everything is grasped in a single visual perception and experienced in a single emotion. No one part of the picture can be isolated from the whole. The massing of the paint provides the ground on which battle is joined with the classicistic principle of the unity of the many.\"Â The same pointâessentially that romanticism and the baroque share a significant commitment to the dominance of the whole over the partâis restated in WÃ¶lfflin's comments on The Massacre at Chios:Â \"Clarity of outline had hitherto ensured the clarity of the painting; now it is not so easy to release figures from the mass. An unmistakable principle is at work here: namely, that the artist is not obligated to provide a clear articulation of bodies. Truth lies in the appearance of the whole as such, not in the elaboration of each individual part. Everything has to be seen together, as a single whole, not as groups of particular parts, not as a mosaic of particular parts.\" WÃ¶lfflin 1993, pp. 66â67.\n\n149 \"Report on the Paintings in Paris and the Netherlands in the Years 1802â1804\" in The Aesthetic and Miscellaneous Works of Friedrich von Schlegel, trans., E.J. Millington (London: Herny G. Bohn, 1849), p. 6. To Schlegel's younger contemporary, the Hegelian art historian Carl Schnaase, the same combination of autonomy and association was the supreme characteristic of Greek art and culture: \"Darin eben lag der Keim ihrer GrÃ¶sse, dassâ¦jedes Einzelne sich rein und gesondert darstellte, alle diese Gestaltungen aber in naher BerÃ¼hrung blieben.\" Carl Schnaase, Geschichte der bildenden KÃ¼nste, 2d ed., 2 vols.
