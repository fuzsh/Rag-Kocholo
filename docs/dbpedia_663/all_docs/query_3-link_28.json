        "text": "Maja Haderlap received a grant from the Federal Chancellery of Austria for the writing residency at Deutsches Haus at NYU, and will be staying in New York from September through October. Deutsches Haus at NYU will present a reading by the author from Angel of Oblivion (Archipelago Press) and a conversation between Maja Haderlap and the acclaimed translator Tess Lewis on October 3, 2016, at 6:30 p.m.\n\nAngel of Oblivion is your first novel. How did the writing process differ from your usual mode of storytelling (poetry)?\n\nOf course the novel required a longer breath, and is composed of more voices. I researched for a long time and searched for the correct form, which also includes lyrical elements. The greatest challenge was finding a language and mode of storytelling for both the political as well as the personal, that made it possible for me to aptly represent the complexity of this story, which is also my own.\n\nYou write in Slovenian as well as German. What made you choose to write this novel in German? Are there certain themes that lend themselves more to a specific language?\n\nUntil I began my professional career as a dramaturg, I wrote poetry in Slovenian and made an effort to publish a Slovenian literary magazine in Carinthia. After I began working the focus shifted. In the daily grind of the theater I had to check my own writing at the door; but my identity as a Slovenian author also became unhinged. All of my notes were composed in German; German became the language I used in my profession, but also in my daily routine. When I began thinking about writing this novel, I realized I would write it in German. This decision also helped me to keep a certain distance from the story I was telling. Generally I believe, all themes can be described in all living languages.\n\nCould you please elaborate on your family history, which led to the writing of this novel and on the autobiographical aspects of the book?\n\nI grew up with many of the stories that are told in the novel; and researched many more. The autobiographical forms the foundation upon which the rest of the novel is constructed. I fictionalized the events and sequences – it would not have worked any other way; my intention wasn’t to write a personal field report. I wanted to show how war continues to have an effect on people and what it means to grow up amongst damaged people. The historical facts are however all fact-based.\n\nHow was the collaboration with the translator Tess Lewis? Was it difficult conveying your message in a language that doesn’t have the same direct relation to your subject matter?\n\nThe collaboration with Tess, who has a deep sensitivity for the story, was wonderful. She always asked, if she was uncertain about something, and I relied on her literary sensibility and abilities. That’s is perhaps the most important thing when it comes to a collaboration like this. The connection to the material develops through the work, but with Tess I felt from the very beginning that I could trust her completely.\n\nYou worked as a dramaturg at the Municipal Theater of Klagenfurt for 15 years. Last year Angel of Oblivion had its premiere at the Akademietheater in Vienna. Was it difficult reworking your own novel for the stage (as opposed to other writers’ novels)?\n\nI knew it would be a very different process from what I was used to, and I decided to work very closely with the director. The stage demands a different kind of storytelling and has different requirements than a novel. On the one hand, playing with the material of the novel and carving out specific focal points brought me joy. On the other hand it pained me, because I had to edit out large chunks of the novel. Working on the stage version of Angel of Oblivion was quite a challenge. But then the energy of the actors and the stage came in to play, and everything began to live and breathe again, albeit in a somewhat altered form.\n\nDo you have concrete plans for how you would like to spend your residency in New York? Will you take advantage of the cultural scene or do you plan on focusing on your writing and working on some future project?\n\nI would like to use this time to work on my future projects and to clear my head. I was very happy to realize that this is very much a possibility in New York. The translation of Angel of Oblivion has just appeared with Archipelago Books, and I will take this opportunity to participate in several literary events. (You can find details about these events here.)\n\nDeutsches Haus at NYU presents Little Miss Liberty Crossing the Delaware, an exhibition by the painter Regina Baumhauer. Please join us for the exhibition opening on September 6, 2016, at 6:30 p.m. Opening remarks will be held by Judith Reicherzer, journalist and media educator, Luxembourg.\n\n© Joanne Dugan\n\nEmanuel Leutze’s painting “Washington Crossing the Delaware” (1851) depicts an iconic scene from one of the pivotal battles in the American Revolutionary War (1775-1783). When did you first encounter this painting, what does it mean to you, and how did it come to inspire your new series of work?\n\n“Man sieht nur das, was man weiss.” - ”You only see what you know.” (Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (1749-1832).\n\nFirst encounter:\n\nAt an early age I used to hang out with my grandfather, “Opa Alois Baumhauer”. Grandpa was an artist and a jewelry designer who loved to draw. When you would spend time with him, he would always take out his treasures and would tell you stories he loved best. We would savor his art books, we would paint and draw together, and Grandpa would tell me about ‘Der Ring des Niebelungen’ (Richard Wagner’s Opera Cycle), which scared me at times - and his favorite artists like Adolf von Menzel ( 1815-1905), or Emanuel Leutze, a Schwaebisch Gmuend born artist (1816 - 1868).\n\n“He lived both: in America and in Germany,” at that time I had no clue what Opa meant. “You could find his huge paintings in Washington”, he used to say. I was not so sure whether to believe this or not, but I could tell my Grandpa wanted to emphasize that he really appreciated this guy….\n\nSecond encounter:\n\nIn 8th Grade I found Emanuel Leutze’s painting ‘Washington Crossing the Delaware’ (1851) in my history book at school and recognized the painting as being of one of Opa’s favorite artists right away!\n\nThird encounter:\n\nDuring my scholarship year at Boston University (1986/87) I took the opportunity to visit New York City with its exciting sites, museums, galleries and artist’s hang outs. It is there that I suddenly got hooked on “Washington Crossing the Delaware.”\n\nThis painting both provided many answers and evoked even more questions! And yes, I felt strangely connected not only because Emanuel Leutze and I shared the same hometown, but also because this painting connected my childhood memories with my young adult life abroad.\n\nI suddenly understood: This painting was not only a celebration of the liberty of a young nation but also provided hope and courage in the ‘Old World’ despite the failed German revolution of 1848!\n\nI really liked this sophisticated bilateral, yes even global idea!\n\nBy painting the “ Open Letter, Little Miss Liberty Crossing the Delaware” series, the bridge was built to remind every single viewer of Leutze’s message and at the same time leading to our situation today.\n\n“We live in a world where information can be shared worldwide within seconds.” My Open-Letter-Topic reminds the viewer of our global situation through every painting of mine since 1993/94. How could one possibly believe that a wall could make sense if we all sit in the same global boat? Since 9/11 we came to understand that Miss Liberty is still strong and determined but vulnerable. As I realized that Emanuel Leutze’s anniversary and the election year came together in 2016 I decided to start the “Open Letter, Little Miss Liberty Crossing the Delaware” Series in 2014.\n\nBoth you and Emanuel Leutze were born in Schwaebisch Gmuend and moved to the U.S. Are there other biographical similarities between the two of you that might have influenced your new series?\n\nNot only did both of us live during a critical young age abroad, but also did we both use this opportunity to study the familiar through the unknown.\n\nCould you elaborate on the title of the exhibition. “Little Miss Liberty Crossing the Delaware”?\n\nWhen crossing (…) we are leaving the familiar behind. We expose ourselves to the unknown. We risk everything - we also risk failure. We do this anyway since this is the only way to reach new frontiers. Children are the most creative people. They are not afraid to leave the familiar behind. They are not afraid to fail. They playfully enjoy what they do. They are Little Miss Liberty’s best friends.\n\nYour work includes a wide range of techniques, materials and mediums often combining painting, printmaking, drawing and even embroidery in a single piece. How did you develop this approach, and when do you know when each piece is “finished”?\n\nI learned from my best friends how to handle things that are most important to me. Playfulness is key in all my endeavors. It enables me to cross lines. I play only by my own rules. Wonder and curiosity are important ingredients. When harmony strikes, I’m happy and the piece is complete.\n\nYou spend your life between Schwaebisch Gmuend and New York - two places that are at opposite ends of a spectrum. How do these two places influence your artistic process? Is there work you can only imagine doing in Schwaebisch Gmuend versus New York or vice versa? Why?\n\nI share a larger studio space in Schwaebisch Gmuend than I can use in New York City. Therefore I can work on different pieces at the same time in Schwaebisch Gmuend. I even have the means to accomplish objects there.\n\n“My brain works the same way here or there.”\n\nBut you can find a ‘tougher playfulness’ in the city that never sleeps. It is here that I come up with the most potential ideas. I can plan my work and then go to where I find the right conditions to accomplish it.\n\nWhere do you draw inspiration from? Which other artists have influenced you?\n\nInspirations lie in the smallest things: A sound, a smell, a sentence, a smile … anything can spark imagination. My work is very personal. I talk only about things I have made my own through observations, experiences, dreams …\n\nThe ‘Bauhaus-idea’ is important to me.\n\nAs a young student abroad I was struck by the freshness and energy of the Abstract Expressionism that put NYC at the center of the Western Art World.\n\nThese artists made warehouses in SOHO their studios and worked with brooms as brushes …I was fascinated and loved the work by Willem de Kooning and especially Franz Kline, but realized early on, that I had to leave all this behind to find myself.\n\nFor your solo show at the Musseum im Prediger, you also designed a jewelry line, inspired by Emanuel Leutze. How was it working in this new medium,and how did you go about creating these designs? Are there other media which you would like to pursue in the future?\n\nCreating things always ‘works’ the same way for me: You have an idea, and to express it you have to find the material that shows best what you want to say. Work on paper is the heart of all my projects. Drawing is thinking. The best craftspeople helped to find excellence in this new field.\n\nJakob Brossmann is the co-recipient of the Erste Bank’s MoreVALUE Film Award, which he received for Lampedusa in Winter at the 2015 Viennale. On the occasion of his one-month residency at Deutsches Haus at NYU, we co-present together with Anthology Film Archives, Erste Bank, and the Austrian Cultural Forum three screenings of Lampedusa in Winter (2015), from Friday August 19, through Sunday, August 21, at 7:30 p.m. Jakob Brossmann will be present for an audience Q&A and to discuss his work. We hope you join us, and enjoy our interview with the filmmaker.\n\nDeutsches Haus at NYU: What inspired you to focus your first feature-length documentary on Lampedusa, a small Italian island in the Mediterranean Sea? What made you choose to film there in winter?\n\nJakob Brossmann: I was dealing with questions of refuge and migration from the perspective of Austrian history (at the time, I was working on a short screenplay about Austrian refugees being pushed back by the Swiss army in the 1940s) when the Arab spring brought a larger number of people to Lampedusa, and the island was mentioned for the first time in Austrian news headlines. I realized that the questions are not that different, although there are many years in between the events. But then I realized that in the news headlines you always see one type of image, a very focused one, and that is the repeated image of the overcrowded migrant boat coming towards the camera. Lampedusa became a buzzword, but the life of the island itself was never described. It took some time until I realized that there was something missing: the life of the welcoming (or not-welcoming) society. And in this void, in this space that was left, I observed the beginning of horrible fantasies, and the onset of the daily announcements of the new arrivals triggered a vision of life under terrible circumstances. I wanted to fill this gap, and to show the life of the people that live in this place, which is probably the place that is most influenced by migration and refuge in the world. For 20 years people have been arriving there. I decided to shoot there in winter, because then the island is kind of thrown back to its own problems. In a very short period in the summer, when tourists come to Lampedusa, the whole island is very much focused on welcoming them, and giving them an extraordinary experience. It’s like a big celebration. I often describe Lampedusa as a person getting ready for a big ball. Summer is this ball, and there is no time to think about ones problems and confront them. But in the winter, the isolation, and the bad weather conditions, confront the people with their island existence, and the questions they are confronted with all the time. In winter they cannot escape these questions.\n\nDH: Did you go to Lampedusa with a specific story in mind, or was the filmmaking process a more intuitive one?\n\nJB: I came to Lampedusa with a question about how the life of the people there is influenced, or not influenced, by the arrival of migrants, and by the encounters with refugees. I realized very early on in the research process, that the island has a lot of problems that have nothing to do with migration and refugees, and I wanted to describe one example of these problems, and how the Lampedusa people deal with them, in this situation, that’s under so much pressure and attention. And of course I couldn’t foresee that the ferry would burn down, there were a lot of things that I couldn’t foresee. At first, when that happened, I was afraid that it would slow us down, and then I realized that it would actually help us to tell the story we had in mind. So the ferry very much became a symbol, and it helped us a lot, because it made a lot of the struggle of the Lampedusa people visible.\n\nDH: In your film you focused on individual aspects of island life: a soccer team, a radio station, the plight of the local fishermen, and of course the mayor. Why did you choose this approach, and were there themes or threads that you would have liked to include, but that didn’t pan out?\n\nJB: I was asking myself: “what is very specific about Lampedusa?” There are a lot of stories that one could have told that are typical of a lot of islands, but I tried to combine both the aspects that are typical for Lampedusa, and those that make it possible for us, as outsiders, to connect to that life. I was asking myself who are the people, and what are the realities that can describe them. So there is for example the coming and going of reporters, and those different personalities that you can find only on Lampedusa. We as a team decided very early on that we didn’t want to go into the most private aspects of the lives of the people. It could have been an approach as well, and there are other filmmakers that decided to go that way, but we didn’t want to go inside the families or inside the private relationships, but to be in the semi-public, and public places where this very small society of just 5000 people is negotiating their approach, and their way of dealing with those problems.\n\nOn the one hand 90 minutes is a long period of time, on the other hand it’s so limited, so there are a lot of small details and big stories from the history of Lampedusa that I couldn’t include in the film. Especially because we made a conscious decision not to do interviews in a place where the inhabitants are probably one of the most interviewed in the world. I realized that interviews often lead to a kind of repetitive formula. In an interview people always tell their versions of the story, and project how they want themselves to be seen in the context. But accompanying and observing with the camera, the viewers will come to their own conclusions about the people they see in the film, and it requires more of the audience. With interviews, the audience is being told how to react; everything is prepared in small emotional messages; while in observational filmmaking, the viewers are confronted with the ambiguity, and the non-linearity, of life, and its contradictions.\n\nDH: Could you speak a bit about the filmmaking process? With such an extremely diverse “cast” of characters, how did you go about communicating with each other, and conveying the message you wanted to instill in the film? How were you able to establish the kind of mutual trust that is important in a project such as Lampedusa in Winter?\n\nJB: We worked very closely as a team with Stefania Schenk Vitale, who is an interpreter specializing in film, and who is in New York with me at the Erste Bank MehrWERT Prize Residency at Deutsches Haus at NYU. We worked in several set-ups, with livewires and so on, and Stefania became a kind of director’s assistant, and a close co-developer of the stories. Basically we learned that a balance of understanding and not understanding each other could help in getting to know the protagonists on a different level. There are scenes I decided to shoot without an interpreter, and scenes that couldn’t have been possible without her. It’s a fundamental question in observational documentary filmmaking, how to interact, and how the interaction continues while shooting. We became very close with almost all of our protagonists, and tried to go through a process where they also understood what it is that we’re doing. So it’s not so much a question of language, but also of trust. And in terms of trust, the discourse in documentary filmmaking is mostly how you can win over the trust of your protagonists, but I believe that the trust that you, as the filmmaker, have in your protagonists is much more important. Because if you don’t trust someone to be of importance, that the story of someone is interesting and worth being told, you will never develop a relationship that can conclude in a story.\n\nDH: For how long did you work on Lampedusa in Winter?\n\nJB: I started in the summer of 2011, and visited Lampedusa for the first time in February 2012. From then on I spent three winters on the island, and one year of editing with Nela Märki, who shaped the film in a lot of ways.\n\nDH: Have you revisited Lampedusa since the completion of your film? How have the island and its inhabitants changed since then?\n\nJB: Lampedusa, to paraphrase a Sicilian author, ‘changes all the time and stays the same.’ There were big protests again this winter, by even more Eritrean asylum seekers, because the question of fingerprints has still not been solved, and Lampedusa had become one of the first so-called hot spots in the EU. At the same time, more and more big military vessels moved into the area, and the search and rescue area has moved even further south, so there is also somewhat less pressure on the island. Coincidentally, since we went away and stopped shooting, there were also big media hypes surrounding the island. The media attention has started to especially change the relationships of the people of Lampedusa with each other, because of one getting more attention than another, and so on. But the island’s basic contradiction, and the way Lampedusani people are trying to deal with it, has remained the same. The culture of infrastructural deficit on the periphery is not solved, and the people of Lampedusa still feel unrecognized and abandoned with their situation, while migration is the number one topic in Europe today. One thing, however, I never heard on Lampedusa is: “stop helping the refugees.” One of the most important lines in the film for me is: “why don’t you do for us, what you did for the refugees?” It’s not “help us and don’t help them” – which might be the populist central European solution - but its something else. Sometimes I have the feeling that the Lampedusani people see themselves as unequal siblings to the refugees. The islanders have their tensions, but they also have understanding for the refugees, and their own way of solidarity.\n\nDH: Have you shown the film on Lampedusa? What was the response?\n\nJB: Yes. We showed the film to our protagonists immediately after wrapping up, but last week we showed the film publicly for the first time on Lampedusa, and the reactions were very good. The Lampedusani people are very unhappy with how their island is depicted in the media and in some films, but they were very happy with our film, because they could connect to the way their struggle is described in it. To show the film at its place of origin was very emotional for me.\n\nDH: What are your thoughts on how the refugee crisis is portrayed in the media, and what are your wishes for the refugee policy of Europe?\n\nJB: Most of the time, I experience the depiction of refugees either as victims or as perpetrators. This definitely leads to a wrong perception, because they are simply people, humans, and that brings me to the big question of how I wish Europe should deal with those humans. One thing is very important: we should not think about asylum as a kind of mercy. It’s not that we take them in because they are so nice and so cute, or because we are so generous, it’s a basic human right, and by cutting it down, as is happening right now, we’re harming all of us: every human right lost is a danger to all of us. The central thing, which is very seldomly spoken about, is the need for secure migration routes. By pushing the people into more dangerous, more criminal routes, the people are suffering not only from the danger itself, but also from losing trust in authorities and in the justness of the west, that is always portraying itself as this just and enlightened place. Providing safe immigration routes would help us to connect in another way; not only to those who arrive, but also to the rest of the world, and the people arriving would be less physically and mentally harmed. They would bring more financial resources that could help them start a good life, and that would help them to integrate. But this can only work if we realize that Europe and the first world need to come to a point where there is solidarity within, not only with the people outside of Europe. As long as European countries are competing with each other by any means, there will be no solidarity in welcoming and supporting refugees.\n\nDH: Would you like to elaborate on your dedication of Lampedusa in Winter to Europe?\n\nJB: Lampedusa shows us that with the arrival of migrants, our lives in Europe aren’t coming to an end. The island of Lampedusa has been living with the question for twenty years, and as the film shows, the big questions of our time are not necessarily connected to migration or to refugees. Those questions should not be confronted with fear, and not as a security issue, but as a humanitarian one.\n\nDH: Could you tell us what you are currently working on? What do you plan on doing in New York during your one-month residency?\n\nJB: Lampedusa in Winter has been travelling for a year now—from Locarno all around Europe, to Australia—so I travelled a lot as well, and now I hope to collect new impressions, to recover a bit, and to find new inspiration. While in New York, I will visit Ellis Island for sure, and also look towards the city as an example of a success story of multicultural development.\n\nMy next project in Austria is going to be a film that will be focused on the very center of our society, unlike Lampedusa in Winter, which was focused on the periphery of Europe. The project will similarly to Lampedusa in Winter observe and accompany people who are often confronted with the role of the media in our society.\n\nClaudia Larcher is the co-recipient of the Erste Bank’s MoreVALUE Film Award, which she received for self at the 2015 Viennale. On the occasion of her one-month residency at Deutsches Haus at NYU, we co-present with Anthology Film Archives, Erste Bank, and the Austrian Cultural Forum a Show & Tell program on July 21 at 7:30 pm of her short films, including self (2015). We hope you join us, and enjoy our interview with the filmmaker.\n\n© Ian Ehm\n\nCould you explain a little how you come up with the concepts for your video art, or is the process always a different one?\n\nUsually it starts with a topic or a research question that interests me, e.g. the experience of the uncanny in film and literature, how an interior space may convey something about the personality of its inhabitants, and the significance of the skin as part of one’s identity?\n\nThen I start doing research, actually not yet knowing if I will produce a video work, an object, photographs or an installation. I choose the media that fits best to communicate my ideas. A lot of my projects are ongoing, meaning that I complete a series of work over the years and put them in new dialogues with each other.\n\nIn “Self” you focus not on interiors, but on skin, creating an impressive tracking shot over a landscape of magnified body parts. What sparked the idea to connect this sort of abstract concept of “the self” with the image of the human skin, and particularly this magnified view?\n\nfilm still self\n\nFor me the perception of one’s own skin is always somehow a magnified one. Usually you become aware of your own skin only when there is something wrong with it. Then you use a looking glass or a magnifier to find for example a scratch or a mole, or you discover a wrinkle that wasn’t there before. We try to cover up and make up our skin to present an ideal version of ourselves, or to approach the manipulated look that we know from the media and advertisements. So I also use techniques of manipulation in my work. I create videos and photographs that seem to show reality, because they use real images, but by using the technique of collage I create something surreal and new. With the video “self” I wanted to show that we all live in these elastic skin bags that we use to communicate with and we build identity with. And that we are also these nude animals that transpire, gurgle and vibrate.\n\nCould you speak a bit about the role of sound in your video art? You closely collaborate with Constantin Popp (e.g. on Empty Rooms, and Self). What does this collaboration look like? How do you record, edit, and manipulate the sound in order for it to become a part of the final piece?\n\nI got to know Constantin during a project called “TanzMedienAkademie” that took place during the Kunstfest Weimar, Germany in 2008. We both worked on the same project and got to know each others working practices and preferences quite well. We realized that we have similar views on performance and contemporary arts and got along very well. So I asked him for soundtracks for my video works from time to time. Or in the case of “Empty Rooms”, he provided his composition as a basis for my video work that I created as a response to the audio material. Usually we communicate only by Email and Skype, as he is based in Manchester and I’m in Vienna. It is funny, because he uses sounds very similarly as I use images. We both work with montages and collages. I usually use site- specific material, like pictures and videos that I record on site as well as on-site audio recordings. Similar to that Constantin does field recordings for his audio compositions or creates his sounds live on stage, using analog materials like, shells, stones and metals. I like the idea that sound is an art form in and of itself and in combination with visual moving images creates a dialogue or a contrast rather than illustrating the image.\n\nfilm still heim\n\nYou have a fine art background and have shown your work in galleries as well as cinemas. What are the main differences of showing your films in these different spaces? What do you want the different audience members and visitors to take away?\n\nWhat I like in the cinema space is that you have the undivided attention of the audience from beginning to end. This is quite important for my narrative video works like “Heim” and “Empty Rooms”. And of course the brilliant quality of a digital projection as well as the possibilities of 5.1 audio are usually very rare in exhibitions spaces.\n\nThe possibility of an upside down projection or projections in the form of an installation can only be found in the exhibition space. Therefore I produce videos, which work as loops that are not necessarily watched from beginning to end. Moreover it is only possible to show multichannel works or the movement of the spectator in the space to change the viewing angle in a gallery.\n\nIn my gallery work it is more about the awareness of the space itself that I try to communicate to my audience. In the cinema I create a supposed narration, questioning the meaning of reality and fiction.\n\nfilm still empty rooms\n\nWhat fascinates you about Billy Roisz “darkroom”, (which will be shown alongside your short films at Anthology Film Archives)? Why did you choose this piece, and do you see similarities between her work and yours?\n\nI already admired Billy’s work when I was a student at university. What is really fascinating is that she generates the image directly out of the sound that she either produces by herself with feedbacks or an instrument or that was created by an artist friend, such as Dieter Kovacic or Peter Kutin. I see similarities not in the aesthetics that she uses but rather in the topics. In Darkroom you see fragments of spaces that are somehow uncertain and uncanny. So I think dealing with the concept of the uncanny e.g. is a topic that interests me too.\n\nWhat other artists and filmmakers are some of the main influences and inspirations for your work?\n\nI love the movies of Claire Denis, Hitchcock and David Lynch. Maya Deren and her surrealistic experimental film work was a big inspiration during my studies. As an artistic inspiration from the aspect of fine arts I refer to Louise Bourgeois and Kiki Smith as well as to projects by Friedrich Kiesler and the “Merzbau” by Kurt Schwitters.\n\nCould you tell us, what you are currently working on? As an artist interested in spaces (architectural and otherwise), how does it feel to stay in New York City? Will you use your residency to explore the themes of architecture, home and identity, or are you tempted to produce something else entirely?\n\nNew York is just great and was always on my list as a destination to do research and to collect material for new works in. Apart from all the art that is around I am interested in how people and the city deal with issues such as social discrepancies, gentrification etc. So I was thinking about researching shared and common spaces in Manhattan amidst a city development driven by new housing projects for rather privileged people. It seems that there is both a lot of conflict and creativity in the definition of who owns the public space. So what I am working on now are little video clips with short length of 10 to 20 seconds – something like “miniatures of a city”."
