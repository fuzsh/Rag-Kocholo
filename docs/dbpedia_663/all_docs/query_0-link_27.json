        "text": "It's valuable to be reminded what a good artist Kathe Kollwitz was. The achievement of this German printmaker (1867-1945), the subject of a large exhibition at Galerie St. Etienne, often gets lost in the extreme popularity of her best-known work: the harrowing yet sentimental images of suffering mothers and children, rendered in broad, somewhat expressionistic strokes, which she began producing in the 1920's.\n\nAnd as with female artists like Georgia O'Keeffe and Frida Kahlo, judgment is further confused by the fascination of Kollwitz's life story, a confusion increased by the close resemblance between the stoic broad-cheeked faces of the artist's late style and her own appearance. Like those of many of her subjects, Kollwitz's life encompassed a high quotient of suffering, courage and almost saintlike goodness. She lost one of two sons in World War I, and a grandson in World War II. The grim social conditions chronicled in her art got her into trouble with the government of Kaiser Wilhelm II; during the Nazi era, she lost her teaching position and was banned from exhibiting her work.\n\nKollwitz's innate social conscience, sharpened by the work of her husband, a doctor who opened a clinic in the slums of Berlin in 1891, was reflected both in her sympathetic depictions of peasants and the urban poor and in her choice of medium. She preferred prints because their austere tones and surfaces were less frivolous than painting, and because they could be bought at relatively inexpensive prices by greater numbers of people.\n\nIn contrast to all this, the exhibition of 76 prints and drawings that St. Etienne has organized on the 125th anniversary of the artist's birth tends to play down Kollwitz as a paradigm of political rectitude, offering instead an engrossing portrait of the artist at work.\n\nJuxtaposing working drawings and finished prints, as well as different states of the same print, it shows that Kollwitz was as sensitive to the nuance of technique and material as to social injustice. It enables the viewer to retrace and even second-guess Kollwitz's esthetic decisions, exploring what made her carefully worked-out compositions so formally powerful. (This approach is similar to that taken by a more ambitious overview of Kollwitz's work at the National Gallery of Art in Washington last summer.)\n\nIt also presents her as a perfectionist who sometimes worked the life out of her images. For example, the working drawing for \"Death Seizes the Children of 1934\" is far more spontaneous and effective than the stiffer, darker and more conventionally foreboding lithographs that succeeded it.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
