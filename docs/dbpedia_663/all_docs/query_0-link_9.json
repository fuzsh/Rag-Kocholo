His style was highly influential, and he was soon considered one of the most important printmakers of the 19th century.\n\nIn the 1850s, Menzel began to focus more on painting, producing works such as \"The Iron Rolling Mill\" and \"The Flute Concert of Frederick the Great\". He also created a number of portraits, including a self-portrait. These works demonstrated his mastery of light, shade and composition, and further increased his reputation as one of the great painters of the era.\n\nMenzel was also a prolific draftsman and lithographer. He published numerous portfolios of his drawings and prints, and also wrote a book on the subject of drawing. This book provided insight into his creative process, and helped to further popularize his style.\n\nThroughout his life, Menzel was highly respected by his peers and he maintained a successful career until his death in 1905.
