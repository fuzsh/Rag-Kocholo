        "text": "Introduction\n\nIn late 2007, the National Gallery of Art acquired 120 German old master drawings from one of the finest private collections in Europe, assembled by Wolfgang Ratjen (1943–1997), who lived primarily in Munich and Liechtenstein. One of the most perceptive collectors of the last century, Ratjen selected his drawings with great energy and discernment over the course of thirty years.\n\nThe drawings, created between 1580 and 1900, epitomize the work of artists from German- speaking lands (Germany and Austria as well as parts of Switzerland and central Europe). Sixteenth- and seventeenth-century drawings of religious and mythological subjects echo the courtly taste for sophistication and elegance. An impressive selection of dynamic, ornate watercolors for church ceilings and altarpieces expresses the piety and faith of the baroque and rococo eras. The later eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries are represented with romantic visions of the natural world. Directly observed studies and portraits characterize the realism that followed.\n\nThe Ratjen Collection includes works of extraordinary quality and rarity by draftsmen such as the early seventeenth-century artist Adam Elsheimer, the Bavarian landscape painter Johann Georg von Dillis, the romantics Caspar David Friedrich and Philipp Otto Runge, the architect Karl Friedrich Schinkel, and the realist Adolph Menzel. The collection as a whole complements the National Gallery's holdings of German drawings, which are already strong in works from the Middle Ages, the Renaissance, and the early modern era. With this acquisition, made possible by the generosity of a dozen donors, the Gallery now has the finest and most comprehensive survey of German graphic art outside Europe.\n\nApollo, god of sun and music, prevails with his stringed instrument against the simpler pipes of Pan, guardian of shepherds and their flocks, in a musical contest judged by the mountain god Tmolus high on the rock. King Midas, standing to the right, objects to the decision and points instead to Pan as the victor. In retaliation for his mistake, Apollo gives Midas the ears of an ass, here placed on his head by a descending putto. This popular subject from Ovid's Metamorphoses may be understood as an allegory on artistic judgment, emphasizing \"high\" art over lowly genres, or the frequent misunderstanding of art by wealthy patrons.\n\nAccording to the Old Testament story, Habakkuk was grabbed by an angel of the Lord while on his way to delivering a meal to reapers in his field. The angel carried him off to Babylon to give the food instead to Daniel, who was imprisoned in a lion's den. Baumgartner surrounded the story with an ornate frame into which are placed small genre scenes related to preparing, cooking, and consuming food. The design was engraved as part of a cycle on the times of day; it symbolizes midday.\n\nZingg's virtuosic showpiece is a visual jest: what appears at first glance to be the sky is actually another landscape, upside down. When the drawing is turned on its head, the same effect occurs. The artist may have been studying possible landscape foregrounds and simply began drawing them, each from a different side, on the same sheet. Zingg then connected the two sides by working out details, even the play of light, with great refinement, using the monochrome palette that became fashionable in late eighteenth-century German landscape drawings.\n\nThe medium of watercolor flourished in Munich at the beginning of the nineteenth century thanks to the efforts of landscape artists such as Johann Georg von Dillis and Wagenbauer. The latter was among the first to take the foothills of the Bavarian Alps as his subject matter, searching for scenic motifs such this small, remote lake, known as the Blue Pool, on hiking trips. Originally formed through a series of landslides that dammed a river, the lake no longer exists; it was filled in with sediment by another landslide in 2005.\n\nBefore his early death cut short the promise of a brilliant career, Runge had hoped to establish a new foundation for the art of landscape, using allegory to comprehend man's place in nature and in the divine order of the cosmos. The lily — symbol of innocence and purity — was one of Runge's favorite motifs. Dynamic, swelling lines capture the organic vitality of this flower, which opens and closes with the emergence and disappearance of light. The stalk displays blooms, a bud, and a stem with pistil after the petals have fallen off, offering a reflection on nature's process of growth and decay.\n\nFriedrich was the most important German landscape artist of the nineteenth century. His work epitomizes north German romanticism, which was distinguished by a spiritual attachment to nature. This watercolor is one of his finest examples in the medium, showing an exquisite sense of coloring and light, especially in the ethereal blue of the sky and the delicate rendering of fog clustered in the folds of the mountain. The work suggests meditative stillness at a hushed moment before dawn. Empty of human figures, the scene nonetheless contrasts the human activity evident in the plowed field with the immensity of mountains and sky.\n\nFrom the mid-eighteenth century, excavations of ancient tombs in southern Italy had brought to light large quantities of ceramic vases and other antiquities, which were eagerly collected by Italian residents as well as visitors from other countries. Götzloff rendered the vessels here with archaeological accuracy: several of them have been identified, including the tall amphora painted with two rows of red figures (now in the Pergamon Museum, Berlin). The vase was in the collection of an Austrian baron then living in Naples, who likely commissioned this watercolor as a souvenir of his stay."
