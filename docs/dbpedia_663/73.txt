Adolf von Menzel (born December 8, 1815, Breslau, Prussia [now Wrocław, Poland]—died February 9, 1905, Berlin) was a German painter and printmaker, best known in his own day as a brilliant historical painter, whose patriotic works satisfied the public’s taste, engendered by Prussia’s continual expansion throughout the 19th century, for propagandistic art. In the 20th century he was chiefly esteemed for his sensitive treatment of light and the original compositions of his small genre pictures.

In 1832 Menzel took charge of his dead father’s lithographic workshop and, self-taught, rapidly became famous in this medium by illustrating various histories of Prussia, especially those dealing with the reign of Frederick II the Great. These were followed by illustrations for similar publications, such as a lavish edition of Works of Frederick the Great (1843–49) containing 200 plates. In painting Menzel soon became famous for his glittering re-creations of such scenes as Frederick the Great’s concerts at his palace, Sanssouci, and The Ball Supper (1878), showing the court of King Wilhelm I vigorously enjoying a meal.
