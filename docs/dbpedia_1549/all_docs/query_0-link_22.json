Among the earliest changes in AD is endosomal enlargement in neurons, which was reported as enhanced in ApoE4 carriers. ApoE is thought to be internalized into endosomes of neurons, whereas β-amyloid (Aβ) accumulates within neuronal endosomes early in AD. However, it remains unknown whether ApoE and Aβ intersect intracellularly. We show that internalized astrocytic ApoE localizes mostly to lysosomes in neuroblastoma cells and astrocytes, whereas in neurons, it preferentially localizes to endosomes–autophagosomes of neurites. In AD transgenic neurons, astrocyte-derived ApoE intersects intracellularly with amyloid precursor protein/Aβ. Moreover, ApoE4 increases the levels of endogenous and internalized Aβ42 in neurons. Taken together, we demonstrate differential localization of ApoE in neurons, astrocytes, and neuron-like cells, and show that internalized ApoE intersects with amyloid precursor protein/Aβ in neurons, which may be of considerable relevance to AD.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe apolipoprotein E (ApoE) allele exists as three major isoforms in humans: ApoE2, ApoE3, and ApoE4, with ApoE3 being the most common form, followed by ApoE4. ApoE4 is the most important genetic risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) (1, 2). In contrast, ApoE2 protects against AD. ApoE in the brain is made predominantly by astrocytes, but is also generated by microglia and under conditions of stress by neurons (3, 4). Although the most critical mechanism(s) by which ApoE4 raises the risk of AD remains to be determined, various hypotheses have been proposed. A tight correlation of ApoE4 with amyloid pathology is well known, but the mechanism(s) whereby ApoE4 impacts amyloid pathology in AD remains unclear. Previous research suggests a role of ApoE4 in the early stages of AD, before amyloid plaques (5, 6). The presence of ApoE4 increases the number of dystrophic neurites around plaques and affects initial plaque density, but does not appear to influence plaque load after initial plaque formation (5, 6), suggesting a role of ApoE4 in the early cellular phase of AD before amyloid plaques.\n\nEndosomal enlargement in neurons is one of the earliest changes associated with AD (7, 8). Postmortem brains from late-onset AD patients showed significantly enlarged neuronal endosomes compared with age-matched control brains (7), a finding that has also been described in vitro in IPSC-induced neurons from AD patients (9) and as induced by AD genetic risk factors (10, 11). The mean endosomal size was reported as even more increased in postmortem AD human brains from ApoE4 carriers compared with non-ApoE4 carriers, suggesting an enhancing effect of ApoE4 on endosomal enlargement (7). The exact mechanism(s) underlying endosome dysfunction in AD, in particular in relation to ApoE4, remains poorly understood. Experimental studies have reported endosomal dysregulation induced by ApoE4 and ApoE4-induced impairment in endosome recycling (12, 13, 14, 15). Added recombinant ApoE was described to localize in neurons to the endosomal system at Rab5-positive early endosomes and cathepsin D-positive late endosomes/lysosomes (16). However, studies on the endosomal localization of more physiological lipidated ApoE isoforms in neurons are lacking.\n\nBefore plaque formation, intraneuronal Aβ accumulates in endosomes (17, 18, 19), in particular, in late endosomal multivesicular bodies near synaptic compartments (18). In addition, BACE1-induced APP cleavage is favored under acidic pH conditions as present in endosomes (20), APP trafficking, and Aβ production occur in endosomes (11, 21, 22). As Aβ is generated (21, 23) and initially aggregates (18) in acidic endosomes, ApoE4 might facilitate the optimal conditions for Aβ production by blocking endosome recycling or provide a more favorable lipid environment for Aβ aggregation. ApoE was reported to trigger APP endocytosis and subsequent Aβ production after binding to ApoER2 receptors, with ApoE4 increasing Aβ production more than ApoE2 and ApoE3 (24). In vivo data also support an association of ApoE4 with increased neuron levels of Aβ, as human ApoE target replacement mice transduced with lentiviral Aβ1–42 showed increased intracellular Aβ deposition in ApoE4 compared with ApoE3 mouse brains (25). On the other hand, in another study, mouse brain knock-in with the different human ApoE isoforms did not reveal alterations in APP levels or processing (26), whereas crosses of AD transgenic with ApoE mice showed elevated intraneuronal Aβ with ApoE4 (27).\n\nIt is possible that internalized ApoE and APP and/or Aβ intersect and even interact within endosomes. ApoE localizes with high-molecular weight Aβ oligomers in the TBS-soluble fraction of human AD brain (28), and ApoE co-deposits with amyloid plaques (29), suggesting that ApoE and Aβ also co-localize at later stages of AD, but whether ApoE and APP/Aβ are intersecting at an intracellular level remains less clear. ApoE and antibody 4G8-positive Aβ/APP were reported to be present in the same cytoplasmic granules in postmortem AD brains (30), although the antibody used did not distinguish Aβ from its abundant precursor APP. A subsequent study using Aβ42 C-terminal-specific antibodies noted localization of ApoE to AD-vulnerable neurons with marked intraneuronal Aβ42 accumulation in human brains with early AD pathology (31). More recently, ApoE and Aβ were reported to be present in the same synapses of human AD brains (32, 33).\n\nDespite ApoE4 being established as the most important genetic risk factor for AD and neurons selectively degenerating in the disease, the subcellular localization of ApoE and its potential relation to Aβ/APP biology in neurons has not been explored. The aim of this study was to examine the subcellular localization of ApoE3 and ApoE4. In addition, the localization of the ApoE isoforms with intracellular Aβ/APP was examined. We demonstrate that internalized ApoE predominantly traffics to lysosomes in primary astrocytes and N2a neuroblastoma cells, but not in primary neurons where it localizes more to endosomes and autophagosomes of neurites. Furthermore, ApoE co-localized with Aβ/APP β-C-terminal fragments (APP-βCTFs), with ApoE4 treated-neurons showing more prominent intraneuronal Aβ.\n\nResults\n\nApoE is internalized into the endosome–lysosome system of N2a cells\n\nThe endosome–lysosome system is considered to be one of the earliest cellular sites affected in AD (7, 34, 35). ApoE4 was previously shown to impact neuronal endosomes, including endosomal recycling (12) and endosomal morphology (14); however, the subcellular biology of ApoE remains poorly studied. In order to better define the subcellular localization of ApoE, N2a neuroblastoma cells were initially treated with physiological levels (2.5 μg/ml) of recombinant human ApoE3 or ApoE4 for 15 min and 4 h ( ). After 4 h more, N2a cells internalized recombinant ApoE4 compared with ApoE3 ( and ). Specifically, ApoE3 was taken up by 23.0% and ApoE4 by 33.3% of N2a cells ( , P = 0.024). Moreover, ApoE4 treatment increased the median number of ApoE puncta per N2a cells by 33.4% compared with ApoE3 treatment ( , P = 0.034). The area of ApoE puncta in ApoE4-treated N2a cells showed an increasing trend, although this difference was not significant ( , P = 0.0767). The puncta of internalized recombinant ApoE showed a vesicle-like pattern ( ), consistent with the endosomal–lysosomal system, although interestingly, most of the ApoE labeling appeared polarized and near to the Golgi apparatus and microtubule-organizing center. Due to endogenous mouse ApoE expression by N2a cells and the fact that the ApoE antibody 16H22L18 to some extent also detects mouse ApoE, we were unable to distinguish differences in ApoE in vehicle-treated N2a cells from human ApoE-treated cells at the shorter (15 min) time point (data not shown). For this reason, further characterization of human ApoE in neuronal cells was performed using the 4 h time point, at which time, the internalized ApoE was clearly above the lower endogenous mouse ApoE labeling.\n\nTo better define the presumed endosomal–lysosomal trafficking of internalized recombinant ApoE in N2a cells, we co-labeled ApoE-treated N2a cells for ApoE and subcellular markers. Due to the vesicle-like localization of ApoE, we started with analyzing ApoE co-localization with antibodies to LAMP1, a lysosomal marker, which also detects late endosomes and autophagosomes, and to Rab7, a late endosomal marker, which also can be detected in autophagosomes. At 4 h, 36% of internalized human ApoE3 and 30% of ApoE4 co-localized with LAMP1 (overlap of ApoE-positive pixels with LAMP1-positive pixels; and ), suggesting lysosome, late endosome, and/or autophagosome localization of internalized recombinant ApoE3 and ApoE4 in N2a cells. However, there was no statistically significant difference in ApoE and LAMP1 co-localization between ApoE3 and ApoE4 ( , P = 0.2744). In comparison with LAMP1, a lower proportion of human ApoE puncta co-localized with Rab7 in N2a cells after 4 h, although there was no significant difference between ApoE3 compared with ApoE4 ( ; P = 0.3392). We note that Rab7 labeling distributed more widely throughout the cell, whereas most ApoE and LAMP1 localized in the perinuclear region, likely near to the Golgi/microtubule organizing center. Overall, the LAMP1-positive, mostly Rab7-negative, co-labeling of internalized human ApoE suggests that human ApoE after 4 h has mostly trafficked beyond late endosomes to lysosomes in N2a cells. To assess whether internalized ApoE might also be transported to the Golgi apparatus, the presence of ApoE at the cis- and trans-Golgi apparatus was assessed. Despite preferential labeling of internalized ApoE3 and ApoE4 near to GM130-labeled cis-Golgi apparatus ( ), no clear direct co-localization was seen of human ApoE with the antibody against GM130 or with the trans-Golgi marker TGN38 ( ). Altogether, internalized recombinant ApoE3 and ApoE4 in N2a cells are most notably localized to lysosomes after 4 h incubation.\n\nAlthough recombinant ApoE is generally considered to be poorly lipidated, previous research suggests that cell media containing FBS can provide ApoE with lipids (36), and we note that our N2a cell media contain FBS. Because ApoE is the main lipid and cholesterol carrier in the brain, we next examined whether cholesterol localizes to similar subcellular compartments as ApoE. Interestingly, filipin, a dye staining free cholesterol, revealed that in N2a cells cholesterol, analogous to recombinant ApoE, localized to LAMP1-positive vesicles ( ).\n\nCellular trafficking of ApoE might however differ depending on the lipidation of ApoE. Therefore, we next studied the cellular localization of ApoE under more physiological conditions by using ApoE particles obtained from humanized ApoE3-knock-in or ApoE4-KI primary astrocytes (37). Note that these human ApoE-targeted replacement mice no longer express mouse ApoE. Astrocytes are the main source of ApoE in the brain (38) and astrocyte-derived ApoE is lipidated (39) and transported to other cell types including neurons. Human ApoE3 and ApoE4 astrocyte-conditioned media were collected from ApoE3- and ApoE4-KI mouse primary astrocytes and subsequently used to treat N2a cells for 4 h ( ). Human ApoE was readily detected by Western blot in media collected from ApoE3- and ApoE4-KI mouse astrocytes, but, as expected, not from ApoE KO astrocytes ( ), confirming ApoE3 and ApoE4 conditioned media as a useful source for human ApoE. Like recombinant human ApoE, added astrocyte-derived human ApoE3 and ApoE4 after 4 h co-localized substantially with LAMP1-positive vesicles in N2a cells ( and ), and showed lower levels of co-localization in the more numerous Rab7-positive late endosomes ( ). These findings confirm that internalized human ApoE3 and ApoE4, recombinant or derived from primary astrocytes, mostly traffics to lysosomes of N2a cells.\n\nInternalized ApoE in primary neurons preferentially localizes to endosomes and autophagosomes in neurites\n\nEven though N2a cells are considered to be neuron-like cells, their morphology and cellular physiology are quite different from mature neurons. To study the localization of astrocyte-derived human ApoE in mature primary neurons, the subcellular localization of human ApoE was examined after adding conditioned astrocyte ApoE3 or ApoE4 media to ApoE KO primary brain cultures for 4 h ( ). ApoE KO brain cultures were used to allow only the visualization of the subcellular localization of added astrocyte-derived human ApoE without the presence (and background signal) of endogenous mouse ApoE. Because in N2a cells both recombinant and astrocyte-derived ApoE localized mostly to LAMP1-positive vesicles ( ), we initially studied neuronal cell bodies, where lysosomes are predominantly located in neurons (40, 41, 42). Surprisingly, after 4 h of treatment internalized astrocyte-derived ApoE3 and ApoE4 localized only to a limited extent to neuronal cell bodies where, unlike N2a cells, ApoE was not found to co-localize with LAMP1-positive vesicles ( ; ApoE KO media control in ), suggesting limited trafficking of added astrocytic ApoE to lysosomes in neuron soma. Internalized human ApoE puncta were also not seen to overlap with Rab7 in neuronal soma ( ). Of note, most ApoE labeling near cell bodies actually appeared to be in the periphery and/or just outside the neuron cell soma.\n\nRemarkably, in primary neurons (DIV 19), most of the added astrocyte-derived ApoE after 4 h was seen in neurites rather than neuronal cell bodies ( ). In contrast to neuronal soma, added astrocytic ApoE3 and ApoE4 after 4 h were seen to be present in LAMP1-positive vesicles in neurites, which in our neurons should represent late endosomes and/or amphisomes ( ; ApoE KO media control in ) (43, 44). In line with this, the internalized human ApoE also partially co-localized with Rab7 in neurites ( ). However, the majority of added astrocytic ApoE did not co-localize with either LAMP1- or Rab7-positive puncta, highlighting other cellular site(s) of ApoE in neurites.\n\nSince internalized astrocytic ApoE3 and ApoE4 labeled in a vesicular pattern, the subcellular localization of ApoE in neurites was further studied using additional markers, with EEA1 to identify early endosomes, and LC3β to label autophagosomes. After 4 h, the added astrocytic ApoE was detected in both LC3β-positive autophagosomes ( ) and EEA1-positive early endosomes ( ) at comparable levels with LAMP1- and Rab7-positive vesicles ( ). Altogether, these findings suggest that astrocyte-derived ApoE, after internalization into primary neurons, is present in the endosome-autophagy system of neurites.\n\nSince levels of internalized ApoE in lysosomes of neuron soma were not as apparent as in N2a cells, we wondered whether this might also be caused by degradation of astrocyte-derived ApoE by neuronal lysosomes. To assess possible degradation of ApoE by lysosomes in neurons, we inhibited lysosomal degradation using 10 nM bafilomycin A1 (BafA1) starting 1 h before addition for 4 h of ApoE3 or ApoE4-conditioned media. BafA1 inhibits lysosomal function by blocking lysosomal acidification via v-ATPase (45, 46) ( ). The size of LAMP1-positive vesicles in neurites increased after addition of BafA1, suggesting that bafilomycin A1 was successfully blocking lysosomal function in our cultures ( ) (47). If ApoE is degraded by neuronal lysosomes, it would be expected that the co-localization of ApoE with LAMP1 would increase after bafilomycin A1 treatment. However, no significant change in ApoE–LAMP1 co-localization was detected after BafA1 treatment for either ApoE3 or ApoE4 ( ; median ApoE–LAMP1 co-localization after Baf A1: ApoE3 increased. from 5.2–9.8%, P = 0.0864; ApoE4 decreased from 8.7–6.3%, P = 0.4358). Moreover, no change in ApoE puncta size was detected after Baf A1 treatment in both ApoE3- and ApoE4-treated neurons ( , P = 0.7064), suggesting that lysosomal degradation in neurons is not a major pathway of internalized astrocyte-derived ApoE after 4 h of treatment. Although it is expected that internalized ApoE traffics to lysosomes within 4 h, to exclude that ApoE might require longer to reach lysosomes, 1 h of Baf1 A1 was followed by 8 h and 24 h of ApoE3 or ApoE4 co-treatment ( , respectively). However, ApoE could be hardly detected at these longer time points of Baf A1 treatment ( ). This further supports that ApoE is not degraded in lysosomes in neurons. Interestingly, most remaining ApoE-positive signal in our mixed primary cultures after long-term lysosome inhibition was detected in MAP2-negative cells ( ). Within these cells, ApoE puncta co-localized with LAMP1-positive vesicles ( , arrows), suggesting astrocyte degradation of ApoE.\n\nRemarkably, many ApoE puncta localized along MAP2-positive dendrites without co-localizing directly with MAP2, pointing towards synaptic localization. In line with our previous work on ApoE isoform effects on synapses (48), astrocyte-derived human ApoE3 and ApoE4 were seen to localize at or near dendritic spines indicated by F-actin marker phalloidin ( , arrows).\n\nAstrocyte-derived ApoE localizes to LAMP1-positive vesicles in primary astrocytes\n\nAlthough in MAP2-positive neurons some co-localization between internalized ApoE and LAMP1 was seen particularly in their neurites, we also observed that bright ApoE-positive puncta overlapped with LAMP1-positive vesicles in cells negative for the neuronal marker MAP2 ( ). Interestingly, in these MAP2-negative cells, ApoE particularly co-localized with LAMP1 even after long-term Baf A1 treatment ( ), suggesting that these MAP2-negative cells are degrading ApoE. Because MAP2 labels dendrites, antibody SMI-130 was used to assess whether this added human ApoE might be in axons. However, these strong ApoE-positive puncta did not clearly follow SMI-130 axonal labeling ( ) and therefore appeared not to be in axons.\n\nTo assess the presence of other cell types in our primary mouse brain cultures, which might relate to this strong extra-neuronal ApoE/LAMP1 labeling, the number of MAP2-positive neurons and GFAP-positive astrocytes were initially analyzed in relation to the DAPI nuclei present. 61% (4%) of all cells present in our cultures were positive for MAP2, indicative of neurons ( ). A minority of the cells in our cultures (8% ± 2%) labeled positive for GFAP, suggesting a minority of the cell population represents astrocytes. However, 30% (±3%) of all DAPI-nuclei were negative for MAP2 and GFAP. To further study other cell types, we labeled our WT primary brain cultures with antibodies to Iba1, to identify microglia, and CD140a, to label oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs). As expected in embryonic brain cell cultures, no Iba1-positive microglia were detected ( ). In contrast, there were numerous CD140a-positive OPCs ( ). To study whether the ApoE is internalized by astrocytes or OPCs, ApoE KO-mixed brain cultures were treated with ApoE3 and ApoE4 astrocyte-conditioned media and co-labeled for human ApoE and astrocyte marker S100β or OPC marker CD140a. Whereas added astrocytic ApoE was not clearly observed in CD140a-positive OPCs ( ), added human ApoE clearly localized to S100β-positive astrocytes ( ) in a similar pattern as seen for LAMP1 ( ). Thus, primary astrocytes present in our ApoE KO mouse brain cultures readily take up added astrocyte-derived human ApoE where it is detected prominently in LAMP1 vesicles. Interestingly, similar to neurons, internalized ApoE puncta were mostly detected in astrocytic processes rather than cell soma ( ).\n\nInternalized ApoE co-localizes with endogenous APP cleavage products in N2a cells and neurons\n\nPrevious research supports that intracellular Aβ is generated (21) and in AD accumulates (18) in the endosomal system, which internalized ApoE also accesses. To study whether internalized astrocyte-derived human ApoE and APP processing products intersect at an intracellular level, the cellular localization of human ApoE3 and ApoE4 was first examined in N2a cells overexpressing human APP containing the Swedish mutation (N2a APPSwe), which have abundant human APP/Aβ due to overexpression. N2a APPSwe cells were treated with ApoE KO, ApoE3 or ApoE4 astrocyte-conditioned medium for 4 h ( ) and subsequently co-labeled for human ApoE and antibody 82e1 directed at the N-terminus of human APP cleavage products Aβ and APP β-C-terminal fragment (APP-βCTF, also known as C99). Strong co-localization of ApoE and Aβ/APP-βCTF puncta were observed in N2a APPSwe cells treated with astrocyte-derived human ApoE3 and ApoE4 ( , arrows), but not in untransfected N2a cells or in APPSwe cells treated with ApoE KO-conditioned media ( ), supporting the conclusion that internalized human ApoE and endogenously produced APP metabolites Aβ/APP-βCTFs intersect intracellularly.\n\nAstrocytic ApoE was similarly internalized into LAMP1-positive late endosomes/lysosomes in untransfected N2a cells ( ) and N2a APPSwe cells ( , arrows), suggesting that the overexpression of human APP with the Swedish mutation in N2a cells does not alter the subcellular localization of human ApoE. To examine whether late endosomes/lysosomes are the subcellular compartments where human ApoE and Aβ/APP-βCTFs intersect, the cellular localization of antibody 82E1 Aβ/APP-βCTF-positive puncta was determined in N2a APPSwe cells. APP-βCTF/Aβ puncta were seen to overlap with LAMP1-positive puncta ( , arrows). Altogether, these data suggest that internalized astrocytic human ApoE intersects with APP metabolites Aβ/APP-βCTFs in late endosomal and/or lysosomal compartments in N2a cells.\n\nTo study whether ApoE and antibody 82e1-positive APP cleavage products Aβ/APP-βCTFs also co-localize in primary neurons, APP/PS1 transgenic neurons were treated with ApoE KO, ApoE3 or ApoE4 astrocyte media ( ). Remarkably, ApoE and Aβ/APP-βCTF-positive puncta were also localized together in human ApoE-treated APP/PS1 neurons ( and ), indicating that added ApoE and endogenous Aβ/APP-βCTFs also intersect in primary neurons. The number and size of endogenous human 82e1 antibody-positive Aβ/APP-βCTF puncta were not altered by ApoE isoform ( ; ApoE3-treated compared with ApoE4 82e1 puncta number: P = 0.5427; 82e1 puncta size: P = 0.5708). No difference in ApoE -82e1 co-localization was detected in astrocytic ApoE3- and ApoE4-treated APP/PS1 neurons ( ; about 8% of 82e1-positive pixels co-localized with ApoE pixels, P = 0.6382), suggesting that internalized astrocytic ApoE3 and ApoE4 co-localized with Aβ/APP-βCTF to a similar extent.\n\nTo further examine whether astrocytic ApoE intersects with Aβ in neurons, ApoE KO primary neurons were treated with both ApoE astrocyte-conditioned media and 0.5 μM synthetic Aβ42 ( ). After 4 h, ApoE and human Aβ42, labeled using the human-specific Aβ/APP antibody 6E10, both localized to MAP2-positive neurites ( and ) and co-localized along these neurites ( , white arrows). Interestingly, although similar ApoE and Aβ42 co-localization was noted after ApoE3 and ApoE4 treatment, larger fluorescent puncta of ApoE-Aβ42 were observed in ApoE4-treated neurons ( , white circle).\n\nAstrocyte medium but not ApoE genotype influences APP/Aβ levels in N2a APPSwe cells\n\nBecause human ApoE derived from primary astrocytes seems to intersect intracellularly with APP cleavage products Aβ/APP-βCTFs, we next examined by Western blot whether human ApoE affects the levels of APP metabolites and whether it does so in an ApoE isoform-dependent manner in astrocyte-conditioned media–treated N2a APPSwe cells ( ). Western blot showed that human APP and Aβ protein levels in N2a APPSwe cells and their media were not altered by the presence of the different ApoE astrocyte media after 15 min incubation ( ). After 4 h treatment, the time point where we observed internalized ApoE and Aβ/APP-βCTF co-localization ( ), APP and Aβ protein levels were also not altered in both N2a APPSwe lysate (APP: P = 0.5281; Aβ: P = 0.8427) and media (sAPPα: P = 0.9370; Aβ: P = 0.5861) as assessed by Western blot ( , blue panel; ). However, we noted using Western blot that full-length APP protein levels were significantly increased (P = 0.0162), whereas secreted sAPPα levels were significantly decreased (P = 0.0009) in N2a cells after 8 h astrocyte media treatment, independently of the presence of human ApoE ( , orange panel; ), because the addition of APOE KO astrocyte medium also induced this effect. This suggests that the presence of astrocyte-conditioned media itself, and not human ApoE, increases APP protein expression in N2a APPSwe cells. ApoE3 and ApoE4 astrocyte-conditioned media treatment did not significantly alter intracellular Aβ protein levels in N2a APPSwe cells ( ; P = 0.7347), whereas secreted Aβ levels were significantly increased ( ; 0.0151); a trend for elevated secreted Aβ level was also noted at 8 h with ApoE KO astrocyte media (P-value: 0.1086) ( ).\n\nApoE4 induces increased intraneuronal Aβ42 levels in cultured neurons\n\nTo study whether human ApoE alters Aβ levels in primary neurons, Aβ40 and Aβ42 levels were determined in media collected from primary ApoE KO brain cultures treated with ApoE3 or ApoE4-astrocyte-conditioned media for 24 h. To detect mouse Aβ in the media, the more sensitive technique of mesoscale analysis was used. Interestingly, treating neurons with astrocyte-conditioned media increased Aβ42 but not Aβ40 levels in neuron-conditioned media in an ApoE-independent manner ( ) and increased the Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio secreted by neurons ( ).\n\nEndogenous mouse Aβ42 was next investigated by immunofluorescence using Aβ42 antibody 12F4, as described previously (10), in primary brain cultures obtained from ApoE KO, ApoE3-KI, and ApoE4-KI mice ( ). Interestingly, ApoE4 neurons showed significantly higher intensity of Aβ42 labeling in neuronal cell bodies compared with ApoE KO neurons ( and ; 23.3% increase, P = 0.0174), although no statistical difference in Aβ42 signal was detected between the different ApoE isoforms in neurites ( and , P = 0.5960).\n\nTo further examine isoform-dependent effects on intraneuronal Aβ, we treated primary human ApoE KI mouse brain cultures that endogenously express human ApoE3 or ApoE4 in both neurons and astrocytes with synthetic human Aβ42 for 4 h ( ). Of note, the number of internalized human Aβ42 puncta, detected using the human-specific Aβ/APP antibody (6E10) were increased by 51.7% and 60.4% in ApoE4 compared with ApoE KO and ApoE3 primary brain cultures, respectively ( and ; ApoE KO versus ApoE4: P = 0.453, ApoE3 versus ApoE4; P = 0.474). No difference in the area of 6E10-positive Aβ42 puncta was detected ( , P = 0.5568). Strikingly, almost all the intraneuronal human Aβ puncta in both ApoE3 and ApoE4 neurons were also detected by the antibody OC against Aβ fibrils and oligomeric fibrils ( , lowest panel), supporting that the internalized human Aβ42 is aggregated (27).\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe prior literature suggests that ApoE4 plays a role in endosomal (dys)function (7, 12, 14, 16, 49). However, intracellular trafficking of ApoE in normal and AD conditions remain poorly studied. We now show that ApoE is present in the endosome–autophagy–lysosome system of N2a neuroblastoma cells and in primary neurons and astrocytes, albeit in somewhat different subcellular patterns, with neurons showing endosome–autophagosome labeling particularly of neurites and less in lysosomes. We demonstrate for the first time that astrocytic human ApoE is internalized and intersects with endogenous APP cleavage products Aβ/βCTF in primary neurons and N2a APPSwe cells. ApoE3 compared to ApoE4 was not seen to differentially alter endogenous APP in culture, although astrocyte media, even when devoid of ApoE, increased APP levels. However, ApoE4 increased endogenous intraneuronal mouse Aβ42 levels in primary neurons compared with the absence of ApoE. In addition, ApoE4 altered intraneuronal levels of internalized exogenously added Aβ42 in an ApoE isoform-dependent manner (ApoE4 > ApoE3). Our study highlights the importance of the endosome–autophagy system in ApoE biology and reveals an intersection between astrocyte-derived ApoE and APP processing products in neurites that we hypothesize to be of considerable importance in the pathogenesis of AD.\n\nBecause of the highly polarized shape of neurons, neuronal endolysosomal trafficking is quite distinct from other cell types, which might relate to our observation that ApoE clearly localized to lysosomes in N2a cells but not in neurons. In neurons, lysosomal maturation occurs during retrograde transport of endosomes–autophagosomes in neuronal processes towards the cell soma, with the most mature lysosomes being present in the soma itself (40, 41). The fact that we did not observe ApoE in lysosomes in the neuron cell soma, even after BafA1 treatment, suggests that ApoE is not trafficked to and degraded by lysosomes in neurons. Previous studies (12, 13, 50), including a study in primary neurons (12), demonstrated that ApoE is recycled, implicating endosomal recycling and re-secretion as pathways relevant to neuronal ApoE trafficking. Impaired recycling and re-secretion rather than lysosomal degradation were also shown to occur with internalized ApoE4 compared with ApoE3 in primary hepatocytes (13) and in a neuronal cell line (51).\n\nOur study demonstrates that astrocyte-derived human ApoE is present at APP-processing sites, with co-localization of ApoE and human Aβ/APP-βCTF in neurons and neuroblastoma cells. As antibody 82E1 directed against the free N-terminus of Aβ and APP-βCTF does not differentiate between these, we cannot draw conclusions on ApoE specifically intersecting with either Aβ or APP-βCTF. The Aβ domain, however, resides in both Aβ and APP-β-CTFs and both are viewed as participating in the pathogenesis of AD. In N2a cells, ApoE and Aβ/APP-βCTF were detected in LAMP1-positive vesicles, supporting that late endosomes, autophagosomes and/or lysosomes are the cellular sites where ApoE intersects with Aβ/APP-βCTF. In contrast, in neurons, ApoE localized to diverse endosomal–autophagic vesicles but not to lysosomes. However, the endosome–autophagy–lysosome system may differ in neurons in primary culture compared with the brain. On electron micrographs, lysosomes in brain are neither normally localized to axons nor to dendrites other than their most proximal parts (52). Because of the unique endosome–autophagy–lysosome biology of neurons (53), additional work is required to better define the subcellular site(s) and implications of the ApoE and Aβ/APP-βCTF intersection in neurons for AD.\n\nAlthough our work provides no evidence of direct interaction of ApoE and Aβ/APP-βCTF, it is known that ApoE and Aβ interact in human AD brains (27, 54, 55). Moreover, Kuszyczk et al (27) reported that inhibition of Aβ and ApoE binding reduces intraneuronal Aβ levels and protects against AD-like Aβ-induced synapse alterations. Thus, the intersection of Aβ/APP-βCTF and ApoE we observed in neuronal vesicles likely affects intraneuronal Aβ via direct interactions. Previous articles also reported that the presence of ApoE in general is linked to increased intraneuronal Aβ compared with when ApoE is KO (27, 56). Huang et al (57) reported that human ApoE produced in HEK293T cells influences APP and Aβ secretion in an ApoE isoform-dependent manner (ApoE4 > ApoE3 > ApoE2). Here, we showed that human ApoE derived from primary astrocytes did not induce ApoE-specific effects on the secretion of APP and Aβ nor on endogenous levels of APP in N2a cells or neurons. In fact, we observed that just adding astrocyte-conditioned media even devoid of ApoE to N2a cells increased APP. Our data are consistence with Huang et al, who showed that the ApoE isoform effect on Aβ production was abolished when glia were present in the culture (57). Together, these data support the conclusion that factors in glia media markedly affect APP and Aβ levels independent of ApoE. A recent study on human iPSC-derived neurons reported an isoform-dependent astrocytic ApoE4 media increase in APP levels (58); in contrast, in vivo studies indicate that ApoE genotype does not affect APP mRNA and protein levels in brains of humanized ApoE target replacement mice (26) and in transgenic PDAPP mice cross-bred with ApoE target replacement mice (59), arguing against an effect of human ApoE isoforms on APP metabolism. Wang et al (36) recently suggested that lipidated ApoE with cholesterol could change the localization of APP at the membrane in N2a cells towards GM1 lipid clusters, rather than changing its expression levels. As β-secretase is associated to lipid clusters, whereas α-secretase is linked to non-lipid-rich membrane regions, the ApoE-induced APP shift to lipid clusters in the membrane could favor Aβ production without affecting APP levels. It is also possible that the complex homeostatic control of Aβ levels might limit actual changes in levels that can be detected in cellular experiments (60).\n\nWe saw a trend but no statistical difference in ApoE3 versus ApoE4 on endogenous levels of Aβ42 although we did detect significantly more intraneuronal Aβ42 with ApoE4 than ApoE KO-conditioned media ( ). However, when adding elevated levels of Aβ42 to neurons, we then did reveal an ApoE isoform-specific effect on intraneuronal Aβ42, with ApoE4 inducing an increased number of intraneuronal Aβ42 puncta compared to ApoE3 ( ). This suggests that ApoE4 affects Aβ42 internalization, subsequent aggregation and/or degradation in neurons. A study in N2a cells further supports this by reporting enhanced Aβ internalization when co-cultured with ApoE4-expressing cells (61). Although the potential role of intraneuronal ApoE and its intersection with Aβ/APP-βCTF requires further study, that ApoE intersects with endogenous APP processing products and added Aβ, points to a role of the ApoE and Aβ intersection at different levels related to APP and Aβ biology.\n\nIn addition to the endosome–autophagosome pattern of ApoE labeling that we now describe in neurites, we previously described that added astrocyte-derived ApoE localized to synaptic terminals in primary neurons (48). Although the focus of the current article was on internalized ApoE in neurons, ApoE in the current study was also seen in a pattern of labeling around cell bodies and neurites consistent with the synaptic localization described in our previous article. Koffie et al (33) showed that ApoE co-localizes with Aβ oligomers at synapses in human brains, highlighting synaptic terminals as a potential site of ApoE and Aβ intersection. Endosomal trafficking is crucial for synaptic function (34, 62) and abnormal endosomal regulation, for example, by overexpressing Rab5, causes synaptic dysfunction (63, 64). We previously showed altered neuronal activity dependent on ApoE genotype (48), however, it remains unclear whether and how this might relate to altered endosome–autophagosome trafficking. Next to neurons, we detected ApoE internalization into primary astrocytes where it also appeared more prominent in their processes than cell soma ( ).\n\nIn conclusion, due to the complex endolysosomal biology of neurons, the endocytic trafficking of ApoE is different in neurons, as internalized ApoE does not end up in lysosomes of neuronal cell bodies as it does in N2a cells and primary astrocytes. In addition, ApoE and Aβ/APP-βCTF, all key players in AD, intersect subcellularly, with isoform-dependent ApoE effects. Our work further highlights the importance of the endocytic pathway in relation to the major AD players ApoE and Aβ/APP-βCTF (65, 66) in the early cellular phase of AD, and suggests that the endosome–autophagy–lysosome system is a potential site where ApoE and Aβ interact in AD.\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\nAnimals\n\nIn this study, the following mouse models were used: ApoE KO (B6.129P2-Apoe<tm1Unc>/J; Jackson Laboratory), humanized ApoE3-KI (B6.Cg-Apoeem2(APOE*)Adiuj/J; Jackson Laboratory), humanized ApoE4-KI (B6(SJL)-Apoetm1.1(APOE*4)Adiuj/J; Jackson Laboratory), and AD transgenic APP/PS1 B6.Cg-Tg mice (PSEN1dE9; APPswe) 85Dbo/Mmjax. All animal experiments described in this study were approved by the Ethical Committee for animal research at Lund University, Sweden (permit number: M5983-19).\n\nPrimary mouse mixed brain cultures\n\nPrimary mouse brain cultures were obtained from cortical and hippocampal brain tissues from ApoE KO, ApoE3-KI, ApoE4-KI, WT, and APP/PS1 embryos (E15–E17). Embryonic brain tissue was dissected and dissociated into single cells as previously described by Takahashi et al (67). In short, cortical and hippocampal embryonic brain tissues were manually dissociated using 0.25% trypsin (15090046; Thermo Fisher Scientific) and seeded onto poly-D-lysine–coated coverslips or plates. Directly after seeding, the cells were cultured in DMEM containing 10% FBS (10082147; Gibco) and 1% antibiotics penicillin/streptomycin (p/s) (SV30010; Thermo Fisher Scientific). After 3–5 h, the 10% FBS medium was replaced by complete Neurobasal medium containing B27 supplement (17504044; Gibco), 1% p/s, and 1.4 mM L-glutamine (25030081; Gibco) and cultured for 19 days in vitro (DIV) until further use. Both male and female embryos were used to generate primary brain cultures, although we did not specifically identify the sex of embryos; our blinding to gender also could reduce potential bias in subsequent analyses. Our experience indicates that the offspring of our crosses as expected generate about equal numbers of male and female offspring.\n\nPrimary mouse astrocytes\n\nPrimary mouse astrocyte cultures were obtained from ApoE KO, ApoE3-KI, and ApoE4-KI mouse pups (P1-P3) as previously described by Konings et al (48). In short, cortical and hippocampal brain tissues were obtained from mouse pup brains and manually dissociated after 0.25% trypsin incubation using plastic Pasteur pipets. After dissection and dissociation of the tissue, cells were seeded on T75 plates coated with poly-D-lysine. Primary astrocytes were cultured in AstroMACS medium (130-117-031; Miltenyi Biotec) with 0.5 mM L-glutamine and the medium was replaced every 2–3 d. Analogous to primary brain cultures, also for our generation of primary astrocytes we did not separate cells based on gender, but used all available pups which should lead to analogous number of male and female cells.\n\nCulturing neuroblastoma N2a cells\n\nMouse neuro-2a (N2a) cells (ATCC CCL-131) without transfection or N2a cells stably transfected with human APP carrying the Swedish mutation (N2a APPSwe) (68) were cultured in DMEM and Opti-MEM (31985062; Gibco) (ratio 1:1) containing 10% FBS and 1% p/s at 37°C and 5% CO2. N2a cells transfected with human APPSwe were selected using 50 mg/ml Geneticin (10131027; Gibco) in their media. N2a and N2a APPSwe cells were seeded on poly-D-lysine coated glass coverslips one day before recombinant or astrocytic ApoE treatment.\n\nRecombinant ApoE treatment\n\nRecombinant ApoE3 and ApoE4 proteins (SRP4696 and A3234; Sigma-Aldrich, respectively) were reconstituted in 0.1% BSA in milli-Q water to a stock concentration of 0.1 mg/ml. All experiments used a final ApoE concentration of 2.5 μg/ml.\n\nAntibodiesCompanyIdentifierDAPI (4′,6-diamidino-2phenylindole)Sigma-AldrichCat#D9542Mouse monoclonal anti-APP/Aβ (6E10)BioLegendCat#SIG-39320; RRID: AB_662798Mouse monoclonal anti-N-terminal Aβ (82e1)IBL internationalCat#10323; RRID: AB_10707424Mouse monoclonal anti-Aβ 1-42 (12F4)CovanceCat# SIG-39142Rabbit polyclonal anti-amyloid fibrils OCMilliporeCat#AB2286; RRID: AB_1977024Rabbit monoclonal anti-ApoE (16H22L18)Thermo Fisher ScientificCat#701241; RRID: AB_2532438Goat polyclonal anti-ApoEThermo Fisher ScientificCat#PA1-26902; RRID: AB_779281Mouse monoclonal anti-β-actinSigma-AldrichCat# A5316; RRID: AB_476743Rabbit polyclonal anti-early endosomal antigen 1 (EEA1)Sigma-AldrichCat# E4156; RRID: AB_609870Mouse monoclonal anti-GM130BD BiosciencesCat#610822; RRID: AB_398141F-Actin (Rhodamine phalloidin)Life TechnologiesCat#R415FilipinSigma-AldrichCat# SAE0088Mouse monoclonal anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)Sigma-AldrichCat# G3893; RRID: AB_477010Mouse monoclonal anti-Iba1MilliporeCat# MABN92; RRID: AB_10917271Rabbit polyclonal anti-LAMP1AbcamCat#ab24170; RRID: AB_775978Rat monoclonal anti-LAMP1AbcamCat# ab25245; RRID: AB_449893Rabbit polyclonal anti-LC3βCell signalingCat#2775; RRID: AB_915950Chicken polyclonal anti-MAP2AbcamCat# ab92434; RRID: AB_2138147Mouse monoclonal anti-neurofilament (SMI312)CovanceCat#SMI-312R; RRID: AB_2314906Rat monoclonal anti-CD140aBD BiosciencesCat#558774; RRID: AB_397117Mouse monoclonal anti-Rab7AbcamCat# ab50533; RRID: AB_882241Rabbit monoclonal anti-S100βAbcamCat#ab52642; RRID: AB_882426Mouse monoclonal anti-TGN38Santa Cruz BiotechnologyCat#Sc-166594; RRID: AB_2287347Polyclonal DyLight 405-AffiniPure Goat Anti-Chicken IgY (IgG)Jackson ImmunoResearchCat#103-475-155; RRID: AB_2337389Polyclonal Alexa Fluor 488-AffiniPure Goat Anti-Rabbit IgGJackson ImmunoResearchCat#111-545-144; RRID: AB_2338052Polyclonal Alexa Fluor 568 Conjugated Goat Anti-Mouse IgGMolecular ProbesCat#A-11004; RRID: AB_2534072Polyclonal Alexa Fluor 568 Conjugated Goat Anti-RatMolecular ProbesCat#A-11077; RRID: AB_141874Polyclonal Alexa Fluor 647-AffiniPure Donkey Anti-Chicken IgY (IgG)Jackson ImmunoResearchCat#703-605-155; RRID: AB_2340379Polyclonal Alexa Fluor 647-AffiniPure Goat Anti-Mouse IgGJackson ImmunoResearchCat#115-605-003; RRID: AB_2338902Polyclonal Alexa Fluor 647-AffiniPure Goat Anti-Rat IgGJackson ImmunoResearchCat#112-605-003; RRID: AB_2338393Polyclonal HRP-conjugated Goat Anti-Rabbit IgGR&D SystemsCat# HAF008; RRID: AB_357235Polyclonal HRP-conjugated Goat Anti-Mouse IgGR&D SystemsCat#HAF007; RRID: AB_357234\n\nAstrocyte-conditioned media treatment\n\nOnce primary astrocyte cultures reached 80% confluence, ApoE KO, ApoE3, and ApoE4 astrocyte conditioned media were collected. For the medium collection, astrocytes were first shortly washed with PBS and cultured in complete Neurobasal medium. After 48 h, astrocyte conditioned media were collected on ice, centrifuged at 9,279g (10,000 rpm) at 4°C for 10 min, and supernatant stored at −80°C in small aliquots to avoid freeze–thaw cycles.\n\nAstrocyte-conditioned media from ApoE KO, ApoE3, and ApoE4 astrocyte cultures were used to treat primary neuron cultures or mouse neuroblastoma neuro-2a (N2a) cells. Half of the original culture medium from primary neurons and N2a cells was replaced by an equal volume of conditioned astrocyte medium, resulting in half astrocyte-conditioned and half Neurobasal/N2a medium.\n\nLysosome inhibition experiments\n\nTo block lysosomal function in neurons, lysosomal acidification inhibitor bafilomycin A1 (Sigma-Aldrich) was used. Bafilomycin A1 was reconstituted in DMSO and further diluted to a final concentration of 10 nM (5 and 9 h) or 2 nM (25 h) to treat primary neurons. Primary neurons were treated 1 h before ApoE addition for a total duration of 5 h before fixation. For longer time points, ApoE KO primary neurons were treated with bafilomycin A1 1 h before 8 h or 24 h ApoE astrocyte-conditioned media co-treatment.\n\nSynthetic Aβ42 treatment\n\nSynthetic Aβ42 peptides (Cat#1428; Tocris) were prepared as previously described by Klementieva and colleagues (69). In short, synthetic Aβ1–42 was reconstituted in DMSO to a stock volume of 250 μM. The peptides were further prepared by sonicating for 10 min followed by centrifuging at 13,362g (12,000 rpm) for 15 min. A concentration of 0.5 μM Aβ42 was used to treat primary neurons.\n\nWestern blot\n\nWestern blot analysis was performed on astrocyte-conditioned media collected from ApoE KO, ApoE3-KI, and ApoE4-KI primary astrocytes to confirm the presence of human ApoE in ApoE3 and ApoE4 astrocyte-conditioned media. The medium was directly collected from astrocytes and centrifuged at 10,000g for 10 min at 4°C. The supernatant was collected and directly used or stored at −80°C. Media samples were prepared for loading by mixing with NuPage-reducing agent (NP004; Invitrogen) and Novex NuPage LDS sample buffer (NP007; Invitrogen). Subsequently, the samples were heated at 70°C for 10 min and centrifuged before loading in a NuPAGE 4–12% Bis-Tris gel (NP0321BOX; Invitrogen).\n\nWestern blot was also performed on N2a APPSwe cells treated with ApoE astrocyte-conditioned media to determine the APP and Aβ protein levels after human ApoE treatment. 4 h after astrocyte media treatment, media of N2a cells were first collected and N2a cells were washed in PBS, gently scraped, collected in a 1.5 ml tube, and centrifuged at 10,000g for 2 min. The supernatant was removed and the pellet was either snap frozen at −80°C in liquid nitrogen until further use or directly used for Western blot. To detect Aβ using Western blot, lysate samples were lysed in PBS containing 6% SDS and 1% β-mercapto-ethanol, followed by sonication, heating at 95°C for 6 min, and centrifugation at 13,362g (12,000 rpm) for 10 min. To detect Aβ, the N2a lysate samples were mixed with Novex Tricine SDS Sample Buffer (LC1676; Invitrogen), boiled at 95°C for 5 min, shortly centrifuged, and loaded onto a Novex 10–20% Tricine gel (EC6625BOX).\n\nAfter SDS–PAGE gel electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred to a PDVF membrane using iBlot 2. For APP and Aβ detection, the membranes were subsequently washed in PBS and cut into two (cut was made around 16 kD). The membrane part containing <16 kD proteins was boiled for 5 min in PBS to improve the detection of Aβ. The membrane part containing >16 kD proteins was stained for total proteins (AC2225; Azure) according to the manufacturer’s instructions and images were acquired using a Sapphire Biomolecular imager (Azure Biosystems). After total protein quantification, the top part of the membrane (>16 kD) was further cut just below 78 kD to obtain a total of three membrane parts ( ). All membranes were blocked in PBS-T containing 5% skim milk powder. The membranes were incubated overnight with primary antibodies at 4°C, followed by secondary HRP-conjugated antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. All washes were done in PBS-T. The membranes were developed using ECL Substrate and visualized using a Sapphire Biomolecular imager.\n\nQuantification of the bands was performed using Image Lab 6.1. All bands were normalized to total protein and β-actin. For protein quantification in media, the bands were corrected for both total proteins in media and β-actin and total protein from its corresponding lysate to correct for both protein concentrations in the medium and differences in cell number. All bands are presented normalized to the control, where the control condition is untreated N2A APPSwe cells that were used to establish a baseline for APP metabolism.\n\nMesoscale analysis\n\nSecreted Aβ40 and Aβ42 levels were measured using Meso Scale Discovery. Mouse primary brain cultures from WT or APP/PS1 incubated for 24 h with control (fresh neurobasal media), ApoE3 KI or ApoE4 KI astrocyte-conditioned media were collected. Aβ levels in media were assessed with the 4G8 kit (#K15199E) following the manufacturer's protocol. Plates were read using a QuickPlex Q120 reader (Meso Scale Diagnostics). Total protein in cell lysates was determined by BCA assay and used to normalize the Aβ levels to the concentration of total proteins.\n\nImmunofluorescence\n\nN2a cells and primary neurons (19 DIV) grown on glass coverslips were fixed in 4% PFA, 4% sucrose in PBS for 15 min at room temperature. The cells were incubated in PBS containing 1% BSA, 0.1% saponin (84510; Sigma-Aldrich), and 2% normal goat serum (005-000-121; Jackson ImmunoResearch) for 1 h at room temperature to permeabilize the cells and block unspecific signals. Afterwards, the coverslips containing N2a cells or primary neurons were incubated with primary antibodies, diluted in 2% normal goat serum in PBS, overnight at 4°C, followed by incubation with secondary fluorescently conjugated antibodies for 1 h at room temperature in the dark. The coverslips were mounted on glass slides with ProLong Diamond Antifade Mountant ({\"type\":\"entrez-protein\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"P36961\",\"term_id\":\"547831\",\"term_text\":\"P36961\"}}P36961; Invitrogen). All washes were performed in PBS.\n\nEpifluorescence microscopy\n\nMicroscopy was performed on coverslips containing fluorescently labeled N2a cells or primary neurons. In our experiments, two different epifluorescence microscopes were used: 1. Olympus IX70 microscope equipped with a 405, 488, 568, and 647 nm channel, X-Cite 120Q excitation light source (Excelitas Technologies), a {\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"C11440\",\"term_id\":\"1536511\"}}C11440 ORCA-Flash4-oIT digital camera, and 40x NA 1.3 and 60x NA 1.4 oil immersion objectives. An additional 1.5 magnification of the 60x objective was used when taking the images. 2. Nikon Eclipse 80i upright microscope (RRID:SCR_015572) equipped with a 10x (Nikon plan apo, NA 0.45), 20x (Nikon plan apo, NA 0.75), 40x (Nikon plan apo, NA 1.0, oil immersion), and 60x objectives (Nikon apo VC, NA 1.40, oil immersion). The Nikon microscope was connected to a computer containing Nikon Instruments Software-Elements Advance Research (NIS-Elements AR) version 3.2. The focus of the images was set based on the signal in the ApoE channel.\n\nConfocal microscopy\n\nTo obtain image stacks a laser scanning confocal microscope Leica TCS SP8 (RRID: SCR_018169; Leica Microsystems) in combination with Leica Application Suite X software version 3.4.7.23225 (RRID: SCR_013673; Leica Microsystems) was used. A Z-step size of 0.5 μm was used for imaging stacks. Orthogonal images were obtained by using Bitplane Imaris viewer version 9.5.1 (RRID: SCR_007370; Oxford Instruments).\n\nImage analysis and quantification\n\nTo analyze the added ApoE in N2a cells, the ApoE signal was normalized to control (vehicle control or ApoE KO-treated N2a cells). The percentage of N2a cells that take up ApoE was calculated by separating ApoE-positive (at least one ApoE puncta) from ApoE-negative cells (no ApoE puncta). Three criteria were set to determine which N2A cells in each image were analyzed. First, the cells should show ApoE uptake. Second, the cell outliner could be distinguished by the cellular marker phalloidin, and third, the whole cell body should be present in the image. All further analyses on added ApoE were performed on ApoE-positive cells. The number of ApoE puncta and the ApoE puncta area per N2a cell were analyzed using particle analyzer in Fiji ImageJ.\n\nThe co-localization of added recombinant ApoE3 and ApoE4 with sub-cellular markers Rab7, LAMP1, GM130, and TGN38 in N2a cells ( and ) was analyzed by determining the percentage of ApoE pixels that co-localized with each marker using Fiji ImageJ. The images were preprocessed using background subtraction and brightness processing to remove unspecific signals. For Rab7, which was detected as small puncta with high background in the cell, the images were also sharpened before background subtraction. Preprocessing settings of ApoE were set based on control-treated N2a cells to avoid endogenous mouse ApoE. After preprocessing of ApoE and the subcellular markers in the images, the images were thresholded and a selection was created for ApoE. Subsequently, the pixel co-localization was measured in Fiji ImageJ. N2a cells containing 5–20 ApoE puncta per cell were included in the pixel co-localization analyses.\n\nTo study whether ApoE in neurons is degraded by lysosomes, lysosomal activity was inhibited using Bafilomycin A1 ( ). Images taken from bafilomycin- and ApoE-treated neurons were analyzed using Fiji ImageJ. First, 10 different, nonoverlapping regions of interest were selected along MAP2-positive neurites for each analyzed neuron. The area of each individual region of interest was kept constant. Regions of interest of neurites were selected in such a way that all intracellular ApoE will be detected, meaning that synaptic ApoE puncta proximal to but not overlapping with MAP2 labeling was also included in the analysis. Within these regions of interest, the co-localization between ApoE and LAMP1 was analyzed in the same way as described for N2a cells (previous section). ApoE puncta size was analyzed using particle analyzer.\n\nThe number of MAP2-positive neurons and GFAP-positive astrocytes in our primary cultures ( ) was determined by manual counting using the Cell Counter plugin in ImageJ (https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/plugins/cell-counter.html). DAPI nuclei were used to determine the total number of cells in the culture.\n\nThe antibody 82e1 puncta number and size in APP/PS1 primary neurons were analyzed using particle analyzer in imageJ. Regions of interest of the same size were set for 10 neurites in each neuron (based on MAP2 labeling). Background subtraction and brightness adjustment were done for both the 82e1 and ApoE signals. The 82e1 signal was corrected for the signal in WT neurons, ApoE signal was corrected for the signal in ApoE KO treated neurons. 82e1 signal was thresholded and a selection was created. 82e1-ApoE co-localization was measured through pixel co-localization of the percentage of the 82e1 selection that contained ApoE-positive pixels.\n\nIntraneuronal Aβ42 levels ( ) were calculated based on the intensity of Aβ42-specific antibody 12F4 as previously described by Ubelman et al (10). Regions of interest were set for cell bodies and neurites based on MAP2 labeling using the polygon tool in ICY (https://icy.bioimageanalysis.org/). The mean intensity of 12F4 labeling was measured for the selected cell bodies and neurites and were corrected for the mean intensity of background signal. For one embryo, five independent neurons were analyzed. In each analyzed neuron, the three most prominent neurites were included in the analysis. All mean intensities measured in this study were normalized to the mean intensity measured in APP KO cell bodies and neurites.\n\nThe levels of internalized synthetic Aβ42 in primary neurons were analyzed based on 6E10 antibody labeling ( ). The 6E10 antibody is known to exclusively label human Aβ and not endogenous mouse Aβ. For quantification of the number of 6E10 puncta and the area of the 6E10 puncta, images obtained by epifluorescence microscopy were preprocessed and thresholded using Fiji ImageJ. 10 regions of interest of neurites per cell were selected using the polygon tool in ImageJ based on MAP2 labeling. Both number and size of the puncta were analyzed using particle analyzer. The puncta numbers were corrected for the total area analyzed to have all values corrected to a set area of 1,000 μm2.\n\nStatistical analyses\n\nAll statistical analyses were performed in Graphpad Prism 8.4.1. Before statistical testing, it was assessed whether the data were normally (Gaussian) distributed based on normality tests: Shapiro–Wilk tests and Kolmogorov–Smirnov tests, and QQ plots. In case of a normal distribution of the data, unpaired t test was performed to compare ApoE3 with ApoE4 ( , , and ) and one-way ANOVA to compare more than two groups ( , , and ). When the data were not normally distributed, nonparametric Mann–Whitney tests were performed to test statistical difference between ApoE3 and ApoE4 ( , , and ). When more than two groups were compared, Kruskal–Wallis tests were used to analyze non-normalized data ( , , , , and ). All data displayed in graphs were shown as mean ± SD. Big data points in graphs reflect the number of embryos (N), smaller data points reflect the single neurons/cells analyzed (n). In the case of neurites, 10 neurites per neuron were analyzed unless stated otherwise.\n\nSupplementary Material\n\nReviewer comments:\n\nClick here to view.(825K, pdf)\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nWe thank Bodil Israelsson, Lund University, for her support with the animal experiments and genotyping of mice.
