Hill,1 T. Housh, J. Keller,2 C. Smith, J. Anders,3 R. Schmidt, and G. Johnson4\n\n1University of Nebraska Lincoln; 2University of Nebraska-Lincoln; 3University of Nebraska-Lincoln; and 4University of Nebraska-Lincoln\n\nPurpose: Low-load blood flow restriction (BFR) training increases muscle strength and elicits muscle hypertrophy without the stress associated with high mechanical loads. The underlying mechanisms mediating muscle adaptation as a result of BFR training may be related to muscle swelling. To delineate the effects that muscle swelling may exhibit on muscle adaptation, the purpose of this investigation was to examine the effects of short-term resistance training with BFR (RT + BFR), resistance training without BFR (RT), and BFR without resistance training (BFR) on muscle strength, hypertrophy, and neuromuscular adaptions. Methods: Forty women (mean ± SD; 22 ± 3 years) volunteered to participate in this investigation and were randomly assigned to either the RT + BFR (n = 10), RT (n = 10), BFR (n = 10), or control (n = 10) group. Resistance training included 75 (1 × 30, 3 × 15) repetitions of reciprocal isokinetic forearm flexion-extension muscle actions performed at 30% of concentric peak torque relative to forearm flexion and forearm extension strength, respectively. Blood flow restriction was applied using a KAATSU training device and was applied at a pressure that corresponded to 40% of arterial occlusion. Training was performed 3 times per week for 4-weeks and all training and testing procedures were performed on a calibrated isokinetic dynamometer at a velocity of 120°·s−1. Isokinetic strength, surface electromyography (EMG) and mechanomyography (MMG), and muscle cross-sectional area via ultrasound were assessed after 2- and 4-weeks of training. Ultrasound-based assessments of muscle thickness, echo intensity, and muscle blood flow were used to quantify changes in muscle swelling and were measured immediately prior to, 0-, and 5-minutes after training during the 0-week, 2-weeks, and 4-weeks testing visits. Results: Muscle strength increased similarly for RT + BFR and RT after 2-weeks (13.1 and 13.4%, respectively) and 4-weeks (36.9 and 25.8%, respectively) that was associated with similar increases in muscle cross-sectional area after 2-weeks (11.3 and 12.4%, respectively) and 4-weeks (21.9 and 20.0%, respectively) of training. Although to a lesser magnitude than RT + BFR and RT, BFR alone increased muscle strength (8.6%), but did not elicit muscle hypertrophy. The changes in muscle strength for RT + BFR, RT, and BFR were associated with increases in MMG amplitude, MMG mean power frequency, and EMG mean power frequency, but no changes in EMG amplitude. The magnitude of muscle swelling was similar for RT + BFR and RT conditions at all time points, but increased to a lesser extent in BFR alone. There were no changes for the control group. Conclusion: These findings indicated that reciprocal forearm flexion-extension muscle actions elicited comparable increases in muscle strength and size with and without a BFR device. These similar adaptations as a result of RT + BFR and RT may be related to the magnitude of muscle swelling and/or motor unit firing rate (MMG mean power frequency). Interestingly, BFR alone elicited small, but significant increases in muscle strength. Practical Applications: These findings contribute to the growing body of evidence regarding the underlying mechanisms mediating muscle adaptation as a result of BFR and non-BFR training. In addition, coaches and practitioners can utilize low-load reciprocal resistance training to elicit positive adaptations to skeletal muscle. Future studies should examine BFR alone as a potential mechanism to augment muscle rehabilitation.\n\nThursday, July 11, 2019, 8:45 am–9:00 am\n\nConstructing and Implementing a Confirmatory Factor Model Using Skill and Strength for NFL Combine Measures\n\nK. Allen,1 C. Thomas, R. Herron,2 J. Cook, and G. Ryan3\n\n1The University of Southern Mississippi; 2United States Sports Academy; and 3Georgia Southern University\n\nThe National Football League (NFL) annually invites a select-group of potential players to perform in a scouting combine. A major component of the combine is a battery of anthropometric measurements and performance-based assessments that include a 40-yd dash, 20-yd shuttle, vertical jump, broad jump, 225 lb bench-press repetitions, and 3-cone drill. However, it is less understood how these assessments relate to when/if the athlete is drafted to a team. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to investigate how combine results can be factorially grouped to best predict draft pick order using NFL combine data from 2013 to 2017. Methods: To investigate the constructs and structure of the combine results, an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was conducted. This analysis used data from 2013 to 2015 with Quarterbacks and Kickers excluded. The EFA using a principal-axis factor extraction was conducted with the scree plot and Parallel analysis recommending a two-factor solution. For interpretation of the 2 factors, an oblique rotation was used, and the component loadings indicated 2 factors, Skill and Strength. A Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) was done using the data from 2016 to 2017. After the CFA, an ordinal regression was run using the factor scores for Skill and Strength, to predict which round the player would be drafted in. Results: The EFA using a principal-axis factor extraction recommended a two-factor solution for the data. The CFA yielded the same two-factor model which fit the data, χ2(df = 17) = 184.253, Comparative Fit Index (CFI) = 0.959. The two-factor model confirmed that Skill and Strength were latent variables that could be determined from combine measures (see Figure 1). An ordinal regression using the factors to predict which round a player would be drafted in had good fit with the deviance goodness-of-fit test, χ2(4,191) = 2,215.327, p = 1.00 and the final model over the intercept-only model was χ2(2) = 16.206, p < 0.001. Concluding that a decrease in Skill was associated with a decrease in the odds of being drafted in Round 1, with an odds ratio of 0.417 (95% CI [0.274, 0.635], Wald χ2(1) = 16.553, p < 0.001). A decrease in Strength was associated with a decrease in the odds of being drafted in Round 1, with an odds ratio of 0.458 (95% CI [0.304, 0.689], Wald χ2(1) = 16.553, p < 0.001). Conclusion: The CFA using Strength and Skill was a valid approach to determine performance in the NFL Combine over using only traditional measures. Using the factor scores may allow for a more accurate prediction of draft. When Strength and Skill measures decrease, the less likely the player is to be drafted in the initial rounds, when compared to being not-drafted. Practical Applications: If use of factor scores and traditional NFL Combine measures can yield a better prediction of players draft pick, this could be useful for further preparation, assessment, and scouting for players prior to the draft, which could provide great insight for coaches and personnel managers.\n\nThursday, July 11, 2019, 9:00 am–9:15 am\n\nThe Reliability of Pooled and Individualised Load-Velocity Profiles in the Power Clean and Back Squat\n\nS. Thompson,1 H. Banyard,2 A. Ruddock,1 D. Rogerson,1 and A. Barnes1\n\n1Sheffield Hallam University; and 2Swinburne University\n\nPurpose: To investigate the reliability of pooled and individualised load-velocity profiles (LVP) in competitive Olympic Weightlifters using the power clean and back squat exercises. Methods: Ten competitive weightlifters (mean ± SD; age: 25.0 ± 5.6 years; body mass: 73.6 ± 13.9 kg; stature: 169.6 ± 6.6 cm) completed baseline one repetition maximum assessments in the free-weight power clean (PC) and back squat (BS) (1RM: 103.0 ± 22.8 kg; 154.4 ± 33.8 kg, respectively). Three LVPs consisting of incremental protocols (PC: 40–100% 1RM; BS: 30–100% 1RM) with mean (MV) and peak (PV) velocity, measured via a linear-position transducer were completed; each separated by 48–96 hours. Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), coefficient of variation (CV), standard error of the estimate (SEE), linear regression (r), repeated measures one-way ANOVA (p < 0.05) and effect sizes (d) were used to assess the reliability of the load-velocity relationship for pooled and individualised data. High reliability was defined a priori as: ICC >0.7; CV < 10%; d < 0.2. Results: MV and PV were highly reliable in PC across all sessions (ICC = 0.97–0.98) and relative loads (ICC = > 0.7; CV = < 10%). Strong ICCs for pooled data (0.98–0.99) and relative loads (>0.7) were evident for BS, but with large between-participants variation (MV: 8.72–27.04%; PV: 9.93–30.71%) (Figure 1). Stronger relationships were found for load and MV (BS: r = 0.95; SEE = 0.09 m·s−1; PC: r = 0.87; SEE = 0.08 m·s−1) than PV (BS: r = 0.81; SEE = 0.22 m·s−1; PC: r = 0.81; SEE = 0.16 m·s−1) in the pooled data. Individualised LVPs were stronger in MV (BS: r = 0.98–1.00; SEE = 0.02–0.06 m·s−1; PC: r = 0.87–0.99; SEE = 0.02–0.06 m·s−1) and PV (BS: r = 0.96–1.00; SEE = 0.03–0.11 m·s−1; PC: r = 0.85–1.00; SEE = 0.02–0.10 m·s−1) than the pooled LVPs (Figure 1). Within-participant variation for 95–100% 1RM was >10% in BS MV. 1RM data was not statistically significantly different between sessions (p > 0.05, d = ≤ 0.08). Conclusion: Performing LVPs across a range of submaximal loads met our criteria for high reliability in the PC, but not the BS (CV > 10%). Nevertheless, the criteria were met when utilising individualised LVPs in BS and PC, suggesting that load-velocity characteristics and neuromuscular recruitment differ across individuals, despite sample homogeneity. MV was more reliable than PV in both lifts, signifying greater stability across concentric muscle actions. Large within-participant variation was found at 95–100% 1RM in BS MV, potentially due to greater reliance on the mechanical and elastic properties of muscle at heavier loads. Practical Applications: LVPs can be used for assessing load-velocity relationships and practitioners can be confident that changes in LVPs are unlikely to be due to test-retest error. Individualised LVPs using MV should be utilised for PC and BS. When profiling BS, submaximal loads of up to 90% are recommended to reduce variability in the data.\n\nThursday, July 11, 2019, 9:15 am–9:30 am\n\nComparison of Individual and Group-Based Load-Velocity Profiling as a Means to Dictate Training Load Over a Six-Week Strength and Power Intervention\n\nH. Dorrell, J. Moore, and T. Gee\n\nUniversity of Lincoln\n\nPurpose: To explore the effects of 2 velocity-based loading methods over a six-week strength and power intervention in resistance trained males. Methods: Nineteen resistance trained males (mean ± SD; age: 23.6 ± 3.7 years; stature: 182.7 ± 5.1 cm; body mass: 92.2 ± 8.7 kg) were recruited. Following familiarisation, participants completed 2 custom back squat one repetition maximum protocols (1-RM; 150.7 ± 23.7 kg), with mean concentric velocity (MCV) monitored enabling load-velocity profiles to be created. Additionally, participants completed countermovement, static squat, and standing broad jump protocols (CMJ, SSJ, and SBJ, respectively). Participants were randomly assigned to individual (ILVP; n = 9) or group-based load-velocity profiling (GLVP; n = 10) groups, both featuring 2 training sessions per week for 6 weeks. For the ILVP group, load and repetitions were dictated based on individual data collected during the initial load-velocity profiles. In comparison, for the GLVP intervention, load and repetitions were dictated using a generalised group-based load-velocity profile, consisting of all participant data. For both groups, relative training loads and number of sets and repetitions were equated. Following the intervention, participants retested all baseline variables. Independent sample t-tests were completed to examine the pre-training inter-group, and post-training intra-group differences. A two-way mixed ANOVA, using one inter-factor (ILVP vs. GLVP) and one intra-factor (pre- vs. post-training), was conducted to examine the pre to post between group differences. Cohen's d effect sizes (ES) were also calculated. Results: No significant differences were present between groups at baseline. Training resulted in significant increases in 1-RM back squat for both groups (ILVP: 9.7%; GLVP: 7.2%), with no group by time interaction (F(1,17) = 3.97 p = 0.06). Significant increases in CMJ, SSJ, and SBJ performance were recorded for the ILVP group (6.6, 4.6, and 6.7%, respectively), and CMJ and SSJ only for the GLVP group (both 4.3%). Small to moderate ES were noted for both interventions across all variables (ILVP vs. GLVP; back squat: 0.66 vs. 0.43; CMJ: 0.32 vs. 0.21; SSJ: 0.25 vs. 0.21; SBJ: 0.32 vs. 0.19). Conclusion: The data presented demonstrates the potential impact of utilising a velocity-based loading approach on measures of maximal strength and power. Specifically, the results suggest that use of individualised velocity-based loading may offer a greater magnitude of change for some athletes when compared to a group-based approach. Practical Applications: Sufficient evidence is provided supporting the use of velocity-based loading interventions within a resistance trained population. While no interaction was witnessed between groups for the back squat or jump assessments, the ILVP group did amass greater percentage increases and larger effect sizes suggesting that utilising individual differences may potentiate greater physical adaptations. Such methods appear to provide the strength and conditioning professional with greater control over prescribing load, limiting the chances of unnecessary fatigue, while providing measurable performance increases.\n\nThursday, July 11, 2019, 9:30 am–9:45 am\n\nEfficacy of an Acute Heavy Resistance Exercise Protocol to Study the Recovery Paradigm in Resistance Trained Males\n\nL. Caldwell,1 E. Post,2 M. Beeler,2 J. Volek,2 C. Maresh,2 and W. Kraemer2\n\n1The Ohio State University; and 2The Ohio State University\n\nAdequate recovery from exercise stress is paramount for enhancing performance readiness and mitigating overtraining. Research investigating the effectiveness of new recovery modalities requires an exercise stress model of sufficient stimulus—providing a context in which to study the recovery paradigm. Identifying a reliable stress model is the first step in conducting recovery research. Purpose: To characterize the effects of an acute heavy resistance exercise protocol on biomarkers of physical and psychological stress occurring over a 48-hour recovery period. Methods: Eight resistance trained males (age: 23.3 ± 3.0 years; height: 176.8 ± 7.1 cm; weight: 87.6 ± 6.2 kg; strength to weight ratio: 1.8 ± 0.2) participated in this investigation. A baseline visit was utilized to determine 1-repetition maximum (1RM) and familiarize participants to the testing procedures. At least one week after the baseline visit, participants returned to the laboratory to complete a 6 × 10 back squat protocol at 80% 1 RM with 2-minute rest periods. Pain, soreness, mood state, energy, lower body power and circulating stress hormones were evaluated at 5 timepoints: before exercise (PRE), immediately post exercise (IP), 1-hour after exercise (+1HR), 24 hours after exercise (+24HR) and 48 hours after exercise (+48HR). Lower body power and jump height were measured during countermovement jumps on a force plate. Epinephrine (EPI) and norepinephrine (NE) were measured via plasma blood draw to evaluate stress signaling. The McGill Pain Questionnaire was used to evaluate intensity and quality of pain. A 100 mm visual analog scale (VAS) was used to assess overall and area specific soreness. The Profile of Mood States Questionnaire was used to assess frame of mind and VAS scale was used to evaluate energy and fatigue. Mean differences were assessed using a single factor repeated measures ANOVA with Bonferroni correction. Significant F tests were further investigated using pairwise post-hoc comparisons (p ≤ 0.05). Cohen's d was calculated to evaluate magnitude of change from baseline values. Results: The intense exercise stress resulted in increased fatigue (d; IP = 1.2, +1HR = 1.3) reduced jump height (d; IP = 1.3, +1HR = 1.15) compromised power (d; IP = 1.2, +1HR = 1.4) and increased circulating NE (d; IP = 4.6, +1HR = 1.1) at both IP and +1HR measurements. Mood was significantly reduced at all post exercise timepoints. Pain intensity and sensory characteristics were significantly elevated at all post exercise timepoints (d = 1.0–1.8), with IP significantly higher than +1HR, but not significantly different from +24 HR to +48 HR. Overall soreness was significantly elevated at all post exercise timepoints (d = 2.0–2.4). Quadriceps and hamstring soreness were elevated IP (d = 2.4) and +1HR (d = 2.0), while total number of soreness areas increased at +24 HR (d = 1.7) and +48 HR (d = 2.8). Conclusion: The large effect sizes demonstrated in this study highlight the intense stress placed on the body following a 6 × 10 back squat protocol at 80% 1 RM. Mood, pain, soreness, energy, jump height and power were negatively impacted at IP and +1HR, with mood disturbances and increased pain and soreness presenting through the +48 HR assessment. Practical Applications: The 6 × 10 back squat at 80% 1 RM provides a significant exercise stimulus, with homeostatic perturbations evident 48 hours after exercise. This protocol provides a valuable stress model that may be used in research investigations of the recovery paradigm.\n\nThursday, July 11, 2019, 9:45 am–10:00 am\n\nHigh and Moderate Resistance Training Volumes Facilitate Similar Increases in Strength and Hypertrophy in Trained Women\n\nL. Colenso-Semple,1 S. Bucker,2 B. Mueller,2 J. Longstrom,2 G. Rogers,2 E. Trexler,2 and B. Campbell2\n\n1McMaster University; and 2University of South Florida\n\nPurpose: To compare changes in lower-body muscular strength and hypertrophy in young women after 8 weeks of high or moderate volume resistance training. Methods: Thirty-seven resistance-trained women (mean ± SD: Age: 23 ± 4 years; Height: 63.7 ± 2.5 in; Weight: 134 ± 20 lbs) were assigned to a high-volume (HV) or moderate-volume (MV) experimental group. All participants trained on 3 non-consecutive days per week for 8 weeks with a total of 81 weekly sets (HV) or 36 weekly sets (MV) of lower-body exercises. Each session consisted of barbell squats (HV: 5 sets, MV: 2 sets), stiff-leg deadlifts (HV: 5 sets, MV: 2 sets), barbell hip thrusts (HV: 5 sets, MV: 2 sets), knee extension (HV: 4 sets, MV: 2 sets), lying leg curl (HV: 4 sets, MV: 2 sets), cable abduction (HV: 4 sets, MV: 2 sets), bench press or overhead press (HV: 2 sets, MV: 2 sets), and pulldown or cable row (HV: 2 sets, MV: 2 sets). Repetition range was specified as 6–8 (Day 1), 8–10 (Day 2), and 12–15 (Day 3). Loads were adjusted to ensure each set was terminated 2 repetitions from failure in the target range. All sessions were supervised by certified personal trainers. Assessments were conducted at baseline and 48–72 hours following the final training session. Muscle thickness of the anterior thigh, lateral thigh, posterior thigh, and gluteus maximus was measured with B-mode ultrasound. Strength was evaluated with a 6-repetition maximum (6RM) barbell back squat. Results: Strength and muscle size increased in both groups from pre-to-post intervention. A significant increase favoring the higher volume condition was observed for lateral thigh growth (+1.2 mm (MV) vs. +2.8 mm (HV), p = 0.046). There were no statistically significant differences between HV or MV in squat strength or hypertrophy of the anterior thigh, posterior thigh, or gluteus maximus. Overall, 6RM squat increased by ∼24% (32 lbs), muscle thickness increased ∼4% (2 mm) in the anterior thigh, ∼5% (2 mm) in the lateral thigh, ∼3% (1.9 mm) in the posterior thigh, and ∼1% (.8 mm) in the gluteus maximus. Conclusion: Lower body strength and muscle size increased similarly with 8 weeks of moderate- or high-volume training with all sets terminated 2 repetitions from failure. The higher volume protocol appeared slightly superior for hypertrophic adaptations of the lateral thigh. Practical Applications: A moderate-volume program of 12 sets performed 3 times per week provides a sufficient stimulus to increase squat strength and lower body muscle size. Training to failure is not required to facilitate strength or hypertrophic adaptations in resistance-trained women.\n\nThursday, July 11, 2019, 10:00 am–10:15 am\n\nMonitoring of Body Composition and Physical Performance in a Division II Football Team Throughout a Competitive Season\n\nM. Norford,1 M. Magee,2 J. Fox, S. Williams, J. Kollars,3 A. McCracken,2 B. Comstock, J. Andreacci, and K. Beyer2\n\n1Applied Body Science; 2Bloomsburg University; and 3Bloomsburg University of Pennsylvania\n\nAmerican football is a sport requiring repeated high-intensity efforts that result in on-field collisions. These on-field demands are met by each position with training to achieve a specific physical skill set and body composition. However, in-season competitions may affect physical performance and body composition, specifically in programs with limited resources. Purpose: To assess changes in body composition and physical performance variables in a Division II football team during a competitive season. Methods: Sixty-five football players were recruited for this project. Subjects reported for 2 separate visits, the day before training camp (PRE) and the week after the last game (POST). During these visits, subjects were assessed for body mass via digital scale and percent body fat (%BF) via a 3-site skinfold. After, subjects were required to perform a vertical jump test via a vertec to assess jump height. Vertical jump height was then used to calculate vertical jump velocity. Vertical jump momentum was calculated as the product of body mass and vertical jump velocity. All players were categorized according to playing position into Perimeter Skill (defensive back, wide receiver), Interior Skill (linebacker, running back, fullback, tight end) and Line (defensive line, offensive line); all other positions were excluded due to insufficient sample. Results: Body mass had no time×position interaction (p = 0.281) or main effect of time (p = 0.726). Similarly, %BF had no time × position interaction (p = 0.117), but there was a significant main effect of time (p = 0.033). There was a significant decrease in %BF from PRE (17.4 ± 7.6%) to POST (16.4 ± 8.4%). Furthermore, no time × position interactions were noted for vertical jump height (p = 0.232) or momentum (p = 0.232), but there was a main effect of time for both (p < 0.001). Vertical jump height and momentum decreased from PRE (72.5 ± 12.0 cm and 380.3 ± 61.3 kg·m/s) to POST (66.5 ± 9.4 cm and 363.7 ± 60.8 kg·m/s). Conclusion: The findings of the study revealed that body mass was maintained throughout the season, with a concurrent decrease in %BF. In terms of performance, both vertical jump height and momentum decreased during the season. However, no positional differences were observed in the changes during the season for any variables. Practical Applications: This study's findings could be useful for coaches at Division II schools whose teams may experience similar in-season changes, possibly due to limited resources. Linear momentum may be a useful metric for American football because it is affected by the changes in both mass and velocity.\n\nThursday, July 11, 2019, 10:15 am–10:30 am\n\nThe Effects of a Multi-ingredient Pre-workout Supplement on Repeated Sprint Ability and Perceived Exertion\n\nM. Magee,1 M. Norford,2 S. Williams, J. Fox, R. Inaba,3 J. Andreacci, B. Comstock, and K. Beyer1\n\n1Bloomsburg University; 2Applied Body Science; and 3Cenegenics\n\nPurpose: To assess the ability of a single dose of a multi-ingredient pre-workout supplement (MIPS) to elicit desirable responses on repeated sprint ability and rating of perceived exertion (RPE). Methods: Twenty women and 18 men were recruited to participate in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study. All participants were tested within the same week separated by 48 hours and were provided either the placebo (PLA) or the MIPS on each day. As per the manufacturer's instructions, the participants waited 25 minutes to begin the tests, following consumption of the drink. Participants completed a short warm-up which consisted of 2 minutes of cycling at 50 RPMs against a light resistance, followed by 3, 10-second sprints, to determine the max RPMs. After the warm-up, participants completed the repeated sprint test, which consisted of 10, 6-second sprints, with 45 seconds of active rest in between each sprint. For each sprint, a resistance of 7.5% of the participant's body mass was applied at 90% of their max RPM. Immediately after each sprint, differentiated peripheral RPE for the legs was recorded, as well as peak heart rate. Peak power and work were measured using the Monark Anaerobic Test Software. Peak power, work, heart rate and RPE were analyzed using a 2 × 10 (trial'sprint) repeated measures ANOVA, with post hoc paired t-tests comparing trials at each sprint. Level of significance was set a priori to p£0.05. Results: A trend in trial×sprint interaction (p = 0.068) was observed for peak power. There was significantly lower peak power during PLA when compared to MIPS at sprints 4 (p = 0.013, 651.2 ± 162.1 W vs 675.9 ± 169.0 W), 5 (p = 0.001, 615.2 ± 163.0 W vs 655.1 ± 176.9 W), 6 (p = 0.010, 598.5 ± 159.6 W vs 635.3 ± 166.3 W), and 8 (p = 0.011, 574.3 ± 155.8 W vs 613.7 ± 156.7 W), while there was a trend at sprints 7 (p = 0.065, 576.8 ± 159.5 W vs 614.3 ± 168.5 W) and 9 (p = 0.068, 575.4 ± 150.5 W vs 603.3 ± 156.1 W). A trend in trial × sprint interaction (p = 0.092) was observed for leg RPE. PLA had significantly greater leg RPE than MIPS at sprints 1 (p = 0.005, 3.4 ± 1.9 vs 2.8 ± 1.9), 2 (p < 0.001, 4.5 ± 2 vs 3.7 ± 1.9), 3 (p < 0.001, 5.5 ± 1.9 vs 4.7 ± 2), 4 (p = 0.010, 6.3 ± 1.9 vs 5.6 ± 2), 5 (p = 0.038, 6.8 ± 1.8 vs 6.4 ± 2), 6 (p = 0.033, 7.5 ± 1.6 vs 7 ± 1.8), and 8 (p = 0.049, 8.4 ± 1.4 vs 8.1 ± 1.5), with a trend noted at sprint 7 (p = 0.068, 7.8 ± 1.6 vs 7.5 ± 1.6). There was no significant trial×sprint interactions in work (p = 0.591), or heart rate (p = 0.607). Conclusion: This MIPS elicited favorable trends in power and RPE, despite no changes in work or heart rate. This MIPS may be able to increase peak power and reduced RPE during repeated sprints. These findings may be due to the caffeine within the MIPS, but future research should investigate further. Practical Applications: This MIPS may be an option for individuals looking to improve repeated sprint ability in a single dose. These acute benefits may ultimately result in greater adaptations to sprint interval training.\n\nThursday, July 11, 2019, 12:00 pm–1:30 pm\n\nPredicting Ball Exit Velocity With an Inertial Measurement Unit in Collegiate Baseball Players\n\nR. Eusufzai and C. Bailey\n\nUniversity of North Texas\n\nInertial measurement units (IMU) are increasing in popularity in research and in practice as a method of acquiring kinematic data, likely due to their minimal spatial constraints. This technology has been applied to several sports, including baseball, but their utility for performance monitoring and identification of key performance indicators (KPI) needs to be evaluated. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the association between batted ball exit velocity (BEV) and kinematic performance variables assessed with an IMU. Methods: 13 collegiate baseball players (NCAA DIII) volunteered for this study (82.2 ± 10.9 kg, 178.3 ± 5.5 cm, 19.9 ± 1.3 years). After a total body dynamic warm-up and 10 practice swings (5 dry swings, 5 hitting off of a batting tee), 3 maximal effort swings were completed. During each maximal effort trials, athletes used a standardized bat to hit a ball off of a batting tee at a self-selected height. Kinematic swing performance data were collected via an IMU collecting data at 1,000 Hz. Variables included bat speed at impact (BSI), hand speed max (HSM), time to impact (TTI), bat vertical angle (BVA), and attack angle (AA). BEV was simultaneously collected a with radar gun positioned directly behind the batter. Association between IMU derived variables and BEV were evaluated via bivariate Pearson's product moment correlations. Results: BSI was the only variable shown to produce a practically significant relationship with BEV (r = 0.53, p = 0.06) but statistical significance was not achieved at the p ≤ 0.05 level. All results can be seen in Figure 1. Conclusion: While, the small sample size associated with this study likely decreased the chances of achieving statistical significance for many of the variables, only BSI was predictive of BEV from a practical standpoint. BEV and all the IMU variables are likely still important and should continue to be monitored, but further research is necessary to evaluate their importance to performance. Practical Applications: Based on the findings of this study, BSI may be moderately predictive of BEV. It is important to note that the current investigation only looked at BEV as a performance measure and there are many other KPIs associated with hitting that should be evaluated in the future. Furthermore, changes in IMU variables in response to different training volumes and associate fatigue may be of value.\n\nThursday, July 11, 2019, 12:00 pm–1:30 pm\n\nVarying Shoulder Angle Increases Muscle Activation of the Biceps Brachii Without Impacting Volume Load Within a Training Session\n\nJ. Pearson,1 C. Barakat,2 E. De Souza, J. O'Sullivan, M. Alvarez,2 J. Rauch, D. Aube,2 and R. Barroso3\n\n1The University of Tampa; 2University of Tampa; and 3University of Campinas\n\nIntroduction: Manipulating resistance training (RT) variables has been suggested as a means to optimize muscular adaptations. For instance, training volume and muscle activation are 2 variables that quantify the demands placed on the muscle within a session. However, there is a paucity of data on how these elements are influenced by varying joint angles within a training session. Purpose: Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine how altering the shoulder angle (glenohumeral joint [GH]) affects volume load and muscle activation of the biceps brachii within a training session. Methods: Eleven resistance trained individuals (5 males, 6 females, age: 21 years ± 1.47, height: 166.8 cm ± 7.1, body mass: 66.6 kg ± 10.4, RT experience: 4.7 years ± 1.91) volunteered for this study. Subjects performed 3 familiarization sessions prior to the experimental sessions. Baseline 10 repetition-maximum (RM) elbow flexion values were recorded during the familiarization sessions in 3 different GH joint angles (−30°, 0°, 90°). This 10RM load was used for the first working set of each experimental session and the load was adjusted during subsequent sets. Forty-eight hours after the familiarization sessions, subjects underwent 2 experimental conditions with a one-week washout period between conditions, control (CON) and varying GH joint angle (VAR), in a randomized, cross-over design. Before any experimental session, surface electromyography (EMG) was applied to the mid-belly of the biceps brachii. In order to normalize the EMG data, a maximum voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) was performed at each shoulder position before starting the experimental conditions working sets. During the MVIC, the root mean square (RMS) of the EMG signal was calculated in 500ms windows, and the highest value was used for normalization of the dynamic contractions. During the working sets, repetitions of each set were divided into quartiles and raw EMG signal was converted into RMS values for each quartile. The CON condition performed all 9 sets of elbow flexion with their GH joint at 0° (i.e., neutral position). The VAR condition performed 3 sets of elbow flexion in each position (−30°, 0°, 90°), in a randomized fashion. A paired t-test was used to compare volume load and muscle activation between conditions. The significance level was set at p < 0.05. Results: For muscle activation, the overall session EMG amplitude was significantly higher (p = 0.0001) in the VAR condition compared to CON (CI: 8.4–23.3%). Interestingly, regarding volume load, there were no differences between conditions (VAR 596 kg ± 170, CON 606 kg ± 175). Conclusion: Our results suggest that despite similar volume load between conditions, varying joint angles increases muscle activation within a training session. Practical Applications: Our data suggest that altering joint angles during exercise increases muscle activation in an acute fashion. However, these findings should be examined with caution since these acute responses may not be associated with long term adaptations. Therefore, future investigations are warranted to determine any chronic effects.\n\nThursday, July 11, 2019, 12:00 pm–1:30 pm\n\nEstablishing Effectiveness of Muscle Recruitment in a Medicine Ball Versus a Ballistic Ball During Upper Extremity Exercise\n\nH. Milton,1 A. Davis,2 and J. Fernandes2\n\n1NYU Langone Sports Performance Center; and 2NYU Langone Health\n\nBackground: Various exercise tools are used in abundance during training and rehabilitation of athletes susceptible to shoulder injury as a means to strengthen stabilizing muscles of the shoulder, and trunk. In contrast to the vast amount of literature evaluating muscular activity during traditional medicine balls and Bodyblade tools, there is no peer reviewed literature evaluating muscular activity during exercise using new varieties of medicine balls that are currently being sold to rehabilitation and exercise professionals. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to compare the electromyogram (EMG) activity of shoulder and trunk stabilizing muscles during 3 commonly performed medicine ball exercises using both a standard medicine ball and a ballistic medicine ball (SB). Methods: Twenty-four healthy volunteers (17 female and 7 male) with a mean (±standard deviation) age of 35.5 ± 9.2 years and a body mass index (BMI) of 22.7 ± 2.8 were enrolled. Following a familiarization session, wireless surface EMG probes were placed on subject's infraspinatus (IS), latissimus dorsi (LD), anterior deltoid (AD) and external obliquus (EO). The order of exercises and ball selection were randomly drawn. Each subject performed 3 exercises using MB and SB. Results: There were no significant (p > 0.05) differences in maximal and mean muscle activity in any muscle group between exercises with the MB and SB. Two-way analyses of variance showed no significant (p < 0.05) differences in muscle activity between the 2 ball types for all muscle groups. Conclusion: This study suggests that the new SB exercise tool may be a useful tool for rehabilitation of athletes in need of tools to aid in shoulder and trunk stabilization. The lack of statistical significance between ball types suggests there is no added benefit to use the SB over traditional MB. Future study is recommended using a variety of SB and MB weights and sizes to further evaluate muscle recruitment during common exercises using these tools. Practical Applications: Rehabilitation therapists and exercise professionals alike may further consider utilizing newly marketed exercise tools not as a replacement of traditional tools, but rather as a compliment for training variety in athletes.\n\nThursday, July 11, 2019, 12:00 pm–1:30 pm\n\nComparison of Stride Length and Stride Frequency Patterns of Sprint Performance in Overground vs Motorized Treadmill Sprinting\n\nL. Gruber, S. Montalvo, and S. Dorgo\n\nUniversity of Texas at El Paso\n\nSprint Performance (SP) and the ability to attain maximal sprinting velocity is a major factor in many athletic events. Stride length (SL) and stride frequency (SF) are critical variables when looking at SP. SP can be improved by training overground (on track) (OG), as well as on motorized high-speed treadmills (TM). However, our current understanding is lacking regarding kinematic differences, specifically SL and SF patterns, between motorized treadmill and overground sprinting conditions. Purpose: (a) To examine the relationship between SL and SF between OG and TM sprinting; and (b) examine if SL and SF are predictors of OG and TM maximal sprint speeds. Methods: Forty subjects, 20 NCAA sprint athletes and 20 recreationally trained college-aged athletes took part in a single-day testing session. Testing consisted of two 60 m OG sprints and 2 maximal sprints on a highspeed motorized treadmill. In addition to SL and SF, contact time (CT), and flight time (FT) were recorded using a photoelectric cells device. For the OG testing, 2 timing gates were also used to record maximal sprint speed over the final 10 m of each 60 m sprint. Subjects were instructed to use the 50-m prior to the testing zone for acceleration in order to achieve maximal speed. For the TM sprinting testing, a motorized treadmill with a max speed of 13.5 m/s was used. Subjects wore a safety harness connected to a steel frame to prevent being ejected from the treadmill. In the testing run, subjects were instructed to gradually transfer their weight on to the moving belt while holding onto the handrails. Subjects were asked to keep up with the belt speed for 3–4 seconds. If successful, belt speed was increased for the subsequent trials until the subjects' failure to keep up. Results: Among the 40 subjects, there was a strong positive correlation for speed, CT, and SF performed in OG modality. A correlation was also found between speed, CT and SF performed in the TM condition (Pearson R = 0.94; R = 0.68; and R = 0.65, respectively). In addition, we observed a significant difference (p = 0.00) between OG-speed & TM speed (mean and SD diff = −0.214 ± 0.384), OG-CT & TM-CT (mean and SD diff = −0.010 ± 0.020), and OG-SF & TM-SF (mean and SD diff = −0.471 ± 0.311). No significance difference was observed between OG-FT & TM-FT (mean and SD diff = −0.101 ± 0.248) and OG-SL & TM-SL (mean and SD diff = −65.325 ± 95.750). Among 40 subjects, CT, FT, and SF were found to be predictors of sprint speed in the overground modality (p = 0.000) while SL was not a predictor of sprint speed in this modality. Linear regression for motorized treadmill conditions in 40 subjects showed that CT, FT, SL and SF are all predictors of sprint speed (p < 0.05). Conclusion: Results show that motorized treadmill increases stride frequency dramatically when compared to overground, which could result in the motorized treadmill being used as a training tool to enhance stride frequency. However, the optimal ratio used to achieve sprint speed was altered on the motorized treadmill when compared to overground running. Therefore, while there may benefits to using such an instrument to enhance speed, it is unclear how much improvement is transferred to overground condition. Practical Applications: A High-speed motorized treadmill can be used as a supplemental training tool to induce supramaximal sprint running, in aid of acquiring neural muscular adaptations and improvement of stride frequency and ground contact time.\n\nThursday, July 11, 2019, 12:00 pm–1:30 pm\n\nEffects of Instability Devices on Muscular Activation During Performance of a Glute Bridge Exercise\n\nT. Huckaby, B. Hirt, S. Moreno, and L. Atkins\n\nAngelo State University\n\nPurpose: Exercises performed on an unstable surface have been associated with increased upper and lower extremity muscle activation compared to exercises performed on stable surfaces. Additionally, altered trunk and lower limb muscle activation has been associated with various pathological conditions. Subsequently clients are commonly prescribed a variant of the glute bridge exercise in an effort to optimize trunk and lower limb muscle function; however, currently little is known about the influence of varying levels of surface stability on muscle activation when performing the glute bridge exercise. Thus, the purpose of this study was to examine the effects of varying surface stability during the glute bridge exercise on trunk and lower limb muscle activation. Methods: Twenty-two asymptomatic, physically active subjects (10 female) participated in this study (age: 24.2 (1.6) yr, body mass index: 24.4 (3.0) kg/m2). To be included, subjects were required to correctly perform 5 repetitions of the glute bridge exercise on a stable surface. Subjects were excluded if they: (a) had a BMI greater than 30 kg/m2, (b) had surgery within year prior to testing, (c) were injured within 6 months prior to testing, or (d) were pregnant. Surface electromyography was used to record (1,000 Hz) activation of the rectus abdominis (RA), external oblique (EO), gluteus maximus (GM) and biceps femoris (BF) for one second during a static glute bridge exercise performed during 3 conditions that varied according to surface stability. These conditions included a stable box (CTRL), swiss ball (SB), and suspension straps (SS). The dependent variables included the 5-trial averages of mean muscle activation during each condition. One-way repeated ANOVAs and Tukey LSD post hoc tests (for significant ANOVAs) were calculated (α = 0.05) to determine the effect of surface stability on muscle activation. Results: Mean activation of the BF was similar across all conditions (p > 0.05). Compared to the CTRL condition, RA and EO activation increased during the SB (p < 0.01) and SS conditions (p < 0.01). Compared to SS condition, GM activation decreased during the SB (p < 0.01) and CTRL (p < 0.01) conditions. Conclusion: Findings from the current study indicate that a glute bridge exercise performed on an unstable (vs stable) surface elicits increased trunk and lower limb muscle activation. Furthermore, the SS condition resulted in greater GM activation than the CTRL and SB conditions. Practical Applications: Use of instability devices should be considered when prescribing the glute bridge exercise to increase trunk and lower limb muscle activation in clinical settings. Clients with low back pain, osteoarthritis, knee pain, and gait abnormalities associated with reduced GM activation may benefit from progression to the SS variation of the glute bridge.\n\nThursday, July 11, 2019, 12:00 pm–1:30 pm\n\nPrediction of Bat Swing Velocity From Sprint Speeds and Discrete Variables of the Countermovement Jump in NCAA Division 1 Softball\n\nB. Mann, J. Mayhew1, B. Ruhanen2, and J. Dawes\n\n1Truman State University; and 2University of Missouri\n\nA primary requirement for scoring runs in softball is being able to hit the ball. Given the speed of most pitches, the ability to generate speed in the bat swing would appear to be one of the major components of hitting the ball. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to determine the ability to predict bat velocity from commonly utilized discrete variables of the countermovement jump. Methods: Members of an NCAA Division 1 softball team (n = 22, age = 19.05 ± 1.16 years, height = 170.2 ± 6.3 cm, body mass = 66.86 ± 9.91 kg) were measured for countermovement jump (CMVJ) on a single-axis dual-force platform system sampling at 1,000 Hz. Players stood motionless with hands on hips for 3 seconds to determine body mass. Upon command, players jumped as high as possible with hands remaining on hips. Subjects stood still for quiet standing to record mass and have a reference point for the jump. Upon landing, the player re-centered her feet on each platform and achieved quiet standing for 1 full second before repeating the CMVJ. Peak vertical velocity (PVV), force at peak power (FPP), peak power (PP), and time to peak power (TPP) were processed with commercially available software. The better repetition was selected for analysis. Two 20-yd sprint trials were performed from a standing start with 10-yd split time taken using an infrared timing system; the better trial was selected for analysis. Bat velocity (BV) was recorded utilizing a previously validated commercially available accelerometer that attached to the proximal end of the bat. The average of 8 repetitions was used to represent BV. Results: Backwards elimination regression using CMVJ variables and sprint times were used to estimate BV. FPP was the only variable selected to predict BV (R = 0.79, SEE = 3.77, BV (m/s) = 121.625 – FPP (N) × 0.039). Conclusion: These results suggest that a softball player's BV is predominantly dependent on her ability to generate force quickly. Practical Applications: The findings in this study suggest the potential of increasing BV by increasing leg strength and/or leg power in softball players. A longitudinal study is necessary to validate this supposition.\n\nThursday, July 11, 2019, 12:00 pm–1:30 pm\n\nReliability and Precision of Frontal-Plane Knee Angulation Measures During Vertical Jumping\n\nL. Weiss, H. Daugherty, D. Powell, M. Paquette, and L. Allison\n\nThe University of Memphis\n\nKnee actions primarily occur through sagittal (flexion and extension), and to a lesser extent, transverse (internal and external rotation) planes. However, slight frontal-plane movements are also possible ranging from varus (bowed knees) to valgus (knock knees) positions. When frontal-plane malalignment is substantial and superimposed on sagittal- and/or transverse-plane movements, knee structures may be exposed to unusual stresses and performance might be affected. To address these scenarios during exercise, objective measures of frontal-plane knee positions are needed. Purpose: To determine the stability reliability and precision of frontal-plane knee angle measures during sagittal-plane vertical jump performance. Methods: Subjects were 60 young adults (31 men, 29 women). All were fitted with reflective anatomical markers to define and track the right side of the pelvis and lower extremity during 3 constrained-arm-swing countermovement vertical jumps (CMVJ) that incorporated self-selected countermovement depths. Three-dimensional joint kinematics were collected using an 8-camera motion capture system at a sampling rate of 240 Hz, proprietary software, and a USB analog acquisition interface. Additional proprietary software was then used to process 3D joint angles using an 8 Hz lowpass filter (knee frontal plane measures reported herein). Data were analyzed for the highest jump from each of 2 identical sessions. Frontal-plane knee alignment angles were obtained for the right lower limb during jumping at the following positions: 1) end of the countermovement, 2) peak knee adduction, 3) take-off, and 4) peak knee abduction. In addition, maximum frontal-plane knee excursion was calculated as the difference between peak adduction and peak abduction. Stability reliability was determined using an intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC, two-way random model), and precision using both the standard error of measurement (SEM) and the coefficient of variation (CV%). Statistical analyses were performed for all subjects, as well as separately for men and women. Results: Study findings are presented in Table 1. Conclusion: Stability reliability was moderate and precision poor for all designated frontal plane angular measures for men and women during CMVJ. Practical Applications: Because of poor precision, averaging frontal-plane knee angles over multiple sessions may be appropriate when interpreting output. Variations in reflective marker placements need to be meticulously avoided.\n\nThursday, July 11, 2019, 12:00 pm–1:30 pm\n\nCountermovement Jump Qualities of Elite Academy Rugby Union Players\n\nC. Owen,1 K. Till, P. Phibbs,1 D. Read,1 J. Weakley,1 M. Atkinson,2 K. Stokes,2 S. Williams,2 S. Kemp,3 and B. Jones\n\n1Leeds Beckett University; 2University of Bath; and 3Rugby Football Union\n\nPurpose: Identify positional kinetic and kinematic countermovement jump (CMJ) variables of elite Under 18 (U18) academy rugby union players. Methods: With ethics approval, 166 U18 male rugby union players (front row n = 35; second row n = 16; back row n = 40; half backs n = 34; centres n = 15; back 3 n = 26) from 6 English Regional Academies (age 17.3 ± 0.7 years; height 181.0 ± 8.3 cm; body mass 88.6 ± 14.2 kg) participated in the study. Participants completed 2 maximal CMJ on 2 portable force platforms (Pasco PS-2141, Roseville, CA, USA) sampling at 500 Hz. The mean of the 2 trials was used for analysis. Following the testing a custom-designed R-script was used to find kinetic (peak force, mean rate of force development, impulse, peak power and total area under the force velocity curve) and kinematic variables (take-off velocity, jump height, centre of mass displacement and reactive strength index modified) for each jump identifying eccentric and concentric jump phases where applicable. Principal component (PC) analysis was conducted to identify the variance explained by the variables and collinearity. From the first 3 PCs (i.e., power and force variables [PC1; 35%], impulse [PC2; 27%] and velocity [PC3; 25%]), variables with the greatest loading factors were selected for analysis using a one-way ANOVA and Tukey Kramer post hoc (α = 0.05) to identify positional differences once normality had been assured. Results: Significant between position differences were observed for area under the force velocity curve (F(5,160) = 4.851, p = < 0.001), concentric impulse (F(5,160) = 21.91, p = < 0.001) and take off velocity (F(5,160) = 10.18, p = < 0.001). Positional data and significant post hoc differences are shown in Table 1. Conclusion: These findings suggest that kinetic and kinematic characteristics in the CMJ vary by playing position in U18 academy rugby union players. Heavier front row and second row forwards produced greater area under the force velocity curve especially when compared to half backs. Centres were able to produce similar area under the force velocity curve to the front row, however along with the rest of the backs and back row, a significantly lower concentric impulse is observed potentially due to lower force producing capabilities or a shorter force application time. In contrast, all positions except for the second row achieved significantly higher take-off velocities than the front row, with back 3 players achieving the greatest velocity. Practical Applications: It is essential for practitioners to develop physical qualities that are specific to a given athlete and their role in competition. Results from the present study suggest that a multivariate approach may provide additional information for monitoring neuromuscular performance. The positional differences observed in this study should be combined with knowledge of match demands to determine a suitable training intervention for U18 rugby union players.\n\nThursday, July 11, 2019, 12:00 pm–1:30 pm\n\nFunctional Movement Patterns and Perceived Mobility in Collegiate Lacrosse Athletes\n\nC. Rosenborough, S. Collins, E. Smith, and T. Bowman\n\nUniversity of Lynchburg\n\nThe stress on the body from sport participation may play a role in an athlete's ability to function throughout a season. Purpose: To examine the effects of a non-traditional lacrosse fall season on functional movement patterns for both males and females, while secondarily observing how collegiate lacrosse athletes perceived mobility. Methods: Fifty males (age = 19.38 ± 1.24 years, height = 182.63 ± 6.16 cm, mass = 82.37 ± 8.46 kg) and 22 females (age = 19.68 ± 1.17 years, height = 165.10 ± 6.88 cm, mass = 64.09 ± 8.72 kg) who participated on National Collegiate Athletic Association Division III lacrosse teams volunteered to participate. The independent variable was time (pre, post). Pre- and post-test mobility scores were measured 2 weeks before and after the season, respectively. Main outcome measures included functional mobility and perceived mobility scores. We measured perceived mobility postseason using functional movements by asking participants to grade themselves on each movement. Data was analyzed using a 1-way repeated measure ANOVA for each sex separately. A chi-square analysis was used to determine the change in asymmetry frequency. We set an alpha value of 0.05 for significance. Results: Time significantly increased female mobility scores from preseason (mean = 15.27 ± 2.25) to postseason (mean = 16.05 ± 1.50; F1,21 = 4.46, p = 0.05, η2 = 0.18). However, males' total mobility scores did not significantly differ from preseason (mean = 15.60 ± 1.86) to postseason (mean = 15.64 ± 1.71; F1,49 = 0.03, p = 0.87, η2 = 0.001, 1-β = 0.05). There was not a significant difference in the number of male (preseason = 8, postseason = 4; η21 = 2.38, p = 0.12) or female participants (preseason = 5, postseason = 1; η21 = 2.15, p = 0.14) that recorded a total mobility score below the injury risk cut off of 14 at the end of the season. Time significantly increased the number of male athletes with an asymmetry on the hurdle step (preseason N = 2, postseason N = 9; η21 = 25.52, p < 0.001), inline lunge (preseason N = 10, postseason N = 20; η21 = 12.50, p < 0.001) and shoulder mobility (preseason N = 4, postseason N = 21; η21 = 78.53, p < 0.001) while male active straight leg raise asymmetries decreased (preseason N = 26, postseason N = 8; η21 = 25.96, p < 0.001). Significant differences in male measured score and perceived mobility scores were found in all movements except for right shoulder mobility (p = 0.82) and right active straight leg raise (p = 0.05). Conclusion: An 8-week fall lacrosse season has significant effects on functional movement in various areas. These changes may lead to alterations in the kinetic chain resulting in joint hypomobility, hypermobility and compensatory patterns. Practical Applications: The results of this study indicate that mobility changes in both male and female lacrosse athletes over the course of a season in different areas. Sports medicine and strength and conditioning professionals should be aware of male athletes overestimating self-reported mobility and therefore not addressing deficits independently.\n\nThursday, July 11, 2019, 12:00 pm–1:30 pm\n\nThe Effects of Concurrent Activation Potentiation on Average and Peak Power During Submaximal Deadlift Exercise\n\nC. Allen,1 E. Recanzone,2 and A. Bittinger\n\n1Florida Southern College; and 2Florida Southern College\n\nConcurrent activation potentiation (CAP) is the ergogenic phenomenon of increased agonist muscular and performance characteristics achieved through remote voluntary contractions (RVC) performed simultaneously with prime mover activation. Research examining CAP has focused primarily on muscular force production characteristics and not on power output. Given the purported ergogenic benefits, the influence of CAP on power output warrants investigation. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of maximal jaw clenching and maximal jaw opening on average and peak power output during the deadlift exercise against a submaximal resistance. Methods: Eight male (age 21.75 ± 2.87 years; height 179.86 ± 5.6 cm; mass 83.05 ± 8.00 kg) and 9 females (age 20.11 ± 1.05 years; height 162.28 ± 8.54 cm; mass 61.66 ± 9.41 kg) considered intermediate to advanced resistance trained athletes visited the lab on 2 occasions. The first visit involved provision of written consent, one repetition maximum (1RM) deadlift assessment, and familiarization with subsequent data collection procedures. The second visit, which occurred between 72 hours and one week following the initial visit, consisted of submaximal deadlifts at 65% of 1RM performed under 3 experimental conditions: jaw maximally clenched, jaw maximally opened, and jaw relaxed (control condition). Experimental conditions were counterbalanced between subjects to eliminate possible order effects. Subjects were instructed to initiate the experimental condition simultaneously with maximal force application to the bar, and to complete the concentric phase of the deadlift as fast as possible. Average and peak barbell movement velocity was recorded with a Tendo Power & Speed Analyzer (Tendo Sports Machines, Slovak Republic). Three trials were performed under each condition, and velocity measurements from each trial were averaged. A 1 × 3 repeated measures ANOVA was used to determine if a difference between conditions existed. Pairwise comparisons with Bonferroni adjustment determined specific differences between groups. Results: There was a statistically significant difference between conditions for both average (p = 0.016) and peak (p = 0.014) power. Pairwise comparisons demonstrated that maximum jaw clenching (p = 0.031) and maximum jaw opening (p = 0.012) significantly improved peak power output when compared to the jaw relaxed condition. Additionally, maximal jaw clenching (p = 0.101) and maximum jaw opening (p = 0.011) improved average power output in comparison to the jaw relaxed condition, however, only the maximal jaw opening condition was statistically significant. Conclusion: Both clenching and opening the jaw maximally, enhances power output during submaximal resistance exercise. Although the proposed use of maximal jaw opening as an RVC is relatively new, it may be more effective at provoking CAP than maximal jaw clenching. Practical Applications: CAP produced by maximal jaw muscle activation improves average and peak power output during resistance training exercise. Coaches can encourage athletes to incorporate maximal jaw clenching or opening as an acute performance enhancing strategy during strength and conditioning training activities.\n\nThursday, July 11, 2019, 12:00 pm–1:30 pm\n\nConcurrent Activation Potentiation Improves Barbell Velocity During Submaximal Deadlift Exercise\n\nE. Recanzone1, A. Bittinger, and C. Allen2\n\n1Florida Southern College; and 2Florida Southern College\n\nThe acceleration of an object will increase as net force applied to the object increases. This increase in acceleration will increase the object's movement velocity. Concurrent activation potentiation (CAP) is the ergogenic advantage of increased agonist muscular and performance characteristics attained through simultaneous activation of musculature not involved in the activity of interest. Research examining the CAP phenomenon has focused primarily on muscular activation and force production characteristics. The influence of CAP on exercise movement velocity remains unclear. Purpose: The purpose of this investigation was to examine the impact of CAP, achieved via maximal jaw clenching and maximal jaw opening, on barbell movement velocity during the deadlift exercise with submaximal resistance. Methods: Eight male (age 21.75 ± 2.87 years; height 179.86 ± 5.6 cm; mass 83.05 ± 8.00 kg) and 9 females (age 20.11 ± 1.05 years; height 162.28 ± 8.54 cm; mass 61.66 ± 9.41 kg) considered intermediate to advanced resistance trained athletes visited the lab on 2 occasions. The first visit involved provision of written consent, one repetition maximum (1RM) deadlift assessment, and familiarization with subsequent data collection procedures. The second visit, which occurred between 72 hours and one week following the initial visit, consisted of submaximal deadlifts at 65% of 1RM performed under 3 experimental conditions: jaw maximally clenched, jaw maximally opened, and jaw relaxed (control condition). Experimental conditions were counterbalanced between subjects to eliminate possible order effects. Subjects were instructed to initiate the experimental condition simultaneously with maximal force application to the bar and to complete the concentric phase of the deadlift as fast as possible. Average and peak barbell movement velocity was recorded using a Tendo Power & Speed Analyzer (Tendo Sports Machines, Slovak Republic). Three trials were performed under each condition, and velocity measurements from each trial were averaged. A 1 × 3 repeated measures ANOVA was used to determine if a difference between conditions existed. Pairwise comparisons with Bonferroni adjustment determined specific differences between groups. Results: There was a statistically significant difference between experimental conditions for both average (p = 0.003) and peak (p = 0.01) velocities. Pairwise comparisons demonstrated that maximum jaw clenching (p = 0.042) and maximum jaw opening (p = 0.002) significantly improved average movement velocity when compared to the jaw relaxed condition. Maximal jaw clenching (p = 0.061) and maximum jaw opening (p = 0.006) also improved peak movement velocity in comparison to the jaw relaxed condition, however, only the maximal jaw opening condition was statistically significant. Conclusion: CAP achieved by maximally clenching or opening the jaw is effective at enhancing barbell movement velocity during the submaximal deadlift exercise, presumably by augmenting agonist muscular force production characteristics. Maximal jaw opening is just as effective at inducing CAP if not more so, than maximal jaw clenching. Practical Applications: Maximally activating jaw musculature to either clench or open the jaw is effective at eliciting CAP to enhance performance. Strength and conditioning professionals may encourage maximal jaw clenching and opening during resistance training exercises to enhance force production and movement velocity.\n\nThursday, July 11, 2019, 12:00 pm–1:30 pm\n\nThe Effects of Concurrent Activation Potentiation on Bat Swing Velocity of Division II College Softball Athletes\n\nA. Mace, S. Terrell, Z. Wallace, and C. Allen\n\nFlorida Southern College\n\nConcurrent activation potentiation (CAP), achieved by remote voluntary contractions (RVC) such as jaw clenching, has been proposed to enhance performance in male but not female athletes. CAP has been shown to enhance muscular performance characteristics, yet its effects on sports performance outcomes such as bat swing velocity (BSV), which is an important component for successful hitting in softball, has not been investigated. Furthermore, it remains unclear as to whether RVC produces a similar ergogenic effect in women as it does in men. Purpose: The purpose of this research was to examine the effects of maximal jaw clenching on bat swing velocity in collegiate division II softball players. Methods: Thirteen (n = 13) division II softball players (age 19.79 ± 1.31 years; height 167.69 ± 6.91 cm; mass 68.23 ± 8.68 kg) volunteered to participate in this study. Subjects were instructed to complete their normal warmup routine as if preparing for a game at-bat. Following the warmup, subjects completed 10 maximal effort swings targeting a softball on a tee. Five swings were performed while maximally clenching the jaw and 5 with relaxed jaw musculature (control condition). Conditions were counterbalanced between subjects to account for possible order effects. Each subject was given 30 seconds of rest between swing attempts. Tee height, tee placement, and bat used varied between subjects but remained consistent for all swing attempts. BSV was recorded using an inertial measurement unit (Zepp Sensor, Zepp Labs, Inc.) attached to the knob of the bat, and all recorded trials were averaged for analysis. Paired sample t-tests were utilized to determine differences between jaw clenched and jaw relaxed conditions. Results: Mean swing velocity for the control condition was 28.02 m/s (62.68 mph) and 29.42 m/s (65.82 mph) for the jaw clenched condition, producing a statistically significant mean difference of 1.4 m/s (3.14 mph) (p = 0.003). Conclusion: Maximally clenching the jaw while swinging a softball bat is a useful strategy to improve BSV in Division II college softball players. Additionally, CAP via maximal jaw clenching appears to improve aspects of athletic performance in female athletes. Practical Applications: CAP, achieved by maximally clenching the jaw, is a practical and legal ergogenic strategy to produce increased BSV in female athletes. Since BSV is an important component of successful hitting, coaches may encourage softball athletes to incorporate this RVC technique in their hitting approach as the increase in BSV could positively influence hitting performance.\n\nThursday, July 11, 2019, 12:00 pm–1:30 pm\n\nNeuromuscular Responses in Unilateral Strength Discrepancies Within the Lower Limb Bilateral Deficit\n\nM. Byrd1, T. Dinyer1, P. Succi1, and H. Bergstrom2\n\n1University of Kentucky; and 2University of Kentucky\n\nThe bilateral deficit (BLD) is the phenomenon in which the sum of the forces produced unilaterally (right and left separately) is greater than the force produced bilaterally (right and left together) during maximal contractions of the limbs. Bilateral contractions within the lower limbs have previously resulted in lower or no differences between the neuromuscular responses of the limbs. Thus, there are limited and conflicting data regarding neuromuscular responses during the assessment of the bilateral deficit. Purpose: This study examined the neuromuscular responses within subjects that demonstrated a lower limb BLD accompanied by the presences of strength discrepancies between the lower limbs during the unilateral muscular strength assessments. Methods: Nine (male: n = 6; female: n = 3) subjects (mean ± SD age: 24.4 ± 4.6 years, height: 178.0 ± 7.7 cm, body mass: 80.0 ± 11.1 kg) completed randomized, isometric, seated leg extension bilateral and unilateral maximum voluntary isometric contractions (MVIC) followed by randomized, bilateral and unilateral dynamic, seated leg extension for the determination of the 1 repetition maximum (1RM) strength. The magnitude of the BLD was assessed using the bilateral index (BI [%] = (100 × (bilateral strength/right unilateral + left unilateral) − 100). The electromyographic (EMG) and mechanomyographic (MMG) amplitude (AMP) and mean power frequency (MPF) were measured from the vastus lateralis of the right and left lower limbs during the MVIC and 1RM trials. The 1RM neuromuscular signals were normalized to the corresponding signals recorded during the MVIC trials. Statistical analyses included paired samples t-test (p ≤ 0.05). Results: The lower limb BLD resulted in a BI of −8.7% ± 4.2%. Among the unilateral strength measures, each subject presented with a lower limb unilateral strength discrepancy (p = 0.00008; strong limb (SL) 40.7 ± 8.2 kg, weak limb (WL) 37.3 ± 7.7 kg). The SL had a significantly greater EMG AMP (p = 0.04), compared to the WL during the unilateral dynamic, seated leg extension 1RM measure, however, there were no difference in EMG AMP between the SL and WL during the bilateral dynamic (p = 0.1), seated leg extension 1RM measure. There were no differences for the EMG MPF, MMG AMP, or MMG MPF for either the unilateral or bilateral dynamic, seated leg extension 1RM measure. Conclusion: These findings indicated the lower limb unilateral strength discrepancies within subjects with a lower limb BLD could be due to greater global motor unit activation in the SL compared to the WL during unilateral movements. Practical Applications: When measuring bilateral strength, it cannot be assumed each limb is contributing evenly and it may be beneficial to take into account any unilateral strength discrepancies that are present. Training for improvement of any unilateral strength discrepancies may also carry over to greater bilateral strength improvements.\n\nThursday, July 11, 2019, 12:00 pm–1:30 pm\n\nAssessing the Impact of Vibration on Rectus Femoris During a Bodyweight Squat: A Pilot Study\n\nM. McDermott, E. Hutton, S. Yamasaki, S. Arter, J. Glauser, J. Schoffstall, A. Bosak, and R. Lowell\n\nLiberty University\n\nWhole-body vibration (WBV) exposes the entire body to mechanical oscillations while the subject is standing on a platform. WBV has emerged as a training and rehabilitation modality in recent years. Therefore, evaluating the use of vibration in a performance setting is crucial. Prior research has assessed electromyographic response of the quadricep and hamstring muscles using vibration during static squat exercise, however, to the best of the researchers' knowledge, no research has been conducted to assess the activity of the rectus femoris using WBV during the dynamic squat movement. It is hypothesized that the vibrations of the platform will cause increased motor unit recruitment, causing the rectus femoris to produce a higher root mean squared (RMS) value when compared to the RMS value without vibration. It is logical to assume that greater RMS values during WBV could indicate the recruitment of more motor units during exercise with this modality. Purpose: To compare electromyographic (EMG) output values of the rectus femoris during the whole-body squat (WBS) with WBV vs. output during WBS without WBV. Methods: After completing a PAR-Q and informed consent form, and prior to any testing, subjects were asked to remove their shoes in order to eliminate the variability that different footwear may have had on the potential results. FMS deep squat protocol was used to assess 14 Division 1 NCAA track and field athletes (8 male, 6 female) for adequate squat form. Following a dynamic warm-up protocol, a wired EMG sensor was placed on the right leg over the rectus femoris muscle belly. Subjects performed 15 repetitions of WBS on the ground, followed by an eight-minute rest period. Subjects then performed 15 repetitions of WBS on a WBV platform vibrating at a frequency of 40 MHz. Throughout testing, EMG data was collected. The RMS value was recorded from both trials for each subject. RMS values for WBS during trials with and without WBV for each subject were compared using a Paired-Samples t-Test with an alpha level at p ≤ 0.05. Results: WBV values were significantly greater than ground squat values regarding mean RMS (96.7 ± 33.7 vs. 74.6 ± 28.7 µV, p < 0.01). Conclusion: A significantly greater RMS value during WBV trials possibly indicates that the rectus femoris was more active when performing WBS with WBV. Practical Applications: A significant increase in muscle activity of the rectus femoris during the WBV trial potentially suggests that more motor units are recruited when the body is experiencing WBV. Higher levels of muscle activity in an equal amount of time provides evidence that WBV may be a more efficient form of training. Further research should be completed with a larger sample size and with a focus on the separation of genders in order to examine the effects of WBV on muscle activity.\n\nThursday, July 11, 2019, 12:00 pm–1:30 pm\n\nThe Effects of a Vertical Jump Fatigue Test on Lactate Production and Heart Rate\n\nE. Mosier,1 A. Fry,2 J. Nicoll,3 and S. Sontag2\n\n1Northwest Missouri State University; 2University of Kansas; and 3California State University, Northridge\n\nThere are numerous anaerobic tests that use different modes of exercise or movement patterns, while also varying in duration, which can help assess anaerobic endurance. Purpose: This study examined the effects of a vertical jump fatigue test on blood lactate (HLa) concentrations and heart rate (HR) in men and women. Methods: Healthy, recreationally active women (±SD; n = 11, age = 20.8 ± 1.1 years, hgt. = 172.2 ± 7.4 cm, wgt. = 68.0 ± 7.2 kg) and men (n = 11, age = 23.0 ± 2.6 years, hgt. = 180.3 ± 4.8 cm, wgt. = 80.4 ± 7.3 kg) served as subjects. Each subject completed 2 randomized experimental sessions (i.e., control session (CON), and VJ fatigue protocol). During the VJ test each subject was instructed to bend the knee to 90° and jump explosively and repeat immediately on landing for a total of 5 sets. Each set consisted of 15 seconds jumping, 15 seconds rest, 15 seconds jumping, and 15 seconds rest. During the CON session each subject would sit relaxed for 15 minutes. A uni-axial force plate and a data acquisition system sampling at 1,000 Hz was used to monitor the ground reaction forces. HR was collected pre-test and post-test with a chest monitor strap. Each subject provided blood samples at Baseline (arrival), Pre (5 minutes pre-test), and Post (2.5 minutes post-test). Samples were analyzed with a Lactate Plus blood lactate analyzer. Three-way repeated measures ANOVAs (sex × condition × time) were performed on HLa and heart rate. Paired samples t-tests were used to examine the differences in flight times and positive impulses of the second jump of set 1 and last jump of set 10 during the VJ test. These VJs were selected to include the preceding VJ rebound and the next CMVJ. Post hoc comparisons were conducted when needed using the Bonferroni correction. The level of significant was set to p ≤ 0.05 for the statistical tests. Results: The ANOVAs indicated a significant 3-way interaction (condition × sex × time) for HLa concentrations (p < 0.01), and a significant 2-way interaction (condition × time) for HR (p < 0.01). Follow-up analyses indicated significant differences between pre-and post-tests for HLa concentrations. Paired samples t-tests indicated a significant interaction for flight time and positive impulse between set 1 and set 2 jumps for both men and women (Table 1). Conclusion: The results indicated the modified VJ test induced fatigue responses in both men and women as indicated by the significantly increased HLa and HR responses. In addition, flight time and positive impulses indicated individuals spent more time on the ground and less time in the air. Practical Applications: The current study evaluated a potential testing method to help evaluate anaerobic fatigue. This may provide the strength and conditioning professional helpful longitudinal information as an athlete progresses through a training program and season.\n\nThursday, July 11, 2019, 12:00 pm–1:30 pm\n\nDoes Regular Resistance Training Improve Lower-Extremity Functionality in Competitive Cheer and Dance Athletes?\n\nQ. Johnson,1 C. Anthony,1 C. Diehl, M. Snow,2 and D. Smith\n\n1Oklahoma State University; and 2Midland University\n\nMovement assessments are often used as components of strength and conditioning, as well as athletic training programs in order to determine biomechanical efficiency, movement limitations, and to assist in developing corrective exercise protocols. Although there is extensive research on Functional Movement Screen (FMS) performance in athletic populations, very few have examined the variables that may affect such in competitive cheer and dance athletes. We hypothesized that regular participation in resistance training programs would significantly improve lower-extremity functionality and performance on the FMS assessment. Purpose: To compare differences in lower-extremity functionality between resistance trained (RT) versus non-resistance trained (NRT) competitive cheer and dance athletes by utilizing 5 components of the FMS; deep squat (DS), hurdle-step (HS), in-line lunge (ILL), active straight leg raise (ASLR), and total score (TS). Methods: Fifty-three competitive cheer and dance athletes (RT = 33, NRT = 20) volunteered for this study. Athletes in the RT group participated in an undulating resistance training program at least 2–3 days per week for ≥16 weeks, while athletes in the NRT group did not participate in resistance training. Athletes had their movement ability assessed by FMS certified personnel prior to beginning their competitive season. Each participant was briefed and provided with proper instruction prior to performing each movement. All data was analyzed using PASW software version 24.0 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL, USA). The University Institutional Review Board for human subject's research approved this study and all subjects signed a written informed consent document prior to participation. Separate 1-way ANOVAs were run for each dependent variable. Results: A significant interaction was observed for TS between RT and NRT groups (p = 0.000). Additionally, the RT performed significantly better on the DS (p = 0.000), HS (p = 0.011), ILL (p = 0.038), and ASLR (p = 0.036) when compared to the NRT group. Conclusion: This study observed significant differences in FMS performance in RT versus NRT cheer and dance athletes. This suggests that an increased exposure to resistance training is beneficial for improving the functional biomechanics involved in lower-extremity dominant movements. Practical Applications: Introducing resistance training into training protocols may be an effective method for improving functional movement capacities, which may translate to increased execution of sport-specific movements.\n\nThursday, July 11, 2019, 12:00 pm–1:30 pm\n\nDoes Age-Related Loss of Muscle Size and Motor Units Affect the Speed of the Sensorimotor Integration: A Pilot Study\n\nT. Blackstock,1 M. Magrini,2 R. Colquhoun,3 M. Ferrell,1 S. Fleming,1 N. Jenkins,1 and J. DeFreitas4\n\n1Oklahoma State University; 2Creighton University; 3University of South Alabama; and 4OKlahoma State University\n\nThe reactive leg drop (RLD) is a novel assessment designed to examine the rapid sensorimotor integration necessary to recover from a slip and avoid a fall. Previous research has suggested that the age-related loss of muscle mass and functioning motor units may be a leading cause of non-workplace related falls. Purpose: Therefore, the purpose of this pilot study was to evaluate age-related differences between and relationships among measures of muscle size, motor unit number estimation (MUNE), and speed of sensorimotor integration. Methods: Seventeen (Young: n = 9, 22 ± 3 years; Older: n = 8, 71 ± 5 years) adults participated in this study. For the RLD, participants were seated with their eyes closed while the investigator held their leg in full extension (180°) with an elastic band. The researcher released the band once their leg was fully relaxed. The participants were instructed to kick back up as fast as possible once they felt their leg falling. The drop angle was measured with an electro-goniometer secured to the participant's knee and calculated as the difference between the starting position and the lowest point reached before the participant kicked their leg back up. The muscle cross-sectional area of the vastus lateralis (VL mCSA) was examined using an ultrasound. MUNE was calculated as the ratio of the ensemble average of the single motor unit potential amplitude to the compound muscle action potential amplitude and was corrected for alternation. Independent samples t-test were used to analyze age differences in RLD drop angle, VL mCSA and MUNE. Pearson correlation coefficients were used to analyze the relationships between the 3 measures. Results: Significant age differences were observed between MUNE (Y: 281.9 ± 41.4; O: 141.5 ± 27.3; p£0.001), VL mCSA (Y: 27.8 ± 4.5; O: 8.3 ± 2.8 cm2; p £ 0.001) and drop angle, (Y: 38.6 ± 8.7°; O: 69.6 ± 22.3°; p = 0.003). Further, drop angle was significantly related to VL mCSA (r = −0.64, p = 0.008) (Figure A), MUNE (r = −0.67, p = 0.005) (Figure B), and age (r = 0.64, p = 0.008). Conclusion: The significant age differences showed that older adults have smaller muscles, less remaining motor units, and a slower response to a sudden lower-body perturbation. The significant correlations suggest that smaller muscles with fewer functioning motor units are related to slower sensorimotor integration. However, caution should be taken when interpreting these results due to the limited number of participants in this initial pilot study. Practical Applications: The reactive leg drop is a robust assessment that can be quite useful for clinicians and practitioners. This novel assessment not only examines the speed of sensorimotor integration, but it may also be sensitive to sarcopenia-related changes in older adults.\n\nThursday, July 11, 2019, 12:00 pm–1:30 pm\n\nQuadriceps Cross-Sectional Area Is Related to Voluntary and Evoked, but Not Rapid Torque Production\n\nH. Bryan,1 R. Colquhoun,2 P. Tomko,1 M. Magrini,3 S. Fleming,1 N. Banks,1 M. Ferrell,1 and N. Jenkins1\n\n1Oklahoma State University; 2University of South Alabama; and 3Creighton University\n\nIntroduction: Skeletal muscle force production is a crucial aspect of many athletic events. Although not linear, it is generally accepted that there is a strong relationship between the cross-sectional area (mCSA) of a muscle and its maximal force production during voluntary contractions. However, the relationship among mCSA, a muscle's contractile properties, and the influence of a muscle's contractile properties on maximal force production remain unclear. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship among vastus lateralis (VL) mCSA, maximal voluntary contraction strength, and contractile torque production. We hypothesized that CSA would be related to both maximal voluntary strength and contractile torque production. Methods: Thirty-eight college-aged males (age = 23 ± 3; height = 177.2 ± 5.3 cm; weight = 87.7 ± 13.2 kg) volunteered to participate in this study. Ultrasound images of the right VL were obtained from each subject in order to quantify CSA. Contractile properties of the right quadriceps were assessed via transcutaneous electrical stimulation of the femoral nerve, and isometric peak twitch torque (PTT) and peak rate of twitch torque development (pRTTD) were calculated. Maximal voluntary torque (MVT) was also measured during a maximal isometric contraction. All measurements took place during the same visit and with the participant's knee joint set at approximately 90°. Bivariate correlations and stepwise multiple linear regression were used to examine the relationships and relative contributions of VL CSA, PTT, and pRTTD to MVT. Results: There were significant, positive relationships between VL CSA and MVT (p < 0.001; r = 0.755), VL CSA and PTT (p = 0.023; r = 0.369), and PTT and pRTTD (p < 0.001; r = 0.604). However, no significant relationships were observed between VL CSA and pRTTD (p = 0.536; r = 0.104), PTT and MVT (p = 0.07; r = 0.297), or pRTTD and MVT (p = 0.77; r = −0.05). The stepwise MLR suggested that only mCSA significantly contributed to the prediction of MVT (R2 = 0.57; beta coefficient = mCSA [0.755]). Conclusion: There was a significant, positive relationship between muscle size and voluntary and evoked strength of the quadriceps femoris in college-aged males. Furthermore, only mCSA contributed to the prediction of MVT in our sample. Moreover, there was no relationship between mCSA and pRTTD. Practical Applications: There was a strong, positive relationship between muscle size and voluntary strength in our sample. Thus, in this sample, those with larger VLs were able to produce greater torque. However, it is not clear from these data what role increasing muscle size has in increasing strength. Further, there was no relationship between muscle size or maximal voluntary strength and the rate of torque production during a contractile twitch. This may suggest that pRTTD is instead related to factors (e.g., calcium kinetics) other than muscle size and may not influence maximal voluntary strength capabilities.\n\nThursday, July 11, 2019, 12:00 pm–1:30 pm\n\nEffects of Knee Wraps on Immune Cell Mobilization Following Resistance Exercise Designed to Induce Muscle Damage\n\nE. Tagesen,1 J. Laudato,1 B. Gibson,1 C. Dulaney, C. Trionfante,2 and A. Jajtner\n\n1Kent State University; and 2Miami University\n\nPrior studies utilizing knee wraps (KWs) while performing a back squat have demonstrated a mechanical advantage that increases exercise volume and load. Purpose: To determine if knee wraps modify the immune response to resistance exercise. Methods: Nine resistance trained men (22.6 ± 3.6 years; 177.1 ± 5.4 cm; 83.2 ± 17.3 kg) were recruited to participate in either a KW or control (CON) condition. During visit 1, participants performed a 1-repetition max (1-RM) and were required to attain a 1-RM between 1.5x and 3.0x their body weight. Participants then returned to the Exercise Performance and Recovery Lab for visit 2 at least 72 hours later, having fasted at least 10 hours, abstained from caffeine for 16 hours, nicotine and alcohol for at least 24 hours, and exercise for 72 hours. During this visit, participants completed a 5-minute warm up on a cycle ergometer at a self-selected pace before completing 8 sets of 10 repetitions of the squat at 70% of their 1-RM, with 2 minutes rest between sets. Blood samples were obtained prior to exercise (PRE), immediately after (IP), 1-(1H), 24-(24H) and 48-(48H) hours after exercise. Blood was immediately analyzed for total leukocyte count (WBC), as well as the number (#) and ratio (%) of lymphocytes (LY), monocytes (MO), and granulocytes (GR) using an automated hematology analyzer. Differences between conditions were analyzed using a Mann-Whitney U test, while differences across time were assessed with a Friedman's ANOVA, and post-hoc analysis with a Wilcoxon rank sum test. Results: Friedman's ANOVA demonstrated differences (p = 0.005) in the KW group for WBC, with increases observed from PRE (5.74 ± 1.41 × 103·µL−1) to IP (9.73 ± 1.15 × 103·µL−1; p = 0.043), with no differences at 1H (5.41 ± 1.04 × 103·µL−1), 24H (5.17 ± 1.13 × 103·µL−1), or 48H (5.12 ± 1.07 × 103·µL−1). Friedman's ANOVA also indicated differences (p = 0.004) in the KW group for LY%, with increases from PRE (34.7 ± 3.8%) at IP (40.9 ± 4.48%; p = 0.043) and a decrease at 1H (22.6 ± 3.1%; p = 0.043). Friedman's ANOVA revealed differences (p = 0.002) for the KW group in LY#, with an increase (p = 0.043) from PRE (1.96 ± 0.39 ×103·µL−1) at IP (3.97 ± 0.597 ×103·µL−1). Friedman's ANOVA indicated differences (p = 0.015) in the KW group for MO#, with increases (p = 0.043) at IP (0.67 ± 0.17 ×103·µL−1) compared to PRE (0.38 ± 0.102 ×103·µL−1), 1H (0.25 ± 0.12 ×103·µL−1), 24H (0.30 ± 0.11 ×103·µL−1) and 48H (0.32 ± 0.08 ×103·µL−1). Additionally, at IP, MO# were greater in KW (0.67 ± 0.17 × 103·µL−1; p = 0.036) versus CON (0.59 ± 0.13 × 103·µL−1). Friedman's ANOVA demonstrated differences (p = 0.004) in the KW group for GR% with increases (p = 0.043) from PRE (58.1 ± 5.1%) and IP (52.4 ± 5.1%) at 1H (73.2 ± 3.8%). Friedman's ANOVA demonstrated differences (p = 0.003) in the KW group for GR# with increases (p < 0.05) at IP (5.11 ± 0.87 × 103·µL−1) compared to PRE (3.37 ± 1.10 × 103·µL−1), 1H (3.95 ± 0.77 ×103·µL−1), 24H (3.05 ± 0.67 × 103·µL−1) and 48H (2.79 ± 0.60 × 103·µL−1). Conclusion: A significant increase in circulating WBCs suggest KWs may increase the immune response possibly due to increased exercise volume. Additionally, the monocyte response to exercise with KW may be enhanced, especially immediately after exercise. Practical Applications: KWs appear to increase the immune response to resistance exercise, which may increase post-exercise inflammation. Therefore, further research is necessary to determine if the use of KWs is beneficial to the athletes.\n\nThursday, July 11, 2019, 12:00 pm–1:30 pm\n\nComparison of Lymphocyte Subset Responses to High-Intensity Interval Training, Sprint Interval Training, and Moderate-Intensity Continuous Training\n\nE. Arroyo,1 E. Tagesen,1 T. Hart,2 B. Miller,1 and A. Jajtner\n\n1Kent State University; and 2n/a\n\nPurpose: To compare the effects of high-intensity interval training (HIIT), sprint interval training (SIT), and moderate-intensity continuous training (MCT) on lymphocyte subset populations. Methods: Recreationally active men (n = 3; 21.3 ± 3.5 years; 182.8 ± 6.3 cm; 79.4 ± 8.7; 11.2 ± 5.8 %BF; 44.1 ± 3.2 ml·kg−1·min−1) completed a maximal graded exercise test (Vo2max) and 3 exercise trials (HIIT, SIT, and MCT) in a randomized, counterbalanced fashion on a cycle ergometer. HIIT consisted of fifteen 90-second bouts at 85% Vo2max interspersed with 90-second active recovery periods. SIT consisted of fifteen 20-second bouts at 130% maximum wattage interspersed with 160-second active recovery periods. MCT was a continuous bout at 65% Vo2max. Each trial lasted 53 minutes, including a 5-minute warm-up and a 3-minute cool-down. Blood was collected before (PRE), immediately post (IP), 30 minutes (30P), 2 hours (2H), 6 hours (6H) and 24 hours (24H) post-exercise. The number and percentage of lymphocyte subsets (CD3+CD4+, CD3+CD8+, CD3−CD56brightCD16−, CD3−CD56dimCD16+, and CD3−CD19+) were analyzed via flow cytometry. Total lymphocyte count was analyzed via hematology analyzer. Changes were assessed using a 2 factor (time × trial) within-subjects repeated measures ANOVA. Results: A significant time × trial interaction was observed for CD3+CD4+ percentage (F = 2.989, p = 0.018) and count (F = 2.653, p = 0.030). CD3+CD4+ count decreased from PRE to 24H in both MCT (p = 0.007) and SIT (p = 0.030), but not HIIT (p > 0.05). During HIIT, CD3+CD4+ count was increased from PRE to IP (p = 0.008). A significant time × trial interaction was observed for CD3+CD8+ (F = 4.909, p = 0.001) and CD3−CD19+ counts (F = 2.536, p = 0.037). CD3+CD8+ count was elevated at 6H compared to 2H in both MCT (p = 0.016) and HIIT (p = 0.032), but not SIT. For HIIT, CD3−CD19+ count was greater at IP relative to PRE (p = 0.019), 30P (p = 0.033), and 24H (p = 0.041). A significant time × trial interaction was observed for CD3−CD56brightCD16− count (F = 6.010, p < 0.001). At IP, CD3−CD56brightCD16− count was greater for HIIT compared to MCT (p = 0.017) and SIT (p = 0.013). A significant time × trial interaction was observed CD3−CD56dimCD16+ percentage (F = 4.206, p = 0.003) and count (F = 3.203, p = 0.013). For SIT, CD3−CD56dimCD16+ count was lower at 2H compared to PRE (p = 0.047). Conclusion: Data suggest that both SIT and MCT, but not HIIT, elicited a decline in CD3+CD4+ count 24 hours following exercise. HIIT and MCT triggered a significant increase in CD3+CD8+ count at 6H that was not observed following SIT. CD3−CD19+ count was elevated at IP following HIIT, but not following SIT or MCT. CD3−CD56brightCD16− count was significantly greater immediately after HIIT compared to SIT and MCT. CD3−CD56dimCD16+ count declined 2 hours following SIT but not following HIIT or MCT. Practical Applications: The results of this study suggest that, despite identical duration, HIIT, SIT, and MCT elicit dissimilar immune responses. T helper cells (CD3+CD4+), which play an important role in immune function, appear to be suppressed following SIT and MCT, but not HIIT. Cytotoxic NK cells (CD3−CD56dimCD16+) were depleted 2 hours following SIT, but not following HIIT or MCT, indicating potential susceptibility to infection following SIT. Further research is needed to determine the practical effects of varying exercise intensities on immune function.\n\nThursday, July 11, 2019, 12:00 pm–1:30 pm\n\nDoes Sweat Collection Method Influence Assessment of Electrolyte Concentration?\n\nN. Shea, G. Kang, M. Jones, and M. Millard-Stafford\n\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\n\nSweat rate and electrolyte concentration can widely vary across individuals; thus, these measures may inform practitioners regarding nutritional requirements and acclimatization status of athletes. Purpose: To determine the impact of using different methods for sweat acquisition (by region and modality) on sweat electrolyte concentration. Methods: Thirteen physically-active males (age: 22.4 ± 3.5, height 178.0 ± 6.1 cm, body mass: 69.9 ± 6.6 kg) participated after a standardized dinner and an overnight fast. Sweat was acquired via Tegaderm absorbent patch on the left scapula (SCAP-Patch), left forearm (ARM-Patch), and Opsite dressing/parafilm pouch (Brisson method) on the right scapula (SCAP-Pouch) after ∼1 hour of exercise in the heat (38 °C, 30% RH). Sweat was obtained from the beginning of exercise until patches were visibly saturated and pouch contained sufficient sample volume. Sweat was analyzed for sodium [Na+] and potassium [K+] via LAQUAtwin Na-11 and LAQUAtwin K-11. Results: There was a significant effect for sweat acquisition method on Na+ (p = 0.002) and K+ (p < 0.001). CAP-Pouch had higher [Na+] by 16.9% compared to SCAP-Patch (83.1 ± 25.3 > 71.0 ± 18.2 mmol/L; p = 0.010); however, this regional measure was highly correlated (r = 0.861; p < 0.001) despite a different acquisition technique. A similar finding was observed for [K+]. SCAP-Pouch had higher [K+] by 18.4% compared to SCAP-Patch (4.5 ± 0.6 > 3.8 ± 0.7 mmol/L; p = 0.009) but was significantly correlated (r = 0.815; p = 0.001). Sodium differences across regions were not different for SCAP-Patch and ARM-Patch (71.0 ± 18.3 vs. 61.9 ± 21.6 mmol/L; p = 0.084), but were highly correlated (r = 0.795, p = 0.001). Regional differences were only observed for [K+]. Ard greater [K+] compared to SCAP-Patch 5.4 ± 1.2 > 3.8 ± 0.7 mmol/L; p = 0.002) but was significantly correlated (r = 0.734, p = 0.024). Conclusion: Sweat electrolyte concentration may differ both by region and the acquisition method used in sample collection. The use of absorbent patches resulted in consistently lower electrolyte values for both [Na+] and [K+] compared to a custom-made pouch in the same region (i.e., scapula). Practical Applications: Regional sweat collections within occlusive coverings may result in higher values compared to whole body sweat. However, despite potential differences by region and sample collection, the high correlation among methods indicates a benefit to correctly identify individuals who are at risk for excess sodium loss using these field techniques.\n\nThursday, July 11, 2019, 12:00 pm–1:30 pm\n\nAcute and Long-Term Affects of Mediation on Cortisol Levels in Kinesiology Students\n\nT. Dore' and G. Davis\n\nUniversity of Louisiana at Lafayette\n\nNumerous studies have concluded that regular mediation practice has had a significant effect on cortisol levels. Purpose: To investigate the potential effects of regular meditation on both acute and long-term stress and anxiety levels in University students. Methods: Twelve participants (5 men and 7 women) participated in the study. The subjects were randomly divided into 2 groups, a meditation group (group 1) and a non-meditation group (group 2). Ages of the participants ranged from 18 to 23 year old. All participants provided a pre- and post-cortisol saliva sample between the hours of 0600 and 0800 and completed GAD-7 survey to assess anxiety. On the initial day of testing, group 1 was required to participate in a 10-minute guided mediation session during the time between the cortisol sampling. Over the course of a 15-week semester, the participants in group 1 were required to participate in bi-weekly meditation sessions ranging from 10 to 25 minutes in duration while the participants in group 2 were required to meet bi-weekly for 10–25 minutes and sit quietly. During the week prior to final exams, both groups were again required to participate in the GAD—7 survey and provide an additional saliva sample. Cortisol was analyzed using a commercially available ELISA. Results are presented as mean ± SEM. Results: Cortisol levels for group 1 were 0.10 ± 0.03 µg/dl pre-intervention, 0.07 ± 0.02 µg/dl post-acute intervention, and 0.09 ± 0.03 µg/dl post-15 weeks intervention. Cortisol levels in group 2 were 0.27 ± 0.11 µg/dl, 0.06 ± 0.03 µg/dl post-acute intervention and 0.05 ± 0.02 µg/dl post-15-week intervention. A repeated measures ANOVA did not reveal a significant effect for treatment (F = 0.53; p = 0.49), time (F = 1.10; p = 0.38), or an interaction (F = 0.77; p = 0.50). GAD-7 scores for group 1 were 8.75 ± 1.38 pre-intervention and 7.4 ± 1.86 post-15-week intervention while GAD-7 scores for group 2 were 9.0 ± 2.50 pre-intervention and 6.17 ± 1.80 post-15-week intervention. A repeated measures ANOVA did not reveal a significant effect for treatment (F = 0.28; p = 0.62), time (F = 0.56; p = 0.48), or an interaction (F = 2.76; p = 0.15). Conclusion: Neither an acute bout of meditation nor a fifteen-week bi-weekly meditation intervention was effective in affecting anxiety or salivary cortisol levels in college aged-men and women, likely due to the low initial values of these parameters. Practical Applications: If men and women initially display low levels of stress or anxiety, acute or chronic meditation is unlikely to induce any significant physiological changes associated with decreases in stress or anxiety. Meditation may still provide psychological benefits in this population and physiological benefits may be realized among participants with higher initial stress or anxiety.\n\nThursday, July 11, 2019, 12:00 pm–1:30 pm\n\nThe Acute Cortisol Response to Resistance Exercise: the Importance of Training Status\n\nS. Sontag,1 J. Nicoll,2 A. Fry,1 and E. Mosier3\n\n1University of Kansas; 2California State University, Northridge; and 3Northwest Missouri State University\n\nPurpose: To examine the importance of training status on the acute cortisol response to a lower body high volume-moderate intensity resistance exercise (RE) bout in college aged men. Methods: Resistance trained (RT) men (n = 10; ±SD, age = 21.3 ± 1.7 years, height = 175.8 ± 6.8 cm, body mass = 84.5 ± 13.5 kg, squat 1RM = 154.3 ± 19.3 kg, training history = 5.4 ± 2.0 years) and untrained men (UT) (n = 9; ±SD, age = 20.8 ± 3.1 years, height = 178.7 ± 8.9 cm, body mass = 81.0 ± 14.0 kg, squat 1RM = 108.1 ± 13.7 kg, training history = 0.7 ± 1.7 years) volunteered for this study. Some untrained subjects had prior RE experience but were classified as untrained due to a lack of current training. Prior to the RE bout, subjects came in for a 1RM strength test for the barbell back squat and leg extension according to NSCA guidelines (Baechle and Earle 2008). Subjects returned 4–7 days later euhydrated and at least 6 hours fasted, between 10am and 2pm, and completed a RE bout consisting of 6 sets of 10 repetitions of barbell back squats at 75% 1RM with 1.5 minutes rest between sets, immediately followed by 4 sets of 10 repetitions of leg extensions at 75% 1RM with 1.5 minutes rest between sets. Blood samples were collected via venipuncture from an antecubital vein before the RE bout (PRE) and 5 minutes (5+), 15 minutes (15+), and 45 minutes (45+) post exercise. Circulating serum concentrations of cortisol were analyzed via ELISA. Statistical analyses were completed using 2-way repeated measures ANOVAs. Results: In the RT group, there were significant increases (p < 0.05) from PRE to 5+ and PRE to 15+ post RE bout (See Table 1). In the UT group, there were significant increases (p < 0.05) at 5+, 15+, and 45+ post RE bout (See Table 1). Conclusion: While both RT and UT groups had significant increases in serum cortisol levels following a lower body RE bout, the UT group stayed elevated longer. Practical Applications: Resistance trained and untrained individuals have similar initial responses in cortisol to RE; however, RT individuals are able to return to baseline quicker, indicating a faster recovery. For strength and conditioning professionals, it is important to understand there are differences in the physiological responses of individuals with different training statuses, thus affecting how they adapt and recover.\n\nThursday, July 11, 2019, 12:00 pm–1:30 pm\n\nComparison of Baseline Salivary Testosterone and Cortisol Between National Competitors and Non-qualifiers in Women's Collegiate Track and Field\n\nL. Biscardi, M. Jones, and M. Andre\n\nGeorge Mason University\n\nTestosterone and cortisol are both considered to be valid biomarkers in athletes, and are sometimes monitored to help to assess recovery in athletes (Fry & Kraemer, 1997). Further, scientists have wondered if resting concentrations of these hormones can help to predict talent and/or influence acute performance in athletes (Cardinale & Stone, 2006).
