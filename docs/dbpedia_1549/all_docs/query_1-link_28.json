        "text": "Welcome!\n\nThe International Auschwitz Committee is an association of Auschwitz survivors and their organizations. The International Auschwitz Committee unites organizations, foundations and Holocaust survivors from 19 countries. The office of the IAC is located in Berlin. The current president of the IAC is Auschwitz survivor Marian Turski, Warsaw.\n\n16.6.2023: Presentation of the model of the sculpture \"A Bench for Justin Sonder\" at the German Resistance Memorial Center in Berlin by Christoph Heubner, Executive Vice President International Auschwitz Committee, and Rostock sculptor Julia Kausch. Photo: Eva Oertwig /SCHROEWIG/IAK\n\n23.6.2023\n\nDonation appeal for IAC project: A bench for Justin Sonder\n\nThe survivors of the Holocaust are also asking themselves about the level of awareness that their educational and remembrance efforts have actually produced over the past decades. In this respect the Chemnitz Auschwitz survivor, Justin Sonder, spoke on behalf of them all in one of his last accounts of his memories, which he delivered in 2020 under the title ‘What have I achieved?’\n\nA major response to Justin Sonder’s question can be seen in the many initiatives by Holocaust survivors to utilize public space as remembrance space, and not to abandon it to the rantings and hate speech of right-wing extremism.\n\nThis too is reason enough for the International Auschwitz Committee remember Justin Sonder in Chemnitz. He was born there into a Jewish family in 1925 and, after his liberation from Auschwitz and other camps, was one of the few German Jews to return directly to his home town: he didn’t want to relinquish Chemnitz to the Nazis and their legacy. And this needs to apply equally after Justin Sonder’s death in 2021. Especially in Chemnitz, the European Capital of Culture 2025, which is a recurring focal point of xenophobic, anti-Semitic and extreme far-right incidents.\n\nIt is to this city that we are donating a bench, on which Justin Sonder is sitting with his inquiring and caring gaze directed towards the former Jewish junior school and the people who want to sit down next to him and learn something about his life story and the causes of his persecution. The bench and the bronze figure are being financed with donations from many well-wishing private individuals and institutions. The project was first announced together with the city of Chemnitz and Justin Sonder’s daughter in January 2023.\n\nThe cost of the sculpture is 70,000 euros. 20,000 euros has already been collected by the International Auschwitz Committee.\n\nWe kindly ask you to donate for this important project with a political signal effect.\n\nDonations can be made to the following account:\n\nInternational Auschwitz Committee\n\nPostbank Berlin\n\nBIC: PBNKDEFF\n\nIBAN: DE29 1001 0010 0575 6861 06\n\nPurpose of payment: Justin Sonder\n\nRead more ...\n\nCommemorative action of the International Auschwitz Committee (IAK).

At the time, the murder of the Kassel government president appeared to be the culmination of a hate campaign that had been deliberately stirred up and staged by right-wing extremists, neo-Nazis and representatives of the AfD in view of our country's willingness to help refugees.\n\nRead more ...\n\nSerge and Beate Klarsfeld at the premiere of the film Klarsfeld: A love Story, at the 30th Filmfest Hamburg 2022 in the city’s Cinemaxx Dammtor.
