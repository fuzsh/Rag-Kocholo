        "text": "July 2, 2024\n\nTo see the updates Live 12.1 brings to Push, head to our Push beta release notes page.\n\nNew Features\n\nAutomation and Modulation Keyboard Workflow\n\nLive now supports a new keyboard workflow for working with automation and modulation in the Arrangement timeline and in the Clip Content Editor's Envelopes view mode. In addition, screen reader users get spoken feedback while working with automation in the Arrangement timeline. The following functions are supported:\n\nCreating an automation breakpoint — when the insert marker is on an automation lane, press Enter to create and select a breakpoint.\n\nSelecting an automation breakpoint — when the insert marker intersects with an automation breakpoint, press Enter to select it. You can also press Ctrl (Windows) / Option (Mac) and click on a breakpoint to select it with the mouse.\n\nEditing an automation breakpoint — when a breakpoint is selected:\n\nUse the up/down arrow keys to change the breakpoint's value.\n\nUse the left/right arrow keys to change the breakpoint's time (modifiers for moving in time apply here as well).\n\nStart typing a new value and press Enter to commit the change and unselect the breakpoint.\n\nDeselecting an automation breakpoint — when a breakpoint is selected, press Enter to deselect the breakpoint and commit any changes that were made to it or press Esc to deselect the breakpoint and cancel any changes that were made.\n\nNavigating between automation breakpoints — the behavior depends on whether a breakpoint is selected or not:\n\nWith a breakpoint selected, select the next/previous breakpoint with Tab and Shift + Tab\n\nWith no breakpoint selected, move the insert marker to the next/previous breakpoint by using Ctrl (Windows) / Option (Mac) with right/left arrow keys\n\nDeleting an automation breakpoint — when the insert marker intersects with a breakpoint, or when a breakpoint is selected, press Delete or Backspace to delete it\n\nAuto Shift\n\nAuto Shift is a new realtime monophonic pitch tracking and correction device with formant shifting, available in all Live editions. Its design makes it especially suitable for working with vocals but it can be used with any other monophonic signals. It is also possible to play and harmonise the incoming signal polyphonically via the MIDI sidechain.\n\nAuto Shift includes two modulation sources: a dedicated vibrato LFO or a multi-purpose LFO that allows to modulate all important features of the device. When in MIDI mode, the device is capable of MPE modulation as well.\n\nThe device supports both built-in scales and user-defined scales.\n\nDrum Sampler\n\nDrum Sampler is a new instrument tailored to playing back one-shot samples in the context of Drum Racks. It includes essential sample playing features such as sample start and length controls, an AHD amplitude envelope, Transpose and Detune controls and a filter section with playback effects which allow to time stretch and loop samples, apply frequency and ring modulation, layer a sub-oscillator or noise, add punch or degrade the sound.\n\nDrum Sampler's compact filter section allows to use four filters optimized for playing back drum hits: 12 or 24 dB low-pass filter, 12 dB high-pass, or a simple single-band half-parametric EQ to emphasise or notch out a portion of the spectrum.\n\nVelocity in Drum Sampler can be used to modulate volume as well as an additional parameter that you can select, such as one of the envelope controls, filter or a playback effect.\n\nDrum Sampler can also be used as the new default for Drum Racks: to do so, simply right-click on a Drum Pad containing Drum Sampler and select \"Save as Default Pad\" from the context menu. Note that when a Drum Pad is selected, you can now simply double click a sample in the browser to load it inside the current pad: if the pad is empty, the default for Drum Racks will be used - otherwise the currently selected device (if different from the default) will be used instead.\n\nDrum Sampler is available in all Live editions.\n\nThe Limiter effect has been completely overhauled both in sound and appearance. An improved envelope makes Limiter's release smoother, which is especially noticeable when longer release times are used. A completely new UI provides better level and gain reduction metering and a more pleasant look.\n\nA Mid/Side routing mode was added, which allows to use the first channel to limit the monophonic portion of a signal, and the second channel to limit the stereo (side) portion. For both Mid/Side mode as well as the Left/Right routing, Gain Reduction Link now works as a continuous parameter, so that users can blend the effect of gain reduction across the two channels with more freedom.\n\nBesides the Standard mode of operation, Limiter now includes Soft Clip and True Peak modes. Soft Clip introduces gentle clipping to signals approaching the ceiling level, whereas True Peak prevents peaks between samples. The new Maximize toggle allows to control dynamic range and loudness with a single control, Threshold.\n\nSaturator has been fundamentally redesigned, so that the main view is focused around the most important parameters. A real time visualisation displays signal level over the curve.\n\nA new Bass Enhancer shaper curve was added, perfect for processing low-end signals such as 808 kick drums and synth basslines. The curve comes with a dedicated Threshold parameter, which allows to seamlessly morph between soft and hard clipping. Only signals above the set threshold will be saturated.\n\nAn additional clipping mode for the second stage was added: alongside Soft, users can now opt for a Hard Clipping stage.\n\nIn the expanded view, the pre-shaper EQ curve is displayed alongside input and output spectra, for superior control over the Color parameters.\n\nFilter and Select MIDI Notes\n\nThe new Find and Select Notes option introduces additional workflows for selecting notes in the MIDI Note Editor, including searching for specific notes using different filters.\n\nFind and Select Notes can be activated by pressing the magnifying glass button located in the Clip Content Editor Settings. When the option is active, you can use the following filters to look for and select notes:\n\nPitch and Time, with possibilities to select pitch classes in any octave, and adjust time selections.\n\nNote Velocity, Chance, and Duration\n\nCondition, such as looking for notes that are active/inactive, or other states\n\nCount, where it is possible to find and select every nth note or chord\n\nScale\n\nWhen Find and Select Notes is on, the new concept of repeated time selection can be used to make evenly spaced selections. To created repeated time selections, first make a selection that will be used as the basis for the size of the repeated selections, then press Shift and click and drag in the MIDI Note Editor.\n\nFind and Select also makes it possible to select notes within multiple specific pitches, by holding Shift and clicking on different keys in the piano ruler.\n\nThe new ways of selecting notes can be used in combination for more advanced note selection states.\n\nChopping MIDI Notes\n\nChopping MIDI notes is now easier, more powerful and fun thanks to a new dedicated MIDI Transformation. It is also still possible to chop notes through the Chop note operation in the MIDI Note Editor, which now features improved workflow.\n\nChop MIDI Tool\n\nA new Chop MIDI Tool is available in the Transform tab/panel. The tool allows chopping selected notes into up to 64 parts, selecting or designing patterns for note chunks and gaps, extending selected chunks relatively to others, and adding random variations.\n\nChop Note Operation\n\nMouse workflow was improved for the Chop note operation, making the mouse and keyboard interactions more similar.\n\nWhen chopping notes into more or fewer parts with the mouse, the order in which the keys are pressed in the shortcut combination was reversed to provide a more natural workflow. The Option key used in the combination on macOS was updated to Cmd, which is more consistent with the other workflows. Changing the number of parts into which notes are chopped with a mouse is now achieved with the following workflow:\n\nPress Ctrl + E (Windows) / Cmd + E (Mac) (this chops notes on the grid)\n\nKeep holding Ctrl (Windows) / Cmd (Mac)\n\nClick and drag up or down to increase or decrease the number of parts.\n\nIt is still possible to add the Shift modifier key to increase/decrease the number of parts by a power of two.\n\nNew MPE MIDI Tools can be used to create curves for MPE parameters of selected notes, with changes visible in the Clip Content Editor's MPE View Mode. Two MPE MIDI Transformation Tools are now available: Glissando and LFO.\n\nGlissando\n\nThe Glissando MIDI Tool ties successive notes or groups of simultaneous notes, making the pitch bend envelope of each note connect to the pitch of the successive one. Controls in the Transformation allow to adjust the shape and starting point of the envelope. At least two notes must be selected in order to use Glissando.\n\nLFO\n\nThe LFO MIDI Tool sets an oscillating envelope for one of the MPE parameters of selected notes: Pitch Bend, Pressure or Slide. It is possible to select a shape, rate and set a global amplitude envelope for the oscillator.\n\nMax for Live: Export Looper's Content to a Clip\n\nThe LooperDevice LOM class now offers a new export_to_clip_slot function. Calling the function with a valid LOM ID of an empty clip slot as an argument on a non-frozen audio track will export Looper's content to a clip in that slot.\n\nScale Awareness for Audio Clips\n\nIt is now possible to associate a scale with an audio clip using dedicated controls in Clip View's Main Clip Properties tab/panel. Setting a scale in an audio clip doesn’t affect the audio playback itself (similar to how the clip time signature setting doesn’t affect playback) but it is forwarded to scale aware devices on the device chain.\n\nAs a result of this change, Auto Shift becomes the first scale aware audio effect.\n\nApply Grooves Instantly\n\nA groove is now loaded with the default Live Set and automatically applied to any new MIDI clip. By default, the Global Groove Amount is set to 0%, so all you need to do to apply the groove is adjust this value.\n\nIn the Groove Pool, there is a new Auto Load Groove toggle, on by default, that controls whether a groove is auto-loaded on new MIDI clips. You can switch the toggle off and no grooves will be auto-loaded. A dedicated Hot-Swap button allows you to select which groove you would like to be auto-loaded.\n\nThe state of Auto Load Groove control and the Global Groove Amount are saved with your Sets, templates, and the default Set, so you can customize the defaults however you prefer.\n\nUndo History\n\nIt is now possible to use the new Undo History feature in order to display a list of the available undo and redo steps, with the possibility to undo and redo multiple steps at once by clicking on an entry in the list.\n\nThe \"Undo History\" option is available in the View menu.\n\nFull-Height Browser\n\nIt is now possible to switch from the standard-height browser to a full-height view of the browser, stretching all the way down to the Status Bar.\n\nThe \"Full-Height Browser\" option is available in the drop-down menu next to the Show/Hide Browser toggle, as well as in the View menu.\n\nAuto Tagging User Content\n\nAs a part of sound analysis, Live will now assign a new tag type to user samples with a tag that best matches the sound that Live anticipates the sample belongs to. This applies to samples no longer than 60 seconds.\n\nAuto tags can be shown and hidden in the browser using a new Include Auto Tags toggle, and can be removed or changed to user tags in the Tags Editor.\n\nAuto Tagging Plugins\n\nVST3 plugins will now be assigned a tag based on VST3 meta data if the plugin uses a VST Sub Category that maps to one of Live's categories.\n\nFeature Improvements\n\nAccessibility Improvements\n\nAccessibility: Filters and Tags Editor now work meaningfully with screen readers and can be navigated and selected using the keyboard.\n\nAccessibility: Users can now navigate through Live UI Objects in Max for Live devices by pressing the Tab key. Live UI Objects also offer basic screen reader support.\n\nAccessibility: Pressing Ctrl (Windows) / Cmd (Mac) together with plus or minus keys now zooms the UI.\n\nBrowser Improvements\n\nFilters and Tags Editor Improvements\n\nReordering tags and tag groups: It is now possible to reorder tag groups and tags in the Tags Editor, creating a custom order. You can restore the default order by right-clicking on a tag group in the Tags Editor and selecting the \"Reset Tag Order\" option. Filter groups in the Filters view will follow the custom order set in the Tags editor. Note that only the groups available in the Tags Editor can be reordered.\n\nTagging user folders: It is now possible to tag folders in the Library and Places. When a folder is tagged, all the content contained within it is also tagged.\n\nCreating nested tags: You can now create nested tags (up to one nesting level). Right-click on a tag and select the \"Add Tag in...\" option to easily create a nested tag within another tag.\n\nFolding nested tags: Tags containing nested tags can now be folded in the Tags Editor to save space. When tagged content is selected in the browser, and its tag groups as well as parent tags (in the case of nested tags) are folded, the fold/unfold arrow for tags and tag groups assigned to the content are now indicated by a more prominent, white-on-black arrow in the Tags Editor.\n\nSidebar Improvements\n\nYou can now restore Library labels order to default by right-clicking on the Library section's header and selecting the \"Reset order to default\" option.\n\nCore Library Updates\n\nA selection of Drum Racks now uses the Drum Sampler device.\n\nModulator presets now use Mod instead of Remote.\n\nNew presets were added for Saturator and Limiter taking advantage of the new features available in the devices.\n\nNew Slice-To-MIDI presets were added.\n\nCC Control\n\nThe CC Control effect now offers a convenient MIDI CC learn mode. When the Learn toggle is on, the device can receive CC data via regular track or device input. The user can then select one of the customizable controls to learn the specific CC data being sent.\n\nEcho\n\nThe Echo effect now allows to freely adjust smoothing time for the Repitch parameter. This allows to adjust how slow or fast a new delay time is applied.\n\nMeld\n\nNew Phase Reset and Phase Spread parameters are available in Meld's Settings tab. They allow to restart the oscillator phases with a MIDI note and to spread the start position of the oscillator phases, respectively.\n\nSidechain in Envelope Follower\n\nThe Envelope Follower modulator device now includes a sidechain routing, which allows to route another signal source from other tracks and mix it with the source of the track the device is added to. This feature can be useful in achieving a ducking effect.\n\nTuner\n\nThe Tuner device now supports tuning systems.\n\nMIDI Editing Improvements\n\nRelease Velocity now has a dedicated lane below the MIDI Note Editor.\n\nWhen editing multiple clips, the foreground clip is now indicated with an LED which uses the clip color.\n\nStacks MIDI Tool\n\nCustom Chords: It is now possible to load user-defined chord banks or \"chord rules\" in the Stacks generator. Chord banks are text files in the JSON format. To load a Stacks chord bank, double-click a chord bank JSON file located in the browser.\n\nExtended Support: Stacks is now better at handling less common use cases such as Drum Rack tracks, non-12TET tuning systems, or negative inversions.\n\nRecombine MIDI Tool\n\nThe tool now affects only one note parameter at a time.\n\nIn addition to the previous parameters (pitch, velocity, and duration) it is now also possible to use Recombine on note positions, which can be rotated according to the current grid settings.\n\nIt is possible to rotate notes by single steps using the dedicated Rotate Step Down/Up buttons.\n\nKey/MIDI Mapping: The parameters in MIDI Tools are now Key/MIDI mappable. Note that this does not apply to Max for Live MIDI Tools.\n\nUpdated \"Apply\" buttons: The design of the Auto Apply toggle in MIDI Tools has been changed to display \"Auto\" instead of the former \"Transform\" or \"Generate\" (used in Transformations and Generators respectively). The design of the Apply toggle has been changed from the former circular arrow button to a rounded button that displays the word \"Transform\" or \"Generate\" (depending on the type of the MIDI Tool used)\n\nApply MIDI Tools in a chain: You can now chain MIDI Tools together so that you can keep editing their parameters and see the changes reflected throughout the entire chain. The chain is created when a Generator or Transformation is applied to the clip content, and other Transformations are added afterwards. It is possible to return to any MIDI Tool in the chain and adjust its parameters, affecting the rest of the chain. The exact MIDI Tools included in the chain are listed in the Status Bar.\n\nApply Transformations to duplicated content: When you apply a MIDI Transformation Tool and then duplicate the transformed notes, it is now possible to tweak the parameters of the MIDI Tool and the changes are immediately applied to the duplicated content.\n\nRemember MIDI Tool on a track: Tracks now retain information about the last-selected Transformation and Generator.\n\nSet Pitch for Generators: It is now possible to set a pitch or pitch range for MIDI Generative Tools by clicking on a key or clicking and dragging over the keys of the piano ruler. It is also possible to select the pitch or pitch range directly in the MIDI Note Editor by holding Alt (Windows) / Option (Mac) while clicking or clicking and dragging inside the Editor.\n\nSelect notes to apply: When no notes are selected, Transformations will no longer be started automatically when their parameters are tweaked.\n\nTuning Systems Improvements\n\nTuning systems with 12 notes per octave will now work with Live's collection of built-in scales.\n\nTuning System properties are now accessible to and adjustable using the Max for Live API. A loaded tuning system is accessible at the LOM path live_set tuning_system. The Global.TuningSystem Max for Live snippet in the Max editor can help with converting tuning system data to mtof messages.\n\nOther Improvements\n\nIt is now possible to split Arrangement clips (both audio and MIDI) from the Clip View, using the dedicated Split Clip command in the Sample Editor or MIDI Note Editor or the following keyboard shortcut: Ctrl + Shift + E (Windows) / Cmd + Shift + E (Mac).\n\nImproved Crop commands in the Arrangement View so that clips are cropped according to the actual time selection made in the Arrangement.\n\nThe Mixer in Arrangement can now be focused separately from the Arrangement View a has its own dedicated focus frame.\n\nThe Overview is now included in the focus frame when the Session or Arrangement is focused.\n\nTime selection, split and crop clip operations are now available in unwarped audio clips.\n\nIt is now possible to edit pitch bend in tracks containing Drum Racks using a dedicated lane in the MPE Editor.\n\nBugfixes:\n\nOn macOS, fixed a bug where exporting video when there was no video clip at the start of the exported time range caused the exported video to be zoomed in a lot, showing only a small portion of the original video.\n\nAccessibility: Fixed that relationships between items in the browser were not spoken properly by screen readers on Windows.\n\nFixed an issue that caused an error message to appear in the Status Bar when duplicating a mapped modulator.\n\nScroll bars visible when entering long custom text using the Edit Info Text option now use Live 12 UI styling.\n\nAccessibility: The accessible names of send sliders in the Arrangement mixer now correctly include the name of the corresponding return track.\n\nThe Triplets control in the Quantize Audio/MIDI Tool now correctly updates depending on the chosen Quantize Grid option.\n\nThe Stacks MIDI Tool no longer displays a preview of the selected chord when the Generator is disabled (e.g. in the Envelopes Editor View Mode) or when a Drum Rack is loaded/unloaded.\n\nFixed an issue which prevented toggles in Live's UI to automatically open their corresponding views when dragging and hovering content over the toggles. This bug affected the Show/Hide Browser, Mixer View, Clip View and Device View toggles.\n\nFixed an issue where focus was placed in an incorrect part of the UI when opening the Clip View's Grid Settings menu.\n\nFixed a bug in the Envelopes Editor View Mode where resizing an automation envelope time selection while zoomed in would resize the selected part of the envelope to fill the entire view rather than only the small distance dragged.\n\nIn MIDI Tools, resetting a pitch control will set the control to a valid pitch value according to the currently selected clip scale and/or the instrument added on the track.\n\nFixed a bug that would cause a Max for Live MIDI Tool saved to a location unknown to the browser to become deselected as soon as the Transformation/Generator Selector drop-down menu was opened.\n\nMPE Control now properly restores the Pitch Range parameter after reloading a Set.\n\nFixed the following issues:\n\nA strip representing scene color no longer appears under the scroll bar in Session View.\n\nNavigating to scene tempo and time signature with arrow keys is now possible regardless of whether the scene is visible or not.\n\nThe Scene Tempo And Time Signature entry in the scene context menu and View menu will now show correct state, even if the first scene is scrolled out of view.\n\nFixed a bug that would sometimes prevent the Transformation/Generator Selector from updating correctly when a new Max for Live MIDI Tool was saved.\n\nFixed a crash that could potentially occur when closing a Live Set with a Max for Live device observing the mute property on a chain mixer.\n\nFixed a crash that occurred when transferring certain types of files (e.g. presets) to Push in Standalone Mode.\n\nFixed a crash that occurred when dragging and dropping samples into a Drum Rack.\n\nFixed an issue where notes and their velocity values would disappear in MIDI clips longer than 10000 beats.\n\nAccessibility: Fixed a bug that caused the accessible representation of scenes to be inconsistent when the \"View>Scene Tempo and Time Signature\" option was active.\n\nFixed the following issues with crash recovery:\n\nCrash recovery is now enabled for multiple instances of Live when those instances use different versions of Live.\n\nA message will now be displayed when crash recovery is disabled in cases where another instance of Live using the same version is running.\n\nDS Snare no longer occasionally mutes notes early.\n\nWhen transforming notes with MIDI Tools or the options in Pitch and Time Utilities tab/panel, per-note expression will be transformed as well.\n\nHorizontal sliders now support fine control using the Shift key.\n\nHorizontal slider sensitivity now works as expected in the chain selector.\n\nImproved the appearance of Shaper's and Shaper MIDI's waveforms at zoom levels other than 100%.\n\nFixed a bug where the Connect button was not visible for Pushes available for pairing.\n\nWhen using the Expression Editor on notes already transformed using MIDI Tools or the Pitch and Time Utilities tab/panel options, per-note expression will be the same as for the transformed note rather than the original note.\n\nFixed a crash that occurred after clicking on inactive MIDI Dump buttons in the Link, Tempo & MIDI Settings.\n\nFixed an issue where note probability, velocity deviation and per-note events were not copied to the extracted clip when using the Extract Chain command.\n\nFreezing tracks that contain clips without names will no longer result in creating clips with a name that starts with a space character.\n\nThe \"Save Default Clip\" button in an audio clip's title bar is now reachable through keyboard navigation.\n\nFixed a crash that occurred when using Tab navigation while working with clip automation and clip modulation.\n\nAccessibility: Fixed a bug that caused keyboard focus to get stuck in the Arrangement timeline.\n\nFixed a bug that caused the Session View layout to be broken when making return tracks visible.\n\nFixed an issue where the track and scene highlight could not be moved with the arrow keys on an hidden return track in the Session View.\n\nFixed an issue where Packs folders in the Packs label in the browser would not show assigned colours after switching labels.\n\nAccessibility: Fixed a bug that could cause the MIDI Note Editor to have an incorrect accessible name.\n\nFixed a crash that occurred when dragging the last label in the Library section of the browser onto itself.\n\nOn Windows, the right Alt key now functions the same as the left Alt key for all keyboard layouts that do not implement the AltGr mechanism, such as US English.\n\nOn macOS, fixed a regression in the display of the outer frame of drop-down menus.\n\nWhen opening a Live 11 Set which had the tempo and/or time signature fields visible, and any of the values of those fields were changed, the visibility of those fields will now be preserved if the Set is open in Live 12.\n\nAccessibility: Fixed a bug in screen reader navigation between the scene control, tempo field, and time signature field in scenes.\n\nIt is now possible to associate a scale with tracks containing Drum Racks. The scale is used in the devices which have the Use Current Scale toggle switched on.\n\nFixed a bug where devices would not be initialised with a correct scale when no clip was playing on a track.\n\nFixed a crash that occurred when loading an old Live Set containing VST2.\n\nOn macOS, fixed an issue where the striped clip panel header of multiple-clip selection was rendered incorrectly.\n\nFixed a crash that could potentially occur when closing Live.\n\nSearch terms will now be cleared after entering the Hot-Swap mode. It is possibly to restore the search after exiting Hot-Swap, then going back in the browser's history.\n\nFixed a bug where a recording in progress could be unexpectedly stopped (and the track disarmed) when selecting a different track in Live with Push connected.\n\nSets with routings to external MIDI devices will retain those routings as expected when they are saved in Live on a computer and opened on Push 3 in Standalone Mode, or vice versa. Note that Sets saved after the introduction of this fix will lose their routings when loaded in an older version of Live.\n\nSelecting time with the mouse in the MIDI Editor Stretch Area now behaves consistently with making time selections in the MIDI Note Editor.\n\nFixed an issue where expanding one device would incorrectly close expanded views in other devices.\n\nFixed a crash that occurred after pressing the Enter key or clicking away from the edit field while editing automation values in the Clip View.\n\nAccessibility: The \"Save Default Clip\" button in the audio clip title bar is now reachable with keyboard navigation.\n\nFixed an issue where automation breakpoints located within or outside the clip and intersecting with the insert marker would not be deleted after pressing the Delete key.\n\nFor multiple deleted breakpoints, the Undo text in the Edit menu was updated from \"Delete Envelope\" to a more accurate \"Delete Breakpoints\".\n\nFixed a bug that prevented the Ctrl + Enter (Windows) / Cmd + Enter (Mac) shortcut in a MIDI Tool panel from applying the Transformation/Generation if a Max for Live MIDI Tool was selected.\n\nResolving paths to the following elements via live.path will no longer result in an error:\n\nGroovePool.grooves\n\nMaxDevice.audio_outputs\n\nMaxDevice.audio_inputs\n\nMaxDevice.midi_outputs\n\nMaxDevice.midi_inputs\n\nTrack.arrangement_clips\n\nIt is now possible again to repeatedly trigger Undo step by pressing and holding Ctrl + Enter (Windows) / Cmd + Enter (Mac).\n\nUpdated the Core Library:\n\nAdded new tuning systems.\n\nAdded new slice-to-MIDI presets.\n\nAdded new Saturator presets.\n\nAdded new Limiter presets.\n\nEQ Eight default preset: no Adaptive Q for shelf filters.\n\nFixed the timing of Swing 8ths/16ths/32nds groove presets.\n\nFixed an issue where pads would not turn green and the MIDI Track Out indicator would not flash in MIDI control surfaces such as Push 1 (or Push 2 with the legacy script option) when notes were played back in Live on the control surface's selected track.\n\nFixed a bug where the \"Clear Envelope\" option would be erroneously displayed in the context menu of Clip View's buttons in some circumstances.\n\nThe notification shown on Push 2 when moving scenes now correctly mentions encoders instead of the jog wheel.\n\nFixed a bug where EQ Eight would turn silent when moved across tracks.\n\nNew Features\n\nAccessibility\n\nImproved accessibility support on macOS and Windows; this includes many updates such as new themes with high-contrast variants, improved organization of Live's Preferences menu, as well as support for screen reader software and other assistive devices. While any screen reader software should work, we recommend VoiceOver (Mac) and NVDA (Win) for the best experience.\n\nIn Live’s Options menu, there is a new Accessibility entry which contains commands corresponding to different accessibility preferences, such as \"Speak Menu Commands\" and \"Speak Minimum and Maximum Slider Values\".\n\nAs part of the accessibility implementation, many improvements for keyboard navigation and keyboard workflows have also been added. You can find out more about these updates in the related subsections of the release notes.\n\nThe browser now includes a set of filters which can be used to search and find specific content using descriptive tags.\n\nRelevant filters are displayed based on which category of the browser is selected. To search with all available filters, use the All label in the browser’s Library. Filter Groups can be hidden/shown by right-clicking the Filters header in the browser, or by right-clicking on individual Filter Group names.\n\nYou can search for content and tags in the following ways:\n\nSelect filters and tags in a browser category. Use [CTRL] (Win) / [CMD] (Mac) to multiselect tags within the same Tag Group.\n\nUse the browser's search bar (corresponding filter results will also be displayed).\n\nSearch for specific tags in the search bar using the format: #[tag]. For example, if you are looking for samples tagged as \"punchy\" type \"#punchy.\" Autocomplete suggestions for tags will be shown as you type.\n\nWhen viewing populated filter results, you can save the current search using the Add Label button to the right of the Results header in the browser content pane. Once saved, a custom label is created in the browser's sidebar that contains the filter results. As new items are tagged, the content will also be updated in any relevant saved custom labels.\n\nYou can use the toggle to the right of the filters to show/hide the Tags Editor. A collection of default tags is included for all of Live’s built-in content.\n\nThe Tags Editor lists all tags in each filter and you can create new user tags for any filter by clicking Add Tag... at the bottom of the Tags Editor.\n\nNew Tag Groups can be created by clicking Add Group... in the Tags Editor. User created tags or tag groups can be deleted or renamed via their [right-click](Win) / [CTRL-click](Mac) context menus.\n\nTags can be assigned to/removed from the selected item in the browser content pane by clicking the checkboxes next to the tag names in the Tags Editor.\n\nNote that tags have replaced folder groups within the browser’s category labels.\n\nCC Control\n\nCC Control is a new utility device that can be used to send MIDI CC messages to hardware devices, or used in automation lanes on MIDI clips to send out MIDI CC data during a performance.\n\nThere are default controls for mod wheel, pitch bend, and pressure data, as well as several additional custom controls that can be configured for individual MIDI messages. The custom controls also appear on Push for easy navigation.\n\nThe Custom A button control can be used to send Sustain messages by default, or if set to another CC message, can toggle between sending minimum/maximum values to a MIDI device.\n\nIf CC automation already exists for the same CC message chosen in the device, the data will be merged.\n\nKeyboard Navigation\n\nMost of Live’s menus, views and controls can now be navigated using the computer keyboard.\n\nA new Navigate menu has been added to Live's menu bar which contains commands for moving keyboard focus to different areas of the UI, as well as the option to toggle the Use Tab to Move Focus functionality on or off.\n\nWhen on, the Tab key can be used to switch between different controls in a selected view. The following shortcuts related to this behavior are:\n\n[Tab] moves to the next control.\n\n[Shift][Tab] moves to the previous control.\n\n[CTRL][Tab] (Windows) / [ALT][Tab] (Mac) moves to the next control in the same row.\n\n[CTRL][Shift][Tab] (Windows) / [ALT][Shift][Tab] (Mac) moves to the previous control in the same row.\n\nWhen Use Tab to Move Focus is off, pressing the [Tab] key will switch between Session and Arrangement View, as in previous Live versions.\n\nThe Use Tab to Move Focus option can also be enabled in Live's Display & Input Preferences, which also include the additional Navigation and Keyboard options:\n\nWrap Tab Navigation - When this option is enabled, navigating with Tab will not stop at the last control in a focused view, but will navigate back to the first control. If the first control is selected, using [Shift][Tab] will navigate to the last control.\n\nMove Clips with Arrow Keys - This option is enabled by default, and lets you use the left and right arrow keys to move the time selection in Arrangement View.\n\nYou can navigate to different areas of Live’s interface using the following shortcuts:\n\n[ALT][0] - focus the Control Bar\n\n[ALT][1] - focus Session View\n\n[ALT][2] - focus Arrangement View\n\n[ALT][3] - focus Clip View\n\n[ALT][4] - focus Device View\n\n[ALT][5] - focus the browser\n\n[ALT][6] - focus Groove Pool\n\n[ALT][7] - focus Help View\n\nImproved keyboard navigation in Live’s Preferences:\n\n[Tab] and [Shift][Tab] keys can be used to navigate between options inside the Preferences tabs. These shortcuts work regardless of whether the Use Tab to Move Focus option is active or not.\n\nWhen focusing on the options inside Preferences tabs, up and down arrow keys can be used to change the state of a toggle, make adjustments, or cycle through the available options for a given preference.\n\nFor options that utilize toggle buttons, it is possible to toggle between states or trigger an action by using the [Enter] key.\n\nIt is possible to navigate the Preference Page Chooser using [ALT][Tab] and [Shift][ALT][Tab] or the up and down arrow keys when the chooser is focused. If the keyboard focus is inside any given Preferences tab, use the [Shift][Tab] shortcut once or more to return the focus to the Preference Page Chooser.\n\nAdditional keyboard navigation improvements:\n\nIt is now possible to use keyboard shortcuts to navigate to identical controls across tracks in the Arrangement View. Enabling the Navigate menu's Use Tab Key to Move Focus command and using the shortcuts [ALT][Tab] and [Shift][ALT][Tab] will jump from the currently selected control to the same control in the next or previous track.\n\nIn Session View, the [PgUp] and [PgDwn] keys now move up or down by eight scenes at a time, instead of jumping to the first or last scenes.\n\nWhen focused on a track's Session slot, Arrangement lane, or mixer controls, pressing [Esc] will jump to that track's header.\n\nOn Windows, the [ALT] key now behaves as it does in other applications. Pressing [ALT] without a corresponding shortcut key will focus the Global menu, which can then be navigated using the arrow keys or alphanumeric keys as expected.\n\nThe behavior of radio button keyboard navigation is now consistent with other applications on macOS and Windows:\n\nWhen navigating to a radio button group using [Tab] or [Shift][Tab], the selected radio button will be focused, instead of the first or last one in the group.\n\nWhen using Previous/Next Neighbor navigation with [CTRL][Tab] or [CTRL][Shift][Tab] to focus a radio button, the selected radio button will be focused, instead of the first or last one in the group.\n\nAdded a Mixer entry to the Navigate menu, which brings focus to the mixer in Arrangement View. The corresponding keyboard shortcut is [Shift][ALT][M].\n\nKeyboard Workflow\n\nVarious keyboard shortcuts have been added and updated to make it easier to work and navigate in Live directly from a computer keyboard.\n\nShortcuts that contain a single letter key, such as [S] to solo a track, can now be used even when the Computer MIDI Keyboard is enabled by adding [Shift], e.g., [Shift][S].\n\nThe [Delete] key can be used to return radio buttons (for example, track volume buttons) to their default state.\n\nTracks can be frozen using the new shortcut [CTRL][ALT][Shift][F] (Win) / [CMD][ALT][Shift][F] (Mac).\n\nA new submenu called Clip Markers has been added to the Edit menu, which allows you to set clip start, end, and loop markers to MIDI clips when in Clip View. The corresponding shortcuts are also available in the [right-click](Win) / [CTRL-click](Mac) context menu in the MIDI Note Editor:\n\n[CTRL][F9] (Win) / [CMD][F9] (Mac) - sets the clip start marker to the selected time area of the MIDI Note Editor.\n\n[CTRL][F10] (Win) / [CMD][F10] (Mac) - sets the clip loop start marker to the selected time area of the MIDI Note Editor.\n\n[CTRL][F11] (Win) / [CMD][F11] (Mac) - sets the clip loop end marker to the selected time area of the MIDI Note Editor.\n\n[CTRL][F12] (Win) / [CMD][F12] (Mac) - sets the clip end marker to the selected time area of the MIDI Note Editor.\n\nThe new command Move Insert Marker To Playhead in the Playback menu, also accessible via the shortcut [CTRL][Shift][Space] (Win) / [CMD][Shift][Space] (Mac), will move the Arrangement insert marker to the location of the playhead.\n\nSome shortcuts can now be momentarily latched. This means you can hold down the shortcut key and briefly toggle the shortcut action. After releasing the key, Live’s UI will return to its previous state. Momentary latching becomes available after holding down a shortcut key for about 500 ms. The following shortcut keys can be momentarily latched:\n\n[A] - toggles Arrangement automation mode\n\n[B] - toggles Draw Mode\n\n[S] - toggles soloing or un-soloing the selected track\n\n[Z] - toggles zooming into the Arrangement selection\n\n[F1] through [F8] - toggles the Track Activator switch on and off for the first eight tracks\n\n[Tab] - toggles between Arrangement and Session View\n\nIf needed, momentary latching can be turned off using the Options.txt entry: -DisableHotKeyLatching\n\nIn the MIDI Note Editor, if the insert marker is selected, you can use [ALT] + the up and down arrow keys to select the next and previous notes.\n\nIn the MIDI Note Editor, it is possible to adjust note velocity and chance with the following keyboard shortcuts:\n\nAdjust note velocity: [ALT] up and down arrow keys (Win) / [CMD] up and down arrow keys (Mac)\n\nAdjust note velocity deviation: [ALT][Shift] up and down arrow keys (Win) / [CMD][Shift] up and down arrow keys (Mac)\n\nAdjust note chance: [CTRL][ALT] up and down arrow keys (Win) / [CMD][ALT][Shift] up and down arrow keys (Mac)\n\nIt is now possible to resize an Arrangement clip with the keyboard by putting the insert marker at either edge of the clip, pressing [Enter] and then using the left or right arrow key to resize. Pressing [Enter] again will apply the resize action. Pressing [ESC] will cancel the resize action.\n\nThe commands Fold/Unfold Selected Tracks [U] and Collapse/Unfold All Tracks [Shift][U] have been added to the View menu.\n\nThe keyboard shortcut for the Control Bar's Follow switch was changed to [ALT][Shift][F].\n\nUpdated keyboard shortcuts for the View menu's Browser and Groove Pool entries, and introduced a new keyboard shortcut for the View menu's Help View entry:\n\nShow/Hide Browser: [CTRL][ALT][5] (Win) / [CMD][ALT][5] (Mac)\n\nShow/Hide Groove Pool: [CTRL][ALT][6] (Win) / [CMD][ALT][6] (Mac)\n\nShow/Hide Help View: [CTRL][ALT][7] (Win) / [CMD][ALT][7] (Mac)\n\nWhen the Computer MIDI Keyboard is enabled, all hotkeys on the first and home rows are disabled to prevent causing unexpected changes to a Set when hitting a wrong key.\n\nAdded a shortcut for toggling Record in the Session View: [CTRL][Shift][F9] (Win) / [CMD][Shift][F9] (Mac).\n\nThe keyboard shortcut for the metronome was changed to [O].\n\nMeld\n\nMeld is a powerful and versatile bi-timbral macro oscillator synthesizer that comes with Live 12 Suite. Meld’s deep sound-shaping capabilities can be used to create evolving textural sounds, rhythmic drones, harmonic effects, atonal sounds and more.\n\nMeld features two macro oscillator engines (A and B) which can be layered to create a wide variety of sounds. Each engine is a full synth on its own, and offers unique shaping and tonal variations depending on the chosen oscillator type.\n\nTwo envelopes are available for Amp and Modulation per engine, which both offer various looping modes. The Link toggles can be used to apply the same envelope or filter settings to the A and B engines.\n\nA diverse set of modulation routings are accessible in a fully mappable and expandable matrix. Meld also contains two LFOs for each engine: the first is an LFO waveform that is fed into an LFO FX section that contains two possible effects which can be used to finely tune the resulting modulation, and the second is a simple LFO that can be used for standard LFO modulation.\n\nSeveral filter options are available for each oscillator engine, as well as two scale aware resonator choices in the Filters section. Individual panning, tone, and volume controls can be used to further refine each engine’s sound independently. The Tone control is a combined low/high-pass filter that can be used to round out the signal before it reaches the device’s final output.\n\nThe Settings tab contains Glissando, Portamento, and Glide Time options for each engine, as well as Osc Key Tracking toggles. When Osc Key tracking is off, the oscillator will play at a constant pitch of C3 for all MIDI notes or, if using a scale, at the root note of the scale in the C3 octave. It is also possible to enable scale awareness for the oscillators or filters.\n\nIn Meld’s Global section, you can choose between Poly or Mono voice mode, set the Stacked Voices amount (similar to unison voices), add a bit of saturation with the Drive control, and adjust the global volume.\n\nMeld’s deep modulation and routing capabilities allow for playful and expressive performances with Push 3 and other MPE controllers, but Meld also provides expressive playfulness with non-MPE devices.\n\nMIDI Note Editing Operations\n\nNew commands for editing MIDI notes have been added, making it quick and convenient to adjust notes directly in the MIDI Note Editor.\n\nSplit divides a note into two or more parts by using either the mouse or computer keyboard.\n\nSplit with mouse – Hold [E] and click inside a note at the desired location or drag vertically across it to split it. You can split multiple notes simultaneously in the same way: make a note selection, then click at the desired location in any of the selected notes to split them or drag vertically across the selection to split the notes. To split a note or multiple notes into parts based on the current grid settings, press [CTRL][E] (Win) / [CMD][E] (Mac).\n\nSplit with keyboard – If no note is selected, press [CTRL][E] (Win) / [CMD][E] (Mac) to split the note at the insert marker location or at the boundaries of the time selection.\n\nChop divides selected notes into multiple parts based on the current grid settings or in equal parts, either by using the mouse or computer keyboard.\n\nChop with mouse – Hold [CTRL][E] (Win) / [ALT][E] (Mac) so that the cursor changes to an arrow and dashed line symbol. Click on a note and drag up to divide the note into equal parts, increasing by one as you drag up. You can hold the [Shift] key together with the shortcut and the number of equal parts will increase by a factor of two as you drag up (note that [Shift] will have no effect if the Computer MIDI Keyboard is switched on). The same operations can be applied to multiple notes simultaneously.\n\nChop with keyboard – Use the shortcut [CTRL][E] (Win) / [CMD][E] (Mac) to chop notes. While still holding the shortcut keys, you can use the up and down arrow keys to divide notes into equal parts instead of grid steps. The up arrow key will add more divisions, while the down arrow key uses fewer divisions. If you add the [Shift] key, the up and down arrow keys will divide notes by a power of two (note that [Shift] will have no effect if the Computer MIDI Keyboard is switched on).\n\nJoin creates a single note from all selected notes that have the same pitch. Any MPE envelope data will be preserved when notes are joined. Use the Join Notes Edit menu command, the context menu option in the MIDI Note Editor, or the shortcut [CTRL][J] (Win) / [CMD][J] (Mac) to join selected notes.\n\nSpan (Fit to Time Range) extends selected notes so that their start and end times match the current time selection. For example, if you select multiple notes that have varying end times within a time selection of the first two bars of a four bar clip, using Span will adjust the notes so that they start at 1.1.1 and end at 3.1.1. Use the Fit to Time Range context menu option or the shortcut [CTRL][ALT][J] (Win) / [CMD][ALT][J] (Mac) to span notes.\n\nWhen using letter-based shortcuts, such as [E] to Split, make sure that the Computer MIDI Keyboard option is switched off so that the keyboard triggers the shortcut and not a MIDI note. Alternatively, you can add the [Shift] key to the shortcut in order to be able to use it while the Computer MIDI Keyboard is on.\n\nMIDI Note Probability Groups\n\nA single Chance value can now be assigned to a group of notes so that either all notes play according to the set probability, or only one note out of the group plays at a time.\n\nThere are a few different ways to group note probabilities together:\n\nUse the Edit menu command Group Notes (Play All).\n\nUse the shortcut [CTRL][G] (Win) / [CMD][G] (Mac).\n\nUse the [right-click](Win) / [CTRL-click](Mac) context menu option Group Notes (Play All) or Group Notes (Play One) in the MIDI Note Editor.\n\nOnce grouped, a single marker will be available for the set of grouped notes in the Chance editor. The marker will have a diamond handle (Play All) or triangle handle (Play One) opposed to a circle handle to visually signal that it affects grouped notes, not a single note.\n\nRight-clicking on a grouped note marker lets you pick from two options:\n\nPlay All – All notes will be played (or not) depending on the Chance amount.\n\nPlay One – Only one note in the group will be played at a time based on the Chance amount.\n\nGrouped notes can be ungrouped using the Edit command Ungroup Notes, shortcut [CTRL][Shift][G] (Win) / [CMD][Shift][G] (Mac), or by right-clicking on a grouped note marker and selecting Ungroup Notes. Once ungrouped, individual markers will be available for each note in the Chance editor.\n\nHovering over a note that belongs to a group now highlights all the notes within the group.\n\nThe Status Bar now indicates the Probability Group Type when selecting multiple notes. When all the notes belong to the same group, the type is listed explicitly, otherwise it is marked with an asterisk.\n\nThe Probability Group Type selected when grouping notes or changing the group’s type will now be used as the default type for the next note group created through the Edit menu or using the [CTRL][G] (Win) / [CMD][G] (Mac) keyboard shortcut.\n\nA small triangle displayed on MIDI notes that have a probability value of <1.0 is now also displayed when a note belongs in a probability group (even if the probability of this group is 1).\n\nIntroduced MIDI Tools, a set of MIDI Transformations and Generators which can be used to automatically shape and create MIDI notes in creative and surprising ways.\n\nIn Clip View, two new Tools tabs have been added, one containing transformations and the other generators.\n\nMIDI Transformations:\n\nArpeggiate splits up chords into smaller arpeggiated notes based on the chosen pattern settings.\n\nConnect fills empty gaps between successive notes or chords by adding connecting notes with specified density, length, rate, and pitch settings.\n\nOrnament adds short strokes (flam) or grace notes at the beginning of existing notes.\n\nQuantize applies quantization based on the chosen grid options.\n\nRecombine rearranges the properties of a series of notes so that the pitch, length, or velocity settings of one note in the series are applied to a different note.\n\nSpan adjusts the length of note end times using legato, tenuto, or staccato timing.\n\nStrum applies an offset to note start times for all successive notes in a chord, starting at either the highest or lowest note.\n\nTime Warp stretches or compresses notes based on the speed curve as determined by two adjustable breakpoints.\n\nMIDI Generators:\n\nRhythm generates a rhythmic pattern of notes and velocity accents.\n\nSeed randomly generates notes using adjustable pitch, duration, and velocity ranges.\n\nShape generates a sequence of notes with varying pitches based on drawn shapes or selected shape presets.\n\nStacks generates between one and four chords based on various chord rules that can be further tweaked and inverted.\n\nEach MIDI Tool has a Transform or Generate toggle; when enabled, any changes that get made to the tool’s parameters are applied to notes in real-time. When switched off, parameters can be adjusted freely, and the changes will only be applied when pressing the Apply button. The Reset button can be used to restore the tool's parameters to the default values.\n\nChanges made to MIDI Tool parameters are saved with Live Sets.\n\nIn addition to the built-in MIDI Tools, new Max for Live objects can be used to create custom MIDI Transformations and Generators.\n\nBy default, two Max for Live MIDI Tools are included in the Clip View’s Transformation Tools and Generative Tools tabs/panels:\n\nVelocity Shaper allows transforming note velocities using an envelope.\n\nRhythm Euclidean generates a rhythmic pattern of notes.\n\nThese tools utilize the new Array and String objects that were recently added to Max 8.6.0.\n\nTo create a custom MIDI Tool, you can click on the Edit button when a Max for Live MIDI Tool is selected to open its corresponding Max patcher. You can change the existing parameters and then save the updated patcher as a new .amxd file.\n\nFor custom MIDI Tools to show in Clip View, they must be saved to a folder in Live's Places.\n\nIn the browser, Max for Live MIDI Tools can be found in the All and Max for Live labels. Max for Live MIDI Tools can also be found using the new filters MIDI Transformation and MIDI Generator within the Device Function filter group.\n\nMixer in Arrangement\n\nThe Session View mixer is now accessible in Arrangement View.\n\nYou can click the Mixer view control at the bottom right corner of Live's window to expand or collapse the mixer in either Session or Arrangement View. Using the drop-down menu next to the toggle, you can select which areas of the mixer are displayed, e.g., I/O, Sends, Track Volume, etc.\n\nThe mixer can also be opened from the View menu using the Mixer entry or the shortcut [CTRL][ALT][M] (Win) / [CMD][ALT][M] (Mac).\n\nThe term \"mixer\" now refers to the entire subview that contains In/Out, Sends, Returns, Volume, Track Delay, Crossfader, and Performance Impact controls.\n\nYou can configure individual mixer sections and Return Tracks using the Mixer Controls entry in the View menu.\n\nThe section that contains meters is now called Volume and it currently doesn’t have an assigned shortcut.\n\nThe sections to the right of Track Headers in the Arrangement View are now called Arrangement Track Controls. You can configure their visibility as well as the visibility of the Return Tracks in the View menu under the Arrangement Track Controls entry. Arrangement Track Controls no longer have shortcuts assigned to them since these are now used for the mixer sections.\n\nPitch and Time Utilities\n\nIn Clip View, the Notes panel has been renamed to Pitch and Time Utilities and has been divided into two sections: Pitch and Time, which contain controls for adjusting note pitch and timing, respectively.\n\nPitch Tools:\n\nFit to Scale moves notes to fit within the current clip scale.\n\nInvert flips the notes \"upside-down\" so that the highest note is swapped with the lowest note.\n\nTranspose adjusts the pitch transposition for notes in either semitones or scale degrees, if the clip has an active scale.\n\nAdd Interval creates new notes at the given number of semitones or scale degrees as specified in the Interval Size parameter.\n\nTime Tools:\n\nDouble stretches notes, the time region, or loop by a factor of 2.\n\nHalve compresses notes, the time region, or loop by a factor of 2.\n\nStretch Factor compresses or stretches notes by a factor that can be set in the range from ÷10 to x10.\n\nSet Length determines the note length of notes, including fitting note lengths to grid or selected time range.\n\nHumanize adds an amount of slight random variation to note start times specified in the Humanize Amount slider, ranging from 0% to 100%.\n\nReverse reverses notes horizontally around the center of the time selection. If no time is selected, all notes in the clip will be reversed.\n\nLegato lengthens or shortens each note so that it is just long enough to reach the beginning of the next note.\n\nRoar\n\nRoar is a dynamic saturation audio effect that comes with Live 12 Suite. Roar can comfortably move from subtle and precise mastering-grade warmth to wild and unpredictable sound mangling.\n\nInput signals can be routed into one of five different Routing Modes: Single, Serial, Parallel, Multiband, Mid/Side, and Feedback. In Multiband Mode, Low/High crossover frequencies are available. In Feedback Mode, you can blend between the direct and the feedback signal. Drive and Tone controls can be used to adjust the incoming signal before it is sent to the Gain Stage section.\n\nDepending on which Routing Mode is selected, you can apply a shaper curve to the signal in one or more gain stages. Roar offers a selection of wide saturation shaper curves, varying from subtle to distorted, that can be adjusted further using Amount and Bias controls. Several filter options are available and can be applied before or after the shaper.\n\nThere are two LFOs, an Envelope Follower, and a Noise generator for complex modulation possibilities, as well as an expansive Modulation Matrix for easy mappings for most of the device’s parameters. You can use the toggle in the device title bar to access the matrix in an expanded view.\n\nFeedback can be added to define the amount of signal that gets fed back into the device’s input using various time modes. The feedback signal can also be inverted and adjusted with a band-pass filter.\n\nThe Compress control lets you determine the amount of masterbus compression, while the global Output control sets the overall processed signal in dB.\n\nScale Awareness\n\nLive 12 offers a new way of choosing and viewing scales, as well as the option of applying scales across MIDI effects and devices.\n\nYou can now select or change a scale for clips using the Scale Mode controls in Live's Control Bar.\n\nThe Scale Mode controls will also reflect any changes when clips with different scales are played, making it easy to see at a glance which scales are in use in a Set.\n\nWhen multiple clips are selected with different scale values, these differences are indicated with asterisks in the Current Scale Name and Current Scale Root Note drop-down menus.\n\nWhen multiple clips are selected with different scale awareness states (e.g., if a scale is active or not), this difference is indicated by partially color-filling the Scale Mode toggle.\n\nWhen multiple clips are selected, changes to scale settings made in the Control Bar will apply to all selected clips.\n\nIn Clip View, when a scale is active, a new Highlight Scale option appears in the MIDI Note Editor. When enabled, the key tracks that belong to notes of the scale will be highlighted in a unique purple color that is used to signify scale awareness throughout Live.\n\nWhen a scale is active, the pitch-related parameters in MIDI Tools and Pitch and Time Utilities will also use the selected scale.\n\nThe built-in MIDI effects Arpeggiator, Chord, Pitch, Random, and Scale have new Use Current Scale toggles in their device title bars. When switched on, the clip's current scale will be applied and pitch-based device parameters can be adjusted in scale degrees opposed to semitones.\n\nIn the Meld device, it is also possible to enable scale awareness for the oscillators or filters.\n\nScreen Reader Support\n\nWith the introduction of screen reader support, most of Live's core workflows are now accessible to screen reader users. The following areas of Live can be used with screen readers:\n\nTransport controls\n\nBrowser search\n\nArrangement View\n\nSession View\n\nClip and Scene properties\n\nMIDI clip editing\n\nNative effects and instruments\n\nMIDI and Key mapping\n\nWorking with grooves\n\nTuning systems\n\nThird-party devices are also currently compatible with screen readers but only to a certain extent.\n\nThe following areas are not supported for screen readers in Live 12:\n\nBrowser filtering and tagging\n\nAudio warping\n\nAutomation, modulation, and MPE editing\n\nMax for Live devices\n\nMIDI and audio metering\n\nSimilarity Search\n\nSimilarity Search can be used to find similar sounds based on a reference file for audio samples, instrument presets, and drum presets.\n\nIn the browser, compatible files will include a Similarity Search icon, clicking on which will return a list of sounds similar to the given file. You can also right-click on an item and select Show Similar Files or use the [CTRL][Shift][F] (Win) / [CTRL][Shift][F] (Mac) shortcut to view this list. The reference file will be shown in the search field and all relevant similar sounding items will be listed below in the order from most to least similar. To the right of each result is a visual representation of how similar an item is compared to the reference sound.\n\nCustom-saved browser categories will remember and reestablish the sound file on which the Similarity Search was based when the category was saved. Note that in such a custom-saved category, the reference file will not be displayed in the search field when opening the category.\n\nPlease note that it might take a while for Live to analyze larger libraries and for the feature to be usable for all files. Also, Similarity Search does not support samples longer than 60 seconds.\n\nSimilar Sample Swapping\n\nIn addition to searching for similar sounds, it is also possible to swap samples based on their similarity in the Simpler and Drum Rack devices using Similar Sample Swapping.\n\nIn Simpler, you can click the Swap to Previous Similar Sample or Swap to Next Similar Sample buttons at the bottom right corner of the Sample Display next to the Hot-Swap button to load and cycle through similar sounds.\n\nYou can use the Return to Reference context menu option to go back to the original sample that was used as the basis for establishing sound similarity, or the Save as Similarity Reference option to set the currently loaded sample as the new reference sound.\n\nIn Drum Racks, the Show/Hide Sample Swap Buttons toggle at the right of the device's title bar can be switched on to display similarity swapping options for both the entire Rack and individual pads:\n\nSwap All Pads to Previous Similar Sample - swaps all pads in the Rack to the previous similar sample.\n\nSwap All Pads to Next Similar Sample - swaps all pads in the Rack to the next similar sample.\n\nSwap to Previous Similar Sample - swaps an individual pad to the previous similar sample.\n\nSwap to Next Similar Sample - swaps an individual pad the next similar sample.\n\nLock Pad for Similar Sample Swapping - locks an individual pad so that the sample is not updated when swapping out samples in the entire Rack.\n\nYou can also hold the [ALT] key to temporarily display the similarity swapping options.\n\nAs in Simpler, you can go back to the original sample using the Return to Reference context menu option , or set the currently loaded sample as the new reference sound using the Save as Similarity Reference option.\n\nWhen using Hot-Swap mode with Simpler, Drum Rack, or an individual Drum Rack pad, clicking the Show Similar Files button next to the selected sample in the browser will display similar-sounding samples which can then be loaded into the device as needed.\n\nNote that Similar Sample Swapping does not support samples longer than 60 seconds.\n\nToggle Clip View Alongside Device View\n\nIt is now possible to access Clip View and Device View at the same time.\n\nTo open both views simultaneously, use the triangle buttons next to the Clip View and Device View Selectors in the bottom-right corner of the Live window, or use the keyboard shortcuts [CTRL][ALT][3] (Win) / [CMD][ALT][3] (Mac) for showing Clip View and [CTRL][ALT][4] (Win) / [CMD][ALT][4] (Mac) for showing Device View.\n\nWhen only one of the views is displayed, you can still switch between them using the [Shift][Tab] keyboard shortcut or by clicking on the respective view selector tab. When both are shown, [Shift][Tab] will move the focus between the two views.\n\nHolding [ALT] and clicking on either the Clip View or Device View toggle will open both views at the same time.\n\nNote that the width of the Device Breakout View is no longer constrained by the browser, it stretches across the entire application window.\n\nTuning Systems\n\nLive now supports Scala files, which can be used in Sets to access new tuning options apart from Live’s default 12TET tuning. The Live 12 Core Library also includes a set of various tuning systems, which you can find in the new Tunings label in the browser.\n\nYou can select the Tuning entry in Live’s View menu or double-click an .ascl file in the browser to open the Tuning panel.\n\nWhen a tuning system is loaded, the corresponding pitches will be played when using any of Live's built-in instruments, as well as any MPE-enabled plug-ins and external instruments, provided that the pitch bend range is set to 48 semitones. Note that non-MPE-enabled instruments or instruments with different pitch bend ranges will play out of tune.\n\nPlug-ins and Max for Live MIDI effects will also be adjusted to follow a loaded tuning system. Note that Drum Racks will automatically bypass a loaded tuning system when added to MIDI tracks.\n\nWhen a tuning system is loaded into a Set, the scale controls and features in MIDI clips and in the Control Bar will be hidden.\n\nIn the Tuning panel of the browser, additional options are available for adjusting the reference pitch of a loaded tuning system. The default octave for tuning system reference pitch is set to 3.\n\nThe toggle to the left of a tuning system's name can be used to access the details of the tuning system in an expanded view. The following details are taken from the description included in the Scala file and displayed in Live: Source, Link, and Number of notes per octave.\n\nThe details of a tuning system file are displayed in the Info View when hovering over a loaded tuning system's name\n\nA loaded tuning system can be saved as an .ascl file by clicking the floppy disk icon in the Tuning section of the browser.\n\nThe Bypass Tuning toggle in the I/O section of the mixer can be used to bypass a loaded tuning system for an individual MIDI track.\n\nIt is also possible to configure a track tuning layout for external MIDI controllers using the Track Tuning MIDI Mapper chooser in the I/O section. When using tuning systems with different MIDI controller layouts, it is possible to see the corresponding input key for different notes in the Status Bar when hovering over notes in the piano roll.\n\nYou can select a loaded tuning system and press the [Delete] key to return to Live's default of 12-tone equal temperament.\n\nUI View Styling\n\nLive’s UI has been modernized and streamlined, making it easier to view at a glance.\n\nThe overall appearance of Live's various views (such as the Arrangement View, Clip View, Session View, and Live's browser and Preferences), have been updated as follows:\n\nNew view controls for the browser, Session/Arrangement View, the mixer, and Info View have been added to the outer corners of Live's window and can be toggled to show/hide the corresponding views.\n\nNew Live Themes have been added with specific options for warm/cool tones and high contrast. Live can also be set to follow your operating system's Light or Dark theme.\n\nWhen using a second window, the zoom level of Live’s first and second windows can be adjusted independently in the Display & Input Preferences.\n\nThe Groove Pool selector has been removed for now. The Groove Pool can now be shown/hidden via the new drop-down menu next to the Show/Hide Browser and Groove Pool toggle, and it can still be shown/hidden via the View menu's Groove Pool option.\n\nThe Show/Hide controls for all Session/Arrangement View mixer sections (i.e., In/Out, Sends, Returns, Mixer, Track Delays, Crossfader, and Performance Impact) have been removed for now. The various mixer sections can still be shown/hidden via the View menu's respective options.\n\nThe Arrangement View's Clip Overview area, Beat-Time Ruler, and Time Ruler have been visually integrated into the Arrangement View.\n\nScrollbars have been redesigned and will now appear as an element inside the scrolled area. Added a Show Scroll Bars option to the Display & Input Preferences, which can be set to \"Always\" or \"When Scrolling\". When selecting the latter, scrollbars will only appear in the UI while scrolling or if the current scroll position changes through another action, such as changing the size of Live’s window.\n\nLive’s Preferences now use a new tab styling.\n\nThe borders around all of Live's views have been removed.\n\nAll main views now have a slight rounding at their edges.\n\nThe Control Bar now adapts to the application’s window width so that all controls fit within 1280px width screen resolution.\n\nFeature Improvements\n\nArrangement View\n\nMIDI clips can now be reversed in Arrangement View by pressing the [R] key.\n\nThe full clip content is now displayed for deactivated clips in Arrangement View.\n\nA new toggle to the right of the Time Ruler can be used to switch on vertical waveform zooming for all audio clip waveforms. There is also a slider to set the zoom factor, which can be applied in x (multiplied by) or dB (which can be selected using the right-click context menu). The waveforms in Arrangement View and the Clip View's Sample Editor will be displayed using the set zoom level. If there is a positive zoom level set it will also be applied to audio clip waveforms as they are recorded.\n\nA new Move Clips with Arrow Keys option has been added to the Display & Input Preferences. When enabled, it is possible to move selected clips using the left and right arrow keys in Arrangement View. When switched off, the left arrow key will collapse the time selection to the start point, and the right arrow key will collapse the time selection to the end point.\n\nMoving the Insert Marker to the edges of clips with [CTRL] (Win) / [ALT] (Mac) and the left/right arrow keys now works in Automation Mode.\n\nWhen selecting a track, take lane or automation lane header in Arrangement View while the Clip/Device View is open, that lane's content is now also selected.\n\nThe Optimize Arrangement Height/Width toggles in Arrangement View are now situated underneath the Main track, next to the time ruler and the new waveform vertical zoom controls.\n\nBrowser\n\nThe new All category replaces the “All results” category that previously appeared when entering a term in the search field. When using search, the results displayed in the All category are any items from the entire library (Packs, Plug-ins, Max for Live, User Library and folders) that match the search query, displayed as a flat list.\n\nAlmost all items within the browser’s categories can now be multi-selected.\n\nWhen unfolding a Live Set in the browser, the expanded list of tracks now includes the Set’s return tracks and Main track. You can unfold the tracks in the Set to reveal a Devices icon representing their device chains. You can then move these chains into the currently open Set using drag and drop or by double-clicking on the chain. The Device settings from the original Set are retained, but any previously recorded automation is not.\n\nSorting plug-ins by Rank in the header of Live’s browser now sorts content by the frequency of use, as expected.\n\nUsers can now view Live’s browser history. The Browse Forward and Browse Back buttons next to the search bar can be used to take a step forward or back in the browser’s history.\n\nThe browser can be opened and closed by dragging away from and towards the window margin, respectively.\n\nParts of the browser will now run asynchronously, and therefore won’t block the UI anymore when using large libraries. If needed, asynchronous mode can be switched off using the Options.txt entry: _Feature.Browser.AsyncLoading=off.\n\nAdded a \"Browser File Preview\" entry to the Options menu. When enabled, this option will automatically play the selected browser item.\n\nThe Sounds category now shows all built-in presets and user presets.\n\nCore Library updates:\n\nNew presets were added for the new Meld and Roar devices.\n\nMost of the samples and Racks released with Note are now also available in the Live Core library.\n\nOperator presets now have Note Pitch Bend enabled.\n\nClip View\n\nEditor View Modes\n\nThe MIDI and audio editing parameters in Live 11’s Tool tabs have been moved to the top of the MIDI Note Editor/Sample Editor and are now stored in different tabs referred to as Editor View Modes. You can cycle to the next or previous view mode using the keyboard shortcuts [ALT][Tab] and [ALT][Shift][Tab].\n\nIn audio clips, the following Editor View Modes are available:\n\nSample - displays the audio file and sample editing options.\n\nEnvelopes - displays the Envelope Editor. This mode replaced the Envelopes tab/panel; the respective controls are now displayed at the bottom of the Envelopes Editor.\n\nIn MIDI clips, the available Editor View Modes are:\n\nNotes - displays the MIDI Note Editor and Velocity/Chance Editors (except in Live editions where Chance is not supported). The Randomize, Randomize Range, and Velocity Range (renamed to Velocity Deviation) controls previously located in the Notes tab/panel are now displayed at the bottom of the Notes Editor. A drop-down menu can be used to show/hide the Velocity and Chance lanes. A lane header's context menu allows to swap the currently visible lane with a hidden lane, making it possible to quickly change which lane is visible.\n\nEnvelopes - displays the Envelopes Editor. This mode replaced the Envelopes tab/panel; the respective controls are now displayed at the bottom of the Envelopes Editor. Note that when the Envelopes Editor is open, the Pitch and Time Utilities, MIDI Transformative and Generative Tools tabs/panels are disabled.\n\nMPE - displays the MPE Editor. This mode replaced the Note Expression tab/panel. The expression lane names were removed from the lane headers, and they are now displayed when hovering over the lanes. A drop-down menu can be used to show/hide the Slide, Pressure, Velocity, and Release Velocity (previously named \"R.Velocity\") expression lanes. A lane header's context menu allows to swap the currently visible lanes with hidden lanes, making it possible to quickly change which lanes are visible.\n\nThe Quantize Settings dialog was replaced by a Quantize tab/panel in audio clips and the Quantize MIDI Tool in MIDI clips. The Edit menu's Quantize command and the [CTRL][Shift][U] (Win) / [CMD][Shift][U] (Mac) keyboard shortcut now open the Quantize Settings controls in their new locations.\n\nMultiple audio clips can now be quantized at the same time. If the Current Grid option is selected, the Triplets option will now be grayed out.\n\nGrid Options are now accessible from the Sample/MIDI Note Editor title bar.\n\nThe shortcuts Narrow Grid [CTRL][1] (Win) / [CMD][1] (Mac) and Widen Grid [CTRL][2] (Win) / [CMD][2] (Mac) have been added to the context menus in the MIDI Note Editor and Sample Editor, as well as in the Grid chooser within both Editors.\n\nAdded a Step Input Mode entry to the Options menu, enabled when a single MIDI clip is selected. When activated, Step Input Mode will arm the track containing the clip, focus the Clip View and toggle the Computer MIDI Keyboard, to allow for faster step recording using either the Computer MIDI Keyboard or an external MIDI device. Note that the Step Input Mode menu entry is not a toggle.\n\nAdded clip modulation and MIDI mapping support for the following warp modes:\n\nBeats - Transient Envelope\n\nTones - Grain Size\n\nTexture - Grain Size, Flux\n\nComplex Pro - Formants, Envelope\n\nAdded the Normalize Clip Sample command to the Sample Editor’s context menu.\n\nThe MIDI Step Input buttons are now located next to the Grid Options in the MIDI Note Editor’s title bar when in Key or MIDI mapping mode.\n\nThe Fold to Notes (previously Fold) and Fold to Scale commands were added to the View menu.\n\nWhen a scale is enabled in Clip View or in the Control Bar, the Fold to Scale option becomes available in the MIDI Note Editor. A Highlight Scale checkbox also becomes available and allows to switch scale highlighting on and off.\n\nThe Fold to Notes and Fold to Scale modes can be toggled by pressing [F] and [G] keys respectively. Note that if the Computer MIDI Keyboard is on, you need to also add the [Shift] key for the shortcuts to work.\n\nA \"MIDI Editor Note Preview\" command has been added to the Options menu.\n\nThe MIDI Editor Preview button is now located above the piano roll.\n\nWhen the MIDI Editor Preview switch is enabled, selecting one or more notes using the computer keyboard navigation controls [CTRL] + left/right or up/down arrow keys (Win) / [ALT] + left/right or up/down arrow keys (Mac) will play the notes. When using multi-clip editing, keyboard selection will also work if Focus mode is enabled.\n\nAdded the Crop Clip to Time Selection command to the time selection context menu in the Sample Editor and MIDI Note Editor.\n\nWhen cropping MIDI clips, notes that extend beyond the selected cropping range are trimmed to fit within the new clip boundaries.\n\nThe sample information of an audio clip (i.e., the file name, sample rate, bit depth, and channel count) is now displayed in the Sample Editor’s title bar instead of the clip's title bar.\n\nLoop controls will now be hidden when the Linked switch is toggled in Clip View’s Envelopes panel.\n\nThe duration of note preview when holding down the mouse on the note or the piano roll was increased.\n\nThe Clip Gain slider design has been updated to show a scale representing the highest and lowest possible gain amounts, as well as a colored bar that appears when making adjustments above or below 0 dB. This design now matches the updated meters in the mixer.\n\nThe velocity ramp controls now display the velocity of the first and last note in the selection. They become inactive if the selection has fewer than two notes.\n\nIt is now possible to split and chop notes in Expression View Mode, with the same interaction patterns as in Notes mode. Note that this functionality does not work if Draw Mode is active.\n\nThe Randomize button and Randomize Range slider were moved to the MIDI Editor footer in both the Velocity and Chance lanes. Randomize now uses a specific starting point to generate random values every time the button is pressed, making results more predictable as you adjust the amount of randomization.\n\nThe Velocity Range slider was renamed to Velocity Deviation and moved to the MIDI Editor footer.\n\nAdditional Clip View Improvements\n\nClip View and Device View can now be toggled open by clicking on the entire length and width of the Clip and Device View Selectors. Previously, the clickable area was smaller.\n\nClip View and Device View toggles will now be displayed in yellow whenever the views associated with them are selected.\n\nThe Quantize command [CTRL][U] (Win) / [CMD][U] (Mac) has been improved to apply within a time selection when relevant.\n\nAdded an Invert Selection command to the Edit menu, which inverts the selection of notes in the MIDI Note Editor. Invert Selection is also accessible via the MIDI Note Editor's context menu or the [CTRL][Shift][A] (Win) / [CMD][Shift][A] (Mac) keyboard shortcut.\n\nIt is now possible to label a clip’s notes with their MIDI note numbers instead of accidentals, by using the new MIDI Note Number command in the piano roll’s context menu. Also, the Accidentals/MIDI Note Number setting most recently applied to a clip will now be used for the next created clip.\n\nDevices\n\nArpeggiator\n\nAdded a toggle to the device's title bar that collapses/expands the device view.\n\nAdded a Use Current Scale toggle to the device's title bar. When enabled, and if a clip has an active scale, Arpeggiator follows the scale selected in the Current Scale Root Note and Current Scale Name choosers, which is indicated by purple dots on the Root Note and Scale choosers in the device. If a scale is not active, the device follows the scale selected in its own Root Note and Scale choosers.\n\nUpdated the UI of the device to feature a display which includes Style, Hold, Offset, and Groove controls, as well as a visualization of the selected Arpeggiator pattern.\n\nAdded Previous/Next Style Pattern arrow buttons respectively to the left and right side of the Style Pattern visualization, below the Style chooser. The buttons allow cycling through and choosing the rhythmical pattern used by Arpeggiator.\n\nAdjusted some spacing and rearranged some controls.\n\nThe Distance control is grayed out when Steps is set to 0.\n\nWhen Arpeggiator uses a scale (either the current clip scale or an internal scale selected from Arpeggiator’s own transpose mode chooser), the Distance parameter will display scale degrees instead of semitones.\n\nThe Arpeggiator device now transforms per-note pitch bend messages in scale when the Use Current Scale option is enabled.\n\nChord\n\nAdded a Use Current Scale toggle to the device's title bar. When enabled, and if a clip has an active scale, Pitch follows the scale selected in the Current Scale Root Note and Current Scale Name choosers.\n\nAdded a Strum control that can be used to insert a delay between the notes in the chord. The Strum Tension control can be used to accelerate or decelerate the strumming. Note that Strum Tension is only enabled if Strum is activated.\n\nAdded a Strum Crescendo parameter that applies an additional multiplier to the velocities of notes in a chord, in addition to the already existing Velocity parameters. Positive values produce velocities with an upwards ramp, whereas negative values produce velocities with a downwards ramp. The velocity ramp is applied to outgoing notes in the order in which they're played. Note that Strum Crescendo is only enabled if Strum is activated.\n\nAdded a Velocity/Chance toggle that allows adjusting velocity/probability values for each note.\n\nAdded a Learn feature that saves chord parameter settings from its MIDI input. When the Learn button is activated, the Shift and Velocity parameter settings will be overwritten by the next played chord.\n\nAdded LEDs next to each shift dial, to indicate when the corresponding note is played.\n\nChord can now send MPE data to notes by enabling the Send Per Note Events to Generated Notes context menu option. When scale awareness is enabled, Chord will transform pitch bend messages so that bent chords stay within the scale.\n\nEnvelope MIDI\n\nThe ADSR envelope display was updated to allow changing slopes directly in the envelope UI as well as with the Attack, Decay and Release Slopes sliders.\n\nEnvelope MIDI features a new implementation of Sync mode. Note that this may result in a slight sound difference compared to previous device builds.\n\nExpression Control\n\nThe UI of Expression Control has been completely overhauled. It is now possible to edit modulation sources in separate tabs, each of which includes its own curve display. As in the other updated modulator devices, the Modulate toggle can be used to apply modulation to a target without taking over the value completely. This new version of Expression Control replaces the older one, which has been renamed to Expression Control Legacy; when opening Live Sets from Live 11 that contain Expression Control, the legacy version of the device will be loaded.\n\nLFO\n\nA new Steps parameter can be used to adjust up to 24 steps in the selected waveform.\n\nA new Shape parameter allows to bend or skew the selected waveform.\n\nAdded Stray, a new LFO waveform type.\n\nAdded Glider, a new LFO waveform type.\n\nA dynamic offset line has been added.\n\nA 10x toggle for audio rate modulation has been added.\n\nMax for Live Devices Improvements\n\nThe LFO, Shaper, Expression Control, Envelope Follower, Envelope MIDI, and Shaper MIDI devices now support modulation; this means that a parameter's relative value can be modulated without taking the value over completely. The behavior can be controlled via the Mod toggle. There are also Modulation Polarity switches which can be used to flip the polarity of the modulation. If the Mod toggle is switched off, any mapped modulation behaves exactly as it did prior to this change, e.g., the parameter value is taken over and cannot be adjusted independently.\n\nClip Modulation is now enabled on all built-in Max for Live device parameters.\n\nThe devices now feature faster load times and optimized performance.\n\nIn modulator devices:\n\nNon-LCD numboxes now use slider controls.\n\nThe visual mapping state is canceled after trying to map to a parameter that was already mapped.\n\nPatch code is formatted and commented consistently, using all latest Max features, for users who open up the devices (note that this does not apply to DS devices).\n\nMultiband Dynamics\n\nThe Multiband Dynamics device’s interface has been updated. The Time (Attack and Release) parameters, Above Threshold and Ratio parameters, and Below Threshold and Ratio parameters are now displayed in individual sections.\n\nNote Length\n\nAdded a Latch mode, which you can turn on using the new Latch button beneath the Trigger Source switch. Latch mode operates differently based on whether the Trigger Source switch is set to Note On or Note Off. If Note On is selected, latched notes will end when all keys and a sustain pedal (if connected) are released and a new Note On message is received. If Note Off is selected, latched notes will start playing when all keys and a sustain pedal (if connected) are released and a new Note Off message is received.\n\nSwapped the positions of the Gate and Length knobs.\n\nSplit the Time mode toggle into two separate buttons, now positioned below the Length knob.\n\nRenamed the \"Release Vel.2\" control to \"Rel Vel\".\n\nRenamed the \"Decay Time\" control to \"Decay\".\n\nOperator\n\nAdded per-note pitch-bend support to the Operator device, which can be enabled via the Enable Note Pitch Bend context menu entry in the device's title bar. Note: Switching this option off can help preserve a stable pitch when using an MPE controller as input.\n\nPitch\n\nAdded a Use Current Scale toggle to the device's title bar. When enabled, and if a clip has an active scale, Pitch follows the scale selected in the Current Scale Root Note and Current Scale Name choosers.\n\nAdded Step Down/Up (-/+) buttons and a dedicated Step Width slider underneath the Pitch control. The Step Down/Up buttons decrease/increase the Pitch parameter by the distance set in the Step Width slider. All of these controls can be assigned Key and/or MIDI mappings.\n\nRepositioned the Lowest and Range sliders.\n\nAdded a Mode drop-down menu containing three different modes to choose from: Block, Fold, and Limit. The selected mode determines what happens to notes outside of the range defined by the Lowest and Range parameters.\n\nThe Pitch device now transforms per-note pitch bend messages in scale when the Use Current Scale option is enabled.\n\nRandom\n\nAdded a Use Current Scale toggle to the device's title bar. When enabled, and if a clip has an active scale, Random follows the scale selected in the Current Scale Root Note and Current Scale Name choosers.\n\nThe Scale parameter has been renamed to Interval to avoid confusion with Live’s new Current Scale features.\n\nThe Mode switch has been split into two separate toggles: Random and Alt.\n\nRandom now transforms per-note pitch bend messages in scale when the Use Current Scale option is enabled.\n\nSampler\n\nA new Round Robin feature has been added to the Sampler device’s Zone Editor. This feature lets you cycle through samples in four different ways: Forward, Backward, Other, and Random. The Zone Editor also has a Round Robin Reset Interval selector, which resets the counter at a chosen time interval (¼ Bar, ½ Bar, 1 Bar, 2 Bars, or 4 Bars).\n\nShaper\n\nThe Shaper device now offers different play modes: Loop, One-shot and Manual. In the Manual mode, the adjusted shape can be scrolled through back and forth with a dial, while the One-shot mode offers a mappable button to trigger the Shape once.\n\nScale\n\nIf there is an active clip in the track containing the device, Scale's parameters now follow the clip’s Root Note and Scale Name settings.\n\nWhen following the song or clip scale, the effective scale and root note are indicated in the Base and Scale name choosers.\n\nAdded info text for the Scale Name chooser and Transpose knob.\n\nOther Device Improvements\n\nDrum Rack return chains can now be reordered.\n\nWhen selecting two or more chains within a Drum, Instrument, Audio Effect, or MIDI Effect Rack, the parameters of the selected chains can be altered at the same time.\n\nImproved delay time calculations in the Echo device, which ensures more consistent and reliable sound effects.\n\nRemoved the MPE label from the title bars of the following devices: Electric, Simpler, Sampler, Wavetable as all Live instruments can now support MPE.\n\nDevice View\n\nAudio and MIDI signal meters in the Device View are now taller, making them significantly easier to read.\n\nAdded a background and rounded corners to device drop areas.\n\nWhen adding an audio effect to a device chain in which there are no instruments present, there is now an additional audio meter visible on the right side of the instrument drop area.\n\nDevice chain input meters are now displayed on the separator between the Info View and Device View if the Info View is open.\n\nDevice chain input meters are now displayed on the leftmost edge of the Device View if the Info View is closed.\n\nInterface\n\nAdded a Resync External Hardware option for sending resync messages to clock-synced hardware. When Sync is enabled for a device, you can set the resync behavior using the drop-down menu in the MIDI port’s output via the Link, Tempo & MIDI Preferences. In the same Preferences page, you can also enable the Show Resync Button, which will then display a Resync External Hardware indicator in Live’s Control Bar.\n\nAdded a Playback menu, which contains commands related to playback and recording.\n\nThe Master Track was renamed to \"Main Track\", and the Master routing target was renamed to \"Main\".\n\nThe View menu now has a Scene Tempo and Time Signature entry, which shows or hides scene tempo and time signature values in the Main Track.\n\nLive's demo Set can now be loaded using the new Load Demo Set entry in the Help menu.\n\nUsing the \"Insert Empty MIDI Clips\" command in the Create menu or in the context menu for multiple selected empty clip slots (Session View) or multiple selected empty MIDI track lanes (Arrangement View) now creates multiple empty MIDI clips.\n\nYou can now freeze and flatten tracks in a single step using the new \"Freeze and Flatten Track\" command. This command can be found in the Edit menu, or the right-click context menu of a Track Title Bar.\n\nThe \"Track Delay\" option in the View menu was renamed to \"Track Options\". When opened, Track Options still features the Track Delay control, as well as a new Keep Latency button. When Keep Latency is on with monitoring active, the recording reflects the monitoring latency. When Keep Latency is off, Live no longer uses the monitoring latency in the recording. When monitoring is off, the Keep Latency control is disabled. If recording two tracks with monitoring enabled at the same time, one with Keep Latency on, and one with Keep Latency off, the former will show the recorded audio later on the timeline.\n\nReturn tracks can now be copied, pasted, duplicated, and reordered.\n\nSwitching between the Session View and Arrangement View when dragging a clip to the respective view selector button now happens immediately in the second window.\n\nWhen selecting a clip or time selection in Session or Arrangement View, the content in the track will remain selected when switching between Session and Arrangement. This means that the track highlighting will stay with the expected track when moving between views.\n\nHolding down the mouse-wheel now pans views in Live, such as the Arrangement View, Session View, or any scrollable area.\n\nResetting a value to its default by either double-clicking on a slider or pressing the Delete key is now possible in more places in Live.\n\nIf an audio device selected in the Preferences doesn't open correctly, the audio device chooser will now preserve the selection instead of reverting to the last used device.\n\nLive’s Splash, About and Welcome screens now feature a new look.\n\nThe list of tabs in Live's Preferences is now named the Preference Page Chooser.\n\nThe Look/Feel Preferences have been split into two new tabs: Display/Language/Input and Theme/Colors. The Theme/Color Preferences contain a new section called Theme, which can be used to set Live’s theme, as well as adjust the theme’s color tone and contrast. There is also an option to “Follow System” which will set Live’s theme based on the system’s currently selected light/dark mode preference.\n\nLive's title bar now uses the Colors system setting for light/dark mode on Windows 10 and 11.\n\nInactive controls in Live’s Control Bar now use the same foreground color.\n\nOn macOS, when viewing an existing Live Set, the main window now shows an icon that represents the document. You can right-click on the icon to reveal the directory path for the Live Set.\n\nThe project name has been removed from the title bar.\n\nLive's default Set now has the Cue Out volume set to -6 dB.\n\nReplaced the link in the Help menu that points to Ableton's homepage with one that points to Ableton's Help page.\n\nAdded a link to ableton.com to the Help View’s front page.\n\nHelp View's Table of Contents has been updated for Live 12.\n\nUpdated the What’s New lesson to include new Live 12 features. The lesson will be updated and expanded throughout the beta phase.\n\nUpdated software texts in various areas of Live.\n\nMax for Live\n\nUpdated the bundled Max build to version 8.6.0.\n\nMax is now started during the splash screen loading process when opening Live.\n\nIntroduced live.modulate~ object, which allows users to modulate Live parameters from within Max for Live.\n\nIntroduced live.map object, designed to make it simpler to retrieve the name, Live API ID and Live Object Modal path of parameters. The object is intended to simplify patches that obtain information about parameters through clicking interactions.\n\nUsing Live to open the Max editor no longer opens the in-app Max Tour.\n\nMax no longer checks for updates when using Live to open the Max editor.\n\nIntroduced support for the @normalized attribute in live.remote~ object.\n\nThe Live Object Model paths of the following items can now be obtained via their context menus:\n\nclip slots\n\nSession clips\n\nArrangement clips\n\ntracks\n\nscenes\n\ndevices\n\ndevice parameters\n\nRack chains\n\nDrum Rack pads\n\nThe Live Object Model paths of the following items can now be copied via their context menus:\n\ntrack\n\nscene\n\nsession clip slot\n\nsession clip\n\narrangement clip\n\ndevice\n\ndevice parameter\n\ndevice rack chain/drum chain\n\ndrumpad\n\nmixer device/volume\n\nmixer device/panning\n\nmixer device/left split stereo\n\nmixer device/right split stereo\n\nmixer device/track activator\n\nmixer device/sends\n\nchain mixer device/chain_activator\n\nchain mixer device/panning\n\nMixer Improvements\n\nThe overall design of the mixer has been updated to improve visibility:\n\nMixer faders now have larger handles, which have also been moved to the left of the meters. The dB values remain on the right of the meters.\n\nThe meters now provide better contrast and have rounded corners.\n\nThe maximum possible height for the mixer panel has been increased.\n\nThe meter gradient was overhauled and now shows a gradient starting at -16 dB towards 0 dB to have better visual guidance in this critical area of mixing.\n\nThe meter ballistics for peak and RMS metering have been improved.\n\nMouse handling has been improved in order to avoid sudden volume jumps.\n\nA toggle that opens/closes the mixer in Session or Arrangement View has been added to the Status Bar. Next to the toggle, there is a drop-down menu that can be used to select which areas of the mixer to display, e.g., In/Out, Sends, and so on. The enabled areas are stored with the individual view, rather than being linked across Session and Arrangement.\n\nAdded a 6-pixel-high stripe that mirrors the track color to the bottom of the mixing area in order to help with navigation and track identification.\n\nPush 1 and 2\n\nPush 2 will now use the same technology as Push 3, instead of using a remote script. This introduces some UI changes to Push 2. It is possible to force the use of the remote script by adding the option -Push2UseLegacyScript to Live's Options.txt file.\n\nChanging probability values of grouped notes from Push 2 will affect all notes in that group and the grouped value in Live.\n\nAdded tuning system support for Push 1. When a tuning system is active, the note layout is adjusted accordingly. In this mode, the additional scale controls are disabled and only a Layout option is available in the Scales menu.\n\nPush 3\n\nThe Load Previous and Load Next actions are now assigned to the lower display buttons instead of the upper display buttons.\n\nThe Preview button and text now change color depending on whether Preview is active or not.\n\nPush 3 supports the newly introduced tuning systems. When a tuning system is loaded in Live, Push’s pads and interface will update to reflect the change:\n\nWhen using no tuning system or a tuning system with twelve notes with identical intervals between adjacent notes (equal temperament), the full Scales menu is available.\n\nWhen using a tuning system with twelve notes with differing intervals between adjacent notes (non-equal temperament), the root note selector is not available in the Scales menu.\n\nWhen using a tuning system that is not built with twelve notes, the Scales menu is displayed in the same way as before for all tuning systems: with one list for configuring the interval between rows in semitones.\n\nThe Layout control has more options to help suit the different needs of different systems. Adjust this control to change the number of semitones each row is offset from the one below it. For example, if\n\nLayout is set to 5st the first pad will be pitch 1, then the pad above it will be pitch 6, and the pad above that will be pitch 11, and so on.\n\nIn Melodic mode, Push's pads will display the root note of the system in the track color, and all other notes of the system in white.\n\nThe sequencers update to indicate the correct pitches in the normal levels of white.\n\nNote names in Push’s Clip View will be updated to reflect whatever notes are used in a loaded tuning system.\n\nWhen Push 3 is set to MPE Expression Mode and Note Pitch Bend is set to Automatic, pitch bend will be disabled if a tuning system is enabled in Live.\n\nNew parameter banks for the Live 12 devices Meld, Roar, and CC Control have been added to Push 3 and 2.\n\nThe Random and Arpeggiator device parameter banks have been updated.\n\nThe Scale parameter in the Random device has been renamed to Interval to match the updated device UI.\n\nUpdated parameter banks for the Scale and Chord MIDI effects.\n\nSession View\n\nChanged the behavior of moving clips from Session View to Arrangement View:\n\nLooped clips taken from the same scene will be extended so that they span the same duration as the longest clip in the selection.\n\nClips taken from different scenes are ordered sequentially and clips taken from the same scene are aligned vertically so that they also play in the same order in Arrangement as in Session.\n\nWhen selecting a track header in Session View, the slot selection is no longer collapsed when the track has a selected slot. This keeps the highlighted track and the device chain in sync with the current clip shown in the Clip View.\n\nAdded a [CTRL][Enter] (Win) / [CMD][Enter] (Mac) keyboard shortcut for triggering the Clip Stop button for all tracks with selected slots. The button will be highlighted when the shortcut is used.\n\nSetup\n\nA Keep Monitoring Latency in Recorded Audio option has been added to the [right-click](Win) / [CTRL-click](Mac) context menu of the Monitor radio buttons for each track. This option is enabled by default, but when unchecked, recordings will have the same latency as if recorded with monitoring set to Off, regardless of which monitoring mode is selected.\n\nLive can now import and export audio files greater than 4 GB (such as .bwf and .rf64 files) by using the ITU Broadcast Wave file format. Please note, however, that Live does not support Sony Digital Pictures Wave64 files, which have the extension .w64.\n\nWhen clicking a link to ableton.com from Live, the website now loads in the language set in Live’s Preferences. Previously, the website’s language was based on the web browser’s settings.\n\nTempo Follower\n\nWhen deleting a track containing a clip whose tempo is being followed, the tempo automation is also deleted."
