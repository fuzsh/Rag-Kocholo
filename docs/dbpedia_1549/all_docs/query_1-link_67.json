This research project will develop a new method, based on machine learning, to design modulators of neuronal voltage-gated ion channels, with the aim of treating such diseases.\n\nProject title: From atom to organism: Bridging the scales in the design of ion channel drugs\n\nPrincipal investigator: Lucie Delemotte, Associate Professor in Biophysics\n\nGrant amount: SEK 27 million over five years (2023–2027)\n\nRead more about Lucie Delemotte's research (in Swedish)\n\nPhoto: Jann Lipka\n\nWith a sufficiently strong laser or light pulse, it is possible to temporarily completely change the properties of a material. If we can understand this transformation on a microscopic, quantum mechanical level, it opens up new types of information technology that will also be very energy efficient.\n\nProject title: Light-matter interaction in the ultrafast regime\n\nPrincipal investigator: Anna Delin, professor of materials and nanophysics\n\nGrant amount: SEK 25 million over five years (2023–2027)\n\nRead more about Anna Delin's research (in Swedish)\n\nPhoto: Magnus Bergström / Wallenberg Foundations\n\nIn recent years cancer care has added a new weapon to its arsenal: immunotherapy. Research is now making major strides with the help of microchip-based methods developed in Sweden. The aim is to treat more forms of cancer, and cure more patients.\n\nProject title: Translating mechanisms of cytotoxicity in natural killer cells and gamma-delta T cells into next generation cell-based cancer immunotherapy\n\nPrincipal investigator: Björn Önfelt, Professor of Applied Physics\n\nGrant amount: SEK 31.2 million over five years (2019–2023)\n\nRead more about Björn Önfelt's research\n\nPhoto: Magnus Bergström / Wallenberg Foundations\n\nOscar Tjernberg has taken on one of the major unresolved questions in the field of condensed matter physics: how do high temperature superconductors work? The researchers are using high-energy light pulses to push different materials beyond the limit so they become superconducting or topological. The process is also recorded using a technique in which Tjernberg’s research team are world leaders.\n\nProject title: Novel Transient States in Quantum Matter\n\nPrincipal investigator: Oscar Tjernberg, Professor of Strongly Correlated Systems\n\nGrant amount: SEK 30 million over five years (2019–2023)\n\nRead more about Oscar Tjernberg's research\n\nPhoto: Magnus Bergström / Wallenberg Foundations\n\nTechnology and methods to measure individual photons – light particles – are being developed in Val Zwiller’s laboratory. The researchers have devised a quantum sensor capable of securing the internet of the future against eavesdropping, as well as measuring interactions between molecules.\n\nProject title: Quantum sensors\n\nGrant amount: SEK 34.8 million over five years (2018–2022)\n\nPrincipal investigator: Val Zwiller, Professor of Applied Physics\n\nRead more About Val Zwiller's research\n\nPhoto: Magnus Bergström / Wallenberg Foundations\n\nFor all of its benefit to society, the technology we use for medical imaging is nevertheless flawed. Relevant little details go undetected due to limitations in resolution. But a recent investment in research at KTH aims to improve the picture – by at least 10 times. One hope is that the new method will make it easier to locate and diagnose tumors at an early stage.\n\nProject title: Molecular X-Ray Micro Imaging\n\nPrincipal investigator: Hans Hertz, Professor of Biomedical Physics\n\nGrant amount: SEK 33 million over five years (2017–2021)\n\nRead more about Hans Hertz's research\n\nPhoto: Magnus Bergström / Wallenberg Foundations\n\nCan a problem be solved well enough within a reasonable time – or is it impossible because it demands excessive computational resources? These are questions being examined in a research project at KTH Royal Institute of Technology, where basic mathematical research may yield results with major implications.\n\nProject title: Approximability and proof complexity\n\nPrincipal investigator: Johan Håstad, Professor of Computer Science\n\nGrant amount: SEK 32.2 million over five years (2017–2021)\n\nRead more about Johan Håstad's research\n\nPhoto: Magnus Bergström / Wallenberg Foundations\n\nTiny optical fibers may help to make future cancer diagnosis and treatment more effective. This is the hope of researchers in a project on multifunctional fibers. Among other things, the team is examining how fiber optics can be used for medical purposes inside the body.\n\nProject title: Multifunctional fiber optics\n\nPrincipal investigator: Fredrik Laurell, Professor of Laser Physics\n\nGrant amount: SEK 31.8 million over five years (2017–2021)\n\nRead more about Fredrik Laurell's research"
