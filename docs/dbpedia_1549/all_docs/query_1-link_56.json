        "text": "Lotte Reiniger made over sixty films, of which eleven are considered lost and fifty to have survived. Of the surviving films for which she had full artistic responsibility, eleven were created in the silent period if the three-part Doktor Dolittle (1927-1928) is considered a single film. Reiniger is known to have worked on—or contributed silhouette sequences to—at least another seven films in the silent era, and a further nine in the sound era. Additionally, there is evidence of her involvement in a number of film projects that remained at conceptual or pre-production stages.\n\nReiniger is best known for her pioneering silhouette films, in which paper and cardboard cut-out figures, weighted with lead, and hinged at the joints—the more complex the characters’ narrative role, the larger their range of movements, and therefore, the more hinges for the body—were hand-manipulated from frame to frame and shot via stop motion photography. The figures were placed on an animation table and usually lit from below. In some of her later sound films the figures were lit both from above and below, depending on the desired visual effect. Framed with elaborate backgrounds made from varying layers of translucent paper or colorful acetate foils for color films, Reiniger’s characters were created and animated with exceptional skill and precision.\n\nReiniger’s early films ranged in length from brief shorts of less than 300 feet to Die Abenteuer des Prinzen Achmed/The Adventures of Prince Achmed (1923-1926), a film that is arguably the first full-length animated feature and is thus considered to be among the milestones of cinema history. Reiniger wrote the screenplays for her films and worked as a major contributor on a number of live action films, for example, as assistant director on films made by her husband Carl Koch. These included the wartime Italian productions Tosca (1940-1941) and La Signora dell’Ovest/The Lady of the West (1941-1942). Among her earliest involvement in motion pictures was her production of decorative silhouettes for the titles of feature films directed by Paul Wegener and Rochus Gliese: Rübezahl’s Hochzeit/Rübezahl’s Marriage (1916), Der Rattenfänger von Hameln/The Pied Piper of Hamlyn (1918), and Apokalypse/Apocalypse (1918). She also made animated silhouette sequences as well as shadow play sequences included in Die Schöne Prinzessin von China/The Beautiful Princess of China (1917) and Der Verlorene Schatten/The Lost Shadow (1920).\n\nIn addition to producing silhouette animation films, Reiniger was equally engaged by live shadow puppetry, which was at times recorded on film and used in live-action films. For example, in 1933, Reiniger made a shadow play sequence for G.W. Pabst’s Don Quixote (1933). In 1937 she created “Le Pont Cassé,” which translates to “the Broken Bridge,” a short shadow play sequence filmed for Jean Renoir’s La Marseillaise (1938). This famed shadow play was the most popular piece by François Dominique Séraphin, founder of the Theatre Séraphin in Versailles in 1770. Reiniger’s filmed play emulated Séraphin’s style and was thus an homage to the roots of European shadow play.\n\nThe German Years\n\nBefore she left Nazi Germany and moved to England in November 1935, Reiniger had been deeply immersed in the cultural and intellectual avant-garde world of pre-World War II Berlin. Among her circle of friends in 1920s Berlin were such well-known artists as Walther Ruttmann, who contributed to Die Abenteuer des Prinzen Achmed, and playwright Bertolt Brecht. The earliest films that Reiniger realized with full creative freedom and responsibility were produced by the Institut für Kulturforschung [Institute for Cultural Research] in Berlin. These early films include Das Ornament des Verliebten Herzens/The Ornament of Hearts in Love (1919), Amor und das Standhafte Liebespaar/Love and the Steadfast Lovers (1920), Der Fliegende Koffer/The Flying Suitcase (1921), and Der Stern von Bethlehem/The Star of Bethlehem (1921). Established in 1919 by Hans Cürlis as a production enterprise for educational films, the Institute was also a testing ground for experimental animation. At the Institute, which was equally committed to film as an art form and as a highly effective means of communication and education, Reiniger worked with a number of other prominent young intellectuals. Among them was Berthold Bartosch, a collaborator on many of her films during the 1920s and, most importantly, Reiniger’s soon-to-be-husband, Koch. At the time, he was making educational films and documentaries for the Institute. Koch was interested in the technical aspects of filmmaking, specifically experiments with methods of animation. This made him an ideal collaborator on Reiniger’s films on which he was both camera operator and fellow animator.\n\nThe short silhouette animation films were received with critical acclaim and lauded as art, yet financing such film productions proved difficult throughout Reiniger’s life. Reiniger and Koch thus supplemented their income with work for Julius Pinschewer, an early producer of advertising films. Two of possibly four animated silhouette advertisements by Reiniger are known to survive: Das Geheimnis der Marquise/The Marquise’s Secret (1922), which promoted Nivea skin care products, and Barcarole (1924) for Mauxion’s chocolate desserts. From 1923 into the early sound era, Reiniger’s most significant works were produced by Comenius-Film, a company financed by friend and patron Louis Hagen Sr. and managed by Koch. Following Die Abenteuer des Prinzen Achmed, Comenius-Film produced four more Reiniger films: The three-part Doktor Dolittle series, based on Hugh Lofting’s stories, and Die Jagd nach dem Glück/The Hunt for Luck (1930), a live-action feature co-directed by Reiniger, Koch, and Gliese with Renoir and Catherine Hessling in major parts. Although initially produced as a silent film, The Hunt for Luck was released in May 1930 with a soundtrack produced in post-synch. Today, however, only the silhouette animation sequence survives.\n\nIn 1926 Reiniger traveled to Egypt and then to Greece in 1936. While traveling, she studied the shadow play as well as the tradition of silhouette representation of the human figure. The popular Greek puppet show tradition of Karagiozis became a significant influence on Reininger’s work, supplementing her knowledge of ancient Eastern and Oriental performance traditions. Reiniger’s notes, screenplays, storyboards, and in particular her music and opera films, testify to the role that classical music especially played in the conception of her films from the silent era onwards. Classical music dictated the movements of the shadow figures, and she used the music of Mozart, Bizet, and Offenbach, but also collaborated with contemporaries such as Wolfgang Zeller, Paul Dessau, and Benjamin Britten, as well as her friends Eric Walter White and Peter Gellhorn.\n\nBeyond the cinema, Reiniger designed costumes and sets for theatre and opera, staged puppet shows and shadow plays, and illustrated books, newspapers, and magazines. The study of the documents that Reininger left behind indicates that she was an accomplished artist working in ink as well as watercolor, as well as a writer and a poet. In addition, she occasionally gave public lectures on the animation process and experimental film history. Reiniger’s breadth as a multi-talented artist and filmmaker is apparent in the archival material: doodles, notes, letters, diaries, sketches, water colors, scripts, storyboards, silhouettes, as well as the finished films are evidence of the care given each stage of the film production as an art form.\n\nThat her contributions to film history are not better known is perhaps attributable to her choice of subject matter: the majority of her silhouette films are based on fairy tales, fables, or ancient myths. Contrary to generally held beliefs, however, the treatment of the material is more suited to adult than to child audiences. Further, finding the target audience for her music films proved difficult. Immediately embarking on the production of music films such as Zehn Minuten Mozart/Ten Minute Mozart (1930) with the advent of sound, she realized something quite new—highly condensed, parody films of well-known operas like Carmen (1933) and Papageno (1935), films that are most appealing to an audience familiar with those operas. And yet, because of their ironic approach to the source material, and perhaps due to the use of film, as opposed to opera itself, they did not appeal sufficiently to these audiences to succeed in the German market and her productions struggled to find distribution. Additionally, the subjects chosen for her filmmaking—and also her choice of friends and artistic collaborators—did not meet the criteria set forth by film politics in Nazi Germany.\n\nThe Years in Britain and Europe\n\nWith the outset of war, on September 1, 1939, Reiniger left for Italy to rejoin her husband who had moved with Renoir to Rome in August for work on Tosca. Soon, without Renoir, Koch and Reiniger worked jointly on two live-action features, the opera-themed Tosca, which premiered in January 1941, and then the western La Signora dell’ Ovest. Before the end of 1939, Lotte had already completed her only Italian solo short, a film of Donizetti’s opera “L’Elisir d’Amore.” All three Italian film works were commissioned productions of Scalera Film S.p.a., Rome. In September 1943, on account of the worsening war-time situation in Italy—which had declared war on Germany on October 13, 1943—Reiniger and Koch were advised by the embassy to leave without delay. On September 22, 1943, they moved from Rome to Venice, and on Christmas 1943 they headed back towards Berlin, not least because Reiniger’s mother was there, in ill-health and alone. Surprisingly, back in the capital, Reiniger succeeded in receiving a film commission, and the rather prolonged production of Die Goldene Gans (1944-1947) secured their daily bread. In 1948 she left Germany permanently, and in 1961 she and Koch became British citizens. Since the 1970s Reiniger’s work has received limited but constant attention via festivals and specialized cinema programming, facilitating re-discovery by the film history community. Nevertheless, attention has been focused on the films produced and re-released by the British Primrose Productions in the 1950s. Most prominent among Reiniger’s now widely known films are fairy tales from the silent era, music films from the first half of the 1930s, and the popular series of twelve children’s fairy tale films produced in England in 1953 and 1954.\n\nThe limited number of films available on 35mm or 16mm prints has also resulted in an underestimation of the range of Reiniger’s work, and those made just prior to, during, and after World War II have hitherto remained almost unseen. For example, the information films she made on commission for the General Post Office and Crown Film Unit are not known outside of Britain. The multinational scope of her work, thus its ostensible lack of cohesion, and the spread of Reininger’s work across archives in Germany, England, Italy, France, and Canada is partly responsible for the incomplete retrospective reception and the paucity of scholarship. In a similar vein, many of her black and white works are widely seen and applauded while her equally impressive work in color made in Britain is ignored, forgotten, or lost. Fortunately, there is an abundance of readily available historical material, on paper and film, awaiting research.\n\nClose examination of individual films is highly rewarding: Reiniger’s productions of all genres—fairy tales, opera parodies, advertisements—are exciting and strange films, filled with contradictions, satirical commentary, and often, strong erotic undertones. For example, in Der Kleine Schornsteinfeger/The Little Chimney Sweep (1934), Belinda, the young, pretty protagonist is abducted by a Mohock, or “gangster,” after the two have watched a passionate erotic stage play. The version re-released by Primrose in 1953/1954 was shortened, stripped of its original soundtrack as well as the two erotically charged “seduction scenes”—a theater performance and an aria sung by the gangster—in order to accommodate the targeted child audience and television time slot. A wealth of unexamined material, including personal letters, diaries, as well as sketches, screenplays, notes, drawings, and storyboards, sometimes set to music, await examination in the Lotte Reiniger Estate Collection in the Stadtmuseum Tübingen [City Museum of Tübingen]. Likewise, the surviving production records in the National Archives in Kensington, which trace the production history of films made on commission for the British government, offer a starting point for future research."
