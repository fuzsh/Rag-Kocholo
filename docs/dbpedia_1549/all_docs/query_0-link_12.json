        "text": "RTX AI PCs are delivering big innovations in gaming, content creation, and more at Computex 2024. Below, you can check out a summary of our GeForce announcements, including new AI advancements, new SFF-Ready guidelines for enthusiast GPUs and cases, and new RTX upgrades for Star WarsTM Outlaws and Marvel Rivals.\n\nAdditionally, we’re announcing the June 4th launch of a new NVIDIA app beta update, and a new GeForce Reward, which will net you 3 months of free PC Game Pass access. And there’s news about new G-SYNC Compatible displays and an upcoming RTX Remix update.\n\nFor all of NVIDIA’s other Computex 2024 news, head to the NVIDIA Blog.\n\nProject G-Assist takes voice or text inputs from the player, along with a snapshot of what’s in the game window. The snapshot is fed into AI vision models that provide context awareness and app-specific understanding for the Large Language Model (LLM), which is connected to a database of game knowledge such as a wiki. The output of the LLM is an insightful and personalized response—either text, or speech from the AI —based on what’s happening in-game.\n\nNVIDIA partnered with Studio Wildcard to demo the technology with ARK: Survival Ascended. Project G-Assist can help answer questions about creatures, quests, items, lore, difficult to tackle bosses and more. And because Project G-Assist is context-aware, it personalizes its responses to the user’s playthrough.\n\nAdditionally, Project G-Assist can evaluate your system’s configuration and performance, and instantly tune it for an optimal experience. Apply NVIDIA app’s optimized game settings, based on extensive testing on thousands of hardware configurations; enable Performance Tuning to apply a safe GPU overclock; switch on NVIDIA Reflex to reduce system latency for more responsive gaming; plus so much more.\n\nWe envision AI assistants transforming the way we engage with our favorite games and apps. Imagine getting instant context-aware assistance with a complex creative workflow in a photo or video app. Or an AI coach analyzing your multiplayer replays, teaching you strategies to move up the ranks in competitive matches. Project G-Assist is a glimpse into that future.\n\nProject G-Assist won’t play a game for you like we suggested in our prophetic 2017 April Fool’s video, but it can help you get more out of your favorite games, and find help for a troublesome boss. Takeout ordering, however… we could definitely add that to the roadmap.\n\nFor further details, check out our dedicated Project G-Assist article.\n\nNVIDIA today announced the general availability of NVIDIA ACE generative AI microservices in the cloud to accelerate the next wave of digital humans. Developers in customer service, gaming and healthcare are the first to adopt ACE technologies to simplify creating, animating and operating lifelike digital humans.\n\nIn addition, NVIDIA ACE technology is now coming to RTX AI PCs and workstations with ACE PC NIM microservices. ACE NIMs will deliver high-quality inference running locally on RTX GPUs for natural language understanding, speech, and facial animation.\n\nAt Computex, the gaming debut of NVIDIA ACE NIM on the PC will be featured in the latest Covert Protocol tech demo, developed in collaboration with Inworld AI. It now showcases NVIDIA Audio2Face and NVIDIA Riva automatic speech recognition running locally on RTX devices.\n\nFor more information, check out our ACE press release.\n\nSmall Form Factor (SFF) PCs pack powerful components into stylish cases that can be displayed on your desk, carried to LAN parties, tucked away in tight spaces, and slotted into media centers. Once a niche format supported by only a few boutique builders, SFF is now part of many top case manufacturers’ line-ups.\n\nComponent compatibility remains a challenge, however, requiring prospective buyers to dive into specification sheets and ask other enthusiasts whether there’s available space and clearance for parts, cables and assembly. GeForce RTX graphics cards come in all shapes and sizes, and though partners’ pages list product dimensions, clearances for power cables and connectors generally aren’t referenced, necessitating guess work and further research to ensure the graphics card is SFF-suitable.\n\nWe’re working in partnership with graphics card and case manufacturers to make component choice simpler by introducing a new SFF-Ready guideline for GeForce RTX enthusiast graphics cards and cases. This new guideline will instantly tell you whether a graphics card fits in a SFF case.\n\nUsing AV1, there are fewer blocky artifacts, color banding is reduced, and significantly more detail is preserved in fast motion scenes, better demonstrating the fidelity of Horizon Forbidden West™ Complete Edition with maxed out PC settings and DLSS 3 Frame Generation\n\nWhether you're a gaming enthusiast or a content creator, the NVIDIA app simplifies the process of keeping your PC updated with the latest NVIDIA Game Ready and Studio drivers, and enables quick discovery and installation of NVIDIA applications like GeForce NOW, NVIDIA Broadcast and NVIDIA Omniverse.\n\nFeaturing a unified GPU control center, NVIDIA app allows fine-tuning of game and driver settings from a single place, while introducing a redesigned in-game overlay for convenient access to powerful gameplay recording tools, performance monitoring overlays, automatic SDR to HDR conversion in games, and game enhancing filters, including innovative new AI-powered filters for GeForce RTX users.\n\nFor further details about the new NVIDIA app enhancements, and what’s next for our new app, read our dedicated NVIDIA app beta update article.\n\nIf you’ve never tried PC Game Pass, now’s the perfect time! We’ve partnered with Xbox to give GeForce gamers 3 months of access to PC Game Pass for free, starting June 4th! Valid for new Xbox Game Pass members only. PC Game Pass has high quality, day-one games available to download and play, including numerous titles enhanced with NVIDIA DLSS, NVIDIA Reflex, and ray-traced effects.\n\nTake to the track in Forza Horizon 5 or Forza Motorsport, which both include ray tracing and DLSS, giving GeForce RTX gamers the definitive race-day experience. Or get crafty and build your own world in the fully ray-traced Minecraft with RTX. There are tons of games to choose from!\n\nIf you’re away from home, or your PC isn’t up to the task of rendering high fidelity games at high frame rates, you can play over 130 PC Game Pass titles on GeForce NOW. Simply stream the ever growing list of supported PC Game Pass titles from a GeForce RTX PC gaming rig in the cloud, and also play the games you already own from the Microsoft Store, Battle.net, Steam, Epic Games Store, Ubisoft Connect, and GOG.com.\n\nPlay on iPhone, iPad, Android devices, web browsers, select LG and Samsung smart TVs, Macs, Chromebooks, and many other commonly owned gadgets, with controllers and PC accessories, and on suitable devices you can even broadcast gameplay to a TV for a big-screen experience.\n\nAnd with a GeForce NOW Ultimate subscription, all RTX games streamed from the cloud can be experienced with the same technologies present when gaming on GeForce RTX 40 Series PC or laptop, including DLSS 3, Reflex and ray tracing, at up to 4K 120 FPS or up to 240 FPS. Don’t miss out on your daily dose of gaming - play with GeForce NOW at any time, anywhere you have a fast Internet connection.\n\nLearn how to claim our newest GeForce Reward here.\n\nNVIDIA RTX Remix empowers modders to remaster classic DirectX 8 and DirectX 9 games with full ray tracing, DLSS 3.5, highly detailed assets, and physically accurate materials. Built on NVIDIA Omniverse, RTX Remix consists of a Runtime that renders games with path tracing and DLSS 3.5 and a toolkit app that facilitates the modding of game assets and materials.\n\nSince RTX Remix Toolkit launched earlier this year, 20,000 modders have experimented with using it to mod classic games, resulting in over 100 RTX remasters in development on the RTX Remix Showcase Discord.\n\nLast year, NVIDIA made RTX Remix Runtime open source, allowing modders to expand game compatibility and advance rendering capabilities. This month, NVIDIA will make the RTX Remix Toolkit open source, allowing modders to streamline how assets are replaced and scenes are relit, increase supported file formats for RTX Remix’s asset ingestor, and bolster RTX Remix’s AI Texture Tools with new models.\n\nMicrosoft and NVIDIA are collaborating to help developers bring new generative AI capabilities to their Windows native and web apps. This collaboration will provide application developers with easy application programming interface (API) access to GPU accelerated small language models (SLMs) that enable retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) capabilities that run on-device as part of Windows Copilot Runtime.\n\nSLMs provide tremendous possibilities for Windows developers including content summarization, content generation, and task automation. RAG capabilities augment SLMs by giving the AI model access to domain-specific information not well represented in the base models. RAG APIs enable developers to harness application-specific data sources and tune SLM behavior and capabilities to application needs.\n\nThese AI capabilities will be accelerated by NVIDIA RTX GPUs, as well as AI accelerators from other hardware vendors, providing end users with fast, responsive AI experiences across the breadth of the Windows ecosystem.\n\nThe API will be released in developer preview later this year."
