        "text": "The project “MaExchange” by the student initiative Infinity Mannheim e.V. has won the Sustainable Impact Contest 2023 of the Business School. The initiative advocates for sustainable solutions and offers exchange students a financially affordable and resource-saving alternative to purchasing household items during their stay in Mannheim.\n\nMaExchange allows incoming students to register at the beginning of each semester to borrow household and everyday items, primarily kitchen utensils. These can be borrowed for a deposit amount for the duration of the stay and returned at the end of the semester. The project also accepts donations in kind from students leaving Mannheim, allowing the items to be reused. In this way, MaExchange provides an alternative to the conventional “buy and waste” approach and helps to promote the local circular economy.\n\nThe MaExchange project prevailed in the final of the Sustainable Impact Contest against the projects “Sonnenkinder” and “Stifte Hoffnung”. The winners were selected by a jury consisting of Joachim Lutz, Dean of the Business School of the University of Mannheim, Bettina Meltzer, Marketing, Communications & Diversity Manager at Mannheim Business School and Prof. Dr. Moritz Fleischmann, Vice Rector for Sustainability and Information Provision at the University of Mannheim. In addition, the projects were able to collect points in an Instagram vote. The jury agreed that the project was action-oriented in both supporting students and contributing to a sustainable circular economy.\n\n“Müttersprache” offers language courses and simultaneous childcare for refugee women in Mannheim. For many fugitive mothers it is difficult if not impossible to attend an all-day language course as they ask themselves: who will be taking care of our children during this time? Anne-Sophie Waag and Sandra Haldimann recognized this problem and thus founded their association “Müttersprache” by offering those women an easily accessible first point of contact for learning the German language. Parallely to the language courses, which are being offered twice a week, the children of the women are being taken care of. The language courses as well as the child care offers are being mainly carried out by students of the University of Mannheim.\n\nIn its first year, the Social Project Contest supported the student project “Macup”. The students of the three initatives involved wanted to reduce the waste created by to-go coffee cups on campus by providing a more sustainable alterantive. The project therefore aimed to establish a deposit system with reusable cups at the University of Mannheim. With the financial support of the Social Project Contest, the students were able to produce a prototype, designed by the Mannheim artist Nick Lobo, which since then is available at the campus shop."
