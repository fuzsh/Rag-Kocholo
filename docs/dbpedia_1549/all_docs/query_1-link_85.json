        "text": "I am still blown away by this award! I would like to thank the team around Stefan Dinnendahl and Markus Luthe for the preparation and organisation. I am a #fan of both of them, and therefore expressly endorse the words of Max C. Luscher MRICS, when he formulated the association work of the Hotelverband Deutschland (IHA) with the following words (thought quote) #Membership in an association often offers great #synergy effects. Working together strengthens the entire #tourism industry and pursues a common #goal. This brings economic #benefits to all members. Individual businesses with small economic voices become a #large group. Thanks to its economic strength and the jobs it creates, this group gains #political weight. This applies not only to lobbying, but also to many other areas. For me, there are also other factors. Firstly, #solidarity among #hoteliers, which is not only a moral imperative. It is also an intrinsic interest of communities in a free society and of market participants in a market. Second, #influence. Influence comes to those who have many behind them, who can argue their case properly and convince others. #Co-organisation, because this means that members have the opportunity to contribute their opinions and #ideas to the work of the association through the election of the board and participation in IHA and HOTREC - Hotels, Restaurants & Cafés in Europe committees and events. And finally, #communication, which provides a better understanding of the market and insight into issues that might otherwise go unnoticed. Great, more of that please, dear Otto Lindner.

In the Middle Ages, the most populous and influential cities in Germany were mainly the free and imperial cities, such as Cologne, Nuremberg, Augsburg, Lübeck, and Strasbourg. In the early modern period, the Thirty Years’ War (1618-1648) devastated many cities and reduced their population and importance. The rise of Prussia and the Habsburg Empire also shifted the political and economic power to their capitals, Berlin and Vienna, respectively. In the 19th century, the Industrial Revolution and the unification of Germany in 1871 led to a rapid urbanization and growth of many cities, especially in the Ruhr area, such as Essen, Dortmund, and Duisburg, as well as in other regions, such as Hamburg, Munich, and Stuttgart. In the 20th century, the two world wars and the division of Germany had a profound impact on the urban landscape. Many cities were heavily bombed and destroyed, and some were divided by the Iron Curtain, such as Berlin and Frankfurt. After the war, the reconstruction and the economic miracle (Wirtschaftswunder) restored and modernized many cities, especially in West Germany. The reunification of Germany in 1990 also brought new opportunities and challenges for urban development. I'd like to hear what you observed in this timeline and feel free to share your feedback/suggestions for the next one. #urbanism #history #Germany"
