        "text": "Industrial Carbon Capture and Storage (ICCS) Archer Daniels Midland Corporation IL FE0001547 Recovery Act: CO2 Capture from Biofuels Production and Sequestration into the Mt. Simon Sandstone Reservoir 11/16/2009 09/30/2022\n\nThe objective of this project is to demonstrate an integrated system of industrial CO2 capture and geological storage in a deep sandstone formation. The project uses CO2 produced by ADM as a by-product of the production of fuel-grade ethanol. ADM has been capturing CO2 using dehydration and compression and sequestering it in the Mt. Simon Sandstone formation (saline reservoir). The ethanol plant and the sequestration site are both located in Decatur, Illinois. The project team members include ADM, Illinois State Geological Survey, Schlumberger Carbon Services, and Richland Community College.\n\nThis is the first geologic storage project to operate with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Class VI injection well permit. This project is demonstrating cutting-edge technologies for intelligent monitoring in the deep verification well (i.e., Schlumberger's IntelliZone compact modular multi-zonal management system-first installation in North America), a downhole seismic monitoring system (i.e., Sercel SlimWave acquisition unit with WAVELAB surface control) in the geophysical well, and Schlumberger's WellWatcher monitoring system that integrates advanced downhole measurement technology with surface acquisition and data communication systems.\n\nPlant Optimization Technologies / High Performance Materials Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) WA FWP-60098 Low Cost Fabrication of ODS Materials 10/01/2010 09/30/2023 The objective of this project is to develop a low-cost method for producing high strength, creep resistant oxide dispersion strengthened (ODS) ferritic steel mill product for high-temperature applications. This project will test a new one step friction stir processing based powder metallurgy process to produce ODS alloys. Coal Utilization Science / Simulation-Based Engineering Ames National Laboratory IA FWP-AL-14-330-058 Kinetic Theory Modeling of Turbulent Multiphase Flow 10/01/2013 09/30/2017 The work carried out under this Field Work Proposal (FWP) will contribute directly to improving the continuum computational models used by the gasification group at the National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) for system design and analysis. The modeling capabilities will be extended to handle variable-density and variable-size reacting particles in turbulent flow using state-of-the-art mathematical modeling tools. Plant Optimization Technologies / High Performance Materials Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) WA FWP-66059 Solid State Joining of Creep Enhanced Ferritic Steels 10/01/2014 09/30/2023 The goal of this project is to develop an alternative solid state joining technology, Friction Stir Welding (FSW), which can enable higher performance from Creep Strength Enhanced Ferritic (CSEF) steels, anticipated to be used in advanced ultrasupercritical (AUSC) coal-fired power plants. A primary problem in the high temperature application of welded CSEF steels is that the welds of these steels fail (Type IV cracking) at a creep life far below that of the base metal. This has led to a reduced performance - either a reduced calculation of strength and lifetime for assemblies made from these alloys, or the use of expensive post weld heat treatment procedures to recover base metal creep strength in the weldment. Previous work at PNNL on the NETL funded project. Joining of Advanced High-Temperature Materials, showed that a new joining process, FSW, has the ability to produce welds in Grade 91M CSEF plate that have significantly improved creep performance over equivalent fusion welds. Post-Combustion Capture / Solvents Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) WA FWP-65872 Accelerating the Development of \"Transformational\" Solvents for CO2 Separations 04/01/2014 09/30/2017\n\nPacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) is further developing their transformational solvent-based system for carbon dioxide (CO2) capture from power plant flue gas. The process couples a non-aqueous, switchable organic solvent (CO2-binding organic liquids [CO2BOLs]) platform with a unique polarity-swing-assisted regeneration (PSAR). PNNL tested the CO2BOL/PSAR process at bench-scale in a previous U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) project (FE0007466) and found that the formulation of the CO2BOL showed promising gains in net power, but also showed capital cost impracticality due to high viscosity. The focus of this project is to optimize, synthesize, and characterize CO2BOL solvents to identify candidates with a CO2-loaded viscosity below 50 centipoises and a material cost no greater than $10 per kilogram. Data from the new solvent variants will also be used to develop an understanding of how molecular structure impacts viscosity in transformational solvent systems. Phase I of the project focuses on designing and predicting physical and thermodynamic properties of solvents. Promising candidates will be synthesized and characterized, and solvent properties will be compared with predicted molecular simulations; liquid phase structure property correlations will be made. Candidates meeting desired synthetic costs and viscosity targets will be synthesized and studied further. In Phase II, the focus is on physical and thermodynamic property measurements to validate property predictions. The data will be added to thermodynamic and process models to project process performance, notably energetics and costing.\n\nPost-Combustion Capture / Novel Concepts Southern Company Services, Inc. AL FE0022596 National Carbon Capture Center 06/06/2014 09/30/2025\n\nThe U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE) Office of Fossil Energy, National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) and Southern Company Services, Inc. will continue the operation and maintenance of existing test facilities at the National Carbon Capture Center (NCCC) to provide a platform for the evaluation of third-party technologies to reduce the cost of carbon dioxide (CO2) capture from coal- and natural gas-fired power plants and to advance CO2 utilization technologies and negative emissions technologies, such as direct air capture (DAC). The NCCC provides support in design, procurement, construction, installation, operation, data collection and analysis, and reporting in compliance with environmental and government regulations. The NCCC includes multiple, adaptable slipstream units that allow simultaneous testing of third-party laboratory-, bench-, and pilot-scale advanced CO2 capture technologies from diverse fuel sources at commercially relevant process conditions.\n\nMore than 110,000 hours of technology testing has been completed on more than 60 membrane, solvent, and sorbent technologies and their associated systems at the NCCC test site in Wilsonville, Alabama. The evaluation of advanced technologies, both domestic and international, helps to identify and resolve environmental, health and safety, operational, component, and system development issues, as well as to achieve scale-up and process enhancements in collaboration with the technology developers.\n\nAdvanced Turbines / Turbo-machinery for Supercritical CO2 Power Cycles General Electric (GE) Company NY FE0024007 Development of Low-Leakage Shaft End Seals for Utility-Scale Supercritical Carbon Dioxide (SCO2) Turbo Expanders 10/01/2014 12/23/2023\n\nGeneral Electric Company (GE), in partnership with Southwest Research Institute (SwRI), will develop expander shaft end seals for utility-scale supercritical CO2 (SCO2) power cycles. Phase I includes a conceptual design of a utility-scale end seal capable of meeting the component-level and system-level objectives. GE and SwRI will perform thermodynamic optimization and turbomachinery preliminary design to arrive at a conceptual layout for a utility-scale SCO2 power plant. GE will then develop face seals as a solution to the end shaft sealing needed for SCO2 turbo expanders. Finally, a conceptual design of a dedicated SCO2 facility at SwRI will be developed with sufficient fidelity to enable generation of a detailed Phase II cost and schedule proposal.\n\nReversible Solid Oxide Fuel Cells / Core Technology Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) TN FWP-FEAA121 Reliability of Materials and Components for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells 10/01/2014 12/31/2022\n\nThe emphasis of the applied research to be performed is on enhancing the reliability, robustness, and endurance of SOFC stacks to commercially-viable levels. Ultimately this research will assist SOFC manufacturers in the commercialization of SOFC-based stationary power generation systems that will maintain U.S. leadership in this technology field.\n\nSolid Oxide Fuel Cells / Core Technology Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) WA FWP-66841 SECA Core Technology Program - PNNL 10/01/2014 09/30/2021\n\nThere are two main thrusts to the PNNL FWP, materials development and modeling/simulation. Materials development tasks include evaluations of cathode materials, barrier layer densifiction, mitigation of chrome poisoning, contact material development, and interconnect development. Modeling/simulation tasks include the development of SOFC stack modeling tools such as stack degradation and reliability models to predict longer term performance of SOFCs and associated systems.\n\nFundamental Research U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) CO FE0022898 Alaska Natural Gas Hydrate Production Testing: Test Site Selection, Characterization and Testing Operation 09/01/2014 01/15/2021\n\nThis Interagency Agreement supports the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and its research partners in understanding, predicting, and testing the recoverability and potential production characteristics of onshore natural gas hydrate in the Greater Prudhoe Bay area on the Alaska North Slope (ANS: Prudhoe Bay, Kuparuk River, and Milne Point areas) or other areas deemed suitable by DOE and USGS for potential long-term production testing of gas hydrate. Researchers will accomplish these tasks by evaluating the occurrence and resource potential of the known gas hydrate accumulations in the Eileen trend. Geologic, geochemical, and geophysical (2-D and 3-D seismic surveys) data from northern Alaska and other data sources, including wireline and mud log surveys of wells of opportunity, will be used to assess the occurrence and nature of the known gas hydrate accumulations. The project involves two primary areas of effort: the geologic and engineering assessment of the Eileen gas-hydrate accumulation and support of DOE and its industry partners in evaluating, planning, and preparing for drilling and testing gas hydrate research wells in northern Alaska.\n\nGas Hydrates University of Texas at Austin TX FE0023919 Deepwater Methane Hydrate Characterization and Scientific Assessment 10/01/2014 09/30/2025\n\nThe primary project goal is to gain insight into the nature, formation, occurrence, and physical properties of methane hydrate-bearing sediments for methane hydrate resource appraisal through the planning and execution of drilling, coring, logging, testing, and analytical activities to assess the geologic occurrence, regional context, and characteristics of marine methane hydrate deposits in the Gulf of Mexico and/or other areas of the U.S. Outer Continental Shelf. Previous drilling in the Gulf of Mexico has verified the presence of methane hydrate filled sand reservoirs and have shown that such reservoirs can be identified by seismic analysis. However, conventional and pressurized cores of these reservoirs have not been collected, a number of critical in-situ measurements have not been recorded, and pressure perturbation experiments have not been performed. The project team will attempt to address these issues by planning and executing state-of-the-art deepwater methane hydrate drilling programs targeting methane hydrate reservoirs on the U.S. continental margin. For the research field programs (in Phase 2 and Phase 5), initial scientific analysis will begin onboard the drillship. Following the field programs, careful, detailed evaluation of collected core and data will be continued by research groups within the project team as well as through collaborating researchers across the world. A full detailed account of shipboard drilling and sampling activities, follow-on core / data analyses, and full scientific results will be developed and made publicly available.\n\nUnconventional Field Test Sites Gas Technology Institute (GTI) IL FE0024292 Hydraulic Fracturing Test Sites (HFTS) 10/01/2014 06/30/2023\n\nThis project is to conduct a field-based hydraulic fracturing research program for horizontal shale wells with the objectives of reducing and minimizing potential environmental impacts, demonstrating safe and reliable operations, and improving the efficiency of hydraulic fracturing. The research will advance our understanding of the hydraulic fracturing process in shale reservoirs, and thus, enable the design and execution of effective fracture stages that significantly contribute to production. Improved design and execution of fracture stages will also reduce the number of future infill wells drilled, and reduce water volume and energy input. A smaller environment footprint associated with shale drilling will be the result of this work.\n\nPhase 2: EOR was added to the project, where a series of cyclic gas injections will be performed to increase the oil recovery post initial hydraulic fracturing. The cyclic gas injection experiment will also be accompanied with state of the art diagnostics. Phase 2 will culminate with a core though well and production testing to quantify the production\n\nincrease of each gas injection.\n\nPhase 3: Legacy Well Recompletion – Infill Stimulation was added to the project to determine the effectiveness of infill stimulation (fracturing in between existing perforations) for increasing production and recovery rates from existing horizontal wells. Activities will include provision of a field test site containing existing producing wells which will be candidates for in-fill recompletion; drilling of a slant observation well at the test site, including the collection of whole cores, open and cased hole logs, installation of permanent fiber optic cables and discrete pressure gages; monitoring pre-re-stimulation depletion patterns; re-completion of an existing horizontal well using an expandable liner to seal off existing perforations allowing in-fill stimulation, assessment of legacy and in-fill stimulation effectiveness, time-lapse interference testing, assessment of existing and newly created fracture geometry using microseismic and fiber optic data such as DTS, DAS, and DSS, time lapse oil fingerprinting, and public outreach including immediate data dissemination.\n\nSandia National Laboratories (SNL) NM FWP-14-017626 Exploring Energy-Water Issues in the United States 10/01/2014 12/31/2017\n\nThe objective of the proposed work is to develop both data and models to help better understand the linkage between thermoelectric power generation and water. This effort will involve two broad areas of research, one involving the development of a water atlas and the second assesses the water use requirement of fossil-fueled electric power plants. The water atlas task will compile estimates of water availability, cost and projected future demand at the watershed level (8-digit Hydraulic Unit Code [HUC], which corresponds to roughly 2250 watersheds) for the lower 48 states of the U.S. Water availability and cost metrics will be developed for four sources of water including surface water, groundwater, municipal wastewater, and shallow brackish groundwater. The second task will enhance the analytical capabilities of the Integrated Environmental Control Model (IECM) to assess water use requirements of fossil-fueled electric power plants to consider a variety of alternative water treatment and cooling technologies and processes for carbon capture and storage.\n\nCoal Utilization Science / High Performance Materials Ames National Laboratory IA FWP-AL-14-450-012 Computational System Dynamics (Computational Design of Multiscale Systems) 10/01/2014 09/30/2018 NETL is partnering with Ames National Laboratory to develop computational algorithms, strategies, and informational framework needed to design materials in an integrated manner across length and time scales, creating the ability to design and tailor material properties for specific applications. The overall objective of the project is to provide a capability to assess degradation mechanisms and improve the reliability of refractory alloys for coal gasification and related processes. The project will investigate potential alloy formulations using progressively more accurate thermodynamic methods; conduct critical experiments to test the accuracy of the calculations; evaluate each alloy’s key mechanical, thermal, and oxidation properties; and screen alloys showing the greatest potential for high-performance thermochemical stability using state-of-the-art thermal analysis, high-temperature X-ray diffraction analysis, and microstructural evaluation with electron microscopy. Advanced Storage / Secure Storage (Migration Outside of Reservoir) Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) CA FWP-ESD14095 Core Carbon Storage and Monitoring Research 11/14/2014 09/30/2024\n\nThe Core Carbon Storage and Monitoring Research Program (CCSMR) aims to advance emergent monitoring technologies that can be used in commercial carbon storage projects. In FY17 our program is focused on highly leveraged international collaborations, where LBNL can apply emergent technologies in field monitoring to help accelerate the commercialization of carbon sequestration. The five scientific tasks include three international collaborations, the CO2CRC Otway Project, the PTRC Aquistore Project, and the CMC FRS program, which are continuations of prior research efforts. A new collaboration under the US DOE-Japan CCS Collaborative Framework is being initiated with the Japanese Research Institute for Technologies of Innovative Technology for the Earth (RITE). LBNL and RITE will use the CMC FRS for testing distributed fiber-optic strain monitoring technologies to observe geomechanical changes induced by CO2 sequestration. We will also be restarting the Mont Terri research that was previously funded in FY15 to investigate mechanisms governing induced seismicity. The primary technologies that we are focused on are those that can be transformative in continuous monitoring applications over long periods of time that can reduce monitoring costs and improve effectiveness. These include fiber-optic distributed acoustic, temperature, and strain sensing, along with well-based discrete sensing and sampling technologies.\n\nPost-Combustion Capture / Novel Concepts Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) CA FWP-FEW0194 Advanced Manufacturing to Enable Enhanced Processess and New Solvents for Carbon Capture 03/01/2015 04/30/2019\n\nLawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), Harvard University, and Carnegie Mellon University have teamed to develop processes that enhance and enable the use of advanced solvents to capture carbon dioxide (CO2) from power plants using advanced manufacturing techniques. New solvents for the capture of CO2 from coal-fired power plant flue gas pose challenges for conventional equipment due to slow kinetics, high viscosity, phase changes, corrosivity, or other issues. The team will develop processes to enhance and enable the use of these otherwise thermodynamically favorable solvents to capture CO2 using advanced manufacturing techniques to encapsulate the solvents in a permeable membrane to overcome these challenges. Candidate solvents include CO2-binding organic liquids developed by Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, ionic liquids, and nano-metal-organic hybrids. Using a combination of first-principles calculations, computational fluid dynamics models, and bench-scale experiments, the team will identify and assess improvements to the design of industrial CO2 absorbers made possible by advanced manufacturing. A range of novel concepts for improving the efficiency of gas-liquid exchange in industrial reactors will be explored. Process configurations for the microencapsulated CO2 sorbents (MECS) will be identified by evaluating fluidized bed and fixed bed configurations using a combination of bench-scale experiments, analytical models, and numerical models. The most promising basic configuration (fluidized bed, fixed bed, or other) will be selected for further refinement. The properties of potential solvents will be measured using LLNL's microfluidic technique for rapid characterization of solvent properties. The custom apparatus, developed previously with National Energy Technology Laboratory support, will be used to measure the CO2 absorption rate and capacity of candidate solvents. The apparatus will be extended with temperature controls to measure temperature-dependent capacity, allowing heats of reaction to be calculated, as well.\n\nMethane Hydrates U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) MA FE0023495 Natural Gas Hydrates in Permafrost and Marine Settings: Resources, Properties and Environmental Issues 05/15/2015 05/14/2020\n\nThe USGS Interagency Agreement (IA) involves laboratory research and international field studies in which DOE/NETL has a significant interest. Geological and geophysical support for these efforts is critical to their success, and the USGS is uniquely qualified to provide this support. This IA is currently divided into six separate tasks. The primary objective of several tasks is to evaluate the production potential of the known gas hydrate accumulations on the North Slope of Alaska and in the Gulf of Mexico. To serve climate and energy resource goals of the Methane Hydrates R&D program on the U.S. Atlantic margin, the USGS will conduct an evaluation of upper slope, climate-susceptible gas hydrates and collaborate with the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management and other partners on determining potential sites for a future gas hydrates research drilling program. In order to develop a better understanding of gas hydrates, the USGS is conducting laboratory research to measure the properties of sediments containing synthetic hydrates using a range of experimental methods. The USGS supports cooperative projects between the U.S. and international partners. The USGS is also studying the links between Late Pleistocene to contemporary climate change and the state of the gas hydrate reservoir on global upper continental slopes and Arctic shelves. Research under this objective will enhance understanding of the susceptibility of marine gas hydrates and gas hydrates associated with subsea permafrost to warming climate as manifested by warming ocean waters. Key goals are to determine the rate of upper slope gas hydrate degradation, which includes not only studying the contemporary record and modeling the future, but also constraining the timing of onset of methane emissions on upper slopes.\n\nPost-Combustion Capture / Novel Concepts University of North Dakota Energy and Environmental Research Center (UNDEERC) ND FE0024233 EERC - DOE Joint Program on Research and Development for Fossil Energy-Related Resources 06/01/2015 05/31/2025\n\nThe University of North Dakota Energy and Environmental Research Center (UNDEERC) will conduct complementary research and development (R&D) efforts under a Cooperative Agreement to advance and innovate science and energy technologies. Work will be performed in five topical areas of R&D: carbon storage; carbon capture; oil and gas; strategic studies; and support of U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Fossil Energy and Carbon Management’s (FECM) evolving mission. This program supports one of the three strategic goals to advance foundational science, innovate energy technologies, and inform data-driven policies that enhance U.S. economic growth and job creation, energy security, and environmental quality. The agreement builds on the proven approach and accomplishments of previous agreements between EERC and the National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) that have led to commercial demonstration and deployment of advanced technologies through jointly sponsored research on topics that would not be adequately addressed by the private sector alone.\n\nGeothermal University of Utah UT EE0007080 Enhanced Geothermal System Concept Testing and Development at the Milford City, Utah Frontier Observatory For Research In Geothermal Energy (Forge) Site 07/27/2015 07/26/2025\n\nThis Frontier Observatory for Research in Geothermal Energy (FORGE) project will establish a site to develop, test, and improve technologies and techniques for the creation of enhanced geothermal systems. In the first phase of the project, the University of Utah will develop a conceptual geologic model of the site and develop plans to carry out the full scope of the project. During the second phase of the project, permitting will be addressed and early field work will begin. The final phase of the project is dedicated to fully developing the field site, including the drilling and stimulation of multiple wells with the intent of creating a functioning geothermal system.\n\nStorage Infrastructure / Brine Extraction and Storage Test (BEST) Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) CA FE0026140 Phase II Field Demonstration at Plant Smith Generating Station Assessment of Opportunities for Optimal Reservoir Pressure Control, Plume Management and Produced Water Strategies 09/01/2015 05/31/2025\n\nManagement of fluid pressures is expected to be a key issue in the implementation of full-scale carbon dioxide (CO2) storage operations. Injection of CO2 into the storage reservoir causes fluid pressures to rise in the reservoir, potentially resulting in high rock stresses that can cause reactivation of faults or fracturing of caprock, thus losing its ability to contain the CO2. At some sites, extraction of saline groundwater from the storage reservoir may be required to maintain safe working pressures when CO2 is injected into the subsurface and to enhance CO2 storage capacity and injectivity. The brine from the formation will likely be produced in significant quantities and contain high concentrations of total dissolved solids. With treatment, this water could be desalinated and put to beneficial use at a power station for cooling or for other uses, thus reducing the risk associated with brine re-injection/disposal. The overall objective of this Brine Extraction Storage Test (BEST) project is to help develop cost-effective pressure control, plume management and produced water strategies that can be used to improve reservoir storage efficiency and capacity, and demonstrate safe, reliable containment of CO2 in deep geologic formations with CO2 permanence of 99% or better. In addition, operational experience gained from implementing the field demonstration at a power plant site will provide realistic and practical learnings that can be incorporated into future updates of the United States Department of Energy (DOE) best practice manuals related to Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS). In Phase I, the Recipient identified a preferred field site location, conducted life-cycle analyses for produced water extraction, treatment, transportation and residual waste disposal. Monitoring and injection/production strategies were developed for measuring and controlling the subsurface reservoir pressure and injection plume, and a series of work plans for field demonstrations of pressure management and treatment of extracted brines were prepared.\n\nStorage Infrastructure / Brine Extraction and Storage Test (BEST) University of North Dakota Energy and Environmental Research Center (UNDEERC) ND FE0026160 Developing and Validating Pressure Management and Plume Control Strategies in the Williston Basin Through a Brine Extraction and Storage Test (BEST) 09/01/2015 05/31/2024\n\nThe University of North Dakota Energy and Environmental Research Center (EERC) (Grand Forks, ND), GE Global Research, Computer Modeling Group, and Schlumberger Carbon Services worked together in Phase I of this project to create a technical design package for a brine extraction and storage test. The design focused on validating approaches for active reservoir management and extracted water treatment. Concurrent with site selection activities, viable pilot-ready water treatment technologies were screened for their potential to be deployed at the Phase II site. Surface facilities were designed for the selected site to be flexible and modular, able to accommodate most pilot-ready water treatment technologies.\n\nThis BEST (Brine Extraction Storage Test) project was one of two BEST projects selected (through a downselection process) to be continued into Phase II.\n\nIn Phase II, EERC is conducting a field validation test of the design developed in Phase I. The field validation effort be integrated with an operating commercial saltwater disposal facility located near Watford City, North Dakota. The objectives of the project are to confirm the efficacy of the active reservoir management (ARM) approaches developed during Phase I for managing formation pressure, predicting and monitoring differential pressure plume movement, and validating pressure and brine plume model predictions. The project will use engineered brine injection and extraction tests, monitoring and verification practices, and iterative simulation modeling to evaluate and understand the effect of various ARM strategies. The project will also implement and operate a test bed facility for the evaluation of selected brine treatment technologies for treating high total dissolved solids (TDS) extracted waters. Project activities will be conducted in three development stages over 48 months, including 1) site preparation and construction, 2) site operations including ARM and brine treatment technology testing and demonstration, and 3) project closeout/decommissioning and data processing/reporting.\n\nAdvanced Turbines / Advanced Combustion Turbines Pennsylvania State University (PSU) PA FE0025011 Improving Turbine Efficiencies Through Heat Transfer and Aerodynamic Research in the Steady Thermal Aero Research Turbine (START) 10/01/2015 12/31/2023\n\nThe Pennsylvania State University (Penn State), in conjunction with its industry partner, Pratt & Whitney (P&W), will test new cooling improvements for the turbine rotating blade platform in order to increase machine efficiency and reduce costs which will be referred as the Proprietary Cooled Blade Studies. The scope of the project includes: (1) the planning and execution of the Steady Thermal Aero Research Turbine (START) facility and instrumentation upgrades to include a heated main gas path with full-span airfoils, long-wave infrared thermography, and unsteady pressures; (2) the design and manufacturing of a rainbow set of blades with baseline and advanced cooling configurations; (3) measurements of aerodynamics and heat transfer for baseline and advanced configurations over a range of cooling flows, Reynolds numbers, rotational Reynolds numbers, and flow angles; and (4) continual assessment of additive manufactured components to reduce costs and advance cooling designs. The project will focus on performing the first open-literature, consecutive comparisons of baseline and advanced cooling configurations in a test turbine with realistic engine hardware and flow conditions. The project will also allow direct comparisons of airfoil heat transfer measurements to be made in three relevant testing environments: low speed and temperature, high pressure temperature static conditions, and high velocity rotational conditions. This back-to-back comparison will provide data to guide the gas turbine industry in introducing these new cooling technologies into operating gas turbines. This work builds on previous NETL-Regional University Alliance (RUA) Contract FWP-2012.03.02.\n\nSince the inception of the Proprietary Cooled Blade study and the desire to involve a larger community of turbine manufacturers, DOE-NETL initiated an annual meeting at Penn State to gather industry feedback on the integration of the cooling technologies into the proprietary blade design. Companies attending the meeting represented all of the US turbine manufacturers as well as a number of other federal agencies such as NASA, ONR, and the AF. While the companies were pleased to provide input, they also realized that the data produced would be limited given the blade geometry was proprietary and only scaled results would be shared. During these meetings, there was a strong push from the manufacturers to develop a turbine geometry that all could have access to rather than have a proprietary blade design. This push started the inception of discussions of a common turbine geometry.\n\nThrough further DOE-NETL and Penn State discussions with industry and other federal agencies, the National Experimental Turbine (NExT) Cooled Blade Studies was initiated. At the DOE Peer Review in April 2019, the reviewers emphasized the need for a common turbine geometry. NExT is proposed to be a turbine testing platform focused on US technology advancement, designed in collaboration with four turbine manufacturers –Honeywell, Pratt & Whitney, Solar, and Siemens – in partnership with Agilis, a turbine design firm. The NExT vane and blade geometry as well as all of the baseline data will be shared with all of the turbine manufacturers, US federal agencies and US universities within the data management plan. While all turbine geometries are highly proprietary, the goal for NeXT is to provide a modern turbine design that can be used by several organizations, which is a distinctly different effort than the proprietary cooled blade studies, which uses a proprietary blade design thereby limiting the applicability for the turbine manufacturers. The NExT platform is essential to provide all the details needed to do accurate code development.\n\nCoal Utilization Science / Simulation-Based Engineering Ames National Laboratory IA FWP-AL-14-510-075 The SMARTER Project (Science of Multicomponent Alloys: Roadmap for Theoretical and Experimental Research) 04/01/2015 09/30/2018 NETL is partnering with Ames National Laboratory to propose a new methodology to speed the discovery and optimization of chemically complex alloys and leverage theoretical and experimental capabilities for assessing their long-term stability. Near equiatomic alloys have a high degree of chemical disorder in a single high-temperature (T) phase leading to high mechanical strength. These disordered alloys have potential for fossil energy in high-temperature applications; however, their long-term stability in harsh combustion environments has not yet been explored. Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) NM FWP-FE-663-15-FY16 Advanced Thermally Robust Membranes for High Salinity Extracted Brine Treatment 02/01/2016 04/30/2017 This project will develop and evaluate a polymeric membrane that can withstand high temperature, high salt concentration, and the presence of oxygen for use with hot waste-gas streams as a membrane sweep within the hot gas sweep membrane brine separation (HASMBS) process for high-salinity brine treatment. The developed membrane process will enable water removal from the brine stream, thereby concentrating the brine and reducing its volume for re-injection or disposal. The water vapor in the gas sweep stream can either be exhausted into the environment or utilized in a subsequent unit operation. Whereas reverse osmosis (RO) is currently the most energy-efficient technology for desalination, it is inherently limited to lower-salinity brines such as those encountered in sea water treatment. Current commercial technologies for treating high-salinity brine streams for reuse applications, (e.g., evaporative crystallization and mechanical vapor compression) are often considered too costly and energy inefficient to warrant their use. Advanced Storage / Secure Storage (Migration Outside of Reservoir) University of Texas at Austin TX FE0028193 Field Validation of MVA Technology for Offshore CCS: Novel Ultra-High-Resolution 3D Marine Seismic Technology (P-Cable) 10/01/2016 09/30/2024\n\nThis project is designed to validate a technology to enhance the monitoring, verification, and accounting (MVA) of CO2 injected underground for the purpose of long-term geologic storage and enhanced oil and gas recovery. Specifically, the effort is deploying, validating, and integrating an ultra-high-resolution 3D marine seismic (UHR3D) technology appropriate for large-demonstration and commercial-scale offshore CCS sites. Researchers are acquiring and validating at least one ultra-high-resolution 3D seismic dataset at an operational carbon capture and storage demonstration site. The study will use this data acquisition to validate the innovative, dynamic acoustic-positioning techniques. Subsequently, they will use this information to define the extent and boundaries of the CO2 plume, and track and quantify the uncertainty of spatial and temporal movement of CO2 through the reservoir.\n\nSupercritical Carbon Dioxide Technology (sCO2) / Systems Integration and Optimization Gas Technology Institute (GTI) IL FE0028979 Supercritical Carbon Dioxide Pilot Plant Test Facility 10/01/2016 12/31/2024\n\nThe objectives of this project and for this facility are to demonstrate the operability of the supercritical carbon dioxide (sCO2) power cycle, verify the performance of components (turbomachinery, recuperators, and compressors, etc.), show the potential for producing a lower cost of electricity in relevant applications, and demonstrate the potential and pathway for a thermodynamic cycle efficiency greater than 50 percent. Ultimately, this project will demonstrate at least a 700°C turbine inlet temperature or higher design point, and produce a recompression closed Brayton cycle (RCBC) configuration that can be used to demonstrate and evaluate system and component design and performance capabilities (including turbomachinery and recuperators in steady state, transient, load following, and limited endurance operation). The facility will also be capable of being reconfigured to accommodate potential future testing of system/cycle upgrades, new cycle configurations, and new or upgraded components in addition to next-generation turbomachinery and heat exchanger technology.

RBDM is a suite of tools for all aspects of managing regulatory data. The major objectives of this project include the upgrade the RBDMS to a web based application, making the RBDMS user interface more intuitive and easier to use in progressive budget periods; provide outreach to states and agencies through training programs, special meetings, and state by state outreach for all RBDMS products; update and install RBDMS modules in additional state programs; address information gaps for states on produced water and gas storage, and the creation of additional water management tools. The RBDMS website can be found at https://www.rbdms.org/\n\nAdditionally, the project maintains FracFocus which is a growing database of chemical disclosures providing the general public with access to information about chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing. FracFocus was created in 2011 to provide the general public with access to information about chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing and to provide factual information about hydraulic fracturing chemical use. The system allows state regulatory agencies to receive disclosure of chemicals and fluids used in the process of hydraulic fracturing from operators. Reports from more than 1,100 companies reporting chemicals for more than 138,000 hydraulic fracturing operations nationwide have been received. The FracFocus Website can be found at https://www.fracfocus.org/\n\nPost-Combustion Capture / Membranes Luna Innovations VA SC0017124 Solid Phase Supports for Flue Gas CO2 Separation with Molten Electrolytes 02/21/2017 11/20/2022\n\nIn this Phase II Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project, Luna Innovations and its partners Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), Nooter/Eriksen, and the University of Illinois at Chicago will address the materials optimization, design, and scale up of solid phase supports that have the potential to sustainably operate in dual phase membranes at high carbon dioxide (CO2) separation rates and thermally favorable conditions. Dual phase membranes consist of a porous solid material supporting a non-volatile liquid electrolyte and enable passive CO2 separation from flue gas, allowing for lower energy costs at large scale. Research studies by LLNL have led to using yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) – an inert, high-strength ceramic – as a highly promising support material in dual phase membranes for both pre-combustion and post-combustion CO2 capture. Luna’s complimentary U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) SBIR program (DE-SC0015123) is focused on optimizing the liquid phase portion of the technology for post-combustion CO2 capture, while the feasibility, stability, and scalability of the solid phase support under relevant operational conditions have yet to be explored and will be the focus of this project. YSZ, along with its derivatives, will be evaluated as both a standalone solid phase support, and in conjunction with a single molten salt electrolyte. Through surface modification with metal oxide support materials and prototype modeling of scaled-up form factors, the developed solid phase supports will provide the performance and scalability necessary to separate CO2 from flue gas in the 400-600°C temperature range that is typically found in fossil fuel power plant heat recovery steam generators (HRSG). In Phase I, the team developed high stability support materials with precision manufactured tubular membranes and achieved the highest separation rates recorded for a CO2 membrane. Phase II efforts will focus on the design of a multi-tube membrane module, long-term stability testing, and materials evaluation, with the goal of commercializing dual phase CO2 separation membranes as the program progresses into Phase III.\n\nLos Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) NM FWP-FE-844-17-FY17 Water Treatment and Water-Vapor Recovery Using Advanced Thermally Robust Membranes Power Production 09/25/2017 03/31/2019\n\nGrowing water and energy needs mandate implementation of technologies promoting water recovery and/or use of alternative water resources to provide clean water for power plant operations while reducing their reliance on fresh water. Water vapor capture from flue gas and non-conventional water resource utilization including extracted high-salinity brine treatment and use provide a path forward to meet the water needs of the power production industry. The focus of this effort is to develop a thermally robust membrane separation technology for use in challenging corrosive flue gas and high-salinity brine environments for clean water production. Polybenzimidazole (PBI)-based membranes are excellent candidates for these extreme environment water separations owing to their high water vapor transport characteristics and demonstrated thermo-chemical durability. Los Alamos National Laboratory has developed a suite of PBI materials and membrane platforms that have proven exceptional for harsh environment elevated temperature separations, e.g., carbon dioxide capture in pre-combustion syngas environments. The focus of this effort is to gather PBI membrane performance data and demonstrate durability at process-relevant operating conditions for flue gas dehydration (65 degrees Celsius [°C] in presence of sulfur oxides and nitrogen oxides) and high-salinity extracted water treatment (50,000 to 300,000 mg/L total dissolved solids and up to 200 °C).\n\nPlant Optimization Technologies / POT - Sensors & Controls University of Central Florida FL FE0031282 In-Situ Optical Monitoring of Operating Gas Turbine Blade Coatings Under Extreme Environments 10/01/2017 09/30/2022\n\nWith engine temperatures exceeding the limits that metallic blades and vanes can endure, advanced monitoring techniques that ensure the integrity and durability of thermal barrier coatings are paramount to continuous and safe operation. The University of Central Florida will use key properties of optical radiation—including temporal, spectral and spectral intensity response modes, coupled with active sensing from coating properties—to gain diagnostic information on high temperature Thermal Barrier Coatings (TBCs). Materials design incorporating rare earth elements within TBCs to create the self-indicating property will be accompanied by research efforts to correlate optical measurements to TBC diagnostic parameters. The methods will be developed and demonstrated at the laboratory scale with the goal of future implementation for gas-turbine ready conditions.\n\nAdvanced Turbines / Advanced Combustion Turbines Pennsylvania State University (PSU) PA FE0031280 Discrete Element Roughness Modeling for Design Optimization of Additively and Conventionally Manufactured Internal Turbine Cooling Passages 10/01/2017 09/30/2022\n\nPennsylvania State University will deliver a computational 3-D model set that can be implemented within current turbine manufacturing design practices. To achieve this, they will first produce four engine-scale turbine cooling passage configurations and cooling hole geometry configurations using additive manufacturing techniques representative of current gas turbine practice. They will then advance, validate, and apply volumetric based Discrete Element Roughness Modeling (DERM) to engine-scale turbine blade cooling passages, and carry out validation quality local flow and heat transfer measurements using geometrically up-scaled hardware in facilities at Baylor University, and then develop optimized designs for cooling passage and cooling hole geometries that accommodate the critically important and mechanistically modeled effects of the complex roughness field that arises in Powder Bed Fusion manufacturing.\n\nRare Earth Recovery / REE Detection Systems Idaho National Laboratory (INL) ID FWP-INEL-B000-17-015 New Sensing Mechanisms for Rare Earth Detection in Coal and Coal Byproducts 08/31/2017 09/30/2020\n\nThe objective of Idaho National Laboratory (INL) in this project is to evaluate novel complexation chemistries for the development of innovative sensing technologies for rare earth elements (REEs). Complexation of lanthanides by peptides, coupled with the unique spectroscopic properties of lanthanides, is the underpinning for luminescent applications of lanthanide binding tags (LBTs), originally invented as biochemical tools for the study of proteins. A peptide sequence specifically designed to bind lanthanides includes amino acids which have chromophore side-chains (tyrosine or tryptophan), and upon lanthanide binding the complex exhibits unique luminescence properties, enabling detection and visualization. In coal and coal by-products, although specific lanthanide enrichments may vary by provenance, generally the whole lanthanide series is present. A positive signal generated upon exposure of a sample to the specialized REE ligand would imply that the sample is enriched with REE and is worthy of further examination. Specifically, INL will evaluate whether the chemistry of LBTs or other novel chromophore ligands can serve as the foundation for tools enabling rapid screening of REE-containing materials in the field.\n\nLawrence Livermore National Laboratory is a collaborator on this project through award FWP-LLNL-17-FEW0231.\n\nRare Earth Recovery / Separation Technologies Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) NM FWP-FE-810-17-FY17 Evaluation of Novel Strategies and Processes for Separation of Rare Earth Elements from Coal-Related Materials 08/01/2017 09/30/2020\n\nThe Los Alamos effort comprises two complementary tasks. The first task will evaluate current and enhanced actinide/lanthanide separation processes relative to identifying potential processes and strategies for REE separation from coal and coal by-products. This effort will evaluate existing separation approaches developed for nuclear materials to determine their potential for application to REEs extraction, and will include consideration of the techno-economics of these processes and challenges related to their energy intensity, selectivity, and process complexity. The second task will evaluate the potential of developing new processing and separation schemes based on emerging technologies. The initial phase of the project will screen the following processing approaches: (1) Processing under hydrothermal conditions; this effort builds on previous work that suggests that better control of lanthanides speciation at elevated temperature can be exploited to perform efficient REEs separation. (2) REE-selective extraction using supercritical carbon dioxide (CO2) and soluble ligands; this effort builds on initial proof-of-concept studies on supercritical CO2 that show great promise for simple and effective separation of REE from oxide materials. (3) Separation of REE using ionic liquids and other solvent-based systems.\n\nTransformative Power Generation (TPG) / Improvements for Existing Coal Plants University of Utah UT FE0031559 Ultrasonic Measurements of Temperature Profile and Heat Fluxes in Coal-Fired Power Plants 01/01/2018 12/31/2022\n\nThe objective of this project is to develop a prototype multipoint ultrasound measurements of segmental temperature distribution (US-MSTD) method by refining the existing implementation and evolving its capabilities to include measurements at multiple locations across several zones and the characterization of soot and other deposits. The implementation of the US-MSTD method with metal waveguides is particularly appealing as a step towards the applications in measuring temperature distribution along steam tubes and other metal components of utility and industrial boilers. Refinements of the prototype US-MSTD system with its new features and capabilities will be validated through multiple tests in an iterative progression from laboratory experiments to testing at the pilot scale and large utility boilers at the Hunter Power Plant.\n\nGasification Systems / Air Separation Technology University of South Carolina SC FE0031473 Modularization of Ceramic Hollow Fiber Membrane Technology for Air Separation 01/01/2018 03/31/2024\n\nThe University of South Carolina will develop a membrane stack and module for air separation and oxygen production by scaling up a innovative technology involving an intermediate-temperature ceramic hollow fiber membrane. The technology is then incorporated into a REMS­ gasification skid and supports the oxidant feed of an oxygen-blown REMS gasifier scaled to various ranges. Overall, successful development of this technology may improve performance, reliability, and scale-up flexibility, as well as reduce capital and operating costs. These improvements could have broader impacts on the development of high-performance and durable air-separation technologies for oxygen­ intensive industries.\n\nTransformative Power Generation (TPG) / Improvements for Existing Coal Plants GE Steam Power, Inc. CT FE0031546 Extended Low Load Boiler Operation to Improve Performance and Economics of an Existing Coal Fired Power Plant 01/01/2018 06/30/2023\n\nThe purpose of this project is to improve the performance and economics of existing coal-fired power plants by extending boiler operation to lower loads. The objective is to develop and validate sensor hardware and analytical algorithms to lower plant operating expenses for the pulverized coal utility boiler fleet. The focus is on relatively inexpensive new “Internet of Things” technologies to minimize capital investment. Three technologies will be explored for demonstration and full-scale testing in a coal-fired power plant. The first focuses on gas and steam temperature control issues at low load. The second uses sensors and analytic algorithms for monitoring coal pulverizer operation at lower loads to reduce the minimum firing capability of coal burners. The third investigates new sensors and advanced controls to better balance air and fuel at each burner enabling reduction in the minimum firing capability of coal burners. Enabling lower load boiler and plant operation may help coal fired power plants more effectively compete for electric grid dispatch in a grid increasingly driven by intermittent renewable energy sources.\n\nTransformative Power Generation (TPG) / Advanced Combustion Southwest Research Institute (SwRI) TX FE0031549 Particle Separator for Improved Flameless Pressurized Oxy-Combustion 01/01/2018 12/31/2022\n\nThe Southwest Research Institute plans to advance flameless pressurized oxy-combustion (FPO) technology, making it more efficient and commercially viable by developing, building, and testing a flue gas particle separator for the FPO cycle, which is a component critical to the advancement of solid coal power generation technology. The separator will potentially remove harmful particulates from the process flue gas, preventing erosion of downstream machinery while maintaining a low pressure drop, thereby ensuring that the cycle operates at maximum efficiency. It will be demonstrated to operate at high temperatures to ensure the maximum amount of power can be extracted from the turbo-expander. Many candidate separator designs will be considered—from centrifugal or curvature to more novel concepts, such as indexed surface impact adhesion. The design will go through a final design evaluation and fabrication, after which it will be shipped to a test location facility.\n\nAdvanced Combustion Systems / Enabling Technologies/Innovative Concepts University of Maine System ME FE0031550 Technology Maturation of Wireless Harsh-Environment Sensors for Improved Condition-Based Monitoring of Coal-Fired Power Generation 01/11/2018 01/10/2023\n\nThe University of Maine will develop, adapt, implement, test, and transition wireless harsh-environment surface acoustic wave (SAW) sensor technology in coal-fired power plants. The technology offers several potential advantages for inline monitoring of coal-based power generation systems including accurate, battery-free, maintenance-free wireless operation. The small footprint will potentially allow flexible sensor placement and embedding of multiple sensor arrays into a variety of components that can be sampled with a near-by interrogating antenna and radio frequency signal processing unit. The temperature and/or strain measurements acquired from wireless SAW sensors represent critical data for actively monitoring the health condition and detecting failures in boiler tubes, headers, and piping at several key locations in coal-based power generation facilities. Expected outcomes include a matured technology; advancements in the packaging of SAW sensors and antennas to allow long-term robust operation; refined wireless communications protocols and signal processing; improved thin films and sensor packaging; and prototype static and dynamic strain SAW sensors. The University of Maine will install and test their resulting prototype wireless sensor systems at a solid-waste-to-energy plant and a coal-fired power plant.\n\nAdvanced Storage / Plume Detection and Storage Efficiency Pennsylvania State University (PSU) PA FE0031544 Integration of Seismic-Pressure-Petrophysics Inversion of Continuous Active-Seismic Monitoring Data for Monitoring and Quantifying CO2 Plume 01/24/2018 12/31/2022\n\nThis project is developing and validating an integrated package of joint seismic-pressure-petrophysics inversion of a continuous active-source seismic monitoring dataset capable of providing real-time monitoring of a carbon dioxide (CO2) plume during geologic carbon storage. The resulting real-time map of CO2 saturation obtained using this process will provide a deeper understanding of the complex, time-varying dynamics of the subsurface fluid flow migration path, as well as the rapid detection of potential CO2 leakage.\n\nAdvanced Storage / Plume Detection and Storage Efficiency Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) WA FWP-70066 New Imaging and CO2 Storage Technologies for Unconventional Subsurface Reservoirs 04/01/2018 09/30/2024\n\nThis project is working to develop geophysical contrast agents for enhanced monitoring of injected carbon dioxide (CO2) in sedimentary rocks and for mapping fracture networks in depleted shale gas formations. The focus of the project is characterizing coupled geochemical, pore network, and geomechanical responses to subsurface fluid-rock interactions that are associated with unconventional reservoirs. The effort is divided into three technical tasks.\n\nEnvironmentally Prudent Stewardship (EPS) Texas A&M Engineering Experiment Station TX FE0031579 The Austin Chalk/Eagle Ford Field Laboratory 04/01/2018 12/31/2023\n\nThe goal of this project is to improve efficiency of oil and gas recovery from hydraulically fractured horizontal wells. This field-based research will be conducted in the Austin Chalk and Eagle Ford Shale Formations with the purpose of addressing fundamental questions such as the extent of the true stimulated reservoir volume and the complexity of the resulting fracture system. Utilizing newly-developed and comprehensive monitoring solutions, the team will deliver unprecedented and comprehensive high-quality field data to improve scientific knowledge of the hydraulic fracturing process when multiple wells are fractured from a single pad location. This knowledge will allow optimized production from less new wells with less material and energy use.\n\nLawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) is also a recipient under this award, and their work is captured through a separate support FWP (FWP-FP00006273). The total award value of this support FWP is $2,000,000 (all DOE Share), bringing the total value of this project and all recipients to $20,450,502 (DOE Share: $9,778835; Performer Share: $10,671,667).\n\nPost-Combustion Capture / Membranes Membrane Technology and Research, Inc. CA FE0031587 Large Pilot Testing of the MTR Membrane Post-Combustion CO2 Capture Process 04/01/2018 09/30/2026\n\nThe overall goal of this project is to advance a membrane-based, post-combustion carbon dioxide (CO2) capture process to a large pilot stage. Membrane Technology and Research (MTR) will construct and operate a large pilot system of the MTR membrane post-combustion CO2 capture technology. MTR will build this system at the Wyoming Integrated Test Center (WITC) at Basin Electric’s 422-megawatt (MW) Dry Fork Station located in Gillette, Wyoming. This station processes sub-bituminous coal from the Western Fuels’ Dry Fork Mine. Successful operation of the MTR large pilot membrane system will result in capturing 70% of the CO2 from a 10-MWe equivalent slipstream, representing capture of approximately 150 metric tons of CO2 per day at the station.\n\nMTR subcontractor Sargent & Lundy (S&L) will perform the detailed design; Trimeric Corporation (another MTR subcontractor) will perform detailed design of CO2 compression and purification, as well as conduct a techno-economic analysis; and Graycor (another MTR subcontractor) will provide construction services.\n\nThe overall project has five budget periods (BPs): Phase I/BP1—Feasibility (completed in 2019); Phase II/BP2—Front-End Engineering Design (FEED; completed in 2021); Phase III/BP3—Detailed Design and Construction (Initiated in 2021); Phase III/BP4—Operation; and Phase III/BP5—Decommissioning.\n\nEOR - Offshore C-Crete Technologies, LLC TX FE0031574 Hexagonal Boron Nitrate Reinforced Multifunctional Well Cement for Extreme Conditions 04/01/2018 03/31/2023\n\nThis project provides a system approach for developing the next generation of well cementing with multifunctional, high performance characteristics— including mechanical, thermal, rheological, and durability properties—to prevent offshore spill and leakage at extreme high temperature, high pressure, and corrosive conditions. A proof-of-concept hexagonal boron-nitride/cement composite will be developed and tuned to offer optimum slurry formulation and rheological properties, and the best hybrid nanostructure. The actual barrier efficiency and performance of this cement formulation will be tested against gas/liquid leakage inside a simulated environment. The well cement product is cost-effective, has no toxicity, and easily integrates to existing equipment and facilities.\n\nPost-Combustion Capture / Solvents University of Illinois IL FE0031581 Large Pilot Testing of Linde-BASF Advanced Post-Combustion Carbon Dioxide Capture Technology at a Coal-Fired Power Plant 04/04/2018 05/31/2026\n\nResearchers at the University of Illinois, in partnership with the Linde Group, BASF Corporation, Affiliated Engineers, Inc., and Affiliated Construction Services, Inc., are designing an amine-based carbon dioxide (CO2) capture pilot-scale (10 megawatt-electric [MWe]) system at an existing coal-fired power plant. The system is based on the Linde-BASF advanced CO2 capture process incorporating BASF’s novel solvent with an advanced stripper inter-stage heater design to optimize heat recovery. In a previous U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)-funded project, the Linde-BASF CO2 capture technology showed the potential to be cost-effective and energy-efficient using actual flue gas during pilot-scale (1.5 MWe) testing at the National Carbon Capture Center. The aqueous amine-based solvent was optimized to exhibit long-term stability and a 20 percent reduction in regeneration energy requirements when compared to commercially available solvents; additional improvements in process design further reduce the cost of CO2 capture.\n\nProjects to design, construct, and operate large-scale pilots of transformational coal technologies are being conducted in three phases, with a down-select between phases. In Phase I of this project, the team completed preliminary design and engineering analyses for a 10 MWe capture facility installed at three potential host sites and selected the City, Water, Light and Power’s (CWLP) Dallman Power Plant as the host site based on the studies. The project team also completed an Environmental Information Volume (EIV) for the selected site, updated preliminary cost and schedule estimates, secured cost-share commitments for Phase II, and developed a plan for securing cost-share commitments for Phase III. The project was selected for Phase II (Design), in which the team will complete a front-end engineering design (FEED) study, including a detailed cost and schedule estimate for Phase III for the installation of the 10 MWe pilot at CWLP, complete the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) process and any required permitting processes at CWLP, secure Phase III (construction/operation) cost share funding, and complete an updated techno-economic analysis of the technology based on the most recent system design and cost information.\n\nThe Phase III objectives are to complete detailed engineering, procurement of equipment and modules, and build and operate a 10 MWe large pilot of the Linde/BASF post-combustion carbon capture technology at the CWLP Dallman Power Plant in Springfield, Illinois. The Phase III scope of work includes: (1) obtaining construction and operating permits for all regulated activities occurring during Phase III; (2) finalizing functional specifications and completing detailed engineering; (3) procuring equipment and materials for inside and outside the boundary limits (ISBL and OSBL); (4) constructing and installing the large pilot; (5) commissioning of the large pilot plant followed by parametric and steady-state operating test campaigns; (6) analyzing test campaign results; and (7) updating the techno-economic analysis (TEA) based on the design and cost information developed during the Phase III test campaign.\n\nThe approach used for design, construction, and commissioning is an important feature of the technology and will help enable the commercialization process. The regional economic benefit and the ability to repurpose some existing workforce at CWLP will also demonstrate how carbon capture can aid regional economies when it is deployed. If the technology performs as planned, there is a desire to have the capture plant remain in place and be utilized for future testing of capture and utilization technologies.\n\nPost-Combustion Capture / Solvents University of Illinois IL FE0031600 Development and Bench-Scale Testing of a Novel Biphasic Solvent-Enabled Absorption Process for Post-Combustion Carbon Capture 04/06/2018 03/31/2023\n\nThe University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) will partner with Trimeric Corporation to advance the development of a transformational biphasic carbon dioxide (CO2) absorption process (BiCAP) and validate its technical advantages by testing an integrated system at a 40-kilowatt-electric (kWe) bench scale with actual coal-derived flue gas. The BiCAP process utilizes biphasic solvents, which are water-lean solvent blends, that can form and develop dual liquid phases, with the absorbed CO2 highly enriched in one of the phases. Key features of BiCAP include using only the CO2-enriched liquid phase for CO2 desorption, resulting in reduced mass of solvent required for regeneration, and directly feeding a portion of the CO2-enriched solvent as a cold stream feed to the top of the stripper, which reduces the use of stripping heat and increases the energy efficiency for CO2 stripping. In a previous U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)-funded project, the BiCAP was tested at laboratory scale (10 kWe) and exhibited a 34 percent reduction in parasitic power requirements and twice the CO2 working capacity for desorption when compared with a process using the most widely-used, commercially available amine-based solvent, monoethanolamine (MEA). After determining the optimal process configuration and operating conditions, the team will design and fabricate the 40-kWe integrated bench-scale capture unit. Parametric testing for two of the best performing biphasic solvents identified from previous research will be conducted with simulated flue gas at UIUC’s Applied Research Laboratory and one selected solvent will be evaluated with a slipstream of actual flue gas at the UIUC Abbott coal-fired power plant. The team will use the test results to prepare a techno-economic analysis, as well as an analysis of the technology gaps and potential environmental, health, and safety risks, to advance the technology toward further scale up and commercialization.\n\nEnvironmentally Prudent Stewardship (EPS) Austin Geotech Services, Inc. TX SC0018464 Permanent Magnet (PM) Induction Heater for Paraffin Abatement 04/09/2018 04/03/2025\n\nThis project will investigate the development and design that will generate heat at a localized spot in the production tubing string with no surface connections or independent electrical power supply. Heat is generated from the relative motion between a set of magnets and magnetically conductive surface. The relative motion produces eddy currents that heat the conductor, and the energy input to the unit is provided by the vertical travel of the sucker rod pump. One of the major operational costs associated with production of mature oil wells is the elimination of wax and paraffin buildup in the production tubing. The accumulation of paraffinic compounds in cold spots in the tubing creates high pressures and flow restrictions that, at the very least, contribute to accelerated pump wear, and at worst, constrict the flow altogether.\n\nStorage Infrastructure / Regional Initiative Southern States Energy Board (SSEB) GA FE0031557 Southeast Regional Carbon Storage Partnership: Offshore Gulf of Mexico 04/01/2018 12/31/2024\n\nThis project will expand membership of the Southern States Energy Board’s existing Gulf of Mexico (GOM) government-industry partnership to focus on assembling the knowledge base required for secure, long-term, large-scale carbon dioxide (CO2) subsea storage. The partnership’s evaluation will focus on active and depleted oil and gas fields and potentially associated CO2-enhanced oil recovery, as well as deep saline storage resources in the eastern portion of the GOM’s federal and state waters. The partnership will integrate and assess characterization data and infrastructure delivery options and adapt and tailor monitoring, verification, and accounting (MVA) technology applications and geologic and dynamic flow models for offshore CO2 storage projects. The project will facilitate the subsequent development of technology-focused permitting processes needed by industry and regulators for CO2 storage in the GOM.\n\nStorage Infrastructure / Regional Initiative University of Texas at Austin TX FE0031558 Offshore Gulf of Mexico Partnership for Carbon Storage - Resources and Technology Development (GOMCarb) 04/01/2018 03/31/2024\n\nThis project will develop an industry/academic/governmental partnership that will assemble the knowledge base required to support use of the geologic environments beneath the Gulf of Mexico (GOM) for secure, long-term, large-scale carbon dioxide (CO2) storage and enhanced hydrocarbon recovery. The knowledge base created by the Offshore Carbon Storage Partnership will facilitate subsequent development of technology-focused permitting processes needed by industry and regulators. This project will provide an offshore CO2 resource characterization for the western portion of the GOM through the assessment and integration of geologic and engineering information. The partnership will focus on identifying and addressing knowledge gaps, regulatory issues, infrastructure requirements, and technical challenges associated with offshore CO2 storage. This project will work to improve the confidence in containment of CO2 in the subsea offshore environment in storage reservoirs over both short and long timeframes.\n\nUnconventional Field Test Sites University of Alaska - Fairbanks AK FE0031606 First Ever Field Pilot on Alaska's North Slope to Validate the Use of Polymer Floods for Heavy Oil EOR 06/01/2018 10/31/2022\n\nThe primary goal of the project is to acquire scientific knowledge and gain polymer flood performance data, via the first ever advanced technology based field pilot to optimize the polymer flood design in the Milne Point Unit of the Schrader Bluff heavy oil pool on Alaska North Slope (ANS), with minimal disruption to ongoing field operations. Heavy oil is a vast energy resource that requires significant effort and expertise to produce economically. However, because conventional oil discoveries are not keeping up with overalloil demand, unconventional resources such as shale oil and heavy oil will be necessary to meet increasing world demand. Because American operators have never attempted polymer floods, this will be the first of its kind, unconventional resource application. The advanced technology will effectively integrate the advantages of polymer injection, low salinity water, conformance improvement and horizontal wells together to significantly enhance oil recovery for heavy oil reservoirs. The proposed research seeks answers to key unresolved questions, such as polymer injectivity for different viscosities/concentrations, timing of polymer breakthrough, polymer stability and retention in the formation, treatment of polymer water after breakthrough, and finally, incremental oil recovery as a function of polymer injected.\n\nPost-Combustion Capture / Solvents SRI International CA FE0031597 Mixed-Salt-Based Transformational Solvent Technology for CO2 Capture 06/01/2018 12/31/2023\n\nSRI International (SRI), in partnership with SINTEF, Technical University of Denmark, OLI Systems, Inc., and Trimeric Corporation, will develop a novel, water-lean, mixed-salt-based transformational solvent technology to provide a step-change reduction in the cost and energy penalties of post-combustion carbon dioxide (CO2) capture. In prior research, SRI designed a mixed-salt process (MSP) that uses a solvent formulation comprised of ammonium and potassium salt solutions. In the MSP chemistry, ammonia plays a dual role as a catalyst and absorbent due to its high mobility and reactivity with CO2. Through a previous U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)-funded project, the MSP process was tested in a large bench-scale integrated system consisting of two isothermal absorbers and a selective regenerator, achieving long-term, continuous operation with greater than 90 percent capture and regeneration of over 99 percent pure CO2 at high pressure. In this project, methyl diethanolamine (MDEA) will be added to the MSP formulation to aid low-temperature regeneration and high CO2 loading, resulting in an advanced mixed-salt process (A-MSP) with improved capture performance and process economics. The research activities include measurements of the solvent formulation’s physio-chemical properties, thermodynamic modeling and vapor-liquid-equilibrium (VLE) measurements of multicomponent systems, kinetic measurements under absorber and regeneration conditions, and solvent degradation and aerosol formation studies. A rate-based model and process flowsheet simulation will be developed as part of a techno-economic evaluation, and continuous operation of the A-MSP in SRI’s bench-scale integrated CO2 absorber-regenerator system will be performed.\n\nPost-Combustion Capture / Membranes Membrane Technology and Research, Inc. CA FE0031596 Development of Self-Assembly Isoporous Supports Enabling Transformational Membrane Performance for Cost Effective Carbon Capture 06/01/2018 05/31/2024\n\nMembrane Technology and Research, Inc. (MTR), in partnership with the State University of New York at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo), will develop composite membranes with transformational performance to reduce the cost of post-combustion carbon capture. In previous work, funded by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), MTR developed a membrane-based carbon dioxide (CO2) capture technology that includes the high-performance MTR Polaris™ membrane, advanced low-pressure-drop modules, and a patented selective recycle membrane design. This project builds upon the previous work and consists of two parallel technology development efforts. The first effort replaces the conventional porous supports used in composite membranes with novel isoporous supports that have higher surface porosity and many small pores improving membrane permeance. The second effort aims to increase the mixed-gas selectivity of MTR’s Polaris membrane by utilizing recent materials work conducted at SUNY Buffalo. Laboratory-scale isoporous support-based composite membrane modules will be tested at MTR. A bench-scale skid will be constructed, and the modules will be tested at the National Carbon Capture Center with coal-fired flue gas.\n\nPost-Combustion Capture / Membranes Gas Technology Institute (GTI) IL FE0031598 Bench-Scale Development of a Transformational Graphene Oxide-Based Membrane Process for Post-Combustion CO2 Capture 06/01/2018 10/30/2024\n\nGas Technology Institute (GTI), in partnership with Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, The Ohio State University, and Trimeric Corporation will develop a transformational graphene oxide (GO)-based membrane process for installation in new, or retrofit into existing, pulverized coal (PC) or natural gas power plants for carbon dioxide (CO2) capture with 95 percent CO2 purity. The process (designated as GO2) integrates two types of ultrathin (~20 nm) GO-based membranes that have shown CO2 capture performance superior to state-of-the-art membranes at laboratory scale and enables step-change reductions in CO2 capture cost and energy penalties. High-selectivity membranes (designated as GO-1 membranes) that exhibit CO2/nitrogen (N2) selectivity as high as 680 with a CO2 permeance of 1,020 GPU and high-flux membranes (designated as GO-2 membranes) that achieve CO2 permeances as high as 2,500 GPU using GO quantum dots as a membrane building block have been developed in a previous U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)-funded program by GTI. In this project, GO-based membranes of flat sheet and hollow fiber geometries with an area in the range of 50 to 100 cm2 will be fabricated on low-cost polyethersulfone substrates and optimized to achieve higher selectivities while maintaining high permeances. Dynamic and steady-state stability testing will be performed on scaled-up membranes of 1,000 cm2, using simulated coal-fired flue gas with the GO-1 membranes and natural gas-fired flue gas with the GO-2 membranes. A bench-scale, two-stage GO2 system will be constructed and will undergo testing using actual natural gas-fired flue gas at GTI, followed by long-term (>200 hours) stability testing at the National Carbon Capture Center (NCCC) using actual coal-fired flue gas. A techno-economic analysis will also be completed for integration of the process in a coal-fired 550-MWe power plant.\n\nPost-Combustion Capture / Solvents SRI International CA FE0031588 Engineering-Scale Demonstration of the Mixed-Salt Process for CO2 Capture 07/01/2018 03/31/2025\n\nSRI International, in partnership with OLI Systems, Inc., Trimeric Corporation, the National Carbon Capture Center, and Baker Hughes, will test their advanced mixed-salt post-combustion carbon dioxide (CO2) absorption technology at engineering scale (0.5 MWe) to address concerns related to scale-up and integration of the technology in fossil fuel-based power plants. The process uses a non-degradable solvent that combines readily-available, inexpensive potassium and ammonium salt solutions, operates without solvent chilling, and employs a novel flow configuration that has been optimized to improve absorption kinetics, minimize ammonia emissions, and reduce water use compared to state-of-the-art ammonia-based and amine technologies. The objectives of the research project are to: 1) perform integrated mixed-salt process (MSP) testing at engineering scale for long-term periods under dynamic and continuous steady-state conditions with a real flue gas stream to address concerns relating to scale-up and integration of the technology to coal-based power plants; 2) operate the MSP with advanced heat integration to demonstrate advantages in process efficiencies; 3) study the solvent and water management strategies; and 4) collect critically important data for a detailed techno-economic analysis.\n\nPost-Combustion Capture / Sorbents TDA Research, Inc. CO SC0018682 A New Sorbent Process for Transformational Carbon Capture Process 07/02/2018 08/21/2025\n\nIn this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project, TDA Research, Inc. (TDA), in collaboration with Membrane Technology & Research, Inc., is developing a new class of sorbents to remove CO2 selectively and with high capacity from flue gases generated from pulverized-coal combustion power plants. In Phase I, TDA prepared various sorbent formulations and screened them to determine their capacity to adsorb CO2 under representative conditions. Based on the performance results, a preliminary design of the CO2 capture system was completed as well as cost and size estimates. The team also completed an engineering assessment to compare the system to alternative processes. In Phase II, TDA will continue to optimize the sorbent to enhance its CO2 capacity and further improve its resistance to flue gas impurities such as moisture, SOX and NOX. TDA will also scale-up the sorbent production and will work with MTR to prepare polymer films, which will be formed into spiral wound and planar modules. The team will assess the impact of critical process parameters at bench scale and carry out a minimum of 20,000 adsorption/desorption cycles. Finally, TDA will perform process simulation work and evaluate the techno-economic viability of the new CO2 capture technology as a retrofit option for existing pulverized coal power plants.\n\nAdvanced Turbines / Advanced Combustion Turbines GE Vernova Operations, LLC SC FE0031611 High Temperature Additive Architectures for 65 Percent Efficiency 07/09/2018 09/30/2024\n\nGeneral Electric (GE) Company will develop advanced turbine hot-gas-path inlet component technologies, enabled by additive advanced manufacturing, and resulting in efficiency improvements. Leveraging state-of-the-art additive manufacturing, novel and innovative component airfoil and end wall architectures will be developed that provide cooling flow savings while maintaining component durability. Several additive modalities and materials will be assessed analytically and concurrently. Through small-scale trials, a preferred method to manufacture the proposed design will be determined. It is expected that this project will result in advancement in component design enabled by additive manufacturing so that future gas turbine product designs could incorporate additively-produced components.\n\nAdvanced Turbines / Turbo-machinery for Supercritical CO2 Power Cycles General Electric (GE) Company NY FE0031617 Novel Modular Heat Engines with Supercritical Carbon Dioxide Bottoming Cycle Utilizing Advanced Oil-Free Turbomachinery 07/09/2018 06/30/2025\n\nGeneral Electric will evaluate a highly efficient heat engine for natural gas pipeline compression. The project is centered on the conceptual design of a novel, hermetically sealed oil-free super-critical carbon dioxide (SCO2) bottoming cycle for a natural gas combustion turbine used for pipeline compression. The effort enables heat engine cycle efficiencies >50% by demonstrating the feasibility of a two-machine oil-free drivetrain consisting of a high-speed SCO2 turbo-compressor with a direct drive starter-generator aerodynamically coupled to a 60hz 10MW SCO2 turbo-generator. The primary deliverable of this project is the conceptual design of a 10MW SCO2 bottoming cycle and associated turbomachinery. The conceptual design includes an integrated approach between different disciplines such as thermodynamic cycles, aero design, rotor dynamics, bearing design, and electric machine sizing. One project outcome will be the definition of a suitable SCO2 bottoming cycle for highly-efficient heat engines that is deployable into remote locations with minimal to no operation oversight. Another outcome is the development of a process gas lubricated bearing system for MW-class turbomachinery for implementation in SCO2.\n\nPost-Combustion Capture / Membranes Membrane Technology and Research, Inc. CA FE0031591 Scale-Up and Testing of Advanced Polaris Membrane CO2 Capture Technology 08/01/2018 01/31/2023\n\nMembrane Technology and Research, Inc. (MTR), with its partners Technology Centre Mongstad (TCM), Dresser-Rand, Trimeric Corporation, and WorleyParsons/Advisian, will scale up advanced PolarisTM membranes and modules for commercial use and validate their potential for post-combustion carbon dioxide (CO2) capture in an engineering-scale field test at TCM in Norway. This project expands on work conducted with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to develop an efficient membrane CO2 capture technology that includes the Polaris class of membranes (~20 times more permeable than prior commercial membranes) and a patented selective recycle process design that increases the concentration of CO2 in flue gas, reducing the energy and capital cost required for capture. In prior bench-scale testing on a 1 tonne/day (TPD) system at the National Carbon Capture Center (NCCC), MTR’s second-generation Polaris membranes showed double the CO2 removal capacity of the original membrane. In recent work, the Polaris capture process was scaled up to a small pilot unit (1 MWe or 20 TPD) and was successfully operated on a flue gas slipstream at NCCC and in integrated boiler testing at Babcock and Wilcox. The key tasks of this new project are to design, build, install, and operate an engineering-scale membrane capture system using advanced second-generation membranes and modules; conduct a minimum six-month field test at TCM, including parametric testing to verify system performance at partial capture rates and three months of steady-state operation; update a techno-economic assessment of the MTR membrane process; and investigate the integration of new membranes with advanced compression technology. The Polaris membranes will be packaged in compact, low-pressure-drop plate-and-frame modules optimized for flue gas treatment, and multiple modules will be contained inside a large vessel. This \"containerized\" form allows for large numbers of this modular repeat unit to be arranged in future commercial systems at low cost.\n\nReversible Solid Oxide Fuel Cells / Core Technology Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) MA FE0031668 Robust Highly Durable Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Cathodes - Improved Materials Compatibility & Self-Regulating Surface Chemistry 08/17/2018 12/15/2022\n\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology will develop electrodes that are inherently more tolerant to Cr and Si impurities in the SOFC cathode operating environment. This work draws on the recent method to fully recover oxygen exchange kinetics following Si induced aging of ceria containing cathodes. These methods take advantage of elements, which over time during SOFC operation, are released by exsolution to actively trap (i.e., getter) Cr and Si impurities in a self-regulating chemical fashion. The objective is to evaluate impurity scavenging by added reactive elements that are intentionally exsolved from the SOFC cathode electrode during operation and by conductive second phases like LSM that help nucleate chromate species on their surfaces. Researchers will use these findings to develop optimized compositions and test them in lab-scale, long-term setups.\n\nPost-Combustion Capture / Solvents Research Triangle Institute (RTI) NC FE0031590 Engineering Scale Testing of Transformational Non-Aqueous Solvent-Based Carbon Dioxide Capture Process at Technology Centre Mongstad 08/08/2018 03/31/2024\n\nResearch Triangle Institute (RTI) International, in conjunction with partners Technology Centre Mongstad (TCM), SINTEF, and Electric Power Research Institute, will advance RTI’s transformational water-lean solvent-based post-combustion carbon dioxide (CO2) capture technology by performing engineering-scale testing using the existing large-scale pilot (~12 MWe) amine plant at TCM in Norway. RTI’s process was tested successfully at laboratory, bench, and small pilot scales, including long-term coal-derived flue gas exposure testing at SINTEF’s Tiller Plant, showing a 40 percent reduction in solvent regeneration energy requirements, as well as lower thermal and oxidative solvent degradation rates compared with the conventional monoethanolamine (MEA) process. The water-lean solvent process uses intercoolers to distribute cooling throughout the CO2 absorber, which offsets the large temperature increases in the column due to the low specific heat of the solvent. The process also includes a solvent regenerator design specific for water-lean solvents that combines heat delivery and gas release in a single-step process unit to maintain lower regeneration temperatures. The project team will conduct engineering-scale testing of the process at TCM using the existing plant configuration designed for aqueous-amine solvents to evaluate the applicability of the water-lean solvent as a drop-in replacement solvent in conventional capture systems. TCM’s amine plant will then be modified for optimized operation with the water-lean solvent, and parametric and long-term testing will be performed to evaluate solvent degradation rate, emissions, solvent loss, and corrosion characteristics, the results of which will be used to complete a techno-economic analysis for a full-scale plant. The test results will also be used to address the scalability and commercial potential of RTI’s CO2 capture process, aid in understanding operational efficiency, and evaluate the feasibility of optimizing an existing amine system for operation with RTI’s water-lean solvent.\n\nReversible Solid Oxide Fuel Cells / Systems Development FuelCell Energy, Inc. (FCE) CT FE0031639 MW-Class SOFC Pilot System Development 08/17/2018 08/16/2023\n\nFuelCell Energy, Inc. (FCE) will advance the maturity of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) power systems towards commercial deployment in natural gas-fueled MWe-class distributed generation (DG) applications in the 2020s timeframe. The project objectives are to develop the conceptual design of a MWe-class SOFC power system, and to complete a techno-economic analysis (TEA) to demonstrate that the system can meet a cost target of less than or equal to $6,000/kWe at low-volume production levels. The nominal 1 MWe system will utilize FCE’s next-generation of reliable and low-cost SOFC cell and stack technology. Achievement of the project objectives will lead to deployment of a MW-class SOFC pilot system, facilitating technology readiness level progression at a quicker pace, leading to more rapid deployment of commercial DG systems in the 2020s timeframe, and will accelerate the technology development and cost reduction of utility-scale coal-based systems.\n\nReversible Solid Oxide Fuel Cells / Cell Technology Worcester Polytechnic Institute MA FE0031652 Computationally Guided Design of a Multiple Impurity Tolerant Electrode 08/17/2018 10/16/2022\n\nWorcester Polytechnic Institute will design, test, and validate cathode materials for SOFCs that maintain high performance and low degradation rates under simultaneously present, MULTIPLE impurities using a combined Integrated Computational Materials Engineering and lab-scale testing approach. The research team will comprehensively simulate the phase stabilities, equilibrium compositions, and point defect chemistry of cathode materials; experimentally validate phase stability and point defect chemistry through electrical conductivity measurements on the cathode materials identified by computational modeling; and recommend a series of potential cathode materials for cell testing. The team will then fabricate button cells using the optimized cathode, test selected cells, and recommend cathode candidates that can deliver power density higher than 1.5W/cm2 at 800C but exhibit degradation rate lower than 0.4%/1000 hours in the presence of simultaneously present, MULTIPLE impurities at the cell level, for testing in real cells/stacks at Atrex Energy.\n\nReversible Solid Oxide Fuel Cells / Core Technology University of Connecticut (UConn) CT FE0031647 Multi-Constituent Airborne Contaminants Capture with Low Cost Oxide Getters and Mitigation of Cathode Poisoning in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells 08/17/2018 08/16/2023\n\nUniversity of Connecticut will identify, fabricate, test, and validate cost-effective getter formulations and designs to capture airborne Cr, Si, S and B gaseous species entering SOFC power generation systems operating from 600 to 900°C to mitigate electrochemical poisoning of the cathode. The research effort will focus on thermodynamic and kinetic interaction studies between multi-constituent airborne gaseous impurities (predominantly acidic) and alkaline earth-transition metal oxides (basic) along with the analysis of reaction kinetics and identification of rate limiting steps that can lead to continued surface reaction under materials limitation conditions. High surface area nano-rods and nano-particles will be synthesized and incorporated into the porous getter coating formed over ceramic substrates. Advanced characterization techniques will be used to identify surface and interfacial morphological changes and compound formation. Select getter configurations will be subsequently scaled up, integrated, and tested in a prototype SOFC system test bed to validate the technology readiness level.\n\nPost-Combustion Capture / Sorbents TDA Research, Inc. CO FE0031603 Membrane-Sorbent Hybrid System for Post-Combustion Carbon Capture 08/15/2018 08/14/2023\n\nTDA Research Inc. will work with Membrane Technology and Research, Inc. (MTR), Technology Centre Mongstad (TCM), Gas Technology Institute, and the University of California Irvine to design, construct, and operate an engineering-scale (1 MWe) hybrid post-combustion carbon dioxide (CO2) capture system, combining a polymeric membrane and a low-temperature physical absorbent. The polymer membrane removes the bulk of the CO2 in the flue gas across a relatively low pressure gradient, reducing the power consumption and cost of capture. The membrane residue gas is further treated by the sorbent, ensuring greater than 90 percent CO2 capture overall. The sorbent is regenerated using the coal boiler air intake, and the CO2-laden air is fed to the boiler, generating a CO2-rich flue gas that further increases the driving force across the membrane. In a previous U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)-funded Small Business Innovative Research project, the sorbent formulation was optimized and operation of the hybrid process was evaluated at bench scale using a slipstream of actual coal-derived flue gas. A preliminary techno-economic analysis (TEA) showed a substantial improvement in net plant efficiency (~3.5 percent increase on higher heating value basis) compared with the state-of-the-art amine-based CO2 capture system. For this project, the team will design a 1-MWe modular pilot unit with the support of computational fluid dynamic simulations. Based on the final design details, the membrane-sorbent hybrid test unit will be fabricated, following modifications to MTR’s existing 1-MWe two-stage membrane skid and the construction of TDA’s modular sorbent skid. A 9- to 12-month test campaign will be performed at TCM on the field unit using an industrial flue gas that closely resembles coal-fired flue gas to evaluate the system’s performance at different operating conditions and achieve a minimum of 6,000 hours of continuous operation. The test results will be used to update the membrane performance data and the TEA, as well as to provide an environmental health and safety assessment for the technology.\n\nReversible Solid Oxide Fuel Cells / Core Technology FuelCell Energy, Inc. (FCE) CT FE0031648 Next Generation SOFC Module Development 08/17/2018 08/16/2023\n\nFuelCell Energy (FCE) will advance the reliability of stack module building blocks that will be directly applicable and scalable to greater than or equal to 100 kW modular arrays and MW-class SOFC systems by developing and testing a greater than or equal to 40 kW modular SOFC building block utilizing a second-generation core stack technology implemented in an innovative array design. FCE has recently been successful in advancing a state-of-the-art next generation stack concept, the Compact SOFC Architecture (CSA) stack, to hardware and multi-cell validation. In this project, FCE will extend the general approach—demonstrated on the CSA stack—of very significantly reducing material content (and cost) through a strategy of designing ultra-compact, robust, simple to produce, and functionally efficient modules culminating in a stack module test for at least 5000 hours conducted on natural gas fuel under operating conditions that would be envisioned in a commercial system. A successful outcome should reduce cost of SOFC systems by a factor of two or more while offering greater operational robustness and reliability and degradation rates below 0.5 percent per hour demonstrated over 5000 hours.\n\nReversible Solid Oxide Fuel Cells / Cell Technology Special Power Sources, LLC OH FE0031674 Next Generation Durable, Cost Effective, Energy Efficient Tubular Solid Oxide Fuel Cell 09/01/2018 06/30/2023\n\nAtrex Energy, Inc. will develop and optimize YSZ electrolyte-based cell technology for low cost, low temperature (550~650C), and high energy efficiency operation. The technology will be implemented and demonstrated in a high efficiency 2~3kW SOFC with applicability to sub-MW systems. The specific objective is to develop, build, and test a low degradation (<0.1%/1000 hours), high energy efficiency (>50%), low cost (<$1.0/watt) next generation tubular SOFC stack. The stack will serve as a significant precursor leading to the development of a module for megawatt power applications as well as be immediately, or with little iteration, deployable as an inexpensive commercial unit for critical applications. The work includes cell technology development tasks to develop and optimize a new ceramic interconnection to replace the current LaCrO3 interconnection; optimize the anode; improve the power density and durability of commercial cells through tailoring the nanostructure of the surface of cathodes that possess complex three-dimensional topographies using a simple one-step Atomic Layer Deposition coating; and create a thinner denser electrolyte to increase performance at low temperatures. The team will also update/modify manufacturing equipment, modify Balance-of-Plant system, and demonstrate the system at the 550~650C temperature range.\n\nEnvironmentally Prudent Development (EPD) Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) CA FWP-FP00008256 Improved Unconventional Reservoir Stimulation Through Understanding and Enhancing Gravity-Assisted Recovery of Fluids 08/01/2018 07/31/2022\n\nThe overall objective of this research effort is to gain knowledge that will be useful for efficient recovery of both hydraulic fracturing water and hydrocarbon fluids in stimulated unconventional reservoirs through an enhanced understanding of the influences of gravity and capillarity in fractures. A preliminary assessment indicates that water losses could be reduced by about 50% by stimulating fractures primarily above horizontal wells in order to facilitate drainage and recovery of the working fluid. Given the immiscibility of water with hydrocarbon fluids of interest (natural gas and light oil), improved water recovery through optimized gravity drainage is expected to improve reservoir productivity.\n\nIn order to advance our understanding of processes controlling water and gas recovery, this research will progress through three stages. First, the interactions between matrix permeability, fracturing fluid viscosity, shut-in time, and gas pressure will be experimentally explored to obtain practical scaling relations for describing gas counter-flow. Next, through laboratory experiments on gravity drainage of water from synthetic fractured rocks, empirical scaling relations for the dependence of water drainage on fracture aperture, fracture wettability, interfacial tension, and fluid viscosities and densities will be developed. In the third and final phase of work, scaling analyses will be completed for estimating water and hydrocarbon recovery under different directional fracturing and shut-in scenarios, thereby helping guide design of more efficient hydraulic fracturing. This project is builds on research conducted under a previously funded project (FWP-ESD14085).\n\nEmissions Mitigation Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) WA FWP-72954 Novel Signatures from Deploye"
