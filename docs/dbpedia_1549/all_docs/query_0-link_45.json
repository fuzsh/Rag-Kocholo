In this role Sweeney was involved in virtually every aspect of helping to build the White House and administration staff, reviewing senior and subcabinet appointments, and review of new and existing offices, and legislative priorities and strategy.\n\nPrior to his White House service, Sweeney worked as Executive Director to the House Democratic Caucus under Chairman Rahm Emanuel. From 2007-2008, Sweeney was named four times to Roll Call newspaperâs top 50 staffers on Capitol Hill. During his tenure with the caucus Sweeney was recognized as one of the most talented floor strategists and vote counters in the House, serving as a point person on every major piece of legislation during the 110th Congress, including the first military operations appropriations bill to demand accountability from the Bush administration, reauthorization of the Child Health Insurance Program (CHIP), and passage of the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) which arrested the precipitous financial crisis of 2008.\n\nIn the 2006 election cycle Sweeney served as Political Director at the Democratic Congressional Committee (DCCC). In this capacity Sweeney helped conceive and execute the strategy that helped Democrats pick up 30 seats in the House of Representatives, and regain the majority for the first time since 1994. Prior to his service at the DCCC Sweeney served as Chief of Staff to Congressman Tim Bishop of New York, and as manager of Bishopâs successful re-election campaign in 2004, a year in which Bishop was among the most highly targeted opponents of the national Republican party.\n\nIn 2000, Sweeney served as a senior aide to the campaign of then First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton. Following Clintonâs victory, Sweeney served for three and half years as the Senatorâs director of federal grants and appropriations, and legislative aide on the Environment and Public Works Committee. In this capacity Sweeney helped the Senator deliver critical funding for New Yorkâs recovery following September 11, and managed reauthorization of the federal surface transportation bill.\n\nPrior to his time with Senator Clinton, Sweeney served as a senior aide to Senator Chuck Schumer, having served previously on the Senatorâs first senate campaign.\n\nâ\n\nDeb has served as Applecartâs VP of Talent since 2024.
