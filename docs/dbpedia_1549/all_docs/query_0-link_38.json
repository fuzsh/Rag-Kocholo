        "meta_description": "Multiple ORPC power systems have been tested at the Cobscook Bay test site. ORPC initially tested and commercially operated its TidGen® Power System (TidGen) at the site in 2012-2013. The core component of the TidGen is ORPC’s proprietary turbine generator unit (TGU). The TGU utilized four advanced design crossflow (ADCF) turbines to drive a permanent magnet generator mounted between the turbines on a common driveshaft. The TGU was 30 meters in length (98 feet), 5 meters high (17 feet), and 5 meters wide (17 feet). It was attached to a bottom support frame, which held the TGU in place approximately 4.5 meters (15 feet) above the sea floor. The bottom support frame is 30 meters long (98 feet) by 15 meters wide (50 feet) by 4.5 meters high (15 feet) and secured to the seafloor with ten 30-inch diameter stell piles. The bottom support frame is constructed of steel, and the TGU was constructed of steel and composite material. The coupled TGU and bottom support frame comprised the TidGen device. The TidGen device was connected to an underwater power consolidation module, which was then connected to an onshore station through a single underwater power and data cable. Power from this device was delivered to shore and incorporated into the local electrical distribution system. The TidGen TGU was removed from the site in 2013 and the bottom support frame remained on site to allow for continued test activities.  ORPC also tested its OCGen® Module Mooring System (OCGen) at the Cobscook Bay test site in 2014. The prototype OCGen device consisted of a buoyancy pod attached to a chassis with two turbines placed in the water column 10 meters (35 feet) below mean low water. It had no generator and was not grid connected. The turbines were re-used from a previous turbine model. The device was secured using gravity anchors and a tension-leg mooring system. The OCGen was removed from the site after almost three months of testing.  ORPC’s next generation, full-scale TidGen® Power System is presently under development and partially funded by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Water Power Technologies Office. A single TidGen system is rated at 80 kilowatts (kW) of output at 2.25 meters per second (m/s) of water velocity, with a peak output of 160 kW at 3.5 m/s of velocity. The approximate dimensions of a TidGen device will be 17.8 meters wide (58 feet) by 6 meters high (20 feet). Prior to testing a full-scale iteration of the TidGen device, ORPC tested a single turbine TidGen system during summer 2023 in Cobscook Bay. Information gathered during the single turbine TidGen test phase is being utilized to complete designs, installation plans, and buildout for the full scale TidGen device. ORPC anticipates that testing of the full scale TidGen® Power System will occur in 2024.  Device/Array Installation Date:  TidGen® Power System: September 13, 2012 OCGen® Module Mooring System: June 27, 2014  Single Turbine TidGen® System: May 28,2023 TidGen® Power System: Test deployment planned for 2024   Device/Array Removal Date:  TidGen® Power System: July 15, 2013 OCGen® Module Mooring System: September 17, 2014 Single Turbine TidGen® System: September 20, 2023 TidGen Power System: TBD",

        "text": "Collision Marine Mammals The primary goal of the Marine Mammal Monitoring Plan is to identify the species, number of animals and their behavior to characterize changes in marine mammal use in and around the deployment area due to the presence of hydrokinetic devices. ORPC conducted visual observations of marine mammals in and around the Project area concurrently with other project-related tasks conducted in 2013. Marine mammal observations made by trained personnel in 2013, including during periods of operation, maintenance and retrieval did not indicate changes in marine mammal presence or behavior. There is no evidence of marine mammal strike with system components during deployment and retrieval or with TGU foils during operation. Completed Habitat Change Invertebrates The primary goals of the Benthic and Biofouling Monitoring Plan are to evaluate the benthic community during the Project and to study whether the structures introduced into the marine system contribute to biofouling accumulation that may alter the habitat within the Deployment Area. ORPC deployed video transect lines and video recordings were made by scuba divers. Benthic sampling was conducted in situ by the divers along the transect. ORPC performed biofouling assessments. The TidGen® TGU was assessed for percent coverage of biofouling on distinct structural components, and biological samples were taken from representative locations. In 2014, the installation of the OCGen® Module Mooring Project at the Cobscook Bay Tidal Energy Project site provided an opportunity to inspect the TidGen® bottom support frame, shore cable termination anchor, and the Simrad tower for benthic growth. MER Associates review of ORPC’s November 9, 2013 benthic survey of the cable route concluded that exposed sections of the cable were causing minimal disturbance to the seabed and were not adversely impacting the surrounding habitat or benthic epifauna. In addition, the buried portion of the cable was stationary and was not expected to cause any disturbance impacts. Review of the dive video and visual inspection following retrievals of the TidGen® indicate minimal biofouling of the TidGen® device. The July 2014 observations were generally consistent with those previously recorded and confirmed a continued presence of benthic organisms on subsea structures.\n\nCompleted Attraction, Avoidance, Collision Fish, Marine Mammals The goal of the Fisheries and Marine Life Interaction Monitoring Plan was to collect pre-deployment and post-deployment information to provide an initial description of fish distribution and relative abundance within Cobscook Bay to supplement existing information for the general\n\nPassamaquoddy Bay area.The Fisheries Monitoring Plan is a continuation of research started by UMaine researchers in 2009.\n\nThe study was designed to capture tidal, seasonal and spatial variability in the presence of fish in the area of interest (near the TidGen® device deployment site). The design involved down-looking hydroacoustic surveys during several months of the year, and examined the vertical distribution and relative abundance of fish at the project and control site (for relative comparison). Pre-deployment data were collected in 2010, 2011, and early 2012, and post-deployment data were collected from August 2012 through September 2013. In 2015 UMaine’s Fish Assessment Study Team completed research related to marine life interaction data around the OCGen® Module deployed in 2014. In 2016 UMaine’s Fish Assessment Study Team continued processing, analyzing, and interpreting data collected at the Project site in 2012-2014.\n\nThe hydroacoustic surveys indicated that there was a significant decline in fish density closer to the turbine beginning approximately 140 m from the free-spinning OCGen® prototype device. Noise and natural flow patterns appeared to be the most plausible explanations for the observed patterns in fish behaviour. The study provides additional confirmation that a single turbine is unlikely to result in\n\nmore than negligible impacts to fish communities.\n\nCompleted Attraction, Avoidance, Displacement Birds The primary goal of the Bird Monitoring Plan was to determine the species, number, and time of peak use of sea and shore birds in the Deployment Area, the onshore landing site where the underwater P&D cables of the TidGen® Power System comes ashore, and the waters immediately off the landing site. Post-deployment sea and shore bird monitoring was conducted by the Center for Ecological Research (CER) using trained observers familiar with local bird species and behavior. CER observed a decline in several species of seabirds in the Cobscook Bay study area in 2012- 2013, compared to the previous two winters. It seems unlikely that the operation of the TidGen® Power System affected seabird numbers. CER surveys did not find any federally or state endangered or threatened species. Completed Changes in Flow Physical Environment, Sediment Transport The primary goal of the Hydraulic Monitoring Plan was to characterize the hydrological zone of influence, area for the Project.\n\nORPC worked with Sandia National Laboratories (SNL) and Sea Engineering, Inc. to apply their SNL-EFDC Model to assess hydrodynamics at the Project site. TidGen® foundation piles were marked prior to installation for the purpose of measuring changes to seabed elevation from scour.\n\nResults of the scour monitoring indicate minimal change in seabed elevation around the foundation piles. Completed Noise Fish, Marine Mammals In compliance with its Incidental Harassment Authorization, ORPC also conducted various environmental monitoring and mitigation procedures to limit and evaluate the impacts of pile driving activities between March 24 and April 4, 2012. Additional hydroacoustic monitoring continued after the removal of the TidGen. Acoustic monitoring during pile driving activities included in-air acoustic monitoring and hydroacoustic monitoring at various near and far field ranges. Marine mammal observations on vessels around the site and on land also occurred during installation. Acoustic monitoring continued post-installation. A final report on the acoustic, marine mammal and bird monitoring studies during Phase I pile driving activities was prepared for NOAA. Pile driving source levels were below regulatory thresholds. Completed Noise Physical Environment The primary goals of the Acoustic Monitoring Plan were to identify and characterize the noise radiated by the TidGen Power System in the high-velocity environment of the Project site by gathering acoustic data under various environmental and mechanical conditions prior to and during Project deployment.\n\nMeasurements were collected at the project site using a drifting noise measurement system (DNMS). Measurements of the in-water noise level related to the TidGen Power System demonstrated that sound levels in the vicinity did not exceed 120 dB re 1 µPa2\n\n/Hz at any frequency while the TidGen turbine was rotating, both while generating and when freewheeling.\n\nCompleted Habitat Change Fish The goal of the Fisheries and Marine Life Interaction Monitoring Plan was to collect pre-deployment and post-deployment information to provide an initial description of fish distribution and relative abundance within Cobscook Bay to supplement existing information for the general Passamaquoddy Bay area. The Fisheries Monitoring Plan is a continuation of research started by UMaine researchers in 2009.\n\nThe study was designed to capture tidal, seasonal and spatial variability in the presence of fish in the area of interest (near the TidGen device deployment site). The design involved down-looking and side-looking hydroacoustic surveys during several months of the year, and examined the vertical distribution and relative abundance of fish at the project and a control site in Cobscook Bay. Pre-deployment data were collected in 2010, 2011, and early 2012, and post-deployment data were collected from August 2012 through July 2015. In 2015 UMaine’s Fish Assessment Study Team completed research related to marine life interaction data around the OCGen Module deployed in 2014. In 2016 and 2017 UMaine’s Fish Assessment Study Team continued processing, analyzing, and interpreting data collected at the Project site in 2012-2015.\n\nHydroacoustic data found variable fish densities and vertical distributions across diel and tidal cycles. The OCGen hydroacoustic surveys indicated that there was a significant decline in fish density closer to the turbine beginning approximately 140 m from the free-spinning OCGen prototype device. Noise and natural flow patterns appeared to be the most plausible explanations for the observed patterns in fish behaviour. Single devices spanning a small prorportion of a channel are not expected to generate avoidance behaviors that may significantly delay or reduce overall fish passage. Hydroacoustic studies provided additional confirmation that a single turbine is unlikely to result in more than negligible impacts to fish communities.\n\nCompleted"
