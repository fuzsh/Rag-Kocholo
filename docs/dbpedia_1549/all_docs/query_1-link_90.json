        "text": "CD Projekt claims itâs sold a further five million copies of Cyberpunk 2077 since its release on December 10.\n\nThat brings the total sales to around 13 million copies, according to the developerâs digital and physical sales data.\n\nCDPR said the figures included sales across all platforms and factored in returns to retailers and refund requests sent directly to itself via email. It did not say how many refunds had been issued.\n\nCD Projekt had previously announced 8 million Cyberpunk 2077 sales, based purely on pre-orders.\n\nThe latest figures follow a turbulent few weeks for the much-anticipated open-world game, which has seen refunds issued and the game pulled entirely from the PlayStation Store due to its highly criticised performance on consoles.\n\nCyberpunk 2077âs troubled launch has resulted in CD Projekt shares tumbling over the past week and wiping over $1 billion off the wealth of the companyâs founders.\n\nHowever, despite its difficulties, Cyberpunk 2077 has enjoyed a very successful launch in terms of sales, with its 13 million copies sold representing one of the strongest debuts ever for a premium game.\n\nâEssentially the disclosure was made to reassure investors that the game still had a record-breaking launch despite the controversy,â commented Daniel Ahmad, Senior Analyst at Niko Partners. âIt’s certainly up there with RDR2 and the top Call of Duty titles.â\n\nCD Projekt will likely be concerned, however, by a pair of potential class-action lawsuits over its alleged misrepresentation of Cyberpunk 2077.\n\nOne Warsaw-based law firm and CD Projekt investor has announced itâs analysing grounds for legal action on the basis of âmisrepresentation in order to obtain financial benefitsâ.\n\nA second, New York-based law firm also announced an investigation into the Cyberpunk developer last week.\n\nWolf Haldenstein Adler Freeman & Herz LLP said itâs looking into potential securities claims on behalf of shareholders, âresulting from allegations that CD Projekt may have issued materially misleading information to their shareholders and investing public.â\n\nSpeaking to investors in a web call this month, CD Projektâs joint-CEO Adam KiciÅski apologised for Cyberpunk 2077âs console issues and said that the company hoped to rebuild the trust of its fanbase.\n\nâAfter 3 delays, we as the Management Board were too focused on releasing the game,â he said. âWe underestimated the scale and complexity of the issues, we ignored the signals about the need for additional time to refine the game on the base last-gen consoles.\n\nâIt was the wrong approach and against our business philosophy. On top of that, during the campaign, we showed the game mostly on PCs. This caused the loss of gamersâ trust and the reputation that weâve been building through a big part of our lives.\n\nâThatâs why our first steps are solely focused on regaining those two things. We are concentrated on fixing Cyberpunk on last-gen consolesâ¦ We will do everything possible to prove that we stick to our values. We truly hope that our efforts will let us rebuild the trust we have lost.â"
