Stevens, an intellectual leader whose selfless devotion to graduate students as teacher, advisor, mentor, and friend had a profound impact on the field.

Regional scientists apply theoretical and empirical frameworks and methods of the social and other sciences, as well as develop new ones specifically for regional analysis and policy. Eligible students should have completed all degree requirements except for their dissertation by the time the fellowship commences. A requirement of the fellowship is that the recipient has no duties other than dissertation research during the fellowship, although the recipient may hold other fellowships concurrently. Applications from students working in any area or any PhD program are welcome as long as their dissertation research addresses a research question in regional science. The fellowship consists of a stipend in the amount of $30,000, paid over a twelve-month period.\n\nYear in school: Doctoral\n\nAward type: Research Funding Doctoral, Dissertation Completion\n\nFocus area: Unspecified\n\nCitizenship: Non-US Citizen, US Citizen, Permanent Resident\n\nLocation: Domestic, International\n\nSimilar fellowships:\n\nDolores Zohrab Liebmann Fund Fellowship\n\nNational Defense Science and Engineering Graduate Fellowship\n\nSchmidt Science Fellows\n\nBenjamin H.
