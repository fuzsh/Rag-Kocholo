The regulator has requested a report from the publisher explaining the reasons that led to the problems with the game. It also intends to find out how the company is working on patches and what it is doing to reimburse the dissatisfied customers.\n\nDominik Jędrzejko, attorney-at-law and partner at Kaszubiak Jędrzejko Adwokaci, believes that hotfixes and refunds might not adequately remedy the alleged unfair practices. In that case, the authority may impose a fine of up to 10 percent of the company’s revenue."
