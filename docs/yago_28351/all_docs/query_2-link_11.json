        "text": "From Carignan to Catherine, the unlikely and somewhat complicated history of a much misunderstood grape.\n\nI'm not going to lie, almost everyone I know loves a good yarn about the Tudors; and although Catherine of Aragon, first wife of Henry Viii, is indeed where we'll end up, it's a bit of a roller coaster ride to get there. Let's start with the history.\n\nThe house of Aragon as we know it today, kicks off in 1035 when Ramiro I marries Ermesinda of Bigorre, and immediately forms a tether between modern day Catalonia and Languedoc Roussillon as Ermesinda was the daughter of the count of Foix. This nascent dynasty phase, known as the Jimenez dynasty further reinforced links to France by marriage, including Felicia ( a Picard ) and Agnes of Aquitaine. At this point, our hero - carignan - is growing happily across modern day Catalonia, notably around Carineña in the commune of Zaragoza.\n\nWe then enter the era known as the House of Barcelona, and for Carignan, this is where things get interesting. Further marital entrenchment follows, with marriages to Maria of Montpellier, Blanche of Anjou and Margaret of Prades. I must admit I had an ironic chuckle when I found out the marriage of Alfonso III of Aragon to Eleanor of England was childless much like poor Catherine of Aragon 300 years in the future - is turn around fair play ? In any case, the royal line carried on by virtue of Alfonso's brother, James II (1291-1327) who cranked out an impressive 10 offspring with Blanche of Anjou, and managed to conquer Sardinia at the same time. Dynastic marriages by Peter III and IV brought Sicily into the fold, and as the Aragonese kingdom became a major Mediterranean force, it took its culture - and its vines - with it. In Sardinia, carignan also got a name change - sort of - admittedly Carignano isn't a stretch, but it is also known as Bovale Grande. If you happen to find yourself in a caviste or restaurant with Carignano del Sulcis DOC (Sicily) I would heartily recommend you give it a go !\n\nBy 1412 we've switched dynasties again, out goes the House of Barcelona, and in comes the House of Trastamara. Exceedingly complicated circumstances linked the crowns of Sicily and Naples, thus, by dint of the existing marital connections, the Aragonese now also became Kings of Naples. And yet despite over 400 years of dominance, it is this era which sees Spain become a vassal of the Holy Roman Empire. There are some wonderfully named Kings - Ferdinand the Honest, Alfonso the Magnanimous, John the Great ( ok not terribly inventive but still ) and then …\n\nYes, finally we get to the link to the Tudors ! Ferdinand The Catholic, marries Isabelle of Castille, and their daughter is… Catherine of Aragon, who, had Henry Viii not done the whole 'Break with Rome', would also have played a part in the end of a dynasty - funny how history works eh ?\n\nUnlike poor Catherine ( and Eleanor of England before here ), Carignan doesn't have an issue with fertility. It has the potential of high yields, and has for many years been associated with low quality, bulk wines churned out in tanker loads both in Spain, but more commonly, France. Thankfully, we are learning more and more about this somewhat maligned varietal, coaxing delicious wines out of old vines; benefitting hugely from the uniqueness of clonal mutations of carignan gris and blanc- ok, I'll say it again - When Languedoc does get the recognition so richly deserved by the new generation of winemakers who strive to put this region on the map, it'll be for a white.\n\nNow the wine world is seldom straightforward, and it loves its synonyms so Carignan is also known as Mazuelo (Rioja), Samso (Catualunya - just to add insult to intellectual injury, Samso is also a synonym for Cinsault) Gragnano and Bovale Grande (Sardinia) and even Pinot Evara (Portugal - despite it being no relation to any other Pinot).\n\nNomenclature aside, it's safe to say this late budding, late ripening varietal is happy in warm climates with extended growing seasons and therefore seems to be a good prospect for the future.\n\nI hope this spin around European history has whetted your appetite for a glass of Carignan, and let me know if there are other grapes you'd like me to tackle."
