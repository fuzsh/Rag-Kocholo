        "text": "SUCCESSORS OF ROME:\n\nTHE PERIPHERY OF FRANCIA,\n\n445-Present\n\nKings of the Asturias, Navarre, Leon, Castile,\n\nAragon, Portugal, Spain, England, Scotland, Ireland,\n\nGreat Britain, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Moravia,\n\nCroatia, Bohemia, Hungary, and Poland\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe historically central kingdoms of Francia, besides\n\nFrance proper (West Francia), were Lorraine, Burgundy, Lombardy (or Italy),\n\nthe East Frankish kingdom that became Germany, and\n\nthe Pope's domain, the Papal States (originally the Roman, i.e. \"Byzantine,\" Exarchate of Ravenna), centered on Rome.\n\nThese were all part of the Empire of Charlemagne. Lorraine was only briefly a separate kingdom and then became one of the Stem Duchies of Germany, ultimately to be divided between Germany, France, and the Low Countries. The Periphery of Francia thus means the surrounding kingdoms. These naturally fall into six groups.\n\nSpain, identified in Greek as ἡ Σπανία in the Doctrina Jacobi nuper baptizati, the British Isles, οἱ Βρεττανικοὶ νῆσοι, and the South of Italy, Ἰταλία, which were all originally parts of the Roman Empire (except for Ireland, Σκοτία, and northern Scotland),\n\nCatholic (and then Protestant) Eastern Europe,\n\nScandinavia, and\n\nthe Frankish Crusader kingdoms of \"Outremer,\" which came to include the mainland kingdom of Jerusalem, the island kingdom of Cyprus, and the Latin Emperors in Constantinople.\n\nOutremer (\"across the sea\") was a kind of colony, and a temporary one, of Francia. Mostly Orthodox or Islāmic in faith, it is culturally part of Islam or, in so far as it is recovered from the Islamic Conquest, part of Mediaeval Romania. As such, it is peripheral even to the periphery of Francia. All the parts of it ended up conquered by the Turks. However, the Franks were there because they remembered that the area had been part of Romania, thought of themselves as the proper heirs of Rome, and were intent on reversing the Islamic Conquest. They had agreed with the Emperor Alexius Comnenus in Constantinople that they would return former Roman possessions. No one really understood this to mean a place like Jerusalem, however, which had been lost for centuries. If it did mean Antioch, which recently had been Roman, even this was disregarded by the first Princes of Antioch. Today within Palestine, we now find the unique Jewish State of Israel, which seeks to undo, not just the Islamic Conquest, but the earlier Roman Conquest of Judaea.\n\nCulturally, the Periphery of Francia is distinguished by the same characteristics detailed for Francia, i.e. the original jurisdiction of the Bishop of Rome, the Pope (now considered the head of the \"Catholic Church,\" although the Orthodox Church of Constantinople\n\nEuropa est omnis divisa in partes tres, quarum unam Romaniam, aliam Franciam, tertiam Russiam. Europa1. Romania2. Constantinople 2. Francia1. Rome 3. Russia3. Moscow\n\nstill also calls itself Katholiké), the use of the Latin language and alphabet, etc. Some of these areas seem more peripheral than others. Spain became the center of European power in the 16th century, and Britain in the 19th. All the great wars of the 16th, 17th, 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries, however, originated in the Core of Francia and then drew in the Peripheral states. An exception to all this was when Scandinavia was the center, if not of European power, certainly of the most energetic of European events. That stretched from the 9th to the 11th centuries, the \"Second Dark Age.\" The Scandinavians of that period, Vikings (then Normans) in the West and Varangians, Βάραγγοι (then Russians) in the East, were still pagan, and their raids and conquests were a threat everywhere in Francia. Christianization in the 10th and 11th centuries largely brought the threat to a close, except for the more conventional conquests of the Normans and Russians.\n\nMy sources for all these tables are often given with the specific tables. A discussion of general sources is given under Francia.\n\nIndex\n\nThe Three Parts of Europe Introduction The Kings of Spain and Portugal, 718 AD-Present\n\nIslāmic Spain & the \"Moors\" Navarre & the Basques Counts of Aragón Counts of Castile El Cid, Rodrigo Díaz The San Fernando Valley The Reconquista, Marranos, & Moriscos Spanish & Portuguese Colonial Possessions\n\nCeylon, Portuguese Governors The Pillars of Hercules Aztec Tlatoani Viceroys of New Spain\n\nPesidents of Mexico Governors of Cuba\n\nPresidents of Cuba\n\nGovernors of New Mexico\n\nMount Dragon, by Douglas Preston & Lincoln Child, 1996 Dead Mountain, by Douglas Preston & Lincoln Child, 2023 Panorama of Trinity Site\n\nSpanish and Mexican Governors of Texas California\n\nJames Dean and Parkfield\n\nThe Incas Viceroys of Peru Viceroys of New Granada\n\nRepublic of Venezuela\n\nViceroys of the Rio de la Plata\n\nRepublic of Argentina\n\nThe Maya and the Kings of Tikal\n\nThe Mayan Calendar\n\nThe French Kings of Navarre\n\nThe Heiresses of Navarre\n\nSpain in Decline\n\nThe Captain Alatriste Books The Spanish Succession The Infanta Margarita Teresa\n\nKings of Portugal Counts of Barcelona Counts of Urgel, Pallars, & Ribagorza Dukes of Berwick, Alba, & Fitzjames, 1472-Present Patriarchs of the East Indies, the West Indies, & Lisbon Dictatorships and Afterwards Presidents of Portugal Prime Ministers of Portugal and Spain\n\nThe Kings of England, Scotland, and Ireland, 445 AD-Present\n\nScotia: Picts, Britons, & Scots\n\nThe Celtic Languages\n\nAnglo-Saxon England\n\nKings of Sussex Kings of Northumbria Kings of Essex Kings of Mercia Kings of East Anglia\n\nKENT, WESSEX, & IRELAND\n\nArchbishops of Canterbury\n\nKings and Princes of Wales\n\nCornwall Descent of the Tudors\n\nSAXONS, SCOTLAND, & IRELAND Kings & Lords of the Isles Earls of Orkney\n\nKings of York\n\nThe Danelaw Kings & Lords of Man Kings of Dublin SAXONS, NORMANS, PLANTAGENETS, SCOTLAND, & IRELAND Earls of Oxford\n\nThe Question of Shakespeare Earls of Pembroke & Carnarvon Lord Carnarvon\n\nThe English Varangians\n\nNova Anglia in the Crimea Written Out of History\n\nThe Origins of English Individualism The Cross of St. George The Lion in Winter, Eleanor of Aquitaine and Family, 1968 The Hundred Years War LANCASTER, YORK, TUDOR, STUART\n\nThe Wars of the Roses\n\nLords Lieutenant, Deputies, or Viceroys of Ireland, 1528-1922 The Great English Vowel Shift STUART, the PROTECTORATE, STUART\n\nStuart Genealogy\n\nBritish Coins before the Florin, Compared to French Coins of the Ancien Régime The Bank of England Dukes of Marlborough & Earls of Spencer, 1702/1765-Present\n\nThe Vanderbilts\n\nDukes of Buccleuch, Grafton, & St. Albans, 1663-Present Dukes of Berwick, Alba, & Fitzjames, 1472-Present Dukes of Devonshire, 1694-Present\n\nthe Mitfords\n\nIsaac Newton and the Earls of Portsmouth The Lords Byron HANOVER God Save the Queen Prime Ministers of Britain, 1721-present British Emperors and Viceroys of India, 1876-1947 (1858-1950)\n\nIndex of Princely States & Protectorates of British India British Coinage of India, 1835-1947 The Himalayan Realms, Nepal, Bhutan, & Sikkim\n\nThe Sun Never Set on the British Empire\n\nSir Richard Burton, 1821-1890 Rule Britannia Gibraltar Ceylon, British Governors Burma, British Governors British Governors of Cape Colony British Governors of Malta\n\nPresidents of Malta\n\nStraits Settlements\n\nGovernors of Singapore Sulṭāns of Johor, 1528-present Singapore, Prime Ministers\n\nHong Kong Kings of Tonga British Consuls and High Commissioners of Egypt British High Commissioners and Governors of Cyprus British High Commissioners of Palestine\n\nSAXE-COBURG-GOTHA, WINDSOR\n\nPrince Charles Prince William Meghan Markle Update: 2022;

Also, Spain underwent her own unique transformation in the trauma of the Islāmic conquest. The Visigoths were crushed and for almost three centuries a revived Christian kingdom, Asturias, could do little more than cling to the north coast and the northwest corner of Iberia. Nevertheless, more than one Christian state eventually organized and gradually reconquered the peninsula. Navarre (Navarra), Aragón, and Barcelona all began as march counties of Francia. Asturias/Galicia/León could claim direct succession from the Visigoths, while Castile (Castilla) was a march of León. There were at different times up to five different Spanish Christian kingdoms. These were all eventually consolidated. Portugal, which began as a county of León, was the only kingdom to ultimately maintain its independence of the rest of Spain. Spain was sometimes styled an \"empire.\" Ferdinand I and Alfonso VII of Castile were sometimes styled \"Emperor,\" but in Mediaeval Europe, the Popes regarded such a title as theirs to dispense, and no self-proclaimed emperors were going to get cooperation from the Church. In fact, Alfonso X of Castile was actually elected Holy Roman Emperor in 1257, but nothing came of it all. Alfonso never went to Germany, distracted by civil war (1275) and rebellion (1282), and it was already clear that the Pope had no intention of crowning him. When the Pope finally crowned Emperor a King of Spain, it was Charles V (Charles I of Spain), a 1/4 German Hapsburg who had been born and raised in Belgium. The Imperial crown then passed to Charles's brother Ferdinand of Austria, not to his son Philip II of Spain. [cf. J.H. Elliott, Imperial Spain, 1469-1716, Mentor, 1963; Adam Wandruszka, The House of Habsburg, Anchor Books, 1965; Denys Hay, Europe in the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Centuries, Longmans, Green and Co. Ltd., 1966; and, more recently, Henry Kamen, Empire, How Spain Became a World Power, 1492-1763, HarperCollins, 2003.]\n\nAn issue of note concerns the name \"Spain\" -- España. The entire peninsula can be called, in a geographical sense, without ambiguity, Iberia. Similarly calling the whole peninsula \"Spain,\" however casually, can evoke impassioned responses. Spain now is a country that is distinct from Portugal. On the other hand, in Latin, Hispania was the whole peninsula. In the Middle Ages, when various kingdoms occupied Iberia, and none of them was España, they all collectively and reasonably were called the \"Spains,\" Hispaniae. When the Kingdoms of León, Castile, and Aragón, and then Navarra, came under common rule, the combination began to be called, unofficially but reasonably, \"España.\" The battle cry of 16th century Spanish troops was \"Santiago, España!\" (the former referring to the pilgrimage site of Santiago de Compostela in Galicia). It may have been Philip II who issued the first decree for \"these realms of Spain.\" As it happens, this was issued from Lisbon after Philip claimed the Throne of Portugal in 1580 and occupied the Kingdom. So the official use of \"Spain\" seems to have initially and in fact been for the whole peninsula. When Portugal revolted and became independent again in 1640, the rest of the Kingdom simply continued, down to the present, under the common name. So what \"Spain\" means actually depends on what we are talking about and when. It has only really meant a political part of Iberia since 1640.\n\nAnother issue is with the names of the Kings. Since the major languages of Christendom use many of the same names, it is often possible to give translations. This was formerly the most common, so that in English one talked about \"Johns\" and \"Peters\" in the Spanish Kingdoms. This is now sometimes frowned upon, but the desire to use the \"native\" language of the country in question can produce some gaffs: One occasionally sees Kings of Portugal called \"Juan,\" when this is actually just the Spanish, not the Portuguese, version of \"John\" -- that would be \"João\" -- which differs dramatically from the Spanish name, not just in the nasalized vowel, but in that the \"j,\" which is an aspiration in Spanish, is in Portuguese like the \"z\" in English \"azure.\" Since there are other languages in the Iberian Peninsula -- Catalan, Basque, and Galician -- besides standard (Castilian) Spanish and Portuguese, it is often a good question just what vernacular language was being used in a particular time and place. There is also the complication that the Kings of Navarre marry into French Royalty and nobility and so after 1234 are all French speaking. The written langugage during much of the period, of course, would just be Latin.\n\n\"John\" is \"Juan\" in Castilian, \"Xoán\" in Galician, \"Ion,\" \"Yon,\" or \"Jon\" in Basque, \"Joan\" in Catalan, \"Jean\" in French, and \"Johannes\" in Latin (another form, \"Iban,\" only occurs in the patronymic \"Ibañez\"). Simply using \"John\" would seem to be the least confusing and the most revealing. However, Portuguese and Spanish (Castilian) versions are given for most of the names (somewhat irregularly). Some names -- \"Alfonso\" and \"Sancho\" -- really do not have English equivalents. Sancho, the name of many Kings of Navarre, is written \"Santxo\" in Basque and may in fact have originally been a Basque name, though its origin in now obscure (\"Santius\" was the Latinized version). Other Basque or probable Basque names are \"García,\" \"Ezquerra,\" \"Ibarra,\" \"Echeverría,\" etc. \"Alfonso\" becomes \"Alphonse\" in French, and this has been borrowed into English to an extent, but it is not very common, so \"Alfonso,\" like \"Sancho,\" is simply given in its Spanish form. Sometimes overlooked, again, is that the Portuguese, \"Afonso,\" is different. Equally Spanish is a derivative of \"Elizabeth\": \"Isabel\" or \"Ysabel.\" This Latinized as \"Isabella,\" which is the form of the name usually used in English. There is a problem with the English equivalent for Castilian \"Juana,\" the feminine form of \"Juan.\" Although this is simply \"Jeanne\" in French, \"Jone\" in Basque, or \"Johanna\" in Latin, in English it could be \"Joan,\" \"Joanna,\" \"Joanne,\" \"Jane,\" or even \"Jeanne.\" \"Ferdinand\" and \"Fernando\" are both of Spanish derivation, originally \"Ferdinando.\" This was itself Visigothic, and the form now most familiar in English, \"Ferdinand,\" is the version of the name as it passed into German with the marriage of Juana the Mad of Castile to Philip of Hapsburg. One of their sons was then the Emperor Ferdinand I. He was raised in Spain, speaking Spanish. His grandfather, Ferdinand II of Aragón, contemplated leaving the kingdom of Aragón to him in his will but thought better of it. Later, he was given the rule of Austria by his brother. Elected king of Hungary and Bohemia, he then succeeded his brother as Emperor.\n\nHis brother, of course, was the Emperor Charles V. It is \"Charles\" in French and English, \"Carlos\" in Spanish and Portuguese, \"Carolus\" in Latin, and \"Karl\" in German. The story about Charles is that he only spoke German to his horse. He was raised at the court of his grandfather, the Emperor Maximilian I, in the Netherlands, speaking Flemish, where his name would be, I think, \"Karel,\" as in Dutch. Indeed, he is often called \"Charles of Ghent.\" There is a monument to Charles V in Guadalajara, Mexico. It actually calls him \"King Charles V\" (\"Rey Carlos V\"), which is not quite right since, as King of Spain, he was Charles I. All this seems to confuse everybody.\n\nThe colors here go with the kingdoms, but as the kingdoms combine, the color of the dominant kingdom supersedes the others. Thus yellow, the color for Castile (which started as a County of León, was detached by Sancho the Great of Navarre, and then was willed to his son Ferdinand I as a separate kingdom), is also the color for Spain as a whole, as Castile absorbs León, Aragón, and then, briefly, Portugal. A minor variation is that the red is darker for the Kingdom of the Asturias, of which León was essentially a continuation. The change in name took place after one of the characteristic divisions and then recombinations, several of which we see later, between brothers, sometimes brothers who become hostile and murderous to each other.\n\nThe Islāmic rulers of Spain, 756-1492, are listed separately from this page, with the other rulers of Islām, linked in the table at right. The first three hundred years after the Islāmic Conquest were tough times, naturally, for Christian Spain, which took quite a while to even get organized in some areas -- we only get a monarchy in Navarra more than a century after the Islamic Conquest.\n\nThe Omayyad Amirs, 756-912 The Omayyad Caliphs, 912-1031 The Mulūk at-Tawāʾif, 1010-1114\n\nThe Jahwarids of Cordova Murcia The ʿAbbādids of Seville The Ḥammūdids of Málaga The Zīrids of Granada Afṭasids of Badajoz The ʾĀmirids of Valencia The Dhu-n-Nūnids of Toledo The Banū Mujāhid of Denia and Majorca The Tujībids of Saragossa The Hūdids of Saragossa\n\nThe Murabit (Almoravid) Sulṭāns, 1067-1147 AD The Mulūk at-Tawāʾif, 1145-1266\n\nCordova Valencia Murcia The Banū Ghāniya of Majorca\n\nThe Muwahid (Almohad) Caliphs, 1147-1238 The Naṣrid Sulṭāns of Granada, 1238-1492 AD\n\nThe Hūdids of Murcia\n\nThese years were largely those of the Omayyad Amirs and Caliphs, who may be said to have presided over the Golden Age of Islāmic Spain. The suprisingly rapid decline of the Omayyads in the 11th century quickly led to complete political fragmentation and to grave vulnerability to the rising Christian Kingdoms.\n\nIt should be noted that although Spanish Christians later referred to all Spanish, and also North African, Moslems as \"Moors,\" this lumps together ethnically and linguistically distinct peoples, particularly those who were actually Arabs and those who were of North African Berber derivation -- Mauri, indeed, was the Roman name for Berbers (which itself is from barbari, \"barbarians,\" Greek βάρβαροι), evident in the name of the Roman province of Mauretania. There was sometimes tension and conflict between these groups in Islāmic Spain, as we might imagine.\n\nSometimes Spanish chroniclers distinguish Spanish Moslems as \"Ishmaelites\" and North African Moslems as \"Moabites,\" drawing on Biblical references. Since Spanish Moslem rulers frequently mated with native Spanish women, usually taken as slaves, their ranks came to consist of less and less Arab or Berber blood and more and more Spanish, Celtic, German, i.e. \"white\" DNA. It has been calculated that the Spanish Omayyad Caliph Hishām II (976-1008, 1010-1012) was only 0.09% Arab.\n\n\"Moors\" also would mean native Spaniard converts to Islām, the , Muwalladūn (\"brought up, raised,\" especially among Arabs or new to the language), Muladíes in Spanish or Portuguese, Muladites in Catalan. If one then considers sub-Saharan black African Moslems as \"Moors,\" like Shakespeare's Othello, this adds another group, one that would have been noticeable in North Africa but probably of somewhat lesser significance in Spain.\n\nTo many people, however, \"Moor\" always means \"black\" -- Othello, said to be a \"Moor of Venice,\" is played by a black actor -- and this is a serious confusion. Berbers might look pretty dark to Europeans, but they are easily distinguished from the African slaves brought north across the Sahara by the Arab slave trade. Indeed, a factor in the 11th century in Spain were slave troops, like the Mamlūks in Egypt or Janissaries in the Ottoman army, the , Ṣaqāliba (\"Slavs,\" singular , Ṣaqlab; which looks like the word \"Slav\" or \"slave\" itself, i.e. Latin Sclavus/Sclavenus or Greek Σκλαβηνός), that consisted, not of Africans, but of captives from Christian Europe (i.e. \"Slavs\").\n\nHowever, when the Almoravids arrived in Spain and attacked King Alfonso VI at Sagrajas, they had a corps of 4000 black slave troops, who at the height of battle attacked the Christians naked, with \"light blades, spears, and hippo-hide covered shields\" [Raymond, Ibrahim, Defenders of the West, The Christian Heroes Who Stood Against Islam, Bombadier, 2022, p.71]. But this did not become a feature of Andalusian armies.\n\nAlso confusing is the tradition of calling Christians in Islāmic Spain \"Mozarabs\" (Spanish Mozárabes, Protuguese Moçárabes, Catalan Mossàrabs), , Mustaʿrabūn, \"Arabized,\" which seems a little odd applied to those who did not convert to Islam, although it may address the phenomenon of Christians who learned Arabic or adopted Arab dress.\n\nThus, unless one is deliberately speaking of what Christian Spain called Moslems, \"Moors\" is not a term that is revealing of historial realities or appropriate for disinterested and objective historical discourse -- although I find, not just universal popular discourse, but even historians carelessly calling all Spanish Muslims \"Moors\" as though this is a meaningful category for those unfamiliar with the demographic realities of Islāmic Spain.\n\nWriting about Shakespeare's Othello in the November 5/6, 2016 Wall Street Journal [\"England's Muslim Monarch,\" C6], Yale historian Alan Mikhail says, \"He is called a Moor, thus both black and a Muslim.\" Shakespeare may have accepted this easy equivalence, but an academic historian should not be repeating it without a qualification and a caution. Yet this is typical; and I cannot remember a single popular reference to \"Moors,\" in print or television, fiction or documentary, that bothers to clarify the populations of Muslims in Spain or North Africa. This seems to be a point about which literally no one in a responsible position cares.\n\nNavarre, which is perhaps known too generally by the French version of its name, was originally a kingdom of the Basques, an apparently autochthonous people whose language has no demonstrable affinities to any other in the world, much less to any in the area. Thus, \"Basque\" in Basque is Euskara, and the Basque speaking country, which extends beyond Navarre, is Euskal Herria. Interesting genetic information about this is reported by Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza in Genes, Peoples, and Languages [University of California Press, 2000]. The Basque region turns out to be the center of a characteristic gene component of European populations. Cavalli-Sforza says:\n\n...the Basques once inhabited a much larger territory than today... During the last Paleolothic period the Basque region extended over almost the entire area where ancient cave paintings have been found. There are some cues [sic, \"clues\"?] that Basque descends from a language spoken 35,000 to 40,000 years ago, during the first occupation of France by modern humans... The artists of these caves would have spoken a language of the first, preagricultural Europeans, from which modern Basque is derived. [pp.120-121]\n\nThus, neither the French nor the Spanish -- Navarra -- version of the name of the kingdom is necessarily more correct than the Basque version, Nafarroa. While Navarre was the dominant Spanish kingdom under Sancho the Great, its power and extent declined quickly and decisively. Of the seven Basque provinces in Spain, without about 700,300 speakers, and France, with about 51,200 speakers, only two ended up belonging to Navarre proper. I have not noticed Basque nationalists claiming to have invented art (i.e. the cave paintings), but they apparently would have as reasonable a claim as anyone.\n\nIslamic Conquest of Spain, Visigoths Overthrown;\n\nBattles of Jerez de la Frontera & Ecija,\n\nCordova captured, 711; Seville & Toledo captured,\n\n712; Battle of Segoyuela, Saragossa (Zaragoza)\n\ncaptured, 713; Valencia captured, 714 Kings of Asturias,\n\nat OviedoArabs stopped in\n\nFrancia, Battle of\n\nPoitiers, 732 Pelayo, Pelagius718-737 Arabs stopped, Battle\n\nof Covadonga, 718 Favila737-739Basques,\n\nKings of Navarre,\n\nNavarra, Nafarroa Alfonso I, the Catholic739-757 Fruela I, the Cruel757-768 Aurelio, Aurelius768-774Charlemagne\n\ndefeated at\n\nRoncesvalles, 778 Silo774-783 Mauregato,\n\nMauregatus783-788Iñigo JimenezCount,\n\nd.822?

Also, the double names of these Kings mean that there is some variety in which names get numbered. Two numbers are thus given for several Kings. \"Garcés\" sometimes is seen as \"Gárces.\"\n\nThe names of the early Kings of Navarre, like those of the early Basque Dukes of Gascony, display the active use of the patronymic suffix -ez/s. This later becomes conspicuous in Spanish and Portuguese surnames, but here bespeaks Basque derivation -- like the names with which it is used, viz. Sancho (Santxo) and García. The origin of these names is controversial; but my suspicion is aroused for any Spanish name of uncertain origin that nevertheless occurs, with its patronymic, exclusively in the names of undoubtedly Basque rulers.\n\nEvery single northern County, which leads to Spanish kingdoms, begins with a lineage that displays the Basque patronymics. Thus Castile comes from Nuño/Nuñez, Aragón from Aznar/Aznarez, and Navarre from Jimeno/Jiménez (Ximénez). In the mix, we then get Galindo/Galindez, Iñigo/Iniguez, García/Garcés, and Sancho/Sánchez. Other good examples, like Fernando/Fernandez, clearly come from non-Basque sources. But there also are some surprises. The common Spanish surname Gómez, which looks like an orphan patronymic, actually derives from a name in Old English, goma (or guma, \"man, lord, hero\"), which survives, rarely, as the archaic surname \"Gomme\" in English. The internationalism of Mediaeval civilization (thanks to the Catholic Church and the Latin language) is what can catch us by surprise. Visigothic names (\"Rodrigo\") in Spanish we can understand, but a wandering English name is startling, especially after language issues get politicized.\n\nAfter recounting all the Basque patronymics of Castile, Aragón, and Navarre, it is then striking that the lineages of the Asturias are entirely innocent of such forms. We can see the claim of the Kings of the Asturias that they are derived from the Visigoths as supported by this. If they were Basques themselves, we would expect some of the patronymics. At the same time, this is evidence that the patronymics are Basque in origin. Eventually, by intermarriage, the Basque forms, with Basque names, work their way into the Kingdoms of León, Galicia, Castile, and the rest. They become the common heritage of Spain in general.\n\nThe genealogy here was originally derived from Volume III of the Cambridge Medieval History, based on the text where the diagrams [pp.716-717] unaccountably differ. Also, the text refers to the daughter of Sancho García of Castile who marries Sancho III of Navarre as \"Mayor\" [p.687], even though the diagram calls her \"Elvira\" and \"Mayor\" is elsewhere given in the text as the heiress of Ribagorza [p.690]. Now, according to the Erzählende genealogische Stammtafeln zur europäischen Geschichte, Volume II, Part 1, Europäiche Kaiser-, Königs- und Fürstenhäuser I Westeuropa [Andreas Thiele, R. G. Fischer Verlag, Third Edition, 2001], \"Munia Mayor\" was both the daughter of Sancho I García and the heiress of Ribagorza, while Sancho III had no other wife. (An Elvira is shown as a sister of Sancho García who married Vermundo II of León.) The earlier part of this genealogy, including the Counts of Aragón and Castile, has now been constructed from the Stammtafeln. One drawback of that source is that Thiele doesn't give the diacritics or the full patronymics for many names.\n\nNavarre became the suzerain of Aragón in the 9th century. After some intermarriage, the county was united to Navarre in 971 (or 970). Because of this process, different events sometimes are referred to by different sources. Thus, Bruce R. Gordon says that Navarre acquired Aragón \"c.850,\" but The New Penguin Atlas of Medieval History says 970 (p.50, note 2). The New Cambridge Medieval History, Volume III, c.900-c.1024 [Timothy Reuter, editor, Cambridge, 1999] gives the details [p.689, with the year 970, but then the year 971 on p.717]. There are other uncertainties about this period. While the picture in Gordon is that the Asturias was divided among three sons of Alfonso III, ultimately with all inherited by Alfonso IV, The New Cambridge Medieval History, Volume II, c.700-c.900 [Rosamond McKitterick, editor, Cambridge, 1995, p. 863] and Volume III [p. 716] list Ordoño II and Fruela II as successive Kings of León after Garcia. The details are given in Volume III [pp.674-675]. The independent (rebellious?) kingdoms in Galicia are the confusing factor. In this period the capital of the principal kingdom was moved from Oviedo in Asturias to Zamora and then, perhaps by Ordoño II, to León, which now gives its name to the whole.\n\nCounts of Aragón Aznar I Galindez? García the Badd.858 Galindo I Aznárez858-c.867 Aznar II Galindezc.867-c.893 Galindo II Aznárezc.893-922 AndregotoCountess,\n\n922-972 annexed by Navarre, 971\n\nThe problem of the annexation of Aragón gets muddied a bit further. The heiress of Aragón, Andregoto (seen elsewhere as \"Andregoro\"), is shown dying in 972, which looks close (at least) to the dates given by the Cambridge History and the Penguin Atlas. However, Andregoto's husband, García II Sánchez of Navarre, already is given, without a date, as Count of Aragón because of his marriage. This is simple enough, but then García is said to have divorced (verstoßen) Andregoto circa 940. So did Andregoto remain Countess of Aragon despite the divorce? The 971 could then be the year that her son, Sancho II Abarca, inherited Navarre and so, perhaps, also Aragón.\n\nIt is notworthy that the lines of Asturias, Castile, and Navarre begin with simultaneous or alternating reigns of rival cousins or even in-laws, i.e. husbands of cousins. How this worked seems clearest in Asturias and most obscure in Castile.\n\nIn what follows, before Iberia settles down to just two Kingdoms again (Spain and Portugal), things get very complicated. This is where we get up to five independent Christian thrones -- six counting Barcelona -- not to mention the Moslem states. Thus, the table of rulers has been broken up into more convenient sections. Each section is preceded by maps of the period and followed by a family tree of the rulers. Navarre is given special treatment after the extinction of the Kingdom in Spain. It might be noted that after 1037, every ruler in Christian Spain is a descendant of Sancho III of Navarre.\n\nIt should be noted that the Kings of the Asturias, Galicia, León, Castile (Castilla), and Spain (España) share a common numbering, but that the Kings of Navarre, Aragón, and Portugal are all numbered independently. Thus, Sancho II of Navarre (970-994) is different from Sancho II of Aragón (1063-1094), Sancho II of Castile (1065-1072), and Sancho II of Portugal (1223-1245); but Alfonso IX of León (1188-1230) is numbered in succession to Alfonso VIII of Castile (1158-1214).\n\nCounts of Castile,\n\nCastilla, at Burgos Nuño Nuñez I899-c.909 Nuño Nuñez II914/15 Gonzalo Tellez903-929 Munio Fernandezc.921 Fernando Ansurez916-920,\n\n927-930 Gonzalo Fernandez930-932 Fernán(do) González932-970 García I Fernandez\n\nWhite Hands970-995 Sancho I García\n\nGood Laws995-1017 García II Sánchez1017-1028 annexed by Navarre, 1029\n\nFerdinand II of Aragón (1479-1516) becomes Ferdinand V of Castile and of Spain (united with his marriage to Isabella I of Castile). It is tempting to see Sancho III of Navarre as Sancho I of Castile (as he is Sancho I of Aragón), since he bestowed Castile as a kingdom on his son, Sancho II. But Castile was not until then a kingdom at all. It had previously been a march county of León. Sancho I of León (955-958) thus might be considered Sancho I of Castile instead, especially given the co-numbering of the Kings of León and Castile. Or, Sancho I might just be the previous Count of Castile, Sancho I of the Good Laws (995-1017), who can be seen in a list of Counts at right.\n\nThe following period sees the beginning of the Reconquista, the reconquest of Islāmic Spain by the Christian states. It is certainly a bad period for the native Moslem states. Their weakness and divisions make it possible for Alfonso VI of León and Castile to capture Toledo in 1085, the traditional beginning of the Reconquista.\n\nHowever, the alarm of ʾIslām at this turn drew in the Almoravids (Murabits) from North Africa, who then defeated Alfonso at Zallāqa in 1086, but without recovering Toledo. This therefore began a new era for Islāmic Spain as well as for Christian, since native Islāmic Spain was now unable to withstand the Christians on its own and became dependent on North African powers.\n\nEl Cid, Rodrigo Díaz\n\nThe confusions of the period become a source of great romance. When Alfonso VI of León, deposed by his brother, Sancho II of Castile, returned to power in Castile as well as León (1072), he took on many of Sancho's retainers, including one Rodrigo Díaz de Vivar (d. 1099).\n\nRodrigo came to fall out of favor, in part because he suspected Alfonso of having Sancho assassinated and, in Alfonso's coronation, made him swear three times that he had not had Sancho assassinated. This had to rankle, especially if Alfonso was indeed responsible.\n\nSo in 1081 Rodrigo was exiled and became a mercenary. Shunned by Alfonso's vassals, and other Christian princes, Rodrigo signed on with Yūsuf al-Muʾtamin, Rey de Taifa of Saragossa (1081-1083). When Alsonso took Toledo in 1085, this drew in the Almoravids, who badly defeated Alfonso at Zallāqa (Sagrajas) in 1086. This led to the recall of Rodrigo, who would never lose a battle.\n\nAfter taking Valencia in 1094, and defeating the Almoravids, who attempted to retake Valencia and to ambush Rodrigo on the march, he passed into legend as El Cid -- interestingly an Arabic title, , Sīd, \"lord, master\" (otherwise , sayyid) -- and the Campeador -- although \"El Cid\" is not attested before 1195. Alfonso lost serious battles to the Almoravids, but El Cid caused so much mayhem that the Muslims never sustained enough of a campaign to retrieve Toledo, the real goal of all their efforts. The most consistent Almoravid conquests were of the Muslim Reyes de Taifas.\n\nRodrigo had a son, Diego, who died in battle at Consuegra, 1097, where the Almoravids again defeated Alfonso VI. Rodrigo's daughter Christina married Ramiro of Navarre, and their son, Garcia V, inherited Navarre. His descendants would come to encompass all the royalty of Spain, down to the present.\n\nRodrigo's other daughter, Maria, married the son, Peter, of Pedro I of Aragón. Sometimes Peter is confused with his father and Maria is said to have married Pedro. However, her actual marriage was childless, as Peter died young. She remarried, to Ramon Berenger III of Barcelona (1086-1131). Berenger's heirs would be with his second wife, Dulcia I of Provence. They would inherit Aragón.\n\nMaria died young, making way for Dulcia, but left a daughter, who is identified as \"Maria\" at Wikpedia but who is called \"Jimena\" by Andreas Thiele in the Erzählende genealogische Stammtafeln zur europäischen Geschichte, Volume II Part 1, Europäische Kaiser-, Königs, und Fürstenhäuser I Westeuropa [R.G. Fischer Verlag, 2001, p.176]. There she is explicitly identified as the daughter of Maria Rodriguez and the grand-daughter of El Cid.\n\nWhere Wikipedia gives no marriages for \"Maria,\" in Thiele, for Jimena, we first have the marriage to the Count of Besalú and then, extraordinarily, to Count Roger III of Foix -- as we have been seeing in the chart at right. The Counts of Foix are followed by Thiele in Volume III, Europäische Kaiser-, Königs, und Fürstenhäuser, Ergänzungsband [R.G. Fischer Verlag, 1994, 2001, pp.166-171]. Since this leads to the marriage of Count Gaston IV to Leonora, Queen of Navarre, we are back to the Kings of Navarre who are already descendants of El Cid.\n\nThus, El Cid has modern descendants, but these are sometimes calculated in error through Pedro I of Aragón, rather than through Garcia V of Navarre. And now we see the further Odyssey of Maria's marriage after the death of Pedro's son. The present King of Spain, Philip VI, and much of European nobility are descendants of the Cid.\n\nWhile occupying Valencia, Díaz was allied with Pedro I of Aragón. As it happens, we have a charter issued by Pedro in 1100, written in Latin, but signed by him in Arabic! His name is prefixed with , which is the sign of the cross followed by Arabic rshm, which I have vocalized as rashm, meaning \"sign of the cross.\" (Pedro did not write any vowel diacritics here, but I have supplied them.) So Pedro, although signing his name in Arabic makes it clear that he is a Christian. The sign of the cross also follows his name.\n\nThe name itself involves a couple of obscurities. It is written \"Pedro son of Sancho.\" \"Son of\" is written as the familiar Arabic , ʾibn. In the Basque parts of Spain, which by Pedro's day are part of Aragon, the whole name would have been \"Pedro Sánchez,\" with the Basque patronymic. But this does not seem to be used in the old way, and I don't know if Pedro ever used it.\n\n\"Pedro\" itself is written , \"Bayṭraw.\" There are some anomalous features about the writing. Not too surprising is that \"e\" is written as \"ay\" and \"o\" as \"aw.\" Arabic does not have \"e\" or \"o,\" but the diphthongs come to be pronounced that way in spoken Arabic. Instead of \"d,\" we see the \"emphatic t,\" but we also see this in the Turkish word for \"nine,\" .\n\nThe underdots are a little confusing. A friend of mine suggests that the three visible dots are used to make a Persian \"p\" ( ). However, there are clearly two \"chairs\" for letters there, and if three dots belong to one, there are not enough dots to go around. So I see it as the Arabic \"b,\" with one dot -- this is not unusual, since Arabic doesn't have a \"p\" -- and two dots, written vertically for space, indicating the \"y\" in the standard diphthong.\n\nFinally, there is the final letter, which actually looks like , the Arabic letter for \"h,\" but with an extra stroke going from bottom left out to above right, which here, , I have put in red. Now, in Persian, \"h\" can be written to indicate the final vowel \"e\"; but that is not what we are looking for here. My belief is that this is an anomalous writing of Arabic \"w,\" , which fits the phonetic need more than anything else. It is as though the letter has been rotated 180o, to , which is not so odd.\n\n\"Sancho\" I read as , \"Shānjaw.\" Here we have, for some reason, \"sh\" used for \"s.\" We also get \"j\" instead of \"ch,\" which doesn't exist in Arabic. This reinforces the idea that a Persian letter has not been used in \"Pedro,\" since there is a \"ch\" in Persian ( ) that could have been used. Again, we have something odd at the end of the name, looking like nothing so much as the Latin letter \"d.\" I read this, as in \"Pedro,\" as a that has been rotated. The ligature of \"n\" and \"j\" has also been written a little unusually, with the chair turned up instead of down, as is now standard.\n\nThus, we see Pedro signing his entire name as . This is an extraordinary artifact of the day, in which the use of Arabic even among Christians was apparently not regarded as unusual or problematic. Yet Pedro signed in such a way as to make sure we knew he was a Christian. No Muslim is going to be be putting crosses all over the place, or adding a word that actually means to do that.\n\nKings of LeónKings of Navarre Vermudo/Bermudo III1027- 1037Sancho/Santxo III Garcés III the Great,\n\nSancho I of Aragón1000- 1035 Kings of\n\nCastileKings of\n\nAragónGarcía IV Sánchez III1035- 1054 1037- 1065Ferdinand/Fernando I the Great1035- 1065Ramiro\n\nI1035- 1063 1065- 1070,\n\n1072- 1109Alfonso VIKing of\n\nGaliciaSancho II1065- 1072Sancho IV1054- 1076 García1065- 1071,\n\n1072- 1073\n\nd.1094 1073-11091072-1109 1063- 1094Sancho II\n\nRamirez,\n\nSancho V of\n\nNavarre1076- 1094 captures Toledo, made capital of Castile, beginning of the Reconquista, 1085; but defeated by Almoravids, Zallāqa (Sagrajas), 1086; El Cid captures Valencia, defeats Almoravids, Cuarte, 1094; El Cid defeats Almoravids, Bairén, 1097; Almoravids defeat Alfonso, Consuegra, 1097; El Cid dies, 1099; Alfonso abandons Valencia, 1102 Counts & Kings\n\nof PortugalUrraca (married to Alfonso I of Aragón)1109- 1126Peter/Pedro I\n\n1094- 1104 Henry,\n\nbrother,\n\nOdo I of\n\nBurgundyCount\n\n1093- 1112Alfonso I el Batallador\n\n(co-ruled León & Castile, 1109-1126)1104- 1134 Afonso ICount\n\n1112- 1139Alfonso VIIGalicia,\n\n1112- 1126 King\n\n1139- 11851126- 1157occupation of Saragossa, 1118-1130 PortugalLeónCastileAragónNavarre\n\nFerdinand I's Kingdom of Castile and León was divided between his three sons: Sancho II received Castile, Alfonso VI, León, and a new Kingdom of Galicia was broken off León for García. However, Sancho II prevented García from taking up his kingdom and then proceeded to attack Alfonso VI. In 1070, Sancho actually defeated Alfonso and drove him into exile, reassembling the whole kingdom of Ferdinand I. But when Sancho was killed in 1072, the whole kingdom immediately fell to Alfonso, who maintained its unity by imprisoning García until his death. How Sancho was killed is still a matter of uncertainty. He seems to have been meeting an incursion from Alfonso in exile, but the death may have been one of betrayal than just of battle. Whether Alfonso was even present is variously represented.\n\nDaughters of Alfonso VI married men from Burgundy, but different Burgundies. His illegitimate daughter Teresa married a brother, Henry, of the Dukes of Burgundy, Hugh I and Odo I. Their son became the first King of Portugal. Alfonso's daughter Urraca, heiress of León and Castile, married Raymond, brother of Renald II, Count of Burgundy, i.e. ruler of the Free County, Franche Comté, of Burgundy. These domains and houses were completely independent of each other, with the Duchy of Burgundy a fief of France and its Dukes Capetian members of the French Royal Family, while the County was a fief of the Kingdom of Burgundy and its Counts members of the Italian House of Ivrea. These complexities are now lost as the history of Burgundy and its divisions are forgotten.\n\nIn the following period the Almoravid state, which began to weaken, is replaced and the position of Islāmic Spain is restrengthed by a new North African force, the Almohads (Muwahids), who came to Spain in 1147. This respite turns out to be relatively brief. The Christian Kingdoms are growing and occasionally can even cooperate. The Almohads were then crushed by King Alfonso VIII of Castille at Las Navas de Tolosa in 1212. They had abandoned Spain by 1229, and St. Ferdinand III of Castile and León began to roll up the heart of Andalusia, with Cordova falling in 1235 and Seville in 1248. This would leave only the Sultānate of Granada, in the difficult Sierra Nevada, as a remnant of Islāmic Spain.\n\nKings of PortugalKings of LeónKings of CastileKings of AragónKings of Navarre Sancho I1185- 1211Ferdinand II1157- 1188Sancho III1157- 1158Ramiro II1134- 1137Garcia V Ramirez1134- 1150 Alfonso VIII1158- 1214union with County\n\nof Barcelona, 1137 Queen Petronilla1137- 1173 capture of Saragossa, 1146, new capital of Aragón Afonso II1211- 1223Alfonso IX1188- 1230Alfonso\n\nII1173- 1196Sancho VI1150- 1194 defeat by\n\nMuwahids at\n\nAlarcos, 1195;\n\nvictory at\n\nLas Navas de\n\nTolosa, 1212Pedro II1196- 1213Sancho VII1194- 1234 Sancho II1223- 1245Henry I1214- 1217James/\n\nJaime I1213- 1276 1230- 1252St. Ferdinand III\n\nSan Fernando\n\nRey de España1217- 1252Thibault,\n\nTeobaldo\n\nI, of\n\nCham- pagne1234- 1253 capture of Cordova, 1235,\n\nSeville, 1248, Murcia, 1266capture of\n\nValencia, 1238Thibault,\n\nTeobaldo II1253- 1270\n\nThe failure of the male line of Aragón in 1137 left Queen Petronilla as the heiress. Her marriage to Raymond Berengar IV, Count of Barcelona (1131-1162), effected the union of the two domains. The arms of Aragón, with the four \"Moor's Heads,\" now comes to be replaced, over time, by the four red stripes on yellow of Barcelona. The Moor's Heads have been sufficiently forgotten that the region of Aragón in modern Spain still expected to use the four stripes -- which was then protested by Catalonian nationalists as proper only to Catalonia. Meanwhile, a version of the arms is used in Sardinia; and a brief Aragonese occupation of Corsica (1420-1453) had unaccountably come to associate the Moor's Head with that island, where it is still used.\n\nThe \"Chains of Navarre\" are supposed to have originated at the Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa. King Sancho VII of Navarre fought his way into the camp of the Almohad Caliph, Muḥammad ibn Yaʿqūb. The Caliph's tent was ringed with slaves chained together, but Sancho cut through the chains into the tent. The Caliph was able to flee, but we can imagine his alarm and humiliation. It may have been a bad sign for Islamic Spain, however, that the Caliph was hiding behind chained slaves rather than out leading his forces on the battlefield.\n\nThe marriage of Blanca of Navarre to Theobald of Champagne means that for a while the Counts of Champagne become the Kings of Navarre. Greater detail of that genealogy can be examined on the page for Champagne. What this leads to is examined further below.\n\nEleanor of England, who I do not show on the previous diagram, had ten (or eleven) children with Alfonso VIII of Castile. Of those that survived, one, Henry (Enrique), became the heir of Castile, introducing an French name (Henri) into Spanish royalty -- Henry II of England, after all, spoke French, not English -- while four daughters married other Kings and heirs. Three of those were in Spain, of León, Aragón, and Portugal. The other, with Blanca, was to the future King of France. This is a little hard to discern in the genealogy above, which is quite tangled. Abstracting and untangling the children of Eleanor, we see the marriages in the following diagram. The youngest daughter, Constance (Constantia), became a nun.\n\nThe most dramatic of these marriages may involve Blanca, who was chosen over her elder sister, Uracca (the eldest sister, Berenguela, was already married), by her grandmother, Eleanor of Aquitaine, and escorted by her to France. Because King Henry ended up childless, the Throne of Castile passed to Berenguela, who abdicated in favor of her son, Ferdinand, who was already the heir of León. Note that Henry married the sister of the husband, Afonso II, of Urraca. The sons of two of the daughters here become Saints: St. Louis of France and St. Ferdinand of Spain are first cousins -- they each have a California mission named after them (San Luis Rey de Francia and San Fernando Rey de España). Henry, however, dies from a falling roof tile, joining Pyrrhus of Epirus in that unusual fate. Note that the successor of James I of Aragón, Peter III, was from his second wife, Yolanda of Hungary.\n\nNot shown, another son and daughter, Sancho and Sancha, died in infancy, while another son and daughter, Ferdinand and Mafalda, died as young adults (both in 1211, aged 22 and 20, respectively). The existence of another son, Henry, is disputed.\n\nThe marriage of King Ferdinand III of León and Castile involves another group of daughters and their significant marriages. These are all the granddaughers of the Emperor Isaac II Angelus of Romania, through his daughter Irene Angelina, who married Philip of Swabia, a son of Frederick I Barbarosa. Only one marriage here, of the eldest Beatrice (to Otto of Brunswick), was without issue; and in fact all the others, involving Spain, Bohemia, and Lorraine, have living descendants.\n\nIn the following period the Reconquista is completed, and Spain, unified, becomes a World Power, perhaps truly the first such, as Spanish sailors circle the planet and claim most of it, with the claims sticking in much of the New World, the Philippines, and elsewhere -- even as the inheritance of the united Kingdom by the Hapsburgs made Spain a partner to the dominant political forces of Catholic Europe.\n\nOne detail noticeable on the maps but not thoroughly indicated in the table or genealogy below (but shown at right) is the temporary Aragonese Kingdom of Majorca, conquered from the Almohads and then left to a brother, James II, of Peter III. Eventually, Peter IV disposessed his cousin and returned the islands to Aragón (1343).\n\nMeanwhile, with the completion of the Reconquista, there was the nagging problem of the non-Christians, the Jews and Moslems, who were scooped up in the new possessions. There had already been forced conversions of Jews, both by Christians and by the Almoravids and Almohads. Some Jews, like Moses Maimonides (1135-1204), had seen the handwriting on the wall back then and left. Under Christian rule, however, many Jews had converted -- the Conversos. Christians suspected, sometimes correctly, that many Conversos were still secretly practicing Judaism. These were derisively called Marranos, perhaps derived from a Spanish word for \"swine\" -- although this may come from Arabic , muḥarram, \"forbidden\", because pork is forbidden by Islām (although, as also the taboo of holy things, the name of the first month of the Islāmic calendar). The Spanish Inquisition, run by the Spanish Crown with little reference to the Pope, in great measure was created to test the faith of Marranos, many of whom were burned at the stake or otherwise punished for the actual or suspected practice of Judaism.\n\nIn the fateful year of 1492, the religious problem was taken up a couple of notches. After a long and hard campaign, Granada surrendered, finishing the Reconquista. The last Sulṭān left for North Africa, but one condition of the surrender was religious toleration for Moslems. This was not going to last long, only until 1499. By 1502, Moslems of Granada were supposed to accept baptism or leave; and by 1526 this was the choice for the last Moslems of Valencia and Aragón. Those who remained and converted were the Moriscos (\"Little Moors\"), who thus joined the Marranos as suspected crypto-infidels. Muslims who refused to convert and left were Mudéjares. Muslims who did not convert and who tried to stay were Tagarinos. Openly Muslim mercenaries of Spain in North Africa were Mogataces (sing. Mogataz), although it would hardly seem to have been in their interest.\n\nMeanwhile in 1492, Ferdinand and Isabella decided to expel all unconverted Jews from Spain. Portugal followed suit in 1497 and Navarre in 1498. Jews went to North Africa, distant Turkey, the Netherlands, and other places. Those who remained and converted, of course, were now open to the tender investigations of the Inquisition. The greater threat to the regime, however, seemed to be the Moriscos, who continued to speak Arabic and retained their traditional garb and customs. They were occasionally ordered to stop and assimilate. These orders were generally ignored, but as the Spanish state strengthened, the threat became more serious. The enforcement of a 1566 (or 1567) order finally provoked a Revolt at the end of 1568. With the Turkish navy contesting the Mediterranean, and crypto-Moslem Moriscos calling for help, the Revolt became part of the larger confrontation with Islām that troubled Philip II. With much hard fighting, and even subsequent years of guerrilla actions, the Revolt was largely suppressed in 1570. Philip decided to remove the remaining Moriscos from Granada and scattered them throughout Spain. This ended their threat as a serious internal enemy, but it did not end their existence as a cultural and religious irritation.\n\nThe suspicion of Marranos and Moriscos by the Church and the Crown poisoned Spain for many years. In so far as the Moriscos were concerned, however, this didn't last too long, since Philip III decided in 1609 to expel them from Spain altogether, whether they were really Christians or not. This was accomplished by 1614, after which only the persecution of Marranos would continue. Many of them, rather than fleeing Spain altogether, moved to the Spanish colonies in the New World, where their exalted status over the Indians made their disabilities back home less conspicuous and significant. Astonishingly, even today some families surivive in New Mexico with the memory, passed down the generations, that they had once been Jews.\n\nFormer Jews, \"New Christians,\" in Spain itself, whether under suspicion or not, did not achieve equality for many years. Limpieza de sangre, \"purity of blood,\" laws kept them and their descendants excluded from universities and religious orders. These laws, which sound like nothing so much as the racial Nuremberg laws of Nazi Germany, were not repealed until 1865. They lasted longer than the Inquisition itself, which was abolished in 1834.\n\nPlan for the complete Basilica of\n\nSagrada Familia, Barcelona\n\nThe deliberate destruction of the Jewish and Moslem communities in Spain was no help to Spain either culturally or economically. The Arab historian Philip Hitti has said that Spain shone for a few years with a \"borrowed glory\" from its creative mediaeval communites, but then sank into the status of a cultural and political backwater. Well, it is understandable that an Arab historian might say this, but no one can consider classical Spanish literature or art and think of it as \"borrowed.\"\n\nWhere Spain failed to keep up with modernity was already predicted, in a sense, by Miguel Cervantes (1547-1616). A Spain whose arms failed, as they did in 1643, henceforth would play out the tragicomic life of Don Quixote. Nevertheless, unique brilliance and creativity still shine in the art of Francisco Goya (1746-1828), one of the greatest painters of all time. Even in the early 20th century, when Spain seemed the most behind the times, the brilliant architect, Antonio Gaudí (1852-1926) produced work at once uniquely Spanish and modern -- in an area of art, architecture, where most would think traditional Spanish forms particularly derivative of Islām. His amazing church of the Sagrada Familia in Barcelona (\"melting Gothic\"), still incomplete, brings Spanish Christian piety fresh into the 21th century, long after Gaudí's own death. Spain thus harmed, and shamed, itself with its intolerance, and wandered from the mainstream of modern development, but there it no doubt that its aesthetic and religious vision was powerful, autochthonous, and enduring.\n\nFor a good part of the following period the royal houses of Spain and Portugal, Trastámara and Avis, were both illegitimate. Also, John of Avis had an illegitimate son, the Duke of Braganza, who leads to the Kings of Portugal after Spanish rule is overthrown in 1640. Also noteworthy is the fact that Queen Isabella of León and Castile usurped the throne of her niece, Joanna la Beltraneja. Isabella's half-brother, Henry IV, was called \"the Impotent\" because this is what his first wife, Blanche of Navarre, said. He cannot have been completely impotent, however, since his second wife had Joanna. Later, although Joanna the Mad (Juana la Loca) is only listed as Queen until 1516, she was actually titular Queen until her death in 1555. But since Charles I (V) was both Regent and Heir, and Emperor, he is usually simply regarded as the de facto King.\n\nKings of PortugalKings of CastileKings of AragónKings of Navarre Afonso III1245- 1279Alfonso X, the Emperor, the Learned, the Wise1252- 1284Peter/\n\nPedro III1276- 1285Henry I1270- 1274 King\n\nof Sicily, 1282- 1285Jeanne/\n\nJuana I1274- 1305 Diniz/\n\nDinis1279- 1325Sancho IV1284- 1295Alfonso III1285- 1291Philip IV of France, I of Navarrejure uxoris\n\n1384- 1305 France,\n\n1385- 1314 Ferdinand IV1295- 1312James II1291- 1327Luis,\n\nLouis X\n\nof France1305- 1314 Sardinia ceded\n\nby Pisa, 1326France,\n\n1314- 1316 Afonso IV1325- 1357Alfonso XI1312- 1350Alfonso IV1327- 1336Philip II,\n\nV of\n\nFrance1314- 1322 Charles I,\n\nIV of\n\nFrance1322- 1328 the Black Death arrives at\n\nValencia & Seville, 1348 Peter/\n\nPedro I1357- 1367Peter the Cruel1350- 1366,\n\n1367- 1369Peter IV1336- 1387Jeanne/\n\nJuana II1328- 1349 Deposed by Henry of Trastámara, 1366; restored by Edward the Black Prince, 1367; killed by Henry, 1369Philip III,\n\nd'Evreuxjure uxoris\n\n1328- 1343 Ferdinand/\n\nFernando I1367- 1383Henry of Trastámara/\n\nEnrique II1366- 1367,\n\n1369- 1379 John/\n\nJoão I of Avis1385- 1433John/\n\nJuan I1379- 1390John/\n\nJuan I1387- 1395Charles II, the Bad1349- 1387 Henry III1390- 1406Martin the Elder, the Humane, II of Sicily1395- 1410Charles III, the Noble1387- 1425 Sicily, 1409-1410 Interregnum, 1410-1412 Edward/\n\nDuarte I1433- 1438John II1406- 1454Ferdinand IAragón & Sicily, 1412- 1416Blanche/\n\nBlanca1425- 1441 Alfonso V1416- 1458 King\n\nof Naples, 1442- 1458 Mission from Ethiopia, military alliance? 1427-1428 Afonso V1438- 1481Henry IV1454- 14741458- 1479John IIjure uxoris\n\n1425- 1479 Conquest of Gibraltar, 1462 John/\n\nJoão II1481- 1495Isabella/\n\nIsabel I1474- 15041479- 1516Ferdinand\n\nII;\n\nFerdinand V of Castile /\n\nSpain;\n\nFerdinand\n\nof\n\nNavarreEleanor/\n\nLeonora1479 fall of Granada, end of Reconquista, Discovery of America, 1492François Phébus/\n\nFrancisco\n\nFebo1479- 1483 Emanuel/\n\nManuel I1495- 1521Juana the Mad (d. 1555);\n\n& Philip I, of Hapsburg\n\n(d. 1506)1504- 1516Regent of Castile, 1510- 1516Catherine/\n\nCatalina1483- 1512,\n\nd.1517 Occupation by\n\nAragón, 1512- 1516 Defeat by Mamlūks, naval battle of Chaul, 1508; Mission from Ethiopia, 1509-1515; Embassy to Ethiopia, 1515-1520Charles/Carlos I of Spain/\n\nEmperor Charles V\n\n1516- 1556\n\nd. 1558 John/\n\nJoão III1521- 1557 Aid to Ethiopia to defeat Muslims, 1543Conquest of Mexico, 1519-1521; Sack of Rome, 1527;\n\nConquest of Peru, 1532-1572 Sebastian/\n\nSebastião I1557- 1578Philip/Felipe II of Spain/\n\nPhilip I of Portugal1556- 1598 Killed, battle of Alcácer Quibir in Morocco, 1578 Cardinal Henry/\n\nHenrique1578- 1580 1580- 1598 Default on Crown Debt, 1557; March of the Duke of Alba, 1567; Revolt of the Netherlands, 1568; Eighty Years War, 1568-1648; \"Sea Beggars\" capture Brill, 1572; relief of Leiden by William of Orange, 1574; Default on Crown Debt, 1575; mutiny of Spanish Army in the Netherlands, sack of Antwerp, 1576; British seize treasure galleon St. Ana off Acapulco, 1587; Default on Crown Debt, 1596 Philip III of Spain / Philip II of Portugal1598- 1621 Dutch seize Portuguese treasure carracks off Malacca & Macao, 1603; default on Crown Debt, 1607; Thirty Years War, 1618-1648\n\nA 2001 movie, Juana la Loca, was Spain's nominee for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Film. It did not make the final list of five nominees. It has been released with the English title Mad Love. As the story of Juana, it seems more than a bit inconsistent and confused. The narrator says than Juana was betrayed by her father, her husband, and her son. It is not subsequently clear from the story, on the other hand, how this is so. Her father, indeed, and her mother, arrange a dynastic marriage for her. If this is a \"betrayal,\" it cannot be in contemporary terms, when dynastic marriages are to be expected for royalty. Unlike many dynastic marriages, furthermore, this one involves real sexual attraction and passion. Philip \"the Handsome\" of Hapsburg is portrayed looking like he has jumped off the cover of a Romance novel, and he is so eager to bed Juana that he arranges for a priest's perfunctory blessing and doesn't even wait for the proper marriage to take place. Juana seems no less ardent, which indeed becomes the theme of the movie, as she is carried away by her passion. This seems to have some historical accuracy.\n\nHow Philip is supposed to have \"betrayed\" her is clear from the story, since he takes other lovers, which leads to serious jealousy on the part of Juana. However, the idea that a King would have mistresses in such an age would not be a surprise to anyone, especially when the Royal Houses of Spain (Trastámara) and Portugal (Avis) at the time were already illegitimate! If the movie takes this to be a genuine \"betrayal,\" its point of view is ahistorical and more than a bit silly. Meanwhile, the story undercuts its own claims with the portrayal of the irrationality of the manner in which Juana acts out her jealousy. When visited by a delegation of nobles, which wishes to investigate reports that the Queen is mad, Juana is unable to recollect herself long enough to deal with them in a sensible way. Instead, they are fully exposed to the foolish and erratic nature of her concerns. Her subsequent appearance before the Cortes of Castile, although impressive, can hardly undo the manner in which her mind previously betrayed itself.\n\nFinally, we never meet as an adult her son, Charles V, and are never given a clue how he will \"betray\" her, unless it is simply to treat her in a manner consistent with the insanity to which we have already been exposed. Also, we may be given to understand that her father has \"betrayed\" her by agreeing with Philip that she is mad, but then we are not told that Ferdinand denounced that agreement on the very same day. One of Juana's most striking lunacies, her unwillingness to give up Philip's decaying body for burial, is evaded -- altough we are shown her subsequently visiting his sarcophagus.\n\nOpinion now seems to be swinging to the view that Joanna was not mad at all. Charles kept her isolated as a virtual prisoner. However, at the time, this is how crazy people were treated. The cruelty of the treatment of King George III of Britain during his episodes of insanity is well portrayed in the movie The Madness of King George [1994]. So Joanna's treatment, however appalling, is not really evidence of her sanity. On the other hand, the initial stages of how she lost power, when she had her own retainers and supporters, is a little hard to understand unless her symptoms were evident and disturbing. If she was sane, then of course she was indeed \"betrayed,\" but there is a uniqueness to her case that makes the events extraordinary. There was resistance in Spain to the rule of \"foreigners,\" like Charles himself, so it seems unlikely to me that Joanna would simply have been overlooked if a native Spanish monarch was generally desired.\n\nMy final problem with the movie is minor but annoying. When Queen Isabella dies, a courier travels to Flanders to announce this to Juana. It is left to a lady in waiting to remind Juana that this means that she is now Queen of Castile. I find such a scene impossible to believe. Such a courier, aware himself that Juana is now Queen, would address her as such. Otherwise, he would be seriously guilty of lèse magesté. Such a scene in reality would be more like what we see in Elizabeth [1998] with Cate Blanchett, when the couriers kneal before Elizabeth, announce the death of Mary, and hail her as the new Queen -- with a drama fully commensurate with the ominous, even numinous, circumstances. We also see such a moment in The Young Victoria [2010], when Emily Blunt is first addressed as Queen. With Juana, the moment is more like, \"Oh, gee, I'm Queen now!\" as an afterthought. This does not inspire confidence in the fidelity of the rest of the movie to the mores of the times.\n\nIn this period Aragón grew into a Mediterranean power. The map at left summarizes the expansion of Aragón from the original Pyreneean County, a separate Kingdom in 1035, until its reach extends all the way to Naples and even Athens. The junior line of Majorca is given above. The lines for Sicily, Naples, and Athens are given on the separate pages for those realms, though the genealogy of Sicily and Naples is in the following table here. The most curious episode concerns Athens. A band of Aragonese mercenaries, the \"Catalan Company,\" mutinied against the Roman Emperor in 1305. Duke Walter of Athens hired them in 1310. They murdered him in 1311 and took over the Duchy. Between 1312 and 1342, the Duchy was ruled by three brothers of King Peter II of Sicily. Between 1342 and 1388, it was then ruled by the Kings of Sicily themselves. Just as Sicily was about to be inherited by Aragón itself, Athens passed to the control of the Acciaiuoli family. On the other hand, the most dramatic episode was the manner in which Pedro III acquired Sicily in the first place. This was the result of the revolt in 1282 of the \"Sicilian Vespers,\" by which the Sicilians rose up and expelled the French under Charles of Anjou. Since Pedro had married Constance, the daughter of Manfred, King of Sicily and Naples, who had been killed by Charles in 1266, he was invited in to be King of Sicily. The Pope was furious, but Realpolitik won out. Later, Alfonso V pressed a flimsy claim to Naples itself and won it by force (1442). He left the Kingdom to his illegitimate son Ferdinand (Ferrante), as Aragón passed to the legitimate heir, Alfonso's brother John. After Naples was occupied by the French, 1495-1496, John's son, Ferdinand II, ended up deposing his cousin and annexing the Kingdom to Aragón (1501).\n\nSpanish and Portuguse Colonial Possessions\n\nThe Pillars of Hercules\n\nKings of Navarre Catherine/Catalina1483-1517 John III d'Albretjure uxoris\n\n1484-1516 Expelled from Navarre by\n\nFerdinand II of Aragón, 1512 Henry II1517-1555 Charles V abandons\n\nBasse Navarre, 1530 Jeanne III1555-1572 Anthony de Bourbon\n\nDuke of Vendômejure uxoris\n\n1555-1562 Huguenot leader,\n\ndies of wounds, 1562 Henry III,\n\nHenry IV of France1572-1610 King of France,\n\n1589-1610\n\nThe family tree, above, of the rulers of Spain ends for Navarre with the marriage of Jeanne/Juana/Jone I to King Philip IV of France. This introduces an interesting but obscure chapter in history, straddling Spain and France and consequently tending to be left by treatments of Spain to French history, and by treatments of France to Spanish history. Before material was available on the Internet, I had some difficulty rooting things out from print sources.\n\nEspecially neglected is what happened when Ferdinand of Aragón annexed Navarre in 1512. Not all of it was ultimately retained by Spain, but readily accessible print sources didn't seem to show either the difference between the old and new boundaries or what happened to the rulers of Navarre after the annexation -- the table at right picks up at that point. This seemed like a grave oversight for the history of France. Jeanne I was already of the house of Champagne; female heirs of the line subsequently married four times into new houses of French nobility (Evreux, Foix, Albret, & Vendôme) and once to Spanish royalty (Aragón); and it all leads to Henry III of Navarre, who founded the Bourbon dynasty of France as King Henry IV in 1589.\n\nThe history of Navarre was obscure enough that I found the full genealogy only with recourse to a succession of more serious and complete print sources. The large genealogical chart, Kings & Queens of Europe, compiled by Anne Tauté [University of North Carolina Press, 1989], simply ended the line of Navarre with Jeanne I. For a long time, the only family tree I had seen of subsequent rulers was in Europe in the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Centures, by Denys Hay [Longmans, London, 1966, p.404], which ends with Queen Catherine, who lost the Kingdom to Ferdinand. Family trees for the Bourbons, such as given here, almost never went back further than the father, Henry, of Henry IV's mother Jeanne. Brian Tompsett's Royal and Noble genealogy originally enabled me to fill in the gaps, but there were some obscurities and questions in the information of both Tompsett and Hay that I had to compare with other sources.\n\nThe first complete list of the Kings of Navarre I found was in the Regentenlisten und Stammtafeln zur Geschichte Europas by Michael F. Feldkamp [Philipp Reclam, Stuttgart, 2002, pp.146-148]. A complete genealogy can now be found in the Erzählende genealogische Stammtafeln zur europäischen Geschichte, Volume II Part 1, Europäische Kaiser-, Königs, und Fürstenhäuser I Westeuropa, by Andreas Thiele [R.G. Fischer Verlag, 2001, p.185-192]. A less esoteric source with a complete list of kings is in the Oxford Dynasties of the World [John E. Morby, Oxford, 1989, pp.114-115], but there are only some notes, without a diagram, on the genealogy. All this, and more, is now, of course, available on line.\n\nThe most striking thing about the succession for Navarre is that the last Capetian Kings of France, Louis X to Charles IV, were all Kings of Navarre. John I sometimes doesn't seem to get counted as a King of Navarre, but then, only reigning five days, he is sometimes not even counted as a King of France -- on the other hand, it may be necessary to count him if the husband of Catherine is to be counted as John III of Navarre, which means that John II of Aragón was also John II of Navarre -- there was no earlier John (Jean/Juan) in Navarre to be John I, if not the Capetian.\n\nJohn's situation is peculiar. He was born postumously, soon died, and Philip II had already succeeded as King of Navarre. Since John had a superior claim to Navarre, Philip's reign would need to be interrupted. Since John II and John III of Navarre were both only Kings by marriage, all of the \"Johns\" of Navarre are somewhat anomalous.\n\nWith the death of Charles IV (Charles I of Navarre), a curious thing happens. The succession of France jumps to the House of Valois, but, as it happened, Louis X had a surviving daughter, Jeanne. She was ignored for the French Throne because of the Salic Law, which prohibited female succession, but the Salic Law did not apply to Navarre. So while the French Thone passed to Philip VI in 1328, the Throne of Navarre passed to Jeanne/Juana (II). This is a curiosity that I have never seen noted in histories of Europe.\n\nJeanne's son was Charles \"the Bad.\" A lengthy account of his doings can be found in Barbara Tuchman's A Distant Mirror [Ballantine, 1978], which is about the events of the 14th century. The County of Evreux, which he inherited from his father, was in Normandy, which means he spent a great deal of his life in intrigues very distant from the Pyrenees.\n\nThe intrigues involved playing both sides of the Hundred Years War against each other, trying absurdly to put himself forward as Pretender to France, encourging and then attacking popular uprisings, like the Jacquerie (1358), and then betraying each side in turn. This ended up making enemies of everyone, so that no one trusted him, and he lost control of most of his lands in France.\n\nHis death, however, may be the most \"bad\" thing about his life. Back in Navarre, which he barely knew, for some medical condition, he was being wrapped in alcohol soaked bandages every night. But one night the servant doing the wrapping dropped her candle, which ignited the wrappings. Since the wrappings had been sewn on, Charles had no chance of escaping the fire. He either burned to death at the time or lingered for a while, as we might imagine, in considerable pain. Many saw this as divine judgment against him. His son, Charles the Noble, stayed home and improved things for his Kingdom and Capital, turning more attention to Spain than to France.\n\nTwo generations later, we get to Queen Blanche/Blanca, who marries Spanish rather than French, namely the future King of Aragón, John II. After Blanche's death John remarries. He then outlives all of Blanche's children but one, Eleanor/Leonora. Aragón goes to a son, Ferdinand, by his second marriage, but Navarre passes to Leonora, who does not survive the year. Her husband, Count Gaston of Foix, and her son, Gaston also, both predeceased her, so the succession passes to her grandson, Francis Phoebus (François Phébus in French; Francisco Febo in Spanish), and then her granddaughter, Catherine/Catalina. Here I had a question, because Hay shows two Gastons in between Leonora and Catherine. This seemed to be a mistake, and I followed Brian Tompsett. I have now been able to confirm this with the Erzählende genealogische Stammtafeln zur europäischen Geschichte, Volume II Part 1, Europäische Kaiser-, Königs, und Fürstenhäuser I Westeuropa, by Andreas Thiele [R.G. Fischer Verlag, 2001, p.191].\n\nWhat Tompsett didn't have in his database was the young (23) Gaston (V) de Foix, Duke of Nemours, who was killed at the battle of Ravenna in 1512. Elsewhere on the Web, Gaston was listed as a son of Jean de Foix and a grandson of Gaston IV of Foix and Eleanore (Leonora) of Aragón. So I took it that Gaston and Leonora had at least two sons, though I had no sources that listed them both. Now, however, I do, since the Erzählende genealogische Stammtafeln [ibid., p.191] shows not only this, but that Gaston and Leonora had four sons and five daughters. Gaston's mother was Marie d'Orléans, a sister of King Louis XII of France.\n\nCatherine now married French nobility again, this time John of Albret. The two of them were doomed to suffer from the ambition of her cousin, Ferdinand of Aragón, who invaded Navarre in 1512, on the pretext that the death of Gaston de Foix in 1512 made him, by virtue of his marriage to Gaston's sister, Germaine (after the death of Isabella of Castile in 1504), heir of Navarre. This was totally bogus, but Ferdinand got the Pope to officially dethrone Catherine and John and certify the transfer. This was the kind of thing that earned Ferdinand the admiration of Machiavelli. In 1515 Ferdinand, who had joined Navarre to the Crown of Aragón, transfered it to that of Castile, lest the Navarrese claim the extra privileges enjoyed by the Aragonese.\n\nA small part of Navarre north of Pyrenees, Lower Navarre (\"Basse Navarre\" in French or \"Nafarroa Beherea\" in Basque), was retroceded to Henry II by Charles V in 1530. This was the result, not of magnanimity, but of stout resistance. In 1516, John III took the capital, Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port, losing it again after he and Queen Catherine died (1516/1517). Local resistance to the Spanish was fierce; and Henry II retook the city in 1521, losing it again to the Second Duke of Alba (d.1531) in 1522, recovering it again in 1524. Henry began restoring the institutions of the Navarrese Throne in the region. He had a strategic advantage, since the Navarrese possessed Béarn, adjacent to Navarre and conveniently already on the north side of the Pyranees.\n\nIn 1525 the Spanish were back, and then they were thrown out again in 1527. The Emperor Charles got tired of this, so he gave up Lower Navarre in the Treaty of Cambray, which ended the war between the Hapsburgs and France, in 1530. Thus, a landed Monarchy of Navarre continued, with, of course, its growing French holdings.\n\nThis small return of land to the Kings of Navarre was, strictly speaking, pursuant to the Treaty of Noyon in 1516, in which Charles promised the King of France to \"satisfy\" the King of Navarre \"to the extent that he considers just, after studying his claims\" [Emperor, A New Life of Charles V, by Geoffrey Parker, Yale, 2019, p.59]. He was supposed to do that within eight months. It took a lot longer and, of course, didn't really amount to much. The table also shows an interesting alliance of the d'Albret family. John's sister Charlotte married Cesare Borgia, though he abandoned the marriage after four months.\n\nFerdinand's conquest of Navarre had some interesting consequences. Among Basque nobles who rebelled at Ferdinand's death in 1516 were members of the Xavier family, which was then disposessed, dislocating the young Francis Xavier. When Navarrese exiles, including Francis' brothers, tried retaking Navarre in 1521, another Basque nobleman, Ignatius Loyala, defending Pamplona against them, was wounded and had to give up a military career. Both Francis and Ignatius ended up at the University of Paris together. The latter, of course, founded the Jesuits in 1534; and Francis became one of the first Jesuit Saints, traveling as far as Japan and dying in 1552 in China near where Macao would later (in 1557) be founded -- his body, reportedly incorruptible, was returned as far as Goa in India, where it is still periodically displayed.\n\nWhere the succession of Navarre passes to Henry II, Tompsett had a question, since he gave Henry as the grandson of Catherine but then noted obscurities over Catherine's son, named Henry also. Confined to print sources at the time, I found that the Encyclopaedia Britannica flatly stated that Henry II himself was the son of Catherine and John d'Albret, so I followed that. This construction was confirmed by the Erzählende genealogische Stammtafeln [ibid., p.192].\n\nHenry II married a sister, Margaret, of King Francis I of France. She is somewhat celebrated, as Margaret (or Marquerite) of Navarre (or of Angoulême), patroness of Rabelais and author of a collection of stories, the Heptameron. Henry's daughter, Jeanne (III), then marries the senior heir of the Bourbons, Anthony (Antoine), Duke of Vendôme. Their son, Henry III of Navarre, becomes heir to the French Throne, claiming it, amid civil war, in 1589, as Henry IV. After 261 years, the Thrones of France and Navarre are again joined.\n\nThe map above left shows the lands that Henry brought to the French Monarchy. We have seen how Foix, Albret, and Vendôme accrued to Navarre, and how most of Navarre proper was lost to Spain. It is noteworthy that the blue territories, previously belonging to the Dukes of Bourbon, who were separate from Henry's line, had previously reverted to the French Throne. The outline of France shown is slightly unfamiliar because Savoy, Alsace, Lorraine, and the Free County of Burgundy have not yet been added to France's eastern frontier.\n\nThe Heiresses of Navarre HeiressHusband 1Blancad.1229Theobald of\n\nChampagned.1201 2Jeanne IQueen,\n\n1274-1305Philip IV\n\nof France,\n\nI, of\n\nNavarrejure uxoris\n\nNavarre,\n\n1284-1305 France,\n\n1285-1314 3Jeanne IIQueen,\n\n1328-1349Philip III\n\nof Evreuxjure uxoris\n\nNavarre,\n\n1328-1343 4BlancaQueen,\n\n1425-1441John II\n\nof Aragónjure uxoris\n\nNavarre,\n\n1425-1479 Aragón,\n\n1459-1479 5LeonoraQueen,\n\n1479Gaston IV\n\nof Foixd.1472 6CatherineQueen,\n\n1483-1517John III\n\nd'Albretjure uxoris\n\nNavarre,\n\n1484-1516 7Jeanne IIIQueen,\n\n1555-1572Anthony\n\nof Bourbonjure uxoris\n\nNavarre,\n\n1555-1562\n\nIronically, the rulers who were deprived of their home in Spain by force end up returning to rule all of Spain by invitation. When Philip of Bourbon was named successor to Charles II of Spain in 1700, as shown below, the House of Navarre acquired the Throne of all of Spain. The small pied à terre held of old Navarre (Lower Navarre) after 1530 is now, on the other hand, a permanent part of France.\n\nWith the Monarchy long gone in France, the Bourbon (Borbón) King Juan Carlos, now succeeded by his son, has been one of the principal surviving Monarchs of Europe, ennobled by his establishment of democracy in Spain after the long dictatorship of Francisco Franco.\n\nOn the other hand, the national consciousness of the Basque people continues to trouble the unity of the nation states. Besides Spanish Navarra and French Lower Navarre, two other Basque provinces, Labourd and La Soule, exist in France, and three others, Vizcaya, Guipúzcoa, and Alava, exist in Spain. I have no idea if Basque nationalists recognize that the Kings of Spain now are actually the legitimate heirs of the Basque heartland in Navarre.\n\nThe capital of Spanish Navarra, Pamplona (from Latin Pompeiopolis or Pampaelo), Iruña in Basque, is famous for the annual running of the bulls; but Basque nationalism has a more troubling aspect in Spain, with a long and continuing campaign of terrorist attacks to the credit of the extremists. Thus, Navarre and the Basque country have a significance far beyond their size in both mediaeval and modern history.\n\nPortugalSpain 1621- 1640Philip IV of Spain /\n\nPhilip III of Portugal1621- 1665 Loss of Atocha & other treasure ships, 1622;\n\nSiege of Breda, 1624-1625; Default on Crown Debt, 1627; Loss of Breda, 1637; Naval defeat by the Dutch at Beachy Head & the Downs, 1639; Revolt and Independence of Portugal, 1640; Revolt of Catalonia, 1640-1652 PortugalSpain John/João IV of Braganza/\n\nBragança1640- 1656Spanish army defeated by\n\nFrance at Rocroi, 1643 --\n\nend of Spanish hegemony;\n\nDefault on Crown Debt, 1647; Treaty of the Pyrennes, 1659 Afonso VI\n\nd. 16831656-1667Charles/\n\nCarlos II1665-1700 Peter/\n\nPedro II1667-1706Revolt of Catalonia, 1687-1697 John/\n\nJoão V1706-1750Philip of\n\nAnjou/Felipe V\n\nde Borbón1700-1746 War of the Spanish Succession, 1701-1714; Barcelona captured, Austrians expelled, 1714, end of privileges of Aragón, Catalan language banned Joseph Emanuel/\n\nJosé Manuel1750-1777Ferdinand VI1746-1759 Charles IIIKing of Sicily,\n\n1734-1759 1759-1788 Maria I1777-1816Charles IV1788-1808 Peter/\n\nPedro III1777-1786 John/\n\nJoão VIRegent\n\n1799-1816Ferdinand/\n\nFernando VII1808 French Occupy Portugal & Spain, 1807 in Brazil\n\n1807-1821Joseph\n\nBonaparte1808-1814 1816-1826Ferdinand VIIrestored,\n\n1814-1833 Peter/Pedro IV /\n\nPeter I of Brazil1826 Emperor\n\nof Brazil\n\n1822-1831 Maria II1826-1828\n\n1834-1853 Peter/Pedro II\n\nEmperor of Brazil1831-1889, d.1891Isabella/\n\nIsabel II1833-1868,\n\nd.1904 Slavery Abolished in Brazil, 1888, after 4,000,000+ slaves shipped from Africa Ferdiniand/\n\nFernando II1837-1853 Miguël1828-1834 Peter/\n\nPedro V1853-1861 Louis/Luis1861-1889First Republic, 1868-1871 Amadeo\n\nof Savoy1871-1873 Alfonso XII1874-1885 Emperor of Brazil overthrown, 1889 Charles/\n\nCarlos1889-1908Alfonso XIII1886-1931,\n\nd.1941 Manuel II1908-1910\n\nd. 1932 Republic, 1910-1926 Provisional President Theophilo Braga1910-1911 President Manoel de\n\nArriaga1911-1915 Gen.

How to recover Spanish fortunes was the key question for the next four hundred years. At first, a change of dynasty seemed like a good idea.\n\nHere, in a handsome portrait of 1632 by Diego Velázquez, we see King Philip IV of Hapsburg, who presided over the collapse of Spanish hegemony.\n\nWe now have an engaging series of \"Captain Alatriste\" novels by Arturo Pérez-Reverte on this melancholy era in Spanish history. These include El capitán Alatriste (Captain Alatriste, 1996), Limpieza de sangre (Purity of Blood, 1997), El sol de Breda (The Sun over Breda, 1998), El oro del Rey (The King's Gold, 2000), El caballero del jubón amarillo (The Cavalier in the Yellow Doublet, 2003), and Corsarios de Levante (Pirates of the Levant, 2006), El puente de los asesinos (\"The Bridge of the Assassins,\" 2012). These are now available in English up to Pirates of the Levant (2010). Although available in Spanish since 2012, El puente de los asesinos has not yet been published in English.\n\nFuture books planned in the series are La venganza de Alquézar (\"Alquézar's Vengeance\") and Misión en París (\"Mission in Paris\"). A couple years ago I was getting some vibe that Pérez-Reverte might be losing interest in the project, but now it looks like he is continuing with it -- although at increasing intervals. Indeed, it is getting to be a long wait for the last two books, and even for the English version of El puente. I begin to have my doubts.\n\nThe narrator in all these books, Iñigo Balboa, a youth at the beginning, nevertheless is apparently writing in his old age and tells us even in the first book something of his later experience at the Battle of Rocroi. The whole series thus plays out in the shadow of the ultimate failure and disaster of Spanish fortunes.\n\nA version of the \"Alatriste\" saga all the way to Rocroi was released as a movie in Spain in 2006. The battle is somewhat misrepresented in the movie. Although a decisive Spanish defeat, and often said (even by me) to involve the destruction of the Spanish army, nevertheless, after German, Italian, and Walloon regiments fled the field or surrendered, the two Spanish tercios held their ground and repulsed French attacks. The French commander, the Duc d'Enghien, offered them terms of surrender such as are tendered to a besieged force, i.e. that they would be allowed to leave the field with their flags and weapons. These terms were accepted. In the movie, however, Alatriste's tercio refuses the terms and apparently prepares to die fighting (although Iñigo obviously survived).\n\nEven without this exaggeration, the defeat at Rocroi was bad enough. Spanish losses (dead, wounded, or captured) were 15,000 out of 27,000. French losses were 4000 out of 23,000. Curiously, the Alatriste movie stars Viggo Mortensen, who starred in the Lord of the Rings trilogy [2001, 2002, 2003] and A History of Violence [2005]. As it happens, Mortensen was a child for some time in South America, lived in Spain while traveling Europe as a young man, and so not only speaks Spanish fluently but was already familiar with Castilian. There seems to be a European deal in the works to make the whole \"Alatriste\" story as a mini-series.\n\nThe Surrender of Breda (1625), 1634/1635, Diego Velázquez (15991660), Museo del Prado, Madrid\n\nWe find Captain Alatriste at the epic siege of Breda in The Sun over Breda [1988]. This was a Spanish victory in 1625 that spelled trouble for the Dutch Republic, but the Spanish were unable to follow it up. The Dutch recovered the city in 1637.\n\nThe great painting by Velázquez, who himself figures in the Alatriste books, depicts the moment when Justin of Nassau, a natural son of William the Silent, presents the key of the city to the Spanish commander, Ambrogio Spinola, 1st Marquis of the Balbases. It all looks very civilized.\n\nIf Spain had always behaved like that, the Dutch might never have revolted. But burning Protestants at the stake for heresy did not make many friends. If the Spanish were consistent, Justin would have been executed. Pour encourager les autres. Instead, he was released. The English general, Horace (Horatio) de Vere (1565-1635), at one point led a relief force to try and break the siege. After some initial success, he was repulsed.\n\nPhilip IV's greatest fault may have been that of marrying his own niece. The result was the sickly, deformed, and sterile Charles II, who himself decided that the succession of the French Bourbons would turn the trick for Spanish fortunes. However, all it really did was make Spain the junior partner of France, which, in the epic War of the Spanish Succession (1701-1714), won little for Spain except breathing room -- and the epic loss of Gibraltar. A similar alliance with Napoleon only meant that the Spanish as well as the French fleet was destroyed by Nelson at Trafalgar in 1805, followed by Napoleonic betrayal and a French invasion of Spain. The subsequent Peninsular War against France, with the help of Britain, and especially of the Duke of Wellington, was one of the great moments of Spanish history, memorably illustrated by Goya -- Spain has never been short of great artists. However, this proximity to the English did not spell any substantial adoption of English liberal ideas, which are the only things that could have properly pulled Spain into the 19th century, let alone the 20th.\n\nInfanta Margarita Teresa in a Blue Dress, by Diego Velázquez, 1659\n\nThe great skill of Diego Velázquez was never so obvious as in his several paintings of the elder sister of Charles II, the Infanta Margarita Teresa (1651-1673). When born, she was the Heiress of Spain, and even with the birth and succession of Charles, she remained, thanks to his sterility, the first in line for the Throne. With the nature of Charles not initially obvious as a dead end, however, Margarita was married, at 16, to her uncle(!), the Emperor Leopold I.\n\nMargarita, sadly, died at age 21 after four pregnancies. Only one of the children survived, her daughter, Maria Antonia, who consequently became the Hieress of Spain. Leopold would have male heirs (required for the Austrian Throne) from a subsequent marriage, and Maria Antonia would be married to Maximilian II of Bavaria. To him she bore a son, and then also died young. This son, Joseph Ferdinand, a patrilineal Wittelsbach, was thus the Heir to Spain, and the hopes of Europe actually rested on him to prevent a war after the death of Charles II. That Joseph did not survive childhood, as his mother and grandmother had barely achieved adulthood, may be a manifestation of the genetic weakness whose overt signs were so much greater in Charles II. Charles may have drawn this conclusion himself, in choosing a Bourbon Heir, however much this alarmed Europe.\n\nLas Meninas, by Diego Velázquez, 1656\n\nWidely considered the greatest of the paintings of the Infanta by Velázquez, and one of the greatest paintings ever done by him, or by anyone, is Las Meninas, \"The Ladies in Waiting,\" of 1656, when Margarita would only have been five years old. Several features of the painting have attracted attention. One is that Velázquez himself stands behind the main group apparently painting a picture, perhaps this picture. At the back of the room is a mirror, which reflects the images of the King and Queen, perhaps watching the scene as we are. Such unusual additions to what might otherwise be a simple portrait of the Infanta and her Court attendants have sometimes evoked deep Theoretical responses to this painting. What Velázquez had in mind with the composition is certainly a good question.\n\nSince Margarita Teresa died in Vienna, that is where she is buried, in the crypt of the modest Capuchin Church were most of the Hapsburgs have been buried since 1618. Coming to her lead coffin, I only realized who it was (as many Hapsburgs, women and men, have the same names) when the printed guide to the crypt included her image from a Velázquez painting. I knew that young face. Lest we get too carried away with sympathy for the short life of Margarita, it might be noted that she was shocked, shocked to find that Jews were tolerated in Vienna -- they were certainly long gone from Spain -- and the new Empress got her husband Leopold to demolish their synagogue.\n\nThe subsequent history of Spain and Portugal is all too familiar from later \"underdeveloped\" countries, far too much politics and far too little of the rule of law and basic personal and property rights. This culminated in the fiasco of the Spanish Republic and then the Civil War, when socialist nonsense brought on a devastating conservative reaction. As Fascists battled Socialists, and the Socialists were often murdered by Communists, the leftist Cause Celèbre of the late 1930's represented a battle in which Spain would lose no matter which side won. The suspicion, as it happens, is that Stalin really didn't want the Spanish Left to win, since it would have been outside his control. Better that heretics be killed, even in a losing cause.\n\nFortunately for Spain, after the trauma of Civl War, the victorious Fascist Dictator Franco, although chummy enough with Hitler and Mussolini, was not interested in their War, even when Hilter offered him Gibraltar, free of charge, if he would let Germany attack it by land. This bit of prudent restraint earned Franco a peaceful (if protracted) death in bed in 1975 rather than the more horrible ends of the others in 1945. Now we know that Hitler's own envoy to Franco, Admiral Wilhelm Canaris, whom Hitler later executed, actually advised Franco not to join in Hitler's plans. Thus, Franco, who accepted Canaris' advice, also kept the secret of his betrayal of Hitler.\n\nPortugalSpain Fascist Dictatorship,\n\n1932-1974Second Republic,\n\n1931-1939 PresidentPrime MinisterPresident António Óscar de Fragoso Carmona1926-1951António de Oliveira Salazar1932-1968Alcalá Zamora1931-1936 Manuel Azaña1936-1939 Spanish Civil War,\n\n1936-1939 Fascist Dictatorship, 1936-1975 Francisco Franco1936-1975 Francisco Higino Craveiro Lopes1951-1958 Américo de Deus Rodrigues Tomás1958-1974Marcelo Caetano1968-1974 Republic,\n\n1974-presentPrime Minister António de Spínola1974Adelino da Palma Carlos1974Carlos Arias Navarro1973-1976 Francisco da Costa Gomes1974-1976Vasco dos Santos Gonçalves1974-1975 Monarchy Restored José Batista Pinheiro de Azevedo1975-1976Juan Carlosb.1938,\n\n1975-\n\n2014 António dos Santos Ramalho Eanes1976-1986Mário Soares1976-1978Adolfo Suárez González1976-1981 Alfredo Nobre da Costa1978 Carlos Mota Pinto1978-1979 Maria de Lurdes Pintassilgo1979-1980 Francisco Sá Carneiro1980 Francisco Pinto Balsemão1980-1983Leopoldo Calvo Sotelo y Bustelo1981-1982 Mário Soares1983-1985Felipe González Márquez1982-1996 Mário Soares1986-1996Aníbal Cavaço Silva1985-1995 Jorge Sampaio1996-2006António Guterres1995-2002José María Aznar Lopez1996-2004 Durão Barroso2002-2004 Santana Lopes2004-2005José Luis Rodrigues Zapatero2004-2011 José Sócrates2005-2011 Aníbal Cavaco Silva2006-\n\n2011 Pedro Manuel Mamede Passos Coelho2011-\n\n2015Mariano Rajoy2011-\n\n2018 Filipe, Philip VIb.1968,\n\n2014-\n\npresent Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa2016-\n\npresentAntónio Luís Santos da Costa2015-\n\npresentPedro Sánchez2018-\n\npresent\n\nAt right we see descendants of Pedro II of Brazil, who have curiously merged with the heirs of the Throne of Serbia. His daughter, Isabel, had been Regent for Brazil, 1871-1872, 1876-1877, and 1887-1888. It was Isabel who signed the \"Golden Law\" that abolished slavery in 1888.\n\nThe deaths of both Spanish and Portugese dictators ushered in the first real periods of democracy in the history of Portugal and Spain. The socialist, if not the communist, temptation was still here, but King Juan Carlos held off conservative coups in Spain, and the people of both countries came a bit more to their senses, although still burdened with the false ideals of Euro-socialist regimes like France. With a long history of trying to ignore the government, as in Italy, the Spanish economy may have been healthier, thanks to off-the-books transactions, than other statistics (like official unemployment, 22.5%) might have shown. Nevertheless, this still imposed a cultural as well as a political burden on Spain and Portugal really rising to a competitive level in the world economy. Now, however, Prime Minster Aznar has begun to be spoken of together with Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher. Slashing taxes in 1997, the Spanish economy kicked up quickly. Although the 2001 (official) unemployment rate, at 14%, was still virtually a Depression level, the economy was growing at over 3% a year, almost twice as quickly as France. This may be just what Spain needs to join the ranks of the heathiest economies, as well as healthiest democracies.\n\nThe Economist of July 26th-August 1st 2003 reported Spanish unemployment at 11.3%. This was actually better than Belgium (11.6%), and excellent considering that French and German unemployment had increased over the previous year. Spanish growth had slowed (2.1% over the last year), but the global economy was weak at the time. In 2005, the The Economist of October 8th-14th shows Spanish unemployment down to 9.4%. This is not great compared to the better economies, but it is now better than France (9.9%) and Germany (11.7%) as well as Belgium (13.5%). Meanwhile, Spanish GDP growth was 3.4%. This is better than any of the other 15 developed economies listed by The Economist, excepting only the United States (3.6%). Indeed, Spain and the United States are the only ones with growth greater than 3%. In 2003, The Economist listed both Spain and Portugal with the same Economic Freedom Index, putting them ahead of Italy, Taiwan, and Japan, though behind Sweden, Austria, and Germany. This is, at least, a good competitive position.\n\nSpain took a turn for the worse politically (if not economically) on March 14, 2004, with the election of a Socialist government. This seems to have happened because of a terrorist attack the previous week (3/11), when rush hour trains in Madrid were bombed, killing 200 some Spaniards. The conventional wisdom is that Prime Minister Aznar was blamed for this, because he had sided with the United States in the war on terror and sent Spanish troops to Iraq. In the days before the election, the Socialists accused the government of concealing evidence that al-Qaeda was behind the bombings. The strange meaning of all this appears to be that al-Qaeda, which many on the Left have said had nothing to do with Iraq, has attacked Spain for being in Iraq, so that Spain should get out of Iraq so that al-Qaeda will not target it again. This goes along with the leftist notio"
