        "text": "July 4, 1336 death of Saint Elizabeth of Portugal/Queen Isabel of Portugal.\n\nShe was born January 4 1271 in Aragon. Her father Peter was the eldest son of James I of Aragon. Her father succeeded the throne in 1276 as Peter III. Her mother was Constance of Sicily, daughter of Manfred of Sicily and Beatrice of Savoy. Elizabeth was named for her paternal great aunt, Saint Elizabeth of Hungary. Peter's mother was Violant of Hungary, a daughter of Andrew II, and a half-sister to Elizabeth.\n\nHer parents had six children. Three of her brothers were kings:\n\n-Alfonso: succeeded his father as Alfonso III. Died at 25, 6 years after ascending the throne.\n\n-James: succeeded Alfonso as James II. Was married four times. His only children were from his second wife Blanche of Anjou (first marriage was annulled before consummated). Succeeded by his second son Alfonso IV after his elder son renounced his claim and became a monk.\n\n-Frederick: became Frederick III of Sicily. Their mother Constance was queen of Sicily in her own right, and the throne eventually passed to Frederick. Married Eleanor of Anjou and 9 children. Was succeeded by his eldest son Peter.\n\n-Yolande: Duchess of Calabria. Married Robert of Naples, but was never Queen of Naples as she died before her husband took the throne. Bore him two sons. Her husband was succeeded by their granddaughter Joanna.\n\n-Peter-only brother not to be king. married Guillemette, daughter of Gaston VII, Viscount of Béarn.\n\nWhen she was 10 her marriage to Dennis of Portugal was arranged, in 1281. Dennis had come to the throne in 1279 following the death of his father Alfonso III. Dennis was 20. They were married in 1288 when she was 17 and her husband was 26.\n\nElizabeth showed a deep passion for faith from a young age and this continued during her marriage. She sought to aid the sick and poor of her new country which brought her some ill will at court. But she seemed to have a good affect on her husband.\n\nElizabeth was quite active in politics (as a saint she is known as the peace maker). She was very active in the Treaty of Alcañices, between her husband and Fernando IV of Castile which fixed the borders of the two countries. She and her husband also helped to arbitrate peace between Fernando and her brother James II.\n\nBetween 1322 and 1324 civil war broke out between her husband and their son Alfonso. Alfonso resented his father favored one of his bastards over him. Dennis was prevented from killing his son by his wife. As the story goes Elizabeth road out between the armies on a mule at Alvalade and forced a peace between her husband and son. Peace wasn't truly achieved until the bastard died that same year.\n\nHer husband died in 1325 and she retired to a convent of the Poor Clares Monastery of Santa Clara-a-Velha . She had founded the convent. She continued her devotion to the poor. She fed people from her own cellars during a great famine. She saw to the education of children of poor nobles and even dowries for girls from poorer families. The convent took in pilgrims for shelter. She was also a benefactor to many hospitals.\n\nIn 1336 she was called upon a final time to make peace. Her son Alfonso had marched on the troops of her son in law Alfonso XI of Castile. Her son in law had been abusive of her daughter. Though old and in poor health she headed for Estremoz, and helped to negotiate peace between the two kings. Unfortunately it was too much for her, and it brought on her final illness. She died at Estremoz castle on July 4.\n\nShe was not buried with her husband. She was instead originally buried at the Convent of Santa Clara in Coimbra. After a great deal of flooding, in the 17th century, the Poor Clares had her moved to Monastery of Santa Clara-a-Nova where she was buried in a coffin of silver and crystal in the main chapel.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monastery_of_Santa_Clara-a-Nova\n\nShe was beatified in 1526 and canonized by Urban VIII in 1625. Her feast day was moved to July 8 originally due to the Octave of Saint Peter and Paul but the Octave was discontinued and her feast day was moved back. In the US though it is celebrated July 5 due to the US Independence holiday.\n\nShe was the mother of two children:\n\n-Alfonso- succeeded his father as Alfonso IV. He was married to Beatrice of Castile, a sister of Ferdinand IV. They had seven children. He broke the mold by having no children out of wedlock. Succeeded by his son Peter.\n\n-Constance- was married to Ferdinand IV of Castile. Had two children, a son Alfonso who succeeded his father, and a daughter Eleanor who originally was to marry James, eldest son of James II of Aragon. James refused to consummate the marriage and eventually was allowed to become a monk. Eleanor ended up married to his younger brother the future Alfonso IV for whom she bore 2 children. She was Alfonso's second wife and he was succeeded by a son from his first marriage.\n\nAugust 21, 1643 birth of Alfonso VI of Portugal.\n\nHe was the son of John IV of Portugal and Luisa María Francisca de Guzmán y Sandova. Luise was the daughter of Juan Manuel Pérez de Guzmán, 8th Duke of Medina Sidonia, a Spanish aristocrat. His parents had five children who reached adulthood. He was the second son who reached adulthood, but his brother Teodosio died at 19 unmarried, as did his sister Joanna who was 18. His older sister Catherine married Charles II of England. His only younger sibling was his brother Pedro.\n\nUnlike his older siblings, Alfonso was born an Infante of Portugal, as his father ascended the throne in 1640 (Catherine who was his closest older sibling who made it out of infancy was born in 1638).\n\nAlfonso was not a healthy child or man. He suffered an illness at the age of three which left him paralyzed on one side. And mentally weak. His father made him Duke of Braganza and in 1653 he became heir to the throne when his eldest brother died.\n\nHe succeeded the throne in 1656 at 13 when his father died. His mother Luisa was named regent for her son in her husband's will. Between his physical condition and mental status, as well as lack of any interest in governing, allowed his mother to rule for six years. His reign did see the end to the Restoration war, and Spain's recognition of their throne.\n\nHis mother's power came to an end at the hands of Count of Castelo Melhor. The Count took advantage of the king's state, and becoming his favorite, convinced the king his mother was trying to steal his throne. Alfonso exiled his mother to a convent in 1662.\n\nHe had a short lived marriage to Maria Francisca of Savoy. She was the daughter of Charles Amadeus, Duke of Nemours. Her mother was the granddaughter of Henry IV of France (Maria's paternal grandfather Cesare was a bastard son of Henry). They were married in 1666 but Maria quickly filed for annulment. It was granted on the basis that he was impotent. It was granted in 1667.\n\nThat year his younger brother Pedro rose to power. He forced his brother to relinquish power and he became regent in 1668. He was exiled to Terceira Island for seven years. When his health weakened even more he was permitted to return to the mainland but he was kept prisoner at Sintra National Palace. He died in 1683.\n\nHis cell at Sintra\n\nBedchamber-prison of Afonso VI - Sintra\n\nPedro would rule as Pedro II until 1706. He married his brother's former wife Maria in 1668. Maria died in 1683, the same year as Alfonso, making her second time as queen consort even shorter then the first (her husband officially became king when his brother died September 12, and Maria died in December). Maria bore her second husband only one child.\n\n-Isabel Luisa, Princess of Beira: died in 1690 at the age of 21. She was the heir to the throne until 1689. She died of smallpox having never married, though was proposed marriage a number of times.\n\nPedro would later marry Maria Sophia of Neuburg who bore him seven children including his heir John V.\n\nHis mother died in the convent in 1666.\n\nHe was buried in The Monastery of São Vicente de For a, now in the Royal Pantheon of the House of Braganza.\n\nPortuguese Royal Burial Sites – House of Braganza | Unofficial Royalty"
