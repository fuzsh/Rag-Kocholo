        "text": "Concerns from the papacy and rival claims to Sicily Sicily, an island with a history dating back to the early 12th century, was established as a medieval kingdom by Norman lord Roger II. This Kingdom of Sicily, strategically positioned in the Mediterranean, expanded to encompass much of southern Italy, becoming one of Europe’s wealthiest realms. Its abundant grain sustained northern Italian city-states and supported endeavors in the Holy Land, while also serving as a launching point for various crusades. Given Sicily’s significance in defending Rome and the papal states, the papacy deemed it crucial to have a friendly ruler on its throne. Consequently, diplomatic ties between the papacy and Sicily were deeply interwoven; the papacy had backed the Norman invasion and endorsed the kingdom’s establishment, with the king of Sicily ruling as a vassal under the pope’s authority.\n\nIn the 13th century, Sicily became the epicenter of the Hohenstaufen empire under Frederick II. Frederick’s reign sparked vehement disagreements with the papacy over matters of papal supremacy, reigniting the longstanding conflict between the pro-papal Guelphs and pro-imperial Ghibellines. Following Frederick’s death, his illegitimate son, Manfred I, laid claim to the Sicilian throne, further straining relations with the pope regarding his legitimacy. Seizing upon the turmoil surrounding Manfred’s disputed rule, the papacy in the 1250s began seeking potential contenders to challenge his authority.\n\nThe Conquest of Sicily by Charles of Anjou.\n\nIn the early 1270s, Charles I of Naples, also known as Charles of Anjou, wielded significant power across lands in France, Italy, and the Balkans, earning him the descriptor of an ‘Angevin Empire’ by some historians.\n\nAt the invitation of the papacy in 1265, Charles I of Anjou, a prominent member of the French Capetian dynasty, launched an invasion that led to the conquest of the kingdom of Sicily. This campaign resulted in the death of Manfred of Sicily in battle, paving the way for Charles to establish the Angevin Kingdom of Sicily and Naples. With control over Sicily and much of southern Italy, Charles expanded his influence by leveraging the ongoing conflict between the Guelphs and Ghibellines, thus consolidating a formidable feudal state and imposing treaties on numerous Italian cities. This expansion of power significantly bolstered French influence in the western Mediterranean, with Charles and his brother, King Philip III of France, being key beneficiaries.\n\nThe papacy also benefited greatly from Charles’ conquest, as it ensured a pro-papal ruler on the Sicilian throne, while simultaneously weakening the anti-papal Ghibellines in Italy with Manfred’s demise.\n\nWhile consolidating his rule in southern Italy, Charles faced a challenge from Duke Conradin of Swabia in 1268, who laid claim to the Sicilian crown and launched an invasion with a multinational force. This incursion sparked a revolt in Sicily against Charles, but Conradin was ultimately defeated and captured by the Angevins at the Battle of Tagliacozzo. Despite objections from the pope, Charles had Conradin executed, thereby extinguishing the Hohenstaufen line and drawing widespread condemnation across Western Europe.\n\nFollowing his victory, Charles quelled the rebellion in Sicily through harsh measures, instituting a new administration that favored French interests. This included land confiscations from Sicilian nobles, preferential treatment for Frenchmen in government roles, establishment of Angevin garrisons, and relocating the capital from Palermo to Naples.\n\nOver the ensuing decade, Charles’ rule in Sicily grew increasingly oppressive, marked by heavy taxation and displacement of the Sicilian noble class. Many exiles sought refuge in the Kingdom of Aragon.\n\nExploiting Sicily’s wealth and strategic importance, Charles used the island as a base to assert Angevin power, engaging in conflicts with the Republic of Genoa and undertaking campaigns to suppress pro-Ghibelline forces in various Italian cities. Additionally, he pursued his ambition to expand into the Byzantine Empire, seizing control of Corfu and Albania.\n\nCharles’ ambitions and stringent rule drew criticism from the papacy, although it initially supported his military endeavors as a means to counter Byzantine influence and defend the Holy Land. However, tensions rose due to Charles’ increasing power in Italy and his heavy-handed governance in Sicily, leading to financial support from successive popes but also underlying disapproval.\n\nAragonese Interest in Sicily.\n\nDuring the reign of James I of Aragon from 1213 to 1276, the Iberian Crown of Aragon embarked on a sustained period of military and commercial expansion. Aragon’s acquisition of the Balearic Islands in 1232 and the conquest of Valencia in 1238 facilitated the extension of Aragonese influence across the western Mediterranean. Recognizing Sicily as a pivotal gateway for advancing Aragonese interests to the east, James forged an alliance with King Manfred of Sicily in 1262. This alliance was solidified by the marriage of James’ son and successor, Peter, to Manfred’s daughter, Constance of Sicily.\n\nJames vehemently opposed Charles of Anjou’s invasion of Sicily in 1268 and the subsequent deaths of Manfred and Conradin. His concerns heightened when France and the Angevins launched a crusade against Tunis in 1270, a move perceived as an attempt to diminish Aragonese influence. Upon James’ death in 1276, Peter III ascended to the throne of Aragon. Firm in his belief that his wife Constance was the rightful queen of Sicily, Peter sought assistance from Philip III of France to compel his uncle Charles to relinquish Sicily to Constance, albeit without success. Faced with formidable adversaries to the north and east, Peter dedicated the 1270s and 1280s to strengthening his kingdom. He bolstered the Aragonese navy, reformed the army, and pursued diplomatic initiatives to isolate the Angevins from potential allies.\n\nA significant influx of political exiles, expelled from Sicily, Tunis, and the Ghibelline cities of Northern Italy, joined forces with the Aragonese. Many of these exiles harbored grievances against the Angevins and aspired to reclaim their lost territories. Notable among these Sicilian refugees was diplomat and physician John of Procida. A staunch supporter of both Manfred and Conradin, John sought sanctuary in Aragon following Charles’ conquest of Sicily. By 1279, he had earned Peter’s trust and was granted lands in Aragon, subsequently playing a crucial role in Aragonese foreign affairs.\n\nThe Sicilian Vespers.\n\nBy early 1282, tensions had reached a boiling point in Sicily. Muslim victories against Christian territories in the Levant had destabilized the Holy Land, fueling speculation that Charles and the Angevins might soon launch an invasion of Byzantium. These developments stirred fears among Sicilians of renewed conscription and taxation under Angevin rule.\n\nOn Easter Monday, just before Vespers at the Church of the Holy Spirit in Palermo, a violent clash erupted between Angevin soldiers and the Sicilian populace. Accounts differ on the catalyst; some cite the harassment of a Sicilian woman by an Angevin soldier, while others mention an attack by a Frenchman on a burgher or priest. The riot quickly spread throughout Palermo, leading to a revolt against the French. The uprising spread across the island, resulting in the killing of four thousand Frenchmen over the next six weeks.\n\nThe rebels seized control of most of Sicily, with only Messina remaining under Angevin authority. As the home port of the Angevin crusader fleet, Messina was heavily fortified and strategically important. However, Angevin vicar Herbert of Orléans’s attempts to reinforce the city’s defenses backfired, and on April 28, he and the Angevin garrison retreated to the castle of Mategriffon, leaving Messina to the rebels. Alaimo da Lentini took charge on behalf of the Sicilian rebels, and the burning of the Angevin fleet in the harbor dealt a significant blow to Charles’ Mediterranean ambitions.\n\nThe rebellion in Sicily destabilized Angevin Naples, prompting Charles’ adversaries to exploit the situation. John of Procida worked to garner support for the rebels, while Byzantine Emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos saw the revolt as an opportunity to thwart Charles’ plans to invade Byzantium. In Rome, the papacy’s response was divided; while some church members favored peace with the rebels due to concerns over Angevin power, Pope Martin IV, a staunch ally of Charles, rallied papal resources against the Sicilian insurgents.\n\nIn retaliation, Charles raised an army and besieged Messina. The Sicilian rebels, initially divided over their political allegiances, coalesced around various factions, including those supporting independence, Peter of Aragon, or seeking papal protection. However, the papacy’s rejection of diplomatic overtures and threats of excommunication inadvertently bolstered support for the pro-Aragonese factions. The leading cities of Sicily formed a parliament, effectively establishing a governing body for the island.\n\nAragonese Intervention in Sicily.\n\nFollowing the Sicilian Vespers revolt, the rebel-aligned Sicilians sought support from Peter of Aragon to counter the Angevins and the French. Peter’s claim to the Sicilian throne through his wife Constance, coupled with pressure from wealthy Aragonese merchant communities, presented an opportunity for a profitable Aragonese invasion of Sicily. Additionally, weakening the Capetian dynasty and France, which posed challenges to Aragon in northern Iberia, was a strategic aim.\n\nIt’s suggested that Peter planned to invade Sicily regardless of the revolt, especially once Charles set sail to invade Byzantium. After ten weeks of preparation, under the guise of a crusade, Peter’s fleet of 140 ships set sail for Collo in North Africa.\n\nUpon landing in Collo, the Aragonese fleet received envoys from the Sicilian rebels, accepting their offer of the Sicilian throne. They then sailed for Trapani, landing unopposed before advancing to Palermo for Peter’s coronation. In early October, Aragonese troops compelled Charles to lift his siege of Messina, leading to the withdrawal of remaining Angevin forces from the island.\n\nWhile Sicily was lost to Charles, his forces still held significant territories on mainland Italy. Pope Martin IV, staunchly pro-French, responded by excommunicating the Sicilian rebels, the Byzantine emperor, and the Ghibellines of northern Italy in November. Most significantly, he excommunicated Peter of Aragon and his House of Barcelona, stripping them of the Aragonese crown and transferring it to Charles of Valois, son of King Philip III of France and grandnephew of Charles of Anjou.\n\nAragonese Successes & Angevin Counterattack.\n\nFollowing the expulsion of Angevin forces from Sicily, the focus shifted to mainland Italy, particularly Calabria in Southern Italy. Uncertain of the loyalty of his southern Italian subjects, Charles of Anjou retreated to Naples to regroup, while the Aragonese-Sicilian army gathered in Eastern Sicily. Aragonese troops, led by Prince James of Aragon, landed on the Italian mainland and advanced towards Reggio without encountering resistance. However, there was no significant uprising against Charles in wider Calabria. The Aragonese continued to press their advantage, seizing most of the Calabrian coastline by February 1283.\n\nOn the defensive, Charles proposed resolving the conflict through personal combat with Peter, which was accepted. However, the duel never took place as King Edward I of England, following a papal order, refused to adjudicate. Peter returned to Bordeaux in disguise to avoid a suspected French ambush, and the conflict persisted between their respective kingdoms.\n\nAs the land war reached a stalemate, naval warfare intensified. Sicilian-Aragonese admiral Roger of Lauria emerged as a prominent figure, leading successful raids along the Calabrian coast and defeating the Angevin fleet at the Battle of Malta in the summer of 1283. This secured Aragonese control of the seas around Sicily.\n\nDespite setbacks, Charles prepared for a major counteroffensive in 1284, gathering resources from his feudal holdings and financing a massive naval buildup. He aimed to launch an invasion of Sicily, bolstered by a fleet of 200 ships. Charles also secured ecclesiastical tithes from the papacy and influenced France to prepare for war against Aragon, diverting Aragonese resources away from Sicily.\n\nTo counter the impending Angevin invasion, Lauria conducted raids in southern Italy, prompting Prince Charles of Salerno to confront him. In the ensuing Battle of the Gulf of Naples, Lauria decisively defeated Charles’ fleet, capturing the prince and several ships. Despite this setback, Charles continued his campaign, besieging Reggio and attempting to blockade Messina. However, Lauria’s strikes on Angevin supply lines forced them into retreat.\n\nThe costly naval buildup and failed land campaign depleted the Angevin treasury, forcing Charles to halt his counterattack until 1285. His death in early 1285, coupled with Aragonese attention shifting towards a conflict with France in Iberia, led to Sicily becoming a secondary theater in the conflict until the 1290s.\n\nFrench Intervention and Aragonese Crusade.\n\nIn response to Aragonese victories against the Angevins in Sicily, France sought to support its ally and capitalize on the conflict. Although there was division within the court of Philip III regarding a war with Aragon due to its potential costs, Philip vowed to treat an attack on Charles’ Angevin kingdom in Sicily as an assault on France. However, the French nobility showed reluctance to get involved initially, and Philip was unable to respond to the Aragonese landing on Sicily in 1282. By early 1284, Philip had garnered enough political backing to declare war. While he had little interest in Sicily itself, he saw strategic value in seizing Roussillon and Montpellier and aiding his uncle Charles.\n\nPhilip also aimed to extend his influence in northern Spain by securing the Val d’Aran and the Kingdom of Navarre, nominally ruled by his son Philip the Fair. To prompt an invasion, Pope Martin IV declared a crusade against Aragon, citing King Peter’s excommunication and offering indulgences to those who fought against him. Both France and Aragon began preparations for war.\n\nThroughout the winter of 1283–1284, both sides intensified their war efforts. Despite his success in Sicily, Peter of Aragon faced challenges as his kingdom’s resources were stretched thin by conflicts in the east. Moreover, internal opposition arose as many nobles objected to his expansionist policies. Negotiations with a noble faction led Peter to relinquish some of his rights as king and release noble prisoners in exchange for the manpower needed to defend Barcelona.\n\nIn France, Philip deployed the royal army to Toulouse and Navarre while raising substantial funds from French merchants to finance the war. In late 1283, King James II of Majorca, Peter’s younger brother, declared his support for the French crusade and recognized their authority over Montpellier. He also granted the French army passage through the Balearic Islands and Roussillon. However, James’ actions inadvertently thwarted Philip’s plans to annex Roussillon from Majorca, as the French king found himself allied with James, making it politically challenging to seize the territory.\n\nDespite Majorcan intervention, Philip was determined to proceed with his invasion. On February 22, 1284, Philip’s son Charles of Valois was crowned King of Aragon, directly challenging Peter’s rule.\n\nFrench Invasion.\n\nThe summer of 1285 saw the French crusader army, led by Philip and Charles of Valois, enter Roussillon. While contemporary accounts exaggerated its size, it was still one of the largest French expeditions into Iberia. Despite having support from James of Majorca, the local population resisted, delaying the French advance. When they reached Elne, the city resisted fiercely, led by the illegitimate son of the late count of Roussillon. Despite overcoming Elne and continuing south, the French faced opposition from local nobles conducting a scorched earth campaign.\n\nPhilip’s army progressed slowly but steadily, reaching Girona by late June 1284, where they laid siege. Constant resupply was necessary, leading to challenges in transporting supplies through contested territory or by sea to Roses. Meanwhile, the Aragonese, led by Peter, avoided open battle, instead harassing French supply lines. Catalan pirates further disrupted French shipping.\n\nIn early September, Roger of Lauria’s Aragonese fleet arrived, decisively defeating the French at the Battle of Les Formigues, seizing control of the Catalan coast and cutting off French resupply by sea. Girona fell to the French, but their supplies dwindled, and dysentery plagued the army. By mid-September, Philip decided to withdraw.\n\nRetreating, the French suffered attrition and guerilla attacks. Negotiations for safe passage through the Pyrenees failed, leading to the Battle of the Col de Panissars, where the French were routed. Philip succumbed to dysentery, and James of Majorca fled his lands, which were subsequently occupied by the Aragonese.\n\nThe failure of Philip’s invasion led to the collapse of the French war against Aragon. With France weakened militarily and the newly crowned Philip IV choosing not to pursue further conflict, the focus shifted away from Iberia.\n\nLeadership Changes.\n\nThe end of 1285 marked significant shifts in leadership across the involved parties. Peter of Aragon, Philip III of France, and Charles of Anjou had all passed away. Additionally, Pope Martin IV had died, leaving behind a changed landscape for their successors to navigate.\n\nPhilip IV of France, formerly Prince Philip the Fair of Navarre, inherited the throne but was more focused on domestic issues than continuing the war with Aragon. Charles of Naples, the heir to Charles of Anjou, remained a prisoner of the Aragonese, with his government managed by Charles’ councilors, notably Robert II of Artois. Robert proved adept at rebuilding the Angevin armies and fleets, capitalizing on Aragon’s engagement in the war with France.\n\nFollowing Peter’s death, the crowns of Aragon and Sicily were split between his successors. Alfonso III of Aragon and James II of Sicily aimed to consolidate their gains, including annexing their uncle James’ lands in Mallorca. However, Alfonso also faced challenges from a border war with Castile.\n\nThe Angevin kingdom, despite possessing a strong army, sought diplomatic solutions due to intermittent warfare and the fear of intervention from other powers. Attempts at peace were hindered by diplomatic complexities and conflicting interests, such as the papal obligation to invade Sicily and internal strife within Aragon. Negotiations led to agreements like the Treaty of Tarascon in 1291, but Alfonso’s death soon after rendered it void.\n\nJames, now ruling both Aragon and Sicily, sought a lasting peace with the papacy and France. However, the Catalan merchant class and Aragonese noble families had vested interests in Sicily, complicating matters. Despite efforts to reach agreements with Naples, official peace treaties were stalled due to papal approval issues.\n\nThe death of Pope Nicholas IV led to election disputes, further delaying the resolution of conflicts and formal peace treaties. Amidst these challenges, James continued diplomatic efforts, aiming to secure stability in his realms while navigating the complex web of alliances and interests.\n\nAragon Changes Sides, Sicilian Resistance.\n\nThe election of Pope Boniface VIII in 1295 marked a turning point in efforts to end the conflict between Aragon and Angevin Naples. Boniface, determined to strengthen the political authority of the church, focused on returning Sicily to Angevin control and asserting papal suzerainty over the island.\n\nUpon his election, Boniface initiated diplomatic overtures to Aragon, aiming to sway their support towards restoring Angevin rule in Sicily and severing their ties with their Sicilian allies. In a meeting in Velletri, Boniface presented terms for Aragonese withdrawal from Sicily to key figures such as John of Procida, Infante Frederick of Barcelona, and Roger of Lauria. Personal concessions were also offered, including granting Roger of Lauria a papal fiefdom over Djerba and proposing a marriage alliance between Frederick and Catherine de Courtenay, who held claims to territories in the Greek islands and the Latin Empire.\n\nFollowing further negotiations, James of Aragon agreed to the Treaty of Anagni in 1295. Under this treaty, Aragon relinquished its claim to Sicily to the papacy and consented to a marriage alliance between James and Blanche of Anjou, a member of Charles II’s family. Additionally, Aragon gained control of Mallorca as a vassal, received significant monetary compensation, and saw Charles of Valois renounce his claim to the Aragonese throne. With the treaty in place, Boniface perceived the Sicilian rebellion as quelled and reaffirmed Charles II’s right to rule Sicily, paving the way for a new Angevin invasion to reinstate Angevin authority on the island.\n\nCrowning of Frederick III.\n\nDespite the shifting diplomatic landscape, the Sicilian populace vehemently opposed any reinstatement of Angevin rule over Sicily, considering the Treaty of Anagni to be null and void. Led by Queen Constance of Sicily and the Sicilian parliament, preparations were made to continue the fight for independence. The proposed lucrative marriage alliance for Frederick fell through, leading him to reaffirm his commitment to ruling Sicily.\n\nIn late 1285, Frederick declared that Aragon had abandoned Sicily, and in December of that year, he was proclaimed “Lord of the Island,” pending a plebiscite to formally install him as king. After a gathering of delegates in Palermo, Frederick was crowned as Frederick III, King of Sicily, in March 1296. Despite retaining his status as a prince of Aragon, Frederick resolved to defend Sicily against external threats.\n\nFrederick’s coronation strained relations between Aragon and Sicily. While Aragon was obligated by treaty to support Angevin Naples and the papacy in retaking Sicily, James opted not to invade immediately, recalling all Aragonese and Catalans from the island. This decision divided the loyalties of many nobles, as years of shared history and joint military service had forged strong ties between Aragon and Sicily. Despite pressure from Pope Boniface, James hesitated to support the Angevin cause, focusing instead on peace negotiations with Frederick.\n\nHowever, Frederick rejected his brother’s attempts at reconciliation, consulting with the Sicilian parliament to determine the island’s course of action. As it became evident that submission to Aragon, Angevin, Naples, and the papacy was not an option, Frederick and the Sicilians intensified their military preparations to safeguard Sicilian independence.\n\nAragonese–Angevin−Papal coalition against Sicily.\n\nIn the summer of 1296, Frederick intensified his offensive against the Angevin forces in Calabria, seizing control of Catanzaro and Squillace. Additionally, Crotone rebelled against the Angevin garrison and pledged allegiance to the Sicilians. However, tensions between Frederick and Roger of Lauria emerged during the campaign as they clashed over Sicilian strategy. Despite their differences, the Sicilians intercepted and defeated a small Angevin fleet attempting to raid Ischia in October, provoking Charles II and Pope Boniface to increase pressure on James and Aragon to join their side in the conflict.\n\nAfter failed attempts at reconciliation with his brother in February 1297, James traveled to Rome to negotiate with Pope Boniface. There, a new treaty was drafted, in which James agreed to wage war against Frederick and Sicily in exchange for monetary compensation and papal approval to annex Sardinia and Corsica. Meanwhile, Roger of Lauria, having fallen out of favor with Frederick, left Sicily to attend the political marriage of Yolande of Aragon to Robert of Naples, signaling a shift in allegiance. Subsequently, Roger rejoined James’ service, with the king appointing him as the ‘High Admiral for Life’ of the Aragonese fleet.\n\nWith their alliances solidified, Aragon and Angevin Naples prepared to launch a joint offensive against Sicily in 1297. While Aragon repositioned its navy from Iberia, Angevin Naples initiated the attack by besieging Catanzaro, which had been captured by the Sicilians the previous year. Frederick dispatched a Sicilian army to lift the siege, resulting in a decisive victory that forced the Angevin forces to retreat. With their foothold secured in Calabria, Frederick encouraged rebellion in Naples, negotiated with anti-papist factions in Tuscany, Lombardy, and Genoa, and supported the House of Colonna against the papacy. Despite the absence of Aragonese assistance, the Sicilian army remained formidable, while both sides focused on strengthening their naval capabilities.\n\n1298–1301 invasion of Sicily.\n\nBy 1298, James had reorganized the Aragonese navy and was ready to rejoin the war in force. A combined fleet of 50 Aragonese and 30 Angevin galleys assembled in Naples, while the Sicilians raised 64 galleys led by Corrado Doria, a former Genoese admiral. In an attempt to establish a secure port for the allied fleet during the winter months, James led the allied fleet to capture Patti in northern Sicily in the summer of 1298. However, facing strong local resistance, they abandoned their push inland. Subsequently, the allies embarked on a campaign to capture Syracuse, managing to take several nearby towns and lay siege to the city. Despite their efforts, Frederick and his commanders conducted successful guerrilla warfare, harassing isolated allied garrisons and supply lines. Winter conditions exacerbated the situation, leading to attrition on both sides, and Patti revolted against the allied garrison. Roger of Lauria led a ground force to retake Patti, but a surprise attack by a Sicilian squadron cost the allies ships and reduced their naval advantage.\n\nIn March 1299, James lifted the siege of Syracuse due to dwindling resources. Despite retaining control of some coastal towns, the siege had depleted Aragonese–Angevin manpower and supplies. James sought peace with Frederick, but his overtures were rejected, leading to further hostilities. After returning with fresh troops in May, a second invasion fleet departed Naples in July. Landing in northern Sicily, the fleet encountered Sicilian resistance led by Frederick’s forces. In the Battle of Cape Orlando on July 4, the Sicilian fleet suffered a defeat, granting the allies naval supremacy. James departed for Aragon after the victory, leaving Roger of Lauria and the Angevins to continue the war in Sicily.\n\nWith a beachhead established, the Angevins began landing troops on Sicily, led by Charles’ son Robert and Roger of Lauria. They seized control of towns and fortresses, advancing towards Catania after besieging Randazzo. Facing stiff resistance, the Angevins proceeded south along Mount Etna’s western edge, capturing several towns and besieging Catania. A coup in the city allowed its occupation by the Angevin army, forcing Frederick to retreat to Enna. The Angevins then advanced westward to Trapani, where Philip of Taranto’s army was defeated at the Battle of Falconaria in 1299. Following this victory, the Sicilians launched counterattacks, inflicting further losses on the Angevins.\n\nIn early 1301, Robert and Roger led a fleet north towards Messina but were hampered by a storm that destroyed nearly 30 galleys. They then besieged Messina, blockading the city and burning the surrounding countryside. The Sicilians, led by Frederick, conducted resupply missions, keeping the city’s morale high despite famine and attacks. Unable to subdue Messina, the Angevins withdrew to Catania, where a peace agreement was eventually brokered between Frederick and Yolanda, bringing an end to the invasion.\n\nIn 1302, Prince Charles of Valois entered Italy under the direction of Pope Boniface. Backed by significant financial support from the papacy and the French court, he led an army into Tuscany and Florence to suppress supporters of the anti-papal Ghibellines. Upon reaching Naples, Valois reached an agreement with the pope and the Angevins, who promised him support for a potential future campaign to restore the Latin Empire if he succeeded in conquering Sicily. When the peace treaty between Sicily and Angevin Naples expired in the summer of 1302, the Angevins began providing troops and ships to support Valois’ invasion.\n\nFacing the formidable French army led by Charles of Valois, Frederick opted to fortify coastal towns and disrupt the invaders’ supply lines, intending to exhaust them through attrition. The allied fleet, carrying Valois’ army, landed at Termini on the northern coast without encountering resistance. Meanwhile, Roger of Lauria raided the coastline near Palermo. Valois’ army marched inland, attempting to seize control of the Sicilian heartland. They besieged Caccamo but were unable to capture it due to its strong defenses. Moving on to Corleone, they faced similar resistance. Seeking to resupply by sea, Valois marched to Sciacca on the southwest coast of Sicily.\n\nAs the allied army advanced, Frederick and the Sicilians shadowed them through the countryside, opting not to engage directly. Disease, starvation, and the harsh Sicilian summer took a toll on Valois’ army, which struggled to break through the defenses at Sciacca. By August 1302, faced with the deteriorating conditions, Valois sent envoys to Frederick to negotiate peace. In mid-August, an agreement was reached for Valois to withdraw from the island, with the Angevins agreeing to evacuate their remaining garrisons in eastern Sicily in exchange for Frederick withdrawing his forces from the Italian mainland. With the defeat of Charles of Valois and the inability of Charles II to launch a successful invasion, and with James showing no interest in invading, all parties began seeking peace.\n\nThe conclusion of the War of the Sicilian Vespers came with the signing of the Peace of Caltabellotta on August 19. This treaty affirmed Frederick as the King of Sicily, while Charles became the King of the Mezzogiorno, which later became known as the Kingdom of Naples. The pope ratified the treaty in May 1303, and Frederick paid tribute to facilitate the peace process. Additionally, a marriage was arranged between Frederick and Charles’ daughter, Eleanor. A stipulation in the treaty stated that upon Frederick’s death, his throne would pass to the House of Anjou, and Frederick agreed to provide military support to Charles of Valois if he attempted to invade Byzantium.\n\nWith his recognition as king of Sicily, Frederick adopted the title of King of Trinacria. However, to maintain the Ghibelline legacy of the Staufer, he chose to refer to himself simply as “King” without any territorial designation in his official acts from 1304 to 1311. Subsequently, he used the title “King of Sicily” from 1315 to 1318 and struck coins throughout his reign as “rex Sicilie.”\n\nThe repercussions of the war and the subsequent treaties continued to impact regional politics for decades. Aragon emerged as a major power in the Mediterranean, gaining mercantile interests in Sicily and asserting control over Mallorca and Sardinia. Sicily and Naples were divided into separate kingdoms, with different ruling dynasties governing each half. Despite the clause in the treaty, Frederick III’s crown was not returned to the House of Anjou upon his death, and the House of Barcelona maintained control of the island until the 15th century. The kingdoms of Sicily and Naples remained politically separate until the formation of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies in 1815.\n\nThe War of the Sicilian Vespers also had far-reaching consequences beyond Italy. The Catalan Company, a mercenary group formed by veterans of the conflict, played a significant role in the history of the Eastern Mediterranean.\n\nFurthermore, the war provided an opportunity for the Republic of Genoa to declare war on its rival, Pisa. The decisive victory at the Battle of Meloria in 1284 established Genoa as the dominant naval power in the Western Mediterranean, leading to the decline of Pisa."
