        "text": "Spanish History:\n\nPeter IV of Aragon (1319 – 1387)\n\nPeter IV, known as “The Ceremonious”, was the King of Aragon, King of Sardinia and Corsica, King of Valencia, and Count of Barcelona from 1336 until his death. He was the eldest son and heir of Alfons IV, then Count of Urgell, and his first wife, Teresa d'Entença. Peter IV was the most cultivated of Spanish 14th-century kings but was also an inveterate political intriguer whose ability to dissemble was notorious. Through his voluminous correspondence, the workings of his mind are far better known than those of any contemporary Spanish ruler. He was a strong and hard monarch who reorganized the court, the administration and the army, directing his activities to increase the real power inside his kingdom and to increase his domains in the Mediterranean Sea.\n\nPeter IV deposed his brother-in-law James III of Majorca and made himself King of Majorca in 1344. His reign was occupied with attempts to strengthen the crown against the Union of Aragon and other such devices of the nobility, with their near constant revolts, and with foreign wars, in Sardinia, Sicily, the Mezzogiorno, Greece, and the Balearics. His wars in Greece made him Duke of Athens and Neopatria in 1381. He conquered the trans-Pyrrenean provinces of Roussillon and Cerdagne from France. Peter IV defeated to the union of the noblemen in Épila; supported Henry of Trastámara against Peter I of Castile. In 1356, he engaged with Peter I of Castile in what was called the \"War of the Two Peters\". It ended in 1375 with the Treaty of Almazan, without a winner due to the Black Death and several natural disasters.\n\nThroughout his reign, Peter IV had frequent conflicts with the inquisitor general of Aragon, Nicolas Eymerich. Toward the end of his reign, Peter IV ordered the compilation of the Chronicle of Sant Joan de la Penya to record the historical basis for the authority of the crown. Peter IV died in Barcelona January 5 1387, being 67 years old. His funeral was carried out in Royal Sepulchers of the monastery of Poblet. His successor will be John I.\n\nMarriage and children\n\nHis first marriage, on 23 July 1338 in Alagón, was to Maria of Navarre, daughter of Queen Joan II. Maria died the day after giving birth to her youngest child, Peter (who also died). Peter IV and his first wife had four children:\n\nConstance (1343 – 1363), who married King Frederick III of Sicily.\n\nJoanna (1344 – 1385), who married Count John of Ampurias.\n\nMaria (1345/6 – 1348).\n\nPeter (born and died 28 April 1347)\n\nHis second marriage, on 15 November 1347 in Barcelona, was to Eleanor of Portugal, daughter of Afonso IV. She died one year later of the Black Death.\n\nHis third marriage, on 27 August 1349 in Valencia, was to Eleanor of Sicily, daughter of Peter II of Sicily. Queen Eleanor became a powerful influence at the Aragonese court, replacing Bernardo de Cabrera as Peter's chief adviser. Upon a royal stay at her home in Empordà, Eleanor made Sibila of Fortia her lady-in-waiting. This led to an eventful future for the girl. In Lérida on 20 April 1375, Queen Eleanor died leaving her husband a widower and her three surviving children.The Royal couple had four children:\n\nJohn I (1350 – 1396).\n\nMartin I (1356 – 1410).\n\nEleanor (1358 – 1382), who married John I of Castile and was the mother of Ferdinand I of Aragon.\n\nAlfonso (1362 – 1364).\n\nPeter IV remarried to Sibila of Fortia, a girl that was over thirty years his junior. Most of the family, including Eleanor's children, came into conflict with Sibila. This fourth marriage gave the king three children:\n\nAlfonso (1376 – 1377), Count of Morella.\n\nPeter (born and died April 1379).\n\nIsabella (1380–1424), married James II of Urgell and was mother of Isabella of Aragon, Countess of Urgell. Through Isabella, Peter and Sibila are ancestors to Joana, Princess of Portugal and John II of Portugal."
