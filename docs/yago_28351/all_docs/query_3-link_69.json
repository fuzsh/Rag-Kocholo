        "text": "In 1414, the Roman Emperor, Manuel II Palaiologos (1391-1425), sent a letter in Latin from Thessaloniki to the new King of Aragon, Ferran I of Antequera (1412-1416), in which he evoked “the maximum affection and fervent love that have existed between us, our predecessors and all the Kings of Aragon, a more fervent love than with the others Western princes”, so as to express his gratitude to the Trastámara monarch for the promised support against the Ottomans.\n\nAlthough these words were fairly ornated with the aim of getting the military help the Empire needed desperately, the fact that the basileus himself reclaimed pleasingly the diplomatic ties with the Crown of Aragon means that the political contacts between the East Roman Empire and the Iberian reign were much more intensive and profitable than it has been thought.\n\nTaking into consideration diplomatic contacts between both political entities will allow us to understand why Andronikos II Palaiologos hired Catalan mercenaries to use them against the Turks. So, in this article we are going to examine the complicated geopolitical situation of the Mediterranean during the thirteen century, which led the interests of both states to one direction: Sicily.\n\nFAR, FAR AWAY FROM THE OIKOUMENE…\n\nAs it is known, the east Romans structured the universe according to a hierarchical model: the emperor was the center of the oikoumene and his empire the guardian of the Antiquity. In this spirit, the De Administrando Imperio of Konstantinos VII Porfirogenetos (950), a precious manual that contains a vast geographical description of the nations that lived around the Roman-land, offers some pages to describe the Iberian peninsula. Based on classical Greek sources and ancient legends, the basileus mentions the Iberian people who lived there:\n\n“In this country are said to be many distinct nations, as Herodutus has written […]: “This Iberian race, which, I say, lives on the shores of the strait, though one race, is distinguished by names according its tribes: first, those who inhabit the western parts at the farthest verge are called Kynetes […]; then, Tartessians; then, Elbusinians; then, Mastienoi; then, Kelkianoi.””\n\nIn another paragraph, the erudite emperor explains briefly that:\n\n“In the same year Justinian [II] returned once more to his throne [705?], […] the Agarenes [Muslims] obtained complete control of Africa. Then, the grandson of Mauias with a very few men crossed over into Spain [711] and, having collected together all of his tribe, gained control of Spain even to this day.”\n\nAs we can deduce from these passages, it seems that from the Boukouleon Palace there was a lack of information -and may be interest- regarding the political context of the north-west territory of the Iberian Peninsula. If we compare it with the number of chapters dedicated to the others Byzantine’s neighbors in the north (Pechenegs, Bulgars, Russians, Serbs, etc) and in the east (Turks, Arabs), the information given is minimum\n\nand, overall, decontextualized and anachronical.\n\nIt must be said that, at this time, the main geopolitical goal of Byzantium was to search alliances among the European tribes in order to re-establish east Roman rule in the Balkans. After the disappearance of the panmediterranen empire since the Arab conquests of the Levant and Africa during the seventh century, Byzantium put his eye on the Balkans as the Bulgars penetrated further in Moesia, Thrace, and Thessaly. Therefore, it is not rare that Roman’s affairs in the West were reduced only to the Italian peninsula, as Spain was, obviously, far from the Imperial political agenda.\n\nFIRST STEPS\n\nTwo important events for the future occurred almost at the same time in the Mediterranean: in 1078, the daughter of Robert Giscard, Matilda, married Ramon Berenguer II of Barcelona. This gesture, seemingly unimportant, announced the beginning of a new era for the County of Barcelona because this marriage implied the birth of a new foreign policy, orientated to the Mediterranean.\n\nOtherwise, only three years after, in 1081 Robert Giscard, moved by his great ambition and barbaric impulses, set sail from Apulia to conquer totally the Empire’s itself. It is at this context when Byzantine diplomacy noticed the existence of the House of Barcelona, according to what Anna Komnene says about in the Alexiad: “Of the others two daughters, one of them got engaged to Raimon, son of the count of Barcelona”.\n\nFor Byzantium, the County of Barcelona was seen as an ally of the Normands, as it could be a possible enemy of the integrity of the injured Roman corpus. Nevertheless, the death of Ramon Berenger II in 1082 prevented any possible danger coming from Catalan territories and Barcelona has moved away from the preoccupations of the Empire.\n\nBut, globally, we can take out of context something extremely important for the future of east Roman’s strategy, since the arrival of the Crusaders in the outskirts of Constantinople: that is, the fear of an entire coalition led by the King of Sicily against the Empire. Aware of this, Alexios I Komnenos would be the first of a long list of emperors to change Byzantine foreign policy westwards; essentially, in order to divide any power able to siege the Empire. That is the key factor that puts the necessary conditions to establish future contacts with the House of Barcelona.\n\nTHE MEDITERRANEAN IN THE 13th CENTURY\n\nIn the thirteen century, the Mediterranean world had changed a lot. On the one hand, after the horrific plundering of Constantinople in 1204, Byzantium -firstly Nicaea, before the Palaiologan Restoration in 1261- became a secondary power, and it never recovered his ancient political status.\n\nOn the other hand, in the Western Mediterranean, the situation was quite different. The small County of Barcelona, thanks to the dynastic union with the Kingdom of Aragon in 1134, formed up an emergent new state: the Crown of Aragon, which not only inherited the maritime and commercial role of the mentioned county but reinforced it even more by projecting a new trade policy, above all after the Treaty of Corbeil (1258), which asserted the political position of Louis IX of France in the southern Gallic lands and give him access to the sea. Between 1229-1238, the crusader king James I of Aragon (1227-1276), conquered the Balearic Islands and the taifa of València, and with it sealed the material conditions for the Catalan maritime expansion.\n\nAfter the extinction of the Normand dynasty in 1191, the Sicilian throne was occupied by Henry VI Staufen of the Holy Roman Empire, son of Fredrich Barbarossa. The new ruler, following the political desires of his father, wanted to reimpose the ancient Carolingian idea of the Dominium Mundi by subduing the European emergent kingdoms and by conquering all the Italian peninsula. This was rejected by the Pope, who claimed to be the unique temporal lord in the world.\n\nIn this sense, Italy was divided politically in two: the Guelphs, favourable to the Pope, and the Ghibellines, more leaned towards the Hohenstaufen. The kingdom of Sicily occupied a strategic position for the dominion of the Italian peninsula, so its control was very important.\n\nCHARLES OF ANJOU, THE “NEW” ROBERT GUISCARD\n\nIn 1258, Manfred of Hohenstaufen, an illegitimate son of the “Antichrist” Fredrich II (1220-1250), took the throne of Sicily. As a response, the Papacy looked for its own candidate: the ambitious prince Charles of Anjou, brother of Louis IX of France. Charles was Duke of Anjou, Maine, Count of Provence, as well as King of Naples, Albania, Cyprus and Jerusalem. In that time, he was said to be the “most powerful prince of all Europe”. In effect, in 1266, he defeated Manfred’s troops in the Battle of Beneventum, and he was proclaimed King of Sicily by the Pope’s grace.\n\nAfter executing the last Hohenstaufen’s pretender, Charles of Anjou prepared a huge military expedition so as to conquer the weakened -but still firm- Roman corpus -again! To that effect, in 1281 the French prince signed the Treaty of Orvieto, by which he established an alliance with the Republic of Venice, the Principality of Morea and with the exiled Latin emperor, Baldwin II of Constantinople. The east Roman emperor, Michael VIII Palaiologos, came up with a solution: he decided to ally not only with the Ghibellines, but also with the Crown of Aragon.\n\nPETER “THE GREAT” OF ARAGON\n\nPeter III of Aragon (also known as “The Great”, by the Catalan historiography), was the son of James I, King of Aragon and Count of Barcelona between 1227 and 1276. Born in València in 1240, he was appointed by his father “Procurador General”, or governor of Catalonia, in order to control any nobility uprising against the royal power. In 1260, he was married to Constance of Sicily and, for that reason, he became gradually the “natural heir” of the Sicilian throne thanks to the fact that his wife had been deprived of this title.\n\nIn 1276, he was crowned as a new ruler of the Crown of Aragon. Unlike his father, the “Crusader-King”, the Catalan king projected a “national” policy towards the Mediterranean by making alliances with the Ghibellines and the east Roman Empire, as we are going to see. In this direction, Peter III of Aragon boosted the economic interests of the Catalan merchants, who wanted to continue trading with Sicily and open new commercial posts -the “Consolats de Mar”- to the eastern Mediterranean ports.\n\nAs such, it was unavoidable the Mediterranean expansion of the Crown of Aragon: the king only needed the opportunity, and this one came when -after Charles’ occupation of Sicily- arrived at the Aragonese court not only exiled Ghibellines, but also two illustrious Roman princesses: Constance of Hohenstaufen, widow of Ioannis III Vatatzes, and Eudoxia Laskaris, sister of the unfortunate emperor Ioannis IV. According to the medieval Catalan sources, these princesses were known by the name “Infantes de Grècia”, of whom the House of Barcelona will feel proud.\n\nA ROMAN-CATALAN CONSPIRACY IN SICILY?\n\nThe “existence” of a complot organized by Peter III of Aragon and Michael VIII Palaiologos is still debated, even nowadays. Steven Runciman claimed that the Sicilian rebellion against Angevin’s rule and Peter’s invasion of the island were materialized due to the summum of efforts by both the Catalan king and the east Roman emperor. Although Catalan chronicles say nothing about that, some Italians authors offer us many information about the embassy’s exchanges between Byzantium and the Crown of Aragon.\n\nFor example, in the Lu Rabellamentu de Sichilia, -an important Sicilian chronicle- explains us with many details -often, these are fantastic- that Giovanni da Procida, chancellor of Aragon, served as a messenger between Constantinople and Barcelona: in 1280, he traveled to Constantinople to meet with the Roman emperor, who took him in, and then he gave him 30.000 gold currencies before leaving the capital, accompanied with Latino Allardi, an imperial ambassador.\n\nAfterward, he came across a Pisan galley, which told to him that Pope Nicolas III had died. Knowing this, Procida met with his Sicilian friends in Malta, where they finally came to an agreement to continue with the conspiracy. Thenceforth, Procida followed his voyage and arrived in Barcelona, where Peter the Great took him in with all the honors and accepted the Byzantine’s gold. Then, he ordered to prepare the expedition.\n\nWhatever the veracity of this story, the case is that, in February 1282, the French Simon de Brie was elected as Pope Martin IV. Immediately, the new Pope excommunicated the Roman emperor and published a document in which the Bishop of Rome announced a crusade “contra inimicos fidei Christiane”, that is, against Byzantium. This solemn declaration was addressed indirectly to Peter the Great, who was warned not to intervene.\n\nFrom my point of view, this fact could explain why the royal court III kept in secret the conspiracy. In that direction, if we have in mind a letter sent by the Catalan king to the Pisan commune on February 1282 -in which the king announces his intention to invade Sicily and confirms his excellent relationship with the “Imperator Constantinopolitanus”, it is highly probable that it really existed a Catalan-Roman conspiracy.\n\nFor that reason, both the historians Ernest Marcos and Deno Geanakoplos consider that the negotiations between the House of Barcelona and the court of Constantinople had culminated in a secret written treaty in the last months of 1281.\n\nSICILIAN VESPERS\n\nOn 30th of March 1282, an incident between a French soldier and a Sicilian civilian in a church provoked a rebellion in Palermo, at the same time that the uprising spread to the island. Therefore, Charles’s expedition against Byzantium was stopped, as we know from the Chronicle of Bernat Desclot, in order to defend themselves against the attack of Charles of Anjou, the inhabitants of Messina “had prepared the city, and had built a wall around it with the wood of the ships of Messina that Charles had it made for going to Romanía”.\n\nThe east Roman emperor had accomplished his purpose. On 3rd June 1282, Peter and his 15.000 men’s army set sail from Portfangós and they arrived in Tunisia. There, the Catalan king accepted the Sicilian rebel’s offer to be invested as a new Sicilian king. On 30th August 1282, the king disembarked in Trapani, and with this act the Vespers Wars began.\n\nTo that effect, on September 1282 Peter of Aragon received a Byzantine embassy -composed by the Archbishop of Sardes- which proposed marriage of one of Peter’s daughters with the future Andronikos II Palaiologos in order to confirm publicly the alliance, but the Catalan king refused because he didn’t want to provoke more the anger of the Papacy -Peter had been excommunicated-, in order to reach a diplomatic agreement.\n\nIn spite of this, the king of Aragon didn’t avoid what the east Roman emperor had managed to evade: a Crusade against his realm. So, momentously, the Catalano-Roman relations chilled.\n\nEPILOGUE\n\nThe last question is, how this war ended?\n\nIn 1302, a peace treaty was signed between the Kingdom of France, Naples and the Crown of Aragon: Sicily was annexed to the House of Aragon and Naples continued to be under the Anjou.\n\nTo sum up, Michael VIII got to release of what it could be a destructive military campaign, whereas the Byzantine financial support to Peter III of Aragon helped him to organize the military campaign to conquer Sicily. Certainly, the Catalano-Roman alliance was possible thanks to geopolitical interests.\n\nBut I want to finish this essay by stressing something even more important according to the purpose of this work: deducing from the reading of the Chronicle of Bernat Desclot, it seems that the Crown of Aragon was the unique state of Western Europe that recognized the Byzantine Empire as a “legitim victim” of the evil instincts of Charles of Anjou:\n\n“And around that land of Morea the king Charles tried to gain all Romanía and destroy the Greek Christians, but God, whom don’t get pleasure from pride and malice, give advice so as to his thought [of Charles] was not accomplished.”\n\n✍️ Author: Pere González Alerm"
