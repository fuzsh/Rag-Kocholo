There’ll be trouble.\n\nPlace Names – a Shedcast\n\nEnglish place names are a direct window in into the lives of our ancestors – an insight into the origins or remarkable features of ancient settlements. Here’s a brief survey of how to decode some of them.\n\nAt A Gallop 1629-1638 The Personal Rule\n\n11 years of peace, prosperity – and tyranny?\n\n368 A Prince’s Punishments\n\nIn 1633 Thomas Wentworth arrived in Ireland – and despite great administrative efficiency, managed to separately outrage each of the components of Irish Society Meanwhile in London, William Prynne and John Lillburne stood form against tyranny.\n\n367 New England\n\nThe colonists that traveled to New England were very different to the Chesapeake, and the society they established also very different. For the indigenous peoples, the shock would be every bit as severe.\n\n366 The Chesapeake\n\nColonisation of the Chesapeake would be driven by its climate and its most successful crop – tobacco, defining the social structure of the colonists and the society they would form, and the impact they would have on the indigenous peoples.\n\n365 The Hub of Empire\n\n‘By what right?’ In this episode we think about how the early English colonisers viewed their Westward Enterprise, and legitimised their activities.

But, how was he to raise money to clear that £2m debt? Well, two words came in to play – many, and various.\n\n360 Charles Abroad\n\nRelationships with the other kingdoms was definitely the royal preserve. But policy options might vary, from favouring the desires of his protestant subjects, to the Spanish faction on the privy Council. But his clout was always hampered by the poor state of the Royal Navy\n\n359 Charles is At Home\n\nCharles was determined to run his court completely differently to his father.

Murder!\n\n356 Petition of Right\n\nAs so often, war demands money, and in England, money meant parliament. So the outcome of ‘The Favourites’ War’, Buckingham’s attempt to relieve La Rochelle in 1627, would be critical.\n\n355 The Hearts of our People\n\nThe battle of Lutter in 1626 convinced Charles of the tearing need to intervene in the Thirty Years War in defence of hos sister Elizabeth’s rights and in the cause of Protestantism. But the cupboard was bare – how to raise money? Without calling that pesky parliament!\n\n354 Parlement a sa Mode\n\nThe 1626 parliament was opened by William Laud – not a good sign for the resolutely Calvinist parliament. Despite a remarkably positive response to the call for subsidies – their linkage to resolutions of grievances did not go down well with Charles\n\n353 Lawyers Vs Clerics\n\nAs the 1626 parliament opens, full of hope once more, we take a while to introduce William Laud, and discuss the idea that a theme of the English civil wars is an ideological struggle between lawyers and Arminian clerics\n\n352 A Beard UnSinged\n\nThe reconvened parliament in Oxford went poor, and after a month Charles closed it down, and concentrated instead on the Spanish war.

The historian W G Hoskins gave it a name – the Great Rebuilding\n\n347 The English Revolution\n\nWell this is exciting! The English Revolution.
