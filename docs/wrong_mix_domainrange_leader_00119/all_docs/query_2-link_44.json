These chapters� Country Profile, The Society, Government and Politics, The Eccnomy, Military Geog- raphy, Transportation and Telecommunications, Armed Forces, Science, and Intelligence and Security, provide the primary NIS coverage. Some chapters, particularly Science and Intelligence and Security, that are not pertinent to all countries, ore produced selectively. For small countries requiring only minimal NIS treatment, the General Survey coverage may be bound into one volume. Supplementing the General Survey is the NIS Basic Intelligence Fact book, a ready reference publication that semiannually updates key sta- tistical data found in the Survey. An unclassified edition of the factbook omits some details on the economy, the defense forces, and the intelligence and security organizations. Although detailed sections on many topics were part of the NIS Program, production of these sections has been phased out. Those pre- viously produced will continue to be available as long as the major portion of the study is considered valid. A quarterly listing of all active NIS units is published in the Inventory of Available NIS Publications, which is also bound into the concurrent classified Factbook. The I iventory lists all NIS units by area name and number and includes classification and date of issue; it thus facilitates the ordering of NIS units as well as their filing, cataloging, and utilization. Initial dissemination, additional copies of NIS units, or separate chapters of the General Surveys can be obtained directly or through liaison channels from the Central Intelligence Agency. The General Survey is prepared for the NIS by the Central intelligence Agency and the Defense Intelligence Agency under the general direction of the NIS Committee. It is coordinated, edited, published, and dissemi- nated by the Central Intelligence Agency.

Introduction (C) Yugoslavia's political life is in the midst of preparations for the evertttutl proble of succession. Throughout the country's postwar history the personality of President Josip Broz Tito has acted as a guiding force and moderating influence on Yugoslavia's diverse rationalities and theircentrifugal tendencies. The time left for Tito, who was 80 in May 1972, to insure the survival of what he has wrought is at hest limited. With this in mind, the nation, under Tito's guidance, is mid -way through a sweeping constitutional reform program and the Communist party is seeking new ways to strrngthen its influence and control. This dual process is designed further to decentralize governmental authority, while insuring that the park- remains the cementing force of the Yugoslav federation. Yugoslavia, in its slightly more than :50 years of existence, has grown from a backward Balkan state into it nation which exercises influence throughout the world far out of proportion to its size and power. Credit for this feat rests with one ratan, President Tito. Tito, it corky, crafty, curious, restless, and gregarious self -made man, possesses rare political skills. He knows how best to use those around hire to achieve his ends. But he also has an almost animal -like instinct for sensing d anger; he knows how to exercise self control, knows how to neutralize competing pressures, and is a master at blurring issues. Largely as a result of Tito's political prowess, postwar Yugoslavia has a record of impressive political accomplishments Historians ma differ on 'Tito, but all will continue to give him credit for defying Stalin, and for parlaying ambiguous political terms such as \"self management\" and \"nonalignment\" into meaningful political concepts that often capture world headlines. Because of its success in combining Communist rule with independence, Yugoslavia is the secret envy of other Eastern European nations and it curiosity to the West. In the less developed countries of Africa and Asia, where 'socialism\" is art attractive political term, Yugoslavia's unique form of worker managed economy liberally sprinkled wid small private businesses is a powerful force. Despite Yugoslavia's one -party political system, its political life has a dynamic quality thanks to the regime's efforts to induce democrati: procedures, including open debate and the substitution of persuasion for coercion. As a result, there is a great deal of personal, physical, and intcCectual freedom compared with most other East European Communist states. The Communist regime, however, has set limits to the growth of an open political order. No challenge to the one -party system or to Tito's leadership is permitted, and the Communist part (the League of Communists of Yugoslavia �LCY) avowedly remains the sole political authority in the country. In foreign affairs Belgrade has tried to maintain a highly flexible policy, which has permitted it to remain politically and iavologically independent of both the Communist and non- Communist power bloc:. Since the occupation of Czechoslovakia in 1968 the balance of Yugoslav nonalignment has shifted in favor of the West. In addition to Tito's charismatic personality and political skill, the secret to Yugoslavia's independence also rests with the fact that C ommunist rule was established %with relatively little help from Moscow. Tito's regime came to power at the close of World War II with only minor assistance from the Soviet army. The part' had been locally recruited and trained, and although respectful of the Soviet leadership, a successful guerrilla war made its leaders both popular and confident in their ability to rule. As a result, Yugoslavia showed none of the slavish fealty paid to the Soviets by other Eastern European Communist regimes. Although Yugoslav communism in the immediate postwar years was built on the Soviet model and followed Stalin's leadership, Tito's independent attitude and political ambitions in the Balkans quickly raised Stalin's ire. Tito's own dreams and goals clashed with the Soviet dictator's intention to dominate Yugoslavia's leaders and exploit the country's economy. The clash led to the expulsion of Yugoslavia from the Communist Information Bureau (Corninform) in 1943. APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2009/06/16: CIA- RDP01- 00707R000200100033 -9 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2009/06/16: CIA- RDP01- 00707R000200100033 -9 Following its expulsion, Yugoslavia began mod f%ing its domestic and foreign policies. The need for popular support at limne in the face of Soviet economic� and political efforts to thrpple the Tito regime, its well as for policies which world encourage economic growth, resulted in a search for nc�w socialist forms. Marxism- Leninism was subjected to intense philosophical scrutiny. Claiming that their interpreta- tion rested on the real meaning of `lar:c and that Stalin was the \"revisionist,\" the Yugoslays seized upon the Marxist theory that the state should \"wither away' as the basic doctrinal justification for their new independent road to socialism. Regime leaders argued that their new approach, consisting primarily of decentralization of economic and political decision making, accorded with the withering -away principle. Conversely, Yugoslav theoreticians accused Stalin of ignoring this principle in creating a repressive, btireauc�ratic state which relied upon police intervention and terror to make it work. This ideological breach between Belgrade and Moscow has never healed instead, further Yugoslav efforts at decentralization launched in the mid- 1960's have aroused deep misgivings in the U.S.S.R. The regime has attempted to win support and overcome popular apathy toward communism at home through policies of moderation and persuasion. Police controls are relaxed, greater emphasis is placed on the government's adherence to its own lega guarantees, and greater freedom is allowed in religious, educational, and cultural affairs. The leadership has encouraged increased popular participation in political life through voluntary Lictivity in mass organizations. As a result, the attitudes of the Yugoslav people have gradually changed from hostility to acceptance of the regime and pride in its economic and political accomplish- ments, particularly its independence from foreign control. Above all, the policies of the \"Tito regime have produced it rising standard of living, although at the cost of heavy foreign debt and considerable economic inefficiency. \"Tito and company, however, have failed to win the majority of Yugoslays to communism as a doctrine. The regime's own efforts to spur economic advancement through greater foreign investments and permissiveness in the realm of private business have dissaffected many you.:g idealists. For others, material adcancernent is too slow. They want all the luxuries of the West. and they want them now. The slowness of communism �in their eves �to meet these demands has disenchanted than with the system. If the nation's leadership gets credit for improv. merits in national life, it also gets `lie blame for the high level of economic corruption, widespread social and economic ine(pialiiy, aril the social ills typical of a rapidly urbanizing and modernizing society. While mane Yugoslays approve of such achievements us an extensive social security system, low -cost socialized medical care, and an improved educational system, the regime's continuing control of all organized political life is widely resented. Although the regime has remained relatively stable under Tito's leadership, factions have developed with the federal party structure. The divisions are mostly Tong nationality and republic lines, but conflicting views also exist on centralization or decentralization as the appropriate structure for the Yugoslav party and state system. One of the most serious challenges to federal party authority occurred in 1971 when Croatian nationalism pervaded that republic's party leadership. The Croats argued that the principle of decentralization, already being implemented in the government structure, should be extended to the party apparatus. Such a move, which would have resulted in splintering the party into six and possibly even nine Communist parties, was unacceptable even in Tito's pluralistic Yugoslavia. The result was a widespread purge of nationalists firm the Croatian party leadership, exceeding in scope and thoroughness even 'he purge that followed the ouster of former Vice President Aleksandar Rankovic in July 1966. A party reorganization, begun in October 1966 following Rankovic's ouster, culminated at the Ninth Party Congress in March 1969, when new, liberal, and federalized statutes were promulgated. It was under these lenient statutes that the Croats began to challenge federal party authority arid, as such, Tito's own influence and power. The result of this challenge appears to be at least a partial reversal of the liberal trend in the LCY and a strengthening of internal discipline and of the party's control apparatus. In late October 1972, Tito again showed himself to be the ultimate arbiter of the liberal- conservative tug -of -war in the party. At that time, dissatisfied with the slow implementation of his orders that the Serbian hierarchy be shaken up, 'Tito moved against the Serbian party leadership. Under fire, a number of leading figures, including republic party boss Marko Nikezic, resigned. As of December 1972, the purge in Serbia (Serbija) had stopped far short of reaching the magnitude of the events in Croatia (Hrvatska) in December 1971. The basic question about Yugo- slavia's future, however, still remains unanswered: I -low will this system, which is obviously tailored to APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2009/06/16: CIA- RDP01- 00707R000200100033 -9 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2009/06/16: CIA- RDP01- 00707R000200100033 -9 Tito*s own personality and methods, work in the hands of those who follow the 80 -year -old President\" Ethnic, cultural, and national differences, coupled with wide differences in economic development among the country's nationalities, make the achievement of unit difficult. Separatist sentiments have not disappeared from Croatia and Macedonia (Makedonija), and fear of domination by the Serbs remains among the country's other ethnic groups. \"These longstanding ethnic and regional antagonisms have been rekindled by economic rivalries and exacerbated by the regime's policy of building up the economically underdeveloped republics at the expense of the more developed ones. An economic reform program launched in Jule 1963 modified but did not entirely abandon this policy. Under a program of 23 constitutional amendments eulopted in mid -197 1, a great deal of federal authority has already been passed to the nation's constituent republics and provinces. A second set of amendments is scheduled to be introduced in late 1973. When these are passed, many of the republics' responsibilities and prerogatives will, in turn, be passed onto the shoulders of the local communes, the lowest level of local government. Plans also call for it complete revamping of the nation's legislative system and redefinition of its powers and rights. Completion of these reforms will in effect mean it whole new constitution for Yugoslavia. The� party is in the throes of redefining its own position within the political system. Until the Croatian political upheavals in late 1971 the LCY had sought to divest itself of the daily running of the country in favor of a policy- oriented role of providing ideological leadership and \"guidance.\" Former Vice President Rankovic's opposition to this trend, as well as to the economic reforms, was a key element in his downfall. Widcr popular participation in the process of govemrneiO and less direct party rule, however, led to the nationalist crises in both Croatia and Serbia. As a result, the problem facing the party is how to insure the continued decentralization of governmental authority, while simultaneously strengthening party control over the implementation of that program. Yugoslavia's international policies are designed to keep the country independent and socialist. 'Tito has attempted a balance of relations between the United States and the Soviet Union, striving to extract nmxinncrn economic c�oncess'ans from each. Ideo- logically, Yugoslavia's communism provides a built -in bias in favor of the U.S.S.R. This bias is counteracted, however, by Yugoslavia's wariness of coming under Soviet domination and Moscow's distaste for Belgrade's ideological innovations. A key clement in Tito*s international balancing act is his doctrine of nonalignment. By assiduously cultivating the underdeveloped countries of Asia and Africa, Tito garners diplomatic maneuvering room and moral support for Yugoslavia. This police has not paid off in greatly increased foreign trade, however, and the conflicting national interests of the nonaligned countries have resulted in a lack of cohesion among thern. Although Yugoslavia's ideological bias has led to periods of intense criticism of the West and of the United States in particular, Tito has continued to exhibit a desire for good relations. Yugoslavia still looks to the United States and Western Europe for considerable economic assistance, and about two thirds of its foreign trade is with non- Comn...nist countries. Yugoslavia maintains full diplomatic ties at the ambassadorial level with the European Communities (Common Market �EC). Belgrade also has been successful in negotiating preferential trade agreements wit.., the EC. In an effort to preserve and expand its traditional markets, Yugoslavia has associated itself �as an \"observer,\" not as a member with the Communist economic organization, the Council for Economic Mutual Assistance (CEMA). Yugoslavia's East -West balancing act is also evident in its military policies. Tito has consistently refused to associate with either the Warsaw Pa:�t of the Communist nations or with the West's North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Yugoslavia has sono!lt, with limited success, to diversify its sources of arms. Nevertheless, it has come to depend on the Soviet Union for most modern equipment. There are large quantities of obsolete U.S. equipment in the Yugoslav arsenal as a result of a large assistance program which terminated in December 1937. B. Structure and functioning of the government (C) 1. Constitution Yugoslavia is in the midst of a major constitutional reform. A first set of 23 amendments was adopted in the summer of 1971 and it second set should be ready for passage by the end of 1973. With the promulgation of the second anrc�ndments, the nation will in effect have a new constitution. The purpose of the reforms is to prepare Yugoslavia for the succession period after Tito. The first set of amendments took major steps toward creating a union of nearly autonomous socialist republics, with the federal government's authority 3 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2009/06/16: CIA- RDP01- 00707R000200100033 -9 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2009/06/16: CIA- RDP01- 00707R000200100033 -9 restricted mainly to conducting foreign policy, providing for national defense, achieving a unified economic system, and channeling funds from more dv% eloped republics to backward regions Bosnia and Ilercegoyina lBosna i Ilercegmina), Macedonia, Montenegro (Crna Cora), and hosoyo. All other functions, duties, and responsibilities, as well as considerable financial resources, are to be passed to the republics. The second group of amendments focus ou restructuring and redefining the role of the Yugoslav parliamentary system. In addition, the process of decentral :nation is to take another step forward, and sonic towers now held in the hand% of the republic governments will be passed down to tit(- kcal commune level. The newly evolving Yugoslav Constitution takes into account the wide variety of different elements which make up the state and tries to give each nationality not only a voice in running its own affairs but in that of the country as a whole. The frank, open discussion of ideas and interests beyond those of the Communist party already taking place under the evolving system is far more akin to that occurring in Western political life 'ban to anything known in Eastern Europe or the Soviet Union. The old Constitution dates back to 1963 (with major amendments in April 1967 and December 194111). Combining elements from socialist, syndicalist, French, and U.S. political thought, the 1963 Constitution attempts to create it socialist democracy, but by no means a political democracy in the Western mold. Federalism, deeviitrnlization of political administration, and workers' self management are the central themes of the systern. Under Yugoslav socialist theory these elements provide the mechanism for the eventual \"withering away of the state\" and are essential to any society. The 1971 -72 constitutional reforms are designed specifically to apply these theories to the practical realities of the Yugoslav federation. When completed, the new amendments will represent the fourth constitution formulated by the Yugoslav Communists since they carne to power in 1945. The first, in 19-16, closely resembled the Soviet Constitution of 1936. The major innovation of the 19.16 document was the creation of a federal system of six constituent republics and tvo autonomous provinces in order to deal with the country's divisive nationality question. Despite its federal structure, however, power within the Yugoslav systern remained highly centralized. Provisions to protect civil rights (fr,�edorn of speech, the press, religion, and assembly) \\sere included, but with the limitation that it was \"illegai and punishable to make use of civil rights to change or undermine the constitutional order for antidemocratic purposes.\" In practice, the \\\\ord \"antidemocratic was interpreted to include any opposition to tit regime. The 19.53 (:onstit tit ion� kno \\y officiall\\ as the Fundamental Lass radically modified the 1946 document to reflect the decentralization of authority which had begun in late 1949. 'I'll(- federal structure was retained, and the six constituent republics gained greater administrative power. For the first time the Constitution provided for a government of enumer- ated and delegated powers. Both federal and republic governments had only those rights arid powers specifically delegated to them. All other power was to he vested in \"the working people\" as a whole arid expressed through local people's committees and workers councils. The 1963 (:euvstitution was promulgated in order to realign the federal governmental system with the development of self- management which Yugoslav ideologists deemed to have taken place since 1953. The federal system remained, but a complicated five chamber legislature, which included four \"occupa- tional\" chambers, replaced the old bicameral body. The Constitution accentuated the socialist rather than the multinational nature of the state by changing the state's name from the \"Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia\" to the \"Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.\" The change also reflected the regime's cairn to the achievement of the \"socialist\" stage of communism. Of the other socialist countries, only the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, arid Romania claim to have reached that level. The 1963 Constitution formally introduced the policy of limited terms arid rotation in office, mainly in the elective posts, to foster the infusi.nr of new blood into the political system and to counter \"bureaucrat ism\" and \"routinism.\" A complicated noinhation and electoral procedure, heavily weighted in favor of indirect election of most ass,mhly deputies, was established at all but the lowest level of government. The Constitution also heavily emphasized it new leading role for the Federal Assembly, describing it as \"the supreme organ of power in(] organ of self- government.\" The assembly's role in the Yugoslav system is, however, undergoing basic change. A better reacting on what duties, rights, and responsibilities it will have, should emerge with the second set of reforms. One major change under the 1971 am: ndments is the creation of it 23- member state presidency, made up of three members from each of the nation's six APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2009/06/16: CIA- RDP01- 00707R000200100033 -9 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2009/06/16: CIA- RDP01- 00707R000200100033 -9 republics and hvo each from the autonomous provinces of Kosovo and Vojvodina. 'Tito remains the titular head of state, boa much of the dav -to -dav business falls to the Vice President and others in the presidency. The positions of head of state and head of the government (President of the Federal Executive Council� Premier) were separated in 1963. Until then, the former autornatically assurned the latter office. Under the new collective presidency, the president of each republic or provincial assembly is, by virtue of his office, it member of the presidency. The others are elected for nonsuccessive, 5 -year terms by majority vote in the assemblies. The Constitution gives the President certain decree rights; he may declare war if the Federal Assembly is unable to meet. The Communist party (officially named the League of Communists of Yugoslavia �LCY) was mentioned in tl:e iext of the 1963 Yugoslav Constitution for the first time, and called the \"leading force,\" \"the ideological and political guide,\" and the \"initiator of political activity.\" The party's status, heretofore extraconstitutional, thus was cloaked with legality and its monopolistic position trade evident. Mention was also made of the important role of the Socialist Alliance of Working People of Yugoslavia (SAWPY), the party's mass political front organization, and of the Confederation of 'Trade Unions of Yugoslavia (CITY). Indeed, both organizations have stirred to new life in recent years: SAWPY as a genuine forum for discussion and debate, and the CTUY as a defender of worker interests. In the Marxist tradition, there was, in the 1963 Constitution, continued emphasis on the withering away of the state, although the concept was not expressed explicitly in the text. Also for the first time, a section on foreign policy was included, enunciating President 'Tito's foreign policy objectives. In it particularly important innovation, the Constitution created it Constitutional Court. The court replaced the old Constitutional Commission of the Federal Assembly and has the authority to pass on the constitutionality of both federal and republic laws. Personal freedoms �of speech, thought, abode, religious conviction, press, association, Inovernent, and assembly �first guaranteed by the 1946 Constitution, have only been allowed in practice since the ouster of authoritarian Vice President Alcksandar Rankovic in 1966. \"These freedoms remain qualified to the extent that they cannot he used \"to overthrow the foundations of socialist and democratic order\" or to openly appose the basic policies of the leadership. The Constitution expressly guarantees that religions confession shall be the \"free and private\" affair of the citizen, and that religious communities shall be separated from the state, free to perform religious rites, and permitted to found religious schools. A checkrein on church activities was provided, however, by making unconstitutional any abuse of religious rights for political purposes. Increasing pressure from the republics particularly Slovenia (Slovenija), Croatia, and Macedonia �for greater authority, the decentralization of economic decisionmaking under the economic reforms inaugurated in 1965, and the fall from power in July 1966 of the centralist conservative leader, former Vice President Alcksandar Rankovic, precipitated the adoption of a series of constitutional amendments in April 1967 which further diffused authority throughout the system. The 1971 -72 constitutional amendments are intended to adjust once and for all the working relationship between the federal and republic governments. The decentralization taking place has satisfied the vast majority of demands by the constituent republics and provinces for greater autonomy. The two exceptions are the republic of Croatia and the province of Kosovo. In both instances the greater freedoms allowed under the reforms have led to increased demands. In the case of Croatia, resurgent republic nationalism posed a major threat to the Yugoslav system resulting in Tito's direct intervention in December '971 and the purge of nationalists from the Croat --v party. 2. Structure of the government Yugoslavia's first post -World War II federal government was patterned after the Soviet system. Following Yugoslavia's expulsion from the Cominform in 1948, and rapidly after 1950, Soviet forms were abandoned and replaced by limited liberalization in the governmental stnnctu �e. Partly as a reaction against the Soviet mode' -and partly because of concern over governmental inefficiency, the Yugoslays abolished sonic ministries after 1948 and relinquished many federal governmental functions to the constituent republics. In 1950 the regime introduced workers councils, which theoretically were to cooperate in making policy for their constituent economic enterprises, formerly operated by government agencies. At the same time \"social management,\" or \"self- manage- ment\" as it is noNv known, was introduced as the \"right of the working people to manage organizations and institutions in all fields of social life through self governing bodies.\" 5 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2009/06/16: CIA- RDP01- 00707R000200100033 -9 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2009/06/16: CIA -RDP01 -00707 R000200100033 -9 Despite various other changes designed to create at least the .lopearance of greater democracy, the basic political process in Yugoslavia was initially totalitarian. The party controlled all government activity, since members of its Central Committee filled most of the key posts in the federal and republic governments. Lesser party members exercised similar control at the lower levels. Moreover, President \"Tito was the final arbiter in all matters. lie was simultaneously Secretary General of the party, President of the Socialist Alliance, President of the Republic, President of the Federal Executive Council (FEC), and Supreme Commander of the Yugoslav People's Arrny. In 1063, however, it new Constitution was promulgated which sought to separate more clearly the executive, legislative, and judicial functions of government and to establish the Federal Assembly as the supreme legislative and political body in the federal government (Figures I and 2). Since late 1970, the trend toward greater republic and provincial autonomy, as well as toward greater personal freedoms, has dramatically accelerated. The catalyst for this movement was President Tito himself. Cognizant of the problems which must accompany the transition after his death or retirement, Tito in September 1970 proposed the creation of it collective presidency and a series of constitutional reforms designed to create the machinery for the succession period. The result has been the development of it political system which includes frank, open discussion of ideas and interests beyond those of the Commttaist party, it political life far more akin to that of Western parliamentary systems than to other one -party Communist states. The major constitutional reform of 1971 carried this separation even further. Federal authority is now I;mited to conducting foreign affairs, maintaining national defense, and insuring a unified economic system throughout the country. The role and makeup of the Federal Assembly will not become clear until it second set of constitutional reforms is adapted in lute 1973. It is likely that the new parliament will have no inure than two chambers and that its authority will be pared clown and tailored to reflect the reduced authority and powers of federal organs. The assembly, which has in the past been described as \"the supreme body of self managing enterprises,' may also now include representatives of large self managing enterprises. Expanding the consultative process in the assembly also provides it formal framework for the resolution of competing group interests. 6 'I'll( party is intent on retaining its controlling role. The part\\ already exercises its influence on the legislature by using party members who sit in the assembly� particularly in its key offices �and by monitoring the national electoral process. The party leadership, after considering the advice of its staff, formulates the broad policy to be enacted into the law by the Federal Assembly and to he carried out by the executive and administrative bodies. The system serve the regime's major airn of creating the image of public participation in the governmental process, leaving the day -to -day functioning of the government in the hands of better trained administrators, while permitting control of the c -erall process by the party. a. Legislature The Federal Assembly as of late 1972 was empowered with full legislative initiative. A new sot of assembly bylaws published in April 1967 widened the ranks of persons and orgat a �ations having the right to initiate bills in the assembly. Previously, this had been the prerogative of the FEC (i.e., the government, or cabinet), individual deputies, and other federal organs. Now, economic enterprises, working and social political organizations such as SAWPY, and even individual citizens may do so. In addition to its legislative duties, the Federal Assembly has the responsibility of amending the Constitution, calling for referendums, granting amnesties for violations of federal laws, electing and removing the President of the Republic, tl.c President of the FEC, the president and judges of the constitutional, supreme, and supreme economic courts, fedetal state secretaries and federal secretaries, and the federal public prosecutor. Nominations aril dismissals are made by submission of the appropriate proposal to the assembly's Commission for Elections and Appointments, which returns its recommenda- tions to the assembly. The assembly also is responsible for declaring war, ratifying international agreements, and deciding on altering Yugoslavia's boundaries. The Federal Assembly's unique and complicated structure of five chambers is under ;ntensive review and will undoubtedly he streamlined into it unicameral or bicameral legislature. Until then, however, the Chamber of Nationalities remains the most important house. It considers all legislation and matters of foreign policy, national defense, state security, and \"affairs of general internal policy.\" It also exercises the assembly's rights of appointment and dismissal. An exception to this rule is the requirement APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2009/06/16: CIA- RDP01- 00707R000200100033 -9 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2009/06/16: CIA- RDP01- 00707R000200100033 -9 r JUOICUL LE01lLATIY[ E1IECUTIYE ADMINISTRAtIVE Constitutional Court President J osip Broz Tito Chamber of ..ti National Natlonolitles Vice President Defense Supreme Court (140 members) Council Supreme Economic r Court Social- Political Chamber f (120 Members) Supreme Military Standing Commissions Court Social Welfare and Health PREMIER Il) Foreign Affairs and Security 1 (2) Sociopolitical and Organization :1 Chamber 3 Economic Policy VICE PREMIER O Ec c cY (120 Members Federal Public VICE PREMIER 14) Foreign Economic Relations Prosecutor SECRETARY'] 15) Budgetary Affairs (6) Personnel and Acminisaative 7 Federal Secretaries far: i Affairs 5 ti Education and Culture F (7) Mobilization Preparation I I) Economy P Chamber (120 Members) 121 Labor and Social Policy of Fed -rat Agencies a (3) Finance \"I Housing Questions (4) Foreign Trade \"I (9) Control of Federal Seamy (5) Foreign Affairs q Service In Federal r r (6) National Defense Administrative Organs i Economic Chamber (7) Justice and General (10) Coordintollon and Cooperation (120 Members) {s Administration between Yugoslavia and r. 1 (e) Agriculture r 'f CEMA internal i (10) Transportation and Communication .l Infer�Republic Commdfees (I) Development Policy 12) Mbnetary System (3) Foreign Trade and Currency Systems F A d vi sory Counals s (4) Unified Market m 1 (5) Financial Mothers :5 Legal Council t Economic Council J IIVIILIC t P.

Constitutional changes in December 1968 created the Social Political Chamber, which is nearly equal in authority with the Chamber of Nationalities. This, chamber deals with questions concerning the sociopolitical system, self management, the rights and duties of citizens, general internal policy, budgetary and fiscal policy, and national defense. The other three chambers, whose continued exisLance is in doubt in view of the progressive limitations on federal authority, are specialized both in vhcir composition and legislative focus. Designated the Economic, the Social Welfare ,,nd Health, and the Education and Culture Chambers, they deal with 6 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2009/06/16: CIA- RDP01- 00707R000200100033 -9 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2009/06/16: CIA- RDP01- 00707R000200100033 -9 legislation primarily within their specialized fields. Approval by the Chamber of Nationalities and at cast one of the other appropriate chambers is necessary to pass legislation. The assembly as a whole and the individual chambers have substantive commissions and committees to carry out work on behalf of the Federal Assembly. The commissions are autonomous, while the committees only assist the organization to which they are subordinate. The membership of the Federal Assembly consists of 620 deputies. The Chamber of Nationalities has 140; and each of the other four chambers has 120 deputies. Most deputies maintain their r.rimary jobs elsewhere and are only reimbursed for the time actually spent on assembly business. This system has been the cause of complaints that most deputies are too busy with their outside jobs to carry out their assembly duties, and that attendance at assembly and committee sessions is often low. Of the 620 deputies in the. assembly, 480 are elected in proportion to the population on the basis of five deputies �one in each chamber �to approximately 158,000 citizens. Electoral districts by law are to be as nearly equal in population as possible. Of the 120 deputies in each chamber elected by lower assemblies, 50 are from the republic of Serbia, including i2 from the autonomous province of Vojvodina and six from the autonomous province of Kosovo, 27 from Croatia, 21 from Bosnia and Hercegovina, 10 from Slovenia, nine from Macedonia, and three from Montenegro. The 140 deputies comprising the Chamber of Nationalities represent the republics and autonomous provinces in the ratio of 20 deputies from each republic and 10 from each autonomous province. The overall distribution of deputies in the Federal Assembly is as follows: Serbia 240 Croatia 128 Bosnia and Hercegovina 104 Slovenia 60 Macedonia 56 Montenegro 32 On the basis of deputy strength, Serbia, Bosnia and Hercegovina, and Montenegro, all with large economically underdeveloped areas, dominate the assembly. The increase in authority of the Chamber of Nationalities partly counterbal..ances this domination, since the more economically advanced republics of Sloveria and Croatia and underdeveloped Macedonia have 60 out of 140 votes in the chamber. So far, however, bloc voting by republic delegations has been rare. Party discipline insures that the overwhelming majority of deputies will vote on any major issue as the leadership demands. The assembly does not publish information on the party status of its members, but all the top hierarchy and the great majority of the deputies belong to the party. Since 1963 the regime has achieved some success in its efforts to bring younger, better qualified persons into 011c assembly. Most of the assembly's leadership, however, remains in the hands of long- time subordinates of Tito who started their climb to prominence in the 1950's. In carrying out its responsibility for \"political supervision\" as-'provided in the Constitution, the assembly decides on political matters and determines the foundations of domestic and foreign policy, establishes the duties of federal authorities and organizations which enforce the laws, debates the reports of federal courts and the Federal Public Prosecutor concerning the enforcement of federal laws, enacts declarations and resolutions, and makes recommendations to federal organizations. In keeping with the regime's efforts to extend the role of the APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2009/06/16: CIA- RDP01- 00707R000200100033 -9 FIGURE 2. The Yugoslav parliament, Belgrade (U /OU) APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2009/06/16: CIA- RDP01- 00707R000200100033 -9 republics in the policymaking process, the assembly increasingly consults the republic legislatures before making important decisions. The Federal Assembly's first attempts to exercise its authority under the 1963 Constitution were halting. With the League of Communists' reaffirmation of decentralization and self management at the Eighth Party Congress in December 1964, however, the legislature began to assert its authority. The social plan for 1965 was returned to the FEC for redrafting I l times before tue assembly accepted it, and adverse reaction in the assembly has forced the government to withdraw several bills from consideration since 1964. By late December of 1970 the Federal Assembly was flexing new political muscle. A government proposal to limit personal income growth for 1971 to 22% was resoundingly rejected by the assembly, which later forced the government to compromise on the issue. The legislative process envisages three stages. all of which occur within the Federal Assembly: 1) the determination of the need for adopting a law; 2) the examination and adoption of a draft law; and 3) the examination and adoption of the proposed law. In practice, the Federal Executive Council drafts most of the important legislation. Despite efforts to make available to the assembly the services of legal and substantive experts, the deputies remain at a disadvantage vis -a -vis the executive in preparing coherent alternative legislation or programs to those offered by the government. Debate in the Federal Assembly has become increasingly free since 1963. Party leaders, such as Kardelj, have emphasized the responsibility of the deputies not only to the party but to their constituents. After the fall of Rankovic, important party figures, such as Milentije Popovic and Krste Crvenkovski, pressed for more real exercise of authority by the assembly. The attempt to bring foreign policy within the purview of parliamentary debate, which started in January 1966 with criticism of certain elements of the periodic policy report of the Federal State Secretary for Foreign Affairs to the assembly, was pressed forward. Tito's independent executive action during the Middle East crisis of June 1967 caused considerable irritation within the assembly and the LCY, both considering his move a deliberate disregard of the pariiamentary right of consultation. As part of the emphasis on the responsibility of the executive to parliament, the 1963 Constitution grants to deputies the right of interpellation of government officials. Even more emphatic in the assertion of parliamentary supremacy are the rules on FEC resignations and votes of confidence contained in the assembly bylaws. The must resign if it does not agree with or cannot put into practice a policy fixed by the assembly. Resignation of the FEC also is called for if the assembly passes a bill not endorsed by the FEC, or if the assembly votes down a government bill. Resignations may be collective or individual. Provision also is made for vc,tes of confidence initiated by the assembly, 10 deputies being needed to ask for such a vote. Upon losing a vote of confidence the government must resign and act as a caretaker until a new one is elected. Although party discipline serves to keep the deputies in hue on all important issues, the principle of executive responsibility could lead to a more vigorous parliamentary life, particularly after Tito leaves the scene. In December 1966 the Slovenian republic executive council forced the first government crisis since the pre -World War II era by resigning after one chamber of the republic assembly had rejected an important bill. Although the breach was quickly healed, a precendent had been set. In July 1967 Federal Executive Council President (Premier) Mika Spiljak, under fire by critics of the high unemploy- ment and economic stagnation resulting from the regime's policies, asked for and received a vote of confidence in the government's program for social and economic reform. In mid November 1970 Vice Premier Nikola Miljanic, in an unprecedented action, resigned when he was unable to win backing for his proposed policy of dinar devaluation. b. Executive (1) Presidency �The need to institutionalize the succession process, rather than court chaos once Tito leaves the scene, led to the creation of a collective Presidency in 1971. The body is composed of three representatives from each of Yugoslavia's six republics and two each from the two autonomous provinces. The president of each republic or provincial assembly is automatically a member of this body. Other members are elected for nonsuccessive, 5 -year terms by a majority vote in the regional assemblies. Tito retains the titular position of President of Yugoslavia for an indefinite period. Once Tito is gone, however, a president will be chosen from among the other 22 members of the Presidencv who are currently in charge of day -to -day executive duties. The collective Presidency retains considerable powers in representing the country at home and abroad: The titular President is commander and chief of the armed forces; the Presidency has the right to propose policy direction to the Federal Assembly, and can initiate changes in the 9 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2009/06/16: CIA- RDP01- 00707R000200100033 -9 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2009/06/16: CIA- RDP01- 00707R000200100033 -9 Constitution; the Presidency also has the right to propose a candidate for the post of President of the Federal Executive Council (Premier), issues decrees proclaiming federal laws, proposes the election of the President and the judges of the constitutional court of Yugoslavia, nominates members of the Council of the Federation and submits proposals for relieving them of their duties. (2) Federal Executive Council �The FEC is responsible for executing the policy established by the Federal Assembly in its laws and resolutions. The Premier (President of the FEC) is confirmed by the assembly following his nomination and is responsible to the assembly. As of late 1972 the FEC consisted of 28 memo -rs including the Premier, two vice premiers, and a secretary. There are 10 federal secretaries in the FEC. The major ones are: Foreign Affairs, National Defense, Economy, Finance, Foreign Trade, Labor and Social Policy, and Justice and General Administration. There are an equal number of members from each republic and corresponding numbers from the two autonomous provinces.' The FEC has no decision making powers outside those granted it in federal legislation. The FEC can, however, propose internal and foreign policy to the assembly ind prepare drafts of laws, the economic (social) plan, and the budget. It also can ratify international agreements riot within the jurisdiction of the Federal Assembly. In addition to the above duties, the FEC enforces federal law, the federal economic plan, and the federal budget. The FEC also supervises certain functions of the federal administration not within the jurisdiction of the Federal Assembly, proposes officers of the Federal Supreme Court, and through its inter republic committees works to resolve differences and disputes. The heads of the different bodies are proposed by the Premier and appointed or dismissed by the Federal Assembly. The federal secretaries are appointed and dismissed by the Federal Assembly on the proposal of the Premier. Higher officials are limited to no more than two consecutive 4 -year terms in office. Under the theory embodied in the Constitution, second terms are envisaged as exceptions to the rule. The federal administrative apparatus has been reorganized on several occasions. In 1967, eight secretariats (justice, education and culture, health and 'For a current listing of key government officials consult Chiefs of State and Cabinet ,Members of Foreign Governments, published monthly by the Directorate of Intelligence, Central Intelligence Agency. 10 social policy, labor, information, industry and trade, agriculture and forestry, and communications) were eliminated and their functions distributed among other federal bodies or passed down to the republics. The National Defense Council has a special position. Although characterized by one Yugoslav authority as a body of the Federal Assembly, the Law on the Yugoslav National Defense Council passed in April 1967 describes it only as a \"federal organ.\" The council is headed by the President of the Republic, who may propose one of the council's members to act as his deputy. The National Defense Council has no executive authority; its function is to coordinate national defense preparations. It must render opinions about pertinent draft economic plans and regulations, particularly Those involving funds for national defense. Decisions of the council must be carried out by the Federal State Secretary for National Defense. The reorganized council is composed of 30 members, including the President, the Federal State Secretary for National Defense, and the armed forces Chief of General Staff. In terms of civilian membership, the council is one of the most prestigious groups within the government. All six of the presidents of the republic executive councils are ex officio members, thus insuring that the views of the republics are adequately represented. The Council of the Federation, first instituted under the 1963 Constitution, is a consultative body with no administrative, legislative, or executive powers. It is supposed to consider the most important questions of domestic and foreign policy and to advise the President of the Republic, who is also its president. Members of the Council of the Federation are elected by the assembly upon their nomination by the President of the Republic. There is no fixed number of members; after the national elections of 1971 there were 100, including Tito. The council serves as a pool of elder statesmen upon which Tito can draw, and it has been used as a place for honorable retirement for older functionaries. Its members can be authorized to represent the President of the Republic at home and abroad. 3. Republic government The relationship between the provincial and republic governments and the federation is undergoing extensive review and revision. The republics and provinces have been granted increased autonomy as the result of the 1971 constitutional reforms. The federal government's authority is limited to maintaining national defense, conducting foreign APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2009/06/16: CIA- RDP01- 00707R000200100033 -9 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2009/06/16: CIA- RDP01- 00707R000200100033 -9 policy, the maintenance of it uniform economic system, and the right to channel funds to less developed regions. In theory all other powers pass to the republics. Whereas under the 1963 Constitution the republics could only legislate in areas where they had been given specific authority, the federal government now is bound by that restriction. In the event of disagreements between republics or between the federal government and the republics, there are inter republic committees in the FFC designed to resolve problems. Should it dispute go to court, the federal Supreme Court has the power to resolve legal disputes or to determine what is or is not constitutional. Under the 1963 Constitution the Federal Assembly passed \"general laws\" in such fields as education, culture, health, and social welfare. General laws are riot directly enforceable by the federal government, thus leaving room for genuine republic legislation, as long as the legislation follows the basic policy set forth in the federal general laws. The constitutional amendments due to be published in late 1973 should continue to give the Federal Assembly a guiding role in passing general laws which in turn will be adopted, modified, or adjusted to fit republic and provincial needs. Tht republic assemblies generally resemble the Federal Assembly in structure and methods of operation, with the exception that no republic has a chamber of nationalities. Since the republics are not truly sovereign entities, they have no chiefs of state equivalent to the President of Yugoslavia, although Slovenia has proposed the creation of a collective executive body paralleling the federal collective presidency. In each republic the top governmental leader is the president of the republic assembly, and, by virtue of this office, is an ex officio member of the federal collective Presidency. Each republic has its own executive council. The basic structure of government administration is the carne in each republic except for minor differences in keeping with local conditions. The republic executive councils perform all the functions falling within republic jurisdiction as specified by the feder and republic constitutions, laws, and decrees. Republic executive councils are elected by the respective republic chambers from among the membership of the entire republic assembly. The membership of the assemblies is elected by local governmental assemblies for 4 -year terms. The two autonomous provinces of Vojvodina and Kosovo have their own goveriv.nent structures, but they are also tied to the republic of Serbia. Both passed constitutional laws in 1969 institutionalizing the increased autonomy granted them by the 1968 changes in the federal Constitution. [n the past, federal supremacy over the republic governments %vas insured by the power of the federal administrative organs to stay the execution of acts of the republic governments which conflict with the federal laws. Under the 1971 -72 constitutional reforms this supremacy has limitations and pertains to areas where the federal government has specific authority, such as in the realm of foreign policy and the economy. Similarily, control over local governments by the republics is undergoing revision and will be altered by the constitutional reforms of 1973. In the past it operated through the power of the republic to oversee the organization and operations of local administration. 4. Local government Local government in Yugoslavia consists of only one major level, the commune (opstina). A district (srez) level, formerly intermediate between the commune and the republic, was abolished throughout the country by 1967. Larger cities, however, have special arrangements. For example, Zagreb is one large commune, with subordinate units similar to the wards found in U.S. cities. In keeps,, with the regime's efforts to streamline all levels of government by reducing the number of separate jurisdictions, the number of communes was reduced from 1,479 in 1956 V 501 in 1968, and may be reduced even further by the 1973 constitutional amendments. This consolida- tion was meant to give more decisionmaking power to self- management bodies at the lowest levels. A major aspect of the 1973 constitutional reforms will be greater autonomy for the communes. Thus the relationship between the communes and the republics, as well as between the communes aril the federal government, will be redefined. As the basic territorial unit in Yugoslavia, the commune is designed to be more than it device for local self- government. Yugoslav officials describe it as the \"fundamental cell of future socialist society. it structure removed from state control made up of autonomous economic organizations (enterprises and cooperatives) and these autonomous institutions providing social services (schools, cultural and artistic institutions, hospitals. hea establishments, and community institutions).\" The scope of the APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2009/06/16: CIA- RDP01- 00707R000200100033 -9 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2009/06/16: CIA- RDP01- 00707R000200100033 -9 commune's varying activities has been summarized by Yugoslav authorities as follows: The commune is completely autonomous as rega.ds the establishment of its economic plan and budgtt and the setting up of enterprises and communal institutions. The commune adopts its own regulatory pro- visions, which include administrative penalties. The commune applies directly the laws, rules, and regulations laid down by higher authorities; it is also responsible for administrative proceed- ings of first instance, and other administrative functions in all matters, except when: the applica- tion of laws, rules, and regulations has been en- trusted to other lower organs. The commune decides on the organization and operation of its organs and institutions, appoints its employees, and initiates proceedings for appeal for the protection of the rights of self government in cases where rule or regulation or any other act of the higher organs of the state violates one of its legal rights. The commune may repeal or declare null and void the unlawful acts of an economic organization or autonomous institution. Every commune passes its own statutes, based on federal and republic constitutions. Constitutional provisions bind the communes to enforce federal and republic laws. The highest communal body is the two house communal assembly, composed of a communal chamber and a chamber of working communities. Members are elected directly by local registered voters for 4 -year terms. The communal chamber is elected by all of the voters; the chamber of working communities is chosen by workers in both business and \"noneconomic\" enterprises. The communal assembly elects its president from among its own membership. The president in turn appoints a communal secretary who is in charge of the communal administration. Each commune has several administrative departments concerned with carrying out the policies and decisions of the communal assembly. Councils act as intermediary units between the assembly and the various administrative bodies, setting broad policy for the administrative organs and the local specialized professional agencies. The councils, composed of members appointed by the assembly and by organizations directly involved in the app- oprrate field also monitor the activities of the various enterprkes within the commune. Each commune assembly plays a significant role in administering the economy within its territorial jurisdiction. The 1963 Constitution gives communal delegates a position in the appointments commissions which select the directors of economic enterprises after 12 preliminar: public competition for the jobs. The commune also may supervise the legality of the acts of workers councils and administrative committee, of enterprises, as well as their performance of obligatory responsibilities and financial operations. The commune assembly, however, is not authorized to interfere in the internal organization and daily operation of economic enterprises. Federal legislation in 1964 and 1965 attempted tc curb the communes' investment making functions which local authorities had fulfilled by draining cif enterprise funds through taxation. The restrictive legislation complemented the measures contained in the 1965 economic reforms which left more investment funds in the hands of the enterprises. Communal investment was limited to nonecoromic\" projects, such as schools, housing, and public utilities. A persistent and major problem in the Yugoslav communal system has been the -lash between local communal interests and those of the republic and the federation. Control over the communes to insure compliance with the policies of the central regime usually has been exerted indirectly, through the SAWPY, the trade unions, and federal investment legislation. As a last resort, Communist party discipline may be invoked to subdue recalcitrant localists. The institution of the communal system was meant to provide a uniform system of local administration sensitive to local peculiarities but still carefully controlled. Differences in the level of economic development among the communes, however, have made their performance uneven. The wealthier communes usually operate effectively. The per- formance of those in the underdeveloped areas is often poor. Some !ocal governments cannot offer minimal health or utility services. The constitutional guarantee of financial aid to such communes is often left unfulfilled. Low educational levels continue to handicap communes in discharging their complicated tasks. Many assemblies, especially in the more backward rural regions, have been dominated by their administrative apparatus, and particularly by the communal secretary, who usually has high standing in the local Communist party organization. The development of autonomy among the communes and their assumption of increased tasks also has produced a sharp increase in the number of local government employees. The economy drive, which started with the economic reforms in July 1965, has not yet seriously reduced this relatively large bureaucracy.

The most important revisions were the establishment of the Constitutional Court �to ruie on the constitutionality of all laws and regulations �and an attempt to create an independent court system. Constitutional courts were also established in each republic. The federal Constitution granted greater autonomy and independence to lower court!, and increased their authorit% to settle a wide variety of cases. Since the purge of Rankovic in 1966, the emphasis in \"ugoslavia has been on rule by law. Under this sy cm the courts have steadily increased in importance. Reforms initiated in the immediate post Rankovie period increased the rights of the accused in criminal cases and curtailed the authority of the secret police. Although the changes in the judicial system since 1963 represent a liberal trend, other factors continue to make the legal system an instrument of control. The regime still adheres to the tenet that loci ^list law is an \"instrument in the hands of the ruling socialist forces.\" The Communist party maintains control over the court system through the election and appointment of its members to judgeships and other legal posts. Yugoslavia's Constitutional Court is an institution not found in other Communist countries and differs in important aspects from constitutional courts based on English common law. It is composed of a :)resident and 13 judges. In keeping with the policy of balanced representation in all federal organs, the court's members include two iudges from each republic and one from each province. The Constitution specifically grants them \"immunity\" from arrest and trial for actions taken in performance of their duty. Although the court has as one of its main functions the task of insuring that laws and regulations conform to the Constitution, the court is at the same time a political entity with nonjudicial functions. These include the responsibility to keep itself informed about matters pertaining to \"dw attainment of constitutionality and legality.\" The Constitution also gives the court the responsibility for protecting \"the rights of self government and other basic freedoms and rights established by the Constitution.\" In performing these tasks the court does not require that a case be brought before it in order to render a decision. Not only may it act on its own initiative, bot it has a responsibility to do so. In keeping with the court's advisory role, all draft federal legislation is sent to it for informal inspection and approval. The Constitutional Court also conducts an extensive program of research, investigation, conferences, reports, and negotiations on many aspects of government. The Constitution makes the court responsible for deciding on the c rnformity of federal, republican, and local laws with the federal Constitution, for resolving disputes on rights and duties between the federation and a republic, between republics, and between other social- political communities on the territories of two or more republics. The court also is responsible for protecting the workers councils and self management bodies from encroachment and arbitrary actions by governmental organs. In an attempt to open the court's activities to public inspection, its rules of procedure provide that most hearings will be public, that they may be televised or broadcast, and that hearings need not be held in the court's main offices in Belgrade. This stress on publicity is consistent with the regime's emphasis on publicity and public participation in all of Yugoslav political life. The courts early decisions /ere in favor of the rights of individuals and workers councils. The court caused small sensation in December 1964 when it annulled governmental regulation �the first time this had happened under Communist rule in Yugoslavia. The court, however, bas never challenged the government on an issue of major importance to the regime. Its most usefu! `unction has been as a safety valve for the grievances of the population and as an influence toward the rule of law in a one -party state. There are two broad categories of courts: courts of general jurisdiction that deal with most criminal and civil cases, and specialized courts military and economic. The courts of general jurisdiction exist on the communal, provincial, republic, and federal levels, and include the Federal Supreme Court of Yugoslavia and republic supreme courts. The republic and provincial supreme courts are charged with establishing and safeguarding the uniformity and constitutionality of republic laws. The Federal Supreme Court is the highest court in the general juridical system and has the primary function of nsuring the uniform application of law by all courts, to review the decisions of republic courts, to revise the decisions of lower courts which violate federal law, and to adjudicate conflicts of jurisdiction between republic courts. Matters of constitutional interpretation which arise in the course of the Supreme Court's proceedings are referred to the federal 13 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2009/06/16: CIA- RDP01- 00707R000200100033 -9 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2009/06/16: CIA- RDP01- 00707R000200100033 -9 Constitutional Court. In this way the Federal Supreme Court connects and unites all the other courts, except the Constitutional Court, into one juridical system. The lower courts of general jurisdiction deliberate on three fundamental types of cases: r .imirwl, civil, and administrative. Criminal cases are those in which the courts pass judgment on criminal offenses and carry out the laws and regulations which describe which acts are punishable, under what conditions, and according to what procedure. Civil cases primarily involve litigation on propert family, and personal rights. Administrative suits are those brought at the request of a person who challenges the lawfulness of it decision passed by an administrative bodv. The economic courts have fundamental jurisdiction over economic acts, damage suits, maritime suits, and criminal suits pertaining to economic offenses. The highest such court is the Supreme Economic Court. Permanent arbitration boards, which act as courts, handle n,nv economic disputes. Although not as important as the courts of general jurisdiction, c--onomic courts are growing in importance, particularly at the local levels, where the self management responsibilities of economic organiza- tions have resulted in competition and rivalry. The Foreign Trade Arbitration Board is responsible for resolving economic and maritime disputes in the field of foreign trade. The military colut system is made up of the Supreme Military Court and various courts at lower levels. 'Their competence is limited to criminal cases involving military personnel. Yugoslav military personnel have the right to a civilian as well as a military lawyer when being arraigned before it military tribunal. The civilian may be excluded from the hearings if military secrets are discussed. Judges for courts of general jurisdiction are nominated and elected I y the assemblies of the appropriate sociopolitical communities, according to the prescriptions of republic laws. Judgr cannot be members of the assemblies which elect them, nor can they perform other duties or functions which conflict with their court functions. A Yugoslav citizen who is it graduate lawyer can be elected as judge of general jurisdiction. Prosecution of criminal cases rests in the hands of public prosecutors. Constitutionally their office is autonomous, entrusted wi!'. criminal prosecution, and responsible for assuring the uniform enforcement of law and the promotion of legality. A separate military prosecutor exercises similar functions in the arned forces. The m;litary courts, in addition to trying ..0litary personnel, are authorized to try nonmilitary I persons for all criminal act:; committed against the armed forces. Public prosecutors have the power to demand information from state bodies and institutions and from economic and social organizations. There is a disciplinary court to try offenses committed by prosecutors or their employees. The ?'F;C nominates the Federal Public Prosecutor. After discussing the nomination, the Federal Assembly Commission for Elections and Appointments submits it to the voto of the Federal Assembly. A constitutional amendment passed in April 1967 invests the various republic assemblies with the authority to appoint or dismiss republic public prosecutors, thus widening republic authority over law enforement. Previously, the republic prosecutors had been named by the Federal Public Prosecutor with the approval of the pertinent republic executive council. A new code of criminal procedure which went into effect on 1 January 1968 is designed to better protect the rights of the accused. The conduct of preliminary investigations to secure evidence for indictments has he,m taken away from the public prosecutors and internal affairs organs and vested in the courts. Previously the public prosecutor had held a privileged position during an investigation and trial. Under the new legislation, the defense attorney may examine the records of the investigarion and cannot be prohibited from communicating with his client if the latter is held in custody. The accused must be informed of his right to legal counsel during interrogations, and defense counsel may submit questions at an interrogation. Those summoned must attend an interrogation but need not answer any questions. The time limits for confinement during an investigation have been reduced from 9 to 6 months, and the court or appropriate organ of internal affairs is obliged to notify the family of a person held in custody within 24 hours of his confinement. The new code of criminal proceedings balanced the extension of the rights of the accused, however, by extending the legal obligat;on to report c�rimr,al acts to include all working and other organizations, in addition to state agencies. The changes in criminal procedure have placed it considerable strain on the Yugoslav judicial system which is short of personnel, particularly the newly important investigativ: judges. The new prerogatives given to the defense have increased the willingness of some lawyers to engage in practice, however, thus partially alleviating the shortage of lawyers. There were about 3,044 lawyers in Yugoslavia in 1970, more than 700 more than in 1966. Lawyers tend to settle in APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2009/06/16: CIA- RDP01- 00707R000200100033 -9 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2009/06/16: CIA- RDP01- 00707R000200100033 -9 the larger urban areas, however, leaving many rural communes with no practicing la%%yers at all. jury trial in the Western sense does not exist in Yugoslavia. Instead, a system of lay judges is used in association with the body of professional judges, particularly in the lower courts. These laymen are supposed to have an equal vote on the outcome of the trial. Theoretically, the laymen can force an opinion contrary to that of the professionals, although this is almost unheard of in practice. The 1963 Constitution encouraged an increase in the number of such courts and in the types of cases to be tried in them. Despite the regime's continued determination to maintain control of the judicial appa!atus, the Yugoslav courts have demonstrated some inde- pendence from political control. In quashing one of the government's charges against maverick intellec- tual Mihajlo Mihajlov in 1965, the Supreme Court of Croatia contradicted Tito's publicly implied desire to jail the young man. C. Political dynamics (C) All political power in Yugoslavia ultimately rests with the Communist party, officially the League of Communist, of Yugoslavia (LCY). The fact that Yugoslavia is a one -party state, However, has not prevented the emergence of political pressure groups, such as the trade union organization, which do influence the country's political dynamics. The decentralized structure of the LCY itself and the party's decision io rule indirectly by influencing various mass organizations L!:A self managing bodies has led to a frank and open political life not known anywhere else in Eastern Europe. The process which has led to a political style st atypical for a Communist state began in the years following Yugosl. o via's expulsion from the Cominform in 1948, when the party began drastically to alter its original Soviet style of rule. The party was repeatedly reorganized and reformed to reflect both in theory and practice an increasingly decentralized and self managed economic system. These changes, including the removal of party hacks from direct administration of the economy, were the nucleus for what was to become extensive public participation in Yugoslavia's political life. The trend became more pronounced after the purge in Juiy 1966 of Aleksandar Rankovic, Tito's long -tirne organizational chief aril leader of the conservative, centralist wing of the party. Until the early 1960's the LCY remained remarkably stable. With the increased emphasis on decentralization and democratization, however, three distinct, but informal, groups have emerged in the party. First, there are the ultraliberals who wish to push for maximum democratization, even to the point of advocating a multiparty system within a socialist context. Opposite these ultraliberals are the hardline conservatives, once led by Rankovic, who hacked a more centralized party government and economic system. The third major intraparty group, probably the largest of the three, falls in the center, and L led by Tito. It rejects both Western liberal democracy and a tightly controlled centralist system. Although these ideological differences have been developed over many years, they have been reflected in ruptures in the top party hierarchy only twice since the break with Moscow. In 1954 Milovan Djilr-s was politically excommunicated for having \"revisionist\" ideas and advocating a multiparty system. In 1966 Aleksandar Rankovic was driven from his party and government offices for engaging in a \"power struggle\" to insure his succession to Tito and for leading the conservative, centralist opposition to Tito's economic and political reforms. In the cases of both Djilas and Rankovic, relatively few members of the party elite were immediately purged. After the fall of Rankovic, a 3 -year campaign, culminating in the Ninth Party Congress in March 1969, brought a greater number of younger, third generation Communists into the leadership. Tito generally has b(. -n able to surround himself with loyal subordinates, whose careers have depended on his favor. Self- interest is reinforced by the bonds of common Communist objectives. In addition, mutual respect forged during the hardships of the partisan struggle during Wr War II still plays an important role. The ouster of Rankovic has not ended the resistance of the conservative centralists, who draw most of their strength from the ranks of ex- partisans, middle and lower level party officials, and ill educated older party members. Although many such persons hack the reforms, many prefer to insure the party's continued domination by the more traditional methods of force, pressure, and \"political intervontion.\" Also involved is the fear that many anti reformers have for their jobs and economic and social status. Having lived on their partisan merits for 20 years, many lack the skills necessary to manage an increasingly sophisticated -ociety and economy. Cutting across ideological considerations and breaching the solidarity of the LCY are growing economic and nationalist rivalries among the country's five major nationalities. The LCY is made up of six republic and two provincial parties (the latter two are under the suzerainty of the Serbian party 15 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2009/06/16: CIA- RDP01- 00707R000200100033 -9 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2009/06/16: CIA- RDP01- 00707R000200100033 -9 organization). The interplay of party and government reforms and the freer political climate which has emerged in Yugoslavia have contributed to the surfacing of bitter, deep regional rivalries. This problem of maintaining the LCY as it unifying factor continued throughout 1972. Tito's insistance on bringing the regional organizations to heel, and the Serbian party leadership's resistance to recentraliza- tion brought the crisis to a head again in the fall of 1972. On 21 October Tito carried the day, and party boss Marko Nikezic as well as his second in command, Latinka Perovic, resigned. The Serbian leadership's demands were more the outcome of a dispute over what form the LCY should take and how tightly it need be organized than one of strong republic nationalist demands. At the heart of the Croatian demands, however, was the long- festering feud between the republic and the federal government over how much of its foreign currency earnings the republic should be allowed to retain. The Croatian complaint characterizes only one part of the nation's economic problem. In order to overcome the economic disparity between the underdeveloped republics Macedonia, Montenegro, and parts of Bosnia and Hercegovina and Serbia �and the more highly developed ones, the regime drains off investment funds generated by the prosperous republics of Croatia and Slovenia. even under the 1971 constitutional reforms which strip the federal government of much of its former power and aut!rority, Belgrade still retains the right to direct these funds to regions such as the economically depressed province of Kosovo. Thee retically, progress toward complete socialism and a high stage of economic development was to be simultaneous, with all the republics reaching that distant goal at the same time. Given the pragmatic nature of the Yugoslav system, however, socialism and economic development increasingly are not in step with each other. Increasingly, the regime is giving priority to economic performance over ideological considerations. Businessmen as well as government and party officials in Croatia an Slovenia resent the imposed commitment to subsidize the often economically irrational development of the poorer regions of the country. The political and economic reforms of the 1960's and early 1970's were in response to these complaints. Conversely, many Communist Serbs, Montenegrins, and officials in Bosnia and Hercegovina fear that the increased emphasis on profitability will eventually spell the end to federal aid to the underdeveloped regions. 16 Intellectual ferment has given added momentum to the movement toward political decentralization and democratization in Yugoslavia. The intellectuals, however, have also added to the nation's disunity. The Zagreb University faculty was a center of Croatian nationalist agitation which led to the crisis in December 1971. Similarly, the faculty at Pristina University in Kosovo province is sharply divided along nationality lines, i.e., the Albanian majority versus the Serb minority. Despite fluctuations in Tito's popularity over the years, he remains the most powerful and only widely accepted leader in the country. His defiance of the Soviet Union in 1918 �and subsequently his condemnation of Soviet action in Hungary in 1956 and in Czechoslovakia in 1968 �have earned him the respect of moss of his people. Tito has personally built the party and personifies the system which now bears his name Titoism. Having led the country through the crucial W;>rld War II years, he was a national figure by the end of the war, with a personal following that extended well beyond the Communists. He directed the unification and reconstruction of the country after a bloody fratricidal war and provided the leadership for the establishment of a new and unique system of socialism. Tito has been called the only true Yugoslav, and his efforts :.A emphasis on \"brotherhood and unity\" have given the country an aura of Yugoslav nationalism which had not existed before. Tito's position as the indispensable man in Yugoslavia was reinforced again in December 1971 when he personally intervened to settle the Croatian crisis. His indispensability, therefore, makes the question of who will succeed him of crucial importance. Although apparently in good health, Tito's advanced age (80 in 1972) and occasional illnesses periodically arouse speculation that he is about to die or retire. Since the mid- 1960's he has dealt less and less --vith the dav -to -dav details of government, reserving his energy for the conduct of foreign affairs and for acting as arbiter in party factional disputes. The succession of power in the government was spelled out in the 1971 constitutional reform. A collective Presidency of 23 men was created. From this body it Vice President is chosen who will act for the President if he should die or be unable to fulfill his tasl.s. Once \"Tito is gone, a President will be chosen from this body to hold office for 1 year. In the party, where the real power rests, the succession is less clear. A 15- nernber collective body called the Executive Bureau was created at the Ninth APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2009/06/16: CIA- RDP01- 00707R000200100033 -9 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2009/06/16: CIA- RDP01- 00707R000200100033 -9 Party Congress in .969. This body, however, proved unwieldy and became a forum for regional bickering, for example during the Croatian crisis. As a result, the bureau has been pared down to eight members: on from each of the six republics and one from each of the two provinces. Slovenian Stane Dolanc, as the Executive Bureau's secretary, has emerged as the key figure in this body. No single individual has emerged as heir to replace Tito in the party. The creation of the party Executive Bureau in fact suggests that a collective party leadership will replace Tito. Moreover, unlike Tito, no individual is likely to hold both the offices of President of the Republic and leader of the LCY. Among those who are likely to play key roles in some form of collective leadership are Executive Bureau members Stane Dolanc, Kiro Cligorov, and Jure Bilic; Federal Assembly President Miialko Todorovic; collective Presidency members Krste Crvenkovski, Ilamdija Pozderac, and Vidoje 'Larkovic; Serbian part%- leader Marko Nikezic; and Presidium member and chief ideologue Edvard Kardelj (Figure 3). With local nationalism under- mining the usefulness of the party as a unifying element, the army and its leadership may wield considerable political powershould Tito die in the first half of the 1979's. 1. Party development During and immediately after World War 11 the Communist Party of Yugoslavia (almost completely domestic in origin, training, and experience) used harsh police -state methods to insure its absolute control. A People's Front was established as a Com tit tin ist- dominated political grouping that included fellow- traveling representatives of non- Communist parties. Every mass organization was dominated by Con�munist elements, and party cells were established ui all public organizations. All opposition was eliminated as reactionary or collaborationist, and the party quickly took control of the economy and the judiciary. In mid 1948, however, the hitter argument between Tito and the Soviet leadership over the question of the subordination of national Communist parties to the Communist Party of the Soviet Union resulted in Yugoslavia's expulsion from the Corninform (successor to the Comintern). Stalin hegan to apply an economic blockade, threatened troop maneuvers on Yugoslavia's frontiers, and issued propaganda calling for the overthrow of the \"Belgrade clique.\" The Yugoslav regime, however, successfully defied Stalin and embarked upon a thorough overhaul of the theory and practice of cornrnunism as it applied to Yugoslavia. Realizing the need for popular support, the regime introduced a series of measures between 1950 and 1953 which increased its popularity. The activities of the secret police were curtailed, legal procedures were strengthened, compulsory deliveries of agricultural produce were stopped, peasant collectives were allowed to disband, and such Soviet trappings as \"socialist realism\" in the arts were deemphasized. In a surprise move the regime also called for the elimination of special privileges for party members, declaring that the legal position of Communists was exactly the same as that of non Communists and that party members were to use persuasion, not force, in achieving their goals. Concomitantly, the regime instituted a broad program of local self management in the economy and decentralization of government administration. Workers councils were instituted to supervise the management of economic enterprises. With these moves, the regime changed its tactics toward the Soviets from defensive to offensive. Stalin's \"state capitalism\" and \"bureaucracy\" were sharply criticized anI compared unfavorably with the new Yugoslav system of decentralization and social self management. At the center of the Yugoslav attack was its argument about the need for the state to begin \"withering away immediately\" as called for by Lenin, rather than having this postponed to some indefinite time in the future. Moreover, at the Yugoslav Sixth Party Congress in November 1952 Tito went so far as to say that the part� itself would \"wither away.\" By 1966, however, Tito and his lieutenants were denying that the party or state bureaucracy would soon completely vanish, asserting that both would be necessary for some time in the development of Yugoslav socialism. The June 1952 directives of the Central Committee established modifications in party theory and practice. The secretaries of local party organizations were ordered to give up their positions as heads of local governmental institutions in order to eliminate the \"bureaucratic caste system.\" The directives also ordered party officials to limit their interference in economic operations, and gave local party units more autonomy in order to increase intraparty democracy in ideological and educational work. The Sixth Party Congress put the stamp of approval on these changes. Specifically, the congress proclaimed that the party would confine its activities to political and ideological education and would no longer seek to impose its will on governmental and other state activities by direct order. Party deliberations were to he open to the public, and party members were told to exert influence not by the APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2009/06/16: CIA- RDP01- 00707R000200100033 -9 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2009/06/16: CIA- RDP01- 00707R000200100033 -9 President of Yugoslavia and President of the party (Croat) Age: BO Secretary of the party Executive Bureau (Slovene) Age: 47.
