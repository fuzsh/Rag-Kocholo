The (second) Siege of Gaeta was a battle of the War of Polish Succession. The Austrians at Gaeta withstood four months of siege from the Bourbon armies under Charles, Duke of Parma (later Charles III of Spain). They were defeated on August 6 1734 when the Spanish and French stormed the city. The Jacobite pretender Charles Edward Stuart participated in this battle.\n\nBkXXIX:Chap7:Sec2 Mentioned.\n\nGagarin, Grigory Ivanovich, Prince\n\nThe Russian Ambassador in Rome in 1828, he was exiled to Rome after having been a rival to Alexander I for the beautiful Madame Narischkin.\n\nBkXXIX:Chap5:Sec1 Mentioned.\n\nGaillard\n\nDoctor at St Helena, at Napoleon’s exhumation in 1840.\n\nBkXXIV:Chap16:Sec1 Mentioned.\n\nGaillard, Maurice-André\n\n1757-1844. A former colleague of Fouché at the College of Juilly (Oratorien), he was his ‘éminence grise’ in the Ministry of Police. He was named in 1810 as a Councillor to the Imperial Court.\n\nBkXXIII:Chap10:Sec1 In Ghent in 1815 during the Hundred Days.\n\nBkXXIII:Chap11:Sec1 His intrigues regarding the Congress of Vienna.\n\nGaleffi, Pier Francesco, Cardinal\n\n1770-1837.

Diocletian appointed him Caesar for the eastern part of the empire in 293 (Constantius I was Caesar of the West). On the abdication of Diocletian and Maximian in 305, he and Constantius succeeded as emperors. Galerius tried to increase his power, and after Constantius died in 306 he recognized Severus (d.307) as co-emperor in the West. Severus and he attempted without success to put down the claims of Maxentius. After they were defeated and Severus was captured, Galerius had Diocletian approve the appointment of Licinius as emperor of the West. Constantius’ son Constantine (Constantine I) and Maximin (d.313) then both claimed power. Galerius died before the confusion was eliminated by the victory of Constantine. Galerius had prompted the persecution of Christians under Diocletian but issued (309) an edict of toleration shortly before his death.\n\nBkXVIII:Chap6:Sec1 References to him, allusions to Napoleon, in Les Martyrs.\n\nGalicia\n\nThe medieval kingdom in North-west Spain, now an autonomous region with its own language and culture.\n\nBkI:Chap1:Sec9 Chateaubriand’s father attacked and robbed there.\n\nGall, François-Joseph\n\n1758-1828. Austrian anatomist. He devoted most of his life to a minute study of the nervous system, especially the brain. With the collaboration of a favourite pupil, John Caspar Spurzheim (1776–1832), he incorporated his research into a four-volume work and atlas that appeared from 1810 to 1819. Gall demonstrated that the white matter of the brain consists of nerve fibres, and he launched the doctrine of localization of various mental processes in the brain. Derided for his later involvement with the pseudoscience of phrenology, he left Austria but was received with honour in France and died a wealthy man in Paris. Spurzheim carried the teachings of Gall to England and the United States, also with great success.\n\nBkXIV:Chap1:Sec2 Present at a dinner at Madame de Custine’s.\n\nGallienus, Publius Licinius Valerianus Egnatius\n\nd. 268, Roman emperor. He ruled as the colleague (253–60) of his father, Valerian, and alone from 260–68. Gallienus checked the Alemanni near Milan. Later, however, the provinces became too rebellious. Postumus established his independence in Gaul, and in the East Odenathus. A force sent by Gallienus against Zenobia was defeated. Gallienus himself was murdered by his men at Milan, while resisting a revolt, eventually suppressed by his successor Claudius II. During his reign Gallienus reversed his father’s program of persecuting the Christians and managed to nurse the empire through a crucial period.\n\nBkXIII:Chap10:Sec2 His patronage of Plotinus.\n\nGallon or Gadlon or Gradlon, Celtish King\n\nc330.

It reached England in early February 1832, dying down by May, then Paris in late March where it remained until late September, killing over eighteen thousand people.\n\nGanymede\n\nThe son of Tros, brother of Ilus and Assaracus, he was loved by Zeus because of his great beauty. Zeus, in the form of an eagle, abducted him and made him his cup-bearer.\n\nBkXXXIX:Chap5:Sec1 A statue of the abduction.\n\nGap\n\nThe capital of the Hautes-Alpes department of south-east France, on the Luye River at the foot of the Dauphiné Alps, it was founded by Augustus c.14 BC and was the capital of medieval Gapen Cais, which was annexed to the crown of France in 1512.

He was minister of justice (1792-93) during the trial of Louis XVI and notified the king of the death verdict. Appointed (1793) minister of the interior, he proved inadequate in the post. He was twice imprisoned during the Terror, and held high government posts after the terrorists were overthrown. He also served under the Empire. After the Restoration he was forced to retire (1816). Garat wrote many works of political reminiscence and history, notably his Mémoires historiques sur le XVIIIe siècle et sur M. Suard (1820).\n\nBkXI:Chap3:Sec1 His unkind article regarding Fontanes in the Mercure de France of 1st April 1780.\n\nBkXLII:Chap10:Sec1 He read Louis XVI’s sentence to the king on the evening of 20th January 1793.\n\nGarda, Lake\n\nThe largest lake in Italy, it is located about half-way between Venice and Milan. The lake and its shoreline are divided between the provinces of Verona (to the south-east), Brescia (south-west), and Trent (north). The ancient fortified town of Sirmione is located on the south of the lake: Catullus stayed there in a family villa. Virgil also celebrated the location.\n\nBkXX:Chap5:Sec3 Mentioned.\n\nGaronne\n\nA river of southwest France flowing about 350 miles generally northwest from the Spanish Pyrenees to join the Dordogne River north of Bordeaux and form the Gironde estuary.\n\nBkXX:Chap7:Sec1 Mentioned.\n\nGasc, Honorine\n\nfl. c1830.

The French authoress, who married the Receiver-General of the départment of the Riser or Ruhr. Her salon came to be frequented by all the distinguished litterateurs, musicians, actors and painters of the time. Her first literary production was a letter written in 1802 to the Journal de Paris, in defence of Madame de Staël’s novel, Delphine; and in the same year she published anonymously her first novel Laure d’Estell. Leonie de Montbreuse, which appeared in 1813, is considered by Sainte-Beuve her best work; but Anatole (1815), the romance of a deaf-mute, has perhaps a higher reputation.\n\nBkXVIII:Chap8:Sec2 Her intervention on Chateaubriand’s behalf.\n\nGay, Delphine\n\n1804-1855. Daughter of Sophie, the contemporary sketches which she contributed from 1836 to 1839 to La Presse, under the nom de plume of Charles de Launay, were collected as Lettres parisiennes (1843), and obtained a brilliant success. Contes d’une vieille fille a ses neveux (1832), La Canne de Monsieur de Balzac (1836) and Il ne faut pas jouer avec la douleur (1853) are among the best-known of her romances; and her dramatic pieces in prose and verse include L'École des journalistes (1840), Judith (1843), Cléopâtre (1847), Lady Tartufe (1853), and the one-act comedies, C'est la faute du mari (1851), La Joie fait peur (1854), Le Chapeau d'un horloger (1854) and Une Femme qui deteste son mari, which did not appear till after the author’s death.

The word gazette from the Italian gazetta signified a small coin, the cost of the first ‘gazette’ published in Venice in the seventeenth century. Richelieu used the Gazette to promote his political ideas.\n\nBkIV:Chap9:Sec2 It recorded Chateaubriand’s participation in the royal hunt, (on the 19th February 1787) in the edition of the 27th February 1787.\n\nBkXXIX:Chap15:Sec1 As an ultra-Royal paper it was hostile to Chateaubriand in the 1820’s.\n\nBkXXXIX:Chap10:Sec1 A reference to gazettes as Venetian in origin.\n\nGazette de Leyde\n\nFounded in 1677, the French language newspaper was published in Leiden.

It was muzzled by the Dutch Republicans in 1798.\n\nBkIV:Chap6:Sec1 Read by Chateaubriand’s father.\n\nGébert, for Gesbert, Jean-Baptiste\n\nGelée, Claude, see Claude Lorrain\n\nGellone\n\nSaint William of Gellone (755-c.812 or 814), was the second count of Toulouse from 790 until his replacement in 811. He is the hero of the Chanson de Guillaume, an early chanson de geste, and of several later sequels, which were categorized by thirteenth-century poets as the geste of Garin de Monglane. In 803, he took Barcelona from the Moors and in the next year (804) founded the monastery of Gellone (now Saint-Guilhem-le-Désert) near Lodève in the Diocese of Maguelonne, and made it subject to the famous Saint Benedict of Aniane, whose monastery was nearby. He became a monk there in 806, and later died there.\n\nBkXXX:Chap14:Sec1 Mentioned.\n\nGemünd\n\nA town near Villach.\n\nBkXLI:Chap1:Sec1 Chateaubriand there in 1833.\n\nGenesee River\n\nThe Genesee River's name is derived from the Iroquois meaning fine valley or pleasant valley.

Originally an ancient Celtic settlement, it was a focal point of the Reformation after the arrival of John Calvin in 1536.\n\nBkXVII:Chap3:Sec1 Chateaubriand there in 1805.\n\nBkXVII:Chap3:Sec2 The 19th century Fort d’Écluse (really two forts, one above and one below, connected by a stairway cut in the rock), southwest of Geneva, in a spectacular mountain situation, stands in a natural gateway between the Alps and the Jura, overlooking the Rhône valley. Gates once barred the defile.\n\nBkXXVII:Chap6:Sec1 BkXXXIV:Chap7:Sec1 The Pâquis Quarter is a somewhat bohemian area of Geneva on the right bank of the Rhône near the lake. Chateaubriand stayed there in 1831.\n\nBkXXIX:Chap9:Sec1 Simond died there in 1832.\n\nBkXXXIV:Chap5:Sec1 Chateaubriand states his intention of going there in 1831.\n\nBkXXXIV:Chap6:Sec1 Chateaubriand and his wife arrived there 23rd May 1831, and stayed in the Hotel des Etrangèrs or the Hotel Dejean, and soon took a furnished house with a garden in the same Pâquis quarter (on the 25th).\n\nBkXXXV:Chap20:Sec1 Chateaubriand arrived on the 11th September 1832 and took an apartment at what is now 13 Grand’ Rue on the 19th. Madame Récamier arrived from Zurich on the 7th October, stayed at the Hôtel du Nord and left on the 25th.

Born at Nanterre, near Paris, during the siege of Paris by Childeric, king of the Franks, she went out with a few followers and procured grain for the starving citizens. Childeric, though a pagan, respected her, and at her request spared the lives of many prisoners. When Attila and his Huns were approaching the city, the inhabitants asked her aid; and listening to her exhortations undertook prayer and penance, thus averting the impending scourge, as she had foretold. Clovis, when converted from paganism by his holy wife, Saint Clotilda, made Geneviève his constant adviser. Sainte-Geneviève Abbey, on a hill-top, is one of the oldest churches of Paris. Here were buried the Saint, patroness of the city, and Clovis, the first Frankish Merovingian king. Nearby is the Pantheon. All over the hill colleges and schools took up residence, as well as the University, the Sorbonne.\n\nBkXVIII:Chap1:Sec1 Mentioned.\n\nBkXXXIV:Chap15:Sec1 Her reliquary paraded during the plague in Paris in 1832.\n\nGeneviève de Brabant\n\nA heroine of medieval legend, probably based on the history of Marie of Brabant, wife of Louis II, Duke of Bavaria and Count Palatine of the Rhine. Marie of Brabant was supposed of infidelity and subsequently tried by her husband, found guilty and beheaded on the 18th January 1256. The charge was false and Louis afterwards had to do penance. The change in name from Marie to Genevieve may be traced back to a cult of St Genevieve (c420-c500), patroness of Paris. The Genevieve tale first obtained wide popularity in L'Innocence reconnue, ou vie de Sainte Genevieve de Brabant (1638) by the Jesuit René de Cerisiers (1603-1662).\n\nBkXXXVIII:Chap8:Sec1 Mentioned.\n\nGénie du Christianisme, Le\n\nThe Genius of Christianity, a work by Chateaubriand, started in England and completed at the country house at Savigny-sur-Orge of his mistress, Comtesse Pauline de Beaumont. Published complete in 1802, though an episode from it, Atala was published separately in April 1801 as a trial, and caused a sensation. It also contained René, another story ‘designed to illustrate the vagueness of the passions’ which made the mal du siècle, or mal du René the most fashionable ailment of the time and set the pattern for Romantic heroes and heroines for half a century. Chateaubriand dedicated the second edition to Napoleon. It satisfied a public need for colour and passion in literature, and supported Napoleon’s need for a Concordat with the Church.\n\nBkI:Chap1:Sec1 Chateaubriand mentions it, as a proof of his fame comparable to that of Voltaire.\n\nBkII:Chap6:Sec3 Mentioned. See the work itself I.1.7\n\nBkIV:Chap2:Sec2 Mentioned. See the preface to the work.\n\nBkIV:Chap5:Sec1 BkVI:Chap1:Sec1 BkXII:Chap1:Sec1 Mentioned.\n\nBkVI:Chap6:Sec1 Chateaubriand refers to Part 1, Book V, Chapter 12.

It went on sale in April 1802.\n\nBkXIII:Chap10:Sec2 René, an episode within the overall work.\n\nBkXIII:Chap11:Sec1 BkXIII:Chap11:Sec2 The impact of the work.\n\nBkXIV:Chap4:Sec1 Its effect on Napoleon.\n\nBkXIV:Chap7:Sec1 BkXX:Chap9:Sec3 Chateaubriand sent the Pope a copy of the work in 1803.\n\nBkXVI:Chap1:Sec1 It acted as a door-opener to Chateaubriand’s political career.\n\nBkXVII:Chap1:Sec1 An inspiration for further work.\n\nBkXVIII:Chap6:Sec1 It gained Chateaubriand spurious admiration.\n\nBkXVIII:Chap8:Sec2 Proposed for the Decennial Prize in 1810 but rejected.\n\nBkXVIII:Chap9:Sec1 Extracts from Les Natchez used for descriptive passages.\n\nBkXXVI:Chap4:Sec1 Read by Frederick-William III.\n\nBkXXVII:Chap5:Sec1 Mrs Siddons quotes from it in 1822.\n\nBkXXIX:Chap1:Sec2 Madame Récamier reads it in 1802.\n\nBkXXXIII:Chap10:Sec1 Its significance in Chateaubriand’s literary career.\n\nBkXXXV:Chap26:Sec1 Mentioned.\n\nBkXXXVI:Chap1:Sec1 See the work where Chateaubriand describes the rural Rogations.\n\nBkXXXVII:Chap5:Sec1 See Part I:III:2 and the chapter Snakes in Voyage to America.\n\nBkXXXVII:Chap7:Sec1 BkXXXVIII:Chap8:Sec1 BkXL:Chap3:Sec1\n\nMentioned.\n\nBkXXXIX:Chap5:Sec1 Translated into Italian by Armani (Venice 1805).\n\nBkXLI:Chap1:Sec1 BkXLI:Chap4:Sec1 BkXLII:Chap17:Sec1 Mentioned.\n\nGenlis, Stéphanie Félicité Ducrest de St-Albin, Comtesse de\n\n1746-1830. A French writer and educator, she wrote four volumes of plays for children and close to a hundred volumes of historical and other romances of which Mademoiselle de Clermont (1802) is the best-known.\n\nBkXXVIII:Chap10:Sec1 Mentioned.\n\nBkXXVIII:Chap19:Sec1 Her novel Athénaïs, ou le Château de Coppet en 1807, published 1832, in which she idealised Madame Récamier. Chateaubriand visits her.\n\nBkXXIX:Chap5:Sec1 Madame de Celles was her grand-daughter.\n\nGenoa, Italy\n\nA city of northwest Italy on the Gulf of Genoa, an arm of the Ligurian Sea it was an ancient settlement, Genoa flourished under the Romans and also enjoyed great prosperity during the Crusades.\n\nBkXIX:Chap9:Sec2 Napoleon ordered there in the summer of 1794 to report on the fortifications.\n\nBkXIX:Chap12:Sec2 The revolution there in May 1797.\n\nBkXX:Chap2:Sec1 BkXXVIII:Chap18:Sec1 Surrendered by Masséna under orders on 2nd June 1800.\n\nBkXX:Chap9:Sec2 Sampierdarena (San Pier d’Arena) is a town in Liguria in the province of Genoa, 21 miles west of that city.

The son of a military surgeon, he was born at Bordeaux. He studied law, and at the outbreak of the French Revolution, he was an advocate of the parlement of Bordeaux. In 1790 he became procureur of the Commune, and in July 1791 was elected by the newly created department of the Gironde a member of the court of appeal. In the same year he was elected deputy for the department to the Legislative Assembly. As reporter of the diplomatic committee, in which he supported the policy of Brissot, he proposed two of the most revolutionary measures passed by the Assembly: the decree of accusation against the king’s brothers (January 1, 1792), and the declaration of war against the king of Bohemia and Hungary (April 20, 1792). He was vigorous in his denunciations of the intrigues of the court and of the ‘Austrian committee’; but the violence of the extreme democrats, culminating in the events of August 10, alarmed him; and when he was returned to the National Convention, he attacked the Commune of Paris (October 24 and 25). At the trial of Louis XVI he supported an appeal to the people, but voted for the death sentence. As a member of the Committee of General Defence, and as president of the Convention (March 7-21, 1793), he shared in the bitter attacks of the Girondists on the Mountain; and on the fatal day of June 2 his name was among the first of those inscribed on the prosecution list. He was tried by the Revolutionary Tribunal on October 24 1793, condemned to death and guillotined, displaying great courage.\n\nBkIX:Chap3:Sec1 Mentioned.\n\nGentz, Friedrich von\n\n1764-1832.

A French hostess, her salon in the Hôtel de Rambouillet was an international meeting place of artists and men of letters from 1749 to 1777. The daughter of a valet, she married a rich manufacturer. Although lacking formal education herself, Madame Geoffrin was sensitive, an excellent listener, and naturally intelligent; she inherited the salon of the more unconventional Madame de Tencin, gave it an added tone of respectability, and became a generous, motherly patron to her guests and protégés. Her salon was also a centre for the Encyclopédistes, whose vast project she subsidized.\n\nBkXIII:Chap7:Sec2 Madame de Vintimille might have lived in her company.\n\nGeoffroy, Julien Louis\n\n1743-1814. Literary critic, born at Rennes. On the death of Élie Fréron in 1776 the other collaborators in the Année littéraire asked Geoffroy to succeed him, and he conducted the journal until its closure in 1792. He was a bitter critic of Voltaire and his followers. An enthusiastic royalist, he published, with Fréron's brother-in-law, the abbé Thomas Royou (1741-1792), a journal, L'Ami du roi (1790-1792), which possibly did more harm than good to the king's cause by its ill-advised partisanship. During the Reign of Terror, Geoffroy hid in the neighbourhood of Paris, only returning in 1799.\n\nBkII:Chap7:Sec1 Mentioned as educated at Rennes College.\n\nGeorge III, King of England\n\n1738-1820.

King of England 1820-1830. Eldest son and successor of George III, in 1785 he married Maria Anne Fitzherbert, a Roman Catholic. The marriage was illegal, however; and in 1795, to secure parliamentary settlement of his enormous debts, he made a political marriage with Caroline of Brunswick. In constant and open opposition to his father, George associated closely with the Whigs, particularly Charles James Fox, whose friend he became in 1781. In 1811, after George III had become permanently incapacitated, George became Regent. The Tories, under the leadership of the Earl of Liverpool for most of the period, remained entrenched in power throughout the Regency and George’s subsequent reign. As Regent and as King, George was hated for his extravagance and dissolute habits, and he aroused particular hostility by an unsuccessful attempt, immediately after his accession (1820) to the throne, to divorce his long-estranged wife, Caroline. During his reign the monarchy lost a significant amount of power.\n\nBkVI:Chap1:Sec1 BkX:Chap11:Sec1 Chateaubriand was ambassador to his Court in 1822.\n\nBkX:Chap7:Sec1 His brother was Frederick, Duke of York.\n\nBkXVII:Chap2:Sec1 The Marchioness of Conyngham, one of his mistresses.\n\nBkXXII:Chap7:Sec1 His reputed agents in France.\n\nBkXXIV:Chap3:Sec1 Napoleon writes to him in July 1815.\n\nBkXXVI:Chap6:Sec1 The brother-in-law of the Duchess of Cumberland, he was crowned on the 19th of July 1821.

The picaresque adventures of its hero are described from naive youth through cunning servant to landed proprietor and nobleman, with a spell in jail, bereavements and fits of remorse along the way. It was an immense hit on publication, and was translated into most European languages. The version by Tobias Smollet was the first in English and one of the best, although rather free in parts. Its influence on Smollett’s own work is clear (Roderick Random, Peregrine Pickle); Fielding (Tom Jones) and Dickens (Nicholas Nickleby) were also heavily influenced by it or its numerous imitators.\n\nBkX:Chap5:Sec1 BkX:Chap7:Sec1 Peltier compared to the hero of the work.\n\nBkXVIII:Chap3Sec1 A reference to a celebrated episode in the work, Book VII, Chapter 4, where the quality of the prelate’s sermons is questioned.\n\nGilles de Bretagne\n\nBrother of the Duke of Brittany, François I.

English author and political philosopher. A minister in his youth, he was, however, plagued by religious doubts and gave up preaching in 1783 for a literary career. His Enquiry Concerning Political Justice (1793) recorded the view that men are ultimately guided by reason and therefore, being rational creatures, could live in harmony without laws and institutions. His views are also reflected in his novels - Things as they are, or the Adventures of Caleb Williams (1794), St. Leon (1799), and Fleetwood (1805). In 1797, Godwin married Mary Wollstonecraft, who died the same year after giving birth to a daughter, Mary. He remarried in 1801 and in 1805 established a small, juvenile publishing business. His last years were an unceasing struggle against poverty and debt. Godwin’s works strongly influenced his younger contemporaries, particularly Shelley, whose elopement with Mary (1814) drew from Godwin an exhibition of sternness at variance with his earlier views.

Gregory remained neutral in the civil war that followed in Germany but decreed (1079) Henry deposed when it became clear Henry would not cooperate with the forces working for peace in the empire. Henry answered by setting up an imperial antipope, Guibert of Ravenna (Clement III). When the civil war ended in Henry's favour, he marched (1081) into Italy. Gregory led the defence of Rome, but when Henry returned a second time (1083) the Romans betrayed Gregory. He fortified himself in Castel Sant’Angelo until rescued by his Norman ally, Robert Guiscard. The Normans plundered the city.

His acquaintance with Rousseau, through a mutual sympathy in regard to musical matters, ripened into intimate friendship, and led to a close association with the encyclopaedists. A witty pamphlet entitled Le Petit Prophète de Boeh-mischbroda (1753), written by him in defence of Italian as against French opera, established his literary reputation. In 1753 Grimm, following the example of the Abbé Raynal, began a literary correspondence with various German sovereigns. Raynal’s letters, Nouvelles littéraires, ceased early in 1755. With the aid of friends, especially of Diderot and Mme d’Épinay, during his temporary absences from France, Grimm himself carried on the correspondence, which consisted of two letters a month, until 1773, and eventually counted among his subscribers Catherine II of Russia, Stanislas Poniatowski, king of Poland, and many princes of the smaller German States. It was probably in 1754 that Grimm was introduced by Rousseau to Madame d’Epinay, with whom he soon formed a liaison which led to an irreconcilable rupture between him and Rousseau. Rousseau was induced by his resentment to give in his Confessions a wholly mendacious portrait of Grimm's character. He became minister of Saxe-Gotha at the court of France in 1776, but in 1777 he left Paris on a visit to St Petersburg, where he remained for nearly a year in daily intercourse with Catherine.

A French general during the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic wars, he was made a marshal after Napoleon’s return from Elba during the Hundred Days.

French statesman and historian, he became a professor of modern history at the University of Paris. His friendship with Royer-Collard and his sympathy with the moderate royalists soon drew him into minor political office. As an opposition deputy he was involved in the July Revolution of 1830 and became one of the leading intellectual exponents of the bourgeois July Monarchy of Louis Philippe. As minister of public instruction (1832–37), Guizot introduced (1833) a new system of primary education. Turning more and more to conservatism, he became (1840) the chief power in the ministry nominally headed by Soult, who had displaced the more liberal Thiers as premier. In 1847, Guizot became premier. His leadership provided a stable government, but his complacent acceptance of the established order led to his overthrow in the February Revolution of 1848, which forced the abdication of Louis Philippe. Guizot devoted the rest of his life to writing.

The relations between the two men were initially warm but later hostile as Chateaubriand considered Guizot a supporter of Press censorship and a political opponent in many respects, though he appreciated his literary work.\n\nBkXXXI:Chap7:Sec1 He co-wrote the address for the opening of the Session of 1830 on the 2nd of March.\n\nBkXXXII:Chap4:Sec1 Held a meeting of the monarchist party on 28th July 1830 at his house.\n\nBkXXXII:Chap8:Sec1 Appointed as a Commissioner on the 30th July 1830 to confer with the Peers.\n\nBkXXXII:Chap14:Sec1 Drafts a proclamation on Saturday the 31st of July 1830.\n\nBkXXXV:Chap6:Sec1 Mentioned.\n\nGumbinnen (Gusev)\n\nFormerly in Germany, in the Prussian province of East Prussia, it is on the Pissa, an affluent of the Pregel.

King of Sweden from 1792 until his abdication in 1809, he was the son of Gustav III of Sweden and his queen consort Sophie Magdalen. His despotism, his mental unbalance, and his disastrous policies led to his forced abdication when the Russians threatened Stockholm (March 1809).

He spent most of his exile as ‘Colonel Gustafsson’ at St. Gall, Switzerland, where he died.\n\nBkXVI:Chap2:Sec1 Protested at the abduction of the Duc d’Enghien, and recalled his ambassador to Paris in 1804, finally refusing to recognise Napoleon as Emperor.\n\nBkXX:Chap11:Sec1 His loss of possessions to France and Russia.\n\nGustavus Adolphus of Sweden\n\n1594-1632.

He was King of Sweden from 1611 until his death, and the only Swedish king to be styled ‘the Great’. Born in Stockholm, the son of Charles IX of the Vasa dynasty and Christina of Holstein-Gottorp, he was one of the major players in the Thirty Years’ War. He was married to Maria Eleonora, the daughter of the Elector of Brandenburg, and chose Prussia’s city of Elbing as base for his operations in Germany.
