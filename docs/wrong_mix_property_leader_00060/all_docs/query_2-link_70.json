        "text": "uasimir ? irener springs I rum a goou\n\nmiddle-olass stock. Hia ancestors made a\n\ncompetency at) Menz, a Binall town in Dan*\n\nphine. His grandfather, the first Casmier,\n\nwas born at Grenoble, and with his brothers\n\nPaul, Scipio, r.nd Augustine, established\n\na Bank in Paris in 1802. Augustine\n\nPeriore waa a Deputy under ' the Res\n\ntoration, and in 1S32 was made a life Peer.\n\nAnother brother, Camille, was Auditor of the\n\nCouncil of State in 1818, and also a Deputy\n\nfrom 1828 to 1837, and was then made a\n\nlife Peer. Caaiaiir was Prime Minister in\n\n1831, and waa the only Premier who kept\n\nLouis rhillippe faithful to the maxim of the\n\nRevolution of 1830—' Tho King reigns, but\n\ndoes not govern.' He died iu IH'62 oi cholera,\n\nwhilo visiting tho victims ot the epidsmia\n\nHie son Cneimir tho Bccond, who incorporated\n\nhis Christian name with the eurn-tino, was at\n\ntirsc a diplomatist, and was a Duputy from\n\n18-ltJ to ISol, w:u excluded from publio hie\n\nunder tho Empire, was Minister oi the Interior\n\nunder M. Thiers in 1871amll S72, was elected a\n\nlife Senator in 1875, and ditd in 1S76. ilia\n\nbrother, M, Charles Perier, a shipowner at\n\nHavre, was a Deputy from 187U to 1881, and\n\nsince 1881 has been a Senator. C'asimir, the\n\nthird new President, waa born in 1847, dis\n\ntinguished himtjeif in tha siege of PariB, and\n\nhaa been a Deputy since 1874. In ISSo he was\n\nperplexed as so voting for the exile of a\n\ndynaaiy under which his father and gftind\n\nfathor br.d served — ao exile which, however,\n\nhe considered a necessary eafeguard for the\n\nIlepublic. He accordingly resigned his seat,\n\nbut after some hesitation accepted re-election.\n\nti.3 was Chairman of tho Jiuugut Committee\n\nin 1890, and in January, 181)3, h9 was eleoted\n\nPresident of the Chamber of Deputies. This\n\nposition he tilled with dignity and impar\n\ntiality. That ho had no idea of sinking into a\n\nmere cipher in politics is, however, evidencod\n\nby his public utterances. Ono of tho mo3t im\n\nportant of these was delivered at Troyes in\n\nApril, 1S93, which was iasciaot with states\n\nman-like foresight. Some portions of it are\n\nworth quoting. Speaking of the Monarchical\n\nparties, he said : — ' It depends upon us to\n\nrally these soldiers now put to liighs. Past\n\nmemories, prejudices, or fears still hold them\n\nbaok, and yet, enlightened by their good sense\n\nand patriotism, they feel that the ground\n\nwhich they have been defending ia slipping\n\nfrom under their feet, that tho traditions they\n\ninvoke are like mummies, whiuh fall to pieces\n\nif touched by tha hand. Those laggardB must\n\nbo given time to catch up with tho .Republican\n\narmy, that our ranks may be oponed to them,\n\nand that they may be disciplined. Every\n\nthing is to bo oxpscsed from their upright and\n\nclear intentions. We summon them to us,\n\nthese fine fellows, who look back regretfully to\n\na throne, and who have given up tho thought\n\nof finding 11 King ; but tho .Republican army\n\naccepts and receives only those who are en\n\nrolled as soldiers. It entrusts neither the pro\n\ntection of the citadel nor the honour of the\n\nflag to its foes of yesterday.' Speaking cf\n\nthis changing time, this period of flux uud re\n\nflux throughout the world, aa men strive more\n\nand more for the amelioration of their fellows,\n\nhe grappled with that form of the eouiul\n\nproblem peculiar to France : — 'We are neither\n\nin 1789,' said ho, 'nor in 1830, nor in 1848.\n\nThe question is no iougur one of (struggling\n\nagainst the omnipotence of a master or of\n\ndismantling the fortrc-as&s of do3potiam. It is\n\na question of to-dny, of carrying out tha Par\n\nliamentary regime and of protecting it against\n\nits own excuses. It is a question of giving\n\nauthority its due now thac no one haggles\n\novor what m duu to liberty. Is is a question\n\nfor the executi -^ power of uaing its -right™ and\n\nassuming tlio necessary lusuonaibilities of\n\nknitting together all the moral forces and\n\nusing them, not for tha satisfaction of party\n\npassion, but the strhndeur and prosperity of\n\ntho Fatherland. It is a question of pamiading\n\nall pub:/'; functionaries, whatever their rank or\n\nduties, that they are the servants only of tho\n\nnation.'\n\nilarly in December laat M. Casimir-Perior\n\nformed a Ministry, in which he was Minister\n\nfor Foreign Affaira. This Ministry lasted until\n\nthe middle of last month, when M. Dupuy\n\nresumed the Premiership and M. Casimir\n\nPerier resumed his position as President. On\n\nhia election aa President of the Chamber of\n\nDeputies M. Cosimir-Perier delivered a very\n\ndignitied address, in which he sot forth the\n\nduties of bia oftico with great cloarnees, insist\n\ning upon the necessity for impartiality, for\n\nbearance as well as firmness. Ho also pointed\n\nout the great privilege of party discussion,\n\nand stated his intention to defend that bul\n\nwark of tho Constitution. He also stated that\n\nthe maintenance of order was the first duty of\n\nGovernment and a primary condition of pro\n\ngress. His declaration as Premier, among\n\nother things, stated that in readjusting\n\nthe burdens of taxation Ministers desired\n\nbo to remodel the direct taxes aa to\n\nreaoh acquired wealth. They would pro\n\npose to revise the 6urvby and valuation of\n\nland, to increase tho legacy duties, to make\n\n&oine alterations in the liquor laws, and to\n\ncreate a retiring pension fund for working\n\nmen. Tho commercial policy would be uphold,\n\nand any propoaal for che- revision of the Con\n\nstitution would be opposed. They would com\n\nbat Socialist doctrines, not with disdain, but\n\nby the generous and fruitful action at the dis\n\nposal of the State. Their foreign policy would\n\nbe inspired by a consciousness that the nation\n\nwas powerful enough to proclaim its desire for\n\npeace, and to defend its rights and the interests\n\nof its trade and industry in all parts of the world.\n\nIn connection with tho crisis in which tho\n\nCaaimir-Perier Ministry fell, tho then Premier\n\nbrought before tho French Chamber of Depu\n\nties the question of whether the State work\n\nmen should be allowed to attend a Trades\n\nUnion Congress, but hh motion thereon waa\n\ndefeated by a majority of fifty. The crisis\n\nfollowed. The primary cause of tho trouble\n\nwas said to be the refusal of M. Jonnort,\n\nMinister of Public Works, to allow the\n\nemployes of the State railways to combine.\n\nThe late Presidents of the Republic, whose\n\nterm of office expired in December, was sus\n\npected in some quarters of having provoked\n\nthia quarrel for the purpose of discrediting M.\n\nCasimir-Perier's candidature for tho Presi\n\ndency at the election.\n\nThe new President, who is in tbo prime of\n\nlife, is a tall and handsome man with a high\n\nbold square forehead and a frank and sympa\n\nthetic, as well as thoughtful aud dignified ex\n\npression. He wears a moustache, and haa the\n\nappearance of a comparatively young man."
