Fortin, A.A.\n\nVIII\n\nAnnotated Bibliography\n\nHistory of Assumptionist publications\n\nAn article by Father Le Dortz in Assomption 1967, no. 7, pp. 45-47, was the first attempt to draw up as complete a bibliography as possible of the internal publications of the Assumptionist Congregation. The desire to make an inventory and to put to good use all of the richness of the Congregation’s history is not new. At different times, efforts have been made to systematize the written sources of this history, but for a variety of reasons, e.g., to keep alive the memory of the past, to exalt or recapture the spirit of Assumption, to recall the meaning of certain events or commemorate anniversaries, to establish ties among the isolated or dispersed communities, to present the Congregation to others, etc. The fervor of certain celebrations, centennials, anniversaries, and foundations or re-foundations sharpens or renews a sense of history and requires a review of what took place as well as an updated appreciation of the key Assumptionists involved. Listed below, in chronological order, are the most important documents available. For practical purposes, they are also listed geographically, proceeding from the general level to the local level.\n\nMonographs on the Assumptionists\n\n- -Quénard, A.

Lamoureux: series in the making.\n\nDirectories of Religious (Répartitions des Religieux)\n\nThe principle is simple, but the history is complex. The “genre” began with Father Picard. The list of the addresses of the houses and names of the religious, at least of the superiors, was included in one of the annual issues of the periodical called Souvenirs. But with the dispersion in 1901, discretion and even fear of all possible types of written indiscretion prevailed, which created a hiatus of more than 20 years (1900-1922). Starting in 1922, thought was given to publishing an annual edition entitled Répartition des Missionnaires, which remained coded or doctored until 1930. It then became the “classical” Répartition des Religieux/Directory of Religious, based at first on the school year (e.g., 1954-1955), then on the civil calendar as of January 1st (e.g., 1970). However, it was not published in 1969. In the year 2000, the publication became quadrilingual. Since 1970, an alphabetical listing of the religious is found at the end.\n\nNecrologies\n\nWhen did the annual Necrology first appear? Here too, the genre began with a page in the internal bulletins (e.g., Les Souvenirs) of the Congregation. Significant importance was clearly given to the deceased in these various bulletins, to the point of encumbering them. Beginning in the 1980s, the necrologies began appearing as fascicles and offprints of Documents Assomption. Until 1991, they were printed on tissue paper by Bayard Presse/Bonne Presse and drawn up by Father Laurien (Joseph) Richard.\n\nIn the past, the Ordo of the Congregation was printed separately, but today it is appended to the necrology.\n\nIn fact, even though all these documents are scattered here and there, they are invaluable for the history of the Congregation. They testify to a desire to remember, communicate, and organize the Institute little by little. These annual documents truly deserve to be preserved and bound.\n\nNews bulletins for both internal and external purposes\n\n1. L’Assomption de Nîmes, no. 1 (January 1, 1875) to no. 48 (December 15, 1879), a bimonthly. It includes news especially about the College in Nîmes, but also about the work of Our Lady of Vocations and the Congregation. Because of the events that took place in 1880, there is no news about that year, which makes for a first gap in our information. This periodical includes 3 precious alphabetical tables: no. 24 (1875), pp. 213-216; no. 27 (1876-1877), pp. 389-396; no. 47 (1878-1879), pp. 382-388.\n\n2. L ‘Assomption et ses OEuvres. This periodical began in 1897 and continues to this day on a quarterly basis. It presents the apostolate of the Assumptionists and of the Assumption Family to the larger public of friends of the Congregation. Its history has been written, cf. L’Assomption et ses CEuvres, 1999, no. 678, pp. 28-29. The history of this publication, now almost 100 years old, deserves a few additional comments:\n\n- It was first called “L’Assomption, ceuvre de Notre Dame des Vocations, Échos du noviciat des Augustins de L’Assomption” and appeared monthly: no. 1 (January 1, 1897) to no. 59 (November 1, 1901). It contained edifying topics, hagiography, and news about the novitiate in Livry.\n\n- It then became “L‘Assomption, Échos du noviciat éxilé” and appeared monthly: no. 60 (December 1, 1901) to no. 211 (August 1, 1914). The exile was itinerant, as the novitiate moved from Gemert, to Louvain, to Gempe, and to Limpertsberg.\n\n- Its first interruption came as a result of the war of 1914-1918. It resumed as a quarterly carrying the same title but also the mention “wartime edition”: no. 212 (January-June 1918) to no. 216 (April-June 1919). Then came the move to Notre-Dame de Lumières and to Saint Gerard.\n\n- It returned to its former format as a monthly without undergoing any changes: no. 217 (July 1919) to no. 233 (December 1920).\n\n- Times had changed. The term “in exile” was suppressed: no. 234 (January 1921) to no. 281 (December 1924).\n\n- Starting with no. 282 (January 1925), the monthly inaugurated a “new series” whose title became “L’Assomption et ses oeuvres” until no. 466 (May 1940). It was no longer concerned only with the novitiates but also with the scholasticates and with the apostolic activities of the Assumptionist communities near and far. However, it remained an in-house publication.\n\n- Once again, war disturbed the life of the publication. From 1941 to 1947, 22 issues were published giving Bits of News to the Friends of Assumption. With no. 469 (January-February 1948), it became a bimonthly (every two months), with additional and diversified types of information, until no. 542 (May-July 1965).\n\n- It was with issue no. 543 (autumn 1965) that the periodical became a quarterly, enlarged its format, came out in color, and opened itself more broadly to the life of all of the Assumption families. At the outset, there were several editions (according to the houses, the development offices (procures) and the provinces), then progressively, everything was brought together. Among the periodical’s recent directors and editors were Fathers Le Toumellec, Proust, and Michel Charles, and an editorial staff working with Brother Robert Migliorini.\n\nThe Congregation had its national equivalents, particularly English: The Assumptionist (London) from 1946 to 1967 (?) and Our Lady of the Assumption Parish Magazine (1924-1952); also Dutch: Assumptie (Boxtel) 1924-1964 (?).\n\nCf. the historical study of the periodical made by Jean-Paul Périer-Muzet, “Les ages d’un centenaire,” L’Assomption et ses Oeuvres, 1999, no. 678, pp. 28-29.\n\n3. Les Souvenirs (1st series: no. 1 (February 28, 1881 to December 1899), a total of 416 issues. They were written by Fathers Germer-Durand, Vincent de Paul Bailly, Paul-François Doumet, and Claude Allez. Because of the events that took place in 1900, that year is not covered, hence a second gap in our information. Between 1881 and 1891, the frequency of the publication was uneven, but between November 1891 and December 1899, it appeared almost weekly.\n\n4. Aux frères de la dispersion en Orient (1st series: July 2, 1900 to May 15, 1902): 44 issues. Its purpose was to serve as a link with those who were furthest away. The editor was Father Vincent de Paul Bailly. There is a gap between nos. 43 and 44 due to police censorship.\n\n5. Les Souvenirs (2nd series: from July 15, 1902 to October 18, 1906): 45 issues. Father Armand-Gabriel de Combes produced the publication in Rome. A 3rd gap occurred between 1906 and 1908.\n\n6. Lettre à la dispersion (2nd series: September 24, 1908 to November 20, 1912, to which must be added 6 supplementary issues dedicated to Father Vincent de Paul Bailly who died on December 2, 1912). A fourth gap occurred at the end of 1912 until the beginning of 1914.\n\n7. Les Souvenirs (3rd series: 8 issues from February 28, 1914 to July 18, 1914). Compiled and edited by Father Germer-Durand.\n\n8. Lettre à la dispersion (3rd series: 550 issues from 1914 to 1918). Editor: Father Ernest Baudouy. It carried a subtitle “L’Assomption aux armées’’ and was censored in June 1916. The censored edition became Nouvelles de la famille, while the other non-censored edition continued as La Lettre à la dispersion.\n\n9. The first series of Pages d’Archives appeared as a supplement to La Lettre à la dispersion (1 vol. of 240 pages).\n\n10. The two formulas continued to be used after the war: Les Nouvelles de la famille, from July 1916 to December 15, 1921 (425 issues), and Lettre à la dispersion (4th series), from January 1, 1922 to May 31, 1941 (840 issues, almost all of them published by Father Ernest Baudouy).\n\n11. Nouvelles de la famille occupée: Father Gervais Quénard personally published in the form of letters 37 issues of this newsletter which kept contact with the religious between 1942 and 1944.\n\n12. La Lettre à la famille: edited successively by Fathers A. Cleux, R. Kokel, E. Jubert, and A. Picot. It was published from January 15, 1945 to December 1964 (382 issues). It had 9 supplements in 1945.\n\n13. Assomption 1965/66/67: new formula, new format, only 10 issues. A remarkable periodical produced by the AA students in Rome under the direction of Father Touveneraud. It did not survive the upheaval of 1968.\n\n14. Pages d’Archives is in a category of its own. The first series was intended as a Supplement to the Lettre à la Dispersion: 240 pages (1926-1935). The second series (nos. 1-13) covered the period from 1954 to 1963. The third series (nos. 1-7) contained serious studies which presented biographical sketches of individual Assumptionists, and focused on questions of the apostolate or the missions. The fourth series was simply a monograph on Father Pernet, yesterday and today (April 1966). There were also special issues featuring a single topic, e.g., in 1921 the alumnates, and in 1929 the life of Father Jaujou.\n\n15. Since 1989, the Assumption families together created a periodical called Itinéraires Augustiniens in order to deepen their Augustinian heritage. It succeeded Alype (1978-1981), a periodical created by the Orants.\n\nOther internal publications\n\n- Bulletin Officiel de L’Assomption, B.O.A. (1946-1975).\n\n- -Documents Assomption (1976), an annual publication that provides all of the official acts of the Congregation. Special editions of necrologies contain biographical sketches of deceased religious throughout the entire Institute (8 issues, 1980-1999).\n\n- Quarterly Bulletin from Rome: ART informations was published from 1969 to December 1989. It became AA Info in 1990, then AA Informations, Informatie, Noticias, and News as of October 1999. It is published in 4 languages. (See Index General A-Z: 1969-1999 of Périer-Muzet, A.A., Jean-Paul, Roma, 2001,98 pages).\n\nMissionary publications\n\n- -In French: Missions des Augustins de l’Assomption (Paris, Lyons), originally focused on the Near Eastern Mission, begun in 1886, appeared irregularly, then monthly, and finally quarterly. It featured various Assumptionist apostolates. From 1963 to 1965, it was known as Missions Assomptionnistes.\n\n- In German: Missionen der Augustiner von Marie-Himmelfahrt (Scheidegg).\n\n- From French-speaking and Flemish Belgium, for the Congo Mission, 2 periodicals: L’Afrique Ardente (1932-1962) and Ontwakend Afrika (1947-1962), which respectively became: Qu’il Règne and Groeiende Kerk (1963-).\n\n- In Chile: El Eco de Lourdes (Santiago, starting in 1901) and Pages Chiliennes (1910-1914).\n\n- In Argentina: Auras de Lourdes (Santos Lugares, since 1913).\n\nThere is also a wealth of information about the Assumptionist missions in the various newsletters of the provinces on which they depend [ed].\n\nProvincial newsletters\n\nLittle by little, as the Congregation became international and organized itself into provinces, the need was felt for newsletters that were close to the Provinces and intended for them:\n\n- Province of Bordeaux: A Travers la Province (Bordeaux), starting in March 1950.

By country? By language? By types of activity? By period?\n\nWhat written sources do you have available locally, either in the community’s library, in the stock held by your province, vice-province or region, that will help you learn about the history of the Congregation in your country and in your own language?\n\nThe Assumptionists have defined themselves as a doctrinal\n\ncongregation. Can you point out the titles of periodicals geared to\n\nscientific and religious research, in years past and today?\n\nThe Congregation, from its very beginning, has heavily involved itself with the press, the media, and the means of social communication. Can you find traces of this tradition in various countries? Give concrete examples to illustrate the point?\n\nDo you know the names of several Assumptionists who, today, have become well-known authors in various fields? Give some contemporary examples with the titles of their works.\n\nSome fields of apostolic endeavor hardly leave any written traces, parishes, for example. Would that not be a possible explanation for the relative silence that surrounds them?\n\nEducation in all its forms, according to the expression used by Father d’Alzon and the First Constitutions, was often pursued by the Congregation in the context of teaching in schools. Can you name a dozen or so educational institutions that are directed today by the Assumptionists or under their sponsorship?\n\nDo you know of any other contemporary religious congregation engaged in the field of publications? Does the Congregation not stand out as unique in this field? Why?\n\nBy what concrete means can the faith be transmitted in today’s world?"
