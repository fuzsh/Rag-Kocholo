Have you ever had a childhood hobby that got out of hand?

That explains Lynn Trefzger’s start as a ventriloquist/comedienne. For more than 30 years, Lynn has given life to a trunk full of comical characters. She has performed for audiences worldwide in corporations, colleges, theaters and cruise ships. This week, she brings her show to Friday Nights Live at The Lincoln, with the curtain set to go up at 7:30 p.m. Friday.

Audiences are treated to Lynn’s vocal illusion talents, when they may meet a drunken and lovable camel, a grumpy old man, a feisty little girl and may even see some other audience members who are brought up for the action.

Lynn (and her many voices) has appeared on ABC, TNN, A&E and Lifetime. She is featured in a recently released comedy/documentary about the art of ventriloquism with Jay Johnson and Jeff Dunham called “I'm No Dummy” by NBC Universal.

This weekend’s movie — “The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas” — is just as much fun. This film from 1982 features Dolly Parton, Burt Reynolds, Charles Durning, Jim Nabors, Dom DeLuise and television news icon Howard K. Smith. The story goes like this: The Chicken Ranch, founded in 1910, had a long history of serving the needs of Texans, but when a TV preacher targets it as the devil’s playhouse, the town sheriff and regular patron fights to keep it open. This film won an Oscar for Charles Durning as Best Supporting Actor and was nominated for several Golden Globes including Best Picture.

This week we are all about fun. Friday’s show is perfect for the entire family. Our film Saturday and Sunday is rated R.
