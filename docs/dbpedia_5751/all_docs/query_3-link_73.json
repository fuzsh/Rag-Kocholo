        "text": "Event Underscores New York State's Commitment to Promote Diversity and Inclusion in the Entertainment Industry\n\nEmpire State Development (ESD), in partnership with Comcast NBCUniversal, today hosted the “ShowBizNY: Diverse Supplier Connections” Summit, at the Museum of the Moving Image in Queens. The summit, attended by more than 200 small businesses both in-person and online, connected businesses to industry professionals, relaunched the New York State Film and TV Diverse Suppliers Directory which is an online resource that helps productions identify and connect with diverse vendors, as well as MWBE certification, and provided key information for businesses to take advantage of New York’s robust film and television industry. Today's summit is part of a larger statewide initiative to increase diversity and inclusion and create equal opportunities in the film and television industry.\n\nEmpire State Development President, CEO and Commissioner Hope Knight said, “ESD is proud to support the diverse supplier summit and provide opportunities through inclusionary programming that helps underrepresented communities navigate the growing film and television industry. Under Governor Hochul’s leadership, New York State continues to promote opportunity and equitable economic growth for all.”\n\n“Comcast NBCUniversal is deeply committed to advancing the economic inclusion of underrepresented businesses. Working with diverse companies helps generate jobs, distribute wealth, and create more opportunity within our communities,” said Dalila Wilson-Scott, Executive Vice President and Chief Diversity Officer for Comcast Corporation. “We’re proud to partner with Empire State Development to help New York business owners learn how to work with TV and film productions and understand the importance of MWBE certification to both our company and the state.”\n\nAs of January 1, 2023, film and television production companies participating in the NYS Film Production Tax Credit Program are required to submit diversity plans with goals for hiring a diverse workforce, including the hiring of diverse vendors. The Film and TV Diverse Suppliers Directory serves as a potential resource for film and television professionals to help identify and connect with these vendors as they put together their production vendor teams.\n\nFilm and television productions employ thousands of New Yorkers and contract with hundreds of small businesses and support services throughout the state, including many businesses that had never before considered their work relevant to film production. These services are vital to the industry and include a wide range of small businesses such as caterers, landscapers, tent companies, tool suppliers, security and many others. These businesses are essential and keep the cameras rolling in New York State.\n\nNew York State is home to the first-in-the-nation New York Entertainment Workforce Diversity Grant Program. The program provides financial assistance in the form of grants for job creation and training programs that support efforts to recruit, hire, promote, retain, develop and train a diverse and inclusive workforce for the motion picture and television production and post-production industries in New York State.\n\nAbout the Governor’s Office of Motion Picture & Television Development\n\nThe New York State Governor’s Office of Motion Picture & Television Development, a division of Empire State Development, aims to grow and support the film, television and commercial industry by guiding filmmakers through the many programs and assets New York State has to offer, promoting and publicizing the state’s infrastructure, talent and film production, post-production, and commercial tax incentives for qualified expenditures in New York State. The office also serves as a liaison between production companies and city and local governments, state agencies, a network of statewide contacts, local film offices and professional location scouts and managers. More information on filming in New York State or the Film Production and Post Production Tax Credit Programs can be found here.\n\nAbout Empire State Development\n\nEmpire State Development (ESD) is New York’s chief economic development agency.
