Even in all of the action, employees have exclusive access to rooftop gardens, relaxation spaces and perks and discounts to local retailers and world class restaurants. Not to mention a front row seat to iconic events like the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade and the Rockefeller Christmas Tree Lighting.\n\nRockefeller Center is the location of many of our legendary shows such as \"Saturday Night Live,\" \"The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon,\" \"TODAY\" and \"Nightly News.\" At the heart of New York City, 30 Rock is our corporate headquarters. Even in all of the action, employees have exclusive access to rooftop gardens, relaxation spaces and perks and discounts to local retailers and world class restaurants. Not to mention a front row seat to iconic events like the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade and the Rockefeller Christmas Tree Lighting.\n\nOur London offices are home to over 1,500 employees. Our corporate hub Central Saint Giles is incredibly well located close to Soho, Covent Garden and Oxford Street. Nearby are the NBC News (Holborn) and CNBC offices and news studio (City of London) as well as the offices of our Carnival Production team (famous for Downton Abbey, among many hit TV shows) and the Universal Parks and Resorts teams in Covent Garden. Also in Central London, in elegant Marylebone, are the Working Title offices – home to the team behind Mary Queen of Scots, Bridget Jones and many other incredible film and TV shows. Further east, in trendy Shoreditch, you’ll find the Monkey Kingdom team – makers of Made in Chelsea amongst many other hit UK TV shows. Wherever the teams in London may be, employees regularly gather for events on the incredible 10th floor Skyline space in Central Saint Giles overlooking the sights of London.\n\nTelemundo Center is the physical manifestation of our drive to raise the bar by being dynamic and diverse in everything we do: the way we create, produce and interact. This philosophy extends to providing employees with an environment that inspires their best work. In addition to state-of-the-art facilities, Telemundo Center offers best-in-class amenities, including meditation and yoga classes, massages, on-demand fuel delivery, dry cleaning, personal mailboxes, electric car chargers, a doctors on-demand room and a game room.\n\nThe São Paulo office is located in Vila Olimpia, known for its corporate headquarters and surrounded by skyscrapers. More than a business area, it’s also a busy shopping district. We love to talk about the nearby restaurants, as the city is a gastronomy destination. While in the office, you can meet new colleagues from different departments like Networks, Universal Parks & Resorts and E!. Then you can schedule a meeting at our Minions themed room in the mezzanine and drink an espresso on the balcony looking at the skyline.\n\nUniversal City is the west coast headquarters of NBCUniversal and is home to more than 14,000 employees across nearly 400 acres. With its own fitness center, medical clinic, restaurants, dry cleaners, and even its very own sheriff substation and fire station, Universal City is truly a city unto its own. NBCU’s businesses expand beyond the lot with Direct-to-Consumer’s state-of-the-art offices in Playa Vista and DreamWorks’ beautiful campus in Glendale with water fountains, koi ponds and zen-like walking paths to help inspire innovation and creativity.\n\nUniversal City is the west coast headquarters of NBCUniversal and is home to more than 14,000 employees across nearly 400 acres.
