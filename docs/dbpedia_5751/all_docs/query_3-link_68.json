        "text": "Abstract\n\nIn September 2014, Stephen Burke, chief executive officer at media and entertainment company NBCUniversal, has to decide between possible priorities for the company's 'Project Symphony,' guaranteeing the winners a high level of visibility and support across the media conglomerate's broadcast and cable television, film, and theme park divisions. Past \"Gold\" priorities for Symphony, an initiative introduced shortly after Comcast made steps to acquire NBCUniversal in 2010, saw subsequent success in the marketplace. Symphony is so powerful, in fact, that competing conglomerates are keen to buy some of NBCUniversal's cross-promotional strength, as Disney did with its megahit Frozen in 2014. For 2015, the choice is between five films—Fast & Furious 7, Fifty Shades of Grey, Jurassic World, Minions, and Pitch Perfect 2—as well as two choices in television. Which are most deserving of Gold status?\n\nKeywords\n\nCitation\n\nElberse, Anita. \"NBCUniversal.\" Harvard Business School Case 515-039, October 2014. (Revised December 2016.)"
