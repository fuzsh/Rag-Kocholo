        "text": "Zachary Quinto has a “brilliant” new show.\n\nThe trailer for his upcoming NBC medical drama, “Brilliant Minds,” is now available, and TODAY.com has an exclusive first look.\n\nThe series is inspired by the work of neurologist Oliver Sacks, who was the basis of the 1990 Robin Williams movie “Awakenings,” which was inspired by Sacks' 1973 book of the same name. Sacks died in 2015 at the age of 82.\n\nThe trailer opens with neurologist Oliver Wolf, played by \"Star Trek\" and \"Heroes\" star Quinto, getting chewed out by someone from the hospital where he works.\n\n“You’re a doctor. You put this facility at risk. We get it. You want to change how your patients see the world,” he’s told.\n\n“I want to change how the world sees my patients,” he replies.\n\nViewers then learn a little bit about just what kind of doctor he is.\n\nWolf is described as “a genius” and also “strange,” with one of his co-workers noting he went for a swim in New York City’s Hudson River.\n\n“People say he can't recognize faces,” someone else says. (In real life, Sacks had prosopagnosia, which is also known as face blindness and is a condition in which people “struggle to recognize faces or can’t interpret facial expressions and cues,” according to the Cleveland Clinic.)\n\nThe clip then moves to show him taking an older male patient out of the hospital on a motorcycle and whisking him to his granddaughter’s wedding.\n\n“Have you lost your mind?” Wolf is asked.\n\n“He has memories. We just need to unlock them,” Wolf says as the man sits down and begins singing and playing the piano.\n\nThe trailer also shows a woman who can’t recognize her sons, while Wolf pledges to help her before she appears to have a seizure while he works with her.\n\n“We’re close to a breakthrough,” he says.\n\nOne colleague also describes Wolf's condition as “a gift.”\n\n“It makes you look so much deeper,” she says.\n\nThe clip ends with the man Wolf took from the hospital at the wedding, where he astonishes his granddaughter by saying the name “Sophie.”\n\n“Inspired by the extraordinary life and work of world-famous author and physician Oliver Sacks, ‘Brilliant Minds’ follows a revolutionary, larger-than-life neurologist and his team of interns as they explore the last great frontier — the human mind — while grappling with their own relationships and mental health,” NBC says about the show in a press release.\n\n'Brilliant Minds' cast and premiere date\n\nIn addition to Quinto, “Brilliant Minds” also stars Tamberla Perry, Ashleigh LaThrop, Alex MacNicoll, Aury Krebs, Spence Moore II, Teddy Sears and Donna Murphy.\n\n“Brilliant Minds” premieres Monday, Sept. 23, at 10 p.m. ET when NBC kicks off an all-new fall season. It’s one of three freshmen shows on the peacock network, along with the comedy “St. Denis Medical” and the Reba McEntire-headlined sitcom “Happy’s Place.”"
