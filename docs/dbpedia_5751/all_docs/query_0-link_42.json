        "text": "Leonardo Munoz | AFP | Getty Images\n\nBusinesses worldwide grappled with an ongoing major IT outage Friday, as financial services and doctors' offices were disrupted, while some TV broadcasters went offline. Air travel has been hit particularly hard, with planes grounded, services delayed and airports issuing advice to passengers.\n\nThe outage came as cybersecurity giant CrowdStrike experienced a major disruption early Friday following an issue with a recent tech update.\n\nCrowdStrike CEO George Kurtz has since said that the company is \"actively working with customers impacted by a defect found in a single content update for Windows hosts,\" stressing that Mac and Linux hosts are not affected.\n\n\"This is not a security incident or cyberattack. The issue has been identified, isolated and a fix has been deployed,\" he said on social media.\n\nOne expert suggested it may be the \"largest IT outage in history.\"\n\nSeparately, Microsoft cloud services were restored after an outage, the company said on Friday, even as many users continued to report issues.\n\nShares of CrowdStrike closed down 11%.\n\nRead more:\n\nHow a software update from cyber firm CrowdStrike caused one of the world’s biggest IT blackouts\n\nFlights grounded, passengers to see delays amid global IT outage\n\nCrowdStrike shares fall after major outage hits businesses worldwide\n\nMicrosoft, CrowdStrike IT outage hits global supply chain, with air freight facing days or weeks to recover\n\nGlobal tech outage hits financial services companies, including Charles Schwab\n\nwatch now\n\nFTC Chair Lina Khan connects outage to competition and 'fragile systems'\n\nFTC Chair Lina Khan weighed in on the ongoing CrowdStrike outage in a series of posts on X on Friday. Without mentioning CrowdStrike or Microsoft, she appeared to blame the outage on concentrated market power, which creates \"fragile systems,\" she wrote.\n\n\"Concentrating production can concentrate risk, so that a single natural disaster or disruption has cascading effects,\" Khan wrote in the series of posts.\n\nKhan did not announce an FTC investigation of the incident, but she linked to unrelated past actions she has taken, including opening up a query on cloud computing companies, and seeking public comment on companies that frequently buy smaller competitors, like in the technology industry.\n\n— Kif Leswing\n\nAmazon warehouses and internal software disrupted by outage\n\nPeter Endig | AFP | Getty Images\n\nSome Amazon warehouses in the U.S. were grappling with disruptions set off by the global IT outage.\n\nThree Amazon warehouse staffers said the outage took down an app used by employees to manage their schedules and submit time off requests, called A to Z, early Friday morning, though it has since been restored in some areas. The employees asked to remain anonymous because they weren't authorized to speak publicly about the situation.\n\nThe outage also disrupted some Amazon employees' ability to access an internal service called \"Anytime Pay,\" which allows staffers to withdraw earnings before their next paycheck. \"Anytime Pay is unavailable due to a global outage impacting users to access internal IT services,\" according to a notice on Amazon's internal payroll site for warehouse staffers, which was viewed by CNBC.\n\nAt some sites, operations were briefly halted. An Amazon warehouse worker in South Carolina, who asked to remain anonymous, said their site passed the time by performing karaoke in exchange for \"cola cash,\" or credits that can be used to purchase snacks and drinks at the facility.\n\nThe disruptions also touched Amazon's trucking operations. Truck drivers who use Relay, a platform that lets them book jobs moving Amazon cargo, said they were briefly unable to pick up loads at Amazon warehouses due to system issues.\n\n\"Everything was bluescreened,\" said Dwight Evitt, a truck driver in San Marcos, Texas.\n\nRepresentatives from Amazon didn't respond to requests for comment.\n\n— Annie Palmer\n\nCrowdStrike CEO George Kurtz apologizes for global outage in blog post\n\nPatrick T. Fallon | Bloomberg | Getty Images\n\nCrowdStrike CEO George Kurtz apologized in a blog post for the global outage Friday and reiterated that his company is working closely with impacted customers and partners to restore all systems.\n\nKurtz encouraged customers to \"remain vigilant\" in ensuring they engage with official CrowdStrike representatives as they seek support.\n\n\"We know that adversaries and bad actors will try to exploit events like this,\" he wrote.\n\nHe added that the company's blog and technical support portal will remain the official channels for updates.\n\nKurtz reiterated the outage was caused by a defect in a Falcon content update for Windows hosts, and Mac and Linux hosts were not impacted. He emphasized again that the outage was not caused by a security breach or cyberattack.\n\n\"As we resolve this incident, you have my commitment to provide full transparency on how this occurred and steps we're taking to prevent anything like this from happening again,\" he wrote.\n\n-- Katie Bartlett\n\nRailroad Union Pacific returns to full capacity\n\nRailroad Union Pacific is now back to full capacity after facing processing delays and \"varying levels of impact\" earlier Friday.\n\n\"The vast majority of our customers' freight is moving and full fluidity is returning to our network after this morning's CrowdStrike software outage,\" Union Pacific told CNBC. \"In response to the outage our teams swiftly implemented protocols and communication plans, which allowed us to safely keep our trains running.\"\n\n-- Ece Yildirim\n\nCommonSpirit Health bringing computers back online one by one, CIO says\n\nAt CommonSpirit Health, which provides care across 150 hospitals in 24 states, employees noticed that many of the health systems' desktop computers were displaying a blue error screen in the early hours of Friday morning.\n\nThe health system has tens of thousands of computers, and they serve as a \"window\" into all of the organization's other systems, Daniel Barchi, CIO at CommonSpirit, told CNBC.\n\n\"It's the way our physicians who are doing surgery have access to the images that have been made on a patient's MRI,\" Barchi said. \"It's the way the nurse knows which drugs to give to the patient.\"\n\nBarchi said the disruption was deemed a \"priority one event,\" and that he and other senior IT leaders began working to identify the issue around 2 a.m. They determined the problem was related to an update that CrowdStrike had pushed out, and they were able to contain it before it had finished rolling out to all the computers within CommonSpirit.\n\nBut though some computers remained operational, the compromised computers must be fixed manually, one by one.\n\n\"We were all stunned by the fact that if a computer gets this blue screen lock up, there's no way to push a software patch to fix it,\" he said. \"You literally have to go up to it, login as an administrator, a technology person, and then delete a line of code and make that enabled to come back online.\"\n\nBarchi said CommonSpirit has managed to bring many of its computers back online, and many hospitals are returning to business as usual. The health system will continue its remediation process and work to fix its servers through the rest of the day, he said.\n\n-- Ashley Capoot\n\nTesla temporarily halts production at some manufacturing facilities after outage\n\nMichael M. Santiago | Getty Images\n\nElectric vehicle maker Tesla temporarily halted production on lines at some of its manufacturing facilities on Friday after an unprecedented IT outage impacted global operations due to system issues at cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike .\n\nAccording to correspondence obtained by CNBC, Tesla's IT teams notified employees that there was a \"windows host outage,\" and different systems were affected including \"servers, laptops and manufacturing devices.\" The IT teams informed Tesla employees that they may see a \"blue screen\" on their various devices.\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk, who also owns social media platform X, posted several complaints about the CrowdStrike outages to his account, which has more than 190 million followers, throughout the morning.\n\nTwo Tesla employees who spoke with CNBC, but asked to remain unnamed because they were not authorized to speak on behalf of the company, said that some manufacturing lines were slow to start on Friday morning, and others were temporarily halted in California and Nevada. They also said managers were telling some workers to prepare for canceled shifts or to go home early.\n\nBusiness Insider, which first reported on the IT memo, wrote that workers in Tesla's Texas vehicle assembly plant were sent home overnight in response to the outages as well.\n\nAs a key Tesla vendor, Microsoft , scrambled to restore its apps and services Friday morning, CEO Satya Nadella wrote in a statement on X that an update from CrowdStrike on Thursday impacted global IT systems.\n\nIn replies to Nadella on X, Musk wrote that the outages had caused a \"seizure\" to the automotive supply chain, adding, \"We just deleted CrowdStrike from all our systems, so no rollouts at all.\"\n\nEmployees confirmed that Tesla was using CrowdStrike as of Friday.\n\nTesla shares were down more than 3% in afternoon trading on Friday. Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for further information.\n\n— Lora Kolodny\n\nOutage hits Starbucks mobile ordering, causing chaos at stores\n\nJordan Vonderhaar | Bloomberg | Getty Images\n\nThe outage has also halted the ability to order Starbucks through its mobile app.\n\nThe issue has caused chaos for baristas and other Starbucks employees, leading to temporary store closures and frantic posts online seeking assistance.\n\nAt some stores, employees created various handwritten signs for customers, announcing store closures or asking customers to walk up or show an employee a mobile receipt.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\n— Kat Tenbarge, NBC News\n\nMore than 4,000 flights cancelled globally due to outage, data shows\n\nMichael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty Images\n\nNearly 4% of all scheduled flights around the world have been cancelled due to the disruption, according to new data from the aviation analytics firm Cirium on Friday.

CEO George Kurtz roundly criticized Microsoft in an interview with CNBC last year.\n\n-- Rohan Goswami\n\nTired travelers cope ... and drink\n\nKevin Brueninger | CNBC\n\nTravelers stuck this morning at JFK Airport in New York met the delays with resignation, weariness and a need to hit the bar.\n\nColby Black, 45, took the delays in stride, even though he wasn't sure when his rescheduled flight to Los Angeles would take off. It was originally set to depart at 6 a.m.\n\n\"I'm just tired. I want to sleep,\" said Black, who woke up at 3 a.m. \"But otherwise, yeah, it happens.\"\n\nOne mother said she hadn't slept the night before, just so she and her infant son could get to JFK on time.\n\n\"I'm still up, running on no sleep,\" she said as she was seated on a barstool beside a heavy pour of chilled white wine. She wasn't originally planning to order a preflight drink.\n\n\"Hell no. I got to the airport at 4 o'clock this morning,\" she said.\n\n-- Kevin Breuninger\n\nU.S. securities regulators are monitoring the situation, as impacted stocks pare back losses.\n\nAdam Jeffery | CNBC\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission said it isn't impacted by the outage but is \"monitoring for market-related impacts.\"\n\nCrowdStrike shares are down around 9% in midday trading, significantly paring back earlier losses.

Additionally, some groups have reported problems with their data center software, which means they are unable to access patient records through Epic.\n\n\"Organizations that have been affected are following pre-established downtime protocols to continue delivering patient care,\" an Epic spokesperson told CNBC in a statement. \"Epic staff are working with customer IT teams to restore access as fixes or mitigation approaches are available from CrowdStrike.\"\n\nEpic said its platform for cloud-based applications called Nebula was impacted by the outage.
