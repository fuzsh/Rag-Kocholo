        "text": "Though Peacock has already been available for Xfinity subscribers since April, the official launch of NBCUniversal's new streaming service is coming up fast on Wednesday, July 15. And with that launch comes a brand new slate of shows to binge! From David Schwimmer's new workplace comedy set in the world of international spies to a drama rendition of Brave New World to the latest installment of the ever-reliable Psych universe, Peacock is set to wow subscribers with a mix of nostalgia and brand new original content.

The premiere dates are listed next to the titles where available; \"TBD\" indicates that the show has been ordered to series but the exact premiere date is unknown.

Emmy Rossum will star as Angelyne in the new series from Mr. Robot creator Sam Esmail.\n\nA.P. Bio Season 3 (Sept. 3): After NBC canceled the comedy following its second season, A.P.

Accustomed to a life of abundance, they will be forced to join forces in the most unusual manner.\n\nBattlestar Galactica (TBD): The second Sam Esmail series for Peacock explores a new story within the mythology of Battlestar Galactica, which saw humanity at war with Cylons, machines of their own creation. It is expected to take place within the universe of Syfy's 2004 series rather than the 1978 original series. The new show will be neither a reboot nor a revival; Esmail clarified on Twitter that the series will \"explore a new story within the mythology while staying true to the spirit of Battlestar.\"\n\nBrave New World (July 15): Based on Aldous Huxley's groundbreaking novel, Brave New World imagines a utopian society that has achieved peace and stability through the prohibition of monogamy, privacy, money, family, and history itself.

But when damning CCTV footage from a night out in London comes to light, Shaun's life takes a shocking turn, and he must soon fight for his freedom once again. Detective Inspector Rachel Carey (Holliday Grainger) is drafted to investigate Shaun's case, but she quickly learns that the truth can sometimes be a matter of perspective.\n\nClean Slate (TBD): From legendary producer Norman Lear comes a new comedy called Clean Slate.

Patients entered his operating room for complex but routine spinal surgeries and left permanently maimed or dead. As victims piled up, two fellow physicians, neurosurgeon Robert Henderson (Alec Baldwin) and vascular surgeon Randall Kirby (Christian Slater), set out to stop him. Dr. Death explores the twisted mind of a sociopath and the gross negligence of the system designed to protect the most defenseless among us.\n\nDivision One (Development): A new series from Amy Poehler, Division One is a coming-of-age comedy about an underdog women's collegiate soccer team that gets a new female coach -- a former professional soccer player who's fallen from grace -- and must decide whether or not they're going to take the risk of trying to be great.\n\nExpecting (Development): From the mind of Mindy Kaling comes a new kind of musing on motherhood.

When Jonathan surprises himself by saying yes, it sets off a chain of events that turn Ellie and Jonathan's personal and professional lives upside down as they try to turn their chosen family into a biological one.\n\nFive Bedrooms (Aug. 13): This is a story of five unlikely allies in life who throw caution to the wind and hit upon a unique solution to a common problem. Ignoring the nay-saying of families and friends, they're teaming up, signing contracts, and buying a house together. Yes, it's a grand social experiment.

The show explores the ever-expanding boundaries of the queer community and occasionally harsh realities of our time with authenticity, outrageous humor, and compassion. The heartbreak that will tear the characters apart in the pilot will ignite the fire that brings them together and sets the stage for a vibrant and cathartic series about resilience and love.\n\nRutherford Falls (TBD): Co-created by Mike Schur, Sierra Teller Ornelas, and Ed Helms -- who also stars -- Rutherford Falls is about a small town in upstate New York that is turned upside down when local legend and town namesake Nathan Rutherford fights the moving of a historical statue.\n\nSaved by the Bell (TBD): When California Gov. Zack Morris (Mark-Paul Gosselaar) gets into hot water for closing too many low-income high schools, he proposes they send the affected students to the highest performing schools in the state -- including Bayside High.

Mario Lopez and Elizabeth Berkley will reprise their roles as AC Slater and Jessie Spano, respectively.\n\nStraight Talk (Development): Produced by Rashida Jones and starring Jada Pinkett Smith, Straight Talk examines what happens when two opposing ideologies are forced into an odd coupling.
