        "text": "Here it is, the only excuse you’ll ever need to never leave your house again: more than 40(!) seasons total of Law & Order and its spin-off series. Dick Wolf’s much beloved franchise is among the biggest draws of the new Peacock streaming service, which will launch on July 15.\n\n(Rotten Tomatoes is also a division of NBCUniversal.)\n\nWhat’s It Called?\n\n(Photo by NBCUniversal)\n\nThe official name for the new competitor to Netflix, Hulu, Apple TV+, Disney+, and the recently-launched HBO Max: Peacock. (Yes, like the company logo.)\n\nWhen Does It Launch?\n\nComcast customers got a “sneak peek” on April 15. Other viewers get access to the service on July 15.

There’s an option to go ad-free for an additional $5 a month. The minimal-ad offer is currently bundled at no cost Comcast’s Xfinity X1 and Flex customers and a similar trial promotion will be available at launch to Android and Android TV users and some others. Starting on July 20, this tiered model will also be available on Sony Interactive Entertainment’s PlayStation 4 systems. As of now, it will not be accessible through Roku and Amazon Fire TV.\n\nThose who don’t want to shell out for a(nother) streaming service can partake of Peacock Free, the fully ad-supported tier.\n\nAnd about that lineup …\n\nWhat Can I Watch On It?\n\n(Photo by NBC)\n\nIn addition to every season of the original Law & Order, and spin-offs Law & Order: Special Victims Unit, and Law & Order: Criminal Intent, Dick Wolf’s Chicago franchise — Chicago Fire, Chicago P.D., and Chicago Med — will stream on Peacock.
