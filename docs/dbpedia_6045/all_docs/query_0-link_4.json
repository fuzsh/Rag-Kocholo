        "text": "The World Health Organization (WHO) has granted emergency approval for a Covid vaccine made by Chinese state-owned company Sinopharm.\n\nIt is the first vaccine developed by a non-Western country to get WHO backing.\n\nThe vaccine has already been given to millions of people in China and elsewhere.\n\nThe WHO had previously only approved the vaccines made by Pfizer, AstraZeneca, Johnson & Johnson and Moderna.\n\nBut individual health regulators in various countries - especially poorer ones in Africa, Latin America and Asia - have approved Chinese jabs for emergency use.\n\nWith little data released internationally early on, the effectiveness of the various Chinese vaccines has long been uncertain.\n\nBut the WHO on Friday said it had validated the \"safety, efficacy and quality\" of the Sinopharm jab developed by the Beijing Institute of Biological Products.\n\nThe WHO said the addition of the vaccine had \"the potential to rapidly accelerate Covid-19 vaccine access for countries seeking to protect health workers and populations at risk\".\n\nIt is recommending that the vaccine be administered in two doses to those aged 18 and over.\n\nA decision is expected in the coming days on another Chinese vaccine developed by Sinovac, while Russia's Sputnik vaccine is under assessment.\n\nWhy does WHO backing matter?\n\nThe green light from the global health body is a guideline for national regulators that a vaccine is safe and effective.\n\nWHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said it would give countries \"confidence to expedite their own regulatory approval\".\n\nIt also means that the vaccine can be used in the global Covax programme, which was set up last year to try to ensure fair access to vaccines among rich and poor nations.\n\nThe decision to list the Chinese vaccine for emergency use is expected to give a substantial boost to the scheme, which has been struggling with supply problems.\n\nPrior to the WHO approval, the Sinopharm vaccine was already being widely used, with an estimated 65 million doses administered, according to reports.\n\nIn addition to China, countries already using the vaccine include the UAE, Pakistan and Hungary.\n\nThe decision on Friday to approve the vaccine for emergency use was made by the WHO's technical advisory group, which reviewed the latest clinical data and manufacturing practices.\n\nIt said the vaccine's efficacy for symptomatic and hospitalised cases of Covid-19 was estimated to be 79%.\n\nThe WHO noted that few adults over the age of 60 were included in clinical trials, so efficacy could not be estimated for this age group. But it said there was no reason to think that the vaccine would act differently in older recipients.\n\nThe health body is yet to reach a decision on China's Sinovac vaccine. WHO experts on Friday said they were awaiting additional information before they could make a recommendation.\n\nMillions of doses of that vaccine have also already been shipped to a number of countries, which have permitted its emergency usage.\n\nOne of the Chinese vaccines' main advantages is that they can be stored in a standard refrigerator at 2-8 degrees Celsius, like the AstraZeneca vaccine.\n\nThe WHO said these \"easy storage requirements\" made the Sinopharm vaccine \"highly suitable for low-resource settings\".\n\nHow do the Chinese shots work?\n\nThe two Chinese vaccines differ significantly from some of the other Covid vaccines currently in use, especially those by Pfizer and Moderna.\n\nDeveloped in a more traditional way, they are so-called inactivated vaccines, which means they use killed viral particles to expose the immune system to the virus without risking a serious disease response.\n\nBy comparison, the BioNtech/Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are mRNA vaccines. This means part of the coronavirus' genetic code is injected into the body, training the immune system how to respond to it."
