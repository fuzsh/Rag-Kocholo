        "text": "Difference between Sinopharm and Sinovac\n\nPeople who are unable to take Pfizer or Moderna as a vaccine, are now able to go for Sinopharm or Sinovac. They are both vaccines from China and there are relevant reports and data that shows that they are safe and reliable based on China’s Foreign Ministry.\n\nIf you are still considering which vaccine to take, let us break down the details before you make the decision.\n\nSinovac\n\nSinovac, developed by Beijing-based biopharmaceutical company, is an inactivated virus technology that injects dead coronavirus particles into the body. It will trigger our body’s immune system to produce antibodies by itself to counter COVID-19.\n\nDuring May this year, Sinovac has shown vaccine effectiveness of 66 per cent against variants such as Alpha and Gamma based on the real-world effectiveness study in Chile. It showed that it is capable of offering more than 86 per cent protection against outcomes like hospitalisation, admission to intensive care units and even death.\n\nHowever, there is insufficient data on the vaccine protection for Delta variant, immunocompromised patients and patients with comorbidities which includes cancers, cardiovascular diseases and diabetes.\n\nThere is currently no data on the breakthrough infections but a Sinovac study that is not from Chile has shown that this vaccine was not as effective as Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna at preventing infection among vaccinated individuals.\n\nSinopharm\n\nSimilar to Sinovac, Sinopharm is also an inactivated virus technology that teaches your body to produce antibodies with your immune system.\n\nSinopharm developed with Beijing Institute of Biological Products has an efficacy rate of 78.1 per cent while Sinovac has an efficacy rate of 51 per cent in preventing symptomatic Covid-19 infection.\n\nBased on the data from Mongolia, Sinopharm was also more protective than Russian vaccine according to the Health Ministry. Also, most of the other Covid-19 vaccines have side-effects such as fever and fatigue but they were uncommon for Sinovac or Sinopharm.\n\nHowever, as of now there is no data on the effectiveness of Sinopharm against any variant of concern despite its use in more than 50 countries.\n\nBook your Sinopharm vaccine appointment at our clinics here:\n\n1 Dose – https://my.setmore.com/bookingpage/8b8eade7-6816-4232-b0f9-d16b48c9a390/services/53431128-d92c-4320-822f-986a8ea9de2f?source=easyshare\n\n2 Doses – https://my.setmore.com/bookingpage/8b8eade7-6816-4232-b0f9-d16b48c9a390/services/s34271fa47e41eae12ca8799ad23ec131c5348739?source=easyshare\n\nSinopharm Vaccine are available at these clinics:\n\nOrchard\n\nHealthsprings Medical Associates\n\nAddress: 541 Orchard Road #10-02, Liat Towers Singapore 238881\n\nContact number: +65 6734 5260 / +65 9728 7793\n\nWoodleigh\n\nHealthsprings Medical and Laser Clinic\n\n105A Bidadari Park Drive #01-09, Singapore 341105\n\nContact number: +65 6970 7933 / +65 8338 8800\n\nSources:\n\n-https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/is-sinovac-safe-5-questions-about-the-covid-19-vaccine\n\n-https://www.straitstimes.com/world/they-relied-on-chinese-vaccines-now-theyre-battling-outbreaks\n\n-https://theconversation.com/what-are-the-sinopharm-and-sinovac-vaccines-and-how-effective-are-they-two-experts-explain-162258\n\nHow To Deal With Long COVID?\n\nA growing population of individuals who have had an acute COVID-19 infection experience a wide range of persistent symptoms.
