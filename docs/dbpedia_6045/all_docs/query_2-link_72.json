        "text": "Bangladesh is all set to start locally manufacturing China's Sinopharm COVID-19 inactivated vaccine after an agreement on co-production of the Chinese jab was signed virtually on Monday.\n\nThe memorandum of understanding (MoU) was signed between China's Sinopharm Group, Bangladesh's Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, and Incepta Vaccine Ltd., a leading local vaccine manufacturing company.\n\nChinese Ambassador to Bangladesh Li Jiming said that the successful signing of the MoU will be a successful model for cooperation between China and South Asian countries. He emphasized that vaccine cooperation requires full mobilization and joint efforts from the government and enterprises.\n\nBangladeshi Health and Family Welfare Minister Zahid Maleque said the signing of the agreement marked a new milestone in the China-Bangladesh relationship.\n\nThe minister expressed the hope that local production of the Chinese vaccine would start as soon as possible.\n\nFor his part, Bangladeshi Foreign Minister AK Abdul Momen said it is a historic day for Bangladesh and the China-Bangladesh friendship.\n\nLiu Jingzhen, chair of Sinopharm Group, said after the agreement is implemented, the Bangladeshi company will be able to distribute at least 5 million doses of COVID-19 inactivated vaccine every month in the country for local pandemic prevention and control.\n\nProduced by Xinhua Global Service"
