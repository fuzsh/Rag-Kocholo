        "text": "Chinese authorities have given conditional approval for general public use of a coronavirus vaccine developed by state-owned drugmaker Sinopharm.\n\nThe move came a day after the firm said interim data showed its leading vaccine had a 79% efficacy rate in phase three trials, without providing more details.\n\nSeveral Chinese-made vaccines at a late trial stage are already in use in China after being granted emergency licences.\n\nThe pandemic emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan in December 2019.\n\nIt has since spread around the world, but China has managed to bring infection rates down to very low levels through strict anti-virus measures.\n\nThe search for the source of the coronavirus has led to tensions with the West. The US - among a number of other countries - raised questions about whether China was fully transparent when the virus first emerged there.\n\nThe deputy commissioner of China's National Medical Products Administration, Chen Shifei, announced the decision at a news conference in Beijing.\n\n\"After a series of strict reviews, verification, test and data analysis in accordance with the law and procedures, it is concluded that the known and potential benefits of Sinopharm's new inactivated coronavirus vaccine are bigger than the known and potential risks, and it fully meets the pre-set requirements of conditional marketing standards,\" he said.\n\nVice Minister of the National Health Commission Zeng Yixin said approval would allow the government to \"extend vaccination to high-risk groups, those susceptible to a severe viral infection... and the elderly\".\n\nIn July, China approved three different jabs for emergency use in key workers and other people at high risk. More than 4.5 million doses have so far been administered.\n\nBeijing hopes to inoculate tens of millions more people by mid-February, the start of the Chinese New Year.\n\nSinopharm is also working on a second vaccine, and a number of other Chinese vaccines are in production. These include CoronaVac, made by the Beijing-based biopharmaceutical company Sinovac.\n\nSome experts have given a cautious welcome to the approval of the Sinopharm vaccine in China, but they also point out that no detailed data from trials have been publicly released.\n\n\"The lack of fully reviewed papers or data published by official institutions makes it difficult to comment on the efficacy of the Chinese or Russian vaccines,\" Song Man-ki from the International Vaccine Institute in Seoul, told Reuters news agency.\n\n\"We can't simply evaluate a vaccine based on a drugmaker's statement... More data will be compiled once some countries begin vaccinations.\"\n\nSingapore has also signed advance purchase agreements with vaccine makers including Sinovac, as well as Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech.\n\nShipments of Sinovac have arrived in Indonesia and Sinovac is also known to have secured other deals with Turkey, Brazil and Chile.\n\nAnalysts point to China's bid to win the vaccine diplomacy race, which has also reportedly seen China's President Xi Jinping pledge to set aside $2bn (Â£1.5bn) for the African continent, while also offering Latin American and Caribbean countries a $1bn loan to buy vaccines. It's unclear what the terms of such a deal might be."
