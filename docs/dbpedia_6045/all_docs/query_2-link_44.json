        "text": "Sinopharm COVID-19 Vaccine\n\nWhat you need to know about Sinopharm vaccine\n\nSingle-dose vaccine\n\nDouble-dose vaccine\n\nOn this page:\n\nWhat's different about Sinopharm vaccine?\n\nWho is eligible for the Sinopharm vaccine?\n\nHow does Sinopharm vaccine work?\n\nHow effective is Sinopharm?\n\nHow safe is Sinopharm?\n\nRegister your interest in Sinopharm vaccine\n\nFrequently Asked Questions about Sinopharm vaccine\n\nWhat’s different about the Sinopharm vaccine?\n\nIt uses inactivated virus to fight against COVID-19\n\nSinopharm uses a traditional and widely known method of inactivated virus to protect against COVID-19.\n\nThe virus is inactivated through chemical treatment\n\nBeta-propiolactone is the chemical that binds to the SARS-CoV-2 virus’ genetic material and inactivates it, preventing it from replicating and causing COVID-19.\n\nIt is stored at normal fridge temperatures\n\nLike the traditional flu vaccination, Sinopharm can be stored at normal refrigerator temperatures.\n\nWho is eligible for taking Sinopharm?\n\nIndividuals aged 18 years and older, with no history of anaphylaxis.\n\nIndividuals with a history of anaphylaxis or any form of severe allergic reactions to medication/food/vaccination should not be administered with the vaccine.\n\nIndividuals with a body temperature over 38.5ºC should postpone vaccination until the fever subsides.\n\nWhat is the recommended dosage for administration?\n\nAccording to WHO, the recommendation is two-dose with an interval of 3-4 weeks between first and second dose.\n\nHow does Sinopharm vaccine work?\n\nSimilar to Sinovac, Sinopharm vaccine is a vaccine that uses inactivated COVID-19 virus to teach your immune system to make antibodies against COVID-19, creating an immune response to COVID-19.\n\nWhen introduced to your body, your immune system will make antibodies against the coronavirus, attaching to viral proteins. As the vaccine uses a dead or inactivated virus, the vaccine can be safely injected into the arm without causing the individual to develop COVID-19.\n\nOnce the vaccine is in your system, some of the inactivated viruses will be absorbed by a type of immune cell called the anti-gen presenting cell. This type of cell will then display some of the fragments of inactivated virus on its surface, then known as a helper T cell. If the fragment fits onto the surface protein of the cell, it then can be activated and gets other immune cells to also respond to the vaccine.\n\nWhen you are vaccinated with Sinopharm, your body’s immune system can respond to an infection of live coronaviruses by producing antibodies to block the virus.\n\nHow effective is Sinopharm?\n\nEfficacy rate of 75% against symptomatic COVID-19 infection and an efficacy of 75% against hospitalisation.\n\nHow safe is Sinopharm?\n\nSAGE (Strategic Advisory Group of Experts) from WHO has thoroughly assessed the data on quality, safety and efficacy of the vaccine and has recommended its use for people aged 18 and above.\n\nThe most commonly reported side effects in this trial were fever and pain at the injection site. Based on the data from clinical trials, the most common side effects recorded were:\n\nheadaches\n\nfatigue\n\ninjection site reactions\n\nThese side effects were mild to moderate, and similar to those of other authorized vaccines against COVID-19.\n\nRegister your interest for Sinopharm COVID-19 vaccine\n\nFAQs: Frequently asked questions about Sinopharm COVID-19 vaccine\n\nAfter a thorough review by SAGE, WHO assessed the vaccine efficacy for Sinopharm is up to 75 percent.\n\nOn 7 May 7 2021, WHO approved the Sinopharm COVID-19 vaccine for emergency use, allowing the vaccine to be distributed globally. The Sinopharm vaccine is produced by Beijing Bio-Institute of Biological Products Co Ltd, subsidiary of China National Biotec Group (CNBG).\n\nSAGE has thoroughly assessed the data on quality, safety and efficacy of the vaccine and has recommended its use for people aged 18 and above.\n\nDue to the small number of participants above 60 years of age, there is limited data on the safety of the vaccines for this age group. While there are no salient differences in the safety profile of the vaccine in older adults compared to the younger age groups, persons aged 60 and above that are considering Sinopharm should seek medical advice and be actively monitored.\n\nThe COVID-19 Sinopharm vaccine triggers the immune system to produce a response to the inactivated version of the COVID-19 virus. MRNA vaccines work by injecting the COVID-19 genetic code into the body, triggering the production of viral proteins that trains the immune system to defend against the virus.\n\nWHO recommends the Sinopharm vaccine for people aged 18 years and above. Those who have had COVID-19 in the past are eligible for vaccination post six months after COVID-19 infection. Lactating women are eligible to be administered with the Sinopharm vaccine, and able to continue breastfeeding post-vaccination.\n\nIndividuals with a history of anaphylaxis or any form of severe allergic reactions to medication/food/vaccination should not be administered with the vaccine.\n\nIndividuals with a body temperature over 38.5ºC should postpone vaccination until the fever subsides.\n\nBased on the data from clinical trials, the common side effects are headaches, fatigue and fever. These reported side effects were mild to moderate, like the other approved COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nAll the vaccines approved by WHO Emergency Use Listing are highly effective in preventing severe disease and hospitalization due to COVID-19.\n\nUnder the special access route (SAR), Raffles Medical Group has received approval to import the Sinopharm vaccines. You may register your interest, and you will be notified on next steps once the vaccine is available. Do note that registration of interest does not guarantee access to vaccines as it is subjected to availability and prevailing criteria.\n\nTwo doses are required with an interval of 3-4 weeks between first and second dose.\n\nIn case of any clarifications, seek advice from your medical doctor to assess your suitability. You may visit one of our clinics to do so or send in an enquiry.\n\nFootnotes & references:\n\nThe Sinopharm COVID-19 vaccine: What you need to know\n\nSinopharm COVID-19 vaccine: Should you worry about the side effects?"
