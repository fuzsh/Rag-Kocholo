        "text": "A Chinese COVID-19 vaccine has been launched in the Pacific, with the Deputy Prime Minister of Solomon Islands receiving the first Sinopharm shot in the region.\n\nChina delivered 50,000 doses of Sinopharm to the capital Honiara before the vaccine was approved, but Friday's launch clears its use across the Pacific nation.\n\n\"Solomon Islands is the first country to put Sinopharm vaccines into its national roll-out plan,\" Li Ming, China's ambassador to the Solomon Islands, said.\n\nSolomon Islands will offer Sinopharm alongside the AstraZeneca vaccine to frontline workers and \"special groups\", including students who plan to travel to China, in what officials say is an integral step to get the population vaccinated.\n\n\"Had we not had this second option [of the Sinopharm vaccine] we will be placed in a very difficult situation where certain parts of our country may not be able to have the chance to be vaccinated,\" said Health Minister Culwick Togamana.\n\nIt comes the same week as Australia offers a further 60,000 doses of its locally-made AstraZeneca vaccine to the Pacific nation, in what some say points to a growing diplomatic rivalry between China and Australia in the region.\n\nChina has also pledged to provide 200,000 doses of Sinopharm to Papua New Guinea, which is working to control a growing outbreak.\n\nHow do the vaccines compare?\n\nSinopharm was approved for emergency use by the World Health Organization earlier this month — the first COVID-19 vaccine developed by a non-Western nation to receive this backing.\n\nThe reported efficacy of Sinopharm is 79 per cent.\n\nThe green light allows it to be included in COVAX, a global initiative to provide vaccines to low-income countries.\n\nBut that facility is only committed to providing 20 per cent of a country's vaccine needs, which means many Pacific nations will need to find international donors to fill the gaps.\n\nAustralia has already made 58,000 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine available to Pacific countries, including PNG, Fiji, Solomon Islands and Timor-Leste.\n\nRecent updates from AstraZeneca suggest an efficacy of 76 per cent, up from the initial 62-70 per cent reported from phase 3 clinical trials.\n\nPacific health officials say they are not concerned about where their vaccines come from — just that they will protect their citizens.\n\n\"Where it's approved by WHO, and if it's in the country, we are to use and roll that out,\" Pauline McNeil, Solomon Islands' permanent secretary for health and medical services, said.\n\nBut there are some early concerns over Sinopharm's efficacy.\n\nUnited Arab Emirates and Bahrain, both early adopters of the vaccine, have recently announced the roll-out of a third booster shot amid complaints of an insufficient antibody response following the first two Sinopharm doses.\n\nProfessor Fiona Russell from the University of Melbourne — who is on a WHO technical working group for COVID-19 vaccinations in the Western Pacific — said the possible need for three doses of Sinopharm \"might be an issue\" for Pacific countries with limited health budgets.\n\n\"If this is going to be an annual thing, then that's a real pain, it's just really difficult,\" Professor Russell said.\n\nShe also raised concerns around challenges Pacific health workers might face in administering both the Sinopharm and AstraZeneca vaccines.\n\nBoth brands require at least two doses, but have differing schedules around when those shots need to be given and the number of doses per vial.\n\n\"It does make things more complicated ... particularly [for] small countries, which have got fewer human resources,\" Professor Russell said.\n\n\"If there are two different vaccines going on in the community in the small countries at the same time, that makes it even more challenging.\"\n\nSolomon Islands has delivered special training to health workers to help them administer the Sinopharm vaccine correctly.\n\nJelta Wong, PNG's Health Minister, said he welcomed the additional vaccines donated by China.\n\n\"We think that it is good to have a variety of vaccines in the country for our people,\" he said.\n\nMr Wong earlier indicated Sinopharm would only be made available to Chinese citizens, but now says locals who want it instead of AstraZeneca can have it too.\n\n\"If they are not comfortable with taking the AstraZeneca, at least we have another vaccine that they're comfortable to take,\" he said.\n\nVaccine diplomacy in the Pacific\n\nSinopharm is said to be a key component of China's \"vaccine diplomacy\", where hundreds of millions of doses of Chinese-made vaccines are being offered to low-and middle-income countries around the world.\n\n\"China will also readily consider providing COVID-19 vaccines to these countries in light of their needs through various ways, making China's contribution by ensuring the accessibility and affordability of vaccines in the Pacific island countries,\" Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Hua Chunying said earlier this year.\n\nIn the Pacific, China's attempts to woo government leaders have faced further scrutiny amid accusations it is expanding its geopolitical base.\n\nLess than two years ago, Beijing convinced Solomon Islands and Kiribati to sever ties with Taipei, and Australian leaders have warned of China's growing threat in the Indo-Pacific.\n\nJonathan Pryke from the Lowy Institute said, in the case of COVID-19 vaccines, the perception of a diplomatic rivalry can be beneficial for small Pacific states.\n\n\"Every area is now framed in this geopolitical competition in the Pacific and it does help generate more momentum and more ambition,\" Mr Pryke said.\n\nBut he believes there is a more important objective at stake.\n\n\"Ultimately it's in everyone's interest to have a well-vaccinated Pacific so we can all open up to each other faster and safely,\" he said.\n\nPacific public health expert Dr Colin Tukuitonga doesn't think many Pacific islanders will care where vaccines come from, just that they provide protection against COVID-19.\n\n\"China's in the region with the support of many governments and clearly they see some benefit,\" he said.\n\n\"The vaccine supply to developing countries and particularly small island states is always going to be fragile.\"\n\nSolomon Islands is considered COVID-free, without a single case of community transmission.\n\nAsk us your coronavirus questions"
