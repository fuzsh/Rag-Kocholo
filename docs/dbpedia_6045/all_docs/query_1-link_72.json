        "text": "Reuters\n\nUpdated On Feb 22, 2024 at 11:38 AM IST\n\nRead by: 100 Industry Professionals\n\nRead by 100 Industry Professionals\n\nNew Delhi: A consortium led by state-owned pharma giant Sinopharm has revived a take-private bid for China Traditional Chinese Medicine Holdings, the Hong-Kong-listed drugmaker said on Wednesday, valuing it at HK$23.16 billion ($2.96 billion).\n\nChina National Pharmaceutical, also known as Sinopharm, had in 2021 decided against a possible privatisation of China TCM.\n\nSinopharm, the parent of China-TCM, already holds a 32.46 per cent stake in China-TCM and has offered to pay HK$4.6 per share in cash to buyout the drugmaker.\n\nThe offer price represents a 34.11 per cent premium to the traditional medicine maker's closing price of HK$3.43 per share before trading in the stock was halted.\n\nAdvt\n\nThe deal, if goes through, would be one of the biggest privatisation deal for a Hong-Kong listed firm since Haier Electronics' $5 billion acquisition in 2020.\n\nSinopharm has also indicated it will not raise the offer price to take China-TCM private.\n\nThe offer comes as the drugmaker lags a surge in valuations for many mainland-listed Chinese medicinal firms in and around the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\"Whether the privatisation would be successful this time still depends on the outcome of negotiations among different parties, which is full of uncertainty,\" said Xinyao (Criss) Wang, HK/China healthcare analyst at Smartkarma in a note.\n\nThe potential deal would add to a surge in strategic investors and buyout firms tapping Hong Kong for take-private opportunities. Buyers often cite undervalued shares as a reason for the deals.\n\nMedia reports had earlier emerged in 2022 over Sinopharm and its advisers preparing a potential offer of about HK$6 for each China-TCM share.\n\nChina TCM shares had jumped as much as 10 per cent to HK$3.43 on Wednesday, taking its market value to HK$16.9 billion.\n\nThe drugmaker had in late January said it expects its 2023 net income to likely increase by 85 per cent to 95 per cent.\n\nJoin the community of 2M+ industry professionals\n\nSubscribe to our newsletter to get latest insights & analysis.\n\nDownload ETHealthworld App\n\nGet Realtime updates\n\nSave your favourite articles"
