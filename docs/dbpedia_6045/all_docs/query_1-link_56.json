        "text": "The World Health Organisation (WHO) on May 7 granted approval to China's Covid-19 vaccine Sinopharm, boosting the global vaccine supply at a time when countries across the world are facing the brunt of the surge in coronavirus cases.\n\nWhile the WHO approval came in May, Beijing has already been supplying the vaccine to several countries including Pakistan, Seychelles, and others apart from vaccinating its own population.\n\nadvertisement\n\n\"The ongoing Phase-III clinical trials of one of China's Sinopharm Covid-19 vaccines, which have been conducted in five Arab countries since the summer of 2020, show an efficacy of 78.89 per cent on people aged 18 and above,\" Global Times quoted company executives as saying.\n\nHowever, the story changes when you look towards a tropical paradise, Seychelles, that is now closing schools and restricting outside movement as Covid-19 cases rise months after it vaccinated most of its people. The country with a population of 100,000 people first used China's Sinopharm vaccine followed by Covishield developed by AstraZeneca in India. According to reports, 37 per cent of new cases are in people who are fully vaccinated.\n\nHow does Sinopharm work?\n\nDeveloped by the Beijing Institute of Biological Products, Sinopharm is an inactivated coronavirus vaccine also called BBIBP-CorV. Inactivated vaccines kill the disease-carrying viruses using heat, chemicals, or radiation. The Covaxin developed by Bharat Biotech uses a similar design. The Chinese vaccine works by teaching the immune system to create antibodies against SARS-Cov-2. The antibodies that are developed attach themselves to the spike-proteins that stud the surface of the virus.\n\nScientists at the Beijing Institute obtained three variants of the coronavirus from patients in Chinese hospitals to develop the BBIBP-CorV. The variant that was finally picked was one that multiplied faster than others on monkey kidney cells, according to a report in New York Times. As they created a large stock of the virus, they were then doused with a chemical called beta-propiolactone. This compound disabled the virus by bonding itself to its genes, stopping its replication. However, the spike proteins remained intact. The inactivated virus was then mixed with an aluminium-based compound to stimulate the immune system to boost its response to a vaccine.\n\nAlso Read: China investigated weaponising coronaviruses in 2015: Reports\n\nOnce injected into the body some of these inactivated viruses are eaten up by antigen cells that act as immune cells. The antigen-cell tears the coronavirus and displays some of its fragments. \"A so-called helper T cell may detect the fragment. If the fragment fits into one of its surface proteins, the T cell becomes activated and can help recruit other immune cells to respond to the vaccine,\" the report stated.\n\nWhile clinical trials have shown that the vaccine is effective in stopping the coronavirus from replicating, there is no study on how long that immunity lasts.\n\nAlso Read: WHO experts voice \"very low confidence\" in some Chinese Covid-19 vaccine Sinopharm's data\n\nWho can get the Chinese vaccine?\n\nAccording to World Health Organisation, the BBIBP-CorV can be given to people who have had Covid-19 in the past. However, the WHO in its assessment maintained that \"symptomatic reinfection is uncommon\". \"Vaccine effectiveness is expected to be similar in lactating women as in other adults. WHO recommends the use of the COVID-19 vaccine BIBP in lactating women as in other adults,\" it remarked. However, people with a history of anaphylaxis (allergic reaction to venom, food, or medication) to any component of the vaccine should not take it.\n\nALSO READ | Russia okays single-dose Sputnik Light Covid-19 vaccine, has 79.4% efficacy\n\nThe Sinopharm vaccine is to be administered in two doses at an interval of three to four weeks between the first and second doses. If the second dose is administered less than three weeks after the first, the dose does not need to be repeated. While Seychelles is investigating the sudden rise in cases despite intense vaccination drive, there is no available data as to compare the vaccine with other rivals due to different approaches taken in designing the vaccines.\n\nIs India importing Sinopharm vaccine?"
