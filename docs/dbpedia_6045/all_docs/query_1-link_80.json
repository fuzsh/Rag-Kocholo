        "text": "DUBAI (REUTERS) - An experimental coronavirus vaccine developed by China's Sinopharm has 86 per cent efficacy against the virus, the United Arab Emirates health ministry said on Wednesday (Dec 9), citing an interim analysis of late-stage clinical trials.\n\nWhile the positive data comes soon after last month's upbeat results from Western rivals, such as Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca and from Russia, neither the UAE nor Sinopharm have released detailed data from the pivotal study.\n\nIn July, the Gulf Arab state started phase three clinical trials of the vaccine, developed by Beijing Institute of Biological Product, a unit of Sinopharm's China National Biotec Group (CNBG).\n\nIn September, it authorised emergency use of the vaccine for certain groups, the first such international clearance for a vaccine developed in China.\n\nThe analysis also shows \"99 per cent seroconversion rate of neutralising antibody and 100 per cent effectiveness in preventing moderate and severe cases of the disease\", the ministry said in a statement carried by the state news agency.\n\n\"The analysis shows no serious safety concerns,\" it said.\n\nIt also said it had officially registered the vaccine, without elaborating, and that 31,000 volunteers across 125 nationalities participated in the UAE trial.\n\nIt did not say what side effects or illnesses participants experienced or how many volunteers were given the vaccine and how many received a placebo.\n\nCNBG could not be immediately reached for comment.\n\nThe vaccine, which uses an inactivated virus unable to replicate human cells to trigger immune responses, requires two doses, past trial data has showed.\n\nThe UAE trial is a partnership between Sinopharm's CNBG, Abu Dhabi-based artificial intelligence company Group 42 (G42) and the Abu Dhabi Department of Health.\n\nSinopharm and G42 have also expanded the trial to Egypt, Jordan and Bahrain."
