        "text": "In the early seventies we used to joke about Greek films (before ever having seen one), that to make a successful Greek comedy you need several things: A fat woman in a mini-skirt, a man in ladies clothing, a cross-eyed guy who yelled all the time, and a scene in a bouzouki joint. That is because all we knew of Greek movies were the ads in front of the theater that all seemed to show these same things. Greek comedies seemed like Jerry Lewis on acid. Regardless, it was not until I left Greece and was nostalgic for it that I began to go to the Greek Film Festivals that were being held on any campus with a large enough Greek community to support one. Films like Rembetiko, Stella, Glyka Symoria, and others opened my eyes to Greece in a way that being an American and living within the American community couldn't. Greek movies helped me find the Greek in my Greek-American-ness. I have complied a list of films and a description of not only Greek films but also foreign films which take place in Greece which will be helpful for anyone needing a Greek-fix or inspiration.\n\nNever On Sunday\n\nThis 1960 film made Melina Mercouri almost a household name in America and an icon in Greece. It is about a prostitute who lives a life of free-spirited bliss and the American who tries to 'civilize' her and make her miserable like him. Just as in Rembetika and Zorba, Never on Sunday is also aided by a great soundtrack, this by Manos Hadzidakis and the song Children of Pireaus is the most recognized piece of Greek music after the Zorba Dance, and only because that song is played at every baseball game in America. The American in the film is played by Jules Dassin who directed it as well. This is also in black and white and creates a nostalgia in me of a Greece I barely glimpsed before it was swept away by western culture. It won the Academy Award for Best Song (Manos Hadjidakis for \"Never on Sunday\"). It was nominated for the Academy Awards for Best Actress in a Leading Role (Melina Mercouri), Best Costume Design, Black-and-White, Best Director (Jules Dassin) and Best Writing, Story and Screenplay as Written Directly for the Screen (Dassin). Mercouri won the award for Best Actress at the 1960 Cannes Film Festival.\n\nZ\n\nThis movie by one of my favorite directors, Kostas-Gavras, is about the assassination in Thessaloniki of pacifist minister Grigoris Lambrakis in 1963 and the investigation by a courageous prosecutor, Christos Sartzetakis, (who later became President of Greece) that led all the way to the Inspector of the police and other high-ranking officials in the government being indicted. This movie was banned in Greece during the dictatorship as was the soundtrack by Theodorakis. It is in French with English subtitles and though it looks like Greece, was not filmed there. Still it is a great movie. People who have little understanding of Greek politics and probably have not seen the movie seem to think it is about the Greek Junta of 1967 but it actually takes place four years before the dictatorship during the regime of Constantine Karamanlis. The film came out in 1969 based on the book by Vassilis Vassilikos, (which makes great reading by the way). Z is also one of the few films to be nominated for both the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film and Best Picture.\n\nA Touch of Spice (Politiki Kouzina)\n\nThis is the favorite of many Greek-Americans, parituclarly those with their roots in Constantinople (Istanbul). It is a story about a young Greek boy (Fanis) growing up in Constantinople, whose grandfather, a culinary philosopher and mentor,teaches him that both food and life require a little salt to give them flavor; they both require... A Touch of Spice. Fanis grows up to become an excellent cook and uses his cooking skills to spice up the lives of those around him. 35 years later he leaves Athens and travels back to his birthplace of Constantinople to reunite with his grandfather and his first love; he travels back only to realize that he forgot to put a little bit of spice in his own life. - Review written by Anonymous\n\nThe original Greek title is Politiki Kouzina which means Cuisine of the City and refers to the Cuisine of Constantinople. The Turkish title, \"Bir Tutam Baharat\" means \"A Touch of Spice\".\n\nShirley Valentine\n\nThis award-winning 1989 British romantic comedy-drama film Staring Pauline Collins and Tom Conti is based on Willy Russell's 1986 one-character play of the same title. It has inspired several thousand middle-aged British housewives to leave their boring husbands and run away to Greece in search of love in the form of a Greek fisherman or waiter. Worth seeing especially if you are a middle-aged housewife bored with your husband who wants to run away to Greece in search of love and have an attraction to Greek fishermen and waiters, which I guess is just about every housewife in Britain and the USA. The funny thing is that I know a lot of women who did exactly what the woman in Shirley Valentine did, and stayed in Greece, and never went back to their husbands and used my website to do it. The success of the film and the play created a cottage industry and who knows what else? A lot of happy waiters and fishermen. They say the movie is based on a real life person in Molyvos whose daughter owns the Captain's Table restaurant.\n\nCaptain Corelli's Mandolin\n\nThey made such a big deal about the making of this war movie in 2001 it seems amazing that it could have been such a dud. Nice scenery and it somewhat follows the script of Louis De Benieres book, which is more worth reading than the movie is worth seeing. But if you want a Greece fix and you can tolerate Nicholas Cage in probably the worst role of his career (maybe) then it is worth watching, at least according to my wife. I saw half of it in the theater and I refuse to watch it again until they remake it, which someone should do, hopefully before I die. Enough time has passed hasn't it? The movie takes place on the beautiful island of Kefalonia and you can visit many of the places they filmed and hear stories from the locals on the making of the film which by now has turned into Greek island folklore and will probably be passed down from one generation to the next. Perhaps 500 years from now people will look more kindly on this film.\n\nThe Guns of Navarone\n\nThis 1961 movie is based on Alistair MacLean's 1957 novel The Guns of Navarone, which was inspired by the Battle of Leros during the Dodecanese Campaign of World War II. It stars Gregory Peck, David Niven, and Anthony Quinn plays himself playing Zorba the Greek. It also stars Irini Papas. The story is about a bunch of commandos in the Second World War who team up with some Greek resistance to blow up these guns firing from and impregnable German fortress that have been sinking allied ships and delaying an invasion of Europe, or something like that. I don't think the guns ever existed in case you plan to go to Leros or Pylos, which is actually called Navarino, to find them. But the movie had a cameo in an episode of the Dick Van Dyke show when he gets arrested and his alibi was that he was at the movies seeing The Guns of Navarone, and when they ask him the plot he says he fell asleep and the cops don't believe you can fall asleep during the Guns of Navarone. Not because it was so good but because it was loud. Anyway see the movie. The Dick Van Dyke episode is worth seeing too.\n\nUlysses Gaze\n\nA tedious journey with Harvey Kietel as he searches for the roots of Balkan film. Like all of Theo Angelopoulos' films that I have seen, this one also substitutes speeches and poetry for dialogue and tarries a bit too long to wring meaning out of each shot which turns twenty minutes of plot into three hour marathons of what for anyone but the most devoted film students could be described as unbelievably boring. But they say he is a genius so I keep watching in the hopes I will someday get it. One interesting thing is that the movie used the town of Lavrion as a stand-in for war torn Sarajevo snce they could not film there because the war was still going on. Other films by Angelopoulos are Landscapes In The Mist, The Traveling Players, and Eternity And A Day all the kind of movies that make you feel like getting up and doing something important like washing the dishes. You should read my Review of Weeping Meadows too.\n\nMy Big Fat Greek Wedding\n\nOK. I have to admit that I did not think this movie was all that funny and the fact that so many people did sort of depressed me. The introduction when the camera goes past one house after another until it comes to the one with the columns and the kitchy Greek statues truly made me laugh out loud. But that was the last time I laughed at all. Everything seemed so situation-comedy predictable and the film seemed filled with lost opportunities. I mean with the subject matter they could have made a really funny movie. Most people loved it so maybe there is something wrong with me, but my family is a lot funnier. Well, actually Andrea's family is a lot funnier. My family is not funny at all, at least not in that ethnic way that MBFGW makes fun of. I took my friend to see it in Athens to cheer him up. He had not seen a movie in 12 years and I thought from the reviews that this was a sure thing. It made him even more depressed. A couple years later he died. I don't blame the movie but it was the last film he saw and it was my fault that he saw it so I blame myself. Not for this death. The movie was not that bad. But for the fact that his final movie was not a better one. Shit. Now I am really depressed.\n\nMamma Mia\n\nThis film that takes place mostly on the island of Skopelos with a shot or two of Skiathos, came out in 2008 and was based on the West End/Broadway play of the same name. I was prepared to not like it since the idea of it seemed pretty silly to me with award winning serious actress Meryl Streep and a former James Bond, Pierce Brosnan, dancing and singing to the music of Abba. But I saw it on a flight back to Athens from Paris and the combination of the scenery and the music actually made me cry and long for Greece, even though I was going to be there in an hour and I had only been gone for 4 days. If you love Greece you will love this movie. If you love Abba you will love this movie. If you hate Abba you will love this movie and end up loving Abba. And if you love Meryl Streep (who according to the Human Genome Project is my cousin) then you will absolutely love this movie. If you love Pierce Brosnan? Well nobody loves Pierce Brosnan so it doesn't matter. But Colin Firth is in it too.\n\nAmerica America\n\nThis 1963 American film, directed, produced and written by Elia Kazan, from his own book, had an effect on me before I ever saw it. When I was about eight years old my father told me about the film, I suppose because it told the story of his own father and the hardships he and many other immigrants faced when they left Greece to come to America, though in the case of the film the guy was leaving Asia Minor, (though he was Greek). I remember being so inspired by the story that I turned our garage into a theater, the garage door was the curtain, and the audience; the neighborhood children, sat outside while the performers; my brother and sister and our closest friends, were in the garage which was the stage. I starred and directed in my own eight year old version of America, America. There was no script, just a vague plot and me telling everyone what to say and do. Though it was a step up from lip synching Beatles songs while playing tennis rackets it was the last play I ever directed and except for a small role in an elementary school play, as the March wind (where I ran roaring across the stage dressed as a lion), it was the end of my acting career as well. So since my version of America, America is lost forever the next best thing may be to see the Elia Kazan film since after all it was nominated for best film and best director at the 38th Acadamy Awards.\n\n3 More Greek Films\n\nYou gotta see these Greek movies. If you are not familiar with Greek film you may not like them. You may think they are poorly made, over dramatic, too artsy or pretentious. But if you have ever sat through a movie by Theo Angelopoulos these three will be easy for you. The first is called From the Edge of the City by Constantine Giannaris which was made in 1998 and is about some young immigrant kids, ethnic Greeks from Russia, Albanians etc, who live in Ano Liossia and Menidi on the outskirts of Athens. It is an interesting look at youth and the underworld. Not for you 'Summer Lovers' or 'Shirley Valentine' types who don't want to know about the harsh realities of life in Greece. But for those of us who can take the darkness with the light it is an eye-opener. In the same vein and also by Giannaris is Hostage. This film is about a bus hijacking in northern Greece and focuses on contemporary Greek-Albanian relations among other issues. Both films star Stathis Papadopoulos who is terrific. I think I got these when my local video store finally went out of business and I bought out their entire Greek film collection which was these two and a movie by Angelopoulos (of course).\n\nKynodontas (Dogtooth)\n\nAlso on my must see list is one of the strangest films I have ever seen. It is called Kynodontas (Dogtooth) by Giorgos Lanthimos which I read somewhere is like Leave It To Beaver directed by David Lynch. It is about three young people, two sisters and a brother, brought up in isolation by parents who shelter them from everything. They live in a big modern house surrounded by high walls which they have never been outside of. They have no idea what exists beyond the walls because they have never seen a movie or a television show. (The television set is used only to watch the family's home videos.) Their questions are answered in a way that will keep them from being curious. They don't even know that a telephone is. (They think it is a salt shaker). Any word that comes from beyond their world is assigned a new meaning. So 'the sea' refers to a large armchair and 'zombies' are little yellow flowers. They are told that a cat killed their brother, who they have never seen, so they are terrified of cats. (It reminded me of the countless times I have seen a Greek mother or grandmother scream and snatch her child away before he could pet a cute little kitten or puppy, thus injecting into the child a fear of animals that may last a lifetime). It's pretty extreme stuff but if you want to understand the Greek family in a dark exaggerated way, rent this movie and stay with it even though you may feel compelled to turn it off. That being said this film is not for everybody. You may even get mad at me for recommending it. My first reaction when the film ended was \"What the @#%$ was that?\" By the next morning I felt like I got it. No parents could be this bad, but the parents in Dogtooth are following a self-centered path that may seem familiar to some of us. These kids are not being 'protected'. They are being groomed to take care of the parents when they are too old to take care of themselves. The kids don't have an alternative because beyond the family and the home there is nothing else.\n\nBy the way Dogtooth was nominated for an Oscar as Best Foreign Film, it won Un Certain Regard Award at Cannes, it won the Dublin Film Critics Award and several other awards, so this is not one of those under-the-radar films. You may wonder how it won those awards but after you find yourself thinking about the film for a few days you may understand.\n\nI found most of these films on Netflix.\n\nReturn to Greek Films Index"
