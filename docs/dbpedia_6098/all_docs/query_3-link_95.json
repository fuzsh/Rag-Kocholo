        "text": "Shaping up to be one of the most fruitful director-actor pairings of the last few years, Greek director Yorgos Lanthimos and Emma Stone collaborated for the first time with 2018’s The Favourite. They followed it up with the 30-minute film Bleat, which will finally hit North American shores at the 61st New York Film Festival next month, followed by Poor Things, which Stone also produced and is earning the most acclaim of their respective careers following its Venice and Telluride premieres. For their fourth outing they shot the anthology feature AND last year co-starring Jesse Plemons, Willem Dafoe, Margaret Qualley, Hong Chau, and Joe Alwyn, which will get a release in 2024. Now, a fifth collaboration has been unveiled.\n\nSpeaking to Cineuropa, Lanthimos revealed he directed a new movie in secret, this time returning to his native land of Greece. Led by Emma Stone and shot by Robbie Ryan (The Favourite, Poor Things), he didn’t reveal much about the untitled project, only that it was “much simpler and very different in comparison to Poor Things because that story needed that particular style.” (And for those thinking it may be misinterpreted he was discussing AND, that film was shot in New Orleans––not Greece.) Here’s hoping we get more details soon on the project, which sounds like a return to a Dogtooth-esque scope, as Poor Things tours the fall festivals ahead of a December release."
