        "text": "Description\n\nFrozen Ambrosia Synopsis\n\nFrozen Ambrosia is a winter adventure film that takes place in Greece. When people think of Greece, few realize that the country has high mountains and a winter season with skiing and snowboarding. Because of this misconception, Greek-American filmmaker Constantine Papanicolaou sets out on an adventure to make a ski film that will show the magic of winter in Greece.\n\nUpon arriving, Constantine befriends a group of locals who become interested in helping him with the project. However, a difficult truth emerges. Due to the economic crisis of 2008, the ski resorts of Greece are in bad condition. For example, many are understaffed and are at risk of closing. Fortunately, a movement has started, called Oreivatiko Ski, or ski mountaineering, where people forego the ski resorts to climb the mountain with their own power. In the end, Constantine perseveres and delivers a film showing that winter in Greece is indeed magical.\n\nPress\n\nGreece-Is: The Director of “Frozen Ambrosia” on Greece’s Mountain Magic\n\nGreek Reporter: Winter Adventures in Greece\n\nOlympus Climbing: Frozen Ambrosia The Movie\n\nKnowledge: Frozen Ambrosia Movie Review\n\nA Winter Adventure in Greece\n\nProtothema: Greece is a Ski Destination too!\n\nFilmed in Greece\n\nFrozen Ambrosia is a film shot entirely in Greece.\n\nLocations: Mount Olympos, Velouchi, Karpenisi, Tymfi, Astraka, Parnassos, Psiloritis, Crete, 3-5 Pigadia, Vasilitsa, Smolikas, Tzoumerka, Dirfys, Evia\n\nFeaturing: Mike Styllas, George Klaoudatos, George Rokas, Dimitris Papakonstantinou, George Ouzounis, Nektarios Kolokythas, Kostas Leloudis, Ilias Zacharakis, Dimitris Batzios, Gerasimos Avramides, Nikos Aggelis, George Seitanidis, Lila Klaoudatou, Yannis Kotileas, Alexandros Panagakos, Dimitris Managas, Athanasios Zapros\n\nWritten, Produced & Directed By: Constantine Papanicolaou\n\nRuntime: 61 Minutes\n\nFormat: 1920X1080 MP4\n\nDialogue: English and Greek\n\nSubtitle Links:\n\nEnglish | Greek | German | Italian | French | Spanish\n\nFrozen Ambrosia Director Bio"
