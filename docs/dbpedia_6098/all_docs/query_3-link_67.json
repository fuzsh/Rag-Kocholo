        "text": "The theatre of Ancient Greece flourished between 550BC and 220BC. A festival honouring the god Dionysus was held in Athens, out of which three dramatic genres emerged: tragedy, comedy and the satyr play.\n\nWestern theatre has its roots in the theatre of Ancient Greece and the plays that originated there.\n\nThis collection features short films about Greek theatre and productions of Greek plays staged at the National Theatre.\n\nAn Introduction to Greek Theatre\n\nThis film explores the defining aspects of Greek theatre. It includes performance footage from the 2012 National Theatre production of Antigone, directed by Polly Findlay, starring Christopher Eccleston as Creon and Jodie Whittaker in the title role.\n\nFeatured are experts Edith Hall, professor of Classics at Kings College, London; Laura Swift from the Open University; Dr Sean McElvoy from Varndean College, Brighton; and actor Michael Grady-Hall from the cast of the National Theatre’s 2012 production of Antigone.\n\nModern Interpretations of Greek Chorus\n\nThis film examines the role of the chorus, a defining aspect of the plays that emerged between 500BC and 220BC.\n\nDr Lucy Jackson, Teaching Fellow at King’s College London and Knowledge Exchange Fellow at the Oxford Research Centre in the Humanities (TORCH) looks back over some of the recent Greek productions at the National Theatre, and their portrayal of the collective voice of the chorus. Featuring directors Katie Mitchell, Carrie Cracknell, Polly Findlay and actor Helen McCrory.\n\nWomen in Greek Theatre\n\nThis film explores the role of women in Ancient Greek society and the representation of female identity in Antigone, Women of Troy and Medea.\n\nDr Lucy Jackson, Teaching Fellow at King’s College London and Knowledge Exchange Fellow at the Oxford Research Centre in the Humanities (TORCH) looks back over these recent Greek productions at the National Theatre, featuring Helen McCrory and Jodie Whittaker.\n\nAntigone: Family VS State\n\nThis film looks at a central conflict within the play of Antigone; Creon’s belief in the state weighed against the actions of his family.\n\nThis video features interviews with actors Christopher Eccleston, Polly Findlay and Jodie Whittaker and includes archive footage from the 2012 production."
