As far back as the 1950’s movies shot in Greece have received praise and accolades and, as you will see in the reviews of these films, consistently excellent reviews too!\n\nThe Lost Daughter\n\nThe Lost Daughter is a multi-award-winning film released in 2022 starring Olivia Coleman and Dakota Fanning and directed by Maggie Gyllenhaal.\n\nIt tells the tale of Leda, a middle-aged divorcee and mother who goes on Vacation in Greece to try and overcome her loneliness and longing. She becomes involved with another family staying nearby and a series of confrontations occur both locally and internally for her.\n\nFilmed on the island of Spetses in the Saronic Gulf the movie was initially supposed to be set in the USA but was relocated due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The movie was nominated for over 100 awards including Oscars, BAFTAs and the Screen Actors Guild.\n\nSpetses is an upmarket island in the Saronic Group of islands, which, like Hydra, is favored by Athenians, many of who have holiday homes there.

Blanc is also mysteriously invited and once there the guests are involved in foul play and subterfuge that only Benoit Blanc can solve, of course. A fun movie to watch in the who-dunnit genre once made famous by Agatha Christie and detective Hercule Poirot.\n\nThe Villa is in fact the stunning Amanzoe resort, of the uber luxe Aman group of hotels, which thankfully does not usually have a giant glass onion on top of it.\n\nOther scenes are shot in front of the famous Poseidonion Grand Hotel that has been welcoming visitors since 1914.\n\nFurther reading: A Complete Guide to Spetses\n\nZorba the Greek\n\nPossibly the most famous Greek movie of all as it also made famous the song and dance of the same name.\n\nFilmed in 1964 in Crete, starring Anthony Quinn, the movie also earnt 3 Oscars.\n\nThe story is about an English writer who arrives in Crete to inspect his father’s abandoned mine ( you can still see where this was shot in Stavros Bay).

The local villages are quite authentic and charming and we highly recommend staying at least overnight to truly appreciate this very special destination.\n\nFurther reading: A Complete Guide to Meteora\n\nBeckett\n\nBeckett is an action thriller filmed in and around Athens and was released in 2021.\n\nThe premise of the story is about an American tourist, John Washington, who has a terrible accident and is forced to run for his life in an attempt to get to the American Embassy to clear his name.\n\nThe story is set during a time of political unrest and there are twists and turns as he gets more tangled up in a deep web of conspiracy.\n\nIt’s worth watching but many people feel it could have done a better job of showcasing the capital in amongst all the car-chases and intrigue.\n\nFurther reading: Top Things to do in Athens"
