        "text": "What’s better than holidays that feel like a movie, playing out on cinematic beaches and stunning natural wonders? In Greece, you’ll have the chance to visit the filming locations of many beloved movies and TV shows that showcase the country’s diverse and picturesque beauty.\n\nDiscover some of the most popular movies and TV shows taking place in Greece and find out more about their filming locations! Choose your next destination and book ferry tickets online on Ferryhopper.\n\nStrolling around the quaint streets of Plaka in Athens\n\nPopular movies and TV shows filmed in Greece\n\nGreece offers a harmonious mix of natural beauty, romantic settings and some more urban landscapes. Its capital, Athens, weaves all these elements together, which is why you can find both comedic and thrilling productions here.\n\nFrom the finale of the comedic series The Good Place to the eerie movie Crimes of the Future, Athens is a great starting point for cinematic holidays before resuming your adventures on the Greek islands. Continue reading to discover our favorite TV shows and movies filmed in Greece, along with their respective filming locations.\n\nSpetses: The Lost Daughter & Glass Onion\n\nHow can a Greek island combine a family vacation gone wrong with a twisty crime mystery? The answer lies within the cosmopolitan and sophisticated beauty of Spetses, part of the Saronic Islands.\n\nThe heartfelt movie The Lost Daughter highlights numerous parts of Spetses’ coastline, with the beach of Zogeria in particular reigning supreme. Split into two parts, the smaller segment of the beach is heavily featured in The Lost Daughter. There, you can find a small tavern and countless opportunities for relaxation.\n\nGlass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery, on the other hand, turns the spotlight on the most elegant and grandiose hotel of the Spetses. Poseidonion Grand Hotel is a must-visit attraction in its own right and the perfect backdrop for some of the most memorable scenes in Glass Onion. You can also catch glimpses of Dapia, the main port of Spetses.\n\nTip: other scenes from Glass Onion were filmed in a different yet neighboring location: Kranidi, a beautiful town in the Peloponnese.\n\nPoseidonion Grand Hotel, the architectural wonder of Spetses\n\nSkopelos & Skiathos: Mamma Mia\n\nYou were most likely expecting this entry, but what good is a list of movies in Greece without Mamma Mia? This timeless comfort movie takes place mainly on 2 Greek islands: Skopelos and Skiathos.\n\nIn Skopelos, the iconic wedding scene of Mamma Mia, along with Meryl Streep’s cover of “The Winner Takes It All\", plays out at the Church of Agios Ioannis. It is rather popular among tourists, offering breathtaking views. Skopelos is also home to the beaches of Amarandos and Glysteri, which are featured in the movie.\n\nThen we have the lively and energetic island of Skiathos. The island’s old port is included in Mamma Mia, where the three male leads are gathered as they wait for their boat.\n\nTip: in Mamma Mia, you can also witness the mainland beauty of Damouchari and its port, located in Pelion. The area is rather close to the port of Volos, where you can catch a ferry to Skopelos and Skiathos.\n\nCorfu: The Durrells\n\nStorytellers have a thing for the Greek islands. Gerald Durrell, for example, had his eyes on the beautiful island of Corfu in the Ionian Sea.\n\nThe loosely biographical TV show The Durrells takes place in Corfu and showcases several locations that are tied to the writer’s life on the island. Key examples include Corfu Town, Agni Bay and the village of Agios Stefanos.\n\nThe White House, which was owned by the Durrell family and is now open to the public, is located in Kalami, a beautiful seaside village. Thanks to its historical importance and beautiful scenery, it also makes for a great day trip.\n\nTranquil moments in Kalami, Corfu\n\nHydra: Daisy Jones & The Six\n\nThe new mini-series Daisy Jones & The Six takes you on an exciting musical adventure. Based on the book of the same name, its melody unfolds from Los Angeles and New Orleans to the Greek island of Hydra (in the 7th episode).\n\nIn just 1.5-2 hours, you can take the ferry from Athens to Hydra and relive the seaside adventures of the fictional ‘70s band. The island of Hydra, with its quaint port, serene alleys and beautiful coastal paths, is an untouched wonder with a strong cultural identity.\n\nThe sophisticated port and center of Hydra\n\nEvia: Triangle of Sadness\n\nThe unforgettable cinematic ride that is the Triangle of Sadness includes numerous scenes on the beach of Chiliadou, located in Evia (or Euboea). Located between the ports of Mantoudi and Kymi, the clothing-optional beach of Chiliadou won the EUFCN Location Award in 2022.\n\nIts deep seabed, strong waves and rather long stretch make it a fantastic filming destination and a great spot for thrill-seekers and naturists.\n\nPaxi & Corfu: Maestro in Blue\n\nLast but not least, the Greek series Maestro in Blue seduced the world with its beautiful scenery and seaside views. Filmed primarily on the Ionian Islands of Corfu and Paxi, Maestro in Blue reached the global top 10 of the most-watched shows on Netflix.\n\nOn the island of Paxi, most scenes were filmed in the island’s main town, Gaios, as well as the village of Lakka. In Corfu, on the other hand, Maestro in Blue features many of the island’s cultural and historical highlights, including the Museum of Asian Art, Saint Spyridon Church and Plous Bookshop. Once again, Corfu Town, with its breathtaking atmosphere, steals the scene!\n\nTip: to see multiple islands at once, consider planning an island-hopping trip from Paxi!\n\nMajestic waters and dense greenery on the island of Paxi\n\nBook ferry tickets to Greece’s filming locations"
