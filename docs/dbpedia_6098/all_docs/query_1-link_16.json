        "text": "The Athens Centre would like to invite you\n\nto its Film Nights evening,\n\non Thursday, October 20\n\nat 6:00pm\n\nfor the projection of the movie\n\n“My life in ruins”\n\nMy Life in Ruins (UK title: Driving Aphrodite) is a 2009 romantic comedy film set amongst the ruins of ancient Greece, starring Nia Vardalos, Richard Dreyfuss, Alexis Georgoulis, Rachel Dratch, Harland Williams and British comedy actor and impressionist Alistair McGowan. The film is about a tour guide whose life takes a personal detour, while her group gets entangled in comic situations among the ruins, with a series of unexpect stops along the way. The film was released on June 5, 2009 in the United States and May 7, 2009 in Greece.\n\nGeorgia (Nia Vardalos) is a Greek American tour guide who is leading a tour around Greece with an assorted group of misfit tourists who would rather buy a T-shirt than learn about history and culture. In a clash of personalities and cultures, everything seems to go wrong, until one day when an older traveler named Irv Gordon (Richard Dreyfuss), shows her how to have fun, and to take a good look at the last person she would ever expect to find love with, her Greek bus driver (Alexis Georgoulis).\n\nThis event is open and free to the public."
