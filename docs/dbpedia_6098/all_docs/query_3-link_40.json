        "text": "Mamma Mia! Trip to Greece: Visit the locations\n\nThe Complete Guide to the Movie’s “Mamma Mia! The Movie” Locations\n\nGreece has always been a compelling country attracting all types of travelers from across the globe. Yet, recently, the amazing movie Mamma Mia! has increased everyone’s interest and admiration to an even higher altitude. But more than the movie itself, everyone fell in love with the extraordinary landscapes of Greece.\n\nDid you know that Mamma Mia! The Movie was filmed in Greece, however, Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again was filmed in Croatia?\n\nWhere was Mamma Mia filmed? Where is the island of Kalokairi?\n\nThe beautiful island of Kalokairi indeed stole the fans’ hearts. But one would wonder whether the stunning island exists. The answer is yes and no. There is no island called Kalokairi. However, the locations in the movie are not imaginary. They exist and welcome millions of travellers yearly. Nonetheless, there is still a way to experience its beauty and carefree lifestyle featured in the movie.\n\nThe primary location for Mamma Mia! is on the island of Skopelos, with some scenes shot also on the island of Skiathos. Both Skopelos and Skiathos are part of the Sporades islands.\n\nThere is also a third location, the seaside village of Damouchari in Pelion, where Mamma Mia! was shot.\n\nIf we go by the film’s storyline and locations, Skopelos is the fictional island of Kalokairi. Most outdoor scenes of beautiful beaches with crystal clear azure waters and incredible mountainous landscapes and cliffs were at Skopelos.\n\nOut of the three places where Mamma Mia was shot, Skopelos is the one where most of the outdoor scenes were shot. There is a rumour that the producers visited 21 Greek islands before they chose Skopelos.\n\nAccording to SEEN-IT, you can find below most of the locations where Mamma Mia! The Movie was shot.\n\nSkopelos\n\nWhich beaches were used for Mamma Mia? Visit Kastani Beach\n\nThere are several locations with starring roles in the movie, one of which is the gorgeous sandy Kastani Beach, with its stunning scenery and crystal clear waters. This is the beach that the producers of Mamma Mia! chose for the scene where Tanya sang the “Does your mother know?” song. Also, this is where Sky and Sophie sing “Lay all your love on me” and Donna and the three dads sing “I have a dream”. There is a beach bar, however, it is not the one that is featured in the musical. There is also no wooden pier as it was added just for the movie.\n\nCape Amarantos is also featured in the film as the place where Sophie and her three dads jump into the water during the song “Our Last Summer”.\n\nWhere is the church from Mamma Mia? Visit Agios Ioannis Kastri\n\nThe picturesque church in the movie is real and open to everyone. The church is the beautiful tiny church of Agios Ioannis Kastri in the northern area of Skopelos island. The church is perched on the top of a rock, 100 meters above sea level, gazing at the magnificent Mediterranean Sea, Skopelos’ coasts, and the nearby island Alonissos. Agios Ioannis Kastri is featured at the end of the movie as this is the place where Sophie wants to get married.\n\nAt Agios Ioannis is the location where Donna is talking with Sam on the stairs of the chapel, where the wedding takes place. This is the place where Donna sings ‘The Winner Takes It All’ to Sam.\n\nIf you are looking for a Mamma Mia family tour in Greece, make sure to have a look at our fully customizable “The Mamma Mia Greece Family Tour“.\n\nThe church’s name in English is translated into Saint John on the castle. Therefore, it is possible that once upon a time, there was a castle on the very same rock that was used as a fort and protection against pirates. You need to climb 199 steps to reach the church, and right beneath the rock, there is a little beach.\n\nOther places featured in the movie: In Glysteri Bay, Amanda reads Donna’s diary to her friends.\n\nSing and dance your way through Greece on the Mamma Mia Family Tour! Explore movie spots, soak up the sun, and create memories that will last a lifetime.\n\nSkiathos\n\nOld Port of Skiathos\n\nSkiathos is the only island in Sporades that has an airport. If you would like to check out the locations of Mamma Mia!, the easiest way is to fly to Skiathos and then visit Skopelos.\n\nIn Skiathos, you will find the Old Port, where the three fathers of Sophie meet for the first time. In the Old, Port is where Sam and Harry miss the ferry that can take them to the wedding. Then they meet Bill who has a sailing boat.\n\nDamouchari Pelion\n\nDamouchari is a port in Pelion that was featured in Mamma Mia! According to the website of the village, in September 2008, all inhabitants of Damouchari became extras in the film. There are several dancing scenes with Merril Streep, including when Donna and her friends jump into the water during the song Dancing Queen.\n\nDoes Villa Donna, the hotel from Mamma Mia, exist?\n\nUnfortunately, the hotel Villa Donna is not real, much like Kalokairi Island. That said, Villa Donna’ is supposedly above Glysteri Beach in Skopelos.\n\nHowever, there are plenty of outstanding hotels on both Skopelos and Skiathos for Mamma Mia’s lovers to enjoy and feel like part of the cast. Moreover, if you desire to follow the movie’s and the actor’s footsteps, you could always stay at the hotels the cast stayed at during the filming.\n\nContact our team and we will help you plan the most memorable Mamma Mia family trip in Greece.\n\nAt Skiathos, these hotels are the Skiathos Princess Hotel, the Skiathos Palace Hotel, and the Mandraki.\n\nAt Skopelos, the Skopelos Village Hotel, the Prince Stafylos Hotel, the Adrina Hotel, and the Aeolia Hotel. Another alternative is renting a villa to experience the traditional Greek style of architecture, decor, and lifestyle, in the same way as we see it in the musical.\n\nHow can you get to Skiathos and Skopelos?\n\nBy plane\n\nThe easiest way to reach both islands is by flying from Athens to Skiathos airport. The flight is only about twenty minutes. From there, Skopelos Island is very accessible by using a ferry from Skiathos port (approximately 30 min by fast ferry).\n\nBy boat\n\nYou can catch a ferry to Skiathos and Skopelos from 4 ports in mainland Greece: Volos, Mantoudi, Agios Konstantinos, and Thessaloniki. The best and fastest way to reach the island is to travel from the port of Volos as there is a high-speed vessel.\n\nVolos to Skiathos by ferry\n\nAnes Ferries: 2 h 45 min, Blue Star Ferries: 2 h 25 min, Aegean Flying Dolphins: 1 h 25 min\n\nVolos to Skopelos by ferry\n\nAnes Ferries: 3 1/2 hours, Blue Star Ferries: 2 h 40 min, Aegean Flying Dolphins: 1 h 55 min\n\nTo check the timetable and purchase your tickets, click here: FERRYHOPPER\n\nFrom Athens to Volos by car\n\nIn your vehicle, it is around 3 h 45 min.
