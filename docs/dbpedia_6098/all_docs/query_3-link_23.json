Greece, of course, is identified abroad with the sun, the sea, the Greek lifestyle, the excitement, the good food and the hospitality of the locals. All the above refer to the Greek islands, which since the 60’s have begun to be used as a space in which important international cinema films have evolved, which owe their authenticity, success, and recognition to the Mediterranean landscapes.
