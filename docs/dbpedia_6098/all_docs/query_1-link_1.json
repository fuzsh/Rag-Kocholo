        "text": "Saturday, May 19: Tonight, to get in the mindset for my upcoming trip to Greece, I watch a pretty bad movie, My Life in Ruins. This is a 2009 romantic comedy set among the ruins of ancient Greece. Nia Vardalos (of My Big Fat Greek Wedding fame) stars as Georgia, a laid-off American professor of classical Greek history who is now working as a tour guide. She fashions her tours in the form of a university classroom, trying to teach her group of vagabonds about the history of Greece she finds so fascinating. However, this uneducated bunch of misfits has no interest in learning anything. It seems they just want to eat ice cream, shop for tacky souvenirs, get their picture taken in hokey poses, and buy T-shirts.\n\nAccording to Wikipedia, the film is set on location in Greece and Alicante, in Spain, as well as Guadalest and Javea. This was the first time that an American film studio was allowed to film on location at the Acropolis; the Greek government gave the studio its approval after Vardalos sought permission to film several scenes there.Other Greek filming locations include Olympia, Delphi and Epidaurus.\n\nThe scenery of Greece and its classical architecture is frankly the only reason I find this movie at all appealing.\n\nThe cast of characters, though meant to be misfits, are so obnoxious I can hardly stand them. Vardalos as Georgia is endearing, but the other characters are mainly one-dimensional bad stereotypes of Americans, Australians, and Brits.\n\nIn a clash of personalities and cultures, everything seems to go wrong until the day when older traveler Irv Gideon, played by Richard Dreyfuss, shows Georgia how to have fun, and to take a good look at the last person she would ever expect to find love with, her Greek bus driver Prokopi Kakas, played by Alexis Georgoulis.\n\nThe characters in this movie get on my nerves big time. The saving grace is that I get to see some of the beautiful places in Greece I hope to see in person this Septemberâ€¦ ðŸ™‚"
