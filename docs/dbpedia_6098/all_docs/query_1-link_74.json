        "text": "\"My Life in Ruins\" is held together entirely by worn-out clichés and all-too-familiar stereotypes. Every beat is predictable and unsurprising. There's not an original moment in the film.\n\nSo why did I still leave smiling?\n\nWell, there's some fun here amid the rubble.\n\nGeorgia (Nia Vardalos) used to teach Greek history in Athens, but cutbacks at the university forced her to take a job with a local tour company, shepherding thankless tourists across the Greek countryside.\n\nAn American-Greek who moved to her family's homeland to find herself, Georgia has instead found only misery. Georgia's co-workers regard her as stuffy and aloof, and her groups - who'd rather raid kitsch-souvenir shops and eat ice cream than learn anything interesting - find her presentations dry and boring.\n\nWhile the locals insist she has lost her kefi (Greek for \"mojo\"), Georgia is fed up with their laissez-faire attitude toward life. \"Greece: the birthplace of art, democracy and philosophy. Then they discovered the nap.\"\n\nFriendless, loveless and at her wits' end with yet another ragtag group of boorish foreign visitors, a dilapidated bus and a driver (Alexis Georgoulis) who bears a shocking resemblance to Charles Manson, Georgia decides to pack up and head home.\n\nBut she has no idea that her life is about to change.\n\nThanks to the gentle prodding by one of her charges, a feisty widower named Irv (Richard Dreyfuss), Georgia begins to open her eyes to a more balanced life just as she manages to open the eyes of her group to the exotic and historical wonders of her sun-soaked homeland.\n\n\"My Life in Ruins\" comes close to being a movie in ruins.\n\nThe film, which works better as parts than it does as a whole, discards any shred of reality for pure cotton candy wish fulfillment.\n\nIt would be a laughable television sitcom, let alone a vehicle for the silver screen.\n\nDirector Donald Petrie (\"Miss Congeniality,\" \"How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days\") isn't exactly known for his cutting-edge, inventive, original fare.\n\nInstead, he is exceptionally talented at making utterly formulaic romantic comedies, an aptitude he proves yet again with \"My Life in Ruins.\"\n\nHe has no real talent behind the camera - if his shots dazzle us, it is merely because it's difficult to point a camera anywhere in Greece without its gaze falling on something exquisite.\n\nBut Petrie does have a couple of secret weapons in Vardalos and Dreyfuss. Vardalos brings much of the same sort of adorable appeal as she did in her breakthrough indie stunner, \"My Big Fat Greek Wedding.\"\n\nAnd Dreyfuss steals the show as a cheeky prankster with a warm heart and kind soul.\n\nTogether, the pair distract us from how manufactured, forced and reliant on national stereotypes and cultural clichés the film is.\n\nBarely.\n\nMy Life in Ruins\n\nCast: Nia Vardalos, Richard Dreyfuss, Rachel Dratch, Harland WilliamsDirector: Donald PetrieTheater: TinseltownRating: PG-13 (for sexual content)Running time: 1 hour, 33 minutes\n\nGRADE: C"
