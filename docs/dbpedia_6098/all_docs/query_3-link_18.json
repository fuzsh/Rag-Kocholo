It’s just the perfect marketing!\n\nIt is also a great way for the viewer to gain insights into a country. Apart from the beautiful images of the Greek islands, the Greek cities, and the Greek mountains a lot of the movies that I have listed in this post, are a window into Greek culture.\n\nBy watching these movies, you will quickly understand why the Greek islands are so popular, why people across the globe fall in love with the mesmerizing Aegean Sea, and why Athens is one of the most-visited cities in Europe.\n\nHowever, apart from appreciating the beauty of Greece, you will also appreciate Greek culture. And I’m not so much referring to Greek culture as this is taught in schools through the lens of Greek mythology and the history of Ancient Greece.\n\nMostly, some of these movies offer you an insight into the notion of Greek hospitality, and the value of family and friendship in Greek culture.\n\nSo grab your remote, your popcorn, and your….credit card because trust me, you’re gonna wanna book that flight and visit us, after watching these movies that are set in gorgeous Greece.\n\nBest Movies Set in Greece -Thrillers & Action\n\nThe Guns of Navarone (1961)\n\nStarring: Gregory Peck, David Niven and Anthony Quinn.\n\nGenre: Adventure War Drama\n\nFilming locations in Greece: The island of Rhodes.\n\nPlot: It is 1943 and Europe is battered by the Second World War.

Lara Croft’s mission is to find the infamous box before it falls into the hands of mad Nobel scientist Dr. Jonathan Rice.\n\nFun fact: I guess this is not so much a fact.

Their competitiveness will lead them to situations beyond human ability. This classic French film has breathtakingly beautiful underwater scenes that are hard to forget. It is honestly one of my favorite movies set in Greece simply because of how beautifully it depicts the blueness of the Aegean sea.\n\nFun fact: If you are ever lucky enough to visit the beautiful Greek island of Amorgos, you will notice that there are many French tourists, which is to a very large extent due to this film.\n\nAvailable to watch: Amazon Prime\n\nCaptain Corelli’s Mandolin (2001)\n\nStarring: Penelope Cruz and Nicolas Cage.\n\nGenre: War film\n\nFilming locations in Greece: The island of Kefalonia.\n\nPlot: The movie is set in World War II Greece.

Firstly, the house that Jesse and Celine stay at was actually Patrick Leigh Fermor’s house, and it is absolutely stunning.
