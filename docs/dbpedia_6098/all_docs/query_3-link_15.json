        "text": "Two Tickets to Greece by Marc Fitoussi (2023)\n\nWelcome to the Cyclades, where two childhood friends who have nothing in common, Magalie (Laure Calamy) and Blandine (Olivia Côte), decide to meet up. On board the Greek Blue Star ferry, you sail with them to Katapola, then, because at one time they worshipped The Big Blue, the adventure continues in Amorgos. A real holiday film!\n\nMamma Mia! by Phyllida Lloyd (2008)\n\nThis is the most famous musical shot in Greece. On the fictional island of Kalokairi, Donna Sheridan (Meryl Streep) invites you to the wedding of her daughter Sophie (Amanda Seyfried). The shoot took place in the Sporades, on the islands of Skiathos and Skopelos. Kastani Beach also features heavily, but it’s the small chapel of Agios Ioannis that steals the show. Perched on a rocky promontory, it is the setting for the wedding scene.\n\nCaptain Corelli’s Mandolin by John Madden (2001)\n\nInspired by Louis de Bernières’ novel, the film was shot on the coastline of Kefalonia in the Ionian Islands. This impossible love story between a young Greek woman (Penelope Cruz) and an Italian officer (Nicolas Cage) takes place during the Second World War. It is an opportunity to admire the beaches of Antisamos, Argostóli and Fiskardo, which are just as stunning in real life as on the screen.\n\nJupiter’s Thigh by Philippe de Broca (1980)\n\nWhile travelling in Greece, Lise (Annie Girardot) and Antoine (Philippe Noiret) meet an archaeologist who has just discovered a precious fragment of a statue. But then this fragment is stolen and our heroes roam the country in pursuit of it. The film takes you on a journey to Athens, the Meteora, Boeotia, and above all the Ionian seaside, in Párga, then Pélekas and Sidari on the island of Corfu. A cult comedy!\n\nZorba the Greek by Michael Cacoyannis (1964)"
