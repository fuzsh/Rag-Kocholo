        "text": "If you’re a fan of murder mysteries and picturesque settings, Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery is a must-watch. Starring Daniel Craig as Detective Benoit Blanc, the movie revolves around a reunion that takes a dark turn when one of the guests is found dead. The stunning filming locations are one of the most impressive aspects of the movie, with most of the scenes shot in Greece and Serbia. In this blog post, we will take a closer look at the breathtaking filming locations of Glass Onion.\n\nGovernor Claire Debella’s mansion\n\nThe opening sequence of the movie was filmed in a magnificent seven-bedroom mansion located in the Sterling Ridge neighborhood of Harrison, NY. Built in 1940, the house boasts approximately 9,000 square feet of space and has an estimated market value of six million dollars.\n\nSterling Ridge is an affluent residential neighborhood located in Harrison, a town in Westchester County, It is known for its large and luxurious homes set on spacious lots. Sterling Ridge is a gated community, offering residents privacy and security, and features beautiful landscaping and well-maintained roads. The neighborhood is home to a diverse group of people, including successful business executives, entrepreneurs, and celebrities, who appreciate the peaceful and serene atmosphere of the area, as well as its proximity to the city.\n\nGlass Onion Island\n\nThe stunning harbor of Spetses Island in Greece served as the meeting point for the hosts before they headed to Miles’ private island retreat. Spetses is a small and charming island in the Aegean Sea near the Peloponnese peninsula with only about 4,000 inhabitants.\n\nKnown for its picturesque beauty, Spetses offers stunning beaches, crystal clear waters, and a charming old town. The island is also steeped in history, having played an important role in the Greek War of Independence. Visitors can explore the island’s rich history by visiting the Bouboulina Museum, dedicated to the life of one of the most prominent female figures of the war. With its laid-back atmosphere, stunning scenery, and cultural attractions, Spetses is a perfect destination for those looking for an authentic Greek island experience.\n\nPoseidonion Grand Hotel\n\nThe background of Spetses harbor features the five-star Poseidonion Grand Hotel, which also appears in a scene of The Lost Daughter, a Netflix film set on another Greek island, Kyopeli.\n\nAquarius Yacht\n\nThe production team rented a 150-feet superyacht equipped with a jacuzzi and five staterooms for the scenes where the hosts were brought to the island. You can rent the luxurious yacht for around US$230,000 per week.\n\nThe Aquarius superyacht is a magnificent vessel owned by Steve Wynn, the American billionaire businessman and art collector. Built by Feadship, this 92-meter luxury yacht features sleek lines and an elegant exterior design by Sinot Yacht Architecture & Design. With its six decks, a jacuzzi, a gym, and a cinema, among other amenities, the Aquarius offers its guests the ultimate experience of luxury and comfort. Its lavish interior was also designed by Sinot and features opulent materials and finishes, creating a timeless and sophisticated ambiance.\n\nPisceshite Island\n\nMiles’ villa is situated on the fictional Pisceshite Island on the Jonic Sea. However, the house was digitally added to the landscape at Korakia Beach in the Kranidi area. Korakia beach is located in the eastern section of the Peloponnese peninsula, near the chic village of Porto Heli.\n\nGlass Onion House\n\nMiles Bron’s tech house, featured in the movie, was partially filmed at Villa 20, a massive mansion at Amanzoe Resort in Greece. The luxurious complex features six pools, a spa, and everything else you would expect from a dream home. The layout is distributed around the monumental central staircase on different levels, with studio bedrooms for 18 guests opening onto private terraces. Although the cost of renting the entire villa is unknown, booking one of the impressive suites at this resort costs around USD$2,000 per night.\n\nGlass Onion Location\n\nThe futuristic dome and the main hall of the house, where a lot of action takes place, were built on sets at the studios in Belgrade, Serbia. According to Conde Nast Traveler, the cast and crew spent seven weeks in Belgrade, while the shoot in Greece took about four weeks.\n\n770 Park Avenue New York\n\nThe exterior of Benoit Blanc’s penthouse in the movie is a CGI composition inspired by the terrace of one of the top apartments at 770 Park Avenue in New York.\n\nThe building was designed by the Italian-American architect Rosario Candela in 1930 and is a masterpiece of Renaissance-style architecture. The real two-bedroom penthouse has an estimated market price of sixteen million dollars.\n\nThe Sonora at 770 Park Avenue is a 22-story Art Deco-style residential building located in the prestigious Upper East Side neighborhood of Manhattan in New York City. The building features a striking limestone façade with intricate decorative detailing and setbacks, typical of the era’s architectural style. The luxurious apartments offer high ceilings, large windows, and spacious layouts. The Sonora offers various amenities, including a 24-hour doorman, concierge, fitness center, and storage rooms. The building is also conveniently located near Central Park and the upscale shops and restaurants along Madison Avenue.\n\nIn conclusion, visiting filming locations can be a unique and exciting way to experience your favorite movies and TV shows: it can be your favorite movie or for example location from Street Outlaws. The Glass Onion filming locations, in particular, offer a glimpse into the world of this critically acclaimed series. From the bustling streets of New York to the luxurious Amanzoe Resort, exploring these locations can bring the movie to life in a whole new way. So next time you find yourself watching Glass Onion, consider taking a trip to one of its filming locations to truly immerse yourself in the story.\n\nAre you a movie fan? Do you like the aesthetic of cinematic architecture? If you also like these buildings with different styles, you can customize their appearance into unique Custom Pins and DIY them into decorations, which can not only become permanent collections, but also show your unique taste."
