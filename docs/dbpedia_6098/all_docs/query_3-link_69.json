        "text": "Apart from being a popular travel destination, Greece is also attractive to filmmakers. With sparkling deep blue seas, unique landscapes, and sunny sky, the land of mystical mythology is one of the best places for many film producers to shot memorable films. The glimpses offered in these films, demonstrate the beauty of Greece’s geography and culture. Ancient ruins and sunny skies offering beautiful natural light, have been attracting producers since the late 1950s. Some of the films took bits and pieces of the Greek islands and villages, others stayed true to their locations and portrayed the country’s beauty as it is and as you will discover it on your travels. The first Hollywood movie shot in Greece was the “Boy on a Dolphin” starring Sophia Loren and Alan Ladd. In the years that followed, Greece was the backdrop for dozens other famous films. From Michael Cacoyannis’s famed Zorba the Greek, to the beachy musical Mamma Mia, these are our favorite movies that will transport you to Greece form the comfort of your living room."
