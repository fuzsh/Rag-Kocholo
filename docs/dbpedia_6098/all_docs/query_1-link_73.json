(And see our similar lists for elsewhere in Europe.)\n\nBooks: Nonfiction\n\nAlexander the Great (Paul Anthony Cartledge, 2004). Alexander's legacy comes to life in this engaging history.\n\nApology (Plato, 390 BC). This is a classic for a reason, opening up a window into the Greek mind and soul.\n\nThe Cambridge Illustrated History of Ancient Greece (Paul Anthony Cartledge, 1997). Offered in large format, Cartledge's history is packed with gorgeous illustrations.\n\nColossus of Maroussi (Henry Miller, 1941). Miller tells a sometimes graphic account of his down-and-out sojourn in Greece in the late 1930s.\n\nA Concise History of Greece (Richard Clogg, 1986). For an overview of the 18th century to modern times, this history is surprisingly succinct.\n\nDinner with Persephone (Patricia Storace, 1996). This book is more than a memoir about living in Athens — it's one writer's critical look at modern Greek culture and family life.\n\nEleni (Nicholas Gage, 1983). Gage tells the riveting account of his quest to uncover the truth behind his mother's assassination during Greece's civil war.\n\nThe Greeks (H. D. F. Kitto, 1951).
