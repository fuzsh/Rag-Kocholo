Kho Guik Lan in her welcome speech expressed her hope that the drama festival would enable participants to process and use the English language in context, helping them acquire the key skills stated in the new educational system SPN 21. “A drama will enable students to explore and experience the many facts of the performing arts. The preparation, staging, interaction with the cast and other participants from other schools create great excitement and meaningful experience which can deepen their passion for drama,” she concluded.\n\nThe head of English department Mdm. Gemanar Cristina highlighted that organising a drama festival in Brunei was a dream come true. “Chung Hwa Middle School, BSB strongly believes in the importance of developing the students’ critical, analytical and social skills and continuously looks into ways of using English Language creatively and an event like this will give the participants and the students in the audience a career path to think about, that will bring great satisfaction to those who decide to pursue it,” she elaborated.\n\n.\n\nMotivational talk for O’ Level Candidates\n\nFamed lecturer Dr. Ee Ah Meng gave a motivational talk on 25 September 2010 at the lecture hall to tell students his formula for success: determination, discipline and hard work.\n\nOver the course of two hours, Dr. Ee cast lights on how to prepare for public examinations such as O’ Level and PSR. He transformed over 200 students, especially the disadvantaged students from the school and turned them into industrial and aim-orientated candidates through his interesting lectures.\n\nDr. Ee successfully created an atmosphere conducive for learning by using motivational video clips, songs and interactive games. He explained the correlations between future successes to current academic results. “The gist is easy- aim high and you will realize your goal,” he suggested. Through a video clip about the success of a physically-impaired teenager, Nick Vujicic, Dr. Ee talked about ways to transform shortcoming into strength towards excellence.\n\nStudents were enthralled by the educator’s talk. They also learned different tips to make learning easy such as mind maps and found them very inspirational. “After watching the movie, I am definitely ready to face my exams with confidence.

Education is a great profession and therefore all teachers should be passionate in wanting to mould future leaders.\n\n“Only in the spirit of care and love will teachers be able to bring out the best in students. Besides, teachers’ behaviour and approach will affect students by prolonging their learning life and therefore it is of importance for teachers to always motivate students. Furthermore, teachers should not forget their task as a role model for students to emulate,” Mr Liew explained.\n\nTeachers expressed their gratitude to the school for providing meaningful courses during the school holiday, allowing them to further upgrade their professionalism."
