        "text": "School Website\n\nImage Gallery\n\nSchool History\n\nXingnan Primary School was established in 1932 as a Chinese-medium public school with only 10 students. Then known as Sin Nan Public School (å ¬ç«éåå­¦æ ¡), it was housed in a Chinese temple (ç¯å¾å®«ççä¸å¸åº) along Hong Kah Road. Due to an expanding student population, the school shifted to a site at 776 Old Jurong Road in 1939. It remained there until 1986.\n\nDuring the Japanese Occupation, the school was forced to close. After the Second World War, with strong support from the village community leaders and the School Management Committee, the school reopened its doors and expanded its physical facilities as student enrolment rose rapidly. In 1953, the school raised funds to replace the attap roofs with zinc roofs. In 1982, Xingnan Primary School became an English-medium, government-aided school and took in its first batch of Malay pupils. The school relocated to its present site at 5 Jurong West Street 91 in end 1986 and became a full government school two years later.\n\nThe principal then, Mr Lee Chee Hian, rallied community support to petition the government to prevent the school name being changed due to the relocation. Hence, while retaining its name in Chinese characters, the schoolâs English name was changed to the present Xingnan Primary School. In 1989, the school was officially declared open.\n\nIn 2006, the school set up a heritage museum as part of its 75th anniversary celebrations. The school had undergone PRIME in 1999, and completed PERI upgrading with new facilities such as an indoor sports hall, special rooms and a fitness playground in 2014.\n\nOver the years, Xingnan Primary School has built on its long history and rich heritage to provide opportunities for holistic development and lifelong learning.\n\nPrincipals:\n\n- Mr Ong Leng Kim (1932â1934)\n\n- Mr Ong Shi Swee (1935â1935)\n\n- Mr Toh Liang Chuan (1936â1937)\n\n- Mr Chew Bing Ren (1938â1938)\n\n- Mr Tan Wai Peh (1939â1941; 1945â1946)\n\n- Mr Tan Shiuh Teng (1947â1947)\n\n- Mr Lee Shi Ran (1947â1948)\n\n- Mr Yang Boon Chou (1949â1950)\n\n- Mr Lim Jing Leng (1951â1952)\n\n- Mr Tan Leng San (1952â1963)\n\n- Mr Low Boon Kit (1964â1970)\n\n- Mr Lee Chee Hian (1971â1986)\n\n- Mr Ling Ding Ing (1986â1992)\n\n- Mr Leong Chee Kong (1992â1998)\n\n- Mrs Koh Sau Peng (1998â2005)\n\n- Mr Gau Poh Teck (2005â2010)\n\n- Mrs Wee Kwan-Liam (2010â2015)\n\n- Mr Charles Chan (2015â2022)\n\n- Mrs Cindy Ong (2022âPresent)\n\nKey Milestones\n\nÂ Â 1932 Establishment of Xingnan Primary School. 1988 Became full government school. 1989 Official opening of Xingnan Primary School at 5 Jurong West Street 91. 1999 PRIME upgrading of school. 2006 Celebration of 75th anniversary; opening of Heritage Centre. 2012 Celebration of 80th anniversary. 2016 Completion of PERI upgrading. 2017 Celebration of 85th anniversary. 2022 Celebration of 90th Annivesary. Â Â\n\nSchool Motto\n\nFor Country and For School (å«å½ä¸ºæ ¡)\n\nSchool Crest\n\nThe school crest was designed by Ms Peng Huijun, a former student, in 1988. It was designed to link Xingnanâs past with the future. The four red petals symbolise the four official languages taught in the school. The torch is the symbol of the old school, signifying knowledge and enlightenment. The diamond outline, which resembles a mortar board, kindles in the young mind the thought of tertiary education. In 2006, to reflect the change in the primary education system from an eight-year course to a six-year course, the crest was redesigned to include six bands, each indicating a year of study in primary school.Â The phrase, âEstablished 1932â, was also included to remind all students of the schoolâs history and how far it has come.\n\nSchool Song\n\nâ« Listen\n\nOnce a little village school it was\n\nBut today an ultra modern school\n\nAnd we have the best facilities\n\nIn Xingnan Primary School\n\nWe will strive to always do our best\n\nIn our studies and the CCAs\n\nTo be useful loyal citizens\n\nAnd to love our Singapore\n\nWe are proud of Xingnan Primary School\n\nAnd weâre proud of our teachers too\n\nWeâll hold our heads up high\n\nFor country and for school\n\nWe are proud of Xingnan Primary School\n\nAnd weâre proud of our teachers too\n\nWeâll hold our heads up high\n\nFor country and for school"
