        "text": "ABSTRACT\n\nThe transition from traditional classroom learning to online learning during COVID-19 has accelerated the adoption of technology in education. While video lectures (VLs) have been used to minimize disruptions to learning, their effectiveness is generally limited due to a lack of variety, engagement, and ability to elucidate teacher-student thinking. The challenges encountered in the teaching and learning of Chemical Bonding (CB) and Organic Reaction Mechanisms (ORM) have been extensively reported. Many misconceptions arise from limitations of traditional pedagogy that present a limited and sometimes inaccurate picture of the concepts. Students’ lack of motivation to learn stems from their inability to relate concepts to real life. In ORM, students find it difficult to visualize changes at microscopic levels. These struggles often impede their academic progress. With personal learning devices becoming almost ubiquitous among students in Singapore, we posit that it is timely to leverage on the affordances of technology to alleviate the challenges faced by students in these topics. In CB, to make concepts relatable and explicit, we developed blue screen interactive videos and animations which incorporated teacher-led discussions that leveraged on daily life experiences. In ORM, teachers facilitated succinct animations and pop-up quizzes of the arrow pushing processes and the changes in stereochemistry in casual conversation settings. In CB, 52.9% of students (N = 696) enjoyed watching the interactive videos. Many were, however, deterred by the inconvenience imposed by the software. 45.4% responded that the reviewed lecture format was engaging and 37.9% concurred that this format made the concepts more relatable. After learning from this experience, we focused on reducing the issues that arose from the software. In ORM (electrophilic addition), 91.2% students (N = 296) enjoyed the interactive videos, 92.2% found the teacher-led animations and interactive quizzes useful in facilitating their understanding. These results highlight the potential of interactive videos to improve the teaching and learning of challenging concepts in science education. Teachers, with their grasp of content knowledge and pedagogical content knowledge, play a key role in curating the content. It also emphasises the importance of collaboration between teachers and EdTech specialists for accurate and accessible content creation.\n\nABSTRACT\n\nThis research investigates innovative methodologies in curriculum development to address the dynamic landscape of cybersecurity education. The primary focus involves aligning academic cybersecurity programs with industry imperatives, recognizing the rapidly evolving nature of the cybersecurity field. The study advocates for a meticulous curriculum review to ensure that learning outcomes and content harmonize with contemporary industry practices. The overarching objective is to facilitate a seamless transition for students from academic environments to the professional sphere by integrating pertinent industry certifications into the curriculum. A second innovative initiative centers on the integration of auto-graded practical labs. Utilizing cloud-based learning environments, such as the AWS Academy LMS, the research explores the viability of offering students hands-on experiences across diverse cybersecurity domains. This methodology seeks to augment practical skills and proficiency, effectively preparing students for the real-world challenges they are likely to encounter in their future roles within the cybersecurity domain. The third critical component underscores the significance of asynchronous learning through the integration of the LinkedIn Learning platform. The paper proposes the inclusion of LinkedIn Learning courses in the cybersecurity curriculum, providing students with the opportunity to engage in self-paced, modular learning experiences. This approach not only accommodates diverse learning preferences but also furnishes students with tangible certificates of completion, thereby fostering motivation and recognition. The synergy derived from the incorporation of these three components presents a holistic approach to cybersecurity education that is attuned to industry exigencies. This comprehensive strategy enhances practical skills through auto-graded labs and promotes flexible, asynchronous learning using LinkedIn's platform. The paper concludes by underscoring the potential of these strategies to not only bridge the gap between industry and academia in cybersecurity education but also to serve as a model for curriculum development in other disciplines within the realm of technology.\n\nABSTRACT\n\nThis study aims to understand how different facets of SES, namely parents' educational attainment and access to financial resources, jointly contribute to the development of math and reading skills in Singaporean kindergarteners. Math and reading skills were assessed through standardized tests at various time points from Kindergarten 1 to Primary 1. Latent growth curve models were used for data analysis. Results suggest that children from less advantaged SES backgrounds already experience multifaceted developmental disadvantages. The effects of maternal educational attainment are more pronounced than those related to the family's access to financial resources. Children with less educated mothers exhibited poorer math and reading skills upon entering kindergarten. Additionally, these children demonstrated a slower acquisition of reading skills over the kindergarten years. Findings are discussed in terms of how the investigated SES facets differentially contribute to child development. It is suggested that mothers with higher educational attainment are more likely to provide greater verbal input, which to a larger extent contributes to the development of reading skills. However, it is also possible that demographic variables such as increased access to tertiary education for women and the difficulty in disentangling maternal education and age in the Singaporean context (i.e., younger mothers tend to be more educated than those in previous generations) may explain the aforementioned effects. The study underscores the impact of environmental factors on children's academic development well before kindergarten entry. This highlights the importance for parents, practitioners, and policymakers to understand the mechanisms that contribute to SES-related disparities in early childhood.\n\nABSTRACT\n\nAugmentative and alternative communication (AAC) refers to when an individual uses something other than speech to communicate (Speech Pathology Australia, 2023). A large majority of students in Rainbow Centre’s three special education schools require AAC systems to communicate. A 2021 survey of 51 teaching staff showed that teachers had difficulties i) using Aided Language Stimulation (ALS) to facilitate AAC use, ii) knowing which AAC symbols to use for group teaching, and iii) using unfamiliar AAC systems. A pilot project, Hear My Voice, was conducted to implement AAC assessment and intervention with 6- to 7-year-olds (N = 27) at one of the Rainbow Centre schools. The project included i) the use of an AAC system with a standardised layout and symbol set, ii) provision of a trial AAC kit for in-class dynamic AAC assessment, and iii) lessons targeting AAC use which were delivered by teachers in collaboration with speech-and-language therapists. Teacher-reported outcome measures were collected via questionnaires at the start and end of the year; feedback was also gathered at various points in the year. There were positive outcomes from this pilot project in the following areas: i) a more efficient AAC assessment and prescription process, ii) improvements in most students’ language and communication skills (e.g., expressive vocabulary with/without AAC, number of communication functions and communication partners, utterance complexity), iii) increased frequency of ALS by teaching staff, and iv) increased teachers’ confidence in using AAC. Some of the challenges included the need for flexibility and a non-standardised approach to AAC for students with more complex access needs. These results suggested that the use of a standardised AAC language system and trial kit, and close in-class collaboration between teachers and speech-and-language therapists were helpful in supporting better AAC implementation in class.\n\nABSTRACT\n\nImproving Science education in the Philippines is the goal in the establishment of science high schools and special science programs in the country. There are two agencies implementing these in the secondary level-Department of Education and Department of Science and Technology, both different in terms of degree of implementation. With most DOST-science high schools more established in terms of STEM curriculum implementation, it is imperative that it collaborates with the DepEd-attached special curriculum implementing schools to aid in the implementation of its special science programs. Hence, this study determined the needs of Argao National High School in the implementation of its Special Science Program. This study employed mixed research design, utilizing explanatory sequential design. It involves collection first of quantitative data and then followed with collection of qualitative data. There are two research instruments used: Needs Assessment Survey Questionnaire (Quantitative data) and the Focus Group Discussion Questions (Qualitative data). The Needs Assessment Survey Questionnaire was adapted from a study by Dinoy et. al 2020 and TALIS. Teacher-respondents were to determine if the degree of need for the items stated in the questionnaire is: (4) high degree, (3) moderate degree, (2) low degree or (1) no need at all. Furthermore, the questions used for the Focus Group Discussion was based on the results of the quantitative data to elicit further responses from the teacher-respondents. A total of seven (7) teacher-respondents from Argao National High School, teaching in the special science program participated in the study. All respondents were females wherein most of them were 26 years old and above. After the analysis of data, it was found out that there were five areas identified to look into: Special Science Program, Student Development Services, Learning Facilities and Resources, Professional Development and Curriculum. It is concluded that each category varies in terms of extent of need such that a need to address: Learning Facilities and Resources, Professional Development and Student Development Services may be focused due to numerous high to moderate degree level of needs indicated by the teacher-respondents.\n\nABSTRACT\n\nThis poster presentation delves into the successful implementation of assessment wrappers as a pedagogical tool to cultivate motivation and metacognition among Junior College Year 2 Chemistry students. The overarching goal is to promote self-regulated learning and enhance overall academic performance. The assessment wrapper framework integrates a reflective process that empowers students to evaluate their effective efforts, identify areas for conceptual improvement, and strategically plan their next steps for academic enhancement. The pivotal role of teacher feedback following each assessment wrapper submission serves to further encourage self-regulated learning. To assess the impact of this intervention, a combination of students' perception surveys and thorough analysis of their work has been conducted. The findings reveal evidence of improvements in students' self-regulation, specifically in the activation of cognition, heightened motivation, and the development of robust metacognitive skills. Moreover, the positive influence of teacher feedback is underscored as a catalyst for the continued success of assessment wrappers. This feedback not only amplifies motivation but also facilitates deeper levels of metacognition, ultimately contributing to a more enriched learning experience. To refine this approach, intentional coaching with the incorporation of exemplars is proposed. This targeted guidance aims to further empower learners to engage in reflective practices, thereby maximizing the effectiveness of assessment wrappers. In conclusion, this presentation demonstrates the benefits of incorporating assessment wrappers as a means to foster self-regulated learning in the dynamic context of Junior College Year 2 Chemistry. The findings underscore the importance of reflective processes and teacher feedback in cultivating a learning environment that nurtures motivation and metacognition to help students be better self-regulated learners.

The participants are graduate students in educational technology at a research university located in Thailand's central region. Most of them are teachers, who learn to design and develop e-learning for teaching and learning. Since education has been impacted by the emerging technology of AI, teachers and students should be ready to embrace changes. The theoretical framework that shapes this study is constructionism, which states that students learn most effectively when they actively construct or do things. In this study, generative AI tools were used to empower students to construct knowledge by allowing them to create things, such as e-learning and content. Generative AI is a subset of artificial intelligence that can produce novel content i.e. text, images, music, videos, and real-time feedback. Students can use its easy creation tools and others such as automated graders or chatbots to develop their e-learning. The ultimate goal of this study is to gain an understanding of implementing artificial intelligence in teacher education, and how it affects students’ learning to create e-learning and related materials. This qualitative research will gather students’ perceptions by interviewing students after using generative AI as a tool to develop e-learning. The data will be analyzed by using thematic analysis to analyze the common themes of students’ perceptions of using generative AI. The research questions are: (1) How do students perceive the use of generative AI tools to assist them in developing e-learning? (2) How do generative AI tools assist them in learning to develop e-learning? and (3) What challenges do students face in using generative AI tools to develop e-learning? The expected findings will demonstrate students’ perceptions of using generative AI tools in developing e-learning. The findings will also include the benefits and challenges of using generative AI to build e-learning and related instructional materials. The findings will contribute knowledge to the educational field and best practices for educators or instructional designers in developing e-learning using AI. In addition, educational leaders will perceive creative solutions for embracing AI to transform education.\n\nABSTRACT\n\nCivic discourse is essential for a democratic classroom environment since it requires students to use rhetoric to argue rationally on issues instead of turning back on their peers. This two-phase research aims to develop a mobile application that supports teachers in fostering healthy civic discourse in classrooms. Phase One covered an observation and audio recording of classroom discussions in eight classrooms, with 235 students in total. Afterwards, the audio recordings were transcribed and coded using the ‘process coding’ approach. Phase Two was mobile application development, which used the data from the former phase. The app was prototyped using XCode and then tested and evaluated for effectiveness by ten teachers using a 7-point semantic differential scale questionnaire, which resulted in a moderately high score. The final result of the application has four main features for teachers, as follows:. 1) Learning about civic discourse: This provides a description of civic discourse and explains the guidelines for setting up a classroom atmosphere that encourages civic discourse. 2) Mastering in civic discourse analytical skill Teachers learn strategies to foster healthy civic discourse through 20 simulation questions. Each question narrates dialogue between teacher-students and students-students. Teachers select one of the three options that they think or will do in that situation. Those three options will then lead to the three different explanations with no absolute correct answer. 3) Understanding students’ characteristics This allows teachers to experience a set of questions asking about the behaviors of individual students in four main aspects: (1) being open-minded; (2) being able to access reliable information; (3) having rational and critical thinking skills; and (4) participating in decision-making for the public, according to the Habermasean framework. When completing all questions, teachers can assess the level of each trait in that student as well as receive feedback to improve each aspect through civic discourse. 4) Exploring ideas for teaching citizenship education This section collects and synthesizes learning resources that teachers can apply to their citizenship education classrooms to build up the desired characteristics of young citizens.\n\nABSTRACT\n\nThis research developed a next-generation online lesson study program for university courses, focusing on analyzing students' reflective characteristics. Reflective lesson studies are vital for teachers' professional development, and there has been a global shift towards using information tools to deepen teacher reflection. Our program, designed with Microsoft Teams and Microsoft Stream, targets both school teachers and university education students. It includes lectures on teaching methods, creating instructional videos (individually or collaboratively), engaging in group discussions about these videos, and writing reflective reports. Our analysis, based on Darling-Hammond's (1999; 2006) teacher reflection model, encompasses student understanding assessment, teaching efficacy, classroom environment, educational philosophy, and continuous teacher growth. The study analyzed students' reflective reports from the program's final phase, integrated into a one-semester educational methodology course involving 107 sophomore and junior prospective teachers. Using text-mining, we classified sets of adjectives and nouns in modifier-modified relationships in the reports according to Darling-Hammond's reflection model. This approach revealed specific types of reflections prevalent in the online format, highlighting a bias in students' reflective reports. The findings highlighted: (1) Reflections on children's understanding and child-centered teaching methods, (2) Observations of teacher-influenced classroom environments, (3) Absence of reflections on children's interactions and educational philosophies, and (4) Enhanced student motivation for future lesson studies. These biases, linked to video recordings of teachers' (i.e., students') actions from children's perspectives, demonstrate the program's unique advantages in online learning environments. Our program, aligned with nurturing future-ready educators, plays a vital role in modern education. It enhanced student reflection and significantly contributed to undergraduate teacher education by offering practical lesson study experiences and child-centric teaching insights. This program effectively integrates technological tools with educational strategies, emphasizing interactive and reflective learning environments. Additionally, it outlines key future research and development directions. Priorities include enhancing online features for greater location and time flexibility and promoting children's interaction in video projects, which is crucial for advancing teacher training in university faculties. This innovative approach supports ongoing lesson studies for in-service teachers and drives educational transformation, equipping educators with competencies for a progressive educational environment and guiding continuous innovation and improvement in teaching methodologies.\n\nABSTRACT\n\nTrialled in a JC Lit classroom, this study incorporated classroom practices to support 46 JC1 students to build their metacognitive skills in a blended learning environment. This enabled students to apply their metacognitive learner strategies to meet learning goals. Background of study: In the JC1 Lit classroom, many students had limited prior exposure to poetry and were afraid of engaging with unseen poetry. Many students also did not know how to check and regulate their thought processes. These students tended to attribute their occasional success in interpreting poems to chance, rather than skills, and were unable to transfer their learning to the next poem. Consequently, students’ sense of self-efficacy and affective engagement took a sharp dip. This corresponds with observations made by Zimmerman and Martinez-Pons (1988) that many students do not proactively or strategically self-regulate their learning and that it is important to teach metacognitive learner strategies explicitly and consistently in classroom practice (Zimmerman and Martinez-Pons, 1988). Aims: We wanted to find out if explicitly teaching students metacognitive skills and giving them time and space in the blended learning environment to practise these skills would enable them to gain a greater sense of confidence in analysing unseen poetry. Methodology: Drawing on Zimmerman and Campillo’s work (2003), an analysis of students’ learning challenges was carried out. We designed a self-assessment tool using the results from this analysis. Students rated their proficiency and confidence levels in achieving different learning goals. The same survey tool was used at the end of a term which included several intervention strategies in the online and face-to-face classroom to help students build greater metacognitive capability. Findings: Using the self-assessment tool, it was found that students’ confidence increased across all items at the end of the term. Items pertaining to self-regulation, e.g., ability to stay calm under pressure, show the greatest improvement. Students’ metacognitive practice led them to be more self-directed in their learning. It was also observed that students found poetry more enjoyable. Students were able to transfer their learning across online and face-to face learning environments – this was triangulated with data from assessment.\n\nABSTRACT\n\nAims This project aims to learn more about the strategies of teachers to assess student performance. Hattie's (2012) compilation of meta-analyses has shown that a variety of factors influence students' academic performance. But which factors do teachers select to assess student performance appropriately? It aims to examine the utilization of information sources when teachers make judgments about student performance and the validity of these sources. Methodology 21 classes from three Chinese elementary schools took part in the study. The 21 teachers (2 male) were on average 39.05 years old (SD = 7.50) and taught mathematics for an average of 4.64 hours per week (SD = 1.33). The 417 students had a mean age of 12.05 years (SD = .96). Within two school hours, they completed a fractions test for 6th graders (Hirzel & Reischmann, 1973) to measure student performance, a language-free intelligence test (Oswald, 2016), a concentration test (Brickenkamp et al, 2010), a test of mathematical strategy knowledge for 5th and 6th graders (Lingel et al., 2014) as well as scales on mathematical self-concept (Ziegler et al., 2005), motivation to participate in class (Wang et al., 2016), interest in mathematics (Rauer & Schuck, 2021) and the quality of homework (Power et al., 2015). At the same time, the teachers assessed student performance in the fractions test by stating the number of problems solved per student. Findings It was found that the students' intelligence (p < .001), strategy knowledge (p < .001), and mathematical self-concept (p < .001) were valid predictors of fraction performance. Teachers' judgment of student performance was significantly predicted by fractional arithmetic performance (p < .001). It was also shown that self-concept (p < .001), strategy knowledge (p < .01), student intelligence (p < .001), and the quality of homework (p < .05) also influenced the teacher's assessment. A comparison of the results on the validity and use of student characteristics reveals extensive similarities. Overall, the study suggests that teachers know how to make good use of valid indications of student performance in mathematics and that these shape their judgment of cognitive performance at school.\n\nABSTRACT\n\nThere is robust evidence of the positive impact of early childhood education (ECE) on young children’s mathematical development and future life outcomes (Duncan et al., 2007; Ritchie & Bates, 2013). There is also evidence that children from disadvantaged socioeconomic environments (SES) exhibit poorer mathematical skills than their more advantaged peers (Duncan & Magnuson, 2011; Reardon & Portilla, 2016). This has translated into policy recommendations that underscore high-quality mathematical stimulation to tackle the SES-achievement gap early in development. In this regard, many educational policies highlight the role of preschool teachers as an integral part of high-quality ECE programs. Indeed, teachers' personal characteristics, such as intrinsic motivation, are important determinants for ECE process quality reflected in classroom interactions (Pianta, La Paro, Payne, Cox, & Bradley, 2002). This study investigates whether teachers’ intrinsic motivation towards their job in ECE helps to reduce SES-related differences in the development of math skills. Longitudinal data (n=1009; Mage= 57.3 months; SD= 3.9) on mathematical achievement (using TEMA-3) were collected at the beginning and end of K1. The teacher’s intrinsic motivation (n= 125; Mexperience= 7.5 years; SD= 6.1) was assessed with four subscales of the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory (IMI). The family SES was measured with a composite variable that included parental educational attainment, household income, as well as housing type. Results from a multilevel model revealed a significant main effect of SES on the child’s mathematical development (r= .07). Children from more advantaged SES backgrounds showed steeper growth over the first year in kindergarten. That effect was qualified by a significant cross-level interaction with the teacher’s intrinsic motivation (r= -.65). The negative coefficient indicates that the SES-achievement gap increased as the intrinsic motivation of teachers decreased. Examining the interaction at 1SD above and below the mean intrinsic motivation revealed no effect of SES on mathematical growth (over the first year in kindergarten) for children in classrooms with more intrinsically motivated teachers. In contrast, the existing lag in mathematical skills observed in children from more disadvantaged backgrounds at the start of K1 increased in classrooms where teachers had less intrinsic motivation.\n\nABSTRACT\n\nThe Doctor of Podiatric Medicine degree was offered in 2023 by Monash University as an extended Masters qualification. To enter this course, individuals must have a prior health-related Bachelors qualification with successful completion of undergraduate subjects in Anatomy, Physiology, and Pharmacology. With its first run in 2023, 15 students failed to meet the Pharmacology requirement, resulting in a projected financial loss exceeding $600,000 AUD. To address this issue, the Podiatry academic team developed an innovative solution in the form of an online short course titled \"Introduction to Pharmacology for Health Professional Prescribers.\" This course development was funded ($9000 AUD) by the School of Primary and Allied Healthcare. The course was strategically designed to bridge the Pharmacology knowledge gap for students entering post-graduate healthcare programs, with special emphasis placed on foundational pharmacology knowledge essential for safe and effective prescribing practices. Key features of the short course include its online, self-directed format, enabling completion in less than 12 weeks. Leveraging Smartboard enhanced lectures and interactive pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic multimedia aimed to increase student engagement and enhance the learning experience. Open-book online assessments were designed to ensure academic rigour, with minimal on-going staff involvement. The asynchronous nature meant that students could start any time in the year, combined with the relatively low cost of the short course enables it to be more affordable and accessible to potential students, serving as a unique entry point into higher education. Looking forward, the course exhibits scalability, with potential expansion to meet the specific needs of allied health professionals seeking the endorsement of their registration for scheduled medicines. The course was launched on December 18, 2023, and initial responses indicate a positive uptake. Ongoing research will evaluate its effectiveness in comparison to traditional in-person courses, exploring the potential of short courses as alternative and efficient entry pathways into higher degree programs. If successful, this innovative model could reshape educational paradigms, facilitating broader access for aspiring healthcare professionals. *Presented in English*\n\nABSTRACT\n\nBackground: In recent years, more students with Special Educational Needs (SEN) have been enrolled in universities. These students may have a dilemma of whether to disclose their diagnosis to their peers. Current literature focuses on understanding these students’ experiences in university when disclosing to their peers in a qualitative manner. However, there has been limited research done on the quality of disclosure to peers, especially by university students with SEN in a local Asian context such as Singapore. Method: A new scale, the SEN Self-Disclosure Scale (SENDS), was created to measure the quality of Singapore university students with SEN’s disclosure quality. The SENDS consists of six vignettes and an 8-item questionnaire that will be asked alongside each of the vignettes. The six vignettes were created by individuals who had experiences working with university students with SEN. The 8-item questionnaire was constructed using the subfactors of self-disclosure in Wheeless (1978), based on the researchers’ understanding on the topics that a local student with SEN will have to disclose about. The sample consisted of 30 students (22 male, 7 female, 1 other; mean age = 24.17, SD = 2.74) diagnosed with different types of SEN (i.e., Specific Learning Disorder, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, and Autism Spectrum Disorder) studying in National Technological University, Singapore. The participants were asked to evaluate the SENDS’s content validity and readability. Result: The participants provided qualitative feedback regarding the vignettes and changes were made accordingly in the SENDS. Discussion: Future studies would need to be conducted to evaluate the psychometric properties (i.e., reliability and validity) of the SENDS.\n\nABSTRACT\n\nChildren’s knowledge of number words is typically assessed with the Give-N Task (Wynn, 1990, 1992). On this task, children are asked to give different quantities of objects and researchers classify children based on the highest number they give correctly. This task reveals an interesting pattern in which children learn the first few number words sequentially and one at a time, up to about “four” before becoming counters who can use counting to generate sets of objects. Past studies have analyzed children’s accuracy on the task, but few have investigated how children produce sets of objects (e.g., grabbing objects or counting out objects) and its relationship with their knowledge of counting. In this study, we coded children’s gestures on the task and asked whether gestures may reflect the mechanisms by which sets are generated. Participants included 286 2- to 5-year-old children. Children completed the Give-N Task with a puppet and some toy bananas. On each trial, children were asked to give the puppet different quantities of bananas, starting with “one”. Children were coded as non-counters and counters based on accuracy on the task. Importantly, we coded whether they simply grabbed a set, placed the bananas one by one without overt counting, verbally counted, or used any combination of gestures. We analyzed gestures as a function of set size (small vs. large). We found that counters were more likely than non-counters to count on the task. Counters were more likely to count on large than small sets. Counters were also more likely than non-counters to demonstrate a planning step approach. Contrary to common assumption, counters did not always count on large sets. Other strategies included placing objects one by one without overt counting, or a combination of grabbing and placing objects one at a time (e.g., grabbing two and placing the rest one by one to make four). These results show that counters and non-counters differed in their use of counting, and also raise questions about the need to examine other unexplored strategies. In particular, the use of both grabbing and individuating objects suggest that children might be decomposing number.\n\nABSTRACT\n\nWhile citizenship education has been regarded as a goal of public schooling in most societies, the Singapore government has treated it with utmost importance; as a matter critical for her long-term survival as a nation-city-state. To that end, Singapore has experimented with various citizenship education programmes since self-governance in 1959. Launched in 2001, Social Studies has been a “major vehicle for citizenship education” (Sim, 2008, p. 253), and also a compulsory-and-examinable school subject. However, tensions arise when Social Studies teachers negotiate the national identity building and critical thinking aims of the subject. Moreover, despite signs of increasing democratisation, Singapore seems to have “backslid into more authoritarianism” (Abdullah, 2020, p. 1128) in the recent decade. This study examines how Social Studies teachers understand and rationalise the teaching of critical thinking in Singapore. This inquiry is composed of two sections. First, I will examine the historical and socio-political context of Singapore shaping the government’s approach to critical thinking in citizenship education. Second, I will examine how teachers understand and perceive their navigation of the teaching of critical thinking in Social Studies. Adopting a grounded theory methodology of data collection and analysis, I will draw from an initial analysis of academic literature on Singapore, critical thinking, citizenship and citizenship education, and Social Studies. This will be followed by the empirical focus of this study; which will include (i) analysis of relevant historical, policy, curricular, and other archival (primary) documents pertaining critical thinking in citizenship education curricula from 1959 to 2022; followed by (ii) semi-structured individual interviews conducted with current Social Studies teachers in public secondary schools in Singapore. This overall aim of this study to generate substantive theory that will suggest directions towards approaches of teaching critical thinking in the context of Social Studies in Singapore and provide relevance towards education for citizenship in other settings.\n\nABSTRACT\n\nEven though collaborative learning allows students to develop cognitive, social and emotional skills, the mechanisms underlying collaboration in collaborative learning is still not well-understood. Recent technological advances in in neuroimaging techniques such as functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) have pushed for a move toward more interactive paradigms that measure inter-brain synchrony (IBS) in real-time social and collaborative settings. While preliminary studies have established a positive correlation between IBS and collaborative performance, it is not clear whether IBS facilitates collaborative performance or whether IBS is a by-product of two brains encoding the same stimuli. Moreover, even though synchrony at the physiological level has also been found to predict collaborative performance, physiological and neurophysiological synchrony have always been studied separately. This study aims to (1) determine the causality of IBS on collaborative performance, and (2) understand the relationship between physiological synchrony, IBS, and collaborative performance. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) data and physiological data are measured simultaneously from participant dyads via hyperscanning as they play Quadra, a modified version of Tetris, individually and collaboratively in three sessions. The collaborative version of Quadra requires one participant to control the orientation of the tetrominoes and the other to control the location of the tetrominoes. In two of the three sessions, prior to playing Quadra, participants are administered non-invasive transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) at the right temporoparietal junction (rTPJ) to influence IBS. Continuous theta-burst stimulation (cTBS) is used to inhibit IBS in one session while intermittent TBS (iTBS) is used to induce IBS in the other session. Data collection is ongoing and results will be discussed in terms of the following hypotheses. First, we hypothesise that IBS causally facilitates collaboration, thus we expect collaborative performance to improve when IBS is induced and to deteriorate when IBS is inhibited. Next, we hypothesise that physiological synchrony in skin conductance levels and heart rate will be positively associated with collaborative performance. Given that collaboration has been found to improve learning and foster positive social interdependence across age groups and cultures, findings from this study have important implications for learning interventions.\n\nABSTRACT\n\nLessons revolving around post-assessment corrections easily lapse into lectures followed by silent individual work. This poster will illustrate how teachers incorporate Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools, Differentiated Instruction (DI) and hands-on activities within the structure of Station-Rotation Model (SRM) so that correcting one’s mistakes is both productive and fun. Assessment is ‘an interconnected part of teaching and learning’ (Berry, 2008, p. 5) of which corrections play an integral role in supporting learning (Alleman & Brophy, 1998; Berry, 2008). For students to fail forward, they need to know where they went wrong, why they went wrong and revisit the topics and skills (Bohney et al., 2018). Because students have demonstrated their inadequacy through their mistakes, teachers may feel compelled to adopt the receptive-transmission model (Askew, 2000) to feed students with the necessary knowledge to control the quality of learning. A multi-station classroom structure breaks up classroom formation suited for such frontal teaching, naturally prompting practitioners to adopt a more constructivist approach for giving feedback. Moving from station to station also creates opportunities for students to learn and interact with different classmates, creating new social learning spaces (Kokko & Hirsto, 2021; Tucker, 2023). Additionally, SRM allows for customization of learning processes (Tucker, 2023) or DI (Allan, 2000; Tomlinson, 2017) depending on the activities in each station. This is also part of the intent behind AfL (Askew, 2000; Berry, 2008; Padmanabha, 2021) since students rarely make the same mistakes for the same reasons in any assessment. Incorporating AI tools enables students to assess their own learning using AI as a preliminary source of feedback. The poster will include students’ artefacts in two contrasting subject areas - language and mathematics, data from pre and post-lesson students’ perception surveys, as well as links to sample lesson plans for teaching secondary level English Language, Literature in English, Additional Mathematics and Elementary Mathematics.\n\nABSTRACT\n\nThis poster encapsulates Fuchun Secondary School's transformative nine-year expedition aimed at refining assessment practices to foster a more impactful learning environment. Motivated by an increasing recognition among educators regarding the pivotal role of assessment in the learning process, the school adopted a whole-school approach to overhaul assessment practices. The journey unfolded across four distinct phases: Shifting Mindsets and Expectations (2015 – 2016); Strengthening Assessment Culture (2017 – 2018); Creating a Support System (2019 – 2021); and Deepening Assessment to Support Self-Directed Learning (2022 – 2024). Throughout the years, a dedicated core team collaborated with educators to experiment with Assessment for Learning (AfL) strategies. Our initiatives include: (i) Recognizing the pivotal role of teachers in shaping student learning experiences through assessment, we expanded beyond conventional professional development courses. We leveraged microlearning as a potent strategy for ongoing professional growth (Buchem & Hamelmann, 2010). This approach involved creating and disseminating customized microlearning packages designed by and for teachers. (ii) Implementing task-based assignments to actively engage students in the learning process. (iii) Equipping students with the tools for peer assessment, capitalizing on the effectiveness of bite-sized learning (Giurgiu, 2017; Mohammed et al., 2018; Semingson et al., 2015; Shatte & Teague, 2020). Reflecting insights from the literature, which underscores the need for students to acclimate to AfL and Assessment as Learning (AaL) (DeLuca et al., 2018), our journey from a traditional, passive-transmissive mode of assessment (Berry, 2008) to a reciprocal model (Fletcher, 2016; Hager & Butler, 1996) where students assume full ownership of their learning (AaL) (Padmanabha, 2021) has borne fruit through our students’ work, and their very positive attitude towards school and learning. Our experiences are positioned to assist educators undertaking school-wide initiatives to implement and sustain changes in teaching and learning. The presentation will also feature multi-modal student artifacts and insights from student perception surveys.\n\nABSTRACT\n\nCharacter and Citizenship Education (CCE) is an integral education component in primary and secondary schools in Singapore. However, there is a need for students to be further engaged cognitively in CCE lessons. Therefore, our project sought to bridge the gap in learning through adapting a Secondary 3 CCE lesson that has been prepared by the CCE branch on the topic of Navigating Challenges at work through the use of Deck Toys. Deck Toys is an online classroom platform that allows teachers to teach and engage students interactively. The activities we designed using Deck Toys are grounded by three main cognitive theories; information processing theory , Piaget and Vygotsky’s cognitive theory of development. Activities curated on the Deck Toys using Pac-Man as the interface of the game served to give students an authentic experience of navigating complexities at work. Activities that were crafted were meant to enable students to dabble with new information , recall , assess , create, discuss and evaluate their choices through the use of tools Deck Toys afforded. Both the instructions and tasks are created giving paramount importance to cognitive theories of development. Through designing an adaptation of the CCE lesson , we acknowledge and address learners: i) cognitive development stage ii) capitalise the strength the learner at that stage possesses. Through this acknowledgement of the cognitive ability of students at that stage, we hope that it would help in shaping the learner's learning experience through the design of appropriate tasks that leverages on the learner's cognitive abilities. Using Deck Toys will enable teachers to better scaffold students’ learning , serving by way of mediating agents to help bridge the gaps in knowledge for students at certain pitstops of the game. Leveraging the use of ICT promotes self-directed learning ; which helps serve to enhance the cognitive thinking ability & motivation level of students. Through teacher-student interactions and discussion at the final pitstop in the Deck Toy, students culminate their learning of this topic by evaluating their choices and garnering the opportunity to listen to other possible perspectives during the discussion.

It attempts to measure educational effectiveness based on results rather than inputs. The student learning outcomes constitute the criteria by which the program is developed or redesigned, instructional materials are selected, teaching methods are adopted, and evaluation is conducted. Data were collected through interviews and focus groups. The target groups were administrators and teachers in school, alumni, current students, and lecturers. The research found that determining learning outcomes aims to develop students to be teachers in school who could promote citizenship for Primary and secondary education students. Content in the program must be knowledge related to citizenship, sociological theories, economics, law, politics, government, history, and area-based analysis. Learning activities must emphasize learning by creating real experiences, such as field trip activities, practising in different area-based contexts, and analyzing and synthesizing to create knowledge. For the last year in the program, students must be able to design learning activities for various courses; the goal was for students in school to be aware of the changing world and comprehensive about the nature of human and world society. The lecturers in the program must provide information and activities to support the students in becoming thinkers. Stimulate students to learn through thinking processes in various dimensions more than lecture teaching. The faculty had to provide the environment and facilities for the program, such as a teaching lab and workspace for students. The program designs various measurements and evaluations according to skills as learning outcomes and communicates to students to prepare themselves to achieve the program's learning outcomes.\n\nABSTRACT\n\nOne of the primary goals of higher education in Thailand is to become a world-class university. This essay examines the approach and scholarly advancement in Thai higher education as defined by the \"Professional Standards Framework,\" a system of quality assessment. This study's methodology is documentary research. Administrators and instructors at the university have also been interviewed. The result was found that, ranking systems have been found to play a significant role in the development of teacher quality in Thai universities. This is because a university's ability to obtain government funding, research funding, international collaboration, and student enrollment is directly impacted by its standing in the world's top 100-500 universities or its superior ranking among other Thai universities. A number of tactics have been used to improve the rating. One tactic that has been used for a number of years in numerous colleges is the improvement of teacher and academic quality by having more lecturers receive the \"Professional Standards Framework.\" The United Kingdom Professional Standards Framework (UKPSF) has authorized this framework. The requirement will meet professors' rising expectations for their professional and knowledge acumen.The standard will meet the growing demands on lecturers' expertise and level of involvement in the profession. It also supports the development, implementation, and accreditation processes of the policies, programs, processes, and systems. While some colleges modified the framework to fit their unique needs, others encouraged or mandated that their instructors qualify for the UKPSF. According to the universities, a lecturer is qualified as a professional lecturer if they have obtained certification from either UKPSF or their PSF. In line with each university's announcement, they will receive additional perks. For example, a university offers incentives and benefits to applicants for academic positions. Some academic institutions use key performance indicators (KPIs) in their performance reviews with the goal of motivating their instructors to receive professional standards framework endorsements. Due to its large number of professionally certified teachers, the university will rank higher. The university gains from this tactic by raising its ranking score. Teachers benefit as well. On the other hand, instructors felt under pressure due to mandatory measures.\n\nABSTRACT\n\nIntegration of ICT in the Classroom has become the order of the day, without which classroom transactions can never be active, efficient, or meaningful. The present paper highlights the role of OER in evaluating climate change and eco-friendly practices. There is an urgent need for efficient teaching tools and materials to raise awareness and encourage sustainable practices in light of the growing concerns around climate change from around the world. Open Educational Resources, or publicly available learning materials, have become a promising way to spread awareness of environmental issues, climate change, and adopting eco-friendly practices. The study was framed on the theory of planned behaviour (TPB) advocated by Arjen,1985 used popularly for changing behaviour intervention. A substantial body of empirical research has shown that TPB is helpful for the development of effective behavior modification interventions in addition to behavior prediction and explanation. According to this theory, interventions are effective when they enable individuals to obtain the skills and information needed to carry out their goals and when they lead to modifications in the beliefs that underpin those goals. Using Open Educational Resources as an intervention, the current study aims to explain how people's intentions to adopt eco-friendly activities and the process of behavioral change concerning climate change. The study highlights the potential of Open Educational Resources in tackling climate change issues, which provides significant insights into the domains of sustainability, environmental studies, and education. The findings are aimed at informing educators, decision-makers, and interested parties about the value of utilizing open educational resources (OER) to promote climate literacy and foster an environmentally conscious culture in a range of educational settings. Keywords – Open Educational Resources, Climate-Change Education, Eco-friendly practices, adolescent learners\n\nABSTRACT\n\nThis study describes the disciplinary-specific feedback practices in two Singapore secondary history classes. Our goal is to uncover how history teachers design and implement feedback practices to facilitate historical inquiry. Interviews with history teachers reveal that their feedback design focused on facilitating student engagement with historical sources and empowering them to construct their own interpretations of historical events. The teachers also refrained from imposing their interpretations of the historical events during feedback, allowing students to navigate their inquiry journey. Results showed: (1) The implemented disciplinary-specific feedback practices include the creation of multiple avenues for feedback dialogues and the provision of resources as reference points for internal feedback; (2) These practices effectively facilitated meaningful feedback dialogues between students and teachers; and (3) Despite the availability of multiple feedback avenues, a subset of students exhibited reluctance to engage in feedback dialogues. This study highlights the potential of disciplinary-specific feedback in empowering students to take ownership of the historical inquiry journey and develop qualities inherent to proficient history learners. The findings contribute to the ongoing discourse on effective history pedagogy, offering insights for practitioners seeking to enhance feedback strategies in historical inquiry.\n\nABSTRACT\n\nIn Singapore Polytechnic (SP), students from the Diploma in Perfumery and Cosmetic Science (DPCS) work on industry projects to acquire essential knowledge and skills that are required to prepare for their professional roles through Industry Now Curriculum (INC) pathway. With a focus on nurturing self-directed learning (SDL) and teamwork skills in students aligning to SP’s graduate attributes, this pedagogical approach serves as a good platform to infuse team-based activities for the facilitation of autonomous learning. Students are empowered to solve complex real-world problems by capitalising on concerted team efforts and self-directed learning (SDL) skillsets inculcated in the learning process. Therefore, this study was designed to identify the potential team factors that could influence self-directed learning readiness (SDLR) in students. Upon analysis of the quantitative and qualitative data collected from surveys and students’ reflections, significant findings on the plausible effect of team effectiveness (TE) on self-directed learning readiness (SDLR) was found to concur well with the notion that SDLR can be developed through deliberate practice and experiences co-created by the team members. There is an upward trend observed in SDLR increment as project teams deepened their project-based learning (PBL) engagement over time showing a statistically significant outcome (p < 0.001) based on Friedman test. Further analysis using Spearman correlations (p > 0.8) and qualitative teamwork evaluations have provided greater insights into the construct of TE and SDLR measurements. It was concluded that the identified team factors such as Team Motivation, Team Structure, Team Dynamics and Team Excellence had indicated positive monotonic relationships with SDLR enhancement in this study. The synergy derived from TE in the creation of a collaborative, inclusive and supportive learning environment, together with the sustained interest of learning independence in problem solving and upskilling in PBL would redefine the way we perceive self-directed learning. Furthermore, the ability to take ownership of learning under team influence would transform the concept of an individual playing the central role in the agency of learning to stimulate personal growth.\n\nABSTRACT\n\nWhile an array of formative assessment methodologies have been scrutinized within Anglophone contexts, there exists a noticeable dearth of analogous inquiry in Confucian-heritage societies such as China. Profoundly ingrained by Confucianism, the Confucian heritage countries catalyze a societal mania of summative assessment, i.e., high-stakes tests. Consequently, local teachers and students display an acute predilection for summative assessment, fostering an environment that manifests the most contentious and reticent disposition towards reforms in formative assessment. We investigated the history of the Imperial Examinations and the contemporary rigorous and competitive examination systems in Mainland China, Japan and South Korea. The quest for academic excellence and the pursuit of prestigious universities continue to drive students in these regions to navigate the stringent, high-stakes examination systems. Accordingly, formative assessment lacks natural soil in these Confucian heritage countries. Further, we delved into the tenets of Confucianism and discovered that the official assessment systems and Confucianism influenced and reinforced each other, intertwining into three influential factors: filial piety, utilitarianism and conformity that greatly impacted Confucian societies until today, ultimately leading to the profound and far-reaching effects on the contemporary challenges associated with formative assessment.\n\nABSTRACT\n\nWith UNESCO advocacy for “education for all”, differentiated instruction (DI) teacher professional development (PD) becomes the top agenda in world education. In the post-pandemic period when uncertainty increases and learner diversity intensifies, it becomes crucial to equip teachers with knowledge, tools, resources and expert guidance to facilitate sustainable self-directed PD. This study aims to explore the teacher-researcher co-construction of an Online Lesson Planning Platform for Differentiated Instruction (hereafter DI Planner) as an infrastructure to support teacher self-directed PD in a school-university collaboration project in Hong Kong. DI is a philosophical approach to teaching and learning that caters for students’ diverse learning needs, but DI implementation has been reported to be difficult. Teachers need research-informed pedagogies and strategies to support their DI practice while researchers need evidence-based classroom data to validate the theories and conceptual frameworks for DI. In this school-university collaboration project, the teachers and researchers collaborated to co-construct an online DI Planner which served as a platform to bridge the researcher-practitioner divide by providing practitioners with an ongoing enriching inventory of DI strategies, a shared resource bank of lesson plans and teaching materials in cycles of expert-guided lesson planning, implementation and reflection. This study examined to what extent the DI Planner facilitated teachers’ planning and implementation of DI as well as their self-directed PD for DI. A mixed methods approach was adopted to trace the construction and application of the DI planner in a school where it was tried out in four subjects. Both qualitative and quantitative data were collected including observations of teacher training and try-out of the DI Planner, questionnaires and interviews with teachers on their reflections about the effects of the DI Planner as well as artefacts of lesson plans and student works. Results showed that the DI Planner facilitated teachers’ design and implementation of DI lessons, but needed improvements in functionality and resources to better support teachers’ self-directed PD. The findings shed light on how to sustain teacher PD by leveraging on education technological advancement. The study also exemplifies how researcher-practitioner collaboration informs DI practice and policymaking for educational change.\n\nABSTRACT\n\nSelf-directed learning (SDL) is increasingly vital in today's ever-changing educational landscape, especially with the sudden outbreak of COVID-19, which led to an unexpected shift to synchronous learning. The pandemic immediately posed challenges in achieving effective learning in this synchronous format, highlighting the need for students to possess strong self-directed learning skills. In the aftermath of COVID-19, the new norm involves adapting to asynchronous education, blended with face-to-face tutorial classes to reinforce students' asynchronous learning experiences. To empower educators in fostering SDL skills among students, this paper introduces an innovative SDL dashboard designed explicitly for educators who believe in developing self-directed learners. The dashboard visualizes data derived from an SDL diagnostic evaluation comprising 27 statements. These statements encompass both learning (cognitive) and behavioral changes indicative of SDL readiness driven by self-regulatory skills. Strategic data collection points are set at the beginning of each academic year. Additionally, the integration of SDL skill development into the curriculum using a holistic approach. The approach emphasizes a seamless blending of personal skills, such as self-regulatory learning, with knowledge, into the curriculum. This paper not only presents the 27 SDL evaluation statements, capturing various aspects of SDL readiness but also delves into the dashboard's functionality. Powered by a customized analytics algorithm to transform raw data into meaningful visualizations and actionable insights for educators. Moreover, it incorporates intervention measures, class and individual SDL profiles, offering educators the following benefits: 1. Informing Interventions: Empowering educators with students' SDL readiness levels before implementing targeted interventions to foster their growth as self-directed learners. 2. Adaptable Teaching: Enabling educators to tailor their teaching approaches and adapt classroom learning activities correspondingly. Feedback was collected through a survey questionnaire on the integrated SDL teaching approach. Triangulation was employed with multiple data sources such as learning reflections, individual SDL evaluation results and test results. In summary, this paper shows an SDL dashboard offering actionable insights through a comprehensive SDL diagnostic evaluation. It also emphasizes the need to purposefully integrate SDL teaching strategies into the curriculum to foster SDL.\n\nABSTRACT\n\nThe Prep 2 PSLE (Preparation for English Paper 2 PSLE) Programme was designed and implemented in 2013 with the primary goal of supporting primary school students with dyslexia and other specific learning differences (SpLD) in their school and national examinations. Previous studies have demonstrated that the programme is effective in addressing the examination needs of this group of learners through an explicit and systematic teaching methodology. In 2020, the program embraced online teaching and virtual lessons by incorporating video lessons and online educational apps into its curriculum delivery. This study seeks to evaluate the effectiveness of teaching practices through an examination of the utilization of online teaching tools to foster student learning, application, and engagement in virtual classrooms. This qualitative investigation involved the observation of one-hour-long recorded online classroom sessions of two separate virtual classes, each led by different educational therapists. The researchers analyzed how these therapists employed online learning tools, resources, and questioning strategies to elicit responses from the participating 5 students, aged between 10 and 12. The research data indicates that online tools are effective in enhancing cognitive engagement and critical thinking among learners. It also demonstrates the varied approaches educational therapists employ when integrating these tools into their instructional methods. The findings of this study offer valuable insights to educational therapists, highlighting opportunities to enhance their teaching methods through a strategic fusion of teaching tools and questioning techniques.\n\nABSTRACT\n\nAim: A push for critical education among beginning teachers has triggered calls for policy renewal across Initial Teacher Education (ITE) courses Australia-wide. Forces of neoliberalism on higher education have shifted the aims, objectives, content and delivery methods of ITE into more individualised, economically rooted and competitive ends. More than other proponents of critical education, teacher educators are mostly accused for novice teachers’ lack of preparedness for critical teaching in schools. Yet, there remains a paucity of empirical research that seeks the viewpoints of teacher educators on their understanding of critical studies in higher education. How teacher educators associate with critical tenets in their pedagogies is researched to understand the ways critical pedagogy (CP) is performed in their teaching practices. In this paper, teacher educators’ voices, perceptions and enactments of CP highlight the complexities, opportunities, challenges and risks associated when confronting and challenging dominant neoliberal norms. Methodology: Using a qualitative case study, this study engaged with six teacher educators from an Australian public university, representing six different teaching disciplines. An instrumental, single-bounded case study approach was employed to explore the phenomenon of teacher educators’ perceptions of CP in their engagement with pre-service teachers. Case data was collected from two rounds of semi-structured interviews and observations of their classroom teaching. Findings: Emerging findings from this study demonstrate a considerable consensus among teacher educators about the importance of critical education, in their ITE and with pre-service teachers. In their understandings, CP was often viewed as a catalyst for student-centric education, integral in transforming educational theories into critical action and an invitation to explore uneasy or uncomfortable topics. As CP’s understanding was largely varied by individual teacher educators, primarily by their teaching disciplines, this paper presents that CP is inherently affective and sharpens their praxis with a focus on transformative learning, although it remains unapologetically complex, mixed with both radical gains and tensions.\n\nABSTRACT\n\nThis research stems from the increasing emphasis on teachers to engage in formative assessment with the gradual reduction of summative assessment in Singapore’s educational landscape. This develops the need to examine the extent teachers are accommodating to the changes against the strong performative culture in schools. The research aims to understand teachers’ beliefs and practices of formative assessment by investigating how teachers perceived and practice formative assessment in the classroom. This evaluative case study research uses the mixed method approach using semi-structured interviews and questionnaire surveys. The sample comprises of 32 experienced Malay language teachers from 9 primary schools in various locations. 27 for the online questionnaire survey and 5 for the interview. The main issues surface from this research are found to be synonymous with the literature on formative assessment where formative assessment is believed to be essential in developing teachers’ understanding of students learning to inform their practice and to provide students with the opportunity to engage in peer learning as well as to self-regulate. The study finds that teachers believe assessment helps students to understand their learning and motivate them to learn. Teachers also feel that assessment creates a sense of accountability to provide students with a quality assessment that recognizes their needs and ability as well as ensures their wellbeing. This study also finds that teachers actively engage in formative assessment practices that focus on shaping students understanding through checking for understanding, sharing success criteria, and engaging in various forms of feedback. This study concludes that there is a link between teachers’ beliefs and practices that accommodates the need for a formative assessment culture in schools where teachers are guided by their beliefs on the importance of formative assessment adapt and adjust the strategies to mitigate the constraints they faced, to effectively design the most appropriate assessment practices to meet students learning needs. This shows that teachers are proactively and creatively accommodating to the move towards enhancing formative assessment in the classroom despite the inherent challenges posed by need for performance-based assessment.\n\nABSTRACT\n\n\"The term “future-readiness” is closely related to the rise of futures studies since the 1960s, and the associated concept of futures literacy. “Future-readiness” risks losing its depth if advocates overlook the groundbreaking knowledge that initially propelled its popularity. This paper argues that four fundamental questions about future-readiness, as understood in futures studies, contributes to a futures literacy curriculum that will genuinely prepare learners for their futures. The four sub-questions are: 1. What is the future? This inquiry challenges the assumption of a singular, predetermined future (the “prediction/ destiny” view), and encourages learners to explore multiple alternative futures (the “possible futures” view). Consequently, learners develop a heightened sense of responsibility and agency regarding their own futures. 2. How does the future come to pass' Understanding the continuity and discontinuity of time helps learners guard against predictions overly focused on specific trends. It enables them to think in terms of various possible scenarios to address the uncertainty and complexity inherent in the future. 3. What constitutes future-readiness' Paradigm shifts in our understanding of the future and its unfolding reshape our approach to preparing for it. Correct perception and prudent planning become paramount. This involves developing an individual or organizational capability known as strategic foresight. 4. How can one achieve future-readiness' My research identifies that strategic foresight capability comprises three core competencies and methodological approaches: scanning, simulating, and strategizing for the future. The research methodology involves a comprehensive literature review of futures studies and other academic fields that investigates the future. This paper recommends that education researchers, policymakers, and teachers seriously consider implementing futures literacy at a national level. The significance of this paper lies in providing the theoretical foundation for this crucial endeavor.\"\n\nABSTRACT\n\nInternationally there is a clear turn towards inquiry as a core approach to learning and teaching school geography in curriculum directives. Scholars have also described inquiry as geography’s signature pedagogy and a powerful pedagogy/pedagogical practice for developing powerful geographical knowledge. Despite such global interest however, there is limited understanding of how this powerful pedagogy is represented in the intended curriculum, and what teachers know and believe about teaching school geography through inquiry. This study addresses the research gap in two stages. The first is a cross-national comparison of how inquiry learning is expressed and justified in six jurisdictions across four continents (Australia, China, England, Hong Kong, Singapore, USA) through content analysis of national curriculum documents for secondary school geography. We found that most of the jurisdictions, notably Australia (Australian Curriculum version 8.4), England and the USA, have placed inquiry prominently in their curriculum. This represents a response to global trends in educational research that inquiry helps students understand the nature of knowledge construction in the discipline and also achieve broader educational goals. The second part of the study examined teacher knowledge, beliefs and practice of geography inquiry amongst secondary teachers in Victoria, one of the most populous states in Australia, through a survey and case studies in a mixed-methods research. The study concludes firstly, that pedagogy needs to be examined in tandem with knowledge in curriculum analyses and as we consider the future of geographical education, because enabling students to access knowledge and developing their capacities to inquire are intricately linked. Secondly, knowledge for teaching geography through inquiry is a dynamic collection of rich and situated knowledge constructed in and with practice, and teachers’ beliefs are deeply intertwined. These conclusions augment Lee Shulman’s pedagogical content knowledge concepts by incorporating Michael Young’s concepts of powerful knowledge and related ideas on curriculum-making, signalling a way forward on knowledge for teaching powerful subject knowledge through inquiry.\n\nABSTRACT\n\nCurriculum developers make assumptions about teacher capabilities to effectively deliver the learning experiences anticipated in contemporary national curriculum. The Australian Curriculum (AC) is no exception. The AC is aligned to 21st century skills through its three-dimensional structure of learning areas, general capabilities (GCs) and cross-curriculum priorities (CCPs). However, since its implementation from 2011, teachers have found curriculum planning for the AC challenging, particularly in the absence of guidelines or supporting resources to illustrate how the three dimensions work together. Furthermore, most ITE programs and PDs in Australia do not address the skills, resulting in a gap in the curriculum design and support. Hence, teachers must use their own professional expertise to design learning activities that embed 21st century skills. This study explores whether, by using self-regulated learning (SRL) beliefs, knowledge and skills, teachers can draw upon their expertise to independently determine how to integrate 21st century skills into their classroom activities. The study adopted a qualitative, explorative case study approach consisting of an online qualitative survey of Years 7 and 8 teachers in Queensland, followed by semi-structured interviews. This paper presents preliminary findings which indicate that teachers value SRL and believe they use SRL skills to plan their teaching and learning activities. However, further discussions about how SRL strategies could be optimised to enhance teachers' integration of 21st century skills is needed.\n\nABSTRACT\n\nResearch from the science of learning suggests that memory plays a crucial role when engaging in complex cognitive tasks, and that content knowledge is a prerequisite for effective learning. Knowledge acquisition in English/Literature can be supported through knowledge organisers, which are documents comprising key information that students need to have basic knowledge of a topic or text. Such knowledge organisers present a concrete instantiation of ‘envisionments’, which Judith Langer describes as ‘text-worlds in the mind’, that students can build in the English/Literature classroom. Langer’s model of envisionment-building regards students as “lifelong envisionment builders” by encouraging active questioning, and facilitating classes as safe spaces to test out ideas, while promoting multiple perspectives for interpretation. Based on Langer’s theoretical model of envisionment-building, and informed by cognitive load theory, this paper outlines a project by a Networked Learning Community (NLC) about the use of literature knowledge organisers at five secondary schools in Singapore. The methodology involved the adoption of a qualitative approach, with teachers reflecting actively on the process of knowledge creation. From 2022-2023, teachers in this NLC explored how best to tackle challenges in knowledge acquisition in the English/Literature classroom, and how knowledge organisers on online platforms could function as a useful tool for planning, teaching, and assessment. In addition, English/Literature teachers enacted teaching strategies that incorporated such organisers to promote collaborative learning, while encouraging student mastery and ownership of content knowledge. This project found that while essay-writing may appear daunting, online tools like knowledge organisers can aid secondary-level students to draw connections, practise spacing and interleaving, and engage in retrieval practice which directly supports writing. Such knowledge organisers can also be hosted online via Google Sheets, which maximises accessibility while encouraging students’ co-construction of knowledge. These findings are applicable for all schools worldwide that leverage ePedagogy during English/Literature lessons. Relevant knowledge organiser templates will also be shared during the presentation. Through the application of research-based techniques, students can cultivate critical skills and dispositions that enable them to become more confident English/Literature learners.\n\nABSTRACT\n\nWith the rapid development of digital technologies in recent decades, the importance of multimodal literacy has been increasingly recognized by scholars and educators around the globe. In China, multimodal literacy has been incorporated into the latest national English language curriculum guide for primary and secondary education. However, as an emerging competency for teachers, multimodal literacy has not yet been addressed in many language teacher education programs. Teachers presumably teach multimodal literacy on the job, which makes it a pressing task to understand how teachers understand and teach multimodal literacy in the first place. To address this gap, this study investigates teachers’ perceptions and reported practices of teaching multimodal literacy in the English language classroom. Drawing upon data from a questionnaire survey with 242 secondary school English teachers in one of the most developed provinces in China and 6 follow-up interviews with the teachers, the findings reveal that (1) the teachers to varying degrees included multimodal viewing and representing in several types of teaching and learning activities in their classes, though they did not provide systematic and specific guidance on the relevant knowledge and skills; and (2) although the teachers have generally recognized the importance and advantages of teaching multimodal literacy, they are facing challenges regarding what to teach and how to teach. By discussing the findings with studies conducted in other contexts such as Singapore and Australia, this study contributes to advancing our understanding of teachers’ knowledge base in order to teach multimodal literacy, as well as the interplay between teacher knowledge and different contextual factors in enacting teaching multimodal literacy. It also points to an urgent need to incorporate components of multimodal literacy as essential part of teacher education and professional development in order to enhance teachers’ theoretical understanding and hands-on practice of teaching multimodal literacy.\n\nABSTRACT\n\nThe use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) Language models, such as ChatGPT and Google Bard, in the educational context has become a topic of inquiry due to their ability to handle a variety of question types and produce output with a wide range of text types. The output produced by AI language models has been noted to be almost indistinguishable from human writing and is often considered coherent, convincing and of high quality, akin to good writers. However, there is a substantial gap in our understanding of how AI language models perform in terms of various genres. This study examined the effects of text genre prompts on the writing quality and linguistic features (i.e., lexical sophistication, syntactic complexity, and cohesion) of AI written output. Data was collected from both ChatGPT and Bard, which were tasked to answer a total of 120 argumentative and expository prompts on topics ranging from Arts and Humanities, Social Sciences, and Science. The responses generated from both AI language models were analyzed for their writing quality, lexical sophistication, syntactic complexity, and cohesion. Results showed no significant main effects for text genre prompts on all dependent variables. Findings suggest that AI language models do not significantly vary their use of linguistic features based on different text genre prompts. Additionally, the type of genre prompt did not affect the quality of writing for either language model. Results are discussed in the context of developing AI literacy in education, as well as the implications for using AI in language teaching and learning.\n\nABSTRACT\n\nThe purpose of this study is to: 1) create the knowledge collections of multicultural society that are situated in a common space for undergraduates; 2) utilise the knowledge collections of multicultural society to facilitate camp activities for undergraduates; and 3) assess the effectiveness of using the knowledge collections of multicultural society in driving camp activities for undergraduates. Mixed-methods research is included in this study. The population is composed of 107 undergraduates from six higher education institutes in Thailand’s deep south. Documents and questionnaires are the tools for data collection and analysis, with descriptions and statistics. According to the study’s findings, the knowledge collections of multicultural society were able to be organised into four collections, such as history, race and ethnicity, principles of religion and politics, peace, and human beings. Three days of camp activities for undergraduates were established to implement the knowledge collections of a multicultural society. An achievement of the effectiveness of using the knowledge collections of multicultural society in driving camp activities for undergraduates was good. Keywords: Education for a multicultural society; undergraduates; Thailand’s Deep South\n\nABSTRACT\n\nChildren on the autism spectrum show weaker emotional regulation abilities than typically developing children. Although parents exert positive influence over the emotional regulation abilities of typically developing children, such relationship is understudied in autistic children. In the present study, we aimed to examine the relationship between parenting styles and emotional regulation abilities. We hypothesized authoritative parenting style would predict more conducive and fewer maladaptive coping strategies while authoritarian and permissive parenting styles would predict fewer conducive but more maladaptive coping strategies in autistic children. Forty-one autistic children aged between 39 and 115 months and their parents were recruited in Hong Kong for this study. The children were instructed to perform two tasks designed to elicit frustration. Their behaviors were videotaped, coded, and categorized into constructive, venting, avoidance, and disruptive strategies when regulating their emotions. We also considered their chronological age, autism characteristics, and verbal abilities, and their parents’ level of authoritative, authoritarian, and permissive parenting styles. Our study showed that authoritarian and permissive parenting styles were associated with maladaptive emotional regulation strategies such as avoidance and disruptive strategies. In contrast, there was no correlation between authoritative parenting styles and the use of different types of emotional regulation strategies. Venting strategies were shown to be negatively correlated with verbal abilities but not autism characteristics. Parents’ behaviors associated with authoritarian and permissive parenting styles may influence autistic children’s emotional regulation abilities. Therefore, we suggest parents adopt a lower level of authoritarian and permissive parenting styles in daily-life interactions.\n\nABSTRACT\n\nBackground: Autistic children always encounter difficulties in engaging in various play acts. Their parents can play a critical role in their play development. Among the different strategies adopted by parents, modelling, which involves parents demonstrating play acts to their children, can help the latter to develop play skills through observation and imitation. However, very little is known about whether modelling during parent-child spontaneous interactions might influence the production of play acts in autistic children, in comparison to other strategies, such as suggestion, command, and imitation. The present study addressed this issue, and we hypothesized that parents’ modelling of play acts was positively associated with autistic children’s production of play acts. Method: Thirty-seven autistic children aged between 73 and 114 months (M = 92.1) from a special school in Hong Kong and their parents were recruited for this study. The parents were instructed to play freely with their children for 20 minutes. The sessions were videotaped and coded. The children’s play acts were categorized into sensory, relational, functional, and symbolic play, while the parents’ play strategies were categorized into modelling, command, suggestion, and imitation. Results: After controlling for chronological age, autism severity and intelligence, the multiple linear regression showed that the parents’ modelling strategy was significantly and positively associated with the number of their children’s play acts (B = .217, p = .046). Conclusion: The modelling of play acts by the parents is associated with their autistic children’s play acts. It is advisable for parents to demonstrate play activities in daily-life interactions.\n\nABSTRACT\n\nThis paper details an action research project to enhance student learning in a Sustainable Innovation Project module, integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI), specifically leveraging ChatGPT. The primary objective was to improve the efficiency and quality of empathy interview question generation and insights extraction. Traditionally, students grappled with formulating effective interview questions, requiring significant guidance from the lecturer. Empathic inquiries, emphasizing \"What, How, When, and Where,\" demand contextual application with heightened sensory acuity, including listening and observational skills which unfortunately are not taught to students. Experimenting with ChatGPT, the AI capabilities were harnessed to construct profiles of interviewees and anticipated interview outcomes. Results demonstrated ChatGPT's swift generation of pertinent interview questions tailored to specific contexts, optimizing time for both students and the lecturer. This streamlined process allowed more instructional time for analyzing, evaluating, and enhancing the quality and utility of questions for the interviewing phase. Additionally, AI was applied to distill insights from the extensive interview data. Students often struggle to derive meaningful conclusions from diverse data sources. By inputting key data points and providing prompts, ChatGPT offered various framing scenarios, aiding in understanding users' perspectives and guiding potential problem-solving directions. Evaluation surveys on the student learning experience indicated that the AI innovation positively impacted project work, with most students valuing critical discussions spurred by AI-generated insights. Teacher observations affirmed more profound and critical conversations among the majority of students, providing them with more opportunities to practice critical thinking. The AI-driven discourse allowed students to refine and confirm their thinking, fostering a deeper engagement with the material. However, challenges arose, particularly in constructing effective prompts. Future enhancements will include an induction for students on crafting well-structured questions and probing techniques to extract optimal responses from AI, thereby reducing cognitive bias when thinking of interview questions. In summary, this action research underscores positive learning opportunities through the integration of AI, particularly ChatGPT, in streamlining empathy interviews and insights generation. The technology facilitated deeper critical conversations among students, yielding insightful perspectives for future problem framing and solving.\n\nABSTRACT\n\nFlipped classroom (FC) has become a popular alternative learning mode to traditional teacher-centered instruction. However, studies on using FC in Chinese language teaching have been scarce. This study aimed to investigate the instructional design and practices of Hong Kong teachers who implemented FC in their Chinese language classes during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study involved 3469 students and 210 teachers from 6 primary schools and 10 secondary schools who participated voluntarily. A student and a teacher version of the FC questionnaire were designed based on the instructional principles of FC to measure teachers' self-reported and students' perceived instructional design and practices of the FC activities in their Chinese language classes. The study’s findings revealed that Hong Kong Chinese language teachers did not frequently incorporate FC into their classes. While quizzes and student sharing were the most frequently used types of out-of-class eLearning activities, teacher-centered lecturing and questioning remained the major types of in-class activities. Both teachers and students reported a high degree of alignment between FC instructional design and practices in their Chinese language classes and the instructional principles of FC. Comparisons between primary and secondary schools indicated that primary school teachers used FC more frequently, designed more diversified learning activities, and showed higher degrees of alignment with FC instructional principles. The study highlights the potential of using FC for Chinese language learning and provides recommendations for improving FC practices in this context.\n\nABSTRACT\n\nThe teaching-learning process is highly altered by cutting-edge technology that supports learners' direct and indirect experiences and serves as a driving force to achieve educational goals. Multimedia-Based Instruction (MMBI) evolved as a robust measure and tool, resulting in more visually stimulating materials synchronized in the form of text, audio, video, graphics, and animation. MMBI materials essentially support the students to understand the abstract nature of mathematics and substantially increase their interest and curiosity. The way that multimedia affects a learner's sensory memory and operates in working memory to transfer information into long-term memory as an experience (Mayer-2001). Through its language, mathematics computes every element of learning to establish a stable equilibrium, including rationale and explanation. However, a learner's dislike of mathematics and avoidance produces a painful mental condition that results in a significant problem called Mathematics Anxiety. Research findings are always looking for ways to help students become less anxious about maths and become more adept of solving mathematical problems to solve this conundrum. Freud’s (1896) psychoanalytic theory reveals that anxiety is an unconscious mind when the subconscious mind experiences in various way that affects the conscious mind’s action-oriented process. Polya (1945) emphasizes that students must comprehend the problem as a whole and develop, devise, carry out, and reflect on the plan of action to be proficient in learning mathematics. This conceptual paper aims to explore, how Multimedia-based instruction (MMBI) supplements and serves as the best tool and technique for the learners' actions in mathematics learning to reduce their mathematics anxiety by improving their sensory perception of problem-solving ability. This paper also highlights how the learner comprehends mathematical knowledge to develop and perform various mathematical problem-solving abilities invariably influenced by multimedia instruction. Keywords: Multimedia-Based Instruction (MMBI), Mathematics Anxiety (MA), Mathematics Problem-solving ability (MPA).\n\nABSTRACT\n\nThe One-parameter-logistic (1PL), Two-parameter-logistic (2PL), and Three-parameter-logistic (3PL) IRT models are the three common IRT models used for an assessment. Since the Four-parameter-logistic (4PL) model has been rekindled to give its practical meanings, it has also become popular. As such all 4 IRT models are capable of incorporating into an assessment. Currently, most applications of IRT utilize the 1PL, 2PL, 3PL, and 4PL singly to understand and evaluate an assessment, referred to as the specific-parameter approach. The study suggests a mixture of parameter specifications with a combination of 1PL, 2PL, 3PL, and 4PL to examine whether this approach provides a better fit for setting up an English assessment. This mixed-parameter approach is compared to the specific-parameter approach on their model fit, item fit, and person fit. A graphical procedure with a prior parameter setting is proposed for identifying the appropriate IRT model for the items. This is a straightforward graphical approach with easy visualization, by examining the item characteristics curves to identify the appropriate IRT model for the individual items. The results from a secondary analysis of upper primary student achievement data show that this new approach provides better item fit and comparable model and person fit. The global model fit statistics indicate this mixing approach gives a better fit in comparison to the four specific parameter models, justifying using the mixed-parameter modeling approach. As this approach allows for the incorporation of 1PL, 2PL, 3PL, and 4PL into a single model, it solves partially the issues of retaining items that are misfitted. It not only allows keeping the misfit items without removing them by changing the item characteristics with the specification of the appropriate model, but it also allows for the incorporation of guessing and inattention parameters into the same model that makes the assessment closer to practice and real happening in a test reflecting appropriate item characteristics. It also introduces for purpose of examining the social desirability using the guessing parameter and building the inattention parameter in CAT to capture early careless mistakes made by high-ability examinees. The paper recommends the mixed-parameter approach for future research.\n\nABSTRACT\n\nThis article aims to present guidelines for the development of the education curriculum in English major of Thai higher education institutions in Postmodern era.

Methodology: The research started from surveying students' needs assessment about the board game for enhancing the quality of life. The samples were 336 undergraduate students of the faculty of education of Kasetsart University who were obtained by convenience sampling method in 2022. Then, researchers developed the board game based on these students' needs and World Health Organization’s quality of life domains including physical, psychological, level of independence, social, environment, and spirituality/religion/personal beliefs. The one-group pretest-posttest design was used for studying changes in quality of life from playing the boardgame. Students' satisfaction was evaluated by using questionnaires after playing the game. The samples were undergraduate students from the faculty of education of Kasetsart university acquired voluntarily by accepting 30 volunteers in 2023. Findings: The board game was developed from students’ needs including mental quality of life, independence, social, and World Health Organization’s quality of life domains. The required boardgame features were focusing strategy, developing skills, and colorful which used in the game. The results of comparing the students’ quality of life before and after playing the game showed that students had a statistically higher average quality of life scores than before playing at 0.05 significantly (T=3.14, DF=32, P=0.004). Students (80.56%) said that board games can enhance students' quality of life. While some students were not sure about enhancing quality of life because the game was designed to use strategies in simulation game. It was probably different to do in real life. The results of students' satisfaction found that students had a high level of satisfaction with the board game. The top 3 highest levels of satisfaction were overall satisfaction (M=4.33, SD=0.68), overall content benefits (M=4.33, SD=0.68), and board game durability (M=4.11, SD=0.85).\n\nABSTRACT\n\nResearch has pointed out the importance of teaching multimodal literacy in language and literacy education and various challenges facing teachers in different educational contexts. Yet, there is still insufficient research addressing how to support teachers to develop their competence in teaching multimodal literacy in context-responsive ways. This paper explores the development and enactment of a pedagogical framework for developing multimodal literacy through research-teacher collaboration in a design-based research study. Drawing on an integration of multiple theoretical conceptualizations, namely the Multimodalities-Entextualization Cycle (MEC) (Liu & Lin, 2021), metalanguages for print-based and digital multimodal texts (Lim & Tan-Chia, 2023) and Bloom's taxonomy (Bloom, 1956), the pedagogical framework aims to provide a systematic way to inform teachers regarding what to teach and how to teach multimodal literacy in their own context. Conducted at a secondary school in Macau, the study collects data from multiple sources, including researcher-teacher co-conceptualization and co-design meetings, post-lesson sharing sessions, classroom observations and co-designed materials. The findings will illustrate the dynamic interaction and negotiation between the researcher and the teacher, as well as how they work together to create a synergy of theoretical and practical perspectives in the process of developing and exploring the pedagogical framework in order to incorporate multimodal literacy into the curriculum to suit the students’ needs through their collaborative journey. The findings will provide important implications for developing teachers’ capacity for teaching multimodal literacy in contextually responsive ways and contribute to the on-going development of multimodal pedagogies globally.
