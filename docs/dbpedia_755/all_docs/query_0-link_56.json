        "text": "This is the Primary school that I studies before. The Sekolah Rendah Kebangsaan Chung Hwa a.k.a SRB Chung Hwa (Chung Hwa Primary School). I study year 1 at the year 1987 when I was 6 years old, and I have to study until year 6. I finish my year 6 at 1992 when I was 12 years old.\n\nThis is the block when I first come to study. Now they had repaint the building, back in my days the paint is faded and there are no writing on the walls.\n\nThis is the classroom that I first used; now it had become the classroom of Year 5C. Last time it was called Year 1C. They had divided all the classroom into 3 classes, class A, B and C. Near to my classroom the place where they put the fire extinguisher, I use to play there along with my school mate.\n\nI remember there is one time when my school mates and I draw picture on the wall, and when our teacher found out. She punish us to wipe off our masterpiece *hahaha* luckily she didn’t cane us that time.\n\nMoving to the second floor, this is where the Music class held back in my days, it is the first door on the right. Now I’m not sure what class it is. There is a lot of red lantern hanging on the classroom door; cause is Chinese New Year when I visit back my school.\n\nI am not sure what the age of this mirror is, but it is hung there since I study. Now is more that 20 years…better take a shot at it. Still can see my reflection, I can send this photo to “The Mirror Project” (www.mirrorproject.com).\n\nThis block belongs to Year 2 and 3 back in my days. My class is at the ground floor the first door I was in Year 3C that time.\n\nThe canteen, if not mistaken my break time is at 10.00 am – 10.30 am. There are only morning session, in the evening is for curriculum class, and tuition class. Last time I always feel that the canteen is big. But now when I visit back, I feel like the canteen is not that big at all. When the break time bell rang, my friends and I will rush to the canteen to dig for food. But there is always a long queue at the canteen.\n\nMove along to the next classroom, this block belong to the Year 4. Now it had become the Library.\n\nSome moral writing on the wall to remind the students to be good, at this wall they had wrote about the bad habits. Like don’t be greedy, liar, proud, bad, cheat, anger, and etc. Some of the words had exceeded my Chinese level, sorry folks some I cannot translate. Need to look in the Chinese dictionary.\n\nThen is Year 5, and 6, year 6 is the last year at primary school, and we need to sit for an exam that is set by the government to proceed to secondary school. The UPSR exam, I didn’t get very well in my exam but I didn’t get bad results either, I was in the average level. I did get an A for my English, and that’s the only A I got. I feel regret sometime cause didn’t get good marks in my exam, to make my parent proud. Hope they will forgive me.\n\nThis is the hall; I will have my assembly every Monday morning. Talk about the assembly now when I recalled back, I had forgotten what the headmaster was always talking about during the assembly. I only remember we had to queue up in guys’ one roll, girls’ one roll. And need to sign the national anthem at the beginning of the assembly and the school anthem after the assembly.\n\nI had sneaked into one of the classroom; the tables are still the same wooden table. But the chair had upgrade to plastic chair, last time I am using wooden chair.\n\nThis Chinese New Year greeting card made by one of the student is very interesting. I think her name is Sharon CHwa; she had a very special wish. The rest I don’t want to mention, what interesting is that she had wished the “Peace to the world”!! Well Sharon I hope your dream will come true some day :)\n\nI also have big dream when I was a kid, but when I grow up I realize things are not as easy as it looks.\n\nThe scariest place at S.R.B Chung Hwa school. OMG~~!!! The dental clinic….arrrr…run for your life. It’s coming...\n\nI found this banner near to the assembly stage, it goes like this “To drugs say NO, NO, NO” and “To ecstasy DESTROY, DESTROY, DESTROY”\n\nLadies and Gentlemen, behold the (fake) headmaster of S.R.B Chung Hwa Primary school...\n\nLabels\n\nMount Singai at Kuching Sarawak Infographic Mount Singai Basic Introduction In Kuching, besides the Mount Santubong , Mount Singai is one of the most prominent mount, where average hikers will reach up to more than 100 people on a normal weekend. Mount Singai is 550m above sea level, I climbed the mountain countless time. This is a sacred mountain which owns by the Bidayuh people (one of the local Sarawak ethnic group) Bi means people, dayuh means land. The various Bidayuh tribes, such as the Bisingai, Bijagoi, Bratak, Biperoh, Pinyawa, Bisapug, Bisitang, Biatah, Bibukar and Sadong, had different places in the mountains in the old days as places of refuge for defense purposes. Special traditional rituals and ceremony are being perform on the summit of the mountain. Now the Catholic Memorial & Pilgrimage Centre is located in the middle of this mountain. For people who like exercise, this is the perfect place to come. There are stairs built to ease the\n\nWith just around 320 meters above sea level, the Bung Jagoi it's one of the most family friendly trail available in Kuching. The trail is super easy to hike, and suitable for children and old people, a good weekend gateway. Not to forget it also has a very nice viewpoint on the summit peak. And if hiking is not your cup of tea, you can also bring your family to the waterfall, just a few mins hike at the base of the mountain. There is a big parking space for your car, a few ringgit per car. This is a restaurant, and we paid our entrance fees here. They also offer daily tour package, which includes food. A friend of mine bring his 70+ years old mother and two young children to hike together, and impressively she made it to the summit. A waterfall trail just below the mountain. Good for children, as I know my children like to play in the water more than hiking to the summit. Very clear water from the mountain. view along the way to the summit A souvenir shop a few mins before t\n\nBung Bratak is located at Kampung Tembawang in Bau, a hill that's takes about 30 minutes to reach to the heritage center on the top of the ridge. Previously it was once the Bidayuh hill settlement of seven longhouses. The trail are covered by fallen leaves, and quite a lot of mosquito along the trail. Oh yes, durian season soon Entrance fees its RM10 per entry, I told the reception that I dont intent to visit the heritage center, as I'm planning to just hike and then descent. However, the reception is kind enough by just allow me to go in and visit the place. Mount Singai can be seen from the entrance of the heritage center At the heritage center, they have a Bidayuh traditional round house known as the ‘baruk’, a dining hall with kitchen and a reception hall Another way up to the heritage center, a cement road. But they only allow 4WD car to drive up, because some section are steep. Safety concern normal car migh\n\nPugu Beach situated at Lundu, after Pandan beach. Drive all the way up you will see road sign showing where is the beach location. Its a long stretch of beach, which lead all the way to the river mount of Sungai Sebako Besar. My friends and I decided to visit the place, and stay at the resort hut which we paid RM50 per night. Pugu Beach is about 7.11km long from bukit Gondol. The day I visited, was a hazy day. Partly due to the heavy burning on our neighboring country Kalimantan. A panoramic view of the Pugu Beach, the view are very nice if you are at the top of the bukit Gondol. A small hill on the other end of the beach. Enjoying the time hanging out with my buddies. Long time did not meet up with them, and camping together with them. Hope in future, we can have time to go for adventure together, just like old time. This is a simple resort hut, they also have a toilet and washroom. But they don't sell food, so we have to bring our own food and water.\n\nTop 3 waterfall in Kuching to go with family and friends easily Santubong Waterfall Kubah National Park Waterfall Gunung Gading National Park Waterfall As an explorer in Kuchicng, one of the question that I’m frequently being asked is “Which waterfall can I go over the weekend with my friends/family” What people want are: Easily access within 1 hour Near to the place they park Have public toilet and bathroom Can barbeque Then I start to put on my thinking cap, and listed a few. Among that I chose these three as the top, and I hope that this can serve as a guideline for you when you visit Kuching, and would like to visit the waterfall. The Santubong Waterfall How to go? Santubong is located on the North of the Kuching city, with just 35KM away from town. A 45 minutes car ride to reach the Santubong Mountain. The entrance is before the Santubong resort, and on the right there will be a power station, the entrance is just next to the power station"
