That is because \"attention time\" is short. That's why children can really do well in Show & Tell e.g end-of-year show (K1,K2)\n\n​\n\nHence the instruction design/strategies must be correct.\n\n​\n\nI am familiar with the subject type - cognitive, affective or psychomotor.\n\n​\n\nThis helps me in developing their physiology and behavioral aspects in learning new syllabuses. It also helps to grow their minds and in character building.\n\nAnne Lazarus.
