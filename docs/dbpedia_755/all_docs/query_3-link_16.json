        "text": "A Chinese independent high school (simplified Chinese: 华文独立中学; traditional Chinese: 華文獨立中學; pinyin: Huáwén Dúlì Zhōngxué) is a type of private high school in Malaysia. They provide secondary education in the Chinese language as the continuation of the primary education in Chinese national-type primary schools. The main medium of instruction in these schools is Mandarin Chinese using simplified Chinese characters.\n\nThe United Chinese School Committees Association of Malaysia (UCSCAM, the association of Chinese school trustees, simplified Chinese: 马来西亚华校董事联合会总会; traditional Chinese: 馬來西亞華校董事聯合會總會; pinyin: Mǎláixīyà Huá Xiào Dǒngshì Liánhé Huì Zǒng Huì), also known as the Dong Zong (simplified Chinese: 董总; traditional Chinese: 董總; pinyin: Dǒng Zǒng), coordinates the curriculum used in the schools and organises the Unified Examination Certificate (UEC) standardised test. Despite this, the schools are independent of each other and are free to manage their own affairs.\n\nChinese independent high schools represent a small number of high schools in Malaysia. The number of Chinese independent high schools differed among sources, ranging from 60 to 63, due to the ambiguous status of SM Chong Hwa Kuantan and whether branch campuses count as separate schools. In 2020, UCSCAM adopted the \"60+2+1\" formula in describing the number of Chinese independent high schools:[1]\n\n60 Chinese independent high schools originated from the aftermath of school conversions in the 1960s\n\n2 branch campuses of Foon Yew High School (Kulai branch and Bandar Seri Alam branch)\n\n1 private school allowed to participate in the UEC examinations (SM Chong Hwa Kuantan)"
