        "text": "This is the third of our five-part weekly special report on Chinese medium education in Sarawak\n\nFIVE of the 14 Chinese independent secondary schools in Sarawak are located in the southern zone – Kuching and Serian.\n\nThey are Chung Hua Middle School (CHMS) No.1, CHMS No.3, CHMS No.4, SM Min Lit Batu Kawa and Serian Public Secondary School (SPSS), founded from 1958 to 1968.\n\nEven though Chinese is the medium of instruction, Bumiputera students are studying in these schools – thanks to their holistic approach to education.\n\nThe Bumiputera students enrol in Chinese primary schools before applying to enter Chinese independent secondary schools.\n\nCHMS No.1 has nine Bumiputera students, CHMS No.3, CHMS No.4 and SPSS have four each while SM Min Lit Batu Kawa has one.\n\nLocated at Jalan Penyau off Jalan Tun Razak, CHMS No.3 carried out major upgrading of its multi-purpose hall last year to give the school a new look.\n\nAccording to the principal, Lee Chee Beng, CHMS No.3 is one of two Chinese independent secondary schools in the country, offering a vocational class with an automobile repair module; the other one is in Perak.\n\nThere are over 60 Chinese independent secondary schools in Malaysia.\n\nCHMS No.3 used to be a small-scale school with fewer than 300 students.\n\nLee, who took over as principal in 2016, has improved the enrolment rate over the years with the school now having 620 students.\n\n“There was a time the school was thought to focus on vocational teaching, deterring parents from sending their children to study there,” he told The Borneo Post.\n\nWhen Lee became principal, he took steps to create a better understanding by parents of the school’s role and functions.\n\nHe made the effort to promote the school’s events and activities on Facebook to keep parents informed.\n\nAlthough CHMS No.3, like any other Chinese independent secondary schools, emphasises the learning of three languages – Chinese, Bahasa Malaysia (BM) and English – Lee said focus was also given to character-building.\n\n“We want our students to excel academically but we also want them to develop good moral and ethical attributes and values.\n\n“Given our present scale, we cannot compete with schools like CHMS No.1 but we will continue striving to get there. What we want is to provide a conducive learning environment.”\n\nHostel facilities\n\nAccording to him, CHMS No.3 is the only Chinese independent secondary school in the city with hostel facilities. Outstation students are mostly from Sri Aman, Bau and Siburan.\n\nThere are also international students – 10 from China and one from Indonesia. International students pay four times the fees of their local counterparts.\n\nPresently, CHMS No.3 has 12 classes for the Junior section and eight for the Senior section. There are 51 teachers.\n\nFor next year’s intake, the school already has 110 students on the registration list from a target of 130.\n\n“At most, we can open only four new classes due to the present number of classrooms. For now, we have between 30 and 34 students per class.\n\n“The good news is there will be a science stream for the Senior section, starting next year. It’s the first time this is being done since the school was set up in 1958 to help CHMS No.3 grow and improve academically,” he said.\n\nBefore 2021, the school has an arts stream and vocational class for senior-level students. The vocational class also offers subjects like Chinese, BM, English and maths.\n\n“This is to give the students better options should they decide to not pursue vocational studies. As long as they have the basic foundation, they can pursue other careers,” said Lee, who was with CHMS No.1 before he was appointed CHMS No. 3 principal.\n\nUEC exam\n\nAfter completing six years of studies, students of Chinese independent secondary schools will sit for the Unified Examination Certificate (UEC) exam, managed by the United Chinese School Committees’ Association of Malaysia (Dong Zong).\n\nLee who has over 20 years of teaching experience in Chinese independent secondary schools, noted that UEC holders could pursue tertiary education not only in Taiwan and China but also non-Mandarin speaking nations such as Australia, New Zealand, the US and Europe.\n\nHe said he had not come across parents who sent their children, pursuing secondary education in government schools here, to universities in Taiwan or China.\n\nIncepted in 1975, UEC conducts exams for Junior and Senior levels — eight papers for the former (Chinese, BM, English, maths, science, history, geography and art) and 22 for the latter (Chinese, BM, English, maths, advanced maths, advanced maths I, advanced maths II, history, geography, biology, chemistry, physics, business studies, book-keeping and accounts, accounting, economics, computing & information technology, art, basic circuit theory, principles of electronics, digital logic and fundamentals of electrical engineering).\n\nTo date, more than 300 private higher education institutions have recognised UEC and certificate holders can apply for professional courses, twinning programmes and other tertiary courses.\n\nOn top of that, over 1,000 overseas national and private higher learning institutions across the globe have recognised UEC and offered direct entry to the holders as well.\n\nConsiderable improvements\n\nMeanwhile, SPSS principal Huang Ping said the school had made a lot of infrastructural improvements in the recent years – thanks to the continued support of Serian MP Dato Sri Richard Riot Jaem.\n\nShe added that Riot had been giving Minor Rural Project (MRP) grants of between RM5,000 and RM20,000 annually to the school over the last decade.\n\nNot only has the Sarawak United Peoples’ Party (SUPP) deputy president been helping the school with MRP allocations yearly, he also made a grant of at least RM150,000 for its upgrading project.\n\nBukit Semuja assemblyman John Ilus had also made a grant of RM5,000 to the school last year.\n\nHuang was proud to announce that SPSS is the only Chinese independent secondary school in the Southern Zone to provide four buses for students to commute to and from the school.\n\n“SPSS also advocates small-class teaching and promotes student-centred instruction where teachers are the facilitators. Such instruction mode helps students to better engage in learning and creates a conducive learning environment.\n\n“Apart from imparting knowledge, our emphasis is on instilling wholesome values to mould the students’ characters properly and holistically,” she said.\n\nSPSS now runs eight classes – three for the Senior section and five for the Junior section – with a combined total 174 students.\n\nBoth sections charge a monthly fee of RM50 and RM35 each for seniors and juniors respectively.\n\nAccording to Huang, the eight classes are well-ventilated with air-conditioning to provide a healthy learning environment.\n\nEach class is equipped with a projector and a big whiteboard to improve the teaching-learning process and academic performance.\n\nShe said given its tranquil setting along Jalan Bukit Ensuna in Serian, SPSS is ideally located for learning and studying.\n\nMost affordable fees\n\nAs for SM Min Lit Batu Kawa, the principal Chai Chung Cheen said the school offers the most affordable school fees among all the Chinese independent secondary schools in the city – RM100 per Junior section student and RM130 per Senior section student.\n\n“Min Lit is also the only Chinese independent secondary school in Kuching offering a discount for school fees across the board during the Movement Control Order (MCO) period.\n\n“We have textbooks on loan for free to students. At Min Lit, the teacher-student ratio is 1:10, making it easier for our teachers to monitor the students’ performance.”\n\nThe school has 10 classes in total – six for the Junior section and four for the Senior section. There are 236 students and 20 teachers.\n\nChai said the new three-storey building costing RM1.7 million, would be completed at year-end and ready for use next year.\n\nAccording to him, Chief Minister Datuk Patinggi Abang Johari Tun Openg granted RM500,000 in 2018 for the new block of 12 classrooms.\n\nAnd to encourage Bumiputera parents to send their children to Min Lit, Batu Kawa assemblyman Dato Sri Dr Sim Kui Hian has pledged to support five Bumiputera students who enrol in the school. This means they will be studying in Min Lit for free. This offer started three years ago.\n\nChai said the school’s only Bumiputera student so far had been doing well and had excelled in extra-curricular activities.\n\nFor more information on funding for Bumiputera students in the school, call 082-682788."
