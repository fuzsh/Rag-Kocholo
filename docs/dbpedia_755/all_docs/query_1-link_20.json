Not only was she a fellow student of the school, but since graduating from university Madam Kho has also been loyally serving CHMS for the past three decades.\n\nCHMS is one of the biggest private schools in Brunei with over 3,100 students in total, with 23% local Malay student registration. Although it is an impossible feat to remember each of the students, Madam Kho knows the name, roles, strengths and weaknesses of each of the 170 teachers under her wing.\n\nThe school plays a critical role in promoting cross-cultural understanding and exchanges in the community at the grass roots level. As well as this, CHMS has been a consistent recipient of the Brunei ICT Award every year from 2009 to 2013.\n\nA well-respected woman for her dedication to empower teachers and to inspire students to be future leaders, Madam Kho was awarded The Most Outstanding School Leader in Brunei in 2011 by His Majesty, The Sultan."
