        "text": "To provide quality education to Tiong Hwa community in Brunei, Kapitan China Ong Boon Pang and few dignitaries, after much effort, established a school called York Choi School in 1918. The school had a humble start where it only rented a two-story shop lot as its classroom without a building of its own.\n\nIn 1957, the government of Brunei subsidised the school and paid for the teachers’ salary, administration cost and the construction cost of the basic school facilities. Moreover, free lunch, and later changed into free beverage, was provided to fellow students from 1959 to 1969.\n\nIn 1970, the government withdrawing its financial support to the school fomented financial constraints in the Chung Hwa Middle School, BSB. The crisis was solved after the Tiong Hwa Community volunteered to support the school in a form of monthly donation and the kind benefaction provided by the philanthropic Kapitan China Awang Lim Teck Hoo and other board members.\n\nIn 1974, in line with the national policy, Friday was declared a weekend holiday. The school syllabus was adapted to echo the national syllabus where English and Bahasa Melayu were taught to primary students. After 1975, the medium of instruction of the school, except Mandarin, Bahasa Melayu, History, Music, Physical Education (PE), Arts and Moral, was aptly changed to English.\n\nIn 1982, a three-storey building was built to cater for the needs of kindergarten pupil. In May 1982, the school hall was upgraded and its named was officially changed to Darussalam Hall. The school marked a new milestone when Duli Yang Teramat Mulia Paduka Seri Pengiran Perdana Wazir graced the grand celebration of the school 60th anniversary. In November, the gala night, organised by the school alumni, successfully collected $241,937.80 with the establishment of the alumni education fund.\n\nIn 1983, the rules of the school board were amended and for the following year, election of the school boards abided by such amended rules. The new school canteen was open in 1986 and one year later, sixth form was launched at the school with a total of 11 students.\n\nAt the same year, computer was integrated as part of the extracurricular activities.The new meeting room and the school library were completed and one air-conditioned school bus was used. In December that year, seven students graduated from the sixth form. The new entry policy, where a credit in GCE O’ Level Bahasa Melayu was a prerequisite to study in Sixth Form, jeopardised the source of students and forced the school to cease its sixth form education later.\n\nIn 1992, the 70th anniversary celebration of the school was officiated by the Minister of Education, Yang Berhormat Orang Kaya Laila Wijaya Dato Pehin Haji Abdul Aziz Umar. On May 1995, one gala concert was held in Darussalam Hall to fund the fixing of air conditions for the staff room and kindergarten. $300,000 was successfull collected.\n\nIn year 2000, the school ventured into the cyber era and teachers from eight core subjects were requested to post their lesson plans online to make it convenient for students in their revision. Series of activities such as the Zhuan Deng camp and Duan Wu Exhibition were held. Express class was introduced from Primary 4 to Form 3 to expedite learning for students with excellent results.\n\nIn 2001, Kebawah Duli Yang Maha Mulia Paduka Seri Baginda Sultan Haji Hassanal Bolkiah Mu’izzzadin Waddaulah, sultan dan Yang Di-pertuan Negara Brunei Darussalam consented to visit the school. Beginning with the same year, the election of the new school board would be held once every four years. The construction of PE rooms for kindergarten and computer rooms for secondary were also completed at the same year, along with the CHMS Vision 2003 campaign.\n\nIn 2002, the school celebrated its 80th anniversary with much gaiety and an array of activities was held to commemorate the eventful year.
