        "text": "More than twenty-five years ago, one local Malaysian, Tan Chung Liang (Liang) arrived in the famed basement tunnel of HELP University (formerly located in Pusat Bandar Damansara) to begin his studies in Economics through the University of London (UOL) External Programme, now known as the University of London International Programmes.\n\nFrom the time Liang walked into the hallowed halls of HELP University, to the time he graduated in 2002, his university life was nothing short of amazing. “I made so many memorable friendships, some that still stand today,” he said.\n\nHis studies were peppered with numerous extracurricular activities like football, organising Christmas shows every year in the lower foyer, to producing awesome beats with Lewis Paragasam, one of Asia’s leading percussionists and an innovator of new trends in world music and the Asiabeat crew (a popular percussionist band founded by Lewis Paragasam).\n\nAs fate would have it, Liang’s educational journey did not culminate with him pursuing a career in Economics. Giving credit to learning what he learnt during his college education, Liang decided to take a more liberal pursuit by opening his first restaurant in Kota Kemuning, and getting signed onto a record label in 2004 to being the only male DJ in 2011 for Capital FM. Although his first F&B venture took a hit during the Covid-19 lockdown, he was fortunate enough to be able to open another restaurant named RedRedBotakHead in Gardens MidValley.\n\nDespite not fully utilising his Economics degree, Liang was still grateful to having developed a keen financial awareness of managing his finances without relying on a manager or talent agency. In fact, Liang credits learning the importance of time management from a talk given by Dr. Goh Chee Leong, from which he learnt the relevance of prioritising what should be prioritised and what should not be. This thought serves as a vital tool for anyone working in any phase of their lives.\n\nTrue to form, learning time management proved to be a valuable tool as Liang had to persevere when the local town council denied his restaurant license due to a baseless allegation. He credits his mental acuity and life-skills honed during his HELP days which helped push his determination into finally receiving his restaurant certification.\n\nHaving a passion is key to what a person should want in their life story. For Liang, it was his passion for connecting people through food and their love for music. This is his main focus in his life. To cook up memories through the love for food and good music as he journeys towards a ripe old age filled with amazing stories in his continued pursuits is what pushes him every day.\n\nIn parting, he wishes to remind students that their time in university, apart from the education, is the place where they will enhance their identity. You will invariably add skills, make new friends, extend your network, expand your mind, understand what you are capable of. And always push your limits.\n\nTan Jia Jin, who grew up in Taman Batu Permai, Kuala Lumpur, is progressing in 2020 as a final year candidate for the degree of the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE), University of London (UOL), BSc (Hons) in Banking and Finance (BSBF), conducted for all three years of study at HELP Academy’s UOL Department. He is recipient of the HELP-Chung Hwa full Financial Assistance for his studies.\n\nThe Head of UOL Department has just nominated Jia Jin for a LSE scholarship worth RM 11,000 for him to participate in LSE’s prestigious 3-week Summer School in July 2020 for a course entitled “International Journalism and Society”. He had scored 4 As in the first year of his BSBF course, is awaiting the full results for the second year and is expected to graduate with excellent grades.\n\nJia Jin is President of the UOL Student Council at HELP. He has also organised a series of talks on social/political/economic issues held at a Jalan Dungun café in the vicinity of HELP, providing intellectual leadership for his course mates, peers and the Damansara Heights community.\n\nHe completed his secondary school education at SMK Chung Hwa Independent High School, Kuala Lumpur, achieving 8 As and 2 Bs for his SPM (Malaysian Certificate of Education) in 2016, and 7 As and 3 Bs for his UEC (Unified Examination Certificate) in 2017."
