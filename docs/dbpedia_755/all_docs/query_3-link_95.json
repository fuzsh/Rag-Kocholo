        "text": "Look at all my stars!!\n\nSenior Member\n\n2,948 posts\n\nJoined: Jun 2007\n\nDear fellow Chinese, just wondering do you find any big difference between our Chinese counterpart whom received Chinese education vs English/National education?\n\nBased on my own feeling, plus some other Chinese who dealed with both Chinese educated vs English/National educated Chinese, we can pretty much tell between the 2 groups spot on, even if the person has gone tru international education like foreign uni or english based local college, because usually a person's mindset has been set by the time they finish highschool, because that is the place where students received the most education in their life, 5-10 hours of mandatory education per day in school.\n\n1st, the way they talk & present themselves will pretty much instantly give away what type of education they received when young. Chinese educated usually sound more self centered due to the Chinese grammar they are used to, compared to others where they sound more natural the way they speak.\n\n2.Chinese educated Chinese are better at doing fixed/repititive work & things that has been properly handed to them, they make little mistakes, but their mind are more fixed like a wood, with less imagination & creativity, while mixed educated Chinese tend to make more mistakes, and more relaxed & slack on their usual job, they are creative & tend to think out of the box more often, they probably aren't good at doing repititive work, but more on things like marketing/management/sales.\n\n3.Chinese educated Chinese are usually more sensitive, take jokes seriously even if it's an obvious joke, they will always remember the day you ridiculed them even if no harm was done even after 20 years and will tend to take grudge more & being unforgiving, while mixed educated Chinese are more open minded, can take more jokes & take no grudge on it. Today they fight, tomorrow best still buddies.\n\n4.Chinese educated Chinese are more insecure, especially when they are outside their comfort zone, they are easily bothered by small problems, and worry about small things that doesn't really matter, thus they are often unhappy or dissatisfied, and yet do nothing to change it. Mix educated Chinese on the other hand are more happy go lucky, they have less problem to blend in to new environment, they worry less about small matters, and usually look at the brighter side, if they see something they don't like, they try to change it instead of simply talking behind & do nothing.\n\n5.Chinese educated Chinese usually cannot accept things that doesn't happen according to plan, or accept things that doesn't make sense based on their knowlege, they don't think out of the box. Mix educated Chinese usually more open to new things, new ideas, new explanations & can accept reasons more easily.\n\n6.Chinese educated Chinese tend to take mistakes & failure seriously, maybe because the stringet policies implemented during middleschool days, it's a big FAIL if you get 50/100 in exam, it's a big offense for skipping half a day of school, it's an offense for not tucking in your shirt, being accustomed to these can make a person for uptight, careful but at the mean time discourage them to do & try new things because of fear of failling. Most of them will choose the safe path over the higher risk/higher return path. Mixed educated on the other hand, thanks to the lax in principles in the school system, tend to break & bend the rules more often and not fear any retribution about it, they are more willing to take risk, sometimes too willing, which is a double edged sword. They are not so uptight about things but also more careless while doing things.\n\n7.Chinese educated Chinese tend to take the usual path of going to college/universities and study subjects that they might not even have any interest in doing so, they are so used to being told that they follow everything their teachers & parents tell them to, without any questions. These are the Soldier type. While mixed educated Chinese tend to follow their heart instead, they might choose to work instead of going to college, choose arts instead of business, sometimes they think they are too smart to make their own decisions and ended up making the wrong decisions though.\n\nOverall, the Chinese education system produce more good students, good soldiers, good citizens, while Mixed education like English/National education produce more wild cards, interpreneurs, rempits which most likely will oversea their Chinese educated counterparts in the society. There's reasons why Singapore loves Chinese educated students so much because they make such a good law abiding hardworking citizen compared to their own education products.\n\nI'm not sure any of you guys actually agree with me on this though.\n\nNon-Chinese are welcome to discuss if you dealt with both groups of Chinese but please keep it civilized."
