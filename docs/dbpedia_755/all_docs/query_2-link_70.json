Marc Fey; Hugh Catts - Oral and written narratives in poor decoders and poor comprehenders: an examination of length, grammaticality, and quality\n\nAlthough most poor readers display problems with both word reading and comprehension, some show specific delays in one skill but strength in the other. Comparing and contrasting the language and cognitive profiles of these specific deficit subgroups is useful for testing theories of reading development and for identifying skills that might be useful as markers for early identification or as targets for intervention. This study examined oral and written narratives generated by children who were typical readers, poor comprehenders (PC; good word reading but poor comprehension), and poor decoders (PD; good comprehension, but poor word reading). Participants were a subset of 570 children who participated in a longitudinal study of language and reading development. Children were classified as PC, PD, or typical readers based on their composite word reading and reading comprehension scores in fourth grade. Picture stimuli were used to elicit spoken and written narratives from children in second grade (prior to classification) and fourth grade (concurrent with classification). Compared to typical readers, PCs produced shorter, less grammatical, and lower quality spoken and written narratives in both grades. Poor decoders' oral narratives were not significantly different from typical readers' in either grade, but their written narratives were shorter and lower quality in both grades, and less grammatical in fourth grade. Additional analyses are ongoing, but preliminary results suggest that oral narrative production tasks might be useful for identifying children at risk for reading comprehension problems, and that children with decoding deficits may need intervention to bring their written language performance up to par with oral language abilities.\n\nTop\n\nYusra Ahmed ()Rick Wagner - Modeling writing as a composite of transcription, language comprehension and working memory: a causal indicator model\n\nPurpose - Traditional models of writing have included three basic cognitive functions: planning, translating and reviewing. More recently, writing models have been expanded to reflect that writing involves additional cognitive and language processing such as working memory and oral language comprehension. However, current models of writing have used conventional representations of covariance structure models. In conventional structural equation models, indicators are defined as linear functions of latent variables. In an alternative representation, constructs can be defined as linear functions of their indicators, called causal indicators. Such constructs are not latent variables but composite variables. The present study seeks to test a causal indicator model of writing, whereby writing is defined as a linear combination of handwriting fluency, listening comprehension and working memory. Method - Participants included 316 boys and girls who were assessed annually in grades 1 through 4. Writing was assessed through a timed writing composition task. Measures of language comprehension included sentence level oral comprehension and two experimental measures of text level listening comprehension. Measures of working memory included two sentence level memory span tasks. Results - The proposed model of writing fit the data well across grade levels. No differences were found between genders. Discussion - Results suggest that writing is an extraordinarily complex strategic activity that operates under constraints of language comprehension and working memory. In addition, writing is dependent on basic transcription level skills.\n\nTop\n\nYusra Ahmed (Florida State University and Florida Center for Reading Research)Richard Wagner - Component skills of writing\n\nDr. Wagner is a discussant. He will integrate the four papers and discuss their findings in light of expanding our knowledge about component skills of written composition in various langguage.\n\nTop\n\nStephanie Al Otaiba (Southern Methodist University)Young-Suk Kim; Jessica Folsom ;Cynthia Puranik - Growth trajectories of writing for typical children and children with language impairment\n\nPurpose Growth trajectories of writing on a story prompt were examined for typically developing children and children with language impairment in English-speaking first grade. We also examined the relation of children's oral language and reading skills in fall to growth trajectories of writing across the year. Method A total of 304 first grade students participated in the study. Students wrote on a researcher created prompt in fall, winter, and spring. Students were assessed on vocabulary (WJ-III Picture Vocabulary), word reading (WJ-III Word Identification), and reading comprehension (WJ-III Passage Comprehension), and handwriting fluency in fall. Results Children with language impairment has significantly fewer number of total word written and number of ideas in fall and lower rate of change across time than typically developing children. On average, children with language impairment wrote approximately 15 words representing 3 ideas in fall and 23 words representing 4.5 ideas in spring. Typically developing children wrote, on average, 22 words representing 4 ideas in fall and 34 words and 6 ideas in spring. Children's reading comprehension in the fall was related to their growth trajectories in writing. Conclusions Children with language impairment were not only able to write fewer words in the beginning of the year, but also their growth rate in the number of words in written composition is slower. These results, in conjunction with a unique contribution of reading comprehension, suggests the importance of paying attention to language and reading skills in order to facilitate development of writing skills for first grade students.\n\nTop\n\nElizabeth Albro (US Department of Education, Institute of Education Sciences) - Discussant\n\nTop\n\nAlida Anderson (American University, Washington DC, USA); Candise Lin; Min Wang - Prosodic sensitivity in native and non-native English-speaking children with and without dyslexia\n\nPurpose. This study investigated children's detection of stress patterns across native (English) and novel (Mandarin, Dutch) languages. Participants included monolingual English speakers in grades 2-3 with dyslexia (RD=30) and normal reading development (NRD = 30). Previous research (Authors, in review) has shown children with NRD to be more sensitive to dominant stress patterns in English and Mandarin than children with RD; thus the current study examined whether children with RD and NRD: 1) differ in sensitivity to novel language stress patterns; and 2) use English stress cues to process novel language stress patterns. Method. Stress processing tasks were developed using disyllabic English nonwords, and Mandarin and Dutch real words with initial- vs. final-stressed syllable patterns. Children learned to associate word-level stress patterns with shapes to 'feed' an animated puppy on a computer screen (Thomson & Goswami, 2010). In the familiarization phase, the examiner demonstrated how the puppy ate English nonwords with dominant stress patterns. Practice and testing phases followed with 20 randomized English nonwords. The final generalization phase involved novel stress processing of 40 Mandarin and Dutch words in random order. Anticipated Results. The RD group was hypothesized to differ from NRD in being less sensitive to Mandarin and Dutch stress patterns. We also hypothesized that children with RD were significantly weaker than NRD in their generalization of English stress cues to their processing of Mandarin and Dutch stress patterns. Conclusions. These findings contribute to understanding of the role of prosodic sensitivity in reading disabilities, having implications for assessment and intervention. References Authors (in review).

Sci. & Disorders, University of South Carolina)Young-Suk Kim;Stephanie Al Otaiba;Danielle Brimo - The Influence of Linguistic Awareness Skills on Early Literacy Abilities of At-Risk Students\n\n* Purpose - We examined how phonemic awareness (PA), orthographic pattern awareness (OPA), and morphological awareness (MA) abilities contribute to the reading and spelling skills of kindergarten, first, and second grade children at-risk for literacy. We also investigated differences in PA, OPA, and MA skills by grade. * Method - We assessed the PA, OPA, and MA abilities of 107 kindergarten (N = 31), first (N = 42), and second grade students (N = 34) who were enrolled in a low SES school and primarily African American. We also evaluated their word-level reading, reading fluency, reading comprehension, and spelling skills. Measures used were both norm-referenced (e.g., CTOPP, TOWRE), and experimenter-developed tasks. * Results - Our findings suggest that different linguistic awareness skills influence different literacy skills at different ages. Kindergarten: PA and MA influenced spelling (reading tasks not administered); First Grade: PA, OPA, and MA influenced all reading abilities; PA and MA influenced spelling; Second Grade: MA influenced word-level reading; MA and OPA influenced reading fluency; OPA influenced reading comprehension and spelling. Overall, morphological awareness ability influenced all literacy skills across the three grades and the greatest amount of variance explained by the three linguistic awareness skills occurred for spelling. * Conclusions - Young children in the early stages of literacy development have and use different linguistic awareness skills and that these skills differentially influence various literacy abilities. Scores on the three linguistic awareness measures also revealed that children continue to develop these skills over time and that our measures were able to capture this development.\n\nTop\n\nDorit Aram (Department of Human Development and Education, Tel Aviv University, Israel); Shimrit Abiri; Lili Elad - How does parental writing mediation, and children's alphabetic knowledge, self-regulation and private speech while writing, predict kindergartners' early writing?\n\nPurpose: The study further explored the significance of previously identified parameters predictive of child's early writing: parental writing mediation, child's alphabetic knowledge, and self-regulation. In addition, it examined a parameter that has not yet been studied in relation to early writing -- child's private speech while writing. The study assessed the contribution of parental writing mediation to predicting child's writing beyond child characteristics (alphabetic knowledge, self regulation and private speech). Method: 49 children (M = 68.66 months) were videotaped while writing words with their parents and then writing words on their own. Measures of letter knowledge, phonological awareness, and self-regulation were individually administered to the children. Video analyses yielded parents' writing mediation styles and children's private speech levels. Results: Results showed that each of the child characteristics -- alphabetic knowledge, self-regulation and private speech, uniquely predicted children's writing. Beyond the variance that was explained by these characteristics, a further 8% of the variance in writing level was explained solely by parent's mediation. Together, the variables explained 75% of the variance in children's writing levels. Conclusions: Results demonstrate the importance of both practicing alphabetic skills and attaining high levels of self-regulation in the development of early writing skills. Furthermore, they show that private speech, which until now had not been explored in this context, has a significant role in children's writing development and should be encouraged at home and in educational settings. Lastly, the study emphasizes the significance of parents' mediation on young children's early writing, and parents should be guided and encouraged in this area.\n\nTop\n\nLuisa Araujo (Instituto Superior de Educação e Ciências)Luisa Araujo; Patricia Costa - What factors explain reading achievement in the Program for International Reading Literacy Study (PIRLS, 2006) in 20 EU countries?\n\nThe purpose of this study is to identify the factors associated with reading achievement. We measure the effects of variables identified in previous investigations using PIRLS data and variables identified in psycholinguistic research as predictors of reading attainment. Mullins et al. (2006) claim that \"PIRLS will provide a wealth of information that can be used not only to improve the reading curriculum and instruction for younger students, but also help in interpreting the results for 15-year-olds in PISA\" (p. 102). However, no evidence exists that students´ performance in PIRLS, in fourth grade, is related to literacy instruction (Shiel & Eivers, 2009) and although the relationship between students´ scores and some background variables at the student, household, school and class levels has been investigated, existing evidence is limited to individual countries (Bellin, Dunge & Dunzenhauser, 2010). We use multilevel analysis controlling for country effects and include student, class and school characteristics. Our model explains 43% of the variance in the achievement of the 93,113 sample. Findings indicate that home educational resources and students´ attitudes toward reading produce the wider differences, followed by children´s knowledge of the alphabet before school starts, language spoken at home and parental book reading. At the class level, we find small effects for teacher gender, class compositional effects and instructional approaches. At the school level, differences relate to parental occupational status, the percentage of students from economically disadvantaged homes, school climate and parent-teacher relationships. Importantly, these findings suggest that the reciprocal relation between alphabet knowledge and phonological skills is detectable at the fourth grade level and they have implications for policy related to curriculum design and equity measures (Piasta & Wagner, 2010).\n\nTop\n\nJoanne Arciuli (University of Sydney); Renae Nash - Prosody Awareness is Related to Reading Ability in Children with Autism\n\nProsody awareness has been linked with reading ability in typically developing children. While children with autism often have difficulty processing prosody and often have difficulties learning to read no previous study has looked at the link between explicit prosodic awareness and reading in autism. A total of 25 children with autism completed both word and nonword reading subtests from the Woodcock (WRMT-R: Woodcock, 1998) and two prosody awareness tasks: the Mispronunciation Task (Holliman, Wood, & Sheehy, 2010) and the Compound Noun Task (Whalley & Hansen, 2006). Data revealed significant positive correlations between prosodic awareness and both word and nonword reading. When we divided the sample into two groups based on word reading ability poor readers had significantly lower scores on the Compound Noun Task. These results indicate a link between prosody awareness and reading in children with autism and may assist in the development of reading interventions for this population.\n\nTop\n\nJane Ashby (Central Michigan University)Breanna Knudsen, Ana Archer, Madison Kloss, Morgan Bontrager, Hannah Faleer, Michelle Young - Phonological awareness, orthographic knowledge, and reading fluency in Grades 1 and 2: Online evidence from eye movements\n\nPurpose. We examined the interplay of phonological awareness, orthographic knowledge, and reading fluency in grades 1 and 2 by monitoring eye movements during phonemic awareness tasks, receptive spelling, and silent sentence reading. Method. Children performed the three tasks in one session, followed by offline measures of reading fluency. Measures included time spent looking at the target and distractors, the number of looks before choosing, sentence reading times, and percent correct. Results. First graders who were faster to choose the correct last phoneme match (but not the first) were also faster readers than those who made slower phonemic decisions. In the Grade 2 sample, however, phoneme matching performance associated with stronger reading comprehension whereas better spelling performance correlated with more fluent reading. Conclusion. This pattern suggests that faster readers developed more specific orthographic and phonemic representations of written words and relates that specificity to gains in silent reading rate as well as comprehension.\n\nTop\n\nKaren Au-Yeung (OISE UT);Becky Chen - English vocabulary development in English language learners in French immersion\n\nThis study investigated the English vocabulary development of English Language Learners (ELLs) in a Canadian French immersion program by comparing their performance with English first language students (EL1s) in the same program. Participants were 35 ELLs and 39 EL1s. Children were measured at three time points, at the beginning and end of Grade 1 and at the end of Grade 2. English receptive vocabulary scores of the EL1s were significantly higher than the ELLs at the three time points, whereas the ELLs' growth in receptive vocabulary was not significantly different from that of the EL1s. Overtime, a significant quadratic trend was evident. Both groups experienced faster growth in receptive vocabulary from the end of Grade 1 through the end of Grade 2 than from the beginning through the end of Grade 1. Regarding English expressive vocabulary, the EL1s had significantly higher scores at the beginning and end of Grade 1; whereas the ELLs experienced a faster growth rate from the beginning through the end of Grade 1. The ELLs' performance on expressive vocabulary was not significantly different from that of the EL1s at the end of Grade 2. For the EL1s, word reading and morphological awareness significantly predicted receptive vocabulary concurrently and longitudinally; morphological awareness also significantly predicted expressive vocabulary longitudinally. For the ELLs, morphological awareness significantly predicted receptive vocabulary concurrently but it did not predict expressive vocabulary. Results of the study suggest that ELLs develop faster in English expressive vocabulary than receptive vocabulary in a third language educational setting.\n\nTop\n\nSelma Babayigit (University of the West of England, Bristol) - The reading comprehension and narrative writing skills of children who speak English as an additional language: A multi-group structural analysis\n\nPurpose -The present study sought to address two research questions: a) what is the relative role of oral language and code level (e.g., word recognition and spelling) skills in children's reading comprehension and writing levels, and b) to what extent the observed pattern of relationships differ across the monolingual and bilingual speakers of English. Method - 102 monolingual and 81 bilingual speakers of English participated in the study, which was conducted in England (M = 115.42 months, SD = 3.64). Children's word recognition, spelling, reading comprehension (York Assessment of Reading for Comprehension), and narrative writing (WIAT) were assessed by standardized tests. Likewise, standardized measures of vocabulary, sentence processing, semantic fluency, and verbal working memory were implemented to assess children's oral language skills in English. Multi-group structural equation modelling analysis was conducted to examine the hypothesized models among each language group and to examine to what extent the observed pattern of relationships differed across the two language groups. Results -A monolingual advantage was observed on the oral language, comprehension, and writing measures. Reading comprehension and writing skills were significantly related to each other. The results have also revealed excellent model fit indices for both language groups and for both reading comprehension and writing. As anticipated, oral language made direct effects on comprehension and writing, as well as indirect effects through the code level skills. However, whereas oral language played a more significant role in reading comprehension, spelling played a more significant role in writing. The pattern of relationships was comparable across the two language groups for both comprehension and writing. Conclusions -The findings signified the importance of a) developing our understanding of the common component processes of reading comprehension and writing, and b) sustained and systematic support of the oral language skills of learners from minority language backgrounds.\n\nTop\n\nKatharine Bailey (Trent University); Nancie Im-Bolter; Keely Owens-Jaffray; Fataneh Farnia; Nancy J. Cohen - Thinking it through: Social problem solving in children with reading problems\n\nPurpose: Research indicates that children with reading disabilities have greater deficits in their social skills than children with other types of learning disabilities. It is possible that their social deficits are the result of ineffective or immature social problem solving skills. Method: Participants were 75 children between the age of 7 and 13 in four groups: 1) reading comprehension and decoding problems (n = 11), 2) reading comprehension problems only (n = 19), 3) reading decoding problems only (n = 7), and 4) typical reading ability (n = 38). Children were compared on measures of nonverbal IQ, semantic and syntactic language, and social problem solving ability. Results: The groups did not differ with respect to nonverbal IQ, age, or SES. Analyses showed that children with reading comprehension problems (either in isolation or with reading decoding problems) had the lowest language skills and least mature social problem solving ability. Children with reading decoding problems only presented with an interesting profile of strengths and weaknesses. This group was: 1) similar to peers with typical reading ability with respect to syntactic language ability, 2) similar to the other impaired groups with respect to semantic language ability, and 3) did not differ from the other groups in terms of maturity of problem solving skills. Conclusions: Results suggest that different reading profiles result in different patterns of strengths and weaknesses in both the language and social cognitive domain. Language based disabilities, such as reading comprehension problems put children at greater risk for social cognitive difficulties.\n\nTop\n\nDoris Luft Baker (Center on Teaching and Learning, University of Oregon); Michael Stoolmiller - Empirical examination of the reciprocal relation between reading comprehension and passage fluency in second grade\n\nPurpose: This study examines evidence for a reciprocal association between oral reading fluency (ORF) and reading comprehension (RC) in the context of theoretical frameworks proposed by Perfetti, 1999 and Fuchs, Fuchs, Hosp & Jenkins, 2001. Design: Passive Longitudinal Participants: 228 second graders at four schools in the Pacific Northwest. Measures: DIBELS Oral Reading Fluency (DORF; Good, Kaminski, & Dill, 2002) and EasyCBM Passage Reading Fluency (PRF), and EasyCBM Multiple-Choice Reading Comprehension (MCRC; Alonzo, Tindal, Ulmer, & Glasgow, 2006) measured in fall and spring. Stanford Achievement Test (SAT-10; Harcourt Educational Measurement, 2002) measured only in the spring. Data Analysis: Structural equation modeling focused on two distinct models, (1) a cross-lagged model predicting spring ORF from fall RC, and spring RC from fall ORF, and (2) a synchronous model predicting spring ORF from spring RC and vice versa controlling for respective prior levels in fall. Results: Regardless of the type of model (cross-lagged or synchronous) and regardless of how RC was represented in the model (MCRC, SAT-10 or latent), effects were significant in both directions. Conclusions: Prior research indicates ORF is strongly dependent on word reading skills and the current research indicates that it also depends on RC both across time (i.e., a cross-lagged effect) and within time (i.e., a synchronous effect). This confirms theoretical perspectives that ORF and RC depend on each other and are reciprocally related. Practical and theoretical implications will be discussed.\n\nTop\n\nLinda Baker (University of Maryland, Baltimore County) - Discussion\n\nThe final slot is filled by Linda Baker who will reflect on the four contributions.\n\nTop\n\nKaren Banai (University of Haifa); Rachel Yifat - Statistical learning, phonological awareness and letter knowledge in the preschool years\n\nPurpose: Several important reading precursors, e.g., phonological awareness (PA), rapid naming (RAN), letter knowledge (LK) were identified over the years, but these do not fully explain the variability in reading development during the early school years. Based on evidence that statistical learning (SL) accounts for unique variance in reading ability (Arciuli & Simpson, 2011) in school-age children and adults, we tested the hypothesis that statistical learning, or the ability to implicitly glean structure from on-going stimulus sequences, contributes uniquely to the explanation of variability in reading readiness in preschool children. Method: 69 children (ages 48-77 months) were tested on a battery of reading-related tasks. The contribution of SL to performance on RAN and phonological memory (PM) tasks was assessed by administrating each task twice: once using a stimulus set that allowed statistical learning (SL+) and once with a stimulus set that made statistical learning impossible (SL-). Subsequently, the contribution of statistical learning to phonological awareness (PA) and letter knowledge (LK) was tested using 2-stage regression analyses. Results: SL influenced performance in both RAN and PM tasks with moderate to large effect sizes. Furthermore, performance in the SL+ conditions explained unique variance in both PA and LK (&#946; = 0.26 - 0.56) even after accounting for the contribution of age and of performance on the SL- conditions. Conclusion: SL, or the ability to benefit from repetition of information, is significantly related to early reading skills; further research will determine whether it plays a causal role in reading development.\n\nTop\n\nIrit Bar-Kochva (University of Haifa, The Edmond J. Safra Brain Research Center for the Study of Learning Disabilities); Zvia Breznitz - Reading of Different Orthographies: Do Dyslexic Readers Adjust Reading Routines to the Type of Script Presented?\n\nPurpose. Regular readers were found to adjust reading routine to the type of script read. This study examined whether dyslexics share the same trait. Method. Participants were 27 regular and 26 dyslexic adult readers. Hebrew speakers were examined as they are skilled in reading two scripts transcribing the same Hebrew language: a phonologically transparent script (with diacritics), and a phonologically opaque script (without diacritics). Behavioral and Scalp ERP data were collected while participants completed a lexical decision task in the two forms of script. In an attempt to distinguish between visual and orthographic differences between the scripts, a non-orthographic task was added: squares were presented with or without meaningless diacritics, and participants had to decide whether they were tilted. Repeated-Measure ANOVAs were carried out, with stimulus (words/pseudowords/squares) and diacritics (with/without) as within-subject factors and group (regular readers/dyslexics) as a between-subject factor. Results. Behavior: Diacritics delayed reaction of dyslexics more than of regular readers. Electrophysiology: Around 170 ms (N170) stimuli with diacritics (orthographic and non-orthographic) evoked significantly higher amplitudes than stimuli without diacritics only in regular readers. The amplitudes of stimuli with and without diacritics (orthographic only) differed in this group also around 350 ms (P3), whereas dyslexics showed a similar difference only around 500 ms. Conclusions. The form of script affected reading-time of dyslexics more than of regular readers. However, greater and earlier differences in brain activity were observed in regular readers. Therefore, dyslexic may not be as flexible as regular readers are in adjusting processing to the script read.\n\nTop\n\nAdrienne Barnes (Florida State University); Young-Suk Kim; Beth Phillips - Young children's narratives: use of story structure and linguistic devices in story retell and story production\n\nPurpose Two primary research questions were What types of linguistic devices do prekindergarten, kindergarten and first grade students use to create coherence and cohesion in their story retell and story production? To what extent is the use of these linguistic devices correlated with children's listening comprehension, inconsistency detection, and text structure knowledge? Method The sample included 178 children (52 in prekindergarten, 63 in kindergarten, and 63 first graders) in high poverty schools in a north Florida district. Data were collected on inconsistency detection (ability to detect inconsistency in short stories), narrative comprehension and production, and listening comprehension [the listening comprehension Scale of the Oral and Written Language Scales (OWLS; Carrow-Woolfolk, 1995)]. Children's retell and production were transcribed into SALT and coded for inclusion of story structure elements and use of linguistic devices. Bivariate correlations were used to examine the relations of the use of linguistic devices to their listening comprehension, inconsistency detection, and text structure knowledge. Results Children in prekindergarten use fewer linguistic devices than kindergarteners, who use fewer linguistic devices than do first graders. The use of linguistic devices were moderately related to listening comprehension, ability to detect inconsistency in a short story (i.e., inconsistency detection), and ability to include key story structural elements in story retell and production. Conclusions The results suggest that children's use of cohesive devices in their narrative oral retell and production is an important aspect of linguistic knowledge that is still developing among children in pre-k to first grade from low SES backgrounds.\n\nTop\n\nMarcia A.

Whether the relation of these skills to reading comprehension differs between groups was also tested. Method - Students in 9th to 12th grades - half who met the passing standard on the state literacy test and half who did not - were screened for word reading skills. Those with word reading below the 20th percentile for grade were excluded from further study. The remaining 400 students were classified as average or struggling comprehenders based on their reading comprehension achievement (50 average and 50 struggling comprehenders per grade). Participants were assessed on word and world knowledge; inference-making skill; and memory and attention. Data were analyzed to look at differences between groups and grades, and for moderating effects of group on the relation of these skills to reading comprehension. Results - Over 30% of students who failed the state literacy test were excluded due to word reading difficulties. For the remaining average comprehenders and struggling comprehenders/adequate decoders, group differences were found on several tasks assessing word- and text-level skills and general-purpose cognitive abilities. Conclusions: Core problems in word decoding are important sources of comprehension problems in many older struggling readers. However, many older students have difficulty understanding what they read despite adequate word reading skills. Differences between average and struggling comprehenders and the importance of these differences for comprehension will be discussed along with the implications of the findings for assessment and intervention.\n\nTop\n\nLaura Barquero (Vanderbilt University); Scott Burns; Nikki Davis; Dwayne Dove; Lindsay Wilson; Sheryl Rimrodt; Laurie Cutting - Neurobiological correlates predicitng responsiveness to reading intervention in children with RD\n\nPurpose: This study investigated the relationship between pre-intervention brain activity and responsiveness to reading intervention for children with RD. Methods: Reading ability for 14 children with RD (age 8-17 years) was assessed with a standard battery that included Word ID, Word Attack, and Passage Comprehension. Prior to reading intervention, functional MRI scans were obtained during a single word-reading task in which participants made a word/non-word determination. Subsequently, each participant received 15 hours of phonics-based reading intervention with individually targeted level of instruction. Change scores in behavioral measures were used to rank order participants and a median split designated Responders (n = 7) versus Non-responders (n = 7). Whole brain analyses of fMRI data were performed to reveal pre-intervention differences between groups. Results: Whole brain analysis (p < 0.005, 70 voxel extent) revealed that prior to intervention, relative to Nonresponders, Responders exhibited increased activation in areas including bilateral middle occipital gyri (BA 18/19), left orbital/superior frontal gyrus (BA 11), and left fusiform gyrus (BA 37). Brain activity for Nonresponders relative to Responders was characterized by increased activity in right hemisphere areas that included inferior frontal gyrus (BA 45), middle temporal gyrus (BA 22), and middle frontal gyrus (BA 46). Conclusions: Children with RD who exhibited brain activity more closely resembling typically developing readers responded better to intervention than did children exhibiting the anomalous activation associated with RD. Differences in fMRI activation may be useful in predicting responsiveness to reading instruction.\n\nTop\n\nSara Beach (MIT); Elizabeth S. Norton; Ola Ozernov-Palchik; Abigail B.

Dyslexia, and dyslexia risk in young children, have been associated with a reduced mismatch negativity (MMN), an automatic, pre-attentive response to deviant auditory stimuli. However, it is not known how the MMN relates to behavioral deficits in developmental dyslexia or dyslexia risk classification. Methods We investigated MMN-behavior correspondence with an auditory oddball paradigm in 23 kindergarten children. We recorded 64-channel EEG while children heard syllables \"ba\" and \"da\" (90% standards/10% deviants). Dyslexia risk classification was based on behavioral measures of phonological awareness (PA), rapid automatized naming (RAN), and letter/letter-sound knowledge (LK). Results We found significant MMN attenuation over frontal sites in children at risk as compared to children who were not at risk. We further explored the types of risk associated with MMN differences. Previous studies have found that a reduced MMN to tones at midline electrode Fz coincided with familial risk for dyslexia; here, we found that the magnitude of the MMN to syllables at Fz was significantly correlated with PA and LK. RAN was not correlated with amplitude at Fz, yet we observed a different distribution of the MMN and found significantly less negativity in children at risk in RAN in left posterior regions. Conclusion These results suggest that dyslexia risk subtypes are associated with different characteristics of the MMN. MMN amplitude and distribution may identify children who go on to evince phonology-based or fluency-related reading impairment.\n\nTop\n\nNathalie Bélanger (Department of Psychology, University of California, San Diego); Rachel I. Mayberry; Keith Rayner - Dissociation of orthographic and phonological codes in signing adult deaf readers: how does the use of these codes relate to reading level?\n\nPurpose - Deaf people often achieve low levels of reading skills (Traxler, 2000). The hypothesis that the use of phonological codes is associated with good reading skills in deaf readers is not yet fully supported in the literature (Mayberry et al., 2011). With the experiments we will present, our aim was to dissociate the effects of phonological and orthographic information and also to relate our results to reading level. Methods - In two experiments, we tested 29 deaf adults who are readers of French and signers of Quebec Sign Language. Results from a masked lexical decision task and a recall task will be presented (Bélanger et al., in Press). Deaf readers in both experiments were separated into two groups according to their reading level: skilled and less skilled readers. Groups of skilled hearing readers served as control groups in all experiments. Results - The results show that skilled hearing, skilled deaf, and less skilled deaf readers used orthographic codes during word recognition and recall, but only skilled hearing readers relied on phonological codes during these tasks. Conclusion - Preliminary conclusions would suggest that deaf readers do not activate phonological codes during reading, and that phonological codes are not a determinant of reading level in adult deaf readers.\n\nTop\n\nGal Ben-Yehudah (The Open University of Israel)Dorit Shulman - Instructional order of contextual and morphological strategies influences reading comprehension in 3rd grade\n\nPurpose: The reciprocal relationship between vocabulary knowledge and reading comprehension (RC) is well established. This relationship has lead practitioners to develop strategies for deriving word meaning from text. This study explored the influence of instructional order of two such strategies, contextual clues and morphological analysis, on young readers' comprehension. Methods: 85 children attending 3rd grade in an Israeli public school participated in an intervention program that taught contextual and morphological strategies for inferring the meaning of novel vocabulary in text. Each experimental group received 14-hours of instruction in one strategy and then instruction switched to the other strategy. The order in which the strategies were taught was either context-morphology or morphology-context. A control group received instruction only on the contextual strategy. Participants' abilities were assessed pre-intervention and post-intervention using three measures: RC, morphological knowledge and vocabulary breadth. Results: Pre-intervention, the three groups did not differ on any of these measures. Post-intervention, we found a significant influence of instructional order on RC, with higher comprehension scores for the context-morphology group relative to the morphology-context group. A median-split of the data based on pre-intervention comprehension scores revealed that the below-median group benefited most from the context-morphology intervention, whereas the above-median group showed a surprising setback in performance following intervention. Conclusions: These findings suggest that (1) it is important to consider the order of instruction when teaching children strategies to improve RC, and (2) initial RC ability has a non-trivial influence on children's use of new strategies to derive word meaning from text.\n\nTop\n\nSabrina Benedict (Vanderbilt University); Nicole Davis; Esther Lindstrom; Donald Compton; Laurie Cutting - The role of phonology and orthography in children's morphological word reading skills\n\nPurpose: Morphology is known to relate to word reading. For example, word stem and suffix combinations may result in phonological and/or orthographic alterations to the root word; however, few morphology tasks measure the effect of these alterations. Furthermore, whether phonology plays a differential role depending on type of alternation is not understood. We present results from a task (MORPH) that investigated this relationship. Methods: 27 children (16 girls; x=11.3 years ±1.33) completed the Letter Word Identification (LWI) and Word Attack (WA) Woodcock Johnson subtests and the MORPH task. The MORPH task first presents word stems (MORPH-root) followed by these stems with suffixes (MORPH-suff), which were separated into 4 alteration types: no change (NONE), orthographic (ORTH), phonological (PHON), and orthographic/phonological (OR/PH). Accuracy was calculated by number of MORPH-suff items read correctly over total read. MORPH-root items read incorrectly were removed from analysis. Results: Performance on MORPH-suff alternations indicated that ORTH (x=83.13±20) and NONE (x=82.49±26.65) were easiest, OR/PH (x=67.11, ±20) was more challenging, and PHON (x=59.5, ± 33) was hardest. Repeated measures analyses indicated that NONE=ORTH (p=.81), whereas NONE and ORTH were easier as compared to both PHON and OP/PH (p<.01), even after accounting for WA skill. Poor readers showed a greater difference between the ORTHO and NONE versus PHONO and OR/PH (Condition x Group, p=.007). Conclusions: Results suggested variable performance across the four MORPH-suff alternations. Findings indicated that morphological combinations involving phonological alterations to root words cannot be fully explained by phonological decoding skill. Type of morphological change differentially impacts performance based upon reading skill.\n\nTop\n\nRachel Berthiaume (Faculté des sciences de l'éducation, Université de Montréal, Montréal, Québec, Canada); Daniel Daigle - Morphological processing tasks and measurement issues\n\nPurpose: Over the last 20 years, research in morphological processing (i.e. morphological awareness and graphomorphological processing) has been the main focus of many studies on the development of reading and writing skills (see, for example, Burani et al., 2008; Casalis et al., 2011; Deacon et al., 2011). These studies differ on several grounds such as the chosen theoretical framework and methodology. Method: We systematically reviewed more than 90 studies designed to investigate morphological processing in different populations and languages. Extracted information permitted us to highlight the main conceptual definitions used in this research domain and list all experimental tasks used. We then characterized these tasks according to hypothetical processes or knowledge bases, the associated morphological domain (inflection vs derivation), the nature of the material involved (oral and/or written) and task instructions. Results: Tables are used to highlight the remarkable variability found across studies on all criteria considered. Conclusions: The observation of this variability raises many issues that need to be addressed in future research. For instance, what is morphological awareness? How does it differ from morphological processing? What is implicit or explicit about morphological tasks? How are morphological tasks conceptually constructed? Tentative answers to these questions are proposed in order to set the stage for the development of a unified framework in the systematic study of morphological processing.\n\nTop\n\nPhillips Beth (Florida State University and FCRR); Galiya Tabulda; Pamela B. Webb; Smirti Jangra; T. Kayla Sedgwick - Syntax intervention in early childhood: Results from efficacy trials within three grades\n\nPurpose: The purpose of this project is to test the efficacy of three parallel 12-week small group interventions in prekindergarten, kindergarten, and first grade. The intervention targets syntax and listening comprehension skills plus mental state vocabulary associated with literate language and theory of mind. The research questions concern the impact of the interventions on syntax measures, listening comprehension passages, theory of mind measures, and for first grade, reading comprehension. Method: Approximately 130 children per grade were screened and 82 qualifying (e.g., scoring below the 40th percentile standardized syntax instruments) children were identified. Children were randomly assigned within school to receive 12 weeks of intervention within small groups (n = 40) or to business-as-usual (n = 42). The intervention addresses grade-specific syntax targets including prepositions, conjunctions, passive, and negation. Assessments include syntax subtests from the CELF-IV or CELF-P2, Oral and Written Language Scales Listening Comprehension, researcher created syntax and listening comprehension measures, and false belief understanding. Results: The interventions are ongoing and post-testing will be completed in late spring. Results from the prior year's design study trials in each grade showed educationally meaningful effects sizes relative to a receptive vocabulary counterfactual measure after just 3 week trials. Conclusions: Results from these studies will build understanding of how to effectively build language skills relevant to reading comprehension in children at high risk for reading difficulty. Preventative interventions such as this show promise in closing the achievement gap for children who enter formal schooling with language delays due to backgrounds associated with poverty.\n\nTop\n\nYiwen Bi ()Malatesha Joshi - How does the literacy knowledge of Turkish transfer to decoding and spelling in English and Spanish?\n\nPurpose Turkish is a transparent, agglutinative language. Spanish is also a transparent orthography, however, English is considered semi-opaque, even though all three languages use Latin script. So, do Turkish literates find it easier to decode and spell Spanish or English? That is the purpose of this study. Method Forty university students whose first language was Turkish and were literate in Turkish were administered the decoding and spelling portions of Woodcock Language Proficiency Battery-Revised (WLPB-R) and Woodcock-Munoz Bateria III. The decoding subtests were scored as right and wrong and the spelling performance was scored both quantitatively and qualitatively. It was predicted that Turkish literates would perform better on Spanish tasks than on English ones, because of the similarities in the orthographic depth in Turkish and Spanish. Results & Conclusions Statistics significance testing and regression analyses showed that Turkish literates performed better on Spanish tasks than on English ones. Qualitative analyses, by feature guide for spelling inventory (Bear, Invernizzi, Templeton, & Johnson, 2004) on specific phonemes, syllables and spelling stages, also reported that the performance of Turkish literates was better in Spanish than in English. The results were explained in terms of 'Orthographic Distance'. The findings indicated a better reading acquisition transfer from a transparent first language to a transparent second language, than to an opaque second language. Implications also focus on the orthography depth in second language teaching and learning. Reference Bear, D. R., Invernizzi, M., & Templeton, S., & Johnston, F. (2004).

Nese; Kelli Cummings; Patrick Kennedy; Julie Alonzo; Gerald Tindal - Individual moderators of within-year ORF growth: The role of student characteristics and grade level across grades 1-8\n\nPurpose. Recent research has suggested that within-year oral reading fluency (ORF) growth is non-linear; in early grades it is discontinuous, with greater growth in fall than in spring (Christ et al., 2010; Nese et al., in press). Most studies of ORF growth, however, incorporate only three testing occasions. This limits both the types of growth models that can be explored and the conclusions about the superiority of alternative theories of ORF development. This study aims to describe within-year growth in ORF across grades 1-8 and examine the extent to which grade level and student characteristics moderate average growth. Method. ORF was modeled with hierarchical linear modeling using six to eight testing occasions for approximately 1600 students across grades 1-8 (n &#8776; 200 in each grade). We determined best fit model of growth across grades and examined how student characteristics (e.g., special education status and demographics) moderated growth estimates. Results. Results indicate that in addition to grade level differences in intercepts, most grades showed significantly different instantaneous growth rates, with lower grades outpacing upper grades. Upper grades also demonstrated a weakening of the deceleration trend witnessed in lower grades. In addition, intercepts varied on average for students receiving special education or limited English services, but grade-level differences in the intercept differences were not consistent and no significant differences in growth rates were observed. Results suggest expected patterns of oral reading fluency growth change subtly across grades one to eight and that intercept differences do not go along with differences in growth.\n\nTop\n\nMaryse Bianco (Université P. Mendès France)Aurélie Nardy; françoise Toffa; Martine Rémond - Reading comprehension strategies from 8 to 11 years old children: what develops?\n\nPurpose: To study the development of reading comprehension strategies in children aged from 8; to 11; using a thinking aloud methodology. Method: 50 children (25 grade 3 and 25 grade 5) read aloud 2 narrative texts. At 6 pre-defined test points, they were asked to say aloud what they understood at that point in the story. Each verbal protocol was parsed into clauses that were categorized according to a coding scheme inspired from previous research (Kendeou & Van den Broek, 2005; Magliano & Millis, 2003). Reading and oral comprehension, reading fluency, working memory capacities as well as cognitive development (verbal and nonverbal) were further assessed. Results: Results showed several original trends: 1) As soon as grade 3, the children proved to be able to express appropriately their thinking; they used the same pool of strategies described for older children and adults. 2) Appropriate paraphrasing ability was evident by grade 3 (52% of the protocols) but erroneous paraphrasing halved from grade 3 to grade 5. 3) Monitoring and inference strategies revealed a great inter-individual variability, both within and between grades; it increasing with age (from 16% at grade 3 to 26,5% at grade 5). 4) Monitoring and inference strategies elicited during reading positively predicted overall reading comprehension performance (&#916;R2=.06, p=.05) while erroneous paraphrasing was negatively related to comprehension ((&#916;R2=.04, p=.05). Conclusion: The results extend the existing research by showing that reading strategies can be elicited with young children and that they distinguish high and low comprehenders early on the process of reading acquisition.\n\nTop\n\nFlorence Binamé (Florence Binamé)Aurélie Defraigne; Martine Poncelet - The acquisition of new orthographic representations among dyslexic children\n\nPurpose - In developmental dyslexia, spelling deficits have been much less explored than reading deficits, although the former tend to be more persistent than the latter. The aim of this study was to explore the ability to acquire new orthographic representations through different learning conditions in dyslexic children. Method - Fifteen dyslexic French-speaking children (mean chronological age: 11; 4 years; mean reading age: 7; 6 years), 15 chronological age (CA) and 15 reading age (RA) matched controls participated in the study. Their ability to acquire new orthographic representations was assessed through different learning conditions: isolated pseudowords decoding, text reading with embedded target pseudowords and writing of pseudowords after presentation in their visual form associated or not to a semantic representation. In each condition, ten target pseudowords were presented six times. Orthographic learning was measured by a dictation of the targets immediately after the learning session and one week later. Results - Orthographic learning of dyslexics was significantly impaired and decreased more over time relative to CA group but not to RA group. Otherwise, dyslexics, as other groups, performed better when learning conditions consisted in writing pseudowords than in decoding them. Furthermore the condition associating a semantic representation to the pseudowords did not enhance the performances in any group. Conclusions - These results confirm that decoding abilities are essential to develop orthographic representations and suggest that writing is a powerful learning mechanism in dyslexic readers as in RA and CA children. By contrast, a semantic representation seems not to support the development of orthographic representations.\n\nTop\n\nKatherine Binder (Mount Holyoke College); Khanh Vy Thi Nguyen; Scott Ardoin - Mindless reading in 2nd graders: An eye movement analysis\n\nPurpose: We examined the eye movement behavior of children as they read passages, and we detected when children engaged in off-task behavior. Thus, we examined the reading and \"non-reading\" behavior of children. Method: We measured the eye movements of 135 2nd grade children while they silently read a passage. We did tell the children they would be asked comprehension questions, and they should do their best reading. We also collected data on their decoding and comprehension abilities. Results: While most of the children did engage in systematic reading of the passage, nearly 25% of them stopped reading at some point during the passage. That is, they might have had typical eye movements for a few lines of the story, but at some point, their eye movements became erratic, and they either sped up their reading rate (skipping many words in the process) or they made random fixations throughout the rest of the passage. Our first goal of the study was to see if we could reliably identify the \"non-readers\". Then, we examined several aspects of the reading record to determine which eye movement behaviors changed as a result of the non-reading behavior. As a final goal, we tried to identify the cognitive profiles of children who engaged in non-reading behavior. Conclusions: We were able to reliably differentiate non-readers from readers, and the non-read sections differed from read sections on a number of eye movement measures. These findings have implications for the practice of sustained silent reading in the classroom.\n\nTop\n\nSiti Syuhada Binte Faizal (); Rebecca Treiman - Doubling medial consonants: The role of statistical learning in spelling\n\n*Purpose: Medial consonant doubling in English spelling is especially difficult. Even university students may be unsure whether to double the \"l\" in \"trellis\". In English, there are statistical patterns in medial consonant doubling, including more doubling after tense vowels than lax vowels, more doubling of consonants such as \"b\" and \"p\" than of \"v\", and less doubling before Latinate endings. We studied the influence of these patterns and spelling ability on participants' doubling of consonants in nonwords. *Method: We gave two nonword spelling tasks to 64 US university students, all native English speakers. In the choice task, participants heard a nonword and chose between two options, such as \"vonid\" or \"vonnid\". In the free task, they wrote down its best spelling. We analyzed the data using mixed-effects modeling, including item- and individual-level data in the same model. *Results: In both tasks, participants doubled more after tense vowels than lax vowels, and this was especially true for better spellers. They also doubled more with consonants such as \"b\" and \"p\" than \"v\". Participants were less likely to double before Latinate endings such as \"ic\" than non-Latinate endings such as \"ow\". Participants also doubled more when a nonword rhymed with a real word that has a doubled medial consonant. *Conclusions: University students appear to be sensitive to the doubling patterns in English. Even at the university level, however, spelling ability influences sensitivity to the preceding vowel context. Findings are discussed in terms of the role of statistical learning in spelling.\n\nTop\n\nJay Blanchard (Arizona State University)Herman Garcia; Kim Atwill; Glen Powell - The role of spanish proficiency in patterns of english reading skills development: a five year (k-4th) successive cohort study\n\nPurpose: This study examined the role of Spanish proficiency in patterns of English reading skills development across five years (K-4th) of school with successive cohorts of children. Method: All children were Spanish-speaking with minimal or no English skills upon kindergarten entry. Children's Spanish proficiency in vocabulary and phonemic awareness was evaluated in kindergarten. Using scores from these assessments, children were divided into three groups: Group BB children were below proficient in Spanish vocabulary and phonemic awareness; Group AB children were at or above proficient in vocabulary yet below in phonemic awareness; and Group AA children were at or above proficient in both vocabulary and phonemic awareness. (Note: Small sample size did not permit a BA group.) From kindergarten through fourth grade, children completed English reading skill assessments linked to vocabulary, phonemic awareness, word reading fluency, and reading achievement. Kruskal-Wallis non-parametric analyses were used to evaluate ranked differences between the groups with follow-up Mann-Whitney U-tests to investigate pair-wise differences. Results: The analyses yielded varied patterns of kindergarten Spanish proficiency influence, with differences related to group, grade level, and assessment. The Group BB patterns revealed children struggling to develop English reading skills and below national norms in reading achievement. The Group AB pattern revealed children making developmental progress in early grades, limited progress in later grades, and performing below national norms in reading achievement. The Group AA pattern revealed children making normative developmental progress. Conclusion: This research documented that, like their monolingual peers, Spanish-speaking children's first language proficiency in kindergarten plays an important role in their English reading skills development patterns.\n\nTop\n\nCatherine Bohn-Gettler (Wichita State University, USA) - Tracking causal information during reading comprehension\n\nPurpose When comprehending narratives, it is important to follow changes as the story unfolds. During reading, adults simultaneously monitor changes in time, space, characters, causation, and goals. However, adolescent readers do not simultaneously monitor these dimensions during reading, and instead only monitor causal changes while appearing to ignore other event shifts (Bohn-Gettler et al., 2011). The current study examined whether manipulating the causal relevance of spatial information would encourage spatial monitoring among adolescent readers. Methods Participants included 107 seventh-grade and 109 adult readers. Participants read narratives in which spatial information was causally relevant (experimental) versus not relevant (control) to the outcome (Sundermeier et al., 2005). After reading the outcome, participants indicated whether a target word representing the spatial information appeared in the story. Reaction times and accuracies were used to determine whether participants reinstated spatial information when causally relevant. Measures of reading comprehension and working memory were also collected. Results Hierarchical linear modeling was used. Although adults reinstated spatial information when it was causally relevant, adolescent readers did not. Among adults, better comprehenders were more likely to reinstate spatial information when it was causally relevant, but this effect did not occur for adolescents. Conclusions Therefore, manipulating causal relevance does not increase the likelihood the adolescents will monitor spatial information. These results support previous work that adolescent readers do not monitor multiple dimensions during the course of reading, but instead focus only on causation as a main effect.\n\nTop\n\nMarie-line Bosse (France, LPNC Grenoble); Nathalie Chaves - Lexical orthographic self-teaching during reading: effect of simultaneous versus sequential presentation\n\nPurpose - The self teaching hypothesis suggests that most knowledge about the orthographic structure of words is acquired incidentally during reading through phonological recoding. The current study assessed whether visual processing skills during reading further contribute to orthographic learning. Method - French children were asked to read pseudo-words, in a context of stories. The whole pseudo-word letter-string was available at once for half of the targets and the pseudo-word's sub-lexical units were discovered in turn for the other half. Presentation time and total time of processing were controlled. The memorisation of target orthographic forms was assessed immediately after reading or seven days after. Results - They showed that more orthographic learning occurred when pseudo-words have been seen in their whole. The whole-word presentation effect was significant whatever the delay between reading and orthographic restitution. This effect depended on neither target reading accuracy nor target reading speed during the reading phase. Moreover, analyses revealed that orthographic learning was independent of presentation time. Conclusions - Beyond recoding skills, the ability to process the entire orthographic letter string at once during reading appears as a significant factor of efficient orthographic learning. This new finding opens the way for a better understanding of the visual-orthographic factor in the self-teaching hypothesis.\n\nTop\n\nRyan Bowles (Michigan State University)Shayne B. Piasta; Kayla Musielak - Developmental interrelations of uppercase and lowercase letter name knowledge\n\nPurpose: Letter name knowledge (LNK) is well-established as a key predictor and perhaps causal agent in the development of reading. In light of this importance, it is crucial to understand the developmental progression of LNK. In this study, we examine the longitudinal interrelations of uppercase and lowercase letters name knowledge (LNK). Descriptive studies indicate that children tend to know more uppercase letters, suggesting that uppercase LNK temporally precedes lowercase. Some research has speculated that the relation is not merely temporal, but that uppercase LNK facilitates the development of lowercase LNK. However, this facilitation hypothesis has never been tested directly. Method: 289 preschool children were assessed on uppercase and lowercase LNK four times over the course of a school year at roughly 2 month intervals. LNK was assessed by asking the child to identify a single uppercase or lowercase letter displayed on a flashcards. Uppercase letters were assessed first, but within case, letters were randomly ordered, and the order varied across children. Data were analyzed with a cross-lagged regression model. Results: Uppercase LNK predicted lowercase LNK at the next occasion, but lowercase LNK did not predict uppercase LNK. For each additional uppercase letter known, children were predicted to identify .32 additional lowercase letters at the subsequent occasion. By contrast, the opposite cross-lag relation was .10 and not significant. Conclusions: Results supported the facilitation hypothesis. Generalization of uppercase LNK to lowercase appears to be an important way children learn lowercase letters.\n\nTop\n\nLee Branum-Martin (Department of Psychology); David J. Francis; Lama K. Farran - Phonological awareness in Spanish and English among Spanish-speaking first graders in Mexico and the US\n\n* Purpose Detailed item response investigations are confirming that phonological awareness (PA) items measure a latent trait of PA in English. However, few studies have been conducted on PA items in Spanish. The current study tested theoretically based hypotheses of trait versus method variance in a confirmatory manner in both Spanish and English. * Method Item responses were gathered from 2,832 Spanish-speaking first grade students from 3 projects in the US and Mexico, using 4 subtests of the CTOPP and its Spanish counterpart, including blending, segmenting, and elision tasks (78 total items per language). The hypotheses tested were (a) PA is a unitary trait without method variance, (b) PA is represented by related method factors, and (c) PA is a general trait, but with systematic method variance. Cross-language relations were also explored. * Results In Spanish, results among children in Mexico suggest that PA items measure a single latent trait with negligible method variance. For children in US schools, substantial method variance was found in Spanish items. In English, results suggest PA items measure a single latent ability, but with substantial method variance. * Conclusions The results corroborate prior findings that PA items in each language measure a single ability in Spanish speaking children, with method variance particular to the tasks used. Method variance in Spanish appeared to differ across US and Mexican samples. Cross-language findings imply that method variance for children at this age is non-ignorable, and may be due to familiarity or instruction.\n\nTop\n\nM. Anne Britt (Northern Illinois Univesity); Jennifer Wiley; Thomas Griffin; Brent Steffens; Project READi Reading, Evidence, and Argumentation in Disciplinary Inquiry Group - Instructional manipulations to support comprehension of history\n\nPurpose: In recent decades, we have learned a great deal about how to improve basic literacy skills of decoding and sentence-level comprehension. However, less is known about how we should instruct students to read-for-understanding in the disciplines. Modeled after Document-Based Questions on the AP History Exam, we have designed reading-for-understanding tasks to examine the challenges of comprehension in high school history classes. Method: Sixty-eight high schoolers and 73 undergraduates read a set of several document and used them to write an essay about the Panamanian Revolution with each presenting part of an underlying causal model with few explicit connections. Several different kinds of writing prompts were tested and comprehension was measured in relation to the completeness of coverage of the causal model of the event. Results and Conclusions: In an initial study, we found that high schoolers included a limited number of causal factors in their essays (M=26%) and that prompting students to write \"whether Roosevelt was responsible for the revolution\" led to an average of 10% fewer concepts mentioned than prompting them to write about the \"causes of the revolution\". Follow-up studies are examining the effects of additional prompts that may lead to better integration across multiple documents. Preliminary results suggest that prompting students to a role (e.g., senator at the time) is less effective than prompting students to consider different perspectives about a topic. We will discuss the results of these and other manipulations and how they seem to help high schoolers to integrate information across multiple documents.\n\nTop\n\nNuria Calet (Universidad de Granada); Nicolás Gutiérrez-Palma; Silvia Defior - Effects of fluency training on reading ability in spanish primary school children\n\nPurpose Reading fluency's contribution to reading comprehension has been explained through two main approaches: The theory of automaticity and the contribution of prosody. The first one highlights speed and accuracy as two main factors underlying reading comprehension whereas the second one states that prosody is a relevant factor in reading acquisition. Each one stresses different components of fluency. The purpose of this research was to examine the efficacy of two fluency interventions based on these two approaches. Method 122 Spanish primary-school children (74 second and 48 fourth graders) participated. Children were randomly assigned to automaticity training, prosody training or to a 'no treatment' control group. Intervention consisted of repeated reading with either a focus on speed and accuracy plus phonological and orthographic awareness training or on expressivity plus prosody awareness training according to the group. Multiple measures were used to determine the pre and post-intervention performance in reading fluency, expressiveness and reading comprehension. Results Results showed that both intervention groups made statistically significant gains in word and pseudoword reading accuracy, pseudoword reading time and efficiency compared with the control group. However, the performance achieved by the prosody group was significantly better than automaticity group with respect to levels of expressiveness when reading, prosody reading comprehension, word and pseudoword stress awareness and punctuation task. Conclusions Focus in reading with expressiveness was found to be a superior repeated reading method. The importance of prosody to reading comprehension in the primary grades is debated. The implications of multidimensional fluency for instruction are discussed.\n\nTop\n\nMary Beth Calhoon (Lehigh University)Yaccov Petscher - Individual and group sensitivity to remedial reading program design: Examining reading gains across three middle school reading projects\n\nUnlike beginning reading programs, there exists a dearth in adolescent literacy on how to best develop remedial reading program. When considering what might be effective for this population there is a critical need to understand how they develop reading skills and the factors that impact success in learning to read at this age level Therefore, the purpose of this analysis was to explore group and individual gains of adolescents (6th - 8th grades; N = 175) with reading difficulties (RD) response to three different organizational designs of the reading components (RC) within remedial reading programs. Two questions were explored: 1) What is the relationship between individual student gain and the different organizational designs of the RC for adolescents with RD? and 2) How does change in latent composites of phonetic decoding, fluency, and comprehension differ across the different organizational designs of the RC? A two-stage analysis was used to estimate individual differences for the outcomes. First, individual gain categories (low: <1year growth; average: =>1 year growth; and high: =>2 years growth ) were explored using grade equivalency scores derived from 'W-scores' to ascertain educationally meaningful gains. Secondly, latent change scores were used to describe phonics, fluency, comprehension change for each organizational design. Findings demonstrated that unlike beginning readers who respond best to simultaneous instruction in all the reading components, adolescents with RD appear to respond best to a sequential organizational design of the RC. Results will be discussed in terms of the effect of the different organizational designs of the RC within remedial programs.\n\nTop\n\nDavid Caplan (David Caplan); Gloria Waters; Julie Bertram; Jennifer Michaud; Adam Ostrowski; Dasha Bulova - Determinants of discourse comprehension in middle and high school students\n\nPurpose: Determine which oral language and reading component skills best predict written discourse comprehension. Methods: In 2009, 1,355 middle and high school students were tested on a battery of 11 tasks that assessed five levels of language-sublexical, lexical, morphological, sentential and discourse in each of the auditory and written modalities. Reaction time and accuracy was recorded. 1,836 students were subsequently tested in 2011on a modified version of the battery. Results: Exploratory factor analyses of the 2009 data led to a confirmatory factor analysis of the tests of sublexical, lexical, morphological and sentential processing in the 2011 data and resulted in 3 reliable factors in both modalities in middle and high school-recognizing forms of words, understanding words, and structuring and comprehending sentences. Structural Equation Models were formed on the basis of the CFAs to determine the relationship between these factors and written discourse comprehension. In middle school, the strongest determinant of written passage comprehension was understanding written simple and morphologically complex words, while in high school the strongest determinant was understanding written complex words and sentences. In both middle and high school the ability to recognize the forms of auditory and written words and understanding of words and sentences presented auditorily only showed indirect effects on written passage comprehension. Conclusions: The factors that best predict written passage comprehension reflect higher level language processing skills, and change across middle and high school with the effects of spoken language abilities seen through the mediating effects they have on written language .\n\nTop\n\nMarketa Caravolas (Bangor University); Arne Lervag; Betty Mousikou; Charles Hulme - Patterns and predictors of growth in silent reading in three alphabetic orthographies: Different rates, similar patterns.\n\nPurpose - The patterns of growth in efficiency of silent word reading and its predictors were investigated in a 2.5-year multi-language study of school beginners learning relatively inconsistent (English) and highly consistent (Czech and Spanish) alphabetic orthographies. Two questions were investigated: 1) Does reading development in English differ from that in the consistent orthographies? 2) Do phoneme awareness (PA), letter knowledge (LK) and rapid automatized naming (RAN) (measured in preschool) explain variance in growth in both the early and later phases of development, and do their impacts differ as a function of orthographic consistency? Method - A total of 523 children (English n= 185, Czech n = 150, Spanish n = 188) were assessed on the test of word reading efficiency six times (twice a year) over 30 months - beginning in preschool. Results/conclusions - The development of reading in these orthographies fitted a piecewise growth model with four growth constructs (initial reading status, early linear slope, acceleration of early linear growth and later linear growth) very well. All groups performed similarly on the reading measure at the start of the study, but further growth differed. The Spanish and Czech children had a slower start, followed by faster acceleration (relative to English) once formal reading instruction began, and then underwent a phase of slower growth in second grade. The English children showed steadier development throughout the whole period. PA and RAN predicted early growth equally strongly in all three orthographies, but LK, while predictive in all groups, was more important in the consistent orthographies.\n\nTop\n\nJoanne Carlisle (University of Michigan) - Discussant\n\nJoanne Carlisle will be the discussant for this symposium and will reflect upon the findings and themes related to the presentations. She will also address future directions related to unraveling the relationship between morphology and literacy.\n\nTop\n\nRobyn Carson (University of Ottawa); Alain Desrochers - How grapheme type, word length and word frequency influence word reading accuracy across the primary grades: Evidence from French\n\nPurpose: This study investigates the effects of four variables on word reading accuracy of children in Grades 1 through 6: word graphemic structure, length, and frequency, and school grade. Word reading accuracy was expected to be greater for shorter words with higher frequencies and simpler graphemic structures. The effect of these variables was expected to decrease with years of schooling. Method: A sample of 817 French-speaking students from Grade 1 to 6 were asked to read 192 French words orally. The stimulus list was constructed from a factorial design involving the presence of 4 different types of words (regular words with simple graphemes, with complex graphemes, with contextual graphemes, and irregular words with exceptional graphemes), 2 levels of word frequency (high versus low), and 2 levels of word length (4 versus 8 letters). Data collection was carried out in a quiet room in children's schools. Results: A mixed-model ANOVA revealed a significant effect of all four independent variables. Words were read more accurately when they had a simpler graphemic structure, a higher frequency of use, and when they were shorter; accuracy increased from Grade 1 to Grade 6. Significant interactions indicated that the frequency effect was particularly pronounced with inconsistent words, and the effect of all item variables decreased as years of schooling increased. Conclusion: These results reflect the magnitude of the obstacles young children need to overcome when they learn to read a semi-regular language, like French, with several types of graphemic units.\n\nTop\n\nSéverine Casalis (Université de Lille 3 Charles de Gaulle, Lille, France) - Morphological processing in delayed readers\n\nPurpose : The present study examines whether and how morphological information is processed by dyslexic readers in word reading. There is some evidence that dyslexic readers do process morpheme-sized units rather than grapheme-sized units when decoding. Previous studies suggest that dyslexic children make a greater use of morpheme. However, extant results do not specify (1) whether morphological information is automatically activated in dyslexia, suggesting a morphological organisation of the lexicon or (2) if the activation of morphological information is based on similar properties in dyslexic and normal readers. The aim of the present study is to investigate morphological organisation of the lexicon in dyslexic children via the masked priming paradigm. Method: 20 dyslexic children (11 years old), 20 reading age control normal readers, and 20 chronological age normal readers participated in the study. They performed a visual lexical decision task under masked priming. Three categories of primes were used: morphological, orthographic control and unrelated. In addition, two prime durations were used, 55 ms and 80 ms. Results: No priming was observed at the shortest prime duration in the dyslexic group and the reading age control group, while the older normal readers displayed morphological priming. At the 80 ms prime duration, priming was observed in all groups but the amplitude of priming differed across groups. The observation of morphological priming in dyslexics confirms that morphological activation in this group is also quick and automatic. Conclusion: Methods of investigation of morphological processing in dyslexics are discussed.\n\nTop\n\nChristina Cassano (Boston University) - Patterns of growth in phonological awareness and vocabulary during preschool and kindergarten: An individual growth modeling approach\n\nPurpose: The purpose of this study was to examine: (1) how phonological awareness and vocabulary knowledge change with time for each child and; (2) if the differences in phonological awareness (e.g., initial status, direction and/or rate of change) are related to vocabulary knowledge (i.e., receptive, expressive, and definitional) and grammatical skill. Theoretical Framework: Vocabulary accounts for unique amounts of variance in phonological awareness tasks in preschool and kindergarten (e.g. Storch & Whitehurst, 2002). The lexical restructuring model (LRM) is one explanation for the relations between PA and vocabulary. LRM suggests that phonological awareness develops as a function of vocabulary knowledge, because as the size of child's lexicon grows, more attention to segmental information is required to detect differences in phonologically similar words (e.g., cat, kite, cut). Thus, phonological representations become increasingly more specified, first, as syllables, then as onsets/rimes, and ultimately as phonemes. Whether or not a larger vocabulary provides a benefit to the development of PA, and which type of vocabulary knowledge may be most beneficial, is not well understood. Additionally, practitioners often overemphasize PA instruction because of its influence on word recognition skill (Paris, 2005). The problem is, other learning, such as vocabulary and content knowledge, which are critical for longer term reading comprehension, may not receive adequate attention. A strong emphasis on PA may result in short term word recognition gains; however, if vocabulary is neglected, there are likely to be significant negative consequences for future reading comprehension. Method: Data were collected from (N=61) children ages 30-71 months recruited from two suburban preschools and divided into three aged cohorts (3-, 4-, and 5-year olds). Standardized and researcher-designed phonological awareness, vocabulary, and grammar assessments were administered every three months over a year (baseline and 3,6, and 9 months later). Results: Preliminary analyses indicate that receptive (nonlinear) , expressive vocabulary as well as grammatical skill are significant predictors of phonological awareness (p=.03, p<.001, and p=.001 respectively); however, they vary in the timing of their influence. Receptive vocabulary had a additional significant effect on the rate of growth in PA for 3-year olds (p=.021) reflecting a steeper rate of growth for this age group. Expressive vocabulary had a negative slope for 3-year olds reflecting a shallower rate of growth for them (p=.007) and a steeper rate of growth for the 4- and 5-year olds. The intercept, linear term for receptive vocabulary, definitional vocabulary and gender were not significant in the growth curve models. Conclusions: Overall, the observed variation in PA growth rates are positively related to receptive and expressive vocabulary, and grammatical skill. There is variation in the way receptive and expressive vocabulary are related to growth in PA that is tied to age-group and consistent with vocabulary development (receptive precedes productive language) as well as the lexical restructuring model (e.g., Metsala & Walley, 1989). Consistent with previous research, definitional vocabulary, essential for reading comprehension, was not related to growth in phonological awareness indicating that depth of knowledge did not provide additional \"payoff\" for PA (Ouellette, 2006).\n\nTop\n\nHugh W. Catts (Florida State University)Diane Nielsen; Mindy Bridges; Yi Syuan Liu - Multi-step approach to screening for reading disabilities\n\nPurpose: In this study, we compared a two-step screening process for early identification of reading disabilities to a traditional approach in which a full screening battery is administered to all children. Method: All eligible kindergarten children in a midsized school district were selected in two consecutive years (N=366). Children were administered a battery of screening measures at the beginning of the school year. This battery included Letter Naming Fluency (LNF) and Initial Sound Fluency (ISF; DIBELS), RAN, sound matching (CTOPP), sentence imitation (TOLD-2P) and several other experimental measures. Reading outcome was assessed at the end of second grade by the Woodcock Reading Mastery Tests-Revised. Results: Preliminary results are available for Cohort 1; Cohort 2 data available by May. In the first analysis, logistic regression procedures were employed to find the best combination of predictors of reading outcome. In a second analysis, a two-step approach was taken. First, we used screening and outcome data to identify a cut score on LNF, above which, almost all children turned out to be good readers. Next, we used logistic regression analyses to find the best combination of predictors for those children performing below the LNF cut score. Results showed that the two-step process eliminated the need to give the full battery to 1/3 of the children and resulted in only a small loss in overall accuracy compared to a one-step traditional approach. Conclusion: Results suggest that a multi-step screening approach can be an efficient and accurate alternative to a traditional screening approach.\n\nTop\n\nGina Cervetti (University of Michigan); Elfrieda H. Hiebert; P. David Pearson; Alison Billman - Factors that Influence the Difficulty of Science Words\n\nThe research on vocabulary acquisition offers well-tested ideas about general characteristics of instruction that result in vocabulary learning. Our understandings about what makes particular words easier or harder to learn, and how that knowledge might impact the selection and instruction of words, are less well-developed, particularly in content-area instruction. This two-part study examines the relationships between word characteristics, word knowledge, and word learning in the domain of science at the elementary level. Study 1 is an exploratory study considering the relationship between the characteristics of 92 science words and second- through fourth-grade students' knowledge of these words before a science instructional intervention. We used regression analysis to examine the predictive value of seven characteristics of words to pretest score on measures of vocabulary knowledge. These characteristics, which represent research-based linguistic indices of word complexity, are polysemy, domain specificity, concreteness, part of speech, length, frequency in written language, and frequency of morphological family. Four of these characteristics predicted students' knowledge of words prior to instruction (frequency, word length, polysemy, and morphological frequency). These results suggest that rare and multiple-meaning words may be unknown to students and may require different forms of instruction. In Study 2, we used the word characteristics to predict both knowledge before instruction and also growth in knowledge during an eight-week science-literacy instructional intervention. Results of Study 2 are pending. This two-part study contributes to understanding about frameworks for selecting words for vocabulary instruction in science.\n\nTop\n\nYou-Hsuan Chang ()Yi-Fen Su, Hsueh-Chih Chen - Error analysis of Chinese character recognition among learners of Chinese as a second language with different levels of Chinese vocabulary sizes\n\nPurpose: The study intended to analyze types of errors during Chinese character recognition and to compare differences in error types between CSL learners with smaller and larger Chinese vocabulary sizes. Methods: 62 CSL learners were recruited and assigned in two groups according to their Chinese vocabulary sizes. The targeted characters were randomly selected out of 6097 frequent characters in the Chinese Orthography Database (Chen, Chang, Chou, Song, Chang, 2011) and divided into ten levels according to their frequencies. Students were asked to type the pronunciations of characters using phonetic symbols. The errors made by the students were classified into eight types: graphic error (including graphic similarity, radical deriving, radical analogy), phonetic error, semantic error, graphic-then-phonetic error, semantic-then-phonetic error, graphic-then-semantic error, graphic-phonetic-then-semantic error, and miscellaneous. The scorer reliability of error analysis was .96. Results: The study found that the three most common error types were graphic confusion, phonetic confusion, and graphic-then-phonetic confusion. Moreover, phonetic confusion was the highest-rated error among the group with smaller Chinese vocabulary sizes. Furthermore, regarding subtypes of graphic confusion, in both groups, the most common errors were those of graphic similarity, the least common were of radical analogy. Conclusions: The results reveal that the character recognition error patterns of CSL is the same as children in Taiwan, meaning children with smaller Chinese vocabulary sizes more commonly made phonetic errors. As their Chinese vocabulary sizes increases, they implicitly acquire knowledge of the sound value of phonetic radicals, which they may use to infer the pronunciation of unfamiliar characters.\n\nTop\n\nLi-Yun Chang (University of Pittsburgh); Hsueh-Chih Chen; Susan Dunlap - Orthographic configuration and radical position effects in learning Chinese by Spanish and Thai speakers\n\nPurpose: This study examined orthographic awareness of Chinese as a factor in Chinese second language (CSL) learning. Based on the Transfer Facilitation Model (Koda, 2008), we hypothesized that first-language background would affect Chinese character identification via a visuospatial orthographic perspective, separate from the grapheme-phoneme mapping process. Methods: CSL learners with contrasting orthographies in L1-Spanish and Thai-participated in two experiments that assessed their knowledge of Chinese orthographic structure. They were asked to compare two artificial characters and choose the one that was more like a real character. Experiments 1-1 and 1-2 investigated learners' awareness about configuration types in a legal-illegal structure comparison and a high-low legal frequency comparison, respectively. Experiment 2 examined learners' awareness concerning radical position. Results: Both L1 groups exhibited awareness about configuration types and radical positions of Chinese characters. In Experiment 1-1, Thai speakers had a higher rate of detection for legal configurations than Spanish speakers. In Experiment 1-2, there was a main effect of frequency, though not in the expected direction. Participants preferred medium frequency configuration more than high frequency configuration; however, low frequency was least preferred, as expected. The results of Experiment 2 showed the prominent role of position-based radical frequency as well as the different patterns between Thai and Spanish speakers. Conclusions: This study demonstrates the psychological functioning of configuration type and radical position for learners of CSL. Moreover, it suggests that L1 background has an effect on the acquisition of visuospatial information in Chinese characters.\n\nTop\n\nYu-Jen Chang ()Chih-Yu Yang; Shih-Jay Tzeng; Hwa-Wei Ko; Chih-Chien Yang - Rapid Naming and Character Recognition Predict Developmental Trajectory of Children's Oral Reading Fluency\n\nPurpose This longitudinal study investigated the developmental trajectories of Chinese oral reading fluency in curriculum-based measurement (CBM) and general outcome measurement (GOM) from 1st grade to 6th grade. Moreover, we also examined how these two growth rates of oral reading fluency are related to non-verbal IQ, phonological awareness, and rapid naming. Method 115 first graders, 113 third graders and 117 fifth graders were administered two types of oral reading fluency seven times in subsequent two year, along with measures of rapid naming, phonological awareness, character recognition, and non-verbal IQ in the beginning. Using piecewise growth curve analysis, models of growth in three different grade phases (1st-2nd, 3rd-4th, and 5th-6th) were linked for the complete developmental trajectories of oral reading fluency, and then the significant predictors of growth rates of CBM and GOM were identified. Results Results indicated that although oral reading fluencies of CBM and GOM improved with age developmentally in elementary school-age children, the rate of growth in GOM was larger than CBM one. Regardless of grade phrases the participants were in, both naming speed and character recognition were important for the initial status of oral reading fluency. However, among these predictors, character recognition uniquely appeared to have significant influence on the growth rate of performance in 1st-2nd phase, only naming speed in the 3rd-4th phase, and none in 5th-6th phase. Conclusions Findings suggest that naming speed and character recognition are important predictors of reading fluency development before the end of 4th grade.\n\nTop\n\nMichelle YH Chang ()Nora Raschle; Nadine Gaab - Examining functional brain differences in pre-readers at risk for dyslexia during a classical Eriksen Flanker task\n\nPurpose: Developmental dyslexia (DD) is a learning disability characterized by difficulties with accurate and/or fluent word recognition, poor spelling and decoding. There is strong evidence for a genetic basis. Structural and functional brain alterations have been reported in children with a diagnosis of DD and pre-reading children with a familial risk of DD. To date, the relationship between reading ability and executive function skills remains underexplored. In the current study, we used a variation of a classical executive functioning task in pre-reading children with (FHD+) and without (FHD-) familial risk of DD. Methods: 30 right-handed children (16FHD+/14FHD-; mean age: 5.9y) completed standardized psychometric testing. Whole brain functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was performed during a modified Eriksen flanker task (response inhibition) with congruent, incongruent and neutral trials in an event-related fMRI design. Results: FHD- children performed significantly better (p<0.05) than FHD+ children on behavioral assessments of expressive language, phonological processing and rapid naming, but not nonverbal IQ. Furthermore, during in-scanner performance all children demonstrated a significant flanker effect (p<0.05). Preliminary imaging results revealed decreased activation in bilateral dorsolateral pre-frontal areas of the brain in FHD+ compared to FHD- children for the 'incongruent > fixation' contrast (p<0.001). Conclusion: Our results suggest that pre-reading children with a family history of DD already show a disruption during response inhibition in brain areas that are commonly used in typically developing children. Future studies will look at the longitudinal developments of these networks and its relationship to developing reading skills."
