        "text": "Identifying persistent and characteristic features in firearm tool marks on cartridge cases\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nOtt, Daniel; Soons, Johannes; Thompson, Robert; Song, John\n\n2017-12-01\n\nRecent concerns about subjectivity in forensic firearm identification have motivated the development of algorithms to compare firearm tool marks that are imparted on ammunition and to generate quantitative measures of similarity. In this paper, we describe an algorithm that identifies impressed tool marks on a cartridge case that are both consistent between firings and contribute strongly to a surface similarity metric. The result is a representation of the tool mark topography that emphasizes both significant and persistent features across firings. This characteristic surface map is useful for understanding the variability and persistence of the tool marks created by a firearm and can provide improved discrimination between the comparison scores of samples fired from the same firearm and the scores of samples fired from different firearms. The algorithm also provides a convenient method for visualizing areas of similarity that may be useful in providing quantitative support for visual comparisons by trained examiners.\n\nImaging Characteristics of Pathologically Proven Thymic Hyperplasia: Identifying Features That Can Differentiate True From Lymphoid Hyperplasia\n\nPubMed Central\n\nAraki, Tetsuro; Sholl, Lynette M.; Gerbaudo, Victor H.; Hatabu, Hiroto; Nishino, Mizuki\n\n2014-01-01\n\nOBJECTIVE The purpose of this article is to investigate the imaging characteristics of pathologically proven thymic hyperplasia and to identify features that can differentiate true hyperplasia from lymphoid hyperplasia. MATERIALS AND METHODS Thirty-one patients (nine men and 22 women; age range, 20â68 years) with pathologically confirmed thymic hyperplasia (18 true and 13 lymphoid) who underwent preoperative CT (n = 27), PET/CT (n = 5), or MRI (n = 6) were studied. The length and thickness of each thymic lobe and the transverse and anterior-posterior diameters and attenuation of the thymus were measured on CT. Thymic morphologic features and heterogeneity on CT and chemical shift on MRI were evaluated. Maximum standardized uptake values were measured on PET. Imaging features between true and lymphoid hyperplasia were compared. RESULTS No significant differences were observed between true and lymphoid hyperplasia in terms of thymic length, thickness, diameters, morphologic features, and other qualitative features (p > 0.16). The length, thickness, and diameters of thymic hyperplasia were significantly larger than the mean values of normal glands in the corresponding age group (p < 0.001). CT attenuation of lymphoid hyperplasia was significantly higher than that of true hyperplasia among 15 patients with contrast-enhanced CT (median, 47.9 vs 31.4 HU; Wilcoxon p = 0.03). The receiver operating characteristic analysis yielded greater than 41.2 HU as the optimal threshold for differentiating lymphoid hyperplasia from true hyperplasia, with 83% sensitivity and 89% specificity. A decrease of signal intensity on opposed-phase images was present in all four cases with in- and opposed-phase imaging. The mean maximum standardized uptake value was 2.66. CONCLUSION CT attenuation of the thymus was significantly higher in lymphoid hyperplasia than in true hyperplasia, with an optimal threshold of greater than 41.2 HU in this cohort of patients with pathologically confirmed\n\nIdentifying significant environmental features using feature recognition.\n\nDOT National Transportation Integrated Search\n\n2015-10-01\n\nThe Department of Environmental Analysis at the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet has expressed an interest in feature-recognition capability because it may help analysts identify environmentally sensitive features in the landscape, : including those r...\n\nIdentifying Potential Collapse Features Under Highways\n\nDOT National Transportation Integrated Search\n\n2003-01-01\n\nIn 1994, subsidence features were identified on Interstate 70 in eastern Ohio.

To date, less than 25 different mutations have been reported. So far, there are still little data on the key clinical diagnosis criteria and on the natural history of CDKL5-associated encephalopathy. We screened the entire coding region of CDKL5 for mutations in 183 females with encephalopathy with early seizures by denaturing high liquid performance chromatography and direct sequencing, and we identified in 20 unrelated girls, 18 different mutations including 7 novel mutations. These mutations were identified in eight patients with encephalopathy with RTT-like features, five with infantile spasms and seven with encephalopathy with refractory epilepsy. Early epilepsy with normal interictal EEG and severe hypotonia are the key clinical features in identifying patients likely to have CDKL5 mutations. Our study also indicates that these patients clearly exhibit some RTT features such as deceleration of head growth, stereotypies and hand apraxia and that these RTT features become more evident in older and ambulatory patients. However, some RTT signs are clearly absent such as the so called RTT disease profile (period of nearly normal development followed by regression with loss of acquired fine finger skill in early childhood and characteristic intensive eye communication) and the characteristic evolution of the RTT electroencephalogram. Interestingly, in addition to the overall stereotypical symptomatology (age of onset and evolution of the disease) resulting from CDKL5 mutations, atypical forms of CDKL5-related conditions have also been observed. Our data suggest that phenotypic heterogeneity does not correlate with the nature or the position of the mutations or with the pattern of X-chromosome inactivation, but most probably with the functional transcriptional and/or translational consequences of CDKL5\n\nIdentifying Potential Collapse Features Under Highways : Executive Summary\n\nDOT National Transportation Integrated Search\n\n2003-03-01\n\nIn 1994, subsidence features were identified on Interstate 70 in eastern Ohio.

Nowadays, to establish and to ensure the public security requires specially designed devices and systems. Biometrics is a field of science and technology, exploiting human body characteristics for people recognition. It identifies the most characteristic and unique ones in order to design and construct systems capable to recognize people. In this paper some overview is given, presenting the achievements in biometrics. The verification and identification process is explained, along with the way of evaluation of biometric recognition systems. The most frequently human biometrics used in practice are shortly presented, including fingerprints, facial imaging (including thermal characteristic), hand geometry and iris patterns.\n\nA delphi exercise to identify characteristic features of gout - opinions from patients and physicians, the first stage in developing new classification criteria.\n\nPubMed\n\nProwse, Rebecca L; Dalbeth, Nicola; Kavanaugh, Arthur; Adebajo, Adewale O; Gaffo, Angelo L; Terkeltaub, Robert; Mandell, Brian F; Suryana, Bagus P P; Goldenstein-Schainberg, Claudia; Diaz-Torne, CÃ¨sar; Khanna, Dinesh; LiotÃ©, Frederic; Mccarthy, Geraldine; Kerr, Gail S; Yamanaka, Hisashi; Janssens, Hein; Baraf, Herbert F; Chen, Jiunn-Horng; Vazquez-Mellado, Janitzia; Harrold, Leslie R; Stamp, Lisa K; Van De Laar, Mart A; Janssen, Matthijs; Doherty, Michael; Boers, Maarten; Edwards, N Lawrence; Gow, Peter; Chapman, Peter; Khanna, Puja; Helliwell, Philip S; Grainger, Rebecca; Schumacher, H Ralph; Neogi, Tuhina; Jansen, Tim L; Louthrenoo, Worawit; Sivera, Francisca; Taylor, William J; Alten, Rieke\n\n2013-04-01\n\nTo identify a comprehensive list of features that might discriminate between gout and other rheumatic musculoskeletal conditions, to be used subsequently for a case-control study to develop and test new classification criteria for gout. Two Delphi exercises were conducted using Web-based questionnaires: one with physicians from several countries who had an interest in gout and one with patients from New Zealand who had gout. Physicians rated a list of potentially discriminating features that were identified by literature review and expert opinion, and patients rated a list of features that they generated themselves. Agreement was defined by the RAND/UCLA disagreement index. Forty-four experienced physicians and 9 patients responded to all iterations. For physicians, 71 items were identified by literature review and 15 more were suggested by physicians. The physician survey showed agreement for 26 discriminatory features and 15 as not discriminatory. The patients identified 46 features of gout, for which there was agreement on 25 items as being discriminatory and 7 items as not discriminatory. Patients and physicians agreed upon several key features of gout. Physicians emphasized objective findings, imaging, and patterns of symptoms, whereas patients emphasized severity, functional results, and idiographic perception of symptoms.\n\nPrincipal component analysis of three-dimensional face shape: Identifying shape features that change with age.\n\nPubMed\n\nKurosumi, M; Mizukoshi, K\n\n2018-05-01\n\nThe types of shape feature that constitutes a face have not been comprehensively established, and most previous studies of age-related changes in facial shape have focused on individual characteristics, such as wrinkle, sagging skin, etc. In this study, we quantitatively measured differences in face shape between individuals and investigated how shape features changed with age. We analyzed three-dimensionally the faces of 280 Japanese women aged 20-69Â years and used principal component analysis to establish the shape features that characterized individual differences. We also evaluated the relationships between each feature and age, clarifying the shape features characteristic of different age groups. Changes in facial shape in middle age were a decreased volume of the upper face and increased volume of the whole cheeks and around the chin. Changes in older people were an increased volume of the lower cheeks and around the chin, sagging skin, and jaw distortion. Principal component analysis was effective for identifying facial shape features that represent individual and age-related differences. This method allowed straightforward measurements, such as the increase or decrease in cheeks caused by soft tissue changes or skeletal-based changes to the forehead or jaw, simply by acquiring three-dimensional facial images.

Conventionally signature data has been captured using pen/tablet apparatus. However, the use of other devices such as the touch-screen tablets has expanded in recent years affording the possibility of assessing biometric interaction on this new technology. To explore the potential of employing DSV techniques when a user signs or swipes with their finger, we report a study to correlate pen and finger generated features. Investigating the stability and correlation between a set of characteristic features recorded in participant's signatures and touch-based swipe gestures, a statistical analysis was conducted to assess consistency between capture scenarios. The results indicate that there is a range of static and dynamic features such as the rate of jerk, size, duration and the distance the pen traveled that can lead to interoperability between these two systems for input methods for use within a potential biometric context. It can be concluded that this data indicates that a general principle is that the same underlying constructional mechanisms are evident. Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Detection of epistatic interactions still remains a challenge due to the large number of features and relatively small sample size as input, thus leading to the so-called \"short fat data\" problem. The efficiency of machine learning methods can be increased by limiting the number of input features. Thus, it is very important to perform variable selection before searching for epistasis. Many methods have been evaluated and proposed to perform feature selection, but no single method works best in all scenarios. We demonstrate this by conducting two separate simulation analyses to evaluate the proposed collective feature selection approach. Through our simulation study we propose a collective feature selection approach to select features that are in the \"union\" of the best performing methods. We explored various parametric, non-parametric, and data mining approaches to perform feature selection. We choose our top performing methods to select the union of the resulting variables based on a user-defined percentage of variants selected from each method to take to downstream analysis. Our simulation analysis shows that non-parametric data mining approaches, such as MDR, may work best under one simulation criteria for the high effect size (penetrance) datasets, while non-parametric methods designed for feature selection, such as Ranger and Gradient boosting, work best under other simulation criteria. Thus, using a collective approach proves to be more beneficial for selecting variables with epistatic effects also in low effect size datasets and different genetic architectures. Following this, we applied our proposed collective feature selection approach to select the top 1% of variables to identify potential interacting variables associated with Body Mass Index (BMI) in ~â44,000 samples obtained from Geisinger\n\nCharacteristic imaging features of body packers: a pictorial essay.\n\nPubMed\n\nAb Hamid, Suzana; Abd Rashid, Saiful Nizam; Mohd Saini, Suraini\n\n2012-06-01\n\nThe drug-trafficking business has risen tremendously because of the current increased demand for illegal narcotics. The smugglers conceal the drugs in their bodies (body packers) in order to bypass the tight security at international borders. A suspected body packer will normally be sent to the hospital for imaging investigations to confirm the presence of drugs in the body. Radiologists, therefore, need to be familiar with and able to identify drug packets within the human body because they shoulder the legal responsibilities. This pictorial essay describes the characteristic imaging features of drug packets within the gastrointestinal tract.\n\nInstructional Quality Features in Videotaped Biology Lessons: Content-Independent Description of Characteristics\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDorfner, Tobias; FÃ¶rtsch, Christian; Boone, William; Neuhaus, Birgit J.\n\n2017-09-01\n\nA number of studies on single instructional quality features have been reported for mathematics and science instruction. For summarizing single instructional quality features, researchers have created a model of three basic dimensions (classroom management, supportive climate, and cognitive activation) of instructional quality mainly through observing mathematics instruction. Considering this model as valid for all subjects and as usable for describing instruction, we used it in this study which aimed to analyze characteristics of instructional quality in biology lessons of high-achieving and low-achieving classes, independently of content. Therefore, we used the data of three different previous video studies of biology instruction conducted in Germany. From each video study, we selected three high-achieving and three low-achieving classes (N = 18 teachers; 35 videos) for our multiple-case study, in which conspicuous characteristics of instructional quality features were qualitatively identified and qualitatively analyzed. The amount of these characteristics was counted in a quantitative way in all the videos. The characteristics we found could be categorized using the model of three basic dimensions of instructional quality despite some subject-specific differences for biology instruction. Our results revealed that many more characteristics were observable in high-achieving classes than in low-achieving classes. Thus, we believe that this model could be used to describe biology instruction independently of the content. We also make the claims about the qualities for biology instructionâworking with concentration in a content-structured environment, getting challenged in higher order thinking, and getting praised for performanceâthat could have positive influence on students' achievement.\n\n[Depressive disorders in primary care: Clinical features and sociodemographic characteristics].\n\nPubMed\n\nOneib, B; Sabir, M; Otheman, Y; Ouanass, A\n\n2018-06-01\n\nOur aim was to determine the reason for consultation and the clinical features of depressive disorders according to the diagnostic and statistical manual (DSM) 4th edition IV R in primary care and to identify if there is an association between sociodemographic characteristics and depressive pattern. In a cross-sectional study conducted to determinate the prevalence of depressive disorders in primary care, at three urban centers in two cities SalÃ© and Oujda by five physicians, we recruited primary care 396 patients of whom 58 were depressed, among these patients we screened for depressive disorders, their clinical features, the melancholic characteristics and suicidal ideation using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview. Mean age of the 58 depressive patients was 46Â±15 years. They were predominantly female, inactive and of low socio-economic level. Approximately one-third of the patients were illiterate and single. The symptoms frequently encountered were sadness (63.7%), anhedonia (62%), insomnia (45.7%), anorexia (60.9%), psychomotor retardation (60.9%) and asthenia (73.9%). Somatic symptoms were present 99%, the most common complaint was pain that exhibited 68.6% prevalence. Suicidal ideations were found in 36.2% of these depressive patients. The accuracy of the clinical features of patients with depression in primary care will facilitate the detection of these disorders by general practitioners and improve management of depression.

M.; Haryawan, C.; Windarta, B.\n\n2018-03-01\n\nLung cancer causes a high mortality rate in the world than any other cancers. That can be minimised if the symptoms and cancer cells have been detected early. One of the techniques used to detect lung cancer is by computed tomography (CT) scan. CT scan images have been used in this study to identify one of the lesion characteristics named ground glass opacity (GGO). It has been used to determine the level of malignancy of the lesion. There were three phases in identifying GGO: image cropping, feature extraction using grey level co-occurrence matrices (GLCM) and classification using NaÃ¯ve Bayes Classifier. In order to improve the classification results, the most significant feature was sought by feature selection using gain ratio evaluation. Based on the results obtained, the most significant features could be identified by using feature selection method used in this research. The accuracy rate increased from 83.33% to 91.67%, the sensitivity from 82.35% to 94.11% and the specificity from 84.21% to 89.47%.\n\nFeature genes in metastatic breast cancer identified by MetaDE and SVM classifier methods.\n\nPubMed\n\nTuo, Youlin; An, Ning; Zhang, Ming\n\n2018-03-01\n\nThe aim of the present study was to investigate the feature genes in metastatic breast cancer samples. A total of 5 expression profiles of metastatic breast cancer samples were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database, which were then analyzed using the MetaQC and MetaDE packages in R language. The feature genes between metastasis and nonâmetastasis samples were screened under the threshold of P<0.05. Based on the proteinâprotein interactions (PPIs) in the Biological General Repository for Interaction Datasets, Human Protein Reference Database and Biomolecular Interaction Network Database, the PPI network of the feature genes was constructed. The feature genes identified by topological characteristics were then used for support vector machine (SVM) classifier training and verification. The accuracy of the SVM classifier was then evaluated using another independent dataset from The Cancer Genome Atlas database. Finally, function and pathway enrichment analyses for genes in the SVM classifier were performed. A total of 541 feature genes were identified between metastatic and nonâmetastatic samples. The top 10 genes with the highest betweenness centrality values in the PPI network of feature genes were Nuclear RNA Export Factor 1, cyclinâdependent kinase 2 (CDK2), myelocytomatosis protoâoncogene protein (MYC), Cullin 5, SHC Adaptor Protein 1, Clathrin heavy chain, Nucleolin, WD repeat domain 1, proteasome 26S subunit nonâATPase 2 and telomeric repeat binding factor 2. The cyclinâdependent kinase inhibitor 1A (CDKN1A), E2F transcription factor 1 (E2F1), and MYC interacted with CDK2. The SVM classifier constructed by the top 30 feature genes was able to distinguish metastatic samples from nonâmetastatic samples [correct rate, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value >0.89; sensitivity >0.84; area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) >0.96].

In the ENFS, data clustering is performed based on the proposed algorithm named partitioning data space (PDS). Firstly, the PDS builds data clusters in joint input-output data space with appropriate constraints. The role of these constraints is to create reasonable data distribution in clusters. The ENFS then uses these clusters to perform the following tasks. Firstly, the fuzzy sets expressing characteristics of data clusters are established. The structure of the fuzzy sets is adjusted to be suitable for features of the data set. Secondly, an appropriate structure of neuro-fuzzy (NF) expressed by an optimal number of labeled data clusters and the fuzzy-set groups is determined. After the ENFS is introduced, its effectiveness is evaluated by a prediction-error-comparative work between the proposed method and some other methods in identifying numerical data sets such as âdaily data of stock Aâ, or in identifying a function. The ENFS is then applied to identify damping force characteristics of the smart dampers. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the ENFS in identifying the damping forces of the smart dampers, the prediction errors are presented by comparing with experimental results.\n\n14 CFR 35.7 - Features and characteristics.\n\nCode of Federal Regulations, 2011 CFR\n\n2011-01-01\n\n...

Lunar detecting data, such as topography and gravity, have made it possible to interpret this hemisphere dichotomy. The high-resolution lunar topographic model CLTM-s01 has revealed that there still exist four unknown features, namely, quasi-impact basin Sternfeld-Lewis (20Â°S, 232Â°E), confirmed impact basin Fitzgerald-Jackson (25Â°N, 191Â°E), crater Wugang (13Â°N, 189Â°E) and volcanic deposited highland Yutu (14Â°N, 308Â°E). Furthermore, we analyzed and identified about eleven large-scale impact basins that have been proposed since 1994, and classified them according to their circular characteristics.\n\nCharacteristic Features and Contributory Factors in Fatal Ciguatera Fish PoisoningâImplications for Prevention and Public Education\n\nPubMed Central\n\nChan, Thomas Y. K.\n\n2016-01-01\n\nIn this review, the main objective was to describe the characteristic features of fatal ciguatera fish poisoning and identify contributory factors, with a view to promote prevention and public education. Ciguatera-related deaths, although rare, have been reported from the Pacific, Caribbean, and Indian Ocean regions. The clinical features were generally dominated by convulsions and coma, with various focal neurological signs. Several contributory factors could be identified, including consumption of ciguatoxin (CTX)-rich fish parts (viscera and head) in larger amounts, the most ciguatoxic fish species (e.g., Gymnothorax flavimarginatus) and reef fish collected after storms and individuals' susceptibility. Mass ciguatera fish poisoning with mortalities also occurred when G. flavimarginatus and other ciguatoxic fish species were shared in gatherings and parties. The characteristic features of fatal ciguatera fish poisoning must be recognized early. The public should be repeatedly reminded to avoid eating the most ciguatoxic fish species and the CTX-rich parts of reef fish. To prevent mass poisoning in gatherings and parties, the most ciguatoxic fish species and potentially toxic fish species must be avoided. Particularly after hits by disastrous storms, it is important to monitor the toxicity of reef fish and the incidence rates of ciguatera.

Satellite instruments view volcanic thermal features across the globe at various temporal and spatial resolutions. Thermal features that may be a precursor to a major eruption, or indicative of important changes in an on-going eruption can be subtle, making them challenging to reliably identify with satellite instruments. The goal of this study was to explore the limits of the types and magnitudes of thermal anomalies that could be detected using satellite thermal infrared (TIR) data. Specifically, the characterization of sub-pixel thermal features with a wide range of temperatures is considered using ASTER multispectral TIR data. First, theoretical calculations were made to define a \"thermal mixing detection threshold\" for ASTER, which quantifies the limits of ASTER's ability to resolve sub-pixel thermal mixing over a range of hot target temperatures and % pixel areas. Then, ASTER TIR data were used to model sub-pixel thermal features at the Yellowstone National Park geothermal area (hot spring pools with temperatures from 40 to 90 ??C) and at Mount Erebus Volcano, Antarctica (an active lava lake with temperatures from 200 to 800 ??C). Finally, various sources of uncertainty in sub-pixel thermal calculations were quantified for these empirical measurements, including pixel resampling, atmospheric correction, and background temperature and emissivity assumptions.\n\nIdentifying the relevant features of the National Digital Cadastral Database (NDCDB) for spatial analysis by using the Delphi Technique\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHalim, N. Z. A.; Sulaiman, S. A.; Talib, K.; Ng, E. G.\n\n2018-02-01\n\nThis paper explains the process carried out in identifying the relevant features of the National Digital Cadastral Database (NDCDB) for spatial analysis. The research was initially a part of a larger research exercise to identify the significance of NDCDB from the legal, technical, role and land-based analysis perspectives. The research methodology of applying the Delphi technique is substantially discussed in this paper. A heterogeneous panel of 14 experts was created to determine the importance of NDCDB from the technical relevance standpoint. Three statements describing the relevant features of NDCDB for spatial analysis were established after three rounds of consensus building. It highlighted the NDCDBâs characteristics such as its spatial accuracy, functions, and criteria as a facilitating tool for spatial analysis. By recognising the relevant features of NDCDB for spatial analysis in this study, practical application of NDCDB for various analysis and purpose can be widely implemented.\n\nAn investigation of the psychological characteristics of stalkers: empathy, problem-solving, attachment and borderline personality features.\n\nPubMed\n\nLewis, S F; Fremouw, W J; Del Ben, K; Farr, C\n\n2001-01-01\n\nThis study examined the psychological characteristics of a sample of self-reported stalkers in comparison with a control group, on measures of empathy, problem-solving skills, attachment, and borderline personality features. Stalkers were identified by their endorsement of specific behavioral items, consistent with a widely adopted definition of stalking, denoting behaviors that: (a) are repeatedly directed toward an identified target; (b) are intrusive and unwanted; and (c) evoke fear in the victim. Stalkers scored significantly higher than controls on measures of insecure attachment and borderline personality features, suggesting that the stalking group demonstrates a general pattern of inadequate interpersonal attachment, has limited abilities to form and maintain appropriate relationships, is emotionally labile and unstable, and experiences ambivalence regarding their interpersonal relationships. Treatment implications are discussed herein.\n\nCharacteristic features of injuries due to shark attacks: a review of 12 cases.\n\nPubMed\n\nIhama, Yoko; Ninomiya, Kenji; Noguchi, Masamichi; Fuke, Chiaki; Miyazaki, Tetsuji\n\n2009-09-01\n\nShark attacks on humans might not occur as often as is believed and the characteristic features of shark injuries on corpses have not been extensively reviewed. We describe the characteristic features of shark injuries on 12 corpses. The analysis of these injuries might reveal the motivation behind the attacks and/or the shark species involved in the attack. Gouge marks on the bones are evidence of a shark attack, even if the corpse is decomposed. Severance of the body part at the joints without a fracture was found to be a characteristic feature of shark injuries.\n\nTCGA study identifies genomic features of cervical cancer\n\nCancer.gov\n\nInvestigators with The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Research Network have identified novel genomic and molecular characteristics of cervical cancer that will aid in subclassification of the disease and may help target therapies that are most appropriate for each patient.\n\nPathologic features of metastatic lymph nodes identified from prophylactic central neck dissection in patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma.\n\nPubMed\n\nLee, Hyoung Shin; Park, Chanwoo; Kim, Sung Won; Noh, Woong Jae; Lim, Soo Jin; Chun, Bong Kwon; Kim, Beom Su; Hong, Jong Chul; Lee, Kang Dae\n\n2016-10-01\n\nThe importance of pathologic features of metastatic lymph nodes (LNs), such as size, number, and extranodal extension, has been recently emphasized in patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). We evaluated the characteristics of metastatic LNs identified after prophylactic central neck dissection (CND) in patients with PTC. We performed a retrospective review of 1,046 patients who underwent unilateral or bilateral thyroidectomy with ipsilateral prophylactic CND. We reviewed the characteristics of the metastatic LNs and analyzed their correlation to the clinicopathologic characteristics of the primary tumor. Cervical LN metastasis after prophylactic CND was identified in 280 out of 1046 patients (26.8Â %). The size of metastatic foci (â¥2Â mm) was independently correlated with primary tumor size (â¥1Â cm) (pÂ =Â 0.016, ORÂ =Â 1.88). Primary tumor size (â¥1Â cm) was also correlated to the number of metastatic LNs (â¥5) (pÂ =Â 0.004, ORÂ =Â 3.14) and extranodal extension (pÂ =Â 0.021, ORÂ =Â 2.41) in univariate analysis. The size of the primary tumor affects pathologic features of subclinical LN metastasis in patients with PTC. Patients with primary tumors â¥1Â cm have an increased risk of larger LN metastases (â¥2Â mm), an increased number of LN metastases (â¥5), and a higher incidence of ENE, which should be considered in decision for prophylactic CND.\n\nA Novel Feature Extraction Method with Feature Selection to Identify Golgi-Resident Protein Types from Imbalanced Data\n\nPubMed Central\n\nYang, Runtao; Zhang, Chengjin; Gao, Rui; Zhang, Lina\n\n2016-01-01\n\nThe Golgi Apparatus (GA) is a major collection and dispatch station for numerous proteins destined for secretion, plasma membranes and lysosomes. The dysfunction of GA proteins can result in neurodegenerative diseases. Therefore, accurate identification of protein subGolgi localizations may assist in drug development and understanding the mechanisms of the GA involved in various cellular processes. In this paper, a new computational method is proposed for identifying cis-Golgi proteins from trans-Golgi proteins. Based on the concept of Common Spatial Patterns (CSP), a novel feature extraction technique is developed to extract evolutionary information from protein sequences. To deal with the imbalanced benchmark dataset, the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) is adopted. A feature selection method called Random Forest-Recursive Feature Elimination (RF-RFE) is employed to search the optimal features from the CSP based features and g-gap dipeptide composition. Based on the optimal features, a Random Forest (RF) module is used to distinguish cis-Golgi proteins from trans-Golgi proteins. Through the jackknife cross-validation, the proposed method achieves a promising performance with a sensitivity of 0.889, a specificity of 0.880, an accuracy of 0.885, and a Matthewâs Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of 0.765, which remarkably outperforms previous methods. Moreover, when tested on a common independent dataset, our method also achieves a significantly improved performance. These results highlight the promising performance of the proposed method to identify Golgi-resident protein types. Furthermore, the CSP based feature extraction method may provide guidelines for protein function predictions.

The asynchronous ripple comparator stops comparing at the first unequal bit but delivers the result to the least significant bit. The pre-stop asynchronous comparator can completely stop comparing and obtain results immediately. The proposed and contrastive comparators were implemented in SMIC 0.18 Î¼m process with different bit widths. Simulation shows that the proposed pre-stop asynchronous comparator features the lowest power consumption, shortest average propagation delay and highest area efficiency among the comparators. Data path of low-density parity check decoder using the proposed pre-stop asynchronous comparators are most power efficient compared with other data paths with synthesised, clock gating and bitwise competition logic comparators.\n\nIdentifying Trajectories of Borderline Personality Features in Adolescence\n\nPubMed Central\n\nHaltigan, John D.\n\n2016-01-01\n\nObjective: To examine trajectories of adolescent borderline personality (BP) features in a normative-risk cohort (n = 566) of Canadian children assessed at ages 13, 14, 15, and 16 and childhood predictors of trajectory group membership assessed at ages 8, 10, 11, and 12. Method: Data were drawn from the McMaster Teen Study, an on-going study examining relations among bullying, mental health, and academic achievement. Participants and their parents completed a battery of mental health and peer relations questionnaires at each wave of the study. Academic competence was assessed at age 8 (Grade 3). Latent class growth analysis, analysis of variance, and logistic regression were used to analyze the data. Results: Three distinct BP features trajectory groups were identified: elevated or rising, intermediate or stable, and low or stable. Parent- and child-reported mental health symptoms, peer relations risk factors, and intra-individual risk factors were significant predictors of elevated or rising and intermediate or stable trajectory groups. Child-reported attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and somatization symptoms uniquely predicted elevated or rising trajectory group membership, whereas parent-reported anxiety and child-reported ADHD symptoms uniquely predicted intermediate or stable trajectory group membership. Child-reported somatization symptoms was the only predictor to differentiate the intermediate or stable and elevated or rising trajectory groups (OR 1.15, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.28). Associations between child-reported reactive temperament and elevated BP features trajectory group membership were 10.23 times higher among children who were bullied, supporting a diathesisâstress pathway in the development of BP features for these youth. Conclusions: Findings demonstrate the heterogeneous course of BP features in early adolescence and shed light on the potential prodromal course of later borderline personality disorder.

The ability to classify videos into various classes such as sports, news, movies, or documentaries, increases the efficiency of indexing, browsing, and retrieval of video in large databases. In this paper, we discuss the extraction of features that enable identification of sports videos directly from the compressed domain of MPEG video. These features include detecting the presence of action replays, determining the amount of scene text in vide, and calculating various statistics on camera and/or object motion. The features are derived from the macroblock, motion,and bit-rate information that is readily accessible from MPEG video with very minimal decoding, leading to substantial gains in processing speeds. Full-decoding of selective frames is required only for text analysis. A decision tree classifier built using these features is able to identify sports clips with an accuracy of about 93 percent.\n\nIdentifying DNA Methylation Features that Underlie Prostate Cancer Disparities\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n2016-10-01\n\nReport We will continue to recruit African American patients and bank their prostate tissue .

Each of the plurality of ordered pairs has an index and a response. The method has the steps of: (a) providing an index window having a first window end located on a first index and extending across a plurality of indices to a second window end; (b) selecting responses corresponding to the plurality of indices within the index window and computing a measure of dispersion of the responses; and (c) comparing the measure of dispersion to a dispersion critical value. Advantages of the present invention include minimizing signal to noise ratio, signal drift, varying baseline signal and combinations thereof.\n\nAn Optimal Mean Based Block Robust Feature Extraction Method to Identify Colorectal Cancer Genes with Integrated Data.\n\nPubMed\n\nLiu, Jian; Cheng, Yuhu; Wang, Xuesong; Zhang, Lin; Liu, Hui\n\n2017-08-17\n\nIt is urgent to diagnose colorectal cancer in the early stage. Some feature genes which are important to colorectal cancer development have been identified. However, for the early stage of colorectal cancer, less is known about the identity of specific cancer genes that are associated with advanced clinical stage. In this paper, we conducted a feature extraction method named Optimal Mean based Block Robust Feature Extraction method (OMBRFE) to identify feature genes associated with advanced colorectal cancer in clinical stage by using the integrated colorectal cancer data. Firstly, based on the optimal mean and L 2,1 -norm, a novel feature extraction method called Optimal Mean based Robust Feature Extraction method (OMRFE) is proposed to identify feature genes. Then the OMBRFE method which introduces the block ideology into OMRFE method is put forward to process the colorectal cancer integrated data which includes multiple genomic data: copy number alterations, somatic mutations, methylation expression alteration, as well as gene expression changes. Experimental results demonstrate that the OMBRFE is more effective than previous methods in identifying the feature genes. Moreover, genes identified by OMBRFE are verified to be closely associated with advanced colorectal cancer in clinical stage.\n\nGene expression profiles of breast biopsies from healthy women identify a group with claudin-low features\n\nPubMed Central\n\n2011-01-01\n\nBackground Increased understanding of the variability in normal breast biology will enable us to identify mechanisms of breast cancer initiation and the origin of different subtypes, and to better predict breast cancer risk. Methods Gene expression patterns in breast biopsies from 79 healthy women referred to breast diagnostic centers in Norway were explored by unsupervised hierarchical clustering and supervised analyses, such as gene set enrichment analysis and gene ontology analysis and comparison with previously published genelists and independent datasets. Results Unsupervised hierarchical clustering identified two separate clusters of normal breast tissue based on gene-expression profiling, regardless of clustering algorithm and gene filtering used. Comparison of the expression profile of the two clusters with several published gene lists describing breast cells revealed that the samples in cluster 1 share characteristics with stromal cells and stem cells, and to a certain degree with mesenchymal cells and myoepithelial cells. The samples in cluster 1 also share many features with the newly identified claudin-low breast cancer intrinsic subtype, which also shows characteristics of stromal and stem cells. More women belonging to cluster 1 have a family history of breast cancer and there is a slight overrepresentation of nulliparous women in cluster 1. Similar findings were seen in a separate dataset consisting of histologically normal tissue from both breasts harboring breast cancer and from mammoplasty reductions. Conclusion This is the first study to explore the variability of gene expression patterns in whole biopsies from normal breasts and identified distinct subtypes of normal breast tissue. Further studies are needed to determine the specific cell contribution to the variation in the biology of normal breasts, how the clusters identified relate to breast cancer risk and their possible link to the origin of the different molecular subtypes of breast\n\nGene expression profiles of breast biopsies from healthy women identify a group with claudin-low features.\n\nPubMed\n\nHaakensen, Vilde D; Lingjaerde, Ole Christian; LÃ¼ders, Torben; Riis, Margit; Prat, Aleix; Troester, Melissa A; Holmen, Marit M; Frantzen, Jan Ole; Romundstad, Linda; Navjord, Dina; Bukholm, Ida K; Johannesen, Tom B; Perou, Charles M; Ursin, Giske; Kristensen, Vessela N; BÃ¸rresen-Dale, Anne-Lise; Helland, Aslaug\n\n2011-11-01\n\nIncreased understanding of the variability in normal breast biology will enable us to identify mechanisms of breast cancer initiation and the origin of different subtypes, and to better predict breast cancer risk.

Several factors can affect the characteristics of such movements, including individual factors or musical features. For this study, we investigated the effect of rhythm- and timbre-related musical features as well as tempo on movement characteristics. Sixty participants were presented with 30 musical stimuli representing different styles of popular music, and instructed to move along with the music. Optical motion capture was used to record participantsâ movements. Subsequently, eight movement features and four rhythm- and timbre-related musical features were computationally extracted from the data, while the tempo was assessed in a perceptual experiment. A subsequent correlational analysis revealed that, for instance, clear pulses seemed to be embodied with the whole body, i.e., by using various movement types of different body parts, whereas spectral flux and percussiveness were found to be more distinctly related to certain body parts, such as head and hand movement. A series of ANOVAs with the stimuli being divided into three groups of five stimuli each based on the tempo revealed no significant differences between the groups, suggesting that the tempo of our stimuli set failed to have an effect on the movement features. In general, the results can be linked to the framework of embodied music cognition, as they show that body movements are used to reflect, imitate, and predict musical characteristics.

We developed an image analysis algorithm which standardized the quantification of specific histopathologic features and exported a multi-parametric feature-set captured without bias. The image analysis algorithm was executed across a training set (n = 50) and the resultant big data was distilled through decision tree modelling to identify the most informative parameters to sub-categorize stage II CRC patients. The most significant, and novel, parameter identified was the âsum area of poorly differentiated clustersâ (AreaPDC). This feature was validated across a second cohort of stage II CRC patients (n = 134) (HR = 4; 95% CI, 1.5â 11). Finally, the AreaPDC was integrated with the significant features within the clinical pathology report, pT stage and differentiation, into a novel prognostic index (HR = 7.5; 95% CI, 3â18.5) which improved upon current clinical staging (HR = 4.26; 95% CI, 1.7â 10.3). The identification of poorly differentiated clusters as being highly significant in disease progression presents evidence to suggest that these features could be the source of novel targets to decrease the risk of disease specific death.

In previous studies, it was shown that the agreement among pathologists for grading mitotic index is fairly modest, as mitoses have a large variety of appearances and they could be mistaken for other similar objects. In this study, we determined local and contextual features that differ significantly between easily identifiable mitoses and challenging ones. The images were obtained from the Mitosis-Atypia 2014 challenge. In total, the dataset contained 453 mitotic figures. Two pathologists annotated each mitotic figure. In case of disagreement, an opinion from a third pathologist was requested. The mitoses were grouped into three categories, those recognized as \"a true mitosis\" by both pathologists ,those labelled as \"a true mitosis\" by only one of the first two readers and also the third pathologist, and those annotated as \"probably a mitosis\" by all readers or the majority of them. After color unmixing, the mitoses were segmented from H channel. Shape-based features along with intensity-based and textural features were extracted from H-channel, blue ratio channel and five different color spaces. Holistic features describing each image were also considered. The Kruskal-Wallis H test was used to identify significantly different features. Multiple comparisons were done using the rank-based version of Tukey-Kramer test. The results indicated that there are local and global features which differ significantly among different groups. In addition, variations between mitoses in different groups were captured in the features from HSL and LCH color space more than other ones.\n\nIdentifying the features of an exercise addiction: A Delphi study\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMacfarlane, Lucy; Owens, Glynn; Cruz, Borja del Pozo\n\n2016-01-01\n\nObjectives There remains limited consensus regarding the definition and conceptual basis of exercise addiction. An understanding of the factors motivating maintenance of addictive exercise behavior is important for appropriately targeting intervention. The aims of this study were twofold: first, to establish consensus on features of an exercise addiction using Delphi methodology and second, to identify whether these features are congruous with a conceptual model of exercise addiction adapted from the Work Craving Model. Methods A three-round Delphi process explored the views of participants regarding the features of an exercise addiction. The participants were selected from sport and exercise relevant domains, including physicians, physiotherapists, coaches, trainers, and athletes. Suggestions meeting consensus were considered with regard to the proposed conceptual model. Results and discussion Sixty-three items reached consensus. There was concordance of opinion that exercising excessively is an addiction, and therefore it was appropriate to consider the suggestions in light of the addiction-based conceptual model. Statements reaching consensus were consistent with all three components of the model: learned (negative perfectionism), behavioral (obsessiveâcompulsive drive), and hedonic (self-worth compensation and reduction of negative affect and withdrawal). Conclusions Delphi methodology allowed consensus to be reached regarding the features of an exercise addiction, and these features were consistent with our hypothesized conceptual model of exercise addiction. This study is the first to have applied Delphi methodology to the exercise addiction field, and therefore introduces a novel approach to exercise addiction research that can be used as a template to stimulate future examination using this technique.

Clinical trial data were reviewed for nine antidepressants approved by the Food and Drug Administration between 1985 and 2000. From the antidepressant research programs on these medications, 52 clinical trials were included in the study. The authors evaluated trial design features, patient characteristics, and difference in response between placebo and antidepressant. Nine trial design features and patient characteristics were present in the research programs for all nine of the antidepressants. The severity of depressive symptoms before patient randomization, the dosing schedule (flexible versus fixed), the number of treatment arms, and the percentage of female patients were significantly associated with the difference in response to antidepressant and placebo. The duration of the antidepressant trial, number of patients per treatment arm, number of sites, and mean age of the patients were similar in successful trials (with a greater antidepressant-placebo difference) and less successful trials (with a smaller antidepressant-placebo difference). These findings may help in the design of future antidepressant trials.\n\nAn expert botanical feature extraction technique based on phenetic features for identifying plant species.\n\nPubMed\n\nKolivand, Hoshang; Fern, Bong Mei; Rahim, Mohd Shafry Mohd; Sulong, Ghazali; Baker, Thar; Tully, David\n\n2018-01-01\n\nIn this paper, we present a new method to recognise the leaf type and identify plant species using phenetic parts of the leaf; lobes, apex and base detection. Most of the research in this area focuses on the popular features such as the shape, colour, vein, and texture, which consumes large amounts of computational processing and are not efficient, especially in the Acer database with a high complexity structure of the leaves. This paper is focused on phenetic parts of the leaf which increases accuracy. Detecting the local maxima and local minima are done based on Centroid Contour Distance for Every Boundary Point, using north and south region to recognise the apex and base. Digital morphology is used to measure the leaf shape and the leaf margin. Centroid Contour Gradient is presented to extract the curvature of leaf apex and base. We analyse 32 leaf images of tropical plants and evaluated with two different datasets, Flavia, and Acer. The best accuracy obtained is 94.76% and 82.6% respectively. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed technique without considering the commonly used features with high computational cost.\n\nAn expert botanical feature extraction technique based on phenetic features for identifying plant species\n\nPubMed Central\n\nFern, Bong Mei; Rahim, Mohd Shafry Mohd; Sulong, Ghazali; Baker, Thar; Tully, David\n\n2018-01-01\n\nIn this paper, we present a new method to recognise the leaf type and identify plant species using phenetic parts of the leaf; lobes, apex and base detection.

However, several studies showed that people experience a variety of problems using their medicines. The purpose of this study was to identify design features of oral medicines that cause use problems among older patients in daily practice. A qualitative study with semi-structured interviews on the experiences of older people with the use of their medicines was performed (n=59). Information on practical problems, strategies to overcome these problems and the medicines' design features that caused these problems were collected. The practical problems and management strategies were categorised into 'use difficulties' and 'use errors'. A total of 158 use problems were identified, of which 45 were categorized as use difficulties and 113 as use error. Design features that contributed the most to the occurrence of use difficulties were the dimensions and surface texture of the dosage form (29.6% and 18.5%, respectively). Design features that contributed the most to the occurrence of use errors were the push-through force of blisters (22.1%) and tamper evident packaging (12.1%). These findings will help developers of medicinal products to proactively address potential usability issues with their medicines. Copyright Â© 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

The sounds might physically differ from one another only as feature conjunctions, and several of them might occur repeatedly in the short term. Nevertheless, the detection of rare sounds requires the identification of the repeated ones. Adults have some limited ability to effortlessly identify repeated sounds in such acoustically complex environments, but the developmental onset of this finite ability is unknown. Sleeping newborn infants were presented with a repeated tone carrying six frequent (P = 0.15 each) and six rare (P approximately 0.017 each) conjunctions of its frequency, intensity and duration. Event-related potentials recorded from the infants' scalp were found to shift in amplitude towards positive polarity selectively in response to rare conjunctions. This finding suggests that humans are relatively hard-wired to preattentively identify repeated auditory feature conjunctions even when such conjunctions occur rarely among other similar ones.\n\nMicrobiota fingerprints lose individually identifying features over time.\n\nPubMed\n\nWilkins, David; Leung, Marcus H Y; Lee, Patrick K H\n\n2017-01-09\n\nHumans host individually unique skin microbiota, suggesting that microbiota traces transferred from skin to surfaces could serve as forensic markers analogous to fingerprints.

Moreover, as skin and surface microbiota change with time, even persistent traces may lose their forensic potential as they would cease to resemble the microbiota of the person who left them. We followed skin and surface microbiota within households for four seasons to determine whether accurate microbiota-based matching of individuals to their households could be achieved across long time delays. While household surface microbiota traces could be matched to the correct occupant or occupants with 67% accuracy, accuracy decreased substantially when skin and surface samples were collected in different seasons, and particularly when surface samples were collected long after skin samples. Most OTUs persisted on skin or surfaces for less than one season, indicating that OTU loss was the major cause of decreased matching accuracy. OTUs that were more useful for individual identification persisted for less time and were less likely to be deposited from skin to surface, suggesting a trade-off between the longevity and identifying value of microbiota traces. While microbiota traces have potential forensic value, unlike fingerprints they are not static and may degrade in a way that preferentially erases features useful in identifying individuals.\n\nMO-DE-207B-10: Impact of Morphologic Characteristics On Radiomics Features From Contast-Enhanced CT for Primary Lung Tumors\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nFried, D; Zhang, L; Fave, X\n\nPurpose: Determine the impact of morphologic characteristics (e.g. necrosis, vascular enhancement, and cavitation) on radiomic features from contrast enhanced CT (CE-CT) in primary lung tumors. Methods: We developed an auto-segmentation algorithm to separate lung tumors on contrast-enhanced CT into cavitation (air), necrosis, tissue, and enhancing vessels using a combination of thresholding and region-growing. An auto-segmentation algorithm was also designed to identify necrosis on FDG-PET scans. Wilcoxon rank-sum tests were used to determine if significant differences existed in radiomics features (histogram-uniformity and Laplacian-of-Gaussian average) from 249 patients, found to prognostic in previous work, based on the presence/absence of morphologic features. FeaturemoreÂ Â» values were also compared between the original tumor contours and contours excluding a specific morphologic feature. Comparison of necrosis segmentation on CE-CT versus FDG-PET was performed in 78 patients to assess for agreement using the concordance correlation coefficient (CCC). Results: Tumors with cavitation and enhancing vasculature had lower uniformity values (p = 0.001 and p = 0.03, respectively). Tumors with enhancing vasculature and necrosis had higher Laplacian-of-Gaussian average values (measure of âedgesâ within the tumor) (p < 0.001). Removing these tissue types from regions-of-interest did not drastically alter either radiomic feature value (all scenarios had R{sup 2} > 0.8). This suggests there may be interactions between morphologic characteristics and the radiomic feature value of tumor tissue. Comparison of necrosis volume and percent necrosis volume of tumor were found to have CCC values of 0.85 and 0.76, respectively between CE-CT and FDG-PET segmentation methods. Conclusions: Tumors with enhancing vasculature, necrosis, and cavitation have higher radiomic feature values that are associated with poor prognosis than tumors without these features. Removing these\n\nIdentifying job characteristics related to employed women's breastfeeding behaviors.\n\nPubMed\n\nSpitzmueller, Christiane; Zhang, Jing; Thomas, Candice L; Wang, Zhuxi; Fisher, Gwenith G; Matthews, Russell A; Strathearn, Lane\n\n2018-05-14\n\nFor employed mothers of infants, reconciliation of work demands and breastfeeding constitutes a significant challenge. The discontinuation of breastfeeding has the potential to result in negative outcomes for the mother (e.g., higher likelihood of obesity), her employer (e.g., increased absenteeism), and her infant (e.g., increased risk of infection). Given previous research findings identifying return to work as a major risk factor for breastfeeding cessation, we investigate what types of job characteristics relate to women's intentions to breastfeed shortly after giving birth and women's actual breastfeeding initiation and duration. Using job titles and job descriptors contained in a large Australian longitudinal cohort data set (N = 809), we coded job titles using the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL)'s Occupational Information Network (O*NET) database and extracted job characteristics. Hazardous working conditions and job autonomy were identified as significant determinants of women's breastfeeding intentions, their initiation of breastfeeding, and ultimately their breastfeeding continuation. Hence, we recommend that human resource professionals, managers, and public health initiatives provide breastfeeding-supportive resources to women who, based on their job characteristics, are at high risk to prematurely discontinue breastfeeding to ensure these mothers have equal opportunity to reap the benefits of breastfeeding.

Our objective for this study was to distinguish the subtypes by ophthalmologic features after head-shaking and positional maneuvers, which are not yet recognized as differential diagnostic tools in most common forms of spinocerebellar ataxias. Of the 302 patients with a diagnosis of cerebellar ataxia in 3 Korean University Hospitals from June 2011 to June 2012, 48 patients with spinocerebellar ataxia types 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, or 8 or with undetermined spinocerebellar ataxias were enrolled. All patients underwent a video-oculographic recording of fixation abnormalities, gaze-evoked nystagmus, positional and head-shaking nystagmus, and dysmetric saccades. Logistic regression analysis controlling for disease duration revealed that spontaneous and positional downbeat nystagmus and perverted head-shaking nystagmus were strong predictors for spinocerebellar ataxia 6, whereas saccadic intrusions and oscillations were identified as positive indicators of spinocerebellar ataxia 3. In contrast, the presence of gaze-evoked nystagmus and dysmetric saccades was a negative predictor of spinocerebellar ataxia 2. Positional maneuvers and horizontal head shaking occasionally induced or augmented saccadic intrusions/oscillations in patients with spinocerebellar ataxia types 1, 2, and 3 and undetermined spinocerebellar ataxia. The results indicated that perverted head-shaking nystagmus may be the most sensitive parameter for SCA6, whereas saccadic intrusions/oscillations are the most sensitive for spinocerebellar ataxia 3. In contrast, a paucity of gaze-evoked nystagmus and dysmetric saccades is more indicative of spinocerebellar ataxia 2. Head-shaking and positional maneuvers aid in defining ocular motor characteristics in spinocerebellar ataxias. Â© 2013 Movement Disorder Society.

Diagnosis of NIFTP requires evaluation of the complete tumor border or capsule. The presence of tumor invasion in follicular thyroid neoplasms with papillary-like nuclear features has been recently discussed by many authors. In this study, we examined the predictive value and association of follicular morphological characteristics with the tumor invasion. In addition, we analyzed the association between tumor encapsulation and molecular profile in EFVPTC/NIFTP cases. A total of 106 cases of FVPTC were included in the study. The tumors were grouped based on the presence of tumor capsule and characteristics of tumor border, as 1) completely encapsulated tumors without invasion, 2) encapsulated tumors with invasion, 3) infiltrative tumors without a capsule. Clinicopathological features, histomorphological features [nuclear criteria, minor diagnostic features, follicles oriented perpendicular to tumor border/capsule (FOPBC)] and molecular alterations in BRAF, NRAS, and KRAS genes were evaluated. FOPBC were significantly more frequently seen in encapsulated tumors with invasion (p = 0.008). The nuclear features were not associated with the presence of encapsulation and characteristics of tumor border. BRAF mutation was more frequent in infiltrative tumors, while NRAS mutation was more frequent in encapsulated tumors, but the results were not statistically significant (p = 0.917). In conclusion, FOPBC histomorphological feature may be associated with tumor invasion in EFVPTC/NIFTP. Additionally, BRAF/KRAS/NRAS mutation analysis may prevent inadequate treatment in these patients.\n\nA P-Norm Robust Feature Extraction Method for Identifying Differentially Expressed Genes\n\nPubMed Central\n\nLiu, Jian; Liu, Jin-Xing; Gao, Ying-Lian; Kong, Xiang-Zhen; Wang, Xue-Song; Wang, Dong\n\n2015-01-01\n\nIn current molecular biology, it becomes more and more important to identify differentially expressed genes closely correlated with a key biological process from gene expression data. In this paper, based on the Schatten p-norm and Lp-norm, a novel p-norm robust feature extraction method is proposed to identify the differentially expressed genes. In our method, the Schatten p-norm is used as the regularization function to obtain a low-rank matrix and the Lp-norm is taken as the error function to improve the robustness to outliers in the gene expression data. The results on simulation data show that our method can obtain higher identification accuracies than the competitive methods. Numerous experiments on real gene expression data sets demonstrate that our method can identify more differentially expressed genes than the others. Moreover, we confirmed that the identified genes are closely correlated with the corresponding gene expression data.

Given profiling data from two types of samples, genes that most distinguish the samples (marker genes) are good candidates for subsequent in-depth experimental studies and developing decision support systems for diagnosis, prognosis, and monitoring. This work proposes a mixture of feature relevance experts as a method for identifying marker genes and illustrates the idea using published data from samples labeled as acute lymphoblastic and myeloid leukemia (ALL, AML). A feature relevance expert implements an algorithm that calculates how well a gene distinguishes samples, reorders genes according to this relevance measure, and uses a supervised learning method [here, support vector machines (SVMs)] to determine the generalization performances of different nested gene subsets. The mixture of three feature relevance experts examined implement two existing and one novel feature relevance measures. For each expert, a gene subset consisting of the top 50 genes distinguished ALL from AML samples as completely as all 7,070 genes. The 125 genes at the union of the top 50s are plausible markers for a prototype decision support system. Chromosomal aberration and other data support the prediction that the three genes at the intersection of the top 50s, cystatin C, azurocidin, and adipsin, are good targets for investigating the basic biology of ALL/AML. The same data were employed to identify markers that distinguish samples based on their labels of T cell/B cell, peripheral blood/bone marrow, and male/female. Selenoprotein W may discriminate T cells from B cells. Results from analysis of transcription profiling data from tumor/nontumor colon adenocarcinoma samples support the general utility of the aforementioned approach.

It is not clear whether borderline personality related characteristics in children share etiological features with adult borderline personality disorder. We investigated the etiology of borderline personality related characteristics in a longitudinal cohort study of 1,116 pairs of same-sex twins followed from birth through age 12 years. Borderline personality related characteristics measured at age 12 years were highly heritable, were more common in children who had exhibited poor cognitive function, impulsivity, and more behavioral and emotional problems at age 5 years, and co-occurred with symptoms of conduct disorder, depression, anxiety, and psychosis. Exposure to harsh treatment in the family environment through age 10 years predicted borderline personality related characteristics at age 12 years. This association showed evidence of environmental mediation and was stronger among children with a family history of psychiatric illness, consistent with diathesisâstress models of borderline etiology. Results indicate that borderline personality related characteristics in children share etiological features with borderline personality disorder in adults and suggest that inherited and environmental risk factors make independent and interactive contributions to borderline etiology.

Bodily expression is gaining in attention as one of these sources of information. However, to date, the question of how bodily expression can convey different emotions has largely been addressed in research relying on acted emotion displays. Following a more contextualized approach, the present study aims to identify features of bodily expression (i.e., posture and activity of the upper body and the head) that relate to genuine emotional experience during interaction with a serious game. In a multimethod approach, 70 undergraduates played a serious game relating to financial education while their bodily expression was captured using an off-the-shelf depth-image sensor (Microsoft Kinect). In addition, self-reports of experienced enjoyment, boredom, and frustration were collected repeatedly during gameplay, to address the dynamic changes in emotions occurring in educational tasks. Results showed that, firstly, the intensities of all emotions indeed changed significantly over the course of the game. Secondly, by using generalized estimating equations, distinct features of bodily expression could be identified as significant indicators for each emotion under investigation. A participant keeping their head more turned to the right was positively related to frustration being experienced, whereas keeping their head more turned to the left was positively related to enjoyment. Furthermore, having their upper body positioned more closely to the gaming screen was also positively related to frustration. Finally, increased activity of a participantâs head emerged as a significant indicator of boredom being experienced. These results confirm the value of bodily expression as an indicator\n\nDiscriminative Features Mining for Offline Handwritten Signature Verification\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nNeamah, Karrar; Mohamad, Dzulkifli; Saba, Tanzila; Rehman, Amjad\n\n2014-03-01\n\nSignature verification is an active research area in the field of pattern recognition. It is employed to identify the particular person with the help of his/her signature's characteristics such as pen pressure, loops shape, speed of writing and up down motion of pen, writing speed, pen pressure, shape of loops, etc. in order to identify that person. However, in the entire process, features extraction and selection stage is of prime importance. Since several signatures have similar strokes, characteristics and sizes. Accordingly, this paper presents combination of orientation of the skeleton and gravity centre point to extract accurate pattern features of signature data in offline signature verification system. Promising results have proved the success of the integration of the two methods.\n\nFeatures of current-voltage characteristic of nonequilibrium trench MOS barrier Schottky diode\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMamedov, R. K.; Aslanova, A. R.\n\n2018-06-01\n\nThe trench MOS barrier Schottky diodes (TMBS diode) under the influence of the voltage drop of the additional electric field (AEF) appearing in the near-contact region of the semiconductor are in a nonequilibrium state and their closed external circuit flows currents in the absence of an external voltage. When an external voltage is applied to the TMBS diode, the current transmission is described by the thermionic emission theory with a specific feature. Both forward and reverse I-V characteristics of the TMBS diode consist of two parts. In the initial first part of the forward I-V characteristic there are no forward currents, but reverse saturation currents flow, in its subsequent second part the currents increase exponentially with the voltage. In the initial first part of the reverse I-V characteristic, the currents increase in an abrupt way and in the subsequent second part the saturation currents flow under the action of the image force. The mathematical expressions for forward and reverse I-V characteristic of the TMBS diode and also narrow or nanostructure Schottky diode are proposed, which are in good agreement with the results of experimental and calculated I-V characteristics.\n\nIdentifying protein complex by integrating characteristic of core-attachment into dynamic PPI network.\n\nPubMed\n\nShen, Xianjun; Yi, Li; Jiang, Xingpeng; He, Tingting; Yang, Jincai; Xie, Wei; Hu, Po; Hu, Xiaohua\n\n2017-01-01\n\nHow to identify protein complex is an important and challenging task in proteomics. It would make great contribution to our knowledge of molecular mechanism in cell life activities. However, the inherent organization and dynamic characteristic of cell system have rarely been incorporated into the existing algorithms for detecting protein complexes because of the limitation of protein-protein interaction (PPI) data produced by high throughput techniques. The availability of time course gene expression profile enables us to uncover the dynamics of molecular networks and improve the detection of protein complexes. In order to achieve this goal, this paper proposes a novel algorithm DCA (Dynamic Core-Attachment). It detects protein-complex core comprising of continually expressed and highly connected proteins in dynamic PPI network, and then the protein complex is formed by including the attachments with high adhesion into the core. The integration of core-attachment feature into the dynamic PPI network is responsible for the superiority of our algorithm. DCA has been applied on two different yeast dynamic PPI networks and the experimental results show that it performs significantly better than the state-of-the-art techniques in terms of prediction accuracy, hF-measure and statistical significance in biology. In addition, the identified complexes with strong biological significance provide potential candidate complexes for biologists to validate.\n\nFeature engineering for drug name recognition in biomedical texts: feature conjunction and feature selection.\n\nPubMed\n\nLiu, Shengyu; Tang, Buzhou; Chen, Qingcai; Wang, Xiaolong; Fan, Xiaoming\n\n2015-01-01\n\nDrug name recognition (DNR) is a critical step for drug information extraction. Machine learning-based methods have been widely used for DNR with various types of features such as part-of-speech, word shape, and dictionary feature. Features used in current machine learning-based methods are usually singleton features which may be due to explosive features and a large number of noisy features when singleton features are combined into conjunction features. However, singleton features that can only capture one linguistic characteristic of a word are not sufficient to describe the information for DNR when multiple characteristics should be considered. In this study, we explore feature conjunction and feature selection for DNR, which have never been reported. We intuitively select 8 types of singleton features and combine them into conjunction features in two ways. Then, Chi-square, mutual information, and information gain are used to mine effective features. Experimental resul"
