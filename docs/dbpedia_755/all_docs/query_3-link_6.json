EDITOR’S NOTE Negara Brunei Darussalam, or simply known as Brunei – a small equatorial country in southeast Asia, has been attracting the world for many years. Decorated with the lush green rainforests, the country is labeled as ‘Abode of Peace’. Brunei is mostly popular for its oil and natural gas trade, and it carries the aura of one of the wealthiest economies in the region. Apart from this, the country is also gaining attention for its world-class education system. Studying in Brunei is considered a leisure opportunity due to its picturesque landscapes. Brunei has an Islamic heritage, and the country is governed by a monarchy. As a result, the oﬃcial educational ideology was primarily centered on devotion towards the Sultan. Brunei's previous reliance on Britain, however, has resulted in the country's educational curricula and institutions being inﬂuenced by the British educational system. Brunei's educational system is relatively new, as formal education began in the last century. The education system was reorganized in 1974 due to an oﬃcial governmental commission report aimed at managing educational policy and distributing educational resources to all learning institutions. In Brunei, the International Baccalaureate (IB) curriculum is taught in most schools. Previously, Brunei's schools were only for boys. However, the regulations have evolved throughout time, and the government now allows girls to attend school. A LAND OF ENDLESS EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES Brunei\n\n5. Brunei's educational system is mostly divided into two categories: public and private schools. There are also a handful of missionary schools that cater to Catholics and Anglicans, as well as Islamic schools, among private schools. While most schools teach in English, certain schools prefer to teach in Arabic or Chinese. However, students are required to learn the oﬃcial language of Brunei, which is Malay, or Bahasa Melayu as it is known locally. Looking ahead, the government is proactively addressing education by implementing modern learning methods to boost Brunei's educational system. These methods range from investing in early childhood education to adopting international best practices in teaching and learning, as well as developing programs to promote lifelong learning and increase access to higher education. For most of the time, Brunei attracted people for its scenic beauty. But the qualitative transformation in education is leading the country to new heights. The system now provides a variety of school alternatives that both the residents and ex-pat families can choose from, including Arabic schools, religious schools, international schools, technical schools, and vocational schools. Hence, to introduce you to some of Brunei's ﬁnest schools, we at The Knowledge Review bring you our new edition, 'Best Performing Schools in Brunei'. We hope reading this edition will provide you with detailed insights into the schools in Brunei. So, let us explore these renowned schools by ﬂipping through the pages. Have a great read!

The land of beaches, diverse rainforest with great oil reserves and with one of the largest natural gas plants in the world, Brunei is also known for universal education. A very safe country, Brunei houses some of the best educational institutions in the world. It is the government's endeavour to provide quality education to all and is constantly striving for the same. One such school that we at The Knowledge Review came across is the International School Brunei that started off with a simple idea to educate a few children and went on to become a school of international repute. Humble Beginning, Remarkable History It all started in 1964, Datin Glass, a government officer's wife, started a tutorial group for her daughter and one or two friends and taught them by means of a correspondence course sent out and marked by the South Australian Correspondence School. The number of students grew quite rapidly and by 1970, the school moved to a site provided by the Brunei Government and was established as a department of the South Australian Correspondence School, known locally as the Supervision School. The school was a two-storey wooden building. By February 1971, there were 30 kindergarten pupils and 31 primary students. The enrolment continued to grow and by 1974, it had reached 160. In 1976, the school converted to a fully independent, private, preparatory school, employing trained teachers and adopting an education based on the UK primary school principles. International School Brunei was established as a not-for- profit school and a limited company on December 1, 1976. The school had a Board of Directors elected from the membership of the company. Currently ISB caters for over 1300 students comprising of Early Years, Primary, Secondary and Pre-University. As a non-selective and fully inclusive school, ISB is proud to work closely together with the local community in a distinctive, happy, family atmosphere. ISB offers an adapted England and Wales curriculum followed by IGCSE and the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme (IBDP). With over 40 nationalities celebrated in the staff and student team, ISB is proud to be truly international. World Class Facilities The school boasts world class facilities with well-equipped laboratories, workshops and classrooms, a 25m FINA- approved touch-pad competition swimming pool, a community Sports Hall, an eco-garden, and an international boarding facility. In addition, at ISB Centre for Inclusive Learning, ISB supports students with significant and complex learning needs in a purpose-built centre.

The school's warm, supportive and inclusive environment, combined with students of all abilities, cultures and backgrounds, inspires its students to become caring, open-minded global citizens geared for success in an ever-changing world. A Leadership Unparalleled The school's leadership team, headed by ISB's Executive Principal Mrs Laura Thomas, is a team of experienced international teachers - having worked in schools and leadership positions across the globe. When the pandemic hit Brunei in early 2020, as part of the school's push to make remote education accessible for its students during this challenging and unprecedented times, ISB operated as a virtual school for the third school term. Overcoming the Challenge ISB planned and prepared for their virtual school model during the 2020 March school holiday to quickly adapt their academic programme to ensure that learning is equitable and effective for all students to the greatest possible extent. Teachers received training to prepare them for the remote learning. Whilst virtual school did not replicate onsite learning, teachers delivered powerful instruction that allowed students to meet expected standards in the online environment. ISB ensured that learning was uninterrupted. The ISB Virtual School experience aligns with ISB mission - Everyone Excels in an inclusive learning environment. Students had worked in online and offline environments to continue with their learning journey, solve problems, think critically, and collaborate with other students and teachers. The provision offered to the students (both academic lessons and pastoral support) by the dedicated team has been absolutely world class. Attendance rates for ISB students at virtual school have been excellent (and\n\n13. Best Performing Schools in Brunei, 2021 sometimes have even exceeded attendance rates at normal school). The school also supported several students who are accessing the Virtual School from their home countries such as USA, New Zealand, Oman and India, as the students and their families are unable to travel back to Brunei. The Curriculum and Accreditations The school offers Early Years Foundation Stage Curriculum education from Pre-Kindy and an internationally adapted National Curriculum of England and Wales from Year 1 to Year 9 followed by IGCSEs and the IB Diploma programme in the Pre-University section.

Engaging Ways to Keep the Students Motivated in Online Classes Throughout the pandemic of COVID-19, students in all age categories were introduced to a new platform of online learning. Educational institutes, which include schools and most of the universities have switched to online learning for their academic studies. In recent reports we have experienced: the students are not showing interest in the online lectures and a few of the observations that teachers mentioned were speciﬁcally pointed out ‘students are falling into a rabbit hole of online distractions.’ Online classes for university students, especially where the students attend a lecture of two hours, it is easy to switch oﬀ and get distracted, as students just listen and take notes, rather than taking part in any activity. To tackle this scenario, experts suggested engaging ways to keep the students motivated in their online classes. · Making the Class Interactive The simplest way to check if the students are focused on the session is to ask them questions. Teachers can maintain student engagement by asking them questions about the topic. The idea that they could be asked any question will be enough to keep the students focused and appreciation for any correct answer will motivate them, eventually keeping them focused and encouraged about the ongoing session. · Adding Quizzes and Challenges in Online Sessions Everyone loves a pop quiz. Challenges and quizzes are great for motivating the students about their subject and online session. This is an eﬀective way of learning also for those students who are less attentive in the class as the questions will help them to remember key points that are being taught in the class. Making these quizzes a little competitive by adding points or a prize system will make it a bit more engaging for the students. It is an uncomplicated way to make online learning fun and interesting as all the students are getting involved as well as rewarding to those students who are working hard.

In classrooms, it was extremely easy to assign a class project and ask students to work in a team, but it can be a challenge in the new normal to assign students with such projects in their online classes. The online platforms can help by setting teachers set-up as administrators and splitting their classes according to the assigned projects. Students can also present their work or presentations in the sessions and teachers can provide individual feedback after displaying their work. Students love such activities and keep themselves focused and motivated in such online sessions. Also, engaging in such activities eﬀectively develops their interest and they start enjoying such online classes. · Interaction between Teacher and Students An eﬀortless way to increase students' motivation is taking their feedback on board. If the students are getting a chance to speak or provide feedback about the sessions, it will allow them with an individual response where they can share their views about the sessions and convey and discuss their diﬃculties with their teachers. Teachers can help the students overcome their diﬃculties and change several teaching patterns and adapt to new teaching styles which will eventually help the students to understand the topic, with an easy method. · Turn Mistakes into Learning Opportunities Most of the students are afraid of failure. They cannot overcome their fear of making a mistake and such situations can lead them to lose their conﬁdence because they are afraid of punishment or teachers might scold them because of their wrong answer. If this scenario is happening, students will eventually lose their motivation and stop attending online classes. Teachers can focus on such students and provide them with an opportunity to overcome these fears. They can oﬀer them personalized feedback and constructive criticism, by which the students can learn from their own mistakes and try to improvise. This process will build up their self-conﬁdence and they will start enjoying these sessions with the motivation to perform better. · Transform Online Assignments into Activities Students tend to take the word assignments as a burden. Since the online learning platforms are oﬀering various new formats of assignments like worksheets, online questionnaires, etc, replacing them with group activities will eventually develop interest among students and motivate them to engage actively in the online learning classes. · Getting the Students to Work and Focus on What They Have Learned After the online sessions, teachers can ask and do a quick go through, like a revision on the topic by open-ended questions that require higher thinking skills. Put the information in context and conduct a group discussion where students can share what they have learned in the session. Teachers can observe the students and solve their problems and sooner the teachers will act upon their diﬃculties; they are more likely to improvise the student's performance. These engaging ways are leading to improve communication between teacher and students, which is alike teaching actively in the classroom. Teachers can observe the students as well as their performance and guide them properly to overcome their diﬃculties and this will keep the students engaged with their studies and motivated for their online classes.

As the country's oldest institution, we are appreciative of the signiﬁcant contributions we have made to the country's educational system.

CHMS, BSB has been successful in We create an environment where students are developed harmoniously, socially, intellectually, physically, and aesthetically October 2021 | 22 | www.theknowledgereview.com\n\n25. integrating technology in teaching and learning process way back then. We have a strong team of innovative and digital savvy educators who had been educating and teaching fellow educators about various EdTech tools since 2014. Moreover, we are a Microsoft Showcase School and that gave us a leverage in using the right technology for the right cause. The school has already equipped students with Oﬃce 365 account and our secondary students have been using Microsoft Teams for the past two years. Primary students were connected with ClassDojo and Oﬃce 365 accounts. Based on the directives of the Brunei Government and Ministry of Education, Brunei Darussalam we were following remote learning for three months since March. Starting June, we adapted hybrid learning module and from August we went back to our traditional classroom setting. Though the whole process brought in a large disruption in teaching and learning, we were able to adapt to the 'new normal' with eﬀective and eﬃcient actions. Proper planning in adapting right EdTech tools enabled us to conduct eﬀective live lessons using Microsoft Teams. We ensured the type of EdTech tools used by teachers to ease of the burden of students and parents. For Primary school students, recorded lessons were shared in ClassDojo. Overall, CHMS, BSB was prepared to tackle the challenges that the pandemic imposed on us. There was no lack of learning because all learning methods were made possible with our preparedness with appropriate and students-familiar technologies and learning materials. We re-prepare, re- invest and reinforce processes to move forward with this new normal experience. Where would you place yourself in the future in the ﬁeld of education? As the pandemic COVID19 has reshaped the educational landscape, a probing question that has arisen out of this change is the redundancy of Schools. Education will exist and so will Schools. The forms of education might vary from Online Learning, hybrid learning but traditional school- based learning will deﬁnitely exists. As a most sought-after school, I believe that CHMS, BSB will be imparting holistic education to the diverse community of Brunei Darussalam in the future as well. Our school will be a centre where most eﬀective teaching approaches, techniques, and ideologies will be practiced. We will encourage innovations and their adaptation to speciﬁc circumstances and assist the creation of a community of parents and teachers who support each other. We believe in pedagogy, and always enhance teaching and learning with more student-centered approaches. With extending ownership in learning to students, the school has championed gamiﬁcation where students learn through games. Maintaining a curriculum that is contemporary which allows students to learn with diﬀerent devices, programs and techniques. We inculcate the qualities of propriety, righteousness, modesty, and remorsefulness in our students October 2021 | 23 | www.theknowledgereview.com\n\n28. Prof. Rakesh Khatri Corporate and Soft Skills Trainer, Director The R.K. Institute EdTech Pros and Cons Educational technology has evolved in exciting new ways, inspiring teachers, and students alike. From the ancient abacus to handheld calculators, from slide projectors and classroom ﬁlm strips to virtual reality and next-generation e-learning, educational technology has evolved in exciting new ways, inspiring teachers and students alike. The way we work, play, create, and communicate is always evolving as a result of technological advancements. As a result, it's only natural that digital technology advances. “The technical instruments and media that aid in the conveyance of knowledge, as well as its growth and exchange,” according to one major deﬁnition of educational technology. Take, for example, augmented reality and virtual reality. Technology innovation specialist Daniel Newman addresses utilizing AR and VR to ‘educate’ in his Forbes.com article EdTech, a portmanteau of the phrase ‘education technology,’ is that the mixture of IT tools and academic practices aimed toward facilitating and enhancing learning. ‘EdTech’ is a branch of technology dedicated to the creation and implementation of educational technologies (including software, hardware, and procedures). ‘EdTech is a study and ethical practice for supporting learning and increasing performance by designing, employing, and managing suitable technological processes and resources,’ according to the deﬁnition. Today’s classrooms have moved beyond the clunky desktop computers that were once the norm and are now tech- infused with tablets, interactive online courses, and even robots that can take notes and record lectures for school kids who are ill. October 2021 | 26 | www.theknowledgereview.com\n\n29. Automated Reports Thanks to educational technology and tools, it is easier to track progress and growth. With automated reports and real- time growth analysis, EdTech helps save time and eﬀort. There are various EdTech tools that are designed to help teachers with classroom management and administration.
