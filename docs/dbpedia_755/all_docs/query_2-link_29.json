        "text": "The identification of names and dates in larger corpora of historical texts is important for both traditional and digitally mediated research; it is part of reading as well as of exploring digital corpora. This paper is an introduction to a number of issues concerning named entity recognition (NER) for classical Chinese. In particular it introduces the \" Digital Archive of Buddhist Temple Gazetteers \" (http://buddhistinformatics.ddbc.edu.tw/ fosizhi/), as a benchmark corpus for NER on classical Chinese and illustrates how marked-up corpora can provide answers to question that could not otherwise be addressed.\n\nThis paper deals with several questions and problems related to the editing, digitization and analysis of Buddhist Dūnhuáng texts. The Dūnhuáng corpus of Chán (Zen) manuscripts is the most important source for the study of the early history of this Chinese Buddhist school. The authors discuss paleographic and textual features of the manuscripts and investigate several possibilities of TEI-compatible mark-up concerning the collation, translation, annotation, and semantic and syntactic analysis of this type of manuscript literature, in addition to methods of transformations into visual media. The approaches are exemplified by an experimental mark-up of the Dūnhuáng versions of the Platform Sūtra. In the second part of the paper, the newly initiated Chan Database Project is introduced and collaborative methods of dealing with Chán literature are discussed. In the appendix to the paper, the system of phonetic loans, as well as scribal conventions and errors in the manuscript versions of the Platform Sūtra are described and compared. Keywords: Platform Sūtra of the Sixth Patriarch (Liuzǔ Tanjing), Dūnhuang Manuscripts, Phonetic Loan Characters, Analytic Mark‐up, Zen Buddhism\n\nThis is a philological approach to the manuscript versions of the famous Platform Sūtra of the Sixth Patriarch 六祖壇經. The paper consists of three parts, the first part consisting of an overview on previous scholarship on the text; the second part deals with the textual features of the various manuscripts; the third part tries to contextualize the scripture within popular \"Platform congregations\" for administering the precepts. As one of the main results, I argue for a radical reinterpretation of the long title of the Dunhuang version of the Platform sutra, showing that \"jing 經 (sūtra)\" in the title originally referred to the Diamond sutra (central in the text itself and in the context of congregations during which the precepts were conferred), and not to the scripture itself. As such, the \"Platform sutra\" probably was a sermon delivered during one of these congregations; only in the course of time the reference of \"sūtra\" gradually shifted from external reference (to the Diamond sūtra) to \"internal\" reference of the scripture itself.\n\nThis article examines Song-to-Ming printed illustrations celebrating the power of the Diamond Sutra, one of the most widely copied Buddhist scriptures in East Asia. An integral part of printed copies of the Diamond Sutra, these illustrations reflect a strong popular taste appealing to common folks, connecting modern readers to a wider realm of vernacular Buddhism and popular Buddhist visual culture in traditional Chinese society, where indigenous beliefs, popular images, and various religious practices are freely borrowed, converged, and re-packaged. The first part of the study, “Buddhist Records of Magical Efficacy,” identifies the round-trip of protagonists to the underworld, and the efficacy of prolonging life in Tang-to-Northern Song miracle tales of the Diamond Sutra as two recurring features carried on in the Southern Song-Ming illustrated versions. The second part, “Illustrations of Miracle Tales,” examines illustrated miracle stories of the Diamond Sutra highlighting the underworld court, messengers from the underground, miraculous fungi, and magical writing. The third part, “Women in Vernacular Buddhist and Folklore Visual Cultures,” turns to good and evil stereotypes of women pictured in selected miracle tales. The author then also explores the half-animal, half-woman demons subjugated by Buddhist guardians, whose images are juxtaposed with the illustrated miracle stories in the Ming versions. Finally, the fourth part, “Publishers and Donors,” shifts to the social and religious context of the illustrated books of the Diamond Sutra. The extant Southern Song-Yuan woodcuts were likely printed by Hangzhou’s commercial publishers. A donor’s colophon and a hybrid Esoteric Buddhist pantheon in an early fifteenth-century version points to a multicultural community in early Ming Beijing. 《通俗佛教版畫所見的金剛經靈驗力》 【中文提要】 金剛經乃東亞文化圈中流傳最廣的佛經之一。本文旨在探討南宋至明初金剛經版畫所描繪的金剛經靈驗故事。這些插圖反映了吸引大眾的民間品味，使吾人一窺傳統中國社會中，在吸納了本土信仰、通俗圖像、以及多元宗教習俗後所融匯而成的通俗佛教及視覺文化。全文共分為四大部分。第一部分「佛教靈驗記」指出，往返冥府、續命延壽的故事主題，乃源自唐宋金剛經靈驗記書寫，並流傳到南宋至明木刻插圖版金剛經靈驗記的二大主題。第二部分「靈驗記插圖」，探討金剛經靈驗記版畫中的冥府、冥使來訪，以及與書經功德有關的芝草等靈驗表現。第三部分「通俗佛教及民俗視覺文化中的女性」，關注靈驗記版畫所見的女性善、惡面，以及明代金剛經版畫中，與靈驗記插圖併列的金剛圖像所添加的半人半獸女性鬼怪形象。第四部分「出版者與施主」，將重點轉移到金剛經木刻插圖出版的社會、宗教網絡。現存南宋、元版木刻版畫，可能都產自當時杭州的坊間印書店。一套帶有漢、梵合名之施主題記，以及混雜了密教與道教神群像的明初金剛經木刻版畫，則指向宣德年間北京城中的多元文化社群。\n\n(Wudangshan 武當山) is well known to have been the most holy mountain in the Ming. As the center of the Zhenwu 真武 (Perfect Warrior) cult, Wudangshan not only attracted millions of pilgrims, but also spread the Zhenwu cult to the entire empire, with many sites of the Zhenwu cult known as the ''Little Wudang Mounts'' (Xiao Wudang 小武當) and other regional branches (travel-palaces 行宮 etc.) modeling after Wudangshan. Among these regional Zhenwu branches, Mount Qiyun (Qiyunshan 齊雲山) was arguably the most important. This study explores the conscious effort of the Daoist clerical community to duplicate the Zhenwu cult of Wudangshan at Qiyunshan. I argue that the high point of Daoism at Qiyunshan was the Jiajing 嘉靖 emperor's (r. 1522–1566) patronage. This imperial support not only served the emperor's personal religious interest, it also provided political legitimacy to promote Jiajing's lineage and remap the religious landscape of the empire. Due to geographical, regional, and cultural differences, Qiyunshan was still distinguished from Wudangshan, and the main differences lay in the purposeful attempt to build up literati culture at Qiyunshan. In this sense, Qiyunshan deserved the nickname, ''Little Wudang in Jiangnan'' 江南小武當, and the cult of Zhenwu there illustrated its regional colors.\n\nIn China, beggars and other marginal and displaced figures with no clear social place or identity have long been associated with ghosts an demons. Both were considered marginal beings, dangerous and capable of harm and disruption if ignored. In order to expel or cope with ghosts and malevolent spirits, local communities staged a wide range of apotropaic or prophylactic ritual performances, which often involved street beggars or beggar households (gaihu) in the Suzhou area. In particular, at the end of the lunar year, beggars and the local poor dressed up like ghosts and demons and executed exorcism dances to drive out threatening malevolent forces and start the new year afresh. Zhou Chen's now famous Beggars and Street Characters, painted in Suzhou in 1516, might have been informed by contemporary practices surrounding ritual expulsions of this kind. Providing an inventory of wretchedness, degradation and physical affliction, his figures are indeed often shown with a combination of human and demonic visual features. Through a closer examination of some of the characters, it is the aim of this article to consider the reasons for their fiendish aspect and to explore how their iconographical feat ures shaped audiences' understanding of their overlapping identities."
