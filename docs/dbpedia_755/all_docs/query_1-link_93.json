The students take on the widely recognised IBDP curriculum for fulfilling academic challenge and purposeful holistic development. It provides a rigorous framework that is anchored in intellectual engagement with academic undertakings for university readiness. The programme promotes independent learning, featuring coursework components and final examinations that prepare students for success at university and beyond. The IBDP requires students to offer six main subjects, one from each of the six designated groups. In addition, three subjects are taken at Higher Level and three at Standard Level. All students must complete the three core components of Extended Essay, Theory of Knowledge as well as Creativity, Activity, Service to be eligible for the award of the IB Diploma.\n\nStudent Development\n\nThe school nurtures the holistic development of students through a student development framework that takes on a thematic and an inside-out approach. Programmes focusing on socio-emotional learning, character and citizenship education, student leadership development and service learning are incorporated into the six-year integrated curriculum to meet the needs of the developmental years.\n\nExperiential Programme\n\nThe Middle Years Experiential Programme takes the students on a journey of self-discovery. Through a plethora of curated activities, students will be taken out of their comfort zone and taught to adapt to changing situations. Reflecting and learning from these experiences will instill in them a can-do attitude and an appreciation of their strengths. The developmental focus of the programme covers: Discovering our Strengths (Year 1); Embracing our Diversity (Year 2); Working in Teams (Year 3). The outcomes of Years 1-3 student development are attained through the signature programmes planned for the Middle Years: Shamrock Programme (Years 1-2); Resilience Camp (Years 1-2); JCAS Programme (Years 1-3); House Challenge (Years 1-3).\n\nAscent Programme\n\nThe Senior Years Ascent Programme leverages on the foundation built during the Middle Years to challenge the students to play an active role in shaping their future. They will experience activities that offer latitude to innovate and to make a difference to the people around them. They will also be equipped with skills to resolve challenges with confidence and to become custodians of their own future. The developmental focus of the programme covers: Making a Difference (Year 4); Leading by Example (Year 5); Leaving a Legacy (Year 6). The outcomes of Years 4-6 student development are attained through the signature programmes planned for the Senior Years: Work Experience (Year 4); CAS Programme (Years 5-6); University Fair (Years 5-6)."
