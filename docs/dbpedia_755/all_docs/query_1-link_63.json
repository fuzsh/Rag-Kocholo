        "text": "Establish in 1917, and the first classroom is at the 1st floor of the old Limbang market. That time there were only a few students available, and this is how the school start.\n\nThe committee members of the school emphasize that the growth of Chinese Education is a virtue. So they start to form a formal committee group with proper organization chart. And also started to raise money from the public to build a bigger and better school for the children, for them to have a secure future ahead.\n\nThe “Fu Tek Chi” hall was build on the year 1937 with the kind donation from the school committee and public. And it was officially launch by the year 1938. The hall was marked with four words 礼义廉耻(li3 yi4 lian2 chi3) which are, “Manners”, “Morality”, “honest”, and “disgrace”. And to put all of this four words together is means “Honesty and Honor” This four words is the essence teaching of the Great Confucius, and it is the school motto of SRB Chung Hwa school. And this motto had been followed by thousands of students, and then make them the successful person they are today.\n\n1938, after the school hall was form, the school was bombarded by the united army.\n\nOn the year 1942, World War 2 started. Japanese invaded the Southeast Asia. And this also affected the Brunei country (Limbang’s neighbor), and the Limbang town also badly damage by the war. And the Japanese then use the Chung Hwa School as their military base, and also force student to learn Japanese.\n\nOn the year 1945, when the united army came to defend the Japanese, many building had been bombarded, and this also includes the Chung Hwa School. The school had been totally destroyed by the nuclear boom, all its left is just a pile of rubble. And this had marked a miserable day in the history of the Chung Hwa School.\n\nAt the year 1946, the boards of director of the Chun Hwa School Limbang are very determine, as they know to be a good human being, once must be educated. And to have educated, once must go to school. So they start to pelage assistant from the Government, and use the government servants hostel as a temporary classroom to teach students.\n\n1945, This is the temporary classroom for the students after the World War 2\n\n1946, The Chung Hwa School new building, build at the exact location where the temporary classroom were.\n\nThe group photo of the school board of members and all the teachers.\n\nDay by day, as time goes by. The number of students had increase dramatically. And the board of members knew that they now need more building to accommodate these new students.\n\n1954, the school board of members had then bough another land, and at 1956 the school had successfully build its very first concrete building which also knows as Block A, and on 1971, another block was build as an extension to the existing block which knows as Block B. And the school was been certified by the Education Department as Primary School Type A.\n\nPhoto of block A at 1959, the very first concrete building in the history of Chung Hwa School\n\nPhoto of basketball court\n\nAnd the numbers of students had then grow again, which the school had then build another block which know as Block C on the year 1996.\n\nOn year 2008, the school have 45 teachers, 1055 students, 25 classrooms. And addition to that, the school also has its own dentist clinic, a multimedia room, science lab, library, computer room, and a canteen. The school provide education from Kindergarten, until primary six.\n\nPhoto of block C at 1987, when students are getting greater, more new building was build to accommodated them.\n\nAs time goes by, the school has now stopped its service on 2010. The new school was build on anther location, and this historical building will be demolish soon.\n\nKerry and I went back to the school on the 1st of Jan 2011, and saw one of the board in the office. At first he tough that my brother and me are outsider, then we told him that we’re students here before.\n\nThen he told us the reason that they going to sell this school (which I think is total bullshit) is that the location is not safe for the students, cause the land behind the school might cause a landslide. So they decided to sell out the building, and let the contractor develop the place (the school is in the center of the town).\n\nFollow by more bullshit and stuff, which makes me want to get away from there as soon as possible.\n\nGuys, in my next post, I'll post the photos that I took during my visit to my school. And the memories I had during my primary school time.\n\nBefore that, check out the video of my school.\n\nCheers,\n\nWilson\n\nVisitation to my alma mater\n\nsource taken from the Chung Hwa School website\n\nLimbang Chung Hwa School Posts:\n\nHistory of SRB Chung Hwa School Limbang, post # 1 of 2\n\nHistory of SRB Chung Hwa School Limbang, post # 2 of 2\n\nLabels\n\nMount Singai at Kuching Sarawak Infographic Mount Singai Basic Introduction In Kuching, besides the Mount Santubong , Mount Singai is one of the most prominent mount, where average hikers will reach up to more than 100 people on a normal weekend. Mount Singai is 550m above sea level, I climbed the mountain countless time. This is a sacred mountain which owns by the Bidayuh people (one of the local Sarawak ethnic group) Bi means people, dayuh means land. The various Bidayuh tribes, such as the Bisingai, Bijagoi, Bratak, Biperoh, Pinyawa, Bisapug, Bisitang, Biatah, Bibukar and Sadong, had different places in the mountains in the old days as places of refuge for defense purposes. Special traditional rituals and ceremony are being perform on the summit of the mountain. Now the Catholic Memorial & Pilgrimage Centre is located in the middle of this mountain. For people who like exercise, this is the perfect place to come. There are stairs built to ease the\n\nWith just around 320 meters above sea level, the Bung Jagoi it's one of the most family friendly trail available in Kuching. The trail is super easy to hike, and suitable for children and old people, a good weekend gateway. Not to forget it also has a very nice viewpoint on the summit peak. And if hiking is not your cup of tea, you can also bring your family to the waterfall, just a few mins hike at the base of the mountain. There is a big parking space for your car, a few ringgit per car. This is a restaurant, and we paid our entrance fees here. They also offer daily tour package, which includes food. A friend of mine bring his 70+ years old mother and two young children to hike together, and impressively she made it to the summit. A waterfall trail just below the mountain. Good for children, as I know my children like to play in the water more than hiking to the summit. Very clear water from the mountain. view along the way to the summit A souvenir shop a few mins before t\n\nBung Bratak is located at Kampung Tembawang in Bau, a hill that's takes about 30 minutes to reach to the heritage center on the top of the ridge. Previously it was once the Bidayuh hill settlement of seven longhouses. The trail are covered by fallen leaves, and quite a lot of mosquito along the trail. Oh yes, durian season soon Entrance fees its RM10 per entry, I told the reception that I dont intent to visit the heritage center, as I'm planning to just hike and then descent. However, the reception is kind enough by just allow me to go in and visit the place. Mount Singai can be seen from the entrance of the heritage center At the heritage center, they have a Bidayuh traditional round house known as the ‘baruk’, a dining hall with kitchen and a reception hall Another way up to the heritage center, a cement road. But they only allow 4WD car to drive up, because some section are steep. Safety concern normal car migh\n\nPugu Beach situated at Lundu, after Pandan beach. Drive all the way up you will see road sign showing where is the beach location. Its a long stretch of beach, which lead all the way to the river mount of Sungai Sebako Besar. My friends and I decided to visit the place, and stay at the resort hut which we paid RM50 per night. Pugu Beach is about 7.11km long from bukit Gondol. The day I visited, was a hazy day. Partly due to the heavy burning on our neighboring country Kalimantan. A panoramic view of the Pugu Beach, the view are very nice if you are at the top of the bukit Gondol. A small hill on the other end of the beach. Enjoying the time hanging out with my buddies. Long time did not meet up with them, and camping together with them. Hope in future, we can have time to go for adventure together, just like old time. This is a simple resort hut, they also have a toilet and washroom. But they don't sell food, so we have to bring our own food and water.\n\nTop 3 waterfall in Kuching to go with family and friends easily Santubong Waterfall Kubah National Park Waterfall Gunung Gading National Park Waterfall As an explorer in Kuchicng, one of the question that I’m frequently being asked is “Which waterfall can I go over the weekend with my friends/family” What people want are: Easily access within 1 hour Near to the place they park Have public toilet and bathroom Can barbeque Then I start to put on my thinking cap, and listed a few. Among that I chose these three as the top, and I hope that this can serve as a guideline for you when you visit Kuching, and would like to visit the waterfall. The Santubong Waterfall How to go? Santubong is located on the North of the Kuching city, with just 35KM away from town. A 45 minutes car ride to reach the Santubong Mountain. The entrance is before the Santubong resort, and on the right there will be a power station, the entrance is just next to the power station"
