On these occasions, although under fire, by his skill and courage, he never failed to secure valuable information as to the enemy's movements.

Monsieur le Lieutenant de vaisseau Alfred Louis Marie Cintré, de la Marine francaise. For his services as a seaplane pilot in Egypt. He displayed great skill and intrepidity in a reconnaissance over Bir Saba on the 11th April, 1915, when his plane was subjected to a heavy shrapnel and musketry fire, and was hit in more than one place. With consummate coolness Lieutenant de vaisseau Cintré circled over Bir Saba again and again, until the number and position of the enemy were observed.

..... grant of the Victoria Cross to Squadron-Commander Richard Bell Davies, D.S.O., R.N., and of the Distinguished Service Cross to Flight Sub-Lieutenant Gilbert Formby Smylie, R.N., in recognition of their behaviour in the following circumstances:

On the 19th November these two officers carried out an air attack on Ferrijik Junction. Flight Sub-Lieutenant Smylie's machine was received by very heavy fire and brought down. The pilot planed down over the station, releasing all his bombs except one, which failed to drop, simultaneously at the station from a very low altitude. Thence he continued his descent into the marsh. On alighting he saw the one unexploded bomb, and set fire to his machine, knowing that the bomb would ensure its destruction. He then proceeded towards Turkish territory.

At this moment he perceived Squadron-Commander Davies descending, and fearing that he would come down near the burning machine and thus risk destruction from the bomb, Flight Sub-Lieutenant Smylie ran back and from a short distance exploded the bomb by means of a pistol bullet. Squadron-Commander Davies descended at a safe distance from the burning machine, took up Sub-Lieutenant Smylie, in spite of the near approach of a party of the enemy, and returned to the aerodrome, a feat of airmanship that can seldom have been equalled for skill and gallantry.

Dallas, in addition to performing consistently good work in reconnaissances and fighting patrols since December, 1915, has been brought to notice by the Vice-Admiral, Dover Patrol, for the specially gallant manner in which he has carried out his duties. Amongst other exploits is the following: On the 21st May, 1916, he sighted at least 12 hostile machines, which had been bombing Dunkerque. He attacked one at 7,000 feet, and then attacked a second machine close to him. After reloading, he climbed to 10,000 feet, and attacked a large hostile two-seater machine off Westende. The machine took fire and nose-dived seawards. Another enemy machine then appeared, which he engaged and chased to the shore, but had to abandon owing to having used all his ammunition.

Sub-Lieut. (now Act. Lieut.) Christopher Bernard Oxley, R.N. Sub-Lieut. Oxley was acting as Observer with Flight-Lieut. Edward H.

Two enemy machines were engaged at close, range and forced to retire, and as our machine withdrew Flight-Lieut. Dunning was hit in the left leg and the machine itself was badly damaged. Sub-Lieut. Oxley, having first improvised a tourniquet, which he gave to Flight Lieut. Dunning, took control of the machine, whilst the latter put on the tourniquet.

Harkness could not descend so low owing to the very heavy antiaircraft fire which had by this time been opened on the machines, but he dropped some of his bombs on the shed, and then proceeded to Berchem St. Agathe, which he also bombed.

Act. Lieut. Frank Stewart Lofthouse, R.N.R. Lieut. Lofthouse showed admirable presence of mind on the occasion of the attack by an Austrian cruiser on a group of drifters in the Adriatic on the 9th July, 1916. When the cruiser opened fire on his drifter at point-blank range, this officer ordered the crew to put on lifebelts, and immediately went to the wireless apparatus himself and twice sent out a message as to the presence of the cruiser. Whilst he was sending this message three shots hit the ship. He then came on deck and, finding his ship was sinking, he got his crew overboard and by his example and behaviour kept them together until they were picked up six hours later.

Skipper Harold John Goldspink, R.N.R., 1937 W.S.A.

Skipper James Ritchie, R.N.R., 1271 W.S.A. Skipper Ritchie behaved in an admirable manner and displayed great coolness under fire on the occasion of the attack by an Austrian cruiser on a. group of drifters in the Adriatic, on the 9th July, 1916.

Honours for the Royal Naval Air Service.

..... award of the Distinguished Service Cross to the undermentioned Officers:

Flt. Cdr. John Callaghan Brooke, R.N.A.S. In recognition of his services in the East Indies and Egypt Seaplane Squadron during the period 1st April 1916-31st March 1917. During this time he took part in several valuable reconnaissances and bombing flights, obtaining important information, and doing considerable damage to enemy organisations.

Flt. Cdr. Thomas Francis Netterville Gerrard, R.N.A.S. In recognition of his services during an air fight on the 4th June, 1917. This officer led his flight against 15-20 hostile aeroplanes, and alone had ten engagements with these machines. He attacked one, and fired sixty rounds into its cockpit at point-blank range, the enemy machine rolling over and over for 3,000 feet, and then falling vertically out of control. He then attacked another enemy machine which had dived on to one of our machines from behind, and with the help of a Scout he shot it down, the enemy being seen to crash to the ground. Another hostile scout was then attacked by pilot, end-on, and received a long burst at very close range, the enemy going down in a spin, but apparently righting himself lower down. During this last encounter Flt. Cdr. Gerrard's machine was riddled with bullets, but, by fine piloting, he landed safely, although all but his lateral controls were shot away and his machine damaged to such an extent as to require return to Depot for complete rebuilding. This officer has now destroyed at least seven hostile aircraft. He was on active service in France and Belgium from April to September, 1916, and during that period performed much valuable work.

Flt. Cdr. Reginald Frederick Stuart Leslie, R.N.A.S. In recognition of his gallantry in pursuing hostile raiding aeroplanes out to sea in a land machine on the 25th May, 1917. He attacked one hostile aeroplane, and caused it to descend in a steep nose dive, emitting smoke and steam. He was unable to observe its fate, as he was himself immediately attacked from behind by two other hostile machines and temporarily lost control. When he regained control, the machine which he had first attacked had disappeared, and two others were proceeding eastwards at a considerable height above him. He then returned safely to his aerodrome.

Flt. Lieut. Guy Duncan Smith, R.N.A.S. In recognition of his services in the East Indies and Egypt Seaplane Squadron during the period 1st April, 1916-31st March, 1917.
