GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS\n\n1. Purpose. The primary purpose of decorations is public recognition of acts of heroism performed and outstanding services rendered which were above and beyond that normally expected and which distinguished the individual or unit among those performing similar acts or service. A judicious use of decorations provides incentive to greater effort and builds morale; an injudicious use will destroy basic value. Promptness with which decorations are presented is an important morale factor.\n\n2. Recommendations. Recommendations for awards of decorations may be initiated by any officer and submitted via official channels to the Secretary of the Navy or, in time of war, to the appropriate officer having been delegated authority by the Secretary of the Navy to make awards. Recommendations should be submitted as promptly as practicable after the performance of the act or service. Such recommendations should meet the following conditions:\n\na. Be based upon known facts and include, if practicable, the incontestable testimony of at least two eyewitnesses.\n\nb. Contain a complete and yet concise description of the act or service including dates and exact information concerning the status of the person recommended at the time the act or service was performed.\n\nc. Be submitted in such detail that the awarding authority may determine whether or not the act or service meets the requirements for the award.\n\nd. Be accompanied by a proposed citation.\n\ne. All recommendations for unit awards shall be forwarded via operational commanders, type commanders (when appropriate), and the Chief of Naval Operations for pertinent comments and positive recommendations before further transmittal to the Navy Department Board of Decorations and Medals. All recommendations for unit awards should be made in accordance with Part II of this manual.\n\nf. In the event any Navy or Marine Corps unit recommended for a unit award operated under a joint commander for any portion of the time contained in the recommendation, an expression of opinion concerning the meritorious services of that unit shall be obtained from the joint commander concerned.\n\ng. All recommendations for the Medal of Honor, Navy Cross, and Distinguished Service Medal shall be forwarded via the administrative chain of command and the Chief of Naval Operations for pertinent comments and positive recommendations before transmittal to the Navy Department Board of Decorations and Medals. In the case of proposed Marine Corps recipients for the Medal of Honor, Navy Cross, or Distinguished Service Medal, the recommendations should be forwarded via the Commandant of the Marine Corps, before transmittal to the Chief of Naval Operations.\n\nh. All recommendations for awards to flag or general officers shall be forwarded via the Chief of Naval Operations before transmittal to the Board of Decorations and Medals. In the case of Marine Corps general officers, the Commandant of the Marine Corps should make his recommendation via the Chief of Naval Operations.\n\ni. After action by the Board of Decorations and Medals on recommendations for the Medal of Honor, Navy Cross, Distinguished Service Medal, and unit awards, the recommendation shall be transmitted to the Secretary of the Navy via the Chief of Naval Operations.\n\nj. Disapproval of a recommendation by an officer subordinate to the commander or military department having authority to award the decoration will not alone constitute authority for the return of the recommendation to the initiator.\n\nk. Lost recommendations. When the recommendations are made within the prescribed period of time and lost, the certificate of an officer or the affidavit of an enlisted man to the effect that the recommendation\n\n-- 1 --\n\nwas made in the prescribed time limit and placed in official channels, accompanied by a statement of the substance of said recommendation, or preferably a copy thereof, may be accepted and the case considered on its own merits.\n\n3. Time limits. Except in time of war or national emergency, recommendations for award of the Medal of Honor, Navy Cross, Distinguished Service Medal, Silver Star Medal, and Navy and Marine Corps Medal must be submitted within 3 years, and the award must be made within 5 years of the date of the act or service. Recommendations for the Distinguished Flying Cross must be initiated within 2 years, and the award must be made within 3 years of the date of the act or service. There is no established time limit for recommendation for; or award of the Legion of Merit, Bronze Star Medal. Air Medal, Letter of Commendation, Purple Heart, Presidential Unit Citation, or Navy Unit Commendation.\n\n4. Delegation of authority. In time of war authority to award, except posthumously or in absentia, the Navy Cross, Legion of Merit, Silver Star Medal, Distinguished Flying Cross, Navy and Marine Corps Medal, Bronze Star Medal, Air Medal, and Purple Heart to personnel under their command may be delegated to all fleet commanders. Commanders in chief may be authorized by the Secretary of the Navy to delegate their authority to make the awards enumerated above to any flag commands within their fleets.\n\n5. Posthumous awards. In case an individual who distinguishes himself dies before the making of an award to which he is entitled the award may nevertheless be made and the medal, cross, bar, or other emblem, or insignia presented to the official next of kin of the deceased within 5 years from the date of the act or service justifying the award thereof.\n\n6. Presentation of decorations. If the recipient of a Medal of Honor is within reasonable distance, he will be ordered to Washington and the presentation will be made by the President of the United States, or by the Secretary of the Navy as the President's personal representative. Otherwise the Medal of Honor will be presented with appropriate ceremony by the senior officer present. All other awards will be presented by the Secretary of the Navy or the highest ranking officer present in accordance with established procedures. Presentation will be made with appropriate ceremony as soon as practicable after the award is authorized. Awards made posthumously will be presented to the next of kin of the recipient in accordance with established procedure, paralleling those made to living recipients.\n\n7. Replacement of medals. Whenever a decoration, medal, bar, rosette or other device presented in accordance with existing laws and regulations, shall have been lost, destroyed, or rendered unfit for use, without fault or neglect on the part of the person to whom it was awarded, it shall be replaced without charge.\n\n8. Limitation of medals. No more than one decoration of the same type shall be awarded to any one person, except when awarded as specified in section 15, but for each succeeding deed, act, or achievement sufficient to justify an award a gold star will be awarded in lieu thereof. Not more than one of the several decorations authorized by Federal law or Executive order will be awarded for the same act or service. No medal, cross, bar, or other emblem or insignia shall be awarded or presented to any individual or to the representative of any individual whose entire service subsequent to the time he distinguished himself shall not have been honorable.\n\n9. Appurtenances and devices authorized for decorations and medals; stars for subsequent awards, and miscellaneous devices:\n\na. Gold stars. The gold stars presented in lieu of additional awards of the same decoration to be worn upon the suspension ribbon of the medal will be of a size inscribed in a circle five-sixteenths inch in diameter. Gold stars worn upon the ribbon representing the medal to indicate additional awards, shall be of a size inscribed in a circle five-sixteenths inch in diameter. In lieu of five stars, one silver star of the same dimensions will be worn on the ribbon bar or on the suspension ribbon of the medal.\n\nb. Bronze stars. Bronze stars authorized to be worn upon the ribbon bars of the Commendation Ribbon, Presidential Unit Citation, Navy Unit Commendation, Navy Good Conduct Medal, Naval Reserve Medal, campaign and service medals, shall be of a size inscribed in a circle three-sixteenths inch in diameter. Bronze stars also may be worn on the suspension ribbon of Area Campaign medals and the Naval Reserve Medal. In lieu of five such stars, one silver star of a size inscribed in a circle five-sixteenths inch shall be worn.\n\nThe first star authorized to be worn upon a ribbon shall be centered upon the ribbon. If more than one star is worn they shall be placed in a horizontal line close to and symmetrically about the center of the ribbon.

MEDAL OF HONOR\n\n1. The act of 7 August 1942, amending the act of 4 February 1919, provides in section 1: \"That the President of the United States be, and he is hereby, authorized to present, in the name of Congress, a Medal of Honor to any person who, while in the naval service of the United States, shall, in action involving actual conflict with the enemy, or in the line of his profession, distinguish himself conspicuously by gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty and without detriment to the mission of his command or to the command to which attached. Provided, That the design of this medal shall be the same as that adopted pursuant to the act approved December 21, 1861 (12 Stat. 330).\" However, for the information of those holding Medals of Honor previously authorized by law, the following information is pertinent:\n\na. The Medal of Honor for enlisted men was originally authorized in the act of 21 December 1861. This act was subsequently modified many times, and finally in the act of 3 March 1901, the following provision was made: \"That any enlisted man of the Navy or Marine Corps who shall have distinguished himself in battle or displayed extraordinary heroism in the line of his profession shall, upon the recommendation of his commanding officer, approved by the flag officer and the Secretary of the Navy, receive a gratuity and Medal of Honor as provided for seamen in section 1407 of the Revised Statutes.\" This gratuity for enlisted men was set at $100.\n\nb. The Medal of Honor was originally authorized for officers of the Navy and Marine Corps in the act of 3 March 1915, which provides: \"The President of the United States is hereby empowered to prepare a suitable Medal of Honor to be awarded to any officer of the Navy, Marine Corps, or Coast Guard who shall have distinguished himself in battle or displayed extraordinary heroism in the line of his profession.\"\n\n3. MEDAL OF HONOR (1917-18) (OBSOLETE)\n\n1.

MEDAL OF HONOR ROLL\n\n1. Public Act No. 56, approved 27 April 1916, established in the Department of the Army and in the Department of the Navy, respectively, a roll, designated as the Army and Navy Medal of Honor Roll.\n\n2. \"Upon written application made to the Secretary of the proper department, and subject to the conditions and requirements hereinafter contained, the name of each surviving person who has served in the military or naval service of the United States in any war, who has attained or shall attain the age of 65 years, and who has been awarded a Medal of Honor for having in action involving actual conflict with an enemy distinguished himself conspicuously by gallantry or intrepidity, at the risk of his life, above and beyond the call of duty, and who was honorably discharged from the service by muster out, resignation, or otherwise, shall be, by the Secretary of the proper department, entered and recorded on said roll. (NOTE: Personnel placed on the retired list of the Navy are considered as members of the naval service.) Applications for entry on said roll shall be made in such form and under such regulations as shall be prescribed by the Department of the Army and Department of the Navy, respectively, and proper blanks and instructions shall be furnished by the proper Secretary without charge, upon request made by any person claiming the benefits of this act.\"\n\n3. \"It shall be the duty of the Secretary of the Army and of the Secretary of the Navy to carry this act into effect and to decide whether each applicant, under this act, in his Department is entitled to the benefit of this act. If the official award of the Medal of Honor to the applicant, or the official notice to him thereof, shall appear to show that the Medal of Honor was awarded to the applicant for such an act as is required by the provisions of this act, it shall be deemed sufficient to entitle the applicant to such special pension without further investigation. Otherwise, all official correspondence, orders, reports, recommendations, requests and other evidence now on file in any public office or department shall be considered. A certificate of service and of\n\n-- 6 --\n\nthe act of heroism, gallantry, bravery, or intrepidity for which the Medal of Honor was awarded, and enrollment under this act, and of the right of the special pensioner to be entitled to and to receive the special pension granted by the act, shall be furnished each person whose name shall be so entered on said roll. The Secretary of the Army and the Secretary of the Navy shall deliver to the Veterans' Administration a certified copy of each of such said certificates as he may issue, as aforesaid, and the same shall be full and sufficient authority to the Veterans' Administration for the payment by him to the beneficiary named in each such certificate the special pension provided for.\"\n\n4. \"Each such surviving person whose name shall have been entered on said roll in accordance with this act shall be entitled to and shall receive and be paid by the Veterans' Administration, out of any moneys in the Treasury of the United States not otherwise appropriated a special pension of $10 per month for life, payable quarter yearly. The Veterans' Administration shall make all necessary rules and regulations for making payment of such special pensions to the beneficiaries thereof.\"\n\n5. \"Such special pension shall begin on the day that such person shall file his application for enrollment on said roll in the office of the Secretary of the Army or the Secretary of the Navy after the passage and approval of this act, and shall continue during the life of the beneficiary.\"\n\n6. \"Such special pension shall not deprive any such special pensioner of any other pension or of any benefit, right, or privilege to which he is or may hereafter be entitled under any existing or subsequent law, but shall be in addition thereto.\"\n\n7. \"The special pension allowed under this act shall not be subject to any attachment, execution, levy, tax, lien, or detention under any process whatever.\"\n\n8. \"In case any person has been awarded two or more Medals of Honor, he shall not be entitled to and shall not receive more than one such special pension.\"\n\n9. \"Men in the service shall not be considered in applications filed under this act.\"\n\n5. BREVET MEDAL\n\nThe Brevet Medal was authorized for issue to any officer holding a brevet commission for distinguished conduct and public service in the presence of the enemy during the Mexican War, Civil War, Spanish-American War, Philippine Insurrection, and the Boxer Hostilities of 1900.\n\n6. NAVY CROSS\n\n1. The act of 7 August 1942 (sec. 2), amending the act of 4 February 1919, provides: \"That the President be, and he hereby is, further authorized to present, but not in the name of Congress, a Navy Cross of appropriate design and ribbon, together with a rosette or other device to be worn in lieu thereof to any person who, while serving in any capacity with the naval service of the United States, distinguishes himself by extraordinary heroism in connection with military operations against an armed enemy.\"\n\n7.

SILVER STAR MEDAL\n\n1. The act of 7 August 1942 (sec. 4), provides: \"That the President be, and he hereby is, further authorized to present, but not in the name of Congress, a Silver Star Medal of appropriate design and a ribbon together with a rosette or other device to be worn in lieu thereof, to any person who, while serving in any capacity with the Navy of the United States, since 6 December 1941, has distinguished himself or who hereafter shall distinguish himself conspicuously by gallantry and intrepidity in action, such gallantry and service not being sufficient to justify the award of a Medal of Honor or a Navy Cross.\"\n\n2. The act of 7 August 1942 (sec. 10), provides: \"That in cases of persons now in the naval service for whom the award of the Medal of Honor, Distinguished Service Medal, or the Navy Cross, has been recommended in full compliance with then existing regulations, but on account of services which, though Insufficient fully to justify the award of the Medal of Honor, the Distinguished Service Medal, or the Navy Cross, appear to have been such as to justify the award of the Silver Star Medal hereinbefore provided, such cases may be considered and acted upon under the provisions of this act authorizing award of the Silver Star Medal, notwithstanding that said services may have been rendered more than 5 years before said cases shall have been considered as authorized by this proviso, but all consideration or any action upon any of said cases shall be based exclusively upon official records now on file in the Navy Department.\"\n\n9. LEGION OF MERIT\n\n1. The act of 20 July 1942 (sec. 2) (1), provides: \"That there is hereby created a decoration to be known as the Legion of Merit, which shall have suitable appurtenances and devices and not more than four degrees, and which the President, under such rules and regulations as he shall prescribe, may award to:\n\na. Personnel of the armed forces of the United States and of the Government of the Philippines, and\n\n-- 7 --\n\nb. Personnel of the armed forces of friendly foreign nations who, since the proclamation. of an emergency by the President on September 8, 1939, shall have distinguished themselves by exceptionally meritorious conduct in the performance of outstanding services.\"\n\n2. The following detailed regulations govern the award of the Legion of Merit, and the preparation and submission of recommendations therefore:\n\na.

The award of the Legion of Merit to personnel of the armed forces of the United States and of the Government of the Philippines shall be made as the Legion of Merit without reference to any degree, to such personnel who, since September 8, 1939, shall have distinguished themselves by exceptionally meritorious conduct in the performance of outstanding services.\n\n2. For this purpose, the medal and ribbon for the degree of Legionnaire as prescribed for award to foreign personnel will be used.\n\nb. Personnel of the armed forces of friendly foreign nations:\n\n1. The award of the Legion of Merit to personnel of friendly foreign nations shall be made in the appropriate one of four degrees as follows:\n\na. Chief Commander.\n\nb. Commander.\n\nc. Officer.\n\nd. Legionnaire.\n\n2. This award will be made to personnel of the armed forces of friendly foreign nations only with the approval of the President of the United States in each case.\n\n3. No award of the same or of a lower degree will be made to an individual who has previously been awarded the Legion of Merit. A higher degree may be awarded if subsequent services warrant.\n\n10. DISTINGUISHED FLYING CROSS\n\n1. Section 12 of the act of 2 July 1926, promulgated by Executive Order No. 4576 of 28 January 1927, amended by Executive Order No. 7786 of 8 January 1938, provides:\n\na. A Distinguished Flying Cross is awarded to any person who, while serving in any capacity with the Air Corps of the Army of the United States, including the National Guard and Organized Reserves, or with the United States Navy or the Coast Guard of the United States subsequent to 6 April 1917, has distinguished himself by heroism or extraordinary achievement while participating in an aerial flight.\n\nb. No person is eligible for the award of the Distinguished Flying Cross for an act performed prior to 11 November 1918, except:\n\n1. Officers or enlisted men who have heretofore been recommended for but have not received the Medal of Honor, the Distinguished Service Medal, or Navy Cross.\n\n2. Officers or enlisted men who displayed heroism while serving as instructors or students at flying schools.\n\nc. Subject to other special conditions prescribed in the law, the following classes of persons are eligible for the award of the Distinguished Flying Cross :\n\n1. All members of the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, and the Coast Guard while participating in an aerial flight as part of the duties incident to such membership.\n\n2. All members of the National Guard not in Federal Service, the Organized Reserves, the Officers' Reserve Corps, the Enlisted Reserve Corps, the Naval Reserves, and the Marine Corps Reserves, not on active duty, while participating in an aerial flight as part of the duties incident to such membership.\n\n3. Members of the military, naval, or air forces of foreign governments while serving with the military or naval forces of the United States, while participating in an aerial flight.\n\nd. Civilians are not eligible for the award of the Distinguished Flying Cross. (Executive Order No. 4601 of March 1, 1927.)\n\nNOTE: To justify this award for heroism, an act in the face of great danger, well above normal expectation, such as to distinguish the individual above those of comparable rank or rating performing similar services, is required; for achievement, the results accomplished must be so exceptional as to render the individual conspicuous among those of comparable rank or rating performing similar services. The recommendation should contain a specific statement setting forth the particular flight on which the recommendation is based.\n\n11. NAVY AND MARINE CORPS MEDAL\n\n1. The act of 7 August 1942 (sec. 5), provides: \"That the President be, and he hereby is, further authorized to present, but not in the name of Congress, a medal to be known as the Navy and Marine Corps Medal, of appropriate design with accompanying ribbon, together with rosette or other device to be worn in lieu thereof to any person who, while serving in any capacity with the United States Navy or Marine Corps, including the Naval Reserve or Marine Corps Reserve, shall have, since December 6, 1941, distinguished himself or herself by heroism not involving actual conflict with an enemy, or to any person to whom the Secretary of the Navy has heretofore awarded a letter of commendation for heroism, regardless of the date of such act of heroism, who makes application for such medal. No additional pay shall be payable under section 6 for service rendered prior to the date of the enactment of this section by virtue of the award of a Navy and Marine Corps Medal based upon any act of heroism performed prior to December 7, 1941.\"\n\n2. The act of 7 August 1942 (sec. 10), provides: \"That in cases of persons now in the naval service for whom the award of the Medal of Honor, Distinguished Service Medal, or Navy Cross, has been recommended in full compliance with then existing regulations, but on account of services which, though insufficient fully to justify the award of the Medal of Honor, the Distinguished Service Medal, or the Navy Cross, appear to have been such as to justify the award of the Navy and Marine Corps Medal hereinbefore provided, such cases may be considered and\n\n-- 8 --\n\n3. acted upon under the provisions of this act authorizing the award of the Navy and Marine Corps Medal, notwithstanding that said services may have been rendered more than 5 years before said cases shall have been considered as authorized by this proviso, but all consideration or any action upon any of said cases shall be based exclusively upon official records now on file in the Navy Department.\"\n\n4. Holders of Letters of Commendation awarded by the Secretary of the Navy for heroism not involving combat, to become eligible for the award of the Navy and Marine Corps Medal, shall submit applications to the Secretary of the Navy for such award.\n\nNOTE: Members of the Armed Forces should not be recommended for Treasury Department Life Saving Medals unless a military decoration is considered wholly inappropriate.\n\nNormally members of the naval service are awarded the Navy and Marine Corps Medal for outstanding heroic acts in saving or attempting to rescue any person from drowning. For a lesser degree of heroism a Secretary of the Navy Letter of Commendation with Ribbon and Medal Pendant is considered the appropriate award.\n\n12. BRONZE STAR MEDAL\n\n1. Executive Order No. 9419 of 4 February 1944, provides: \"There is hereby established the Bronze Star Medal, with accompanying ribbons and appurtenances, for award to any person who, while serving in any capacity in or with the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, or Coast Guard of the United States on or after 7 December 1941, distinguishes or has distinguished himself by heroic or meritorious achievement or service, not involving participation in aerial flight, in connection with military or naval operations against an enemy of the United States.\"\n\n2. The required achievement or service for award of the Bronze Star Medal is less than that required for award of the Silver Star Medal or the Legion of Merit but must nevertheless be accomplished or performed in a manner above that normally to be expected and sufficient to distinguish him among those performing comparable duties. The Bronze Star Medal may be awarded to recognize minor acts of heroism in actual combat or single acts of merit, or meritorious service either in sustained operational activities against an enemy or in direct support of such operations.\n\n13. AIR MEDAL\n\n1. Executive Order No. 9158 of 11 May 1942, amended by Executive Order No. 9242-A of 11 September 1942, provides: \"By virtue of authority vested in me as President of the United States and as Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States, it is hereby ordered that an Air Medal, with accompanying ribbons, be established for award to any person who, while serving in any capacity in or with the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, or Coast Guard of the United States subsequent to 8 September 1939, distinguishes, or has distinguished, himself by meritorious achievement while participating in an aerial flight.\n\n2. \"The Air Medal and appurtenances thereto shall be of appropriate design approved by the Secretary of War, the Secretary of the Navy, and the Secretary of the Treasury, and, under such regulations as said Secretaries may prescribe, may be awarded by the Secretary of War, the Secretary of the Navy, or the Secretary of the Treasury, or by such commanding officers of the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, or Coast Guard as the said Secretaries may respectively designate. Awards to personnel of the Coast Guard when serving under his jurisdiction shall be made by or under the direction of the Secretary of the Navy.\"\n\n3. Attention is invited to the fact that the Air Medal may be awarded for meritorious acts or series of acts while participating in an aerial flight. To justify this award, however, the achievements must have been accomplished with distinction.\n\n4. The Air Medal is available for award to civilians serving with the Navy.\n\n14. NAVY COMMENDATION RIBBON\n\na. The Secretary of the Navy on 11 January 1944 (AlNav-11-44) authorized the Commendation Ribbon and on 22 March 1950 established the Metal Pendant for the Commendation Ribbon. The Commendation Ribbon with Metal Pendant may be worn by authorized personnel in the same manner as prescribed for other decorations or service ribbons. All personnel of the Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard who have received an individual letter of commendation signed by the Secretary of the Navy, Commander in Chief, United States Fleet, Commander in Chief, Pacific Fleet or Commander in Chief, Atlantic Fleet for an act of heroism or service performed between 6 December 1941 and 11 January 1944, are automatically authorized to wear the Commendation Ribbon with Metal Pendant.\n\nb. All personnel of the above services who subsequently received such a commendation, signed by the Secretary of the Navy or designated authorities, are authorized to wear the Commendation Ribbon with Metal Pendant provided such letter of commendation contains in the text such authorization, signifying the desire of the issuing officer to accord this privilege.\n\nc. Only one Metal Pendant may be issued to any one person. A second and each succeeding award shall be represented by the wearing of a three-sixteenths-inch bronze star on ribbon bar and on the suspension ribbon of the pendant.\n\n15. PURPLE HEART\n\n1. Executive Order No. 9277 of 3 December 1942, superseded by Executive Order No. 10409 of 12 November 1952 provides as follows:\n\nBy virtue of the authority vested in me as President of the United States and as Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces of the United States, it is hereby ordered as follows:\n\n1. The Secretary of the Navy shall award the Purple Heart, In the name of the President of the United States, to any person who while serving in any capacity with the Navy, Marine Corps, or Coast Guard of the United States has been, or may hereafter be, wounded (a) in any action against an enemy of the United States, (b) in any action with an opposing armed force of a foreign\n\n-- 9 --\n\ncountry in which the Armed Forces of the United States are engaged, or (c) as the result of an act of any such enemy or opposing armed force.\n\n2. The Secretary of the Navy shall award the Purple Heart posthumously, in the name of the President of the United States, to any person who while serving in any capacity with the Navy, Marine Corps, or Coast Guard of the United States after April 5, 1917, has been or may hereafter be, killed, or who has died or may hereafter die subsequent to being wounded, (a) in any action against an enemy of the United States, (b) in any action with an opposing armed force of a foreign country in which the Armed Forces of the United States are engaged, or (c) as the result of an act of any such enemy or opposing armed force.\n\n3. The wound for which the award is made must have required treatment by a medical officer.\n\n4. The Purple Heart shall be forwarded to the nearest of kin of any person entitled to the posthumous award, regardless of whether a previous award has been made to such person, except that if the award results from service prior to December 7, 1941, the Purple Heart shall be forwarded to such nearest of kin upon his application therefore to the Secretary of the Navy.\n\n5. Except as authorized in paragraph 4 hereof, no more than one Purple Heart shall be awarded to any one person, but for each subsequent justification for such an award a Gold Star, or other suitable device, shall be awarded to be worn with the Purple Heart as prescribed by appropriate regulations.\n\n6. If so authorized by the Secretary of the Navy, the award of the Purple Heart may be made by the Commander in Chief of a fleet, or by such other appropriate officer or officers as the Secretary of the Navy may designate.\n\n7. The Secretary of the Navy may issue such regulations as he may deem appropriate to effectuate the purposes of this order. The regulations of the Secretary of the Navy and the regulations of the Secretary of the Army and the Secretary of the Air Force with respect to the award of the Purple Heart shall, so far as practicable, be of uniform application, and shall be subject to the approval of the Secretary of Defense.\n\n8. This order shall supersede Executive Order No. 9277 of December 3, 1942, entitled \"Award of the Purple Heart to Persons Serving with the Navy, Marine Corps or Coast Guard of the United States\", but existing regulations issued pursuant to that order shall so far as they are not inconsistent with this order, remain in effect until modified or revoked by regulations issued by the Secretary of the Navy pursuant to this order.\n\n(S) HARRY S. TRUMAN.\n\nTHE WHITE HOUSE,\n\nNovember 12, 1952.\n\n2. For the purpose of considering an award of this decoration, a \"wound\" is defined as an injury to any part of the body from an outside force or agent sustained while in action in the face of the armed enemy or as a result of a hostile act of such enemy. A physical lesion is not required, provided the concussion or other form of injury received was directly due to enemy action and required treatment by a medical officer. Awards will not be made by reason of injuries due to frostbite. Not more than one award of this decoration will be made for more than one wound or injury received at the same instant or from the same missile, force, explosion, or agent.\n\n3. Record of medical treatment for wounds or injuries received in action as prescribed above must have been made a matter of official record during the period of hostilities or within 6 months thereafter.\n\n4. A Purple Heart will be issued to the next-of-kin of each person entitled to a posthumous award as nearly coincidentally as practicable with the receipt by the Department of the Navy of a report of death indicating such person was killed in action against an armed enemy or died as a direct result of an act of an enemy, notwithstanding the fact that the records indicate the presentation of a Purple Heart to the deceased person prior to death.\n\n5. Awards will be made to personnel who served in the naval service subsequent to 5 April 1917 and prior to 7 December 1941 who meet the above requirements, only on receipt of application from them or their next-of-kin.\n\n6. Applications will be forwarded to the Chief of Naval Personnel, and the Commandant of the United States Marine Corps, as appropriate, and will include full name, service number, branch of service, date and place of injury.\n\n16. SPECIALLY MERITORIOUS MEDAL - WAR WITH SPAIN\n\nThe act of 3 March 1901, authorizes the award of bronze medals to officers and men of the Navy and Marine Corps who rendered specially meritorious service, otherwise than in battle, during the War with Spain. The act further provides that any person entitled to receive recognition in more than one instance, shall, instead of a second medal, be presented with a bronze bar, appropriately inscribed, to be attached to the ribbon by which the medal is suspended. This medal is no longer issued.\n\n--10--"
