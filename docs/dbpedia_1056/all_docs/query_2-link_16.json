        "text": "Matthew Armstrong was born in Beverley in 1885, the eldest son of Thomas and Ellen Armstrong who in 1910 lived at 9 Mintfield Grove, Holme Church Lane, Beverley. Thomas was a waterman on a barge and later a keel owner. Matthew was an apprentice in the Merchant Service. He had five siblings George, William, James, Alice and Joseph, and he attended the Minster Boys School.\n\nAt the outbreak of war, Matthew was an officer on the Pacific Liner 'Ortega' which was homeward bound from Peru to Liverpool. Details of a dramatic chase by a German cruiser appeared in the Beverley Guardian in December 1917. Following this adventure, Matthew transferred to the Royal Naval Reserve. He was posted as a navigation officer stationed in the North Sea.\n\nIn May 1915 he moved to a larger vessel in the Channel and a year later received the command of a ship. The ship called the Mary B Mitchell was a 3-mast schooner. Originally she had carried slate from Wales but in 1916 was requisitioned by the Admiralty and fitted out as a 'Q' ship. ('Q' ships were decoy vessels, heavily armed with concealed weaponry designed to lure submarines into making surface attacks). Under the temporary command of Lieutenant Armstrong, the Mary B Mitchel sank an enemy submarine on 2 December 1916, for this act of bravery he was awarded the DSO. He was also awarded the 1915 Star, British War and Victory Medal.\n\nMatthew married Gertrude McCoy at St Mary's Church, Beverley in 1914. They both died in December 1965.\n\nWalter Herbert Young was born in Southborough, Kent in February 1870, one of six children to Major General Charles Metcalf Young and Elizabeth Ann (née Chapman). He married Jeanie Marguerite Grace Bolden on 9 September 1897 in Pendlebury, Lancashire and they had two children, Walter Gavin and Norah Elizabeth. Educated at Westward Ho! in Devon and Sandhurst, Berkshire, he was commissioned 2nd Lieutenant in the East Yorkshire Regiment in March 1899. A captain by the time of the Boer War, he was present in action at Hout Nek, Biddulpsberg and Wittebergen. He earned the Queen's Medal and the King's Medal and was mentioned in despatches.\n\nWalter was a Major by the outbreak of hostilities in August 1914 and was quickly sent to France with the 1st Battalion and took command after Colonel R E Bensen was killed on the Aisne. He was appointed Lieutenant-Colonel in February 1915. Having taken command of the 2nd Battalion he was present at the Battle of Loos, slightly wounded in November 1915, and remained in command of the Battalion on the Somme in July 1916. He returned to the UK in September 1916 and was awarded the DSO and twice mentioned in despatches. A brief period of active service ensued in France in early 1917 when he was hospitalized, Young remained employed in the UK until the war's end and was placed on the retired list in June.\n\nThe colonel, who for many years was editor of the regimental magazine the Snapper, died at Farnham, Surrey in April 1940 aged 70.\n\nWilliam Hathaway Davis was born in 1881, the second son of Albert John Davis and his wife Rebecca Mary Maxwell. The family lived in Brandesburton where Albert Davis was the schoolmaster. William and his elder brother James were among the five scholars who were awarded East Riding County Scholarships in July 1892. On completing his education William became a schoolmaster, teaching in Normanton prior to the First World War.\n\nHe joined the Army initially serving with the Kings Own Yorkshire Light Infantry as a Second Lieutenant. He was then transferred to the Machine Gun Corps and had attained the rank of Captain, and was awarded the Military Cross for conspicuous gallantry in action. The citation in the Supplement to the Edinburgh Gazette, 13 December 1916 states that 'He personally supervised the working of eight machine guns under heavy fire. He greatly assisted in consolidating the new line and rendering it secure under attack.' Subsequently, he was promoted to Major and was awarded the Distinguished Service Order, as published in the Supplement to the Edinburgh Gazette, 2 January 1918.\n\nMajor Davis returned to his civilian profession of schoolmaster after the war, teaching at William Ellis School in London. William Davis married Isabelle Kathleen Watkins Baker in 1915 in Gainsborough. He died in London aged 47 on 7 December 1928 and was survived by his wife.\n\nJohn Thirsk was born in Beverley on 28 October 1880. He was the son of Robert Thirsk, NER clerk, and his wife Susannah (née Armstrong), who married at Beverley Minster in June 1880. John was brought up on Beckside and Trinity Terrace, Beverley. John initially worked for the railway before the 25 October 1898 when he joined the Royal Navy and served continuously until 1922 as a Petty Officer.\n\nJohn worked as a signaller and reached the rank of Yeoman of Signals in 1907. During the war, John served on vessels involved in minelaying. He began the war on HMS Intrepid, a converted cruiser, based at Dover for Channel minelaying duties. From March 1915 to May 1916 he served in the Mediterranean on an Italian ship, Orvieto, which may have been involved in the Gallipoli campaign. He was awarded the Italian Bronze Medal for an unknown act of heroism. John then served on HMS Wahine from July 1916 to April 1917, an ex-New Zealand vessel, serving in the 1st Mine Laying Squadron in the North Sea. Again in unknown circumstances, but possibly when mines being laid went off, John was mentioned in despatches. From April 1917 he served on HMS Ariadne but this ship was torpedoed by German U-boat UC-65 off Beachy Head on the 31 July 1917. John was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal for his actions on that day. He spent the rest of the war on the converted ocean liner, HMS Princess Margaret, and converted cruiser, HMS Amphitrite, again on minelaying tasks. John was also awarded the 1914-15 Star and the War and Victory Medals.\n\nJohn left the Navy in 1922 with a pension but it is not known if he returned to Beverley. It seems that his parents separated after Robert was sent to prison for six months in 1907 for embezzlement. John's brother, Robert Reginald Thirsk, born in 1897, and later a gamekeeper at Burton Constable, served in the army in the war in the 5th Yorkshire Regiment and later the Machine Gun Corps. He was invalided out of service and received a Silver Badge.\n\nHenry Carlyle Parker, known as Carl Parker was born in Beverley on 22 January 1893.

His father died in 1899 aged 36 and the family lived in Walkergate, Beverley.\n\nCarl joined the Royal Navy in 1909 aged 16, as a boy rating in the signal section. His occupation was given as a gentleman's servant. His first ship was the training ship HMS Ganges and his last ship was HMS Concord. His war record shows he served on around 26 ships and submarines. He saw active service in the Dardanelles serving on the B9 submarine. Carl was mentioned in despatches in 1917 for services in action with a submarine. In 1919 he received the Distinguished Service Medal for services in submarines 1918.

On the 25 September 1917, he was commissioned with the Kings Own Yorkshire Light Infantry as a 2nd Lieutenant and served in Egypt. In 1919 he was awarded the Military Cross for conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty. 'When the enemy, under cover of the heavy barrage, penetrated our line, this officer immediately organized a bombing and drove them out.' Uriah was also awarded the British and Victory medals.\n\nUriah took up his father's trade and on 5 November 1920, he married Emily May Spicer at Brockley Wesleyan Chapel, Brockley, Greenwich. The couple resided in Camberwell, London in the 1930s. In 1939 Uriah was a store buyer of fancy goods and Emily was a masseur and state registered nurse.\n\nUriah died in Worthing on 17 January 1965 aged 72.\n\nWilliam Edmund Clare Wigfall was born at St John's Parsonage, Beverley on the 13 September 1895, the son of the Reverend William Elliott Wigfall, Perpetual Curate of Beverley Minster, and Clara (née Leslie). His mother became seriously ill following his birth and died when William was just nine days old.\n\nIn 1901 the Reverend Wigfall and his son lived at 4 Beaumont Villas, 18 Westwood Road. By 1911 their home was 16 St Giles Croft, and eventually, they moved to a new house in Molescroft which was named 'Renishaw'. William was a pupil at Beverley Grammar School until the age of thirteen, from 1908 he continued his education at Repton School. He went to Queens College, Oxford to read Theology in 1914.\n\nHe left Oxford after one term to become a soldier and was commissioned into the Special Reserve as a probationary 2nd Lieutenant on 8 January 1915 and joined the 3rd Battalion, East Yorkshire Regiment.

After a period of recuperation, he continued service with the 3rd Battalion, East Yorkshire Regiment, stationed at Hedon. His promotion to Lieutenant, with effect from 3 February 1916, was announced in the London Gazette. On 11 April 1916, he returned to the Western Front where he was attached to the 8th Battalion, East Yorkshire Regiment (8th Brigade in the 3rd Division) serving in the area just south of Ypres. The Division moved south to the Somme area in early July 1916. Lieutenant Wigfall was severely wounded in the thigh during an attack southeast of Guillemont on 18 August 1916. He died at the Casualty Clearing Station, Boulogne, Pas de Calais, France on 29 August 1916, just two weeks before his twenty-first birthday and is buried in the Commonwealth War Graves Commission section of Boulogne Eastern Cemetery. The inscription on his gravestone reads:\n\n'Thou gavest him a long life even forever and ever.'\n\nThe London Gazette of 20 October 1916 announced His Majesty the King had awarded the Military Cross to Lieutenant William Edmund Clare Wigfall of the East Yorkshire Regiment Special Reserve for Conspicuous Gallantry in Action on the 18 August 1916.\n\nFrank Cecil Luke was born in 1891 in Cottingham where his father John was an engineer working at Springhead Waterworks. The family lived in Dam Cottages. At the time of the 1901 Census, Frank and five siblings were living in Hull. Whilst one of his elder brothers joined the East Riding Constabulary, Frank aged 18, enlisted with the Royal Field Artillery signing on for three years and a further nine with the Reserves. The 1911 Census shows Frank in barracks at Exeter as a gunner. Once back on the Reserve list in 1913 and after a brief spell as an assistant postman in Hull, Frank became a Police Constable with the East Riding Constabulary and was stationed at Bridlington where he met his wife-to-be, Elsie Franklin.\n\nFrank was recalled to his Regiment in August 1914 and was immediately sent to France. His Distinguished Conduct Medal (DCM) was awarded less than a year later when, as Bombardier 55509 serving with 37 Battery, 3rd Battalion Royal Field Artillery and employed as Battery telephonist, he carried out difficult and dangerous work repairing telephone wires under fire in front of the trenches. The Hull Daily Mail and Driffield Times reported in August 1915 that he had been invalided home with two wounds but at the time of his wedding to Elsie in October 1915, he was back in barracks at Norwich. The Chief Constable reported to the Standing Joint Committee in June 1916 tells of Frank's Commission to the 2nd Lieutenant.\n\nFrank returned to the police in 1919 where a note in the East Riding Constabulary Appointments Book states RFA Sergeant 59909 Luke's specialist military qualification had been gun and signalling instructor and that he served in India. Frank was regularly commended by the Courts for his police work and was awarded a Merit badge by the Standing Joint Committee for perseverance, zeal and intelligence. By the time Frank's daughter Rita marries in 1943, Frank is living in Hessle with Elsie and their son Norman. Once again his name appears regularly in the Hull Daily Mail, this time in connection with Hessle Rescue and Casualty Services and Hessle First Aid Post South. Frank died in 1957, aged 65.\n\nJoshua joined the Coldstream Guards in 1909 at the age of 17. He was working as a groom at the time. Joshua was born in January 1892 in Cottingham. Whilst his parents' address is recorded on the 1911 Census as West Green, Cottingham, Private 8457 Joshua T Grantham, as a regular soldier, was in barracks at Aldershot and within two weeks of the outbreak of war on 28 July 1914, the Coldstream Guards were already on their way to France.\n\nThe Guards were involved in major battles during the summer of 1914 and suffered serious casualties. According to letters Joshua sent to his mother and a young woman, Miss D Hairsine, which were printed in the Beverley Guardian, he had been separated from his own regiment from the 3 September and had joined up with the 1st Cheshire Regiment. He told of the hard fighting and the damage to towns and villages from 'Jack Johnsons', the nickname used to describe the impact of German 15cm artillery shells. But despite all of this his letters remained positive and he even joked 'as for a bed, I shall not know how to get out of one if I ever get in one again'. He thought he might be recommended for the DCM for his part in rescuing injured soldiers behind enemy lines. Having been made Sergeant in charge of headquarters cyclists by the Cheshires, he writes 'I haven't got such a bad job and don't go near the trenches until night'. This letter was supposedly dated 18 November but we now know Joshua had died of wounds on 15 November in No 3 Field Hospital Ypres. He was aged 22 and had been on the Western Front for just 3 months.\n\nA copy of Joshua's Short Service record tells us he was buried on the grounds of Staatweldans School, Ypres although he is remembered on the Menin Gate Memorial. Joshua's name can also be found at the Garden of Remembrance in Cottingham and on the war memorial at the front of St Mary the Virgin Church, Hallgate, Cottingham.\n\nPercy Walter Griggs was a professional soldier belonging to the 1st Battalion East Yorkshire Regiment.

Their first encounter with the enemy was on 19 September 1914 at the actions on the Aisne Heights. The Battalion attacked German positions north of Fricourt on the opening of the Somme Offensive; it was here Corporal Percy Griggs was wounded on 1 July 1916.\n\nHe was decorated twice. For bravery in the field, he was awarded the Military Medal and the Citation reads:\n\n'For that he, on 25th September 1916, on an attack at Gueudecourt, under heavy machine-gun fire and bombs, held the ground with six men for 12 hours, thus enabling the remainder of his company, who had advanced a little further on his flanks, to consolidate the position.'\n\nHe was then awarded the Distinguished Conduct Medal for gallantry at Kemmel Hill, Flanders, and the Citation reads:\n\n'For that, he, on the 24th April 1918, showed conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty; during recent operations, he did consistently good work, and under heavy shell fire, he led his ration party successfully through enemy posts to his company. He did splendid service.'\n\nOver the course of the war, the 1st East Yorkshires were involved in some vicious fighting and suffered devastating losses. From an original strength of 985 men who went out in 1914 Percy Griggs was one of only seven men still serving with the Battalion at the end of the War. After the Armistice, C.Q.M.S.

The 18th Hussars took part in the Battle of Mons and the subsequent retreat and then in the battles of the Marne and the Aisne. In October the Regiment was moved north as the allies attempted to counter the German drive to the coast. On 28 October Rudolph Smith was wounded during an attack on Neuve Chapelle. The Regiment spent much of the next two and a half years or so as dismounted infantry in trench-holding duties on various parts of the front. In June 1917 the Regiment formed part of the 2nd Pioneer Battalion and worked on the construction of new trenches near Lens.\n\nWhilst digging trenches in no-man's-land near the Lievin-Lens Road on the night of 20/21 June 1917, they were subjected to a barrage of trench mortars, high explosive shells and machine-gun fire. Rudolph was killed, along with five others, by a trench mortar. They are buried in adjoining graves at Bully-Grenay Communal Cemetery Extension, Pas-de-Calais.\n\nHis mother received a letter of sympathy from his Company Commander, 2nd Lt Richard Foster Thursa, saying Rudolph's loss was felt very acutely by the troop. She received another heartfelt letter from Fred Glover ('your son's chum') to tell her Rudolph was 'a very brave lad' and expressing sympathy 'from the bottom of my heart'. Both letters were published in the Beverley Guardian.\n\nJames Mortimer, born 14 August 1871, was the eldest son of John Robert Mortimer, the Yorkshire archaeologist and corn merchant of Driffield, and his wife Matilda (née Mitchell). He was educated at Pocklington School and St Peter's School, York (1882-1886), where he rowed for St Peter's School. An enthusiastic cricketer, he was the popular Captain of Driffield Town 1st XI for many years. On the 7 June 1904, he married Elizabeth (Betty) Woodcock, daughter of John Woodcock, gentleman, and his wife Elizabeth Jane, (née Lowish) of Grove Cottage, Driffield. Mrs Betty Mortimer died aged 27 on 5 April 1905. Three years later, on the 20 May 1908, he married Betty's younger sister, Dora Woodcock. James became the owner of the family firm James Mortimer, Corn Merchants, of River Head, Driffield. This long-established Driffield company is still extant.\n\nAged 17 James joined the 2nd Volunteer Battalion, East Yorkshire Regiment as a private on the 9 January 1889 and was promoted through the ranks. As a Captain in the 2nd Volunteers East Yorkshires, he fought in the Boer War at Cape Colony, Wittebergen and the Transvaal. After being promoted to Major on the 24 January 1906 he joined the newly constituted Territorial Force on the 1 April 1908. He was held in high esteem by and enjoyed a good rapport with his soldiers - 'My Yorkshires' he called them.\n\nThe 1st/5th Battalion, Alexandra, Princess of Wales's Own Yorkshire Regiment was a Territorial Battalion in the 150th Brigade of the 50th (Northumbrian) Division. In August 1914 Major James Mortimer was second-in-command to Lt-Col Sir Mark Sykes of Sledmere. Prior to embarkation for France, James assumed command of the battalion and was promoted to Lieutenant-Colonel. The battalion arrived in Boulogne on 18 April 1915 and completed its concentration in the vicinity of Steenvoode on 24 April. That day, due to the critical situation, and with only two hours' notice, the battalion was thrust into the fierce fighting at the Battle of St Julien. Here they earned the name 'The Yorkshire Gurkhas'. For his brave action at St Julien, Lt-Col Mortimer was mentioned in despatches. At an investiture at Buckingham Palace on Saturday 27 May 1916 he was decorated Companion of the Most Distinguished Order of St Michael and St George by His Majesty King George V.\n\nThe battalion fought in the Ypres/Armentieres/Kemmel areas until August 1916. On 15 September 1916, the battalion attacked Martinpuich at the beginning of the Battle of Flers-Courcelette, the date and location of the first use of tanks in warfare. The attack was due to begin at dawn. Soon after 3:30am 'murderous fire' from the enemy raked down on the assembly trench. Just before zero hour, Lieutenant-Colonel James Mortimer was waiting with his men in Swansea Trench when he was killed by a shell. A few minutes later, in the same spot, his brother-in-law, Captain Frank Woodcock was also killed. They are buried in nearby graves in Flatiron Copse Cemetery, Mametz, Somme, France. James left a widow Dora and two young children, Betty aged 11 and Jack aged 5."
