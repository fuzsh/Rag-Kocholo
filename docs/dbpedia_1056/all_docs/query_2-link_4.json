        "text": "Medals\n\nEvery soldier who saw service was entitled to three campaign medals, as seen below.\n\nLeft to right:\n\n1914-15 Star\n\n(awarded if the soldier was in the theatre of war between 5th August 1914 and 31st December 1915)\n\nBritish War Medal (1914-1920)\n\n(awarded if the soldier entered a theatre of war, or served overseas)\n\nAllied Victory Medal (1914-1919)\n\n(awarded if the soldier had entered a theatre of war, not just served overseas).\n\n[please click on the image to see a larger version of the picture]\n\nCollectively the men referred to these as \"Pip, Squeak and Wilfred\".\n\nAdditional medals were awarded for noted action or conspicuous bravery. In all 223 medals (210 medals plus 13 Bars) were awarded to 195 men who served at some time with the 4th CMR.\n\nThe most decorated soldier who served with the 4th CMR (though many of his awards were with other units) was Major Richard William Stayner, C.B.E., DSO, MC, Mentioned in Despatches, Order of the Sacred Treasure, Czechoslovakian War Cross.\n\nWith the research still ongoing, as certainly this list is not exhaustive, it is noted here that not all medals were awarded whilst in actual service with the 4th CMR, as some were awarded for action with another regiment, before or after transfer to or from the 4th CMR. This will be specifically noted in the citation where known. All images are credited where not held by 4cmr.com\n\nNotwithstanding, where a citation has been found, this section shares those stories to acknowledge and celebrate those who had served with the 4th CMR and who had been awarded a medal at some point in their service.\n\nAwards\n\nMedalNumberBar O.B.E.1- C.B.E.2- VC2- DSO8- MC352 DCM381 MM10310 MSM6- Croix de Guerre (French or Belgian)11- Czechoslovakian War Cross1- Order of the Rising Sun1- Order of the Sacred Treasure1- Russian Order of St. Stanislas1-\n\nBoth the Order of the Rising Sun and the Order of the Sacred Treasure were Japanese medals, issued by the Emperor.\n\nThe London Gazette, the time honoured public record of awards notices, was not consistent with the inclusion of full citations, especially in busy times. However, here follows as many of the citations as could be found for the 4th CMR awards.\n\nVC - Victoria Cross\n\nThe Victoria Cross was and remains the highest honour and most prestigious of the medals.\n\nThe VC was awarded to a total of 627 recipients in WW1.\n\nCitations for this medal were for outstanding valour \"in the presence of the enemy\".\n\nThere were two recipients in 4th CMR.\n\nOf the 2 VCs awarded to men of the 4th CMR, only one was to a man for his actions actually with the 4th CMR:\n\n838301 Pte Thomas \"Tommy\" William Holmes, VC\n\nThe formal citation from the London Gazette, LG30471, of 11th January 1918, reads:\n\n\"For most conspicuous bravery and resource when the right flank of our attack was held up by heavy machine-gun and rifle fire from a 'pill-box' strong point. Heavy casualties were producing a critical situation when Pte Holmes, on his own initiative and single-handed, ran forward and threw two bombs, killing and wounding the crews of two machine guns. He then returned to his comrades, secured another bomb, and again rushed forward alone under heavy fire and threw the bomb into the entrance of the 'pill-box,' causing the nineteen occupants to surrender. By this act of valour at a very critical moment Pte Holmes undoubtedly cleared the way for the advance of our troops and saved the lives of many of his comrades.\"\n\nThe entry in the 4th CMR's War Diary reads as follows:\n\n\"Action for which Commended - For great valour and bravery during the action of October 26th 1917, near PASSCHENDAELE.\n\nWhen his Company was within 50 yards of a pill-box and was held up and forced to take cover, by two Machine Guns, mounted nearby, and by rifle-fire from the pill-box, he, on his own initiative, and single-handed ran forward and threw a bomb, killing the crew and putting the guns out of action. He then returned to his companions, secured another bomb, and again, under heavy fire, ran forward alone and threw the bomb into the entrance causing the nineteen occupants to surrender.\"\n\nThe other VC was awarded to:\n\n158524 Lt Graham Thomson Lyall, VC.\n\nFormerly a Corporal with the 4th CMR, Graham was transferred to the 102nd Battalion in late September 1917, from which time this award was made.\n\n\"For most conspicuous bravery and skilful leading during the operations north of Cambrai. On September 27th, 1918, whilst leading his platoon against Bourlon Wood, he rendered invaluable support to the leading company, which was held up by a strong point, which he captured, by a flank movement, together with thirteen prisoners, one field gun and four machine guns.\n\nLater, his platoon, now much weakened by casualties, was held up by machine guns at the southern end of Bourlon Wood. Collecting any men available, he led them towards the strong point, and springing forward alone, rushed the position single-handed and killed the officer in charge, subsequently capturing at this point forty-five prisoners and five machine guns. Having made good his final objective, with a further capture of forty-seven prisoners, he consolidated his position and thus protected the remainder of the company.\n\nOn October 1st, in the neighbourhood of Blecourt, when in command of a weak company, by skilful dispositions he captured a strongly defended position, which yielded eighty prisoners and seventeen machine guns. During two days of operations Lt Lyall captured in -all 3 officers, 182 other ranks, 26 machine guns and one field gun, exclusive of heavy casualties inflicted. He showed throughout the utmost valour and high powers of command.\"\n\nTop of Page\n\nDSO - Distinguished Service Order\n\nThe Distinguished Service Order was instituted in 1886.\n\nThe medal was awarded for action whilst under fire, for which there was a total of 8,981 recipients during WW1.\n\nThere were eight recipients in the 4th CMR.\n\nMajor Walter Wallbridge Denison, DSO\n\n\"For conspicuous gallantry. He held on to his position under an intense bombardment, and later, after retiring in order to make a stand at another post, collected a few men and went back to gather information.\"\n\nMajor Charles Herbert McLean, DSO\n\n\"For conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty near Valenciennes on 1st November, 1918. With a view to locating points for bridging the Escaut Canal, ha and one man crossed it on an improvised bridge of a plank, raft and boat. Here he was immediately engaged by a machine gun, which he at once attacked, killing one man, and holding the remainder at bay until assistance arrived, when he captured the machine gun and ten men. A post was thus established, which enabled a crossing to be effected on the entire battalion frontage without a casualty.\"\n\nLt-Col. William Reginald Patterson, DSO\n\n\"For conspicuous gallantry in action. He led the attacking force with the greatest courage and determination, and captured two of the enemy's trenches. Later, he organised bombing attacks, and consolidated the position, sending back most valuable information.\"\n\nMajor Wilfred Victor Sifton, DSO\n\nFor his part in the attack on Folies, 9th August 1918\n\n\"Owing to his initiative, and as the result of a personal reconnaissance, he was able to save his company from heavy casualties by taking his men to a new jumping-off place. During an advance of four kilometres under heavy fire he directed the attack of three companies, two company commanders having become casualties, and then organised the battalion outpost line. Throughout the entire action he sent back valuable information to his C.O., and by personal reconnaissance established communications with the flanking units. He set a splendid example to all ranks.\"\n\nTop of Page\n\nMC - Military Cross\n\nThe Military Cross was instituted in December 1914 as there were no gallantry awards below the VC or DSO for junior Army officers or Warrant officers.\n\nThere were 115,000 recipients of the MC in WW1.\n\nThere were 35 recipients in the 4th CMR.\n\n113090 Lt Archie Henry Black, MC\n\n\"For gallantry and devotion to duty during operations 5th November, 1918, near Vicq. He made a daring reconnaissance before the assault, gaining valuable information, greatly assisting the success of the operations. Later, during the assault, he personally supervised the establishing of a defensive flank under heavy rifle and machine gun fire.\"\n\nClick here for Archie Black's biography page\n\nLt Horace Andrew Blake, MC\n\n\"For conspicuous gallantry in action. He led his platoon under very heavy fire with great courage and determination. Later, he successfully led his men in a charge on two of the enemy's trenches, and effectively consolidated his position.\"\n\n109247 Capt. Leslie Bernard Bumstead, MC+Bar\n\nMC - for actions in an attack on Humbug Sap (near Loos, France), on 22nd April 1918\n\n\"For conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty. This officer planned and carried out a raid for the purpose of securing identifications. Personally leading one of the sections he killed many of the enemy, and brought back two prisoners and a machine gun. His skill and handling of the men were largely responsible for the success of the undertaking.\"\n\nBar - for actions in the attack on Foiles village, during which he was wounded, on 9th August 1918\n\n\"For gallantry and devotion to duty during action. When at the start this officer received a gunshot wound in the back, he carried on, directing the advance of his company, a distance of over 3 kilometres. Not till the objective was reached and consolidated, and the wounded cared for, did he consent to be evacuated himself. He set a splendid example.\"\n\nClick here for Leslie Bumstead's biography page\n\nCapt. Gregory Clark, MC\n\nWhilst still a Lieutenant, likely due to actions at Vimy Ridge in April 1917:\n\n\"For conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty. He assumed command of and led his Company with great ability, gained his objective, and consolidated the position. He set a fine example of courage and initiative.\"\n\nClick here for Gregory Clark's biography page\n\nCapt. William Edgar Lawrence Coleman, MC+Bar\n\nMC\n\n\"For conspicuous gallantry. He held on to his post during a very heavy bombardment till he had only seven unwounded men left, and then retired to make a stand at another point. Though wounded, he returned at once to duty.\"\n\nBar\n\n\"For conspicuous gallantry in action. He led his company with great courage and determination, capturing two of the enemy's trenches. Later, he consolidated and maintained his position.\"\n\nMajor Henry Clarke Davis, MC+Bar\n\nMC: Awarded for actions at Passchendaele on October 26th 1917. \"For conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty as regimental medical officer. He was continually on duty for four days and nights, under heavy fire, attending to the wounded, and frequently dressed cases in the open. His courage and determination were responsible for the evacuation of all the wounded before the battalion was relieved.\"\n\nBar: \"He was in charge of the evacuation of wounded from the forward area during the fighting, in front of Cambrai, commencing 28th September, 1918. He formed routes of evacuation under heavy machine-gun and shell fire. He guided parties of stretcher-bearers in front of the Regimental Aid Posts at St. Olle and Sailly, and collected many wounded men. Throughout he showed great gallantry and devotion to duty.\"\n\nClick here for Henry Davis's biography page\n\nHon. Capt. Chaplain William Henry Davis, MC\n\nAwarded for actions at Passchendaele on October 26th 1917.\n\n\"For conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty. While the fighting was still in progress he organised and led stretcher parties into the forward area under heavy shell and machine-gun fire. He searched \"No Man's Land\" throughout the day in full view of the enemy, and set a splendid example of courage and determination.\"\n\nClick here for William Davis's biography page\n\nLt Arthur Wemyss Deacon, MC\n\nAwarded for actions at Passchendaele on October 26th 1917.\n\n\"For conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty. Though his right arm was shattered early in the attack, and he was suffering severely, he successfully led an attack on two \"pill-boxes,\" and continued to direct the operations of his company until the position had been consolidated. His example of courage and fortitude contributed largely to the success of the operation.\"\n\nLt Robert Stevenson Dunlop, MC\n\n\"For conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty near Boiry on 28th August, 1918. He was twice wounded early in the attack, but led his platoon to its objective and consolidated. Knowing that twelve officers of the battalion had already been wounded he refused to be evacuated until relieved the following morning. He was of great assistance to the battalion commander.\"\n\nLt Arthur James Everett, MC+Bar\n\nMC - No citation available, but awarded during his time with the Canadian Light Horse.\n\nBar - awarded during his time with the 10th Canadian Infantry Brigade\n\n\"In front of Dury, 3rd September, he made a most daring and valuable reconnaissance of the forward area, which was under direct observation of the enemy. Notwithstanding the fact that the enemy were sniping with artillery all the movement, he pushed on over the open through extremely heavy shelling and confirmed the position of the line, and carried urgent and important orders to a battalion commander, who was cut off from communication with brigade headquarters. The example, devotion to duty, and initiative of this officer throughout the operations were most marked and worthy of great praise.\"\n\nMajor Melville Mason Hart, MC+Bar\n\nMC\n\n\"For conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty. He led his company in the most gallant manner and captured his objective. Later, he was largely responsible for repelling a strong enemy counter-attack.\"\n\nNo citation available for the Bar, though it is known this was for actions at Passchendaele on October 26th 1917.\n\nLt Milton Berkley Hastings, MC - whilst attached to the 3rd Trench Mortar Battery\n\n\"For conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty. This officer was in charge of the forward mobile section of the battery advancing with the infantry. In spite of casualties to his men and many difficulties he kept the battery on the move by his determination and disregard of danger.\n\nLt Geoffrey Heighington, MC\n\nFor actions in an attack on Humbug Sap (near Loos, France), on 22nd April 1918\n\n\"For conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty. This officer led the right section of a raiding party, which penetrated 400 yards into the enemy's defences, killing many, and capturing a machine gun. During the subsequent withdrawal he held a communication trench, enabling it to be carried out safely, and all the wounded to be evacuated. His leadership and example contributed to the success.\"\n\nCapt. Douglas Gordon Higgins, MC - although initially assigned to the 4th CMR as a Lieutenant, the following MC was awarded for actions whilst attached to the 9th Battery, 3rd Brigade Canadian Field Artillery.\n\n\"For conspicuous gallantry and good leadership between 31st August and 3rd September, 1918, during the capture of the Drocourt-Queant line, and other ground in front of Arras. He was in charge of the ammunition wagons, and brought up the ammunition along roads which were constantly shelled. On 2nd September, while leading forward the battery to a position far forward in support of the infantry, one of his teams was hit by a shell. He showed great coolness in removing the wounded and rearranging his teams, so that little delay was caused. Throughout the engagement, though the battery was constantly firing, the ammunition supply never failed.\"\n\nCapt. Robert Melrose Hood, MC, Croix de Guerre, Russian Order of St. Stanislas 2nd Class with Swords\n\nInitially assigned to the 4th CMR between 1st February 1916 and 31st December 1917 as L/Cpl and leaving it as CQMS, Robert was assigned variously to the 2nd Central Ontario Regiment Depot (2nd C.O.R.D.), the 1st C.O.R.D. He was eventually assigned to the North Russia Expeditionary (Syren) Force as Acting Captain in mid-September 1918.\n\nThe MC, and likely the Russian Order medal, was awarded for actions whilst serving with the Syren Force.\n\n\"He was in charge of the armoured train in the taking of Ourosozero, 11th April, 1919. When the train neared the station he ran ahead and shot three enemy with his revolver, one of whom was putting a shell in a field gun to fire at the train. His great gallantry and promptitude prevented this field gun damaging the train.\"\n\nCapt. Clarence Lea, MC\n\nAlthough there are no specific details in the London Gazette citation to refer to, the following detail was reported by the Toronto Star on 4th January 1917, pertaining to actions under heavy fire at the outset of the 13 day 'Battle for Mount Sorrel' on 2nd June 1916. Though the article states the action was at Courcellete, it was in fact near Sanctuary Wood, Ypres:\n\n\"Capt. Clarence Lea... has been awarded the Military Cross for getting transports through to the 4th C.M.R. Battalion when that unit was hard pressed at Courcellete on June 2nd.\"\n\nClick here for Clarence Lea's biography page\n\nLt Merrill Whedon MacDowell, MC\n\n\"For conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty. He led his platoon with great courage and skill in spite of severe losses, to within fifty yards of his objective, and maintained his position, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy in a counter-attack.\"\n\nMajor Addison Alexander \"Lex\" Mackenzie, MC\n\nCaptain at the time, for actions in the attack on Regina Trench in October 1916:\n\n\"For conspicuous gallantry in action. He carried out a daring reconnaissance of the enemy's wire in daylight. Later he led his Company with great courage and determination, greatly assisting the bombers by sniping the enemy as they brought up reinforcements.\"\n\nClick here for Addison Mackezie's biography page\n\nLt Ernest Victor McMillan, MC\n\n\"For conspicuous gallantry and endurance on 28th August, 1918, near Boisy. During the assembly for the attack he was severely wounded as well as four other officers and five non-commissioned officers, and the company became disorganised. In spite of his wounds he rallied them and led them with cheers through violent shell, rifle and machine-gun fire to their objective. In the end he was only able to crawl on his hands and knees, but remained at duty until support arrived.\"\n\nMajor. Albert Percy Menzies, MC\n\nWhilst a Lieutenant, for actions against Regina Trench, on 10th October 1916, following loss of their guide to injury:\n\n\"For conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty. Having led his company to the final objective, he took command of the whole front line objective, and consolidated under intense fire of every description. He showed great resource and initiative in keeping touch with other units, establishing strong advanced posts, and in personally patrolling his 500 yards of frontage, and it was largely owing to his personal efforts that hostile counter-attacks were repelled.\"\n\nLt Reginald Mitchell, MC\n\n\"For conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty on 26th August, 1918, near Monchy. Shortly after jumping off, an enemy trench mortar opened rapid fire on the advancing troops.

Both his flanks became exposed, and he was subjected to severe enfilade fire, but he established his men in a good position and secured his flanks. He broke up an enemy counter-attack, and at once sent out a patrol which brought in prisoners.
