At night, O’Malley, 21, a police officer, was assaulted in an alley by a man he was attempting to arrest. When the man grabbed O’Malley’s gun, a struggle for control of it ensued. Davis, 47, rental counselor, at work in a nearby office, ran to O’Malley, who was then on the ground with the assailant atop him. O’Malley asked for help. Davis grasped the assailant around the neck, forcing him to relinquish control of the gun. He then pulled the assailant off O’Malley. Arriving police subdued the assailant and arrested him. O’Malley recovered from minor injuries.\n\n61955 – 7171\n\n61955-7171"
