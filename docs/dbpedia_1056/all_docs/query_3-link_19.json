        "text": "Louisiana Tech University Assistant Police Chief Bill Davis has been named Law Enforcement Officer of the Year by the Ruston-Lincoln Chamber of Commerce. Davis’ award was presented by the Kiwanis Club of Ruston at the 104th Annual Chamber Awards Banquet on Feb 1.\n\nDavis, who has been part of the Louisiana Tech Police Department since 2008, was nominated by members of the Ruston Kiwanis Club, several of whom are University employees who have seen firsthand the impact of his leadership on campus.\n\nThe award came as a surprise to Davis, and its indication of the community’s confidence in and appreciation of his service is not lost on him.\n\n“At this point in my career, I wasn’t expecting it. I’m grateful that Kiwanis felt I deserved this recognition,” Davis said. “It’s special to me for two reasons: one, I was chosen to represent Lincoln Parish law enforcement; and two, it was the Louisiana Tech community who selected me for this. It couldn’t mean more.”\n\nBorn in New Orleans, Davis moved to Ruston in 1979 to further his education at Louisiana Tech and joined the Ruston Police Department straight out of college in 1983 where he served until 2008. During his tenure, he served as a patrol officer, field training officer, training and public information officer, narcotics investigator, patrol supervisor and shift commander, all while rising in rank from sergeant to lieutenant to captain.\n\nAs a LTPD officer, Davis’ job duties include management, administration, training supervision, hiring and evaluation oversight, and investigation supervision. In addition, he is a part of several University committees focused on campus safety and the coordination of special events.\n\nDavis is also second-in-command to Louisiana Tech Police Chief Randal Hermes, and the two have served alongside each other for many years.\n\n“I am very appreciative of the Ruston Kiwanis Club for their support and recognition of our local law enforcement officers, and Bill is very deserving of this honor,” said Hermes. “He has passed on his knowledge and expertise through supporting, training and mentoring our officers. His contribution to the Tech community is immeasurable.”\n\nWhile acknowledging the award’s significance, the humble Davis still holds the community as his—and the department’s—first and foremost priority.\n\n“The law enforcement we practice on this campus is geared toward serving our students, faculty and staff,” Davis said. “You have to have a heart for these people and this place, and I am confident that our police team here certainly does.”\n\nLouisiana Tech University Police is a fully functional police department charged with promoting a safe and secure education environment by enforcing the laws, rules, and regulations that govern the University."
