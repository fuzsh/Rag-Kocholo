Cain (US56372685), Private First Class, U.S. Army, for extraordinary heroism in connection with military operations involving conflict with an armed force in the Republic of Vietnam, while serving with Headquarters Battery, 2d Battalion, 320th Artillery, 1st Brigade, 101st Airborne Division. Private First Class Cain distinguished himself by exceptionally valorous actions on 11 July 1967 while serving as radio operator of an artillery forward observer team supporting infantry operations deep in hostile territory. Early in the morning, his unit was heavily engaged by a large enemy force dug into the ruins of a fortified village. Completely disregarding his own safety, Private Cain braved savage mortar, recoilless rifle, and machine gun fire to relay artillery adjustments sent by the forward observer. He received a serious head wound in the ravaging barrage but ignored his injury and assumed the responsibility of directing the strikes when the observer was severely hit. For more than two hours, he exposed himself to the intense enemy attack to call for artillery and keep his headquarters advised of the critical situation. As the firefight intensified, he called for supporting gunships and moved into the open time after time to direct deadly strafing runs on the fanatical attackers. He momentarily left his radio when he was overcome by his wounds but quickly returned under a hail of bullets to bring the fire closer to his positions. Despite repeated assaults on his position, he fought furiously and inspired the men around him to greater heights in repelling the overwhelming onslaught. His fearless actions in the face of grave danger contributed greatly to the defeat of the numerically superior Viet Cong force. Private First Class Cain's extraordinary heroism and devotion to duty were in keeping with the highest traditions of the military service and reflect great credit upon himself, his unit, and the United States Army.\n\nHeadquarters, US Army, Vietnam, General Orders No. 6043 (November 20, 1967)\n\n*CALIBOSO, ROBERT MALUENDA\n\nCitation:\n\nThe President of the United States takes pride in presenting the Distinguished Service Cross (Posthumously) to Robert Maluenda Caliboso (0-89430), Captain (Aviation), U.S. Army, for extraordinary heroism in connection with military operations involving conflict with an armed hostile force in the Republic of Vietnam, while serving with Company B, 1st Aviation Battalion, 1st Infantry Division. Captain Caliboso distinguished himself conspicuously by gallantry against an armed hostile enemy force at the cost of his life on 5 March 1966 in the Republic of Vietnam. Captain Caliboso was serving as Aircraft Commander of a UH-1D helicopter when he learned that the perimeter of the 2d Battalion, 28th Infantry was surrounded and under heavy attack by a regimental-sized Viet Cong force in the vicinity of Lai Khe, Binh Duong Province. The insurgents had pressed so close to the perimeter of the American units that mortar and supporting artillery fire were relatively ineffective and the defenders had begun to run critically short of small arms ammunition. Though they realized that a delivery of ammunition into the middle of a raging jungle battle was extremely hazardous and call for exposure to withering Viet Cong machine gun fire, Captain Caliboso and his crew voluntarily undertook to deliver fifteen hundred pounds of explosive cargo into the battle area. On the approach to the landing zone the helicopter and crew were hit time and time again by heavy machine gun and small arms fire. Knowing the ammunition was desperately needed to save the besieged Infantrymen, Captain Caliboso and his crew ignored their personal safety and continued through the heavy fire to the landing zone. The crew members began to unload the ammunition even though they were being repeatedly wounded by the ever increasing Viet Cong fire. Though the entire crew had been seriously wounded in their efforts, all the ammunition was successfully unloaded and Captain Caliboso managed to fly the helicopter out of its untenable position. Moments later the helicopter was shot down by a deadly cross fire of .50 caliber machine guns, killing all aboard. The heroic actions of Captain Caliboso and his crew supplied the needed ammunition to turn the tide of battle and save numerous American lives. Because of this ammunition re-supply the heavily outnumbered Infantry units completely routed the insurgent force, killing over 200 Viet Cong and capturing supplies and equipment which included four .50 caliber machine guns. Captain Caliboso's conspicuous gallantry, at the cost of his life, was the mainstay of the successful camp defense. His actions were an inspiration to the American defenders, displaying magnificent leadership and conspicuous bravery. Although wounded, he never relented from his determined effort to re-supply the heavily beleaguered Infantry units. Captain Caliboso's courage and determination, in the face of overwhelming firepower, were in keeping with the highest traditions of the military service and reflect great credit upon himself, his unit, and the United States Army.\n\nDepartment of the Army, General Orders No. 18 (April 18, 1967)\n\nHome Town: Honolulu, Hawaii\n\nCAMACHO, ISAAC (POW)\n\nCitation:\n\nThe President of the United States takes pleasure in presenting the Distinguished Service Cross to Isaac Camacho, Sergeant First Class, U.S. Army, for extraordinary heroism in connection with military operations involving conflict with an armed hostile force in the Republic of Vietnam, while serving with Detachment A-21, 5th Special Forces Group (Airborne), 1st Special Forces. Sergeant First Class Camacho distinguished himself by gallantry in action during the early morning on 2 November 1963, when an estimated reinforced battalion of Viet Cong attacked a Special Forces camp at Hiep Hoa, Republic of Vietnam. Taking the camp by complete surprise, the insurgents began their attack with withering automatic weapons and small arms fire followed within a few seconds by an intense mortar barrage. The heavy volume of high and flat trajectory fire pinned down the entire Vietnamese strike force within the compound. At the beginning of the attack, Sergeant First Class Camacho ran from his sleeping area to a mortar position. Having. successfully maneuvered through a hail of bullets and mortar fragments, Sergeant First Class Camacho calmly manned the mortar and began to concentrate his fire on the Viet Cong who were attempting to breach the wall of the compound. Disregarding his own personal safety and realizing that he was the only man not pinned down by the Viet Cong, Sergeant First Class Camacho valiantly engaged the enemy until he was ordered by his commanding officer to withdraw from the camp. Reluctantly, he gave up his position and moved into the darkness. In the confusion of battle, Sergeant First Class Camacho and his commanding officer became separated. Sergeant First Class Camacho was captured by the Viet Cong only when he no longer had any means to resist. Sergeant First class Camacho's conspicuous gallantry in action was in keeping with the highest traditions of the United States Army and reflects great credit upon himself and the military service.\n\nHeadquarters, Department of the Army, General Orders 25 (8 June 2001)\n\nHome Town: Fabens, Texas\n\nCAMPBELL, DARRELL W.\n\nCitation:\n\nThe President of the United States takes pleasure in presenting the Distinguished Service Cross to Darrell W.

Specialist Four Campbell distinguished himself by exceptionally valorous actions on 13 February 1968 as a medic at a forward operations base in Quang Tri Province. The base came under intense fire from a North Vietnamese Army unit employing small arms, grenades, rockets and satchel charges. In the initial minutes of the attack several men were wounded. Hearing their cries for help, Specialist Campbell rushed from his foxhole to administer medical aid. As he was moving an injured soldier to a protected area, he was wounded in both legs and the face by an exploding charge. Partially blinded and in intense pain from his wounds, Specialist Campbell nevertheless continued to treat his comrades. He went from position to position through the fierce barrage, dragging the more seriously injured to cover in the center of the camp's perimeter. Only after all other casualties had been evacuated, did he allow himself to be removed from the battle area. Specialist Four Campbell's extraordinary heroism and devotion to duty were in keeping with the highest traditions of the military service and reflect great credit upon himself, his unit, and the United States Army.\n\nHeadquarters, US Army, Vietnam, General Orders No. 4321 (September 11, 1968)\n\n*CAMPBELL, KEITH ALLEN\n\nCitation:\n\nThe President of the United States takes pride in presenting the Distinguished Service Cross (Posthumously) to Keith Allen Campbell (RA13794184), Specialist Fourth Class, U.S. Army, for extraordinary heroism in connection with military operations involving conflict with an armed hostile force in the Republic of Vietnam while serving with Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 1st Battalion (Airborne), 503d Infantry, 173d Airborne Brigade. Specialist Four Campbell distinguished himself by exceptionally valorous actions on 8 February 1967 while serving with elements of the 503d Infantry assaulting a Viet Cong bunker complex. During the initial engagement, the lead company had suffered numerous casualties, including the medical personnel. Specialist Campbell volunteered to assist in treating the wounded, and dauntlessly moved up to the front line. Exposing himself to the intense hostile fire, he began to administer aid to the wounded soldiers. Discovering that one casualty lay fifty meters in front of the friendly lines and next to an insurgent bunker, Specialist Campbell called for covering fire as he maneuvered forward. Disregarding the extreme dangers, he fearlessly ran through a hail of bullets and exploding grenades, but was forced to take cover behind a low mound of dirt. From this position, he killed a Viet Cong sniper who was firing on him from a tree. Undeterred from his mission, Specialist Campbell then crawled the last twenty meters to the stricken man. Dragging the soldier to the cover of a nearby tree, he started to administer first aid. As he fearlessly protected the man from further hostile fire, Specialist Campbell was mortally wounded. His unimpeachable valor and selfless sacrifice against insurmountable odds succeeded in saving a fellow soldier's life. Specialist Four Campbell's extraordinary heroism and devotion to duty, at the cost of his life, were in keeping with the highest traditions of the military service and reflect great credit upon himself, his unit, and the United States Army.\n\nHeadquarters, US Army, Vietnam, General Orders No. 1178 (March 17, 1967)\n\nBorn: March 3, 1946 at Long Beach, California\n\nHome Town: Arlington, Virginia\n\n*CANAVAN, MARTIN JOSEPH, JR.\n\nCitation:\n\nThe President of the United States takes pride in presenting the Distinguished Service Cross (Posthumously) to Martin Joseph Canavan, Jr. (US56707321), Staff Sergeant, U.S. Army, for extraordinary heroism in connection with military operations involving conflict with an armed hostile force in the Republic of Vietnam, while serving with Company A, 2d Battalion, 5th Cavalry, 1st Brigade, 1st Cavalry Division (Airmobile). Staff Sergeant Canavan distinguished himself by exceptionally valorous actions on 29 March 1969 while leading a platoon involved in a mission in enemy dominated terrain in Tay Ninh Province. Having just made a combat assault into the area, Sergeant Canavan's company set up a defensive perimeter prior to constructing a landing zone. As the first supply helicopters approached the site, the enemy opened fire on the company with small arms, automatic weapons and rockets. After the initial barrage, Sergeant Canavan was placed in charge of the third platoon with instructions to assist the first and second platoons, who had received the brunt of the attack. He effectively emplaced his men to lay down protective fire under which the two threatened platoons could withdraw to safety. He then personally led a squad to remove the injured men in the killing zone. When increased bombardment forced his squad to pull back, he called in air strikes and artillery to silence the enemy. After organizing and leading an assault on the wood line, where the foe lay entrenched, he seized the opportunity offered by the advance to evacuate the wounded and dead who were stranded after the first attack. When the bodies had been removed and the wounded given emergency treatment, Sergeant Canavan pulled his troops back to avoid further casualties. In a last minute effort to reach another wounded comrade pinned down in the open by enemy fire Sergeant Canavan was struck down by intense enemy fire. Staff Sergeant Canavan's extraordinary heroism and devotion to duty, at the cost of his life, were in keeping with the highest traditions of the military service and reflect great credit upon himself, his unit, and the United States Army.\n\nHeadquarters, US Army, Vietnam, General Orders No. 2028 (June 9, 1969)\n\nHome Town: Barstow, California\n\nCARISTO, FREDERIC J. G.\n\nCitation:\n\nThe President of the United States takes pleasure in presenting the Distinguished Service Cross to Frederic J. G. Caristo, First Lieutenant (Infantry), U.S. Army, for extraordinary heroism in connection with military operations involving conflict with an armed hostile force in the Republic of Vietnam. Major Caristo distinguished himself by extraordinary heroism on 24 December 1966, while a member of the Studies and Observations Group, Headquarters, Military Assistance Command, Vietnam. Major Caristo's mission was to accompany an extremely dangerous and sensitive United States prisoner recovery mission in the Ba Tu area of Cambodia, distinguish the Cambodians from the North Vietnamese and act as an interpreter/translator during any ground negotiations. He was also charged with the security and maximum exploitation of the North Vietnamese Hoi Chanh (military defector) who would accompany the operation. The Hoi Chanh had provided the initial intelligence which prompted the operation, and had revealed two United States prisoners were being held in a isolated hamlet near Ba Tu. The objective area was secured by a reinforced North Vietnamese battalion, surrounded by several minefields, and contained numerous armed/explosive manufacturing shops and caches. The prisoners were being held in a hut bordered on three sides by minefields. Initial planning called for a \"nap of the earth\" heliborne assault inside the minefield next to the prisoner hut. At 1200 hours, 24 December 1966, the helicopters made their final approach. With Major Caristo aboard, the lead helicopter began inserting on the wrong side of the minefield. Major Caristo immediately exited the lead helicopter, and simultaneously the supporting gunships began their suppression fires into the minefield and surrounding area. The lead helicopter pilot, realizing his navigational error, left the landing zone and attempted to insert the assault troops on the opposite side of the minefield. After their initial surprise, the North Vietnamese defenders rallied and began to place intensive protective fires throughout the area. Major Caristo, realizing the danger to the prisoners, the possibility of their execution, and the fact that he was the only assault troop on the ground, began to move toward the prisoners' hut. With complete disregard for his own safety and realizing the extreme danger, Major Caristo ran fifty meters through the minefield and fusillade of intense friendly and enemy fire. He broke through the back wall of the designated hut, captured three occupants, and discovered the prisoners had been moved the previous night. The North Vietnamese unit was offering heavy resistance, and both sides, were suffering heavy casualties. The assaulting United States unit had become trapped with a second minefield between them and the North Vietnamese defenders. Major Caristo saw the gravity of the United States troops' precarious situation, took one of his prisoners, and directed the captive to lead him and the assault elements through the minefield. Again disregarding his own safety by exposing himself to intense small arms and recoilless weapons fire, Major Caristo began leading the way through the minefield. When the prisoner was killed by small arms fire, Major Caristo demonstrated true leadership and great bravery and continued to lead the way through the minefield. Under an increasing volume of fire, and after knocked to the ground from the blast of a bangalore torpedo, he successfully led the assault elements through the minefield. This valorous action undoubtedly saved many American lives and allowed the assault to continue. Major Caristo returned to the hamlet to locate the prisoners and encountered a North Vietnamese soldier firing a 57 mm recoilless rifle into the rear of the assault elements. Major Caristo fired and wounded the gunner. To obtain further information about the minefields in the area, he captured the wounded gunner. Instead, the prisoner led him to an underground arms/explosive shop and attempted to get Major Caristo to enter. Major Caristo wisely had the prisoner enter first. The entrance was booby trapped and the prisoner was killed. The booby trap also wounded a woman and baby who were occupying the complex. Major Caristo, recognizing the possibility of a second booby trap, crawled into the bunker and pulled the woman and child to safety and medical aid. As the assault unit continued their sweep activities, they discovered a number of bunker complexes. Those United States troops attempting to search the bunkers encountered booby traps and small arms fire which caused a number of casualties. Reluctant to suffer further casualties, the United States troops began throwing hand grenades into the bunker prior to entering. Major Caristo, realizing their were many women and children in the bunkers, voluntarily entered several of them and saved many civilian lives by assuring the bunker occupants of their safety. Major Caristo's command of the Vietnamese and Cambodian languages and their dialects also allowed him to discover forty-six North Vietnamese who were attempting to \"blend-in\" with the Cambodian civilians. Major Caristo additionally provided translations of numerous documents which led to the uncovering of two large arms caches. Through his heroic and unselfish efforts, Major Caristo saved numerous United States military and noncombatant lives. Although the prisoners were not recovered, Major Caristo's valorous actions were the single outstanding factor of the operation and reflect great credit upon him and the United States Army.\n\nDepartment of the Army, General Orders No. 5 (March 24, 1977)\n\n*CARLSON, GARY WILLIAM\n\nCitation:\n\nThe President of the United States takes pride in presenting the Distinguished Service Cross (Posthumously) to Gary William Carlson (019-34-7170), Captain (Armor), U.S. Army, for extraordinary heroism in connection with military operations involving conflict with an armed hostile force in the Republic of Vietnam, while serving with Troop C, 3d Squadron, 4th Cavalry, 25th Infantry Division. Captain Carlson distinguished himself by exceptionally valorous actions on 19 June 1969 as troop commander during a reconnaissance-in-force operation. When the troop came under fire from a well-concealed enemy force, he immediately led his men in an assault on the hostile fortifications. Realizing that the crossfire was impeding the movement of his troop, he single-handedly assaulted and destroyed the most strategic hostile position. He then directed his fire against another enemy position, silencing it with hand grenades and rifle fire. Spotting a wounded comrade lying exposed to the enemy barrage, Captain Carlson braved the fusillade to move the man to safety. He then returned to the center of conflict to evacuate another casualty. As he returned to his vehicle, he was knocked to the ground by a rocket-propelled grenade which rendered his command vehicle inoperative. Braving a hail of fire to reach another vehicle, he resumed control of his troop. It was while he was directing this assault on the enemy that he was mortally wounded by enemy fire. Captain Carlson's extraordinary heroism and devotion to duty, at the cost of his life, were in keeping with the highest traditions of the military service and reflect great credit upon himself, his unit, and the United States Army.\n\nHeadquarters, US Army, Vietnam, General Orders No. 3274 (August 23, 1969)\n\nHome Town: West Bridgewater, Massachusetts\n\nCARNES, EDWARD L.\n\nCitation:\n\nThe President of the United States takes pleasure in presenting the Distinguished Service Cross to Edward L. Carnes (0-5426786), First Lieutenant (Field Artillery), U.S. Army, for extraordinary heroism in connection with military operations involving conflict with an armed hostile force in the Republic of Vietnam, while serving with Company A, 2d Battalion, 39th Infantry, 9th Infantry Division. First Lieutenant Carnes distinguished himself by exceptionally valorous actions on 6 January 1969 while serving as a forward observer for his company during a reconnaissance-in-force mission near Long Hiep in Kien Phong Province. As his unit crossed an open field adjacent to a wood line, a large enemy force opened fire with small arms, automatic weapons and hand grenades, killing the company commander, with their initial volley. Immediately taking command, Lieutenant Carnes braved the fusillade to lead his men in repelling the first wave of the aggressors. After organizing a defensive perimeter, he made repeated attempts to reach his commander, who lay under a hail of bullets. Finally determining that the man was dead, he withdrew back to the perimeter. Intense hostile fire was now coming from three sides, preventing his men from maneuvering. Taking a dangerously exposed position, Lieutenant Carnes directed tactical air and gun ship strikes against the foe. Seeing that one machine gun was situated to sweep his entire company, he maneuvered alone over thirty meters of bullet- swept terrain and slew the enemy gunner with a burst from his rifle. He killed another Viet Cong before returning to his command group and then began leading his force into position as part of a brigade encirclement. Throughout the night, Lieutenant Carnes continued to command his company and expertly adjusted artillery fire within meters of his own location. First Lieutenant Carnes' extraordinary heroism and devotion to duty were in keeping with the highest traditions of the military service and reflect great credit upon himself, his unit, and the United States Army.\n\nHeadquarters, US Army, Vietnam, General Orders No. 2022 (June 9, 1969)\n\nCARPENTER, MICHAEL F.\n\nCitation:\n\nThe President of the United States takes pleasure in presenting the Distinguished Service Cross to Michael F. Carpenter (RA19607653), Staff Sergeant, U.S. Army, for extraordinary heroism in connection with military operations involving conflict with an armed hostile force in the Republic of Vietnam. On 20 July 1965, Sergeant Carpenter was serving as Communications Sergeant of Detachment A-341, 5th United States Army Special Forces Group (Airborne), at Camp Bu Dop, Vietnam. At approximately 0105 hours, the camp was attacked by a hard-core Viet Cong force estimated to be composed of two infantry battalions. During the initial barrage of insurgent mortar, recoilless weapons, and small arms fire, Sergeant Carpenter positioned himself in the Special Forces mess hall and immediately radioed higher headquarters to request flare aircraft and fighter support to aid the already hard-pressed friendly defensive force. As the hostile barrage increased in intensity, the mess hall and radio equipment were destroyed. With the aid of a wounded comrade, to whom he had previously administered first aid, Sergeant Carpenter left the remains of the mess hall and attempted to enter the camp's communications bunker to continue the vital task of maintaining radio contact with higher headquarters. Despite his valiant efforts, Sergeant Carpenter was denied entrance when incoming mortar rounds ignited highly flammable supplies which had been stored in the bunker's immediate vicinity. With his communications mission temporarily thwarted, Sergeant Carpenter and his companion actively entered the fierce fire-fight, which had raged about them, by the timely destruction of a five-man Viet Cong force which had reached the camp's defenses and were about to commence fighting one of the defensive mortars upon the friendly forces. After insuring that his wounded comrade was attend to, Sergeant Carpenter moved to a machine gun and continued to direct deadly fire upon the attacking insurgent horde. Upon learning that a Special Forces Officer had been wounded, Sergeant Carpenter, with complete disregard for his own personal safety, rushed through the intense hail of hostile fire and successfully carried the wounded officer to the Camp Commander's bunker. Despite a painful wound sustained in his heroic rescue of a fallen comrade, Sergeant Carpenter refused aid and rushed to the camp's west wall, engaging another Viet Cong force with suppressive fire while re-supplying the friendly defenders with much needed grenades and small arms ammunition. As the battle raged on, he twice fought his way to the communications bunker, killing several Viet Cong while en route to obtain weapons and re-establish radio communications with higher headquarters. After repairing the communications equipment, Sergeant Carpenter regained radio contact and directed devastating air strikes upon the hostile forces. Although painfully wounded and nearing physical exhaustion, Sergeant Carpenter refused immediate air evacuation, electing to remain and assist in the establishment of firm communications channel and reorganization of the defensive structure before he was finally evacuated. Sergeant Carpenter's extraordinary heroism was in keeping with the highest traditions of the United States Army and reflect great credit upon himself and the military service.\n\nHeadquarters, US Army, Pacific, General Orders No. 52 (March 7, 1966)\n\nHome Town: Columbus, Georgia\n\nCARPENTER, WILLIAM STANLEY, JR.\n\nCitation:\n\nThe President of the United States takes pleasure in presenting the Distinguished Service Cross to William Stanley Carpenter, Jr. (0-90703), Captain (Infantry), U.S. Army, for extraordinary heroism in connection with military operations involving conflict with an armed hostile force in the Republic of Vietnam, while serving with Company C, 2d Battalion (Airborne), 502d Infantry Regiment, 1st Brigade, 101st Airborne Division. Captain Carpenter distinguished himself by exceptionally valorous actions during the period 9 June 1966 to 11 June 1966 while serving as Commanding Officer of an infantry company engaged in a blocking mission near Tou Morong Outpost. As Captain Carpenter's company advanced, the lead platoon suddenly received intense fire from an estimated two companies of Viet Cong. Captain Carpenter immediately deployed the company to continue its forward progress, but it soon became pinned down by extremely heavy hostile fire from three directions. After Captain Carpenter organized a hasty defense, it became apparent that the insurgent force was at least of battalion size. The insurgents launched a determined frontal attack and were successful in overrunning one platoon. Realizing the severe consequences if the enemy forces were able to penetrate the entire company area, Captain Carpenter ordered supporting jet aircraft to drop napalm directly on the company's position. The napalm bombs hit the top of the trees in the center of the company position and detonated 25 feet above ground. As a result, the fiery napalm carried directly into the charging insurgents and passed over most of the friendly troops. The skillfully directed air strike completely subdued the Viet Cong attempt to overrun the company. As the insurgents withdrew, Captain Carpenter repeatedly exposed himself to the hostile fire to reorganize his command and direct supporting artillery fire. Throughout the remainder of the three-day battle and in the face of almost overwhelming odds, Captain Carpenter continued to direct and inspire the company to repulse three additional determined assaults by the enemy battalion. Through Captain Carpenter's heroic actions and courageous tenacity, his company was spared numerous casualties and was able to withstand the repeated attacks of the Viet Cong battalion until reinforcements arrived. Captain Carpenter's extraordinary heroism and devotion to duty were in keeping with the highest traditions of the military service and reflect great credit upon himself, his unit, and the United States Army.\n\nHeadquarters, US Army, Vietnam, General Orders No. 4125 (August 14, 1967)\n\nBorn: at Woodbury, Pennsylvania\n\nHome Town: Springfield, Pennsylvania\n\nCARR, DONALD F.\n\nCitation:\n\nThe President of the United States takes pleasure in presenting the Distinguished Service Cross to Donald F. Carr, Staff Sergeant, U.S. Army, for extraordinary heroism in connection with military operations involving conflict with an armed hostile force in the Republic of Vietnam, while serving with Company C, 2d Battalion, 18th Infantry, 1st Infantry Division. Staff Sergeant Carr distinguished himself by exceptionally valorous actions on 24 February 1969 while leading an eight-man ambush patrol near the hamlet of Ong Nhieu. After he and his men had established an ambush position, they observed several enemy sampans approaching. By detonating their claymore mines, they killed one communist soldier and captured weapons and documents from his boat. A search of the area revealed other sampans, camouflaged near the river bank. Sergeant Carr set up another ambush position across the stream from the boats, but when no one returned by morning, he decided to search the river craft. Swimming back and forth across the stream, he gathered the boats while his men secured the captured enemy weapons, munitions and documents. Suddenly enemy rounds and rocket-propelled grenades began to rain around Sergeant Carr. As his men assumed defensive positions and returned fire, Sergeant Carr took cover behind the single remaining sampan on the enemy's side of the river. He then unleashed a barrage on the hostile force. When his ammunition supply was exhausted, he climbed aboard the captured boat and employed weapons from the communist cache. He quickly silenced one enemy position with a rocket grenade, and once his craft had drifted to shore down-stream, he disembarked to engage the hostile emplacements with an AK-47 rifle. When his accurate fusillade cut down four enemy soldiers, the remainder of the enemy fled.

Captain Carroll distinguished himself by exceptionally valorous actions on 12 May 1968 as an infantry company commander during a search and destroy mission in the vicinity of Lai An, Quang Tri Province. His reconnaissance platoon came under heavy attack by a numerically superior North Vietnamese Army element. Captain Carroll immediately organized a relief force and led it across a thousand meters of open terrain completely exposed to enemy gunners and artillery. Reaching his beleaguered troops, he found that both the platoon leader and platoon sergeant were casualties and quickly re- established order and confidence. With complete disregard for his safety, Captain Carroll maneuvered from man to man through a barrage of North Vietnamese artillery and mortars to inform each soldier of his rapidly devised withdrawal plan. The enemy launched a ground attack before his troops could break contact, but it was successfully repulsed. Captain Carroll then signaled to start the withdrawal and exposed himself to a renewed hostile bombardment to direct his men's movement. As he moved among them he was mortally wounded by an exploding enemy mortar round.

Staff Sergeant Carter distinguished himself by exceptionally valorous actions on the night of 27 - 28 September, 1966. Throughout the night of 27 through 28 September 1966, Staff Sergeant Carter and members of his squad conducted an ambush in the vicinity of Troung Loung, Republic of Vietnam. There was evidence of a large enemy force in the area, since Company B had been overrun on the night of 25 September 1966, suffering numerous dead and wounded. While returning before dawn to friendly positions, the point man hit a booby-trapped grenade. Disregarding his own personal safety and possibly sacrificing his life, Staff Sergeant Carter pushed the point man away and dove for the grenade, absorbing the entire blast. In so doing he saved his men from possible death and wounds. Staff Sergeant Carter lost his hands, arms, and eye sight in this act. Throughout the entire time the medics and executive officer were administering first aid to save his life, all he kept asking was, \"Are my men ok?\" This gallant deed was truly above and beyond the call of duty and was in keeping with the finest traditions of the military service and reflects great credit upon himself, the 327th Parachute Infantry Regiment, the United States Army and the United States of America.\n\nHeadquarters, Department of the Army, General Orders 9, 18 November 2005\n\nCARTER, TENNIS H.\n\nCitation:\n\nThe President of the United States takes pleasure in presenting the Distinguished Service Cross to Tennis H. Carter (0-5301737), Captain (Infantry), U.S. Army, for extraordinary heroism in connection with military operations involving conflict with an armed hostile force in the Republic of Vietnam during the period 9 March 1966 to 12 March 1966, while serving with Detachment A-503, 5th Special Forces Group (Airborne), 1st Special Forces. At 0350 hours on 9 March 1966, Special Forces Detachments A-102 and A-503 positioned in Camp A Shau, Republic of Vietnam, were attacked by two reinforced Viet Cong battalions supported by small arms, recoilless rifles, mortar, and antiaircraft weapons. Captain Carter, commanding Detachment A-503, was asleep when the attack had opened. Several rounds exploded within his quarters, slightly wounding and stunning him. With disregard for his own personal safety, he ran outside some fifteen meters through the intense fire to assume his battle position on the camp's South Wall where he found the friendly defenders shocked and confused by the sudden bombardment. Captain Carter steadied and positioned his men right before the insurgents launched a two-company sized assault. The friendly defenders were able to repulse the attack causing the hostile forces heavy casualties. The attack continued throughout the day. Heavy and accurate small arms fire was not enough to stop Captain Carter from moving about to steady and encourage his men while attending to the many wounded. Early in the afternoon Captain Carter volunteered to accompany a select detail to secure the Camp's airstrip outside the East wall in order that two aircraft might land to assess the situation and evacuate a seriously wounded American. Upon landing, the aircraft and Captain Carter's detail came under heavy small arms fire. Being exposed to the fire, Captain Carter returned fire towards the insurgents until the evacuation and take-off of the two aircraft was completed. At 0400 hours on 10 March 1966, the insurgents launched the main assault at the East and South walls. Captain Carter, with the majority of his men on the North wall, braved the fierce insurgent fire to cross the camp to help the defenders on the South wall hold off the attack. Later on the camp's East wall was overrun by the insurgents putting Captain Carter and his men in a deadly crossfire which caused heavy casualties to the friendly defenders. Captain Carter and his men were able to hold off the Viet Cong for another seven hours until rescue aircraft could airlift a portion of the defenders from the battlefield. With his outnumbered men that remained in the camp, Captain Carter led two counterattacks at the insurgents but was driven back both times. At 1700 hours on 10 March 1966, the remaining defenders were ordered to withdraw from the camp and fight their way some 300 meters north to a helicopter landing zone. Again, personally braving the fire, Captain Carter rushed to help another comrade open a gate outside the North wall so the defenders could get through the camp's wire obstacles. This action caused him to miss the rescue helicopters. He and a small group of defenders were forced to evade the insurgents in the dense jungle until they were rescued on 12 March 1966.

On 24 May 1966, Sergeant First Class Casey, in charge of an interpreter, one Vietnamese Special Forces Troop, and thirty-four civilian irregular defense troops was assigned the mission of establishing a radio relay site between a civilian irregular defense group company and Camp Plei Djereng. While moving his radio site to acquire better communications, he observed and attacked five Viet Cong. His force was then attacked by sixty-five North Vietnamese. Realizing this was a major force, he called for and directed air strikes against the insurgents. The engagement continued for two hours. When the first air controller was shot down by small arms fire, a second air controller reported seeing the pilot walk away from the wreck. Despite the intense fire and the fact that they were outnumbered, Sergeant Casey and four other men started forward with the intent of rescuing the pilot. Approximately 200 meters from the wreckage, the small force came under a heavy barrage of small arms fire and Sergeant Casey was wounded in the arm. Despite the painful wound, he used his good arm to fire his weapon and continued to move forward in search of the downed pilot until he was mortally wounded.

Lieutenant Colonel Cavazos distinguished himself by exceptionally valorous actions on 30 October 1967 while, as battalion commander, he led his unit on a search and destroy operation in a large rubber plantation near Loc Ninh. One of his companies was making a reconnaissance when it suddenly began receiving heavy fire from a Viet Cong battalion in well-entrenched positions on the slope of a hill. Colonel Cavazos immediately led his other elements forward and engaged the enemy forces as they began assaulting the company. Constantly exposed to savage hostile fire and shrapnel from exploding grenades, he moved among his troops directing a counterattack. As the Viet Cong broke contact and fled to their fortified positions on the hillside, Colonel Cavazos called for air strikes and artillery fire on the crest and forward slopes of the hill in order to cut off the insurgents' line of retreat. When the fighting reached such close quarters that supporting fire could no longer be used, he completely disregarded his own safety and personally led a determined assault on the enemy positions. The assault was carried out with such force and aggressiveness that the Viet Cong were overrun and fled their trenches. Colonel Cavazos then directed artillery fire on the hilltop, and the insurgents were destroyed as they ran.

First Lieutenant Cecil distinguished himself by exceptionally valorous actions on 11 November 1967 as a platoon leader of an airborne infantry company conducting a search and destroy mission near Dak To. His platoon was leading the unit's maneuver when it was savagely ambushed by a North Vietnamese Army battalion firing rockets, mortars and automatic weapons. Courageously exposing himself to the intense fusillade, Lieutenant Cecil rallied his troops into a hasty defensive perimeter and directed their fires on the assaulting enemy force. He observed two of his wounded men lying outside the perimeter. Heedless of his safety, he raced through a hail of bullets and carried them from the ambush killing zone to cover. After giving his weapon to a man whose grenade launcher had been destroyed by shrapnel, he picked up an enemy assault rifle and sprayed the advancing ranks, killing three North Vietnamese. When his platoon received the order to withdraw to the company's defensive position, Lieutenant Cecil gallantly remained behind and engaged the hostile force with fierce rifle fire, killing six more enemy soldiers within ten meters of his location. He then rejoined his unit and, although wounded by shrapnel, assisted in placing claymore mines and distributing ammunition.

Captain Chamberlain distinguished himself by exceptionally valorous actions on 8 May 1967. Captain Chamberlain distinguished himself by exceptionally valorous actions while serving as Special Forces advisor to Vietnamese forces during a North Vietnamese attack on Camp Con Thien. At 1230 hours, a force of two enemy battalions assaulted the camp's defenses from two sides with artillery fire and ground attacks. Despite mortar and rocket fire falling around him, Captain Chamberlain directed the manning of key positions of automatic weapons and guided the American and Vietnamese commanders. Although he was wounded in a direct rocket hit on the command bunkers, he remained at his radio in an exposed position from which he could survey the battle's development. The insurgents had breached the outer perimeters and were rushing demolition teams and flame throwers toward the storage and equipment areas. Captain Chamberlain's bunker was engulfed in flames by a flame thrower, but he put out the flames on his clothes with his hands and withdrew to another area to organize Seabees in the defensive trenches. He led a counterattack through exploding mortars and rockets and the burning areas, stopping the human wave attacks of the enemy. Positioning himself in a forward position, Captain Chamberlain fired grenades which so effectively pinned down the insurgent masses that, at dawn, many were trapped and unable to withdraw from the shell craters in which they had taken cover during the night.

When his platoon came under intense fire from an estimated company-size North Vietnamese Army force in a concealed bunker complex, Sergeant Chamberlain led an assault on the communists. Seeing the point man wounded by enemy fire within ten feet of a bunker, he rushed forward and killed both occupants of the fortification. As the platoon continued to advance, the left flank received a heavy volume of automatic weapons and small arms fire from several concealed positions which wounded two men and trapped them in the hostile killing zone. Sergeant Chamberlain quickly organized an attack, sending one element against another stronghold that suddenly began firing from the right flank and spearheading the assault on the original positions. While fearlessly exposing himself to the enemy so that he could effectively fire into a bunker aperture, he was mortally wounded by the hostile fusillade.

Specialist Four Charles distinguished himself by exceptionally valorous actions on 4 October 1967 while serving as squad leader of an infantry unit on a search and destroy operation in War Zone C. While clearing an area surrounding his unit's night bivouac, his men were caught in a deadly crossfire from a numerically superior Viet Cong force firing from trees and concealed spider hole emplacements. When he saw his point man seriously wounded, Specialist Charles sprinted through a curtain of fire to reach an aidman and lead him to the wounded soldier. The medic was hit as they reached the casualty, and Specialist Charles shielded both men with his body while delivering lethal rifle fire into the enemy ranks to cover the evacuation of the injured men. After his ammunition was expended, he secured a machine gun and carried it to the front to continue his fearless fight against overwhelming odds. The insurgents concentrated withering fire on his precarious position, but he completely disregarded his personal safety and remained in the open to battle relentlessly against the determined attackers. He saw muzzle flashes from a nearby bunker, crawled across the bullet-swept battlefield, and destroyed the enemy fortification with grenades. Seeing a wounded man trapped in the open, he ran to the casualty and carried him to safety through a hail of bullets. As his unit began a withdrawal, Specialist Charles took up an extremely vulnerable position, and, with a recoilless rifle, he continued his offensive against the fanatical Viet Cong. Exposing himself to the savage barrage time after time, he fought fiercely, employing machine guns, grenades and the recoilless rifle to protect the movement of his men. Painfully wounded, he refused to abandon his hazardous position until the enemy attack abated. As evacuation helicopters arrived, the landing zone was raked by intense enemy fire.

Specialist Four Chedester distinguished himself by exceptionally valorous actions on 12 April 1968 as a platoon medic on a reconnaissance-in-force mission in War Zone C. Specialist Chedester's platoon had deployed into a night defensive position when it was subjected to intense enemy mortar fire. Following the mortar bombardment, a massive ground assault on the perimeter was launched by the insurgents. The mortar rounds had caught several personnel in the open and had inflicted several casualties. At the first call for a medic, Specialist Chedester unhesitant ran to the aid of his fallen comrades, ignoring the mortar rounds still exploding all about him. Despite the fact that the wounded were lying in open terrain, he proceeded to treat them where they were.

Sergeant Chervony distinguished himself by exceptionally valorous actions on 5 May 1968 at Landing Zone Peanuts, west of Khe Sanh. Late at night he detected the start of an attack against his battery position by an estimated North Vietnamese's Army sapper battalion. He immediately organized his three-man bunker, which was on the portion of the perimeter facing the brunt of the attack, and directed his companions' fire into the assaulting troops. His element's ammunition was soon expended and close fighting developed along the perimeter. Sergeant Chervony led his men across and expanse of unprotected exposed terrain to secure an unmanned machine gun. After directing his men to obtain additional ammunition for the weapon, he began placing withering fire into the aggressors. After exhausting his ammunition for the weapon, he took charge of personnel in adjacent positions and directed their deadly fire into the enemy, blunting the attack. Learning that several positions had been overrun, Sergeant Chervony unselfishly exposed himself to the continuing hostile fusillade to assist in rescuing the casualties in them. On separate trips, he evacuated five seriously wounded across one hundred meters of open terrain to a place of safety.

Sergeant Childress ignored the explosions and flying shrapnel around him and moved through his area to reconstitute the crews of two batteries which were the focus of the hostile attack. Seeing masses of insurgents converging on a critical howitzer, Sergeant Childress obtained permission to fire anti-personnel rounds. The Viet Cong then made a concerted effort to destroy his howitzer, since it was the main obstacle to their advance. With hostile rounds falling near his position and damaging the gun, he almost single-handedly maintained its steady fire. When the howitzer's sight mechanism was damaged, he sighted through the tube, inflicting devastating losses on the insurgents with more than 200 rounds of direct fire. The weapon was eventually destroyed by a direct hit and Sergeant Childress was seriously wounded. Bleeding badly and with one arm useless, he began moving ammunition from a burning area. As he was withdrawing from the area, another explosion wounded him more seriously. Unable to move his legs, he rolled into a ditch and continued to shout encouragement to the other cannoneers. Only after the Viet Cong had been decisively repulsed did he allow himself to be treated and prepared for medical evacuation. His steadfast and courageous actions prevented the fierce enemy assault from reaching the artillery. Sergeant First Class Childress' extraordinary heroism and devotion to duty were in keeping with the highest traditions of the military service and reflect great credit upon himself, his unit, and the United States Army.\n\nHeadquarters, US Army, Vietnam, General Orders No. 4152 (August 15, 1967)\n\nCHIRICHIGNO, LUIS G.\n\nCitation:\n\nThe President of the United States takes pleasure in presenting the Distinguished Service Cross to Luis G. Chirichigno, Captain (Signal Corps), U.S. Army, for extraordinary heroism in connection with military operations involving conflict with an armed hostile force in the Republic of Vietnam, while serving with Company B, 7th Battalion, 17th Cavalry, 1st Aviation Brigade. Captain Chirichigno distinguished himself by exceptionally valorous actions on 2 November 1969, as Platoon Commander of an aero-weapons Platoon while on a reconnaissance mission southwest of Duc Lap, Quang Duc Province. Captain Chirichigno's platoon of two light observation helicopters and two attack helicopters were searching for an enemy force of at least battalion size. One of the helicopters drew unexpectedly intense enemy fire and sustained excessive structural damage, necessitating a crash landing. Its sister ship followed the damaged aircraft down to extract its wounded crew. While attempting takeoff, the second aircraft also was shot down. All four crewmen were wounded. The downed aircraft had come down in an open field directly in the enemy's field of fire and subject to the full force of his reactive capability. Captain Chirichigno arrived overhead at the crash scene and with the other remaining airborne helicopter began to deliver suppressive and protective fire upon the enemy but without much success as the enemy fire both at the circling aircraft and the crash scene continued to increase in intensity. To more fully protect his downed companions, Captain Chirichigno moved his aircraft at low speed and altitude to assault the enemy at the tree-top level, destroying at least one machine gun position and its crew and inflicting significant other casualties among the enemy. Observing that an enemy platoon was advancing to within meters of the crash site, Captain Chirichigno maneuvered his helicopter through the fusillade of ever-increasing enemy fire to hover between the enemy and his comrades. In the presence of devastating enemy fire power and seemingly insurmountable odds and disregarding all personal risk, he challenged the enemy face-to-face at less than 20 meters. He exchanged machine gun and grenade fire with the enemy, killing at least seven of them and forcing the others to withdraw. Although seriously wounded in the exchange, he remained on station to defend his comrades and meet successive onslaughts until his gunship was silenced by overwhelming enemy firepower. Captain Chirichigno's exceptional bravery, determination and courage under fire gave his comrades sufficient time to escape the immediate enemy threat and inflicted vastly disproportionate damage upon the enemy in terms of the relative strengths of the opposing forces.\n\nDepartment of the Army, General Orders No. 44 (December 6, 1973)\n\nBorn: at Peru Home Town: San Antonio, Texas\n\n*CHOCK, LINUS GERALD K.\n\nCitation:\n\nThe President of the United States takes pride in presenting the Distinguished Service Cross (Posthumously) to Linus Gerald K.

Captain Chock distinguished himself by exceptionally valorous actions on 29 November 1966 while flying a light reconnaissance aircraft escorting a Vietnamese Army convoy near Bao Loc. At 1020 hours, the convoy came under heavy automatic weapons and recoilless rifle fire from a Viet Cong battalion. The troops in the convoy were pinned down by the vicious attack, and were unable to establish a perimeter. Captain Chock called for supporting artillery fire and air strikes, but realized that more immediate action was necessary to save the vulnerable ground force. Although his aircraft was only armed with four marking rockets, he dauntlessly elected to attack an insurgent strongpoint and draw fire from the besieged convoy. Although Captain Chock received intense ground fire, he destroyed the Viet Cong position on his second strike. Despite damage to his plane, he continued to disregard his safety and started a third pass on another insurgent emplacement. As he bravely dove at the hostile position, his aircraft was raked by ground fire, which mortally wounded him, and caused the plane to crash. His unimpeachable valor succeeded in allowing the Vietnamese force to maneuver into an organized defense and repel the Viet Cong force.

Chrietzberg, Sergeant, U.S. Army, for extraordinary heroism in connection with military operations involving conflict with an armed hostile force in the Republic of Vietnam, while serving with Company E, 1st Battalion, 8th Infantry, 4th Infantry Division. Sergeant Chrietzberg distinguished himself by exceptionally valorous actions on 12 March 1969 while serving as leader of a point team on a reconnaissance patrol near Polei Kleng. The team was ascending a ridge when suddenly assaulted by a force of North Vietnamese regulars. The assailants were quickly overcome, but snipers in trees and holes along the ridge continued to place harassing fire on the company's main force to the team's rear and forced it to withdraw, leaving the point team isolated. Several hours later the team began to move back to regain contact with the company. They came upon a bunker and tunnel complex and flushed out what resistance they met. Heavy sniper fire then descended upon them. They hastily scattered, pursued by streams of machine gun fire. Sergeant Chrietzberg dived into a foxhole with the assistant team leader. The two leaders had completely lost contact with their fellow team members. Impacting rockets and small arms fire restricted their movement. They hurled grenades at the machine gun and eliminated its suppressive fire. Together they crawled to the quieted machine gun emplacement and from there overcame three more enemy. The two men then took foot for their unit, but were again blocked by machine gun and small arms fire. They hurled grenades on the machine gun and silenced it, but enemy riflemen continued to harass them. They were both pinned down, and the assistant leader was seriously wounded. Sergeant Chrietzberg called in and accurately adjusted gunship fire on the harassing snipers. At dusk the two soldiers resumed their frustrated withdrawal, Sergeant Chrietzberg carrying his disabled companion until exhausted. After resting they pressed on, Sergeant Chrietzberg plodding along in front and his assistant crawling slowly behind. They covered some distance and were suddenly met with bursts of small arms fire and exploding grenades from a nearby bunker. Sergeant Chrietzberg cut down several enemy but was temporarily blinded from the hostile grenade flashes. His assistant then crawled unnoticed up to the enemy bunker and unleashed his last grenade, suffering critical wounds in the ensuing blast. Sergeant Chrietzberg attempted to administer first aid, but his comrade was failing fast. He made his way back to the unit and returned to the battlefield with medical assistance, but his comrade had already expired. Sergeant Chrietzberg's extraordinary heroism and devotion to duty were in keeping with the highest traditions of the military service and reflect great credit upon himself, his unit, and the United States Army.\n\nHeadquarters, US Army, Vietnam, General Orders No. 3492 (September 13, 1969)\n\nCHRISTIAN, DAVID A.\n\nCitation:\n\nThe President of the United States takes pleasure in presenting the Distinguished Service Cross to David A.

First Lieutenant Christian distinguished himself by exceptionally valorous actions on 29 October 1968 while in charge of the lead element of a reconnaissance-in-force mission ten miles northwest of Quan Loi. During an attempt to flank enemy positions, Lieutenant Christian's nine-man unit came under heavy rocket-propelled grenade, small arms and automatic weapons fire. After firing several light antitank weapons, he led an assault on the hostile strongholds, killing three North Vietnamese and causing others to flee. As he and his comrades advanced they again received intense small arms and machine gun fire and three men were wounded. Lieutenant Christian sent the casualties and the medic to the rear, and then led his troops forward until they became pinned down within ten meters of a bunker. Disregarding his safety, he assaulted the fortification single-handedly and destroyed it with hand grenades. The communists were reinforced by approximately thirty men, forcing the reconnaissance team to take cover behind a berm. Despite the enemy's devastating fire superiority, Lieutenant Christian attacked them with two antitank weapons. He was painfully wounded in the hand, but refused medical care and returned to the berm to direct artillery fire. When friendly reinforcements arrived two hours later, he directed them to cover his left flank while he attempted to evacuate his casualties. Although wounded again by an enemy rocket-propelled grenade, he did not permit himself to be treated until the other injured men had been evacuated. Lieutenant Christian's extraordinary heroism and devotion to duty were in the highest traditions of the military service and reflect great credit on him, his unit, and the United States Army.\n\nHeadquarters, US Army, Vietnam, General Orders No. 1192 (April 7, 1969)\n\nHome Town: Turnersville, New Jersey\n\nCIZMADIA, JOSEPH\n\nCitation:\n\nThe President of the United States takes pleasure in presenting the Distinguished Service Cross to Joseph Cizmadia (0-98395), Captain (Armor), U.S. Army, for extraordinary heroism in action in connection with military operations involving conflict with an armed hostile force in the Republic of Vietnam, while serving with Troop F, 2d Squadron, 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment. Captain Cizmadia distinguished himself by exceptionally valorous actions on 22 August 1968, as commander of an armored cavalry troop during the defense of the Special Forces camp and district headquarters at Loc Ninh. Captain Cizmadia's number of combat vehicles had been reduced from sixteen to nine in the previous three days by heavy fighting against a numerically superior North Vietnamese Army force. As he led his remaining men out to reconnoiter the area northeast of the village, they came under an intense barrage of small arms and rocket propelled grenade fire from entrenched positions in the tree line and jungle, resulting in several casualties. Unable to call for artillery or air strikes because of the proximity of his troops to the enemy, he realized that he must assault the aggressors to prevent further losses. Directing his track through the lines of halted vehicles, he advanced on the enemy. Inspired by his fearless example, his troops rallied and overran the North Vietnamese, killing eighteen and causing the others to retreat. As Captain Cizmadia directed the evacuation of his casualties, his rear guard was again taken under fire and a platoon leader was wounded. Braving the hostile fusillade, he moved his track in front of the platoon leader's vehicle to prevent it from taking further hits, and launched a successful assault which permitted the man to be evacuated. By the end of the day the communists were soundly defeated and left behind sixty of their dead.

Clark, First Lieutenant (Infantry), U.S. Army, for extraordinary heroism in connection with military operations involving conflict with an armed hostile force in the Republic of Vietnam, while serving with Company E, 3d Battalion, 21st Infantry, 196th Infantry Brigade, Americal Division. First Lieutenant Clark distinguished himself by exceptionally valorous actions on 1 December 1968 while leading a reconnaissance platoon through the mountainous Col De Ho Ho region of Tam Ky Province. When one of his squads happened upon a North Vietnamese hospital base camp, they were soon pinned down under intense hostile fire. Lieutenant Clark, located five hundred meters to the northwest, immediately led his squad to their assistance. As they neared the base camp, they detected movement ahead on the trail and opened fire, thwarting an ambush attempt. Lieutenant Clark's surprising maneuver confused the enemy forces who were assaulting the beleaguered squad, and scattered, allowing the trapped squad to withdraw. Directing his men to occupy several empty bunkers, he proceeded to call in artillery and gun ships on the hostile camp. While supporting fires delivered a devastating barrage, additional troops were airlifted into the combat area, and together with Lieutenant Clark's regrouped platoon, led an assault on the camp. Approaching the communist emplacements with a ten man patrol, Lieutenant Clark charged one of the bunkers alone and killed the occupants with a hand grenade. His patrol meanwhile flanked two additional bunkers and soon destroyed them. After a fierce battle which resulted in the destruction of the camp and the seizure of many weapons and supplies, the platoon retired with no casualties.

Specialist Four Clay distinguished himself by exceptionally valorous actions on 26 February 1969 as a squad leader with an ambush patrol composed of nine Americans and seven Popular Force soldiers. Shortly after the small unit set up an ambush near the village of Trung An, an estimated company of North Vietnamese entered their killing zone. In spite of the numerical superiority of the enemy, Specialist Clay initiated contact by detonating claymore mines and firing his machine gun. Although wounded by the communists' return fire, he continued to man the machine gun until a rocket-propelled grenade destroyed the weapon and almost severed his right leg. Disregarding his grievous injury, he crawled to a vantage point from which he directed the fire of the less experienced members of the patrol while reloading magazines and shouting words of encouragement. Another rocket-propelled grenade struck his exposed position, severing his right arm, but Specialist Clay continued to direct and encourage his comrades for the remainder of the battle. When the enemy withdrew an ambulance helicopter arrived and he was taken to a hospital where he succumbed to his wounds.

Private First Class Clayton distinguished himself by exceptionally valorous actions on 23 March 1968 while serving as a rifleman during a search and destroy operation near Hue. His unit came under intense enemy fire which caused several casualties. As medics maneuvered towards two of the wounded, Private Clayton placed fire on hostile positions and stood up to draw the communists' fire upon himself and away from the aidmen. When medics reached the injured soldiers, he joined them in their completely exposed area to provide suppressive covering fire for them as they worked to save their patients. Later, five men including two medics were wounded and pinned down by the fusillade. Exposing himself to the heavy machine gun fire, Private Clayton secured a supply of battle dressings and maneuvered to them to treat their wounds. After dragging a seriously wounded medical officer seventy-five meters to a place of relative safety, he returned through the bullet-swept area to aid another man who was bleeding profusely. He tended his comrade's wounds and then returned to the medical officer to further treat his extensive injuries. Private Clayton next called in mortar and aerial rocket artillery support on the enemy as he shielded his patient from continuing fire. With the help of another man he then dragged the officer seventy-five meters to an evacuation point.

Captain Clement distinguished himself by exceptionally valorous actions on 23 February 1967 while serving as senior advisor to a company of Vietnamese Irregular troops. In an attempt to take a well-fortified Viet Cong hamlet, Captain Clement's company was pinned down by intense hostile fire. Three men were seriously wounded in the initial barrage and, when the company withdrew, were left lying in an open field 150 meters away. Despite intense and accurate machine gun fire, Captain Clement fearlessly ran across the field, picking up one of the soldiers and carried him to safety. Turning immediately, he raced back across the ravaged area, ignoring the murderous fire hitting all around him, and brought another stricken man back. Inspired by his heroic actions, two soldiers joined him on the treacherous third trip. Although he was the focus of increasing hostile fire, Captain Clement would not be driven back. Suddenly, he was wounded by a well-concealed Viet Cong machine gun, directly in front of the man he was attempting to save. Ignoring his wounds, he took the first aid kit and crawled toward the fallen soldier. Captain Clement was still trying to reach the man when he was mortally wounded by a second burst of machine gun fire. His unimpeachable valor and profound concern for others inspired the beleaguered Vietnamese company to hold its position and rout the numerically superior enemy.

Clemmons, Master Sergeant, U.S. Army (Retired), for extraordinary heroism in connection with military operations involving conflict with an armed hostile force in the Republic of Vietnam. Master Sergeant Clemmons, Retired, distinguished himself by extraordinary heroism against an armed enemy in the vicinity of Xuan Loc, Vietnam, on 14 June 1971, while serving as Commander of Company D, 2d Battalion (Airmobile), 5th Cavalry, 1st Cavalry Division. Company D, while on a reconnaissance mission east of Xuan Loc, encountered an undetermined superior size force which opened fire with 40-mm. rockets, automatic weapons fire, claymores, and 60-mm. mortars. During the initial contact he front platoon suffered immediate heavy casualties. Sergeant Clemmons maneuvered the two uncommitted platoons to provide supporting fire on both flanks where the casualties were located, while directing gunship and artillery fire to suppress the enemy's fire superiority. While the flank platoons provided supporting fire, Sergeant Clemmons advanced to the enemy's killing zone to bring back his wounded men. He pulled one man back and carried him to a safe location. Upon his return, he was wounded in the chest by AK-47 fire. Bleeding severely and crawling, he reentered the killing zone and brought back two other wounded men. His men, inspired by his action, increased the tempo of aggressiveness and their fire while maneuvering and closing in on the enemy. Sergeant Clemmons, in pain and bleeding profusely, crawled a third time into the killing zone and retrieved a fourth wounded man. Rejoining the closing and flanking platoons, Sergeant Clemmons directed air and artillery fire on the bunker complex occupied by the larger enemy force and continued to direct the platoons closing in on the enemy, forcing them to withdraw and abandon their fortified bunkers which saved the lives of several of his seriously wounded men still caught in the enemy's killing zone.

Sergeant Cline distinguished himself by exceptionally valorous actions while leading a rifle squad against hostile forces near Phan Thiet, Republic of Vietnam, on 6 February 1968. Sergeant Cline was serving as a rifle squad leader in an infantry rifle platoon during a search-and-destroy operation. Late in the afternoon, his entire company became pinned down by intensive enemy automatic weapons, rocket, machinegun, and mortar fire. Sergeant Cline was immediately wounded in both legs and fell in the open, completely exposed to hostile fire. Another sergeant moved out to help him but, upon reaching Sergeant Cline, was also cut down by automatic weapons fire as the enemy concentrated their fire on the two paratroopers. Realizing that both of them would probably be killed, Sergeant Cline, with an act of indomitable courage, dragged himself on top of his wounded comrade in order to shield him from the hail of enemy bullets. He was then struck several times and killed by the fusillade, but his complete disregard for his own personal safety resulted in his comrade surviving and being able to crawl back to friendly elements.

Platoon Sergeant Cobb distinguished himself by exceptionally valorous actions on 14 January 1968 while leading his platoon in an attack near Dai Luong. A scout helicopter, performing a reconnaissance at Sergeant Cobb's request, made contact with elements of a Viet Cong regiment in a rock and cave complex in which the platoon was operating. Sergeant Cobb deployed his troops for an assault and immediately received sporadic but deadly rifle and grenade fire. The initial burst wounded the two point men. Sergeant Cobb quickly directed counter fire which accounted for two enemy dead. He then placed himself on the point as the platoon maneuvered around a series of openings in the rocks. Sergeant Cobb spent the next hour creeping forward to hurl explosive charges into the caves. Disregarding his safety, he repeatedly engaged the enemy, personally killing three Viet Cong. At dusk, as he was approaching a cave, an enemy soldier suddenly appeared and, with a burst of automatic rifle fire, mortally wounded Sergeant Cobb.

Sergeant First Class Coehlo distinguished himself by exceptionally valorous actions on 10, 11, 14 and 15 August 1970 while serving as team leader during two rescue operations deep within enemy controlled territory. Shortly after being inserted by helicopter into the landing zone, Sergeant Coehlo's three- man rescue team engaged a large hostile force. The enemy fire was so intense that the small American patrol was pinned down until the sergeant could direct tactical air strikes upon the adversary. During allied movement from the contact area, Sergeant Coehlo engaged and eliminated an enemy sniper preparing to fire at his comrades. Upon reaching the pickup site, an extraction helicopter returned the team to their base camp. In the following days, Sergeant Coehlo's element was again inserted into hostile territory in an attempt to rescue three wounded American soldiers. After disembarking in the landing zone, his patrol came under intense enemy fire. Observing an allied soldier fall to the ground, the sergeant immediately raced through the barrage of bullets to assist his downed comrade and to administer emergency first aid to his wounds. Realizing the gravity of their exposed position, Sergeant Coehlo summoned helicopter gunships and medical helicopters to the embattled area. Once again braving the enemy fusillade, the sergeant moved the injured soldiers from their insecure location to defensive cover within the allied perimeter. Then, the determined sergeant remained in the open while coordinating the friendly gunship fire at the belligerents.

Under a curtain of fire, Sergeant Coffroth immediately moved his squad to a more protected position. Upon reaching it, his element came under heavy grazing fire from a flanking bush line. With complete disregard for his safety, Sergeant Coffroth maneuvered to the edge of the brush, killed five of the enemy, and captured three automatic weapons and a rocket launcher. As he led his squad into the bush line, it received automatic weapons fire from a fortified bunker. Again exposing him self to a hail of bullets, Sergeant Coffroth destroyed the position with a rocket launcher, killing thirteen more insurgents.

Staff Sergeant Coleman distinguished himself by exceptionally valorous actions on 13 February 1968 during combat operations near Tan Pha Trang. His platoon was part of a force given the mission to assault a well-entrenched Viet Cong regiment. As his element charged the bunker complex, it was subjected to a savage enemy rocket and automatic weapons barrage, and several of his men fell wounded in front of the Viet Cong positions. Sergeant Coleman quickly organized a rescue squad. With bullets striking all around him, he moved to the casualties, shielded them with his body and treated their injuries. His squad suppressed the hostile fire momentarily, and he directed that the wounded be evacuated. One of his team was hit when the insurgents resumed their devastating fusillade on the withdrawing troops.
