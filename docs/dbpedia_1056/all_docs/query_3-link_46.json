        "text": "End of Watch: Saturday, October 27, 1900\n\nOfficer William Davis Mitchell, 36, was shot and killed after being dispatched to a disturbance at a local saloon.\n\nOfficer Mitchell had just gotten off duty, but volunteered to respond to a call about a disturbance at Puss Hannahâ€™s Chili Parlor on N. 6th Street near Austin Avenue. Officer Mitchell galloped to the scene on his horse.\n\nWhen he arrived at the scene, Will King exited the parlor with a gun in his hand. King shot Mitchell as Mitchell dismounted. Although Mitchell then returned fire from his revolver, he had been fatally shot by King. With his wife and three daughters at his side, Officer Mitchell died at 9 p.m. that evening. He was buried in Oakwood Cemetery.\n\nWill King was arrested a short time later and was executed one year later.\n\nOfficer Mitchell had been with the agency for six months. He was survived by his wife and three children."
