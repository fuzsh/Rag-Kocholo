Fishburne, president/CEO of Special Olympics North Carolina.\n\nFor the first time since the Torch Run efforts began in North Carolina in 1988, Lt. Davis becomes the first university law enforcement officer in the state to serve as director.\n\nThe North Carolina Law Enforcement Torch Run® for Special Olympics unites officers from law enforcement agencies and corrections facilities across the state in an annual effort to raise funds and awareness for Special Olympics North Carolina. In 2019, more than $1.3 million was raised for Special Olympics NC through the Torch Run efforts. A statewide committee of officers from various agencies and several Special Olympics NC athletes oversee the annual activities of the NC LETR throughout the state.\n\nIn this volunteer position, Lt. Davis will serve as chairman of the NC LETR Council, preside over the annual NC LETR Conference and drive recruitment efforts of law enforcement agencies and officers for the Torch Run’s fundraising and public awareness campaign. The NC LETR Council is comprised of law enforcement officers providing logistical support for signature event fundraisers and collaboration with SONC staff for various Torch Run activities.\n\nLt. Davis became the agency Torch Run coordinator for the NC State University Police Department in 2013 with the agency’s signature fundraising event being a polar plunge and 5K run on NC State’s Centennial Campus. Since 2013, his agency has raised nearly $120,000 for SONC. He is also an advisor to the NC State Special Olympics College Club, which engages NC State students in Special Olympics activities. In 2015, he became a member of the NC LETR Council.\n\nProfessionally, Lt. Davis is an internal affairs manager for the NC State University Police Department. He has been with the university since 1999 and completed training with the Coastal Plain Law Enforcement Management Institute – Coastal Plain Law Enforcement Training Center, Methodist University’s West Point Leadership Program, Gavin De ‘Beckers & Associates Advanced Threat Assessment and Management Academy and the NC State Administrative Officers Management Program.\n\nLaw enforcement officers and agencies interested in joining the North Carolina Law Enforcement Torch Run for Special Olympics North Carolina should contact Leslie Moyar at lmoyar@sonc.net.\n\nAbout the NC Law Enforcement Torch Run\n\nThe Law Enforcement Torch Run is an international fundraising campaign for Special Olympics. Special Olympics provides year-round sports training and competition for more than 5.4 million children and adults around the world who have intellectual disabilities. Nearly 40,000 athletes participate in Special Olympics in North Carolina, making it one of the largest Special Olympics programs in the world.\n\nThe Law Enforcement Torch Run® for Special Olympics is officially endorsed by the International Association of Chiefs of Police, the North Carolina Association of Chiefs of Police, the National Sheriff’s Association, the North Carolina Sheriff’s Association, the International Association of Campus Law Enforcement Administrators, the National Association of School Resource Officers, NC Association of School Resource Officers, NC Department of Justice and the NC Department of Public Safety."
