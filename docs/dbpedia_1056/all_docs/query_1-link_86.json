        "text": "After graduation, Saint Louis University alumni head out into the world to make a difference — in their fields, in their communities and in the lives of others. SLU is pleased to honor their achievements with a variety of awards.\n\nAlumni Merit Awards\n\nAlumni Merit Awards are given to distinguished graduates from 12 of SLU’s schools, colleges and degree-granting centers in recognition of their outstanding achievement, dedication to a chosen profession and commitment to the mission of the University.\n\nAlumni are welcome to nominate their fellow SLU graduates for the awards. The National Alumni Board, Division of Development, academic leadership and faculty select the winners. Recipients are honored at an annual award ceremony held the week of commencement.\n\nReview the award criteria and learn how to nominate a SLU graduate for an Alumni Merit Award now.\n\nPast Alumni Merit Award Recipients\n\nPioneer Award\n\nAs the first institution of higher learning west of the Mississippi River, Saint Louis University was founded and operated to educate pioneers who helped shape the history of our region and nation. In honor of this enterprising spirit, SLU's Pioneer Award annually recognizes a graduate who is driven, hardworking, innovative and committed to Jesuit ideals, and whose actions and accomplishments have helped pave the way for others. The recipient of this award is honored at an annual ceremony held commencement week.\n\nReview the award criteria and learn how to nominate a SLU graduate for a Pioneer Award.\n\nPast Pioneer Award Recipients ​\n\nBAA Distinguished Service Award\n\nThe Black Alumni Association’s annual award honors those who make outstanding contributions to the African-American community through religious, cultural, civic, professional and/or educational efforts and accomplishments.\n\nTo nominate an individual for the award, send the award application and corresponding materials to LaVerne Robinson at robinslp@slu.edu. Nominees need not be a SLU graduate, however, the award is not given posthumously.\n\nOrder of the Fleur de Lis Hall of Fame\n\nInclusion in the SLU School of Law’s Order of the Fleur de Lis Hall of Fame is granted to alumni who bring honor to the school through their professional success, significant contributions to the community and demonstrated Jesuit spirit. Honorees are inducted into the Hall of Fame in an annual ceremony.\n\nAlumni are welcome to nominate fellow graduates for induction to the order. Inductees are selected by a committee comprising the dean, alumni and staff.\n\nOrder of the Fleur de Lis Members\n\nSchool of Medicine Alumni Association Community Service Award\n\nEstablished in 2011, this award recognizes and honors service demonstrated by School of Medicine graduates.\n\nSchool of Medicine Early Achievement Award\n\nEstablished in 2015, this award is presented to an alumna/alumnus who graduated from the Saint Louis University School of Medicine within the past 20 years and who has demonstrated excellence in medical practice or research, service to the community and/or commitment to Saint Louis University.\n\nSpirit of the Billiken Award\n\nIn honor of the 1818 founding of Saint Louis University, the Office of Alumni Engagement created the Spirit of the Billiken Senior Recognition Program, which recognizes 18 students who are in their final year of study and are committed to being proud and dedicated SLU alumni. These students represent what it means to be a Billiken and excel in all of the following areas: academics, leadership, community service, commitment to Saint Louis University and dedication to living SLU's mission after graduation."
