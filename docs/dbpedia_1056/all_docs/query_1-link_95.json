This amendment built upon a $5 million increase Congressman Cohen secured in 2014, boosting total, nationwide funding to $45 million – a 25% increase. As a result of the availability of nationwide funding, Memphis received a nearly $2 million federal grant to help reduce its local rape kit backlog.\n\nCongressman Cohen cosponsored the Sentencing Reform Act of 2015. This bipartisan bill reduces mandatory minimums for drug offenses, applies them retroactively to offenders who do not have prior violent felonies, gives judges more flexibility when dealing with offenders with prior misdemeanors, and retroactively applies the disparity reduction between crack and powder cocaine enacted in the Fair Sentencing Act.\n\nCongressman Cohen has cosponsored numerous bills to combat gun violence including: the Background Check Completion Act to close the loophole that allowed the shooter at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, SC to obtain a gun; the Gun Show Loophole Closing Act of 2015 to require gun show operators to undergo a background check, ensure that operators have not lied or concealed information from the national registry, and have verified the identity of every participating gun show vender; and the Denying Firearms and Explosives to Dangerous Terrorists Act of 2015 to prohibit the sale of firearms and explosives to those on the terrorist watch list.\n\nProtecting Civil Rights\n\nCongressman Cohen introduced the Police Training and Independent Review Act to create an incentive for states to require independent investigation and prosecution of incidents in which police use of deadly force results in a death or injury.

A Justice Department investigation is now ongoing.\n\nCongressman Cohen introduced the National Statistics on Deadly Force Transparency Act to press states to collect data in all instances in which police use deadly force and report it to the Department of Justice.\n\nCongressman Cohen introduced the SIMPLE Voting Act of 2015 to ensure polling locations are accessible, appropriately equipped and staffed, and wait times are not excessive. Congressman Cohen has also cosponsored numerous bills to protect voting rights including the Voting Rights Advancement Act of 2015 to restore the Voting Rights Act of 1965 struck down by the U.S. Supreme Court and make improvements to the underlying law, and the America Votes Act of 2015 to allow voters to provide a sworn, written statement attesting to their identification as a means by which to meet voter identification requirements.\n\nKeeping Memphians Moving\n\nCongressman Cohen served as a member of a House-Senate conference committee to finalize the first multi-year highway bill in a decade. In addition to providing funding for local highway projects like Lamar Ave., the bill, now law, included Congressman Cohen's amendment to help improve paratransit services like Memphis Area Transit Authority's MATAplus Service for seniors, veterans and individuals with disabilities.\n\nEconomic Empowerment\n\nCongressman Cohen helped secure a $30 million Choice Neighborhood Grant from the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to redevelop Foote Homes and revitalize Memphis, invest in schools, public transportation, and job creation. Memphis' selection as a Choice Neighborhood results from years of Congressman Cohen working closely with the City of Memphis and HUD Secretary Julian Castro.\n\nCongressman Cohen is a cosponsor of the Pay Workers a Living Wage Act to increase the minimum wage from its current level of $7.25 an hour to $15 an hour by 2020.\n\nCongressman Cohen voted for legislation, now law, to permanently extend the Earned Income Tax Credit.

It encourages and rewards work as well allows families with children to keep more of their money.\n\nHousing\n\nCongressman Cohen wrote Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Julian Castro to request a federal investigation of Goodwill Village, Tulane, and Warren Apartments, following reports of deplorable conditions. HUD completed a 100% inspection in July and August 2015. Further investigation is ongoing.\n\nBuilding a Healthier Memphis\n\nCongressman Cohen led the bipartisan efforts of the Tennessee delegation to the U.S. House to get a guarantee $530 million over the next 10 years in disproportionate share hospital (DSH) allotments to help Tennessee's hospitals and community health centers recoup expenses incurred while caring for those who cannot afford to pay. He also helped enact a $2 billion increase in funding for the National Institutes of Health to boost research for cures for diseases like Alzheimer's, cancer, diabetes, heart disease and strokes.\n\nCongressman Cohen introduced the CARERS Act. This bipartisan bill allows states to set their own medical marijuana policies and allows for greater access to Charlotte's Web cannabidiol (CBD) to help children with seizures like 3-year-old Memphian Chloe Grauer who was denied this treatment and ultimately passed away.\n\nCongressman Cohen has voted more than 60 times against efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act. While the Tennessee legislature's failure to expand Medicaid coverage has denied full benefits of the law to Memphians, the law has already reduced the number of uninsured in Tennessee and across the country. He also helped block efforts in Congress to eliminate federal funding for women's health services at Planned Parenthood.\n\nRetirement Security\n\nCongressman Cohen has cosponsored several bills to help protect and enhance Social Security benefits including the Seniors Deserve a Raise Act, the Guaranteed 3% COLA for Seniors Act, and the CPI for Seniors Act to ensure that seniors receive appropriate cost-of-living adjustments.\n\nCongressman Cohen cosponsored the Keep Our Pensions Promises Act. This bill prohibits trustees of multiemployer pension plans from reducing retirees' monthly benefits. It would also safeguard promised benefits by creating a new legacy fund that would insure participants from companies that leave multiemployer plans, and subsequently stop paying into them, will continue to receive benefits.\n\nEducation\n\nCongressman Cohen successfully offered an amendment to the Elementary and Secondary Education Reauthorization Act to allow funds to be used for restorative justice programs to reduce the school-to-prison pipeline.

Provision included in H.R. 83, Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015.\n\nSigned into law on 12/16/14\n\nThis deficit-neutral amendment transfered $5 million in federal funds to a new grant program focused specifically on helping law enforcement agencies and cut through their sexual assault kit backlogs. The additional funding would increase the grant program's budget by nearly 15%, from $36 million to $41 million, and increase Memphis' chances of receiving the funding necessary to significantly reduce its rape kit backlog.\n\nH.R.3658, Monuments Men Recognition Act of 2014\n\nSigned into law on 6/9/14\n\nEnsures that the World War II unit known as the \"Monuments Men\" receives a Congressional Gold Medal, Congress' highest recognition for distinguished achievements and contributions.

Because of an unjustifiable change to the bankruptcy code made in 2005, student loans from private lenders are no longer treated the same as other types of private debt in bankruptcy proceedings, meaning students can be saddled for life with mountains of fees and loan debt that they have no hope of ever paying off.\n\nH.R.3086, Permanent Internet Tax Freedom Act\n\nPassed the House on 7/15/14\n\nThis bipartisan legislation amends the Internet Tax Freedom Act to make permanent the ban on state and local taxation of Internet access and on multiple or discriminatory taxes on electronic commerce.
