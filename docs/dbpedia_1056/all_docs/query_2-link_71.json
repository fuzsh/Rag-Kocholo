        "text": "John Hanks Alexander - Class of 1887\n\nJohn Hanks Alexander is best known as the second African American to graduate from the United States Military Academy at West Point. Alexander was born on January 6, 1864 in Helena, Arkansas, to James and Fannie Alexander, who were both born as slaves in Virginia, and had six other siblings. In 1849, while still a slave, John’s father began working as a prominent barber who attracted many customers in Helena, Arkansas. His success allowed him to purchase freedom for himself and his family along with property. Nineteen-year-old Alexander entered West Point in 1883 as the last of the 120 cadets accepted. While at West Point Alexander was respected by his fellow cadets due to his intellect. Nonetheless, he could not escape the racial discrimination common for that time and was socially ostracized by these same cadets just as Flipper had been earlier. Alexander graduated from West Point in 1887.\n\nAlexander was stationed with the Ninth Cavalry, a Buffalo Soldier regiment, at Fort Robinson, Nebraska. At the time of his posting he was the only black officer in the Army commissioned to lead troops in combat. In early 1894 Alexander was assigned to Wilberforce University, an African American institution in Xenia, Ohio, as a professor to teach military science and tactics, the first appointment of its kind in history. On March 26, 1894, Alexander died at age 30 due to apoplexy and was buried near Wilberforce University with full military honors. He was later honored by the U.S. Department of War when Camp Alexander in Newport News, Virginia, was named after him in 1918.\n\nCharles Young - Class of 1889\n\nBrigadier General Charles Young graduated from West Point in 1889. A Buffalo Soldier serving with the 9th and 10th Cavalry and the 25th Infantry, Young eventually became the first African American to achieve the rank of colonel in the United States Army. Charles Young was born to ex-slaves in Mays Lick, Kentucky in 1864. In 1889 he became the third African American to graduate from the Academy.\n\nAs a second lieutenant, Young’s assignment options were limited to the four Buffalo Soldier regiments. After serving five years on the “Western Front” with the 9th and 10th Cavalry Regiments, Young left to become a professor of Military Science and Tactics for four years, between 1894 and 1898, at all-black Wilberforce University in Ohio, where he became close, lifetime friends with fellow faculty member W.E.B. DuBois.\n\nYoung returned to active military service as a major in the 10th Cavalry of Buffalo Soldiers during U.S. operations in Cuba and the Philippines. He was in command of the cavalry as they participated in the celebrated charge up San Juan Hill. In 1903, Young was appointed superintendent of the Sequoia and General Grant National Parks in California. He was the first African American to hold the post of National Park Superintendent. In 1904, Captain Young became the first Military Attaché to Haiti and the Dominican Republic on the island of Hispaniola. Young joined 23 other officers (the only African American among them) serving in these diplomatic posts in the Theodore Roosevelt administration.\n\nWhen the United States entered World War I in 1917, many assumed Young, the highest ranking African American in the Army, would be given a prominent command. Instead, he was declared physically unfit for duty due to high blood pressure. After a 500-mile horse ride from Ohio to Washington, D.C. to prove his fitness, Young was returned to active duty in 1918 and promoted to Colonel. He was later appointed United States military attaché to Liberia. Colonel Charles Young died in 1922 while visiting Lagos, the capital of British Nigeria. He was interred in Lagos with full honors by British troops. However his body was returned to the United States in 1923 and interred at Arlington National Cemetery. The eulogy was delivered by his friend W.E.B. DuBois.\n\nThe Cadet Gospel Choir has twice completed the Colonel Charles Young Haiti Mission Trip honoring Colonel Young’s legacy.\n\nIn recognition of the service and achievements of U.S. Army Col. Charles Young, the Under Secretary of the Army, Hon. Gabe Camarillo, promoted Young to the rank of Brigadier General, at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, April 29, 2022.\n\nTo learn more about Young and how we honor him, visit BG Charles Young’s page.\n\nBenjamin O. Davis, Jr. - Class of 1936\n\nBenjamin Davis, Jr. was born on December 18, 1912, in Washington, DC, son of Elnora Dickinson and Benjamin O. Davis, Sr., who held the honor of being the first African American to earn the rank of general in the U.S. Army. Davis’ West Point appointment came at the recommendation of the only African American then serving in congress, Representative Oscar S. DePriest. Davis became one of the few African Americans to graduate from West Point before World War II. He was never assigned a roommate and his classmates frequently refused to fraternize with him. Despite being alienated by his peers, Davis persevered, and graduated in the top 15 percent of his class.\n\nIn 1943, Davis was promoted to full Colonel and assumed command of a larger Tuskegee fighter group, the 332nd “Red Tails.” The Red Tails shot down more than 100 German planes during the war and flew some 15,000 missions. In a 1945 confrontation with the German air force, unit pilots downed three of the Luftwaffe’s groundbreaking ME-262 jet fighters, aircraft with performances vastly superior to the propeller- driven planes of the U.S. Army. For his accomplished leadership and his own piloting ability, Davis was awarded the Silver Star and the Distinguished Flying Cross.\n\nWhen President Harry S. Truman established the Air Force as a separate branch of the armed services in 1947, Davis became one of it founding officers. Finally permitted to command integrated units, Davis was given a variety of key posts over the next decade. He was appointed chief of staff for American forces in Korea in 1953, and later commanded the 13th Air Force group at Clark Air Force Base in the Philippines. After that appointment, he was named the Air Force’s first General, and after another decade of impressive service, he was promoted to three-star Lieutenant General, surpassing his father in becoming the first African American to attain such a high rank. He died on July 4, 2002.\n\nTwo years after his retirement, Davis was named a four-star general by President Bill Clinton. Eighty-five years after his graduation, USMA has payed homage to Davis' legacy with the dedication of the newest, most innovative and eco-friendly barracks in his memory. On August 18, 2017 the U.S. Military Academy superintendent, Lt. Gen. Robert L. Caslen Jr., along with West Point cadets, staff and faculty, and members of Davis' family, cut the ribbon to the barracks that stands tall above the rest.\n\nRoscoe Robinson, Jr. - Class 1951\n\nRoscoe Robinson, Jr. was the first African American to become a four-star general in the United States Army. Robinson was also the first African-American to command the 82nd Airborne Division.\n\nRobinson was born on October 11, 1928, in St. Louis, Missouri. He attended St. Louis University for only a year and then transferred to the United States Military Academy at West Point in 1947. He graduated with a degree in military engineering in 1951.\n\nRobinson served in the Korean in 1952 as a platoon leader and rifle company commander. For his actions, he received the Bronze Star. Sent back to the United States a year later he became an instructor in the Airborne Department of the United States Army Infantry School. He then went on to graduate from the Command and General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas in 1963. The following year he received his master’s degree from the University of Pittsburgh in international affairs.\n\nBy 1967, Robinson was serving as a battalion commander in Vietnam. For his actions and achievements, he received the Legion of Merit, the Distinguished Flying Cross, 11 Air Medals, and two Silver Stars. After Vietnam, Robinson served at the National War College for three years as the executive officer to the Chief of Staff. He was promoted to Brigadier General and in 1975 became Commanding General of the United States Army Garrison, Okinawa.\n\nIn 1976, Robinson was promoted to Major General and assigned to command the 82nd Airborne Division at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. General Robinson was the first African-American to command 82nd Airborne Division. After a battle with leukemia, Robinson died on July 22, 1993, at the age of 64.\n\nJoseph B.
