        "text": "FLANDREAU, S.D. (Dakota News Now) - The recent passing of Moody County Chief Deputy Ken Prorok has prompted residents and law enforcement to look back on another fallen officer. Deputy William Davis was killed in the line of duty just over two decades ago.\n\nInside the Moody County Courthouse, you’ll find a plaque honoring Deputy Davis. He served 21 years in law enforcement and was 54 years old when he was killed in the line of duty on November 23rd, 2003.\n\n“Unfortunately, he was out arresting a guy for failing to sign his ticket for over-driving the road conditions that had already went into the ditch. Another vehicle lost control while going over the Big Sioux bridge on I-29, about mile maker 124. The vehicle lost control, struck Deputy Davis’s patrol car and Deputy Davis, striking him and killing him,” said Moody County Sheriff Troy Wellman.\n\nThe Moody County Sheriff’s Office said they will be working with the family to create a memorial for Chief Deputy Ken Prorok as well. It will remind both law enforcement and the public of the sacrifice made in the line of duty.\n\n”We do a job that we may lose our life any given day that we go out. Deputy Davis’s memorial reminds us of that. I’m right now the only officer that’s still here in the county that was here when he was here,” said Sheriff Wellman.\n\nIn the meantime, Governor Kristi Noem has ordered that flags be flown at half-staff on Thursday in honor of Prorok and his funeral taking place that day."
