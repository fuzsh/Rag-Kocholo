Flight Sub-Lieutenant Smylie's machine was received by very heavy fire and brought down. The pilot planed down over the station, releasing all his bombs except one, which failed to drop, simultaneously at the station from a very low altitude. Thence he continued his descent into the marsh. On alighting he saw the one unexploded bomb, and set fire to his machine, knowing that the bomb would ensure its destruction. He then proceeded towards Turkish territory.\n\nAt this moment he perceived Squadron-Commander Davies descending, and fearing that he would come down near the burning machine and thus risk destruction from the bomb, Flight Sub-Lieutenant Smylie ran back and from a short distance exploded the bomb by means of a pistol bullet. Squadron-Commander Davies descended at a safe distance from the burning machine, took up Sub-Lieutenant Smylie, in spite of the near approach of a party of the enemy, and returned to the aerodrome, a feat of airmanship that can seldom have been equalled for skill and gallantry.\n\n_____\n\n..... in recognition of their bravery and devotion to duty during minesweeping and mine-laying operations:\n\nTo receive the Distinguished Service Cross.\n\nLieutenant Humphrey John Lancaster, R.N.\n\nLieutenant Robert Jardine Carruthers, R.N.V.R.\n\nSub-Lieutenant Alexander Daniells, R.N.R.\n\nSub-Lieutenant George Grimshaw Rose, R.N.R.\n\nSub -Lieutenant William Quinn McKeown, R.N.R.\n\nSub-Lieutenant Harry Beedle, R.N.R.\n\nGunner (T) Arthur Samuel Edmund Roberts, R.N.\n\nArtificer-Engineer Arthur Lewis Shaw, R.N.\n\nSkipper Frederick Wink, R.N.R.\n\nSkipper Francis McPherson, R.N.R.\n\n..... award of the Distinguished Service Cross to the undermentioned Officers:\n\nLieutenant Ralph Daniel Blyth Haddon, R.N.

One of these he brought down out of control, and a few minutes later he attacked another at close range and brought it down in flames. On 23rd May, 1917, he led a formation of five machines to attack at least twice that number of hostile aeroplanes. Both formations became split up, and a general fight ensued. Five times during the combat he drove off hostile aeroplanes from another of our machines, and one of those which he attacked was seen to go down in a spin.\n\n____\n\n....awarded a Bar to the Distinguished Service Cross for subsequent acts of gallantry:\n\nFlt.-Cdr.

Little attacked one at fifty yards range, and brought it down out of control. A few minutes later he attacked a red scout with a larger machine than the rest. This machine was handled with great skill, but by clever manoeuvring Flt.-Lieut. Little got into a good position and shot it down out of control.

Thomas Francis Netterville Gerrard, R.N.A.S. In recognition of his services during an air fight on the 4th June, 1917. This officer led his flight against 15-20 hostile aeroplanes, and alone had ten engagements with these machines. He attacked one, and fired sixty rounds into its cockpit at point-blank range, the enemy machine rolling over and over for 3,000 feet, and then falling vertically out of control. He then attacked another enemy machine which had dived on to one of our machines from behind, and with the help of a Scout he shot it down, the enemy being seen to crash to the ground. Another hostile scout was then attacked by pilot, end-on, and received a long burst at very close range, the enemy going down in a spin, but apparently righting himself lower down. During this last encounter Flt. Cdr. Gerrard's machine was riddled with bullets, but, by fine piloting, he landed safely, although all but his lateral controls were shot away and his machine damaged to such an extent as to require return to Depot for complete rebuilding. This officer has now destroyed at least seven hostile aircraft. He was on active service in France and Belgium from April to September, 1916, and during that period performed much valuable work.\n\nFlt. Cdr. Reginald Frederick Stuart Leslie, R.N.A.S.

He was unable to observe its fate, as he was himself immediately attacked from behind by two other hostile machines and temporarily lost control. When he regained control, the machine which he had first attacked had disappeared, and two others were proceeding eastwards at a considerable height above him. He then returned safely to his aerodrome.\n\nFlt. Lieut. Guy Duncan Smith, R.N.A.S. In recognition of his services in the East Indies and Egypt Seaplane Squadron during the period 1st April, 1916-31st March, 1917.
