Houlihan, Jr., and Brendan Faulkner have all been selected for inclusion in the 2024 edition of The Best Lawyers in America® in the categories of plaintiff personal injury, medical malpractice, and/or product liability litigation.\n\nAll of our attorneys have been named as Connecticut Super Lawyers® or Connecticut Risings Stars for 2023.\n\nAdditionally, John J. Houlihan, Jr. has been named by Super Lawyers® as a Top 10 Attorney in Connecticut.\n\nThe National Law Journal recently named the Hartford personal injury law firm of RisCassi & Davis one of the top 50 trial law firms in the United States… the only law firm in Connecticut to receive that honor.\n\nRisCassi & Davis, P.C., is proud that seven attorneys in our firm have been certified as Civil Trial Advocates by the National Board of Trial Advocacy. James D. Bartolini, John J. Houlihan, Jr., Eugene K. Swain, David W. Cooney, Michael C. Jainchill, Andrew S. Groher, and Paul M. Iannaccone have all achieved this distinction, awarded after compiling extensive trial experience and passing a written examination. To be eligible even to take the test for this certification, you must first have been lead counsel in at least 15 trials to verdict or judgment and lead counsel in 40 contested matters involving the taking of evidence, among other requirements.\n\nJames D. Bartolini, David W. Cooney, William R. Davis, Andrew S. Groher, John J. Houlihan, Jr., Michael C. Jainchill, and Eugene K. Swain have all been named Trial Advocates by ABOTA. ABOTA is an organization that requires its members to be responsible for elevating the standards of integrity, honor, ethics, civility, and courtesy in the legal profession.\n\nWilliam R. Davis was selected as the first recipient of the “Lifetime Achievement in Litigation Award” from the Connecticut Law Tribune. For decades, Bill has been a leader of the Bar, a mentor to countless lawyers, and one of the pre-eminent trial lawyers in the State of Connecticut."
