        "text": "Lucky Bag\n\nFrom the 1922 Lucky Bag:\n\nLoss\n\nWilliam was lost on March 5, 1934 when the Berliner-Joyce XFJ-1 biplane he was piloting crashed into the James River (Virginia). The enlisted man aboard was also killed.\n\nOther Information\n\nFrom researcher Kathy Franz:\n\nWilliam was captain of the football and basketball team in high school. He attended Iowa State college at Ames for a short time where he was a member of Phi Delta Theta.\n\nOn October 23, 1926, William married Isabelle (Moore) Morrisette at the Sacred Heart parish house in Norfolk, Virginia. His best man was Lieut. Comdr. John S. Farnsworth (‘15.) Her father Hugh was a navy yard inspector and Chief Master at Arms. He died in 1938.\n\nWilliam’s body was found in the James River on May 29, 1934, almost three months after the accident. Captain C. C. Skeeter who operated a local launch came across the body and brought it to the pier. The Navy took it to the naval operating base.\n\nPer the Daily News, Newport News, May 29, 1934: “Lieutenant Davis leaped from the plane in his parachute when it began a nose-dive into the river, but sank with his parachute before help could reach him. It was Captain Skeeter who dragged for the ill-fated seaplane and it was his anchor which caught the plane and led navy salvage men to its recovery and that of Matt Marshall’s body which was still in the cockpit. … [William’s] Identification was made by the flier’s costume and parachute harness, decomposition having made the features unrecognizable. The body was still encased in the heavy flying suit worn to protect the pilot from the cold of the upper atmosphere. The parachute still trailed from the harness of heavy cotton straps which bound it around the aviator’s waist and shoulders. The helmet still was on the head. … When Lieutenant Davis leaped in his parachute the C. & O. tug Eureka attempted to rescue him, but he was drawn with his parachute beneath the surface before the craft could reach the spot.”\n\nWilliam’s father Jenkin was a chiropractor, and his mother was Annie Lee Phillips. Jenkin died in 1939, and Annie Lee in 1955. They are both buried in Forest Cemetery in Oskaloosa.\n\nWilliam was survived by his widow, a stepson Hubert Shelton Morrisette, age 11, his parents and his sister Anna Irene (Mrs. Adair.)\n\nHe earned his wings as naval aviator #3242 in 1924.\n\nWilliam is buried in Arlington National Cemetery.\n\nPhotographs\n\nFrom The Des Moines Register on March 6, 1934\n\nNavy Directories & Officer Registers\n\nThe \"Register of Commissioned and Warrant Officers of the United States Navy and Marine Corps\" was published annually from 1815 through at least the 1970s; it provided rank, command or station, and occasionally billet until the beginning of World War II when command/station was no longer included. Scanned copies were reviewed and data entered from the mid-1840s through 1922, when more-frequent Navy Directories were available.\n\nThe Navy Directory was a publication that provided information on the command, billet, and rank of every active and retired naval officer. Single editions have been found online from January 1915 and March 1918, and then from three to six editions per year from 1923 through 1940; the final edition is from April 1941.\n\nThe entries in both series of documents are sometimes cryptic and confusing. They are often inconsistent, even within an edition, with the name of commands; this is especially true for aviation squadrons in the 1920s and early 1930s.\n\nAlumni listed at the same command may or may not have had significant interactions; they could have shared a stateroom or workspace, stood many hours of watch together… or, especially at the larger commands, they might not have known each other at all. The information provides the opportunity to draw connections that are otherwise invisible, though, and gives a fuller view of the professional experiences of these alumni in Memorial Hall."
