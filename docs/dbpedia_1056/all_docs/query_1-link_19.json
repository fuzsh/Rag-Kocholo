        "text": "Benjamin O. Davis, Sr. (born July 1, 1877 or May 28, 1880, Washington, D.C., U.S.—died November 26, 1970, North Chicago, Illinois) became, in 1940, the first Black general in any branch of the U.S. military.\n\nCiting census and other records, historian Marvin E. Fletcher has asserted that Davis was born on May 28, 1880. Davis’s military records and his gravestone at Arlington National Cemetery show July 1, 1877, the birth date that Davis used when he enlisted in the U.S. Army in 1898. He served as a volunteer in the Spanish-American War, and he then reenlisted as a private in the 9th Cavalry, one of the U.S. Army’s segregated Buffalo Soldier regiments. He rose to sergeant major within two years and earned a commission as a second lieutenant in 1901.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nPop Quiz: 17 Things to Know About World War II\n\nIn the next four decades Davis served in Liberia and the Philippines and taught military science at Tuskegee University and Wilberforce University. All of his duty assignments were designed to avoid a situation in which Davis might be put in command of white troops or officers. He rose slowly through the ranks, becoming the first Black colonel in the U.S. Army in 1930. In 1940 Davis was promoted to brigadier general by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. (Roosevelt later issued two executive orders—8802 in 1941 and 9981 in 1948—that ended racial discrimination in the U.S. defense industry and armed forces.)\n\nAfter commanding the 2nd Cavalry Division in 1941, Davis was assigned to the office of the inspector general of the army. During World War II he headed a special unit charged with safeguarding the status and morale of Black soldiers in the army, and he served in the European theater as a special adviser on race relations.\n\nDavis retired in 1948 after 50 years of service."
