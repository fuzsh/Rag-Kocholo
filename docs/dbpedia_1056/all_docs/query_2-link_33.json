Although he might have been rescued, Private Bodsworth persisted in remaining in the boat with the Sister, and, after she had fallen overboard and been hauled back again, he finally succeeded in placing a line round her body, by means of which she was hauled on board the \"Druid.\" Very considerable risk was incurred by Private Bodsworth in rendering the service on account of the rough sea which prevailed at the time.\n\n______\n\nAdmiralty, 7th January, 1918.\n\nHis Majesty the KING (is) pleased to confer the Royal Naval Reserve Officers' Decoration upon the following; Officers:\n\nCommander Charles A.

The following is an account of the services in respect of which the Decoration has been conferred:\n\nIn April, 1917, the steamship in which Mr. Furneaux was serving was torpedoed by the enemy, and a Lascar, who was on the spot where certain deck plates had buckled and broken, had his legs so firmly caught between the plates that he would have gone down with the ship. Mr. Furneaux, however, went to the man's assistance and managed to get one leg out, but the other was nearly severed through above the knee. Finding it impossible to pull this leg out, Mr. Furneaux amputated it with an ordinary clasp knife and then carried the man to a boat. When in the boat he dressed the wound as well as possible, and gave the life belt he was wearing to the wounded man. Mr. Furneaux also rendered first aid in the boat to another Lascar who was badly scalded. Mr. Furneaux was in imminent danger of losing his life in rendering the service.\n\n30498 - 25 JANUARY 1918\n\nWar Office, 28th January, 1918.\n\nHis Majesty the KING (is) pleased to approve of the award of the Military Medal for bravery in the Field to the undermentioned Non-Commissioned Officers and Men (including):\n\nTZ/5191 P./O.

The following is the account of the services in respect of which the decoration has been conferred:\n\nOn the 8th November, 1916, a series of fires and explosions occurred at Bakaritsa, Port of Archangel. After the merchant ships had been got away from the wharves, cries and moans were heard from the direction of a 100-ton floating crane moored between the S.S. \"Earl of Forfar\" and the quay. The \"Earl of Forfar\" was on fire fore and aft, and it was obvious that any attempt to save life must be accompanied by the greatest risk, the ship having explosives on board and the quay abreast it burning furiously with intermittent explosions from small arm ammunition. Lieutenant-Commander MacMahon, without a moment's hesitation, volunteered to carry out rescue work, although other rescue parties considered that they had already done all that was humanly possible. In order to reach the floating crane it was necessary to cross the \"Earl of Forfar,\" the after part of which had blown up, whilst the forepart was on fire and the forecastle was a mass of smouldering debris. Hearing moans from under the debris of the forecastle, Lieutenant-Commander MacMahon, with the aid of the crew of a tug, cleared away the wreckage and discovered the mate, with one arm, one leg, and collar-bone fractured. This man was extricated and passed into the tug. Lieutenant-Commander MacMahon then proceeded on to the floating crane by means of a single plank and rescued from beneath the debris of the crane the carpenter of the \"Earl of Forfar\" and two Russian subjects, part of the crane's crew.\n\n30514 - 5 FEBRUARY 1918\n\nWar Office, 7th February, 1918.\n\nHis Majesty the KING (is) pleased to approve of the undermentioned rewards for distinguished services rendered in connection with Military Operations in Mesopotamia.

Francis Joint Hulland, R.N.R. 1522S.A.\n\nIn recognition of their services in minesweeping operations abroad during the period June, 1916, to June, 1917.\n\nLieut. James Pittendrigh, R.N.R. In recognition of gallant conduct and good seamanship under fire. Whilst he was on patrol in H.M. Trawler \"Restrivo\" in the Kos Channel, on the 25th October, 1917, fire was opened on him from the shore. At the same time a caique, flying the Italian flag, was seen between the trawler and the shore, dismasted and drifting towards the enemy coast. Though a strong southerly wind was blowing and the sea was rough, Lieut. Pittendrigh closed the caique, took her in tow, and brought her into safety. The enemy meantime maintained a hot fire from a 4-inch gun, to which the trawler, owing to her inferior armament, was unable to make an effective reply.\n\nTo receive the Distinguished Service Medal.\n\nLdg.

Frederick William Bowhill, R.N. In recognition of his invaluable services as Comdg. Officer of the R.N.A.S., employed in connection with military operations in East Africa. It is due to his experience and unceasing labour that his small unit of the R.N.A.S. has been of such assistance to the military operations. He has instilled a high sense of discipline into those under his orders.\n\nTo receive the Distinguished Service Cross.\n\nFlt.-Cdr. Wilfred Henry Dunn, R.N.A.S. In recognition of his services whilst employed in connection with military operations in East Africa. He did splendid work during the operations in the Lindi area, and carried out valuable bombing and reconnaissance flights.\n\nFlt.-Cdr. Guy William Price, R.N.A.S. In recognition of the gallantry and determination displayed by him in leading offensive patrols, which have constantly engaged and driven away enemy aircraft. On the 2nd January, 1918, he observed seven Albatross scouts, and crossing the lines in the clouds, he attacked one, which fell vertically, bursting into flames, and crashed to the ground. He has on several other occasions driven enemy aircraft down out of control.\n\nFlt.-Lieut. (now Flt.-Cdr.) Alan Murray Waistell, R.N.A.S. For the determination and pluck shown by him in carrying out a bombing raid on Chanak on the night of the 17th October, 1917. In spite of the fact that there was no moon and that the weather conditions were so adverse that other pilots were unable to reach the objective, he succeeded in reaching Chanak and dropping his bombs. On the return journey he hit the side of a mountain, being unable to see it on account of the darkness, the machine catching fire on crashing. Although severely injured about the face and knee, he was able to climb out of the machine, and eventually reached the aerodrome, having ridden ten miles over extremely rough country with a badly lacerated knee.\n\nFlt.-Lieut. (Act. Flt.-Cdr.) Norman Miers Macgregor, R.N.A.S. In recognition of his skill and courage in aerial combats. On the 12th December, 1917, whilst leading his flight on an offensive sweep, he encountered a body of six Albatross scouts at 14,000 feet. In the general fight which ensued he attacked a scout which was engaging one of our machines and drove it down out of control, and it was seen to crash.\n\nAct. Flt.-Cdr. Macgregor has destroyed several enemy machines and has led his flight with great dash and judgment.\n\nFlt.-Lieut. Rudolph Dawson Delamere, R.N.A.S. In recognition of the gallantry and devotion to duty shown by him in carrying out reconnaissance, bombing and photographic flights during the military operations in the Lindi (East Africa) area.\n\nFlt.-Lieut. Samuel Marcus Kinkead, R.N.A.S. In recognition of the conspicuous gallantry and skill displayed by him in the face of the enemy in aerial combats, notably on the following occasions: On the 24th October, 1917, he brought down an enemy machine, and immediately afterwards encountered and drove off a group of seven hostile aeroplanes. On the 4th December, 1917, he brought down an enemy two-seater machine completely out of control. By his skill and determination in attacking enemy machines he has always shown a fine example to other pilots.\n\nFlt.-Lieut. John Foster Chisholm, R.N.A.S. In recognition of his services on the 6th December, 1917, when he carried out a photographic reconnaissance in the vicinity of Zeebrugge, and for the great skill and determination with which he has carried out his duties at all times.\n\nLieut. Evelyn Cecil Walter Fitzherbert, R.N.V.R. In recognition of the valuable services performed by him as observer in the R.N.A.S. during the military operations in East Africa. His reports on the country, enemy positions, etc., and his photographs have been of the greatest assistance to the operations.\n\nFlt.-Sub-Lieut. Ronald McNeill Keirstead, R.N.A.S. In recognition of conspicuous gallantry in aerial combats. On the 24th September, 1917, he engaged single-handed four enemy aeroplanes, of which two were destroyed by him. On the 21st October, 1917, during an engagement between a British and a German formation, he attacked one of the enemy scouts and shot its port wings away from the rest of the machine. He then dived on to some enemy scouts which were attacking another of our machines and brought one of them down in a spinning nose dive.\n\nFlt. Sub-Lieut. William Lancelot Jordan, R.N.A.S. In recognition of the courage and initiative displayed by him in aerial combats. On the 13th July, 1917, in company with another pilot, he attacked an enemy two-seater machine. After bursts of fire from both of our machines, the enemy observer was seen to collapse in the cock-pit, and the enemy aircraft was last seen disappearing among some houses. On the 6th December, 1917, whilst patrolling at 15,000 feet, he saw a two-seater enemy aircraft at 10,500 feet, and dived on him, firing about thirty rounds. After falling over to the left, enemy aircraft went down vertically. He has also been instrumental in bringing down other enemy machines.\n\nFlt. Sub-Lieut. Harold Day, R.N.A.S. In recognition of the skill and determination shown by him in aerial combats, in the course of which he has done much to stop enemy artillery machines from working. On the 6th January, 1918, he observed a new type enemy aeroplane. He immediately dived to attack, and after a short combat the enemy machine went down very steeply, and was seen to crash. On several other occasions he has brought down enemy machines out of control.\n\nTo receive the Distinguished Service Medal.\n\nC.P.O., 3rd Gr., Herbert Purssell Eustace, O.N. F2486.\n\nP.O.

(Halifax). For conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty.

Ships. Mr. Alfred William Newman, Acting Mate, R.N., who was on the upper deck, proceeded to the magazine as soon as he heard the alarm, and, seeing smoke issuing from a box of cordite, opened the lid and passed the cartridges on to the upper deck, where they were thrown overboard. One cartridge in the middle of the box was very hot, and smoke was issuing from the end. It is considered that, by his prompt and gallant action, Mr. Newman saved the magazine from blowing up and the loss of many lives.\n\n30564 - 5 MARCH 1918\n\nAdmiralty, 8th March, 1918.\n\nHonours for Services in Destroyer and Torpedo Boat Flotillas\n\nThe KING (is) pleased to approve of the award of the following honours, decorations and medals to Officers and Men for services in Destroyer and Torpedo Boat Flotillas during the period ending 31st December, 1917:\n\nTo be Companions of the Distinguished Service Order\n\nCapt.

Having satisfied himself that there was in fact no one in the car, he turned away to render assistance elsewhere, and at that moment one of the bombs exploded, a portion of it shattering Lieutenant Watson's right arm at the elbow. The arm had to be amputated almost immediately.\n\nAir Mechanic H. V. Robinson and Boy Mechanic E. E. Steere, on the occasion of an accident to one of His Majesty's airships which caused a fire to break out on board her, approached the burning airship without hesitation, extricated the pilot and two members of the crew, all of whom were seriously injured, and then unclipped the bombs from the burning car and carried them out of reach of the fire. As the bombs were surrounded by flames, and were so hot that they scorched the men's hands as they carried them, they must have expected the bombs to explode.\n\n30573 - 12 MARCH 1918\n\nWar Office, 13th March, 1918.\n\nHis Majesty the KING (is) pleased to approve of the award of the Military Medal for bravery in the Field to the undermentioned Non-commissioned Officers and Men:\n\nLZ/656 P./O.

(Commodore, 1st Class).\n\n______\n\nAdmiralty, 12th March, 1918.\n\nHis Majesty the KING (is) pleased to confer the Royal Naval Reserve Officers' Decoration upon the undermentioned Officers:\n\nLieut.-Cdr. Cecil Brooks, R.N.R.\n\nLieut.-Cdr. (actg. Cdr.) Reginald R. Harrison, R.N.R.\n\nLieut. Lionel D. Douglas, R.N.R.\n\nEngr. Lieut.-Cdr. William Relph, R.N.R.\n\nStaff Payr. John Mortished, R.N.R.\n\n30581 - 15 MARCH 1918\n\nAdmiralty, 16th March, 1918.\n\nHonours for Services in Action on the Occasion of the\n\nRaid into the Straits of Dover by Enemy Destroyers on the Night of the 14th-15th February, 1918\n\nThe KING (is) pleased to approve of the award of the following decorations and medals to the undermeationed Officers and men:\n\nTo receive the Distinguished Service Cross\n\nEngr. Lieut. John Abraham Kirkham, R.N.R. Displayed great courage and devotion to duty. His ship had been heavily shelled, was holed below water, and was settling down by the head. Engr. Lieut. Kirkham kept the pumps going as long as steam lasted, thus saving the vessel by keeping her afloat, until another vessel came to her assistance and towed her stern first into Dover harbour.\n\nSkpr. Henry Bennett, R.N.R., 1013S.A., H.M. Trawler \"James Pond\". Displayed the utmost courage and devotion to duty. Skpr. Bennett ably assisted Ch. Skpr. Berry in his efforts to save the vessel after she had been heavily shelled and set on fire. Attempts were made to put out the fire and to get up the ammunition from below, but both efforts failed, and finally the ship was abandoned. The boat was successfully launched in spite of the fact that the falls had been destroyed by the shelling. The crew got away in her, and succeeded in effecting a landing on the French coast, where they received every attention from the French authorities.\n\nSkpr. Samuel Alger Head, R.N.R., 1S08 W.S.A., H.M. Drifter \"Vera Creina.\" Displayed gallantry and presence of mind in keeping his ship afloat, when badly holed by two 4-inch shells, by plugging the holes with beds and blankets.\n\nSkpr. John Mair, R.N.R., 1323W.S.A., H.M. Drifter \"W. Elliott.\" Displayed great coolness and presence of mind when his ship was sunk with the loss of seven hands and he himself was injured.\n\nSkpr. John Turrell, R.N.R., 1126W.S.A., H.M. Drifter \"Golden Rule.\" When his ship was severely damaged and ten of his crew had been killed and three badly injured, he displayed great courage and energy in giving orders to the remaining three hands although severely injured himself\n\nTo receive a Bar to the Distinguished Service Cross.\n\nLieut. Alexander Duff Thomson, D.S.C., R.N.R. Displayed the greatest courage, coolness and devotion to duty. The vessel which he commanded was heavily shelled, and very considerable damage was done to her. The first salvo wrecked the bridge, the W.T. room, and Lieut. Thomson's cabin underneath the bridge, the Officer of the Watch being killed outright. Lieut. Thomson managed to get out of his cabin alive and made for the bridge. He maintained his coolness throughout, and after the action was over managed to get an S.O.S. signal through to Folkestone Pier, his W.T. having been put out of action. He then examined his vessel, and found she had been holed below water, and was settling down by the head. At 6.30 a.m. another vessel came to his assistance and towed his ship stern first into Dover Harbour.\n\nCh. Skpr. Alfred Edward Berry, D.S.C., R.N.R., 111S.A., H.M. Trawler \"James Pond.\" Displayed the utmost coolness and devotion to duty, and behaved in a most courageous manner. His vessel was heavily shelled and set on fire. His cabin was pierced by a shell which exploded and wrecked it, wounding Ch. Skpr. Berry in the legs and setting fire to the whole of the wheelhouse. He remained cool and collected throughout, immediately giving orders to all hands to lie down until the firing was over. He then made every effort to get the fires out, and although the hose had been blown to pieces, it was replaced under his directions. Both the attempt to put out the fires and to bring up the ammunition failed, and then Ch. Skpr. Berry gave orders to abandon ship. He refused to abandon his vessel, though offered assistance by a French T.B.D., until he was convinced she was doomed. It was found that the falls of the boat had been destroyed, but the boat was successfully man-handled and launched, and the crew got away in her, Chief Skipper Berry being the last to leave.\n\nTo receive the Conspicuous Gallantry Medal\n\nEngmn. James Ewing, R.N.R., O.N. 2637E.S., H.M. Drifter \"Violet May.\"\n\nEngmn. Alexander Noble, R.N.R., O.N. 2651E.S., H.M. Drifter \"Violet May.\"\n\nFor conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty. When their ship had been very severely handled by the enemy, and was on fire forward, and all the rest of the crew had been killed with two exceptions, and those so badly wounded that they could render little or no assistance, Engmn. Ewing and Noble cleared the wreckage of the boom from the small boat, got out the boat, put their wounded shipmates into it, and then took to the boat. Finding the ship did not sink, they returned to her, attacked the fire with buckets, and got it out, small arm ammunition in the wheelhouse exploding as they worked. They then got their injured ship- mates on board again and made them comfortable, afterwards burning flares of old clothes soaked in paraffin until picked up and towed in at 7 a.m. The Vice-Admiral, Dover Patrol, reports:\"The conduct of Noble and Ewing was altogether admirable. Their great gallantry and devotion to duty-and, I would add, their simple modesty- entitles them to very special consideration.\"\n\n2nd Hnd. George Bertie Rivett, R.N.R., O.N. 5727D.A., H.M. Drifter \"Kosmos.\" For conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty. He displayed great courage and presence of mind when, first, his own ship having sunk, he went overboard after the small boat which was adrift. Later, he put his lifebelt on a severely wounded engineman of another ship. Finally, he assisted in saving the life of Engmn. Wakerley when the latter became unconscious. He was in the water for over two hours.\n\nTo receive the Distinguished Service Medal\n\nDkhnd. George Miller Barnes, R.N.R., O.N. 17056D.A.\n\nDkhnd. Malcolm Beaton, R.N.R., O.N. 512S.D.\n\n2nd Hnd.

Cdr. Edwin Rowland Moon, D.S.O., R.N.A.S. In recognition of the resource and gallantry displayed by him in the following circumstances:\n\nOn the 6th January, 1917, whilst on a reconnaissance flight over the Rufiji Delta with Cdr. The Hon. Richard O. B. Bridgeman, D.S.O., R.N., as observer, he was obliged by engine trouble to descend in one of the creeks, where it became necessary to destroy the seaplane to avoid the possibility of its being captured. For three whole days the two officers wandered about the delta in their efforts to avoid capture and to rejoin their ship. During this time they had little or nothing to eat, and were continually obliged to swim across the creeks, the bush on the banks being impenetrable. On the morning of the 7th January they constructed"
