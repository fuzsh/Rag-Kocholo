He is a trusted advisor to his clients, including companies, nonprofits, research institutes and universities as well as primary and secondary schools. He provides a strategic approach to solving complex issues given the extensive knowledge he has gained over his 30 plus years of public service.\n\nIn late 2023, in recognition of his commitment to education and innovation, Governor Davis received the UC President’s Medal – the University of California’s highest honor, from the UC President Michael V. Drake, M.D. Governor Davis served on Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass’ transition team from December, 2022 through April, 2023. Governor Davis has been interviewed by numerous media publications – including The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, Los Angeles Times, Politico, NPR, CNN, Newsweek and Bloomberg – as a well-respected thought leader on California and federal politics.\n\nGovernor Davis was overwhelmingly elected the 37th governor of California in 1998, winning 58 percent of the vote. As Governor, he made education a top priority, signing legislation to strengthen California's K-12 system, increasing accountability in schools, and expanding access to higher education with a record number of scholarships and college loans. These reforms improved student achievement scores for six consecutive years.\n\nWhile presiding over California during an economic expansion, Governor Davis made record investments in infrastructure, created four Centers of Science and Innovation on UC campuses, and expanded state health insurance for an additional one million children. He also was the first Governor in the nation to authorize stem cell research.

He also created the first Greenhouse Gas Monitoring Registry, and was the first to establish the nation's most ambitious commitment to renewable energy by creating the statewide Renewables Portfolio Standard. Despite a wave of Republican victories across the nation in 2002, Governor Davis was re-elected to a second term.\n\nTo view an archive of his gubernatorial accomplishments, please visit the Governor Gray Davis’ Digital Library Web site at www.gray-davis.com.\n\nIn 2020, Governor Davis served on Governor Newsom’s Economic Task Force for Re-Opening the Economy.

Governor Schwarzenegger and the USC Schwarzenegger Institute recently honored Governor Davis by celebrating the 20th anniversary of his signing of AB 1493, landmark environmental legislation that led to improved fuel economy standards in cars and passenger trucks nationally.\n\nAdditionally, Governor Davis served as a member of the bi-partisan Think Long Committee along with Governors Brown and Schwarzenegger. He also speaks before a number of civic and government organizations, on important issues of the day.
