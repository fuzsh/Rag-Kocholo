The term singular does not necessarily mean without precedent, but rather that the activity be specific as distinguished from general service (such as membership on committees).\n\nProcedure for Recommendation\n\nNominations for this award should be submitted, along with documentation, to the Chairman of the Honors and Awards Committee at Association Headquarters. The recommendations of the Committee will be submitted to the Advisory Council which will submit its selection to the Executive Committee for final action.\n\nDescription of Award\n\nThis award is a walnut plaque with the AAPG emblem in brass and a brass plate bearing the recipientâ€™s name, the date, and citation.\n\nHistory\n\nThis award was established by Executive Committee action in 1971.\n\nFunding\n\nThe AAPG provides funding for the Distinguished Service Award."
