Adams, (ASN: RA-15423301)United States Army, for extraordinary heroism in connection with military operations against an armed enemy of the United Nations while serving with Company F, 2d Battalion, 35th Infantry Regiment, 25th Infantry Division. Corporal Adams distinguished himself by extraordinary heroism in action against enemy aggressor forces when his battalion launched an attack near Chinju, Korea, on 25 September 1950. On that date, Company F, on the left flank of the battalion, was nearing its objective when it was pinned down by heavy enemy automatic-weapons and small-arms fire. Corporal Adams, exposing himself to hostile fire, went to an advantageous position, set up his machine-gun, and delivered effective fire on the enemy until his ammunition was exhausted. Leaving his position, he ran across approximately forty yards of fire-swept terrain to help a wounded man to safety, and then returned to the dangerous area and evacuated another wounded comrade. When he observed that a platoon had launched an assault on the next ridge, Corporal Adams obtained ammunition, retrieved his machine-gun and, placing it in a new position on the forward slope of a hill, delivered such accurate and devastating fire on the enemy that the assaulting platoon was able to overrun and destroy them. The extraordinary heroism of Corporal Adams reflects great credit upon himself and is in keeping with the highest traditions of the military service.\n\nAgnew, Richard S.\n\nHeadquarters, Eighth U.S. Army\n\nGeneral Orders No. 3 - January 1, 1954\n\nThe President of the United States of America, under the provisions of the Act of Congress approved July 9, 1918, takes pleasure in presenting the Distinguished Service Cross to First Lieutenant (Infantry) Richard S. Agnew (ASN: 0-1925377), United States Army, for extraordinary heroism in connection with military operations against an armed enemy of the United Nations while serving with Company F, 2d Battalion, 223d Infantry Regiment, 40th Infantry Division. First Lieutenant Agnew distinguished himself by extraordinary heroism in action against enemy aggressor forces in the vicinity of Mundung-ni, Korea, on 19 July 1953. On that date, Lieutenant Agnew was serving as the leader of a combat patrol operating far ahead of the United Nations main line of resistance when he and the assistant patrol leader fell from a cliff. Although his ankle was painfully injured and he was in enemy territory, Lieutenant Agnew ordered the patrol to return to friendly lines and establish plans to rejoin allied forces the following evening. The following night, Lieutenant Agnew and his comrade scaled the cliff and proceeded toward United Nations territory. When challenged by an enemy soldier, Lieutenant Agnew ignored his weakened condition, engaged him in hand to hand combat and killed him with his own weapon. Hearing other enemy forces advancing, Lieutenant Agnew then pulled the pin on his remaining hand grenade and tied it to his hand before falling to the ground in exhaustion. He was later found in a semi-conscious condition by a United Nations patrol. The extraordinary heroism exhibited by Lieutenant Agnew on this occasion reflects great credit on himself and is in keeping with the finest traditions of the military services.\n\nAlexander, John Jr.\n\nHeadquarters, Eighth U.S. Army\n\nGeneral Orders No. 85 - February 10, 1952\n\nThe President of the United States of America, under the provisions of the Act of Congress approved July 9, 1918, takes pleasure in presenting the Distinguished Service Cross to Sergeant John Alexander Jr. (ASN: US-53016549), United States Army, for extraordinary heroism in connection with military operations against an armed enemy of the United Nations while serving as a Squad Leader of an Infantry Company of the 27th Infantry Regiment, 25th Infantry Division. Sergeant Alexander distinguished himself by extraordinary heroism in action against enemy aggressor forces in the vicinity of Hagaenyong, Korea, on 12 September 1951. On that date, Sergeant Alexander's men comprised the lead squad in an assault launched by his company against a numerically superior hostile force occupying heavily fortified hill emplacements. As the friendly troops advanced on the objective, they were subjected to a barrage of grenades and a heavy volume of small-arms and automatic weapons fire from the enemy positions. Locating the hostile emplacement from which most of the fire originated, Sergeant Alexander led his men in repeated assaults against it, but each time they were hurled back because of the heavy fire. Realizing that this men would be annihilated if the position was not neutralized, Sergeant Alexander left his position and, without regard for his personal safety, single-handedly charged the enemy strongpoint. Although the entire firepower of the hostile force was being concentrated on him, he steadfastly moved forward, alternately hurling grenades and firing his rifle. As he neared the position, an enemy grenade bounced form his helmet and exploded at his feet, destroying his weapon and knocking him to the ground. Undaunted, he jumped to his feet and, even though he was without a weapon, resumed his assault. Reaching the hostile position, he leaped inside and, wrenching a machine-gun from one of the enemy soldier, he killed all of the occupants of the entrenchment. Then, signaling his men to move forward, he led them in an assault which drove the hostile force from the hill with heavy casualties.\n\nAllen, Charlie E. (posthumous)\n\nHeadquarters, Eighth U.S. Army\n\nGeneral Orders No. 227 - May 1, 1952\n\nThe President of the United States of America, under the provisions of the Act of Congress approved July 9, 1918, takes pride in presenting the Distinguished Service Cross (Posthumously) to Private First Class Charlie E. Allen (ASN: US-53061833), United States Army, for extraordinary heroism in connection with military operations against an armed enemy of the United Nations while serving with an Infantry Company of the 7th Infantry Regiment, 3d Infantry Division. Private First Class Allen distinguished himself by extraordinary heroism in action against enemy aggressor forces in the vicinity of Chorwon, Korea, on the morning of 4 October 1951. On that date, the company of which Private Allen was a member was occupying a strategic hill when it was brought under fire by hostile troops emplaced on adjacent ridges. This harassing fire threatened to make the friendly positions untenable and squads were sent to attack and eliminate the enemy emplacements. As Private Allen and his comrades assaulted one of the ridges, they were subjected to a heavy volume of small-arms and automatic-weapons fire from the enemy positions, effectively pinning them down. In the initial burst of fire, Private Allen observed one of his comrades fall wounded on exposed terrain. Without regard for his personal safety, he hastened to the man's side in an effort to render aid. Upon reaching the stricken soldier, Private Allen attempted to evacuate him but the hostile troops threw a large number of grenades at the position occupied by the two men. As the grenades began to explode all about him, Private Allen, thinking only of the safety of his comrade, dropped to the ground and courageously shielded the man's body with his own. His selfless action saved the life of the wounded soldier, but it cost Private Allen his own for he was mortally wounded by grenade fragments.\n\nAllen, John P. (posthumous)\n\nHeadquarters, Eighth U.S. Army\n\nGeneral Orders No. 64 - February 10, 1951\n\nThe President of the United States of America, under the provisions of the Act of Congress approved July 9, 1918, takes pride in presenting the Distinguished Service Cross (Posthumously) to Sergeant John P. Allen (ASN: RA-35016145), United States Army, for extraordinary heroism in connection with military operations against an armed enemy of the United Nations while serving with Company G, 2d Battalion, 27th Infantry Regiment, 25th Infantry Division. Sergeant Allen distinguished himself by extraordinary heroism in action against enemy aggressor forces Ghingdon-ni, Korea, on 15 September 1950. When Company G was ordered to attack an enemy position, Sergeant Allen's platoon became heavily engaged, Sergeant Allen was ordered to move his machine-gun squad to a ridge in order to better support the attack. When he reached the ridge line and began setting up his machine-gun to support the attacking elements, an enemy soldier threw a grenade in the middle of the squad. With complete disregard for his own life, Sergeant Allen threw his body over the grenade in order to protect his men; however, the grenade failed to explode. Sergeant Allen's squad was so inspired by this action that they delivered the seriously needed supporting fire with great ferocity, aiding the attacking elements to take the objective and accomplish their mission. Sergeant Allen's gallant offer to sacrifice his life and his dauntless leadership were an inspiration to all men who witnessed the action.\n\nAlmond, Edward Mallory (1st)\n\nGeneral Headquarters Far East Command\n\nGeneral Orders No. 43 - 23 October 1950\n\nThe President of the United States of America, under the provisions of the Act of Congress approved July 9, 1918, takes pleasure in presenting the Distinguished Service Cross to Major General Edward M. Almond (ASN: 0-466), United States Army, for extraordinary heroism in connection with military operations against an armed enemy of the United Nations while serving as Commanding General of X Corps. Major General Almond distinguished himself by extraordinary heroism in action against enemy aggressor forces in the Republic of Korea during the period from 15 to 25 September 1950. During the seizure of Inchon, General Almond personally visited front line units, coordinated tactical efforts, and by his own fearless example aided them in seizing assigned objectives. Following the fall of Inchon, General Almond personally led his troops in their rapid drive through enemy-held territory to seize Seoul, and to speed the disintegration of the enemy forces. During the assault of the Han River, he moved to a forward position well beyond the line of friendly forces to observe and control the river crossing. Despite heavy enemy mortar fire directed at him, General Almond remained to supervise the air and artillery support which was protecting the first units of the Seventh Infantry Division crossing the river. Disregarding enemy mine fields and sniper fire, he proceeded to the crossing site to direct fire of amphibious tanks neutralizing enemy opposition which was impeding our crossing. By his inspirational leadership, his complete indifference to danger, and personal control of the battlefield, General Almond quickly concluded tactical operations which destroyed the enemy forces in the X Corps zone of action and saved countless lives in the forces under his command.\n\nAlmond, Edward Mallory (2nd citation) - Oak Leaf Cluster\n\nHeadquarters, Eighth U.S. Army\n\nGeneral Orders No. 362 - May 28, 1951\n\nThe President of the United States of America, under the provisions of the Act of Congress approved July 9, 1918, takes pleasure in presenting a Bronze Oak Leaf Cluster in lieu of a Second Award of the Distinguished Service Cross to Lieutenant General Edward M. Almond (ASN: 0-466), United States Army, for extraordinary heroism in connection with military operations against an armed enemy of the United Nations while serving as Commanding General, X Corps. Lieutenant General Almond distinguished himself by extraordinary heroism in action against enemy aggressor forces during the massive offensive by three known Communist Armies against the X Corps, during the period from 16 through 25 May 1951. General Almonde personally directed the historic defense which contained this attack and resulted in crushing losses in enemy manpower and materiel. During this period General Almond distinguished himself by countless acts of individual heroism as well as providing the inspiration, leadership and tactical skill which contributed materially the success of this operation. On 19 May 1951, while reconnoitering enemy positions in a light aircraft, he observed 250 enemy at a point forward of a friendly tank patrol. General Almond landed his plane by the tank column and sent the tank platoon leader in his aide's plane to observe the enemy group. While with the tank column the enemy set up a machine gun within 500 yards of his position. Without regard for hostile fire from this gun, he directed tank fire which silenced the weapon. The tank platoon went on to destroy the 250 enemy. On 21 May 1951, General Almond made an aerial reconnaissance before a tank column operating at Soksa-ri, Korea. While flying low over this area, General Almond received intense automatic-weapons fire. Again, without regard for personal safety, he located these weapons and personally directed their destruction. Again on 25 May 1951, he made four flights in an unarmed light plane through the enemy-held mountain pass between Hangye and the Umyang bridgehead on the Seyang River. Despite intense enemy small-arms and friendly artillery fire, he returned time and again to insure proper command and liaison between friendly forces operating at both ends of the pass. These specific acts, as well as countless visits to forward-most command posts, provided the inspiration and forceful leadership essential at this critical time.\n\nAnderson, Alfred Julius\n\nHeadquarters, Far East Command\n\nGeneral Orders No. 177 - July 7, 1951\n\nThe President of the United States of America, under the provisions of the Act of Congress approved July 9, 1918, takes pleasure in presenting the Distinguished Service Cross to First Lieutenant (Infantry) Alfred Julius Anderson (ASN: 0-59289), United States Army, for extraordinary heroism in connection with military operations against an armed enemy of the United Nations while serving with Company B, 1st Battalion, 31st Infantry Regiment, 7th Infantry Division. First Lieutenant Anderson distinguished himself by extraordinary heroism in action against enemy aggressor forces near Koto-ri, in the vicinity of the Changjin (Chosin) Reservoir in North Korea on 29 and 30 November 1950. On 29 November 1950, at approximately 0630 hours, Lieutenant Anderson's company, moving in motor convoy to join other units of the regiment near the Chosin Reservoir, was ambushed by a ruthless, hostile force, overwhelmingly superior in number. In the ensuing action, the column was divided in two, causing disorder among the troops, and Lieutenant Anderson immediately regrouped all available men and readied a defensive perimeter to meet the enemy onslaught. Armed only with a pistol, he constantly braved intense hostile fire as he moved calmly among the men, bolstering morale and securing each position. Lieutenant Anderson's skillful deployment of his forces enabled the unit to repulse repeated attacks throughout the bitter cold night; and, on two occasions, he closed in hand-to-hand combat with fanatical enemy soldiers, who had infiltrated the outer line of resistance, and succeeded in killing them with his pistol while deflecting their weapons with his other hand. Upon orders to withdraw at 0600 on 30 November 1950, Lieutenant Anderson organized and successfully led a retrograde action through heavy enemy concentrations and reached friendly forces. Lieutenant Anderson's inspirational leadership, sustained courage and unwavering devotion to duty reflect utmost credit on himself and the honored traditions of military service.\n\nAnderson, Clarence Leroy\n\nHeadquarters, Eighth U.S. Army\n\nGeneral Orders No. 256 - May 1, 1951\n\nThe President of the United States of America, under the provisions of the Act of Congress approved July 9, 1918, takes pleasure in presenting the Distinguished Service Cross to Captain (Medical Corps) Clarence Leroy Anderson (ASN: 0-61069), United States Army, for extraordinary heroism in connection with military operations against an armed enemy of the United Nations while serving as a Medical Officer attached to the 3d Battalion, 8th Cavalry Regiment (Infantry), 1st Cavalry Division. Captain Anderson distinguished himself by extraordinary heroism in action against enemy aggressor forces near Unsan, Korea, on 1 and 2 November 1950. On the afternoon of 1 November 1950, and continuing through the following thirty-six hours, the regiment was subjected to a relentless, fanatical attack by the enemy. At approximately 0100 hours, the enemy penetrated the lines and the 3d Battalion was ordered to cover the withdrawal of the remaining regimental units. When the enemy mounted a strong attack against the battalion, Captain Anderson, with complete disregard for his personal safety, repeatedly exposed himself to the intense enemy fire in order to administer medical attention to the wounded. At approximately 0200 hours, the battalion was ordered to begin its withdrawal. Fully realizing the hazards involved, Captain Anderson voluntarily remained behind as the battalion withdrew in order to give medical assistance to wounded personnel. Captain Anderson's gallant decision to remain with his wounded comrades reflects utmost credit on himself and the medical profession.\n\nAnderson, Clyde T. (posthumous)\n\nHeadquarters, Eighth U.S. Army\n\nGeneral Orders No. 903 - November 16, 1951\n\nThe President of the United States of America, under the provisions of the Act of Congress approved July 9, 1918, takes pride in presenting the Distinguished Service Cross (Posthumously) to Private First Class Clyde T. Anderson (ASN: RA-38070559), United States Army, for extraordinary heroism in connection with military operations against an armed enemy of the United Nations while serving with Company E, 2d Battalion, 38th Infantry Regiment, 2d Infantry Division. Private First Class Anderson distinguished himself by extraordinary heroism in action against enemy aggressor forces in the vicinity of Inje, Korea, on 29 May 1951. On that date, Private Anderson was traveling in a convoy when it was ambushed by a numerically superior hostile force. Subjected to a heavy volume of enemy small-arms and automatic-weapons fire, most of the friendly troops scattered and attempted to fight their way through the surrounding enemy. Private Anderson, however, remained by his vehicle, fighting fiercely and courageously. The numerical superiority of the attacking enemy force made it obvious that Private Anderson faced certain death if he remained in his position and yet, even with this knowledge, he closed with the enemy in hand-to-hand combat. Although painfully wounded, he met each attack with courage and determination, and in the final hostile assault he killed four of the enemy with his bayonet before he fell, mortally wounded. His gallant stand against overwhelming odds enabled his inspired comrades to reorganize and counterattack, successfully repulsing the hostile force.\n\nAnderson, Richard V.\n\nHeadquarters, Eighth U.S. Army\n\nGeneral Orders No. 88 - February 10, 1952\n\nThe President of the United States of America, under the provisions of the Act of Congress approved July 9, 1918, takes pleasure in presenting the Distinguished Service Cross to Sergeant First Class Richard V. Anderson (ASN: RA-26242415), United States Army, for extraordinary heroism in connection with military operations against an armed enemy of the United Nations while serving with 70th Medium Tank Battalion, 24th Infantry Division. Sergeant First Class Anderson distinguished himself by extraordinary heroism in action against enemy aggressor forces in the vicinity of Chonjamal, Korea, on 29 October 1951. On that date, as United Nations units prepared to launch an assault against a strong hostile force, the tank section, of which Sergeant Anderson was a member, was ordered to proceed to the rear of the enemy entrenchments in order to support a friendly force which was about to engage in a flanking attack. With only one route of approach open to them, the friendly tanks moved boldly toward the objective but they were soon stopped by a wide minefield which was being continually raked by enemy automatic weapons fire. Knowing that the friendly attack would fail without the planned support of the tanks, Sergeant Anderson fearlessly dismounted from his vehicle and, with the help of two comrades, began clearing a path through the field by digging up the mines, one by one. As he moved with caution across the hazardous terrain, he directed the fire of the tanks behind him against the hostile emplacement, but still the enemy fire continued to hit all about him. With the field cleared and thirty-five of the enemy lying dead, through his skillful fire direction, Sergeant Anderson climbed into his tank once more and led the section to a strategic ridge from which effective fire was placed on the hostile force occupying the hill. So devastating was the fire he directed in support of the friendly troops that the enemy soldiers attacked the tanks repeatedly in a frantic effort to silence them. Eventually, the desperate fire of the foe caused Sergeant Anderson's tank to burst in flames. Although seriously wounded by enemy small-arms fire and shell fragments, he left the tank and extinguished the blaze. Then, refusing medical attention, he directed the section to a new position from which they continued their deadly accurate fire. Only when his was assured that the objective had been secured, did he allow himself to be evacuated for treatment.\n\nAoyagi, Toshio\n\nHeadquarters, Eighth U.S. Army\n\nGeneral Orders No. 243 - May 9, 1952\n\nThe President of the United States of America, under the provisions of the Act of Congress approved July 9, 1918, takes pleasure in presenting the Distinguished Service Cross to Second Lieutenant (Infantry) Toshio Aoyagi (ASN: 0-2263324), United States Army, for extraordinary heroism in connection with military operations against an armed enemy of the United Nations while serving as Platoon Leader with an Infantry Company of the 7th Infantry Regiment, 3d Infantry Division. Second Lieutenant Aoyagi distinguished himself by extraordinary heroism in action against enemy aggressor forces in the vicinity of Chungae-ri, Korea, on 4 October 1951. On that date, Lieutenant Aoyagi was instructed to lead his men in an attack against a well-entrenched hostile force occupying a strategic slope. After advancing through light resistance to within thirty yards of the enemy main line of defense, the friendly troops were suddenly subjected to a heavy volume of small-arms and automatic weapons fire which pinned them down. In the initial phase of this attack, Lieutenant Aoyagi's radio was shot from his hands, and having no communication with the remainder of the friendly force, he was forced to act independently. First, he attempted to direct his men in outmaneuvering the hostile positions but they were unable to coordinate their actions because of the intense hostile fire. Realizing that the attack would fail unless the key enemy emplacements were destroyed, Lieutenant Aoyagi gathered extra grenades and magazines for his carbine and moved forward alone after ordering his men to fire as rapidly as possible at the enemy. Although the friendly troops were unable to gain fire superiority over the hostile force, Lieutenant Aoyagi, without regard for his personal safety, charged forward in a bold, single-handed attack. The three enemy positions that were the key to the hostile defenses were grouped closely together and he advanced directly into the heavy fire being concentrated on him by all three of them. Reaching the first, he silenced it with a burst from his carbine. The second, he neutralized with well-aimed grenades. Between these two emplacements, there ran a trench which led to the third and, without hesitation, Lieutenant Aoyagi leaped into it and continued his assault. One of the hostile soldiers, in desperation, reached around a corner in the trench without exposing himself and fired a burst from his automatic weapon. The fire hit Lieutenant Aoyagi's carbine and rendered it useless and also seriously wounded him in the abdomen. Undaunted, he destroyed the position with grenades. His intrepid actions forced a breach in the enemy line and the friendly troops rushed forward and secured their objective. Then, despite intense pain, he deployed his men in defensive positions in anticipation of an enemy counterattack. Only when he was sure that they were adequately prepared did he allow himself to be evacuated for medical treatment. Lieutenant Aoyagi was from Hawaii.\n\nArthur, Donald J.\n\nHeadquarters, Eighth U.S. Army\n\nGeneral Orders No. 127 - March 5, 1952\n\nThe President of the United States of America, under the provisions of the Act of Congress approved July 9, 1918, takes pleasure in presenting the Distinguished Service Cross to Captain (Infantry) Donald J. Arthur (ASN: 0-1331132), United States Army, for extraordinary heroism in connection with military operations against an armed enemy of the United Nations while Commanding an Infantry Company of the 15th Infantry Regiment, 3d Infantry Division. Captain Arthur distinguished himself by extraordinary heroism in action against enemy aggressor forces in the vicinity of Chorwon, Korea, on 3 October 1951. On that date, Captain Arthur led his men in an attack against a large hostile force occupying a strategic hill. Two other friendly companies had previously attacked the enemy positions only to be hurled back with heavy casualties. As his men struggled to advance against the tremendous volume of enemy fire, Captain ARTHUR realized that the only means of wresting the hill from the enemy was a rapid and concentrated attack by his men, directly up the slope. Moving from man to man, he instructed them to fix bayonets and prepare for a frontal assault. When he gave the order to charge, Captain Arthur observed that his men were reluctant to face the heavy enemy fire and so, with utter disregard for his personal safety, he stood before them, fully exposed to intense small-arms and automatic weapons fire, and called for them to follow him. As he charged up the slope and leaped into an enemy position, his men, inspired by his fearless actions, moved forward in a body and engaged the enemy in close combat. Fighting fiercely, Captain Arthur was attempting to drive the enemy from an emplacement when a grenade exploded, seriously wounding him. Although he tried repeatedly to regain his footing and continue to lead the attack, his wounds made this impossible. But his men, imbued with his own courage, overran the hostile emplacements and secured the objective.\n\nArtiaga, Jose M. Jr. (posthumous)\n\nThe President of the United States of America, under the provisions of the Act of Congress approved July 9, 1918, takes pride in presenting the Distinguished Service Cross (Posthumously) to First Lieutenant Jose M. Artiaga, Jr., Army of the Philippines, for extraordinary heroism in connection with military operations against an armed enemy of the United Nations while serving with the Tenth Battalion Combat Team, Philippine Expeditionary force to Korea, in action against enemy forces at Yuctong, Korea on 22 and 23 April 1951. Throughout the night his platoon was repeatedly assaulted by a fanatical and numerically superior hostile force of Chinese Communists. With utter disregard for his safety and constantly exposed to heavy machine-gun, mortar, and artillery fire, Lieutenant Artiaga moved about the sector held by his men to steady, encourage, and deploy them to insure the best defense of their positions. Despite exhaustion, isolation from other elements of the company, and the disaster which seemed imminent, his troops tenaciously repulsed repeated attacks and inflicted numerous casualties. While tirelessly directing the fire of his depleted force, he was mortally wounded, but his courage and indomitable fighting spirit so imbued his troops with a spirit of irrepressible determination that they held the positions until relief arrived.\n\nGeneral Orders: Department of the Army: General Orders No. 28 (March 13, 1952)\n\nAshworth, Alton M. (posthumous)\n\nHeadquarters, Eighth U.S. Army\n\nGeneral Orders No. 620 - August 6, 1951\n\nThe President of the United States of America, under the provisions of the Act of Congress approved July 9, 1918, takes pride in presenting the Distinguished Service Cross (Posthumously) to Sergeant Alton M. Ashworth (ASN: ER-38589076), United States Army, for extraordinary heroism in connection with military operations against an armed enemy of the United Nations while serving with Company L, 3d Battalion, 8th Cavalry Regiment (Infantry), 1st Cavalry Division. Sergeant ASHWORTH distinguished himself by extraordinary heroism in action against enemy aggressor forces in the vicinity of Unsan-ni, North Korea, on 2 December 1950. Sergeant Ashworth's company was assigned the mission of securing the high ground along the edge of a route over which the regiment was planning a withdrawal to escape an enemy trap. As the men moved into the assault, they encountered intense machine-gun fire from an enemy emplacement on their left flank. As Sergeant Ashworth deployed his men into position to silence the weapon, they were pinned down by the fire of a second machine-gun. Realizing that his initial mission could not be completed until this new threat was neutralized, he immediately moved forward to within ten feet of the emplacement and silenced the weapon with grenades. Suddenly an enemy soldier charged down upon him with a grenade in his hand. Sergeant Ashworth successfully cut him down with a burst from his carbine, but was mortally wounded by fragments from the exploding grenade. Although he was dying on his feet, he refused evacuation but instead organized his men and led them forward in a charge which secured the main objective.\n\nAtchley, Oren C. (posthumous - MIA)\n\nThe President of the United States of America, under the provisions of the Act of Congress approved July 9, 1918, takes pride in presenting the Distinguished Service Cross (Posthumously) to Lieutenant Colonel (Medical Corps) Oren C. Atchley (ASN: 0-31111), United States Army, for extraordinary heroism in connection with military operations against an armed enemy of the United Nations while serving as Commanding Officer of the 7th Medical Battalion, 7th Infantry Division. Lieutenant Colonel Atchley distinguished himself by extraordinary heroism in action against enemy aggressor forces in the vicinity of Pungsan, Korea, on 24 November 1950. While at a forward command post, Colonel Atchley organized a search party to attempt to locate an ambulance with wounded men that was missing in enemy territory. The search party was attacked while he was on reconnaissance, and he was separated from the other men. On his return, without hesitation and fully aware of the odds against him, he fired on the enemy, distracting them, giving his men time to escape. When last seen he was fearlessly maintaining his stand and urging the others to withdraw.\n\nAtwood, Virgil Milton (posthumous)\n\nThe President of the United States of America, under the provisions of the Act of Congress approved July 9, 1918, takes pride in presenting the Distinguished Service Cross (Posthumously) to Second Lieutenant (Infantry) Virgil Milton Atwood (ASN: 0-2262952), United States Army, for extraordinary heroism in connection with military operations against an armed enemy of the United Nations while serving with Company K, 3d Battalion, 5th Cavalry Regiment (Infantry), 1st Cavalry Division. Second Lieutenant Atwood distinguished himself by extraordinary heroism in action against enemy aggressor forces in the vicinity of Okkye-ri, Korea, on 3 June 1951. Lieutenant Atwood was the leader of the assault platoon in an attack against an enemy-held hill. As the platoon advanced to the crest of the hill, it was suddenly subjected to intense enemy small-arms and automatic-weapons fire from well-fortified and camouflaged emplacements manned by a hostile force estimated at battalion strength. Realizing that in their present exposed position the platoon faced annihilation, Lieutenant Atwood, with complete disregard for his personal safety, charged up the slope toward the entrenchments. His heroic single-handed assault so surprised the enemy that they momentarily forgot the platoon, granting it time to seek cover, and instead concentrated their fire on Lieutenant Atwood. Rapidly firing his carbine and throwing grenades among the confused enemy, he leaped into their midst and killed approximately twenty of them in addition to rendering six automatic weapons useless. With the enemy in his immediate vicinity eliminated, Lieutenant Atwood began to move foreword once mere but was hit and instantly killed by a bursting enemy shell.\n\nGeneral Orders: Headquarters, Eighth U.S. Army, Korea: General Orders No. 695 (September 14, 1951)\n\nAvington, Robert J.\n\nDepartment of the Army\n\nGeneral Orders No. 85 - 25 September 1951\n\nThe President of the United States of America, under the provisions of the Act of Congress approved July 9, 1918, takes pleasure in presenting the Distinguished Service Cross to Private First Class Robert J. Avington (ASN: RA-13273276), United States Army, for extraordinary heroism in connection with military operations against an armed enemy of the United Nations while serving with Company D, 1st Battalion, 31st Infantry Regiment, 7th Infantry Division. Private First Class Avington distinguished himself by extraordinary heroism in action against enemy aggressor forces at Hwachon, Korea, on 30 May 1951. On that date, the machine-gunner in his squad was seriously wounded, when Private Avington, despite a wound in his arm, placed the gun back in operation and successfully turned back an enemy attack in force. Aiding the seriously wounded gunner as best he could, he refused aid for himself and sent for a litter to evacuate his comrade. The enemy again sent a wave of troops to rush his position, and the remaining element of the hostile force attempted to isolate him from assistance by pouring heavy fire on his position. He again poured a relentless stream of fire into the on-rushing horde and, while reloading his weapon, was grazed on the head by rifle fire and thrown back from his gun by concussion grenades. Crawling back to his gun, and pausing only to throw out enemy grenades which were lobbed into his position, he again halted the hostile assault with his accurate fire. Several of his comrades sprang forward to render assistance, but Private Avington, although bleeding profusely from the head and arm, again refused evacuation and demanded more ammunition for his weapons. When the enemy launched third assault against his position, though nearly unconscious from loss of blood, he again directed a devastating stream of fire on the assaulting force until they fled in wild disorder. His determined and heroic action resulted in more than 150 dead Chinese Communist troops, numerous others wounded, and in saving the platoon position from being overrun\n\nBack to Page Contents\n\nB\n\nBabbick, John Lawrence (posthumous)\n\nThe President of the United States of America, under the provisions of the Act of Congress approved July 9, 1918, takes pride in presenting the Distinguished Service Cross (posthumously) to Hospitalman Third Class John Lawrence Babbick, United States Navy, for extraordinary heroism in connection with military operations against an armed enemy of the United Nations while serving as Corpsman (Attached), Company A, First Battalion, Fifth Marines, First Marine Division (Reinforced), in action against enemy forces at Taebong-ni, Korea, on 17 August 1950. While his company was attacking a heavily fortified enemy position, Hospitalman Babbick heard frantic cries for a corpsman from a wounded marine lying in an open area of a rice field, which was under concentrated enemy machine-gun and sniper fire. Although warned not to expose himself, Hospitalman Babbick, remarking that the man's condition could not wait, unhesitatingly and courageously made his way to him through withering fire and proceeded to administer first aid. After easing the wounded marine's pain, Hospitalman Babbick was mortally wounded by a sniper's bullet as he attempted to return to cover.\n\nBailey, Don V.\n\nHeadquarters Eighth U.S. Army\n\nGeneral Orders No. 27 - 17 August 1950\n\nThe President of the United States of America, under the provisions of the Act of Congress approved July 9, 1918, takes pleasure in presenting the Distinguished Service Cross to Private First Class Don V. Bailey (ASN: RA-15274625), United States Army, for extraordinary heroism in connection with military operations against an armed enemy of the United Nations while serving with the Ambulance Company, 24th Medical Battalion, 24th Infantry Division.

Private First Class Bailey, an ambulance driver, was wounded while he was part of a group that was encircled and under extremely heavy enemy fire. Disregarding his wound, he continued to try and evacuate the wounded. His ambulance was destroyed by enemy fire and he then transferred the wounded to an armored vehicle. During this action he was wounded again, and the armored vehicle rendered inoperative. He then secured a jeep and loaded it with wounded and during this action he was wounded six times, rendering him helpless. Only then, would he allow himself to be evacuated.\n\nBaker, James F.\n\nHeadquarters, Eighth U.S. Army\n\nGeneral Orders No. 5 96 - June 23, 1953\n\nThe President of the United States of America, under the provisions of the Act of Congress approved July 9, 1918, takes pleasure in presenting the Distinguished Service Cross to First Lieutenant (Infantry) James F. Baker, United States Army, for extraordinary heroism in connection with military operations against an armed enemy of the United Nations while serving as Platoon Leader with an Infantry Company. First Lieutenant Baker distinguished himself by extraordinary heroism in action against enemy aggressor forces in the vicinity of Surang-ni, Korea, on 24 April 1953. On that date, Lieutenant Baker was on a position which was under assault by artillery and mortar fire. Twice prevented from leaving the command post by hostile fire, Lieutenant Baker managed to extricate himself and moved among the men, at times engaging in hand-to-hand combat with the enemy troops who had already overrun the position. When the ferocity of the battle forced the allied troops to withdraw to more tenable positions, Lieutenant Baker organized a small force and led them in an attempt to regain the lost position. The counter-attack was halted twice by heavy fire but on the third attempt Lieutenant Baker, through his inspirational leadership, led the men into the trenches and repulsed the hostile forces. He then immediately set up an effective defense and administered medical aid to the wounded. Upon the arrival of reinforcements, Lieutenant Baker turned his efforts toward the evacuation of casualties and refused to leave the outpost until he was assured that it was safe from further attack.\n\nBaker, Royal N.\n\nHeadquarters, Far East Air Forces\n\nGeneral Orders No. 169 (April 3, 1953)\n\nThe President of the United States of America, under the provisions of the Act of Congress approved July 9, 1918, takes pleasure in presenting the Distinguished Service Cross to Colonel Royal N. Baker, United States Air Force, for extraordinary heroism in connection with military operations against an armed enemy of the United Nations while serving as a Pilot with the 336th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron, 4th Fighter-Interceptor Wing, Fifth Air Force, in action against enemy forces in the Republic of Korea on 14 February 1953. While leading a flight of F-86 aircraft near Imsan-dong, North Korea, Colonel Baker sighted four MIG-15s launching an attack on a flight of friendly aircraft who were apparently unaware of the impending attack. Colonel Baker, with outstanding valor and with complete disregard for his own personal safety, immediately initiated a fearless, aggressive attack on the enemy aircraft. He singled out one MIG, which was making a firing pass, as the focal point of his action. Realizing that the allied pilots under attack were in grave danger, Colonel Baker commenced firing at maximum range, boring unswervingly toward the target, until solid hits were scored in the tailpipe section, causing the MIG to smoke heavily and decelerate. Colonel Baker continued his undivided vigilance of the enemy craft until it went into a spin and crashed into the ground. Although low on fuel deep in enemy territory, Colonel Baker remained in the battle area until all friendly aircraft were safe from any immediate threat. Colonel Baker's cool, assured performance under fire, his unhesitating and selfless action in deflecting the enemy and saving the life of a pilot and his singleness of purpose in exposing himself fearlessly to enemy fire in order to protect those threatened is indicative of the highest degree of courage and gallantry.\n\nBalboni, Joseph W. (posthumous)\n\nThe President of the United States of America, under the provisions of the Act of Congress approved July 9, 1918, takes pride in presenting the Distinguished Service Cross (posthumously) to Private First Class Joseph W. Balboni, United States Army, for extraordinary heroism in connection with military operations against an armed enemy of the United Nations while serving with Company E, 19th Infantry Regiment, 24th Infantry Division. Private First Class Balboni distinguished himself by extraordinary heroism in action against enemy aggressor forces near Anju, Korea, on 5 November 1950. At dawn on that date, an enemy force of approximately six hundred Chinese Communist soldiers launched a sudden fanatical attack on Private First Class Balboni's company's position. By stealth and excellent fire discipline, the enemy worked their way at points to within twenty-five yards of the company's lines before the full fury of their attack was unleashed. Private Balboni, armed with a Browning Automatic Rifle, immediately opened fire on the advancing enemy troops, whose attack was increased in strength and vigor. As the Communist attack mounted against the thin line of Company E, it became apparent that a withdrawal must be ordered. As the unit withdrew, Private Balboni continued is deadly fire even when the enemy came within a few feet of his position, and voluntarily remaining in place, placed burst after burst on the advancing ranks of the enemy. This momentarily delayed, but did not stop, their advance in his sector. Despite his grim determination and his deadly fire, which killed seventeen of the enemy, he was presently surrounded and killed.\n\nBaldonado, Joe R. (posthumous)\n\nThe President of the United States of America, under the provisions of the Act of Congress approved July 9, 1918, takes pride in presenting the Distinguished Service Cross (posthumously) to Corporal Joe R. Baldonado, United States Army, for extraordinary heroism in connection with military operations against an armed enemy of the United Nations while serving as a machine-gunner with Company B, 1st Battalion, 187th Airborne Regimental Combat Team, 11th Airborne Division. Corporal Baldonado distinguished himself by extraordinary heroism in action against enemy aggressor forces in the vicinity of Kang-deng, Korea, on 25 November 1950. On that date, at 0400 hours, the 2d platoon of Company B was occupying positions on Hill 171 near Kang-deng when the enemy launched a strong attack in an effort to seize the hill. By 0600 hours, the platoon had expended most of its ammunition in repelling the enemy attack, and the platoon leader decided to commit his third squad, with its supply of ammunition, in the defensive action. Since there was not time to dig in because of the proximity of the enemy that had advanced to within twenty-five yards of the platoon positions, Corporal Baldonado, machine-gunner of the third squad, placed his weapon in an exposed position and delivered a withering stream of fire on the advancing enemy, causing them to fall back in disorder. The enemy then concentrated all their fire on Corporal Baldonado's gun and attempted to knock it out by rushing the position in small groups and hurling grenades. Several times grenades exploded extremely close to Corporal Baldonado, but failed to interrupt his continuous firing. The hostile troops made repeated attempts to storm his position and were driven back each time with appalling casualties. The enemy finally withdrew at 0700 hours after making a final assault on Corporal Baldonado's position during which a grenade landed near his gun, killing him instantly.\n\nBaldwin, George R.\n\nHeadquarters, Eighth U.S. Army\n\nGeneral Orders No. 892 - September 28, 1953\n\nThe President of the United States of America, under the provisions of the Act of Congress approved July 9, 1918, takes pleasure in presenting the Distinguished Service Cross to Sergeant George R. Baldwin, United States Army, for extraordinary heroism in connection with military operations against an armed enemy of the United Nations while serving as Acting Platoon Sergeant of an Infantry Company. Sergeant Baldwin distinguished himself by extraordinary heroism in action against enemy aggressor forces in the vicinity of Ihyon-ni, Korea, on the night of 1 June 1953. On that night, Sergeant Baldwin was acting platoon sergeant of a company outpost which was overrun by the enemy. When the hostile forces swarmed into the trenches Sergeant Baldwin attacked them, killing the leader of the force and two other enemy soldiers with withering fire from his carbine. As the battle continued Sergeant Baldwin, disregarding his own safety and the grave dangers involved, proceeded to an outpost one hundred and fifty yards in front of the main line of resistance to aid in bolstering the defense there. On his way he encountered and killed another enemy soldier. Sergeant Baldwin then returned to his former position and vas responsible for killing two more of the enemy. Again under intense fire, Sergeant Baldwin proceeded back to the outpost to assist the wounded. His courageous and selfless actions were instrumental in the evacuation of the dead and wounded. Through Sergeant Baldwin's exceptional valor the position was successfully defended and many casualties inflicted on the hostile force.\n\nBales, J.E.\n\nHeadquarters, Eighth U.S. Army\n\nGeneral Orders No. 400 - June 5, 1951\n\nThe President of the United States of America, under the provisions of the Act of Congress approved July 9, 1918, takes pleasure in presenting the Distinguished Service Cross to Sergeant J.E. Bales, United States Army, for extraordinary heroism in connection with military operations against an armed enemy of the United Nations while serving with Company C, 1st Battalion, 15th Infantry Regiment, 3d Infantry Division. Sergeant Bales distinguished himself by extraordinary heroism in action against enemy aggressor forces in the vicinity of Uijongbu, Korea, on 24 March 1951. On that date, Sergeant Bales' platoon was given the mission of attacking and securing a well-defended enemy held hill near Uijongbu. As the attack commenced, the Second Squad, led by Sergeant Bales, moved out as the lead element of the platoon and after advancing approximately seventy-five yards across open, fire-swept terrain, encountered the first enemy position. Deploying his squad to furnish covering fire, Sergeant Bales secured eight grenades and single-handedly charged the position, hurling grenades into the entrenchment as he approached it. Then, assaulting the position with his rifle, he killed five enemy soldiers and captured two. Although constantly exposed to intense hostile fire, he signaled his squad to advance and then led his men in systematic assaults on the remaining enemy positions. On one occasion, Sergeant Bales boldly advanced to within fifteen feet of an enemy position and fired a rocket launcher from point blank range into a fiercely defended dugout, forcing three enemy troops to surrender. The personal bravery and aggressive leadership of Sergeant Bales resulted in sixty-three enemy killed and in the complete dispersal of a numerically superior hostile force.\n\nBaltz, Robert L. (posthumous)\n\nThe President of the United States of America, under the provisions of the Act of Congress approved July 9, 1918, takes pride in presenting the Distinguished Service Cross (posthumously) to Second Lieutenant (Infantry) Robert L. Baltz, United States Army, for extraordinary heroism in connection with military operations against an armed enemy of the United Nations while serving with an Infantry Company of the 17th Infantry Regiment, 7th Infantry Division. Second Lieutenant Baltz distinguished himself by extraordinary heroism in action against enemy aggressor forces in the vicinity of Tang-Wan-ni, Korea. On the morning of 16 June 1952, Lieutenant Baltz led an assault squad in an attack on a heavily-fortified hill to capture or kill enemy troops. While the group was advancing toward the position, an intense barrage of enemy small-arms, mortar, and artillery fire was encountered. In spite of the dangers involved, Lieutenant Baltz left the squad and circled an enemy bunker to throw grenades into the tunnel which connected the communications trench and the bunker. Returning to his squad, Lieutenant Baltz saw that the enemy was moving in reinforcements. Unhesitatingly, he assaulted the hill, encouraging his men to follow. Lieutenant Baltz had advanced only a few yards when he was hit by a burst of fire from an enemy burp-gun and mortally wounded.\n\nBamford, Charles F. II\n\nHeadquarters, Eighth U.S. Army\n\nGeneral Orders No. 1067 - December 10, 1953\n\nThe President of the United States of America, under the provisions of the Act of Congress approved July 9, 1918, takes pleasure in presenting the Distinguished Service Cross to Second Lieutenant (Infantry) Charles F. Bamford II (ASN: 0-1927575), United States Army, for extraordinary heroism in connection with military operations against an armed enemy of the United Nations while serving with an Infantry Company of the 223d Infantry Regiment, 40th Infantry Division. Second Lieutenant Bamford distinguished himself by extraordinary heroism in action against enemy aggressor forces in the vicinity of Mandae-ri, Korea, on the early morning of 4 July 1953. On that date, Lieutenant Bamford was the leader of a combat patrol which was subjected to intense small-arms and machine-gun fire. Completely ignoring his personal safety, Lieutenant Bamford charged forty yards through the heavy barrage to the machine-gun emplacement and silenced the weapon with grenades. Continuing to disregard the bombardment, he led five of his men into the heavily-fortified enemy trenches and, through personal example encouraged them in engaging in hand-to-hand combat with the numerically superior enemy. Although wounded by grenade, Lieutenant Bamford employed his carbine and grenades with great effectiveness and directed an assault through 150 yards of enemy trenches. Through his fearless devotion to duty and his refusal to withdraw until ordered to do so, Lieutenant Bamford so inspired his men that they voluntarily Joined him in attacking and destroying a vital enemy stronghold and in inflicting numerous casualties.\n\nBarber, Worth H. (posthumous)\n\nThe President of the United States of America, under the provisions of the Act of Congress approved July 9, 1918, takes pride in presenting the Distinguished Service Cross (posthumously) to Second Lieutenant (Infantry) Worth H. Barber, United States Army, for extraordinary heroism in connection with military operations against an armed enemy of the United Nations while serving as a Platoon Leader with Company I, 3d Battalion, 38th Infantry Regiment, 2d Infantry Division. Second Lieutenant Barber distinguished himself by extraordinary heroism in action against enemy aggressor forces in the vicinity of Pangmang-ni, Korea, on 25 December 1951. On that date, Lieutenant Barber was leading his men in an assault against a series of heavily fortified hostile emplacements. As the friendly troops approached their objective, a heavy volume of small-arms, automatic weapons, mortar, and artillery fire poured down from the enemy positions. Continuously exposing himself to enemy fire, Lieutenant Barber did not allow his men to falter. Instead he led them forward, inspiring them by his own courageous actions. Observing one of his men fall wounded on the exposed terrain, Lieutenant Barber raced through the enemy fire and carried the man to cover and then moved to the forefront of his troops to continue directing the attack. At this time, he was hit by fragments of an exploding mortar shell, but upon discovering the position of an enemy machine-gun which was pouring intense fire into the ranks of the friendly troops, he disregarded his painful wound and charged forward in a single-handed attack. With his rifle and grenades, he succeeded in neutralizing the position, thus enabling his men to resume their assault. Finally, when the deeply entrenched hostile force threatened the friendly troops with annihilation, Lieutenant Barber received instructions to break contact with the enemy. After leading his men to safety, Lieutenant Barber voluntarily returned to the fire-swept area to assure himself that all of his men had fallen back. It was while searching the terrain that he was killed by an exploding artillery shell.\n\nBarker, William C.\n\nHeadquarters, Eighth U.S. Army\n\nGeneral Orders No. 77 - September 23, 1950\n\nThe President of the United States of America, under the provisions of the Act of Congress approved July 9, 1918, takes pleasure in presenting the Distinguished Service Cross to Sergeant William C. Barker, United States Army, for extraordinary heroism in connection with military operations against an armed enemy of the United Nations while serving as a medical aidman with Company B, 65th Engineer Combat Battalion, 25th Infantry Division. Sergeant Barker distinguished himself by extraordinary heroism in action against enemy aggressor forces near Chungam-ni, Korea, on 19 August 1950. Throughout the day the enemy launched repeated fanatical attacks against the strategic position held by Company B. During the battle, which raged for eight hours, Sergeant Barker made repeated trips over mountainous terrain exposed to concentrated enemy automatic weapons fire to evacuate wounded. In the final stages of the battle, when overwhelming hostile forces penetrated the company position and the order to withdraw was given, Sergeant Barker, heedless of the intense enemy fire, remained in a forward position and administered first aid to one of the wounded. When he had finished dressing the wounds the company had withdrawn; Sergeant Barker, unassisted, evacuated the wounded man down a treacherous slope to safety.\n\nBarnes, James C. Jr.\n\nHeadquarters, Far East Command\n\nGeneral Orders No. 118 - May 12, 1951\n\nThe President of the United States of America, authorized by Act of Congress July 9, 1918, takes pleasure in presenting the Distinguished Service Cross to Second Lieutenant (Field Artillery) James C. Barnes, Jr. (ASN: 0-62704), United States Army, for extraordinary heroism in connection with military operations against an armed enemy while serving as a Forward Observer of Battery A, 48th Field Artillery Battalion, in action against an armed enemy of the United Nations in Korea, on 7 December 1950. Lieutenant Barnes, commanding a composite unit of the 1st Battalion, 32d Infantry Regiment, 7th Infantry Division, was proceeding in motor convoy with elements of the First Marine Division from Hagaru-ri to Koto-ri. A portion of the convoy was seriously threatened by the enemy who had established a well-emplaced machine gun on commanding terrain, inflicting severe casualties on the column. Lieutenant Barnes, perceiving the impending danger, ordered a platoon to follow him in a rapid charge against the enemy. Pinned down by hostile fire, his men were unable to advance and, realizing their peril, Lieutenant Barnes dashed across approximately three hundred yards of open ground, exposing himself to nearly point-blank automatic weapons fire until, effectively positioned, he destroyed the machine gun with hand grenades and small arms fire. Lieutenant Barnes' conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity enabled the unit to attack and annihilate the foe, preventing heavy casualties among his men. His selfless devotion to duty reflects untold glory on himself and upholds the heroic traditions of the military service.\n\nBarnes, Ralph H.\n\nFirst Lieutenant Ralph H. Barnes...(then Second Lieutenant)...a member of Company C, 15th Infantry Regiment, 3d Infantry Division, distinguished himself by extraordinary heroism in action against the enemy in the vicinity of Uijongbu, Korea, on 24 March 1951. Company C, given the mission of securing Hill 337 from a well-entrenched and determined hostile force, was temporarily pinned down by intense enemy small-arms, automatic-weapons and mortar fire while moving toward the objective. Lieutenant Barnes, leader of the 1st Platoon, realizing the necessity of seizing the objective to alleviate the pressure being exerted on other friendly units courageously led his men forward in a frontal assault until forced to take cover. Observing that a machine-gun emplacement was blocking the platoon's advance, Lieutenant Barnes ordered his men to cover him then fearlessly charged toward the enemy position, but was knocked to the ground by an exploding grenade. Although stunned, he regained his footing and, disregarding the intense enemy fire being concentrated on him, continued his single-handed assault. Hurling hand grenades into the hostile emplacement, he killed the four enemy occupants, permitting his unit to renew their attack and preventing the casualties which the enemy-manned machine gun undoubtedly would have inflicted. He then led his men in an assault which terminated with the seizure of the objective and resulted in heavy losses to the enemy in both men and equipment...\n\nBarnes, Thomas J. (posthumous)\n\nDepartment of the Army\n\nGeneral Orders No. 3 - 20 January 1954\n\nThe President of the United States of America, under the provisions of the Act of Congress approved July 9, 1918, takes pride in presenting the Distinguished Service Cross (Posthumously) to First Lieutenant Thomas J. Barnes (ASN: 0-1882511), United States Army, for extraordinary heroism in connection with military operations against an armed enemy of the United Nations while serving as Executive Officer of Company K, 3d Battalion, 17th Infantry Regiment, 7th Infantry Division. First Lieutenant Barnes distinguished himself by extraordinary heroism in action against enemy aggressor forces at Sokkogae, Korea, on 9 July 1953. On that date, Lieutenant Barnes participated in a counterattack to secure a heavily fortified hill position when the company was suddenly halted and pinned down by intense enemy artillery, mortar, and small-arms fire, which seriously hampered further progress and forced the men to seek cover. Realizing the vulnerability of their position and refusing to take cover, he unhesitatingly left his position and, with utter disregard for his safety, moved to a position approximately fifty yards from an enemy bunker. From this exposed position, he daringly fired several rounds into the enemy bunker, destroying it completely and killing all the occupants. The friendly assault forces were thus inspired and encouraged by Lieutenant Barnes, who, despite enemy fire, moved fearlessly among the men urging them to rout the enemy. Finding the company commander a casualty during the ensuing battle and other members of the company scattered, he assumed command, quickly reorganized the men, and resumed the attack. Dominating the critical situation through sheer force of heroic example, he led the daring assault up the hill where they were again met with enemy mortar, grenade and small-arms fire, making further advance impossible. Concerned for the lives of his men, he calmly ordered them to withdraw to a trench below the crest of the objective, but he remained exposed on high ground until all had gained cover. Then descending and hastily jumping into the trench below, he was hit by an enemy mortar burst that critically wounded him and killed several others. Although partially blinded and seriously wounded in the left leg, he attempted to rise to assist his injured comrades, but collapsed. He refused medical aid and evacuation until all others were treated, and he later succumbed to his wounds.\n\nGeneral Orders: Department of the Army: General Orders No. 3 (January 20, 1954)\n\nBarnett, Billy E. (posthumous)\n\nThe President of the United States of America, under the provisions of the Act of Congress approved July 9, 1918, takes pride in presenting the Distinguished Service Cross (posthumously) to Corporal Billy E. Barnett, United States Army, for extraordinary heroism in connection with military operations against an armed enemy of the United Nations while serving with Company G, 2d Battalion, 21st Infantry Regiment, 24th Infantry Division. Corporal Barnett distinguished himself by extraordinary heroism in action against enemy aggressor forces at Changyoung, Korea, on 16 September 1950. On this date, Corporal Barnett was with a patrol as forward observer when the patrol made contact with a unit of the enemy, entrenched and supported by mortars and machine-guns. The enemy suddenly delivered a volume of fire heavy enough to prevent the patrol from moving either forward or backward and making the patrol's position untenable. Corporal Barnett realized that the patrol would be annihilated unless the men could withdraw. He left his position of relative safety and crawled to a point from which he could direct effective fire. The fire that he directed relieved the pressure on the patrol and permitted them to withdraw to a better position. Corporal Barnett refused to accompany them and with full knowledge of the peril, continued to screen his withdrawing comrades with fire. After the patrol was well out of danger, the enemy rushed Corporal Barnett's position. He is credited with destroying at least five of them with his carbine and driving off the remainder in hand-to-hand combat. While still in position firing at the enemy he was hit by a mortar shell and instantly killed.\n\nBarr, David Gordon\n\nHeadquarters, X Corps\n\nGeneral Orders No. 50 - December 6, 1950\n\nThe President of the United States of America, under the provisions of the Act of Congress approved July 9, 1918, takes pleasure in presenting the Distinguished Service Cross to Major General David Gordon Barr, United States Army, for extraordinary heroism in connection with military operations against an armed enemy of the United Nations while serving as Commanding General of the 7th Infantry Division, during the drive of his Division from Iwon to Hyesanjin, Korea, from 31 October 1950 to 22 November 1950. Although faced by treacherous, mountainous terrain, sub-zero temperatures and a crafty, tenacious foe, General Barr so skillfully led his Division that enemy resistance was crushed at Kapsar and the Division advanced rapidly to the Korean-Manchurian border. His continued presence at the front under bitter winter conditions with total disregard for his personal safety and under continual small-arms, automatic weapons and mortar fire, was an inspiration to his men during the period of this historical drive. Major General Barr's aggressive leadership, courage under fire and personal heroism are in keeping with the highest traditions of the military service.\n\nBarsanti, Olinto Mark\n\nHeadquarters, X Corps\n\nGeneral Orders No. 280 November 14, 1950\n\nThe President of the United States of America, under the provisions of the Act of Congress approved July 9, 1918, takes pleasure in presenting the Distinguished Service Cross to Lieutenant Colonel (General Staff Corps) Olinto Mark Barsanti (ASN: 0-34037), United States Army, for extraordinary heroism in connection with military operations against an armed enemy of the United Nations while serving with the General Staff Corps, X Corps. Lieutenant Colonel Barsanti distinguished himself by extraordinary heroism in action against enemy aggressor forces in the Republic of Korea. During the period 19 October 1950 through 20 October 1950, Colonel Barsanti was directed to contact two Republic of Korea Infantry Divisions operating at a distance of eighty miles from the Command Post, X Corps, to arrange for the coordination of their operations with those of other United States Forces. The route to these divisions lay over a dangerous mountainous route intermittently occupied by organized enemy forces and guerrillas. Movement of individual vehicles by daylight was hazardous and movement by night was considered unfeasible. Lieutenant Colonel Barsanti, in order to complete his mission, moved continuously to contact the leading elements of both the Sixth and Eighth Republic of Korea Divisions. In order to reach both divisions, Lieutenant Colonel Barsanti had to move both day and night, a total of 190 miles over mountain roads in the rain for a period of thirty-six hours in an individual jeep. During this movement, he was stopped twice by enemy automatic and individual small arms fire at short ranges and was under small arms fire six times. After contacting the Sixth and Eighth Republic of Korea Divisions in the vicinity of Pyongjiwon, Lieutenant Colonel Barsanti, on his own initiative and with complete disregard for his safety, accompanied the leading elements of the Sixth and Eight Republic of Korea Divisions for an additional twenty-five miles in order to obtain valuable information important to the success of the X Corps' mission of forming a junction with other United Nations units. Again, Lieutenant Colonel Barsanti traveled over muddy, narrow mountainous roads, through enemy-infested areas, until the leading elements were stopped southwest and northwest of Songchon, North Korea, and although subjected again to enemy automatic and small arms fire, he obtained the information required. This action on the part of Lieutenant Colonel Barsanti reflects the highest credit upon himself and the military service.\n\nBartholomew, Kenneth L.\n\nHeadquarters, Far East Command\n\nGeneral Orders No. 207 - August 13, 1951\n\nThe President of the United States of America, under the provisions of the Act of Congress approved July 9, 1918, takes pleasure in presenting the Distinguished Service Cross to Corporal Kenneth L.

Corporal Bartholomew was participating in an attack on a strategic, thickly-wooded ridge tenaciously defended by a fanatical enemy force that was well-entrenched in numerous log bunkers, when his squad was pinned down by devastating automatic weapons and small arms fire. Unmindful of his safety, Corporal Bartholomew made a lone-man charge against the enemy emplacements and, dashing across the open, fire-swept terrain he moved from one pillbox to another, neutralizing them with grenades and personally killing six hostile troops defending the ground. Then, he quickly reorganized his squad Corporal Bartholomew led it in a daring sweep up the ridge, overrunning the enemy position and seizing the objective.\n\nBater, Lawrence H. (posthumous)\n\nThe President of the United States of America, under the provisions of the Act of Congress approved July 9, 1918, takes pride in presenting the Distinguished Service Cross (posthumously) to Private First Class LAWRENCE H. BATER, United States Army, for extraordinary heroism in connection with military operations against an armed enemy of the United Nations while serving with Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 9th Infantry Regiment, 2d Infantry Division. Private First Class BATER distinguished himself by extraordinary heroism in action against enemy aggressor forces in the vicinity of Yongsan, Korea, on 11 August 1950. Private First Class BATER was a member of a motor patrol that was suddenly ambushed by a strong and determined enemy force. From well-concealed positions, the hostile troops directed intense and accurate fire on the patrol, forcing it to withdraw. Private BATER, completely disregarding his personal safety, voluntarily remained behind to cover the withdrawal of the patrol. Under withering enemy fire from three sides, he steadfastly remained in place, fearlessly engaging the enemy with his rifle. Until killed by the intense enemy fire, he defiantly resisted the fanatically charging enemy, inflicting heavy casualties on them with his deadly accurate fire. His heroic and selfless action resulted in the successful withdrawal of his comrades. Three days later, when his remains were recovered, he was found in the position he had held, the area around him littered with enemy dead.\n\nBatluck, Joseph Jack (posthumous)\n\nThe President of the United States of America, under the provisions of the Act of Congress approved July 9, 1918, takes pride in presenting the Distinguished Service Cross (posthumously) to Corporal Joseph Jack Batluck, United States Marine Corps, for extraordinary heroism in connection with military operations against an armed enemy of the United Nations while serving with the Company H, Third Battalion, Fifth Marines, First Provisional Marine Brigade (Reinforced), Fleet Marine Force, Pacific, in action against enemy aggressor forces northeast of Chindong-ni, Korea, on 8 August 1950. When his company was pinned down by heavy enemy machine-gun and rifle fire, Corporal Batluck repeatedly and fearlessly exposed himself to enemy fire in order to control and reorganize his squad. This action aided materially in reestablishing the assault lines and thereby gave his company fire superiority over the enemy, resulting in successful continuation of the attack. Further, assisted by a comrade, he voluntarily and without regard for his own safety, made repeated trips through enemy fire-swept terrain to evacuate six wounded Marines, enabling them to receive prompt medical attention. In this heroic action Corporal Batluck was mortally wounded.\n\nBaumgartner, William L.\n\nHeadquarters, Eighth U.S. Army\n\nGeneral Orders No. 77 - September 23, 1950\n\nThe President of the United States of America, under the provisions of the Act of Congress approved July 9, 1918, takes pleasure in presenting the Distinguished Service Cross to Private William L. Baumgartner, United States Army, for extraordinary heroism in connection with military operations against an armed enemy of the United Nations while serving with Headquarters Battery, 90th Field Artillery Battalion, 25th Infantry Division. Private Baumgartner distinguished himself by extraordinary heroism in action against enemy aggressor forces near Pongam-ni, Korea, on 12 August 1950. On this date the Headquarters Battery was attacked by a numerically superior enemy force supported by artillery, mortars, tanks and automatic weapons. Despite devastating enemy fire, Private Baumgartner continued to man his .50 caliber machine-gun which became a primary target for the enemy. In addition, shells were exploding from an ammunition truck which had been hit and added to the hazards of the situation. After Private Baumgartner was thrown from his position by concussion and his machine-gun upset, he returned to his position and put the gun back into action. Another concussion threw him from his weapon a second time. After regaining consciousness, he again crawled to his post, and by accurate and effective fire destroyed an enemy assault gun and machine-gun nest, disabled another assault gun, and inflicted heavy casualties on the enemy. By his heroic and persistent effort he enabled his unit to withdraw in an orderly manner.\n\nBaxter, Earl Robert (posthumous)\n\nThe President of the United States of America, under the provisions of the Act of Congress approved July 9, 1918, takes pride in presenting the Distinguished Service Cross (posthumously) to Sergeant First Class Earl Robert Baxter, United States Army, for extraordinary heroism in connection with military operations against an armed enemy of the United Nations while serving with Company L, 3d Battalion, 8th Cavalry Regiment (Infantry), 1st Cavalry Division. Sergeant First Class Baxter distinguished himself by extraordinary heroism in action against enemy aggressor forces near Taegu, Korea, on 15 September 1950. On that date, the 2d platoon of Company L had seized Hill 401 and was preparing to reorganize and establish a defensive perimeter when the enemy suddenly launched a fanatical counterattack. The platoon withstood the assault until an acute shortage of ammunition made a withdrawal inevitable. Sergeant First Class Baxter, who had temporarily assumed command while the platoon sergeant attended a wounded man, ordered the platoon to withdraw while he remained behind to furnish covering fire. Standing fully exposed to the enemy, Sergeant Baxter placed a withering stream of fire on the on-rushing enemy horde until he was killed by an enemy grenade. When Company L later regained the hill, Sergeant Baxter's body was found with ten enemy soldiers lying nearby, attesting to the accuracy of his fire and grim determination to prevent the enemy routing the platoon's withdrawal. Undoubtedly the enemy suffered numerous other casualties as a result of his heroic action which enabled his comrades to withdraw with minimum losses.\n\nBeahler, Lee E. Jr.\n\nHeadquarters, Eighth U.S. Army\n\nGeneral Orders No. 59 - February 8, 1951\n\nThe President of the United States of America, under the provisions of the Act of Congress approved July 9, 1918, takes pleasure in presenting the Distinguished Service Cross to First Lieutenant (Corps of Engineers) Lee E. Beahler, Jr., United States Army, for extraordinary heroism in connection with military operations against an armed enemy of the United Nations while serving as Commanding Officer of Company D, 2d Engineer Combat Battalion, 2d Infantry Division. First Lieutenant Beahler distinguished himself by extraordinary heroism in action against enemy aggressor forces in the vicinity of Yongsan, Korea, on 2 September 1950. When an enemy force supported by artillery and armor continued an attack which had already overrun three infantry battalions, the 2d Engineer Battalion was rushed into the line to hold the vital communications center of Yongsan, which was the key to the pass leading back to Miryang on the Pusan-Taegu lifeline. With other elements of the battalion fighting as infantry south of the town, Company D was given a \"stand or die\" mission overlooking Yongsan itself. Deployed without supporting artillery or mortars, the unit beat off two enemy attacks, but at a cost of twelve dead and eighteen wounded, including all of the company officers except for Lieutenant Beahler. Assuming command of the battered and shaken unit, he rushed from man to man directing the fire of their small-arms, automatic-weapons, and rocket launchers in such a manner as to regain fire superiority. When the enemy returned to the attack for a third time, and actually penetrated into the town with tanks, Lieutenant Beahler, fearlessly exposing himself to the heavy fire being directed at him, maneuvered his men to more advantageous positions from which they soon destroyed one of the enemy tanks with a rocket fired at close range. Ranging up and down his line, this Engineer Officer inspired his men to pour a devastating fire upon the advancing North Koreans until the attack was broken up and the enemy driven back. By his superb leadership and aggressive actions throughout the entire day, the town was saved and the threat to the whole position was eliminated.\n\nBeal, Edward N. (posthumous)\n\nHeadquarters, Eighth U.S. Army\n\nGeneral Orders No. 138 - March 13, 1951\n\nThe President of the United States of America, under the provisions of the Act of Congress approved July 9, 1918, takes pride in presenting the Distinguished Service Cross (Posthumously) to Corporal Edward N. Beal (ASN: RA-19322870), United States Army, for extraordinary heroism in connection with military operations against an armed enemy of the United Nations while serving with Company A, 1st Battalion, 19th Infantry Regiment, 24th Infantry Division. Corporal Beal distinguished himself by extraordinary heroism in action against enemy aggressor forces near Chudeng-ni, Korea, on the night of 31 December 1950. On that date, a Chinese Communist force estimated at one division attacked the 19th Infantry Regiment. The main enemy effort was directed at high positions occupied by Company A. Moving his machine-gun to an exposed position, Corporal Beal poured withering fire into the ranks of the enemy, forcing them to withdraw. Unable to gain their objective by a frontal assault, the enemy began moving to the flank to make another attempt. Sensing their intention, Corporal Beal moved his gun to a more advantageous position, set it on free traverse, and caught the attacking enemy unawares. So accurate and devastating was his machine-gun fire that the enemy was again forced back, leaving an estimated 150 dead on the hill in front of his gun. At 0700 hours on 1 January 1951, his company was ordered to withdraw, but Corporal Beal voluntarily remained behind, and when last seen by his comrades, was still delivering heavy machine-gunfire on the enemy.\n\nBeall, Olin L.\n\nHeadquarters, X Corps\n\nGeneral Orders No. 66 - December 15, 1950\n\nThe President of the United States of America, under the provisions of the Act of Congress approved July 9, 1918, takes pleasure in presenting the Distinguished Service Cross to Lieutenant Colonel Olin L. Beall (MCSN: 0-1937), United States Marine Corps, for extraordinary heroism in connection with military operations against an armed enemy of the United Nations while serving as Commanding Officer, First Marine Motor Transport Battalion, First Marine Division (Reinforced), in action against enemy aggressor forces in the vicinity of the Chosin Reservoir, Korea, from 29 November to 4 December 1950. Lieutenant Colonel Beall's actions contributed materially to the breakthrough in the Chosin Reservoir and are in keeping with the highest traditions of the military service.\n\nBeard, Richard R. (posthumous)\n\nHeadquarters, Eight U.S. Army\n\nGeneral Orders No. 220 - 19 April 1951\n\nThe President of the United States of America, under the provisions of the Act of Congress approved July 9, 1918, takes pride in presenting the Distinguished Service Cross (Posthumously) to Master Sergeant Richard R. Beard (ASN: RA-6894102), United States Army, for extraordinary heroism in connection with military operations against an armed enemy of the United Nations while serving with Company C, 70th Tank Battalion (Medium), 24th Infantry Division. Master Sergeant Beard distinguished himself by extraordinary heroism in action against enemy aggressor forces near Sinchang-ni, Korea, on 29 November 1950. On that date, while supporting the defense of a friendly roadblock, Sergeant Beard's platoon was attacked by a numerically superior enemy force employing an intense volume of automatic-weapons, small-arms and mortar fire. Mounting the rear deck of his tank and completely exposing himself to the enemy fire, Sergeant Beard calmly directed the fire of his tank weapons, then manned the tank's machine-gun and delivered withering fire on the enemy, inflicting many casualties and forcing them to withdraw. Reforming, the enemy again attacked his position and once more was repulsed by the devastating machine-gun fire of Sergeant Beard. Later, when orders to move to a new position were received, Sergeant Beard, unable to contact one of his tanks by radio because of communications failure, dismounted from his tank and., running through a deadly volume of hostile fire, delivered withdrawal instructions to the tank commander. He then returned to his tank and was directing withdrawal actions when he was killed.\n\n--\n\n\"The former Camp Trans Alpha in Korea has become Camp Richard R. Beard in honor of a Korean tanker hero and Distinguished Service Cross winner in dedication ceremonies at the compound March 28. Beard, a native of Washington County, has two brothers living in the county. They are Vaughn K. Beard of Hagerstown Rt. 4 and Gail b. Beard, Smithsburg Rt. 2. Highlight of the ceremonies was the unveiling of a bronze plaque inscribed with the new name of Maj. Gen. C.F. Leonard Jr., commander, 1st Cav. Div. Addressing the assembled tankers before the unveiling, Gen. Leonard said in part: 'We gather today to pay homage to a Great American and soldier--one who made the supreme sacrifice for his country... Today we are here to fulfill the same mission as MSgt. Beard in the cause of freedom.' Sgt. Beard served with C co., 70th Tank Bn., from September 1950 to November 1950 when he was killed in action while serving as a tank leader. In addition to the DSC, Sgt. Beard was authorized the Silver Star with Oak Leaf cluster, the Bronze Star Medal, the Korean Service Medal for participation in the UN Defensive, UN Offensive and the Bravery Gold Medal of Greece. Stressing the importance of tankers in defending Freedom's Frontier, Gen. Leonard concluded his speech by complimenting the tankers on the outstanding job and display of spirit that they have shown since their reorganization last July. Music for the dedication was provided by the 1st Cav. Div. band with a personal biography on Beard being read by 1st Lt. Allan Winkenhoffer, S-3 (Air), 2d Bn., 15th Armor. The ceremonies began with a prayer by Chap. (Capt.) Harry S. Garrett.

Beckett, United States Army, for extraordinary heroism in connection with military operations against an armed enemy of the United Nations while serving with Company I, 3d Battalion, 31st Infantry Regiment, 7th Infantry Division. First Lieutenant Beckett distinguished himself by extraordinary heroism in action against enemy aggressor forces in the vicinity of Agok, Korea, on 25 January 1953. On that date, Lieutenant Beckett was in charge of an alert platoon on the main line of resistance. When a signal flare was observed in the area of a contact patrol which had been dispatched earlier, Lieutenant Beckett recognized it as a distress signal and immediately organized a squad of twelve men to move to the rescue. Through Lieutenant Beckett's inspirational leadership and aggressive direction, the squad was successful in penetrating an enemy encirclement and in reaching the ambushed patrol. While he was guiding the wounded men back through hostile lines, Lieutenant Beckett was informed that there were still four men on the position and that the patrol aidman was being taken prisoner by the enemy. Disregarding all thoughts of personal safety, Lieutenant Beckett returned to the scene with five men, rescued the four wounded soldiers and then, ordering his comrades to cover him, pursued two enemy soldiers who held the aidman captive, killing them with a white phosphorous grenade and rescuing the prisoner.\n\nBeltz, Lloyd E. (posthumous)\n\nDepartment of the Army\n\nGeneral Orders No. 20 - 25 May 1956\n\nPrivate Lloyd E. Beltz, Infantry, United States Army, a member of Company K, 7th Cavalry Regiment, 1st Cavalry Division, distinguished himself by extraordinary heroism in action against an armed enemy in the vicinity of Yonchon, Korea, on 5 October 1951. Private Beltz' platoon was ordered to attack and secure commanding terrain tenaciously defended by superior enemy forces. Having advanced to within 75 yards of the objective, the platoon was pinned down by intense fire from two enemy machine gun nests and sustained several casualties. On his own initiative, Private Beltz cradled his light machine gun in his arms and advanced on the enemy entrenchments. In spite of the intense fire, seemingly directed only at him, Private Beltz, alone and unaided, dispersed and destroyed the enemy position. As the platoon moved forward to join him, Private Beltz charged the last, slightly lower fringe of terrain from which enemy fire emanated and, with very little ammunition remaining in his belt, successfully dispersed the enemy and secured the objective. In the last stages of the attack, he was mortally wounded by machine gun fire from an adjacent hill. The courageous action and gallant self-sacrifice of Private Beltz inspired his comrades and were in keeping with the highest traditions of the military service.\n\nBenefield, William M. Jr. (posthumous)\n\nHeadquarters, Eighth U.S. Army\n\nGeneral Orders No. 54 - September 6, 1950\n\nThe President of the United States of America, under the provisions of the Act of Congress approved July 9, 1918, takes pride in presenting the Distinguished Service Cross (Posthumously) to Second Lieutenant (Corps of Engineers) William M. Benefield, Jr. (ASN: 0-1685718), United States Army, for extraordinary heroism in connection with military operations against an armed enemy of the United Nations while serving with the 77th Engineer Combat Company, 24th Infantry Regiment, 25th Infantry Division. Second Lieutenant Benefield distinguished himself by extraordinary heroism in action against enemy aggressor forces near Sangju, Korea, on 29 July 1950. On that date, during daylight hours, the 77th Engineer Combat Company received orders to advance against the enemy's position. Information was received on the location of an enemy minefield in the path of the company's advance. Realizing the danger to personnel of the company, Lieutenant Benefield, with complete disregard for his personal safety, went forward alone. Although the area was swept by intense small-arms fire, he advanced to within two-hundred yards of the enemy position and attempted to remove the mine field. During this action Lieutenant Benefield was killed.\n\nBennett, Clyde L. (posthumous)\n\nDepartment of the Army\n\nGeneral Orders No. 102 - 27 November 1951\n\nSergeant Clyde L. Bennett, Armor, United States Army, a tank commander with Company B, 89th Medium Tank Battalion, distinguished himself by extraordinary heroism in action against an armed enemy of the United Nations near Sandokchong-Ni, Korea, on 21 May 1951. Committed to enter a narrow valley to contact and engage the enemy, Sergeant Bennett's platoon was ruthlessly attacked and surrounded by a numerically superior force. During the bitter fighting which ensued, Sergeant Bennett, detecting one of the half-tracks moving slowly because of mechanical failure, placed his tank direct in the path of hostile fire to shield the disabled vehicle and its exposed crew. When the enemy on the hills to his left and right attempted to flank his position, rendering fire from his tank ineffective, Sergeant Bennett left the protective cover of the armored turret and, braving withering hostile fire, fearlessly manned the .50 caliber machine gun mounted on the rear of the deck. Maintaining his stand, Sergeant Bennett delivered accurate fire into the ranks of the enemy until he was mortally wounded. His courageous action retarded the hostile advance, exacted a heavy toll in casualties, and insured the safe withdrawal of friendly forces. Sergeant Bennett's unflinching courage and consummate devotion to duty reflect the highest credit on himself and uphold the finest traditions of the military service.\n\nBennington, Robert W. (posthumous)\n\nHeadquarters, Eighth U.S. Army\n\nGeneral Orders No. 243 - March 16, 1951\n\nThe President of the United States of America, under the provisions of the Act of Congress approved July 9, 1918, takes pride in presenting the Distinguished Service Cross (Posthumously) to Private First Class Robert W. Bennington (ASN: RA-13174309), United States Army, for extraordinary heroism in connection with military operations against an armed enemy of the United Nations while serving as a Browning Automatic Rifleman with Company K, 3d Battalion, 23d Infantry Regiment, 2d Infantry Division. Private First Class Bennington distinguished himself by extraordinary heroism in action against enemy aggressor forces at Hill 189 near Yongsan, Korea, on the night of 15 - 16 September 1950. The defensive positions on Hill 189 were occupied by Private Bennington's unit when, at about 2400 hours the enemy attacked the hill with great force, using machine-guns and other automatic weapons and grenades. Private Bennington, in position on the right flank of his platoon, continued firing into the enemy while the machine-guns of his unit were withdrawn to a secondary position. During this action, he killed an estimated fifty of the enemy and helped to thwart several enemy attempts to overrun this platoon's position. At about 0300 hours on 16 September 1950, when the order to withdraw to higher ground was given, he continued to hold his position and to cover the withdrawal of the remainder of the platoon. He remained in this exposed position, firing upon the enemy, until he was killed by an enemy grenade.\n\nBernard, Carl F.\n\nHeadquarters, Eighth U.S. Army\n\nGeneral Orders No. 45 - January 22, 1951\n\nThe President of the United States of America, under the provisions of the Act of Congress approved July 9, 1918, takes pleasure in presenting the Distinguished Service Cross to Second Lieutenant (Infantry) Carl F. Bernard, United States Army, for extraordinary heroism in connection with military operations against an armed enemy of the United Nations while serving with Company L, 3d Battalion, 21st Infantry Regiment, 24th Infantry Division. Second Lieutenant Bernard distinguished himself by extraordinary heroism in action against enemy aggressor forces near Chochiwon, Korea, on 10 July 1950. On that date, when Company L was attacked by a numerically superior enemy force, supported by armor, Second Lieutenant Bernard, voluntarily and on his own initiative, organized and led a small patrol forward and engaged the enemy tanks, personally destroying two enemy tanks and dispersing two others with accurate 2.36-inch rocket fire. The following morning when his company was ordered to withdraw before an estimated enemy regiment which had encircled their positions, Lieutenant Bernard, single-handedly and with complete disregard for his own safety, attacked with his carbine and hand grenades, an enemy machine gun which was blocking his company's only route of withdrawal. Lieutenant Bernard with extreme calmness advanced through the heavy enemy small-arms fire and killed four enemy soldiers with carbine fire and destroyed the machine gun and crew with hand grenades, opening a route of withdrawal. Lieutenant Bernard then collected stragglers, organizing them into a fighting unit and placed them into new defensive positions to cover the battalion withdrawal. Lieutenant Bernard's aggressive attacks on the enemy tanks and machine-gun emplacement inspired the outnumbered men of his command to fight with him, until out of ammunition, against overwhelming odds. The extraordinary heroism displayed by Lieutenant Bernard reflects great credit on himself and is in keeping with the highest traditions of the military service.\n\nBernotas, John J.\n\nHeadquarters, Eighth U.S. Army\n\nGeneral Orders No. 461 - June 25, 1951\n\nThe President of the United States of America, under the provisions of the Act of Congress approved July 9, 1918, takes pleasure in presenting the Distinguished Service Cross to First Lieutenant (Infantry) John J. Bernotas (ASN: 0-2019414), United States Army, for extraordinary heroism in connection with military operations against an armed enemy of the United Nations while serving with Company L, 3d Battalion, 5th Regimental Combat Team, attached to the 24th Infantry Division. First Lieutenant Bernotas distinguished himself by extraordinary heroism in action against enemy aggressor forces near Aea-ri, Korea, on 6 March 1951. On that date, Lieutenant Bernotas' platoon was given the mission of holding key terrain until the remainder of Company L could move into position. That night his platoon, in position on four hilltops, was attacked by a numerically superior enemy force and split up into small defensive sectors. Lieutenant Bernotas and eight men were cut off on a hill overlooking the intended approach route of the remainder of the company. Under his expert and fearless leadership, the small group fought off encirclement and inflicted heavy casualties on the attacking enemy. When the enemy added reinforcements and it appeared that they were certain to take the commanding terrain, Lieutenant Bernotas adjusted friendly artillery fire on his own positions, thereby completely disrupting the hostile attack. Although wounded twice during this action, he continued to remain in an exposed position and gallantly directed the fire of his troops until reinforcements arrived.\n\nBillings, Frank Bond Jr. (posthumous)\n\nHeadquarters, Far East Command\n\nGeneral Orders No. 74 - November 28, 1950\n\nThe President of the United States of America, under the provisions of the Act of Congress approved July 9, 1918, takes pride in presenting the Distinguished Service Cross (Posthumously) to Private First Class Frank Bond Billings, Jr. (MCSN: 1074062), United States Marine Corps, for extraordinary heroism in connection with military operations against an armed enemy of the United Nations while serving with Company D, Second Battalion, Fifth Marines, First Provisional Marine Brigade (Reinforced), Fleet Marine Force, Pacific, in action against enemy aggressor forces at Yongsan, Korea, on 3 September 1950. While his company was pinned down by rifle and heavy machine gun fire near the top of a hill, Private Billings, with complete disregard for his personal safety, fearlessly moved forward alone, drawing fire from two enemy machine- guns that were holding up the company's advance. Although exposed to intense enemy fire, he coolly and methodically killed the enemy one by one as they attempted to man their guns, accounting for eight dead and two machine-guns out of action. When his platoon had advanced to join him, other enemy machine- guns opened fire. Unable to locate them, Private Billings again and on his own initiative, courageously crawled forward alone. While marking the enemy positions for his comrades with bursts from his own weapon, he was killed by enemy machine-gun fire.\n\nGeneral Orders: General Headquarters Far East Command: General Orders No. 74 (November 28, 1950)\n\nBlair, Melvin Russell (2nd award)\n\nHeadquarters, Eighth U.S. Army\n\nGeneral Orders No. 31 - January 18, 1951\n\nThe President of the United States of America, under the provisions of the Act of Congress approved July 9, 1918, takes pleasure in presenting a Bronze Oak Leaf Cluster in lieu of a Second Award of the Distinguished Service Cross to Major (Infantry) Melvin Russell Blair, United States Army, for extraordinary heroism in connection with military operations against an armed enemy of the United Nations while serving as Commanding Officer of the 3d Battalion, 24th Infantry Regiment, 25th Infantry Division. Major Blair distinguished himself by extraordinary heroism in action against enemy aggressor forces near Haman, Korea, on 14 and 15 September 1950. On 14 September 1950, when one of his companies lost all but one of its officers, Major Blair, realizing the need for inspiring leadership, joined the hard-hit unit. From 1400 until 0800 the following morning he inspired the men of the company to new determinations by his many heroic and courageous acts. He led one platoon in a successful counterattack upon its old position and then covered its withdrawal when the position became untenable. Organizing a perimeter of defense with forty to fifty men, Major Blain inspired them by word and deed to hold this position despite four banzai attacks by over four hundred enemy troops until almost all of their ammunition had been expended. He covered the disengagement of the company with six men during which action he was ambushed and wounded in the leg; yet he supported the covering party to fight their way out of the ambush. By staying with the covering party despite his wounds and the intense enemy fire, Major Blain assured that the main body and the wounded were able to withdraw safely. The sight of the battalion commander facing death with them constantly inspired the reluctant to stay and fight with new found determination.\n\nBlesse, Frederick Corbin\n\nGeneral Orders - Special Orders GB-064 - December 3, 1998\n\nHQ Department of the Air Force\n\nThe President of the United States of America, authorized by Act of Congress, July 9, 1918 (amended by act of July 25, 1963), takes pleasure in presenting the Distinguished Service Cross to Major Frederick Corbin Blesse, United States Air Force, for extraordinary heroism in connection with military operations against an armed enemy of the United Nations while serving as Pilot of an F-86 Fighter Airplane of the 334th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron, 4th Fighter-Interceptor Wing, FAR EAST Air Forces, in action against enemy forces in the Republic of Korea on 8 September 1952. Leading a flight of four F-86s protecting fighter-bombers from possible attack by enemy MIGs, Major Blesse positioned his flight for an attack on four sighted MIGs. Singling out one of the MIGs, Major Blesse followed it up into an overcast and broke out between layers of clouds. As the two aircraft emerged from the clouds, Major Blesse was still in position, so he closed and fired, causing the MIG to burst into flames and the pilot to eject himself. Major Blesse then sighted a lone MIG, and positioned himself for another attack. The MIG began violent, evasive maneuvers, but through superior airmanship Major Blesse scored hits, causing the MIG to snap and spin. Major Blesse followed closely until the MIG recovered. He then scored hits with another long burst which caused the pilot to eject himself. Through his courage, keen flying ability and devotion to duty, Major Blesse reflected great credit upon himself, the Far East Air Forces, and the Untied States Air Force.\n\nBoisvenue, John P.
