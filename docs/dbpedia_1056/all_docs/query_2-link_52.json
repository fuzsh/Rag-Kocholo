He started at a two-hours' notice, and rode 55 miles through a very disturbed country to Taindak, where he took command of the small body of men who relieved the beleaguered garrison\".

He was killed in action 18 February 1900, when leading a forlorn hope at Paardeberg. Lieutenant W H Fife, 2nd Duke of Cornwall's Light Infantry (who was himself killed soon afterwards by a spent bullet), wrote of Lieutenant Colonel Aldworth: \"I can only say that he was the most gallant soldier I shall ever see, or wish to see, and it was owing to his splendid example that we advanced so steadily when others refused to budge. I would willingly have been killed instead of him, as I could have easily been replaced, and he cannot. I can only add that those who saw the advance said it was magnificent, and, though it has been called the Cornwalls' and the Canadians' charge, it was the Cornwalls' charge only, and Colonel Aldworth's charge in particular. His loss is quite irretrievable. He was hit in the forehead just as he had said: 'Come on, Dukes! Come on, Cornwalls!' He fell, but, raising himself on his elbow, added: 'Go on men, and finish it!'\" In a long list of recommendations in 1901, Lord Roberts added Lieutenant Colonel Aldworth, DSO, Commanding the 2nd Battalion Duke of Cornwall's Light Infantry, as one whom he would specially have selected for reward, and he wrote in a private letter to Miss Aldworth, dated 17 March, 1901: \"When I submitted to Her Majesty's Government a list of names of officers who had rendered ' conspicuously valuable services' before their death, I felt that the list would be incomplete unless it included that of your brother, Lieutenant Colonel Aldworth. At Paardeberg he led his men under a withering fire with a courage and devotion which elicited admiration of all who witnessed it, and he died with his face to the foe, like a gallant Irish gentleman... \". A writer in an Indian paper said: \"Lieutenant Colonel Aldworth, DSO, was one of the finest horsemen and most successful jockeys that India has ever seen. He could train a horse as well as ride one\". In May 1877, he and a brother officer walked from Hyde Park Corner to Portsmouth, 76 miles, and several miles more by mistake— started at 6 p.m and arrived between 7 and 8 pm (25 hours).
