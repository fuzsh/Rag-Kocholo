        "text": "All posts by Dipanwita\n\nHello there! I am Dipanwita Chakraborty from India. Let's call me Dipi for everyone else's ease. I am a perpetual daydreamer wanting to explore the world at my own pace. Nothing cheers me up as well as a good book and a cup of strong coffee. When not at my work desk that pays my travel bills, you would either find me planning and researching new places to travel or writing about my recent travels. I focus on solo budget travel with a keenness for immersive and local experiences, and strongly promote responsible and sustainable travel. My love for sunsets, mountains, waterfalls, talking to locals and trotting through local markets goes beyond expression. You would find the “How to” guides and unbiased reviews about destinations and properties here along with narratives about my rendezvous with the world.\n\nWhen The Sun Turns Cold\n\nIt’s time to go back home\n\nIt’s time for the sun to lay cold\n\nIt’s time sleep takes over all strife\n\nIt’s time love settles\n\nIn hearts of the wandering souls\n\nLet me borrow a pinch of the peach and red\n\nLet me slather a dash of hue that’s gold\n\nBefore the sun goes down and turns cold.\n\nMonsoon, Sahyadris And Treks\n\nI could see them changing shades. At 37,000 feet, sitting by the window and flying through them as the airplane sashayed above the Sahyadris. My lips curved into a broad smile. The clouds had started loitering all over Sahyadris, ready to defeat the gory summer heat. Its time. Time to go trekking and soak in the resplendence of the Sahyadris.\n\nSo what’s so special about those short weekend treks during monsoon?\n\nThe best part is, you don’t need to sulk and worry about unavailability of leaves. You could just hop around during weekends. Plus, there are couple of more reasons.\n\nFirstly, if you are a pluviophile, you won’t need to hunt for reasons to get drenched. Secondly, treks are one of the best ways to stay fit and healthy (both mentally and physically). That takes care of your obsession of shedding those extra pounds gained while you gorged on all sinful stuff throughout the week. And lastly, you get to explore the unexplored; you come to know about places that might have been a trivia for you until today and places you thought never even existed.\n\nView From Andharban Trails\n\nIf you thought trekking was for some aliens and people from different planet altogether, give your thoughts a strong shudder. Look around when you go for those romantic long drives during monsoon, crossing the valleys, glaring at the waterfalls and wishing, if only you could touch the water or bathe under one.\n\nWhy only wish? Why not live those wishes?\n\nThere is much more to Sahyadris than usual visits to those dams and waterfalls (from distant) on weekends when people from every nook and corner of the city are hopping towards the quotidian. Instead, do things that you might not have dreamt of doing and feel the rush of adventure in your blood.\n\nThe Horse-Shoe Waterfall\n\nGet mesmerized by view of Duke’s Nose, The Horse Shoe Waterfall, The breadth of Lonavla from Rajmachi. Submerge yourself under the waterfall by Kondane Caves. Revere the beauty of dark while traversing through the dense Andharban forest. Experience the quiver of elevations while climbing the 800steep rock cut stairs of Harihar fort.\n\nThe Thrilling Harihar Fort\n\nStand atop Korigad fort and have a look at the green lawn spread across Pune. Hop on to the peak of Kalawantin Fort and take a look around, spot Irshalgad, Shrimallang, Matheran, Vikatgad and Mahuli among various other forts.\n\nKalawantin Fort- View from Prabalgad\n\nThe trail to Naneghat would never fail to enchant you with it’s most distinguished charm. Consider yourself lucky when you get to see “The Indravajra” from atop Konkankada (a rare phenomenon called Brocken Spectre) when you trek to Harishchandragad.\n\nTrail to Naneghat\n\nTrek to Bhimashankar and you earmark your endurance levels. Meditate under the waterfall of Gupt Bhimashankar. Summit Mount Kalsubai and you can brag about conquering the highest peak of Maharashtra.\n\nMeditate under Gupt Bhimashankar Waterfall\n\nSave yourselves from getting blown away by the fierce wind while traversing through the ridges of Ghanchakkar and Bhairavgad. Wake up early, sit by the caves of Ratangad and if you are an ardent artist, you get to view the most beautiful portray of Bandardhara presented by nature herself.\n\nView from Ratangad Caves- Just before Sunrise\n\nDrink from the water cisterns, bathe in the fresh water streams, swing along the giant creepers and walk through the clouds. Rappel down the gushing waterfalls of Vihi and Bhivpuri.\n\nWaterfall Rappeling- Vihi Waterfall\n\nGo south and trek along the railway tracks of Goa to behold the might of Dudhsagar waterfall. Traverse through the jungle and take a dip in the Tambdi Surla Waterfall near Kulem, Goa. Beware of the leeches, they can get inside your shoes anytime. However, that’s the last thing you should worry about.\n\nThe mighty Doodhsagar Falls- Goa\n\nPondering upon the thought on how to go ahead for these short and worry-less weekend trips? Well, all you need to do is, visit the websites below and you won’t need to ask for more. The trek groups mentioned below would help you out. You may select a group based on the convenience of your location.\n\nMonsoon is at its peak and before it bids adieu, gear up, pack your bags with monsoon essentials, grab good trekking shoes and voila, you are all set.\n\nHappy Monsoon. Aloha.\n\nThe pictures are sourced from Arun Kumar Dash, Sandesh Chalke and Google.\n\nShare your thoughts with me at dipanwiita@gmail.com"
