Mapping the opportunity of the launch of one of the most awaited movies of the year- Avatar: The Way of Water, DaMENSCH conceptualized and executed its ad which talks about its conscious fashion which recycles plastic to make polos because polos look good in a polo avatar, not in the bottom of the ocean.\n\nIn today's day and age where people are bombarded with advertisements more than ever before, it is imperative to break the clutter by curating content that matches the pulse of the brand. If moment marketing is all about being at the right place at the right time, then this seems to be a masterclass at it. The 15-seconder that inspires the conscious young generation to choose FASHION THAT THINKS has been coordinated to leverage the larger conversation that the movie is driving on consciousness.\n\nTalking about this move, Deepti Karthik, Senior Vice President, Marketing, DaMENSCH, said “Moment marketing is about capturing a topical content and driving the brand message effectively. We believe the conscious fashion narrative that DaMENSCH has been driving gets leveraged even more effectively when combined with the impact of the mindset that one is in while watching a movie like Avatar- the way of water.\n\n2700 Ltrs of water is how much one saves when they choose to buy a DaMENSCH bamboo vest, 50% less energy gets consumed because we use high IQ dyes and 4 fewer plastic bottles go to ocean when we recycle them to make our polos.”\n\nDaMENSCH is constantly in pursuit of innovating men’s essential wear. In the pursuit of a world, where everyone’s potential is unlocked to do more, every single day. Started in 2018, DaMENSCH is a D2C brand that caters to the men’s premium essential wear fashion segment in India. DaMENSCH envisions to become a lifestyle brand that will become an integral part of every global Indian’s wardrobe. Every product designed by DaMENSCH Product lab, from innerwear to loungewear is infused with innovation never seen before.\n\nThe brand is driven by a purpose to make the world a better place, by doing more every day, for the customers and nature. DaMENSCH is committed to earth-friendly and slow fashion, as reflected in its packaging made of corn and paper that’s 100% biodegradable.\n\nIf you haven't yet seen the ad, you can watch it here...\n\nTurtlemint, India’s leading Insurtech platform has collaborated with Actor, Model and Fitness icon Milind Soman, for the ‘Green Ride 2.0 – Ek Pehal Swacch Hawa ki or’ initiative.

Noted director Sagar Sarhadi who directed Bazar with Smita Patil and Naseeruddin Shah was the recipient of the award in 2019.\n\nSaeed Akhtar Mirza started his career as a documentary film maker in 1976, graduating to films with the acclaimed Arvind Desai Ki Ajeeb Dastaan (1978), about the frustrations of an idealistic youth caught in the trap of a feudal money culture. It won the Filmfare Critics Award for Best Movie for the year. This was followed by Albert Pinto Ko Gussa Kyoon Aata Hai (1980), about an angry youth, in search of his class and ethnic identifications. This too won the Filmfare Critics Award for Best Movie. Next in this series of his based on the urban middle class, came his satire on the Indian judicial system, Mohan Joshi Hazir Ho! (1984), an old couple which struggles for years in their legal case that runs for years under a corrupt judiciary, in nexus with real-estate developer. Set in the urban ‘middle class’, his film chronicled their struggles and search of identity in a rapidly changing landscape and economic conditions. Then finally in his angst-ridden movies came, Salim Langde Pe Mat Ro (1989), starring Pawan Malhotra, an archetypal Muslim youth caught in the circle of crime and recrimination, and their collective state amidst growing communalism, ghetto mentality, and a search for an ethnic identity which does not clash with a national identity.\n\nMeanwhile, he directed and produced popular TV serials Nukkad (Street Corner) (1986) and Intezaar (Wait) (1988), the first was set in lower middle class of various communities, which meet at a street corner in Mumbai suburb, shared their struggle of everyday survival in a harsh world, and was a big hit. He has lectured widely on Indian cinema at universities in India and The US. He contributes regularly to Indian newspapers and magazines on current political debates and through film reviews.\n\nHis last film Naseem was released way in 1995 set in collapsing secular structure post Babri Masjid demolition era. The film was featured in Avijit Ghosh's book, 40 Retakes, Bollywood Classics you May Have Missed. After that as he put it, \"The demolition of the Babri Masjid was the last straw. Naseem was almost like an epitaph. After the film, I had really nothing to say. I needed to regain my faith and retain my sanity. So I decided to travel around India and document it on a video camera\". Subsequently he devoted his time to travelling, writing and making documentaries. Later started on his autobiographical work,[6] finally released in 2008, as his maiden novel named Ammi: Letter to a Democratic Mother which is about the memories of his mother who died in 1990 and a series of vignettes comprising Sufi fables, childhood memories.\n\nSaeed Akhtar Mirza is the life member of International Film And Television Club of Asian Academy of Film & Television. Currently he is making film, Ek Tho Chance.\n\nDeepsense Digital partnering with their Indian homegrown footwear client Walkaroo had launched a social media campaign coined #GuessKaroo. The campaign featured renowned celebrity, Aamir Khan who is Bollywood’s Perfectionist.\n\nDeepsense Digital won the mandate for Walkaroo in the last quarter of 2021 and launched their much-awaited campaign. The campaign execution was to create hype around the TVC, create a buzz by asking the users to answer the right options, and drive the users to the TVC on YouTube.\n\nThe way TVCs were shot conveys the brand's purpose in a way that people can relate to. The TVC with its elements of quirkiness had a huge upside potential of going viral when combined with the right strategy. To create hype around the TVC, the brand created a buzz by asking the users to answer the right options and driving the users to the TVC on YouTube. It gave the impression of direct participation of the public and having a say in what Aamir spoke in the TVC scenes. People can #GuessKaroo on what the actor will enact in the following scenes through this promotion.\n\nWinners of the campaign were gratified with Walkaroo coupon codes and answers were revealed by playing the full TVC on the pages.\n\nThe outcome of this campaign was a huge success, as it reached multiple people which helped us in mass consumer engagement and brand credibility. During the Facebook, Instagram and YouTube promotions, the company invested Rs 1 Lakh and gained an impressive ROI, and overall Facebook & Instagram achieved impressions of 24,17,521.\n\nDebutante filmmaker Ishrat R Khan's feature film Guthlee Ladoo has made it to the prestigious 27th Kolkata International Film Festival (KIFF). Premiered on April 26th at Nandan, Kolkat; Guthlee Ladoo is screened in the Indian Language Competition section. The first ever Bundeli language film to go to any film festival, Ishrat Khan is elated over his film’s entry into KIFF and feels proud to represent Bundelkhand and especially Bundeli language in a festival that’s acclaimed internationally. “This is my debut film and I am happy that Guthlee has made its way to the KIFF this year. Same time, I'm elated that Guthlee is also being premiered at Cameroon International Film Festival on the same dates.\n\nIshrat started his innings assisting renowned director like Anees Bazmee with whom he graduated from 1st Ad to the associate director in a span of time. Some of the movies that he assisted Anees includes Welcome Back, Thank You, No Problem, Welcome, Sandwich, No Entry and Deewangee. Later he went on to associate with Raaj Shaandilyaa for Dream Girl, Prerna Wadhawan for Ishqeria and Amberdeep Singh for Lahoriye.\n\nHowever it’s quite unnatural of someone to venture into such a hard hitting domain about the state of education and the caste system in rural India in today's age when he has majorly been involved with comedies. Normally anyone would have preferred doing something that they have mastered in, but Ishrat not only chose to be different but also preferred dealing in a subject that was not the mainstream language - Hindi. Ishrat says, “I understand that’s how anyone would have done it. However, I wanted my debut to stand out on the marquee. We are premiering it at KIFF and plans are afoot to take it to Cannes and other major festivals across the globe including Toronto, London and others.\"\n\nWith over 20 years of experience in Bollywood, Ishrat Khan is considered one of the most efficient film makers of this era. His attention to detail, thorough pre-production & clear vision sets him apart, which can be seen in Guthlee. With a simple to seem storyline, the film is multi-layered. It’s about Guthlee, the son of a poor sweeper, has a dream - to go to school. But the major obstacle is his caste. A headmaster is sympathetic to him but powerless against caste discrimination. When they develop an unspoken bond, Guthlee's dream sees hope.\n\nSpeaking about the film, Ishrat says, “Guthlee is a film that speaks volumes about the state of education and the caste system in rural India in today's age. Of course, there have been massive improvements in this respect by the government, but still there are untold stories that highlight the plight of the lower caste people and their inability to get education for their children. This film is an attempt to bring this matter to the forefront. It's a story of a small boy, son of a low caste sweeper, who wants to go to school. The film has been treated realistically, so as to make the viewer’s feel the rustic reality of a north Indian village. The film does not try to portray any of the higher caste people in a negative light, it's not an attempt to antagonize, but rather to make people think about the fact that something that is so easy for us to provide to our children - a school education - can remain an unfulfilled dream for so many deserving children just because they belong to low castes.”\n\nProduced by Pradeep Rangwani under the banner of UV Films, Guthlee Ladoo features an ensemble cast that includes Sanjay Mishra, Subrat Dutta, Kalyanee Mulay and Dhanay Seth in the titular role. The film has been shot by Anil Akki and edited by Steven H. Bernard. Amar Mohile has provided the background score for the movie.\n\nIndulge in the world of hues to partner your impeccable style, with the launch of Lip Liner and Filler from Manish Malhotra Beauty exclusively by MyGlamm.

Anurag stated that he had a very unpleasant lockdown in 2020 & 2021. He faced a lot of health issues and also had to go through an angioplasty. He had weight issues due to improper diet and routine, and to reset he took 15 days of unwinding wellness and relaxing at Atmantan Wellness Centre, making the most of their wellness offerings and doctor-prescribed therapies for his complete holistic well-being.\n\nWishing to attain ultimate relaxation, Anurag was seen engaging in clean-eating, experiencing a complete detox-led diet, and therapies/treatments to attain his wellness objective. Known to create the best wellness experience for their customers, the doctors and wellness staff at Atmantan ensured that Anurag was well taken care of and as expected left on an extremely happy note looking forward to coming back for a longer stay.\n\nAnurag took to Atmantans social media and said in his experience. “I went through this daily process starting early in the morning with Kriya, following with massages, yoga, swimming, walking up to the mountains, it's a beautiful climate here and clean air. I have not just lost 6 to 7 kilos but my whole body has reset. I am fresh and energetic and I am looking forward to work and I am back to where I was before the lockdown happened. And it's all because of this place and it's been a magical experience. The service is incredible, the food is delicious and you learn to eat correct portions. You learn alot about your body, what to do and what not to do. There are so many things we are not aware of living our hectic lives that I have discovered and found out here. And I hope to follow through. This has been a beautiful experience at Atmantan and I recommend and think that everybody should seriously do one of these health retreats where you go through Ayurveda, yoga, naturopathy and a healthy diet. It really changes your system, head to toe.\"\n\nAtmantan is one of India’s most luxurious wellness centers and is proving to be the most convenient and approachable getaway destination due to its location in Mulshi, only a 3-hour drive from Mumbai. A 42-acre property, it sits atop a crystal hill & overlooks the pristine Mulshi Lake. Its land bestows healing frequencies to all on it and this complements perfectly with the wellness the guests seek here. Atmantan is an integrated wellness destination and is one of India’s most luxurious and result-oriented wellness centers that provides lifestyle enhancement, disease reversal, and result-oriented transformations to all its guests. ‘Atmantan’ in its name and essence is the holistic amalgamation of Atma (soul), mana (mind) & tann (body).\n\nIndia's leading NBFC Muthoottu Mini Financiers Limited’s powerful portrayal of a woman protagonist in its latest commercial has taken the internet by storm and has got the netizens talking about it.\n\nWith over 2 million views in youtube itself (Malayalam and Hindi) and counting, the newly launched commercial film's storyline centering around a confident young woman rocking the social status-quo is driving conversations on social media.\n\nHelmed by award-winning director Martin Prakkat and magnificently captured by celebrated cinematographer Jomon T. John, this masterpiece was shot at some of the most picturesque locales in Ladakh. The duo, true to their reputation, has brilliantly articulated and captured the controlled emotions of the protagonist, her sly suitor's expectations and the bonding she shares with her open-minded progressive father, sans cliched theatrics or verbatim.\n\nThe strategically thought ad brings the essence of women to focus, not conforming to expectations, or letting barriers to their dreams, get in the way – as mirrored by a soul-stirring drive through the limitless expanse of the Ladakh.\n\nThe film goes on to establish a strong message that no dreams are beyond a woman's reach if she is focused, has strong convictions backed by a like-minded and progressive-thinking partner. This storytelling perfectly aligns with the brand Muthoottu Mini's slogan - Standing by you, always.\n\nSpeaking at the sidelines of the launch of the new commercial, Mr. Mathew Muthoottu, Managing Director, Muthoottu Mini Financiers Limited said, “we are thrilled and ecstatic at the overwhelming response to our new commercial which encourages women to dream and calls for shattering cultural stereotyping of women. The film makes a bold attempt to dispel outdated societal myths still in vogue and the need to bring-in a paradigm shift in our attitude towards women. Being a socially responsible company, with strong values, we are extremely proud in rooting for a socially relevant cause. Time has come to address challenges faced by women and stress on the importance of increased participation of women in mainstream activities, be it socio-cultural-politico-economical. We urge women of today to dream, stay financially independent and go places. Rest assured, we, the Muthoottu Mini, will stand by you always\"\n\nIf you haven't yet watched the ad, watch it here...\n\nThe 27th edition of the Kolkata International Film Festival, which was slated for January 7-14, has been postponed. The next date of the festival will be shared soon said the KIFF organising team. However, it was only yesterday, the organizing committee had announced that the 27th edition of the KIFF will go on albeit with a 50% capacity in cinema halls and a virtual inauguration ceremony. However, due to the current surge in Covid-19 cases across Bengal, especially in Kolkata, the festival has been postponed temporarily.\n\nThe decision was announced by the West Bengal government through a statement. A number of Tollywood personalities attached to the organizing committee have tested positive over the past few days and the Covid-19 situation in Bengal is in quite an alarming state right now. While filmmaker Raj Chakraborty, the chairperson of 27th KIFF, had tested positive for Covid-19 for the second time, Actor Parambrata Chattopadhyay, chairperson of KIFF's short and documentary section has also tested positive as he revealed on social media.\n\nHowever, it was only on Tuesday, West Bengal Minister of State for Culture Indranil Sen had told the media that 10 venues across the city will host this year's film festival with a 50% occupancy. But now, after assessing the current situation the state government and the KIFF organizing committee have decided to cancel it for the time being. The ten venues which were supposed to screen the films were Nandan's three halls, Rabindra Sadan, Sisir Mancha, Nazrul Tirtha, Rabindra Okakura Bhavan, Chalachitra Satabarsha Bhavan, and the Kolkata Information Centre Conference Hall. A total of 161 films, including 46 Indian and 41 foreign films, were supposed to be screened during the 8-day film festival.\n\nWhen contacted KIFF officials said, “After assessing the present Covid situation of the State and taking into consideration the possibility of further contamination of Covid among the cine lovers and citizens and also owing to the fact that a number of cine personalities attached to film festival committee and many others have been affected by Covid, State Government, upon careful consideration to the safety of the citizens have decided to temporarily postpone the 27th Kolkata International Film Festival scheduled to be held between 7-14 January, 2022. Next date of the Festival will be communicated in due course.”\n\nWest Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee was supposed to inaugurate the film festival virtually from the Nabanna auditorium. Satyajit Ray's Aranyer Din Ratri was scheduled to be the opening film this year.\n\nWith the 3rd wave of Covid Guidelines in force by the West Bengal Government, most of the film screening events are either being postponed or are being conducted online. It was but natural of Evevntizer - the organisers of International Kolkata Short Film Festival to follow suit. However, the team has instead decided to postpone the event than conclude it online. Seeking to impress the cinephiles with a myriad of shorts and documentaries from the best of creative minds across the globe, the 2nd edition of International Kolkata Short Film Festival is one sought after festival that the makers and the audiences are keenly looking forward to.\n\nAccording to the Festival Chairman Sourav Chakraborty, \"Due to the development of the 3rd wave of COVID-19 Pandemic, and the restrictions imposed by the Government of West Bengal; we, with our responsibility towards the state and due to the lack of a festive environment have postponed all the events of the International Kolkata Short Film Festival 2022. While the online screening of the Short Films has been rescheduled from 5th March to 12th March, the Physical Screening and Award Ceremony has been rescheduled to 13th March 2022.\"\n\nA hybrid festival organised by Eventizer, the festival will flag off with online screening on its website from 5th March to 12th March, 2022. The week-long fete will feature international documentaries, short fiction and non-fiction, animation as well as public service films. As decided, the festival will also have a physical screening followed by an award ceremony on 13th March 2022 at Rotary Sadan, Kolkata.\n\nAccording to an official of the IKSFF, the hybrid event is being conducted keeping in mind the Covid protocols and in adherence of the same. However, with so many wonderful films by talented young makers making its way to the festival, the authorities also planned to have a one day closing program with the Awards presentation to honour them for their work and to celebrate their talent.\n\nThe online event will be a paid event, for the audiences to watch all the selected films at their own sweet time from the comforts of their home. “It will be one of the major cultural showcases for audiences from any part of the globe as they would no longer need to be physically available to savour the best of films showcased at the festival,” confirmed the source.\n\nSome of the films that are officially selected this year have come all the way from Argentina, Australia, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, Denmark, Dominican Republic, France, Germany, Iran, Italy, Japan, Pakistan, Portugal, Sri Lanka, Taiwan, Turkey, UAE, UK and the USA.
