President Pranab Mukherjee WBBm pip . tr PRESIDENT REPUBLIC OF INDIA FOREWORD Indra Dhanush, our in-house cultural series, seeks to showcase the richness and magnificence of Indian art and culture. 1 1 is an ode to a timeless and treasured cultural legacy, representing both continuity and change. Conceptualised for the first time in the year 2002, it has now been given a new dimension and a more concrete structure and form with its own distinctive logo. Our national bird die peacock which now symbolises Indra Dhanush represents, in the true sense, the diversity, uniqueness and brilliance of India’s performing arts and music. Indra Dhanush to us at Rashtrapati Bhavan represents a way of life through it we seek to present and preserve India’s cultural heritage dating back several millennia. This initiative not only enables distinguished performers and artistes to exhibit their body of work, it also gives both connoisseurs and the general public an opportunity to partake their brilliance. I have been privileged to play host to a galaxy of maestros over the last two years. They have uplifted our souls and enriched our living experience with a display of perhaps the finest music and dance performances anywhere in the world. From die iconic Ramayana, to the mellifluous strains of Pandit Hariprasad Chaurasia’s bansuri, to the rare and ancient art form of kutiyattam, recognised by UNESCO as part of the world’s intangible oral heritage, Rashtrapati Bhavan has since August 2012 witnessed an array of memorable performances. I am delighted that these are being captured and documented for posterity in the first volume of the multi-volume series on Rashtrapati Bhavan, tilled Indra Dhanush. I wish the volume and the series well. (Pranab Muklierjee) 20 July 2014 PREFACE: Not a Presidential Palace but a Peoples’ Heritage The term of the current Presidency started on 25 July 2012. The Hon’ble President had, at that time, conveyed that over the next live years, he would like to build on and take forward the contributions of each of his predecessors in placing Rashtrapati Bhavan at die centre stage of India’s socio-political landscape. Another priority for him was to demystify Rashtrapati Bhavan in the eyes of the general public. Idle idea was to make them experience it not as a Presidential Palace hut as an inalienable part of their history and culture. Various steps have since been initiated to preserve the rich historical, cultural and social legacy of Rashtrapati Rhavan. There has been a concerted effort towards increased public outreach and bringing Rashtrapati Bhavan, and its functioning, closer to the public. Thus, while on the one hand, Rashtrapati Bhavan has been opened for public access on three days of the week and the visiting hours extended, on the other, steps are being taken to conserve and restore this monument as a living heritage and as an inextricable part of Indian history. An important initiative has been the preparation of a Comprehensive Conservation Management Plan (CCMP) by the Indian National Trust for Arts and Cultural Heritage (INTACH), to lay the blueprint for future interventions in the President’s Estate.

Il was felt that while, at present, there are several stand¬ alone publications on Rashtrapati Bhavan, there is no authentic, officially documented narrative with an underlying, unifying theme and perspective. In that context, it was decided to commission a multi-volume series on various aspects of this one-of-its kind monument, in collaboration with the Indira Gandhi National Centre for Arts (IGNCA). The present volume on cultural life and performances in Rashtrapati Bhavan, titled Indra Dhanush, is the first in the series which shall comprise, amongst others, volumes on the President s Bodyguard, Presidential Retreats, Landscape and Architecture, Interiors and Artworks, Kitchens, Dining and Entertaining and Flora and Fauna. Demographicallv, India today is one of the youngest countries in the world and recognising this, there is going to he an illustrated childrens book, as part of this series, for our future generations. The entire series will adopt a thematic and interdisciplinary approach with a view to relating all parts to the w hole. I would also emphasise that Rashtrapati Bhavan is at the centre of a diverse heritage. It is one of the greatest architectural landmarks of the modern era, with a unique synthesis of eastern and western influences. It represents a historical setting in the establishment of modern South Asian nations and is a meeting ground for Heads of State and other XI dignitaries. As the office-cum-residence of the Head of the Indian State, it is a venue par excellence for State functions and ceremonies. A site with landscaped gardens, great bio-diversity and a rich cultural tradition, this architectural masterpiece has a legacy which promises to he both a researcher’s and storyteller’s delight. I have no doubt that as these volumes unfold over the next three years, they will substantially enrich our understanding of Indian history and public life. Indra Dhanush, our in-house cultural series, embodies the concept of India’s cultural heritage being presented before the Head of State in his role, albeit informal, as the patron of arts and culture. The present volume is a compendium of music, dance and cinematic events organised at Rashtrapati Bhavan since August 2012. Through Indra Dhanush we seek to present maestros of various art forms every month. Music, fiance and cinema play a definitive part in the making of our national identity and Rashtrapati Bhavan has been a great meeting point for musicians, dancers and filmmakers to showcase their works. President's Bodyguard with the Mauryan Bull Capital made of polished sandstone The President had launched in December 2013 a Writers and Artists in-Residence initiative to welcome creative people to Rashtrapati Bhavan and enable them to experience life here. Yishy Doma Bhutia, Dr. Vempalli Gangadhar, Rahool Saksena and Pratap Sudhir Morey are the first set of artists and writers whom we would be welcoming to Rashtrapati Bhavan this September to share, partake and enrich our way of life. During the course of the current Presidency, we have had the pleasure of hosting performers such as Hari Prasad Chaurasia, Girija Devi, Shiv Kumar Sharma, Abdul Rashid Khan and Shubha Mudgal, to name a few. Their performances have been appreciated by artists, critics and members of the general public alike. There also has been iconic cinema on display by way of screenings of movies such as Lincoln and Mandela— Long Walk to Freedom. This rich cultural mosaic has XII LEFT: Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko of Japan with President Pranab Mukherjee and his daughter Sharmishtha Mukherjee at the Rashtrapati Bhavan; RIGHT: President Mukherjee enjoying a walk in the Mughal Gardens in full bloom now been documented and contextualised in the present volume, with perceptive essays that trace the development of music, dance and cinema in the context of our national history. It is my earnest desire and hope that this volume, and l lie others that follow, shall present a vibrant, ringside view of life at Rashtrapati Bhavan. Omita Paul Secretary to the President 20 July 2014 Rashtrapati Bhavan, New Delhi XIII THE PERFORMING ARTS AT RASHTRAPATI RHAVAN: A Chronicle Siddharth Sharma The performing arts have been an integral part of Indian identity and culture. They display amazing depth, richness and diversity, developed over several millennia. Traditionally, these arts found patronage and flourished under enlightened rulers who themselves, at times, were great exponents of music and dance. This role has in modern times, been largely taken over by the State through government funding of art institutions. THE EARLY YEARS Successive Indian Presidents, as Heads of the Republic, have encouraged performers and artistes to display their talent and carve out a pan-Indian identity for themselves. Rashtrapati Bhavan’s engagement with the performing arts has been both substantive and multi- dimensional. As early as 1949, an Exhibition of Indian Art, jointly organised by the Royal Academy, London, with the cooperation of the Governments of India and die United Kingdom, was brought to India and displayed at the Rashtrapati Bhavan.This event ultimately resulted in the creation of the National Museum that was inaugurated by the then Governor General, C Rajgopalachari, on 15 August 1949. 1 President Rajendra Prasad and Prime Minister Jaw aharlal Nehru with members of a cultural troupe in 1951 The f irst President of India, Dr Rajendra Prasad, started the practice of inviting leading musicians and dancers to Rashtrapati Bhavan and honoring them. Among the early musicians so honoured were Omkarnath Thakur, Mushtaq Husain Khan, Nisar Husain Khan, Ravi Shankar, Bismillah Khan, Vilayat Khan and Rukmini Devi, to name a few. As die Head of State, he bestowed the Padma Awards and the Sangeet NatakAkademi (SNA) Awards on artistes every year. After a gap the SNA Awards have been brought back to Rashtrapati Bhavan during the current Presidency. Sarod maestro Amjad Ali Khan fondly recalls a Padma Awards reception where his father Ustad Haafiz Ali Khan, asked of President Rajendra Prasad to “save raga Darbari. This disarming entreaty was in response to the President’s query, “ khan Sahcib main aap ke liya kya karsakta boon?\" (“Khan Sabah, what can l do for you?”). Amjad Ali Khan further recounts: “My father told Prasad that being the President, you have to look after everything, but you have to preserve and protect the purity of raga Darbari. My father was very happy and he later told my mother very innocently that the President has promised that he will protect raga Darbari.” Artistes like MS Subbulakshmi, Ravi Shankar and Indrani Rahman were among the early performers to present their art at Rashtrapati Bhavan. Dr Radhakrishnan and Dr Zakir ? Husain were particularly interested in the arts and would make it a point to invite musicians and dancers for performances. Bharatanatyam and kuchipudi danseuse Yamini Krishnamurti, kathak diva Uma Sharma, sarod maestro Amjad Ali Klian, veteran vocalist Pandit Jasraj performed at Rashtrapati Bhavan more than once during die 1970s and 80s. INDRA DHANUSPPTHE FIRST COMING fhe practice of presenting renowned artistes at Rashtrapati Bhavan received further impetus during President APJ Abdul Kalam’s time. The forerunner to I lie present Indra Dhanush series was flagged off on 27 December 2002 with an hourdong concert by Pandit Jasraj. A galaxy of maestros such as Shiv Kumar Sharma, Amjad Ali khan, Zakir Hussain, Jagjit Singh, Bombay Jayashri and TM Krishna performed at Rashtrapati Bhavan from 2002 to 2007. The coup d' grace was the performance on 4 March 2006 of the legendary shehnai maestro Bismillah Khan, accompanied by Soma Ghosh. The performance, staged at t he beautifi d M ugh al Gardens, was his last public performance. We lost this incomparable Bharat Ratna shortly after, leaving an unimaginable void in India’s cultural space. INDRA DHANUSH: REVISITED AND REORIENTED As part of President Pranab Mnkberjee’s initiative to showcase India’s art and culture, the Indra Dhanush series has been revitalised. It now has a new form, structure and a distinctive logo the peacock representing the passion and resplendence of India’s performing arts. The scope too, has now been extended to include music, dance, cinema and theatre. The President has taken a personal interest in reviving India’s rare art forms resulting in the staging of the ancient Sanskrit theatre form of kutiyattam, recognised by UNESCO as part of the world’s intangible oral heritage, at Rashtrapati Bhavan. Over the past two years, Rash trapati Rhavan has witnessed sublime performances by maestros such as Girija Devi, Hari Prasad Chaurasia, Abdul Rashid Khan, Aruna Sairarn and Shubha Mndgal, amongst others. Each of ihese artistes lias left an indelible impression on our minds and elevated our consciousness. As part of our Christmas tradition, we have had incomparable performances by the Shillong Chamber Choir and the Ao Naga Choir. India’s timeless epics have been brought to life through Shriram Bhartiya Kala Kendra’s renditions of Ramayana and Kama. Another virtuoso performance has been Shekhar Sen’s musical mono-act on the life and times of Swami Vivekananda. Music has long been a unifying thread linking geographical, social, religious and linguistic boundaries. Three bands from three different SAARC countries Strings O 3 from Pakistan, LRB from Bangladesh and Advaita from India came together for the first time in Rashtrapati Bliavan on 28 November 2013 for a special performance prior to the South Asian Bands Festival at Purana Quila. INDIAN AND WORLD CINEMA Cinema is another art form that Indra Dhanush readily embraced. The Rashtrapati Bliavan auditorium came alive with the screening of the iconic films Lincoln and Mandela Long Walk to Freedom. The trials and tribulations faced by these two world statesmen, separated over time and space, but united by the extraordinary leadership and character they displayed in the face of extreme adversity, left hardly any member of audience unmoved. Similarly, in the run up to the General Elections and as part of the President’s initiative aimed at furthering voter participation in the electoral process, a special screening of the film Bhootnath Returns was organised. It was attended by Amitabh Bachchan and the rest of the cast and crew.

It has thus been a tradition to organise cultural performances as a part of the formal banquets for important Heads of State and visiting dignitaries. Two such notable events in the recent past have been the visits by the US President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama and the ASEAN-India ( Commemorative Summit. President Obama, who was the sixth American President to visit India, and the First Lady were treated to the richness and diversity of Indian culture during their State visit in November 2010. At die State B an q u e t h o s te d by P r e s i d en t P r ati b h a Pati 1 on 8th November, die Obamas were greeted with the traditional bugle and a medley of percussion from across the country at the portico of Rashtrapati Bhavan. An opera piece in Khasi, presented by the Shillong Chamber Choir, provided a perfect start to the evening. It was followed by folk musicians from Rajasthan who teamed up widi Indian classical artistes on the sitar, violin, flute and tabla to enthrall the guests.

FACING PAGE: Odissi dance at the State Banquet for President Obama kathak, bharatnatyam and odissi to give the American leadership an idea of how diverse and multi-hued Indian culture is. Very early into the current Presidency, India hosted the AS liA\\ -India Commemorative Summit in New Delhi in December 2012 to mark the 20th anniversary of the ASEAN-India dialogue partnership and the 10th anniversary of ASEAN-India Summit-level partnership. The Banquet hosted at Rashtrapati Bhavan for the visiting Heads of State saw a melange of cultural performances drawn from different parts of the country. The dignitaries were welcomed at the Rashtrapati Bhavan forecourt by charkula dancers veiled women balancing large multi-tiered circular pyramids of 108 lit oil lamps on their heads, dancing to the strains of rasiya, the songs of Lord Krishna. The music performance in the Darbar Hall featured an ensemble comprising the violin, Bute, sarod and tabla. At the 7 8 9 Ashoka Hall, been players of the snake charmers’ community from Rajasthan clad in colourful turbans and bright attire performed willi their beens, thumbas and khanjaris. Dancers from various parts of India and die participating ASEAN nations left the audience spellbound, rounding off a successful diplomatic summit. PRESIDENT PRANAB MUKHERJEE THE INDIVIDUAL It may interest the readers to know that President Pranab Mukherjee, who has had a long and distinguished innings in public life, rarely found the time earlier for watching films or other forms of cultural activity, flic Art Theatre at Rashtrapati Bhavan now serves as avenue for cinema viewings and cultural activities for the President and his guests. He is currently savouring contemporary and classical Indian cinema across various genres. He recently witnessed, and greatly enjoyed, the National Award-winning films Bhaag Milkha Bhaag and Jolly LLB. With a clearly articulated vision of the performing arts, focusing on artist recognition and encouragement, the President is transforming Rashtrapati Bhavan’s cultural landscape.

A ah <1 as The British colonial takeover of India caused deep disruptions in all aspects of Indian life. Painful, exploitative and humiliating as the experience was, it also brought with il new lifestyles, languages, technologies, methods of education, administration and governance. The making of Modern India begins in this dramatic dynamic that played out between a weakened and fragmented post-Mughal India and the new conquering western imperial power. It is a tribute to our sense of Tndian-ness’ and its innate resilience that we managed to retain and, where needed, to reform or even reinvent our traditions to suit the changing times. Simultaneously, we embraced, acquired and then, even excelled in, what western enlightenment, law and polity had to offer. If Raja Rammohnn Roy and Rabindranath Tagore exemplified ibis early synthesis of the East and West through what has been called the Bengal Renaissance, the origins and growth of our Freedom Movement could he seen as its most subversive political articulation. In the sphere of classical music too, this dialectic of confrontation - modification-assimilation played out before it concretised in the post-Independence music scene. Cultural life in Delhi and Lucknow (and other large parts of colonial India), for example, had all hut died after their fall in 1857. Both cities had been important centres of poetry and music in north India till then, harbouring many great talents and masters. In the 13 A mujra (music and dance performance) in the presence of native princess; early 20th century course of the bloody battles that raged in these cities during whal lias been called the First War of Independence, the creative elite poets, painters, musicians and dancers had either succumbed during die fighting or fled to neighbouring native states like Rampur, Gwalior, Jaipur and even far-flung 1 lyderabad. In the absence of Mughal nobility, the business community took on a difficult dual role: that of upholding Mughal traditions by way of patronage to Urdu and Persian, to music and dance, to tawai fs and ustads on the one hand, and playing the loyal subjects of the new Empire on the other. The landed gentry of Bengal and Madras followed suit as did those of Delhi and the United Provinces. Thus, by the turn of the 20lh century, the twin arts of classical music and dance were to see a host of changes, interventions and reinventions. The first to manifest was the emasculation of the traditional modes of patronage. Till now it had mostly been the native princes (and landed aristocrats) that patronised classical music and dance. With the colonial takeover these mainstays of sustenance had been considerably eroded. The castes and communities that practiced and performed music and dance now started to migrate towards the colonial cities of Calcutta, Madras and Bombay to seek new avenues of patronage and livelihood. Boasting new technologies like electricity, railways, gramophone, cinema and radio, the 14 20\"' century would prove to be radically transformational for these arts. Railways made il possible for Indians to move rapidly from one end of ibe country to the other as had never been possible before. Musicians and dancers took full advantage of 1 1 i is by travelling from remote regions to the colonial metros where theatre houses, film studios and recording companies beckoned. In fact, some of them became so fond of train journeys that there is the case of Alia- Fat tu (Ali Baksh and Fateh Ali), the court singers of Patiala, who got lifetime passes issued to them by impressing colonial patrons with their singing. Many percussionists created rhythmic compositions recreating the motion and sounds of the train on the tabla that are played to regale audiences to this day. Abdul Kareem Khan of the Kirana school travelled frequently from Bombay, where be ran a school, to Madras where he found new admirers including the legendary Tanjore devadasi veena player, Veena Dhanammal. Thanks to this interaction he was among the first to incorporate south Indian Carnatic ragas and practices in his Hindustani (north Indian) music repertoire. In fact, Abdul Kareem Khan poignantly died at the Pondicherry railway platform during one such journey. By 1901, Alladiya Khan (founder of the Jaipur Atrauli style of khayal singing) had migrated to Bombay from his native Rajasthan, as had many members of the Gwalior and Agra gharanas (families of hereditary musicians). The same year Vishnu Digambar Paluskar of the Gwalior gharana set up his school, the Gandharva Mahavidyalaya, in Lahore. Abdul Kareem khan (left) and Fa iyaz Khan were the last of the traditional court musicians 15 All these masters were seeking to find patronage for classical music far beyond its historical domain and all were to teach Hindustani music to pupils from beyond the traditional families and communities that had been the hereditary practitioners and repositories of this art in pre-colonial times. Thus began an era when India started rediscovering its culture and its arts in a manner and a scale that had never been seen in the past. Many regional forms of music and dance had never been performed beyond their native niches. Some like oclissi dance and music had to be reinvented from vestigial remnants. Others, such as tliumri and dadra, the erotic love songs of the Hindi-heartland, had to be re-created afresh to suit the tastes of a new urban audience. Large public festivals and conferences of music and dance started being organised from Calcutta to Bombay where artistes met, performed and interacted frequently. Around this time, two farsighted stalwarts, Vishnu Digambar Paluskar (1872-1931) and Vishnu Narayan Bhatkhande (1860- 1936), realised that for Indian classical music to survive in the rapidly moving circumstances a number of changes would have to he effected in its presentation, repertoire and mode of transmission from one generation to the next. Also, because classical music (and dance) had been patronised mainly by feudal aristocrats, their appreciation would have to he radically broadened to include the newly emerging class of Indians who had been educated in the western system and now lived in colonial cities. For I he first time, thousands of lav urban Indians had access to classical music through a plethora of new platforms: the stage, the gramophone record, the radio and, a little later, the cinema. These were in addition to the more traditional venues of the courtesan’s salon or the zamindar’s jalsa ghar, both of which were not only in decline but also clouded by decadence and disrepute. Bhatkhande and Paluskar were passionate modernisers who set about retrieving and reconstructing a fragmented musical tra¬ dition and harnessing il to serve the needs of a society seeking modernity. Their work was to have far reaching consequences for north Indian Hindustani music in terms of its patronage, practice and pedagogy. Vishnu Digambar Paluskar had trained under Balakrishna Bua Ichalkaranjikar, who had learnt khayal singing from the Gwalior gharana of Haddu-Hassu Khan. Having seen the whimsical and capricious nature of princely patronage, Paluskar de¬ cided to free classical music from its feu¬ dal moorings. He was the first to organise his own public concert and charge a fee for it. He capped this by singing from a raised platform while making his audi¬ ence sit below on the carpeted floor a redefining of the status of the musician vis-a-vis his patron. Ostracised by both fellow musicians and princely patrons alike, Paluskar showed 16 Vishnu Narayan Bhatkhande (left) and Vishnu Digamhar Paluskar modernised music practice great political foresight by joining forces will) the nationalist Congress party. With this he was heralding new democratic values into I he otherwise largely feudal music world. He toured all over the country singing ‘Vande Mata ram' at all Congress sessions and founded his school for music at Lahore, naming it the Gandharva Mahavidyalaya. Today, it has grown into an all India organisation thanks to the dedicated nurturing of it by Paluskar and his pupils. Among his veiy many disciples, the names of Omkar Nath Thakur,Vinayak Rao Patwardhan, Narayan Rao Vyas and his son, Dattatreya Vishnu Paluskar, must be mentioned. The other reformist, VN Bhatkhande, was a lawyer who gave up his practice to devote himself exclusively to the study of Hindustani music. He travelled to virtually every centre of music in the country to meet, document and learn from many great masters. Never much of a performer, he was India’s first modern musicologist who endeavoured to classify, analyse and categorise Indian music and its performance in a systematic manner. He was funded in this task by the princes of Baroda and Gwalior who a Iso set up colleges of music in their principalities under his guidance. Bhatkhande researched old musical texts and wrote prolifically in Sanskrit and Marathi, and with his devoted band of acolytes like Srikrishana Ratanjhankar and Rajabhaiya Poochhwale notated hundreds of old compositions of dhrupad, dhammar, khayal and thumri in his Kramik Pustakniala series I Hal runs into several volumes in Hindi. These are till date the basic textbooks for teaching o classical music in north India. The system of notation that lie devised is still the most widely used. Faced with such challenges, the response of the hereditary families, the gharanas, was mixed. Some readily cooperated with the institutions that Bhalkhande and Paluskar created and shared their traditional repertoires to he notated and taught in the modern music schools and colleges. Some disagreed with the reformists openly Iml also started taking on disciples from beyond their families, creating extended gharanas of pupils who were related by musical training hut not by Mood. Some also devised their own systems of notations to document and teach their repertoires in their own schools. The next two or three generations of master musicians would come from such students of music who had studied with oii(‘ or more of the traditional masters hut came from outside the bloodline of any gharana. Most of the traditional families found it difficult to adjust to the fast changing social milieu of the colonial cities that had now replaced the myriad princely courts as centres of power, arts and commerce. From around 1908 onwards, the recording industry was booming and even if the proud old ustads and pundits, at least initially, shunned it, the community ol the professional singing women devadasis and tawaifs took to cutting gramophone discs in their hundreds. A whole lot of music of the previous century thus came to he preserved on shellac discs and got disseminated widely across the length and breadth of the country, winning an audience and a following among classes of Indians who would never have been exposed to it otherwise. Although the great ustads and pundits of the traditional gharanas, such as Faiyaz Khan and Vilayat Hussain of Agra, Bhurji Khan of Jaipur Atrauli and Mushtaq Hussain Khan of Rampur, to name only a few, were very much alive and active till the 1950s and (ids, the institution of the gharana was waning. The next generation of masters of Hindustani music would come from among l hose of their students who did not belong to any traditional family. From the early Bhaskar Bua Baklile to Mallikarjun Mansur, Kumar Gandharva and Bhimsen Joshi in the field of vocal music and Ravi Shankar and Nikhil Bannerjee to Mari Prasad Chaurasia and Shiv Kumar Sharma among inst rumentalists, most of our great musicians of die second half of the 20lh century did not hail from any traditional musical family. After a long lull, Delhi was again becoming a centre for the arts from the mid- 1930s. Around 1936 Nirmala Joshi, the daughter of a leading Delhi doctor, had gathered around her a nucleus of masters of music 18 and dance and started the School of Hindustani Music and Dance. Amongst others, she had got Aehhan Maharaj, the father of Birju Maharaj, to come from Lucknow to teach kathak dance and went about persuading her friends to send their daughters to learn from him. Lala Punnu Lai Mathur, a rich paper merchant of Chawri Bazaar, sent his daughters, Shibola and Sharan Rani, to learn singing and kathak. “We were a very small class,’’ recalled Sharan Rani to me many decades later. After her early stint in kathak, Sharan Rani was later to become India’s first professional woman sarod player. Reminiscing about her training under Aehhan Maharaj, she said, “Not many respectable families sent their gilds to be trained in music or dance at that time. Besides me were two other girls; Reha Vidyarthi was one of them and the other, Kapila Malik, joined a little later.” Within three years, Vinay Chandra Maudgalya, a pupil of Vinayak Rao Patwardhan, had started a branch of the Gandharva Mahavidyalaya in a small two-room flat in Connaught Place, and Hindustani music got another foothold in Delhi adding a few more students from amongst the anglicised native elite. But despite these Ravi Shankar was the first global megastar of Indian music 19 early attempts, Indian classical music or dance did not receive any state attention or patronage till India became free. In the chaos and anarchy of August 1947, a young Ravi Shankar happened to be staying at the Curzon Road mansion of Sir Shriram of the Delhi Cloth Mills. He had just joined the All India Radio and had learnt that many leading musicians had converged in the capital from all over the country at the behest of the Provisional Government to participate in ihe festivities marking the* Independence of India. “What an opportunity to hold a rnehfil house concert), he remarked to Sumitra Charatram, the younger daughter-in-law of bis industrialist host. Mrs Charatram was enthused by the idea and with the support of her uncle-in-law, Sir Shankarlal, she organised the first night long concert of classical music in Independent India’s new capital. Indeed, Delhi had not seen the likes of such artistes in a long time. The last time such a galaxy of ‘native musicians’ had ga thered in the culturally barren colonial capital was in 1911 when King George V held his Delhi Durbar. And then too, they had been brought by their patrons, the native “Who am /, before the queen of music a mere prime minister! \"Jawaharlal Nehru MS Subbulakshmi (right) with Jawaharlal Nehru and Edwina Mountbatten ; circa 1949 20 princes, who had come to pay court to the King Emperor. This time, however, it was different. The artistes understood that the days of the feudal order were over and they would have to carve out a following from among the anglicised professional elite, the new capitalists and the fieiy nationalists. With many of the maestros who had performed that night as teachers, Sumitra Charatram soon established the Bharatiya Kala Kendra and the Sankarlal Music Festival with some help from the Central Government. Both are thriving even now. India was fortunate in having quite a few national leaders, led by no less than Jawaharlal Nehru and Maulana Abul 21 A Conference of Musicians was inaugurated by President Rajendra Prasad in 1951 in New Delhi.

They also felt that these arts, as they had developed over the centuries, were so syncretic and inclusive in nature that their propagation would help heal sectarian wounds and inculcate a broad-minded and catholic view of our culture and nationhood. Besides, classical music was a unifying chord that found resonance across regions crossing the divisions of language, class or creed. As the Punjab vocalist Bade Ghulam Ali Khan famously remarked, “If only classical music had been taught in every household, India would not have been divided.\" Very soon, after the formation of the first elected government in 1952, the three national Akademis were set up to encourage, document and disseminate knowledge about the arts and for their training and performance. For the first lime since Mughal India, the Union Government got directly involved in the patronage and propagation of Indian classical music and dance at a national level. The All India Badio, and later, the Doordarshan, also played a major part in propagating and supporting these arts. From January 1954, the central Sangeet Natak Akademi, which was mandated to look after the affairs of music, dance and theatre, started its annual awards honouring the best in these arts that were conferred by the President of India. From that time, it became customary to include music and dance exponents in the Padma awardees lists of the Government of India annually. Prime Minister Nehru realised the potential of culture as soft power and delegations of musicians and dancers began to be sent out on missions to showcase Indian music and dance all over the globe. Manlana Azad set up the Indian Council for Cultural Relations specifically for the purpose of disseminating Indian culture abroad as early as 1950. It was also not unusual for visiting foreign dignitaries to wi tness music or dance performances by an eminent artiste before state banquets at the Rashtrapati Bhavan from then on. Subsequent presidents have increased the number of such performances significantly. A number of music schools and colleges have been set up with direct state support, and today more students are studying and practicing classical music professionally than ever before in our history. The Marris College of Music, set up in Lucknow by Bhatkhande in 1926, was taken over by the l liar Pradesh government in 1966 and is today a Deemed University renamed as die Bhatkhande Music Institute. Even so, some musicians nostalgically look to 23 ihe past when the patrons were fewer in number but were true connoisseurs who cared for high standards of excellence; something that they say has been whittled down somewhat due to less discriminating mass audiences. Nonetheless, classical music in democratic India has flowered as never before. The best concert musicians command high respect and high fees. For the talented, there are scholarships and other facilities to study music. Also, Indian art music now enjoys a global audience and there are highly informed aficionados of Indian music worldwide and some practising musicians of non-Indian origin too. Thanks to the genius of artistes like Ravi Shankar, a slew of popular western genres from jazz to fusion and world music would not have been what they are had il not been for their interaction with Indian classical music. But that is another story. 24 SHUBHA MUDGAL: Versatile Genius A// /dee/) Kumar Shubha Mudgal is a classical vocalist with a modern sensibility. Primarily a khayal singer, she has also acquired felicity in singing thumri, dadra and other lighter and popular forms. Unlike many' classical musicians, she listens to all kinds of music and is a self-confessed admirer of jazz. No wonder that she is not afraid to experiment and has several popular cross¬ over music albums to her credit. Born in a musically inclined family of academics in Allahabad, Shubha was exposed to progressive views since childhood as her grandfather Prakash Chandra Gupta, who taught at Allahabad 1 Diversity, was a prominent Hindi literary critic associated with I he legendary Progressive Writers Movement. Both her parents taught English literature at Allahabad 1 Diversity and her father Skand Gupt earned a name as a sports commentator. Shubha initially trained as a kathak dancer but after some time started learning classical vocal music and was trained by some of the finest musicians and musicologists of India. In Allahabad, she learnt from eminent teacher and musicologist Ramashreya Jha, a disciple of Bholanath Bhatt. Ramashreya Jha is also famous for his khayal compositions that he penned using Ramrang as his non de plume. Although Shubha moved to Delhi after some years, Ramashreya Jha continued to impart to her his vast learning over a period of nearly three 25 '.y:'V decades.

It is the most prominent genre in north Indian Hindustani vocal music, k hayed gained currency as a popular farm around the 18th century when Nyarnat khan Sadarang popularised it from the court of Muhammad Shah Rangile by composing hundreds of khayal compositions and teaching them to his students. Although the origins of khayal many believe , go back to the time of the Sufi poet- administrator Ameer Khusrau Dehlavi in the I3'h century Khayal is an improvisatory form where the short Jour line , two stanza lyrics are set to a particular ruga in a particular tala of set number of beats in a skeletal composition called the ban dish. The singer is expected to improvise according to norms set by tradition within the raga and tala prescribed using the words of the composition or bandish.

Little did they know that a twenty- two year-old lad had quietly filled the void by his dedication, determination and hard work. While Ghosh began his life as a freedom fighter, this young man started as a real fighter in the wrestling arena. I Tis name was I lariprasad Chaurasia and he belonged to a family of wrestlers in Allahabad. His father Chhedilal considered music as a profession fit only for prostitutes and bandmasters hut Hariprasad was attracted to it because a classical vocalist Pandit Rajaranl lived in die neighbourhood. Born on I July 1938 in the historic city of Allahabad, Hariprasad Chaurasia secretly started learning classical vocal music from Rajaram when he was barely fifteen. To satisfy 1 1 is father, he also learnt wrestling and stenography. Within a year he surrendered himself to the charms of flute playing after listening to Bholanath, a noted flautist from Varanasi. He became Bholanath's disciple and learnt the art of (lute playing from him for eight years. At the age of nineteen, he joined All India Radio (AIR) as a staff artiste in Cuttack, 32 Orissa, where lie worked both as a performer as well as a composer. This is where he set out on his musical journey which has taken him to every nook and corner of the world. In 1960, he was transferred to Bombay (now Mumbai) where he became a life¬ long disciple of the surbahar exponent A nil a p iiimi a Devi, daughter and disciple of the legendary founder of the Maihar school Allauddin Khan. Annapurna Devi is also the sister of sarod maestro Ali Akbar Khan and the first wife of silar wizard Ravi Shankar. Leading a reclusive life, Annapurna Devi had a mystique and aura about her as she stayed away from the concert platform and rarely took a disciple. Although Hariprasad Chaurasia has scaled all the peaks of the mountain called Fame, he proudly announces in his public programmes that he continues to sit at her feet and learn even now. The influence of the Maihar school can he seen in Chaurasia’s systematic handling of the alap, jod and jliala sequences in his playing. In terms of sheer virtuosity over the instrument, he has no peer as he has broadened the horizons of flute playing beyond anybody’s imagination. In his art, he beautifully combines tradition and innovation into an integrated whole. Through his innovative techniques of blowing, he has expanded the expressive possibilities of his wind instrument so as lo bring out the most minute nuances of Hindustani classical music. A classical artiste on concert circuit, he has also played prolifically for the Hindi him industry. In collaboration with santoor maestro Shiv Kumar Sharma, he composed chart- busting music for many films including Lamhe , Si/si/a, Chandni , Fas/e , Parampara , Sahiban and Darr under the Shiv-Hari banner. IN SHEER VIRTUOSITY, HE HAS NO PEER AND HE HAS RROADENED THE HORIZONS OF FLUTE PLAYING R EYOND ANYRODY’S IMAGINATI ON. In his experimental album Eternity, Hariprasad Chaurasia incorporated many elements of western music into Hindustani classical music and it went on to become a platinum disc. A compact disc recorded by him at Oslo along with jazz artistes John McLaughlin and Jan Garbarek gained o o international popularity. He has cut many albums of Hindustani classical music, thematic music, music for meditation and folk music. His performances in India and abroad have received acclaim from audiences, connoisseurs as well as fellow musicians such as Yehudi Menuhin and Jean-Pierre Rampal. Hariprasad Chaurasia has shared stage with eminent artistes from all over the world. He has performed memorable jugalbandis (duets) with the stalwarts of 33 34 Indian classical music like Shiv Kumar Sharma, Zakir Hussain, Balamuralikrishna and Kishori Amonkar, and jammed with western artistes like John McLaughlin, Jan Garbarek, Larry Coryell, Egberto Gismonti and several others. He has also conducted orchestras with western instrumentalists. He has many dedicated and talented students both in India and abroad who are making their presence felt. He has built an ashram, the Vrindaban Gurukul in Mumbai and Bhubaneshwar where he teaches music in the traditional guru- shishya system. He also teaches music at the Rotterdam Music Conservatorium, in The Netherlands where he is the Artistic Director of the Indian Music Department. Hariprasad Chaurasia was honoured with the Sangeet NatakAkademi Award in 1984 and was made a Fellow of the Akademi in 2012. He has also been bestowed with the Padma Bhushan and Padma Vibhushan by the Government of India. Hariprasad Chaurasia performed at the Rashtrapati Bhavan on 24 November 2012 BANS UR I Indian bamboo flute, the bansuri, is among the most ancient of musical instruments in India, finding mention even in Vedic literature. More well-known, of course, is its mythological association with Lord Krishna. Krishna plays the flute to charm humans and animals alike. Gopikas - the milkmaids oj'Vrindavan - especially adore Krishna's flute playing. A highly popular folk instrument, it was incorporated into the classical fold only in the mid-20'h century. Bansuri is a cylindrical tube of bamboo with six to seven open finger holes. There are no keys to produce sharps and flats like the western flute, therefore all the required shrutis (microtones), so vital to Indian classical music, are produced by a special fingering technique.

Ao Nagas live in llie catchments of the five ranges in Mokochung District of Nagaland lying between the river Dikhu on the east and the plains of Assam on the west. They are rich in their folk traditions of literature and music. In the year 2009 university students and working professionals belonging predominantly to the Ao Naga tribe discovered their common love for music and got together to form the Choir under the aegis of the Delhi Ao Baptist Church. Presently the strength of the Choir is thirty members including ten professional singers and musicians and they are mostly Ao Nagas. Some of the members of the Choir have been formally trained abroad in music. In addition to their responsibilities in the church, members of the Choir undertake music education programmes in a number of schools and other institutions besides giving performances in secular spaces as well. The Choir is an affiliate member of The Royal School of Church Music, UK, and is also a member of the International Federation of Choral Music, USA. The Choir's repertoire includes western classical songs, Broadway musicals, 37 Moroccan renaissance music, Christian church music and Ao Naga music as well as choruses from operas and operettas. Many of ils members teach music in various schools in Delhi while others do jobs elsewhere. This naturally restricts their hours of practice and they can rehearse only for two hours on Sundays before the church proceedings begin. However, their dedication and talent has ensured that in a short span of three years, their fame reached the Rashtrapati Bhavan and they were invited to perform there in 2012. As can be expected in a voluntary effort, the Choir faces heavy odds in terms of financial support, it does receive some money from the church but that is hardly sufficient to support all their activities and they are, most of the time, starving for funds. According to founder member Luna Yaden, the Choir may not be self- sufficient financially but in terms of human resources, it is standing on its own feet. It lias many talented instrumentalists, photographers and composers who are as good as any professional could be. Also, since the aim of the Choir is to spread happiness associated with the traditional lifestyle of the Ao Nagas, the members are not unduly concerned with material success and try to find positivity in everything. Their aim is to create a sense of wellbeing with their happy songs. As the Choir functions under the aegis of the Delhi Ao Baptist Church, its religiously inclined members also aim to revive singing of hymns in church music. They are conscious of the fact that even western classical music has its roots in the religious music of the church. However, that is only one of the aims of the Ao Naga Choir, not its raison d’etre. On any evening, its offerings may include Crazy (Cee Lo Green), It's Yesterday Once More (Carpenters), Hotel California (Eagles), Imagine (John Lennon) as well as songs by Fleetwood Mac, ABBA and Crosy Stills Young and Nash (CSYN). The Choir also presents Hindi film songs of Kishore Kumar and RD Burman.

BROTHERS: The Call of the Mystics Kuldeep Kumar Nazeer Ahmed Khan Warsi and Naseer Ahmed Khan Warsi, popularly known as I lie Warsi Brothers, are true representatives of die long tradition of qawwali singing in the Indian subcontinent. They are the grandsons of the illustrious Aziz Ahmed Khan Warsi, who was awarded the Padma Shri hy die Government of India. Aziz Ahmed Warsi came from the Qawwal Bachche (Qawwal Children) lineage and was die grandson of die legendary Muhammad Siddique Khan, who sang qawwali in Delhi and Hyderabad during the second half of the 19th century. Muhammad Siddique Khan’s father, Ali Bakhsh Khan, belonged to Hapur near Delhi and was a friend of Tanras Khan, court musician of the last Mughal emperor, Bahadur Shah Zafar. Although Muhammad Siddique Khan was primarily trained by Ali Bakhsh, Tanras Khan, too, showed great interest in the grooming of his friend’s son and Muhammad Siddique came to be widely regarded as his nephew. All of them belonged to the extended clan of the Qawwal Bachche who traced their lineage to the Snli poet and musician Amir Khusrau in the I3lh century, when qawwali was gaining ground al the khanqah (place 42 43 where Sufis met) of Hazrat Nizamucldin Aulia in Delhi. As is well known, many Sufi saints like Nizamuddin Aulia were very fond of music. In their mystic practices and rituals, music and dance played a prominent role in transporting the devotee into a heightened spiritual state of blissful trance. The origins of the more classical khayal form are also traced to the practice of qawwali singing at the Sufi khanqahs. In fact, the Qawwal Bachche are credited with introducing elements like taans (fast solfa sequences) as well as intricate layakari (rhythmic play) into this devotional form of music. Bade Muhammad Khan, one of the most prominent representatives of tlu' Qawwal Bachche, emerged as llie one who gave khayal its distinctive form. His descendants took up khayal and its associated genres as their main form of singing, but did not ignore the art of qawwal i alt ogether. This came in handy when, after the British abolished the Mughal court in 1857, many musicians, dancers and poets had to leave Delhi and seek refuge in other princely states. Tanras Khan and Muhammad Siddique Khan migrated to Hyderabad in the Deccan where the nizam employed both of them at his court. Khayal was not very popular in Hyderabad where ghazal and qawwali were given preference. This posed no problem for them as they belonged to the tradition of the Qawwal Bachche and were adept in the art of ghazal and qawwali singing. However, both Tanras Khan and Muhammad Siddique Khan trained their sons and grandsons very wel I in khayal singing and several of them Umrao Khan, Sardar Khan, Shabbu Khan, just to name a few made a name for themselves all over the country as top-grade khayal singers of the 20\"’ century. Muhammad Siddique Khan settled down in the Patherghati area of Hyderabad and his descendants continue to live there even today. Following the family tradition, Nazeer Ahmed Khan Warsi and Naseer Ahmed Khan Warsi were initiated into music at the early age of five and were imparted training in Hindustani classical music so that the) become experts in all the related genres of khayal, thumri, dadra, ghazal and, of course, qawwali. In addition to qawwali, they were also taught other forms like qaul, qalbana and naat as they constitute a group of interrelated genres. One can do vistaar (elaboration) and upaj (improvisation) only when one is well -versed in all these forms and knows how to put them to the best creative use in the course of performance. Overtime, qawwali as a form has undergone myriad transformations. There have been highly popular qawwals like Habib Painter and Shakila Banu Bhopali, who could express the complex philosophical thoughts of the Sufi saints in such simple 44 language and with such musical artistry that even the less illiterate among the listeners would be able to understand and enjoy die verses. However, the hallmark of die Warsi Brothers' singing is that they have remained true to ihe age-old traditional qawwali as it was sung at the khanqahs of die Sufi dervishes and Amir Khusrau’s compositions naturally form the hulk of their repertoire. This distinguishes them from the other qawwals who often tend to play to the gallery with more filmy airs. fhe Warsi Brothers are widely travelled both in India and abroad and have performed at a number of prestigious venues in the country and across the world. Nazeer Ahmed and Naseer Ahmed Warsi performed at the Rashtrapati Bhavan on 13 January 20 13 QAWWALI Easily the most evocative flowering oflndo- Persian culture, the qawwali developed in north India from around the 13th century. It could have begun as a part of the mystical ritual of samaa, or trance, at Sufi khanqahs or seminaries. Music and dance were widely- used here to induce haul, the state of One¬ ness with God. There was a great deal in common with the Hindu Bhakti Movement, that, too used mimic and dance as a means of Uniting with the Absolute through direct relationship of personal adoration and love. Qawwali developed as a syncretic form absorbing identifiable traits from a host of musical forms and poetic ideas prevalent in India and Iran from the 12- 13'h century onwards till present times. It uses and improvises verses from a wide range of poetic sources in as many languages and dialects. These can stretch from the Holy Quran to the most popular curren t songs any thing that could be applied to or connected with the idea of love, ishq. Musically too, it is heterogeneous : swinging from the slow and somber qaul to the lilting kliayal and thumri-type bandishes, to a racytarana and even filmy ditties. It is a hugely performative form where the main singers (usually two to four j are accompanied by a large dapping chorus who sing the refrain.

Although her rendering of khayal is impeccable, her forte lies in die singing of forms like thumri, dadra, tappa, chaiti, kajri, sawan, hori, jlioola and bhajans. After the generation of the greats like Siddheshwari Devi and Rasoolan Bai passed away, it was Girija Devi who held the fort and emerged as a true inheritor of I lie traditional Banaras style that was once represented by the likes of Rajeshwari Bai and Vidyadhari Bai. Today, she can lie justifiably called the last great vocalist of the Banaras thumri. She is rightly acclaimed by music enthusiasts and connoisseurs alike, and even at the age of eighty-five, she continues to perform with admirable dedication to her art and her concert halls are packed to capacity. Born on 8 May 1929 in Banaras, Girija Devi was initiated into music at the young age of live by Pandit Sarju Prasad Mishra. She learnt from him for more than ten years. After he passed away, Pandit Srichand Mishra took charge of the promising 47 msm Mms V student and trained her till his death in the early 1960s. Both these gurus shaped her artistic personality and instilled the traditional values of music and life into her, thus gifting to the world a great vocalist whose art is truly inspiring and whose proficiency is simply unparalleled. Girija Devi gave her first public solo programme on All India Radio’s Allahabad station iu 1949. Then came a programme at Arrah in Bihar which proved to he a great hit and since then, there has been no looking back. Soon, she came to he regarded as one of the most promising voices in the world of Hindustani classical music. After the death of Badi Moti Bai, Siddheshwari Devi and Rasoolan Bai, she became the uncrowned queen of the Banaras style. Although both the Lucknow style and Banaras style are part of the poorab ang gayaki, they differ in their treatment. The Banaras style carries greater influence of the Bhojpuri dialect and folk traditions and is much more flexible as well as emotional. It is much closer to the day-to-day life experiences of the ordinary people. And Girija Devi’s powerful yet melodious voice is the perfect medium for the earthy vocalism of this style. Besides the romance laden thumri and dadra, the folksy chaiti, kajri and hori 49 mm and devotional bhajans from an integral part of Girija Devi’s vast repertoire. Most of her concerts end with devotional compositions of saints life Kabir, Snrdas, Tulsidas, Meera, Guru Nanak and Namdev and she sings them with die soulful expression of the bhakti rasa, exuding peace and tranquillity. She normally begins her concerts with a slow-paced khayal composition in a raga and follows il up with a medium tempo or fast tempo composition in the same raga. Only after establishing her credentials as a classical vocalist, does she turn towards (he so- called semi-classical forms in which she comes into her element and dazzles the audiences with her virtuosity, creative imagination and musical expression. Thumri and dadra, like other semi-classical modes, allow for innovative blending of various ragas and greater freedom to the artiste to express the essential mood of the composition. Girija Devi excels in bol banao ki thumri (rendering the same words with different emphasis and nuances at a leisurely pace) as well as bol baant ki thumri or bandish ki thumri (placing more emphasis on complex rhythmic play). While bol banao thumri is a speciality of Banaras, bol baant ki thumri is associated with Lucknow. Girija Devi is also a dedicated teacher who has trained many talented pupils. 50 She was on the teaching faculty of the 1TC Sangeet Research Academy and the Banaras Hindu University. In her long performing career, honours and awards have come her way on their own. In 1972, the government honoured her with the Padma Shri and in 1989 with the Padma Bhushan. The Sangeet Natak Akademi conferred its prestigious award on her in 1979 and its highest honour in 2010 by making her its Fellow. She is also the recipient of the Tansen Samman and honorary doctorates from several universities including Mahatma Gandhi Kashi Vidyapeeth, Rabindra Bharati University and Purushottam Das Tandon Open University. Girija Devi performed at the Rashtrapati Bhavan on 31 March 2013 Till Mill A soulful and sensuous love song describing die state of the beloved, thumri developed around the Vaishnav Bhakti Movement in the Braj dialect from the 15th century onwards. From its sacred fiadha-Krishna context it spread to the courts and salons to acquire more earthy overtones. As it spread eastwards, towards eastern Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, inplaces like Lucknow, Benaras and Gaya it got more refined and absorbed Awadhi and Bhojpuri influences to acquire the celebrated purab-ang, or the eastern style. Nciwcib Wajid Ali Shah, the last nawab ofAwadh, was very fond of thumri and under his patronage and intervention it rose to great sophistication both in song and in dance. Bhaiyya Saheb Ganpat Bao, Maujuddin Khan and Bindadeen Maharaj are credited with creating new thumris and styles of delivering them and teaching them to many professional women singers in the early decades of the 20'h century: In the 1940s and 50s a western punjab ang was developed in Lahore by Ashiq Ali Khan and his followers like Bade Ghulam Ali and Barkat Ali Khan.

Her vibrant voice and eclectic, innovative style of singing moves die listener emotion ally, yet also compels him orherto think. She I las been variously called an ‘innovative traditionalist’ or a ‘traditional innovator’ to underline her penchant for innovation and improvisation and for the continuous evolution of her art. Born to culturally inclined parents whose tiny 750-sq ft apartment in Bombay (now Mumbai) attracted top writers, musicians and dancers, Aruna Sairam started learning music at a very early age from her mother, Rajalakshmi Setlmraman, who would, every morning, 54 sing Meera bhajans before the idols of Krishna and Rad ha at their home. It was Rajalakshmi who encouraged her daughter to experimei i 1 with new ideas and forms and never be afraid of innovation. After gaining a good initial grounding in the basics of Carnatic classical music, Aruna Sairam wenl to the err eat. vocalist, T Brinda of theTanjore school, and it was Brindamma who chiselled Arena's talent so as to turn her into the artiste that she is today. However, it was no easy journey. Brindam¬ ma was very choosy about her students and did not readily accept a new one. While she taught senior students, Aruna would sit in the other room listening. After two months, she was allowed to sit near the door of the room. Suddenly, one day, luck smiled on her and Brindamma called her into the room and asked her to sing with the group. Teaching styles in the southern Carnatic tradition are not very different from what ihey are in its north¬ ern Hindustani counterpart. Jusl like the ustads and gurus of yore who would teach die disciple only a bandish (composi¬ tion) and not the raga, Brindamma, too, did not teach Aruna any ragam but only asked her to sing. When Aruna sang, she would comment on various aspects of the singing and the composition. The reason behind this practice was Brindamma’s de¬ sire that her disciples should not become her clones. She encouraged them to de¬ velop their own independent identity as vocalists. Aruna Sairram learnt from Brin¬ damma the essence of singing with emo- tion as she trained her in the style of her own guru and grandmother, the legendary Veena Dhanammal. However, Aruna was not content with learning from just one guru, no matter how great she might he. So, to broaden her understanding and to enlarge her repertoire, she went to S. Ramachandran, who belonged to the bani (style) of Chittor Subramanya Pillai, and learnt the fine nuances of nereval singing (improvising within poetic texts) from him. From AS Maui, a disciple of Tiger Varadacharyar, she received expertise in singing sargams (solfa syllables) and weaving charming patterns with them, thus mastering the art of swar kalpanas. Her stint with veena vidwan, KS Narayanaswamy, taught her die 'logic' behind every gamaka, the microtonal oscillations whose ample and distinctive use distinguishes Carnatic o singing from other styles. Her never-ending search for perfection took Aruna Sairam to Professor Eugene Rabine, a German expert of voice culture, who understood the uniqueness of the timbre of her voice and helped her with his suggestions as to how she should apply her voice to express a variety of emotions. Even now, she remains in contact with other experts of voice culture such as the New York-based David Jones. For mam years, the inimitable Balamuralikrishna 55 has been guiding her in her creative pursuits. Aruna showed promise al a very young age and won her first gold medal when she was just eight at the Shanmukhananda Sabha Competition in Bombay, and by the time she was fourteen, she had started giving solo concerts. She won the Best Young Musician Award at the annual conference held at the Music Academy in Chennai. If as budding youngster, Aruna won several gold medals and other prizes, there have been no dearth of these after she became a mature artiste. She has received many honours from India and abroad. In 2006, the Tamil Nadu government conferred die prestigious Kalaimamani on her. In 2008, she received die US Congress Proclamation of Excellence Award. The next year, the Government of India honoured her with die Padma Shri. In 2013, Rajah Sir Annamalai Chettiar Memorial Trust, Chennai, decorated her with its annual award.

He is full of creative ideas, bursting with passion and is not afraid of charting his own course in music. He sings several song-forms such as khayal, thumri, tappa and bhajans with equal ease. Bhuvanesh was a child born to music and his pedigree is truly enviable. I le is the grandson of the legendary Kumar Gandharva who blazed a trail in 20lh century Hindustani music and mesmerised music lovers with his unique voice, innovative genius and path¬ breaking experiments. Often called a rebel, he brought freshness into the tradition- 57 dominated field of music where feudal gharanas (family traditions) reigned supreme and individual creativity was al a low premium. Kumar Gandharva broke the shackles of the tradition, renewed it with his unique approach and expanded its domain by blending classical with folk music, lie had a worthy disciple in his wife Vasundhara Komkali. llis son Mukul Shivputra, is Bhuvanesh’s father. At a time when quite a few vocalists were trying their best to emerge as clones of Kumar Gandharva, Bhimsen Joshi or Jasraj, Mukul Shivputra endeavoured to find his own voice and sty le. Kumar Gandharva’s daughter Kalapini Komkali is also a highly co m j >e lent vocali st. The rich musical atmosphere within the family naturally helped Bhuvanesh a lot to shape up as an artiste. In his childhood, lie had the good fortune of learning from his grandfather who was, besides being an extraordinarily creative and innovative performing musician, a great teacher too. An old photograph shows a doting grandfather teaching a very young Bhuvanesh who is also playing tabla so as to grasp the composition along with its rhythm. Unfortunately, when he was a lad of just fourteen years, Kumar Gandharva passed away. After 1 1 is death, the responsibility of training Bhuvanesh fell on the shoulders of Vasundhara Komkali who performed her duty with great affection, diligence and seriousness. He also has the benefit of guidance from Madhup Mudgal, a prominent disciple of his grandfather and principal of Gandharva Mahavidyalaya, Delhi. Consequently, Bhuvanesh has been able to emerge as a polished vocalist. Like his father Mukul Shivputra, Bhuvanesh too draws inspiration from the late Kumar Gandharva but avoids replicating his singing. After his grandfather’s death, Bhuvanesh listened to numerous recordings to understand the nuances of Gandharva’s style so that he could develop one of his own. His style of singing does display strong influences of his grandfather but, in the final analysis, it is truly his own. He is pursuing the goal of establishing an archive of Kumar Gandharva’s recordings in the family's house in Dewas, Madhya Pradesh, to preserve his rich legacy. He is actively involved in the arduous task of digitising his grandfather’s recordings. Such an archive will go a long way to help future students and researchers of Hindustani classical music. Although it is a work-in- progress, its doors are open to all and entry is free of charge. Kumar Gandharva was known for thematic treatment of music. He presented specially designed programmes like Varsha Ritu (Rainy Season), Bal Gandharva, Surdas, Tulsidas and Kabir. His singing of nirguni bhajans remain unsurpassed to this day. Bhuvanesh too has paid due attention to presenting compositions and ragas that 59 are relevant to the theme or context of the situation. A few years ago lie was invited to perform at t lie Pashupatinath Festival in Kathmandu, Nepal. There are not only many ragas like Kedar and Shankara that are associated with Shiva, but Kumar Gandharva had also composed a fast tempo bandish in Shankara and it is justly very famous. However, instead of taking the easy route of picking one of these, Bhuvanesh decided to do something new and made use of several Shiva stotras (Sanskrit hymns in praise of Shiva) and ashtaks (eight-line stanzas) to compose his own bandishes or compositions. This demonstrates his intellectual approach towards music. Bhuvanesh has performed in almost all the prestigious music festivals in the country including the Sawai Gandharva Festival, Pune, and Shriram Shankarlal Festival, Delhi. He was awarded a scholarship by Department of Culture, Government of India. Karnataka slate government decorated him with its Mallikarjun Mansur Memorial Award. He lives in Dewas, Madhya Pradesh, India.

No wonder when Shekhar Sen turned fifty in February 201 1, sitar maestro and recipient of the Bharat Ratna, Pandit Ravi Shankar wrote to him: “Some years ago my mind was blown away when I first saw you in your production of Kabir in Delhi. The whole conception of your one-man show with your singing, your compositions, acting, plus all the details was unbelievable! Shekhar, I admire you as a greal creative artist.” Such high praise from an international icon like Ravi Shankar is not easy to come by and it shows how utterly mesmerising Shekhar Sen’s art is. Born iu a musical family in Raipur, Chhattisgarh, in 1961, Shekhar Sen has inherited music from his parents. His father Arun Kumar Sen was vice-chancellor of Indira Sangeet Kala Vishwavidyalaya, Khairagarh, and had made a name for himself both as a vocalist of the Gwalior gharana as well as a seasoned musicologist. Shekhar’s mother Anita Sen, too, was a vocalist. Although he studied commerce for his bachelor’s degree, Shekhar learnt to sing and play violin and sitar. lie also trained as a kathakali artiste for some time. 62 In 1979, he left Raipur for Bombay (now Mumbai) to become a music director. He was singed by HMV as a ghazal singer but was drawn towards devotionals, realising that singing and composing bhajans was a much more fulfilling experience for him. After years of struggling in Mumbai he decided to chart out bis own path. Shekhar drew inspiration from Bharata’s Natyashastra as well as the Baul tradition of Bengal where there is no separation between the actor and die singer. He also watched theatre and film actors Raghuhir Nadav and Annu Kapur who could act and sing with equal ease. He noticed that even in the West, actors often sang. In a musical play, the immediacy with which one has to alternate between dialogues and singing can be best attempted by an actor. Shekhar was fortunate enough to come into close contact with top Hindi litterateur Dharmvir Bharati who encouraged him in his creative endeavour. Shekhar Sen wrote the songs as well as dialogues of his first mono-act play Kahir interspersing it with the saint-poet’s own poetry. When he presented it for the first time, it was a great success. Shekhar completely identified himself with Kabir and his experiences as a low caste weaver who was not sure which religion he actually belonged to. Consequently, he questioned the established tenets and practices of both Hinduism and Islam and earned the ire as well as respect of both the communities. Shekhar Sen’s soulful singing and consummate acting made the audiences feel as if they were in the presence of the great saint-poet himself. No wonder that he has staged 250 shows of this play all over die world. On a trip to the United States, he saw a Chinese visitor reciting from Tulsidas’s Ramacharitmanas. This inspired him to write a musical play about that great saint -poet also. Soon, he took up other great medieval poets such as Surdas and Raskhan and came out with hugely popular mono-act plays about them. His play on Swami Vivekananda has also received accolades from lay spectators as well as the cognoscenti. A special feature of his musical plays is that it hardly uses any musical instrument as a prop and the entire production is carried on the strength of his mellifluous voice with impeccable pronunciation and diction. Shekhar Sen has been honoured with many awards. Uttar Pradesh Sangeet Natak Academy conferred the Safdar Hashmi Award 2001 on him while the Maharashtra Rajya Hindi Sahitya Academy decorated him with the prestigious V Shantaram S amnia n.

At 106, the venerable vocalist from Uttar Pradesh is the oldest performing musician in the country. Nol many people are able to complete a century. And among those who accomplish this rare feat, not many can claim to be concert fit. Therefore, when Abdul Rashid khan hits a pure and perfect note with a passion, verve and elan that would put a young man to shame, one is left completely awestruck. We see in him an example of how age can he defied by lifelong rigorous riyaz (practice), disciplined living and self-control. Born on 19 August 1908 in a family of traditional musicians, Abdul Rashid Khan was initiated into music by his uncle Bade Yusuf Khan and later trained by many other elders of his extended family. His family traced its origins to Miyan Tansen who was one of the nine jewels in Mughal Emperor Akbar’s court and is perhaps the most famous musician in India’s musical history. It is said that the family has descended from Surat Sen, the third son of Miyan Tansen, and is also related to Behram Khan. Abdul Rashid Khan imbibed the stylistics of the Gwalior gharana (school) of khayal singing and developed it further 65 in accordance with his creative instincts and artistic sensitivities. However, he took care of always keeping himself within the parameters handed down by the Gwalior tradition. By die dint of sheer talent and hard work, he eventually emerged as a formidable performer who could not only sing khayal, but also forms like dhrupad, dhammar and thumri with equal ease and felicity. The special layakari (rhythmic) patterns of the Gwalior style can he glimpsed in his impactful singing. Besides being a virtuoso performer, he is also an accomplished composer who has created more than two thousand bandishes (compositions) with the non de plume of Rasan Piya. Abdul Rashid Khan has made a name for himself for the purity of his style. His specialty lies in his resonant singing and rich mellow voice diat has not lost its lustre even at I his advanced atre. When I ie o touches the high notes in the upper octave, liis virtuosity as well as amazing breath - control come into full play and when he stays on a note for what seems to be an eternity, it is sheer bliss. He possesses an understanding of the ragas and repertoire that is rarely seen these days. As a result, he combines the erudition of a music scholar with the performative skills and excellence of a creative virtuoso. His long musical journey has not been without its ups and downs. It is said that when he was at the peak of his creative prowess and was nearly forty, a jealous rival poisoned him by administering mercury in a paan (betel leaf). This resulted in his losing his fingers, toes and nearly all his eyesight. However, his voice remained intact to regale his vast audiences in India and abroad. He believes in the traditional Gwalior way of singing in an open, natural and full-throated voice which is projected with full force. Microphones were not able to make any impact on his voice or style, as he never al lowed the technology to dictate terms to him. This is quite unlike most modern-day vocalists who have tailored their voices to the needs of artificial amplification. He leads a well-regulated life and has not given up his daily riyaz even at this ripe old age. Since the early 1990s, he has been associated with ITG Sangeet Research Academy, Kolkata, as a resident guru and has trained many worthy students. However, he is not as strict with them as his guru was with him. When young Abdul Rashid Khan started learning music, his guru asked him to sing only the first three notes for at least three months. When a bored Abdul Rashid Khan one day attempted the fourth one, the guru overheard him from the next room and extended the period of singing only the first three notes for another three months. A musical wonder, Abdul Rashid Khan 67 has received many awards and felicitations in the course of 1 1 is long journey. They include the ITC Award, the Sangeet Nalak Academy Award of the Uttar Pradesh government, Kashi S war Ganga Award, has Sagar Award, has Rang Samman, Central Sangeet Nalak Akademi Award and the Padma Bhushan from the Govermnent of India, among others.

During colonial and feudal times certain instruments were deemed to be fit for certain ceremonial functions, for example the shenai, or for folk music, die santoor. However, in die cultural renaissance that took place around the time of independence doth these instruments got inducted into the classical music concert platform by the sheer dint and talent of two greal masters of these instruments. What Bismillah Khan did for the shehnai, Shiv Kumar Sharma did even better for the santoor. Before Bismillah Khan appeared on die scene, shehnai was played at the gates of the temples and die courts or on auspicious occasions such as engagements, weddings, birth of a son. The repertoire llien consisted of folk tunes, thumris, dadras and also some classical ragas. The greatness of Bismillah Khan lay in his successful attempt to raise die shehani to such a height that it was accepted at par with other instruments like the si tar and the sarod. However, santoor did not enjoy any close proximity with classical music as it is essentially a folk instrument of die Kashmir Valley. Before Shiv Kumar Sharma transformed it into a full-fledged classical instrument, only folk musicians 70 played santoor while singing Kashmiri folk songs. Sufi mystics too used il while rendering l heir suliayana qalam. I Iowever, many other musical instruments such as saz, rabab, sitar, tumbakanari and ghal were also played along with it. lu suliyana music, the santoor player is the leader of the group of singers and plays the instrument while singing. Unlike shehnai, its repertoire never had anything to do will) die classical genres of Hindustani music although strong imprints of the Persian muqam system could be noticed. Shiv Kumar Sharma single-handedly introduced santoor as a solo instrument in the hallowed precincts of the highbrow, conservative classical music by enhancing its expressive capabilities, loday, its popularity surpasses that of even sitar and sarod, especially among young listeners. To achieve better tonal quality, he preferred walnut to the toon wood traditionally used to make the instrument. In the traditional santoor, four strings arc stretched on each bridge for each note. However, it posed a problem for the player, especially when he tried to play the fast sequences like taans. Shiv Kumar Sharma experimented for ten long years to adapt the instrument to his creative requirements and came to the conclusion that three strings on one bridge could serve the purpose better in the middle and upper octave, whereas only two strings on one bridge would 71 72 suffice for lower octave. He made these strings thick and coiled so that they could resonate like sympathetic strings while playing. He has also changed the tuning system of santoor and his instrument has a total of thirty-one bridges with eighty- seven strings. Now, his santoor has a range of two-and-a-half octaves instead of the earlier one -and- a- half. To produce meend-like legato effect and an elongated note, lie developed a special technique and proved to the world that creativity did not brook physical limitations imposed by the structure of an instrument. Born in Jammu, Shiv Kumar Sharma learnt music from his father Lima Dutt Sharma who was an expert vocalist and tabla player. In fact, the young Shiv Kumar had become an adept tabla player before he focused his attention on santoor. The understanding of rhythm proved to be very useful in his subsequent musical career. A chance meeting with die famous film director V Shantaram led him to compose the background music for a scene in his film Jhanak Jhanak Payal Bacije. Shantaram asked him to make Bomba} (now Mumbai) his home and compose music for his future films. But determined as lie was to emerge as a classical musician, Shiv Kumar Sharma politely declined the offer. However, after he had established himself as a classical musical of repute, he along with flautist Hari Prasad Chaurasia composed music for a number of films including Silsila, Larrihe and Chandni. He has received many honours and awards including the prestigious Sangeet Natak Akademi award, the Padma Shri and the Padma Vibhushan from the Government of India. Shiv Kumar Sharma perfomed at the Rashtrapati Bhavan on 24 August 2013 SANTOOR The santoor is derived from Persian santur and related to a vast family of instruments spread from Persia to Greece and from Kashmir to Indonesia in the east. Some musicians have mentioned a similar hundred-stringed lute, the shata- tantri veena in Sanskrit texts also. Made of walnut wood it is a trapezoid dulcimer, hammered with specially shaped mallets called mezrabs held between the index and middle fingers. Most santoors have two sets of bridges and cover a range of 'two-and-a- half octaves.

The D-Day was 8 November 2010 and the guests were none other than o US President Barack Obama and Ins wife, Michelle Obama. The choir was formed in 2001 by Neil Nongkynrih, a son of the soil. Once a rebellious teenager, Nongkynrih went to England to train as a concert pianist despile stiff opposition from his father. He studied at the Guildhall School of Music and Trinity College, London. Thereafter, lie worked as a concert pianist in Europe for thirteen years. However, he found it difficult to adapt to the ‘commercial and elitist’ professional music scene there and returned to Shillong, only to find that discontent and anger among the youth in this green valley was pushing them towards substance abuse at an alarming D rate. Realising that the youth were troubled, he decided to offer his music as a gift to his beloved land and its people. So, he formed the Choir with the local youth. As his music had a healing effect, Neil came to be known as the man with a golden touch. He not only makes beautiful music, but he also has the rare ability of coaxing others to bring their inner music out into t he open. 75 I lie Shillong Chamber Choir is a multi¬ genre choir that has performed in India as well as abroad with tremendous success. In 2002 it won a silver award in the folklore category at the 2\"d World Choir Games in South Korea. In 2008, die Bollywood scriptwriter, Urmi Juvekar, made a short film, sponsored by the Government of India, on the Choir. A year later, the Choir performed with the visiting Vienna Chamber Orchestra in Shillong and Kolkata and was invited to showcase its talent in Sri Lanka. In July 2010, it bagged Gold Diplomas in three categories Musica-Sacra (sacred music), Gospel (medley of a few songs) and Popular (medley of Bollywood and English numbers) at the 6th World Choir Games held at Shanghai in China. In October 2010, the Choir became a household name in India after winning the finals of the reality talent show, India’s Got Talent (Season 2), on Colours TV. The Choir had been accustomed to singing operas in different languages, but when it decided to sing the classic Hindi film songs, Ajeeb Das tan haiYe and Ye h Dosti from DilApna aur Preet Parayi and Sholay respectively, the songs clicked in such a way that they won the day Next year, the Choir had another performance in Shillong with the Vienna Chamber Orchestra. The programme presented Hindi film songs that had been refashioned by Neil Nongkynrih for the choir and the orchestra. The Shillong o Chamber Choir has also collaborated with Shankar, Ehsaan and Loy at the second Global Indian Music Awards. It has composed and sung four songs for their debut Malayalam movie. Goodbye December , and the song Madi Madi was aired live by BBC. I he versatility of the Shillong Chamber Choir becomes obvious when one considers the fact of their collaborations with the Vienna Chamber Orchestra and the Eitzwilliam Quartet on one hand and with Bollywood icon, Amitabh Bachchan, on the other. Its Christmas album in 2011 became the highest selling in the country for non-cinematic music. Now1, the Choir comprises twenty- five musicians, including fifteen singers and their latest collaboration was with the labia wizard and international celebrity, Zakir Husain.

In his late fifties today, he is at the peak of his performing career and has won over large audiences in India and abroad making him much sought after on the concert circuit. Shahid Parvez is the scion of the Etawah gharana that traces lineage from the lirst recorded sitarist, Ustad hndad Khan. In the 19th century, Sahehdad Khan, who belonged to a family of traditional musicians, learnt khayal singing from the legendary founders of I he Gwalior gharana Haddu and Hassu Khan. Later, he moved to Etawah in Uttar Pradesh and became an expert player of sitar and surbahar. However, il was his son hndad Khan who emerged as an instrumentalist of great renown and is considered as I he founder of the Etawah gharana. Gharana literally means ‘of the household’ or clan but, in I he musical context, il also denotes a distinct style of singing or playing musical instruments associated with a particular clan of musicians. Their disciples, who may or may not belong lo the clan, are also considered members of the gharana as they carry forward its style and the underlying aesthetic principles. hndad Khan had two sons Inayat Khan and Wahid Khan. Of them, I nay at Khan 80 Hon ’ble President Pranab Mukherjee felicitating Shahid Parvez Khan rose to great heights as a renowned sitar and snrbahar player and became a star performer. Unfortunately, he died young. His son Vilayat Khan emerged as one of the greatest sitar players of the 20th century and introduced explicit elements of khayal singing into his style of playing the sitar. This necessitated some changes in the structure of the sitar and its playing techniques. Although Shahid Parvez did not directly learn from him, he is today regarded as the foremost exponent of the Vilayatkhani baaj or the Vilyat Khan style. Shahid Parvez is the grandson of Wahid O Khan who initially trained him in vocal music at the tender age of three. Later, Shahid also learnt to play tabla from Munne Khan of the Delhi gharana. However, his training in playing sitar took place exclusively under his father Aziz Khan who, much to the disappointment of Wahid Khan, had turned his attention to composing music for Hindi films, hi fact, Wahid Khan’s other son Hafiz Khan, too, became a music director in Hollywood and came to he known as H Khan Mastana. The fact that both his sons had given up classical music for earning their livelihood in the film industry came as a 81 huge disappointment to Wahid Khan. He made Aziz Khan promise that he would dedicate his son Shahid to the exclusive pursuit of classical music. Aziz Khan fulfilled his promise to the fullest measure and groomed his son with rigorous training right from childhood. As a consequence, Shahid Parvez lias, with his talent and hard work, emerged as one of the finest silar players i 1 1 the country. He has beautifully coalesced the elements of the staccato instrumental style (tantrakari) with legato-based song-inspired khayal gayaki to create his own distinctive style of playing silar. The way he uses the wire plectrum (mizrab) to play right-hand strokes is amazingly dextrous. He has incorporated the style of Imdad Khan for creating hols (rythmic textures) with I he use of mizrab. In his time, Imdad Khan would use this technique intermittently but his son Wahid Khan used il more regularly in his playing of surbahar. Shahid Parvez is said to be the first silar player to use this technique and il lends a lilting movement to the fast sequences of notes called taans. His execution of long meends (legato slides) are particularly charming as also is Iris serious treatment of the raga as can be seen in his introductory alap that has a meditative quality about it. Shahid Parvez has brought out dozens of LPs, cassettes, CDs and albums. He has also played duets (jugalbandis) with Carnatic musicians as well as the Hindustani vocalist l stad Rashid Khan. Shahid Parvez is a top grade artiste of the All India Radio and a recipient of many awards such as the Padma Shri from the Government of India, I Ik; Sur Shringar Award, Kumar Ganclharva Sanunan, M L Koser Award, Sangeet Natak Akademi Award. He lives in Pune. Shahid Parvez Khan performed at the Rashlrapati Bhavan on 9 February 2014 SITAR Easily the most widely recognised Indian musical instrument the world over, the silar is also the most dominant classical instrument in India. The name comes from the Persian setar, a similar smaller, three-stringed fretted lute with a long elongated neck and a resonating chamber made of gourd. From Mughal times (16th century onwards) it has unde/gone much evolution both inform, and in its musical range. Musicians pluck the strings with a wire plectrum called the mizrab worn on the right forefinger while the left hand manipulates the strings with subtle finger work on or between the frets. SK 82 DANCE SEEKING INDEPENDENCE, DISCOVERING DANCE Leela Venkataraman Nationalism and the struggle for I independence ushered in a process of rediscovering the Indian identity, which had been blurred by a long period of colonial rule and English education. Thus the popular discovery of the so-called ‘classical’ and other dances that we saw during this period was an inherent part of this quest for self-discovery. This cultural revival, which peaked in the 1930s and 40s, sought to re¬ establish connections with largely lost pre-colonial value systems and was led by cultural activists whose lives and philosophies were shaped by the likes of Mahatma Gandhi. Gandhiji’s Satyagraha and Khadi movements influenced writers and theatre people in particular.
