        "text": "A Potpourri of Vestiges Feature\n\nThree hours of entertainment. Some songs, dance, action and comedy. Sounds familiar?\n\nBollywood movies have always been the most popular mode of entertainment in India. We are all familiar with the on-screen running around the trees, high-octane action sequences, twins separated at birth reuniting decades later with a sprinkle of romance and lots of mirch masala. We leave the theatres after watching these movies wanting our lives to be a perfect film story with a happy ending.\n\nBut sometimes, we want to experience something historical, contemporary, something more deep rooted and intense. This is when we wish to watch movies which leave a greater impact on the society as they entertain leaving an impactful message that concerns all of us living together in a society. Some of these movies actually change our mindsets while some fill us up with emotional turmoil and some others, give our life a new direction.
