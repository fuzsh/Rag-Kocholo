        "text": "Looking for the Best of Art Films seen, Please Share your recommendations. The movies I saw are as below to name a few\n\nEk Ruka Hua Faisla\n\nJane Do Bhi Yaaro\n\nMonsoon Wedding\n\nMandi\n\nSuraj Ka Satvan Ghoda\n\nshatranj ke khiladi\n\nI have seen all of these, Surprisingly all of them are made in 80s - 90s, but quite relevant in the geo-political scenario of 2018. Ek Ruka hua faisla is probably most underrated one among i think ; Add 'Party ' to the list.\n\nPreviously there were few specific directors who used to do such movies to be considered for national awards; Shyam Benegal, Govind Nihlani etc.. Few of the mainstream directors have started their careers with parallel cinema ; Mahesh Bhatt is one such example, currently with the advent of streaming services and YouTube, they have much more versatile ways to reach the target audience (without needing to beg the traditional distributor network to showcase their movies) and thankfully they're making enough money too.\n\nI have many Hindi art movies even some regional as well, mostly are released on Cinemas of India series.\n\n27 Down\n\nAankhon Dekhi\n\nAashad Ka Ek Din\n\nAntareen\n\nAranyak\n\nArvind Desai Ki Ajeeb Dastaan\n\nChalo America\n\nChar Adhyay\n\nCurrent\n\nDance Like A Man\n\nDance of the Wind\n\nDattak\n\nDevi - Ahilya Bai\n\nDharavi\n\nDiksha\n\nDuvidha\n\nEk Din Achanak\n\nEk Doctor Ki Maut\n\nEk Ghar\n\nFive By Four\n\nGaman\n\nGandhi (Blu-ray)\n\nGangoobai\n\nGodam\n\nHe...\n\nJaane Bhi Do Yaaro\n\nKali Salwaar\n\nKamla Ki Maut\n\nMammo\n\nMassey Sahib\n\nMirch Masala\n\nMiss Beatty's Children\n\nMiss Lovely (Blu-ray)\n\nNaseem\n\nNazar\n\nPaar\n\nParty\n\nPestonjee\n\nRaghu Romeo\n\nRui Ka Bojh\n\nSalaam Bombay (Blu-ray)\n\nSalim Langde Pe Mat Ro\n\nSanshodhan\n\nSuraj Ka Satvan Ghoda\n\nTarpan\n\nThe Making of Mahatma\n\nTrain To Pakistan\n\nTrishagni\n\nTriyacharitra\n\nUski Roti\n\nWoh Chhokri\n\nAnnhey Ghorey Da Daan (Punjabi)\n\nMarhi Da Deeva (Punjabi)\n\nQissa (Punjabi)\n\nSome others are:\n\n1947-Earth\n\n36 Chowringhee Lane\n\nAnkur\n\nArth\n\nBandit Queen (Blu-ray)\n\nBhumika\n\nChakra\n\nDroh-Kaal\n\nEk Ruka Hua Faisla\n\nFire\n\nJunoon\n\nKalyug\n\nKhamosh Pani\n\nKondura\n\nMandi\n\nManthan\n\nMukti Bhawan\n\nNishant\n\nSaaransh\n\nSparsh\n\nTrikal\n\nVijeta\n\netc.\n\nI have mostly all Gulzar movies. Some Mahesh Bhatt's movies are also good (Arth in mentioned above) Kabzaa, Zakhm, Tamanna etc.\n\nI would like to add some more which I don't have right now but I have watched these, are:\n\nSardari Begum\n\nIs Raat Ki Subah Nahin\n\nGodmother\n\nDarmiyaan\n\nDev\n\nHu Tu Tu (Gulzar)\n\netc.\n\nThat's nice. It would be great if you recommend some international art movies. I love Woody Allen, François Truffaut, Atom Egoyan kind of movies.\n\nOh, that’s like an ocean! And I may not have tasted even a cupful. So let me just list down a few recent films I watched on MUBI (and liked) in the last few months instead:\n\nMoonlight (Oscar winner, incidentally)\n\nThree Colors (anthology by Kieowski, I like his style)\n\nA Short film about Love; Blind Chance; (Kieslowski all)\n\nAraby (Arabic based in Brazil)\n\nWe are Mari Pepa (Mexican)\n\nIranian (Tamadon)\n\nThe Bridge of Arts (French, Eugene Green)\n\nSummer Hours (French, Juliette Binoche in the lead)\n\nFilantropica (French)\n\nThe Living World (Eugene Green, Belgian)\n\nJaquot de Nantes (French Director’s Biopic)\n\nit’s tough to remember many of the gems I saw before that on MUBI.\n\nApart from this all movies by Wes Anderson and John Madden I love. But the one English movie that I rate the highest is English Patient by Anthony Minghella. Also like Soviet movies by Parajanov.\n\nTo the huge list of Indian art films already in this thread I’d like to add a few:\n\n- Ship of Theseus (Anand Gandhi)\n\n- Samna, Sinhasan, Jait are Jait, Bhumika and every other movie by Jabbar Patel (mostly Marathi)\n\n- New age Marathi movies by Paresh Mokashi, Sumitra Bhave,\n\n- Gangs of Wasseypur (I consider it art though many might differ) and many others by Anurag Kashyap\n\n- Ankhon Dekhi (Rajat Kapoor)\n\n- A Billion Color Story\n\n- All Hansal Mehta movies\n\n- All movies directed by Amol Palekar\n\n- Earlier movies by Madhur Bhandarkar\n\n- Some od Dibakar Banerjee\n\n- New Malayalam movies by Anjali Menon\n\n- Vishal Bharadwaj’s Shakespearean adaptation\n\n- Movies and shorts by Neeraj Ghaywan\n\n- Marathi ahe Hindi films by Nishikant Kamat\n\n- Nagesh Kukunoor’s most movies\n\n- Movies by Nila Madhab Panda\n\n- Even some of RGV’s best (he could go from best to worst)\n\n- Sudhir Mishra (Hazaaron Khwaishey Aisi, Dharavi, Chameli, Main Zinda Hoon etc)\n\n- Every movie made by Saeed Akhtar Mirza\n\n- Ritesh Batra is a new director I am liking as well (famous for Lunchbox, see Photograph, his latest)\n\nLet me stop. Or else this can go on and on.\n\nInternational movies: I really enjoyed watching the following movies on Criterion recently.\n\nSandeep, how did you access the Criterion Channel in India?"
