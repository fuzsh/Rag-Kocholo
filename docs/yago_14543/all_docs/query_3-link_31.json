Naseem (Kango) is a\nschoolgirl belonging to a middle-class Bombaybased\nMuslim family. She enjoys a warm\nrelationship with her aged, ailing grandfather\n(Azmi). With increasing horror and foreboding,\nthe family watches on their television set the\nnews of the build-up at Ayodhya while the\ngrandfather regales Naseem with poetry and\nstories of life in pre-Independence Agra,\nshown in several flashbacks. Naseem’s brother\nMushtaq (Shah) tends towards desperate,\npossibly terrorist measures of resistance which\npushes him towards Muslim fundamentalist\ncircles. The family feels increasingly\nbeleaguered by saffron-waving mobs and the\npolice who infest all public spaces. The\ngrandfather dies on December 6th, his death\ncoinciding with the news of the mosque’s\ndestruction. The film’s major feature, in\naddition to its finely judged creation of moods\nand its admirably controlled performances, is\nnoted poet and former radical Azmi playing the\ngrandfather, providing not just a reminder but a\nliteral embodiment of the cultural traditions\nthat were at stake in those tragic days.",
