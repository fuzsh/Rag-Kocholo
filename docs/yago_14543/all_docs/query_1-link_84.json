He begins to take on Gandhi’s pacifist principles, but is no ordinary Gandhian, believing he is the reincarnation of the Mahatma itself. In the process Gadhvi attracts more and more followers, but also enemies seeking to bring him down, including hired-gun, Omkar, who has been tasked with suppressing the swelling anger against the establishment by shattering Gadhvi’s delusion and crushing his core beliefs. Gaurav Bakshi’s debut feature is a sharp social and political satire that plays out like a thriller where the audience is left guessing about who Gadhvi really is and if he is actually Gandhi’s reincarnation.\n\nPlease remember there are no adverts before festival screenings so we encourage you to arrive in good time.\n\n72 Miles - Ek Pravas (72 Miles - A Journey)\n\nLIFF Festival Screening: 2013\n\nDirector: Rajeev Patil\n\nStarring: Smita Tambe, Chinmay Sant, Chinmay Kambli, Sharvani Solaskar, Isha Mane.\n\nRun time: 96 mins | Certificate: 12A | Year: 2013\n\nLanguage: Marathi with English subtitles | Country: India\n\nAshok, a 13-year-old boy in 1970s India, is sent away to a borstal boarding school for disciplinary reasons cannot cope with the harsh rigours of the establishment and runs way.

Shubhobroto (Sengupta) is a young writer/director with a vision to re-make the master filmmaker Satyajit Ray’s classic film Nayak. He approaches the reigning superstar Arun Chatterjee (played by real-life super-hero Prasenjit Chatterjee) with the proposal.\n\nMuch to his surprise the movie-god agrees to fund the film and be its lead. Shubhobroto celebrates with his live-in girlfriend and budding actress Srinandita (Sen) and he drafts her in to play the film’s female lead. As the production develops, the promise of fame makes Shubho increasingly arrogant as he slips into his own world.\n\nMeanwhile Arun focuses his affections, on and off screen, on Srinandita and confides in her about his troubled past. The trio find themselves spiralling into a strange and yet poignant love triangle. With a talented ensemble cast and a compelling narrative, the film provides an insightful view into contemporary Kolkata society and a window into the inner workings of the Bengali film industry.\n\nBombay Talkies | UK Premiere\n\nLIFF Festival Screening: 2013\n\nDirector: Karan Johar, Dibakar Banerjee, Zoya Akhtar, Anurag Kashyap\n\nStarring: Amitabh Bachchan, Katrina Kaif, Randeep Hooda, Rani Mukerji, Saqib Saleem, Nawazuddin Siddiqui, Naman Jain, Vineet Kumar Singh.\n\nRun time: 127 mins | Certificate: 12A | Year: 2013\n\nLanguage: Hindi / Marathi with English subtitles | Country: India\n\nMumbai’s spectacular homage to 100 years of Indian cinema is a compilation of four films shot by some of its finest directors.

It also gives Tashi a chance to consider whether he wants to settle down to a suburban marriage with his nice airhostess and Mummy and Daddy in-laws, or take a bite of the wild side. Expect rickshaw chases, upset stomachs and of course, a riot of mix-ups and chases, with unsuspecting English tourists ducking for cover.\n\nExperimenta India - Liff @ The Tate Modern\n\nLIFF Festival Screening: 2012\n\n|\n\nEXPERIMENTA INDIA – LIFF @ THE TATE MODERN\n\nAlongside the commercial cinema of narrative and spectacle in India, there has always been another practice call it avant-garde, experimental, or artists’ film and video. Since its inception in 2003, Experimenta, the independent international festival for experimental cinema in India, has become a significant forum in South Asia for the exhibition, discussion, and dissemination of ideas about new genres of film. Shai Heredia, Experimenta’s Festival Director, has curated this programme featuring two screenings of recent innovations in moving image art from India.\n\nEXPERIMENTA INDIA 1\n\nDuration | 57 mins\n\nTate Modern | Starr Auditorium\n\nPRESENCE | Ekta Mittal and Yashaswini Raghunandan | India 2012 | Colour | Sound | HD | 18 mins\n\nPresence is the second film from the Behind the Tin Sheets Archive. Landscapes shift, people move from place to place – time passes and spaces evolve. Through this metamorphosis, new things try to replace the old. Some remain and linger and some go missing and disappear. We remember and we also forget. Between this, we encounter the invisible. This film reflects the subconscious of migrant workers against an urban landscape in metamorphosis. As they carry their stories in and out of many cities, the cities bear witness to these fragments. A point of impermanence and permanence collide, in close proximity with the filmmakers’ haunt within the city. Suspended from time and space, the familiar begins to render the unfamiliar.\n\nRESIDUE | Sonal Jain and Mriganka Madhukaillya | India 2011 | Colour | Sound | 35mm | 39 mins\n\nThis film was shot in a redundant Thermal power plant in the outskirts of the city of Guwahati. It forms a response to the artists’ interest in constructed signs that can never be replicated or remembered and in the relationship between matter and memory. There is an endless circularity and an unbearable silence — the pause A point of impermanence and permanence collide, in close proximity with the filmmakers’ haunt within the city. Suspended from time and space, the familiar begins to render the unfamiliar.\n\nEXPERIMENTA INDIA 2\n\nDuration | 59 mins\n\nTate Modern | Starr Auditorium\n\nJAN VILLA | Natasha Mendonca | India 2012 | Colour + B&W | Sound | 16mm transferred to HD | 20 mins\n\nAfter the monsoon floods in 2005 that submerged Bombay, the filmmaker returns to her native city to examine the personal impact of this devastating event. The result is Jan Villa, a tapestry of images that studies the space of a post-colonial metropolis but in a way that deeply implicates the personal. The destruction wreaked by the floods becomes a telling and a dismantling of other devastations and the sanctuaries of family and home. In its structure, Jan Villa is a vortex, drawing to its center all that surrounds it.\n\nCITY BEYOND | Shreyasi Kar | India 2011 | Colour | Sound | 35mm | 10 mins\n\nCity Beyond is a film that speculates about the lives led by inhabitants of a submerged civilisation. The superstructure has been recently discovered in the crevices of the ocean floor. The film moves through the submerged landscape, gathering glimpses of life, times and the end of a lost society.\n\nTHERE IS SOMETHING IN THE AIR | Iram Ghufran | India 2011 | Colour | Sound | 35mm | 29 mins\n\nThere is Something in the Air is a call from the periphery of sanity. A series of dream narratives and accounts of spiritual possession as experienced by women ‘petitioners’ at the shrine of a Sufi saint in northern India. Drama unfolds via dreams, appearances of djinns and disappearances of women. The shrine becomes a space for expressions of longing and transgression. The film invites the viewer to a fantastical world, where fear and desire is experienced through dreams and ‘afflictions of air’. The shrine is a space where performance becomes the only rule of engagement, and one can begin to think about the possibilities that ‘insanity’ produces.\n\nFire + Introduction by Bidisha Mamata\n\nLIFF Festival Screening: 2023\n\nDirector: Deepa Mehta\n\nStarring: Shabana Azmi, Nandita Das, Kulbhushan Kharbanda\n\nRun time: 108 mins | Certificate: 15 | Year: 1996\n\nLanguage: English, Hindi with English subtitles | Country: India, Canada\n\nNandita Das and Shabana Azmi give superb performances as two unhappily married women living in Delhi who fall in love in Deepa Mehta’s powerful melodrama.\n\nRadha (Shabana Azmi) is unwavering in her devotion to her husband, Ashok (Kulbushan Kharbanda), despite their passionless arranged marriage. Meanwhile, Ashok’s brother Jatin (Jaaved Jaaferi) has brought home his new wife, Sita (Nandita Das), but is unwilling to give up his relationship with his Chinese girlfriend. Gradually, a slow-burning love blossoms between the two women.\n\nLoosely based on Ismat Chughtai’s short story “Lihaaf” (“The Quilt”), which became the subject of an obscenity trial in India in 1942, Fire, the first of Deepa Mehta’s ‘Elements’ trilogy, was the subject of violent protests in India, with extremists hurling Molotov cocktails at the screens. It remains an intensely powerful and beautifully acted romance, which kick-started a national conversation about queer rights in India.\n\nIntroduction by Bidisha Mamata\n\nBidisha is a journalist, broadcaster and film- and stills-maker.

Starting as a stockroom assistant with EMI India he climbed to management within the company promoting Indian music. This soon took him into Hindi commercial cinema, where as a young man, his hard work and diligence caught the attention of movie moguls Yash and Aditya Chopra , who handpicked him to execute their vision to set up the company’s international operations.\n\nAs success followed, Avtar then ascended to greater heights moving back to India at Yash Raj Studios, Mumbai to be dynamically involved with this legendary company’s global expansion which now celebrates 50 years of movie-making.\n\nOnline at LoveLIFFAtHome.com\n\nJalsaghar (The Music Room)\n\nLIFF Festival Screening: 2019\n\nDirector: Satyajit Ray\n\nStarring: Chhabi Biswas, Sardar Akhtar, Gangapadu basu\n\nRun time: 99 mins | Certificate: U | Year: 1958\n\nLanguage: Bengali with English Subtitles | Country: India\n\nStrand: BENGAL TIGERS\n\nSatyajit Ray brilliantly evokes the crumbling opulence of the world of a fallen aristocrat, Roy (the beloved stage and screen actor Chhabi Biswas) desperately clinging to a fading way of life in his zamindar’s palace.

Towards the end of WW2 the Polish ambassadorial team in Bombay, led by the determined heroine, Kira Banasinska and supported by local Indian communities including the principalities of Kolhapur, Jamnagar and several others, dispatched a convoy of food relief and other essentials, thousands of miles to Iran, where Polish refugees from Soviet Siberian labour camps had found their way on foot and were suffering, mal-nourished. An expedition was planned with a novel idea, to bring 5,500 women and children back into India in the supplies trucks. This expedition was not so simple. It took Kira’s resilience and indefatigable energy as a Red Cross leader, to create refuge for them and welcome them to a dedicated settlement in India in three critical places, Vallivade, Panchgani and Jamnagar. Over 70 years later a number of now elderly Polish people return to a town, Vallivade, on the outskirts of Kolhapur, Maharashtra and Panchgani, where they were able to find safety and discover the joys of childhood.\n\nPlease remember there are no adverts before festival screenings so we encourage you to arrive in good time.\n\nQ&A with Director Anjali Bhushan\n\nNandita Das In Conversation\n\nLIFF Festival Screening: 2022\n\n|\n\nStrand: IN CONVERSATION\n\nNandita is one of those actors who seems to be loved everywhere she goes, none less than her roles at Cannes, where she has served twice as a jury member.

Robinson will explore Ray’s lesser-known close connection with French artists including filmmaker Jean Renoir and photographer Henri Cartier-Bresson, as well as provide an insight into Ray’s background, films and the making of Pather Panchali. Andrew Robinson will publish a centenary edition of Satyajit Ray: The Inner Eye with Bloomsbury in September.\n\nProbably Satyajit Ray’s most internationally acclaimed film. The Song of the Little Road as it is known in English, is based on Bibhutibhushan Bandyopadhyay’s 1929 Bengali novel of the same name. It depicts the childhood joys and struggles of the main protagonist Apu (Subir Banerjee), and his sister Durga (Uma Das Gupta), as they encounter both the beauty of the Bengali countryside, and also the cruel hardships of being the poor family of the village, after their father deserts them. This classic boasts magical cinematography by Subrata Mitra and an unforgettable musical score by Ravi Shankar.\n\nRamsingh Charlie\n\nLIFF Festival Screening: 2016\n\nDirector: Nitin Kakkar\n\nStarring: Kumud Mishra, Divya Dutta.\n\nRun time: 104 mins | Certificate: PG | Year: 2016\n\nLanguage: Hindi with English subtitles | Country: India\n\nIn this tragi-comic tale, Ramsingh, a Charlie Chaplin impersonator, performs in a travelling circus.

Kumud Mishra, known for his roles in Bollywood blockbusters like Rockstar and Airlift, delivers the performance of his life as Charlie, blending pathos and comedy into a bravura package. This is one of those rare films that will have you wiping a tear while at the same time grinning broadly.\n\nSatyajit Ray Short Film Competition 2011\n\nLIFF Festival Screening: 2011\n\nDirector: Various\n\nStarring: Various\n\nRun time: 95 mins | Certificate: 12A |\n\nLanguage: Various, with English subtitles | Country: India/UK\n\n2011 WINNER: AMAR\n\nLIFF has once again teamed up with the Satyajit Ray Foundation to present its prestigious Satyajit Ray Foundation Competition.

It was world premiered at Toronto Film Festival and has since been a hit at festivals around the world. Shahid (Raj Kumar Yadav) is a young Muslim man who gets drawn into a radical group and joins a militant camp in Pakistan Kashmir. He however realises violence is not his path and escapes the camp, but is caught by the police and ends up in Delhi’s Tihar Jail. Here he meets his mentor who encourages the bright young man to study a law degree. On release the dynamic Shahid throws himself into hottest part of the legal system, defending Muslims accused of acts of terrorism by the state. As his success in getting acquittals cause dark powers to gather against him, Shahid takes on his greatest and most controversial case, defending one of the men accused of the 2008 Mumbai terrorist attacks. The film is sharply shot and edited and it offers a vivid insight into the legal and political mechanisms of modern India.\n\nShonajhurir Bhoot (Ghost of the Golden Groves)\n\nLIFF Festival Screening: 2019\n\nDirector: Aniket Dutta & Roshni Sen\n\nStarring: Joyraj Bhattacharjee, Soumyajit Majumder, Debleena Sen, Bidyut Das\n\nRun time: 98 mins | Certificate: 15 | Year: 2019\n\nLanguage: Bengali with English subtitles | Country: India\n\nStrand: BENGAL TIGERS\n\nSurreal and unnerving, debutants Dutt and Sen deliver a fresh hybrid style to the scifi genre. In the first tale of this delightful diptych strange nocturnal incidents begin to occur to a government officer from Kolkata visiting the Shonajhuri forest area – eerie lights, anonymous voices, sinister wailing and a random encounter with a polymorph, all draw him deep into the treacherous web of the golden groves. In the second, based on a story by Bibutibhushan Bandyopadhyay (Pather Panchali), a poor cook gets the caretaker’s job at an abandoned house in the same forest and must deal with “the others”. Equal parts homage to Japanese New Wave horror like Onibaba and Woman In The Dunes, and the cinema of Satyajit Ray and Mrinal Sen, the film is breathtakingly original.\n\nPlease remember there are no adverts before festival screenings so we encourage you to arrive in good time.\n\nShongram (Struggle) | World Premiere\n\nLIFF Festival Screening: 2014\n\nDirector: Munsur Ali\n\nStarring: Anupam Kher, Asia Argento, Amaan Reza, Dilruba Yasmeen Ruhee.\n\nRun time: 103 mins | Certificate: 15 | Year: 2014\n\nLanguage: Bangla with English subtitles | Country: Bangladesh / UK\n\nIn this powerful romantic drama set during the 1971 liberation struggle of Bangladesh, a London reporter interviews a British Bengali on his deathbed, where four decades later, Karim is able to recall and finally share his past. We are transported to 1971, when Bangladesh was still East Pakistan and a young Karim (a Muslim) is in love with a beautiful Asha (a Hindu). Their peaceful village life is suddenly interrupted by war and Karim must grow up fast to survive in an era where mass killings and abduction was common. He must also carry out his duty to his people and seek revenge before he can finally search for Asha, who has gone missing. Bangladesh’s stunning vistas are captured as never seen before and act as a counterpoint to the brutal horrors of war. Profound, potent and poignant, the emotional swoop of this mesmerising film will enthral, entertain and educate in equal measure.\n\nShukno Lanka (Dry Red Chillies)\n\nLIFF Festival Screening: 2011\n\nDirector: Gaurav Pandey\n\nStarring: Mithun Chakraborty, Sabyasachi Chakraborty\n\nRun time: 110 mins | Certificate: 18 | Year: 2010\n\nLanguage: Hindi | Country: India\n\nIt may be a surprise to some that actor Mithun Chakraborty, Bollywood’s original Disco Dancer, is also a fine performer with some serious acting chops, having won the coveted Best Actor gong at India’s National Film Awards twice and Best Supporting Actor once. Here, he plays a veteran, bit-part actor Chinu Nandy, in the commercial Bengali film industry (aka Tollywood).\n\nNandy has resigned himself to lesser roles in the shadows of younger and less talented heroes, but gets the shock of his life when an award-winning director Joy Sundar Sen (Sabyasachi) decides to cast him as the lead in his next big film. Nandy feels distinctly uncomfortable with his return to the spotlight, but supported by his wife, musters his energy for his greatest performance.\n\nThis well scripted tale manages the triple feats of humorously skewering Tollywood practices, lampooning pretentious art-house filmmakers, but above all celebrating the pleasures of a happy marriage and growing old with your partner. This is a film that will leave you with a tear in your eye and a smile on your lips.\n\nSulemani Keeda (Writers) | European Premiere\n\nLIFF Festival Screening: 2014\n\nDirector: Amit V Masurkar\n\nStarring: Naveen Kasturia, Mayank Tewari, Aditi Vasudev.\n\nRun time: 89 mins | Certificate: 15 | Year: 2014\n\nLanguage: Hindi with English subtitles | Country: India / US\n\nTwo struggling writers dare to dream big and try to peddle their screenplay in Bollywood. Perennially hungry and horny, they lie, drink, hit on unsuspecting girls in bookshops and attend poetry readings where they read their vulgar verses. Things look bright when they meet a bizarre wannabe auteur who wants to make a film inspired by Tarkovsky and commissions them to come up with a script idea. When one of the writers falls in love with a woman who is leaving India in a matter of days, he is faced with a choice – whether to co-write a film he doesn’t believe in or woo the girl he has fallen in love with. This racy romp through the filmi underbelly of suburban Mumbai is also richly populated with a host of Bollywood celebrities in cameos, playing themselves. We’re not telling you who they are – come and find out for yourselves!\n\nThe Argumentative Indian\n\nLIFF Festival Screening: 2017\n\n|\n\nEuropean Premiere of The Argumentative Indian and a Q&A with Professor Amartya Sen.\n\nThe festival joins forces with the London School of Economics’ South Asia Centre to present this fascinating documentary offering an insight into the mind of Indian Nobel laureate Amartya Sen, one of the world’s greatest living economists and philosophers.\n\nStructured as a free-flowing conversation between Sen and his students and Cornell economics professor Kaushik Basu, this rare film explores the laureate’s formative years in Tagore’s ashram Shantiniketan to his college in Calcutta and his academic career in the US and UK, with cameos from former Indian prime minister and noted economist Manmohan Singh and a host of other scholars.\n\nThe screening will be followed by a Q&A with Professor Amartya Sen, chaired by Dr Mukulika Banerjee.\n\nThe London School of Economics, Sheikh Zayed Theatre, New Academic Building, 54 Lincoln’s Inn Fields WC2A 3LJ\n\nTuesday 27th June, 6.30 pm\n\nThe Lift Boy\n\nLIFF Festival Screening: 2019\n\nDirector: Jonathan Augustin\n\nStarring: Moin Khan, Nyla Masood, Saagar Kale\n\nRun time: 107 mins | Certificate: PG | Year: 2019\n\nLanguage: English, Hindi with English subtitles | Country: India\n\nStrand: YOUNG REBEL\n\nThe Lift Boy is a heart-warming entertainer that will leave you smiling from ear to ear.
