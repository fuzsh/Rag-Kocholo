        "text": "The Vicksburg District is posting a Special Public Notice seeking comments on the need for regional conditions to help ensure that the adverse environmental effects of activities authorized by the proposed 2020 Nationwide Permits (NWPs) are no more than minimal, individually and cumulatively to the resources in Mississippi. Division engineers are authorized to add regional conditions specific to the needs and/or requirements of a particular region or state. Division engineers may also suspend or revoke specific NWPs in certain geographic areas (e.g., states or watersheds) or high-value aquatic systems where the adverse environmental effects caused by activities authorized by those NWPs may be more than minimal. As the lead Corps district for the State of Mississippi, the Vicksburg District is not proposing to add regional conditions specific to Mississippi.\n\nAnnouncement: The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Vicksburg District, is hereby issuing Department of the Army GENERAL PERMIT 20, on behalf of the Public. GENERAL PERMIT 20 may be used to authorize Regulated Activities in waters of the United States associated with the construction, maintenance, repair, replacement, and/or removal of utility lines and associated facilities within the regulatory jurisdiction of the Vicksburg District in the states of Arkansas, Louisiana, and Mississippi, and the Memphis District in the states of Arkansas and Mississippi. Typical activities include open-cut trenching and backfilling and horizontal directional drilling for buried utility lines, fill for the construction of pole foundations and substations, compressor stations, pads, handhole covers, outfalls and associated intakes, aerial crossings over navigable waters, and temporary structures, fills, and work necessary to conduct the utility line activity. The effective date for GENERAL PERMIT 20 is September 28, 2020; the expiration date is September 28, 2025.\n\nComment Period Opens: 9/21/2020\n\nComment Period Closes: 10/21/2020\n\nRegulator: Mr. Bryan Williamson\n\nApplicant: The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Vicksburg District\n\nProject Description: The Vicksburg District is posting a Special Public Notice to announce the Clean Water Act Section 401 Certification Rule. Effective September 11, 2020, the “Clean Water Act (CWA) Section 401 Certification Rule” (Rule) is being implemented nationwide. The Rule establishes procedures that promote consistent implementation of CWA Section 401 and regulatory certainty in the federal permitting process. Section 401 of the CWA provides states and authorized tribes with an important tool to help protect the water quality of federally regulated waters within their borders, in collaboration with federal agencies. Section 401 of the CWA requires that, for any federally licensed or permitted project that may result in a discharge into waters of the United States, a water quality certification be issued to ensure that the discharge complies with applicable water quality requirements. The Rule addresses some key areas of the CWA Section 401 certification process, including timelines for review and action, the scope of certification review, and early engagement (pre-filing meetings).\n\nComment Period Opens: 07/01/2020\n\nComment Period Closes: 07/31/2020\n\nRegulator: Bryan Williamson and Jerry Bourne\n\nApplicant: The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Vicksburg and Memphis Districts\n\nProject Description: The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Vicksburg and Memphis Districts, are proposing the issuance of a Department of the Army General Permit (General Permit 20) for structures in or affecting waters of the United States and/or discharges of dredged and/or fill material into waters of the United States associated with the construction, maintenance, repair, replacement, and/or removal of utility lines and associated facilities within the regulatory jurisdiction of the Vicksburg District in the states of Arkansas, Louisiana, and Mississippi, and the Memphis District in the states of Arkansas and Mississippi. Typical activities include open-cut trenching and backfilling and horizontal directional drilling for buried utility lines, fill for the construction of pole foundations and substations, compressor stations, pads, handhole covers, outfalls and associated intakes, aerial crossings over navigable waters, and temporary structures, fills, and work necessary to conduct the utility line activity.\n\nRegulator: Bryan Williamson\n\nApplicant: Mr. Scott Urwick, Enable Gulf Run Transmission, LLC, c/o SWCA Environmental Consultants\n\nProject Description: The applicant is applying for a Department of the Army permit to conduct activities within jurisdictional areas for the purpose of installing a new natural gas transmission pipeline and for the modification of other existing pipeline facilities. The applicant will develop the proposed Gulf Run Pipeline originating in Red River Parish, crossing through De Soto, Sabine, Vernon, and Beauregard Parishes, and terminating in Calcasieu Parish, Louisiana. The Pipeline will consist of an approximate 134-mile-long, 42-inch-diameter, natural gas transmission pipeline, and related ancillary facilities, extending from a receipt point with the existing Line CP pipeline, to a delivery point at an interconnect with the existing Golden Pass pipeline near Starks, Louisiana. Approximately 36.31 miles of the proposed Pipeline will be constructed within the Vicksburg District, where the proposed Pipeline crosses portions of Red River, De Soto, and Sabine Parishes.
