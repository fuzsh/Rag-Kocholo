        "text": "This page has been several years in the making. Here you will find latitude and longitude coordinates for Winston County that include cemeteries, schools, and places. The places feature type also includes geographic features and towns. The coordinates are in degree, minute, second (DMS) format. To view these places, go to https://getlatlong.net/. Once there, scroll to the bottom of the page, enter the coordinates, and click on the \"Show Point\" button. Be sure to include the minus sign (-) in front of the longitude coordinates. A map will appear with a balloon over the exact point. You can then view this in map, satellite, hybrid, or terrain views.
