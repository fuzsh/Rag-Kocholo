        "text": "Introduction\n\nA map is a graphical representation, usually in two dimensions, of Earth’s surface, an ocean floor, a night sky, or another large area. Some three-dimensional models and diagrams of complex topics, flows, and changes over time are also called maps (for example, a genetic map). Conceptions of the larger world and a person’s place in it, including sketches of the world as a person imagines it, may be called mental or cognitive maps.\n\nBecause world maps are drawn on a flat surface, they cannot show Earth’s curved surface without significant distortions. Globes help to counter that problem. A globe is a spherical representation of a planet’s surface or another large area. It is usually mounted on an axle that allows for rotation. A globe can show a planet without distortion because of its rounded shape, although Earth—as well as most other planets—is not a perfect sphere but bulges a bit at the Equator. However, people use globes less often than maps because of their bulk and greater cost.\n\nMaps and globes are tools for planning trips, learning about faraway locales, and studying movements of people, goods, and information. Maps can be misleading, however; their crisp lines, bright colors, and labels may not always represent the truth. In reality, all maps and globes have some distortions, deletions, and simplifications associated with the intended use of the map, the makers’ biases, political influences, and economic factors.\n\nA map comes in a variety of forms and may be labeled in different terms. For example, a house or small area is mapped as a site plan or floor plan, a surveyed property in a plat survey. A navigation map (for sailing or flying) is a chart. The sky is mapped in star charts and in star, stellar, or planetary maps as well as on zodiac globes, celestial globes, and models of stellar movement called armillary spheres.\n\nCartography, the study of maps and the art and science of making them, is a subdiscipline of geography, but many other disciplines, especially in the social sciences, also have mapmakers. In addition, amateurs draw maps every day, from driving directions on napkins to imaginary landscapes in sandboxes.\n\nReading a Map or Globe\n\nMap styles and symbols vary across cultures, but most published maps share details in common. Maps should show a date of compilation or publication to give the user a frame of reference. They may include place names (labels), a scale (to compare sizes), a grid (to find locations), a guide to symbols, and an arrow pointing north or a compass rose (showing the four cardinal directions).\n\nIntuitive Searches and Basic Grids\n\nOne strategy for reading a map is to look first for familiar shapes or outlines (the Florida peninsula, the Horn of Africa, the boot of Italy), oceans and inlets (the long Red Sea or the shorter Persian Gulf), the telltale arcs of mountains (the Andes as the spine of South America; the Himalayas north of India, covering Nepal and Bhutan), or the blue swoops of rivers and fanning deltas. It may be helpful to find a familiar city, road, or other landmark. After obtaining a general overview of the map, more complex symbols and information can be explored.\n\nBasic map grids place letters across the top (A, B, C, etc.) and numbers on the side (1, 2, 3, etc.), or vice versa. If an index lists a site as B4, for example, a person can trace down from the B and across from the 4 to find the sought-after destination. Most tourist maps and road maps use this kind of basic grid.\n\nLatitude and Longitude\n\nWorld maps show the latitude and longitude coordinates of Earth. Lines of longitude, or meridians, are drawn from the North Pole to the South Pole and show distances east or west from the prime meridian (0 degrees longitude, running through Greenwich, England). Lines of latitude, which intersect meridians at right angles, are called parallels because they parallel the Equator (0 degrees latitude), from which they measure north or south.\n\nThere are 360 degrees in a circle, and longitude measures to 180 degrees east or west (180 + 180 = 360) until arriving at a point in the mid-Pacific Ocean, on or near the International Date Line (the imaginary line running between the North Pole and the South Pole and distinguishing each calendar day from the next). Likewise, latitude runs to the North Pole (90 degrees north) and the South Pole (90 degrees south)—adding up to 360 degrees if we see a globe in cross section (90 + 90 on one side, 90 + 90 on the other). Each degree is divided into 60 minutes, each minute 60 seconds. Computers can show these as decimals: for example, 21 degrees and 45 minutes is 21.75 degrees, because 45 minutes is three-fourths of a degree, or 0.75 as a decimal.\n\nScale\n\nA scale is a mathematical relationship, or ratio, between actual sizes and the sizes shown on a map. If one centimeter on the map equals 10 actual kilometers, the ratio can be written 1:1,000,000 (there are 1 million centimeters in 10 kilometers) or it may be shown as a line marked with distances. There is no ideal map scale. It is a compromise between two conflicting aims—the desire to show details while covering as much area as possible. Large-scale maps cover smaller areas, just as cameras with large zoom lenses provide close-ups, whereas small-scale maps show wider areas with less detail.\n\nMap and Globe Orientation\n\nPeople often assume that the top of a map should point north; however, map orientation is a choice, not a natural law, and it is subject to political, economic, religious, and aesthetic desires. Muslim mapmakers such as 12th-century geographer ash-Sharif al-Idrisi often placed south at the top of their works. Many medieval European maps were oriented toward the east, out of the belief that the Holy Land and the biblical Garden of Eden were the most important areas in the world. The word orient (as in “map orientation”) derives from the Latin oriens (“east”), so to orient oneself once meant to face east or to place east at the top.\n\nNothing is inherently wrong with a map topped by the South Pole or Chile, yet it seems odd to many people. Meanwhile, north-oriented maps reinforce notions of European and North American power, of being on top of the world. Video games and GPS (global positioning systems) in phones or in cars allow the user to change map orientations and to view landscapes at oblique angles. “You Are Here” maps (in shopping malls, at tourist sites, at festivals, etc.) are most useful when oriented by line-of-sight, rather than by compass points.\n\nMap Symbols\n\nSome map symbols are readily understood, but others require a legend (key or index of symbols) because they vary by culture, mapping custom, and individual choice. Indigenous peoples of the Americas, for example, once used cross-shapes to indicate stars, while Spanish conquistadors used them to represent churches and towns. Blue lines were used in mid-20th-century American road maps for back roads, made famous in travel writer William Least Heat-Moon’s book Blue Highways: A Journey into America (1982).\n\nOn conventional maps, black lines usually symbolize roads, tick-marked lines are railroads, circles or stars are cities, and shading or dark lines are contours (lines that indicate elevations). Green and brown may shade real-world features (green forests, brown deserts), but colors sometimes indicate elevations. This coloring may cause confusion where, for example, green shading (indicating low elevation) covers a hot, dry, brown desert.\n\nAdvantages of Globes and Atlases\n\nAlthough globes are unwieldy and more expensive than maps, they show how Earth is tilted (about 23.5 degrees) and how this relates to day lengths and the seasons. For example, when in a dark room, a person can shine a flashlight (representing the Sun) on one side of a globe to demonstrate how sunlight reaches half the tilted Earth while leaving the rest in shadow, according to the season. Globes also show shapes, sizes, and lines without distortions.\n\nGlobes can help people plan long-distance travel routes. If a person pulls a string between two cities on its curved surface, the string will follow the shortest path, called a great circle route. On such a route, airplanes from the United States to Europe fly north-northeast rather than straight east, though on a map it is easy to plot—mistakenly—the eastern route.\n\nGlobes often display an analemma, a figure-eight-shaped diagram showing the subsolar point (the latitude where the Sun reaches its highest, 90-degree angle in the sky and is directly overhead) on each date of the year. Other globes indicate the subsolar point by marking dates on a line that undulates from tropic to tropic and crosses the Equator.\n\nComputer maps and computerized atlases offer multimedia games, quick searches, and simulated 3-D globes and maps, but print atlases remain popular. Both print and electronic atlases are created by teams of skilled writers, editors, cartographers, and artists. With a medley of reference data, indexes, maps, photos, and diagrams, they offer enough variety for repeat reading and browsing.\n\nTypes of Terrestrial Maps\n\nThe most popular maps are road maps, political maps (showing countries, states, or counties), physical maps (of mountains, rivers, etc.), and thematic maps (focusing on one or two themes, such as income, livestock, or health insurance). General reference maps include a mixture of information, as do many road, political, and physical maps.\n\nTransportation Maps\n\nRoad maps, called street maps or street plans in a town, blend political and physical data. GPS and Web-based aids such as Google Maps and MapQuest include them as base maps. When these are outdated, however, mistakes can occur, such as green fields appearing where malls have been built and streets continuing where they show up as dead ends. As a GPS is moved, it plots satellite coordinates on the base map, and the display shows a shifting, turning icon to give the illusion that the map is being generated on the run.\n\nSome maps are designed for cyclists, tourists, or hikers. Aviation charts mark air routes and major obstacles or features on the ground. Shipping charts do the same for maritime traffic. Since at least the early 1900s, commuters have used transit maps on metropolitan buses, trains, and subways. Simplified transit maps, called diagrammatic maps, were introduced in 1933 in London, England. Seldom more than lists of stations along a line, these omit or abbreviate street names, directions, and landmarks useful for orientation. Although diagrammatic maps can be useful, their lack of detail may be confusing to millions of passengers each year.\n\nPolitical Maps\n\nCountries, provinces, and counties are the focus of political maps. Their bright colors and crisp borderlines encourage geographic literacy but are deceptively simple: they tell only partial truths about nations and borders that are shifting or arbitrary. These maps do not show, for example, that many borders are not even lined by walls or fences. Moreover, they eventually change as countries disintegrate (such as the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia), are renamed (Zaire/Congo and Myanmar/Burma), or reunify (Germany).\n\nPhysical Maps\n\nRivers, lakes, mountains, hills, deserts, vegetation, and other natural features are on physical maps. Beyond Earth’s surface, these maps may detail seafloors, ocean and air currents, and subterranean resources. Topographic maps symbolize relief with dark shading or hachure and rill marks (short lines indicating slope). Some show elevations with contours (lines of progressively greater height, such as 50, 60, and 70 feet). Contours drawn close together indicate steeper slopes (grades, or gradients).\n\nOlder maps depict highlands with idealized sketches of molehills or snowcapped peaks rather than with detailed sketches of mountains and plateaus. Some maps and globes are made with raised bumps along mountain ranges. An entertaining and useful memory tool, this kind of vertical exaggeration nevertheless gives a misleading sense of elevation, since Earth’s diameter is nearly 8,000 miles (12,875 kilometers) while mountains rise less than 5.5 miles (9 kilometers).\n\nThematic Maps\n\nIf a map focuses on the symbolic display of statistics, or themes, it is called a thematic map. These maps may focus on language, religion, income, population density, or any other kind of measurable data. Some depict processes such as toxic spills, seismicity, or the geologic history of continental drift. The most common types use shading, line patterns, or dots to indicate different measures. Flow maps often use arrows to indicate change or movement. Choropleth maps use shades of color to represent different measures or values. For example, U.S. states with higher rates of imprisonment might be shaded orange while those with lower incarceration rates might be shaded gray.\n\nThematic maps can be misleading because they eliminate marginal statistics and minority views. An election (suffrage) map, for instance, might shade a state red if 50.1 percent of its voters opt for a Republican candidate; however, overgeneralizing by calling this a “red state” (as news media often do) unfairly ignores the other 49.9 percent of the electorate there.\n\nCartograms\n\nAnother statistical mapping device is the cartogram, which is sometimes called a specialized thematic map. Cartograms involve more artwork than normal maps, as they freely distort shapes, directions, and areas beyond normal ranges to illustrate or explain statistics. A cartogram “weights” the sizes of states, provinces, or countries to reflect values: a large number swells an area while a small number shrinks it. For example, a comparison of weapons exports by country would show a bloated United States (the world’s top arms exporter) as would cartograms of prison populations, Internet users, or miles driven. A population cartogram would bloat the outlines of India and China.\n\nExtraterrestrial Maps: Stellar Cartography\n\nEarth maps are terrestrial maps (the Latin word terra means Earth, as in terrain or territory), so extraterrestrial maps look beyond Earth. Maps of objects in the sky are called star charts, star maps, or stellar maps. Stars and constellations were depicted on maps and celestial globes centuries before most land surfaces were mapped, and travelers used this traditional knowledge to guide them across distant lands and seas. Sun and star positions were incorporated into the design of sextants, astrolabes, and other navigational aids.\n\nPowerful telescopes, radar, and spacecraft have extended cartography’s reach from Earth to the Moon (lunar charts/maps), the Sun (solar charts of the almost fluid photosphere and shifting sunspots), the solar system, and beyond. When Earth was first photographed from space in 1959, people envisioned global connections like never before. Since then, photos and scans by satellites and space explorers have increased Earth map accuracy.\n\nThe Moon has been featured in the myths of nearly every human culture, but it has been mapped carefully only since the 1500s when Italian astronomer Galileo turned one of the world’s first telescopes on it. He used geometry to determine the heights of lunar mountains by measuring shadows, but he could not see the Moon well enough to stop calling its darker, smoother areas seas. Lunar maps improved with better telescopes, and astronauts in the late 1960s and ’70s were the first to see and chart the pockmarked far side of the Moon (the side that is not visible from Earth).\n\nExperts combine a series of pictures from spacecraft, Earth-based radar, and the Hubble Space Telescope to create maps of planets, moons, and other bodies. Satellites and robotic explorers have mapped Mars and the veiled surface of Venus, and from 2011 to 2015 the Messenger spacecraft charted Mercury. These maps incur special problems, such as the lack of sea level (standard on Earth maps) and the need to choose a prime meridian (since it is not a natural line). Astronomers now have evidence of large planets orbiting hundreds of distant stars, and artists produce enticing (though fictitious) renderings of them since they have not yet been glimpsed (nor mapped) by human eyes. The surface mapping of these distant planets will not be possible without greatly enhanced telescopes or space probes.\n\nMap Projections: Necessary Distortions\n\nAll maps make selective omissions and distortions, beginning when an image is transferred from a globe. If Earth were flat, it could easily be displayed; however, its spherical shape cannot be flattened without distorting distances (areas), shapes, or directions. Experts now use mathematical formulae to help make maps; such renderings are called map projections because they were originally made by shining a lamp inside a transparent globe to trace projected images on a screen. The image shifted according to the placement of the lamp and screen. Every projection has pros and cons and may be disputed for political, academic, and aesthetic motives. Although an infinite variety of projections can be created, the more popular are cylindrical, conic, planar, equal-area, and “compromise” projections.\n\nCylindrical projections are among the most commonly used, partly because navigators prefer their straight north-south lines (meridians of longitude). To make this projection, a cylinder is placed over the globe. Its sides touch only along the Equator, the only latitude where sizes are shown accurately. After the source of light is applied and the lines from the globe are transferred to the cylinder, the cylinder is cut and rolled out flat.\n\nThe most famous cylindrical projection, the Mercator—devised by Flemish cartographer Gerardus Mercator in the 16th century—remains highly controversial. In the 1800s its popularity was unequaled. Some users liked how it made British (and other European) lands appear larger than they were. It remained popular during the Cold War, when its exaggeration of the size of the Soviet Union highlighted fears of Communist aggression. Among other distortions, it makes Greenland seem larger than South America, although it is only one-eighth its size.\n\nConic projections are made by projecting light to paper rolled into a cone shape. The sides of the cone touch the globe at one or two parallels of latitude, while the cone’s tip usually hovers over the North or South Pole. The parallels of latitude through which the cone passes are the only undistorted places on the map, which is why cartographers often use them for extensive east-west areas such as those of Canada or Russia.\n\nPlanar (plane, or azimuthal) projections are transferred onto a flat plane (such as a piece of paper) touching the globe at one spot. Common types of planar projections are the polar, gnomonic, and orthographic. A polar projection touches the North or South Pole and is often used to map Antarctica or the Arctic. A gnomonic projection is generated from the center of the globe, so, as with the planar projection, a straight line from its focal point follows true north or south. Any such straight line on a gnomonic projection is a great circle route. The orthographic projection originates from the globe’s opposite side and resembles photos taken from space. All planar projections increasingly distort sizes and shapes near the map edges because of the globe’s curved surface.\n\nEqual-area projections show correct sizes while distorting shapes and directions. These maps are useful for comparing geographic statistics. In 1772 Swiss German mathematician Johann Heinrich Lambert proposed an equal-area projection as an alternative to the Mercator, and in the 1800s Scottish clergyman and mapmaker James Gall devised a similar view by stretching landmasses north-south. Such nontraditional views of the world remained unpopular until the 1970s, when German historian Arno Peters lobbied to replace the Mercator with “a new geography—based on the equal status of [the world’s] peoples.” Despite aesthetic and professional criticisms—for example, American geographer Arthur H. Robinson derided Peters’s elongated landmasses as “reminiscent of wet, ragged, long winter underwear hung out to dry on the Arctic Circle”—the World Council of Churches, UNESCO, UNICEF, and several nongovernmental organizations endorsed the Peters projection.\n\nRobinson developed his own compromise, or composite, projection by attempting to balance different distortions. His effort resulted in an attractive, general-purpose map with less exaggeration at high latitudes. This map was featured in numerous National Geographic issues and was widely used in classrooms and textbooks.\n\nOther composite projections include sinusoidal maps and the Goode’s Interrupted Homolosine. These slice up the world (usually through the oceans) like a peeled orange. They limit shape distortions while also serving as equal-area maps useful for statistical comparisons. Many people find them more attractive than the Peters projection; however, such “peeled” Earths can be confusing because they cut up oceans (complicating the mapping of currents and wind patterns) and they curve the meridians of longitude in different ways, bending them westward in some sections and eastward in others.\n\nOther Types of Map Distortions\n\nMaps are not mirrors or clear “windows on the world” but rather imperfect models, the way a model airplane is an imperfect simplified version of an airplane, not a magically miniaturized airplane. Flat maps cannot adequately re-create a three-dimensional world. In addition, maps may simplify, generalize, reconfigure, and delete certain content. Mapmakers and users (of atlases and computer maps with toggling features) choose what they want to see, showing some details but omitting others.\n\nMap omissions have often abetted conquest. When the young United States expanded westward, it ignored Indigenous land claims, and the empty spaces on its maps fed the myth of an unoccupied wilderness. Indigenous peoples lacked map evidence for their later land claims just as they lacked “legal” documents. Mapping practices have often reflected the interests of powerful classes and corporations, but sometimes they aid the underdog, as when geographers record Indigenous claims to help people defend themselves in court.\n\nCartographers must try to go beyond being merely accurate because of the historical abuses and struggles linked with mapmaking. Several national atlases, for instance, dispute overlapping slices of Antarctica; moreover, several also claim the Spratly Islands; and Venezuela’s atlas claims two-thirds of Guyana’s territory. Cartographers wishing to be impartial will struggle with these matters, just as they will choose between various types and spellings of place names. What the Japanese call the Sea of Japan the Koreans call the East Sea. To use only one name is to risk offending millions. Indian maps label Kashmir as a region belonging to India, whereas Pakistani maps have it belonging to Pakistan. India has strict censorship laws, and its government has blocked importation of maps and books that do not support its map claims.\n\nMaps include many kinds of borders. Geometric boundaries are lines along a degree of latitude or longitude that ignore physical or cultural barriers, such as the 49th parallel on the U.S.-Canada border. When slicing up maps of Africa, Europeans drew arbitrary geometric boundaries through the lands of many ethnic and linguistic groups, without regard for the wishes of the African peoples.\n\nEthnographic boundaries are attempts to divide areas with different cultural traits (such as language, ethnic heritage, or religion). These may be attempts to create nation-states just as European borders were drawn after World War I. When borders are shifted, people may flee by the millions to avoid becoming ethnic minorities, but, despite attempts to draw ethnographic borders, there are only a handful of true nation-states in the world—that is, countries (such as Japan or Serbia) whose citizens pertain almost exclusively to one national group. Instead, the world has an abundance of multinational and multiethnic states, including Russia, Canada, the United States, Mexico, France, and China.\n\nMap boundaries might reveal nationalistic biases, yet even natural lines are blurred. On maps of vegetation and climate regions, for example, clear dividing lines are designated. In reality, however, these are average numbers—not absolutes but compromises at that scale. The Sahara is shifting and growing, but a border drawn around the desert might ignore its spreading dunes and delineate instead a zone dozens or hundreds of miles wide, where rainfall averages 10 inches (35 millimeters) per year.\n\nOther map decisions are based on expediency, tradition, and hidden (often unintentional) biases. Most world maps show place names for oceans and seas, but there are few ways to decide on boundaries between them. Even the seven continents that many American children learn about in school (some countries teach the five- or six-continent model) are disputed by some geographers as the “myth of continents.” They argue that the arbitrary divisions of landmasses are based more on cultural traditions than on physical evidence.\n\nHistory of Maps and Globes\n\nMaps have been created for thousands of years with different intentions, materials, and results. There is no single history of mapmaking, but even the earliest maps were linked with religious and social (political) power. Increasingly, maps have been used to claim lands, mark borders, plan military actions, and assist in mining, farming, and exploration.\n\nAncient cultures knew little of Earth’s surface and mapped less of it, but they habitually used celestial navigation, fixed (in the Northern Hemisphere) on Polaris—the North Star. Few knew the zodiac signs of the ancient Greeks, nor did they need to, since they already knew their own constellations. These early peoples traced the sky with maps, sundials, temples, natural markers, and interactive models such as England’s stone structures at Stonehenge and Avebury. Some celestial maps and diagrams illustrated religious myths, hero journeys, and guides for or paths of the dead.\n\nIt is unclear when people first made maps in the dirt or as patterns of sticks, stones, and shells. Rock (petroglyph) maps date from about 40,000 years ago, when Venus statuettes and cave paintings became widespread. Maps carved in stone were likely socially and emotionally significant, given the effort needed to create them. Ski-borne hunters in Karelia, Russia, made a stone map of an elk path between 3000 and 1000 bc. About 2,000 years ago in the French-Italian Alps, stone maps showed villages and farmlands. Clearly, stone was not the only material used. One of the oldest surviving clay maps (the Gasur, or Nuzi, map found near Kirkuk, Iraq, in the 1930s) dates from about 2300 bc.\n\nEarly Mesopotamian and Mediterranean Maps\n\nBy the time of the first towns and cities, ancient maps focused on farms, canals, and other properties. A clay tablet from Nippur (an ancient city of Mesopotamia, now in southeastern Iraq) from about 1500 bc shows irrigated estates; it may be one of the first city plans drawn to scale. A papyrus map from the same period shows Egyptian gold mines, roads, and buildings near the Red Sea. About 1300 bc the Egyptian pharaoh Ramses II led land surveys because the Nile River flooded annually and eroded landmarks in the densely populated floodplain.\n\nIn the 7th century bc, the ancient Babylonians produced maps of the cities of Babylon and Madakta. A map of the world (in a highly conceptualized form) was depicted on a Babylonian clay tablet in the 5th century bc. The Babylonians divided the arc of the sky into 360 degrees, a basic tenet of geometry that is still in use for arcs and globes.\n\nThe ancient Greeks imagined a circular river or sea bordering the world. Homer’s 8th-century bc epic poem on the Trojan War, the Iliad, describes an idealized world map on the shield of Achilles, featuring a city at war, a city at peace, and farms. In the 500s bc, philosopher Anaximander of Miletus created a globe and a world map, and about 501 bc, historian Hecateus of Miletus compiled a world geography. These events were followed in the mid-400s bc by the global narrative history produced by Herodotus.\n\nGeography permeated Greek thought: mathematician and philosopher Pythagoras referred to the world as a sphere, and maps even appeared on Greek coins about 330 bc. About 200 bc the librarian of Alexandria, Eratosthenes of Cyrene, estimated the world’s circumference by measuring shadows along the same meridian. About ad 127–150, Egyptian geographer and astronomer Ptolemy made his own—albeit inaccurate—estimate and compiled a gazetteer called the Geographia. (A greatly respected standard of cartography, it was revised several times over the following centuries.) The Romans produced updated maps of the world as they knew it as well as detailed city maps, and several mosaic and fresco maps of the Byzantine Empire still survive.\n\nChinese and South Asian Maps\n\nMaps were part of a long seagoing tradition in South Asia and along the shores of the Indian Ocean, but few of those maps survive today. Religious and geographic imagery were combined on some maps, including on a 15th-century world map associated with the peaceful Jain religion in India.\n\nChina’s early maps focused on myth and astronomy as much as elsewhere. One Chinese tomb included a bronze-engraved map of a mausoleum from about 400 bc. By the 3rd century ad, scholar Pei Xion made maps using scales, accurate distances, elevations, and gradients. The Chinese used wood, paper, silk, and bamboo for government maps, but few have survived apart from those carved in stone. A notable exception is the Da Ming hunyi tu, or the Amalgamated Map of the Great Ming Empire. Painted on silk about 1389, it is the oldest known map to show the outline of the entire continent of Africa. In the 600s ad, Chinese bookmaking technologies made atlases more available; an atlas by Chu Ssu-pen from the late 13th or early 14th century showed most of China and located the Indian Ocean and the Congo and Nile rivers.\n\nIn the early 1400s the Pacific and Indian Ocean voyages of admiral and diplomat Zheng He greatly expanded Chinese knowledge. But even as European exploration began to spread throughout the world, the Chinese curtailed and then outlawed far-flung expeditions, to focus only on local and regional maps. For example, in 1579 cartographer Luo Hongxian’s Guang yutu atlas depicted post offices, forts, roads, cities, and waterways. The Chinese had long used grids, but they upgraded to latitude and longitude after a visit from the European Jesuit missionary Matteo Ricci (1552–1610).\n\nMaps in the Ancient Americas\n\nCivilizations in the ancient Americas reflected different cultural concerns and perceptions than Europeans. Early maps were carved as petroglyphs and also appeared on ceramic amulets, pots, and textiles. Many combined stylized art and maps to show physical landscapes as well as mythical space and time.\n\nAmong the idealized maps of the cosmos in South America were the Bennett stela in Tiwanaku (present-day Bolivia), the Tello obelisk of the ancient Chavín de Huántar site (Peru), and gourds and amulets from Paracas (Peru). Such works illustrated calendars, myths, an underworld replete with spiritual labyrinths, and the Milky Way as a river or a great caiman. Ceramic models of houses appeared in ancient Moche (Peru) and Paracas, and others showed deities emerging from caves. The Nazca Lines in southern Peru may have mapped water sources, pilgrimage routes, boundaries, or mystical pathways. The Incas carved plans of cities into huge stones. Dancers, priests, rulers, and even captives acted out virtual maps at religious festivals.\n\nNo South American maps were made of paper, but in Mesoamerica (Mexico and Central America) paper and paperlike materials were used for booklike codices. Aztec and Maya codices and maps included hieroglyphics representing major sites and rulers, stylized rivers and caves, and footprints showing where kings, heroes, or gods traveled.\n\nIndigenous peoples of North America also made and used maps, though few have survived. In 1683 Indigenous mapmakers provided a Susquehanna River map to an English trader, and in 1804–06 maps were sketched to help explorers Meriwether Lewis and William Clark—along with Sacagawea—find their way westward.\n\nMaps, Dark Ages, and “Discovery”\n\nBefore the modern age, European maps were no better (and often worse) than maps elsewhere. Medieval Europeans printed idealized “T-O” or “T-in-O” world maps. Based on religion rather than exploration, these maps were topped by the East (Oriens) and Asia, where medieval Europeans believed Earthly Paradise (the Garden of Eden) could be found. Europe and Africa were labeled on either side of a (vertical) Mediterranean Sea, topped by another body of water linking the Black Sea and the Red Sea and forming a “T” in the map’s center. An outer watery circle (a river or ocean called the Mare Oceanus) gave the map an “O” outline. The Hereford Mappa Mundi (circa ad 1300) is a T-O map displaying biblical stories, battles, and monsters.\n\nAlthough European mapmaking slowed in the Dark Ages, Arabic libraries guarded the knowledge of Greece and of new maps, including shipping charts. Al-Idrisi made a world map and 70 regional maps showing the Mediterranean and the Indian Ocean coast, and Moroccan explorer Ibn Battutah charted 75,000 miles of Asia, Africa, and the Indian Ocean in the 1300s.\n\nIn the late 1400s, world navigator Christopher Columbus obtained Ptolemy’s (inaccurate) estimate for the size of Earth, which was one-third too small. Had he instead used the more-accurate estimate by Eratosthenes of Cyrene, he might not have dared to make his voyage over such a great distance to uncharted lands. Rather than naming these new lands Columbia, after Columbus, the German cartographer Martin Waldseemüller inserted the name America on a 1507 map in honor of Italian explorer-navigator Amerigo Vespucci’s voyages to the New World. Early maps of the Americas included bizarre miscalculations, but these maps nevertheless helped spread the rebirth of arts and sciences.\n\nAs the Middle Ages gave way to the Renaissance, more utilitarian maps appeared, such as portolan charts, which were navigational aids made for sailors from the 14th to the 16th centuries. These traced many coastlines accurately and showed rhumb lines, or loxodromes (lines that radiate from the center in the direction of wind or compass points), which sailors lined up with their compass readings to steer a straight course. (The nautical compass had long been one of the most useful technologies for navigators.)\n\nAs exploration continued in the 1600s, so did mapmaking. Dutch cartographer Hendrik Hondius’s Nova Totius Terrarum Orbis Geographica ac Hydrographica Tabula (1630) was a revision of one of Gerardus Mercator’s maps of the world. Hondius included lands that were newly known to Europeans, such as the northern coast of Australia. In what is now the U.S. Southwest and northern Mexico, Jesuit missionary Eusebio Kino made some of the first European maps of the New World, covering thousands of miles of territory. The Spanish and Portuguese empires guarded their maps as military secrets, however, so the French, British, and other powers continued to make basic cartographic errors: by the 1800s, for example, many British maps still showed California as an island.\n\nAustralian and Early Pacific Maps\n\nAustralia was settled about 50,000 years ago, but Polynesia not until the last few thousand years. Mixing real landscapes and creation myths, Aboriginal maps helped detail the relationship between people and Earth and thus maintain links across a continent. Rudimentary sand and stone maps used circles to depict camps, water holes, and other sites. Polynesians and Micronesians crossed thousands of miles of ocean in dugout canoes guided by charts made from palm leaves, seashells, or other durable materials, which were far more suited to water and rain than modern-day paper maps and computers. Few Europeans understood this traditional form of mapping, but at the request of British explorer Captain James Cook in the late 1700s, a Polynesian sailor of Tahiti drew a map representing 3,000 miles of ocean.\n\nMaps in the 18th and 19th Centuries\n\nLongitude was not new to maps in the 1700s, but it could not be calculated accurately at sea. Sailors tried to estimate longitude with dead reckoning (by trailing a knotted rope after the ship to calculate speed and distance), but errors in this rough method often led to shipwrecks. In 1759 English inventor John Harrison’s sea clock, or chronometer, solved the problem. Because Earth turns 15 degrees (of longitude) every hour, longitude can be calculated by subtracting the time at a person’s new location from the time at a person’s home port. (In contrast, latitude requires only sky observations.) Although English physicist and mathematician Isaac Newton and other scientific leaders initially scoffed at Harrison’s new technology, the chronometer revolutionized maritime navigation by allowing accurate timekeeping over long voyages.\n\nNutrition also quickened the pace of global exploration and with it more accurate mapmaking. While forcing his crew to expand their diets (vitamin intake), Captain Cook boldly traveled across previously uncharted parts of the Pacific Ocean. Shortly afterward, in 1795, the British Admiralty fought scurvy by providing citrus to its sailors.\n\nSouth America entered a new mapping era when German explorer Alexander von Humboldt scientifically surveyed the climate zones and vegetation of the Andes Mountains. Land-based surveying advanced through the Americas as settlers spread onto (or fought for) Indigenous lands. Following the Hudson River steamship experiments of American inventor and engineer Robert Fulton in 1807, the need arose for more accurate maps with the spread of steamships, telegraph lines, and railroads. In British-controlled India, surveyors worked for 50 years to triangulate from India’s coasts inland—all the way to Mount Everest; their final calculation of its height was remarkably accurate, as shown by 21st-century GPS measurements at the peak.\n\nThe adventurers, merchants, and missionaries of the late 1800s sought to conquer the unknown regions shown on imperial maps. Navigation remained difficult because countries tended to base the prime meridian on their own capital cities. In 1871, however, an international assembly voted to use the Greenwich prime meridian, since Britain was then the world’s leading naval power. By 1884 this prime meridian became a global standard, and that same year Canadian engineer Sandford Fleming proposed a system of time zones with the 360-degree world divided into 24 zones of 15 degrees (longitude) each.\n\nMapmaking requires knowledge about the world and techniques for gathering, analyzing, and displaying information. Access to these processes has accelerated with more rapid ships, trains, and automobiles. In the early 20th century, zeppelins and airplanes boosted the accuracy of maps with the previously unexpected details of aerial photography.\n\nRise of Computer Mapping\n\nIn the 1960s, as computing was in its infancy, mapmakers began to develop databases and mapping software. Initially, programming was slow and cumbersome, requiring large stacks of punch cards, and that era’s room-sized computers were even more unwieldy. Supercomputers and mainframe systems became faster and a bit smaller in the 1970s.\n\nIn the 1980s, personal computers accelerated map work, but few computers produced large, high-resolution images cheaply or easily, so maps continued to be handmade and then reprinted or photocopied for most publications, including atlases and encyclopedias. Even the maps featured in video games left much to be desired. Most were heavily pixilated, and some were simple outlines (aids for in-game navigation) only, although some turn-based military strategy games were built around increasingly interactive maps. In the 1990s, advances in graphics, memory, and computing speeds brought fictitious maps to the forefront, particularly in fantasy and strategy games.\n\nThe 1990s saw rapid advances in computer programming and the distribution of maps on CDs and, increasingly, the Internet. Data from previously independent sources (such as air-quality surveys, traffic data, and residential maps) were compiled into geographic information systems (GIS), which allowed geographers to discover new connections while creating dynamic, innovative maps. Web-based mapping developed rapidly from its 1990s origins, when even publishers and government agencies had struggled to produce attractive, useful maps that could be downloaded or viewed without major delays. Multimedia, including video and animations, became common features on web-based maps, as applications for the compiling, analysis, and publishing of maps spread. Although people would always find reasons to sketch quick maps for driving or hiking directions, the dominion of handmade maps was ending.\n\n21st-Century Mapmaking\n\nIn the 2000s, Web-based maps matched—and often surpassed—the CDs and DVDs from a few years previous. Interactive maps became vital parts of educational, commercial, and nonprofit websites, censuses, and other official reports. Maps for entertainment in video games often led the way in terms of interactivity and complexity. Meanwhile, high-resolution satellite images became available and affordable.\n\nInternet mashups (maps of mixed data formats, projections, and styles) provided by Google Maps and MapQuest used these technological advances to offer options for showing either a road map, a satellite view, or a combined view. Mashup satellite views can be helpful, but sometimes their high level of detail is confusing. In order to market these as interactive road, tourist, and consumer maps, mashups must work to update their base maps frequently with cars specifically outfitted to carry digital cameras and GPS units.\n\nThe Internet has grown radically since the 1990s, and it changes daily. Researchers at the Opte Project have attempted to map every network on the Internet on any given day. But even these images are of little use without an accurate definition of what exactly is being mapped. Other questions needing to be answered about the project include whether streaming videos of cartoons and movies (which require high bandwidth) should be measured alongside flows of important scientific data (which may need only low bandwidth). Whatever the technology or medium, all maps distort and conceal.\n\nCreative, Mythological, and Imaginary Maps\n\nMaps are pragmatic tools that can have spiritual, emotional, and sometimes magical meaning. Scholars warn that people imbue maps with undue mythological power when they naively trust in them, forgetting biases and limitations. Even when people hold a healthy distrust for maps, they look to them as they seek new pathways to knowledge, imagination, and cosmic truths and meaning in the universe. After all, people are preoccupied with knowing where they are, imagining where they would like to be, and feeling a sense of control over where they might imagine being.\n\nCognitive or Mental Maps\n\nCognitive maps, also called mental maps, are sometimes narrowly defined as the ways people remember, imagine, and sort their surroundings so they can move around. These internal maps are selective and partial: landmarks or directions significant to one person may be meaningless to another. In a narrow sense, mental maps are vital for people and for animals with navigational skills far superior to humans. However, the mental maps of humans work differently from those of other animals. People think abstractly in a culturally complex, highly symbolic world, so their mental maps must be more than aids to movement and boundary-marking.\n\nPeople move rapidly, physically and mentally traveling through their surroundings with cars, planes, and virtual (electronic) flows of ideas, images, and possibilities. Global citizens need mental maps capable of handling this flux. But not everyone can or will be comfortable in such an environment. For some, modernity feels too chaotic, as if the world were directionless. Their mental maps are unsuccessful amid a flood of new connections and abstractions, so they shrink from the world, joining a cult or isolated community or becoming a shut-in. Some react violently by joining militaristic groups seeking to remove ethnic, religious, or racial minorities from their countries or neighborhoods.\n\nThe social sciences reinforce and broaden people’s cognitive maps, helping them find a place in a multinational, multiethnic, and partly virtual world. This mental work involves complicated questions addressing issues such as how the world can be shared and why modern times might feel threatening. People might even ask where a moral compass is supposed to lead them.\n\nWhen students are asked to sketch aspects of their mental maps, unaided, they may show their own state or country in detail, followed by inaccurate outlines farther away from home. Building on this tendency toward distortion, satirists make quasi-cognitive map cartoons of stereotypes and attitudes, such as Ernest Dudley Chase’s “The United States as Viewed by California (Very Unofficial)”; his map has other states obscured by clouds, ice, and cobwebs. Some pseudo-mental maps satirize social institutions; for example, one version of the Map of Matrimony includes such waypoints as the Isle of Hope, Gulf of Flirtation, Paymoney Point, and Land of Tattlers.\n\nImaginary Entities\n\nEarly exploration increased map accuracy while fueling imaginations. Columbus’s mental map embraced a fantasy of sailing to the edge of Earthly Paradise. Conquistadors after him risked death for gold, glory, and the Fountain of Youth. After seeing exotic, monstrous-seeming animals—such as hippopotamuses, elephants, scorpions, whales, and walrus—explorers’ embellished tales led to the sketching of monsters in the empty parts of maps. Meanwhile, other map monsters had no basis in reality. Cartographers in ancient times spread stories of antipodes (reversed-feet people in the Southern Hemisphere) and giant, gold-mining ants in Asia. The Borgia Map (of about 1430) told of “huge men having horns four feet long” and serpents “of such magnitude that they can eat an ox whole.” Columbus sought treasure while dreading “one-eyed men, and others, with snouts of dogs, who ate men.”\n\nThe famous warning “Here Be Dragons” (or “Here Are Dragons”) appeared only once—in Latin as HC SVNT DRACONES (that is, hic sunt dracones)—on the small copper Lenox Globe (about 1503–07). It may have stemmed from Chinese myths or from Indonesia’s komodo dragons. Imaginative sightings and drawings of such creatures remained prevalent for centuries.\n\nPerhaps people draw monsters and animals on maps because imagination thrives at the bounds of the known universe. As fairy tales, myths, and myriad superstitions attest, people associate real and mystical threats with the literal edges of the forests, oceans, continents, and spaces they know. Most cultures have regarded transitional, or barely perceptible, spaces (and the people linked to them) as dangerous: hence the propensity for magically armoring travelers in these zones with blessings, charms, or magic-tinged rites of passage. Maps reveal desires for knowledge and safety as well as fears of the unknown.\n\nIn addition to dangerous or fantastic entities, entire islands and continents have been imagined onto maps. Long before explorers ever caught a glimpse of Antarctica, versions of it were drawn on globes and maps as the Terra Incognita Australis (“Unknown Southern Land”), supposedly covering huge parts of the southern Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific oceans—where only water lay. Philosophers also believed that the North Pole was a tall mountain encircled by warm waters—and costly, colorful maps reinforced that fantasy long before explorers had the chance to disprove it. California appeared as an island after its coasts should have been known. Maps in the 1700s and 1800s have had nonexistent rivers and lakes in Arabia, South America, and Africa. In the 21st century, long after the Aral Sea shrank drastically, many maps and globes displayed its original shape and size.\n\nMaps for Literature and Fantastic Realms\n\nSince maps have traditionally been populated with fantastic places and creatures, it seems only fitting that maps be created to accompany works of fiction, especially in the fantasy genre. In fact, many people have found a love for cartography through fictitious maps. Modern fantasy writers, television shows, and films certainly utilize maps—for visual effects (the yellowed parchment of a pirate’s map or the flashing of a tracking device on a computer map) and for navigational aids (to keep the viewer or reader from getting lost as characters move around rapidly)—but maps have deeply historical literary connections.\n\nLiterature reflects this conceptual power even when maps are lacking. English dramatist William Shakespeare’s character Hamlet muses about death as an uncharted, unknown land: “the undiscovered country from whose bourn no traveler returns.” The Egyptian Book of the Dead is a religious text providing no map but instructions purporting to ease a person’s entrance to the afterlife.\n\nPublishers of the Bible have customarily inserted maps of the Holy Land as teaching aids, as have the printers of epic tales and histories. Nineteenth-century artists jumped at the chance to illustrate the circles of hell that Italian author Dante invented while writing The Divine Comedy (circa 1308–21). In German literature, maps once accompanied legends of the utopia called Schlaraffenlande. Irish author Jonathan Swift’s satirical adventure book Gulliver’s Travels (1726) was printed with maps. Scottish author Robert Louis Stevenson detailed a map before writing Treasure Island (1881); in the early 20th century, American novelist Edgar Rice Burroughs rendered sketches of Mars (Barsoom), the South Pacific, and Africa (as he saw them). In the 1940s, maps decorated American science-fiction writer Edmond Hamilton’s Captain Future stories set on (and within) other planets and on the Moon. Maps were also central to French author Jules Verne’s novel The Mysterious Island (1870) and to reprints of American pulp-fiction author Robert E. Howard’s Conan the Cimmerian stories, which were published in the 1930s.\n\nEnglish writer J.R.R. Tolkien created maps of Middle-earth for readers of The Hobbit (1937) and The Lord of the Rings trilogy (1954–55). Hundreds of fantasy writers since then have used maps, including the American authors Terry Brooks, Robert Jordan, and Christopher Paolini. Young children may be familiar with the map of Hundred Acre Wood from the early-19th-century Winnie-the-Pooh books or with Dora’s friend Map in the 21st-century Dora the Explorer animated television series. The magical Marauder’s Map in J.K. Rowling’s Harry Potter series (1997–2007) traces footsteps in the Hogwarts halls. Meanwhile, in darkened galleries, on tabletops, and on computer screens around the world, maps bring fantasy role-playing games to life as ephemeral stories fleshed out among friends.\n\nTelevision viewers in the early 21st century have been treated to map displays born of literary fantasy and digital gaming. During the opening credits to the fantasy series Game of Thrones, which began in 2011, the camera zooms over a map of this fantastic world. As the camera pauses over a major town or castle, gears turn as walls, high towers, and royal standards emerge to make the once flat map three-dimensional—as if crafted by arcane game play, magic, or ingenious clockwork.\n\nStephen P.
