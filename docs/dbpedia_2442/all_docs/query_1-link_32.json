Victor Eugene, the 17-year-old son of Mr. and Mrs. Clasby, who lived at 1622 Highland Street, left the Kingsport Navy Recruiting Office in late October to begin his training as a bluejacket. The elder Clasby who passed his Navy physical with flying colors despite his 43 years, left November 23 to begin his second naval career. He served as a seaman first class, on the U.S.S. Matsona during the first World War. He also did duty on a sub-chaser for five months. Since 1930 Mr. Clasby has been employed as a coppersmith at the Tennessee Eastman Corporation. He is a member of the Hammond Post of the American Legion and was a top sergeant in the third machine gun and chemical company of the State Guard. Young Clasby was a sophomore at Dobyns-Bennett High School at the time of his enlistment. A seaman second class, he will complete his boot training at the San Diego Naval Base soon.\n\nKingsport News 10 March 1945:\n\nVictor Clasby dies in action; dad in Navy hospital —\n\nVictor Clasby, S 1/c, died of wounds received in action at sea, according to information received by his mother, Mrs. A.O.

Both father and son served in landing craft units.\n\nThe Kingsport Times News 22 April 1945:\n\nDetails of the accident which caused the death of Victor Eugene Clasby, S 1/c, USNR, have been received by his parents, Alpha O.

Young Clasby, whom the officer commended highly for his ability and qualities of leadership, received fatal injuries when his landing craft was being lowered from repair deck to the sea. He was crushed when a huge wave picked up the craft, dropped from under it and sent it crashing against the repair ship, the captain wrote.
