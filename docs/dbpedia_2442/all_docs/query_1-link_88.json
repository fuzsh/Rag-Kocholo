        "text": "Part of the front of the Boone County Museum recently fell off.\n\nTook a few pictures just to document what could have been a tragedy.\n\nI recently attend a funeral of a church friend. One of the people that spoke about him at the funeral said that on the day of their wedding he had drove around town to document what the town looked like on their wedding day. In the future they would be able to look back at what their world was like and how it changed. I think this is an excellent idea.\n\nEMOTIONS was a profoundly unpopular theme. I’m sure destined to hit the cutting room floor if this challenge extends into a second year. Maybe it was the holiday weekend. Maybe people were like feelings? Actually feeling something? No thanks! Back to my mass consumerism, thank you very much*. Either way, Angie was the only person that kept this theme from being a shutout and being the first strike against this challenge.\n\nHere are the submissions for EMOTIONS:\n\nChristopher D. Bennett\n\nAngie DeWaard\n\nBecky Perkovich\n\nBut enough dwelling on the past. Time to look to the future. We are all interested in the future, for that is where you and I are going to spend the rest of our lives. And remember my friend, future events such as these will affect you in the future.\n\nThis week’s theme is…\n\nPERSPECTIVE\n\nBack when I was compiling the list of 52 themes, I thought about breaking PERSPECTIVE into LOW PERSPECTIVE and HIGH PERSPECTIVE, but I thought it would be interesting, given the choice where people would go. The level of a rat or the level of an eagle. Both animals forage through trash for food, but their perspective on the world is totally different.\n\nHowever, being high or low isn’t the only definition of perspective. As always, feel free to define perspective any way that you want.\n\nHOUSEKEEPING\n\nRULES\n\n1. The picture has to be taken the week of the theme. This isn’t a curate your pictures challenge. This is a get your butt off the couch (my personal experience) and put your camera in your hands challenge. Don’t send me a picture of you next to the Eiffel Tower, when I know you were in Iowa all week. I will point out that I have let that slide some in the past. I will not in the future. Since it is literally about the only rule.\n\n2. Your submission needs to be emailed to bennett@photography139.com by noon on the Monday of the challenge. It should be pointed out that this blog auto-publishes at 12:01 on Mondays. So it wouldn’t hurt to get your picture in earlier.\n\nThat is it, them’s the rules.\n\nThat’s all I got, so if the good Lord’s willin’ and the creek don’t rise, we will commune again next Monday. Hopefully with a lot of new perspectives on the world.\n\n*Just wanted to make sure everybody knows that I’m a minimalist and that I’m super excited about the new movie coming out about my people.\n\nTHE CHRISTOPHER D. BENNETT TRIVIA QUIZ\n\nQUESTION 7\n\nQuentin Tarantino famously was once quoted as saying: “When I’m getting serious about a girl I show her RIO BRAVO and she better (expletive deleted) like it.” What one of my 3 favorite movies do I use as a test of the quality of the people in my life? They better (expletive deleted) like it!\n\nANSWER: A CLOCKWORK ORANGE\n\nBONUS\n\nWhat are my other 2 favorite movies? To earn the point, you must include the year of release.\n\nKING KONG (1933) & PSYCHO (1960)\n\nI actually have been pretty lax about photographing flowers this year. That is partially because the 2017 Photography 139 Calendar will go in a new direction. Partially because I haven’t even planted flowers in my yard this year. Partially because my daffodils didn’t bloom this year. Partially because I missed my window of opportunity to go to Pella this year to photograph tulips. Regardless, my daisies were the first of my flowers to bloom this year.\n\nSo I dedicate the first flower picture of 2016 to Russell, because he hates my flower photography. He will be in mourning since flowers will start to become a bigger part of this here blog in the coming months. Probably. Sorry Russell, that is how the cookie crumbles.\n\nPARTICULARS\n\nCAMERA: SONY SLT-A65V\n\nISO: 125\n\nFOCAL LENGTH: 60mm\n\nAPERTURE: f/20\n\nEXPOSURE: 1/100\n\nDATE: 05/22/2016 – 13:18\n\nLATITUDE: 42.05511°\n\nLONGITUDE: -93.87082°\n\nPHOTO ASSISTANT: None\n\nTHE CHRISTOPHER D. BENNETT TRIVIA QUIZ ANSWER SHEET\n\nQUESTION 5\n\nWhen Olivia and I got married, who were my 5 groomsmen?\n\nANSWER: Jesse Howard, Anders Runestad, Jay Janson, William McAlpine, and Eric Hiatt\n\nBONUS\n\nI’ve been a groomsman or bridesman 7 times. Name the 7 grooms/brides I’ve served:\n\nANSWER: Jesse Howard, Jay Janson, Anders Runestad, Scott Degeneffe, Derrick Gorshe, Sara Lockner, and Nate Miller\n\nIt looks like LETTERS AND/OR NUMBERS also wasn’t an extremely popular theme. Might have to put it on the chopping block if this little project continues into a second year. I guess we’ll see.\n\nOn the positive though, it was extremely popular with first time submitter Sara Lockner. Hopefully this won’t be the last time a theme rings the creative bell for Sara.\n\nThis week’s submissions:\n\nKim Barker 1\n\nKim Barker 2\n\nSara Lockner 1\n\nSara Lockner 2\n\nSara Lockner 3\n\nSara Lockner 4\n\nAngie DeWaard\n\nChristopher D. Bennett\n\nBecky Perkovich\n\nBut enough dwelling on the past. Time to look to the future. We are all interested in the future, for that is where you and I are going to spend the rest of our lives. And remember my friend, future events such as these will affect you in the future.\n\nThis week’s theme is…\n\nEMOTIONS!\n\nBut what are EMOTIONS! Google defines EMOTION as a natural instinctive state of mind deriving from one’s circumstances, mood, or relationship with others. So capture somebody displaying an emotion. Even a second hand emotion like love. Or capture a scene that is the result of a emotion. Capture an image that is supposed to incite an emotion. (Although, quite frankly I hope that is what you’re trying to do with every image.) Or as always, define the theme any way that you want.\n\nHOUSEKEEPING\n\nRULES\n\n1. The picture has to be taken the week of the theme. This isn’t a curate your pictures challenge. This is a get your butt off the couch (my personal experience) and put your camera in your hands challenge. Don’t send me a picture of you next to the Eiffel Tower, when I know you were in Iowa all week. I will point out that I have let that slide some in the past. I will not in the future.

It should be pointed out that this blog auto-publishes at 12:01 on Mondays. So it wouldn’t hurt to get your picture in earlier.\n\nThat is it, them’s the rules.\n\nA MESSAGE FROM THE PHOTOGRAPHY 139 REMINDER DIVISION\n\nA reminder that you can check out all the submission thus far by visiting the WEEKLY PHOTO CHALLENGE TAKE 3 Gallery on this here website. Click the below:\n\nWEEKLY PHOTO CHALLENGE TAKE 3 GALLERY\n\nA MESSAGE FROM THE PHOTOGRAPHY 139 SHAMELESS SELF-PROMOTION DIVISION\n\nI’m pleased to announce that the Persons are the latest people to show their taste, class, and sophistication by grabbing a Photography 139 email subscription. The short scoop on them is that they are the most talented photographers I know and have been family friends for as long as I have memories. If you see them out and about walking the mean streets of Boone, give them a knowing glance and show them the Super Secret Photography 139 handshake.\n\nThat is all I got, so if the good Lord’s willin’ and the creeks don’t rise, we will commune again next Monday. Hopefully with a plethora of EMOTIONS pictures!"
