        "text": "Howard County Geodetic Network\n\nDescription\n\nCurrently the network consist of 745 stations divided in two sub-networks: A\n\nHorizontal Geodetic Network , contains 453 stations and provides both horizontal and vertical information, and a Vertical Network with 292 stations and provides only vertical information .\n\nThe Horizontal Network maintains the horizontal coordinates (Northing, Easing,\n\nLatitude, Longitude, Scale Factors , value of the Convergence of Meridians and Ellipsoidal Height) in Maryland State coordinates in both NAD27 and NAD83 Datums, the elevations also are provided in reference to NAVD88 and NGVD29.\n\nThe Vertical Network (Benchmarks) maintains only the vertical information (elevations) of its stations in both vertical datums.\n\nPhysically each station is usually a brass or aluminum disc , stamped with the Howard County Survey Division, the name of the station and a stamped cross or other mark to indicate the exact geometric point represented by the station. These disks are embedded atop of a three feet deep column of concrete, buried in the ground so the disk ends up about one inch below the ground surface. Some stations set by other institutions, but incorporated to our system may be slightly different, but in order to be included they must have minimum characteristics of stability and durability.\n\nThe Coordinate information is obtained after a combination of G.P.S. and traditional survey observations (Digital leveling) and rigorous office computations and adjustments based in the standards and guidelines for Geodetic Control Networks provided buy the National Geodetic Survey (NGS).\n\nThe accuracy of the Howard County Network is:\n\nUncertainty in the Horizontal positions : about 1cm (First Class)\n\nUncertainty in the Elevations : about 2.5cm (2nd Class)\n\nThere is no difference in the vertical accuracies of the elevations provided by either sub-network.\n\nAll the information is kept in a CPU in an ACCESS database maintained by The Howard County Survey Division.\n\nGENESIS:\n\nHoward County started its first geodetic network in 1971 by subcontracting the build up to a local Engineering company: Greenhorne and Ohmara . The job was performed by areas (phases) and took about five years and finished with a little more than one thousand station. The information about these stations is kept in the office of the Survey Division, but the network is not maintained anymore. Currently more than half of these stations have been destroyed or paved over.\n\nBy 1989, as the state of Maryland would change its official system of coordinates in 1992 from NAD27 to NAD83 datums, the County was facing the dilemma of performing a great number of new observation and a gigantic transformation of coordinates in order to adapt the old network to the new system, or using the new GPS techniques and profiting of the availability of the at the time new national High Accuracy Reference Network (HARN),\n\nstart from scratch and build a new network already in the new NAD83 coordinates.\n\nBetween 1990 and mid 1992 the County selected 42 stations well distributed over the area of the County, and with them created an initial network using pure GPS observation.\n\nThis network was reported to NGS for inclusion in the National Survey Reference System (bluebooking). The network was accepted by NGS and all the stations were included in the national database with a First Class classification.\n\nUsing that initial network as frame, the County has continued building up by continuously replacing lost stations and setting new ones. In the mid nineties the system was improved by combining it with a network of digital levels covering the whole area. In the year 2000 the frame of bluebooked stations was renovated and expanded by re-observing the original stations with a batch of new ones to a total of sixty one bluebooked stations at the present times.\n\nThe whole network is continually readjusted in order to incorporate ne stations and observation.\n\nHow to Obtain information\n\nThe information about each station is published in a sheet (recovery card) which displays all\n\nthe previously mentioned information plus a rough sketch of the location of the station and indications how to find it.\n\nThese cards can be obtained at the office of the Howard County Survey Division at::\n\n9250 Bendix Road\n\nColumbia , Md 21045\n\nBy phone to : Division Chief : Keff Hobbs (410)-313-6120\n\nGeomatic Engineer: Ralph Mercado (410)-313-6103\n\nDivision Secretary : Arline Bennett (410)-313-6119\n\nBy fax: (410)-313-6106\n\ne-mail: rmercado@co.ho.md.us"
