        "text": "Follow these steps during the scoping phase of your project:\n\nNotify the Corps about emergency projects\n\nNotify Ecology about emergency projects\n\nConduct a reconnaissance survey for wetlands & other waters\n\nDetermine who has jurisdiction & permitting needs\n\nBundle fish passage projects\n\nResearch compensatory mitigation options\n\nCoordinate with liaisons\n\nNotify the Corps about emergency projects\n\nFollow these instructions for declared emergency projects that involve work in waters under U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) jurisdiction.\n\nThe Corps defines emergencies in 33 CFR 325.2(e)(4) as, \" a situation which would result in an unacceptable hazard to life, a significant loss of property or an immediate, unforeseen, and significant economic hardship if corrective action requiring a permit is not undertaken within a time period less than the normal time needed to process the application under standard procedures.\"\n\nCheck with the Multi-Agency Permit Program manager if you think the work may be exempt from Section 404 permit requirements.\n\nIf the work can be covered under a non-reporting Nationwide Permit (i.e. a Pre-Construction Notification/Joint Aquatic Resource Permit Application isn't needed), you don't need to notify the Corps of the project. A project may be non-reporting if there is no effect for Endangered Species Act/Essential Fish Habitat, and 106. Document it for your records.\n\nCall a Corps project manager:\n\nSandra Manning, (360) 869-1488, sandra.l.manning@usace.army.mil\n\nSamantha Stanford (206) 561-6743, samantha.m.stanford@usace.army.mil\n\nIf there is no answer, leave a message and follow up with an email to ESOPermittingLiaisons@wsdot.wa.gov\n\nIf neither project manager answers the phone and work must start immediately, call a Corps Chief:\n\nMatt Bennett- Corps Seattle District Section Chief, During business hours - (206) 446-8067\n\nTodd Tillinger- Corps Seattle District Regulatory Branch Chief, After hours - (206) 798-4886\n\nEmail the Notice of Need for Emergency Work form found on the Corps Emergencies and Emergency Permitting Procedures webpage within 24 hours of calling the Corps to provide the necessary details.\n\nAttach to the email:\n\nWSDOT's Emergency Declaration, if applicable\n\nPhotos depicting the emergency if the Corps project manager hasn't received them previously\n\nDrawings of the proposed repair\n\nIn response, the Corps project managers will:\n\nReview the notification information.\n\nSend the Services, tribes, and state agencies a request for recommendations to minimize effects from emergency response. This is separate from the notification requirements for WSDOT to the Services and coordination with tribes/state agencies. It is part of the Corps' obligations as a federal agency.\n\nInitiate emergency authorization request to proceed if it meets the Corps definition of an emergency, has been minimized to reduce impact to waters, and meets the conditions of the emergency authorization.\n\nNotify WSDOT via email once authorization is approved.\n\nIf we cannot wait for formal approval from the Corps prior to conducting necessary work, we can minimize legal risks by following this process and striving to keep work to the \"minimum necessary to reduce the threat of the emergency situation\". Report to Region Environmental staff as soon as possible.\n\nMinimize removal and fill because what you do in an emergency may have to be re-done or undone after the fact. Continue to coordinate while work is occurring. Work that is done prior to authorization may be tracked as an unauthorized activity within the Corps.\n\nIf the Corps authorization requires consultation with National Marine Fisheries service or U.S. Fish and Wildlife service, please cc: the Corps on your emails to the Services.\n\nNotify Ecology about emergency projects\n\nFollow these instructions for declared emergency projects that involve work in waters under Washington State Department of Ecology (Ecology) jurisdiction.\n\nFollow the procedure for Section 404 (Corps) compliance for emergency projects above. For compliance with Section 401, in addition to the above, submit a Pre-Filling Meeting Request form found on Ecology's Publications and Forms webpage to the Department of Ecology Federal Permits Inbox at ecyrefedpermits@ecy.wa.gov.\n\nThis will start the regulatory clock if your project needs 401 coverage. For both section 404 and section 401 requests, please copy the Ecology Liaison: Penny Kelley at Penny.Kelley@ecy.wa.gov.\n\nConduct a reconnaissance survey for wetlands & other waters\n\nConduct a reconnaissance survey to identify potential wetlands and other waters in the project vicinity. Get the following information from the Project Engineering Office:\n\nProject description, purpose, and location\n\nProject plan sheets showing all areas that may be impacted or proposed project alternatives, and existing features such as roadway and right of way\n\nWritten right of entry for access to non-Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) property if within the project area\n\nReview background information for the area on our internal GIS Workbench (or other data sources if you don’t have WSDOT credentials) before doing field work:\n\nUS Fish and Wildlife National Wetland Inventory website\n\nLocal wetland and hydrograph inventories\n\nThe Washington Natural Heritage Program (WNHP) Data Explorer website\n\nNatural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) Web Soil Survey and NRCS Official Soil Series Descriptions webpages\n\nTopographic maps\n\nSatellite imagery, infrared, and true-color aerial photographs\n\nPrior wetland reports or wetland information for the area - See Ecology's Statewide wetland mapping inventory project webpage\n\nWSDOT environmental mitigation site locations\n\nFor small or simple projects, review of background information may provide enough information for reconnaissance without a field visit.\n\nMake a brief, informal field visit to qualitatively identify potential wetlands and other waters. Create a sketch map to document estimated location of waters. Follow our Sensitive areas naming conventions (PDF 126KB) to label wetlands and other waters on the sketches. If needed, estimate wetland categories by following Ecology’s Wetland Rating Systems webpage.\n\nPrepare an email or memo to summarize your findings. “Right-size” the documentation to fit the needs of your project. For more complicated projects, the memo may include:\n\nProject description, purpose, location – including local jurisdiction.\n\nMap of the study area/area of potential affect\n\nMethods\n\nApproximate wetland boundary and acreage\n\nApproximate stream locations\n\nEstimated locations of other waters\n\nMap or plan sheet showing all identified waters and estimated area\n\nEstimated wetland category\n\nStream water type using DNR’s Forest Practices Application Mapping Tool website\n\nEstimated buffers required by the local jurisdiction - See the Municipal Research and Services Center website to look up city or county codes.\n\nShare the information with the project team.\n\nDetermine who has jurisdiction & permitting needs\n\nUse the data you collected in the wetland reconnaissance survey to determine if the waters are federally or state regulated to inform future documentation and permit needs.\n\nFederally regulated waters\n\nThe US Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) - The Corps has jurisdiction of Waters of the US (WOTUS) (Section 404 of the Clean Water Act) and Navigable waters (Section 10 of the Rivers & Harbors Act). The Corps also manages some projects, like dikes and levees, next to streams. Use the following tools to determine if the Corps has jurisdiction over your project:\n\nCorps' Jurisdiction website - to determine if the wetlands and other waters in the project area are a Section 404 WOTUS.\n\nCorps' lists of Navigable Waters in Washington State on the Streams, Rivers, and Tidal Waters page of the Corps Permit Guidebook – to see if a stream is a Section 10 navigable water according to the Corps.\n\nCorps’ Section 408 website – to determine if there is a Corps project in the project area and to apply for a Section 408 permission.\n\nFor Section 404 or 10 waters, use the Corps' 2021 NWP Summary Chart (PDF 518KB) to determine if the work can be verified under a Nationwide Permit (NWP). Most WSDOT projects fit under NWPs:\n\n3 – Maintenance (PDF 1.0MB)\n\n6 – Survey Activities (PDF 1.1MB)\n\n13 - Bank Stabilization (PDF 1.1MB) -bank stabilization projects that occur within the Salish Sea may require additional review by the Corps. Contact the Corps liaisons early to determine review needs.\n\n14 - Linear Transportation Projects (PDF 1.0MB)\n\n18 – Minor Discharges (PDF 1.1MB)\n\n23 - Approved Categorical Exclusions (PDF 1.1MB) - if the CE you are using is not listed in RGL 05-07 (PDF 146KB), contact the Corps liaisons to determine if the work can be covered under this NWP.\n\n27 - Aquatic Habitat Restoration, Establishment, and Enhancement Activities (PDF 1.1MB) – for new compensatory mitigation sites.\n\n33 – Temporary Construction, Access, and Dewatering (PDF 1.1MB)\n\nConsult the Corps Seattle District User Guide for the terms and conditions for each NWP above to make sure that the work:\n\nFits the approved activities for the NWP.\n\nMeets all the National General Conditions.\n\nMeets all the Regional Conditions.\n\nIf the work cannot be permitted under a NWP, you will need to apply for an Individual Permit from the Corps during final design. Prepare a Section 404(b)(1) analysis during preliminary design as part of the permit application. Use the 404(b)(1) template (DOCX 56KB).\n\nUse the Stormwater & water quality webpage to determine the Section 401 Water Quality Certification needs.\n\nUS Coast Guard (USCG) – Get a Navigability Determination from the USCG for work on transportation structures (culvert, buried structure, bridge, approaches, or abutments) over water:\n\nFor bridge work - look up the bridge in our internal Bridge Engineering Information System (BEISt). If you do not see a navigability determination from the USCG in the structure details, contact Glenn Waldron, Glenn.Waldron@wsdot.wa.gov, Bridge Office.\n\nFor culvert work - look up the culvert in our internal Fish Passage Site Management System. If you do not see a navigability determination from the USCG in the attachments for your site, contact the Multi-Agency Permit Program (MAPP) Coordinator in the Environmental Services Office at MAPP@wsdot.wa.gov .\n\nKeep a copy of the navigability determination letter from the USCG with your other work records. Note the date of the letter in your environmental document. Contact Glenn Waldron, Glenn.Waldron@wsdot.wa.gov, for next steps if the letter indicates that the waterbody is navigable and that a permit or additional coordination is needed. If you need a bridge permit, use the Stormwater & water quality webpage to determine the Section 401 Water Quality Certification needs.\n\nState regulated waters\n\nIf the water is not federally regulated by the Corps under Section 404 or Section 10, Ecology has jurisdiction as a water of the state. If you are not sure if Ecology would regulate the wetland or other water, contact the MAPP at MAPP@wsdot.wa.gov.\n\nIf your project will work in non-federally regulated waters, you will need to apply for an Administrative Order (AO) from Ecology during final design. To apply for an AO, contact the MAPP at MAPP@wsdot.wa.gov, after you complete your wetland delineation.\n\nCoastal zones\n\nIf the project is in one of the 15 coastal counties and requires one of the federal licenses or permits listed for Washington State on the National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration’s State Federal Consistency list website, you will need a Coastal Zone Management (CZM) Act Consistency Determination in final design.\n\nIf the work only needs a Section 404 Nationwide Permit, check the Regional Conditions for Seattle District (PDF 1.5MB) or the NWP terms and conditions to see if you need to apply for CZM review or if it’s programmatically covered.\n\nShorelines\n\nDetermine if your work is in an area that triggers a Shoreline Permit:\n\nWithin 200 feet of a shoreline of statewide significance – Check the local agency map of Shoreline areas or our internal GIS Workbench.\n\nListed under a local shoreline master plan or ordinance - Check the local agency plans and codes.\n\nIf your project qualifies for a Fish Habitat Enhancement (FHEP) Hydraulic Project Approval (HPA), do not apply for a shoreline permit or approval. If your fish passage project does not qualify for an FHEP HPA, you do not need a Shoreline Substantial Development Permit but you may need one of the other permits and approvals listed below. Use the Fish webpage to determine if your project qualifies for an FHEP HPA.\n\nThe optional shoreline process under RCW 90.58.355(3) allows WSDOT to perform certain maintenance, repair, safety, and replacement work without applying for a shoreline permit or approval. Check RCW 90.58.356 to determine if your project meets the criteria for this process. If the project does not require a permit and will cost more than $1 million to plan and design, send written notification of the project prior to construction to all:\n\nAgencies, federal and state, with jurisdiction in the area, including the Ecology Regional Planner.\n\nAgencies with facilities or services that may be impacted by the project, including utility companies, transit systems, and schools.\n\nAdjacent property owners within 300 feet of the shoreline jurisdiction area.\n\nIf there are many property owners or if the local agency’s permit process is complex, consider applying for a shoreline permit or approval instead.\n\nIf your project doesn’t meet the criteria for an optional shoreline process, apply for a shorelines permit or approval during final design. Check the local agency’s shoreline management program (SMP) and codes to determine which type of Shoreline Permit you may need:\n\nSubstantial Development Permit – work is consistent with the local agency’s shoreline master program (SMP).\n\nConditional Use Permit – proposed work is listed as a conditional use or is not addressed in the SMP. Ecology must review and approve all shoreline conditional use permits.\n\nVariance – Work doesn’t fit the development regulations in the SMP. Ecology must review and approve all variances.\n\nLetter of exemption – proposed work within shoreline jurisdiction that qualifies for exemptions under WAC 173-27-040 or the local Shoreline Master Program that does not fit under the optional shoreline process.\n\nBundle fish passage projects\n\nYou can bundle fish passage projects together for permit submittal if it increases efficiency for WSDOT. Bundling no longer speeds permit timelines once the application is submitted to the Corps. The Corps will assign a project number to each site in the bundle. Each site will be considered a separate project. Writing one application form (PCN) is more efficient if all the sites meet all the following criteria:\n\nThey are on the same creek, are tributaries on the same creek, or are nearby creeks feeding the same river.\n\nThey are the same WRIA and/or the same watershed.\n\nThey have similar site or construction conditions.\n\nThey meet stream simulation/bridge criteria design.\n\nThey are designed and ready for permitting application at the same time.\n\nThey are not politically sensitive, very complex or include an unusual or overly complex site or construction conditions.\n\nAlways submit an Ecology Pre-Filing Meeting Request form, found on Ecology's Publications and Forms webpage, 30 days before the bundle submission in case sites within the bundle require an individual Water Quality Certification (WQC). You will need to submit a separate WQC form for each site within the bundle that requires an individual WQC.\n\nIf you think your projects qualify for bundling, you must coordinate with the permitting liaisons at ESOPermittingLiaisons@wsdot.wa.gov during preliminary design.\n\nResearch compensatory mitigation options\n\nIf unavoidable impacts will occur, consider compensatory mitigation options in this order:\n\n1. WSDOT mitigation credits - Determine if the project is within the service area of a WSDOT-owned mitigation bank, advance compensatory mitigation site (compensation site), or a nearby concurrent compensation site with excess credit. Find our mitigation bank service areas on our internal GIS Workbench. Contact a headquarters or region specialist to determine if credits are available and appropriate for the potential project impacts.\n\n2. Third-party mitigation credits - Determine if the project is in a third-party mitigation bank or in-lieu fee service area. Refer to Ecology’s Wetland mitigation banking webpage for availability of third-party mitigation bank or in-lieu fee programs.\n\nContact the bank or in-lieu fee sponsor directly to determine available credits. See the bank or in-lieu fee sponsor website for details related to requirements for credit use. Wait until permits have been approved before you purchase credits.\n\n3. Create a new WSDOT compensatory mitigation site - Design an advance or concurrent compensatory mitigation site. See Ecology’s Wetland mitigation resources webpage for guidance on mitigation sequencing and site selection. See the 2012 Interagency Regulatory Guide: Advance Permittee-Responsible Mitigation on Ecology's webpage for how to develop an advance compensatory mitigation site. To construct a new compensatory mitigation site concurrently with the project, initiate your site selection process after you identify preliminary compensatory mitigation requirements in preliminary design.\n\nCoordinate with liaisons\n\nYou may coordinate with the Corps and Ecology Liaisons if you need help scoping the permitting needs. For example, to support Planning and Environmental Linkage studies, if you aren’t sure if the work fits a NWP, or there aren’t mitigation options in your project area and you intend to construct a new compensation site. Find instructions for how to coordinate with the liaisons on the preliminary design tab.\n\nFollow these steps during the preliminary design phase of your project:\n\nDocument wetlands\n\nDocument streams & tidal waters\n\nEvaluate ditches\n\nDocument buffers\n\nWrite the Wetland & Stream Assessment Report\n\nAssume all waters are jurisdictional\n\nDocument impacts\n\nPrepare a Section 404(b)(1) alternatives analysis\n\nWrite the Mitigation Plan\n\nRequest a pre-application coordination meeting\n\nCoordinate with the Multi-Agency Permitting Program team on design-build projects\n\nDocument wetlands\n\nIf you will hire a consultant to do the assessment, use the Generic Scope of Work for Delineation (DOCX 51KB) to build the wetland and stream delineation and assessment section in your consultant contract.\n\nReview the project information you collected from the reconnaissance survey during scoping.\n\nUse the Wetland and Stream Assessment Report (WSAR) tools, templates, & links to perform field work and prepare the report.\n\nCoordinate with your region’s survey crew following field work. Provide a sketch map of all identified waters. Coordinate with the Project Engineer Office to develop and finalize plan sheets showing all identified waters and their buffers. Follow our Sensitive areas naming conventions (PDF 562KB) when identifying wetlands and other waters on plans and figures.\n\nIf wetlands or other waters are present in the project, follow the Corp’s Components of a Complete Wetland Delineation Report (PDF 124KB). Use the tools on the Tools, templates & links tab to delineate, rate and perform a functions assessment for all potentially impacted wetlands in the project study area. This includes wetlands occurring both below and above the Ordinary High Water Mark (OHWM). See Q&A - Delineating wetlands on or near road prisms (PDF 233KB) for answers to frequently asked delineation questions.\n\nFor fish passage projects, document the functions and explain the ecological benefits of the project in the Section 404 permit application.\n\nFor most projects, use the Wetland Functions Characterization Tool for Linear Projects (PDF 96KB) (BPJ tool) to perform a function assessment of each wetland that will potentially be impacted. Use Wetland Functions Characterization Tool for Linear Projects ArcGIS Survey 123 Field Data Form Manual (PDF 243KB) to fill out the BPJ Tool field data form electronically using ArcGIS Survey 123.\n\nUse the Credit/Debit method described on the Ecology Credits & debits for wetland mitigation website for in-lieu fee mitigation proposals on projects with minimal wetlands. Applying the Credit/Debit method to projects with more than a few wetlands is challenging, so the BPJ tool is preferable for most WSDOT projects.\n\nFor fish passage projects, don't perform functions assessment unless project specific factors determine it is a benefit. Instead, provide a narrative in the permit application form to show how the fish passage project provides overall aquatic habitat benefit. Explain how there is no net loss of aquatic functions and area. Provide enough rationale to support the determination that the ecological benefits from the fish passage project outweighs the potential aquatic losses.\n\nDocument streams & tidal waters\n\nYou will need:\n\nEcology's Find your WRIA\n\nDNR Forest Practices Water Typing and Forest Practices Application Online Mapping Tool - To identify the DNR water type for streams and apply local stream buffers.\n\nWashington State Fish Passage - To find the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife Site Identification Number for fish passage projects.\n\nFish Passage Site Management Database (only accessible to WSDOT employees) - To identify fish species presence and habitat gain information for fish passage projects\n\nFor non-tidal streams and other waters, follow the Corps' methodology for OHWM delineation in non-tidal areas established in the Corps Regulatory Guidance Letter 05-05 (PDF 51.8KB). In addition, use the following region-specific resources:\n\nIf working in the Arid West Region, use Corps A Field Guide to the Identification of the Ordinary High Water Mark in the Arid West Region of the Western United States (PDF 34MB).\n\nIf working in the Mountains, Valleys, and Coast Region, use Corps A Guide to Ordinary High Water Mark Delineation for Non-Perennial Streams in the Western Mountains, Valleys, and Coast Region of the United States (PDF 3.3MB).\n\nFor tidal water, delineate the HTL as directed by the Seattle District of the Corps Special Public Notice dated February 21, 2020 (PDF 158KB). Tidal water includes tidally influenced freshwater or brackish systems like river mouths.\n\nReview the Corps Electronic Permit Guidebook - Streams, Rivers, and Tidal Waters and our HTL Delineation Methods and WSDOT recommendations presentation (PDF 8.73MB) for additional information.\n\nUse one of the following three methods to establish HTL:\n\nHighest astronomical tide.\n\nTen-year average of the highest predicted tide (HPT).\n\nField indicators of OHWM for tidal waters as described in Ecology's Determining the Ordinary High Water Mark for Shoreline Management Act Compliance in Washington State (PDF 19.9MB)\n\nUse the HTL calculator (XLSX 174KB) and Calculate Mean Highest Predicted Tide (PDF 583KB) help document to calculate mean HPT.\n\nInclude Mean High Water elevation on plan sheets with the HTL, to indicate the Corp's Section 10 limit of jurisdiction and Ecology's jurisdiction. WSDOT staff, coordinate with your Corps liaisons. External partners, coordinate with your WSDOT project contact prior to submitting your permit application for HTL delineations.\n\nEvaluate ditches\n\nChoose one to several, safe to access, representative ditch sections depending on the size of the project study area. Record width of the ditch between the OHWM on each bank. Ask the survey crew to survey all ditch bottoms in your project.\n\nFor sections of ditches meeting WOTUS wetland criteria:\n\nDocument these wetland ditches in the wetland section of the Wetland and Stream Assessment Report (WSAR).\n\nSurvey the ditch area and show feature(s) on plan sheets with a wetland boundary.\n\nFor ditches carrying streams/tributaries meeting WOTUS criteria:\n\nDocument these channelized streams in the stream section of the WSAR.\n\nSurvey the ditch area and show feature(s) on plan sheets with an OHWM or HTL boundary.\n\nFor ditches not carrying a jurisdictional wetland or stream, just show a surveyed ditch centerline on the plan sheets.\n\nDon’t document ditches in the WSAR or in a separate ditch memo. If the project may impact ditches that have jurisdictional waters in them, document proposed area of impacts (not volume) in the permit application and drawings. If submitting a Joint Aquatic Resources Permit Application (JARPA), provide a narrative of proposed impacts in the wetland section or stream section after describing all other WOTUS tributaries, as applicable. Use a line break to separate the two. Provide call outs and/or tables on JARPA drawings quantifying the area of impacted ditch sections. Use ditch width measurements collected during the field assessment. Include latitude and longitude for the center point of each impacted ditch section.\n\nDocument buffers\n\nDocument buffers on plans and permit application drawings. Follow How to document buffers for wetland & other waters (PDF 338KB).\n\nWrite the Wetland & Stream Assessment Report\n\nUse our Wetland & Stream Assessment Report template (DOC 110KB) (updated 9/11/2023) to document the findings of your assessment. See example reports:\n\nI-5/US 101 McAllister Creek & Mud Bay Bridges - Repair Bridge Piles (PDF 6.93MB)\n\nUS 101/Leland Creek and Tributaries - Remove Fish Barriers Project (PDF 22MB)\n\nAvoid discussing jurisdiction or impacts in the WSAR. Reports are valid for five years from the date of field work. If the project is delayed, review field work and update the WSAR or prepare a report addendum.\n\nUse Wetland and Stream Assessment Report Review Tips (PDF 170KB) to help review WSARs and make sure they are complete.\n\nAssume all waters are jurisdictional\n\nFor most projects, assume both the Corps and Ecology have jurisdiction over all waters to expedite project permitting. The Corps will use the permit application documents during final design to make a jurisdictional determination.\n\nIf you have a unique project where it would be critical to show that the waters are not federally regulated and your project can tolerate a potential six month timeline to obtain a Corps Approved Jurisdictional Determination (AJD), contact the MAPP manager at MAPP@wsdot.wa.gov to discuss your project. If a Corps AJD is required, use the Corps’ Regulatory Guidance Letter (RGL) 16-01: Jurisdictional Determinations (PDF 66KB). With the form in the RGL, submit the following documents to the liaisons at ESOPermittingLiaisons@wsdot.wa.gov:\n\nDrawings showing the location of waters in the project area and the relationship between ditches, streams, wetlands, and traditional navigable waters.\n\nThe WSAR with all appendices.\n\nDocument impacts\n\nCompare the surveyed wetland boundaries from the WSAR to proposed impact areas within the project area. Use the Common types of work and their impacts (PDF 185KB) for help determining what type of impact your proposed work will have on wetlands and streams.\n\nDocument potential impacts to wetlands and other waters and how they will be mitigated in the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) document. Use the Wetland Discipline Report (PDF 49KB) checklist if needed. If impacts to wetlands and other waters will be completely avoided, this documentation during NEPA is all you need.\n\nPrepare a Section 404(b)(1) alternatives analysis\n\nIf you determined during scoping that you will need an Individual Section 404 permit, prepare a Section 404(b)(1) alternatives analysis as part of the NEPA document or as a separate report. Use the Corps Alternatives analysis framework (PDF 151KB) and the AASHTO Practitioners Handbook 14: Applying the Section 404(b)(1) Guidelines in Transportation Project Decision-Making website to prepare the analysis. Put the required information into the NEPA document or into a separate report with our Section 404(b)(1) alternatives analysis template (DOCX 57KB). Ask the Permitting liaisons to review the analysis before you finalize it.\n\nWrite the Mitigation Plan\n\nIf there will be unavoidable impacts, follow the Corp’s Components of a mitigation plan (PDF 68KB) and Ecology’s Wetland Mitigation in Washington State: Part 2 – Developing Mitigation Plans (Joint Guidance) for Mitigation Plan requirements. Use our Mitigation Plan template (DOCX 119KB) that has comments with further instruction. Contact headquarters technical specialists to help review your Conceptual and Draft Mitigation Plan.\n\nIf you will purchase or use existing credits, write a Credit Use Plan and append it to the Mitigation Plan. See Washington State Department of Ecology's (Ecology) Wetland mitigation banking webpage for guidance on contents of Bank Credit Use Plans.\n\nThe Credit Use Plan should include:\n\nProject description\n\nAquatic resources impacts description (including acreage, function, and reference to the WSAR)\n\nAvoidance and minimization measures\n\nDescription of how the compensatory mitigation option was determined\n\nDescription of how the compensatory mitigation option provides appropriate compensation for impacted acreage and function of aquatic resources\n\nLedger showing debits and remaining credits\n\nIf developing a new compensation site, use Ecology’s Selecting Wetland Mitigation Sites Using a Watershed Approach (Western Washington [PDF 1MB]) (Eastern Washington [PDF 2MB]) to select a site. Use Ecology’s 2012 Interagency Regulatory Guide: Advance Permittee-Responsible Mitigation (PDF 368KB) to determine when the agencies will consider a new site advance mitigation. Initiate property acquisition. Conduct on-site vegetation, soil, and hydrological surveys. Document wetlands or other waters currently on the site in a WSAR. Use Writing Performance Standards for Wetland Mitigation (PDF 216KB) to help draft performance standards.\n\nDetermine how to protect the site in perpetuity. Consider opportunities to develop partnerships with other natural resource management entities or local jurisdictions. If possible, find willing partners we can transfer the compensation site to for long-term management.\n\nIf the site design for a new concurrent compensation site includes more wetland area than needed for project compensation, propose that the excess be available for use by other projects. Clearly state in the Mitigation Plan that any additional credit approved by the permitting agencies will be available for later use.\n\nRequest a pre-application coordination meeting\n\nPre-application coordination with WSDOT's MAPP team may occur when the project engineer or regional/modal environmental coordinator or biologist cannot answer complex questions with our web site and the Environmental Manual.\n\nConsider having a pre-application meeting with the MAPP team when a project:\n\nHas unique work or construction methodology and you aren’t sure of the types of impacts it will have.\n\nInvolves multiple partners (like a tribe) or stakeholders who have concerns that will not be resolved before the application is submitted.\n\nDoesn’t have a Federal Highways Administration nexus and the Corps is the federal lead.\n\nIs a bundle of multiple fish passage projects.\n\nThe Mitigation Plan is not consistent with the Joint Guidance.\n\nDiscuss project questions with the Corps and Ecology liaisons at the MAPP team meetings. The meetings occur every Monday from 9:30am to 10:30am. To get on the agenda for a Monday meeting or to schedule a separate pre-application meeting, email the Multi-Agency Permit Program Coordinator, at MAPP@wsdot.wa.gov.\n\nSend the following information to the MAPP coordinator one week before the pre-application meeting:\n\nList of questions you have for the liaisons\n\nProject description\n\nDraft plan sheets\n\nWSAR or other delineation documents that show the location and classification of wetlands to be impacted\n\nEstimated impacts for the whole project, each wetland, and total loss of waters\n\nRatings of wetlands that may be impacted\n\nWhich NWP you think the work can be covered under\n\nOther information you may end to help the liaisons understand the project includes:\n\nSite photos or drone footage\n\nDraft mitigation plan\n\nDraft JARPA form\n\nTopographical maps\n\nTimeline or summary of partner and stakeholder coordination\n\nAnything you think will help the liaisons better understand the project scope, impacts, or mitigation proposal\n\nCoordinate with the Multi-Agency Permitting Program team on design-build projects\n\nTo find more information on design build, see the Design-build webpage.\n\nPrior to requests for proposal\n\nPrior to requests for proposal, you usually will only have general or incomplete design information. Use the webpages during scoping to answer your questions and make a preliminary scope of permitting needs for the project. Contractors should use the webpages to determine staffing needs and develop statements of qualifications. Direct any questions you cannot answer to the Project Engineer.\n\nDuring procurement\n\nYou will have more design information and may have more design-specific questions. Use the webpages to answer your questions. Discuss your questions with the Project Engineer anytime there may be an issue or concern regarding contract requirements. If you still have unanswered questions, schedule a pre-application meeting with the MAPP coordinator.\n\nAfter apparent best value determination\n\nOnce a contractor is chosen, the design will become more specific. If the project has an assigned liaison, ask them your questions directly. If not, you may need a pre-application meeting. See the Pre-application coordination section above.\n\nThe contractor should still go through the project engineer and environmental coordinator before contacting the liaisons. The chosen contractor may contact the liaisons directly with questions only if they cc the WSDOT environmental coordinator and the MAPP coordinator.\n\nFollow these steps during the final design phase of your project:\n\nApply for Section 404/Section 10 permits, Section 401 & Administrative Orders\n\nApply for a Coastal Zone Management Act Consistency Determination\n\nApply for a Shoreline permit or approval\n\nFinalize the Mitigation Plan\n\nPurchase third-party mitigation credits\n\nModify permits\n\nApply for Section 404/Section 10 permits, Section 401 & Administrative Orders\n\nSee the Application documents matrix (PDF 84KB) to find out what documents to submit with your application.\n\nPlease note that if your project requires an Endangered Species Act Formal Consultation and the Corps is the Federal Lead, you will need to submit a \"federally complete application\" at the time of consultation request. Please visit the Endangered Species Act and Essential Fish Habitat page and the \"submit the permit applications\" section below for more information or contact the MAPP Coordinator.\n\nDetermine if an application is needed for Nationwide Permits\n\nIf the work fits a Nationwide Permit (NWP), check the National, Regional, and NWP-specific conditions to determine if you need to submit an application. Some projects may be covered under the NWPs without an application to the Corps. If no application is needed, document the coverage under the NWPs in Non-notifying NWP memo to file (DOCX 55KB).\n\nPrepare the application\n\nApplication form\n\nUse one of the following application forms depending on the type of work and type of permit coverage needed:\n\nNWP, Individual Permit, or Administrative Order (AO) for most projects - A Joint Aquatic Resource Permit Application (JARPA) form from the Office of Regulatory Innovation and Assistance’s JARPA form website\n\nNWP coverage for fish passage projects – our Fish Passage PCN (DOCX 105KB).\n\nNWP coverage for small maintenance projects – our Maintenance PCN (DOCX 58KB)\n\nSupplemental information\n\nSubmit the following information for a complete application.\n\nWetland assessment report including data forms and ratings\n\nDocumentation that the work complies with other federal laws, including Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (consultation must be complete for the Corps to issue a permit decision) and Endangered Species Act (ESA) (consultation must be complete for the Corps to issue a permit decision if they are the federal lead agency)\n\nMitigation plan - if greater than 1/10th acre of permanent wetland loss or greater than 3/100ths of an acre of streambed loss.\n\nRestoration plan – Show how impacted areas will be revegetated.\n\nColor photos of pre-project condition showing the Water of the US and Shoreline condition- This requirement is met if there are photos in the assessment report or mitigation plan. Additional photos assist the liaisons' understanding of site conditions and facilitate project review.\n\nFor NWP coverage, also submit information required by Regional General Conditions. Please note that you may be required to apply for Individual Water Quality Certification coverage. See the Stormwater and water quality webpage for more information.\n\nFor Individual Permits, also submit the Section 404(b)(1) alternatives analysis from preliminary design and the required CZMA documents.\n\nFor Administrative Orders, also submit the erosion and stormwater control plans. See the Stormwater & water quality webpage for instructions on how to prepare Erosion and Sediment Control Plan (TESC), Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP), and Water Quality Monitoring and Protection Plans during final design.\n\nTribal summary\n\nWith the application for NWP coverage or an Individual Permit, submit a chronological summary of all the tribal coordination efforts, which tribes were consulted, issues that were raised, resolution of issues, and approvals of the design by the tribes. The Corps doesn’t require this information, but it may help you get through permitting quicker.\n\nDrawings\n\nAll application drawings must meet the requirements on the Corps’ Drawing Checklist (PDF 43KB). Find sample drawings for different types of work on the Corps' Electronic Permit Guidebook - Samples & Drawing Checklist. Ensure that the information provided in your drawings matches the information throughout your application materials.\n\nDrawings should clearly show:\n\nExisting conditions\n\nLocation of waters of the US and the State and their buffers\n\nProposed work details (area, depths, quantities, and material types) - Include information on tree removal through AutoCAD or by providing additional information. Although not required, it facilitates a better understanding of the work and site conditions for review.\n\nImpacts (permanent and temporary) from the proposed work\n\nUse the Environmental Permit Application Drawing Template (PDF 613KB) for recommended title blocks, colors, symbols, hatch patterns, fonts, and page layouts. In the MicroStation WSDOT menu, use the search function to find the permit application or Environmental Permit elements.\n\nSubmit the permit applications\n\nBefore you submit an application, you must perform a Quality Control check. Ask a coworker or supervisor who is not familiar with the project to review the application for completeness and clarity. Thorough quality controls have been shown to greatly reduce permit issuance times.\n\nFollow the steps below to format electronic application documents:\n\nIf you have already been assigned a Corps reference number, put the number in the subject and body of the submittal email and on all application documents. If you do not have a reference number, leave a space to add one in the future.\n\nConvert all documents to PDFs.\n\nSubmit each application document as a separate file. Do not combine documents into a single large file.\n\nReduce the file sizes as much as possible.\n\nName each file using this format: YYYYMMDD-DocumentType.pdf. Use the document submittal date and the “Document Type” acronym from the JARPA and supplemental documents matrix (PDF 52KB). Use the date you submit the application at the beginning of the file name.\n\nSend 404/10/401 applications in an email to the Corps at NWS-PermitApp@usace.army.mil, and Ecology at ecyrefedpermits@ecy.wa.gov. Carbon copy the MAPP team at ESOpermittingliaisons@wsdot.wa.gov and program management staff, and either:\n\nAttach documents to the email – The Corps can receive emails with up to 40 mb of attachments. Send multiple emails if the attachments are larger than the limit and include the number of emails in the subject line. Example: NWS-1234-5278 Project Name application (1 of 3).\n\nPost documents to ftp sites – Request a link to the Corps ftp site from the Corps application email address. The Corps will send you a single-use link to access their ftp site. Post the application documents by following the instructions on the site.\n\nFor an individual water quality certification, you must submit a Pre-Filing Meeting Request form, found on Ecology's Publications and Forms webpage, 30 days before submitting the WQC application. You must include a 401 request in the WQC application submittal.\n\nFor administrative orders and individual water quality certifications that were not combined with a Corps application, send the application documents in an email to ecyrefedpermits@ecy.wa.gov, cc’ing ESOPermittingliaisons@wsdot.wa.gov and program management staff, and either:\n\nAttach documents to the email – Ecology can receive emails with up to 30 mb of attachments. If the attachments are more than 30 mb, follow the ftp instructions below.\n\nPost documents to ftp sites – In the body of the email, include a link to the WSDOT ftp website folder where the documents are located. Attach the Joint Aquatic Resource Permit Application (JARPA) directly to the email.\n\nApply for a Coastal Zone Management Act Consistency Determination\n\nIf the project needs a listed federal permit or license and is not programmatically covered by the NWP determination, email the Federal Consistency Certification form for activities which require federal approval (PDF 198KB) as part of the Section 404/10 Permit application or to the USCG for a Section 9 Bridge Permit. The Corps needs the form before they can issue the public notice for an Individual Permit. Please note that this includes Water Quality Certifications that may be required under reverification of section 404 permits. For more information on Individual Water Quality Certifications, see the Stormwater and water quality webpage.\n\nApply for a Shoreline permit or approval\n\nTo apply for a shoreline permit or approval, contact the shoreline planner at the city or county for direction on how to get a shoreline permit. Determine whether the local agency requires a JARPA or using their own permit application.\n\nFinalize the Mitigation Plan\n\nBefore you finalize the plan, get written conditional approval of the Draft Mitigation Plan from the permitting agencies. Prepare the final compensatory mitigation site design for contract during the design phase with development of the final plans, specifications, and estimates.\n\nIf you are developing a new compensatory mitigation site (compensation site), submit a Draft Long-Term Management (LTM) Plan to the Corps and Ecology. Incorporate the LTM Plan as an addendum to the approved Mitigation Plan or as a separate memorandum. The agencies must approve the LTM plan before the end of the compensation site monitoring period.\n\nPurchase third-party mitigation credits\n\nIf purchasing third-party mitigation credits, purchase after the permitting agencies approve the Credit Use Plan and the permit is verified. If there’s more than one bank, continue with a competitive process or document a formal justification as to why you won’t. If there’s only one bank, pursue a sole source of contract. Complete a formal sole source justification. Post all credit purchases on The Department of Enterprise Services, Washington Electronic Business Solutions as required.\n\nWork with a procurement professional or contracting officer to create a contract between WSDOT and the bank sponsor. Use the standard form contract. Contact your contracting officer if you need assistance.\n\nObtain and pay an invoice from the bank sponsor. Use the appropriate contract number and object code JA11 on the payment document. Then submit purchase documentation to the regulatory agencies.\n\nPermit Reverification or Modification\n\nDesign changes sometimes occur after a permit has been issued. These changes may require either a reverification to ensure the project still fits under the verified NWP or a modification if an Individual permit.\n\nIf you need to reverify your project, please use the \"Reverifications/Modifications impact tables (PDF 186KB)\" as an attachment to your request.\n\nIf your design or impacts change after you receive permits, contact the Corps and Ecology for more information. Reverification requests should be sent to ESOPermittingLiaisons@wsdot.wa.gov."
