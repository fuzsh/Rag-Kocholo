        "text": "The Rurutu Hotspot RR1310 Expedition plans to dredge 20 seamounts in the Tuvalu-Samoa area of the western Pacific. We aim to address the hypothesis stating that the Rurutu hotspot in French Polynesia formed a long-lived seamount trail that extends at least into the Tuvalu area and contains a pronounced bend synchronous with the Hawaii-Emperor bend. The goals of the project will be accomplished by utilizing geochemical fingerprinting combined with absolute age dating.

G-439 will work below the sea-ice, in frozen lakes in the Dry Valleys and fumarolic ice caves on the ice-covered 14,000 feet tall Mt. Erebus volcano, the southernmost active volcano on Planet Earth. Follow this website read about the G-439 project. Visit the Expedition Website ...\n\nExpedition MV1203 aims to dredge 40 seamounts along the southwest portion of the Walvis Ridge seamount trail. The Walvis Ridge begins on the African continent and extends to near the mid-Atlantic Ridge. The southwest half of the Walvis Ridge appears to bifurcate into two distinct physical and geochemical trends, the Tristan (northern) and Gough (southern) tracks. The data we collect will assist in improving absolute plate motion models for the African continent, and knowledge of the geochemical evolution of plumes and the regional tectonic setting of the surrounding area.

One hypothesis states that these volcanoes formed above a narrow plume of hot mantle rising from a position deep in the Earth's mantle. For decades scientists assumed these mantle plumes remain anchored there for tens of millions years, but there is mounting evidence that mantle plumes wander in a large-scale mantle wind. This expedition aims to establish how much mantle plumes may have moved over the last 80 million years and whether the Louisville hotspot moved coherently with the Hawaii hotspot.

This international workshop focuses on a wide range of biological, chemical and physical seamount science themes from their deep-earth origin to their oceanography, ecology and fisheries. This workshop will provide a representative overview over state-of-the art seamount science through keynotes and poster presentations.

Currently, we are about to finish the Second Phase of this Redesign Project, in which we have improved the functionality and information displayed on the home pages for EarthRef.org, GERM, MagIC and ERESE. Each of these web sites will function as the Web Portal for its corresponding database, while taking advantage of the infra-structure provided by the EarthRef.org umbrella web site and database. Please check back with us on a regular basis to see how the design evolves over the next few months. We would appreciate your comments or suggestions through the Feedback form.\n\nA two week learning segment on Hotspot Volcanoes has been implemented through a collaborative effort between Melanie McWilliams, a high school Earth and Planetary Science teacher at Chula Vista High School in California, and Jamie A. Russell, a masters student at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. Utilizing data collected during Jamie's research, the students were taught about the hotspot theory and how hotspot volcanoes are important to understanding other Earth science concepts. The segment begins with five lessons, one for each day of the week and culminates with a group project for the students.

All keynote presentations are now available as Microsoft Powerpoint presentations, Adobe Acrobat PDF's or QuickTime Movies from the ERDA digital archive. Poster presentations will become available from this online archive as well over the coming weeks. Download here ...\n\nThe First SBN Workshop will be held on March 24-25, 2006 at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla, California. The goal of the Seamount Biogeosciences Network (SBN) is to bring together all the diverse science disciplines involved in seamount research, to communicate about and discuss seamount science and to explore innovative ways to network amongst the diverse communities that work on seamounts. This upcoming workshop will feature keynote and discussion sessions on important seamount science issues, the sharing of data across disciplines, and the potential of sharing shore-based and seagoing logistics. SBN is funded as Research Coordination Network (RCN) by the NSF-BIO and OCE directorates.

Combined these areas equal Australia's Great Barrier National Park. By not fishing in these areas, their deepwater corals and accompanying benthic fauna will gain protection in one of the least explored deepwater areas of the world.
