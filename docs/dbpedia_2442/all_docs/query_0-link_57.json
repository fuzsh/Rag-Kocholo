        "text": "1. Introduction\n\nMumps is a highly transmissible disease caused by a negative-sense single stranded RNA virus in the Paramyxoviriade family (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2015). Symptoms include fever, malaise, and characteristic salivary gland swelling (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2015). Complications can be severe and include meningitis, infertility, deafness, and spontaneous abortion if infection occurs during early pregnancy (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2015; Galazka et al., 1999). Historically, in the United States, cases were common; however, a vaccine licensed in 1967 was widely used and reduced mumps case counts dramatically (Barskey et al., 2009). Concerningly, mumps cases have increased in the past 20 years (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2018) and the reason for this recent reemergence of mumps is currently under investigation. Possible reasons include decreased vaccination rates (National Immunization Program (CDC), 1999), waning vaccine-induced immunity (Cohen et al., 2007; Cortese et al., 2008; Lewnard and Grad, 2018), and decreased vaccine efficacy caused by mismatch between circulating viral strains and the vaccine strains (Kaaijk et al., 2008; May et al., 2018). Distinguishing which candidate drivers contribute to mumps reemergence requires comparing reemerging mumps epidemics to mumps epidemics that occur in unvaccinated populations. Because mumps vaccination has been widespread in the US, we aim to compare reemerging mumps epidemics to historical mumps data collected before vaccination was implemented. To these ends, we quantify historical mumps epidemic dynamics in the United States from 1923 to 1932. Four factors important to quantify from these historical case timeseries data are (1) persistence criteria, (2) correlation between population size and new case counts, (3) temporal dynamics, and (4) spatial dynamics (Bjørnstad et al., 2002). This work will provide the baseline information needed to design science-based recommendations that reduce mumps cases.\n\nFirst, as an overview of mumps persistence criteria, we intend to quantify how epidemic duration is affected by population size. In some locations, chains of transmission are sustained with susceptible replenishment and/or high contact among individuals that allow the disease to persist in the population over time (Conlan and Grenfell, 2007). In other locations, a pathogen can cause episodic epidemics followed by periods without cases, known as “fadeouts.” A threshold population size, known as the critical community size (CCS), separates populations with persistence from populations with fadeouts (Bartlett, 1960; Black, 1966). If a population has a total size greater than the CCS, the disease will persist endemically; if a population has a total size less than the CCS, the disease exhibits episodic epidemics and then will fade out. For measles, the CCS is between 300,000 to 500,000 individuals (Bartlett, 1960; Bjørnstad et al., 2002; Black, 1966). Quantifying the CCS in the pre-vaccination era will inform mumps persistence criteria.\n\nSecond, as an overview of mumps transmission, we aim to determine how transmission scales with population size. In some host pathogen systems, transmission scales linearly and positively with population size. In these cases, when population size increases, contacts also increase, causing increases in transmission rates and case counts. This is known as density-dependent transmission (Begon et al., 2002; Ferrari et al., 2011; Klepac et al., 2009; McCallum et al., 2001). In other host-pathogen systems, transmission does not scale with population size. In these cases, increases in population size do not cause linear and positive increases in contacts, transmission, and cases (Begon et al., 2002; Ferrari et al., 2011; Klepac et al., 2009; McCallum et al., 2001). Determining how transmission scales with population size will inform models of mumps virus transmission (Begon et al., 2002; McCallum et al., 2001) and calculations of important epidemiological metrics that inform design of disease control programs, such as the number of secondary cases produced by a primary case in a totally suspceptible population (R0) (Lloyd-Smith et al., 2005a).\n\nThird, as an overview of mumps temporal dynamics, we quantify seasonal variation in mumps case counts and mumps virus transmission. Cases of most acute immunizing infectious diseases are not evenly distributed throughout the year (Martinez, 2018): bacterial diseases are the most prevalent in summer (Gautam et al., 2011; Metcalf et al., 2009), mosquito-borne diseases peak in late summer or early fall (Altizer et al., 2006), and influenza A is widespread in late fall and winter in temperate regions (Simonsen, 1999). Quantifying seasonal patterns in infectious disease dynamics is important because these patterns implicate epidemic drivers. For example, analyses of pre-vaccination era measles cases in the United Kingdom (UK) indicated that measles transmission correlated with the K-12 school calendar, implicating within-school transmission among children as a key transmission route (Bjørnstad et al., 2002). Identifying the seasons during which mumps was most prevalent in the pre-vaccination era contributes to the understanding of natural mumps virus transmission dynamics, identifies transmission routes, and can inform epidemic timing in the post-vaccination era.\n\nFourth, as an overview of mumps spatial dynamics, we quantify geographic patterns of spread. Different spatial patterns have been observed during previous outbreaks: distance-based, hierarchical, based on latitude or longitude, and synchronous outbreaks in multiple cities. For example, distance-based spread has been observed for rotavirus (Pitzer et al., 2009) and foot-and-mouth disease (Pomeroy et al., 2017), in which an infected individual causes secondary infections only among individuals located nearby. Epidemics can spread from a location to its nearest neighbors and travel in waves throughout large geographic areas. Alternatively, measles has exhibited hierarchical spatial spread, in which cities with large population sizes experience epidemics before outbreaks spread to smaller, adjacent towns (Bharti et al., 2008; Xia et al., 2004). Understanding which spatial patterns of spread pathogens exhibit informs control policies. Determining spatial patterns of spread for pre-vaccination era mumps can characterize the natural history of mumps and inform control policy in the vaccination era.\n\nModels of infectious disease dynamics have been used extensively in analyses of historical timeseries to quantify temporal dynamics, persistence thresholds, and spatial dynamics. Here, we use historical timeseries that quantify mumps cases in cities throughout the US from 1923 to 1932 with mechanistic models of mumps transmission dynamics to provide a quantitative overview of uncontrolled mumps transmission dynamics before vaccination in the US. By characterizing and quantifying mumps dynamics in the pre-vaccination era, we will be able to better identify drivers of reemergence in the current era.\n\n2. Materials and methods\n\n2.1. Data\n\nMumps data were downloaded from Project Tycho (https://www.tycho.pitt.edu) on January 28, 2021 (Van Panhuis et al. 2018). The data report mumps incidence, defined here as new cases of mumps, for each week from December 30, 1923 to October 8, 1932. Mumps incidence data were reported for 70 cities located in 37 states across the United States plus Washington, DC. Notably, mumps data were not reported for New York, NY, which was the most populous city in the US at that time. We excluded data from Montgomery, Alabama from further analyses because mumps cases were considerably underreported with data only available for 12 weeks in 1924. We also excluded other mumps timeseries that were incomplete from further analyses. Excluded timeseries had more than 12 % of weeks with missing data and/or total case counts summed over the entire 8 + year study period of 15 or lower. Applying these criteria, we excluded 10 additional cities, which left 59 locations located in 32 states for further analyses (Table S1). The timeseries from Spokane, WA was used to calculate the CCS and other data analyses but removed from transmission analyses (i.e., calculating β and Re, see below) due to unfeasibility because cases were not recorded in subsequent weeks.\n\nWe digitized population data from the 1930 US Census, which was available as a set of multiple pdf files available for download (https://www.census.gov/library/publications/1931/dec/1930a-vol-01-population.html) (US Department of Commerce: Bureau of the Census, 1931). The US Census files contain counts of the population of principal cities, minor civil divisions, and incorporated places for each state. For each of the 59 locations in the mumps dataset, we found the population size in 1930 and hereafter denote that value as the total population size (N).\n\nBirth data from the US Census were digitized by Martinez et al. and available for download as a csv file (https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.3p008p4) (Martinez-Bakker et al., 2018). The data report new births, by state, for each month from 1915 through 2008, but some locations did not report births before 1930 (i.e., Washington, DC and all locations in Texas). Therefore, we restricted our analyses that used birth data to the 42 locations in the mumps dataset with complete birth records for our study period (locations in Table S1 designated as “full” birth data). We converted state-level birth data to city-level birth data by allocating a fraction of state births to each city in proportion to the fraction of the state’s population that resided in that city in June, 1930. Likewise, we converted monthly birth data to weekly birth data by allocating births equally throughout the weeks in any given month.\n\n2.2. Population size effects\n\nWe quantified the critical community size (CCS), which is the threshold population size below which mumps transmits as periodic epidemic dynamics and above which mumps transmits as sustained chains-of-transmission resulting in endemic dynamics individuals (Bartlett, 1960; Bjørnstad et al., 2002; Black, 1966). To determine the CCS, we quantified fadeouts, which we defined as four-week intervals with zero mumps cases reported, for each of the 59 cities with complete timeseries of mumps cases and with no adjustments for underreporting. We considered a four-week interval as the fadeout duration necessary to indicate that mumps virus transmission ceased because it is an interval longer than the generation time of mumps (16–18 day incubation plus 5 day clinical period) (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2015). We plotted the number of months without fadeouts by city size and noted the city sizes at which no fadeouts occurred following previous studies (Bartlett, 1960; Bjørnstad et al., 2002; Black, 1966). The minimum city size at which no fadeouts occurred is the CCS.\n\nTo determine if mumps transmitted in a density-dependent or frequency-dependent manner, we plotted the number of mumps cases reported – again, with no adjustments for underreporting – against city size following Bjørnstad et al. (Bjørnstad et al., 2002). If cases increased linearly as city size increased, then density-dependent transmission occurred. If cases did not increase linearly as city size increased, then frequency-dependent transmission occurred. We calculated the strength of the linear association by calculating Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient using the cor.test function with method = “spearman” in R (R Core Team, 2021).\n\n2.3. SEIR transmission model\n\nWe modeled mumps virus transmission using the susceptible, exposed, infectious, removed (SEIR) model (Anderson and May, 1992; Keeling and Rohani, 2008). In this framework, individuals are categorized according to their disease status. Susceptible individuals (S) are those who have never experienced infection and have no immunological protection against the virus. Exposed individuals (E) are those who have contracted the virus and are infected but cannot yet transmit the virus to another individual; they are infected but not infectious. Infectious individuals (I) are infected and infectious; they can transmit the virus. Recovered individuals (R) have experienced infection, recovered, and mounted an immune response that protects them against another infection with the same mumps virus. Because this model represents mumps transmission in the pre-vaccination era, we did not include a vaccinated (V) category.\n\nLet Et,i represent the number of exposed individuals at timestep t, which is 7 days long and is henceforth referred to as a weekly timestep, at city i. Then, the count of exposed individuals at weekly timestep t +1 at city i can be calculated as\n\nEt+1,i=Et,i+λt,iSt,i−σEt,i\n\n(1)\n\nwhere St,i represents the number of susceptible individuals at weekly timestep t and city i, λt,i represents the force of infection that varies by week at city i, and σ represents the per capita rate of progressing from the E state to the I state, which does not vary over time or by location. The per capita rate of progressing from E to I (σ) is the inverse of the amount of time that individuals remain in the exposed state, also known as the incubation period. Additional equations and parameter values are provided in the supplementary material (Text S1, Equations S1–S2, Table S2).\n\nAnalyses determined that the relationship between city size and number of new mumps cases scaled linearly, indicating density-dependent transmission ( ) (Begon et al., 2002). Therefore, we modeled the force of infection at city i (λt,i) as\n\nλt,i=βt,iIt,i,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere βt,i represents the transmission for coefficient city i, which varies by week (Begon et al., 2002).\n\nLet St,i represent the number of susceptible individuals in city i at weekly timestep t. We reconstructed counts of susceptible individuals at timestep t +1 in city i as\n\nSt+1,i=St,i+Bt−16,i−βt,iSt,iIt,i\n\n(3)\n\nwhere Bt−16.i are the number of births recorded in city i 16 weeks prior, because 3.8 months is the duration that infants born to non-vaccinated mothers retain maternal immunity against mumps (Leuridan et al., 2012).\n\nWe set initial conditions using the data from city i to inform both E0,i and I0,i, with underreporting considered at proportion pt,i such that E0,i = (1 + pt,i)(Ot+1,i + Ot+2,i)and I0,i = (1 + pt,i)(Ot,i). Because mumps was uncontrolled when the data were collected, we assumed that a time-varying proportion of residents in city i had contracted mumps and recovered with conferred immunity (rt,i). Then, we calculated R0,i = rt,iNi, where rt,i ≤ 1and Ni represents the population size of city i as reported in the 1930 US Census. Because Ni = St,i + Et,i + It,i + Rt,i, we reconstructed the initial susceptible count in city i as\n\nS0,i=Ni+B−16−E0,i−I0,i−R0,i\n\n(4)\n\nWe quantified the transmission rate (βt,i), the proportion of cases that were not reported (pt,i), and proportion of residents that had contracted mumps and recovered with conferred immunity (rt,i) for each weekly timestep in each city i using the optim function in R. If there were no case count data available for city i at timestep t, then we did not calculate any parameter values.\n\nTo quantify the transmission coefficient (βt,i), we used maximum likelihood techniques to fit the model to mumps case count data from each city i at each week t. Because case count data are consistently underreported due to multiple factors, including asymptomatic infection, lack of interaction with the medical system, lack of resources for comprehensive surveillance, etc., we accounted for underreporting in the model when reported case counts were greater than zero. Let Et+1,i represent the true number of individuals in the exposed state in city i at timestep t, Ot,i represent observed mumps data in city i at timestep t, and pt,i represent the proportion of cases that were not reported in city i at timestep t. We assumed Poisson likelihoods for number of individuals in the exposed state, following\n\nEt+1,i∼Poisson((1+pt,i)(Ot+2,i+Ot+3,i))\n\n(5)\n\nHalf of the individuals in the E state at time t + 1would enter the I state at time t +2 and appear in the timeseries data as Ot+2,i, albeit underreported; the other half of the individuals in the E state at time t + 1would enter the I state at time t +3 and appear in the timeseries data as O t+3,i, again, underreported. However, if case count data indicated that there were 0 cases for city i at timestep t, then estimated βi,t = 0 and we did not estimate pt,i or rt,i.\n\n2.4. Epidemiological metrics\n\nWe used estimated parameter values to calculate the number of secondary cases caused by each infectious case when a proportion of the population is immune (Re). For density-dependent transmission, R0=βSγ (Lloyd-Smith et al., 2005a). We quantified Re for each city i at time t as\n\nRe,t,i=βt,i(Ni−rt,iNi)γ.\n\n(6)\n\nWe calculated the mean overall Re. Additionally, for each city, we calculated the mean, minimum, and maximum Re, the 95th percentile of the weekly Re, and the maximum value of the weekly Re.\n\n2.5. Temporal transmission analyses\n\nWe completed four analyses to quantify temporal aspects of transmission. First, we quantified how often epidemics occurred using wavelet analysis implemented with the WaveletComp package in R (Roesch and Schmidbauer, 2018). These wavelet analyses required observations without missing data; therefore, we substituted missing data points with the mean value of the preceding and succeeding values following Magpantay and Rohani (Magpantay and Rohani, 2015). Second, we identified the month(s) in which mumps epidemics most peaked. Third, we quantified the mumps virus transmission rate for each week in the timeseries using the SEIR transmission model described above. Fourth, we determined if incidence or the transmission coefficient correlated with counts of new births by calculating Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient. We used the cor.test function with method = “spearman” in R.\n\n2.6. Spatial transmission analyses\n\nWe completed three analyses to quantify spatial spread. First, we determined if outbreaks in each city pair occurred in synchrony – meaning that the case counts increased, peaked, and decreased on the same dates – by calculating Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient for mumps case timeseries for all pairs of cities in the dataset. We used the cor.test function with method = “spearman” in R. Second, we determined if peak timing and final epidemic size varied with distance using the Mantel test. We used the distm function in the geosphere package (Hijmans, 2021) to calculate distances between cities from latitude and longitude R. Then, we used the mantel function in the vegan package (Oksanen et al., 2020). Third, we determined if peak timing or final epidemic size correlated with latitude or longitude using Pearson’s correlation implemented as detailed above.\n\n2.7. Computing\n\nAll model building, parameter estimation, data analysis, and graphing was performed in R version 4.0.5 (R Core Team, 2021) with RStudio (R Studio Team, 2016).\n\n3. Results\n\n3.1. Mumps data\n\nBetween December 30, 1923 and October 8, 1932, a total of 239,230 mumps cases were reported in the 70 cities with mumps data. In the 59 cities with the most complete datasets, 238,164 mumps cases were reported. Cleveland, OH reported the most cases in this interval (23,293 cases) and Galveston, TX reported the least cases in this interval (33 cases). Mumps time series for eight cities that reported data are depicted in . These cities ranged in population size from 3,376,438 (Chicago, IL) to 11,803 (Helena, MT).\n\n3.2. Population size effects\n\nFadeouts – defined as four-week periods during which no cases were reported – declined exponentially as city size increased. Fadeouts were frequently observed at city sizes less than 365,583. The smallest city without fadeouts had 365,583 inhabitants. Some cities with populations between 365,583 and 781,188 demonstrated fadeouts while others did not. Only one city larger than 781,188 inhabitants demonstrated fadeouts; this one city experienced a very short fadeout that lasted for 0.46 % of the 9-year duration studied ( ). Therefore, the CCS for mumps in the United States in the pre-vaccination era is likely to be between 365,583 and 781,188 individuals but could range as high as 3,376,438 individuals.\n\nMumps case count increased as city size increased ( ) with a Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient of 0.717 (p-value < 2.2e-16). This relationship supports density-dependent transmission of mumps virus.\n\n3.3. Epidemiological metrics\n\nWe found the transmission coefficient (βt,i) to have a mean estimate of 2.069 × 10−4; the proportion of the population that had contracted mumps and recovered with conferred immunity (rt,i) to have a mean estimate of 0.972, and the proportion of cases that were not reported in each city (pt,i) to have a mean estimate of 0.295. Across all cities and weekly timesteps, we calculated a mean Re = 1.20, indicating that mumps virus transmission was frequent and widespread during this era.\n\nRe varied by city and by week. The city with the highest mean Re over all weeks was Milwaukee, WI with Re = 2.50. The city with the lowest mean Re was Frederick, MD with Re = 0.0113. The maximum Re values over all weeks and all cities ranged from 1.92 to 56.30. The 95th percentile for Re values over all weeks and all cities had a mean value of 4.50 and ranged from 0.08 to 8.03. This distribution of Re values indicated the periodic occurrence of transmission at levels greater than the mean Re and, at times, included short, punctuated periods of high spread.\n\n3.4. Temporal dynamics\n\nThe larger cities showed consistent annual epidemics, while the smaller cities showed intermittent, sporadic outbreaks that occurred less frequently than once per year (Fig. S1). Across all 59 cities and all 9 years of data, mumps cases most often peaked in March. Peaks were also observed in January, February, April, and December. Mumps cases were least likely to peak during the summer and early fall months of July, August, and September (Fig. S2).\n\nEstimated weekly values for the transmission coefficient in each city (βt,i) using a density dependent SEIR model showed lower than mean annual values in in 1925–1926 and 1929–1930. Higher than mean annual values occurred in 1924, 1927–1928, and 1931–1932 ( ). Seasonal patterns – within a year – were also present. Transmission coefficients steadily increased from late August until late April, with the highest transmission rates occurring during Spring from February through April. Transmission rates decreased throughout the summer (late May through mid-August) and relatively lower transmission rates also occurred in early December ( ). While transmission rates remained low throughout the summer, most years exhibited a notable increase around the fourth of July holiday (Fig. S3). Comparing the variation in transmission rates on the yearly ( ) and weekly ( ) scales indicates more deviation from the mean within a year than between years.\n\nWeekly values for the proportion immune in each city (rt,i) and the proportion of cases that were not reported in each city (pt,i) also varied over time. The value of the rt,i parameter estimate averaged over all cities ranged from a weekly minimum of 0.759 in late December of 1930 to a weekly maximum of 1.066 in November of 1925. The small number of estimated parameter values barely greater than 1 likely indicates slight inaccuracies in the total population counts or number of births. The value of the pt,i parameter estimate averaged over all cities ranged from a weekly minimum of 0.222 in late June of 1926 to a weekly maximum of 0.417 in mid-October of 1929. Overall, the population had a high level of mumps immunity and mumps cases were underreported.\n\nWeekly mean incidence was also positively correlated with weekly new births (Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient = 0.527; p-value < 2.2e-16 but exact p-value could not be computed because of ties). Weekly mean transmission coefficients were weakly positively correlated with weekly new births (Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient = 0.346; p-value < 2.2e-16 but exact p-value could not be computed because of ties). Neither yearly mean incidence nor yearly mean transmission coefficients were statistically significantly correlated with yearly new births (mean incidence: Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient = 0.238; p-value = 0.582; mean transmission coefficients: Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient = 0.142; p-value = 0.752).\n\n3.5. Spatial dynamics\n\nTo determine if mumps dynamics in different cities occurred in synchrony, we calculated Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient for the mumps case timeseries for all pairs of cities in the dataset. There were not any city pairs with correlation coefficients greater than 0.77. The city pair with the most synchronous mumps case counts indicated by the highest correlation coefficient and location in adjacent states was Cleveland, OH with Pittsburgh, PA. Two additional city pairs had synchronous mumps case counts, indicated by a slightly lower correlation coefficient between 0.7 and 0.77 and location in adjacent states: Chicago, IL with Detroit, MI and Cleveland, OH with Indianapolis, IN ( and ). All synchronous cities were in the Midwest region of the United States, but there were no other intrinsic spatial patterns between paired cities as some were located in a north-south direction, others were located in an east-west direction, and others were diagonally located. While certain pairs of cities had synchronous mumps dynamics, most cities did not.\n\nTo determine if epidemic characteristics varied with distance, we performed the Mantel test to calculate correlations, first, between distance and peak timing and, second, between distance and final epidemic size. For distance and peak timing, the Mantel statistic r for distance and peak timing was 0.06217 and the significance was 0.1651. For distance and final epidemic size, the Mantel statistic r was −0.009611 and the significance was 0.5186. Therefore, we found no significant correlation between distance and peak timing nor final epidemic size.\n\nTo determine if epidemic characteristics varied with latitude or longitude, we calculated Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient for latitude or longitude and peak timing, final epidemic size, and mean value of the transmission coefficient (β). Mean peak timing and the final epidemic size correlated weakly with latitude (peak timing: 0.236, p-value = 0.07182 but exact p-value cannot be computed because of ties; final epidemic size: 0.466, p-value = 0.0002344). All other epidemic characteristics did not statistically significantly correlate with latitude. All epidemic characteristics did not statistically significantly correlate with longitude. Therefore, we found that only peak timing and final epidemic size correlated positively – but weakly – with latitude.\n\n4. Discussion\n\nWe analyzed historical mumps data reported from 1923 to 1932 in 59 cities to characterize mumps transmission dynamics in the US before vaccination to provide baseline information that can help inform present-day mumps reemergence. We found that mumps transmission was frequent and widespread with dynamics that varied by city size. In the larger cities, transmission consistently occurred and caused annual epidemics. In the smaller cities, transmission sporadically occurred and caused infrequent, periodic outbreaks. The critical community size (CCS) above which transmission consistently occurred was between 365,583 and 781,188 individuals but could range as high as 3,376,438 individuals. Most individuals had mumps immunity: the mean estimate was 97 % immune and weekly values varied between 76 % and 100 % immune. Moreover, many mumps cases were not reported. We estimated that the true mumps case count was, on average,1.295 times of the reported mumps case count, with weekly values varying between 1.222 and 1.417. Because the proportion of unreported cases, by definition, will be greater than the proportion of asymptomatic cases, our estimates align with other studies that indicate approximately 15–27 % of all infections in the pre-vaccine era were asymptomatic (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2015). We found that transmission was density-dependent and seasonal, with the highest transmission coefficient values observed in February and April and the lowest transmission coefficient values observed throughout the late spring and summer (May through August). Finally, certain pairs of cities showed synchronous mumps dynamics, but most cities showed asynchronous dynamics with mean peak timing weakly and positively correlating with latitude.\n\nA key epidemiological metric, Re, quantifies the number of secondary cases caused by each primary case in a population that has partial immunity. We calculated the mean mumps Re across all weeks and all cities as 1.2. Because the Re > 1, this implies that each infectious individual caused, on average, more than 1 other case. Mumps transmission was consistent and widespread, especially in cities larger than the CCS. Historical data from military recruits supports this finding, as the military reported a lack of mumps immunity and delayed age of first mumps infection more often among their recruits from rural areas (Barskey et al., 2009). The 95th percentile of weekly Re values had a mean value of 4.5 across the different US cities, similar to pre-vaccination estimates of mumps R0 in Copenhagen, Denmark (R0 = 3.94) (Metcalf et al., 2009) and seven European countries (R0 ranged from 3.6 to 4.5) (Edmunds et al., 2000). The maximum weekly Re value for each city ranged from 1.92 to 56.3 and indicates the number of individuals infected during superspreading events, or short periods of unusually high transmission [42]. The higheset values for weekly Re calculated here for mumps are similar to the highest Re values calculated for other infectious diseases including COVID (Hamner et al., 2020), tuberculosis, Streptococcus group A, measles, smallpox, SARS, and Ebola (Lloyd--Smith et al., 2005b). Overall, our estimates confirmed that Re varies by city and over time.\n\nTemporal patterns of mumps dynamics in the pre-vaccination era are like those observed for other directly transmitted, acute, immunizing, infectious diseases in the absence of vaccination. Weekly values for mumps transmission showed a strong signature of seasonality that correlated with weekly birth rates with intermediate strength (0.527), implicating demographic drivers but not excluding seasonal or social drivers. Mumps transmission was very low during the summer months, increased throughout the fall, and remained high throughout the winter and spring. This pattern is consistent with other viral diseases (Bjørnstad et al., 2002; Martinez, 2018; Metcalf et al., 2009), especially in North America (Patel et al., 2013), which correlates with dates when children are in school (Bjørnstad et al., 2002). During the 1920s and early 1930s, in the US, children attended public schools between late August or September and June (Weiss and Brown, 2003), aligning with the dates of high or increasing mumps transmission. Because mumps is a childhood disease, it is possible that pre-vaccination mumps transmission in the US was driven by school-term forcing, similar to pre-vaccination era measles in the UK (Bjørnstad et al., 2002) and 2009 pandemic influenza transmission in Mexico (Tamerius et al., 2015).\n\nSpatial patterns of transmission showed weak evidence for geographically influenced dynamics. We found that multiple epidemic characteristics did not vary by distance. However, three pairs of closely located cities with medium or large population sizes showed synchronized mumps dynamics, which can occur locally due to residents’ movement between the city pair or regionally due to climatic forcing (Bjørnstad, 2000). Synchronous city pairs present some evidence for hierarchical disease spread, during which cities with larger population sizes experience epidemics before smaller, adjacent towns, like during pre-vaccination measles epidemics in the United Kingdom (Bharti et al., 2008; Xia et al., 2004). Additionally, mumps epidemic characteristics varied weakly by latitude, similar to other within-country findings of influenza, another directly transmitted infectious disease, in Brazil (Almeida et al., 2018). Correlations with latitude present some evidence for climatic forcing – as temperature and humidity correlate with mumps dynamics (Onozuka and Hashizume, 2011) – or behavioral forcing, due to contact rate changes or school terms. Therefore, our analyses found weak but non-definitive evidence for hierarchical spread mediated by climatic or behavioral forcing in pre-vaccination era mumps transmission. More research is needed to confirm these findings.\n\nWe took care to analyze the most complete and highest resolution datasets available; nevertheless, our analyses had limitations and both disease and birth data were incomplete. Many of our analyses used correlation coefficients to quantify synchrony in timeseries of cases because they quantify paired timeseries of infectious disease dynamics across cities that range in population size. However, this method assumes data are normally or monotonically distributed data and calculates linear associations, so non-linear associations and mechanisms driving correlations may remain undetected. Additionally, disease data analyzed here were not age-structured and likely underrepresented the true burden of mumps in the pre-vaccination era in two ways. First, inequities in infectious disease burden are mirrored by inequities in infectious disease surveillance data (Zipfel et al., 2021), suggesting that individuals of low socioeconomic status (SES) are likely missing from these data while simultaneously experiencing high mumps incidence (Tizzoni et al., 2022). Secondly, data from New York, NY were unavailable. Because this was – and still is – the most populous city in the US, with a population well above the CCS, it likely experienced year-round transmission. Cities with large populations often experience epidemics before smaller towns (Bharti et al., 2008; Xia et al., 2004), so the absence of data from New York, NY might obscure or prevent us from detecting spatial patterns. However, the lack of data from New York, NY would be unlikely to bias our other analyses, including those that quantified the CCS and temporal dynamics. Likewise, data on new births were often missing. Data that were available were on a monthly timescale, and we analyzed them by distributing monthly data equally among the four weeks in a month. Because birth data often display seasonality that affects disease dynamics (Dorelien, 2012; Martinez-Bakker et al., 2014), this might have led to biased transmission estimates. Nevertheless, our findings indicate that pre-vaccination era transmission dynamics of mumps in the US emulates pre-vaccination era transmission dynamics of mumps in other locations (Metcalf et al., 2009) and other directly transmitted, acute, immunizing diseases of childhood, including measles (Bjørnstad et al., 2002) and influenza (Almeida et al., 2018).\n\nHypothesized drivers, or causes, of the current mumps reemergence include decreased vaccination rates (National Immunization Program (CDC), 1999), waning vaccine-induced immunity (Cohen et al., 2007; Cortese et al., 2008; Lewnard and Grad, 2018), and decreased vaccine efficacy caused by mismatch between circulating viral strains and the vaccine strains (Kaaijk et al., 2008; May et al., 2018). This analysis of historical mumps timeseries provides historical context that supports feasibility for both the decreased vaccination rates hypothesis and the waning vaccine-induced immunity hypothesis. Because we found continual mumps transmission in the largest cities and estimated Re values that require very high vaccination coverage to confer herd immunity, it is worth investigating if decreases in mumps vaccination rates contribute to reemergence. Because we found that the population-wide proportion of individuals immune to mumps virus (ri) decreased over time with transmission correlating with intermediate strength with new births, it is worth investigating if individual-level immunity wanes over time. Because this work analyzed pre-vaccination era dynamics, this work cannot inform the hypothesized driver of vaccine mismatch (neither supporting nor finding a lack of support) because it is far beyond the scope of this work.\n\nThis work also demonstrates the importance and usefulness of long-term historical datasets of infectious disease incidence that are generated by routine surveillance, following ecological studies (e.g., (Langwig et al., 2012)). Here, we provide baseline information on mumps incidence during the pre-vaccination era to compare to the vaccination and reemergence eras. In future analyses, this information will help identify reasons for current mumps reemergence and science-based strategies to decrease mumps virus transmission."
