        "text": "Surface Description\n\nBoundary â The county of Dallas is situated in the southwest central part of the State of Missouri, on the northern slope of the Ozark Mountain Range, in latitude 38 north, and longitude 93 and 94 west from Greenwich, England. It is bounded on the north by Hickory and Camden Counties, on the east by Laclede, on the south by Webster and Greene, and on the west by Polk and Hickory Counties. It has an area of 543 square miles, or 347,520 acres.\n\nTopography â The topography presents some striking features. The surface is varied, from level and gently undulating to rolling, and in the vicinity of the larger streams it is broken and hilly. There are numerous prairies within the county, varying in extent from one to fifteen sections of land, the greater part of them being in the western part thereof. These lands constitute about one-fourth of the entire area of the county, the remainder being timbered. The ridge and table lands are covered with a light, scrubby growth of several varieties of oak, while the valley or bottom lands are covered with burr, Spanish and chinquapin oak, black and white walnut, sycamore, elm, hickory, ash, cherry, maple, etc.\n\nPrairies â Of the prairies, Buffalo Head (at the eastern edge of which is the town of Buffalo) is the most extensive. It lies in the west central part of Dallas and the east central part of Polk County. Fifteen Mile Prairie lies in the extreme northern part of Dallas and the southern part of Hickory County, and has an area of about sixteen square miles in the former. Round Prairie, on which the village of Lewisburg is located, lies in Grant Township, nine miles northwest from Buffalo, and has an area of about four square miles. Lead Mine Prairie lies in Miller Township, in the northeastern part of the county, and contains about four sections of land. Four Mile Prairie lies a few miles north of Buffalo, in Grant and Benton Townships, and comprises about fifteen sections of land. Beckner Prairie, comprising between one and two sections of land, lies on the Lebanon road, about twelve miles east of Buffalo. OâBannon Prairie lies in the south central portion of the county, and has an area of about fifteen sections of land. High Prairie lies in the southwestern part of the county, and consists of nearly four sections of land. There is also a small prairie in the extreme southeastern corner of the county, and a number of others are scattered throughout the county, all of which are estimated to comprise about one-fourth of its area.\n\nSoil â The soil of the prairies and the bottoms along the streams are rich and exceedingly fertile; the former is composed mostly of vegetable mould, and the latter of vegetable mould and alluvial deposits, and both have a clay subsoil. The next soil in quality is on the timbered uplands, where the largest timber grows, and the poorest soil is found on what is commonly called the âpost oak flats.â This latter soil has an ashen hue, and is said to be well adapted to the production of the finest grades of tobacco, but not equal to the other soils in the production of grain.\n\nProductions â In general the agricultural productions of the county are corn, wheat, oats, rye, sorghum, potatoes, all kinds of vegetables, the grasses and tobacco. A little cotton is also raised. Dallas County, on account of its altitude and mild climate, is well adapted to the cultivation of all the fruits common to this latitude.\n\nDrainage â The county is drained by the Big and Little Niangua Rivers and their tributaries, and Linley Creek, the latter emptying into the Pome-de-Terre River, the waters of all of which flow to the Osage on the north, and thence to the Missouri River. The Big Niangua River enters the county from Webster, on the south, at Section 13, Township 32 north, Range 18 west, and flows thence northwardly and northwesterly to the center of the county; thence eastwardly to within one and a half miles of the eastern boundary; thence in a northerly direction, crossing the boundary line six times in a distance of seven miles, and leaves the county on its northern boundary at Section 2, Township 36 north, Range 18 west. The waters of this stream flow toward all points of the compass, on its serpentine and tortuous route, and in most places along its line the country is extremely uneven and hilly. The principal tributaries of this river on the eastern side are Jones and Deusenberry Creeks, the former of which enters the county from Laclede, on the east, in Section 1, Township 32 north, Range 18 west, and flows thence in a westerly direction to its mouth, and the latter of which also enters the county from Laclede, and flows thence in a westerly direction through the northern part of Washington Township to its junction with the main stream. Greasey Creek, the largest tributary on the Big Niangua on the west side, rises in the southeastern part of Township 32 north, Range 20 west, it being in the southwestern part of the county, and flows in a northwesterly, northerly and northeasterly direction, emptying into the main stream in Section 17, Township 34 north, Range 19 west, at a point about three miles east-northeast of Buffalo. Bryant and Mill Creeks have their sources, route and outlet in Miller Township, and are tributaries of the Big Niangua on its west side. There are also many smaller tributaries of this river not here mentioned.\n\nThe Little Niangua River rises in the eastern part of Grant Township, and flows thence in a northeasterly course for a distance of about five miles, thence in a northwesterly direction, and leaves the county on its northern boundary, near the northeast corner of Township 36 north, Range 20 west. It has several tributaries, the two largest being on the west side. The west central part of the county is drained by Linley Creek, which rises in the southwest corner of the civil township of Buffalo, and flows northwardly to near the northwest corner thereof, and then turns to the west, and flows through portions of Polk and Hickory Counties to its confluence with the Pome-de-Terre River. This creek has several tributaries in Dallas County. On the whole, the county is well drained. In all parts of it excellent springs abound, the most noted of which is Bennettâs Spring, on Section 1, Township 34 north, Range 18 west, and which, under the impression that it was on the Laclede County side of the line, has been mentioned in connection with the description of that county. The quantity of water that flows from this spring would be ample to supply either of the cities of Chicago or St. Louis. Next in size is Big Sweet Spring, lower down on the Niangua, its flow of water being only equal to about one-half as much as that of Bennettâs. Elixir Spring, noted for the medicinal qualities of its water, is situated in the northeastern part of Township 36 north, Range 20 west. Excelsior Spring, also noted for the medicinal quality of its water, is situated near Jaques (or Jakes) Creek, in the northern part of Township 35 north, Range 18 west. Big Black Walnut Spring, the water of which is unexcelled for its beauty and purity, is found on the northwest quarter of the southwest quarter of Section 15, Township 34 north, Range 18 west. Unlike most springs, its supply of water does not materially change in wet and dry seasons.\n\nGeology â The geology of Dallas County corresponds very closely with that of Laclede and Camden Counties â the visible rock formation being, to all appearances, identically the same. Being of the magnesian limestone, it is very cavernous, and many caves about within the county, especially in the rocky bluffs along the larger streams. The most attractive and most extensive cave within the county is the one known as the McKee Cave, situated in the bluff on the south side of the Big Niangua, on the northeast quarter of Section 9, Township 34 north, Range 18 west. The main branch or avenue of this cave has been explored for a distance of about a fourth of a mile, without coming to its end. In the cave are found many stalactites, stalagmites, pools of water and other curious natural objects of great beauty. The cave has never been explored to its full extent. Another cave, known as the Great Salt Petre Cave, lies on the opposite side of the Big Niangua, and about a mile below the McKee Cave. It is not so attractive or extensive, but tradition says that in an early day certain parties manufactured counterfeit money in the cave, meanwhile professing to manufacture saltpetre there, as a blind to cover their real occupation â hence the name, Great Salt Petre Cave. The cave is believed to extend into the bluff about 300 yards. Though a team can be driven to its mouth, it is well hidden in the timber and hills. The first of these caves is noted for its extent and beauty, the latter for its traditional history, as a hidden workshop of the early counterfeiters of this and adjoining counties. Many other caves, of smaller dimensions, are found in the county.\n\nMounds â In the comparatively level country, a few miles southwest from Buffalo, and within plain view of the place, are three large mound-like hills of considerable elevation, known as the Blue Mounds. In size they are very extensive, the most western one, the Brushy Mound, comprising an area of from 200 to 300 acres of land. These mounds lie on and near the line between Dallas and Polk Counties, and are visible to the naked eye for many miles from all directions, and from their summits an unlimited view of the surrounding country is obtained.\n\nMineral Resources â Lead and zinc have been found in several places within the county, and while it is believed that these minerals abound in abundance they have never been developed to any considerable extent. The Rambo mines, twelve miles northeast from Buffalo, were discovered in 1868, and worked for a few years, and then abandoned. Iron ore has also been discovered near Buffalo, and coal has been found in different localities, and building stone is abundant. The county has always been too far from lines of transportation to make it profitable to develop its mineral resources.\n\nOrigin of Names â Niangua, pronounced by some Ne-on-go, is from an Indian phrase, âI wonât go away,â or perhaps from his manner of expressing his objection to go-on, or to on-go, and leave his native place. Greasey Creek derived its name from the following circumstances: When the settlement of the country began, an old man brought a load of bacon, from the older settlements along the Mississippi, to sell to the settlers here, and in crossing the stream his wagon was turned over in the water and some of the bacon was swept away â hence the name Greasey Creek. Linley Creek derived its name from the fact that a man by the name of Linley, who was driving some hogs from near Boonville, Mo., across the country to sell to the settlers at Springfield, became âsnowed in,â and had to remain in camp several days near the stream. Buffalo Head Prairie derives its name from the fact that about the year 1833, or perhaps a little earlier, Mark Reynolds, grandfather of Mark L. Reynolds, the present proprietor of the Buffalo Nurseries, found a stake standing on one of the Blue Mounds, which had been placed there by some early settler or hunter, and on this stake he (Reynolds) placed the skeleton of a buffaloâs head which lay near by. And from this circumstance he named the prairie âBuffalo Head,â which name it still retains. This stake and buffalo head became a noted land-mark or guide for hunters, travelers and immigrants. High Prairie was so named on account of the high mound which stands in its center. Round Prairie was so called because of its circular shape. Four Mile and Fifteen Mile Prairies take their names from the distance traveled in crossing them.\n\nThese facts, pertaining to the origin of names, have been given by Mr. M.L. Reynolds, who asserts that he has âtime and againâ heard them related by his grandfather to subsequent settlers of the county. The facts are also verified by records in possession of the Reynolds family.\n\nEarly Settlement\n\nFirst Settler â From the best information obtainable it is evident that Mark Reynolds, father of R.D. Reynolds, deceased, and grandfather of M.L. Reynolds, proprietor of the Buffalo Nurseries, was the first settler of the territory now embraced in Dallas County. In the year 1831 Mr. Reynolds moved with his family from a place near Nashville, Tenn., and settled on a claim on the Pome-de-Terre River, some two miles north of the present village of Pleasant Hope, in what is now Polk County, Mo. He lived there one year, then moved onto Buffalo Head Prairie, and settled and improved a claim northwest of the Blue Mounds, near A. Shepardâs present farm. After living here one year he sold his claim to Bracket Davidson, grandfather of Judge J.H. Davidson, and moved upon, settled and improved the farm, three miles west of Buffalo, which afterward became the homestead of the late R.D. Reynolds, and which is now known as the Buffalo Nurseries, owned by M.L. Reynolds. This latter settlement, made in 1833, was the first one in what is now Dallas County.\n\nOther Settlers â In an extended section of country, embracing what is now Dallas and Polk Counties, only four settlers preceded Mark Reynolds, and they all settled in the territory of Polk County, as follows: Bazel Rose, on a place south of Halfway, at or near where Mr. Redd now lives; William Owens, on the south side of the prairie, on the Reeves Cowden farm; Robert Barclay, on the place where Robert Summers now lives, and Richard Brown, on the Judge Plummer place, on Hominy Creek. The first settlers immediately succeeding Mr. Reynolds cannot now be named in the order of their arrivals, but among them were the Evans, Randleman and Williams families, from Kentucky. In October, 1837, Richard Wilkinson, Sr., and his family, consisting of five sons and five daughters, together with the wives of his sons John and Ezekiel, and his son-in-law, David Wright, came in wagons from Hocking County, Ohio. The father settled about three miles west, the sons, John and Ezekiel, seven miles southwest, and the son-in-law, David Wright, four miles west-southwest of the present site of Buffalo.\n\nFollowing is a list of the names and locations of nearly all of the settlers of the territory of Dallas County upon or soon after the arrival of the Wilkinson family, in 1837: William E. Williams lived on the William L. Morrow place, one and a half miles north of Buffalo. Martin Randleman lived where Richard Wilkinson, Jr., now lives, in the suburbs of Buffalo, and had previously built a portion of the house in which Mr. Wilkinson now resides. Michael Randleman lived where A.A. Ramsey now lives, one-half mile north of Buffalo, and Jacob Randleman one mile south, on the Bennett place. The Randlemans were brothers. John F. Norton lived where Israel Olinger now lives, and Joseph Wilcox where William Barnes resides â the former two and the latter one and a half miles northwest from Buffalo. William Montgomery and family lived where his son John now resides, on the Little Niangua, near the north line of the county. Hardin Paine lived about fourteen miles north and Frank Wisdom seven miles north of the site of Buffalo. Elijah Yeager, a pioneer Methodist minister, who preached extensively to the early settlers, lived on Fifteen Mile Prairie. John Brashear lived on Linley Creek; James Jump six to eight miles northwest of the site of Buffalo, and a Mr. Carter on the northwest corner of Buffalo Head Prairie. Mark Reynolds lived on the place where he settled, before mentioned. Peter Self and Eaton Tatum, sons-in-law of Reynolds, both lived in the same neighborhood, the latter on the place bought of him, and settled by Richard Wilkinson, Sr. Bracket Davidson lived seven miles south of Buffalo, and Dr. Pritchard in the same neighborhood.\n\nGrant McDowell lived on what is now known as the Widow Johnson place, five or six miles southwest of Buffalo. Charles Davis and brothers lived about fifteen and George W. Atterberry twelve miles south of the site of Buffalo. The Jamison family, Moses Bennett, Nathaniel Wollard (or Woolard), William and Samuel Latimer and Thomas and William Marlin all lived on the upper Big Niangua.* Thomas and Jacob Riddles also lived on the Big Niangua, near the Riddle Mill, about eight miles southeast of Buffalo. Jesse Engel and Cornelius Snead lived on the same stream, about five miles southeast of Buffalo. William Gore and Elias Williams lived on Greasy Creek, southeast of the site of Buffalo. A brother of the latter kept a small store where the Williamses settled, about one and a half miles from Buffalo. Jason Lemmons lived nearly a mile and John Evans two miles south of Buffalo. A Mr. Sweeney lived on the lower Big Niangua, about five miles from the site of Buffalo, and Abram Stow still lower down on the river. (*That part of the river south of Buffalo.)\n\nPeter Bennett also lived on the lower Big Niangua, near the famous Bennettâs Spring. All of the foregoing, as well as others whose names and location cannot now be conveniently obtained, settled between the time that Reynolds made the first settlement within the present county limits and the arrival of the Wilkinson family, in the fall of 1837, or perhaps a little later. Nearly all of these settlers, aside from the Wilkinson family and connections, came from the States of Tennessee and Kentucky.\n\nLater Early Settlers â In 1838 enough families to form a respectable colony followed the Wilkinsons from Ohio, and then immigrants began to arrive from several other Eastern and Southeastern States. Among those coming from Ohio were the Haines, Cox, Gregg and Vanderford families. Asa Vanderford, and his father, Eli, in the fall of 1838, settled on the place where he has ever since resided, two miles southwest of Buffalo. In the fall of the same year, or spring of the following, William Stanley and his family, including his sons James B., Robert R. and Albert S., and his brother, Archibald Stanley, and his family, came in wagons from Indiana, and settled near Buffalo, which then contained only two little log cabins â one on the east and the other on the west side of what is now the public square. Also in 1838 George Davidson came from Maury County, Tenn., and settled in that part of the county now known as Benton Township, and afterward moved to Jackson Township. He was a physician, and practiced his profession until his death in 1887. In 1839 A.C. Austin and family came from North Carolina, and settled in what is now Jackson Township, in Dallas County. In the year 1840 James Jones came from Sangamon County, Ill., and settled on the farm now owned by John T. Jones. The same year Thomas H. Fullerton and family moved from Polk County, Mo., to the territory now embraced in Dallas County, and remained here until his death, which occurred in 1862. He was formerly from Tennessee. Also that year John Haymes came from Virginia, and settled in that part of the county now known as Washington Township, and afterward moved to Laclede County. The following year James W. George and family came from Tennessee, and settled in the same part of the county. In 1842 Robert Cowden and family came from Georgia, and settled on the farm where his son, William A. Cowden, now lives. In 1846 Daniel Beckner and family came from Virginia, and settled near the present village of Long Lane. In 1844 William Lovan and family moved from Tennessee to Greene County, Mo., and in September, 1847, he removed with his family to Buffalo, in Dallas County. He was the father of the Lovan brothers, saddle and harness merchants, now of Buffalo.\n\nMany other settlers came in during the forties and fifties, and at this writing they still continue to come. Dr. John McCall, a native of South Carolina, settled on Four Mile Prairie in 1851. He has practiced medicine over sixty years, and is the oldest physician in Dallas County.\n\nFirst Land Entries â In general, before the public lands were surveyed and put into market, the early settlers exercised the right of squatter sovereignty. A few, however, among whom were Mark Reynolds, Martin Randleman, James Coyle, David J. Long, Moses Bennett and Richard Riddles, took up their lands upon the pre-emption law, proved up and paid for them, and had their titles confirmed at the land office a few weeks before the lands became subject to entry. This makes it appear on the plat book, on file in the county clerkâs office, that the first land entries were made in the fall of 1838. The first land sales, however, began at the land office at Springfield, on January 1, 1839, after the paid-up pre-empted lands had been marked on the public land records as not subject to entry. The âsquatters,â who improved their lands before it was possible to obtain titles to them, were on the alert at the proper time to prevent new settlers or speculators from entering their lands, and thus dispossessing them and depriving them of the benefit of their improvements. To this end they organized for mutual protection, and never allowed one of their number to be dispossessed of the land on which he had actually settled and made improvements. Before the land sales opened a number of the âsquattersâ went to Springfield, so as to be ready at the opening sale to look out for their own and their neighborsâ rights, and if a man did succeed in entering a squatterâs claim he was never allowed to occupy it. The lands lying south of the township line between Townships 34 and 35 north were subject to entry at the Springfield land office, and those north of that line at the Boonville land office.\n\nTo give a more extended list of the first settlers of the county, the following list of names of individuals who made the first land entries in the several congressional townships of the county has been compiled from the records, taking only those who became actual settlers, and omitting those already mentioned:\n\nTownship 31, Range 20 â First entries made in 1844, 1845 and 1846, by John Marshall, Benjamin T. Potter, Millberry Russell, Brannock Wilkinson, Hugh C. Williamson, John M. Donnell, David Wilson and Williamson Crawford.\n\nTownship 32, Range 18 â First entries made from 1846 to 1857, by James W. Tindle, John S. Barrett, John H. Holloway and Robert Fulton.\n\nTownship 32, Range 19 â First entries made in 1839, by Andrew Mehaffy, Abner H. Henson, George W. Henson, William Richardson and Hiram Patterson; during the forties, by Gersham B. Jones, Reuben H. Lackey and William Henson; from 1850 to 1857, by Cornelius Gann, Robert O. Randles, William McGee, John Carter, Robert Highfill, Thomas R. Patterson and Goalson Step.\n\nTownship 32, Range 20 â Entries made in 1839 were by James R. Danforth, Daniel D. Berry, Josiah Smith, Elias Powell, John N. Jenkins, Henry W. Norton, Benj. Coyle, Thomas Potter and John Alsup; in 1840, by Montgomery E. Allen and George W. Mallard. Nearly one-half of all the lands in this township were entered in the year 1857.\n\nTownship 33, Range 18 â First entries, in 1848 and 1849, were made by Frederick Hull, Asbury Chapman, William Gammon, John Miller and Edmund Howerton. The most of the lands in this township have been entered since the Civil War.\n\nTownship 33, Range 19 â Entries were made in 1839 by Samuel W. Evans, Henry Evans and Abner Henson, and other settlers already named, and during the forties by Thomas Martin, William Starke, Samuel Gardner, George Hill, Thomas Hill and William Proctor.\n\nTownship 33, Range 20 â Entries were made in 1839 by Eli Vanderford, father of Asa Vanderford, Stanley Burnes, Peter Haines, Jesse Vanderford, James B. Jones, Samuel Haines, John Gordon and Daniel D. Berry; in 1840, by John Cooksey and Jesse Hendrickson; in 1848, by William Gregg; in 1849, by Martin Rice and James W. Gardner.\n\nTownship 34, Range 18 â The first entry in this township seems to have been made in 1848, by Abraham Stow; the next in 1849, by James W. Burton; the next in 1854, by W.B. Newton and Levi L. Beckner, and the next in 1855, by William W. Miller. Only a small portion of this township was entered before the Civil War.\n\nTownship 34, Range 19 â The first entries were made in 1845, by William W. Gore and John L. Martin, and in 1848 by Isaac Hayes, Pleasant C. Dame and Jesse Hendrickson. Only a few tracts were entered prior to 1850, and fully one-half of all have been entered since the Civil War. A considerable portion of the township is still vacant.\n\nTownship 34, Range 20 â First entries were made in 1849, by William Franklin, William Adams, Sr., the Paines, Williamses, Harrald Bray, Samuel J. Crawford, Joseph Wilcox, the Randlemans and others.\n\nTownship 35, Range 18 â The Big Niangua traverses the eastern part of this township. The country is very hilly, and unsuitable for cultivation except the bottoms along the streams. The first entries were made along the Big Niangua in 1850. More than half the township is yet subject to entry. A few entries were also made in 1850, in the southwest corner of the township.\n\nTownship 35, Range 19 â The first entries were made in 1843 and 1844, by the Paines, and from then to 1854 entries were made by Samuel Farris, Jacob H. Rambo, Abel Richardson, Alfred B. Maddux, Josiah B. Hayes, Thomas Hayes, William F. Spillman, John Hatfield, Dr. John McCall, John B. Jones and D. Cook.\n\nTownship 35, Range 20 â First entries were made in 1840, by James A. Gillespie, John F. Marsh, Samuel Richardson, Sr., James Marsh, James W. Wisdom, Noah Bray, Solomon Parker, William S. Marsh and John M. Marsh; the next, in the forties, by Lewis Richardson, Lewis H. Marsh, Sterling Linsley, James P. Munday, George W. Jones, John Ethridge, James Marsh, John and James Tucker, Mary L. Inks, William Clarke, Samuel L. Huffman and William Hughes.\n\nTownship 36, Range 18 â This township is also traversed by the Big Niangua; is very hilly and mostly unsuitable for cultivation. The first entries were made in 1850, along the river. Much of the land is yet subject to entry.\n\nTownship 36, Range 19 â William Montgomery made the first entry in 1840, the only one made prior to 1850, and a great many were made during the fifties. There is yet some vacant land.\n\nTownship 36, Range 20 â First entries were made in 1840, by Joseph Hayes, George W. Nelson, Edward Vandever and James Jones; the next, in 1841, by Michael Bowers, James Ingles, Elijah F. Yeager and Jacob Reaser. Other entries were made during the forties by Peter Hunt, Peachey K. Snapp and Benj. F. Hayes.\n\nIt must be remembered that the date of the entry of land, except in a few instances, does not correspond with the date of the purchaserâs settlement in the county, for the reason, as previously stated, that the first settlers, especially those who settled in the Springfield land district prior to 1839, and those who settled in the Boonville district prior to 1840, occupied their lands several years before they became subject to entry, and many subsequent settlers squatted upon their lands, improved and occupied them for years before they were able to purchase them. Meanwhile they were protected from speculators and âjumpers of claimsâ by the combined efforts of the early settlers. By reference to dates, it will be observed that that portion of Dallas County belonging to the Springfield land district became settled earlier and faster than that portion belonging to the Boonville district; also that a great many entries were made, for reasons already stated, during the first year after the lands came into market, after which, for many years, the annual entries were very few, being made only in the ratio as the settlements increased.\n\nWhen the first settlers came, they found the country a vast wilderness, inhabited by wild animals and frequented by the Indians, and in place of roads nothing but Indian trails or paths. Wild game and wild honey were abundant. The nearest and only trading point was Springfield, which was then composed of only one small country store and a blacksmith shop. It is said that John Evans then thought it no great hardship to go nearly to Springfield to grind his ax, and quite there (thirty-three miles) to buy a whetstone.\n\nWild Animals and Wild Fowl â When the settlement of the territory of Dallas County began, in 1833, it was full of certain wild animals and wild fowl, such as elk, deer, wolves, panthers, catamounts, wildcats, and many other and smaller animals, and wild turkeys, ducks, geese, and the smaller birds common in this latitude. There were also some bears and a few straggling buffaloes. The buffaloes fled to the westward, and soon became extinct in this part of the country. The bears, not disposed to flee from their native haunts, remained until finally they have become practically extinct by extermination. And though a war of extermination has been waged against the wolves and the savage animals of the cat kind, a few of them still remain in the unsettled portions of the country. Some of the small animals still exist in considerable numbers. Of the wild turkeys and ducks, once so abundant, enough remain to amuse the hunters. The elk have disappeared, but deer are found to such an extent that venison is not considered a very great rarity. In the winter season rabbits and quails are the kinds of game now mostly acquired by the hunters. The native small birds remain in great numbers.\n\nIndians â Before the territory composing Dallas County was settled by the whites it was inhabited by the same tribes of Indians that occupied the territory of Laclede, Camden and other counties in this portion of the State. Under treaties with the United States Government they had abandoned this part of the country before its settlement began, but they still continued to return annually on hunting excursions for a number of years, much to the annoyance of the settlers, though they were not hostile. The annoyance consisted of some trifling depredations committed by the Indians, and the constant fear exercised, especially by the women and children.\n\nCounty Organization\n\nThe Act Forming Niangua County â The original name under which the county of Dallas was organized was Niangua. It was organized in accordance with an act entitled, âAn act to organize counties therein named, and define the boundaries thereof,â approved January 29, 1841, and another act, supplemental thereto, approved February 15, 1841.\n\nThat part of the first act pertaining to this county reads as follows:\n\nSection 16. All that portion of territory within the following described limits, viz.: Beginning at the northeast corner of Greene County; thence west along the northern boundary of Greene County to the range line between Ranges 20 and 21; thence north with said range line to the township line dividing Townships 36 and 37; thence east on said township line to the range line dividing Ranges 17 and 18; thence south with said range line to the place of beginning, is hereby created a separate and distinct county, to be called and known by the name of the county of Niangua.\n\nThe supplemental act reads as follows:\n\nSection 1. That an assessor shall be appointed in each county organized at this session of the Legislature, by the county court of the respective counties, and said assessors shall not be required to make a return of their tax books till the first day of August next.\n\nSec. 2. That said county court shall meet on the first Monday of March next, and at that term of court, or at some subsequent term to be holden during said month, shall make said appointment. ****\n\nSec. 5. That the county courts of said counties may respectively appoint some competent person county surveyor, who shall continue in office until the first Monday of August next, and until a surveyor is duly elected and qualified.\n\nSec. 6. An election shall be held for surveyors in said counties on the first Monday of August next, and the persons elected shall hold their office until the next general election for surveyors, and until their successors are duly elected and qualified.\n\nThis act shall take effect from its passage.\n\nFirst Session of County Court â In accordance with the foregoing, the first county court justices, who were, according to the best recollection of surviving old settlers, Thomas Proctor, Peter Haynes and Thomas Marlan, met on the first Monday of March, 1841, in the log school-house which stood on the ridge near the present Buffalo cemetery, situated directly east of and adjoining the town, and there organized the county court and completed the organization of Dallas County. The early records of the county having all been destroyed, it is impossible to give the action of the county court at its first or subsequent sessions until the year 1867, since which time the records have been preserved. One of the first duties of the county court, as shown by the supplemental act aforesaid, was the appointment of an assessor, and Mark Reynolds was either the first assessor appointed or the first one elected at the general county election in 1842; in either case, he held that office eighteen years in succession.\n\nOther business of the county court, transacted at its early sessions, consisted of acting upon petitions for county roads, appointing commissioners to view and mark out the routes, establishing the same and providing for their opening, transacting probate business, levying taxes and superintending the collection and disbursements thereof, examining and approving reports of county officers, etc.\n\nChange of Name â The name of the county, Niangua, being a little difficult to spell and write, thereby giving some trouble in the transmission of the mails, it became desirable to change it to a more convenient one. Accordingly, on application to the Legislature, it was changed, December 10, 1844, to that of Dallas, in honor of Vice-President Dallas of the United States. This was certainly a wise change, for âDallas,â though perhaps not so poetical, is far preferable to âNianguaâ for the name of a county, it being much easier to write and pronounce.\n\nChange of County Boundary â The first change of the original boundary lines of the county took place in accordance with the fifty-fourth section of an act entitled âAn act defining the limits of the several counties in this State,â approved March 28, 1845. The section reads as follows:\n\nSection 54. Dallas â Beginning at the southeast corner of Section 12, Township 31, Range 18; thence west with the range line between Ranges 20 and 21; thence north to the township line dividing Townships 36 and 37; thence east to the range line dividing Ranges 17 and 18; thence south to the place of beginning.\n\nThis is substantially the same as the original description, but more definite. The county boundaries remained the same until changed in accordance with an act entitled âAn act to define the boundaries of Dallas, Webster, Greene, Wright and Ozark Counties, and for other purposes,â approved December 7, 1855. The act consisted of two sections, the first of which reads as follows:\n\nSection 1. That Dallas County be hereafter bounded as follows, viz.: Beginning at the southeast corner of Section 13, Township 32 and Range 18; thence west to the range line dividing Ranges 19 and 20; thence south to the southeast corner of Section 12, in Township 31, Range 20; thence west to the range line dividing Ranges 20 and 21; thence north to the township line dividing Townships 36 and 37; thence east to the range line dividing Ranges 17 and 18; thence south to the place of beginning.\n\nUnder this last description the boundaries of the county have ever since and still remain. The last act only changed the southern boundary of the county by setting off to Webster County all that part formerly included in Dallas lying south of the third tier of sections, from the north, in Township 32 and Ranges 18 and 19. No other changes were made in the boundary as it formerly existed.\n\nThere is an impression prevailing that, after the county was first organized, a strip on the west side thereof, three miles in width, was set off and attached to Polk County. This, however, was not the case, for the reason that the act of the Legislature, creating the county of Niangua, and every subsequent act defining the boundary between Polk and Dallas Counties, describes it precisely on the same route as it was described in the original act creating Niangua, now Dallas, County. It was the desire of the people of this portion of the original county of Polk to have the western line of the new county (Niangua) located three miles west of where it was actually placed, and finding they were disappointed, they made a subsequent effort to have the line moved three miles farther west, but failed in the project.\n\nMunicipal Townships â Immediately after the county was organized it was subdivided by the county court into six municipal townships, viz.: Miller, Green, Benton, Jasper, Washington and Jackson, all having the same location as at present, with the exception of Green, which has since been divided into two townships, named, respectively, Lincoln and Grant. At the May term, 1868, of the county court, the townships of Lincoln and Grant were formed and described as follows:\n\nLincoln Township â Commencing on the county line of Polk County, on the township line between Townships 35 and 36; thence east to the middle of Range 19; thence north to the Camden County line; thence west to the northwest corner of the county; thence south to the place of beginning. Voting place, Urbana.\n\nGrant Township â Commencing at the northwest corner of Section 6, Township 35, Range 20; thence south to the southwest corner of Section 31, Township 35, Range 20; thence east on the township line to the middle of Range 19; thence north to the township line dividing Townships 35 and 36; thence west on said township line to the place of beginning. Voting place, Louisburg.\n\nAt the same time, on account of the records having been lost, all the other civil townships of the county were re-bounded, and the congressional townships were re-numbered as follows: No. 1, Township 36, Range 18; No. 2, Township 36, Range 19; No. 3, Township 36, Range 20; No. 4, Township 35, Range 20; No. 5, Township 35, Range 19; No. 6, Township 35, Range 18; No. 7, Township 34, Range 18; No. 8, Township 34, Range 19; No. 9, Township 34, Range 20; No. 10, Township 33, Range 20; No. 11, Township 33, Range 19; No. 12, Township 33, Range 18; No. 13, Township 32, Range 18; No. 14, Township 30, Range 20.\n\nThe description of the boundary lines of the civil townships as given on this occasion, aside from Lincoln and Grant, are here omitted, for the reason that afterward, on August 4, 1875, the county court established the boundaries of all of these townships as follows:\n\nMiller Township â Commencing at the northeast corner of Section 1, Township 36, Range 18; thence west to the northwest corner of Section 3, Township 36, Range 19; thence due south to the southwest corner of Section 15, Township 35, Range 19; thence east to the southeast corner of Section 13, Township 35, Range 18; thence north to the place of beginning.\n\nLincoln Township â Commencing at the northeast corner of Section 4, Township 36, Range 19; thence west to the northwest corner of Section 6, Township 36, Range 20; thence south to the southwest corner of Section 31, Township 36, Range 20; thence east to the southeast corner of Section 33, Township 36, Range 19; thence north to the place of beginning.\n\nGrant Township â Commencing at the northeast corner of Section 4, Township 35, Range 19; thence west to the northwest corner of Section 6, Township 35, Range 20; thence south to the southwest corner of Section 31, Township 35, Range 20; thence east to the southeast corner of Section 33, Township 35, Range 19; thence north to the place of beginning.\n\nJasper Township â Commencing at the northeast corner of Section 24, Township 35, Range 18; thence west to the northwest corner of Section 22, Township 35, Range 19; thence south to the southwest corner of Section 34, Township 34, Range 19; thence east to the southeast corner of Section 36, Township 34, Range 18; thence north to the place of beginning.\n\nBenton Township â Commencing at the northeast corner of Section 4, Township 34, Range 19; thence west to the northwest corner of Section 6, Township 34, Range 20; thence south to the southwest corner of Section 18, Township 33, Range 20; thence east to the southeast corner of Section 16, Township 33, Range 19; thence north to the place of beginning.\n\nJackson Township â Commencing at the northeast corner of Section 21, Township 33, Range 19; thence west to the northwest corner of Section 19, Township 33, Range 20; thence south to the southwest corner of Section 7, Township 31, Range 20; thence east to the southeast corner of Section 12, Township 31, Range 20; thence north to the southwest corner of Section 28, Range 32, Range 19; thence east to the southeast corner of Section 16, Township 32, Range 19; thence north to the place of beginning.\n\nWashington Township â Commencing at the northeast corner of Section 1, Township 33, Range 18; thence west to the northwest corner of Section 3, Township 33, Range 19; thence south to the southwest corner of Section 15, Township 32, Range 19; thence east to the southeast corner of Section 13, Township 32, Range 18; thence north to the place of beginning.\n\nIn re-bounding the municipal townships on this occasion, the court, in some instances, changed the lines from where they had formerly and originally existed, but established them just as they stand at this writing, and the same as they are shown on the map of Dallas County published in 1886 by A.B. Lovan, Esq., of Buffalo.\n\nPublic Buildings\n\nCourt-House â The first court-house in Dallas County was built where the present one stands, in 1846-47, by Levi Beckner. It was a small, two-story brick structure, with the courtroom on the first floor and the county offices on the second, and continued to be used for court and county purposes until it was destroyed during the Civil War. During the war period the lower story of the house was used a part of the time by the Union Home Guards as a rendezvous and fortress. On the 18th day of October, 1863, a body of Confederate troops entered the town, surrounded the court-house, captured the inmates and burned it to the ground. Some of the records had been or were taken out and saved. The old Methodist Church was then utilized as the court-house, and it was burned down by unknown parties on July 30, 1864. A frame business building which stood on the west side of the public square was afterward occupied as a court-house until September 3, 1867, when it was also burned by unknown parties. In the burning of the second house the records were all destroyed, and by some it was suspected that the house was set on fire by certain parties in anticipation of getting a contract to reproduce information and replace the public records. It was also conjectured that perhaps this and the last house were destroyed for the purpose of extinguishing certain indictments against criminals.\n\nAfter the last building was destroyed the county court met in the district school-house in Buffalo, and in February, 1886, it appropriated $15,000 for the purpose of building a new court-house. Soon thereafter a contract was let to A.E. Dye for the construction of the building, for the sum of $16,500, and a subsequent contract was made with him for the construction of a cupola thereon, for an additional $1,000. This house, which is the present court-house, was erected by the contractor mentioned, in 1868-69. It was designed by Dr. E. Hovey, who was the county superintendent of public buildings at that time. It is a substantial brick building, set upon a rock foundation, 44x60 feet in size, two stories in height, and a handsome cupola in the center on top. The first story contains the county offices, hall and stairs, and the second the court and jury rooms and stairs to the cupola. The offices are supplied with fire-proof vaults for the public records, and the whole building has a modern architectural appearance. A grand view of the surrounding country is obtained from the cupola.\n\nJail â The first and present county jail was built in the winter of 1842 and 1843 by Caleb Williams, at a cost to the county of about $400. It has two walls, made of square timbers one foot in thickness, the timbers lying in a horizontal position, and a space of several inches between these walls is filled with rocks firmly pounded in. The floor and ceiling is also made of squared timbers, the surface of which, together with the interior surface of the walls, is lined with planks, and the planks are driven full of nails â a very substantial jail, though it is cheap and old-fashioned. It stands near the northwest corner of the public square. These constitute all the public buildings of the county, no poor house having ever been erected, the paupers having always been cared for by appropriations from the county treasury. Mr. Asa Vanderford, who is living at this writing near Buffalo, assisted in the construction of the jail.\n\nPublic Lands\n\nFrench and Spanish Possession â After certain discoveries had been made by French and Spanish explorers, Robert de La Salle, in April, 1682, took formal possession of the country along the Mississippi River, in the name of Louis XIV, the reigning king of France, in whose honor he named it Louisiana. This region thus acquired by the French embraced territory on both sides of the Mississippi, and, comprising rather indefinite limits, included the present States of Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee, Arkansas and Missouri. France continued in possession of this territory until the 3rd of November, 1762, when she ceded to Spain all that portion of it lying west of the Mississippi, and to Great Britain all that portion lying east thereof. Spain, however, did not take actual possession of her part of the territory until August 27, 1769, when County OâRiley landed at New Orleans with an armed force and took formal possession. That part of Louisiana lying west of the Mississippi then remained under the control of Spain until 1801, when it was retroceded by Spain to France, and in December, 1803, it was purchased of France by the United States. Hence long before the settlement of the territory of Dallas County began the ownership of the lands composing it vested in the United States.\n\nClassification â The lands have been classified as Congress, school, swamp or overflowed, agricultural college and railroad. The Congress lands, comprising the great bulk of all the lands, are those made subject to entry at the United States land offices, and are patented directly by the General Government to the individual purchasers. The school lands consist of the sixteenth section, or its equivalent, of every congressional township, the same having been donated by the General Government to the State, to be sold by the State, the proceeds arising therefrom to constitute a perpetual or permanent fund, to be loaned for the benefit or support of common free schools, the interest thereon only to be appropriated. The swamp or overflowed lands are those selected and conveyed by the United States to the State, under an act of Congress passed September 28, 1850, the same to be sold by the State, and the proceeds therefrom to be used in constructing levees and drains for the purpose of reclaiming them, and the balance, if any, to be used for other purposes. The agricultural college lands are those donated by Congress to the State for the purpose of maintaining the State Agricultural College. The railroad lands are those which were granted, in 1854, by Congress to the Atlantic & Pacific Railroad Company to assist it in its construction of its road. These lands consisted of all the lands in the alternate sections in each congressional township, not previously entered, within a specified distance from the line of the railroad.\n\nSchool Lands â According to an abstract of the sales of the school lands in Dallas County, dated April 15, 1886, and certified to the county court by Robert McCulloch, register of lands of the State of Missouri, the following numbers of acres had been sold up to that date in each congressional township:\n\nTownship 32, Range 18 480 acres\n\nTownship 32, Range 19 560 acres\n\nTownship 32, Range 20 520 acres\n\nTownship 33, Range 18 600 acres\n\nTownship 33, Range 19 240 acres\n\nTownship 33, Range 20 520 acres\n\nTownship 34, Range 18 80 acres\n\nTownship 34, Range 19 160 acres\n\nTownship 34, Range 20 520 acres\n\nTownship 35, Range 18\n\nTownship 35, Range 19 280 acres\n\nTownship 35, Range 20 520 acres\n\nTownship 36, Range 18 40 acres\n\nTownship 36, Range 19 360 acres\n\nTownship 36, Range 20 440 acres\n\nA few tracts of school lands have been sold since the date of the above abstract, but have not yet been patented to the purchasers, and will not be until final and full payment of the purchase money shall be made.\n\nSwamp or Overflowed Lands â According to an act of the General Assembly of the State of Missouri, entitled âAn act in relation to the Swamp and Overflowed Lands,â approved March 10, 1869, the swamp and overflowed lands within the boundary of Dallas County have been conveyed by the State to the county. Two patent deeds for these lands have been issued, the first one having been executed on the part of the State September 11, 1869, by Gov. Joseph W. McClurg, attested by Francis Rodman, secretary of State, and Joseph H. McGee, register of lands. By this patent the following number of acres in each congressional township were conveyed to the county:\n\nTownship 23, Range 18 1,416.19 acres\n\nTownship 33, Range 18 995.00 acres\n\nTownship 34, Range 18 1,358.94 acres\n\nTownship 32, Range 19 1,564.57 acres\n\nTownship 33, Range 19 925.46 acres\n\nTownship 34, Range 19 240.00 acres\n\nTownship 31, Range 20 484.36 acres\n\nTownship 32, Range 20 2,447.00 acres\n\nTownship 33, Range 20 1,203.60 acres\n\nTownship 34, Range 20 638.78 acres\n\nTownship 35, Range 18 1,750.15 acres\n\nTownship 36, Range 18 1,443.07 acres\n\nTownship 35, Range 19 200.00 acres\n\nTownship 36, Range 19 914.54 acres\n\nTownship 35, Range 20 100.00 acres\n\nTownship 36, Range 20 239.75 acres\n\nAggregate 16,021.41 acres\n\nThe second patent was executed on the part of the State February 13, 1888, by Gov. Albert P. Morehouse, attested by Michael G. McGrath, secretary of State, and Robert McCulloch, register of lands. This patent conveyed lands in the townships as follows:\n\nTownship 35, Range 20 2,073.64 acres\n\nTownship 36, Range 20 600.00 acres\n\nAggregate 2,673.64 acres\n\nGrand total conveyed by both patents 18,695.05 acres\n\nTwo selections of swamp lands in Dallas County were made, the first being recognized by the county and State, but not by the General Government. The second selection was recognized and confirmed to the State by the General Government. Meanwhile the county has sold several tracts included in the first selection, but not included in the patents from the United States, the original owner. This has led to a conflict of titles, which may yet be adjusted by obtaining from the Government a patent for the disputed tracts. By a little stretch of conscience, coupled with a grasping disposition on the part of those selecting the swamp lands, the tracts selected were generally of good quality â so good that it required no part of the funds arising from their sales to reclaim them and render them fit for cultivation â that being the object for which they were donated by the General Government. After paying the expenses of making the selection of the lands and securing their confirmation, the county has turned the proceeds arising from their sales over to the school fund.\n\nThe Agricultural College Lands have been used for the purpose for which they were donated. According to Campbellâs Gazetteer of Missouri the Atlantic & Pacific Railroad Company had in 1875 about 12,000 acres of land in Dallas County, a portion of which has been sold, and a portion of which still remains for sale, cheap, and on easy terms, by the St. Louis & San Francisco Railroad Company, successor to the Atlantic & Pacific Railroad Company.\n\nAgriculture, Live Stock, Statistics, Etc.\n\nAccording to the United States census for the year 1880, Dallas County contained 1,414 farms and 67,001 acres of improved lands.* The value of the farms, including land, fences and buildings, was given at $1,079,713; the farm improvements at $61,948; the live stock at $359,016; the cost of building and repairing fences at $15,313, and the estimated value of all farm productions, for the year 1879, at $306,076. The vegetable productions for the year 1879 were given as follows: Indian corn, 726,040 bushels; oats, 116,914 bushels; wheat, 82,696 bushels; rye, 877 bushels; buckwheat, 142 bushels; hay, 2,454 tons; Irish potatoes, 14,219 bushels; sweet potatoes, 3,697 bushels; tobacco, 11,219 pounds. (*Comparing the number of acres of improved lands with the whole area of the county, 347,520 acres, shows that less than 20 per cent was improved in 1880.)\n\nThe following table shows the number of head of live stock in Dallas County, as given in the census reports of 1880, and as enumerated for taxation in 1889:\n\n1880 - 1889\n\nHorses: 4,005 - 5,435\n\nMules and asses: 1,041 - 1,404\n\nNeat cattle: 9,953 - 16,775\n\nSheep: 11,604 - 8,149\n\nHogs: 24,795 - 15,788\n\nThe number of pounds of wool produced in 1880 was 35,294, but there are no statistics to show the aggregate amount produced in 1889; it must, however, be much less. The increase in the number of horses, mules and cattle has been very good, especially in cattle, but this cannot be said of sheep and hogs. The decrease in hogs can be explained â the number shown in 1880 included all raised, slaughtered, sold and on hand during the year preceding the taking of the census, while the number shown in 1889 includes only those on hand at the time of taking the enumeration of property for taxation. This explanation, however, is not applicable to the sheep, for the sheep were not raised for slaughter, nor for sale in general, but for the production of wool, so there was a large actual decrease in the number of the sheep raised, the cause of which the reader is left to conjecture. It will be interesting, especially to the farmers, to compare the foregoing figures with those of the census of 1890, when it shall be published.\n\nHorticulture â While Dallas County has equal facilities with other counties on the Ozark Range for the cultivation of fruits, its horticultural interests have never been developed to any considerable extent, for the reason that its facilities for transportation have not been equal to counties having railroads passing through them. Recently many farmers, in anticipation of a railroad in the near future, have planted extensive orchards, ranging from 100 to 500 apple trees, and other kinds of fruit in proportion. No doubt the time will soon come when the cultivation of fruit in Dallas County will be very profitable, as nearly all kinds can be grown to perfection and in great quantities.\n\nThe Buffalo Nurseries, situated three miles west of Buffalo, in Dallas County, were established in 1857 by Robert D. Reynolds, father of M.L. Reynolds, the present proprietor. The latter afterward became associated with his father as a partner in the business, and finally purchased his fatherâs interest and became sole proprietor. Mr. Reynolds has 120 acres covered with fruit and ornamental trees, shrubs, plants, roses, etc. He cultivates the trees of the leading varieties of all kinds of fruit that succeed best in this climate. Having had long experience in the business, he is well posted as to the kinds of fruit that thrive best, and can be relied upon to give correct and valuable information on the subject of horticulture. He publishes an illustrative descriptive catalogue of fruit and ornamental trees, grape-vines, small fruits, shrubs, plants, etc., which contains a vast amount of valuable information pertaining to the cultivation of trees, and which ought to be possessed by every amateur horticulturist, and which will be mailed to them upon application. Mr. Reynolds has also a greenhouse in connection with his nursery. The Buffalo Nurseries are among the leading industries of Dallas County. The proprietor gives employment to a large number of hands the whole year round.\n\nFair Associations â About the year 1870 the Dallas County Agricultural and Mechanical Association was organized. It purchased fifteen acres of land, being a part of the present fair grounds, which are located about three-fourths of a mile west southwest of the court-house in Buffalo, and after holding a few annual exhibitions thereon, failed financially and became defunct.\n\nThe Dallas County Fair Association was organized in August, 1883, as a joint stock company, with a capital stock of $750, which has since been about doubled. This association bought the fifteen acres which were purchased by the former association, together with five acres more, so that the grounds now consist of twenty acres, which are fitted up with a floral hall, amphitheater, stables and pens for stock, and a good half-mile race course. The association held its seventh annual fair on the 12th, 13th, 14th and 15th days of September, 1888. The annual exhibitions have been good, and self-sustaining financially. The present officers are: A.A. Ramsey, president; Harry Furth, vice-president; C.F. Johnson, treasurer; N.J. Wollard, secretary. The financial condition of the association is good, and annual exhibitions will continue to be given.\n\nTaxation â The assessed valuation of the taxable property of Dallas County for the year 1880 was as follows: Real estate, $628,413; personal property, $437,335; total, $1,065,748, while for the year 1888 it was assessed as follows: Real estate, $876,699; personal property, $698,023; total, $1,574,722, thus making a gain, from 1880 to 1888, of $248,286 in real and of $260,688 in personal property, or a total gain of $508,974. This shows a very rapid increase of the taxable wealth of the county.\n\nThe abstract of taxes charged on the books for 1888, not including the school taxes, are as follows: State revenue, $3,149.38; State interest tax, $3,149.38; county tax, $7,882.51; road tax, $808.93; total, $14,990.20. To ascertain the whole amount charged, the school taxes must be added to this amount.\n\nPopulation â The population of Dallas County, including both white and colored, as given by the several census reports of the United States, beginning with the year 1850, is as follows, to wit: 1850, 3,648; 1860, 5,892; 1870, 8,383; 1880, 9,263. According to these figures the increase in the population from 1850 to 1860 was 2,244, or a little over 61 per cent; from 1860 to 1870 it was 2,491, or a little over 42 per cent, and from 1870 to 1880 it was 880, or only about 10½ per cent. The rapid increase in the first decade, from 1850 to 1860, was caused principally by immigration, as was also the increase for the second decade. The small increase for the third decade shows that the immigration for that period must have been light, or that the exodus from the county must have been large. For the present decade the immigration has been on the increase, so that it is safe to estimate the population of the county at this writing (February, 1889) at 10,200. The population of each municipal township in the year 1880 was as follows: Benton, 2,384; Grant, 968; Jackson, 1,692; Jasper, 902; Lincoln, 999; Miller, 674; Washington, 1,645; total 9,263. The colored population in 1860, nearly all of whom were slaves, was 115; that of 1870 was 89, a decrease in the ten years of 26. The colored population in 1880 was just the same as that of 1870, neither increasing nor decreasing.\n\nRailroad and Railroad Bonds\n\nIn 1869 a company, known as the Laclede & Fort Scott Railroad Company, proposed to build a railway from Lebanon, in Laclede County, Mo., via Buffalo, in Dallas County, to Fort Scott, in Kansas, on condition that the counties along and on the proposed route should subscribe liberally to the capital stock of the company. Accordingly, the county court of Dallas County, on the 5th of August, 1869, being anxious to encourage the enterprise, and to secure the railroad, with all its consequent advantages, and being prompted by many of the citizen tax payers of the county, took such action in the premises as will appear by the following entry spread upon the record of their proceedings on this occasion:\n\nIt is ordered by the court that $150,000 be and the same is hereby subscribed to the capital stock of the Laclede & Fort Scott Railroad Company, for and on behalf and for the use and benefit of said county of Dallas, upon the following express conditions:\n\n1. The said county of Dallas shall issue 150 bonds, each in the sum of $1000, having twenty years to run, and be payable in twenty years. However, reserving the right of redemption of any or all of said bonds any time after ten years from the date, and bearing 7 per cent interest per annum, which interest shall be paid semi-annually, and said interest to be made payable in the city of New York or Boston, as such place as may be hereafter agreed upon.\n\n2. That said bonds shall not be issued or delivered until such time as said railroad bed or grading shall be completed from Fort Scott, in the State of Kansas, to the western line or boundary of said county of Dallas, ready to receive the cross ties, or that said railroad bed or grading shall be completed from the point where said road intersects the main line of the southwestern branch of the Pacific Railroad, to the eastern line or boundary of said county of Dallas, ready to receive the cross ties.\n\n3. That the proceeds of said bonds shall be expended only in the construction of said railroad within the limits of said Dallas County, and said road shall run through said county and within one-half mile of the court-house, and there shall be a passenger and freight depot built and kept within one-half mile of said court-house, in the town of Buffalo and county of Dallas.\n\n4. The said railroad company, as the agent of said Dallas County, shall negotiate and contract to sell said bonds to the very best advantage that the market will allow, with the express understanding that said Dallas County shall pay said railroad company no percentage as commission on said sales, and none of the costs and expenses incurred in securing and negotiating said sales.\n\n5. The said county court will hereafter appoint an agent, to be known as the county railroad agent, who shall file a bond in the sum of $200,000 before he proceeds to discharge any duties whatever, which said bond shall be conditioned that he shall faithfully discharge his duties as before mentioned, and any further duties that said court shall impose upon him. One of his duties, after the filing of said bond, and the approval of the same, and after said county bonds are negotiated and sold by said railroad company, shall be to take the county bonds to the place where negotiated and sold, and deliver them to the purchaser, and receive the money and proceeds therefor; and another of his duties shall be to pay said railroad company one-fourth of the proceeds of said sales when said railroad company shall have fully completed the said railroad bed or grading to either the western or eastern line or boundary of Dallas County, as above specified; and another one-fourth of the proceeds of said sales when said railroad company shall have fully completed the said railroad bed or grading one-fourth of the distance through said Dallas County; and another one-fourth of the proceeds of said sales when said railroad company shall have fully completed the said railroad bed or grading two-fourths of the distance through said county, and the other and last one-fourth of the proceeds of said sales when said railroad company shall have fully completed the said road bed or grading three-fourths of the way through said county.\n\n6. When the said railroad county agent pays to said railroad company each installment as aforesaid, that is, one-fourth of the proceeds of the sales of said bonds, then it shall be the duty of the railroad company, at the time it receives said payments, or quarterly installments, to issue to and in favor of the said county of Dallas, certificates of stock of said company, to the amount of ($37,500) thirty-seven thousand five hundred dollars, being the full amount of one-fourth of said bonds, it being fully and expressly understood that when the said railroad company has received the full amount of said proceeds of said sales of said bonds, the said Dallas County is to receive from said railroad company certificates of stock, in all to the amount of ($150,000) one hundred and fifty thousand dollars, the full amount of said bonds.\n\n7. And the said county of Dallas reserves the right, that in case this proposition shall not be accepted by the Laclede & Fort Scott Railroad Company within three years, then the county of Dallas may withdraw the above subscription of one hundred and fifty thousand dollars ($150,000) from said railroad company, without any liability to said company, person or persons whatsoever.\n\nAfterward, on the 5th day of April, 1870, upon application of the president and directors of the railroad company, the court modified the foregoing order to some extent, as appears by the following entry then made upon the record of its proceedings:\n\nIt is therefore ordered by the court that G.W. OâBannon be and he is hereby appointed agent of this county, whose duty it shall be to have said bonds lithographed and prepared for the signatures of the officers of the court, and to cast the vote of said county for directors in said company, and to take charge of such other interests of said county in said railroad as may be proper and as may be required by the court.\n\nAnd it is further ordered that said bonds shall only be executed and delivered to said railroad company for work actually done on said road in Dallas County, upon the estimates of the chief engineer and approval of the president of said road, and the order of said agent, whose duty it shall be to deliver said bonds to the order of the president of said road, taking receipts therefor, as the same may be needed to pay for said work as the same progresses in Dallas County.\n\nIt was further ordered by the court that G.W. OâBannon, the agent appointed for the county, should give bond in the sum of $10,000, conditioned for the faithful performance of his duties, and that the bonds should not be executed and used in the construction of the road bed in Dallas County until the county of Laclede should issue her bonds, and that the bonds of the county of Dallas should only be expended in proportion, in the construction of the road in Dallas County, to the issue of the bonds in Laclede County, as one is to two, till after the bonds of Laclede County were expended in the construction of the road bed in Laclede County; that is, that for every $2 expended in Laclede County only $1 should be expended in Dallas County, until the whole of the Laclede County bonds should be expended.\n\nOn the 18th of May following the court ordered that whenever the railroad company should comply with the foregoing propositions and orders, the presiding justice and clerk of the court should have authority, in vacation, to sign and deliver to the county agent the necessary amount of bonds. Soon thereafter the conditions were accepted on the part of the railroad company, and the bonds were executed and issued, and delivered from time to time upon estimates as the grading of the road bed progressed. In the fall of 1870 Matthew Pare was appointed county agent to succeed G.W. OâBannon, and on the 18th day of the following May he reported to the court that up to that time bonds had been delivered, upon estimates of the chief engineer of the road of the amount of work executed, sufficient to purchase 740 shares of railroad stock, and that certificates of stock for the same had been issued to the county.\n\nAdditional Subscription â On the 18th day of May, 1871, the county court being then composed of Justices J.R. Gammon, W.K. Jump and Nathan White, made a further subscription to the capital stock of the railroad company, as fully appears by the following entry, which was then spread upon the record of their proceedings:\n\nIt having been satisfactorily shown to this court, by the proper estimates, that a further subscription to the capital stock of said company, of the sum of $85,000, is necessary to complete the grading, masonry and bridging of said road bed, so as to have the same ready for the ties, within the limits of Dallas County, and it further appearing, by the request of numerous tax payers of said county, that a further subscription to the said capital stock of said Laclede & Fort Scott Railroad Company, is recommended, it is therefore ordered by this court that the county of Dallas, in the State of Missouri, subscribe to the capital stock of said railroad company the sum of $85,000 as an additional subscription to that heretofore made, and that said sum is hereby so subscribed, subject to the following conditions and reservations, to wit:\n\n1. That the bonds of Dallas County be issued, in payment of the aforesaid subscription, of the denomination of $1,000 each, to run fifteen years, and to bear interest at the rate of 10 per cent per annum, payable semi-annually, on the first day of January and July in each year, and the said bonds and the coupons attached thereto shall designate when each is made payable and the amount thereof. The body of the bonds and the coupons thereon shall be signed by the presiding justice of the county court of said county, and be attested by the county clerk and seal of said court (and each coupon shall bear the autograph of said presiding justice and county clerk, neatly printed or stereotyped.)\n\n2. Said bonds shall not be issued nor delivered until this court have satisfactory evidence that the county of Laclede has made ample provisions for the completion of the road bed in said county of Laclede, nor until some able and reliable company shall have agreed and bound itself to equip said road; that is, tie, iron and put on the necessary rolling stock; nor until all contracts made by the same railroad company with the present contractor, to wit, Edward Burgess, be annulled, and finally terminated and set aside, so far as the work in Dallas County is concerned.\n\nOther conditions followed in the order, providing for the appointment of a financial agent to negotiate for the sale of the bonds in the Eastern markets, and providing restrictions similar to those in the order making the original subscription of $150,000.\n\nJustice Nathan White dissented, and objected to the making of the foregoing order, and entered his protest in the following words:\n\nI feel that it would be doing injustice to myself did I not enter upon the record my dissent and protest to the above action of the court. In a matter of the magnitude of the above, not only as to the amount involved, but to the general interest of the community, I do not feel that the court, acting as ministerial officers, should act without first ascertaining the will of the people. I do not wish to impose my peculiar views upon the court as to the propriety or impropriety of the action of the majority. But certainly it does appear to me, that in a matter of this kind, so directly affecting the most substantial interest of the people, wherein their financial weal or woe is so directly involved, and involving considerations of the most important as well as of the most complex character, far beyond my ability to fathom, and in which the intelligence and capital affected by the action is so much divided, it behooves this court to pause and well consider before they take action. We who compose this court, chosen from among the people to transact such ordinary business as is liable to come before it, are not so far superior to the majority of our fellow citizens in financial skill and ability (especially when a large majority have already entered their protest to the proposed action of this court) as to set their protest at defiance and act directly contrary thereto. But it certainly well behooves us to give all the light we can on the matter in hand, and heed, as I feel we are morally bound to do, the voice of the people, and afford them an opportunity to legally and regularly express their will. A discussion pro and con before the people could not fail to give light upon the subject, and the interest involved would insure impartial hearing, and I, for my part, am unwilling to make any order without their consent.\n\nOn the 19th of June, 1871, the court amended several paragraphs of the order subscribing the $85,000 additional stock â the amendments being mostly explanatory of the order, and more fully setting forth the intention of the court. On the 18th of December following the court ordered the bonds for the additional stock to be at once signed and delivered into the hands of a trustee, as previously provided for. The bonds were issued accordingly, and were all delivered to purchasers. The first subscription for $150,000, and the second for $85,000, made a total of ($235,000) two hundred and thirty-five thousand dollars, for which the county issued bonds for the purpose of securing a railroad. It will be noticed by the propositions that âa road bed and bridges ready to receive the cross tiesâ was all that was contracted for, with the exception that the bonds for the second subscription were not to be issued until some able and reliable company should have agreed and bound itself to equip the road â that is, tie, iron and put on the necessary rolling stock, etc. The railroad company, however, managed to secure all the bonds, or the proceeds therefrom, and did actually grade the road bed, \"ready for the cross ties,\" and erected the bridges, or a part of them, clear through the county, and then discontinued the work, so that the people have an enormous debt to pay and no âvalue receivedâ for it. Only a few of the bonds have been redeemed. The indebtedness of the county on account of the subscriptions of stock to this proposed railroad is now, because of the accumulated interest and costs of suits that have been brought upon the bonds, more than double the original amount subscribed.\n\nProposition to Refund Bonds â On the 7th day of August, 1878, the county court, acting under an act of the General Assembly of the State, entitled âAn act to authorize counties and towns to compromise their indebtedness,â approved April 12, 1877, ordered that an election should be held on the 10th day of September, 1878, for the purpose of submitting to the voters of the county a proposition to compromise $147,000 of the 7 per cent bonds, with accrued interest and judgments on past due coupons, at a discount of 22½ per cent upon the whole amount, by issuing new bonds, bearing 6 per cent interest, payable in twenty years, and redeemable at the pleasure of the county after five years from date. The election was held accordingly, and on the day following the county court counted the votes cast, and found the total number to be 922, and of that number 131 were cast in favor of the proposition to compromise the debt, and 791 against it. This of course defeated the compromise proposition, and left the original bonds outstanding.\n\nTo show the political aspect of Dallas County from 1848 to the present time, the number of votes cast therein for the several presidential candidates are given, as follows:\n\n1848 â Zachariah Taylor, Whig, 105; Lewis Cass, Dem., 283\n\n1852 â Winfield Scott, Whig, 102; Franklin Pierce, Dem., 344\n\n1856 â Millard Fillmore, Amer., 132; James Buchanan, Dem., 454\n\n1860 â Stephen A.

Kimball, Rep., 1,177; D.R. Francis, Dem., 703.\n\nFor the county officers elected in 1888 see below.\n\nCounty Officers\n\nThe following is a list of the names of county officers of Dallas County, with time of service annexed, so far as dates can now be ascertained:\n\nCounty Court Justices â The records of the county having all been destroyed up to and prior to September, 1867, no attempt will be made to name the county court justices in the order that they served, or to give the dates of their service prior to that time. Among them were Thomas Proctor, Peter Haynes, Thomas Marlan, Jacob Randleman, William Montgomery, John Ross, Jesse Hendrickson, George W. Mallard, Daniel Beckner, A.H. Henson, James Jones, John F. Marsh and others.\n\nFollowing is the list of county court justices and judges, with their dates of service, since September, 1867: A.V.F. Huston, 1867-68; Nathan White and John S. Brown, 1867-70; G.B. Gammon, 1868-72; W.K. Jump, 1870-72; Lewis W. Hart and John E. Haynes, 1872-78; A.B. Maddux, 1872-74; John W. Scott, 1872-80; J.M.B. Smith and N.J. Wollard, 1878-80; John E. Haynes, 1880-82. First District â John H. Davison, 1880-82; John Franklin, 1882-86; F. Bramwell, 1886-88; W.H. Buckner, 1888, present incumbent. Second District â L.W. Hart, 1880-82; J.N. Reser, 1882-84; James H. Karr, 1884-88, present incumbent, re-elected in 1888. Presiding judges â Thomas Hutchison, 1882-86; J.N. Vanderford, 1886, present incumbent; term runs to 1890.\n\nCounty Court Clerks â J.L. Paine, 1841-58; J.H. Paine, 1858-61; A.B. Maddux, 1861-70; W.J. Loafman, 1870-71; T.B. Morrow, 1871-77; George T. Edmisson, 1877-83; J.T. Pendleton, present incumbent, was elected in fall of 1882, and was re-elected in 1886; term expires in 1890.\n\nCircuit Court Clerks â Prior to 1870 the county court clerk was also clerk of the circuit court. In 1870 the office of the clerk of the two courts was separated, and since that time the circuit court clerks have been as follows, viz.: John S. Cummins to his death in 1873; Albert S. Stanley, 1873-78; A.G. Hollenbeck, 1878-82; J.P. O'Bannon, 1882, re-elected in 1886, present incumbent; term expires in 1890.\n\nSheriffs â It is claimed by some surviving old settlers that Arad White was the first sheriff of the county, and by others that William D. Beeler was the first. Be this as it may, there is evidence in existence that Beeler was sheriff in 1842, having collected taxes in that year; however, White may have filled the office a few months prior to that time. From best information at hand the succeeding sheriffs, down to the year 1860, were G.W. Henson, James B. Jones, Talbert Mayfield, William Davis and Daniel Lindsey.\n\nSince 1860 the office has been filled as follows: William Jones, 1860-61; C. McPheters, 1861-64; Thomas P. Welch, 1864-68; John O'Bannon, 1868-72; Francis Hale, 1872-74; J.W. Alexander, 1874-78; J.S. Burns, 1878-82; George Delaplain, 1882-84; J.S. Burns, 1884-86; George Delaplain, 1886-88, present incumbent, re-elected in 1888.\n\nAssessors â Jesse Vanderford, 1866-70; J.C. Bennett, 1870-74; J.H. Karr, 1874-76; W.J. Vanhorn, 1876-78; A. Skinner, 1878-80; W.J. Vanhorn, 1880-82; B.F. Johnson, 1882-84; J.M. Fowler, 1884-86; James A. Bales, 1886-88; Isaac W. Osborn, 1888. Of the assessors who served prior to 1866, there were Mark Reynolds, Thomas Proctor, J. Randles, Daniel Beckner, and perhaps others. Reynolds, who served for a long period, is believed to have been the first one.\n\nCollectors â From the organization of the county until the year 1872 the sheriff was, by virtue of his office, collector of the revenues. In 1872 the duties of sheriff and collector were divided, and the separate office of collector was created, and has been filled as follows: John O'Bannon, 1872-74; Francis Hale, 1874-80; Jacob Drake, 1880-84; J.W. Alexander, 1884-86; D.M. Rush, 1886-88; re-elected in 1888.\n\nTreasurers â J.H. Paine, 1856-58; W.L. Morrow, 1858-60; J.W. Gammon, 1860-64; R. Stanley, 1864-70; W.M. Bennett, 1870-72; I.N. Morrow, 1872-73; G.W. O'Bannon, 1873-78; M.G. Lovan, 1878-84; John Hendrickson, 1884-86; M.G. Lovan, 1886-88; re-elected in 1888.\n\nRepresentatives in Legislature â Thomas Martin, 1841-42; William Edwards, 1842-46; Burrel Jones, 1846-48; Kale Williams, 1848-50; Lem. Jones, 1850-54; Wash. Henson, 1854-56; William Edwards, 1856-60; William McBride, 1860-61; James Southard, 1861-64; D. Brown, 1864-66; James Southard, 1866-70; G.W. O'Bannon, 1870-72; J.C. Eldridge, 1872-74; John Hatfield, 1874-76; James Southard, 1876-78; M.L. Reynolds, 1878-80; W.L. Morrow, 1880-82; N.J. Wollard, 1882-86; Amos S. Smith, 1886-88; William P. Porter, 1888.\n\nThe Courts\n\nCounty Court â The first term of the county court of Niangua (the original name of Dallas County), was begun and held, as has already been stated, on the first Monday of March, 1841. It was then composed of three county court justices, appointed and commissioned by the governor of the State, to hold their offices until the first general election took place after the county was organized. This court then had original jurisdiction over all county and probate business, and continued to be composed of three county court justices until 1847, when, under an act entitled âAn act to establish a probate court in the county of Dallas,â approved February 15, 1847, it was changed in accordance with Section 16, which reads as follows:\n\nSection 16. Hereafter the justices of the peace of Dallas County, and their successors in office, or any three of them, shall be and are hereby constituted the county court instead of the justices of the county court, as now prescribed by law, for the purpose of transacting all business which the county court now transacts, excepting all business and matters conferred and enjoined upon the probate court of said county by this act; and they shall hold four terms of said court in each year, and at the times now fixed by law for holding county courts, and may hold special or adjourned terms, and said justices of the peace shall be exempt from serving as jurors or performing military duty, or working on roads.\n\nThe law further provided that such court, at the November term in every year, should make rules and regulations requiring every justice of the peace in each municipal township âto attend at least one term of said court for the next ensuing yearâ under a forfeiture of $5 for failing to do so. The law also provided that the justices of the peace, or a majority of them, should choose one of their number to be president of the court. Thus the county court continued to exist for a time, and until, under a new law, it was again made to consist of three county court justices, as originally organized, and thus it continued to be composed until it was reorganized under the new law of 1877. This law, entitled âAn act to provide for a uniform system of county courts,â approved April 27, 1877, provided that each county within the State should be divided into two districts, as nearly equal in population as possible without dividing municipal townships, and at the general election in 1880, and every two years thereafter, there should be elected in each district an associate judge of the county court, and that at the general election in 1882, and every four years thereafter, a presiding judge of the court should be elected at large.\n\nIn accordance with this law the county court, at its March term, 1878, divided the county into districts, by an order of which the following is a copy: âIt is ordered by the court that the county be districted as follows: That District No. 1 be composed of Jackson, Washington, and Jasper Townships, and that District No. 2 be composed of Benton, Grant, Lincoln and Miller Townships, for the purpose of electing county judges.â The law of 1877 continues in force, and under its provisions the county court has been and continues to be composed. Prior to the organization of the present probate court, with the exception of a short time that a probate court existed under a special law of 1847, the county court of Dallas County had jurisdiction of all county and probate business, the former consisting of levying taxes and superintending the collection and expenditures of the revenues, and all general county business, and the latter of granting letters of administration and guardianship, settlements of decedents' estates, and all general probate business.\n\nProbate Court â The first probate court in Dallas County was established in accordance with an act entitled âAn act to establish a probate court in the county of Dallas,â approved February 15, 1847. This act provided that the first election of a probate judge should take place on the first Monday of August, 1847, and that the judge then elected should hold his office for one year only, and at each subsequent election, to be held on the same day at the end of every two years thereafter, beginning on the first Monday of August, 1848, a probate judge should be elected to hold his office for the term of two years. The law also provided that there should be four terms of the probate court held in each year, commencing on the first Mondays of March, June, September and December. At the first election held under this law Jesse L. Paine was elected probate judge, and was probably re-elected in 1848.\n\nAnother act of the Legislature, supplementary and explanatory of the foregoing, approved March 8, 1849, provided that the county court of Dallas County might, at any general election, âopen a poll book for and against the operation of this law,â and if a majority voted against the law, or if a majority at any time should petition the court to abolish the law, the same should be declared to be inoperative. Under the provisions of the last act here referred to, the probate court was soon abolished, and the county court again assumed jurisdiction of the probate business. The records having been destroyed, no further particulars of the first probate court of Dallas County can now be given. For many years prior to the organization of the present probate court, the county court kept a separate record of the probate business; that is, separate from the record containing the proceedings pertaining to general county business. The present probate court was established in 1874, the first term thereof having been begun on the first day of June, of that year, by B.F. McHenry, judge of the court. Judge McHenry served until the close of 1882, his successor, Judge S.B. Roll, having been elected that year. Judge Roll held his first term, commencing February 26, 1883, and served until his death, which occurred in October, 1885; then John S. Haymes, the present judge, was appointed to fill the vacancy. He was elected to the office in November, 1886. His term expires in 1890.\n\nCircuit Court â Dallas County, when originally organized, belonged to and formed a part of the Seventh Judicial Circuit, as will be seen by Section 4 of act entitled âAn act concerning courts,â approved February 5, 1841, which reads as follows:\n\nSection 4. The circuit courts of the Seventh Judicial Circuit shall be holden as follows:\n\nFor the county of Kinderhook, on the second Mondays of March, July, and November; for the county of Niangua, on the first Thursdays after the second Mondays of March, July and November; for the county of Polk, on the third Mondays of March, July and November; for the county of Bates, on the fourth Mondays of March, July and November; the county of St. Clair, on the first Mondays after the fourth Mondays of March, July and November; for the county of Benton, on the second Mondays after the fourth Mondays of March, July and November.\n\nA subsequent act of the Legislature, entitled âAn act to fix time for holding circuit courts,â approved February 24, 1843, reduced the number of terms to be held in each of the counties composing the Seventh Judicial Circuit from three to two, and provided that the circuit court in Niangua (Dallas) County should be held on the third Mondays of March and September of each year. It also fixed the time for holding the court in the other counties of the circuit. Another act of the Legislature, entitled âAn act concerning courts in the Seventh Judicial Circuit,â approved March 8, 1849, in changing the time for holding court in each of the several counties composing the circuit, provided that in the county of Dallas the terms of the court should commence on the second Mondays after the fourth Mondays in March and September. At this time the circuit was composed of the counties of Benton, Hickory, Laclede, Dallas, Polk, Cedar, St. Clair and Henry. For further particulars pertaining to the judicial circuit, and the names of the judges presiding, see history of Laclede County.\n\nThe Dallas County Bar â The first resident lawyers of the Dallas County bar were âDockâ Williams and William L. Smith, the latter being also one of the pioneer school-teachers at Buffalo. They began to practice soon after the county was organized, and continued until some time during the fifties. Kale Williams and Burrel T. Jones also practiced a few years. The former went to California about the year 1850, and soon afterward the latter returned to Illinois, from whence he came. James E. McCall, a very good lawyer, was a member of the bar for a few years before the Civil War, at the beginning of which he went South, having previously come from Alabama. S.G. Whittlesey, Peter Wilson, J.H. Sturgeon and Benjamin F. McHenry all practiced a few years after the close of the Civil War. Ben. V. Alton was a recent member of the bar, and served as judge of the circuit from 1883 to 1885.\n\nThe members of the bar at this writing are Amos S. Smith, Oscar H. Scott, John S. Haymes, W.G. Robertson, Thomas M. Brown, William P. Porter, John W. Miller, Levi Engle, George T. Edmisson, Albert S. Stanley, W.R. Self, A.D. Matthews and C.A. Jameson. The bar is sufficiently large in numbers, and averages fairly in ability with the bar of other counties of like size and population.\n\nCriminal Record â With the exception of the war period, Dallas County has escaped much better from the crime of murder than any other Missouri counties. A number of homicides have taken place within its limits, but they are comparatively few. No man has ever been convicted and executed within the county. A number have been prosecuted for capital crimes, and some, being found guilty, have been punished; others have been acquitted. Among the most noted cases are the following:\n\nThe killing of Blankenship occurred about the year 1853 or 1854, soon after the town of Buffalo had been incorporated. A crowd of men, who were averse to having their liberties to drink, carouse and disturb the peace curtailed, assembled, as was their custom, at a grocery, or more properly a âdram-shop,â on the east side of the public square in Buffalo, and there raised a disturbance against the peace and dignity of the incorporation. This disturbance took place after sunset, and just as it began to grow dark. Sheriff Talbert Mayfield, who was also marshal of the town, commanded a number of citizens to assist him in quelling the disturbance, and, on reaching the place in front of the dram-shop where the men were carousing, the sheriff was met by Blankenship, who was on horseback. The latter struck the sheriff a blow, which brought him to his knees; at this instant John A. Lee, assistant marshal, fired a shot, and Blankenship fell, or got off his horse, and soon thereafter died from the effects of his wounds. In the fracas, however, the sheriff and his posse were compelled to fall back, and leave the mob master of the situation. At the next term of the court Lee was indicted for the offense of murder in the first degree. On being arraigned for trial he plead ânot guilty,â and upon application obtained a change of venue to the circuit court at Springfield, where he was finally tried and acquitted.\n\nGeorge Matthews and brother were killed in 1882. The Matthews family lived near the Niangua River, about twelve miles northeast of Buffalo, and on one occasion, in the year 1882, George and his brother, on returning home from Long Lane, met their younger brother and one Homer Sharp, who were out hunting, when the latter two were taken on horseback behind the former, and thus together they all proceeded on their way homeward. Presently shots were fired by parties concealed in ambush, and George Matthews and his brother first above mentioned were killed, and the other two, the younger brother and Sharp, were wounded, one of them very severely, but both recovered. The wounded men fled home and reported the event, and then parties assembled and went back and secured the bodies of the dead men. Soon afterward an inspection of the premises and surroundings was made by Sheriff John S. Burns and others. Tracks and other circumstances were discovered which led to the suspicion and arrest of Berry Keith, Peter Hawk, T.L. Case and James Ford. These parties, on charge of committing the crime, were given a preliminary examination before a justice of the peace, who bound them over to await the action of the grand jury at the October term of the circuit court; but the evidence produced to the grand jury was not sufficient to warrant the finding of an indictment against them, and consequently they were set at liberty.\n\nAbout June 25, 1886, Beverly B. Todd, who lived five miles northeast of Buffalo, was shot and killed when alone at his residence. He lived, however, a short time, long enough to say a few words to certain persons, who having heard him scream went to his assistance. The party or parties who did the shooting seem to have been concealed. Circumstances, however, led to the arrest of John, Joseph and Benjamin Owens, who, being charged with the commitment of the crime, were given a preliminary trial before Esquire T.J. Jones, the trial commencing July 6, 1886. The State was represented by Levi Engle, prosecuting attorney, and the defendants by Alton and Brown. The trial resulted in binding the defendants over to await the action of the grand jury at the next term of court. An indictment was found, charging John Owens with the murder of Todd and the other defendants as accessories thereto. The principal, John Owens, was tried at a special term in January, 1887, and was found ânot guilty.â The case against the other two defendants was nolle prosequied. A few other homicides have taken place within the county.\n\nMilitary Items\n\nMexican War â The first military organization raised in Dallas County for actual service was a company of soldiers raised and organized in the late summer or early fall of 1847, for the Mexican War. The officers of this company were Capt. Thomas Jones and Lieut. Joseph Eldridge and William Crudgington. The company left Buffalo about the middle of September, 1847, and went to Independence, Mo., where it was mustered into the United States service as a part of Col. Gilpen's battalion of mounted dragoons, which served as escorts and kept the line of communication open from the States through the Indian Territory and what is now New Mexico, wintering at Santa Fe.\n\nAfter serving about one year the company returned to Independence, and was there mustered out of service, and on returning to Buffalo the soldiers were given a public reception, with a grand barbecue. A beef was roasted whole, and several sheep, pigs and wild turkeys were also roasted, and other provisions and delicious viands were prepared, and the soldiers were welcomed home with âa feast on the fat of the land.â Another luxury â or that which has always been considered a luxury â was whisky, which was carried through the streets in buckets, with dippers therein, accompanied with plenty of brown sugar to sweeten it, and of this the returned soldiers and citizens partook to such an extent that many of them became wondrous happy in their hilarity. Speeches were made and toasts were given, and all were glad that the soldiers had returned victorious, and that the dominion of the country had been extended. Among the survivors of this, the first company of soldiers raised in Dallas County, are William Burns, James Cheek and James Hoover, still living in the county.\n\nThe Civil War â Of the 705 votes cast in Dallas County for presidential candidates in 1860, John C. Breckinridge, representing the âSouthern Cause,â or secession element, received only 172. The votes cast at the same time for Douglas, Bell and Lincoln may counted as cast by men that were loyal to the Government of the United States; hence it follows that at the outbreak of the Civil War a large majority of the people of Dallas County were in favor of maintaining the Union at all hazards. Much excitement then prevailed, and the enlistment of troops soon began.\n\nTroops Raised â Early in the summer of 1861 Capt. Robert W. Fyan (since judge) raised a company of soldiers for the Twenty-fourth Regiment Infantry, Missouri Volunteers, in the county of Webster and the southern part of Dallas County. These were the first recruits from Dallas County for the United States army.\n\nCompany I, Eighth Regiment Cavalry, Missouri Volunteers, was partially raised in Dallas County, and among the officers were Lieuts. Thomas Franklin and James M. Reeser from this county. A sketch of the history of this regiment is given in the history of Laclede County. This company was mustered into the service in September, 1862.\n\nCompany D, Fifteenth Regiment Cavalry, Missouri Volunteers, was raised in Dallas and Polk Counties, in about equal proportions. The following is the roster of the company officers:\n\nCapt. T.B. Sutherland, commissioned November 1, 1863, mustered out July 1, 1865. Lieut. William Gammon, commissioned November 1, 1863, mustered out July 1, 1865. Lieut. Thomas B. Hopper, commissioned July 3, 1864, mustered out July 1, 1865.\n\nOn the first day of April, 1863, this regiment was organized, with eight companies of eighty men each, at Mount Vernon, Mo., being designated as the Second Provisional Regiment, and was at once placed in the field as regular troops, and stationed as follows: Mount Vernon, Bower's Mills, Melville, Gadfly, Bolivar, Humansville, Stockton and Galena, on the western border of the State; these companies did good service in clearing the country of bushwhackers, and protecti"
