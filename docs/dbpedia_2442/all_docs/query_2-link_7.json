        "text": "In the United States today, a significant number of students speak English as a second language. Despite their growing numbers, however, many teachers may feel unprepared to provide instruction for students with a variety of language needs or who are at different stages of mastering English. One way to alleviate this uncertainty is for instructors to learn the basic tenets of second-language acquisition.\n\nSecond language proficiency develops incrementally, somewhat like first language development. Teachers who have an understanding of the developmental language stages are more likely to be able to provide appropriate and differentiated instruction to English learners. See the table below for an overview of the stages of second language acquisition.\n\nStage I Silent/ Receptive or Preproduction Stage (up to six months) During this stage, students typically maintain a silent period. When they interact, they tend to do so by gesturing, nodding, or using “yes” or “no” responses. Stage II Early Production Stage (can continue for an additional six months after Stage I) During this stage, students are able to speak using one- or two-word phrases and to indicate their understanding of novel information by responding to simple questions (e.g., “who?” or “what?”). Stage III Speech Emergence Stage (can last up to one year) This stage sees students employing short phrases and simple sentences, though difficulty with language usage may sometimes inhibit their ability to communicate. Stage IV Intermediate Language Proficiency Stage (can take another year after Stage III) During this stage, students are capable of formulating longer and more complex statements, of requesting clarification, and of expressing their own thoughts and opinions. Stage V Advanced Language Proficiency Stage (can require five to seven years to gain proficiency) In this stage, students are able to use English in a manner similar to their native English-speaking peers.\n\nNote: In each of these stages, the student’s receptive language (i.e., understanding) is generally better than their expressive language (i.e., speaking).\n\nAs students progress through these stages, they develop two types of language proficiency: social and academic, often referred to as BICS and CALP.\n\nBasic Interpersonal Communicative Skills (BICS)—Refers to a student’s ability to understand basic conversational English, sometimes called social language. At this level of proficiency, students are able to understand face-to-face social interactions and can converse in everyday social contexts. These social language skills—generally acquired in approximately two years—are sufficient for early educational experiences but are inadequate for the linguistic demands of upper elementary school and beyond. Students acquire this social language by interacting with their peers, family members, and playmates. For example, Maria, who has lived in the United States for only a few months, is already able to understand her peers when they ask her in the cafeteria, “Maria, do you want to sit with us?” Maria has learned this so quickly because her peers ask her the same question on a daily basis and use physical gestures to help her to understand.\n\nCognitive Academic Language Proficiency (CALP)—Refers to a student’s ability to effectively understand and use the more advanced and complex language necessary for success in academic endeavors, sometimes referred to as academic language. Students typically acquire CALP in five to seven years, a period during which they spend a significant amount of time struggling with academic concepts in the classroom. A student like Maria, who has only been in the United States for a few months, may find it difficult to understand the content-related terms (such as “photosynthesis”) discussed during Mr. Bennett’s science lesson. She may also struggle with instruction-related terms such as “compare and contrast.” Finally, her difficulty may be compounded by the fact that she may not have learned these concepts in her first language.\n\nBecause teachers are often unaware of this distinction, they sometimes misinterpret the fluent English their students use when speaking to their peers as an indication that those students are English-proficient. When those same students struggle academically, teachers often discount language as a factor. This lack of knowledge about social and academic language often leads to inaccurate assumptions about a student’s ability, potentially resulting in:\n\nLow expectations for students\n\nInstruction that lacks appropriate scaffolds and supports\n\nInappropriate referrals to special education\n\nListen now as Clint McDougal talks about Maria and her comfort with using newly acquired English during play (time: 0:55)."
