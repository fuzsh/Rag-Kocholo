        "text": "“\n\nI love you, Iris. And I know you're gonna be okay. We all will. (...) Because I'm not the real asset. We are. The two of us together. We have spent our whole lives making each other better. Stronger. Your smarts. Your instincts. (...) Your bravery. Your fight. They have no clue what you can do. That's how we're gonna beat them. They think they need me to save the world, but you... You are gonna save the world from them. We will. We got this. So grin, girl.\n\n―Hope to Iris, shortly before splitting up.[src]\n\n”\n\nHope Bennett is one of two protagonists and a survivor of the outbreak in AMC's The Walking Dead: World Beyond. She is the adoptive sister of Iris and daughter of Kari and Leopold Bennett. She is also a former resident of the Campus Colony of Omaha, one of three cities part of the Alliance of the Three.\n\nDubbed \"The Asset\" by the Civic Republic Military for her high level of intelligence, Hope was led on a fabricated journey across the country with the Endlings by CRM operative, Jennifer Mallick to teach her the importance of saving humanity until her cover was later exposed. After being coerced into transferring to a research facility to work alongside her father, who she had previously believed to have been in danger, Hope was able to thrive in academics and formulate a new scientific theory to speed up the decaying process of the undead. Despite her growing comfort amid her month at the facility, Hope ultimately played an integral role in helping the scientists escape the CRM's clutches after learning of the genocide of Omaha and the Campus Colony, taking her fellow classmate Mason Beale, the son of the military's Major General, hostage as a result. Following the group's success, Hope temporarily parted ways with her sister as the survivors settled in an underground mall, continuing her studies with their father and the remaining scientists.\n\nOverview[]\n\nHope is Iris' rebellious, troublemaking, fun-loving sister. Convinced the world is doomed, Hope lives for today, shunning responsibilities in favor of partying and having a good time. But underneath her carefree “live for today” attitude, Hope is haunted by a dark secret, something she's kept hidden from her sister and the others around her.[2]\n\nPre-Apocalypse[]\n\nLincoln, Nebraska[]\n\nHope Bennett was born on October 8, 2003 and raised in Lincoln, Nebraska. As a baby, she was adopted by Leopold and Kari Bennett, who also had a daughter named Iris. Leo was a professor at Nebraska State University and the four grew up happily in a loving home. During this time, a young man named Felix Carlucci was kicked out of his house by his parents for coming out as gay. Leo then adopted Felix and brought him in their home as one family who accepted him.\n\nPost-Apocalypse[]\n\nLincoln, Nebraska[]\n\nIn the fall of 2010, the outbreak occurred across the planet. Hope and her family survived the initial outbreak. During that night, Hope and her family were evacuating to the University. Hope's mother noticed a pregnant woman in danger, but Leo told them they had no time to rescue her. Empties then began to approach the family, causing Iris to become frightened and let go of Hope and their mother, causing them to get separated in the chaos. At that moment, a plane full of undead passengers crashed into the streets, only worsening the situation.\n\nAfter the crash, Hope and Kari attempted to reunite with Leo and Iris until Hope spotted a pick-up truck and suggested it would help them find Leo and Iris and get to the university. Unfortunately the pregnant woman, now armed approached the mother and daughter and demanded she take the truck to find her husband and son. Kari attempted to reason with the pregnant woman, but to no avail, prompting Hope to lunge toward her — causing the pregnant woman to shoot Kari in the chest. As both the woman and the young girl stood in shock, Hope retrieved the gun and aimed it at the woman, only to accidentally fire it due to a nearby explosion, resulting in her accidentally shooting and killing the woman.\n\nHope eventually reunited with Leo, Iris, and Felix and arrived at the university, but did not reveal that Kari was murdered or the fact that she killed the woman responsible, saying that Kari was devoured by empties. The rest of her family survived, with Leo establishing a community within Nebraska State University and later joining the Alliance of the Three. A grave was then created for Kari within the Campus Colony, the night she died was later infamously known as \"The Night the Sky Fell\" or \"NSF\". Since then, Hope became a rebel within the community - with the desire to leave one day and not only revisit Omaha, but the rest of the world before it could be rebuilt, or, in Hope's belief, before humanity goes extinct.\n\nAmong the Alliance of the Three was the Civic Republic - whose origin and operations are unknown unlike the Campus Colony or Portland, Oregon. In 2020, the CRM requested Leo Bennett's scientific knowledge at an unknown base of operations, prompting him to leave the Campus Colony. Hope begged and screamed at her father not to go, but he insisted on going, with Felix's boyfriend, Will, accompanying him. Shortly after his arrival, however, he was able to send faxes to his Hope, Iris, and Felix in a cabinet in his office - with continual updates. Meanwhile, Hope spent her time either training with Jennifer how to fight or brewing contraband alcohol.\n\nSeason 1[]\n\n\"Brave\"[]\n\nHope sneaks into the baggage compartment of the bus carrying the representatives to meet with the CRM delegates. At one point, a walker grabs onto the side of the bus and nearly gets to Hope, but it eventually falls off. After the bus stops, Hope sneaks away to the Campus Colony Cemetery where she pays her respects to her mother. However, the arrival of the CRM helicopter interrupts this and she quickly sneaks back to the bus. Observing Lieutenant Colonel Elizabeth Kublek from a distance, Hope gives her the middle finger which Kublek notices as Hope quickly runs away. Upon returning to the Campus Colony, Hope realizes that Silas Plaskett saw her stowing away, but he promises not to rat her out and she invites Silas to a party that she's throwing. Watching the CRM helicopter flying overhead, Hope shakes her head in disgust.\n\nReturning home that night, Hope finds Iris working on her Feast Day speech and Iris confronts Hope about the modified banner. Iris points out that Hope had used to be fine with the Civic Republic, but Hope points out how little they know about them at all and expresses resentment at the CRM taking their father while giving them a soldier in return. However, Iris defends their father's important work in finding a cure to the walkers and berates Hope for her stunt with the banner. Iris asks Hope to sign Felix's birthday card and they bicker briefly about Iris' decision to focus on studying science instead of her artistic talents. After Iris confirms that there's no new messages from Leo, Hope bemoans how she had screamed at their father not to go and pushes Iris to come to her party. Iris flips her off and returns to working on her speech.\n\nThe next day, Hope's alcohol lab is raided by the police and she is arrested. Hope tries to claim that it's only a little bit, but Felix calls it a lifetime supply and is annoyed that Hope hasn't finally gotten her act together with Leo gone as he had hoped. Coming closer, Felix quietly asks if Hope has heard anything from Leo and she confirms that its been months since they've heard anything. Felix asks Hope why she does the destructive things that she does with all of her gifts, but she turns the question around on him. Felix states that her dad had given him a life which he is grateful for even if it means trying to reign Hope in. Iris arrives and Felix states that he needs a family member to sign for Hope until she can appear before the CCC. Iris points out that he has guardianship over them and Felix releases Hope, stating that he'd wanted her to think about what she did.\n\nThe two girls leave with Hope complaining about Felix's behavior and Iris telling Hope that their father would state that her ability to make that much alcohol would show that Hope has an impressive grasp of chemistry. Spotting Kublek nearby, Hope tries to go in the other direction, but Kublek greets the two girls by name. Kublek thanks them for the sacrifice of their father being gone for months on end and lauds their accomplishments, but Hope rudely rejects Kublek's words and walks away. Hope accuses Iris of not trusting the CRM either and confronts her sister about the nightmares that she's had every night since their father left, but Iris dismisses it. Hope is convinced that they will never see their father again and is sure that Iris knows it deep down too before walking away from her sister.\n\nWhen Iris tells Dr. K about their family getting separated on the Night the Sky Fell, Hope appears in a flashback with Iris, Leo and their mother Kari.\n\nHope later trains with Huck and, sitting in the stands as Elton teaches a karate class, discusses her arrest and how Huck never talks about her life in Omaha. Huck insists that there's not much to tell, but Hope admits that she's thinking of going to visit despite there being \"over a hundred miles of crap\" between the Campus Colony and Omaha. Hope is convinced that the world's gonna end again and that building everything back up is pointless. As a result, Omaha will be gone if she keeps waiting for her chance to see it. Hope believes that it's not because of the threat of the walkers, but rather the destructive nature of people themselves. Huck tells Hope that \"it's not it is what it is\" before departing as Hope continues watching Elton's class. Playing with her necklace, Hope has a flashback to the Night the Sky Fell, making her way through the crashed plane filled with corpses and walkers along with her mother despite them both being afraid.\n\nLater, Hope arrives at Leo's office and notices that Iris has the cabinet open even with Silas and Elton present. Iris hands Hope the message that she had found from their father and Hope, warily eying Silas and Elton, is concerned by what Leo might mean when he says that his safety isn't assured. Silas is surprised that their father is sending them messages and Elton promises that they won't say anything about it. In order to prove that he will keep their secret, Elton admits that he regularly sneaks out which is how he'd found the Easy Bake Oven and why he wears his suit which he calls bite-proof. Elton explains that he's looking for something that he lost and to see how their world is changing. They now have each other's secrets and Silas promises that he won't tell anyone either. Iris insists that the message could meaning anything or nothing and that the CR has always been very upfront, but Hope reveals that while Kublek claimed that the CRM could only spare one helicopter, there was actually five of them, some of which were carrying shipping containers. Hope insists that the CRM is bad and that their dad is in trouble and that only one person can help them.\n\nAt the Bennett home, Hope and Iris show Felix Leo's message that his safety isn't guaranteed. Felix points out that the science exchange with the Civic Republic is about building trust and that it's the first time that they have allowed anyone from outside within those borders wherever those are and that Leo is breaking a number of rules just by sending them messages. Hope insists that Leo could be in trouble and that they must tell someone, but Felix reminds her that Leo hadn't wanted them to tell anyone about the messages as they don't know what the Civic Republic will do when they find out. Felix insists upon honoring Leo's wishes which were meant to keep them safe and that if he is in trouble, they need to put their faith into Leo's security detail - Felix's boyfriend Will - and that they don't have another choice. Angry, Hope leaves, followed by Iris.\n\nFollowing Hope down the street, Iris states that the message could mean anything and that radio static could've caused it, but Hope insists that the CRM are bad people who have their dad and she is incredulous that Hope can't see it. Kublek interrupts them, asking how the Civic Republic, one of their Alliance partners, are bad exactly. Iris confronts Kublek on how the CRM won't let anyone in or out, communicate with their people or vice versa, they won't tell anyone where they are and they have Hope and Iris' dad. Kublek reveals that she has a daughter who is a bit older than them and is a soldier in the CRM, causing her daughter to be away from Kublek a great deal. However, she remembers the work that her daughter is doing to protect the Civic Republic and the Alliance of the Three and to bring the world back which makes Kublek brave. Kublek insists that they have to be brave in the life that they have, simply existing. Kublek decides to tell them something that will make them trust her, something that will make her need to trust them. Kublek reveals that Leo is teaching at the Civic Republic Research Facility in New York State. Kublek provides them with a coded map to the facility, one that won't show Hope and Iris where in New York, but contains a watermark and a stamp that will show certain people that she gave it to them. However, if those people find out, Kublek will certainly go to jail for it. Kublek assures the two that she's serious and also maybe a little drunk and asks how Hope had learned to make the champagne, explaining that Felix had given it to her as a generous gift from the Campus Colony. Hope explains that she had learned from a book in the library, amusing and impressing Kublek who calls them both their father's daughters. Kublek admits that she had noticed it when she landed with Iris' banner and Hope flipping her off, simply stating that they're brave when Hope asks how that makes them like Leo. The two laugh about Hope hitching a ride in the baggage compartment and make fun of Kublek before leaving to drink some of their father's brandy.\n\nThe next morning, a hungover Iris awakens from another nightmare to see another message from Leo telling them that it's gone bad, he's keeping his head down and ordering them not to tell Felix or the council. Even though both know that whatever is going on is bad, Hope doesn't think that there's anything that they can do except wait and hope. Hope reminds Iris that her speech is in an hour, telling Iris that she thinks that their father would want her to give it. Hope constantly rolls her eyes during Kublek's speech, but smiles at her sister's.\n\nWalking with Hope after her speech, Iris insists that they know that Leo might need help which is enough for them to go and help him somehow. While Hope is incredulous, Iris points out that Felix won't go with them to protect and states that they need to be the ones to go and they know where he is. Hope argues against the idea as being crazy, but Iris refuses to look away or lie anymore, stating that she knows that Hope can't either. Iris admits that she froze on the Night the Sky Fell, but promises that she's not freezing anymore. Iris tells her sister that she should've have to go see their mother die and Hope tells her that she's glad that Iris didn't have to see it, fingering her necklace.\n\nIn another flashback to the Night the Sky Fell, after escaping from the plane wreckage, Hope spots an abandoned truck that they can take. As Hope and Kari run for the truck, Amelia, the pregnant woman that they had previously encountered confronts them at gunpoint so that she can take the truck instead. As Kari tries to convince the frightened woman to wait for Leo and Iris so that they can all take the truck together, Hope runs at Amelia, causing her to shoot Kari dead out of fear and drop her gun. After desperately calling out to her mother, Hope picks up the gun and accidentally shoots Amelia dead after being startled by an explosion behind her. Hope then picks up a bead that Amelia dropped which becomes her necklace.\n\nIn the present, Hope tells her sister that she's glad that Iris didn't see any of it and argues that they could die trying to go after Leo, but Iris points out that they could live and that when they arrive, they will be different and ready. Finally, looking at Silas raking the leaves nearby, Hope states that they know a way out.\n\nLater, Hope and Iris lay out their plan to Silas and Elton, showing them the route that they have mapped out. Elton points out a couple of flaws in their plan, admitting that he's trying to talk them into letting him go with them, Silas asking to go as well. Elton states that they need help and in the time that he has left on this Earth, he wants to mean something and to see the world outside before he's gone and he knows karate. Accepting this, the girls turn to Silas who simply tells them that he doesn't want to be the person that everyone at the Campus Colony sees him as.\n\nElton leads the group outside through an old door and they look out over a river together. Crossing under a fence, the group avoids some immobile walkers nearby and walks through the ruined city, coming upon the wreckage of the plane that was brought down on the Night the Sky Fell and as night falls, continuing across a bridge where Silas and Elton find the dinosaur fossil that Elton had been looking for which was supposed to be a gift for his sister.\n\nThe next morning, as Hope plays with the S-pole that they stole from Felix, Elton adds his Triceratops horn to Hope's training pole which Iris excitedly takes for herself as a weapon. Iris happily tells Hope that she was drawing things that she's been thinking about for living in the now and she didn't have any dreams the night before. As the group continues on through an abandoned neighborhood, they spot a lone walker in the distance and Iris decides to deal with it herself. Excitedly, Iris approaches the walker and raises her weapon, ready to put it down.\n\n\"The Blaze of Gory\"[]\n\nIris struggles against the walker, repeatedly stabbing it in the wrong place and making mistakes. Hope calls out to Iris that they're not ready, but Iris insists that she is before her fight causes Iris and the walker to fall down a hole, leaving the walker impaled upon a fallen tree. As the others descend to join them, Iris laughs at the fallen walker and Hope makes sure that she's alright before berating her sister for her recklessness. Elton takes pictures of the walker and comments upon its different physiology. Retrieving her weapon, Iris once again tries to put it down, but she ends up throwing up on the walker instead. As the group leaves the walker trapped, Hope tells it that she's sorry. The group continues on through the ruined city with Hope and Iris joking about their memories of their childhood there.\n\nWhile the group is stopped, Hope bowls into some crates in front of Iris and Silas and notices Elton taking pictures of a walker that has been pinned down by a fallen tree limb. Elton quotes his mom about nature always winning and tells Hope that Amelia was right about them being at the end of the sixth extinction event on the planet. Elton believes that while humanity was killing themselves directly and indirectly, nature made a shortcut with the undead. Based on how long the dinosaurs were around before they went extinct, Elton suggests that humanity has only about 15 years before they are gone too while Hope comments that she would've given them way less time. Elton and Hope acknowledge that unlike most people, they are both at peace with the end of the world.\n\nStaring through a pair of binoculars, Iris notices a plume of smoke rising into the sky and, handing the binoculars to Hope, tells her that it's the Blaze while Elton is amazed that the Blaze of Gory is real. As Silas is confused, Iris, Hope and Elton explain that it's an everlasting fire that has drawn massive amounts of walkers which Elton explains is the reason that they haven't seen too many walkers in the area. Iris argues for them to at least see if they can pass through the Blaze as otherwise, they have to detour 60 miles to get around it. Hope reluctantly agrees to check it out while Elton wants to see it regardless if they pass through it or not. As the others leave, Hope secretly leaves behind an empty can of sliced peaches in the middle of the road.\n\nAs they continue towards the Blaze, Elton collects a rock and pulls out a can of spray paint, explaining that he can continue Dr. Bavolar's experiments into studying the walkers migration patterns and Silas agrees to help him. The group stops in front of a walker that is weirdly covered, only to have a swarm of bees emerge from inside of the walker which they had been using as a beehive. While trying to shake off the bees and flee, the walker comes after Elton who falls to the ground. Silas steps up to his defense, but he hesitates to use his wrench on the walker and instead helps Elton up and they flee along with the others. Spotting a treehouse, Elton stops the group for the night.\n\nInside the treehouse, the group enjoys playing with the bowling ball, Silas with a little reluctance, before they are interrupted by the arrival of the walker that they had earlier encountered. Hope reluctantly agrees to drop her bowling ball on the walker, but while she succeeds in destroying part of its face, she fails to destroy the head completely and put the walker down. As Elton begins looking for something else to throw at it, Silas apologizes for not putting it down earlier. Iris reassures Silas that it's okay, stating that walkers are supposed to get distracted pretty easily and that if it's still around in the morning, they can deal with it then. Elton finds Monopoly in the treehouse and the group enjoys a game before going to sleep.\n\nHowever, Hope is haunted by the noise of the walker still outside and memories of accidentally killing a woman on the Night the Sky Fell and she can't sleep. Grabbing an old doll, Hope sets on fire and tosses it across the lawn, drawing the walker away. Hope descends the rope ladder with her S-Pole to kill it, but she ends up falling, drawing the walker's attention back to her. Hope manages to lure the walker through a broken fence towards a swimming pool, but she falls in with it and ends up hanging onto the edge with the walker trying to get her from below. Hope manages to kick the walker off of her and climb out, but she flips it off and leaves the walker trapped in the pool rather than putting it down. Hope returns to bed and Silas asks if she got rid of it, but Hope states that she didn't do anything. Nevertheless, Silas thanks her as it was his mistake for not putting it down earlier, but Hope tells him that it wasn't, but even if it was, \"that doesn't mean it has to follow you around forever.\" Silas agrees to keep it a secret and puts his headphones on and goes back to bed.\n\nThe next day, the group stops near the Blaze of Gory and Iris peers at it through their binoculars. At Hope's request, Iris gives her the binoculars while Elton takes a picture with the binoculars showing a smoke-filled bus depot crowded with walkers. Sitting on a tennis court, Hope argues against going into the Blaze, calling what she saw crazy. Elton agrees that the Blaze is quite big, but Iris argues that they can do it. According to their map, there is an airfield on the other side of the Blaze which is surrounded by a fence, meaning that the walkers coming from the east have to go around it leaving them a clear path to go through due east. Hope asks about what they will do about the walkers before the fence, but Elton believes that they can evade them by using the buses for cover. Hope points out that they've barely survived two encounters with single walkers let alone a whole herd, but Silas states that they will probably get caught if they go around and he can't go back. Having come outside to see what the world is start to finish, Elton agrees with Silas as he doesn't intend to finish before he starts. With darkness coming, Iris decides that they'll wait for dawn when the shadows will be long and they'll have more cover.\n\nHalf an hour before dawn, the group begins packing up to go into the Blaze. Elton approaches Hope who is sitting on a bench and comments on how nice Hope and Iris' jackets are. Hope explains that Silas' grandmother had taught him how to sew and he was able to fix the jackets up so that they would better fit the girls. Hope asks if it bothers Elton that they are going to end up like the dinosaurs and Elton returns the question. Hope admits that she thinks that she always knew that it was always going to go that way, before becoming suspicious that Elton is dodging her question. Elton states that he was just curious and that it doesn't bother him. There always had to have been a last generation and he wonders if they knew that they were the end and were therefore special. Hope wonders if they're the last generation which Elton calls \"endlings\" which is what the last of a species is called. Elton calls himself lucky to know that, \"to know that I need to make my life count. it's all I can do. Really, it's all any of us can do. We're the Endlings.\" Hope is intrigued by Elton calling them Endlings, but he corrects himself, saying that he misspoke and the very last member of a species is the endling. Of their group, the true Endling will be the last one alive and it's that person's life and death that will define them all. Hope starts crying and admits that it bothers her and asks Elton for his spray paint. Hope uses it to spray paint a message onto the signs outside of the park: \"WE WERE HERE - THE ENDLINGS.\"\n\nEntering the bus depot, the group sneaks between the vehicles, but the herd is between them and the exit to the east. As they continue to sneak through the bus depot, the smoke gets a lot thicker, blocking out the sun and making it almost impossible to see, causing the Endlings to get lost. As the herd closes in from all directions, Hope finally spots the fence nearby and they run for it, knocking walkers out of their way. After getting through the fence and blocking it behind them, Iris celebrates that they did it, only for them to find that they have reached the heart of the Blaze with burning tires and more walkers nearby.\n\nThat night, the Endlings stare at the fire and the building on the other side of it with the sounds of walkers growling. Elton guesses that the airfield must be on the other side of the rest of the Blaze and Iris is dismayed that she didn't think of there being a rest of the Blaze before, but Hope points out that none of them saw it because it was behind the smoke. Elton proposes an idea that he knows will be unpopular: one of them can manually sound the old tornado siren on the building roof and create a distraction for the rest of them, hopefully escaping themselves afterwards. Elton admits that he wants to send someone in as bait, but Iris rejects the idea as too dangerous, stating that they all came in together and they will all go out together. Silas wonders how, but Iris has no answer and she admits that Hope was right to question her as she isn't as ready for this as Iris had believed. While Iris had wanted to be brave like her sister, Hope tells her that she's not brave but rather that she's \"a shit person, who does shit things, because I don't give a single shit about anything.\" On the other hand, Iris had the guts to do something big and crazy that meant something to all of them and she should be proud of herself for that no matter what. Hope decides that they should get some sleep and that they will all do better with fresh heads.\n\nLater, while everyone else is sleeping, Hope sits awake, crying and playing with her bead necklace. Spotting the two radios amongst their belongings, Hope takes her pack and S-Pole, covers her face in a handkerchief and walks off alone into the Blaze of Gory.\n\n\"The Tyger and the Lamb\"[]\n\nHope wakes Silas, Iris and Elton up over the radio, announcing that they're doing Elton's plan. Iris refuses to let her, but Hope states that she can get to the factory and sound the siren which is their best chance of getting out alive. Iris points out that they don't know if the tornado siren even works or if they can get it to work and that they had decided against the plan, but Hope states that Iris had decided. Iris pleads for Hope to come back, but Hope tells her that its not so bad further in and jokes that Iris' cooking is worse. Hope refuses Iris' pleas to come back, telling her sister that they knew how it was going to have to be when they left but they did it for their father and this should be her job. Hope suddenly swears and has to go and Iris isn't able to raise her on the radio again.\n\nAfter a few minutes of trying, Iris finally reaches Hope again who explains that for a second there, things had gotten hairy. Hope reveals that she's in an office in front of the factory, one that is a straight shot from the entrance with not too many walkers in the way. From there, Hope will be able to use the siren to clear a path to the exit. Iris orders her to wait and that they are on their way, but Hope tells her sister that she will be gone by the time that they arrive and that they just need to get there. Hope orders Iris to stay put once they get there, wait until she hears the siren and then make a run for the exit where Hope will meet them. Iris tries to get her to wait so that they can go together, but Hope knows that she will move faster and quieter alone and she insists that Iris just needs to trust her. Iris reluctantly agrees to do as Hope wants and Hope tells her that she needs to turn off her radio until it's safe. In goodbye, Hope tells Iris to grin and that she loves her. Iris flips Hope off through the radio and claims to be grinning, but Hope knows that she's lying and gets Iris to grin for real. Hope then shuts off her radio and, after a final look at the walkers moving around outside, grabs her S-Pole and leaves the office.\n\nHope enters the factory, but her flashlight dies as Hope approaches the partially-blocked stairs. As Hope tries to clear the stairs, the noise draws a walker to her, causing Hope to hide out in a nearby supply closet for awhile. Once the walker moves away, Hope opens the door, but she inadvertently draws it back with the noise that she makes. The walker smashes its head through the metal grating on the door and Hope escapes while its head is trapped. Hope quickly clears off the stairs and makes her way to the roof where she finds the tornado siren. However, when Hope tries to test it, the crank handle breaks off.\n\nA little while later, Hope contacts the others and informs them that she found the siren, but the crank was broken so she took the whole thing apart and now she can't figure out how to put it back together again. Iris gives the radio to Felix who demands to know where she is. Hope is surprised to hear from Felix who tells her that Huck is with him too. However, Hope refuses to tell Felix where to find him which would put him in even more danger. Hope resumes work on the siren and tells Felix that the second that she sounds the siren, it'll clear a path for them, but they need to haul ass. Elton is confused by Hope's terminology and, annoyed, Hope orders him to just run to the exit and she promises to meet them there. Hope has Felix give the radio back to Iris and Iris reassures her that she can do this, just like when they were kids. Hope asks Iris to promise not to come back for her if she doesn't make it to the exit in time and Iris makes that promises because she's sure that Hope is going to make it. Hope states that she wishes that she hadn't had a stupid fight with Leo before he left and that while she still wants to find him and see him, she didn't think that they'd be any good to him dead. Iris knows and promises that they will talk about it and make it out of the Blaze and she orders Hope to haul ass to the exit or Iris will kill Hope herself. Agreeing to no goodbyes, Iris flips Hope off again through the radio which Hope appreciates while Elton finally understands what she had meant by haul ass.\n\nAfter putting the siren back together, Hope manages to use a long pole to sound it. Hope's use of the siren draws most of the herd to the factory wall, clearing a path for the others through the Blaze. Once they are clear of the immediate area, Hope abandons the siren and climbs down the fire escape, but falls the last few feet, injuring her leg and slowing her run. Chased by a number of walkers, Hope uses a Zippo lighter to set a trail of melted rubber on fire in order to hold them back. However, as Hope races to catch up with the others, she is attacked by a pair of conjoined walkers and her attempts to fight them off only to result in Hope losing her pack and getting knocked to the ground. Iris comes to her sister's rescue and manages to put one of the walkers down with her weapon, but she struggles with the other one. Grabbing her S-Pole off of the ground, Hope drives it into the second walker's head from behind as Iris pushes it up off of her, putting the walker down. Iris helps her sister towards the exit, assisted by Elton who supports the injured Hope from the other side. However, while putting down a walker, Huck knocks into a wall of tires, causing it to collapse. Silas holds it up while the others rush through the gap between it and the wall next to it. Elton suddenly runs back through for his bag and gets back just in time before the wall collapses, the tires forming a blockade that prevents the herd from following the Endlings any further.\n\nAfter escaping from the Blaze, the Endlings relax on a dock while laying most of their clothes out. Huck approaches Huck and tells the girl that she should've come to her and Hope asks if it's so that Huck could've tried to stop her. With a laugh, Huck asks if that wasn't what Hope had wanted and tells her to think about what she wants as Hope's sister and her friends are all counting on her. Huck takes her coat and walks away as Hope plays with her bead necklace.\n\nLater, as the Endlings eat, Felix approaches and tells them that they should pack up and leave. Iris questions where he wants to go and Felix informs them that they aren't going back through the Blaze and with the other options on foot not being much better, they head up to Omaha and resupply. The group can then return to the Campus Colony with the next transfer in about two weeks. However, Iris refuses to go back and Silas backs her up, telling Felix that this is the fresh start that he had promised him. Felix tells Silas that his uncle is worried sick about him, but while Silas misses his uncle, Silas believes that he's supposed to be out there and his uncle would want him to be where Silas is supposed to be. Elton declares that he's where he's supposed to be too and Hope agrees with the others. Hope tells Felix that if he really wants to keep his promise to their father, he will help the Endlings find him. Leo is in New York and Kublek has given them the map. Felix already knows this, but he's convinced that the Endlings are only going to get themselves killed trying like they nearly did back at the Blaze. Hope implores both Felix and Huck to come with them then, telling Felix that while he keeps saying that there's nothing that he can do to help their dad, he can help the Endlings help him. However, they are going with or without Felix's help or approval. Huck agrees that Hope has a point, telling Felix that they can't turn them around at least for the moment and that all they can do right now is to keep them safe \"till there's something more we can do.\" While he's not happy, Felix reluctantly agrees and walks away.\n\nHope approaches Iris where she's sitting alone on the end of the dock and sits down with her. Iris thanks her sister for having their backs and wonders what changed. Hope guesses that she did and admit that she was scared, but she's tired of being scared. Crying, Hope tells her sister that on the Night the Sky Fell, when their mother died, it wasn't walkers, Iris or people that caused it, but rather Hope herself. Hope admits that even after all of these years, she hasn't told anyone the truth, not even their father and she explains that the pregnant lady that they had seen came back with a gun. The woman was scared and Hope went at her, scaring the woman and causing her to shoot their mother. As Iris stares at Hope in shock, Hope reveals that she picked up the gun and it went off, killing the woman. Sadly, Iris tells Hope that she should've told her, but Hope tells her sister that she didn't want what happened to change Iris or the way that she saw her, but Iris is right and Hope should've told her. Iris admits that she knew that there was something that Hope didn't tell her, but they were just kids that night, the sky was falling and they weren't ready for it, nobody was. Hope apologizes and, crying herself, Iris embraces her, reassuring Hope that they will get through this together before they stand up.\n\nFelix approaches Hope and Iris and tells them that they should go to Omaha as it's where safety is and their dad wants them safe, \"not that either of you seem to care about that at all.\" Felix insists that their plan is a mistake and that they're going to eventually see it, he only just hopes that it won't take one of them getting hurt or worse before that happens. Iris asks if this means that Felix is saying that he's coming with them and with Iris confirming that they're not giving him an option, Felix confirms it, planning to come along at least until he can convince them to change their minds and go back. Felix is sure that he will eventually convince the Endlings to change their minds and Hope apologizes for dragging him into this, but admits that she's glad that he's with them, although Felix doesn't share the sentiment. Hope also apologizes for stealing Felix and Will's jackets even though they look really good on her and Iris. Felix states that they look better on him and Will and leads the Endlings, now including Felix and Huck, in continuing their journey.\n\nHope questions why Elton went back into the Blaze to save his luggage and he explains that it was to save his mother's unfinished manuscript which Elton intends to finish himself. While they both acknowledge that it was kind of irrational for Elton to go back for it, Hope calls it badass as well.\n\n\"The Wrong End of a Telescope\"[]\n\nWalking down a path, Elton tells Iris that based on the coded map that she was given, the Civic Republic Research Facility is somewhere in New York, but she points out that they don't know where exactly it is yet. Felix calls out that it's all the more reason to turn around, but Hope simply calls it a nice try. Iris states that they might've taken a wrong turn, but this path should still lead to the interstate. Felix states that the bad news is that they are almost out of supplies and rain is coming. Huck states that it would've been one thing if the waystation that Will mentioned had panned out, but it didn't. Silas reassures the others that they will figure something out, surprising her with his smiling even in this situation.\n\nElton wonders where the Civic Republic itself is, but Iris points out that it's called the Hidden City for a reason and states that she had always pictured it as being underground. Elton agrees with her, but he points out that they refine their own fuel, fly helicopters and grow their own crops which can't all be done underground. Iris points out their research facility where Leo is located isn't actually where they are and that maybe the Civic Republic does all of that other stuff elsewhere too. Elton states that regardless, the Civic Republic's high resource output suggests that they have a large population, which causes their security approach of not saying where they are is understandable. Hope calls it shady which Elton agrees with along with the fact that the messages from Leo are certainly a cause for concern. However, if the Civic Republic has technology and agriculture and sophisticated governmental systems, it would be smart to stay hidden even if it makes others question their motives. Elton concludes that they should feel lucky that the Civic Republic hasn't taken over or taken things. Hope states that they don't know that, but Felix insists that they do since they trade with the Civic Republic as does Portland and Huck reminds the group of their joint protection agreements. Iris simply states that the CRM has their father and Felix acknowledges that they don't know anything about them at all. \"Ergo the long walk, Champ,\" Hope sarcastically quips to Felix. The others walk ahead of the two adults and Iris finds and breaks the chain on a gate leading into a high school. Felix suggests that a place like this which is hidden from the world could be a good place to find supplies while Huck points out that it could also be a good place to ride out the rain and Iris is excited about the idea of being inside of a real high school for the first time.\n\nSitting in the auditorium, Iris looks in a yearbook at the picture of Sabina James and smiles, lost in thought, before being interrupted by Hope rummaging through the trophy case, breaking the glass on the front in the process. Hope tells her sister that she's trying to see if there was anything useful while they wait for their babysitters to get back, but it turns out that there wasn't much. Elton and Silas enter the auditorium with a large round trophy which Elton says that they can use to collect rain water. Entering, Felix tells the others that the school is huge with no sign of any walkers, but that doesn't mean that there aren't any around. Huck states that their priorities are food, clothes for Hope and anything that they can use to collect water as they can take advantage of the downpour outside for that. Huck agrees that the trophy that Elton and Silas have found is a good idea for catching rain and Iris suggests that they should split up in order to cover more ground. When Felix and Huck hesitate, Iris states that they can handle themselves and she quotes Felix's own words in class right back at him. Amused, Felix agrees and orders Silas to keep his radio on and takes Elton with him to collect water. Hope tries to talk to Iris as they haven't really spoken since the docks and she promises that they can talk later and states that she and Silas will take the first floor. Felix orders the others to keep their eyes open and their weapons drawn and to run if they see any walkers and to be careful. The Endlings split up with Hope pairing off with Huck, although she's not happy that her sister is avoiding her.\n\nWalking through the school's ruined hallways with Huck, Hope rummages through some of the lockers and is amused by a pair of sunglasses that she finds, asking if people had actually worn them. Hope realizes from Huck's grimace that she had worn sunglasses like that too, which Huck refuses to confirm or deny. Hope tosses the sunglasses to Huck who puts them on, puts on a funny face and flashes a peace sign before Hope tells her to stop, embarrassed for her friend, but too hungry to laugh. The two resume walking and Hope begins collecting things from people's lockers while Huck wonders what has changed since the time that they had talked where Hope had believed that the world is ending and that people are shit, but she is now walking through a thousand miles of walkers on just a hunch. Hope ignores the question and plays with some of the clothes that she's found, asking if it's too late to reinvent herself. Huck points out that Hope had left Huck and Felix straight to them and asks if she got roped into the mission or if she had second thoughts. Hope admits to having had second thoughts before having second thoughts about her second thoughts. Huck presses Hope to be straight with her, but Hope refuses to do so until \"cool Huck\" returns since Huck sounds like her dad right now.\n\nIn a flashback, Hope angrily confronts Leo for not showing up in Principal Kallenbach's office despite Hope waiting for him all day. Hope is angry when Leo's response makes it clear that he forgot and Leo explains that he was going to go between classes, but then he came up with the exact right phrase for the start of the Advanced Immunology textbook preface, the one that was giving him all of the trouble. As a result, he forgot about the meeting. After that, Leo had another class and then he thought that if she sat there all day, Hope might think twice before setting off stink bombs to try to get a day off of school. He had then gotten distracted by wondering if it was just a product of the background processes of his brain which had made Leo forget again until right now.\n\nLeo asks Hope what's going on with her since this is getting to be a regular thing with her, but Hope reveals that they weren't just stink bombs but time-release stink bombs that had taken two weeks to perfect. Leo returns to his work without a word and Hope accuses him of kicking himself some days for \"picking a dud like me\" and that he had at least done well with picking Iris. Getting up, Leo tells her daughter that the adoption agency had told Leo and her mother that Hope and Iris had shared a crib and that they were inseparable, bonded before the Bennett’s had ever met them. From the moment that Leo and Kari had laid eyes on them both, they had wanted to protect Hope and Iris and they knew that if they couldn't, that Hope and Iris would protect each other instead. Hope has done well with Iris and vice versa and Leo promises Hope that he has never wished for another Iris and he loves Hope unconditionally, but he hates that Hope doesn't see herself the way that her father does because she is exceptional. Hope leaves with the excuse of helping Iris before her sister burns dinner, but Leo stops her, asking about the composition of her stink bombs. Hope corrects Leo's assumption and while he admits that it wasn't what he would've done, it's not bad. Smiling, Hope leaves without another word.\n\nIn the present, Hope stares at a sign for a fallout shelter and Huck notes that she's seen several outlines like the one around the sign around the school, but that this is the first one with an actual sign attached. Hope wonders if someone had taken down all of the others and Huck suggests that if somebody did, there might be something in the fallout shelter worth hiding and they have a chance at resupplying after all. Huck is excited by the idea while Hope points out that they just have to find it now.\n\nHope and Huck enter a stairwell where Huck bangs on the railing in order to draw out any nearby walkers. With no sign of any, the two begin making their way down the stairs and Hope presses Huck for information on her past, particularly on her dad's reaction to Huck's military service. Huck admits that her father was proud of her, but tells Hope that it's complicated with fathers sometimes as \"they have a funny way of showing that they give a shit sometimes\" which Hope agrees with.\n\nIn a flashback, Leo apologizes to Hope as he gathers things from his office, but tells her that he has to go. Hope argues against her father putting himself in danger who knows where for people that he doesn't even know, but Leo states that the CRM are good people, or they seem to be at least. The Civic Republic shares the same goals as the Campus Colony and they need to trust them. Hope points out that good people would tell you where they are taking you and she accuses her father of not seeing things clearly. However, Leo trusts his brain and his brain is telling Leo that the clear thing is to trust the CRM. Leo feels that any chance he gets to teach emerging minds to train more people in the things that they all need to know is the only way forward. Hope insists that the world that her father is trying to save is over, but Leo tells her that it's not the end because if it was the end, it would be easy, but it's not. Leo is sure that humanity still has a shot and he intends to take it.\n\nTearfully, Hope promises to be better and to stop being a screw up, but Leo reassures his daughter that he isn't going on this trip because of her and that Hope isn't a screw up. However, Hope isn't convinced that she's not a screw up, but Leo tells Hope that she's just frustrated and it's not her fault. Leo has intended to talk to Hope about a lot of things for a long time and he promises that they will talk about them when he gets back. While it's big stuff that he needs to say, Leo promises that it's not bad stuff. Leo brings up how the CRM has said that they can't communicate because the CRM doesn't allow any messages to go in or out before revealing that he's figured out a way around it using a tweak on some old technology. Leo will be sharing it with the Omaha Council when he gets back, but not until then. Leo will show this device to Hope, Iris and Felix, stating that Felix is family too. Hope is impressed that her father has made a communications device and he jokes that he can be bad too. Leo promises Hope that it's gonna be fine and that he loves her more than she'll ever know and the two hug.\n\nIn the present, Hope and Huck emerge on the first floor and Huck tells Hope that the basement steps should be just up ahead. However, the two spot a snarling wolf nearby and Huck orders Hope to get back. Huck goes for her gun, but Hope stops her and the two quickly duck into a nearby classroom. The two observe the wolf through the window and Huck notes that it's standing in a doorway like it's standing guard. Hope wonders if the wolf is defending its young and Huck says that if she's right, she thinks that she knows how they can get around it and to go slow. Emerging from the classroom, Hope and Huck slowly inch their way along the wall and through a grate that Huck closes behind them, separating the two from the wolf. With a last look back, Hope follows Huck down the hallway.\n\nAs they continue searching for the fallout shelter, Hope asks Huck about the whole defending its young thing that she had recognized with the wolf. Huck explains that it was something that she had picked up while being out in the wild for as long as she was and that while it's easy to think that you're reading a situation the right way, sometimes there is something else going on that you have no idea about. Hope knows that this is about Huck trying to get her turn back with all of her earlier questions and Huck states that she should. However, while Hope would've done it a few days before, she now knows that she can't. Hope echoes what Huck had said about dads having a weird way of showing that they give a shit and she suggests that she might've had her dad all wrong. Leo had told her before he left that it wasn't her fault that she was so frustrated and while she had thought at the time that he was just trying to make her feel better, Hope now thinks that Leo might've just been trying to protect her like the wolf was doing with its young. Hope admits that she doesn't know what Leo was trying to protect her from, but she intends to find out when they find him.\n\nCrouching under a half raised sliding door, the two find a door leading into the fallout shelter's pantry which is full of food. However, Huck spots a walker that is missing a leg on the floor and orders Hope to start packing up supplies while she uses her S-Pole to put the walker down. Hope is disgusted when Huck loads up on cans of sardines before they heard Iris calling for help and banging on the locked door leading into the rest of the fallout shelter. Huck begins working on getting the door open while Iris calls out to her sister that they need to get the door open as there are walkers in the shelter and it's about to get bad. Huck promises that they are going to get the two out of there and orders her to hang on. With the help of Felix and Elton, the two get into the fallout shelter just in time to witness Silas beating a walker to death with his bare hands, throwing Elton to the ground in his rage. Felix puts down the other walkers and manages to snap Silas out of his rage. Everyone stares at Silas in shock while Silas, staring at his own shaking hands, apologizes to his friends.\n\nAfter the fight, Iris packs food into her backpack while Hope sits silently nearby, shocked by the events. Iris tells her sister that there is a lot that she missed out on and she starts to suggest that it might've been different had she known or Hope told her, before stopping herself and telling Hope that they should've talked. If they had been honest with each other about what had happened that night, they could've been there for each other which is what they both really missed out on. The sisters interlock their hands before Iris jokingly flips Hope off which she returns.\n\nIn the auditorium, Felix checks that Silas, now cleaned up, is good which he confirms. Patting Silas on the shoulder, Elton reassures his best friend that he is before having the Endlings line up for a group picture together, much to the surprise and teasing of Iris due to Elton only ever using his camera to document things.\n\n\"Madman Across the Water\"[]\n\nElton smiles at a sign for Daiquiritown on the side of the road. As the others walk by him, Iris and Silas, talking and laughing, Elton turns and follows his friends, smiling at Iris and Silas' jovial mood. Elton looks back at Felix who gives him a nod as they continue their journey.\n\nThat night, as the Endlings camp out and Felix and Huck set up protective netting, Elton works on continuing his mother's manuscript. Iris informs Hope that, according to Huck, the U.S. Military had blown up all of the bridge crossings over the Mississippi River when things went bad, meaning that the group will need a boat in order to get across. Huck warns the others that the crossing is going to be tough and the terrain on the other side of the river will be worse than anything that they've encountered so far and asks if they are ready to do this. Recognizing that Huck is once again trying to get them to turn back, Iris and Hope sarcastically agree with her that they aren't ready and that they should turn back. As Huck walks off, the two girls exchange fist bumps in victory while Elton chuckles.\n\nThe next day, as the group continues their journey, Elton takes a picture of a decomposing walker that has plants growing out of it. Walking past a destroyed bridge and half-sunk boats, Hope sarcastically comments on their many options. Reaching the end of the wharf, Elton suggests that the locals had used the boats kept there to evacuate when things got bad and that they are likely looking at the last of them. Iris decides that they will get creative and build their own boat which Hope supports. Felix is incredulous at the idea, but Iris suggests remodeling an old trailer nearby into a boat. While Elton tries to downplay the suggestion, Silas thinks that it could work if they fix it up and add stuff to it while Hope suggests that they can look for parts at a warehouse further north. With everyone else agreeing, the Endlings head for the warehouse, although Felix is visibly unhappy at the idea.\n\nArriving at the warehouse, the group taps on the outside in order to confirm that it's empty of walkers before entering. Hope is discouraged by the state of the warehouse, but Iris isn't quite so pessimistic about their chances of finding anything there. Iris and Hope find a few boxes of nail polish and Iris has the Endlings split up and keep looking for anything that might be useful to them. As Elton searches, he comes across the dead body of a walker against one of the shelves.\n\nAfter completing their search, the group starts going over what they have found: barrels for flotation, straps for binding and fastening, a fan blade that could make a good propellor and a lot of pallets outside that can be broken up for wood as well as a tool box full of tools. Felix points out that they don't have an engine and that without that, they have nothing to fight the river's current. Elton states that there's not much left in the warehouse other than some long-dead batteries, a huge broken air conditioner and a couple of bags of sand. Iris comes up with the idea of using the air conditioner's parts to make some kind of steam boiler like how Hope had created a still back at the Campus Colony. Silas states that the steam boiler would be like the dorm furnaces that he had to fix and Hope figures that it's worth a shot. While Felix remains visibly unhappy, Huck agrees to try out their plan.\n\nOn the banks of the river, the Endlings work together on building their boat using the parts that they have gathered, even Felix despite his reluctance to go along with the plan. Hope tells Elton that working on their boat is making their mission to find her dad really seem possible now, especially because the river is the last big thing in their way and once they cross it it's all downhill from there.\n\nAfter overhearing Felix and Huck discuss Felix's plan and Elton's part in it, Hope angrily confronts Elton about it. Elton admits that he has been working with Felix kind of and Hope flatly rejects to hear Felix out and accuses him of planning to sabotage the boat if he can't change their minds. Elton tells Hope that he's been listening to Felix and a lot of what he's saying about going back makes sense, but Hope angrily reminds him of how Elton had wanted to see the world from start to finish. Felix reveals that he had wanted them to take the boat downriver and then back up the banks of the Missouri River until they reached the Campus Colony. Felix calls this plan safer than cutting through the Blaze and the smartest thing for them right now, reminding Hope that they don't know where they're going, what they're going to do if and when they get there and they don't even know that Leo is really in trouble. Getting heated, Felix suggests that Leo could've sent them ten messages that he's fine since their departure. However, Hope knows that Felix doesn't really believe that last statement. Felix angrily tells Hope that it doesn't matter what he believes as Felix had made a promise to Leo to keep her and Hope safe and that is exactly what he intends to do. Hope accuses Felix of caring more about his promise than Leo's life, leading to an increasingly-heated exchange before Iris breaks it up, telling the two that they don't have time for this as there is still so much left to do. Iris orders them to \"leave your shit at the door, because without each and every one of us giving 100%... we're not making it across that river.\" The argument ends and the Endlings go back to work.\n\nWalking along the banks of the river with Huck looking for a possible source of fuel, Hope sees only driftwood which Huck calls better than nothing and decides to have them grab it all. Hope expresses her anger over the way that Felix messed with Elton's head in order to get them to turn around, but Huck defends Felix and Elton, telling Hope that they were only doing what they thought was best for everybody and that it's not really something that Hope can fault them for. However, Hope isn't willing to let it go, stating that she can fault them for being shady and for what Huck just said too. Hope questions which side Huck is on since she had also overheard Huck talk about calling the plan off. Huck admits that for a long while, she was all for bringing the Endlings back home, but now she's not so sure. \"This thing we're doing right now going across country, is big, maybe the biggest thing we'll ever do\" and it's things like this that makes people stronger and better.\n\nWhen Hope is still unconvinced, Huck brings up how the story that everyone knows of how she got to Omaha in the first place: she was found floating down the Missouri River in a raft with a broken arm, in a messed-up state and not sure if she's coming or going. The next thing that she knows, people are calling her Huck which she doesn't mind, calling her nickname kind of cool. Huck admits that she leaves a lot out of that story such as the days when she didn't know if she was going to live or die and how close Huck came to giving up and letting the water just take her away. However, if she had given up and didn't keep pushing every single moment, she never would've lived long enough to have been found by Omaha Security. Hope apologizes, but Huck waves it off and tells Hope that her experiences have pushed her to be stronger and better and she suggests that this mission might do the same thing for Hope and her friends and maybe even Felix. Hope suggests that Huck should tell him that and Huck reveals that she was about to when Hope interrupted them. Huck thinks that it might not be her place to tell him that, however and he might need to figure it out for himself in his own way.\n\nFelix approaches the two, asking for a word alone with Hope and Huck leaves the two alone. While they both acknowledge that Hope is pissed at Felix, she tells him that she's more pissed at herself for being dumb enough to think that she could turn him over to their side. Hope reveals that she and Iris were extremely excited when Leo first took Felix in as they had thought that that they were going to get a brother. However, Hope states that they didn't get a brother because Felix never acted like one to them. Hope accuses Felix of rejecting every chance that their father had given him to be a real part of the family and seeing Hope and Iris as his problems rather than his sisters. Becoming emotional, Hope tells Felix that all Felix had to do was to be the one to tell Leo not to go and he would've listened as Leo trusts Felix more than anyone. While Hope knows that Felix had his reasons, she had still hoped that he would do something to stop Leo. Stating that the joke's on her and that it's time for her to grow up, Hope walks away, leaving Felix alone.\n\nAs Hope continues to work on the boat, Huck warns that the storm is getting closer and Hope demands to know where Silas and Elton are. Suddenly, smoke pours from the boiler and Hope climbs up on top of the boat to tend to it with Huck. Felix and Iris arrive and begin to tell them something, but Huck tells them that they already know about the lightning storm heading their way real fast. Iris reveals that there's a herd of a couple of dozen walkers heading their way and that they are maybe only fifteen minutes out. Felix tells them that they don't have enough time and that they need to take cover, but Iris warns them that the rising water will wash the boat away and they can't risk that. Hope states that they'll launch before the shit hits, but Iris realizes that Silas and Elton are still missing.\n\nHope, Felix and Huck frantically rush to finish the boat, causing Hope to accidentally cut her hand in the process. Felix gives her a rag to wrap it up with as Silas and Elton finally arrive with the buckets of nail polish. Iris pours the nail polish into the steam boiler, causing the drive belt to begin spinning before fire comes out of the boiler and the drive belt stops moving. Spotting the herd approaching, Felix borrows Elton's fisherman and uses it to string up a makeshift net between two trees, holding back the herd temporarily. Looking under the boat, Iris discovers that the drive belt has come loose and it can only be fixed if someone can fit under the boat and reattach it. Iris turns to Elton, the only one small enough to fit, but he refuses as Elton is claustrophobic. Iris pleads with Elton to do it anyways as it is their only chance. Closing his eyes, Elton remembers cowering, scared, in the box ten years before. Finally, Elton agrees and begins to crawl under the boat with a screwdriver. As Elton fixes the boat, Iris, Hope and Huck briefly join Felix in holding back the herd before Iris and Hope pull Elton free after he gets stuck fixing the boat.\n\nRunning out of time with the herd approaching and their limited fuel, Iris, Hope, Huck, Elton and Silas work together and attempt to push the boat into the river. However, they are unable to move it at all. Feeling that they have no other choice, Hope decides that they need to abandon the boat and make a run for it against Iris' objections, but Felix appears with a plank of wood to use as a lever. As the herd closes in on them, the Endlings successfully launch the boat and set sail across the Mississippi River to Illinois.\n\nThat night, as the Endlings camp, Hope questions why Felix helped them in the end as, if he hadn't, they would've been forced to ditch the boat which would've given Felix more time to turn them around. Gathering food for the group from their supplies, Felix states that it wouldn't have done him any good and Iris and Hope are stubborn as shit. The two share a laugh and Hope tells Felix that Huck thinks that this will be good for them and that it will turn them into the people that they are supposed to be. Observing Huck looking at a map, Felix agrees that they'll see and that it was never just about a promise that Felix had made to Leo. Hope tells Felix that she knows that and that she hadn't left those clues behind just so that Felix would come and turn them around, she was also hoping that he'd join them. However, Felix is with them now which is what matters. Felix approaches Huck and confirms with her that she's alright with their change of plans. Huck promises that they'll keep the group safe and when they find Leo and Will, they'll keep them safe too.\n\nHuck proposes that for now, they divide and conquer and she explains to the group that she's going to spend the next day or two scouting ahead. Their intel is weak for this side of the river and they are only as solid as their intel. Hope is surprised that Huck is going off on her own, but she promises to be back within 48 hours at the most and until then, they are in good hands with Felix. With a pat on the shoulder to Felix, Huck ducks under the netting strung around the camp and leaves on her scouting mission.\n\nHope approaches Elton and asks if he's okay. Shakily, Elton tells Hope that on the Night the Sky Fell, his father had told Elton not to be scared and that he wasn't scared and that Elton shouldn't be either. However, Elton now knows that Isaac was in fact scared, probably more than he'd ever been in his entire life. However, that didn't stop Isaac from doing what needed to be done and he was brave because he was scared, not in spite of it. Putting her hand on Elton's shoulder, Hope tells him that she wishes that she could've met Elton's parents, calling them pretty cool to have had a kid like him. Looking at the picture of his mother, Elton admits that even though he knows that the odds against it are astronomical, he sometimes thinks that his mother is still out there somewhere with his sister Esmerelda, both surviving together. Hope tells him that she doesn't think that its crazy before seeing the picture and realizing that Elton's mother is the woman that she had killed on the Night the Sky Fell.\n\nThe group is disturbed by a branch breaking nearby and Elton and Hope rejoin the group. Believing it to be a walker, Iris goes to take care of it with Hope, Silas and Elton right behind her. However, a boy emerges from the woods instead holding a stick.\n\n\"Shadow Puppets\"[]\n\nAiming his stick at the Endlings, the boy demands that they stay back as Hope tries to get answers from him. The argument turns into a standoff before Felix come up from behind and holds the boy at gunpoint. Felix forces the boy to disarm himself and sends Elton and Silas to check the perimeter just in case there is anyone else with the boy. Iris pats him down for weapons and the boy insists that he was alone and taking a leak in the bushes when he heard voices. Hope asks if his intention was to rob them while Hope determines that the boy is unarmed. Iris asks where his food is, but the boy tells them that he doesn't have anything. Silas and Elton confirm that there are no signs of anyone else and the boy introduces himself as Percy.\n\nIris invites Percy to have something to eat and he tells them a story about two guys that he had met, Mike and Tony, who had robbed Percy a couple of days before. They had gone to a settlement that they'd heard was friendly to newcomers, but they had heard wrong. Hope sarcastically suggests that the people there might've just not liked Percy, but Percy ignores her and explains that they had found a place to camp out and when he woke up, Mike, Tony and his stuff were all gone. Percy thinks that they are in Andersonville down the road and he intends to go there and get his stuff back. Felix suggests that Percy just be grateful that they left him with his life and move on, but Percy responds that \"this isn't a vigilante type deal and it ain't about the principle of it all either. Some things just can't be replaced\" which Elton understands.\n\nAside from Felix and Silas, the Endlings sit around the campfire and Percy tells them a story about a time in Wyoming during a snow storm when he got caught by a herd on an overpass and, unable to run away climbed on top of a car and closed his eyes, waiting for the end. However, the herd turned out to be of 200 bison rather than walkers which was the most beautiful thing that Percy had ever seen. The Endlings, Iris in particular, are enamored by Percy and his stories and Percy mentions another time when he saw a Ferris Wheel in the spring in Orlando that had been turned into a pelican nest.\n\nHope becomes suspicious of Percy's story, wondering how he had gotten from Wyoming to Florida in just a couple of months. Percy quickly tries to claim that he misspoke, but as Felix and Silas rejoin them, Hope accuses Percy of lying about someone stealing his supplies and, as Iris and Felix try to calm her down, she accuses Percy of having his car stolen which instead which is what he really wants back. After a moment of silence, Percy finally explains that a year before, he had found a truck that had skidded onto the ice. The accident must've just happened since the engine was still warm and the driver was becoming a walker. Silas asks why Percy had lied and he explains that it's not just a working truck, it's one that's carrying barrels of refined fuel which is worth a lot in the current world.\n\nIris offers Percy a deal: the Endlings help him to get his truck back and Percy drives them where they need to go. Felix believes that it's too risky, but Iris points out that with the truck, they will get there in half the time and they can avoid walkers and running out of supplies. Hope suggests that they wait for Huck to return as backup, but Iris points out that Mike and Tony could be gone by then. Iris believes that the six of them together can overpower the two men and although Felix is worried that they might have guns, Percy states that he had never seen any guns with them. Silas worries that they will have to hurt Mike and Tony or get hurt in return, but Elton states that they have the element of surprise on their side which will give them an advantage. Percy questions how he knows that they won't just steal his truck and leave him in the dust, but Iris promises that they won't which Silas reinforces. However, Percy is skeptical as that doesn't mean much out here. Iris pleads with Percy, telling him that they need to get where they're going fast and it could be the difference between their dad living and dying. Felix points out that if they had wanted to steal Percy's truck, they would just do it with or without his help, reminding Percy that he's already told them where to look. Felix proposes that at dawn, they go and find the truck.\n\nIn the morning, Elton spray paints a message for Huck on the Endlings' boat telling her that they will be back soon. As they walk, Elton takes a picture of something on the ground and writes in his mother's manuscript. Looking at Amelia's picture, Hope asks what she was like and Elton tells Hope that Amelia was great, describing how she would sometimes sing as she made breakfast despite being terrible at it. Hope is surprised to find out that Elton is named after Elton John, calling the singer an icon. Elton considers his mother to be the coolest, her manuscript having helped Elton to get to know her. Elton explains that Amelia had seem death and decay as no better or worse than any other part of the life cycles and she wasn't afraid of it. Hope asks what Elton intends to do with the manuscript once he finishes it and Elton states that he'd like to pass it on so that it can help somebody with the big questions, help to make them less confused and alone just like it had done for Elton. In that way, Amelia will never be forgotten and Hope offers to help Elton finish it which, although surprised, Elton accepts.\n\nThe group reaches Andersonville where, hiding beside a building, Felix spots a curtain blowing in a nearby window before Percy's truck comes down a nearby street and passes in front of them. Percy confirms that it's his truck and the Endlings follow after it. Observing where the truck has been parked, the group discusses possible options and, while Felix wants to get eyes on both men before they move in, Percy just wants to smash and grab it back, stating that even without the keys, he can still hotwire the truck. Silas objects to doing this at all and Hope states that they need to make a decision either way. Felix decides to have the rest of the group stay in their hiding spot while he covers Percy.\n\nPercy and Felix make their way to the truck and, as Percy opens the door, Felix keeps a lookout. Percy suddenly swears and reveals the body of Tony in the front seat. Percy and Felix pull Tony's body from the truck and place him nearby with Percy suggesting that the bickering between Tony and Mike had gotten much worse. Percy discovers that a plate has been bolted over the ignition wires and he begins searching for the keys in the truck and on Tony's body as the rest of the group joins them. Percy is unable to find the keys, but he retrieves a knife from Tony's body and insists on getting the keys back from Mike, stating that he's going to get the keys back with or without their help. While Hope and Felix want to go back to the campsite, Iris decides to go and help Percy. After Iris refuses to relent, Felix gives Iris his bag and decides to go in her place. Elton suggests keeping a lookout at the front of the building in case Mike isn't there and he decides to come back. Hope changes her mind and decides to come with Elton and Felix as backup while they leave Iris and Silas behind to look after their gear.\n\nFinding a clothing store to be the only one not boarded up, Felix orders the other two to stay outside while he enters and meets up with Percy. While they wait, Hope argues that they were doing fine on foot, \"slow and sore, but fine.\" Elton points out that anything that gets them to Leo faster is worth it. Elton reveals to Hope that he had actually met Leo before he left for the research facility, having gone to ask him if Leo would read Amelia's writing which he did. To Hope's surprise, Elton states that Leo was the one to encourage him to finish the manuscript and that even though Leo had never met his mother, he admired her research. Leo had kind of reminded Elton of Amelia in the similarities between the little things that Elton doesn't want to forget. Hope begins to tell Elton something, but she changes her mind and merely states that they should focus instead of talking.\n\nEveryone is shocked to suddenly hear a gunshot and Elton suggests that Felix might've found Mike. As Tony drives off in the truck, Silas runs towards Elton and Hope yelling that Tony had stolen their bags. Hope chases after the truck, but she fails to catch up to it as Percy jumps in the back and escapes. Hope hears Iris calling for help from a nearby dumpster and reassures her sister that Felix and Silas are on their way to help before becoming concerned when Iris suddenly stops responding. While Felix, Elton and Silas use Silas' Wrench to break into the dumpster's enclosure, Hope does her best to keep Iris calm. With a herd approaching, Felix orders Silas and Elton to hold them off while he manages to open up the dumpster and put down one of the walkers attacking Iris. Percy suddenly returns and saves Iris from the second one while Tony returns in the truck, running over several walkers and yelling at the Endlings to get in. The group quickly jumps in the back of the truck and Tony drives off as the herd closes in, running over the head of a fallen walker in the process.\n\nAfter reaching safety, the Endlings confront Percy and Tony about their con. Percy admits that they did in fact con them, but he states that they came back to help them when they saw the herd coming. Hope argues for just taking the truck and leaving Percy and Tony to the walkers, but Tony angrily reminds them that they had just saved their lives, explaining that when they saw the herd coming, Percy, who is his nephew, had him turn around. Felix asks if they should just be grateful that the two grifters had changed their minds, but Tony states that \"out here, that's pretty much as good as it gets.\"\n\nLater, the Endlings sit around their campfire where Tony displays a magic trick to them, much to the amazement of Elton, Silas and Felix while Iris is despondent over the events. Hope asks if Tony is just a professional scammer and Tony introduces himself in a grandiose fashion as Tony Delmado, the resident illusionist at the Paradise Lounge in Las Vegas for fifteen years. Tony is impressed with Elton's knowledge of magic and tells everyone that he had dabbled in a lot of things including illusions, card tricks and ventriloquism, the latter of which comes in handy with the state of the world as it is. As far as Tony is concerned, he's still in show business: for a small fee at friendly settlements Percy and Tony will perform which is why his makeup job to look dead is flawless. Hope asks if Percy is Tony's protegee and he explains that Tony had raised him after Percy's mom took off. Tony calls Percy a quick study who was grifting kids in the sandbox and Percy tells everyone that it's how they get what they need without hurting anyone. Upset, Iris sarcastically tells them that they deserve medals or something and leaves.\n\nAs Elton picks up his mother's book, Iris tells him that she'd love to read it sometime if Elton will let her. Elton is surprised and tells Iris that he might be the only person left in the world who knew and saw Amelia, but at least now someone else will know her too. Elton gives Hope the book and, after staring at Amelia's picture for a moment, she walks away with it.\n\nThat night, Iris leans against Hope as Percy and Tony set up a shadow puppet show, but she is still obviously upset when she sees Percy. Watching Percy, Silas comments to Felix that some people make it look easy starting over. Iris admits to Hope that she wishes that she knew which part of Percy is the lie and which is real, but Hope calls Percy the same as them, everyone having parts that they want people to see and other parts that they want to hide, but it's all real. Percy and Tony put on a show depicting the end of the world which the Endlings enjoy, although they grow somewhat more somber and Hope starts silently crying as the story gets sadder and sadder.\n\n\"Truth or Dare\"[]\n\nReturning from her scouting mission, Huck notices Hope sitting on some nearby stairs holding Amelia's manuscript and watching Tony teach Elton a magic trick. Huck smiles as she watches Tony and Elton, but her smile drops as she turns and looks at where Hope is watching them.\n\nThat night, Tony dramatically presents a CRM map to the Endlings which has no landmarks designated or points of interest labeled. While the map, to all appearances, looks to be useless, looks can be deceiving. Percy brings his uncle a wooden box with a few plastic squares and Tony holds one up, explaining that when Percy first discovered them in the truck, they had reminded Tony of the colored lenses that he used in his Prism of Light illusion. As a result, Tony has discovered that you set the squares up at proper distances, shine a beam of light through them and symbols appear on the map, in this case, oil drops, which Tony identifies as hidden CRM fuel caches and all of the gas that they need. Percy adds that the ones that he and Tony have hit so far have mostly just been shacks with landing pads and they were all unmanned and unguarded where helicopters touch down, refuel and take off again. Huck is excited, stating that she can't believe it, while Iris becomes intrigued.\n\nLater, the Endlings gather around the table where Iris shows them the CRM map that Kublek had given to her and Hope before they left the Campus Colony. While some of the markings on the decoder overlays didn't form symbols on Tony's map, when she tries them on this map, they do. Iris points to a symbol on the map that Elton recognizes as a DNA strand. Felix realizes that Iris thinks that it's the research facility and she asks him what else it could be. Hope is excited that they now know where to find their father and while Silas smiles at first, he gets upset and jealous when he sees Iris and Percy smiling at each other.\n\nUpstairs, Percy offers Elton, Silas, Hope and Iris a drink which everyone but Silas accepts. Hope calls it not as good as her own, but agrees that they should party. Taking seats in a circle, Percy gives Iris some gloves for her cold hands and suggests that they play truth or dare. When Iris chooses truth, Percy asks what she would do right now if she could and Iris responds that she would hit the Louve and see some good art, but Percy fakes falling asleep out of boredom as Iris starts to go into more detail. Laughing, Iris insists that the Louve has the best art in the world, and, although she knows that it probably isn't even standing anymore and that even if it were, she doubts that she'd ever get to see it, Iris still dreams of going there which Percy calls fair enough. The Endlings, aside from Silas, share a toast to dreaming and never saying never while Silas only just watches Iris and Percy.\n\nAs the game continues, Hope chooses truth and Percy interjects to ask her what the worst thing that Hope has ever done is. Defensively, Hope asks what kind of a question it is and points out that it isn't even Percy's turn. Percy presses her and, taking a drink, Iris tells him that back at the university, she locked the faculty bathroom and spiked the teachers' coffeemaker with laxatives. Everyone but Percy laughs with Iris confirming that Hope really did do that. However, Percy isn't satisfied and he asks Hope for the truth and while she insists that it is the truth, Percy doesn't buy it, asking if Hope thinks that she can con a conman. Percy continues to press Hope and Silas angrily orders him to stop. Having had enough, Hope tells Percy that the worst thing that she's ever done is agree to play the game and she storms off, followed by Elton. Percy insists that he was just playing around and Iris tells him that Hope knows.\n\nCatching up to Hope in the stairwell, Elton stops her and admits that it is just a stupid game and he starts to explain why he was playing before stopping himself and hugging Hope instead. Hope thanks Elton, but tells him that she thinks that Elton is drunk and she just needs to be alone before walking away while Elton returns to the others.\n\nHuck is joined on the roof by Hope whom she chastises for being on the roof drunk and at all. Hope asks what Huck is doing up there and she returns the question, knowing that something has been bothering Hope ever since the Blaze. Hope tearfully reveals that she had killed someone on the Night the Sky Fell and that she didn't know who she was, that the woman was afraid that Hope's mom was going to take her truck. The woman freaked out and shot Kari before dropping the gun after which Hope picked it up and it went off, killing her and her unborn child. Hope reveals that the woman was Elton's mother and Huck tries to comfort Hope, telling Hope that she was just a kid and Amelia had killed her mom in front of her. Hope tells Huck that Elton doesn't know and that while Iris knows, she doesn't know that it was Elton's mom. Huck tells her that they shouldn't know and that they can't change the things that they've done, they can only carry the truth for everybody else so that they don't have to. Hope asks Huck how to do this, but Huck doesn't know, telling her that some nights it can get \"so damn dark\" and then somehow, it can get even darker. However, Huck promises her that the light will eventually come.\n\nThe next day, the Endlings drive to the CRM fuel depot where Hope, Iris, Felix, Huck, Percy and Tony stand outside of the entrance while Silas and Elton wait by the truck. Tony tells the others that there is a stash of refined CRM fuel just ripe for the taking somewhere inside and Huck notes that it's a big place, deciding that they will split up, start at the bottom and work their way up. Felix asks if these places are clear of walkers which Percy confirms as far as they can tell since the CRM keeps their things locked up pretty tight. However, this isn't a problem for them as Percy, Tony and Felix are good at lockpicking. Iris tells the others that they should still stay alert nevertheless and they head out with Hope taking a moment to look back at Silas and Elton.\n\nPaired up together, Huck asks if Hope is still going to talk to Elton. Hope tells Huck that she's finished Amelia's book and Amelia was smart and kind and Hope thinks that she just got scared and did a bad thing. Hope suggests that if she can forgive Amelia, then maybe Elton can forgive Hope for what she did. However, Huck questions if this is about Elton or Hope herself, telling Hope that the truth can be a funny thing and that while people say that's what they want, it isn't. Hope asks if they are just stuck living a lie, but Huck states that if people don't know that they're living a lie, then they just live. They pay the cost, but the people they are lying to get to live because of them. Huck then continues walking, leaving Hope behind for a moment.\n\nHuck notices that Hope has disappeared and, with Hope not answering her calls, Huck draws her gun and begins looking for her friend. Huck finds Walter holding a terrified Hope hostage with a gun to her head and he demands that Huck drop her gun. Huck puts her gun away and advances on Walter, trying to calm him down, but he demands that she stop. Huck agrees and notices a wound on Walter's leg, asking what happened to it. However, Walter refuses to answer, stating that he asks the question and calling Huck one of the people with the helicopters, demanding to know how many more there are. Huck lies that it's just her and Hope and that they are just scavenging, but Walker accuses her of lying since both Hope and Huck have the CRM symbol on their jackets. Huck again asks what happened to Walter's leg and if the dead had taken a bite out of it.\n\nShaking a terrified and crying Hope, Walter tells her to shut up and that this place is \"ours\" and that the CRM had come and taken it and they took it back. Huck insists that they didn't take anything and that she's not a part of the CRM. Noting that Walter doesn't look too good, Huck tries to get him to talk about it and, calming down a little bit, Walter tells her that he doesn't know what happened: he woke up and his brother had somehow died and turned and bit him. Walter stabbed him and his brother is now dead in the next room. Huck tells Walter that he won't last much longer with his leg, but when Huck moves towards him again, Walter again threatens to shoot Hope. Huck introduces herself and Hope, stating that they are just passing through and asks for Walter's name. Walter finally introduces himself and Huck promises that she can help him, but first he has to let Hope go. Walter refuses and Huck tells him that Walter didn't let her finish: once Hope is free, he can train his sights on her. Hope protests, but Huck tells Walter that Hope is just a kid and harmless and he should focus on her. Walter finally releases Hope and trains his gun on Huck who tells him that they now need to talk about how they are going to save him, but Walter believes it to be impossible. However, Huck tells Walter that they can do it and to trust her.\n\nHuck tells Walter that she's going to have to take his leg before his infection spreads any further. However, Walter tells Huck that it's been too long and that she shouldn't be there and maybe none of them should be. Walter apologizes, telling Huck that it's not personal, but Huck tells him that if he shoots her, Walter will take his life with that bullet too. Hesitating, Walter asks if Huck can really help him and Huck states that she's seen people survive amputations hours after infection. Walter again accuses Huck of lying, but she insists that she's not.\n\nHuck notices just how much Walter is swaying and soothingly tells him that his gun is getting heavy and that no one would blame him for dropping it. Walter tells Huck that it wasn't supposed to go this way and, having slowly made her way closer to Walter while they were talking, Huck grabs him and disarms Walter, holding him from behind. Huck soothes a crying Walter who asks if she can save him and Huck says that she can save him. Huck shoots Walter in the head, killing him. Horrified, Hope tells Huck that she said that she could save him, but Huck tells Hope that it's time for Hope to forgive herself. Hope has a future and she has to see that now. Iris, Felix, Percy and Tony rush in and ask what happened, but Hope simply tells them that Huck saved her. Huck tells the others that Walter had radios and supplies while Felix reveals that they found the fuel. Flipping through some notebooks, Tony states that they found something else too locked in a cabinet. Percy asks what they are and Tony calls them something to potentially work with.\n\nOutside of a recreation center, Hope and Iris look through the notebooks at the various codes and Hope asks if Iris thinks that they might be encrypted CRM lunch orders. Iris chuckles. stating that if they can crack this, it can tell them more about the CRM and maybe help their chances of saving Leo when they get to him. Hope with Iris' maybe and Iris tells her sister that it feels like they're changing and that it's just the start.\n\nLater, Iris stops Silas in the hallway, telling him that Tony has something that he wants to say to the group. Tony announces that after talking it over with Felix, he and Percy have decided to extend the terms of their agreement with the others. Percy states that instead of just dropping them off, he and Tony want to stick around and do what they can to help them find Leo. Felix orders everyone to get some sleep as they leave first thing in the morning and Tony heads off to charge up the radios and top off the tank while Hope and Iris hold each other's hands for a moment. Percy asks Iris to see her by the truck in an hour, telling her that it's just gonna be him there and that he needs to get his gloves back. Iris tries to give Percy back his gloves immediately, but he claims that his hands aren't cold now but that they will be in about an hour. Iris agrees and she walks off while Silas watches jealously and eyes Percy's liquor.\n\nAs everyone goes their own separate ways, Elton apologizes to Hope for what had happened to her earlier, telling her that it means everything to him that she's still alive and there with them. Elton then successfully pulls off the magic trick that Tony had taught him, cheering Hope up a bit. Hope returns Amelia's manuscript to Elton and thanks him for sharing it with her, stating that his mother seems like she was an amazing woman. Elton agrees that she was and he suggests that she might still be as everything is possible. Hope half-heartedly agrees and, after a look at a watching Huck, Elton leaves.\n\nHope approaches Huck outside and tells Huck that she was right and that telling Elton the truth would be for Hope's benefit, not his and the truth would just crush him. Huck calls Hope a good person and Hope shows Huck her bead necklace, revealing that she took from Elton's mother after killing her and she asks if Huck still thinks that she's a good person. Huck tells Hope that she knows that Hope is and that her necklace proves it. Remembering scarring her own face in the same way that Drake's face was scared, Huck knows that Hope took it as a reminder, something that she wears every day, to remember the bad that she's done, a reminder to keep living to do good as that's the only way to make the bad mean something. Huck promises Hope that she's going to be okay and they hug.\n\nAwhile later, looking for Percy, Iris finds Tony with his head bashed in in one of the bathrooms. Calling for help, Iris notices Silas' Wrench lying bloody next to Tony's dead body and a trail of blood leading to a broken window that she realizes must've come from Percy. Felix runs in and stares at Tony's body in shock while Hope, Elton and Huck run in and join them. Drawing his gun and having Huck cover him, Felix makes his way to where somebody is visible in a stall. Opening the door, Felix is shocked to find Silas passed out with a bottle of liquor next to him and covered in blood. Silas wakes up and looks silently at Felix.\n\n\"The Sky Is a Graveyard\"[]\n\nAs Silas sits tied up outside, Hope, Iris, Elton, Felix and Huck argue about Silas' culpability in Tony's murder and Percy's disappearance. Iris insists that someone else must've been responsible and that Silas isn't a murderer, but Huck points out that they've seen Silas lose control before and that Silas was drunk, blacked out and woke up covered in Tony and Percy's blood. Iris argues that Silas could've stumbled on Tony and Percy just like them, but Felix states that Silas has told them that he doesn't remember. While Felix believes Silas, they have to look at the hard facts: Silas was angry and he didn't like Percy. Iris points out that Tony and Percy were grifters who must've had enemies and she suggests that someone that they had ripped off came back for revenge. However, Huck informs Iris that they have turned the recreation center upside down and found no sign that anyone else was ever there and if someone was, they would've taken Tony and Percy's things. In contrast, Silas was found passed out at the scene, his wrench covered in Tony's blood. While Hope doesn't want to believe it either, she reminds Iris that Huck is right and they've seen Silas lose it before and they've all heard the stories about Silas' dad. Elton sides with Iris, telling the others that Silas is their friend and he has earned their trust. Elton believes that there must be another explanation of some kind such as wild animals or marauders even. Iris states that they never found Percy's body and he may still be alive and need their help and Elton hopes that Percy could tell them what actually happened. However, Felix states that they had searched for Percy for hours and only found a trail of blood that had stopped at the river. Even if Percy had survived his injuries, Felix doesn't think that Percy could fight the current and has most likely drowned. Elton questions why Silas would attack the people that were trying to help them and Huck states that she has an idea of why and leaves the room. Returning inside, Huck starts going through Silas' belongings against Elton's protests. Huck pulls out several drawings, telling the others that she had seen them when they were camped out a few nights before and that it wasn't her business until now. While Elton is confused by the significance of the drawings, Iris recognizes them as her own.\n\nHope and Iris look at the drawings which Hope finds messed up since Iris had thrown them away and Silas had dug through their trash for them, but Elton reminds Hope that as a janitor, it was Silas' job. Iris agrees with Elton, stating that it doesn't have to mean anything. Hope points out that Silas liked Iris and that they could all see it as well as the growing romance between her and Percy. Hope suggests that Silas was jealous of Percy and Elton argues that they should put the drawings back, stating that even if they weren't important to Iris, they were to Silas, enough so that he had brought them with him on their journey.\n\nLater, Huck digs a grave for Tony's body outside and is approached by Hope. Huck warns Hope that Felix will be pissed if he knows that she's out there, but she doesn't care, stating that she was looking for Elton. Hope then joins Huck in digging Tony's grave, giving a brief look at the wrapped corpse. Hope grows frustrated digging into the frozen ground, recalling how she barely knew Tony, he'd tried to steal all of their stuff and was \"kind of a dick, actually,\" but acknowledges that Tony was alright. Huck states that Tony was a mixed bag like everybody else, including Silas and tells Hope to feel how she wants to feel about it, but to keep asking herself how to serve the greater good which is how you stay focused. Hope refutes this, telling Huck that she's got the wrong sister as Iris has always been the good one. However, Huck corrects Hope that she's talking about the greater good which isn't always about right or wrong but about doing what's best for everybody even when you know it's gonna hurt. With everyone wanting to reach the research facility and help Leo, every choice has to be about making it there. \"Sometimes what's painful in the moment... is what gets you where you need to go.\" Dropping her shovel, Huck goes to get Tony's body, stating that the grave is now deep enough. The two women then finish burying Tony's body.\n\nAs Iris goes through the CRM codebooks alone, she is joined by Hope. Iris admits that while she had thought that cracking the codes would be a good distraction, all it does is remind Iris that nothing makes sense. Hope informs Iris that she and Huck had buried Tony and left markers for him and Percy. Iris states that even with Silas' blackout and the blood, she still believes that Silas is innocent. Hope reminds Iris that she can't know what someone is capable of and that Iris didn't know what Hope was capable of. Iris tries to defend Silas by stating that one mistake doesn't make him a bad person, but Hope states that Silas didn't just make one mistake and she wonders how many chances they will get. They know where Leo is now and they are so close and Hope insists that they can't let anyone stand in the way of that. Iris wants to believe Silas and she feels that if he did do it, she should've seen it coming and she should've known.
