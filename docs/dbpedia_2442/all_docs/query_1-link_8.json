        "text": "There has been another earthquake somewhere in the state of Maryland! Where? And how big?\n\nThe following seismic stations have recorded disturbances. To retrieve data click on the station and then click on the data file.\n\nAll data files contain information recorded at 50 Hz, or 50 data points per second. All data points represent displacements in millimeters. Vertical data corresponds to movement in the vertical direction (along a radius of the earth.) Horizontal data are movements in a plane tangent to the surface of the earth. Horizontal data are available for both the North / South Direction and the East / West direction. North is a positive displacement. In practice, one of these seismographs will show larger disturbances than the other.\n\nWhen you click on the appropriate city/town below, you will be shown a directory of three files for your site. The file with a V at the end is for vertical displacement. The other two files are horizontal displacements: NS at the end indicates a north-south orientation while EW indicates the EW data. Clicking on each file will give you a text file of the data which you can copy. Technically, you only need one file to determine the distance and magnitude.\n\nCity or TownLatitude/LongitudeSchool Accident, MD39.62 N 79.32 WNorthern High School Baltimore, MD39.33 N 76.60 WBaltimore City College Centreville, MD39.05 N 76.07 WQueen Anne's High School Crofton, MD39.00 N 76.69 WCrofton Middle School Gambrills, MD39.07 N 76.68 WArundel High School Havre de Grace, MD39.55 N 76.10 WHavre de Grace High School IndianHead,MD38.60 N 77.17 WLackey High School NorthEast, MD39.60 N 75.94 WNorth East High School Salisbury, MD38.37 N 75.60 WJames Bennett High School Silver Spring, MD39.01 N 77.03 WMontgomery Blair High School Smithsburg, MD39.65 N 77.56 WSmithsburg High School Williamsport, MD39.60 N 77.82 WWilliamsport High School"
