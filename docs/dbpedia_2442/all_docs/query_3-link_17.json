        "text": "UNIT 1: STUDYING EARTH\n\nThe study of Earth and the processes and forces that change it, the materials from which it is made, its history, and its place in the universe is called Earth Science.\n\nThe four major areas of specialization are:\n\nAstronomy – the study of objects beyond Earth’s atmosphere.\n\nMeteorology – the study of the body of gases that surrounds Earth.\n\nGeology – the study of the materials that make up Earth and the processes that form and change them.\n\nOceanography – the study of Earth’s oceans.\n\nEARTH'S SYSTEMS\n\nEarth’s four major systems that are in constant interaction are:\n\nAtmosphere – Layers of gases surrounding the Earth\n\nHydrosphere – Layer of liquid water between the atmosphere and the upper layer of Earth’s interior\n\nLithosphere – The layer of rock that forms the solid outer shell at the top of the earth’s interior.\n\nBiosphere – All the organisms on Earth as well as the environments in which they live.\n\nTHE ATMOSPHERE\n\nThe atmosphere is the body of gases that surrounds the Earth. It extends approx. 560 km (350 miles) from the surface of the Earth.\n\nORIGIN OF THE ATMOSPHERE\n\nEarth’s early atmosphere was believed to have originated from outgassing by erupting volcanoes.\n\nThe volcanoes vented mostly water vapor, carbon dioxide and nitrogen.\n\nMost water vapor ended up in the oceans. Most of the CO2 was absorbed by plants that gave off oxygen and by the oceans.\n\nLAYERS OF THE ATMOSPHERE\n\nTroposphere:\n\nDensest atmospheric layer\n\nContains most of the mass of the atmosphere\n\nContains 99% of the water vapor\n\nWater vapor concentration is greatest at equator and lowest near poles\n\nMost weather phenomena take place in troposphere\n\nTemperature decreases as altitude increases\n\nStratosphere:\n\nContains much less water vapor\n\nGases are much less dense\n\nTemperature rises as altitude increases in upper stratosphere\n\nOzone molecules form the ozone layer in the upper ranges of stratosphere\n\nMesosphere:\n\nContains very little ozone\n\nContains very little water vapor\n\nTemperature decreases as altitude increases\n\nLow density of molecules\n\nThermosphere:\n\nGas molecules are widely separated\n\nVery low gas density\n\nAbsorption of the most solar radiation\n\nTemperature increases with altitude\n\nEARTH'S SHAPE\n\nEarth is spheroidal (an oblate spheroid): Flattened at the poles and bulging at the equator.\n\nEVIDENCE OF EARTH'S SHAPE\n\n1. Ships appear to sink below the horizon as they move away from the shore\n\n2. Eclipses (The earth throws a circular shadow on the moon during a lunar eclipse)\n\n3. Photographs taken from space\n\n4. Measurements of Gravity – The similarity of the strength of gravity at sea level all over the Earth’s surface. (If the earth were flat, the force of gravity would slant obliquely towards its center of gravity as one moved towards the edges )\n\n5. Observations of the altitude of Polaris – the North Star (when traveling northward, stars such as Polaris, the north star, are higher in the sky)\n\nEARTH'S MEASUREMENTS\n\nPolar Diameter: 12,714 km\n\nEquatorial Diameter: 12,756 km\n\nAverage Diameter: 12,735 km\n\nPolar Circumference: 40,008 km\n\nEquatorial Circumference: 40076 km\n\nTHE METRIC TABLE\n\nLength\n\n10 millimeters (mm) = 1centimeter (cm)\n\n10 cm = 1 decimeter (dm)\n\n100 cm = 1 meter (m)\n\n1000 m = 1 kilometer (km)\n\nMass\n\n1000 micrograms (mcg) = 1 milligram (mg)\n\n1000 mg = 1 gram (g)\n\n1000g = 1 kilogram (kg)\n\nVolume\n\n1 milliliter (ml) = 1 cubic centimeter (cm3)\n\n1000 ml = 1 liter (L)\n\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION\n\nWhen converting a larger unit to a smaller unit, the decimal moves to the right.\n\nWhen converting a smaller unit to a larger unit, the decimal moves to the left.\n\nOne inch = 2.54 cm\n\nOne m = 39.4 inches\n\nOne km = 0.62 miles\n\nUNITS OF MEASUREMENT IN EARTH SCIENCE\n\nLength- the meter (m)is the standard unit of length (measured with a ruler).\n\nMass – the amount of matter in a object [measured with a balance in units called milligrams (mg), grams (g), kilograms (kg), etc.].\n\nArea - the amount of surface included within a set of boundaries and is expressed in square units of length (for example, cm2, m2, km2).\n\nVolume – the amount of space an object occupies (measured in ml, cm3, m3, km3, etc.).\n\nDensity – the amount of matter that occupies a given area (D = M/V). Units are in g/cm3 or g/ml.\n\nNormally, solids are denser than liquids, and gases are the least dense (ice is an exception to this rule).\n\nAny object with a density less than 1 g/cm3 will float when placed in water.\n\nThe same substance will have the same density value regardless of its size.\n\nWhen the volume of a gas increases due to an increase in temperature or a decrease in pressure, the density will decrease.\n\nRate of Change – Change in value per unit of time (change in value divided by time).\n\nTo solve a rate of change problem from a graph, choose 2 different positions along the Time axis (x-axis) and from these positions move directly up until the intersection with the graph line.\n\nRead over to the y-axis to obtain their values.\n\nSubtracting these two values, will give the “change in value.” Use the time difference you selected, substitute into the equation and solve for the rate of change.\n\nLOCATING POSITIONS ON EARTH\n\nThe latitude-longitude coordinate system is commonly used to locate points on Earth. Latitude & longitude are measured in angular units:\n\nDegrees (o)\n\nMinutes (‘)\n\nSeconds (”)\n\n60 minutes equal 1 degree\n\n60 seconds equal 1 minute\n\nLatitude lines (called parallels) run in an East-West direction\n\nLongitude lines (called Meridians) run in a North-South direction\n\nMEASURING LATITUDE\n\nThe latitude of a point on Earth’s surface is its angular distance North or South of the equator.\n\nThe fixed reference point for latitude is the equator – zero degrees latitude\n\nEach degree of latitude is equivalent to about 111km on Earth’s surface (circumference divided by 360 degrees – 40,000 km/ 360 = 111 km)\n\nEach minute of latitude is 1.85 km (111 km divided by 60)\n\nThe highest degrees of latitude are 90 degrees N at the North Pole and 90 degrees S at the South Pole.\n\nMEASURING LONDITUDE\n\nLongitude is the angular distance east or west of the Prime Meridian, the meridian of zero degrees longitude.\n\nThe highest degree of longitude east or west of the Prime Meridian is 180 degrees (the International date Line).\n\nSince Earth makes one complete rotation in 24 hours, in one hour, Earth rotates 15 degrees (360/24).\n\nThe 180th meridian, the International Date Line, is half the distance around the Earth.\n\nThe half of the world that is west of the prime meridian has west longitude.\n\nThe half of the world that is east of the prime meridian has east longitude.\n\nTIME ZONES\n\nEarth is divided into 24 time zones (it takes 24 hrs to complete one rotation). Since Earth rotates at 15 degrees per hour, each time zone is 15 degrees wide.\n\nThere are 6 different time zones in the United States.\n\nEach time you travel through a time zone you gain or lose time.\n\nThe International Date Line or the 180-degree meridian is the transition line for calendar days.\n\nIf you were traveling west across the International Date Line, you would advance your calendar one day.\n\nIf you were traveling east, you would move you calendar back one day.\n\nTERRESTRIAL NAVIGATION\n\nNavigation is the science of identifying your position on Earth.\n\nThe latitude of any location north of the equator is almost equal to the angle of Polaris (the North Star’s altitude) above the horizon.\n\nIn the southern hemisphere, early navigators used the Southern Cross as their points of reference.\n\nDETERMINING THE LONGITUDE OF A POINT\n\nFirst determine the time at the prime meridian (Greenwich) when it is solar noon at your location (local clock time).\n\nFind the time difference, in hours, between local clock time and Greenwich (location of the prime meridian in England) Time.\n\nYour longitude will be this time difference multiplied by 15 degrees (the rate of Earth's rotation per hour).\n\nIf local time is earlier than Greenwich Time, your position is west of the prime meridian or west longitude.\n\nIf local time is later than Greenwich Time, your position is east of the prime meridian or east longitude.\n\nFIELD MAPS\n\nA field map is a region of space that has a measurable quantity at every point (for example, temperature, pressure, magnetism, gravity, and elevation).\n\nIsolines connect points of equal field value.\n\nGradient is the rate at which a field value changes.\n\nContour Lines are isolines that connect points of equal elevation.\n\nRULES FOR DRAWING ISOLINES\n\n1. Isolines connect points of equal value\n\n2. Isolines are gentle, curving lines - no sharp corners\n\n3. Isolines are always closed curves even though the map might only show part of it\n\n4. Isolines NEVER cross - this would mean that one point has two different values\n\n5. Isolines usually are parallel\n\nA steep (high) gradient changes quickly and the isolines are close together.\n\nA gentle (low) gradient changes slowly and the lines are far apart.\n\nMAP SYMBOLS\n\nSurface features on topographic maps are represented by map symbols.\n\nBrown for contour lines\n\nBlack & red for human-made structures\n\nBlue for bodies of water\n\nGreen for woods or areas with trees\n\nCONVENTIONS USED IN TOPOGRAPHIC MAPS\n\nAll points on a contour line have the same elevation.\n\nEvery fifth line, called an index line, is generally thicker and indicated in black ink and labeled with the line’s elevation.\n\nAll contour lines are closed, but they may run off the map.\n\nTo determine a contour interval, find the difference in elevation between two adjacent index contours; count the number of contour lines from one index contour to the next, not including the first contour line. Then divide the difference by the number of contour lines.\n\nTwo contour lines of different elevations may not cross each other.\n\nContour lines may merge at a cliff or waterfall.\n\nThe spacing of contour lines indicates the nature of the slope. The closer the lines are spaced, the steeper the slope.\n\nWhere contour lines cross a stream, they always form a V whose apex points up the valley.\n\nWhere contour lines cross a ridge between valleys, they often form a V whose apex points down the valleys.\n\nMAP SCALES\n\nA map scale is the ratio between the distance shown on a map and the actual distance on the ground.\n\nMap scales can be expressed in three ways: Verbally, Fractionally, and Graphically\n\nVerbally, such as one inch equals one mile.\n\nFractionally, such as 1/500,000 or 1:500,000\n\nThe graphic scale is printed so that each unit is precisely the correct size for the distance indicated.\n\nThe graphic scale can be used as a ruler to measure distances on the map.\n\nMAP DIRECTIONS\n\nThe convention used in most topographic maps is that the top of the map is north. However, since north is determined with a compass, and geographic north differs from magnetic north, most topographic maps include an arrow (compass rose) pointing north.\n\nMAP PROFILES\n\nA map profile shows what a cross section of land looks like between two points:\n\nThe two points between which the profile is to be drawn are chosen, and a line is drawn to connect them.\n\nThe edge of a piece of paper is placed along the line, and the edge of the paper is marked wherever it intersects a contour line.\n\nThe paper is moved to a piece of graph paper on which a vertical scale has been marked to match the contour lines intersected.\n\nAt each point where a contour crosses the edge of the paper, a line of the appropriate height is drawn on the graph paper\n\nThe endpoints of the lines are connected in a smooth line to form the finished profile"
