        "text": "Tears in Philadelphia for David Brenner, who never forgot where he came from\n\nOne of the wonderful things about living your whole life in the same place (and in my case, 45 years in the same house) is the ability to mourn people you’ve never met.\n\nThose who move away from the old neighborhood – whether that be a four-block square or an entire ZIP code – clearly have memories and even make periodic returns like the Capistrano swallows. But the ones who stayed behind have a special gift for appreciating native things.\n\nIn some ways, that’s counterintuitive. We always think of the “Philadelphians who got away” as the ones who miss the homegrown stuff the most, and there is a bit of truth in that. Absence makes the heart grow fonder and, in the case of Tina Fey, makes the Pica’s Pizza taste better.\n\nBut the people who stay do so for a reason, and it’s usually not because they have to. Philadelphia engenders a love and loyalty like very few other great American towns. We once were cited as having the highest number of native-born residents in a list of 20 or so other big cities.\n\nAll of this is a long prelude to explaining why I found myself sitting in front of my computer Saturday night with tears in my eyes. David Brenner, South Philly’s magnificent jokester, was gone. And here I was at my kitchen table, mourning as if I’d lost a family member.\n\nIn a way, we all have.\n\nNot once in my 52 years had I met the man. Not once had I been to a show, not even during my ignominious summer as an incompetent usherette at the Valley Forge Music Fair. I didn’t know anyone who actually knew him, never sent a fan letter, never stood within 6 (or even 20) degrees of separation from the man.\n\nBut he was from Philly, and I was from Philly, we’d walked the same streets, eaten the same mustard-slathered pretzels, rooted for the same teams, voted for the same candidates (sometimes multiple times in the same election) and mangled the same diphthongs.\n\nThat, actually, is one of the major reasons I felt such a connection to Brenner. His voice dripped with Philly Phonics, that distinctive variation on a good-natured urban whine.\n\nWhen I was an adolescent, I’d come home from school and watch “The Mike Douglas Show.”\n\nSometimes I’d alternate with the breathless, melodramatic soaps, but Mike was local and I was loyal to brand, so he usually won out. On a number of occasions, he’d have guest hosts, one of whom was the funny man.\n\nBrenner was sweet, funny, corny in a “hip nerd” way, and clean. There wasn’t a mean bone in his lanky, angular body. He made fun of no one but himself, except in the most good-natured way. He didn’t use any of George Carlin’s immortal dirty words, and there wasn’t a whiff of self-importance about this very important star.\n\nAnd there was that voice, that accent drenched in Schuylkill wudder and lightly salted like his beloved soft pretzels. There was no chance, no hope, and more important, no desire to hide his origins. Elocution teachers would lose money with him.\n\nTo those of us who stayed here, that voice meant a lot. It was as if he was proud to use it as a calling card to the rest of the world, a way of saying “Hey, New York, L.A., Peoria: I’m from Philly. We grow them funny back there.”\n\nThat unapologetic love for his origins made him, in turn, beloved by his native posse. Like the great Bill Cosby, sage of North Philly and a fellow Temple alum, Brenner always let the rest of us “Fluffyans” know that he might be chatting it up with the legendary Carson but he’d just as soon be at home drinking a Schmidt’s and having a cheesesteak with the guys. He was the local version of what Kipling meant when he wrote: “If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue/Or walk with kings, nor lose the common touch.”\n\nAs my friend Cathy reminded me, Brenner was shocked at the wide, open spaces in the suburbs when he moved out there. This son of the rowhouses couldn’t figure out why every other house was missing.\n\nThat was the sweet hallmark of his humor, self-deprecating and yet immensely proud of its origins in the urban asphalt.\n\nThe breed of comedians like Brenner is almost gone. There’s Cosby, and a very few others who eschew profanity and risqué subjects. The ability to make people laugh legitimately, having them reflect upon the strange yet endearing minutiae of life is a dying art.\n\nAnd now it’s time to mourn the artist we just lost.\n\n↧\n\nDoris P. Cart, 93, physicist, translator, librarian\n\nJan. 25, 1921 – March 13, 2014\n\nDoris P. Cart, a physics major in college who worked in the aircraft industry in World War II and later was the Nichols School librarian, died Thursday in Oxford Village at Canterbury Woods, Amherst.

Fred Phelps, church founder scorned for virulent anti-gay preaching, dies\n\nTOPEKA, Kan. – The Rev. Fred Phelps, the virulently anti-gay preacher who drew wide, scornful attention for staging demonstrations at military funerals as a way to proclaim his belief that God was punishing America for its tolerance of homosexuality, died here late Wednesday. He was 84.\n\nThe Westboro Baptist Church confirmed the death, declaring on one of its websites, “Fred W. Phelps Sr. has gone the way of all flesh.” The church did not give a cause of death, but Phelps had been living under hospice care.\n\nPhelps, who founded and led Westboro, a small nondenominational church in Topeka, was a much-loathed figure at the fringe of the U.S. religious scene, denounced across the theological and political spectrum for his beliefs, his language and his tactics.\n\nHis congregation, which claims to have staged tens of thousands of demonstrations, is made up almost entirely of his family members, many of whom lived together in a small Topeka compound, although in recent years some of his children and grandchildren had broken with the group.\n\nA disbarred civil rights lawyer who had once been honored by the NAACP and who ran for office repeatedly, and unsuccessfully, as a Democrat, Phelps seemed to accept the criticism if not relish it.\n\nHe believed that the United States was beyond saving, and he devoted his life to traveling with a small band of protesters to highlight what he saw as America’s sinfulness and damnation. His church’s website maintains a running tally of “people whom God has cast into hell since you loaded this page.”\n\nFred Waldron Phelps was born Nov. 13, 1929, in Meridian, Miss. He said that he had been admitted to the U.S. Military Academy at West Point but that after high school he had what his official biography called “a profound religious experience” and decided instead to pursue a Christian higher education, first at Bob Jones College in Tennessee and then, when the institution moved, at Bob Jones University in South Carolina. He did not graduate.\n\nHe devoted himself to evangelism, and in 1951, when he was 21, he was profiled in Time magazine because his denunciations of “promiscuous petting” and “teachers’ filthy jokes in classrooms” on a California college campus had brought him into conflict with the administration.\n\nHe married Margie Marie Simms in 1952, and in 1954 the couple moved to Topeka. They had 13 children, 54 grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren, according to the church’s website. Phelps established Westboro Baptist in 1955.\n\nPhelps believed any misfortune, most infamously the deaths of American soldiers killed in Iraq and Afghanistan, was God’s punishment for society’s tolerance of homosexuality. He and his followers carried forward their message bluntly, holding held signs at funerals and public events that used ugly slurs and read “Thank God for dead soldiers.” The group has appeared in Western New York, including at a memorial service for Flight 3407 victims.\n\nGod, Phelps preached, had nothing but anger and bile for the moral miscreants of his creation.\n\n“Can you preach the Bible without preaching the hatred of God?” Phelps asked in a 2006 interview with The Associated Press. “The answer is absolutely not. And these preachers that muddle that and use that deliberately, ambiguously to prey on the follies and the fallacious notions of their people, that’s a great sin.”\n\nFor those who didn’t like the message or the tactics, Phelps and his family had only disdain. “They need to drink a frosty mug of shut-the-hell-up and avert their eyes,” his daughter, Shirley Phelps-Roper, once told a group of Kansas lawmakers.\n\nThe activities of Phelps’ church, unaffiliated with any larger denomination, inspired a federal law and laws in more than 40 states limiting protests and picketing at funerals. He and a daughter were even barred from entering Britain for inciting hatred.\n\nBut in a major free-speech ruling in 2011, the U.S. Supreme Court held that the church and its members were protected by the U.S. Constitution’s First Amendment and could not be sued for monetary damages for inflicting pain on grieving families.\n\nYet despite that legal victory, some gay rights advocates believe all the attention Phelps generated served to advance their cause.\n\nIn Phelps’ later years, the protests themselves were largely ignored or led to counter demonstrations that easily shouted down Westboro’s message. A motorcycle group known as the Patriot Guard arose to shield mourners at military funerals from Westboro’s notorious signs. At the University of Missouri in 2014, hundreds of students gathered to surround the handful of church members who traveled to the campus after football player Michael Sam came out as gay.\n\n– News wire services\n\n↧\n\nBurton Notarius, head of Premier Wine & Spirits, dies at 70\n\nBurton Notarius, who turned Premier Liquor into a household name while sharpening the palates of many Western New Yorkers, died Friday. He was 70.\n\nHe bought the original Premier Liquor store in 1969 in Kenmore with his late father, Zellman, and late father-in-law, Bill Drown, after earning a master’s degree in business administration from the University at Buffalo in 1967.\n\nThe store was located in a small plaza at 2191 Delaware Ave., at the corner of Girard Avenue, in Kenmore. It later expanded and moved twice on the same street, finally to a location close to Sheridan Drive in the Town of Tonawanda.\n\nOver the years, Mr. Notarius built up Premier Liquor into one of the largest wine and spirits businesses in the country.\n\n“We were discounters from the first, and the store had always done a good business in wine,” he said in a Buffalo News story.\n\nMr. Notarius gained a reputation for his business acumen, philanthropic work and passion for wine.\n\nHe championed wines and winemakers in the 1970s, when wine drinking was not as popular, and helped introduce customers to the varieties from different countries so commonly consumed today.\n\n“He was a man of tremendous passion and industry,” said his son Mark. “There are so many winemakers who went on to become famous who remember my dad because he was among the first to buy their wine.”\n\nThe store changed its name to Prime Wines & Spirits in 1995 when it became part of the Premier Group, with Mr. Notarius serving as president.\n\nIn 2012, Mr. Notarius, whom everyone knew as “Burt,” moved Prime Wines & Spirits once more into a larger building in Amherst across from the Boulevard Mall and next to the Premier Gourmet store operated by Notarius’ sons Jonathan and Mark. Prime Wines also changed its name again back to Premier Wines & Spirits.\n\nMark Notarius also owns Premium Wine & Spirits on Transit Road in Amherst. Jonathan Notarius owns Prestige Wine & Spirits in Orchard Park. Both stores operate under the Premier Group.\n\nMr. Notarius’ stores have dominated the wine and spirits business in the Buffalo area with world-class selections, as well as rare bottles and artisanal brands.\n\nHe was a master of taking the mystery out of selecting and drinking wine, using a well-informed staff and in-store informational material, as well as mailings, to educate consumers about wine. He ran his stores with memorable enthusiasm and an intuitive sense of what customers wanted.\n\n“Everyone is at a different level when it comes to wine. You have to make people feel comfortable. The challenge in our industry is to become more user-friendly,” he said in a News interview.\n\nHis market savvy led him to be named Retailer of the Year in 2000 and 2012 by the influential trade magazine Beverage Dynamics. He also was named Retailer of the Year in 1993 by the magazine Marketwatch, published by the same group that publishes Wine Spectator.\n\nNotarius, of Amherst, was born in Buffalo and graduated from Kenmore West High School.\n\nIn addition to success in business, he supported dozens of charities and served on the boards of a host of organizations.\n\nThey included D’Youville College; the foundation of Kenmore Mercy Hospital; Buffalo Philharmonic Orchestra, including serving as chairman; Studio Arena Theatre, including as chairman; Hospice Buffalo; Canisius College Wehle School of Management; MusicalFare Theatre; Martin House Restoration Corp.; Burchfield Penney Art Center; Niagara University College of Hospitality and Tourism Management; and Buffalo State Hospitality Program.\n\n“He had an enthusiasm to help anyone, whether it was a charity or another retailer. It wasn’t just about what was good for him,” said Mark Notarius. “He loved to give.”\n\nIn addition to his sons, he is survived by his wife of 47 years, the former Patricia Drown; three brothers, David, Edward and Michael; and two grandchildren.\n\nServices will be at 10 a.m. Tuesday in Temple Beth Zion, 805 Delaware Ave.\n\n↧\n\nArea Deaths\n\nAlice (Kasprowicz) Banas, of Cheektowaga, died March 19.\n\nMichael J.
