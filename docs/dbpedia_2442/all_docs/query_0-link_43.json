All COMPUTERIZED FAUNAL INVENTORY FOR THE DELAWARE ESTUARY AND LAKE ERIE COASTAL ZONY 19 Prepared by: Division of Wildlife Planning Bureau of Land Management Pennsylvania Game Commission January, 1989 The preparation of this report was financed in part through the Pennsylvania Co -astal Zone Management Program under revisions of the Coastal Zone ManagementAct of 1972, administered by the Division of Coastal Zone Management, Bureau of Water Resources Management, Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Resources. INTRODUCTION one of the 'major limiting factors in the analysis of environmental projects is the availability of faunal inventory data for the project area. Ideally, the project manager should know,which animal species are present within the project area (at all times of year, not just the present), how many (abundance) of each species are present, the habitats used by each species, and the responses likely elicited by the species (individuals and populations)' due to habitat changes on the project site. Many times a plethora of faunal information already is available-for a project area, but is widely dispersed in books, filing cabinets, field notebooks, and the minds of professional ecologists and research biologists. Computer technology has made it possible for biologists to summarize data from diffuse sources into an easily accessible database, with the ability subsequently to analyse complex environmental problems for faun al concerns in minutes rather than hours,- days, and weeks. In the early 1980's a group of research biologists with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service developed a computerized database of Pennsylvania's faunal resources for use in environmental planning. Management of this database -- the Pennsylvania Fish and Wildlife Data Base -- was transferred to the Pennsylvania Game Commission in 1982. Data Base Contents The Pennsylvania Fish and Wildlife, Data Base contains complete profiles for 651 resident and common migrant and select invertebrate species occurring within Pennsylvania. The. 651 species in the Data Base are represented by nine major animal groups, as follows: amphibians@(39), reptiles (36), fishes (171), birds (293), mammals (70), and molluscs (42). Each species profile in the Data Base was compiled using a standard format. containing standard definitions and classifications. Th e definitions, classifications, and data collection format evolved out of an extensive survey of, professional natural resource agencies, universities, and private conservailoh organizations. Each species profile contains descriptors defining distribution in Pennsylvania, legal and use status, habitat-associations, food habits, environmental associations and requirements, life history, and management practices. All of this information, compiled in the standard coding booklet, was summarized by professionals with sound research backgrounds and expert knowledge of the species or species group. Each species profile was developed from a combination of published reports and field notes, and also includes professional opinion. Each data base entry is fully referenced to the original source documents. Data Base Management At the present time two versions of the Pennsylvania Fish and Wildlife Data Base operate - one mainframe and one microcomputer. Th e mainframe version operates on the Univac computer at Bloomsburg University, Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania, using the KMAGE database management system. The microcomputer version using Advanced Revelation software- 7 is. 'being tes eedi 'and -manuals- developed for' distribution -in early' 1989. Transition to dedicated micromputer use is expected by October, 1989. Presently, interactive access or batch processing on the mainframe version is possible via telephone with compatible computer hardware. Data Base Availabilit The Pennsylvania Fish and Wildlife Data Base is available to federal and state agencies, universities, conservation organizations, environmental organizations, environmental and engineering consulting firms, and any individual needing fish and wildlife information. TWO modes of access are possible; direct interactive access, and over-the-counter service through the Game Commission. Interactive access is available only to public agencies. All other prospective users must request information through the Game Commission's Data Base Coordinator. Users of the Data Base have included the U.S. Bureau of Land Management (Eastern States Office), U.S. Office of Surface Mining (Eastern Technical Center), U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Baltimore, Philadelphia, and Pittsburgh District Offices), U.S. Forest Service (Allegheny National Forest, Northeastern State and Private Forestry, and the Northeastern Forest Experiment Station), U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, U.S. Soil Conservation Service, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Pennsylvania Fish commission, Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Resources, (Bureau of Water Quality Management, Water Resources Management, Dams and Waterways Management, Information Systems, and Forestry), and numerous environmentallengine ering consulting firms. Applications Each species profile in the Data Base is divided into 125 separate datafields (e.g., species common-name,. or occurrence within a watershed). Literally thousands of combinations, i.e., questions, are answerable given this type of data organization. The Pennsylvania Fish and Wildlife Data Base will give almost instantaneous answers to questions like the following: a What fish and.wildlife species are found in Erie County? a What birds and mammals are found in riparian habitats of the Chatauqua-Conneaut drainage of eastern Lake Erie? * What species occurring in,the Chatauqua-Conneaut drainage would be adversely affected (or benefited) by channelizing andlor impounding water? @ What vertebrate wildlife species in Bucks County require cavities in snags for nesting? * What endangered or threatened species occur in estuarine habitats in Delaware County and what types of activities would adversely affect their survival? 2 Wha t are-the habitat -requ irements and limiting-factors of the federally endangered piping plover? Specific applications already noted by Data Base users include: 1. Basic descriptions of individual species, their habitat associations, and life histories. 2. Preparation and review of permit applications for surface -mining, power plant siting, point source discharge, solid waste and hazardous waste disposal, and wetland encroachments. 3. Analysis of proposals to designate. species water quality classifications for waterways. 4. Evaluation and review of energy development proje ct sites, flood control projects, road construction and improvement projects, bridge replacements, and fly ash disposal sites. 5. Preparation and review, of environmental assessments and 2mpact statements (fish and wildlife section). 6. Preparation of wildlife research proposals. 7. Guilding species for habitat evaluation procedures and the construction of species models. 8. Analysis of habitat specific wildlife trends in Pennsylvania. 9. Information source for biological technical training and public information requests. Updating The Pennsylvania Fish and Wildlife Data Base, like any other data source, remains valuable only as long as the information obtained is current and meets the expressed needs of the end-user. Information must be updated periodically, incorporating new research findings and new information elements required by users to maintain value and integrity. Through an extensive review of the pre sent Data Base elements and capabilities with Data Base users, several new elements or categories of information (e.g., life history - behavior, reproduction, population dynamics, and limiting factors) and new element values had been identified for inclusion in the Data Base. Additionally, evaluators emphasized the need to review,and incorporate new information on species distribution and life history reported in ecological publications. PROJECT OBJECTIVE The objective of this research was to update select coastal zone dwelling species in the Pennsylvania Fish and Wildlife Data Base by summarizing the best available info tion and adding it to existing and new data categories in the Data Base; that is, by compiling data on animal species seasonal distribution, forest-habitat relationships, environmental associations and preferences, food habits, life history, HEPIPAM-HEP model 3 data, and @additional management. practices @_and,effects. @This effort consisted of a comprehensive survey of existing literature and records, without further field investigation, i.e., a summary of our state-of-knorArl edge. This information was entered into the Data Base and stored in key-word searchable fashion to facilitate data retrieval and analysis. Updated faunal data stored and retrieved in the Data Base from this project may be readily obtained to advance Coastal Zone Management program goals requiring the consideration of wildlife resources, including port projects in lakefront areas, public access projects along the coastal zone, coastal zone comprehensive plan updates, and educational programs informing the public of the value of coastal zone areas. METHODS Species to be updated were identified by geographic location (Erie and Delaware Estuary Coastal Zone Areas), and habitats- (e.g., lacustrine littoral systems with cobblelgravel beaches) occurring within the areas. Emphasis was placed on species that breed, over-winter, and use adjacent habitats for a significant purpose. The 132 species selected for the project are identified in Figures 1 through 6. 4 -Figure 1.

At the same time, consulting biologists were contracted with via Commonwealth competitive contracting procedures to review, critique, and summarize the available species information in the standard Species Workbook format. See Appendix A for a list of subcontractors. Species Workbooks were reviewed and corrected as needed by PGC staff in Harrisburg. Species Workbook contents were entered into the Data Base, reviewed, and edited as necessary to compile a revised species record. Description of Species-Profile Contents Species descriptions were compiled by species experts using the standard format, the Pennsylvania Fish and Wildlife Data Base Species Workbook. Appendix B contains a sample. This workbook provides a standard format for species profiles in ten information categories: 1. Taxonom Standard, generally accepted, taxonomic references are used to enter common and scientific names, and a complete taxonomic profile from phylum to subspecies. Also included is a narrative discussion of the species taxonomy, and commonly used scientific and common name synonyms that permit greater search efficiency. 2. Status The status category allows for a description of the species current legal and use status within the Commonwealth and the identification of regulatory authorities. Status types are identified to facilitate locating federallstate endangeredl t1hreatenedl vulnerable species, as well as a variety of other categories. 3. Distribution Species distribution within Pennsylvania is discussed narratively and fully referenced. Distribution is coded into separate searchable fields by county using Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) codes; 7 112' quadrangles; U.S. Geological Survey, Office of Water Data Coordination (OWDC) Hydrologic Units; Bailey's Ecoregion Classification; Kuchler's Potential Natural Vegetation; and, for special status species, latitudel longitude of specific point and areal locations. Also included is species seasonal occurrence within each county and relative abundance by county. 14 4. Habitat Associations Species -'habitat associations are described narratively as discussed in the reviewed literature and using a series of standard habitat surrogates commonly used for habitat inventory and environmental review. Habitat associations used include the U.S. Geological Survey's Land Use and Land Cover Classification system; the U.S. Forest Service's Forest Inventory Classes and Timber Size Classes; and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's National Wetland Inventory Classification System. Additionally, environmental (physical, biological, and ecological) associations and requirements were recorded for each species by life stage. 5. Habitat Evaluation Procedures Models If final or draft habitat evaluation models were available for a species, this was recorded and the model type identified. Habitats and model elements are listed as well. 6. Animal and Plant Associations Important animal andlor plant associations, e.g., commensalism, are described in this section. 7. Food Habits Species food habits are described narratively and using a standard set of food resources. Foods consumed by each life stage (e.g., juvenile) are recorded separately. 8. Life History A complete narrative profile of the species life history is compiled in six separate sections: physical description, origi,n within Pennsylvania, behavior, reproduction, population dynamics, and limiting factors. Select life history paramaters were recorded into 22 separate searchable fields. 9. Management Management activities that affect the species survival and population levels either positively or negatively are narratively described and recorded using a standard set of management practices. 1.0. References All the literature sources and other information sources referenced in compiling the previous nine sections are compiled in this category. DATA BASE FORMAT The revised format for the Pennsylvania Fish and Wildlife Data Base includes 169 separate fields of information for each species (Figure 7). Data from each completed Species Workbook are inserted into the Data Base in the designated fields. 15 Printouts or listings, of species accounts -.before and after updating completed during this study provide an excellent illustration of the additional fields of information included in updating and additional values in existing data fields. Printouts of the Sedge wren prior to updating (App@endix D) and after updating (Appendix E) are provided for comparative purposes. A field-by-field comparison of these two printouts will highlight the new data fields for each species account, including the expanded narrative discussions and the additional values added in pre-existing fields. 16 In addition to the Sedge wren.displayed in Appendices D and E, the following updated species accounts are provided as. representative examples of the nature and extent of information generated by this project: Appendix A.

The Data Base is a computerized library of species information that is keyword searchable, providing instant access to information for 840+ animals occurring in Pennsylvania. The Data Base provides an important focus for storing and acce3 sing animal for Pennsylvania species. Game.Commission personnel and others use this Data Base for environmental assessments, habitat evaluation and management, species management research, wildlife extension, and education. This workbook has been designed for compiling a complete, concise profile of the distribution, status, biology, and management of the species. You will find 3everal \"narrative\" and \"checklist\" sections in this workbook, with specific instructions accompanying each section. Most Of the reference materials required to complete a section have been incorporated into the instructions and checklists. Additional materials or references that might be required to correctly complete a section, but were too voluminous or inappropriate to .include in the workbook, are included in the Species Workbook Supplemental Ma nual. Some of the information requested in sections of the workbook will appear to be duplicated; therefore, it is important to understand the different functions of the narrative sections and checklists. Narratives The narratives should be written in a flowing, readable format. They should provide quick, fully referenced, documentation to the. Data Base User for environmental assessments, planning decisions, etc. The narratives should be written to stand alone; that is, even if the information is requested again in a 3Ummary checklist, it is essential that all relevant/appropriate information for the topic be included in the narrative text. An individual retrieving narrative information from the Data Base probably will not have viewed any of the checklist information. All information presented in these narratives Must be referenced. Assign each reference a numerical code (sequentially beginning with 01, based upon order of appearance in the text); then record the complete citation in the REFERENCE section of this workbook. Use these codes along with the page numbers in the citation throughout the narratives to indicate the sources for each item of information; e.g., this species depositi eggs in warm, well-drained, sandy soils (03:14, 14:350-353, 15:4-5). When completing the narratives (and other sections requesting text), it is preferred that the information first be drafted and then typed or neatly printed in the workbook. Slash all zeros M\") to prevent confusion with the letter \"0\". These steps will greatly decrease the incidence of keypunch errors when the information is entered into the computer. Summary Checklists The checklists are designed to summarize selected information in the narratives into standardized keywords to allow rapid retrievals from the Data Base. Many of the checklist codes/words are established standards used by other agencies. By using these standardst the checklists will permit specific retrievals from the Data Base; e.g., what species occur in palustrine wetlands? These standard keywords also are Useful for croS3walking to other existing databases or mapping systems and for regional/national summaries. Use your professional judgment to resolve cases in which there may be overlap or gray areas in the checklists. If a species relationship to a standard code/word is uncertain, it is better to indicate a positive connection rather than not indicate it and not be able to retrieve the species in situations involving that code/word. Remember, the narratives will always serve as the definitive source for describing the species. 2 TAXONOKY A. Taxonomic Nomenclature Note: If this Workbook is being used to describe more than one subspecies, indicate all subspecies being described in the Taxonomic Narrative section. Complete the taxonomic description below to the species level only and enter the taxonomic authority for species.

Species whose occurrence indicates environ- mental quality (e.g., presence indicates low levels of dissolved oxygen). - SENSITIVE Sensitive Species especially susceptible to environ- mental perturbation (e.g., raptor breeding success has been closely tied to pesticide application and exposure). UNCLASSIFIED Unclassified Species has no recognized status in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania or its status does not correspond to any of the above categories. 8 SPECIES DISTFIBUTION The following sections have been designed to record the species distribution in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. First, the species distribution should be described in \"narrative\" form. Each item of information presented in this narrative should be referenced in the Narrative Peference section. After the narrative is completed, this information can then be used to fill out the remaining distribution sections [County distribution, distribution by watershed (OWDC Hydrologic Units), 1:24,000 scale USGS maps, latitude/longitude point locations, etc.]. Consider and use the following DEFINITIONS in completing the distribution section of this workbook: Occurrence - a species occurs in an area if it breeds, winters, or significantly uses habitat in that area. A species would occur in an area if the animal occurs there sometime during the year and the presence of that area served some vital or essential role in the animal's life cycle (even though habitat utilization may not be considered great). When defining the species occurrence, remember that you are specifying those areas in which the species will be considered in environmental studies, research project planning, management planning, etc. The following values'will be used in recording species occurrence geographically in the Commonwealth: known to occur, known not to occur, occurrence is unknown. Use the following guideline and definitions to interpret reports and other data sources for recording species distribution and occurrence: Known to occur: a species has \"known\" occurrence in an area if there exists recorded sightings, specimen data, and documentation/evidence that suggest occurrence (e.g., sightings in an area of previously documented ocurrence), or documentation/evidence judged by professional, expert opinion to be valid. Fange maps might, but do not necessarily, qualify or meet these criteria. Occurrence Must qualify as defined above. Known not to occur: a species is \"known not to occurn in an area, i.e., area is outside the range of the species distribution. This value only applies for County Distribution. Unknown: a species occurrence in the area is unknown, i.e., unable to determine from the available information base or from expert opinion whether species occurrence is \"known\" in an area or whether the species is \"known not to occur\" in an area. 9 A. Distribution Narrative The Distribution Narrative section is .provided for compiling a complete profile of the species distribution within Pennyslvania. The schematic below-13 provided for mapping the species distribution. This narrative will provide the core or base for data recorded in subsequent distribution sections and the database. Individuals accessing the database should find in this narrative a complete and concise description of known locations of the species and/or populations of the species, and be able to discern breeding locations, wintering locations, and areas of migratory occurrences, In the first paragraph, provide a brief description of the species current and historic distribution in the Commonwealth. (This paragraph should be brief and concise, not exceeding 3-4 sentences. or 10 lines of text.) In the next paragraphs, highlight areas of year-round occurrence, seasonal occurrence, and migratory occurrence. If the species is migratory only in Pennsylvania, indicate the general migratory movement pattern (e.g. by major water drainage or mountain chain) and general d ates of movement. When describing the species distribution in these paragraphs, first indicate the general area of occurrences (region, county, watershed, national forest, game lands, state park/forest, etc.), then record information (if feasible) on site locations using reference points such as cities, road s/m ilePO3tS, topographic features /elevations, rivers/streaM3/re3ervoirs, quads, latitude/longitude, LJTM coordinates, etC. Be sure that 'possible occurrence (speculation and professional opin ion) is noted as such, and that the occurrence type or mode is indicated (i.e., breeds in the following locations: 0 . .; winters in the following locations: . . . , etc.). Information related to relative abundance might also be included when available. If precise distribution is considered too sensitive or secure to present in this workbook and the database give the name, title, affiliation, address, and business telephone number of the person(3) maintaining this information. Make certain that the individual(s) is consulted prior to providing the information, Be certain to follow each item of distribution information with the reference code indicating the source of, information, e.g., \"known to occur in southeastern Pennsylvania in the counties of Chester, Delaware, and Berks ((13:21, q5:14-16, 11:14U.\" Note that persons providing expert opinion/interpretat ion are considered a reference and should be assigned a reference code and cited in the REFERENCE section at the back of this workbook. 10 Map the species distribution below and narratively describe the distribution as instructed above in the space provided below and on the following pages. sawme, Wells \"too,\" CLSOOSO CL984FICL son'\" L .*asset Ctsvog COLON\" \\____I MOON &*elves\" 10\"We ressen TLR oqq\"@ caseli\" OL &.0 own &Q0 .40PION so a Sloss *\"tat a ass\"N 0.14001\" ocafimogtam %AOCASTI GIKC\" Sevilla $\"total avlooe\"* FeLves OG&W&L to lose save FOR BIRDS ONLY Area location E3 Breeding locations Point location Wintering locations Migration corridors 22 B.

Pensylvania is used only as a migration corridor. UNKNOWN Unknown Species for which 30 few records exist in Pennsylvania that it cannot be classified into a different resident status cateogory. D. Distribution-by_County Complete the table that follows indicating species occurrence at the county level, seasonal occurrence within the counties in which the species \"occurs\". and species relative abundance within counties in which the, species \"occurs\". Your entries in this table must correspond with information presented in the Distribution Narrative (Section A). Use the following codes and definitions in completing the table. 14 1. Occurrence codes and definitions are those defined earlier in the definitions. Occurrence Codes 0 - Known to occur N - Known not to occur X - Occurrence is unknown 2. Seasonal occurrence codes should be entered for counties in which the species is \"known to occur\". If the species does not occur in a county, or its occurence in a county is unknown, do not make an entry in that county blank for seasonal occurrence.

For bird species, entries should correspond -with \"resident\" occurrence (breeding, wintering, year-round occurrences). Using the map provided below (or the large scale 1:500,000 USCS Hydrologic Unit Map of Pennsylvania) and the checklist on the next two page3, check all the OWDC hydrologic units (watersheds) in which the species \"occurs\". If the species is found statewide and in all watersheds, check \"all\" at the top of the list. Your entries should correspond with county level occurrence information(Section D) and the Distribution Narrative (Section A). 18 .E@ Istribution by OWDC,Hydrologic Units (continued) Species occurs in all OWDC hydrologic units to cataloging unit level as displayed on the USGS Hydrologic Unit Map.

Distribution by Ecoregions and Land Surface Forms in Pennsylvania NOTE: Complete this section for all species. Ecoregions are designed to stratify ecologically similar areas based on vegetation, soils, climate, and other factors. They are named after a vegetation type characteristic of the area and secondarily by landform. Although an animal species may not specifically associate with the particular vegetation type and/or landform used to name a region (e.g. Appalachian Oak Forest, High, Hills), if it \"occurs\" in that map unit, it should be marked as occurring in that ecoregion. Using the ecoregion map provided below and the checklist on the next page, check all ecoregion in which the species \"occurs\". For descriptions and definitions consult the explanatory note's in the Species Workbook Supplemental Manual. Bird species entries should correspond with \"resident\" occurrence (i.e., breeding, wintering, year-round occurrences).

Distribution by Potential Natural Vegetation Types in Pennsylvania NOTE: Complete this section for all species. Potential natural vegetation types are vegetation types that would exist today if man were removed and plant succession after his removal were telescoped Into a single moment; however, the effects of man's earlier activities are permitted to stand. As such the potential natural vegetation type portrays the biological potential of a site. Using the map provided below and the checklist on the next page (or a large scale USGS map of potential natural vegetation types), identify all the potential natural vegetation types in which the species \"occurs\". Bird species entries should correspond with resident occurrence (i.e., breeding, wintering year-round occurrences). Keep in mind that if the species \"occurs\" in the map unit, it should be marked as occurring in the potential natural vegetation type. All entries should correspond with county level occurrence information (Section D) and the Distribution Narrative (Section A). Distribution by Potential Natural Vegetation Types in Pennsylvania (cont.) Species occurs in all Potential Natural Vegetation types in Pennsylv ania as displayed on the preceding page. Species does not occur statewide (i.e., in all. Potential Natural Vegetation types in Pennsylvania). but occurs in the following types: Code Definition 093 Beech-Maple Forest 094 Mixed Me3ophytic Forest 095 Appalachian Oak Forest 097 Northern Hardwoods 101 Oak-Hickory-Pine Forest 25 Site-Specific Distribution H. Distribution by 7 1/2' Quadrangles NOTE: Complete this section-for all species. Using the U.S. Geological Survey Index to Topographic Map Coverage in Pennsylvania provided in the Species,Workbook Supplemental Manual, identify the seven (7) digit USGS 7 1/2' quadrangle code(s) and names that define the species occurrence within the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. The format for quadrangle codes is as follows: ZA@T_ EP-OVER (N) (W) The first two digits indicate the reference point latitude in degrees; the third, fourth, and fifth digits indicate the reference point longitude (values are right-justified - all longitudes in PA. would begin with 0, e.g., 80 would be 080); the sixth digit is the vertical one-degree row number counting up from the reference point; and the seventh digit is the horizontal one-degree cell counting over from the vertical row number. This is diagrammatically described in the appendix to the USGS 7 1/2' (1:24,000) series Quadrangle Map in the Species Workbook Supplemental Manual. All entries should correspond with occurrence information provided in the Distribution Narrative (Section A). Species occurs in all 7 1/2' quadrangles in Pennsylvania. Species does not occur statewide, but occurs in the following quadrangle: QuACN6.

This section is divided into two data entry parts - in part one point locations should be entered and/or the second part enter a series of latitude/longitude points that enclose an area or polygon in which the species occurs. Latitude and longitude are to be-expre3sed in degrees, minutes, and seconds. Examples are: latitude 030291 '1911, longitude 096036115\". Latitude and longitude should be entered in the following parts as a string separated by commas (e.g., 0320100963615,0320190953620, etc.). All entries in this section should correspond with occurrence information provided in the Distribution Narrative (Section A). 1. Point Locations - this should be Used for species of very limited distribution to designate occurrence (e.g. bald eagle nests, Indiana bat caves# etc.). Separate each latitude/longitude string (13 characters) with a comma. LATITUDE LONGITUDE LATITUDE LONGITUDE LATITUDE LONGITUDE 2. Polygon or Areal Locations - Use this part to describe a more widespread species, or a species of more general occurrence (but still falling into one of the above special status designations).

Habitat Associations Narrative Develop a complete and concise narrative describing this spe:cies habitat associations and preferences. Specifically describe the species associations and preferences with urban lands, agricultural lands, rangelands (i.e. herbaceous fields), forests, wetlands, barren lands, etc. Before developing this narrative, it may be best to review and be aware of the types of information required to complete the checklists that follow in this section and the Environmental Associations' sections. The object is to identify and describe fully the habitats in which this species occurs and those habitats, which if disturbed, would adversely impact the species. Be sure to describe any minimum area requirements, significant seasonal variations in habitat use, variations in habitat requirements which occur in different life stages and geographic areas, requirements or preferences for habitat interspersion and juxtaposition, habitat condition, etc. Devote a section of this narrative to describing specific environmental parameters required by the species in certain habitats (e.g. temperature, pH, alkalinity, turbidity, dissolved oxygen, flow rateso velocity, salinity, soil Moisture, soil depth, elevation, etc.). Again, it would be most helpful to review the Environmental Associations section prior to compiling this information. Be certain to cite the appropriate reference codes (e.g. 03:435-45q, 06:14) for all information, and record the complete citations in the, REFERENCE section at the back of this workbook. 29 30 B. Peferences for Habitat Associations (enter the reference codes for all references used in compiling the entries in this 3ection, 3eparate each reference code with a comma): 31 C. General Habitat Associations In the following checklist, check all ap propriate categories that correspond to the species habitat associations (i.e., where the species normally occurs): Terrestrial habitats Aquatic habitats Riparian habitats: Terrestrial land bordering streams, lakes, reservoirs (i.e. water): ecotone between aquatic and upland habitats that is influenced by the water regime. 32 D. Land Use/Land Cover Associations@ In the following list, check all appropriate land use/land cover types with which the species is associated and those that are most important or preferred by the species. (Consult A LAND USE AND LAND COVER CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM FOR USE WITH REMOTE SENSOR DATA, U.S. Geological Survey, Professional Paper No. 964, 1976, for use/cover descriptions, or the land U3e/cover explanatory notes in the Species Workbook Supplemental Manual).

Forest Habitat Associations In the table tha t follows, check all appropriate forest types/size classes with which the species is associated. Use the Species Workbook Supplemental Manual for forest cover type descriptions. If available species information fail3 to identify a specific size class association, check all size classes. Size class definitions are as follows: A. GraS3/Forb = understory is in grasses and forbs or other vegetation, no regeneration of tree species B. Seedling/Shrub = under3tory predominately trees less than 1\" diameter C. Sapling = young stand of trees (trees 1\" to 5\" dbh) D. Pole = young stand of trees Etrees 5\" - 9\" dbh (sof twood3) or 11\" dbh (hardwoods)] E. Mature x mature stand of trees [trees > 9\" dbh (30ftwoods) or 11\" dbh (hardwoods), but not \"@Tld growth\"] F.

Wetland Habitat Associations From the lists that follow, check all wetland habitat types with which the species is associated. Note that the system is hierarchical, indicate wetland associations to the subclass level in the checklists. Use the Wetland Classification Scheme information presented below and on the next two pages, and the booklet, CLASSIFICATION OF WETLANDS AND DEEPWATER HABITATS OF THE UNITED STATES, FWS/OBS-791/31, Washington, D.C., for habitat de3criptio ns. WETLAND CLASSIFICATION SCHEME Use of Wetland Legend: Species are related to wetlands by a series of letters and numbers (alpha numerics) with the first letter representing the system and 3ub3equent alpha numerics representing, in sequential order, the subordinate levels of detail to modifier level. Note: The lists that are provided in this section require specifying wetland associations to the subclass level only. Special modifiers, i.e. water regime, water chemistry, and other modifiers, should be identified and referenced in the Habitat Associations Narrative.
