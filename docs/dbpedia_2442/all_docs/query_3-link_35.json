        "text": "The distribution and density of human population continues to be a critical component to measuring, mapping and understanding humanâenvironment interrelationships; identifying populations at risk of infectious diseases or disasters; and informing management and policy decisions from local- to global-level initiatives (e.g., Wesolowski et al.,Â 2014; Simarro et al.,Â 2011; McDonald et al.,Â 2011; Jones et al.,Â 2008; McGranahan et al.,Â 2007; Doocy et al.,Â 2007). The traditional form of collecting population data is through a census or registry, and those population counts can be spatially linked to boundary datasets representing enumeration areas (the most basic unit of collected census data) or administrative units in a Geographic Information System (GIS). More recently, an increasing use of fully georeferenced censuses has made building-level mapping more feasible in some countries. However, census data vary substantially across countries with regard to quality, the number and size of enumerated areas, the frequency of data collection and the level of confidentiality depending on detail. The size of census units also varies significantly within countries between rural and urban areas. Thus, to be useful for many analytical purposes, substantial efforts are required to harmonize such enumerated data (de Sherbinin, 2017; Zoraghein et al.,Â 2016; Schroeder, 2007). Since Tobler's âWorld population in a grid of spherical quadrilateralsâ (Tobler et al.,Â 1997) and Liverman et al.'s âPeople and Pixelsâ (Liverman et al.,Â 1998), the benefits of gridded population data have been acknowledged. As a consequence, the scientific community has increasingly invested in ways to create global georeferenced data products that help overcome the inconsistencies in census-derived national population data and facilitate their integration with other gridded spatial datasets such as remote sensing data products. This article, a product of the POPGRID Data Collaborative (POPGRID, 2018), describes the variety of gridded population data products that have been created over the past 20Â years and is an effort to aid users in better understanding the nature of these products, their qualities and forms of appropriate uses.\n\nThere is high demand for modeled gridded population datasets particularly in countries with less detailed or infrequent censuses. These datasets, for example, support land use and urban planning (Dong et al.,Â 2017), measurement of economic development (Nordhaus, 2006; Uchida and Nelson, 2009; Roberts et al.,Â 2017), transportation infrastructure management and rural access (Iimi et al.,Â 2016; World Bank, 2016), resource allocation strategies (Islam et al.,Â 2006; Deichmann et al.,Â 2011), disaster risk mitigation, management and reduction (Ehrlich et al.,Â 2018a; Aubrecht et al.,Â 2016; Gunasekera et al.,Â 2015; Mondal and Tatem, 2012; Taramelli et al.,Â 2010), climate change research (Blankespoor et al.,Â 2017; Dasgupta et al.,Â 2011; McGranahan et al.,Â 2007), sampling design for household surveys (Blankespoor et al.,Â 2018; Thomson et al.,Â 2017), public health campaigns and assessments (Snow et al.,Â 1999; Hay et al.,Â 2004; Jones et al.,Â 2008; Weber et al.,Â 2018; Dunn et al.,Â 2019), and sustainable resource management (Koch et al.,Â 2008; Parish et al.,Â 2012; McDonald et al.,Â 2011) among many other applications . International frameworks for development and sustainability depend on the availability of population data, which are commonly used as a denominator in calculating different metrics and indicators. Such frameworks include the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction, the UNFCCC Paris Agreement and the United Nations New Urban Agenda, to mention just a few.\n\nThe field has seen advances at multiple levels. First, the spatial resolution of underlying census data available for geoprocessing, along with the standards for producing such data (United Nations, 2009), has improved dramatically in many countries since the creation of the earliest gridded population data products such as the Gridded Population of the World versionÂ 1 (Tobler et al.,Â 1995; Deichmann, 1996). Second, significant progress has been made through advances in information extraction and classification of populated land area from remote sensing data at various resolutions (Wardrop et al.,Â 2018). The increased availability and spatial granularity of remotely sensed information about topography, vegetation and land cover has been critical to improving the identification of such places that are potentially inhabited and even the estimation of counts of people living there (Frye et al.,Â 2018; Nieves et al.,Â 2017; Pesaresi et al.,Â 2013). Third, the combination of access, increased computing power and greater spatial accuracy in ancillary datasets has provided the basis for methodological advances to redistribute census-enumerated population counts to grid cells at continental and global scales with high accuracy (e.g., Freire et al.,Â 2018) and to create time series of population estimates that can be used to fill in data gaps between national census surveys that are commonly taken at decadal intervals (e.g., WorldPop and CIESIN, 2018).\n\nAs a result of these recent developments, there are now several global and continental gridded population datasets that are based on different modeling approaches and input data layers. As might be expected, there are similarities but also important differences among these products, and yet to date there has neither been a systematic review of these various approaches nor a comparison of the corresponding outputs. This represents a serious gap in the literature as these differences can easily lead to misunderstandings or inappropriate use of population grids. The objective of the paper is to fill that gap by helping guide users in forms of appropriate, uncertainty-aware use of the available global gridded population datasets in different application areas. Such an assessment is necessary as knowledge of underlying approaches and input data can inform about what each gridded product actually measures. For example, the exposure of a target population to disasters requires a population grid that (1)Â covers the area of interest, (2)Â provides a meaningful analytical unit (i.e., the size of the grid cell), (3)Â warrants the temporal currency needed relative to the time of interest, and (4)Â estimates the correct target population. This example demonstrates why applying population grids is not trivial; grids have different characteristics that may affect the accuracy and precision of the analysis but also their suitability in a given context.\n\nThe above aspects together provide the essential components to assess the fitness for use of a data product in the context of relative data quality (Tayi and Ballou, 1998). âFitness for useâ is a concept that has often been used to assess the appropriateness of a given spatial dataset for an intended purpose (Agumya and Hunter, 1999; de Bruin et al.,Â 2001; Devillers et al.,Â 2007). Here, this concept will be applied to guide a growing user community in making informed decisions regarding the most appropriate dataset(s) for their intended use by better understanding the characteristics of the available different data products that also include the modeling assumptions behind them. Spatial, thematic and temporal accuracy play a key role in formalizing fitness for use. However, the multidimensionality of accuracy in the case of population grids is further driven by the nature and heterogeneity of the input population data, the use and characteristics of ancillary data involved, and the methodological framework applied to redistribute population counts to grid cells. All these factors will be systematically explored in this article.\n\nThis review targets researchers and applied users in the geospatial, demographic, environmental and land use research communities with diverse needs. SectionÂ 2 begins with a brief history of population gridding. SectionÂ 3 looks at commonalities and differences in methods applied and ancillary data used to produce gridded population data. SectionÂ 4 provides an introduction to the data products of interest herein and summarizes the approaches behind the most recently released global as well as some selected regional and national gridded population datasets. SectionÂ 5 provides a comparative discussion of several components related to the fitness for use of the different data products. Finally, we list guidelines that can help the user community make informed decisions related to the fitness of a given population data product for their intended use and identify future avenues of work and needed investments in Sect.Â 6.\n\nThe process of creating gridded population products redistributes population estimates from census or administrative areas to grid cells, conditional on where human populations and settlements may be located. The nature, quality and accuracy of the input population data, the characteristics of the output gridded population dataset, the properties of the ancillary data used, and the implications of the methodological approach applied for population allocation and redistribution are all important determinants of spatial data quality in general (FGDC, 1998; Guptill and Morrison, 2013) but also help to shed light on the relative data quality of each of the population grids described in this review. While data quality and its reporting in standardized metadata has been the focus of much research in the last decades, the discussion of relative quality or fitness for use of spatial data has received less attention (see Devillers et al.,Â 2007, 2010; IvÃ¡novÃ¡ et al.,Â 2013). Since the described population grids show fundamental differences, the question of whether a data product is fit for a given purpose is of high relevance. Thus, in this section, we discuss several determinants (not an exhaustive list) that aid the data user in the assessment of the data product's fitness for use relative to the target application. We briefly discuss data-related aspects including scale, currency and semantics, as well as modeling and processing-related implications for uncertainty. We address them separately, but the reader may be reminded that all those relative quality aspects have to be understood to be interrelated as one can affect all others. We will also address the problem of validation of large-scale population grids.\n\n5.1âData aspects of relative quality\n\nThe accuracy of the input census/population data and ancillary data includes thematic, spatial and temporal accuracies, which contribute to the level of uncertainty of the final data product. For this reason, the user needs to consider and understand what kind of data are input to a certain data production process. For census data, the completeness of coverage, the margin of error (if sampled), the time period the census is taken and the positional accuracy of the boundaries are measures that can be used but might not be always known, and the data need to be used with caution. This kind of knowledge is important to reflect when using population grids in a given region (e.g., Tatem, 2014). With regard to the ancillary data, needless to say, the quality of the final population grid depends on the quality of the ancillary data used for redistributing population counts. Apart from the existence and strength of the assumed relationship between population and ancillary variables (Nieves et al.,Â 2017), the accuracy of these spatial layers themselves is critical for the accuracy of gridded population estimates. For example, the classification accuracy of built-up or developed land layers that are used to redistribute census counts to different regions tends to be lower in rural than in urban settings (Wickham et al.,Â 2013; Leyk et al.,Â 2014, 2018; Uhl et al.,Â 2018) but can also vary across larger regions and countries. The quality of remotely sensed ancillary data also depends heavily on the characteristics of the instrument (optical daytime, optical nighttime or radar) and the processing algorithm (e.g., Small et al.,Â 2005; Potere et al.,Â 2009; Pesaresi et al.,Â 2016b; Esch et al.,Â 2017). Such differences propagate through to strongly influence the accuracy of the final population data product and may cause over- or underestimations in different subregions. Knowledge of such issues would be critical for the data user if population estimates in different regions are compared with each other. Due to the nature of the input and ancillary data, these accuracies translate into aspects of scale, currency and semantics critical for evaluating the fitness for use of the final population grids as discussed below.\n\nScale. Since input data are typically enumerated counts, issues due to spatial aggregation including the MAUP (Openshaw, 1983), as the geographical manifestation of the ecological fallacy (Piantadosi et al.,Â 1988; Waller and Gotway, 2004), are one of the main sources of the unknown. Differences in granularity of the input (census) data across different regions or countries must be taken into account since the same population redistribution model may perform very differently under different circumstances due to possible scale effects. In using the final population grids, the grid cell, defined by the spatial resolution (that is, cell size; TableÂ 2), would often be assumed to define the analytical scale (Montello, 2001; Cao and Lam, 1997). The user would often attempt to model a certain process or phenomenon of interest, but often there is a mismatch between this operational scale (e.g., Montello, 2001; Maclaurin et al.,Â 2015) and the analytical scale. However, it is imperative for the user to understand that due to the difference between input population data (i.e., source unit) and output grid cell (i.e., target unit) granularity this assumption may be fundamentally flawed and result in either oversampling or generalization. For example, if the analysis is intended to be conducted at the neighborhood scale, population estimates provided in grid cells of 150 or 250âm appear to represent meaningful target units. If these input data were at the census block or tract level, the grid cell size would represent an appropriate proxy and can be used as a valid analytical unit at the intended target scale. If, however, the input data originated from large administrative units (e.g., district- or county-level source units) there would be a significant offset between input and output. In such cases, the user would face a higher risk of using oversampled population estimates that might result in higher degrees of local inaccuracy.\n\nCreating equivalencies over time of finely resolved census units is challenging even in vector format; this problem is not necessarily abated when transforming vector data to grids. Differences in embeddedness of the population grid cells within census boundaries (when the census units are intrinsically larger than the average grid cell size) also have implications for subsequent analysis using, e.g., multilevel models over large areas and can become even more problematic if the census boundaryâgrid cell relationship changes over time, thus impeding the creation of reliable population trajectories of place. To complicate matters, if ancillary data are used to redistribute population (e.g., to built-up portions of the source unit) based on existing relationships, such scale-related problems may be mitigated to some degree. In addition, variation in how a model is trained or the units selected to build the estimation model will influence the final gridded distribution (Sinha et al.,Â 2019). For example, if census data from one region or country are very coarse, a model built based on finer-resolution data from a neighboring region and then applied to the region of interest can be more accurate (Gaughan et al.,Â 2015). Thus, scale effects are inherent to each of the described population grids at different degrees and represent a geographically varying characteristic depending on the granularity of the input data, the strength of the associations between population and ancillary data, and the resolution of the output data. These effects need to be interpreted in the context of the target scale of the intended analysis, and consideration should be given to the type of scaling needed to produce a given grid. For the interested reader, Ge et al.Â (2019) provides a comprehensive review on scaling considerations when working with geospatial Earth science data.\n\nThe currency of the data represents another important issue. In a few instances, underlying census data are old (e.g., in Haiti) or the period between censuses is more than 10Â years. While some of the ancillary data are more or less constant over the near term (e.g., water bodies and permanent ice), there may also be temporal mismatches between population data and any of the intrinsically time-varying ancillary data layers (Fig.Â 2). For example, it may be unknown whether a given built-up land grid cell has been developed at the time the census has been taken. Such temporal offsets may be critical if the assumption for the intended application necessitates a high degree of temporal agreement (currency). This form of uncertainty is difficult to handle and can be further complicated by differences across regions and countries. In response to this, few efforts (e.g., WorldPop and GHS-POP) ensure the use of temporally implicit or invariant ancillary data in the modeling process (Gaughan et al.,Â 2016) (TableÂ 1). However, even under those conditions, there might still be underlying issues for projecting forward/backward from census data for a target year of interest. The user is well advised to understand the gridded population estimates as approximations over a period of time and avoid flawed assumptions of high currency in a given analysis.\n\nSemantics. As mentioned before, what the population modeled represents can be very different among data products. This meaning can even be different within one product if, e.g., the census input data account for different population concepts or population groups in different regions or countries. For example, the population estimate might refer to de jure (or legal) populations vs. de facto (or present) populations, and using the one over the other product would possibly result in dramatically different results. The user has to be aware that data on resident populations as provided by censuses are themselves a convention, whose distribution never occurs at any moment in time (deÂ jure census population) or if it does occur (de facto, location at the time of the census) that distribution may not be representative of a different situation or in the medium/long term (i.e., a year): the concept of usual residence. Most of the global population data products use a nighttime/usual residence (deÂ jure) concept or mostly rely on underlying data that use a deÂ jure concept, with LandScan being the notable exception. Thus, the user is well advised to be aware of the meaning of the populations modeled in the population grid in question to avoid such misinterpretations, as indicated in TableÂ 2. The aspects of scale mismatch described above can further add to semantic differences since, due to such aggregation effects, different populations may be modeled. Thus, these implications have to be understood by the user, spatially and semantically, and caution is advised when interpreting analytical results.\n\n5.2âProcessing- and model-related implications of uncertainty\n\nRegardless of the approach of choice employed for data production, all efforts described in this review do carry out some form of data conversion (e.g., vector to raster) and data integration (reallocation or resampling). The different population grids described are based on varying levels of modeling intensity (unmodeled, lightly and highly modeled) as indicated in TableÂ 2. However, any such data processing step will propagate uncertainty in some way and have consequences for the quality of the outcome data and the subsequent analyses, depending on the input data quality as described above. For example, if large census units (e.g., counties or districts) in vector format are converted to grid cells (rasterization) of fine spatial resolution (e.g., 150âm), while there is a clear scale effect to be addressed (see above), the resulting population estimates may differ dramatically for different redistribution models applied that may or may not use ancillary data. The data user needs to be aware that existing uncertainty is not eliminated by applying certain models or integrating different data sources. However, through the process of data integration we may be able to improve the accuracy based on spatial refinement strategies such as dasymetric modeling (Mennis, 2009).\n\nGPW, GHS-POP and HYDE do not employ statistical methods to produce their grids, and thus traditional metrics of uncertainty are not available. Because fine resolution inputs reduce errors of aggregation, GPW reports the number of input units per country used in the gridding process. Nevertheless, errors may persist in countries with highly variable input units. For example, Sahelian countries have finely resolved units for densely populated areas but very coarse units for sparsely populated regions.\n\nThe specific model applied to reallocate population counts and densities, which can be empirical or statistical, will always have some error. This error relates to the estimated relationship between population and ancillary variable and not to the final population estimate which also may incorporate uncertainty due to error in the input population data or ancillary data. When the modeling process is statistical or hybrid such as in the case of the WorldPop, LandScan and WPE, estimates of such model errors (e.g., standard error of regression coefficients, prediction error) can be derived as a by-product of the modeling process. To fully understand the quality of a population grid, the error of the applied model needs to be evaluated. Highly accurate ancillary data are not useful if the relationship to population is weak or the model applied inappropriate, and thus the model predictions are unreliable (e.g., low R squared, or deviance explained). Such prediction errors are often assessed in comparison to alternative models but are hard to quantify in the absence of validation data. To complicate matters, the same model might perform very differently in different geographies or under different environmental conditions, an effect known as spatial nonstationarity or spatial variation of the target relationships (Fotheringham et al.,Â 1996). Such variations will further affect the model predictions if left unaccounted for.\n\n5.3âValidation challenges\n\nValidation of population data has always been a challenge, simply because validation data at fine resolutions are rarely available and, even when available, may exist at different time periods or confidentiality rules may limit their use in order to not expose individual- and household-level information. Access to such confidential data is only possible with special permission or sworn status and, even then, often the demographic data are only a sample of the whole population. These challenges can be very different between countries, and thus a validation that may be possible in one country does not necessarily translate to another location. For example, Tiecke et al.Â (2017) compare the locations of the population grid to the GPS coordinates of the nationally representative sample of almost 12â000 households interviewed for a survey in Malawi. While a true validation of the gridded output remains a challenge, it is possible to internally test the accuracy of the modeling approaches (Gaughan et al.,Â 2015; Sorichetta et al.,Â 2015; Reed et al.,Â 2018). Such an assessment can be done when different levels of census input data are available for use in a model. The approach leverages the coarser level data in different modeling approaches and then compares the gridded outputs to the finer level census data to determine how well and plausibly populations were distributed.\n\nValidating ancillary data may have its own challenges. However, the existence of new, more detailed reference data in some regions (e.g., parcel data, crowdsourcing data) has helped to make progress in evaluating land cover data and built-up land layers, which is key to most of the described population grids (See et al.,Â 2015; Leyk et al.,Â 2018; Leyk and Uhl, 2018). In general, depending on the level of land development and land use patterns in the region of interest, different products may serve the intended purpose differently.\n\nAgumya, A. and Hunter, G.
