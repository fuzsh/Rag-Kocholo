This document provides instruction on how to locate places on Earth using latitude and longitude. It discusses key concepts like the equator, prime meridian, lines of latitude and longitude. Examples are given to show how to determine the coordinates of specific places, such as Manila, Philippines being at 14°N, 120°E. The surrounding landmasses and bodies of water near the Philippines are also identified in a table. The document concludes with sample problems to test understanding of coordinate systems and an activity suggestion to document places visited using maps.",
