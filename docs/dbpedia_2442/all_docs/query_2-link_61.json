        "text": "The Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta is a world-renowned attraction and destination for kids of all ages. For more than four decades, the first week in October brings the smell of roasting chiles and the beautiful, magical moving picture show of hot air balloons sailing silently through the crisp fall air.\n\nGuests from all over the world come to Albuquerque to celebrate ballooning. Literally, hundreds of balloons will be taking flight from the Balloon Fiesta Park October 5-13, 2024.\n\nFrom its modest beginnings in 1972 with 13 balloons launching from a shopping mall parking lot, the Balloon Fiesta has grown to a 9-day event launching from the custom-designed, 365-acre Balloon Fiesta Park. With over 500 balloons, is the largest ballooning event on earth, the most photographed event on earth, and the largest annual international event held in the United States.\n\nImagine 54 football fields, all put together. That's the size of Balloon Fiesta Park's 78-acre launch field! And at this Park's \"playing field,\" there are no losing teams and no viewing stands. Guests walk the field and are part of the action.\n\nHundreds of thousands of smiling, upturned faces, awestruck by the spectacular beauty of hot air balloons filling the big blue morning New Mexico sky. During the glows you walk our field at nightfall and you hear the thrilling roar of hundreds of burners simultaneously igniting, turning the Park into a huge lighted Christmas tree of colorful balloons. What you can't feel until you join us is the massive joy everywhere around you.\n\nYes. Hard-surface handicap parking near the entrance gates is available for the regular parking fee ($20 per session) each time you park. ADA parking is not guaranteed and is first come, first served.

We will mail a reflective placard to you towards the end of August.\n\nRequests may be made via email to:\n\nballoons@balloonfiesta.com\n\nPlease include the subject line \"ADA Placard Request\"\n\nRequests may also be made via mail to:\n\nAIBF\n\n4401 Alameda NE\n\nAlbuquerque, NM 87113\n\nATTN: ADA Placard Request\n\nAgain, please note that all parking, including ADA parking, is first come, first served and is $20 per session.\n\nMobility scooters, wheelchairs, strollers, and wagons are available on a limited basis for on-site rental.
