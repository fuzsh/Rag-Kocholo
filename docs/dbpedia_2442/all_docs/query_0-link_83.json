        "text": "Since it’s Valentine’s Day this week, we asked our Penn 1993 classmates if they met their spouse at Penn. Many classmates responded with the story of how they met, if they met at Penn, and if they both graduated in 1993. We will be sharing these stories over a few posts. Here is the second installment of Penn Couples from the Class of 1993!\n\nStories included here:\n\nSamantha (Helman) Lichtman, W’93, and Jeff Lichtman, C’93\n\nJulie (Berliner) Bell, C’93, and Stephen Bell, C’92\n\nJackie Einstein Astrof, C’93, and Josh Astrof, C’93, W’93\n\nChristine Lutton Foster, C’93, and David Foster, Eng’93\n\nMarnie (Goldman) Altman, C’93, and Paul Altman, W’93\n\nTanya Dooley-Adija, C’93, and Onyango “Yang” Adija, W’93\n\nCindy Dauber Anapolsky, W’93, and Jeff Anapolsky, C’93, W’93\n\nEbru Ural, W’93, and Justin Sowers, Eng’93\n\nDeb Brown, C’93, and Jef Pollock, C’93\n\nKerry Kennedy, C’93, and Brad Goldberg, C’93\n\nJon Tretler, C’93, WG’97, and Lisa Brichta Tretler, C’94, G’99, WG’99\n\nMichelle (Cousins) Mott, C’93, NU’98, GNU’99 and Ako Mott, W’93\n\nStacey (Bucholtz) Leibowitz, C’93, RES’00, and David Leibowitz, C’93, L’00\n\nSamantha (Helman) Lichtman, W’93, and Jeff Lichtman, C’93\n\nMy wife – Samantha (Helman) Lichtman and I met at Penn. We started dating at the beginning of our Sophomore year, and have been together ever since. In fact, we celebrated 28 years together in September. We both graduated in 1993, and eventually ended up in Chicago where we still live and raise our three boys.\n\nWe actually met Freshman year. We both lived in Community House in the Quad. We were friendly, but not necessarily friends. However, we both took a Political Science course second semester Freshman year. I didn’t go to too many classes because I was pledging a fraternity. One day in class toward the end of the semester I was sitting behind Samantha and saw that she had really good penmanship. I asked if I could photo copy her notes to help me study for the final. And then I asked if I could join her study group – I did think she was cute after all. She agreed to both. And then we ended up getting the same grade in the class – still a point of frustration for her. The year ended and we both went our separate ways for the summer.\n\nWhen we came back Sophomore year, we were both at the Palladium one night at the beginning of school. I learned it was her birthday soon so I asked if I could take her out to celebrate. She agreed. A few days later, her friends asked her to go out for her birthday (they were really planning a surprise party) but she told them she had a date with Jeff Lichtman. So her friends found me and asked me to bring her to the party after the date. In reality, I had had a few too many drinks that night at the Palladium so I had forgotten about our date. I’m so thankful they reminded me. I took her out – we went to Chili’s just off campus (very fancy) and from there, to her surprise party. After that night, we just kept hanging out and it eventually turned into us dating and the rest is history.\n\nMarnie (Goldman) Altman, C’93, and Paul Altman, W’93\n\nWe met the first day of class freshman year. The scene was our freshman seminar class, Craft of Prose, in Bennett Hall. After class, while walking to Stouffer (chicken grillas!), Paul put on the charm and asked Marnie to dinner the next night, where we were joined by 10+ people on our ‘first date’ at Won’s Chinese Food next to Smokes. We dated all four years at Penn and, after both graduating in ’93, got married in 1995. We now have two kids (aged 12 and 15) and our oldest’s middle name is Bennett, as a tribute to that fateful day in September 1989.\n\nTanya Dooley-Adija, C’93, and Onyango “Yang” Adija, W’93\n\nWe are a Proud Penn couple!\n\nCindy Dauber Anapolsky, W’93, and Jeff Anapolsky, C’93, W’93\n\nCindy and Jeff met at Penn. Cindy lived in unrenovated Quad in Speakman. He lived down the hall in Butcher. The sign on Jeff’s door said he was from Schenectady, New York (where I was born). So I was looking to say hi. We met in the first week or two in a mutual friend’s room on the hall. We have been a couple since our sophomore year at Penn.\n\nWe have been married 21 years. We have a 17 year old daughter and a 13 year old son. We live in Houston, Texas.\n\nIt turns out that we went to the same preschool when we were 3 in Schenectady before my family moved away. I was in the AM class and Jeff was in the PM class. We never met then.\n\nEbru Ural, W’93, and Justin Sowers, Eng’93\n\nA few then and now pics, you may notice a theme….I’d like to nominate Justin as most likely to arrive at the reunion wearing his (same) Penn 250th sweatshirt. We were introduced by mutual friends in the quad our sophomore year. We both graduated in ‘93, Justin from SEAS as a bioengineer and I from Wharton with concentrations in Marketing and Multinational Management. After Penn, we both lived and worked in New York and were married in 2000 after earning our MBA’s. Justin and I have traveled near and far wearing our red and blue since 1993. Today we live in Central Florida with our two girls who are making the journey to the reunion to buy dad a new sweatshirt.\n\nWe are looking forward to seeing many dear friends and visiting campus as a family!\n\nEditor: What is going on in the rollerblade photo?\n\nEbru: Just some shenanigans – for many years we used to rollerblade from the upper east side downtown to Battery Park City and I guess that day we got bored of skating side by side? Or we might assume that I was finding new ways to sweep Justin off his feet!\n\nI remember one time he actually left his sweatshirt behind accidentally in a bed and breakfast in Cape May and they were nice enough to send it back! Can you imagine our suspense since we had to take the train back to New York and call them from a landline in the days before cell phones to find out if it was still there.\n\nDeb Brown, C’93, and Jef Pollock, C’93\n\nHow did Deb and I “meet” is a complicated question. I met Deb when I first read her column in the Daily Pennsylvanian which she brilliantly titled, “See Ya in Church” which meant she, like me, was a Murph’s person. We all know… there were Smoke’s people, and Murph’s people. And I was for sure all skylab all the time. But I didn’t actually know her at all. But reading the title of the column, seeing her picture, and then reading the content of what she wrote, I knew I had to meet her.\n\nI met her at some point through performing arts stuff, but we didn’t really connect. And then I saw her while working the Rolling Stone exhibit where I was serving coffee (I have no clue why I did that job), and exclaimed “Downtown Deborah Brown” which caused her to scurry away in fear.\n\nBut the real meeting was on her 21st birthday when I bought her a shot at the Palladium on Locust Walk. That was the beginning of a long courtship that took 9 years, and a few cities (and countries) in between. Best shot I ever bought. And the rest is history.\n\nKerry Kennedy, C’93, and Brad Goldberg, C’93\n\nKerry Kennedy and Brad Goldberg were married July 26, 2002.\n\nWe met in September 1989 on our Freshman Hallway in Community House (Thomas Penn/McIlhenny). We were friends throughout Penn, and reunited in 1998 after Kerry attended Harvard Law School and Brad was living in Los Angeles working at Fox.\n\nAround 8 years ago, we coincidentally met up with another double ‘93 Penn couple, Debbi and Brian Stern, while serving together on the Heart Committee for Children’s Hospital Los Angeles and our girls now attend the same summer camp in Maine where we get to hang out every visiting day.\n\nEditor’s note – you can read about Debbi and Brian in Part 1.\n\nJon Tretler, C’93, WG’97, and Lisa Brichta Tretler, C’94, G’99, WG’99\n\nWe met at a fraternity party in September 1990 – Lisa’s first week of freshman year (and not my fraternity either!)\n\nMarriage Proposal – 1997. I drove from New York City to Philadelphia on a brisk December day to pick Lisa up from Wharton for winter break where she was finishing the first semester of her MBA. Instead of a quick dinner and packing up the car, I cajoled her into a stroll down Locust Walk (for old times sake), and then I asked her to marry me right in front of the button (of course!). Rather than driving back to New York that night, I had a whole evening planned for us at the Four Seasons in Center City. The night included time to call our families with the news, champagne and strawberries in the room and a special dinner.\n\nWhen we arrived at the room the key (yes, back when hotels had real keys) broke in the door. I couldn’t access the surprise of the champagne on ice and strawberries in the room waiting for us. While we waited, the hotel put us into another room, down the hall, where we could hear them drilling for the key and breaking down the door because the hotel management was so mortified by the thought that they ruined the actual proposal.\n\nFortunately for me, I had already actually proposed and Lisa had already said yes and so we had a long laugh at seeing the hotel staff scramble to fix what they thought was a marriage proposal gone awry."
