        "text": "It's 8 P.M. and we're driving down Flatbush Avenue in Brooklyn to a little-advertised nocturnal gathering on the old runways of a decommissioned airport.\n\nWhile a get-together in such an odd location might suggest some kind of outlaw party, our rendezvous promises to be slightly less rowdy -- and totally cosmic.\n\nAlmost every month for the last 17 years, the Amateur Astronomers Association of New York has held a ''star party'' at Floyd Bennett Field, one of the city's darkest corners. Lugging high-powered telescopes, the amateur astronomers and their guests (everyone is invited) gather to observe such stellar phenomena as the Orion Nebula, asteroids and the atmospheric conditions around Mars. Over the years, the only things that have stopped the star parties have been winter snowstorms, summer mosquitoes and cloudy skies.\n\nOf course, New York City is not well known for its stargazing. Our skies are light-polluted, tall buildings block off views of the firmament, and spending time in poorly lighted, unpopulated areas is not considered the smart thing to do. The closest most New Yorkers get to seeing stars is the map of the zodiac on the ceiling of Grand Central Terminal.\n\nYet the 400 members of the city's 72-year-old Amateur Astronomers Association do the best they can to meet the universe head on. Besides Floyd Bennett Field, club members regularly hold star parties in Carl Schurz Park on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, at Great Kills Park on the southeastern shore of Staten Island and on special occasions at the Sheep Meadow in Central Park, where New Yorkers have patiently lined up behind telescopes waiting for views of everything from the mountains of the Moon to Comet Shoemaker-Levy colliding with Jupiter.\n\nTomorrow night, the club will be host to an astral shindig at Great Kills, hoping to spot a few shooting stars on the last night of the annual Perseid meteor shower. Since most club members can't travel to truly dark-sky locations on the average weekend, they settle for these, the darkest skies they can find. ''When you live in the city, you can be blinded to the stars by all the lights, which is sad because the sky is spectacularly beautiful,'' said Lynn Darsh, the association's president. ''When you go to places like Floyd Bennett Field where there are very few lights, you're still in the city, but you can see the stars and get a whole new perspective on the universe.''\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
