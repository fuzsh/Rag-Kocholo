        "text": "The iconic Call of Duty gaming series will now become all the more appealing to car enthusiasts thanks to the availability of the GMC Hummer EV to the game.\n\nFew modern production cars are better suited to a starring role than the Hummer EV and from this fall, it will become a playable vehicle in Call of Duty: Warzone 2.0 and in the single-player campaign of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II from October 28, 2022.\n\n“The GMC HUMMER EV Pickup is truly the world’s first all-electric supertruck,” vice president of Global Buick and GMC, Duncan Aldred described in a press release. “Now, it is entering the gaming world where it will define a new chapter of capability and bring players together across the globe. Bringing the supertruck into Call of Duty will allow players to elevate their experience and provide a new way to play, powered by a nearly quiet and fast-accelerating EV.”\n\nRead Also: The US Army Has Purchased A GMC Hummer EV To Test It Out\n\nhttps://youtu.be/5tKZyq1cR8Q\n\nThe Hummer EV is one of the most capable, go-anywhere vehicles on the market and will be able to showcase its width breadth of abilities across the massive maps of the two games.\n\n“We’re excited to bring the GMC Hummer EV Pickup into the fold for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II and Call of Duty: Warzone 2.0,” added director of Global Partnerships at Activision, William Gahagan. “There’s nothing like driving across Call of Duty: Warzone 2.0 in an all-electric, 1,000 horsepower supertruck. I can’t wait for players to get their hands on it this fall.”\n\nThe GMC Hummer EV has proven to be quite a hit since its release. In early-July, it was revealed that there was more than 77,000 people on the list for the EV pickup and EV SUV models."
