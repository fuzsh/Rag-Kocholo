        "text": "Thank you so much to Sega of America, Inc. for your generous donation to the 2024 CHOC Walk! Your support of CHOC Children's will absolutely make a difference for kids and families in Orange County and beyond! There is a reason SEGA is such a huge name in gaming, with such an incredible record of hits. Their focus on innovation and fun shines throughout their now 64 year history. As someone who grew up with many SEGA properties (Sonic the Hedgehog, Altered Beast, Shinobi, and Streets of Rage all come immediately to mind), later in life bonded with my partner over Super Monkey Ball, and today continues to be blown away by newer IP like the incredible (and bonkers) Yakuza/Like a Dragon series, it is particularly special to get to draw a tribute to them. If you are as fond of SEGA and their incredible history as I am, you’ll want to keep an eye out for the upcoming remakes of Jet Set Radio, Golden Axe, Shinobi, Streets of Rage, and Crazy Taxi that got announced at the Game Awards. SEGA is a huge force in gaming today, and increasingly in the broader media landscape, and while they remain firmly committed to excellent games, they also commit to doing good for the world. I know that last bit to be true, in part because this is now their second year in a row generously donating to my CHOC fundraiser. Ultimately, I’m just a guy and I don’t have a huge following. They get nothing out of this aside from a chalk drawing and a thank you, but they continue to show up because they care about the cause. Thank you to all the folks at SEGA for your kindness, and for the excellence you continue to produce. In large part because of you, we are closing in on our goal, with just $4,218 left to go in the next 17 days. Its a big undertaking, but people like the fine folks at SEGA give me hope it can be done. If any individuals would like to help us hit the goal, or if any studios or publishers would like to follow SEGA’s amazing example, all support is appreciated: https://lnkd.in/gSyiH7t Here is this year’s 2D Sonic request, plus some past SEGA drawings to say thank you!"
