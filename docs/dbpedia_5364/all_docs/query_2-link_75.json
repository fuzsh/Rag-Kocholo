I was impressed! plus they have a good selection of hummers, what I have unlocked so far is the h1 SUT (with and ithout adv. pckg.) h1 wagon, h1 capback, h1 firetruck, h2 (bas and adv.) h2 SUT, H3 and H2 bling. so i definately got my $3 worth!\n\nHeres Some Gameplay Footage I made! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq6HzvItvUI"
