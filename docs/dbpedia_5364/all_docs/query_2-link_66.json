        "text": "In 1994, the then-budding Sonic the Hedgehog franchise hit one of its highest heights with the release of a game so big that it had to be split down the middle and released in two halves (blame a McDonald's deal for that; no, seriously): Sonic the Hedgehog 3 and Sonic & Knuckles. Using the innovative \"lock-on technology\" that allowed you to link 3 and & Knuckles together, you could experience the game as the massive epic that SEGA and Sonic Team envisioned. It saw Sonic and his kid buddy Tails exploring the enigmatic Angel Island in pursuit of the evil Doctor Eggman while running afoul of the island's guardian Knuckles the Echidna.\n\nThe levels were bigger and more expansive. The gameplay was at its absolute zenith in terms of quality. The story was ambitious, telling the tale of Eggman decieving Knuckles in order to steal the Master Emerald which held Angel Island in the sky and seeing Knuckles's transformation from unwitting pawn of the bad doctor to reluctant ally of the Blue Blur and his twin-tailed best bud... and then it went beyond, giving Knuckles his own storyline that saw him run through all the levels that Sonic ran through to do some clean-up, driving out what remained of Eggman's forces.\n\nOut of everything from Sonic 3 & Knuckles, Knuckles made the biggest impression, and I'm certain SEGA expected that. Knuckles was in practically everything after the game became a runaway smash, even getting his own game for the ill-fated Sega 32X add-on for the SEGA Genesis late in its lifespan and his own comic series from Archie Comics (a spin-off of their preexisting Sonic comics) penned by the infamous Ken Penders (\"best\" known for giving Knuckles an comical amount of relatives and some... decidedly disturbed storylines). Aside from his seriousness compared to everyone around him being comparatively goofier, Knuckles has always had an aura of mystery around him.\n\nWhere did he come from? Why is he the only echidna still around in the present day? How did Angel Island get in the sky? Some of these questions have been answered by SEGA themselves through the games (most notably Sonic Adventure, which is perhaps the deepest official dive into the echidnas' history), but even with that in mind, he's still something of an enigma. Unfortunately, Knuckles (like many characters) was subject to the rollercoaster of bad writing that plagued Sonic media outside of the comics from 2006-2020.\n\nThe gullibility that allowed Eggman to convince him that Sonic was evil was cranked up to blithering stupidity and his brute strength was diminished significantly. Somehow the same hands that knocked Sonic out of his Chaos Emerald-powered \"Super\" form were unable to defend him from tiny animals (Sonic Lost World) and he was so daft (especially in the failed Sonic Boom sub-franchise; this wasn't necessarily bad in Boom since it wasn't the \"main\" universe) that he'd make Richard Watterson look like Albert Einstein. For someone like me who got to know Knuckles through reading back issues of the Archie Sonic run, this characterization was disappointing.\n\nBut like the rest of the franchise, the live-action/animated hybrid movies directed by Jeff Fowler that were better than they had any right to be served as a welcome course correction for Knuckles. Sonic the Hedgehog 2 (which adapted elements of Sonic 2 the game and Sonic 3 and Knuckles; amusingly, lock-on technology let you play as Knuckles in Sonic 2, resulting in Knuckles in Sonic 2) featured Knuckles as the self-serious, formidable but gullible bruiser he once was in a somewhat loose adaptation of his game of origin. While several story details were changed to match up with the movieverse, his core arc of going from a misled rival to an ally of Sonic's was not only done in the film, but it was done well- astonishingly well, really.\n\nAnd here we are thirty years after Knuckles's game(s) of origin, with both Sonic the Hedgehog 3 (adapting elements of Sonic Adventure 2 and Shadow the Hedgehog to make good on what Sonic Movie 2 promised in its mid-credits scene) and Knuckles (a Paramount+ show) releasing. At the time I'm writing this, Sonic 3 the movie has yet to release, but Knuckles the show has. Prior to the show's release, I vowed to watch the show in full and deliver my thoughts on it.\n\nGranted, Paramount+ hasn't had the best track record with its original shows, especially when it comes to video game adaptations. Case in point, their adaptation of Halo seemed like it was trying too hard to be Paramount's equivalent to The Mandalorian (read about that disaster here). This article is based on my experience watching Knuckles, reviewing it episode-by-episode. I made sure to rewatch Sonic Movie 1 and Sonic Movie 2 beforehand just so I'd have the movieverse on my mind, and I decided to do a first and binge-watch the whole series in one day. So join me, won't you?\n\nDISCLAIMER: There will be SPOILERS for the first two Sonic movies and the Paramount+ Knuckles show throughout.\n\nSYNOPSIS\n\nIt's been a bit since Knuckles the Echidna (Idris Elba; still cast impeccably well) helped Sonic the Hedgehog (Ben Schwartz) and Tails (Colleen O'Shaughnessy, reprising her roles from the games c. 2010) defeated Doctor Ivo \"Eggman\" Robotnik. Unfortunately, with an absence of villains to fight, Knuckles has grown antsy. He's in the same position that Sonic was in a few years back- he's a fish out of water unsure of how to adapt to the new pond that is Earth.\n\nHis attempts to \"make himself at home\" have gotten him in hot water with his, Sonic and Tails's surrogate mother Maddie (Tika Sumpter), and he feels rather purposeless. That is, until he's visited by the spirit of his old tribe's chief Pachacamac (Christopher Lloyd, clearly enjoying himself), who gives him a new purpose of passing the echidnas' ways onto a new generation. Knuckles is game for this... until he sees the apprentice that Pachacamac has chosen.\n\nSaid apprentice is Wade Whipple (Adam Pally), buffoonish deputy to Sonic's adoptive father Tom. Like Knuckles, Wade is also down on his luck. He's just been booted from his bowling team for his incompetence (being replaced by a Girl Scout, no less!). His superior Jack Sinclair (Julian Barratt) further justifies kicking him out with the fact that Wade is just a loser schlub, not a warrior.\n\nDetermined to prove himself, Wade sets out to train- only to be greeted by Knuckles, who proposes training him in the ways of the echidna warrior. He accepts, and so the two set off to the \"Tournament of Champions\" in Reno, Nevada that Wade would've gone to had he not been kicked off Jack's team. However, something sinister's brewing in the background.\n\nSee, rogue Guardians of United Nations/GUN (secretive military organization w/ a rocky history with Sonic) agents Willoughby (Ellie Taylor) and Mason (Kid Cudi, the musician responsible for movie 2's \"Stars in the Sky\" credits music) are tracking Knuckles as he and Wade depart from Green Hills, Montana. Why they're so interested in him is simple- to sell Knuckles to an enigmatic arms dealer known as \"The Buyer\" (Rory McCann of Game of Thrones fame; I've heard he also makes a solid Megatron, too). Of course, catching the echidna is going to prove difficult, but the Buyer's got them covered; he's been engineering weapons charged by Knuckles's lost quills and offers them up to the agents.\n\nWhat will Knuckles and Wade learn from one another? Will they evade the triumvirate of the Buyer and the rogue GUN agents? And what secrets from the Whipple clan's past will be revealed?\n\nEPISODE 1: \"The Warrior\"\n\nIn terms of an introduction to the Knuckles show, \"The Warrior\" makes an incredibly strong first impression. It sets up many of the series's core themes, it establishes the Knuckles and Wade dynamic, and it balances the action and comedy quite well. It's also the only episode directed by Jeff Fowler, director of the first two films- and it shows.\n\nFor context, Fowler's history with the Sonic franchise goes all the way back to 2005's Shadow the Hedgehog, where he directed the game's opening cinematic (which gave him the chops necessary to handle the first and second movies). What I've noticed about Fowler's directing style is that he understands the visual language of Sonic enough to translate it into live-action, but he also knows how to do solid comedy and action with the live-action actors that'd appeal to more casual Sonic fans or non-fans who are only here to see Jim Carrey kick it old-school. He gets what makes us fans happy, but he's not so wrapped up in lore and C-tier character inclusions as to alienate the people who don't know what a Knuckles is.\n\nThis episode feels like a direct transition from movie 2 to the series, complete with an opening that sees Knuckles mistake some repairmen's attempted work on the Wachowski household (which he punched several holes through in his debut movie) for an attack. Apparently it's the fourth time it's happened, going off of what Tails said. Speaking of which, this is the only episode to feature Sonic and Tails- a welcome show of restraint, really.\n\nIt'd have been easy for Sonic and Tails to pop up intermittently throughout the show as a reminder that this was a Sonic movie universe (or SMU, if SEGA and Paramount want an official name for it) show, but I appreciate that the show trusted its audience to enjoy Knuckles and Wade's dynamic enough that it was willing to leave its two most popular characters as episode 1-only characters. The two of them had movie 2 to bond; let them rest for a bit until movie 3 rolls around. Besides, both Schwartz-as-Sonic and O'Shaughnessy-as-Tails make the most of their limited screen time: Sonic has grown up quite a bit between movie 2 and this show without losing his endearing enthusiasm; Tails seems to be taking after his new surrogate mother's care for animals.\n\nMaddie is also limited to episode 1, and this might've been her strongest showing in the movieverse thus far. That's not to say Tika Sumpter has been denied a chance to shine in movies 1 and 2, but often she's been playing a supporting role to James Marsden as Tom (with the only real exception being her and her sister Rachel fighting GUN agents in movie 2). Here. she puts her foot down in response to Knuckles's excessive \"making himself at home\" and demonstrates her responsibilities as the mother figure to these CGI critters. It's a good moment (and I like the implication that Sonic's been grounded before and had to learn what that meant).\n\nKnuckles himself is in line with how he was in movie 2- a blunt, self-serious warrior struggling with basic social conventions- with the added note of him struggling with the idea of what home means for him. With the fall of his tribe and him now being on the other side of the universe, he's resigned himself to the belief that an echidna warrior like himself has no home but what amounts to the echidna equivalent to Valhalla from Norse myth. It's a great contrast to Sonic's arc from the first movie- where Sonic had come to enjoy Earth but was deeply lonely, Knuckles has new family and friends but has yet to accept Earth as home.\n\nAfter being grounded for his \"making himself at home\", Knuckles attempts to reach out to echidna elders of a bygone era, and he ends up greeted by the ghost of Pachacamac, who is very much not used to being a ghost (w/ humorous results). For those unfamiliar with the character, Pachacamac was the chief of the ancient Knuckles clan (who Knuckles himself was named for). Aside from his name and appearance, Knuckles's depiction of Pachacamac has little in common with his game counterpart, being far more jovial than the strict, curmudgeonly Pachacamac from Sonic Adventure.\n\nThe decision to make Pachacamac more comedic is something of a double-edged sword in my mind. On one hand, Christopher Lloyd sounds like he's having a blast and he's written decently in both this episode and his second and final appearance three episodes later, being key to both Knuckles and Wade's development. On the other hand, though, he's a rather large departure from his original iteration (a first for the movieverse, which had been deeply faithful to the game characterizations up to until this point) and I feel like the show missed a golden opportunity with him.\n\nSee, in the first Sonic movie, the echidna warrior who shoots Longclaw (Sonic's owl surrogate mother) had a design that was inspired by Pachacamac's tribal garb. Whether he was meant to be Pachacamac is still up for debate, but prior to watching the show, I had a theory that Pachacamac would reveal that he was the one who downed Longclaw to Knuckles... who would react with horror because he has no idea how to break this news to Sonic. Granted, there was no real way to slip that into the show without feeling like it was a jarring tone shift or if it was just there to satisfy diehards like me who thought Longclaw's assassin was some old guy from the first 3D Sonic game back in '98, but still.\n\nIn regards to game faithfulness, Pachacamac being so far removed from his game canon self is a slight blemish on the movieverse's track record. While Ben Schwartz, Colleen O'Shaughnessy, Jim Carrey, Idris Elba, and the films' writers have all made Sonic, Tails, Eggman and Knuckles their own (especially Carrey), there's still a very clear reverence for who these characters are/were at their best in how they were translated from pixels/polygons to the big screen. With Pachacamac being so different from his canon self, that introduces a level of concern for how future lesser-known characters will be handled. Can we trust the writers to handle the likes of Emerl (Sonic Battle), Blaze the Cat (Sonic Rush) or the Babylon Rogues Jet, Wave and Storm (Sonic Riders)* if they treat a character like Knuckles's only canon ancestor in such a flippant way?\n\n*This isn't to say that those five are coming to the movieverse anytime soon. Out of those five, I think Blaze has the best chances since Paramount could use her to do a girl-oriented spin-off show and/or movie (she's basically Frozen's Elsa but with fire instead of ice), but I think that the Rogues would be fun if they wanted to do a Riders-inspired animated series sometime in the future.\n\nRegardless of my concerns with how the show reworked Pachacamac, he is critical to Knuckles and Wade's plots intertwining and convincing ol' Rad Red to take the schlub under his metaphorical wing. Heck, the show even implements a 1 Samuel 16:7 reference- something that will become a central theme for the show. Speaking of which, how is Wade's story getting started?\n\nWell, dear reader, I think it started wonderfully. Again, Fowler understands that if you want to get the widest audience possible with Sonic movieverse media, you need to make sure both the human and hedgehog-adjacent plots blend together. Where Knuckles is struggling with the idea of home and finding new purpose, Wade is struggling to be taken seriously and be a good bowler.\n\nIf you want to know how bad things are going for him, he gets booted off his bowling team after costing his team victory... to a Girl Scout. Said Girl Scout ends up replacing him thanks to Jack's disappointment with how non-warrior-y Wade is (and also because the Girl Scout's parents have a stretch hummer). Contrast that against how determined Wade is to do well, and you have a recipe for immediate audience sympathy for him.\n\nThanks to my rewatch of the first two movies (especially the second movie), I had a feeling that Wade would make an excellent leading man for the Knuckles series, and this first episode confirmed that feeling. Adam Pally is great at being a pathetic manchild, he's got a knack for good physical comedy, and he and Idris Elba have surprisingly fun chemistry. It's a perfect mirror to Sonic and Tom's dynamic from the first movie: where Tom was the straight man to Sonic's shenanigans in movie 1, Knuckles makes Knuckles the straight man to Wade (however, they're usually each other's straight man).\n\nCase in point, their first real bonding moment in this episode sees them realize they have something in common. Where Knuckles was betrayed by Eggman and many others before him, Wade's father abandoned him in a TJ Maxx (a TJ Maxx, of all places!) after years of having spent time with him bowling. Bowling became a comfort to Wade in the same way Knuckles made his warrioring a comfort in a world where he seemingly has no purpose other than fulfilling his vow to protect the Master Emerald.\n\nIt's a great first step in developing their relationship: Knuckles has a better idea of why Wade wants to win the bowling tournament so badly; Wade gets a confidence boost from the echidna's encouragement. Things like that successfully capture the buddy comedy vibes of movie 1 that movie 2 lost in its pursuit of being \"more Sonic\". Y'know, maybe I should elaborate on that.\n\nIn the two years since the second movie came out (and after my rewatch of both films), I've come to realize that I prefer the first Sonic movie over the second one, and the reason why is because movie 1 had more heart. Sonic and Tom's friendship and its sincerity grounded the film, and the second movie lost that by keeping them separate for so much of its runtime (not helped by the fake wedding sequence eating up a fourth of the film) and relying so much on Sonic iconography and references to carry its admittedly thinner story. Movie 2 might be a better Sonic story (and it got Tails and Knuckles right following an era where neither of them were written well), but movie 1 is the better movie (in my opinion).\n\nLeaning more into what movie 1 did well was the right move from the Knuckles staff. The show doesn't need to flash Sonic imagery everywhere to make the Sonic fan parts of our brains happy or introduce lore and characters from the games at a mile a minute; all it needs to do is tell a solid story that can work if you're not a Sonic diehard and be faithful enough to earn diehard fans' approval. That should extend out into all video game adaptations, but I don't want to get too far off topic.\n\nI have to praise the show for actually making efforts to explain where the rogue GUN agents got their tech and showing that they had some rings on hand (which they use to send their superior to the mushroom planet from movie 1). While the tech is explained as the products of the Buyer's experimentation with Knuckles's quills and repaired Eggman tech, the rings are not. Then again, considering Sonic lost a bag full of rings in Siberia back in movie 2, perhaps GUN found those scattered rings and confiscated them before Willoughby and Mason got their mitts on them.\n\nThe show could've just gone, \"oh, they stole some of Knuckles's quills like Eggman did in movie 1\", but no, there's a guy who exists to provide that tech and has been producing these weapons for a while now. It's a smart worldbuilding move (and one that makes even more sense in light of episode 5). If Sonic, Tails and Knuckles have been running all over the world and if even just ONE of Sonic's quills has the power to make one of Eggman's vehicles go as fast as the Blue Blur, then logically aspiring crooks or government officials would do anything to have them.\n\nWilloughby and Mason are fun baddies- not the most serious types (Willoughby is the more self-serious of the two), but enough of a threat to work as villains for most of the show. While this isn't my favorite showing of them (that would be the next episode), they make a solid first impression and have a great fight scene against Knuckles and Wade in the bowling alley. One of Knuckles's greatest strengths as a show is the fact that we get to see some decently-choreographed fight scenes like the bowling alley brawl in this episode.\n\nCudi and Taylor apparently did their own stunts for this scene, and what they get to do here ain't half bad. Despite having Knuckles outnumbered two-to-one, it's a pretty even fight and a good showcase of both sides' strengths and weaknesses. However, Knuckles's arrogance after seemingly beating Mason costs him his victory, resulting in Willoughby slipping a ring under him and transporting him into a cage in the back of the truck. Noticing that Mason lost his supercharged gauntlets during the fight, Wade has what he describes as \"an incredibly dumb idea\"... and that's where episode 1 ends.\n\n\"The Warrior\", like a well-charged spin dash, gets Knuckles going in the right direction. Core themes and character dynamics are established, there's solid action and comedy, and it feels like a direct continuation of what the first two movies set up. It's an incredibly solid start to the story being told and one of the show's best episodes.\n\nEPISODE 2: \"Don't Ever Say I Wasn't There For You\"\n\nThis episode will be the make or break episode for first-time viewers. It's either a fitting continuation of where episode 1 left off or the first bad sign that this show will be more about Wade than it is about Knuckles. I lean more towards the former conclusion- yes, the episode is Wade-heavy, but with good reason since Knuckles is being held in Willoughby and Mason's little prison cell.\n\nIn fact, I've noticed that Knuckles has gotten a lot of flak from Sonic fans for not having enough Knuckles in it. I understand that- in fact, I wish that the back half of the show had more Knuckles screen time (more on that when we get to it)- but you have to consider what the show has to work with. I can't imagine Knuckles had a terribly big CGI budget, and the production team clearly wanted to make the most of it.\n\nKnuckles's VFX are quite nice for a streaming show, and a lot of that came from the staff making very intentional choices throughout the show's run. If you do the math, Knuckles is in about 42% of his own show- not a great percentage, but it's a respectable amount for a show like this. I would rather have a show where an all-CGI main character looks believably part of their surroundings and makes the trade-off of having that character show up less than a show that trades CGI quality for that character having more screen time.\n\nBesides, Wade as a character is in need of far more development than Knuckles is. Knuckles had his redemption in Sonic Movie 2 and really only needs to get a better grip on Earth culture and seeing the blue planet as his new home; Wade was only a bit player in both movies up to this point. Ergo, the show needed to do some serious heavy lifting to get us invested in Wade as an actual character rather than just seeing him as that funny loser cop whose car got hijacked by Tails in the second movie.\n\nThat being said, let's talk about the actual episode. This one's all about Wade's efforts to save Knuckles from Willoughby and Mason using the tech he pilfered from the latter and what he thinks will make for a super cool rescue. Despite his incompetence and lack of fighting experience hindering said plans, he manages to rescue Knux and the two have a sweet heart-to-heart in the end.\n\nIf the first episode didn't convince you that Wade could work as a leading man, this episode would. Pally's primarily playing him as goofy, yes, but there's range within the goofiness. Just compare his comedically over-the-top rescue sequence that he envisions to what actually happens- he imagines himself as this suave 007-type who effortlessly takes down Willoughby and Mason (complete w/ Bonnie Taylor's \"Holding Out for a Hero\" as background music); in reality, his attempt at activating the quill-powered gauntlets causes a chain of events that blows up his cop car (meaning he's officially lost two cop cars at this point in the movieverse).\n\nWade ain't just a goofball, though. This episode demonstrates his true character as this nigh-unflappable, innovative, resilient and positive guy willing to do anything he's set his mind to. Even when his initial plan fails to come to fruition, he remains determined to rescue his new mentor from the GUN agents and he's actually pretty good at fighting against Mason during a 1v1 between them. It's kinda impressive that I'm able to get this much out of him from a character analysis standpoint only two episodes in.\n\nWilloughby and Mason, in my opinion, have their strongest showing here. Willoughby finds herself having to be the straight man (woman?) to Knuckles's grisly plans on exact revenge against her and Mason and also hints towards having something of a superiority complex about her studies of extraterrestrials; Mason's cruel streak is contrasted amusingly against the implication that he's a mama's boy. It's more than we got in episode 1, but it's significantly better about expanding upon their characters than episode 5 is because it allows the audience to see these new attributes rather than be told them through exposition dumps (which is what episode 5 does).\n\nDespite spending most of this episode in a box, Knuckles is great here. His ramblings about doing horrible things to the GUN agents are darkly amusing (doubly so when you consider how Wade's plans are only a degree removed from his plans in terms of brutality), he gets a chance to glide (third time he's done it in the movieverse), and there's a great chat between him and Wade about what constitutes \"home\", how past betrayals have affected them, and where young Mr. Whipple is on a scale of one to warrior near the end of the episode. This episode's purpose in Knuckles's development is to show him Wade's best qualities in spite of what his lesser traits do to obscure them, and he leaves this one recognizing Wade as stronger than he thinks he is.\n\nMy critiques of the episode are limited to these three. First, Wade's victory over Willoughby came a bit too easily. His fight against Mason works because there's genuine tension and it takes him quite a bit to overpower him, but all it takes is one misaimed gauntlet launching and Willoughby ends up knocked out in the ensuing explosion. It's a bit too dumb luck-based for my liking, and it seems like the writers realized this because it's the only time Wade gets out of a situation because of dumb luck.\n\nSecond, the scene in which Wade is flung around by a malfunctioning gauntlet is rather janky compared to the other VFX in the show, which is kinda sad considering that this episode was directed by the award-nominated supervisor of Iron Man 2's VFX. Third and lastly, this is Willoughby and Mason's final appearance until the second-to-last episode. While they loom over the next two episodes in the form of a bounty they put on Wade's head (which I see as a better version of Tom being marked as an aspiring terrorist by the government for punching Eggman in the first movie), I'd have rather they showed up at least one more time between this episode and the last two.\n\n\"Don't Ever Say I Wasn't There For You\", as stated at the start of this section, is the episode that will probably make or break one's investment in the show. Some will be turned off by how much this episode is about Wade, but I'd argue that it's key for both understanding his character better and fleshing out his and Knuckles's relationship. It's definitely on the higher end of the show, but there are some cracks starting to show that threaten to spoil the sweet grape soda that this show has been thus far.\n\nBonus: You might miss it thanks to the Paramount+ autoplayer trying to skip past it, but the credits are scored by \"Frickin' Human Race\" by Asa Taccone, a delightfully corny 80s synth tune recapping Knuckles's arc from the second movie and describing his arc in this show. While \"The Warrior\" by Scandal works as a theme song for the show, part of me is convinced that this song was considered as a potential main theme before being cut.\n\nEPISODE 3: \"The Shabbat Dinner\"\n\nI don't know if this was intentional or not, but this show managed to release near the end of Passover 2024 and during the Professional Bowlers Association's Tournament of Champions (which the show's own tournament is meant to be a send-up of). If it was, I'd have to applaud Paramount for choosing a release date that fits the show's central themes- especially those of this episode. \"The Shabbat Dinner\" is a sweet look into Wade's extended family and home life that sees Knuckles become fascinated by Jewish culture and traditions, but it's dragged down by some painfully generic bounty hunters.\n\nIn light of recent events at the time I'm writing this that I won't name here for the sake of not attracting attention from individuals in serious need of history lessons, it was honestly rather sweet to not only see Judaism be respected and represented accurately, but to have Knuckles be legitimately interested in Jewish food and history. Of course, it's mainly because he and Wade's mother see eye-to-eye on their people's sufferings, but still. It's neat seeing Paramount offer an olive branch to the Jewish people in an era where they're receiving undue hate for their nation of origin's actions against a terrorist organization.\n\nThis episode marks the first appearances of series mainstays Wanda (Edi Patterson from Knives Out) and Wendy Whipple (Stockard Channing, Betty from Paramount's own Grease)- and I think both are welcome additions to the cast. Between the two, I prefer Wendy thanks to her surprisingly fun chemistry with Knuckles, but that's not to say I dislike Wanda. Many Sonic fans found Wanda annoying, but for me, she only teeters on the edge of being unbearable.\n\nFrom a writing standpoint, Wanda is meant to be Wade but a woman, an FBI agent and more obnoxious. For the most part, she succeeds in being that. She and Wade have believable sibling chemistry and Patterson plays the part of an in-over-her-head bimbo surprisingly well. I still haven't seen Knives Out (my trust of Rian Johnson is low after seeing what he did to Star Wars), but if she's able to blend into a part like she did here, then I might have to give it a shot to see what she's capable of.\n\nWendy is perhaps the strongest addiction to the cast since Knuckles began. Stockard Channing gives her a strong presence among the cast, she's simultaneously very sweet and very no-nonsense, and she's surprisingly competent as a fighter, having taught Krav Maga in the past (which is Israeli self-defense, apparently; I was NOT expecting to learn this much). She just wants to have what remains of her family home for the Sabbath, and by the end of the episode, she gets that. And as stated above, she's got good chemistry with Knuckles and their dynamic is easily the best part of the episode.\n\nAs for Wade himself, this episode continues to flesh him out and expand upon his backstory. Even his own family (especially Wanda, although she's really no better than him sometimes) sees him as a pathetic schlub and it turns out that his father is none other than \"Pistol Pete\" Whipple, an esteemed bowler who's going to attend the Tournament of Champions- the very reason why Wade wanted to go in the first place. While it's a bit contrived that his absentee father is in the same place that he and Knux made the destination of their journey, it's at least justified given how much the show has been pushing the fact Wade learned to love bowling because of his pops's influence.\n\nA character detail that I think is frankly funnier as a long-time Sonic fan is how incensed Knuckles is by the fact Wade's father walked out on the Whipple family. See, in his Archie Comics Sonic run, Ken Penders created a large expanded cast for Knuckles, including his long-absentee father, Locke (who Ken based on his own father). Locke was a decidedly terrible father whose actions ranged from exposing Knuckles to Chaos Emerald radiation as a baby to grooming him into what later Archie Sonic writer Ian Flynn would call \"the hot pocket of destiny\" to faking his own death in hopes of making Knuckles more independent... and tragically, Penders wanted to make it so Locke was in the RIGHT for doing all these terrible things to his son.\n\nI still don't get what Penders saw in Locke. Maybe it was a misguided effort to confront his own daddy issues through giving Knuckles those same issues, but the Sonic comics certainly weren't the place to do it. During his run on the comics, Ian Flynn addressed the issues of how Locke was depicted by having Knuckles become the echidna messiah that his father wanted him to be... turning him into a self-righteous Chaos energy-fueled brute bent on echidna supremacy. Locke was horrified at what his treatment of Knuckles had done to his son and sacrificed himself so that his son might be set free from his current state. And then Locke was erased from the comics entirely due to a legal dispute between Penders, SEGA, Archie, and BioWare. It was a whole thing.\n\nHowever, I get the feeling that SEGA themselves were so embarrassed by how terrible of a character Locke was that they made it a rule for the movieverse creative staff that if movieverse Knuckles was going to have a father, he would have to be a genuinely good father. From that one glimpse of him we see in the second movie, movie!Knuckles's pops seems like a responsible, strong man who Knuckles would have every reason to look up to. That upbringing is what gives him such a raw, unfiltered distaste for Pete walking out on the Whipple clan- he had a good father, so he can't imagine why a father would just leave his family with no regard for their future well-being.\n\nHowever, I feel like the episode falters when it comes to involving its antagonists. A group of nameless bounty hunters learn of the bounty placed on Wade's head and storm the Whipple house in search of the man, only to be fended off by Wanda, Wendy, and Knuckles. While the resulting fight scenes are far from bad (there's a wonderful one-take shot in which Knuckles and Wendy fight the thugs while the scene rotates around the Shabbat candles), I find the thugs themselves to be quite lacking.\n\nWhy I'm so ruffled by this episode's thugs is that they're so... generic. Perhaps that was the point given the showrunners and writers have stated that a lot of 80s/90s buddy comedies and action movies were influential on Knuckles's writing. However, in a show with two rogue government agents who masterfully toe the line between being humorous and legit threats, an absurdist bounty hunter, and a hammy, criminally underutilized arms dealer, they ironically stand out because of the fact they don't stand out and are played so painfully straight in a show that thrived on weird comedy or exaggerated caricatures.\n\nRegardless of my feelings on these nameless grunts in pursuit of the bounty on Wade's head... I can't bring myself to hate \"The Shabbat Dinner\" as an episode. It further expands upon Wade's background, it's respectful towards Jewish culture and the Jewish people, and both Patterson and Channing are welcome additions to the cast. It's also, unfortunately, the only episode that really gets something wonderful out of Knuckles's interactions with the extended Whipple clan. I'd've loved to see more out of him and Wendy's dynamic.\n\nEPISODE 4: \"The Flames of Disaster\"\n\nBefore we go any further, I must explain Schrödinger's cat. This thought experiment involves a cat trapped in a box with something that could kill it. You don't know if the cat is alive and well or dead and not well until you open the box, and until you do so, the cat is somehow both dead and alive. Now, why did I bring that up?\n\nWell, \"The Flames of Disaster\", like Schrödinger's cat being both dead AND alive, is simultaneously the worst and best episode of Knuckles. On one hand, it's the most outlandish episode of the entire show with the least amount of Knuckles screen time. On the other hand, though... it's one of the funniest episodes of the whole show with genuine character development for Wade, interesting lore implications, and some nice practical effects. It is one of those things that has to be experienced rather than just explained to you.\n\nUnfortunately, we can't progress any further without me attempting to explain what this episode does right and wrong, so I'm going to explain it without going too in-depth on the spoilers.\n\nPut simply, this episode is about Wade's efforts to escape Jack Sinclair by better understanding where Knuckles's strength came from... in a very unconventional way. Right off the bat, the episode has some issues. Wade gets kidnapped by Jack, and... Knuckles refuses to help him under the very thin justification of \"he must learn to rescue himself.\" While Knuckles DOES play a part in Wade's development in this episode, it's perhaps the least justified reason for keeping him offscreen has. You'd think that after three episodes of getting to know him better, the echidna would do anything for his mentee, but no. Gotta save that CGI money somehow.\n\nWhat's more, this episode suffers from being excessively cartoony in places. Granted, there are places where that silliness works to the episode's favor (several, in fact), but this episode cranks up Jack's eccentricities to a level that feels at odds with the situation. There are moments when his absurdity works (such as his final duel with Wade or somehow managing to get a mobile lion cage from Facebook Marketplace), but having him badly sing karaoke and try to get the Girl Scout's deeply concerned parents involved is just... no.\n\nConversely, this episode acts as the one most focused on Wade's development and (albeit indirectly) Knuckles's backstory. Through meditation and the guidance of Pachacamac (who adopts a bowling alley employee's outfit to make Wade more comfortable), he enters into a rock opera retelling Knuckles's origins (with him as Knuckles) in order to understand the source of Knuckles's strength. While he initially takes the wrong conclusion from this vision, he ends up coming to the right conclusion, learning that Knuckles's strength comes not from his fists, but from his heart- bringing the first episode's 1 Samuel 16:7 reference full circle.\n\nWhile the rock opera sequence is self-deprecatingly described as \"low-budget\" by Pachacamac, it's pretty impressive from a technical level. It's difficult enough to make something with practical effects in this day and age, but it's even more difficult to make something that looks convincingly \"bad\" without it crossing over into actually being terrible. At one point, Knuckles's gliding is replicated by Wade wearing an all-black jumpsuit while wearing a hollowed-out Knuckles plush strung up behind his head; at another point, Knuckles's father is represented by a comedically bad-looking puppet (one that bears a slight resemblance to Ken Penders) in his dying moments. Jolly good \"bad\" stuff.\n\nIn having Wade play Knuckles within the rock opera section, the parallels between the two are taken to their natural endpoint. Since the echidnas were at war with warrior owls (see the second movie), those who tear Wade down are dressed as owls- chief among them being Sinclair dressed as Longclaw as he sings about how pathetic Wade-as-Knuckles is. Both have lost their fathers, although in very different contexts.\n\nSomething that's irked many fans is that the death of Knuckles's father as depicted in the second movie and Knuckles seem to be at odds with one another. Knuckles himself states that he never saw his father again after he went off to the battle that resulted in Longclaw's death in the second movie; Sinclair-as-Longclaw sings that Knuckles's father died protecting Knuckles from some owl warriors. My theory is that the battle reached the village after enough fighting had gone on and kid Knuckles attempted to intervene to help his father, but that's merely my attempt to marry the two accounts. It's odd that whoever wrote this episode didn't consult whoever was in charge of the movieverse lore to make sure that Sonic 2 and Knuckles's accounts of the loss of Knuckles's father (who I jokingly call \"Kheye\" as a jab at Locke) were consistent.\n\nOne of the biggest surprises of the episode had to be the reveal that Knuckles fought and defeated a fire demon, harnessing its \"Flames of Disaster\" as a force for good. For long-time Sonic fans, this demon will be recognizable as the movieverse version of Iblis, the world-destroying monster from the infamous 2006 Sonic the Hedgehog game (aka Sonic '06 for the sake of simplicity). Like Pachacamac, the inclusion of Iblis in Knuckles is baffling.\n\nSomehow we're getting insane deep cuts like them before we get franchise mainstays like the Chaotix or Rouge the Bat- both of whom would be ideal picks for a show about Knuckles. However, I find the inclusion of Iblis within Knuckles to be worthwhile. Like the owls and Sinclair-as-Longclaw, it personifies all those who demean Wade as nothing more than a weak, flabby manchild and also incorporates Jack's use of Facebook Marketplace. It's a good balance between maintaining game-accuracy with how grave of a threat that Iblis is and doing something original for the movieverse by introducing it in such an absurd way and making it half-Sinclair, half-Iblis.\n\nAs Wade-as-Knuckles discovers his true strength from his heart (with the aid of Michael Bolton's vocals), he gains control over the Flames of Disaster that Iblis once commanded and destroys the lava demon. The implication that Knuckles not only defeated Iblis during his search for the Master Emerald, but managed to turn the apocalypse-triggering Flames of Disaster (if the movieverse Flames function as they do in the games) into a force for good is honestly... awesome. It prevents us from having to suffer through a movieverse adaptation of Sonic '06 AND emphasizes how meek Knuckles truly is. A bit blind to sarcasm and metaphors, yes, but able to control the raw power that radiates from his quills and tame the Flames of Disaster.\n\nHaving found his own flame through experiencing Knuckles finding his, Wade escapes the cage and challenges Sinclair to a final duel- a joust, really (amusingly, Wade ends up borrowing a kid's bike while Sinclair rides his motorcycle). The ensuing final battle is short, swift, silly (Sinclair leaves the show short of a bike, a ponytail, and his jacket), and ends the episode with Wade returning to the Whipple household a better man. Seeing what Wade has become, Knuckles deems him ready to go forth and win the Tournament of Champions.\n\nA detail that I think the episode could've made a bit more clear is what becomes of the Girl Scout and her parents following Sinclair's defeat and subsequent humiliation. In the next two episodes, it's made clear that she sided with Wade as part of a new bowling team known as \"The Warriors\", but this episode doesn't really touch on that much. Maybe they could've cut down on some of the more cringeworthy attempts at jokes outside of the musical sequence so that could be included, but I'm not the one who was in the editing room for this show.\n\nThis episode has the most Jack Sinclair screentime, and I think Julian Barratt did well with the part... somewhat. There are moments like the karaoke scenes where I feel like he suffers from what I've dubbed the \"Alec Baldwin effect\" (in which otherwise fine actors overact in efforts to appeal to kids; see Baldwin's parts in Thomas and the Magic Railroad or the 2003 disasterpiece The Cat in the Hat), but for the most part, he kills it with his unhinged comments about his beef with the Rainforest Cafe birds or his performance as not-Longclaw in the rock opera sequence. And that's kinda the best way to describe \"The Flames of Disaster\".\n\nThere are places where I feel like this episode is trying too hard to be silly, but it's so earnest about what it is that it's hard to stay mad at it. Could this episode have used more Knuckles? Yes. However, in making this episode solely about Wade, it allows him to most clearly see the parallels between his struggles and those that plagued Knuckles in the past; ergo, it's a strangely effective character study that's heavy on character development for one Mr. Whipple.\n\nAlso, Wade spends most of the episode wearing a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles shirt I've had for a few years now. Not saying that's either good, bad or weird; just pointing it out because it's neat.\n\nEPISODE 5: \"Reno, Baby\"\n\nNext to the previous episode, \"Reno, Baby\" is perhaps the worst when it comes to Knuckles screentime. He's only in what seems like a sixth of this episode- more than \"Flames of Disaster\", but far from the ideal amount. Not only that, but the episode grinds to a halt in the middle for the sake of spewing exposition about the Buyer, Willoughby and Mason's backstories. However, what the episode does with Wade and Pete's relationship is quite nice, to the point where even a somewhat predictable plot twist is forgivable.\n\nUpon arrival in Reno, Knuckles and Wade run into Pete, who seems oddly unfazed by the return of his son into his life and surprisingly repentant about his past actions. Despite Wendy's concerns about her ex-husband's true intentions, Wade's just happy to have his pops back in his life. Meanwhile, Willoughby and Mason make moves to capture Knuckles for the Buyer... and they might have more help in doing so than initially expected.\n\nA major, nigh-immediate highlight of the episode is Pistol Pete himself, played with smarmy, self-aggrandizing swagger by Cary Elwes (Westley from The Princess Bride). He's a delightfully pompous con man who loves himself but is capable of playing the part of the repentant, loving father that Wade desperately wants him to be. Elwes does a great job making Pete's faux affability seem genuine, and when he reveals his true colors, you just want to slug him right in his perfectly punchable face.\n\nAdam Pally gives yet another solid performance- heck, I'd argue it's his best performance out of all six episodes. Wade gets put through the emotional wringer this episode, and Pally's performance really helps carry the episode. While Knuckles's back half could have used more of Knuckles himself, I appreciate that the show trusted the audience enough to be invested in Wade's ongoing arc just as much as the Sonic stuff.\n\nThe PBA Tournament of Champions content within the episode is quite fun, with delightful team names, slick montages, and a pair of snarky announcers representing ESPN's \"the Ocho\" (referencing both Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story and the real \"The Ocho\" programming block that showcases obscure sports). It all comes down to Whipple vs Whipple, father vs son, and Wade vs Pete- moments before tensions between them are heightened by Pete's betrayal. Speaking of which...\n\nPete sells Wade and Knuckles out to Willoughby and Mason, holding his ex-wife and daughter hostage in return for a captive Knuckles. As stated earlier, this moment is an absolute gut punch for Wade and the audience because, up until this point, Pete seems to be sincere about having changed. The show successfully makes us want to believe Wade's father isn't a deadbeat who left his family behind so he could feed his ego and then rips the positive facade he'd been putting up away, revealing the scumbag he is beneath.\n\nOne part of \"Reno, Baby\" I find deeply frustrating is the entire sequence in which Willoughby and Mason renegotiate the terms of their deal with the Buyer. It's an extremely exposition-heavy sequence that feels like the show is trying to play catch-up with its villains after wasting so much time on Sinclair and the thugs from \"The Shabbat Dinner\". Ergo, Willoughby and the Buyer spew information about their past relationships with GUN and Eggman, explaining why they are where they are in the present.\n\nIt's a shame that the show waited up until now to really flesh out its biggest bad (the Buyer) or Willoughby and Mason because what information we get about the former duo and GUN as an organization is legitimately interesting for the most part. Both he and her were shuffled around following Eggman's expulsion from GUN, with him becoming a black arms dealer and her being relocated to an entirely different department within GUN to prevent another extraterrestrial studies specialist from going \"full Eggman\". This could've been revealed earlier in the story, but no; it's awkwardly shoehorned into the penultimate episode with little time to really ruminate on that reveal\n\nThe only information revealed in the exposition dump that I find to be rather odd is that proto-GUN was run by Eggman before Sonic became his prime target. I understand that it's in line with movieverse Eggman's previous status as a freelance government scientist, but it's inconsistent for him to be the head of a government group when the first movie showed that he had terrible people skills and worked only with his machines and Agent Stone. That, and GUN having been established so recently is going to create continuity problems for Shadow's arc in the third movie (for context, GUN employed Eggman's grandfather/Shadow's creator Gerald Robotnik and executed both him and his granddaughter/Eggman's cousin Maria because they thought \"Project Shadow\" was getting out hand).\n\nAnother aspect of \"Reno, Baby\" I find deeply frustrating is the lack of Knuckles. Granted, I already praised the writers for how well they handled the penultimate chapter of Wade's arc for this show, but we're only one episode away from the finale of Knuckles and Knuckles himself seems to be appearing in the show less and less, to the point where you could edit him out of this episode and you'd barely miss anything. The only real relevance Knuckles has to this episode is 1) helping Wade approach his father for the first time in years (with humorous results) and 2) being seemingly set up for a major betrayal by Wade.\n\nEmphasis on seemingly- the very next episode reveals that Knuckles was made aware of Willoughby and Mason's gambit to get him in the Buyer's mitts within its opening minutes. This writing decision practically kills all the tension that this episode was building up to, resulting in what seems like Wade setting up Knuckles for a betrayal coming off as utterly pointless. In fact, as I was watching this episode, I was honestly convinced the writers were going to have Wade and Knuckles have a last-minute falling out over this supposed betrayal.\n\nIt would've been thematically appropriate considering how many betrayals Knuckles has been through and served as a final test of their relationship. However, we didn't get that due to the show's increasingly tighter and tighter CGI budget as it draws to a close. Things like this and the rushed exposition dump of the Buyer and Willoughby's backstory honestly make me wish that Knuckles either had more episodes or was compressed down into a direct-to-Paramount+ movie so it'd be forced to focus on the most important aspects of the story the writers wanted to tell.\n\nThe latter option is rather interesting because it forces ME to ask \"what story aspects are most important to Knuckles from a story standpoint?\". If Knuckles were a movie, I'd merge the first two episodes into one, with Wade saving Knuckles from the rogue GUN agents in the bowling alley and Willoughby and Mason putting a bounty on Wade's head. Episode 3 remains mostly the same, save for the generic thugs being exchanged for Sinclair abducting Wade at night and Knuckles trying to rescue him.\n\nEpisode 4 plays out as it did save for the addition of Knuckles being more proactive, Episode 5 is cut back on severely (with only the bare essential plot beats), and Episode 6 remaining mostly as-is. The Willoughby/Buyer backstory reveal would be expanded upon, written more naturally and slotted into the story earlier (maybe during their first encounter to provide context for who they are), and it'd have more of Knuckles himself. Instead of the 43% or so screentime he has in the show proper, he'd probably be in about 78% of the hypothetical movie version of Knuckles.\n\n\"Reno, Baby\" is my least favorite episode of the Knuckles show, and that's a shame because I really wanted this episode to be something great. While it handles the progression of Wade's storyline well, makes Pete a very punchable character by the time it's over and reveals interesting backstory material for both the Buyer and Willoughby, it feels like the product of the show's budget running low near the end and the writers kinda wasting an entire episode slot on \"The Flames of Disaster\" (which I think is a necessary episode for Wade's personal development). We desperately needed more Knuckles and Willoughby and Mason screentime in the show's back half, and this episode suffered greatly for its absence.\n\nEPISODE 6: \"What Happens in Reno Stays in Reno\"\n\nAfter the prior two episodes, one would have good reason to worry that Knuckles would be sidelined at the end of his own show. Thankfully, Knuckles sticks the landing in the end with its final episode, giving both him and Wade solid resolutions to their arcs. It's still on the lower rungs of quality, but it's probably the best of the last three episodes.\n\nThe episode opens with the anticlimax of Knuckles revealing that he already knew about Willoughby and Mason's gambit and taking down the rogue agents. Like the bowling alley fight from the first episode, this is a well-choreographed sequence in which both parties are solid combatants and one where both Knux and Wade get time to shine. Doesn't hurt that the fight is scored by \"Saturday Night's Alright for a Fight\" by Elton John. Whoever was in charge of picking out the licensed music, you get my kudos for at least picking out thematically appropriate songs for each scene.\n\nThe defeat of Willoughby and Mason via them being trapped in a void created by two rings going at once is... surprisingly dark for what the show had offered up until this point. I get that they probably weren't going to carry into the movieverse's actual movies, but it's shocking that the two of them basically get trapped in the space between two portals in a show that's primarily aimed at families. It's admittedly clever, though (the only other time I've seen the \"two portals going at once trap a villain in the void between them\" was Transformers Prime) and shows that Knuckles learned from their trick at the end of episode 1.\n\nOnce the GUN agents are out of the way, Knuckles tells Wade to engage his father in \"trial by combat\"- that is, defeat him in the Tournament of Champions. While Knuckles's final battle within the show is yet to arrive, Wade's last challenge has. With his true colors on full display, Pete repeatedly puts down his estranged son (Girl Scout: \"Man, your dad's a real turd bucket, huh?\") throughout the game. Unfortunately for him, the Wade who he stands against now is not the same Wade who would be resigned to being called a loser at the start of the show.\n\nHe's been strengthened greatly by his ordeals over the last few days and Knuckles's mentoring, and he stands up to his deadbeat father, citing all the positive influences he had in his life aside from his dad. For as much as he wanted to believe that his father was as good as he remembers him being, Pete has proven to be anything but. As a result, Wade comes to recognize the value of all the other people he DID have to support him as he grew up and in the present.\n\nOh, and he pulls off a perfect game to add insult to injury, defeating his father at the very sport he put so much of himself into. It's a very solid end to Wade's character arc that the show had built up as the show went on, with him having matured greatly and overcome his greatest challenges. He is now the warrior that Pachacamac ordained Knuckles to train and the warrior that Jack said he wasn't all the way back in episode 1... even if his preferred battlefield is the bowling alley.\n\nIn regards to Knuckles, he has his final battle with the Buyer, who's assembled a ramshackle mech built from leftover Eggman tech. This fight should be big and climactic, and for the most part, it succeeds in being that. However, the fight starts in an incredibly anticlimactic fashion due to the show's primary focus being on the bowling finals between Wade and Pete. Knuckles just... hears something from outside while watching the game from a bar and OH HEY THE BUYER'S HERE NOW GUESS IT'S FINAL BOSS TIME.\n\nIt doesn't help that the Buyer himself is a tragically underutilized villain (see my gripes with him only appearing in half the show), so what should have been a fight that was a long time coming feels unearned. The Buyer just shows up in a Rhino-from-The Amazing Spider-Man 2-looking giant robot (an apt comparison considering that both Rhino and the Buyer were wasted big time by their works of origin) and starts slamming Knuckles around. Admittedly, the mech is solidly designed (would've made a great tie-in LEGO set; hint hint the LEGO Group ) and is believable as something that he and his men slapped together using leftover Eggman tech.\n\nFurther dampening the show's climax is the fact that Knuckles vs the Buyer seems very disconnected from Wade and Pete's final showdown during the tournament. This is an issue that the second Sonic movie also suffered from, although I'd say Knuckles does a better job weaving the Sonic content and human content together than the second film awkwardly trying to segue from Sonic and Tails having a near miss with Eggman and Knuckles to Rachel discovering that her wedding is a government cover-up. It could've been fixed by switching between the two climaxes through snappy editing, but again, I'm not the one in the show's editing room.\n\nOnce the Buyer's mech interrupts Wade's victory over his father, the show's climax picks up steam and gets great. The Buyer sucks Knuckles's Chaos energy dry and throws him out of the fight, leaving all that stands in his way to be Wade. After using a combination of pilfered quill-charged gauntlets and bowling balls to hold the Buyer back, Wade's words of encouragement reach Knuckles and give him the willpower he needs to stand up to the Buyer, reclaim his power, and defeat him.\n\nThe climax of \"What Happens in Reno...\" feels like a direct parallel to the first Sonic movie's climax, complete with the human lead's words jolting our unconscious CGI critter lead back to consciousness. However, I'd argue this did it better than the first movie because it reflects Knuckles's character journey better than Tom's \"He's my friend\" did for Sonic's growth over the course of movie 1. Knuckles has come to recognize the value of his friends, family, and home over the course of the last six episodes, and he'll do anything to defend it- something that Wade reminds him of.\n\nWhat follows is about a minute's worth of Knuckles taking back his powers and using the Flames of Disaster (signified with amusingly 80s text announcing its presence) to destroy the Buyer's mech, crushing him with a luminous globe from atop a nearby casino. It's a slick sequence and one that I think makes the last few episodes' lack of Knuckles understandable; the show's budget only had so much money and ergo the production staff worked around it so that the final battle could be as nice-looking as it needed to be. My only critique is that this went by so quickly that I barely had any time to process it.\n\nAlso, the Buyer's fate is left ambiguous, but considering what fell on him... yeah, him big dead. It's so strange to me that this show basically killed off all three of its major antagonists while the movies have been super cagey about doing the same to any major character. You'd think they'd want to keep the Buyer around for future movieverse media, but they went and offed him before we could get more out of him.\n\nI frankly think it would've been interesting to have the Buyer survive Knuckles... but only barely, resulting in someone like Eggman or Stone transferring his brain into a robot. Which robot, you ask? Well, dear reader, he'd become the mind behind E-123 \"Omega\", a heavily armed unit first introduced in 2003's Sonic Heroes. Omega is a fan favorite character, a comedically bloodthirsty rebellious robo bent on proving himself to be Eggman's strongest creation.\n\nWith how much fun Rory McCann seems to be having as the Buyer (especially in this episode) and with how solid of a voice actor he can be (while I haven't seen it, I've seen clips of his performance as Megatron in Transformers: EarthSpark), I think he'd make a perfect fit for movieverse Omega's voice. Heck, we could go a step further and have him do motion-capture work for the big lug since he's quite the large fellow in real life. It seems like such a big brain move and I'm surprised that the show didn't think to do something like that.\n\nThe last real plot beat of the show is that of Pete trying to steal the Tournament of Champions trophy in an act of cartoonish pettiness before getting punched out by Wendy (\"Take your hands off my son's trophy, you schmuck!\"). It's an immensely cathartic moment after how much of a waste of carbon he's been over the last two episodes. However, I feel like the moment would've worked just as well had Knuckles been the one to knock out Pete, especially considering how much the show had been building up his disgust towards the man for ditching his family all those years ago in its first half.\n\nAnd with a delightfully corny freeze-frame on Knuckles and Wade about to high-five, Knuckles comes to a close (well, aside from a mid-credits scene of Knux discovering \"The Warrior\" and declaring it to be his \"jam\", paying off a bit from the third episode). \"What Happens in Reno Stays in Reno\" is a strangely fitting end to the series because it embodies so much that worked and didn't work about it. Yes, there's not nearly enough focus on the series's title character and there are some pacing problems, but there's nothing offensive about any of the actors' performances and there's a lot to like about it. Both Wade and Knuckles leave the show as better-developed characters... and frankly, that's the thing that the show needed to do.\n\nCONCLUSION: Is There Anything to \"Live and Learn\" From for Future Sonic Movieverse Shows?\n\nOverall, my ranking of Knuckles goes like this.\n\n\"The Warrior\": Couldn't have asked for a better first episode... then again, due to the guiding hand of Jeff Fowler carrying over from the movies to this episode, it's the episode closest to the films in tone. (9/10)\n\n\"Don't Ever Say I Wasn't There For You\": Solid expansion upon Wade's character that shows the ways in which he and Knuckles are more alike than they think and the best showcase for Willoughby and Mason. (8/10)\n\n\"The Shabbat Dinner\": Perhaps the best balance between Knuckles's development and Wade's development bolstered by the introduction of Wanda and Wendy, but dragged down by its painfully generic antagonists. (8/10)\n\n\"What Happens in Reno Stays in Reno\": Suffers from the back half's heavy deemphasis on Knuckles himself, but resolves both Knuckles and Wade's character arcs well and deals with its antagonists decently. (7/10)\n\n\"The Flames of Disaster\": While it's lacking in Knuckles himself and leans a bit too hard into its sillier side in places, it's perhaps one of the most creative ways to work around the show's low CGI budget and an episode so delightfully bonkers that it just HAS to be seen to be believed. (6/10)\n\n\"Reno, Baby\": This episode is why some deride Knuckles as \"The Wade Show\". (4/10)\n\nAs a whole, Knuckles is a very 7/10 kind of show. It's nothing groundbreaking nor is it peak streaming, but it's competently made and there's much more good in the complete package than bad. Doesn't hurt that it's a self-contained story in an age where the two big superhero franchises are cranking out middling show after middling show that may or may not be prerequisites for the next big movie, turning the process of watching things into a homework-like slog rather than simple entertainment.\n\nIt's definitely not perfect, but it's quite nice for the first TV series within the Sonic Movie Universe (SMU). However, going forward, there's a few things I'd like to see be implemented. First off, there needs to be a better Sonic character/human character balance. While the human content of Knuckles was mostly solid, I sympathize with the many fans who wanted more of Knuckles himself. However, that decision hinges on Paramount+ giving the show enough money to handle having CGI critters and robots running around for more than 42% of its runtime.\n\nSecond, if the show's content is too expensive to do as a live-action/animation hybrid like the movies, make it fully animated. Granted, Paramount hasn't been terribly kind to its Paramount+-exclusive animated series, but between the Sonic franchise's history with animated series (which Paramount+ has the first three of... yes, even you, Sonic Underground) and how much Paramount has invested in the movieverse, I'm surprised this wasn't their goal from the start. Call up WildBrain (owner of the first three DiC Sonic toons and animation studio for the middling multiversal misfire Sonic Prime) and have them start working on streaming-original miniseries as soon as possible.\n\nHere's some ideas for potential Paramount+ SMU shows that could be animated:\n\nShadow the Hedgehog: Agent of GUN: If the third movie does well (and I'm confident it will), this one is practically a given. Assuming that movie 3 ends with Shadow on decent but not great terms with our heroes, this could act as a direct expansion of his storyline from the film just as Knuckles was for Knuckles's arc started by movie 2. This could adapt Shadow's moral aimlessness from Sonic Heroes and his own game, also introducing the movieverse versions of Rouge the Bat (ideally voiced by Karen Gillan) and E-123 Omega (even if he's not the Buyer's brain shoved in a robot, I still think Rory McCann should voice him in the movieverse) so we can have a movieverse version of Team Dark before movie 4.\n\nThe Great Chaotix Caper: A Sonic Movie Universe Series: Admit it, Paramount executives- you WANT to cast Pete Davidson as Vector the Crocodile. In all seriousness, I think the Chaotix (Vector the Crocodile, Espio the Chamelon and Charmy Bee) would make great additions to the movieverse. Similarly to how Knuckles fleshed out Wade and gave him an extended cast, I could see the Chaotix being used to flesh out Rachel, her husband Randal, and their daughter Jojo. Just make it a silly whodunit about the Chaotix trying to solve a mystery and protect Rachel's family... with hilarious results. Think Get Smart x The Pink Panther with a Sonic twist.\n\nUntitled Sonic Riders-inspired series: Based on the hoverboarding racing game spin-off series of the same name, this would involve Sonic, Tails and Knuckles racing around the world against a group of avian thieves calling themselves the Babylon Rogues to find a lost treasure. Admittedly, this one's only there to sell toys of the movieverse cast with hoverboards and to appeal to long-time fans who loved the Riders games, but I think it'd be a great way to keep Sonic, Tails and Knuckles in action without Jim Carrey-as-Eggman as the big bad. Also, I just think Jet, Wave and Storm would be fun additions to the movieverse because they'd make great rivals to the main trio.\n\nLastly, do what Knuckles did and try to make the series as unneeded for enjoyment of future movies as possible. Aside from several poor creative choices that have hindered their success this decade, Marvel Studios shot itself in the foot by making many of its Disney+ shows required viewing to understand the newest movie. You'd think that things like introducing new Avengers candidates or new big villains would be reserved for movies, but no- the audience is forced to suffer through shows they might not end up enjoying just so they can understand what's going on in Ant-Man 3.\n\nConversely, Knuckles kept itself mostly detached from the story that presumably will be told in the third Sonic film, with only some bits of lore regarding GUN's history being something you need to watch the show for. It's just an optional diversion for super-fans that helps turn a minor character from the films into a surprisingly solid leading man, even if he ends up overshadowing the show's title character. That's how these streaming shows connected to big franchises should be, really- big enough to be worth watching but small enough to not be required viewing before a big tentpole picture.\n\nIf Paramount does those three things (and considers the cinematic potential of the larger Sonic cast), then the SMU is going to last for a very long time- potentially longer than the other cinematic universes that it began during the reign of. And it'll all be thanks to Knuckles: a show that, while neither necessary nor perfect, was a worthy addition to the movieverse canon. Thanks for reading, everyone. God bless!"
