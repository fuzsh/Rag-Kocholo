Sega don't seem to like money.\n\nI for one would LOVE an Atari 50 type package.\n\n6\n\nBratwurst35\n\nI bet the announcement is finally handing off Sonic to a better company.\n\n7\n\nBoiAster\n\nJET SET RADIOOOOOOOOOO\n\n8\n\nLiam_Doolan\n\n@IceClimbersMain I've added this to the story.\n\n9\n\nDebbiee\n\nMost likely Sonic Generations 2, another Sonic and Sega All Stars Racing game or a Switch port of Sonic Dream Team since a lot of fans are complaining about it not being on video game consoles. They already announced Sonic Frontiers 2 but I would like to see new games of Alex Kidd, Wonder Boy, Dynamite Dux or Ecco the Dolphin (3D). Alex Kidd and Wonder Boy never got the 3D treatment like so many other franchises did.\n\nWith the right creators and writers a 3D open world Wonder Boy game similar to Breath of the Wild could be fun but make it like The Dragon's Trap and The Cursed Kingdom where you can transform into different creatures with different abilities.\n\n10\n\nepicgamner\n\n@Debbiee dude generations 2 would make me a very happy man\n\n11\n\nSnatcher\n\n@epicgamner Yeah I don’t want to get my hopes up or nothing but I would literally jump up and down with joy.\n\n12\n\nDebbiee\n\n@epicgamner I loved Sonic Generations too and being able to replay the levels from older Sonic games in 2D and 3D was fun and there were a lot of other levels that were left out I think would be good to include in a sequel.\n\nThey could also make it that we get to play as Tails, Knuckles, Amy, Shadow, Cream, Vector and other characters this time too.\n\n13\n\nRyu_Niiyama\n\nPlease new Virtua Fighter. Please SEGA.\n\n14\n\nTen-Zero\n\n@Debbiee Wait, when did they announce Frontiers 2?!\n\n15\n\nbluemujika\n\nSky Pirate Sonic the Yakuza Fighters Racing of Arcadia!\n\n16\n\nDebbiee\n\n@Moffo Around the time it was announced to be the biggest selling Sonic 3D game of all time. One of the main creators said they are planning on including more Sonic characters in it too that weren't in the first game and with the addition of Rouge and Cream being one of the most praised thing about Sonic Dream Team I could see them being included along with Shadow and possibly Charmy Bee, Blaze and Vector.\n\nHere are some of the articles about it.\n\nSega is already working on the next Sonic the Hedgehog game. Director Morio Kishimoto revealed as such on Twitter, and offered an interesting glimpse at Sega's plans for the future. Apparently, the next game in the series will put an emphasis on multiple playable characters, and Sega is looking to expand and refine the \"open zones\" that were introduced in Sonic Frontiers. Interestingly, Sonic Team wants to avoid overusing classic Sonic locations, such as Green Hill Zone, and Chemical Plant Zone.\n\nKishimoto's desire to add additional playable characters is not all that surprising. The director is a huge fan of the Sonic Adventure games, which put a big focus on Sonic's supporting cast. While Sonic Frontiers only lets players control the blue blur, a free DLC update for the game coming this year will add more playable characters. Despite this, Kishimoto wants to focus on making good single-player games, though multiplayer games are not totally off the table.\n\nThe combat in Sonic Frontiers took inspiration from the Sonic live-action films, and it seems Kishimoto wants to continue to add more depth to the combat. The director also wasn't quite happy with the way in which the story was handled in Frontiers, and wants to improve on that, while also giving players greater insights into the characters.\n\nAll in all, these comments are very interesting! Sonic Frontiers actually performed quite well for Sega, selling more than 2.5 million copies, and earned fairly strong reviews. Despite that success, it seems the company is still looking at what they can improve, and how they can make things more enjoyable for both longtime fans, and those just starting to play the games after seeing the Paramount movies. Five years passed between the release of Sonic Forces and Sonic Frontiers, so it will likely be some time before we get to see how things shake out!\n\nhttps://comicbook.com/gaming/news/sonic-frontiers-director-next-sonic-the-hedgehog-game-plans/\n\nSonic Frontiers Invicinibility\n\nSonic Frontiers has sold 3.5 million copies, making it the most successful 3D Sonic game of all time. This figure is enough to overtake the last figure we got for Sonic Heroes, which had reigned supreme on the charts for almost 20 years.\n\nhttps://comicbook.com/gaming/news/sonic-frontiers-director-next-sonic-the-hedgehog-game-plans/\n\nhttps://mynintendonews.com/2023/02/17/sega-sonic-frontiers-sequel-will-benefit-from-a-larger-budget-and-reiterates-developing-new-dlc/\n\n17\n\nUltimateOtaku91\n\nThere's only one series I want Sega to go back to and that's Valkyria Chronicles, but that won't happen.\n\nAlso this letter is being sent out to fighting game streamers it seems, so it's a safe bet a new Virtua Fighter is going to be announced.\n\n18\n\nRareFan\n\nHopefully nothing Sonic-related.\n\n19\n\nsikthvash\n\nDon't get your hopes up too much.... it's probably going to be a Sonic 3 movie teaser or a content update trailer for Like a Dragon Infinite Wealth\n\n20\n\nArcadianLegend99\n\nnew energy....as in....Moonstone energy?\n\nSkies of Arcadia HD let's goooooo!\n\n21\n\nGamingFan4Lyf\n\nSega is returning to the console market with a modular console that requires multiple adapters that all need separate power supplies to work.\n\nIt’s called Sega Master Console Neo CD 1024x RT 1.\n\n22\n\nGerald\n\nSega is bringing back the ‘Ages’ line. Available to download on announcement Sega Rally & Daytona\n\n23\n\nPMFan354\n\nIf it's Sonic, I hope it's another good game. I thought Sonic Frontiers was quite good, from most of the game, which is what I played so far. I was surprised but hopefully it's a sign Sega will make their games better quality. We'll see.\n\n24\n\nWaffleRaptor01\n\n@sikthvash Well it is Sega. What hope is there to have?\n\n25\n\nNatiaAdamo\n\nYou guys do remember that they bought Rovio just this year. Maybe an official crossover between Angry Birds and Sonic?\n\n26\n\nFX29\n\nSonic 06 Remastered edition here we go!\n\nIn all honesty I would love if they announced a new single player Phantasy Star game.\n\n27\n\nGreatluigi\n\n@FX29 please don’t get my hopes up. Seriously when will sega hire the creator of project 06?!\n\n28\n\nBaler\n\nRemoved - inappropriate; user is banned\n\n29\n\nBaler\n\nSega is the best\n\n30\n\nLevantine\n\nPlease another single player Phantasy Star Sega it'll never happen but I wish it would.\n\n31\n\nMSaturn\n\n@GamingFan4Lyf That would be a day 1 purchase for me! I know you’re joking but I’m not, lol.\n\n32\n\njohnedwin\n\nalways hoped they make a new phantasy star game or a phantasy star remaster collection..\n\n33\n\nOorWullie\n\nStill hoping for SEGA Arcade - 90's Classics and Outrun Coast 2 Coast 2.\n\n34\n\nRudeAnimat0r\n\nNo idea what to think, but I doubt it's a new Sonic since they won't want to divert attention from Superstars, which is underperforming so far.\n\nI won't get my hopes up. Sega is largely unpredictable, outside of Sonic and Like a Dragon sequels.\n\n35\n\nHammerGalladeBro\n\nIt will be a teaser of their so-called Super Game.\n\n36\n\nHandheldHaunter\n\nLow expectations people...\n\n37\n\nGrumblevolcano\n\nProbably the announcement of Sonic 2024, the franchise much like CoD is annual nowadays and SEGA gave a lot of the big reveals for Frontiers and Superstars to Geoff.\n\n38\n\nGoshJosh\n\n@HandheldHaunter Mine is so low you'll need a bulldozer.\n\n39\n\nLizuka\n\nEveryone wanting a new Virtua Fighter and I'm just like, \"Can we get Sonic Battle on NSO?\"\n\n40\n\nKillerTan98\n\nbloobs\n\nIn all honesty i wouldn't be surprised if it was a teaser for Sonic the Hedgehog 3.\n\n41\n\nBucky\n\nNew Snowboard Kids!\n\n42\n\nNeonsonic213\n\nIt's sonic movie 3, I just know it.\n\n43\n\nHandheldHaunter\n\n@GoshJosh heh. Mine are so low I'm living with the mole people.\n\n44\n\nEuler\n\nDreamcast mini console confirmed.\n\n45\n\nJamie64326\n\n@IceClimbersMain If anything it could be more news on Virtua Fighter 3tb Online for the west.\n\n46\n\nDeenroy\n\nPlease be Virtua Fighter 6!!!!\n\n47\n\nKnightrider1\n\nNot sure. My first thought was a new mini console, made Dreamcast.\n\nThen I thought could they release an updated Sega Game Gear? I don’t mean next gen, it would come installed with classic games, but just updated screen etc\n\n48\n\nFizza\n\nGiven how the letters seem to be specifically targeted at both SEGA and FGC content creators, I'd hazard a guess and say it's a new Virtua Fighter. SEGA's been digging into it's back catalog of franchises quite a bit lately, with series such as Samba de Amigo (and Jet Set Radio if potential leaks are anything to go by) getting new entries very recently, and when fighting games are more popular than they've ever been? Yeah I think it definitely makes sense for VF6 to potentially be this secret game.\n\n49\n\nEvenStephen7\n\nIt’s obviously fighting-related. And as great as a new Virtua Fighter would be, I’m going to hold out hope for the return of Eternal Champions or Fighters Megamix.\n\n50\n\nRubyCarbuncle\n\nKeeping my expectations in check this time. I know how I felt when Sonic Dream Team was announced despite being able to play it.\n\n51\n\nshonenjump86\n\nVirtua Fighter 6, come on.\n\n52\n\nFake-news\n\nModel 1, 2 and 3 collection 🙏\n\n53\n\nDuffman92\n\nWhen you got nothing original going for you you just open your sweater.\n\n54\n\nMaulbert\n\nSega's announcements are never as big as they're hyped up to be. Prepare to be underwhelmed.\n\n55\n\nCielloArc\n\nSonic 3 Movie Trailer and a new VF announcement probably.\n\n56\n\nrainbowtick\n\nEcco the Dolphin 4!! With Ed Annunziata and Spencer Nielsen! ( I wish I wish I wish)\n\n57\n\narekdougy\n\nKnowing Sega, get ready for something not exciting lol. and I love Sega.\n\n58\n\nAtlanteanMan\n\nGiven Sega's history over the past two decades, it'll be anything except what (non-Sonic or Yakuza) fans have been begging for.\n\n59\n\nAtlanteanMan\n\nWhat many of us would love to see:\n\n1) Arcade Coin-op Compilation\n\n2) New installment or remaster of one of Sega's classic RPG franchises (Shining Force, Skies of Arcadia, Phantasy Star, Dragon Force, Valkyria Chronicles)\n\n3) New Saturn or Dreamcast Mini Console\n\nWhat we'll very probably get:\n\n1) Yet another Sonic announcement\n\n2) Yet another Yakuza announcement\n\n60\n\nMirrorFate2\n\nThis won't be Sonic-related. Too soon for that.\n\n61\n\nAnti-Matter\n\nMaiMai for Nintendo Switch?\n\n62\n\nBrady1138\n\nDon’t they alway tease a bold new direction for Sega before releasing another rushed half-baked Sonic game?\n\n63\n\nawp69\n\nWhat did she say? I got a bit distracted…\n\n64\n\ndaveMcFlave\n\nNew Fantasy Zone entry, Phantasy Star Remake (the original, not online), Ristar 2, Streets of Rage 5....a new Shining Force (not that recent crap, but a Camelot-style one in the vein of the first three).\n\nIt's probably a decent Sonic game or another mobile game. I'm just being an unrealistic dreamer to the core. It's fun sometimes.\n\n65\n\nCoalescence\n\nAll Sega knows how to do anymore is set us up to let us down in mediocrity so I don't expect much.\n\n66\n\nsiavm\n\nI hope it is a game from a series that is not sonic or yakuza or a game from atlus. I want to play something from the past reimagined today. But it is a good chance it is another sonic game that is still not the one that brings him back to the glory days some of us had with him in the 90s.\n\n67\n\nRappinRootbeer\n\nShenmue 4 confirmed\n\n68\n\nGitface\n\nIf it isn’t a new Shining Force, don’t waste my time, Sega. 😉\n\n69\n\nGamingFan4Lyf\n\n@MSaturn I'd love for Sega to come back to the console market - especially if it's both a Legacy game machine all the way through Dreamcast and a current-gen machine.\n\n70\n\nNymbosox\n\nDreams big...Vectorman collection lol\n\n71\n\nNerdyBoutKirby\n\nThey’re finally going to announce an open-world Billy Hatcher game! It had better retain the “lose your egg when jumping to higher ledges” mechanic from the first game—y’know, for authenticity.\n\n72\n\nDpullam\n\nRegardless of what it may be, I always enjoy hearing about new things from Sega. I enjoy the company's vibe as a whole, and even though I do not play all of the franchises they have under their belt, I do appreciate what they bring to the gaming industry.\n\n73\n\nfpcreator2000\n\ni’d be happier Sega revisiting some older ips or a brand new ip\n\n74\n\nModdedInkling\n\nEither we're seeing a dormant Sega franchise make a return (I'm banking on Virtua Fighter), or it's just an excuse to tease Persona 6.\n\n75\n\nNintendoBMA\n\nWould love if Sega can release a Virtua Fighter collection. Or put out a few of these games under Sega Ages on Nintendo Switch.\n\nJust guessing what this “super game” might be. They are probably developing a major Super Smash Bros style game, using all their Sega IP characters. Using all sorts of stuff across every series imaginable. With game music remixes and everything.\n\n76\n\nDankPeezy\n\nLet's hope we see the rumored Comix Zone remake soon.\n\n77\n\nVoidofLight\n\nIf only this were Persona 6..\n\n78\n\nVoidofLight\n\n@NintendoBMA They've made comments that their super game is going to be a game that everyone around the world will be able to play. So it probably won't be anything like a fighting game. Most likely, it'll be a game available on every device that ends up trying to aim at doing everything at once, only to fall flat on its face and fizzle out into the ether.\n\n79\n\nGrailUK\n\nThe font screams Virtua Fighter to me. Buuuut, it's SEGA. So I will expect some kind of online esports twitch gaas to avoid disappointment. Surely it's far too early to reveal their vision for that mega game thingy they are developing.\n\n80\n\nAndee\n\nA tease of an announcement? Colour me cautious. I just hope it's not Sonic NFTs or something equally as inane...\n\n81\n\nSamalik\n\nIf maximilan dood is involved, it's either a new virtua fighter/one of it's many sister series, or Sonic's finally getting a more mainstream fighting game\n\n82\n\nJaceofbass64\n\nTheres is a small hope in me that we will get Sonic the Comic the game.\n\n83\n\nKayFiOS\n\nSo you're saying there's a chance for Skies of Arcadia?\n\n84\n\nPikaPhantom\n\nThat is one STACKED announcement. Even if a few of these are part of Sega's super game lineup, as has been rumored\n\n85\n\nimadeanaccount\n\nSega is based.\n\n86\n\nSerpenterror\n\nSo are these remakes or actual new games cause we already got a Streets of Rage 4, are we getting Streets of Rage 5 that soon? I would love to see a new sequel to Panzer Dragoon Saga or Orta and maybe a new Astal or NiGHTS or Skies of Arcadia.\n\n87\n\nFishyS\n\nThey had us all hyped, but the games in that trailer didn't seem very exciting. Although it went by so fast — maybe there was a good game hidden somewhere in that three seconds per game?\n\n88\n\nFizza\n\nSTREETS OF RAGE 5 WHAT THE F*** WHAT THE F*** WHAT THE F***\n\nThis is the announcement of the entire show for me, literally nothing is going to top the absolute insanity that is this.\n\n89\n\nZaruboggan\n\nCrazy Taxi, Golden Axe, and Jet Set! Looking forward to when they're properly announced lol\n\n90\n\nAde117\n\nSega just dropped the biggest bombshell of The Game Awards.\n\n91\n\nRareFan\n\nAre these all remakes or sequels?\n\n92\n\nFishyS\n\n@Fizza I'll have to trust you - the way they chose to mash up a bunch of games in a few seconds pretty much turned off my brain and I got nothing out of that trailer. I wish they had done them one by one so I knew what the heck I was looking at.\n\n93\n\nGreatluigi\n\nWHAT?!?\n\nI think sega just won the show with those announcements. I haven’t played any of the games they showed off but I would like to.\n\n94\n\nRyu_Niiyama\n\nI’ve never been so unhappy about good news before in my life. Welp I will go play a few rounds of Final Showdown to make myself feel better. VFDC community is taking antidepressants right now.\n\nEdit: Granted it says and more so my hopes have not been extinguished entirely.\n\n95\n\ndkc_fan\n\nAs soon as I saw the words “Crazy Taxi”, my brain jumped out of my head\n\n96\n\nandyg1412\n\nDaytona and Sega Rally would like a word...\n\n97\n\nKanbei\n\nAwesome announcements, but I'd trade them all for Virtua Fighter 6.\n\n98\n\nBored_Cosmic_Horror\n\nShinobi and Golden Axe were on my \"bring em' back wishlist\" so happy about that! nice one sega!\n\n99\n\nParaka\n\nI never thought, in a million-kajillion-made-upillion years, that SEGA would actually have me excited for once.\n\n&%$#-ing bravo.\n\n100\n\ntektite_captain\n\nI want to be excited, but no hint of a release timeframe or platforms? Why wouldn’t they at least announce the platforms? Unless one of the platforms is Switch 2 and they can’t yet…\n\n101\n\nN00BiSH\n\nEverything looks pretty good EXCEPT for Jet Set Radio. That art style is raising several red flags. On the opposite end of things the new Shinobi looked fantastic. I think Lizardcube is responsible for that one and that alone makes me excited.\n\n102\n\nSamalik\n\n@Serpenterror It appears to be a fighting game based off of Streets of Rage. Likely inspired by an old multiplayer mode or something\n\n103\n\nanoyonmus\n\nand none are coming to Switch\n\n104\n\nDr_Corndog\n\nI'm ready for Shinobi.\n\n105\n\nRainbowGazelle\n\nNew Streets of Rage! New Streets of Rage!! New Streets of Rage!!! Hell yeah!\n\n106\n\nWoomyNNYes\n\nI bet that Crazy Taxi is not coming to the switch.\n\n107\n\nshonenjump86\n\nWasn’t expecting that from Sega. That Shinobi 🥷 game looks pretty good. Will be interesting to see how these games turn out.\n\n108\n\njwfurness\n\nHoly moly! Would love to see a new Nights Into Dreams...\n\n109\n\nTeksetter\n\nYay! Something tantalizing from Sega beyond mini consoles! I’ll watch for more news next year on Shinobi, Golden Axe, and Crazy Taxi especially.\n\n110\n\nderickw69\n\nWow. That trailer gave me old school Sega vibes\n\n111\n\nAtlanteanMan\n\nIt's way past time we saw these franchises again from Sega; I just hope they're all handled competently. But still none of their iconic JRPG IPs (Shining Force, Skies of Arcadia, etc.) to be seen; hopefully they're A) included in the \"...and more\" description, and B) we won't have to wait ANOTHER two or three decades to play them.\n\n112\n\nPally356\n\nNGL, I am iffy about the look of SoR and Golden Axe. Crazy Taxi looked amazing, but im wondering whats going on with the cops. do you have to taxi people while avoiding the law?\n\nJet Set Radio looked really good...but I have to say the one I was the most excite dfor was Shinobi. That art style looked great.\n\nIm really hoping that 'and more' could have possibly meant that we get a new classic style Phantasy Star. Wishful thinking of course.\n\n113\n\nPurgatorium\n\nThis looks promising.\n\n114\n\nepicgamner\n\ni have to say, hats off to ya sega! glad to see you capitalizing more off the franchises you've got under your belt.\n\n115\n\nLikelySatan\n\nThis made TGA for me. I wasn't too stoked on much else, but THIS was wonderful.\n\n116\n\nrussell-marlow\n\nI really want to know who's making that Streets of Rage game.\n\nIt doesn't look like Dotemu is making it this time which has me concerned. It looks like it's in the style of those other Sega games shown off in this trailer which do look like mobile games and that's part of the reason I'm cautiously optimistic about this.\n\n117\n\nkalosn\n\nA \"new era\" for Sega.\n\nThis was definitely a bombshell, everything about this was simply overwhelming. The art styles, the gameplay, it's like a dream come true! (literally literally) I'm particularly interested in the new Jet Set Radio as well as the SoR4-like Shinobi game.\n\nAs for us Nintendo players, simply imagine Nintendo making a trailer like this one day, even if announcing 5 games at early development at once would go against their way. Like, if they went all out on announcements for the Switch 2...\n\n118\n\nRareFan\n\nThis is good news. SEGA needs to show the world, that they also can make other games besides Sonic.\n\n119\n\nRudyC3\n\nAbout Crazy Taxi...\n\nThe Offspring has been recording a new album... just saying !\n\n120\n\nMach_Rider\n\nNice to see some other franchises getting attention. Not sure how I feel about 3D Streets of Rage and Golden Axe, but that new Shinobi... wow, THAT can't come out soon enough!\n\n121\n\ndatamonkey\n\nWow this would be like Nintendo saying “new pilotwings, new wave race, new 1080” etc\n\n122\n\nMontyCircus\n\nAs an old person, I can say it was great fun seeing 5 game reveals in a row that I instantly recognized as versions of games from my youth.\n\n123\n\nBionicDodo\n\nBrilliant trailer. Hyped for every single one of these. Please get Yuzo Koshiro on board for Shinobi and SoR.\n\n124\n\nSummer235\n\nSuper excited for JSRF, I still listen to the soundtrack to this day. Although I recall an interview with the creator who said a new game wouldn’t happen because he’s much older now.\n\nSo I’m interested to see what’s up with it, hyped none the less.\n\n125\n\nSamalik\n\n@datamonkey new Custom Robo....\n\n126\n\nRainbowGazelle\n\nWho had Sega down to bring the highlight of the Game Awards?! Phenomenal stuff!! Shinobi looks great.\n\n127\n\nLord\n\nGreat stuff definitely a purchase!\n\nGolden axe looks awesome!\n\nBut I’ll take them all!\n\n128\n\nLikelySatan\n\n@BionicDodo This Dodo knows the score. Great avatar, btw. Shinobi 3 is legendary.\n\n129\n\nmiwa\n\nSuper excited about all of these.\n\nEspecially about a new Golden Axe entry, which is long overdue.\n\n130\n\nCupidStunt\n\nIt is about time Sega went back to its classic catalogue and revived them, but with the help of capable developers.\n\n131\n\nLiquidNinja\n\nA modern day version of Golden Axe would be awesome. Hand drawn like SoR 4 with added gore. I would get excited for that\n\n132\n\nSwooce\n\n@HandheldHaunter No, I'm going to be very hyped about a new Crazy Taxi and inevitably be disappointed and there's nothing you can do stop me!\n\n133\n\nCoolmusic\n\nThe best TGA 2023 highlight for me.\n\n134\n\nAxelay71\n\nAt last they are listening, new Golden axe looks very promising.\n\n135\n\nJohnnyMind\n\nThe biggest surprise for sure despite the teasing and what a pleasant one, wish the best for all these games and fingers crossed most if not all will come to Switch and/or Switch's successor, too!\n\n136\n\nKey19\n\n@Duffman92 And yet even when I do that, somehow people still aren't interested in me. 😭\n\n137\n\nSwooce\n\n@JohnnyMind SEGA usually puts their games on every platform possible so I'm confident that all of the games shown will come to the Switch.\n\n138\n\nJohnnyMind\n\n@TheImperfectInsider Good point so unless these are the exception to the rule (really hope that won't be the case) the question then is how many we'll see on Switch and how many on its successor... but of course Nintendo first has to announce the latter for any games to be confirmed for it!\n\n139\n\nPeteW\n\nCan't wait for these games.\n\nI wish someone would develop the technology for light gun games to work with modern tvs as I'd love to play the Virtua Cop games too.\n\n140\n\nOwenGamer22\n\n@Pally356 I agree. I’m most excited about what they’re gonna do with Jet Set Radio, but the Shinobi game looks the best in my opinion. I’m so excited about this!\n\n141\n\nVyacheslav333\n\nReal Sound: Kaze no Regret, NiGHTS!, and, Virtua Fighter Collection, please!\n\n142\n\nRykdrew\n\nPlease!!!\n\nNEW Virtua Fighter\n\nNEW Decap Attack/Psycho Fox !!!\n\n143\n\nDebbiee\n\nIt is good to see Sega is finally making more games outside of Sonic the Hedgehog again and I would love new Alex Kidd, Wonder Boy and Dynamite Dux games.\n\n144\n\nGrandiajet\n\nFinally a new Jet Set Radio 🥰\n\nCan we get a new Skies of Arcadia too please?\n\n145\n\nPinderSchloss\n\nReally excited for Shinobi because of Lizard Cube\n\n146\n\nLikelySatan\n\n@Vyacheslav333 I don't know what \"real sound\" means.\n\n147\n\nLikelySatan\n\n@Grandiajet you might like Vernal Edge. It's basically SoA but Treasure. Incredible game.\n\n148\n\nGrandiajet\n\n@LikelySatan Thanks for the tip 🙂\n\n149\n\nOctoCallie20\n\n\"And more\"\n\nMy copium prayer is the \"and more\" is referring to NiGHTS, A new NiGHTS game would most likely be exclusive to a Nintendo console so they could be waiting until Nintendo officially reveals the new switch to talk about it. I hope if we get a new NiGHTS its a full 3d game this time. They experimented with the idea when journey was early in development but apparently that didn't work well. Now that they're working with 200 times better hardware, they could potentially make something truly special. Just give me my NiGHTS goodness, Sega! That lovable \"purple flying jester\" (as my best friend hilariously puts it. 😂) needs another chance to flourish!\n\n150\n\nVyacheslav333\n\n@LikelySatan Real Sound: Kaze no Regret is a 1997 Japan-only audio game for Sega Saturn and Dreamcast. This game was designed by the famous Kenji Iino(Kenji Eno is his pseudonym). Iino wanted this game to be a Sega exclusive game (series). And, it still remains as a Sega exclusive, sadly. This game was intended to be a series (a trilogy, at least), but, next games were cancelled... Sad sigh\n\n151\n\nMoistnado\n\nIs that a 3D streets of rage? OMG. The Shinobi looks pretty cool too.\n\n152\n\nEdd-O\n\n@datamonkey 1080, Pilotwings and Wave Race plus Excitebike and F-Zero please Nintendo. A man can dream.\n\nThis was a MEGATON announcement from Sega for anyone round about 40 years old, who remembers all of these legendary franchises. And there's more to come! The mind boggles.\n\nBravo Sega, bravo.\n\n153\n\n-wc-\n\n@Edd-O\n\n\"1080, Pilotwings and Wave Race plus Excitebike and F-Zero\"\n\nYES! sometimes i feel like my fandom is of an alternate universe nintendo that never really existed. the dusty old carts ive clung to all these years are my only proof of the life i lived 😂 besides conversations like these! 😊 cheers.\n\nNothing sounds as good as,\n\n'I remember that!'\n\nLike a bolt out of the blue...\n\nDid you feel it too?\n\nI remember that.\n\n154\n\nLikelySatan\n\n@Vyacheslav333 interesting. I thought I was pretty up to speed on that stuff. Saturn imports especially were my jam for a while. It was mostly fighters and action games I was interested in though.\n\n155\n\nVyacheslav333\n\n@LikelySatan Oh. Understood.\n\n156\n\nMsMaestroon\n\nThis is exciting news! I hope we get a true Sega renaissance lead by designers with a big heart.for these franchises.\n\n157\n\nNinfan\n\nLooks great, some nice franchises\n\n158\n\nEmirParkreiner\n\nNice, i always wanted a 3d Streets of Rage that plays like Die Hard Arcade/Dynamite Cop, this could turn out great if it's done by the right developers.\n\nAlso, i'm really happy about the return of Jet Set Radio and Crazy Taxi.\n\n159\n\nMetalMan\n\nSega really sucks now.\n\n160\n\nSambuc\n\nI would really rather have a new Sega console..\n\n161\n\nWindy\n\nPhantasy Star online or PSO2 in North America on switch would be nice. A new phantasy star or proper Shining force would be cool. HD phantasy Star Blue Burst on switch would be sweet\n\n162\n\nPally356\n\n@Windy As nice as an HD PSOBB would be, it would be highly unlikely cause it would mean they would have to set up new servers and things. THough, I think that PSO2 would be able to run on Switch. That is a game that I definitely need to sink more time into.\n\n163\n\nWindy\n\n@Pally356 yeah I know it will not happen. I do prefer it over PSO2. PSO2 does run on switch its out on Switch in Japan. They haven't brought it to north America and probably won't now. I do play on PS4 but I can't get into it. I have about 40 hours into it it just doesn't have a good feel. I even prefer Phantasy Star Zero from DS"
