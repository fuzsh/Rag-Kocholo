In contrast to DiRT - the other flagship franchise of the British developer, GRID: Autosport continues the tradition established by the TOCA Touring Car Championship and TOCA Race Driver series, that is, racing on asphalt tracks. The player assumes the role of a professional driver who competes against other racers, but he also has to care about his team members and stick to sponsorship contracts.\n\nPCSwitchX360PS3ANDiOS\n\nRACE 07\n\nRacing 27 September 2007\n\nRACE '07: The WTCC Game is an official continuation of the 2006 edition of RACE: The WTCC Game.
