        "text": "Industry Partners\n\nWe are very interested in creating industry partners that can help the students in our pathway to thrive. We have created some key partnerships for field trips, internships, job shadows, and guest speakers. If your company would like to contribute to experiences such as this, please complete this survey.\n\nIf you or your Organization is involved with Programming and/or Video Game Design/Development and you are interested in becoming an Advisory Committee Member, please click this link to learn more about our program. We would love to partner with you and learn from your expertise!\n\nIn our first years, we have already partnered with several businesses including:\n\nThis schedule is a sample of what SEGA students will take based on pathway requirements and high school graduation/A-G requirements.\n\nAll students at Millikan take A-G courses and have the option to take any AP Classes offered. We encourage SEGA students to take AP Classes in subjects that they enjoy and are strong in, as we know these are probably the areas they will pursue further in college.\n\nWork-Based Learning\n\nWhile using Video Games as a way to teach them these principles, we also examine how computer science is used in most other professions. We will assist students in exploring other career options, through college, other training or how to get a job right out of high school.\n\n9th Grade Students will have a complete presentation with their Game Design Document and some will have completed a Prototype of their game using Construct3 (a 2D Game Development Platform). End results will be shared at the Game Showcase.\n\n-A Career Research Action Plan will be revised each year based on the students’ interests.\n\nIn 11th Grade, after learning the programming language of C#, students will use their 9th Grade Game Design Document to develop their game in Unity or Construct3. This prototype will be displayed at the Game Showcase.\n\n12th Grade (Capstone Course)\n\nSEGA Capstone - Individual Project with a focus on technology and Professional Interaction.\n\nSEGA Capstone - Group Project - Working with a community partner to create a game or application that benefits their clientele.\n\nAll Students also complete a professional e-Portfolio of their high school work throughout the 4 years.\n\nIn this capstone course, students will work with a team to create a new game as well as an individual project. This game could be created using any gaming platform that works at school. Students partnered with and got feedback from Long Beach Women Shelter to create a game or application based on their curriculum for their “Building Healthy Relationships” program, which was unveiled at their Children’s Summit. Students will present their work at the Game Showcase. Examples of this project and examples of prior projects can be found on the Millikan SEGA Website."
