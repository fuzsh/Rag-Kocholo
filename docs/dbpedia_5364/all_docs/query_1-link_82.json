        "text": "GMC, an American car maker, will announce the electric vehicle version of the Hummer EV on October 20, 2020. It was revealed that the in-vehicle software installed in this Hummer EV was built using the game engine Unreal Engine of Epic Games, the developer of the popular battle royale game ' Fort Knight '.\n\nHuman Machine Interface-Unreal Engine\n\nhttps://www.unrealengine.com/ja/industry/hmi\n\nGMC Hummer EV will be the first car carrying software built with Epic's Unreal Engine --The Verge\n\nhttps://www.theverge.com/2020/10/7/21506572/epic-games-unreal-engine-general-motors-gmc-hummer-ev-human-machine-interface\n\nEpic Games has partnered with several automakers, including General Motors (GM), to drive the development of in-vehicle software ' Human Machine Interface (HMI) ' based on its game development platform Unreal Engine. .. The first car to feature an HMI based on Unreal Engine will be the Hummer EV, which GMC will soon announce.\n\nWhat HMI development based on Unreal Engine will look like is explained in the following movie.\n\nUnreal Engine HMI Initiative | Automotive --YouTube\n\nThe Unreal Engine logo is projected on the monitor next to the steering wheel ...\n\nI got something like the HMI home screen. What you see is the car's current location and temperature, and some menu buttons.\n\nYou can change the body and color of the car CG displayed on the home screen at any time.\n\nYou can also display detailed information about the car body in real time.\n\nUnreal Engine uses a designer-friendly ' Blueprint Visual Scripting System ' that allows app and UI / UX developers to quickly prototype interactive content without touching the codeline. It will be.\n\nInstantly preview your design on your desktop ...\n\nYou can also access the source code directly. With these features and more new features, Epic Games explains, 'We will provide an environment where designers, artists, and developers can easily develop applications and UIs for vehicles.'\n\nUnreal Engine is a comprehensive toolset for creating beautiful and interactive visuals, using an advanced and scalable renderer. With the Niagara Particle System, you can create sophisticated VFX in real time to movie-level quality.\n\nIt is also possible to change the UI by providing download contents. In the image below, the CG of the vehicle displayed on the HMI has been changed to a\n\nRocket League vehicle.\n\nIn addition to using Unreal Engine as a Linux and Android library, he is also working on integrating Unreal Engine with\n\nBlackBerry QNX 's Neutrino real-time operating system .\n\nIn addition, the integration with\n\nMapbox , a real-time location platform, will enable us to provide a superior navigation system."
