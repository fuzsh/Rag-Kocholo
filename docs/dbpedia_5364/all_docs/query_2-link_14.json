        "text": "Bootleg video game developer\n\nHummer Team[1] (Chinese: 悍馬小組) was a Taiwanese developer of bootleg video games which was founded in 1992 and closed down in 2010.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nHummer Team was founded in Taipei, Taiwan in 1992 by Hummer Cheng, who had previously worked at Sachen.[2] It was originally dedicated to the development and publishing of unauthorized ports of video games for the Nintendo Famicom. The first video game published by Hummer Team was Jing Ke Xin Zhuan (1992), a role-playing video game. Upon the releases of Kart Fighter (1993) and Somari (1994), the company began to gain attention.\n\nIn the late 1990s and early 2000s, Hummer Team experienced economic troubles because it had difficulty developing for the fifth generation of video game consoles. This caused Hummer to begin making games for plug and play consoles, and working on things other than the Famicom.[2] Examples include the Samuri 60-in-1 and Z-Dog, the latter of which was released in 2006 by Zechess and was their final product. Most of their later plug-n-play consoles were based on OneBus \"VT03\" enhanced NES clone hardware by the Taiwanese company V.R. Technology.[3]\n\nRecognition (1992–2006)\n\n[edit]\n\nHummer Team's first game,[4] Jing Ke Xin Zhuan, was released in 1992. The company was known in Argentina by its publisher, Yoko Soft, after the release of Street Fighter: The World Warrior in 1993. Some of Hummer Team's better known games include Street Fighter II: The World Warrior, an unlicensed port of Street Fighter II, Kart Fighter, a Street Fighter clone infamously using characters from the Super Mario Bros. series, and Somari, a port of the original Sonic the Hedgehog game to the Famicom, featuring Mario instead of Sonic. Somari in particular gained a bit of notoriety, having been made fun of by many content creators and video game journalists for its poor physics, modified object placement and replacement of Sonic as the main character.\n\nGames\n\n[edit]\n\nGame Chinese Name Note Published Jing Ke Xin Zhuan 荊軻新傳 Chinese language RPG.
