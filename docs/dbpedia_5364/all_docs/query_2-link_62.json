        "text": "I've been messing with a Riva 128 card lately and reading about its various shortcomings and secret design compromises that make it render in its special fugly way. Intrigue such as the seemingly fake per-pixel mip mapping box in the driver control panel....\n\nI stumbled upon a giant Real3D interview from the ancient times. I figured Megadrive1988 and others would probably enjoy it. A lot of interesting stuff. Sega, i740, competitors and more.\n\nHardcore Gaming Exclusive Interview with Real 3D\n\nPart I\n\nThe folks at Real3D were kind enough to take some time to answer a few\n\nquestions for us. First I would like to thank Shog for helping out\n\nwith some of the questions. While we couldn't get them to talk about\n\nModel4, they were very open and willing to talk about Starfighter,\n\n3DFX, Power VR and the state of 3D. So enough with the yapping from me\n\nhere is part one of our 1 on 1 with Real3D\n\nHGN: Given the nature of your relationship with Sega, we'd like to\n\nknow if Real3D was ever approached to work on Sega's next home system?\n\nIf so what happened? If not, than why do you think you weren't asked,\n\nespecially considering the work that you've done with their arcade\n\nboards.\n\nReal3D: We had some preliminary discussions with Sega regarding the\n\nhome console market, but both companies agreed the business model for\n\nthe console market didn't create a win-win situation like we have in\n\nthe arcade market. The two markets are very different and the\n\ncompanies decided not to pursue any developments in the console market\n\nspace.\n\nHGN: Right now it seems like the 3D card race is getting very crowded.\n\nWhy is it that none of the card makers have made any real attempt at\n\nthe business model? You know using the cards for presentations and\n\nsuch. They all seem aimed at the same market (games) and the one how\n\ncould make a serious dent in the corporate side of this would have a\n\nbig advantage.\n\nReal3D: The simple truth is that business productivity software that\n\ntakes advantage of the 3D hardware capabilities is just not available\n\nyet. However, we see this changing over the next six to eighteen\n\nmonths. Real 3D certainly wants to see the corporate market start\n\ndemanding 3D graphics hardware. We are starting to see some potential\n\nin applications such as Viewpoint's LiveArt, which is 3D clipart that\n\ncan be inserted in presentations. Real 3D has established our\n\nRealPartners developer program, which is a program that gets software\n\ndevelopers early specifications and releases of our hardware. This\n\nway, the software developers can develop 3D content that takes\n\nadvantage of the 3D hardware capabilities and helps make 3D in general\n\nmore widespread.\n\nHGN: I'd like to talk about the competition a bit. What would you say\n\nare the strengths and weaknesses of the following chipsets: Voodoo 2,\n\nPVRSG, and Riva 128? How would you rank the Starfighter against them?\n\nReal3D: The Voodoo2 chipset is certainly an impressive alternative for\n\nthe serious gamers out there. It seems to be well-matched for QuakeII\n\nand similar Quake-based games, beating the frame rates we get with the\n\nStarFighter and everyone else gets with the various chips/boards.\n\nPerformance under Glide-based games is also impressive. But when you\n\nturn to Direct3D game performance, the StarFighter/Intel740 is about\n\non-par with the Voodoo2. The image quality of the Voodoo2-based boards\n\nleaves little to be desired, and we believe the StarFighter definitely\n\nholds its own in the image quality match with the Voodoo2. But the\n\nhigher cost of the Voodoo2 boards , and the lack of an integrated 2D/\n\n3D solution, makes their board a lesser value to the average consumer\n\nand commercial user in our opinion.\n\nWe don't want to comment much on the PVRSG, having not seen it. The\n\npress it has gotten is certainly impressive. But we can remember being\n\nsimilarly impressed with their PR campaign on the PCX1 and PCX2, which\n\nturned out to be pretty unspectacular compared with modern parts.\n\nWe'll hold our judgment until we see the PVRSG in action.\n\nThe RIVA 128 is a fair piece of silicon; however, it comes with\n\nannoying compromises we never would have made. It has serious\n\nrendering flaws, as we're sure you've seen and heard descriptions of.\n\nPolygon cracks and Z-buffer poke-throughs point to design errors in\n\nthe silicon which simply can't be patched with drivers. We never would\n\nhave resorted to the \"texture mip-level per polygon\" simplification\n\nthey chose to implement, as we had been using per-pixel LOD\n\ndetermination for over 15 years in computer image generation solutions\n\nfor the military and Sega. The RIVA's rendering speed on Direct3D apps\n\nis no better than 10-15% better than StarFighter/Intel740, at best,\n\neven though they tout their 128-bit bus and 100 megapixel throughput.\n\nIn our estimation, if the average consumer can live with these\n\nrendering anomalies, the RIVA boards are reasonably priced.\n\nHowever, in our humble opinion, mainstream consumers do not have to\n\nsacrifice image quality for performance with the StarFighter. You get\n\nthe best combination of both performance and image quality with the\n\nStarFighter/Intel740. We have attempted (some say to a fault) to bring\n\nhigh fidelity, high performance graphics technology to the mainstream,\n\nand believe the StarFighter/Intel740 offers greater value to the\n\ninformed consumer.\n\nHGN: What is the biggest advantage to supporting D3D instead of coming\n\nup with custom API for the Starfighter? You know, something like\n\nGlide?\n\nReal3D: The biggest advantage to D3D and OpenGL are that they are\n\nstandard APIs that all hardware and software developers can relate to\n\nand develop for.Custom APIs are somewhat of a nightmare for software\n\ndevelopers because they are forced to incorporate many special\n\nfeatures in their code. From the hardware side, we want as many\n\napplications as possible to be able to take advantage of the\n\nStarFighter/Intel740. The best way to do this is to use standard APIs.\n\nAs you are aware, the industry is moving very quickly to standards. It\n\nused to be that software vendors could get 10-15% more out the\n\nhardware by writing to a custom API. Today, Microsoft has much more\n\ncompetitive code and the software resources that used to be applied to\n\nAPIs can now be applied to making the games better. For this reason,\n\nyou are seeing more and more software developers supporting the\n\nstandard APIs and de-emphasizing the custom APIs.\n\nGlide came out at a time when there were no graphics standards in the\n\ncommercial marketplace. Now that all new hardware and software coming\n\nout are supporting either D3D or OpenGL (or both), we think you'll\n\nfind that hardware-specific APIs such as Glide will become less\n\npervasive. This is not to say that D3D or OpenGL are better or worse\n\nat this point, but the cost and complexity in continued support for a\n\nhardware-specific API will be prohibitive.\n\nHGN: PowerVR has Z-buffer-less infinite planes, Voodoo has separate\n\npixel and texel chips, Riva has 128 bit wide data pipeline, What does\n\nR3D have in Starfighter/Intel740 that give it a competitive advantage\n\nover other 3D architectures? In another words, what is it's\n\ntechnological trump card? How do you exploit it?\n\nReal3D: In short, the trump card is \"AGP Done Right.\" There are many\n\nAGP cards on the market that are basically PCI cards running across\n\nthe AGP bus. These cards will take textures out of AGP memory and copy\n\nthem to local memory on the board in order to use them. Even with the\n\nbandwidth of the AGP bus, at some point there will be a bottleneck in\n\nthe size of the textures that can be accessed without slowing the\n\napplication down. This is why you will find that most cards only\n\nsupport texture maps up to 256x256 (or maybe slightly larger).\n\nThe StarFighter, on the other hand, has no local memory on the board\n\nfor texture storage. All textures are accessed directly out of AGP\n\nmemory on a texel by texel basis. When an application is running, the\n\ntexels that are needed to render the current frame are copied from AGP\n\nmemory directly to the on-chip cache to render the image. There is no\n\nwasted copying of the entire texture map. This allows the StarFighter\n\nto run with texture maps up to 1024x1024 with no performance hit. It\n\nalso allows the StarFighter to run with huge quantities of texture\n\n(i.e. 40MB or more).\n\nWhat's all this mean for the gamer? Game developers will be able to\n\nuse bigger textures and lots of them (and we're encouraging them to do\n\nso). This basically gives you more stunning and realistic visuals and\n\nan overall better gaming experience, with no performance degradation.\n\nWe've seen lots of companies claim \"arcade-like experience on the PC\",\n\nwhich we get a chuckle out of. Well, we know a little about both and a\n\ntrue AGP implementation like the StarFighter/Intel740 actually does\n\napproach an arcade-like experience.\n\nHGN: Starfighter/Auburn's raw polygon output performance and pixel\n\nfill-rate is about on par with the first generation Voodoo (Voodoo1)\n\nchip and is far below the output of the current generation of Voodoo\n\nchip (Voodoo2). Knowing that fact, is it safe to assume that the high\n\nend 3D accelerator market was not what R3D and Intel was going after\n\nwith Starfighter/Intel740? Then what market are you going after with\n\nStarfighter/Intel740?\n\nReal3D: The Intel740 was designed as a performance part for the volume\n\nmainstream PC market. The comparison to the Voodoo is somewhat of a\n\nmisleading comparison. The Voodoo boards are aimed at a narrow market\n\nand even 3Dfx acknowledges its Voodoo chip set is narrowly focused to\n\nmeet the avid gamer market. The Voodoo chip set from 3Dfx is an\n\nexcellent product and offers high performance, but it is a 3D only\n\nsolution that carries a premium price tag. The StarFighter board with\n\nthe Intel740 is a complete, integrated 2D/3D/video board aimed\n\nsquarely at the mainstream market. With the StarFighter, you do not\n\nneed any additional graphics accelerators for 2D or 3D in your system.\n\nThe StarFighter is ideal for a range of markets and users, including\n\ncorporate desktop configurations, small business desktop systems,\n\nsmall office/home office systems, computer game enthusiasts and entry-\n\nlevel workstation systems.\n\nHGN: What would you consider the optimum system to run the Starfighter\n\non? What would push it to its fullest potential? Given how spec crazy\n\neveryone is these days, will you have a chip that can compete with\n\nVoodoo2 and PVRSG in polygon output and pixel fill-rate in the near\n\nfuture?\n\nReal3D: 3D graphics performance is highly correlated to system\n\nperformance, for all graphics cards. To get the most out of the\n\nStarFighter, put it in the latest and greatest Pentium system you can.\n\nHow about the 700MHz Pentium Intel just demonstrated at CeBit in\n\nGermany? Since this is not an option for most of us, the StarFighter\n\nAGP will perform great in any AGP system. And for those without an AGP\n\nsystem, the StarFighter PCI will give you comparable performance in\n\nyour Pentium, Pentium PRO, or Pentium II system.\n\nWe can't give you any specifics about future developments, but let's\n\njust say we're not sitting still with the Intel740.\n\nHGN: How did it come about that you ended up working with Intel? What\n\nexactly is R3D's relationship with Intel regarding the Starfighter/\n\nIntel740 chipset? How much design influence did Intel have on the\n\nproject?\n\nReal3D: There are several factors that led Intel to partner with Real\n\n3D in developing the Intel740. First, Real 3D has a great deal of\n\nexperience in developing high performance, high fidelity image\n\ngeneration and 3D graphics technologies. We've done so for the\n\nmilitary and space program for over 30 years. Second, Real 3D has a\n\nvery successful relationship with Sega for developing arcade graphics\n\nchips and boards. Finally, Real 3D holds almost 40 patents related to\n\n3D graphics technology. All of these factors led Intel to the decision\n\nthat Real 3D would be the ideal partner in bringing very high-end 3D\n\ngraphics technology into the mainstream.\n\nThe development of the Intel740 was truly a team effort between Intel,\n\nReal 3D, and Chips & Technologies (who did the 2D core). Real 3D was\n\nresponsible for system level definition, hardware design, and 3-D\n\npipeline simulation. Real 3D assisted Intel with validation of the\n\nIntel740, which included system design of the 3-D pipeline and\n\ndevelopment of the test suites. Real 3D also led the development of\n\nall driver software for the chip.\n\nReal 3D's relationship with Intel was further cemented earlier this\n\nyear when Intel purchased a 20 percent equity interest in Real 3D\n\n(Lockheed Martin still owns the other 80 percent).\n\nPart II\n\nThanks for checking back in. This is the second part of HGN's 1 on 1\n\nwith Real3D. We just touched on a few things regarding Sega and\n\nVoodoo2 in this portion of the conversation.\n\nHGN: Starfighter and the Intel740 has already been acknowledged by\n\nmany as having very high quality textures in it's architecture. What\n\nis so special about the R3D architecture that allows this?\n\nR3D: First, StarFighter/Intel740 is AGP done right. With textures\n\nstored in system memory, there is virtually unlimited texture memory\n\nso what you see on the screen is what the author intended, not some\n\nscaled down MIP level. Second, using AGP for texturing frees up local\n\nmemory bandwidth for drawing. Our efficient chunking engine makes the\n\nmost effective use of memory and internal caches. Third, the\n\nhyperpipelined architecture includes algorithms from our military and\n\nSega work - algorithms that are tried and true. Combine these with\n\ngreat pixel accuracy and what you see is what a great image. Also, we\n\ndon't want to underestimate the inherent nature of our engineers to\n\npay strict attention to detail. Remember, our heritage is in\n\ndeveloping simulations that had to be incredibly realistic to meet\n\nmilitary specifications. Experience counts for a lot in many things\n\nand 3D graphics is no different.\n\nHGN: Ok I'm glad you touched on this because I wanted to ask about it.\n\nI'm talking about the scalability of hardware or software. What I mean\n\nis, is it the software's job \"to scale up\" to the hardware? Or is it\n\nthe hardware's job to scale up to the code of the software? Thats one\n\nof the reasons I asked about custom API's. I'll use Moto Racer as an\n\nexample. In the D3D version of the game the smoke is like a patch of\n\nwhite, while in the Power VR and 3DFX versions its more transparent.\n\nNot being a developer I would think that it was because of D3D. Then\n\nyou see a game like Incoming running D3D and you ask what gives? Why\n\nsuch a difference in the quality of the effects? Shouldn't the\n\nhardware ( if it can do the effects like transparent smoke) recognize\n\nthe code and \"scale up\" or if the software sees that the hardware can\n\ndo the effect properly, execute it better? Am I making any sense? I\n\nguess I'm asking where does the responsibility lie? Hardware,\n\nsoftware, or both? People come down hard on Power VR but I've seen it\n\ndo some really incredible graphics. Likewise I've seen some real bad\n\nstuff on 3DFX.\n\nR3D: The short answer is that it's both the hardware and software\n\nresponsibility to make up for the other ones deficiencies. The\n\nhardware itself does what it does and that's it. There is flexibility\n\nwithin the hardware drivers, but ultimately the driver just receives\n\nindividual polygons with no knowledge of the scene that they are a\n\npart of. The application on the other hand has complete knowledge of\n\nthe scene and also of the hardware it is running on (by checking the\n\ncapability (CAP) bits at startup).\n\nThe comparison of MotoRacer to Incoming is a good one. They both use\n\nD3D, but yet even on the same hardware the smoke in MotoRacer looks\n\nhorrible and the effects in Incoming look great. This is due to the\n\nquality of the art work in the texture maps and the game developers\n\nability to effectively use D3D. (or any API) For example, there are 15\n\ndifferent alpha blending modes in D3D. A good developer knows which\n\nmodes can best produce the desired effect. Then if the hardware can't\n\nsupport the selected mode the app should default to something the\n\nhardware can support. (at the expense of the image quality)\n\nSo to summarize: visual quality is mostly due to good texture design\n\nand effective use of D3D/OpenGL/etc. But of course the more features\n\nthe hardware supports the easier it is for the application to look\n\ngood. (this is why PowerVR often gets blasted. Lack of features, like\n\nmost of the alpha blend modes.\n\nHGN: I know the Starfighter supports D3D and OpenGL, but how long\n\nbefore we start seeing titles that are designed to exploit the i740\n\nchipset? Is that where RealPartners would come in? The differences in\n\nthe way D3D is used in games like Moto Racer and Incoming is drastic\n\nto say the least. How do you make Incoming the standard?\n\nR3D: Yes, RealPartners is exactly the answer. To exploit the i740, we\n\nencourage developers to support high screen resolutions, use high\n\nresolution texture maps, use lots of texture, etc. We also talk to\n\nthem about how they could most effectively take advantage of their\n\ntarget platform and D3D or OpenGL. For example, a lot of extra speed\n\ncan be obtained from the PII processor by keeping your data properly\n\naligned for the CPU's cache. And with AGP systems there is no longer a\n\nneed to use sub-maps for textures. And the list goes on.\n\nHGN: How exactly did LM go from doing simulators for the military to\n\nmaking arcade boards for Sega? What made you decide to go that route?\n\nR3D: In 1991 we started to look for commercial adjacent market\n\napplications of our Compu-Scene real-time 3D graphics technology.\n\nMarket surveys of various industries indicated a growing need for more\n\nrealistic video graphics in entertainment applications. This analysis\n\nled to the initial contact with Sega of Japan. Early discussions\n\nrevealed that Sega was about to embark on a two-year internal\n\ndevelopment effort to improve their polygon based arcade graphics\n\nhardware ( Model 1) with texture mapping so that video screens would\n\npresent images which were more realistic. By adapting our proven real-\n\ntime 3D graphics technology specifically for Sega's needs, we were\n\nable to get Sega to the market 14 months early.\n\nHGN: On the subject of Sega, how did you work with them on the Model X\n\nboards? Did they come in with ideas or specs that they wanted or did\n\nyou just show them your product? Also what can we expect from Model 4?\n\nR3D: Our relationship with Sega is very much a joint effort where both\n\ncompanies discuss ideas, market requirements, specifications --\n\nbasically everything that will go into producing the world's best\n\narcade games. Since the graphics chips and boards we do for Sega are\n\ncustom for Sega, we really couldn't just show them our \"product\",\n\nbecause it's not a product until the specs and requirements are set.\n\nWhen we first started with Sega, what we showed them was the\n\nsophisticated visual systems we had done for the military. Sega\n\nbelieved (and we believed) we could adapt that technology to the\n\narcade and if this could be done, the level and sophistication of\n\narcade graphics would take a quantum leap forward. Well, as you know,\n\nwe were able to adapt the technology, which resulted in Model 2 and\n\nlater Model 3. And Sega continues to enjoy a market leader position in\n\nthe arcade space.And you ask about Model 4. I know you and your\n\nreaders are probably anxious to know what's on the drawing board, but\n\nI really can't comment on Model 4 or future arcade development efforts\n\nwith Sega. Hope you understand.\n\nHGN: Is there any real advantage to adding an additional 3D card to\n\nrun with the Starfighter? I mean if you have a higher quality graphic\n\nto start with, would that take care of the short comings of the other\n\n3D cards? So if you were to take a Starfighter card and matched it\n\nwith something like the Voodoo 2, which from what I heard is just more\n\nof Voodoo 1, would it get you the best of both worlds or would they\n\ncancel each other out so to speak?\n\nR3D: The Voodoo 2 is pretty much just more of Voodoo 1. Basically it\n\nis a low-res 3D-only card that has the highest fill rate of anything\n\ncurrently on the market. What does this mean to the user? It means\n\nthat any application with a high depth complexity or that uses\n\nmultiple textures per polygon will still run fast. (i.e. Quake II) For\n\nall other applications the Voodoo 2 is comparable to StarFighter or\n\nother top-performing 2D/3D boards for raw performance. What you don't\n\nget with Voodoo 2, but do get with StarFighter is the ability to run\n\n2D, 3D up to 1280x1024, 3D in a window and video. You also only need\n\nto spend $200 for your complete graphics solution versus $250 for a\n\nVoodoo 2 plus a 2D card to go along with it. So, if you spend a lot of\n\ntime playing games like Quake II and cost is not much of a factor,\n\nthen you might consider a Voodoo 2 to go along side your StarFighter.\n\nHGN: On the subject of Voodoo2, do you see any real advantage to\n\nrunning two of those things at the same time? That seems to be a big\n\nsell point for the chipset. Is that something other companies would\n\nsee as a viable video solution?\n\nR3D: Having two Voodoo 2's gives you an even higher fill rate than\n\nhaving one. In an application like Quake II, where there are two\n\ntextures per polygon, each Voodoo 2 card would process one of the\n\ntextures simultaneously so that the scene can be rendered in one pass\n\ninstead of two. There aren't many applications (if any) on the market\n\nthat are pushing high enough fill rates to take advantage of this. All\n\nit does for Quake 2 is push the frame rate from 60+fps to 100+fps. To\n\nus, when you start exceeding 60fps, it's doubtful the user would be\n\nable to tell the difference and the cost for the two board combo is\n\naround $500.\n\nHGN: A while back the R3D/100 was announced as a consumer product, and\n\nthen we kind of never heard anything else about it. Whatever happened\n\nto that product? Is it related in anyway to the i740?\n\nR3D: The R3D/100 was a graphics chip designed for the high-end\n\nworkstation markets such as CAD and 3D modeling. This product was not\n\nreally related to the Intel740 because the i740 is targeted at the\n\nperformance mainstream PC market. As a company, Real 3D has decided to\n\nfocus its chip-design efforts in the mainstream PC market through our\n\nco-developments with Intel and our own designs (in addition to the\n\ncustom work we do for Sega). The primary business model for Real 3D is\n\nas a board company. We are still involved in selected business\n\nopportunities with the R3D/100, but it is not a product we are\n\nactively marketing any longer.\n\nHGN: Given that Intel is Intel how long do you think it will be before\n\nthe i740 starts showing up on Intel's motherboards? That would be a\n\nhuge advantage to Real3D in the \"3D wars\". How would you avoid all the\n\ncriticisms that S3 took by being on the motherboards?\n\nR3D: I really try to answer whatever questions are posed to me by\n\nreporters, but for this one, I need to defer to my colleagues at\n\nIntel. I hope you understand, but Intel's efforts in the graphics\n\nmarket has been and continues to be scrutinized by the Federal Trade\n\nCommission. For this reason, any decision to bring the i740 down onto\n\nmotherboards will be watched closely and I'd rather have Intel comment\n\non the prospect of this happening. As for the second part of your\n\nquestion, I'll speak for Real 3D from strictly a business perspective\n\nand that is we certainly have a vested interest in the widespread\n\nacceptance and sale of the i740 because of the royalty stream it\n\ngenerates for Real 3D. And I think if/when the i740 moves onto\n\nmotherboards, there will be other performance mainstream graphics\n\nchips offering much more so consumers will still have the choice of\n\nbasic graphics through the chip on the motherboard or better graphics\n\nthrough an add-in card.\n\nHGN: I think I recall hearing about a Model 2 game called \"Hummer\"\n\nbeing developed by Real3D. Can you give us a little information about\n\nthis title? Also is this an area that you are interested in getting\n\ninto more in the future?\n\nR3D: The Model 2 game you speak of called \"Hummer\" is actually called\n\n\"Behind Enemy Lines\". This is a title developed by Real 3D -- not only\n\nthe hardware (which is in all Model 2 and Model 3 games), but also the\n\nsoftware. It is the second game we have developed for Sega (Desert\n\nTank was the other one). One point I would like to make is that Real\n\n3D is not in the business of developing games or game software. We\n\nhave done a couple at the request of Sega, but Real 3D is a graphics\n\nhardware provider and the primary business of the company is designing\n\nchips, boards, and high-end graphics systems.\n\nHGN: Where do you see 3D going? Its got to be more than just an\n\nincreasing polygon count, which seems to be the current trend.\n\nR3D: 3D is a lot more than polygon count - it's realism. That means\n\nadding new features and improving quality in addition to more polygons\n\nand higher fill rates. The next generation of 3-D graphics\n\naccelerators will enhance pixel fidelity with greater color and z-\n\nbuffer depths, as well as offer higher quality texture and blending\n\nmodes and improved illumination and depth effects. Realism will reach\n\nnew heights by the use of more and higher resolution textures enabled\n\nvia full utilization of AGP textures. Higher resolution frames at real-\n\ntime update rates and improved anti-aliasing will also enhance the\n\nrealism of the user experience. More polygons and pixels are\n\nimportant, but to truly do \"real 3D\", you have to do much more. That's\n\nwhy one of the things we're trying to evangelize is to not simply\n\nconsider performance (fill rate, polygons), but look at a combination\n\nof performance and image quality."
