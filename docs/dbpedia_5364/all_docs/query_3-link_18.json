        "text": "The year is 1989. In that year, people such as Taylor Swift, Danielle Radcliff, the late Avicii, SZA, Pewdiepie, Markiplier, and myself were born. Songs like “Bust A Move” by Young MC, “Cherish” and “Like A Prayer” by Madonna, and “Love Shack” by The B-52’s topped the charts. Movies like Disney’s The Little Mermaid, the Tim Burton directed Batman, Ghostbusters II, and Weekend At Bernie’s premiered in theaters. The Simpsons, Chip n’ Dale Rescue Rangers, Family Matters, Baywatch, and Seinfeld premiered on TV. In Japan, anime like Dragon Ball Z, Patlabor, and Ranma 1/2 premiered on TV while Kiki’s Delivery Service premiered in theaters. Video games like Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Final Fight, SimCity, and DuckTales came out while Sega launched arcade games like Golden Axe, Turbo OutRun, and Tetris. Sega had done something else even more significant on this day that very same year, though. They launched the Sega Mega-Drive in North America as the Sega Genesis and the world would never be the same. Happy 35th anniversary!\n\nOn August 14th, 1989, Sega of America launched the Genesis in North America to much fanfare, including with a televised launch party attended by convicted felon and presidential hopeless Donald Trump. Sega had failed to make much of a splash in North America with the still beloved Master System, but they had a new plan in mind for the Genesis. That plan included a fierce mockery of Nintendo’s strict adherence to sanitized, family friendly gaming, with the tagline “Genesis Does What Nintendon’t” remaining a staple in gamer lingo. This allowed Sega to stand out with the teens-to-adults crowd and ended up with Sega being the first video game console manufacturer to seriously threaten Nintendo’s market dominance, as well as inspiring future console rivals Sony and Microsoft to do the same with the PlayStation and Xbox respectively, while stealing Sega’s thunder in the process. Today, the Sega Genesis lives on in gaming and pop culture history as one of the most influential and memorable gaming consoles of all time and a hallmark of the 1990’s.\n\nCome with us past the break to continue this celebration.\n\nContinue Reading ➜\n\nToday, ATLUS shared a trailer highlighting Metis, the new android companion in Persona 3 Reload’s Episode Aigis -The Answer –. The trailer also introduces Lizzie Freeman, the voice actor bringing Metis to life. Episode Aigis is the third and final addition to the Persona 3 Reload: Expansion Pass, featuring 30 hours of all-new gameplay, new costumes and background music sets.\n\nCharacter Description of Metis: A mysterious android who claims to be Aigis’s “sister”. She appears before the S.E.E.S. members who are trapped in a never-ending March 31st time loop and leads them to the Abyss of Time that has appeared in the basement of the dormitory. Her unique Persona is Psyche, specializing in physical, wind, and ice skills.\n\nEpisode Aigis -The Answer – releases on September 10, 2024, and will be available on Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, Windows, Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, Steam, PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4.\n\nThe Expansion Pass is available for free to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers. Persona 3 Reload: Expansion Pass can be purchased on digital storefronts today for $34.99 and also includes the previously released Persona 5 Royal EX BGM Set, Persona 4 Golden EX BGM Set and Velvet Costume & BGM Set. For more information on Persona 3 Reload, visit persona.atlus.com/p3r/.\n\nTMS Entertainment, a beloved Japanese animation studio currently owned by Sega Holdings Inc., a subsidiary of SegaSammy holdings, has just announced that for their 60th anniversary, they’ll begin uploading special animated features of significant importance to the company to their official YouTube page. Most noteworthy to Sega/Sonic fans, this includes the first six episodes of Sonic X in its original Japanese dub. The entire campaign begins on August 5th, 2024. This is a good chance to get a taste of what Sonic X was originally like, free of both English voices and the cacophony of censorship edits imposed on it in its original English dub by 4Kids Entertainment.\n\nEDIT: It’s come to my attention that one of the other anime part of this celebration: Super Dimension Century Orguss, also has a Sega connection, as Sega made an SG-1000 game based on it. I’m adding details about that show below the break too.\n\nGotta go fast as you rush past the break for the skinny on this special event. GO! GO! GO! GO! LET’S GO!\n\nContinue Reading ➜\n\nSega Rally 2006, the first Sega Rally game made exclusively for a console, has just gotten an all new fan translation released. Previously only released in Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan, this PS2 classic had all of its text in those countries’ only, until now, that is. For the first time ever, you can play the game almost entirely in English now.\n\nWhile graphics featuring text could not be translated, as there is no way to easily change the text in graphics at this time, much of the important text in the game has been completely translated into English, making menus much less of a chore to navigate for the Japanese impaired. The newly translated text consists of:\n\nCareer Mode intro and profile creation.\n\nCareer Mode top menus (Calendar, trophies, etc.).\n\nCalendar race names, vehicle restrictions, and rewards.\n\nGarage and Shop menus, including part and tire names, descriptions, and tuning menu.\n\nPre-race splash screens.\n\nSponsorship contract tutorials and objectives.\n\nFor a link to where you can download this patch, have a look past the break.\n\nContinue Reading ➜\n\nHow many of you were aware the Grand Theft Auto III (2001) was originally meant to have a version on Sega Dreamcast? It moved away from Dreamcast after developer DMA Design, today known as Rockstar North, came into agreement that the Dreamcast was no longer a viable platform for the game, most likely due to Sega bowing out of the console hardware race in 2001. Had the game released on Dreamcast as originally intended, it would’ve gone on to be a major feather in the Dreamcast’s cap for years to come.\n\nWhile we can’t go back in time and make DMA Design stick to it’s original Dreamcast release plans, one fan has taken it upon themselves to convert the game over to Dreamcast. Homebrew developer SKMP has been building a new Dreamcast GTA III port using assets and reverse engineered code from the original PC version. Lately, he’s even gained some help from a few other Dreamcast homebrew developers, including Frogbull, who’s best known for creating a Metal Gear Solid 2 tech demo for Dreamcast. While the port is still work-in-progress as of this writing, what’s been done so far is nothing short of amazing. After all, just because GTA III was originally meant to be a Dreamcast game, doesn’t mean that bringing the finished game to Dreamcast is as simple as you might think.\n\nYou’ll find out more about what I mean past the break.\n\nContinue Reading ➜\n\nThis is for the Sega Saturn racing fans out there. Solo indie developer Walaber (Creator of the Jelly Car series and credited on Where’s My Water?) is paying tribute to the mighty Saturn with his brand new retro styled time trial racer Parking Garage Rally Circuit. This game is designed to look like an authentic Sega Saturn game from 1998 and is currently listed on Steam, where it is planned to release for Windows, Linux, and Steam Deck sometime within 2024.\n\nMore exciting than that is that Walaber wants to bring this game to Nintendo Switch and the very console he’s paying homage to, the Sega Saturn. He will bring the game to Switch if it can sell 50,000 downloads on Steam, and then make a special Saturn version of the game after achieving 100,000 downloads on Steam. If you wanna see this game in your collection for either console, then you can start by wishlisting the game on Steam right now and then buying it after it’s released. Let your money do the talking.\n\nBut if you need more convincing than that, we have extra info for you beyond the break. We bet you’ll be heading on down with this kind of ferocity.\n\nContinue Reading ➜"
