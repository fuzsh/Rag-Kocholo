        "text": "Blowing up bad guys from a comfy couch is about to get a little more horsepower, thanks to the upcoming introduction of the GMC Hummer EV to the Call of Duty video-game series.\n\nThe Hummer will be available as a playable vehicle in Modern Warfare II (starting October 28) and Warzone 2.0 (later this fall).\n\nThe popular games have previously included digital Humvees and Jeep vehicles. Jeep even produced a small number of Call of Duty–branded special editions a decade ago.\n\nThe U.S. military uses more than 100 million barrels of oil each year, making it one of the biggest consumers of petroleum in the world. The military has also spent millions over the past decade or more transitioning some of its vehicles to electric power. These feel like important details to know before we get to the news that the GMC Hummer EV will soon be available as a playable vehicle in the Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II and Call of Duty: Warzone 2.0 video games.\n\nGMC said this week that a digitized version of the Hummer EV will bring its estimated 1000 horsepower and 3.3-second zero-to-60-mph time to the Activision video games before the end of the year. The massive EV will be available in Modern Warfare II on October 28 and in Warzone 2.0 sometime later this fall.\n\nOther real-world vehicles have appeared in Call of Duty games before. The Jeep Wrangler has made multiple appearances, for example, as has the original Humvee. Jeep even built small numbers of Call of Duty–branded vehicles around a decade ago, including a Black Ops Edition and a Modern Warfare 3 Edition."
