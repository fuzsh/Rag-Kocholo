        "text": "Sega Lindbergh Manufacturer: Sega Variants: Silver, Red, Red EX, Blue\n\nRelease Date RRP Code JP 2005 ¥? ? US 200x $? ? UK 200x £? ?\n\nThe Sega Lindbergh (リンドバーグ) is an arcade platform developed by Sega as a successor to the Sega NAOMI 2 arcade system. It was launched in 2005 and acted as Sega's \"primary\" arcade system until the release of the Sega RingEdge platform in 2009.\n\nHardware\n\nUnlike previous arcade platforms which had either been bespoke systems or based on home console technology, the Lindbergh family (and virtually all of its successors) mirror the architecture seen in standard PCs, with a Intel Pentium 4 as its main CPU and graphics cards supplied by NVIDIA. Sega had originally planned to use the Microsoft's Xbox 360 as the basis for the arcade board, but is thought to have opted for standard PC hardware as this proved more cost-effective.\n\nAccording to Sega-AM2 head Hiroshi Kataoka, porting Lindbergh titles (such as Virtua Fighter 5) to Sony's PlayStation 3 was generally easier than porting to Xbox 360, because the Lindbergh and PS3 use a similar GPU.\n\nLindbergh was introduced by Sega when the arcade industry and the company itself was at great change. Ultimately, only Initial D Arcade Stage 4 (Then renamed to Initial D: Extreme Stage), Virtua Fighter 5, After Burner Climax and The House of the Dead 4 were released on console, with the latter two being ported half a decade later. Arcade games became increasingly exclusive to arcade operators, to keep incentive for people to go to actual venues both in Japan and in the western world.\n\nVariants\n\nThere are five variants of Lindbergh, each designated by colour, although the casing design is thought to be much the same across all of them.\n\nLindbergh (yellow)\n\nYellow is the \"standard\" Lindbergh system, used for most of Sega's \"big\" games which do not need special requirements.\n\nList of games\n\nGallery\n\nMain system (Front view)\n\nMain system (Up Left view)\n\nSystem connectors\n\nPromotional render\n\nTechnical specifications\n\nDigital Manuals\n\nJP Manual\n\nPromotional material\n\nJP press release\n\nInfo sheet\n\nPhysical Scans\n\nLindbergh Red\n\nRed is a lower-end CPU and GPU model, although the specific changes are not currently known.\n\nList of games\n\nDigital manuals\n\nUK manual\n\nGallery\n\nArtwork\n\nTechnical specifications\n\nLindbergh Red EX\n\nThe Red EX is thought to be identical to the Lindbergh Red but has twice as much RAM.\n\nList of games\n\nSega Network Taisen Mahjong MJ4 (2008)\n\nRambo (2008)\n\nSega Network Taisen Mahjong MJ4 Evolution (2010)\n\nGallery\n\nTechnical specifications\n\nPhysical Scans\n\nLindbergh Blue\n\nThe Blue is also thought to be identical to the Red, but runs Microsoft Windows as its operating system instead of Linux.\n\nList of games\n\nDerby Owners Club 2008: Feel the Rush (2008)\n\nWorld Club Champion Football: Intercontinental Clubs 2006-2007 (2008)\n\nWorld Club Champion Football: Intercontinental Clubs 2007-2008 (2009)\n\nDerby Owners Club 2009: Ride for the Live (2009)\n\nWorld Club Champion Football: Intercontinental Clubs 2008-2009 (2009)\n\nWorld Club Champion Football: Intercontinental Clubs 2009-2010 (2010)\n\nGallery\n\nTechnical specifications\n\nPhysical Scans\n\nLindbergh Silver\n\nThe Silver is supposedly the satellite terminal option, although it is exceedingly rare and may not have been produced in large numbers. It was never sold, instead being rented out by Sega to Japanese arcade operators, who must return the board after use. The Silver came with an IC card that went inside a reader inside the PCB set. This IC card contained information which identified the current user of the board, as well as a profit sharing device that allowed the operator to split the machine's profits with Sega.\n\nList of games\n\nNetwork Taisen Quiz Answer X Answer\n\nVirtua Fighter 5: Final Showdown (2010)\n\nGallery\n\nPromotional render\n\nPhysical Scans\n\nProduction credits\n\nSource:\n\nVarious sources\n\nReferences"
