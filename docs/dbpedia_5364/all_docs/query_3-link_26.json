This is the chip that Sega originally commissioned for its\n\nnext-generation console, the Dreamcast. The NV2 is the chip that was\n\nNVIDIA's greatest fiasco.\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________\n\nThe Beginning\n\nIn our History of NVIDIA article we hypothesized that Sega started a\n\nrelationship with NVIDIA only after having spent some time porting\n\ngames over to the NV1. This was a mistake -the connection traces\n\nfurther back than that.\n\nTo begin our story, we need to go all the way back to the Sega Saturn.\n\nThe Saturn used a Sega-developed graphics chip that was considered by\n\nmost of the world to be dreadful. The geometric primitive was a\n\nfour-vertex polygon (not three). As a result, triangles on the Saturn\n\nhad to be represented by a degenerate quad with two vertices existing\n\nat the same location.\n\nDevelopers hated quads and wanted something better, namely triangles.\n\nWith the Sony PlayStation handily killing the Sega Saturn at retail,\n\nSega decided that it needed to partner with a company with 3D graphics\n\nexperience for its next-generation console.\"\n\nQuad Texture Maps, bad\n\n1995: The launch of the NV1\n\nAs we mentioned in our History of NVIDIA article, the NV1 was NVIDIA's\n\nfirst chip and was considered to be ahead of its time in many regards.\n\nSpecifically, the NV1 was novel in that it integrated audio and I/O\n\nprocessing on a single chip along with video. While integrated\n\nsolutions may not have been appealing on the PC, this was perfect for\n\nthe console, as a highly integrated part would keep costs low.\n\nSega hoped that it could get NVIDIA to tweak the NV1's 3D architecture\n\nfor its console needs, allowing the company to take advantage of the\n\nchip's low-cost graphics with integrated audio and I/O processing. A\n\nhigh level deal was made between NVIDIA and Sega of Japan involving\n\napproximately 7 million dollars in investment capital.\n\nInterestingly enough, the upper management at Sega had been so\n\nmesmerized by the possibilities of integration that the deal was\n\nsigned before the NV1 was actually released to retail, before Sega\n\neven knew what NVIDIA's idea of 3D was.\n\nMore quads!\n\nThe NV1 was technologically superior to other chips of that era from\n\ntwo perspectives: audio and I/O. Unfortunately, the quadratic texture\n\nmaps were not so appealing, and outside of NVIDIA, no one believed in\n\nquadratic texture maps -not even Sega.\n\nThe NV1 used forward-rendered quads, which was essentially what the\n\nSaturn had done, and was exactly what developers hated most about the\n\nSaturn. Now NVIDIA was trying to convince Sega that it was still a\n\ngood approach. The tech demos of round spheres always looked nice, but\n\nin real-world games, working with quadratic texture maps was\n\nhorrendous. Even simple things such as collision detection become very\n\ndifficult.\n\nBack to the storyline\n\nAt this time (1995-1996), NVIDIA was still a fledgling startup with\n\napproximately 30 employees and NVIDIA's Chief Technical Officer,\n\nCurtis Priem, was enamored by quadratic texture maps. As CTO, he made\n\nquadratic texture maps the standard at NVIDIA.\n\nShortly after executives at Sega and NVIDIA had signed the deal, Sega\n\nprogramming legend Yu Suzuki entered the scene. Although the original\n\ncontract had already been signed at high-levels, the arcade\n\nmanufacturing groups had a great deal of influence over what chip was\n\ngoing to be used in the next console, but despite their power, the AM\n\ngroups did not see the console as their core market or concern. While\n\nSega had its ups and downs in the home market competing against the\n\nlikes of Nintendo and later Sony, its arcade division traditionally\n\ndid very well. Indeed, although Capcom's Street Fighter II was the\n\nmost popular arcade game in the world since Pac-Man, Sega's Virtua\n\nFighter actually had a lead in Japan for a short time.\n\nSuzuki-san, head of Sega's flagship AM2 division, assigned one of his\n\nbest graphics people to interface with NVIDIA in the US. Although we\n\ndo not have this engineer's name, we know that he had previously\n\ninterfaced with Real3D in the past, and, from outside reports, had an\n\nexceptional understanding of 3D graphics techniques and rendering\n\npipelines. Most importantly, he knew exactly what the AM software\n\ndevelopment groups at Sega needed in a graphics chip, namely\n\ntriangles.\n\nMeetings were held to discuss the rendering primitive for the NV2.\n\nSega pushed for real triangle acceleration to be included in the NV2,\n\nbut NVIDIA did not comply. NVIDIA insisted that time was better\n\nallocated developing the quadratic texture map portion of the NV2 and\n\nadapting existing triangle-based development tools such as 3D modelers\n\nto QTMs.\"\n\nThe End of the NV2\n\nJust say no to triangles\n\nDespite Sega of America's and the AM2 representative's best efforts,\n\nNVIDIA remained adamant on using quadratic texture maps and refused to\n\nconcentrate on triangle primitives. In the end, our sources tell us\n\nthat NVIDIA may have eventually agreed to support better acceleration\n\nfor triangles, but by then, Sega of Japan had already begun to\n\ndistance itself from NVIDIA, and Sega's US team was quietly told \"not\n\nto worry about the NVIDIA thing anymore.\"\n\nAs a Japanese company, Sega could never kill a deal, for there was a\n\nneed to maintain honor and face. These cultural elements can be seen\n\ntoday when top Japanese executives choose to demote themselves after\n\npoor earnings reports, or when disappointing employees are\n\n\"transferred\" to small offices and given no assignments rather than\n\nfired. The expectation is that the shame alone will lead the employee\n\nto quit himself.\n\nPico?\n\nNVIDIA was relegated to this similar position. Sega told NVIDIA that\n\nthey were still contracted to provide a chip for Sega, but that it was\n\nnot going to be used in its next generation console. The plan was to\n\nuse the chip in a less demanding multimedia consumer product, probably\n\nthe next-generation Sega Pico.\n\nThe Sega Pico, as some of you may not know, was a kid's educational\n\ntoy targeted for children, 2-8 years old. It was a stylus and tablet\n\nthat connected to the TV and used cartridges as its media. The Pico\n\nhad such great titles as \"Magic Crayons\", \"Richard Scarry's Huckle\n\nLowly's Busiest Day Ever\", and even a few Disney titles. Basically,\n\nNVIDIA was most likely delegated to work on a glorified See 'n Say.\n\nThe death of NV2\n\nWhat was the actual performance of the NV2? The truth will never be\n\nknown. When the first silicon came back, it didn't work. NVIDIA respun\n\nthe chip a few more times, but it soon became clear that the chip had\n\nmore than just minor problems. With such dismal results, the NV2 team\n\neventually called it quits. To the best of our knowledge, the NV2\n\nnever existed as a working product.\"\n\nSega Black Belt\n\nReal3D and 3dfx\n\nWith the collapse of the NVIDIA deal, Sega started looking for another\n\npartner and eventually hooked up with Real3D, then a subsidiary of\n\nLockheed Martin. This seemed like a good match as Sega had worked with\n\nReal3D on the development of the Model 2 arcade machine, and would\n\nlater work together again on the Model 3. The console chip would\n\nlikely have been at the same performance level or just slightly below\n\nReal3D's PC chip, the Intel i740.\n\nThe console was codenamed \"Black Belt\". Sega reasoned that casual\n\ngamers could get a \"white belt\" gaming system such as a PC, but real\n\ngamers would want something better, a \"black belt\" system.\n\nAlthough there were discussions between Real3D and Sega, Real3D never\n\nmade any silicon for the Black Belt. 3dfx had beaten Real3D by\n\noffering better performance and a more robust feature set. Officially,\n\nReal3D stated that the business model for the console market did not\n\ncreate a win-win situation with Sega as it did in the high-end arcade\n\nmarket.\n\nSega awarded 3dfx with the chip contract. The console's Black Belt\n\nname remained even after the graphics chip was to be replaced by a\n\nvariant of the 3dfx Voodoo2.\n\n3dfx, NEC, and VideoLogic\n\nWhile Sega of America was working on the 3dfx-based console, Sega of\n\nJapan was tasked with the development of a parallel console powered by\n\nNEC/VideoLogic's PowerVR chipset, codenamed Katana. The teams were\n\ntold that the \"winner\" wouldn't necessarily be the machine with the\n\nbest performance. It would be the one which would have games up and\n\nrunning more quickly.\n\nThe contest would became an exercise in futility as Sega of Japan and\n\nNEC eventually struck a deal to use the PowerVR chip before the two\n\nconsoles were actually ready to be compared. Black Belt engineers\n\ninsisted that their 3dfx-powered system would have won the race.\n\nAfter walking through the entire PC 3D graphics industry, Sega finally\n\nfound its chip. Fortunately for Sega, the PowerVR Series 2 chip, which\n\nNEC and VideoLogic had been co-developing for some time, turned out to\n\nbe a most impressive chip for the console, with exciting features such\n\nas texture compression and deferred rendering. The PowerVR-based\n\nconsole was presented to the AM groups who gave it the green light:\n\nthe Dreamcast was born.\n\n3dfx later sued Sega, NEC and VideoLogic, alleging that Sega\n\ndeliberately mislead 3dfx to gain access to confidential technologies\n\nbefore choosing to go with NEC and VideoLogic. 3dfx, Sega, NEC, and\n\nVideoLogic eventually reached a settlement out of court.\"\n\nNVIDIA\n\nChanges\n\nJen-Hsun Huang, NVIDIA's CEO, was disappointed by everything that had\n\nled to the collapse of the Sega deal. As CEO, he remained an active\n\nparticipant in meetings and was intimate with the technical decisions\n\nmade at NVIDIA. He knew something had to change.\n\nThe failure of the NV2 prompted Huang to pick up David Kirk as Chief\n\nScientist, who had previously been with software developer Crystal\n\nDynamics. David Kirk essentially became the Gary Tarolli of NVIDIA,\n\nand turned NVIDIA around by combining the company's 3D knowledge with\n\nhis game development experience.\n\nSuccess\n\nNVIDIA was reborn, and after the success of the NV3, or RIVA 128, the\n\nentire company would quickly discard ties to its blemished past. The\n\nrest of course, is history.\n\nIn retrospect, considering the magnitude of the failure of the NV2\n\nit's no surprise that NVIDIA has never publicly disclosed the project.\n\nStill, the details of this incident only underline how much of a\n\ntransformation NVIDIA has undergone. Five years ago, NVIDIA made\n\nmistakes that could have killed other companies, and today NVIDIA is a\n\nleader in its industry with no signs of slowing down. NVIDIA went from\n\nbeing a reject for the Sega Pico to the developers of the NV20 and the\n\nMicrosoft Xbox.\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________\n\nfull articles can be found here:\n\nhttp://www.firingsquad.com/features/nvidiahistory/default.asp\n\nhttp://www.firingsquad.com/features/nv2/default.asp\n\nArchived from groups: alt.comp.periphs.videocards.nvidia (More info?)\n\ninteresting read, thanks\n\n\"R420\" <radeonr420@yahoo.com> wrote in message\n\nnews:51488ce2.0406132236.62969e12@posting.google.com...\n\n> found a few old articles on Nvidia's early years. this early time in\n\n> Nvidia's existance is closely tied to Sega.\n\n>\n\n>\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\n___\n\n>\n\n> NVIDIA's Console Chip\n\n>\n\n> NV2\n\n>\n\n> NVIDIA's financial savior came in the form of a video game console,\n\n> more specifically, a Sega video game console.
