        "text": "Yeah, they could. I checked their list. They have a lot of games. But as far as I can see, no game is newer than from year 2000. And no game is 3d? Since Sega used the same hardware for a lot of games, could they emulate one machine, and then make collections with ease enough to make it worth it to release them?\n\nTo be able to play the arcade versions of Virtua Fighter 1&3 again would be awesome.\n\nYes! I agree! Virtua Fighter 2 was already in Yakuza, right?\n\nI'm not sure a Virtua Fighter collection would sell outside of Japan though. In my dreams I see a bigger collection. Like the Genesis collection, but for games released for example for Naomi and Naomi 2. How big were those games in file sizes? I know Sega Saturn only used CDs, but Dreamcast had GD roms.\n\nSega should just do what Hamster is doing with Arcade archives\n\nIn fact.. Every publisher with lots of old games should do this\n\nYeah; I second this. We've had 80s and early 90s arcade AND platform games treated as economic commodities; that is the era best preserved. It has been this way since PSone's era almost 25 years ago with collections like Namco Museum.\n\nWe haven't really moved past that at all. In fact, we are going backwards. Sega was starting to offer some later games through Sega ages and some individual dreamcast and saturn games for digital download in the xbox360 era, but that's been harshly rescended and the best offer that they can offer consumers is another Sega Genesis collection and take away Sonic 3, Sonic and Knuckles and its lock ons.\n\nPSone games aren't even available to purchase this gen beyond full ports or remakes. And while I am in a huge minority, if not the only one; I am not willing to deal with the scarcity, extra television hookups and shelf space, and limited selection of games in retro tv consoles like NES mini and SNES mini. I'd much rather have the virtual console initiative back.\n\nI guess it's worth coming to terms that the videogame industry doesn't care about catalogue titles at all, and I need to find a way to connect 12 consoles up to my flat screen TV.\n\nAn unfortunate situation where there are too many games and too little reasonable return. Your only hope is emulation.\n\nI really don't expect that you wll ever be able to play no-name games that came and went (Dirt Devls, Emergency Call Ambulance). Franchises like Golden Axe have a chance.\n\nIn the days when Sega had a console, the needed to pad out thier release schedules, with arcade ports. Now it's not necesarry.\n\nThat is a sad conclusion. I really hope that is not the case. Of all arcade game developers I know of, Sega has the biggest catalogue of unrelease arcade classics.\n\nSega has the biggest selection of newer and older games. The pile of games you are only able to play in arcades grows to this day.\n\nAn unfortunate situation where there are too many games and too little reasonable return. Your only hope is emulation.\n\n.\n\nI don't really follow emulation news closely, but if free emulators have been made; couldn't Sega license one of them? Then release a collection. I understand if I soumd desperate here, but as you said, Sega has such a big collction of arcade games. Many of those I'd love to play.\n\nSega has so much they could mine for retro collections, many of thier old arcade systems are well emulated at this point. I don't need another MD collection, I own them all on Steam.\n\nIn general in the case of games that aren't intended for a full port anymore I wish these companies with such a deep history could at least provide a legal avenue to purchase the ROMs so we can just use them in Mame or Retroarch. We really need a GOG like store for retro roms."
