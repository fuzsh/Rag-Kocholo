        "text": "Youtube trailer now available - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InxuapWWY7A\n\nYou might remember my old ‘WIP’ thread for this game.\n\nIve been busy lately with other projects, but have recently had time to add new features and fix all the bugs, and now i think i can finally call it finished. Its also about time I moved on and finished some other projects.\n\nThe game is simple. One player takes control of a Hummer, the other takes control of a Helicopter. Then you can fight it out.\n\nHeres a couple of screens:\n\nAnd heres some of the fixes and new features ive added:\n\nFixed the glitch when the helicopter is destroyed (game no longer crashes)\n\nThe hummer can now be destroyed also (with debris etc)\n\nAdded fuel for each vehicle (helicopter uses it up faster)\n\nAdded refueling stations for each vehicle (landing pad for helicopter, garage for Hummer)\n\nAdded a warning flash when fuel reaches a critical level\n\nWeapons can now overheat (limiting use)\n\nHelicopter has a shield over its landing pad, which activates on landing (protecting the helicopter as it refuels)\n\nA shield generator for the landing pad (can be destroyed, leaving the helicopter vulnerable while refueling)\n\nAdded a small city, for the hummer to drive around and hide in\n\nAdded a defense point counter for the Hummer, this activates a cannon in the city which can help defend the hummer\n\nFuel, health and defense point boxes spawn randomly in the sky and fall to the ground to be collected\n\nLimited the use of the hummer ‘flipper’ (can only be used after the hummer has been on its back for a certain amount of time)\n\nUpdated the levels terrain, with surrounding mountains etc\n\nAdded extra camera views for the garage and landing pad\n\nCollisions between players results in losing health\n\nFlashing light on the helicopter :eyebrowlift2:\n\nA LOT of tweaking and editing to get everything in the game working well\n\nAnd much, much, much more (i cant remember everything atm)\n\nGame Downloads:\n\nWindows .exe here (8mb) http://www.box.net/shared/t5caf8tgkw\n\nLinux port (By Kernal_Script) http://www.mediafire.com/?ylnym0m2n2t (Updated, with no sound?)\n\nSome tips, credits and controls are all available in-game (press H at any time to view controls)\n\nI might fix up some errors if anyone finds anything really bad, but ive done a lot of testing with friends etc. All the major errors have been sorted out.\n\nSo thats it! Im quite happy with it, ive played (‘tested’) it for hours with friends and brother and its great fun.\n\nI also have an action packed youtube video demonstration of the game coming soon.\n\nEnjoy!!\n\nYeh everyone seems to lose the landing pad! You just have to look for the 4 buildings, which are all situated around it. After playing for a while you get to know where it is all the time, its just part of the challenge :yes:\n\nPerhaps ill update it and make the heli pad a bit higher though, it seems to disappear down the hill, you cant see it from the city…\n\nIm working on getting a linux executable, ill probubly make one at uni tomorrow.\n\nIm not so worried about people cracking it, or all that GPL stuff (where exactly can i see all that ‘being obliged by blender to publish the .blend’ stuff???) Id be interested to see where that came from.\n\nHummer vs Helicopter\n\nHello AD-Edge,\n\nI have played the game together with my younger brother (who also plays Crysis and Heroes of Might and Magic) .\n\nBe prepared because we like to tell people why some games suck. Well, actually I like to tell people why a lot of games suck.\n\nWe have to tell you that we can’t call this game finished. Mainly because of balancing issues.\n\nGameplayOverall it is OK. I wonder if the others played with two players because that is when you will notice some balancing issues. The helicopter is in fact doomed to loose in most cases. It is hard to aim with it because it is hard to rotate the helicopter and it is hard to see where the missles will hit and I can barely see where my bullets will hit because the helicopter is flying in front of the bullets most of the time.\n\nThe helicopter uses up a lot of fuel, a bit too much fuel in my opinion.\n\nThe hummer can last a lot longer and can avoid enemy rockets easily since they will barely hit the target. When they do hit the hummer it suddenly twirls in the air like if it doesn’t weight even a bit. It made us laugh but it is a weight problem that is to be taken serious. The hummer also flips really fast giving the helicopter more chance to damage it. However I missed the hummer most of the time because I couldn’t exactly determ where the missiles/bullets would hit.\n\nThe hummer’s gun’s bullets are not actually coming out of the gun but are created above the gun which confuses the player and takes some time to get used to.\n\nGraphicsCould have been better. They look fair from the helicopter’s viewpoint but the hummer sees ugly over-sized textures. A higher texture resolution can really make this game look better.\n\nThe lighting is not as good as I hoped. It looks ugly on the player models and it looks like the terrain isn’t affected by it at all.\n\nSoundI shouldn’t review this because I would be a real bastard if I did.\n\nCopyrightDid you release it under GPL on purpose?\n\nThat was my review. Thanks for reading it. I hope you’ll work on the issues I described in my review.\n\nGameplay: 7.8 out of 10\n\nGraphics: 5.7 out of 10\n\nSound: 4.6 out of 10\n\nFinal rating: 6.0\n\nAniCator\n\nPS: For the people that read my review, AD-Edge is aware of the fact I was writing a review that pointed out a lot of the issues. Have fun playing the game.\n\nThanks for the review AniCator.\n\nI realize the game isnt perfect, and by saying that its finished in this case doesnt mean it perfect. (it just means ive had enough of it, and need to move on to other projects)\n\nIts definatly not made to be compared to Crysis or any other modern game like that. Bit unfair.\n\nYes thats true, but have you tryed the second view for the helicopter? (middle mouse button, or scrool wheel pressed down). That is a much better view for shooting, it even has a crosshair (which isnt that good, ill admit that)\n\nAlso remeber to get the other view in the hummer press C, which helps for aiming with the hummer.\n\nAfter a lot of tweaking i found that turing the gravity down helped the helicopter fly smoother, which does effect the way the hummer flys into the air, but can make some pretty impressive moments, as the hummer flys through the air after taking a direct hit from a rocket. Its unrealistic, but realism wasnt a main aim in this game.\n\nLol, originally there wasnt any sound in the game at all, i added a few just for the effect, but didnt pay much attention. So yes, i know its terrible. I usually just play it with the sound off anyway. :yes:\n\nI dont remeber releasing it under any license.\n\nIve just posted the .exe her for others to play, and leave feedback.\n\nMy final note - Ive played a lot against friends at uni, and my brother. After getting used to the controls for both the helicopter and hummer ive found it to be pretty evenly matched, perhaps slightly weighted in favor of the hummer (the helicopter can be quite vulnerable at times), but overall the battles ive had are usually quite close. Especially when health packs are floating around, ive had battles that have lasted over 20 minutes.\n\nThanks for the feedback though AniCator, its good to get as many reviews on these things, it just means the next game i make can be better (hopefully with better sfx):yes:"
