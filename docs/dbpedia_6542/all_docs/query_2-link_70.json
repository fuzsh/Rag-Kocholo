        "text": "The Made in America festival will return to Ben Franklin Parkway in Philadelphia this September 3 and 4. The two-day festival, led by Bad Bunny and Tyler, The Creator and featuring Lil Uzi Vert, Jazmine Sullivan, Burna Boy, Snoh Aalegra, Kodak Black, Tate McRae, Victoria Monet, Pusha T and more, was once again curated by Roc Nation founder Jay-Z.\n\nWhile the talent for Made in America once again comes from Jay-Z, the logistics of running the festival, which began in 2012, will again fall under Roc Nation CEO Desiree Perez, one of the most respected leaders in music.\n\nThe day I spoke with her I was also meeting with John Sykes, President, Entertainment Enterprises for iHeartMedia Chair of the Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame. As soon as I mentioned Perez's name Sykes offered to give me a quote, something he says he rarely does.\n\n“Desiree has built an incredible reputation for understanding the needs of both her artists and her business partners,\" said Sykes. “There’s nothing she wouldn’t do for talent, and as a partner, her word is gold.”\n\nThere is no question Perez is a straight shooter, one who can spend as much time talking about prison reform, social justice and dog rescue as she can discussing the festival. I talked with her about all of this and much more.\n\nSteve Baltin: How did you handle Made In America last year?\n\nDesiree Perez: It was actually challenging, It was a challenging one because first they told us no restrictions and obviously I don't blame the city everything with COVID, you just don't know. So we started the process, they said no restrictions and then at like two months before we opened up before the festival date, they said COVID restrictions, everyone has to have a negative test or a vaccination. And we basically had to turn Aviator Park into a lab. So we brought out labs and we tested everyone who didn't have a vaccination card. Like we had a whole operation going on just to get into the festival. And we took over the whole park and it really worked that well. We didn't have any like super spreading or anything like that, we didn't have any issues.\n\nBaltin: I'm meeting this afternoon with John Sykes, who's a good friend. And we've talked about all this in regards to the ever-changing constant world of iHeart. You had to go through this last year and then everything seemed to be good. And I don't know how it is on the east coast, but in California, things are crazy again. So talk about how you prepare for the festival this year.\n\nPerez: Definitely, I think that's just the climate that we live in period for everything, I don't think it's just a festival, right? So we have to just prepare as best as we can but always have a conscious mind that something can change last minute and we're just going to have to just meet it halfway, whenever it happens. So yeah, definitely that and please tell John Sykes that I said, \"Hello.\" [Laughter]\n\nBaltin: I definitely will. And obviously looking at this lineup Made in America has evolved since year one. I did a piece earlier this year on the fact that Bad Bunny is literally the biggest touring artist in the world in 2022. So talk about what you were looking for in this lineup.\n\nPerez: A hundred percent, he's a huge artist. We're very excited that we were able to secure him as for the lineup and you're right, it's very difficult to stay diversified. So to be able to secure these kinds of acts especially after COVID and everyone wants to perform everywhere and everyone's getting booked, all those kudos unfortunately do not go to me, they go to Jay, he's the curator of the festival. He actually does it all himself. He chooses every single artist that performs, is curated by Jay. He makes those decisions. [But] I have to put the festival together, there's a lot of operations, budgetary situations, all the different aspects of the festival. [Laughter] They go along with the festival. He actually has the easy job I think. I'm just kidding. No, but we work as a team obviously. He chooses all the acts, I do the rest.\n\nBaltin: Does he give you a hint as to what's coming or do you get to be surprised by the lineup?\n\nPerez: No he doesn't give a hint. I think he just does it off the cuff, he makes those decisions when it's time. And we start just building and looking for the different acts that he wants in involved. And like you said, Bad Bunny is obviously someone that we're very excited about just because he happens to be also at the top of his game overall, globally. He's a phenomenon right now.\n\nBaltin: Let's go back for a minute and talk about some of your favorite moments at the festival over the years.\n\nPerez: I think The Weeknd few years back (2015) for sure. I don't know that he had necessarily hit to that level and we got him, we secured him and then he was that level by the time he performed. But Jay had a good eye for him, so that was a really good moment. It was almost like one of those acts that you're like, \"Man, I'm so happy that we got him.\"It's not easy, but it's obvious when you choose a Bad Bunny where he is and put him in as a headliner. And normally headliners, they obviously earn that spot. But I think The Weeknd you could have debated it at that time. And he's a superstar and we're so happy that he performed. Obviously, having Rihanna perform. Her performance was also something for the ages to watch, just amazing. She came off of a roof, like a ramp roof and then, the crowd just went crazy. Always amazing to have locals, right. So Meek's performance and Hinge had just come out, when he had just come out of his legal case, the whole free Meek Mill piece and coming out of his legal case and performing at Made in America for the first time was also amazing. We've done really well. We have obviously a special person doing this. It's not about, \"Okay, tell me who the hottest artists are and pick them,\" it's more than that. It goes into choosing who lines up Made in America and obviously who's the headliner.\n\nBaltin: I don't feel that anybody stays politically neutral in 2022. So are there things that you'll be doing to be socially active, especially coming up on such an important election, 'cause it's two months before the election?\n\nPerez: We pride ourselves, if you will, on how we run the festival in terms of we have some things that are specific to who we are and it speaks to just the ethos of the company itself. We have Cause Village and Cause Village, unlike a lot of different festivals, it's footage that's dedicated to different types of philanthropic or local organizations like Covenant House, which I'm sure you're familiar with. We have Covenant House in Philadelphia. We have dog rescues and we actually have them bring the dogs at my request, by the way. I make sure that they bring dogs and we air condition their area and we get them water. And we also do all sorts of voting initiatives and organizations come in for voting. So we, we're always very active. We make it a really cool space so that people could come by and they could either volunteer, learn about the organizations, donate, or just kind of become aware of what your local organizations are doing. And so we always have voting as part of it, especially around election time in general. We don't tell people how to vote 'cause we can't. And America is all about making your own decisions, but we definitely have an emphasis on voting and that's important to us. We've had presidents and children of presidents show up at our festival. I think we have a beautiful name, Made in America. And in terms of safety we've always been extra careful because of the name of our festival and all sorts of crazy people around the world being threatened by just saying, Made in America. And what does that really mean? Because I think it means something different to everyone else. It is by design that Made in America's in Philadelphia. It is by design that is on the Benjamin Franklin Parkway. It is by design that we actually are across a Parkway that has 90 flags of different countries from around the world. All of that is by design and Made in America is about that because that's what America is at least how we see America, at Roc Nation. So that's why we celebrate our festival there. And we're always extra safe in a lot of different ways, precautionary ways, crowd control. And obviously with COVID when the pandemic hit and we'll continue to be in all sorts of different areas of concern. We're always extra careful and from a budgetary perspective never think twice when it comes to the safety of our patrons.\n\nBaltin: The fact that you have a dog rescue makes this my new favorite festival in America now. So do you have a favorite rescue story that's come from this event?\n\nPerez: We get very excited anytime that a dog is actually adopted at the festival. So every single year we've had an adopted dog. And I go by to make sure I pet them myself. I love dogs and we always, whenever we have an adoption, it's always an incredible moment for the dogs. So my favorite story are those, when people pet them. You don't go to a festival, and think you're gonna adopt a dog. And when you hear that someone adopted a dog and walked away with one it's really special. So yeah, so all the adoption stories are always amazing. And it's always about someone who came and just couldn't forget the dog and had to come back and make arrangements to pick up the dog after. So those are the best. And we keep them. So for anyone that's worried about the hearing and everything else, we make sure that the area's not a high volume of music area. So it doesn't hurt the dogs in that way. We air condition the place and I always ask for them to bring older dogs and to bring pitbulls, that they have in Philly and bring those kinds of dogs that have been abused because those are the ones that really need love and care. And yeah, to answer your question, in terms of social justice we always have anything to improve our criminal justice system. We always welcome, again, not politically driven, but driven to just improve in general the conditions in our country.\n\nBaltin I get to talk to so many artists and whereas there was a climate where you could be politically neutral I don't think that really exists anymore.\n\nPerez: You are right. You have to declare is basically what you're saying. And It's true. We we're in a place now that not declaring what you stand for, what your values are, it's almost saying the opposite, right? So you have to declare where you stand on certain issues. For example, with voting, we're not saying vote Democratic or Republican, but we're saying you have to vote because your voice is so important. But when we have some sort of social justice organization there, about improving our criminal justice system, probation and parole, for example, we are declaring our values and where we stand with that. And, same with, even orphanages are there, organizations where you could adopt children. We actually have young kids that live in shelters, work during the summer there. It's only like a three-day job because you come the day before for training, you get paid. And then the two days of the festival one day is working and the next day they get to go to the festival and enjoy the festival. Because what you notice, regardless of where ours is, Center City, and that was intentional as well, a lot of people can't afford to rent a car or get on a plane and go somewhere for a festival. There are people that just want to enjoy a festival, but they can't afford to do that. And so being in the middle of the city is also deliberate. But there are kids that are in shelters that they can't afford a hundred and something dollar ticket, or go to watch this. And you see kids actually outside of the festival trying to look in and trying to see the stages. So we bring these kids in and they work. And part of their compensation is that one of the days they get to actually enjoy the festival as a patron. And usually it's from Covenant House and stuff. It's really cool because they get trained in different areas like production or ticketing or merch, whatever it is. We train them and have them work and they get paid. They go to the festival, they get to eat for free and get merch. So it's cool.\n\nBaltin Talk about how the festival is also unique to Philadelphia and the things that make the city special.\n\nPerez: We give jobs and there's a lot of economic advantage that impacts the city of Philadelphia from us being there. So it's kind of a give and take and it's that type of business relationship. But at the same time, you also have to come and try to impact it in a positive way. We have local food in all of our food trucks. But at the same time trying to help just activate, because like you said, there's a lot of people, I believe that at the core people are good. And so there's a lot of people that really don't understand issues. They just see whatever blurb somewhere. They don't understand the issues and maybe don't even have the time to get into the details. But if you have the opportunity when you're enjoying a festival to learn a little bit more about some sort of organization in your community, or, simply to meet someone that is in a shelter, who's a child and is trying to improve their lives by learning training, their first time ever being at a festival, really all of that is what it's supposed to be about. When you do business, you have to not just put your hands out. You have to put your hands out, but to lift someone up as well.\n\nBaltin: One of the cool things about Roc Nation is that you're working with people who have so many voices and obviously so many artists on Roc Nation as well, have that mantra of wanting to give back.\n\nPerez: It's almost like someone joining the family. It's just kind of who we are. And you normally like to see yourself and how you could improve yourself in someone else when you're working with them. So I think that the Roc family are artists and athletes. They all have that. And we have all sorts of programs where we either help them develop their own situation with 501 [c] [3] s or philanthropic efforts. Or we create situations where they could do the least, because they're busy with other things. But they want to give back, whether that's giving food or homeless shelter situations or gift toy drives, we do all sorts of things with our clients. We have a philanthropy division that works with our clients to try to help them figure out what they want to do. It's part of who we are. It's not just work. How do we make money? How do we make things happen? If you notice most of the artists that are with Roc, especially like Rihanna, Meg (Thee Stallion), people who are with us for a while, they all have their 501 [c] [3] s, they're very active in the community. And like you said earlier, they almost have to have a social justice impact voice in different ways, because someone's gotta do that job, especially if you're given the gift that you have and as a talent.\n\nBaltin: How will Roc Nation use its voice as a company to further social issues this year?\n\nPerez: Like you said, every election is important and everyone should always be voting. I think what's different now is we get to see people being raw. They actually let you see how they feel, meaning people who are obviously on opposite sides with how we view life. Like racism or injustice or all the different events that we've seen happen, even with abortion and where people stand with that. Obviously everyone's opinions are respected, but not opinions that are as extreme as racism. There's just no tolerance for hate of any kind, whether it's religion or sexual orientation or whatever it may be. And so having said that, I think the only blessing is that now people are bold enough to say, \"Oh yeah, I am a racist. And yes, I do hate gay people. It's okay.\" No, it's not okay. But the fact that we're able to see it gives us an advantage to be able to deal with it. I think that's the advantage in everything that's been happening lately. In terms of what we do and the voices and how we use our voices it has to be very authentic and natural for people, something that speaks to them. So we're not forcing anyone to do something that they don't want to do and it's not for press. And so I think the a perfect example is like Parchman prison in Mississippi and inhumane conditions of that prison. I don't know if you've ever even seen a the video, but just on a personal note I would love to send it to you. So you can see like a small video that we created from inmates who filmed different situations for themselves in there. People were dying, they're still dying, but one to two people a week. Look there is prison for a reason, and there's some people that belong in prison .But I think as a country, America is better than what we're doing to people and in the inhumane conditions in Mississippi that have been going on for decades. They have federal decrees about how inhumane these prisons are. And recently we hired a bunch of different experts in different areas like water, for example. And we got back all these reports from the most renowned experts in the country. And they basically came back for example, that the water at Parchman has feces in it. And obviously we knew that just from looking at the color of it and in all these videos that we have all this evidence that we have, we sued on behalf of 100 and something inmates in federal court. It was right before COVID unfortunately. So it's taken a long time, but recently the department of justice has stepped up. And all the attention that we brought to Mississippi were brought by Yo Gotti and Jay Z. And that's because number one Yo Gotti is from that area, he's from Memphis and is close to Mississippi, and he cares very much about Mississippi. He spent a lot of time there has family members there and has family members that have been in prison. And so having Gotti be part of getting the message out from a social media perspective, speaking on different platforms, news platforms, and just talking about the issues has helped to bring attention to these issues. So that's one example of how we've used the voices, the strengths of the folks that we represent, part of the Roc family to bring attention to those issues in different ways. And I've never set a foot in Mississippi. I've never been there, but I care because it's part of America."
