The outlet notes that Roc Nation has spearheaded “Dine and Learn,” an event series to educate students and parents in Philadelphia about PASS. “We have enjoyed such a special connection with Philadelphians, so we’ve made it our mission to invest in the long-term success of the city’s changemakers,” Dania Diaz, managing director of philanthropy at Roc Nation, said.
