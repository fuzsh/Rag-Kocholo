        "text": "Quincy, Florida’s Bobby Fishscale is an artist with an extraordinary evolutionary tale. From the bricks of Quincy to the conference rooms of Roc Nation with Jay-Z himself in attendance this is a story of intestinal fortitude and ultimate confidence though to hear him tell it, it didn’t start off that way! One of the funny stories he tells us is about going to the meeting with Roc Nation and finding out Jay-Z was in attendance which threw him for a loop initially. But I’m getting ahead of myself.\n\nFrom humble beginnings in Quincy, a place which he describes as overrun by poverty and lack of opportunity, Bobby has risen through the ranks to become one of the rising stars of Trap music and a hero to many who’ve watched him blossom and grow. One of the most fascinating looks at his start is the mini-doc A Day In The Bricks: The Bobby Fishscale Story which had me captivated from start to finish.\n\nAccording to music industry history, things kicked off for Bobby in 2019 with his track Hov Flow that sampled Jay-Z and Eminem’s “Renegade” beat. He then followed that smash with his mixtape Big Fish and a bidding war ensued…welp, we know who won…Roc Nation! In my humble opinion, Roc Nation isn’t the only one who won because this artist is a genuine bard of the streets with wordplay and storytelling that celebrates the best parts of Hip Hop delivered with a uniquely southern outlook. His connection with real life and his ability to translate that into his music puts him in a class of very special artist.\n\nSince then Bobby’s had several impactful releases including his debut EP The Last Re-Up and mixtapes Super Fishy, and Da Relapse with each release a benchmark in the growth of his sound and burgeoning career. Most recently, he dropped an EP entitled The Evolution which he tells us is a complete wrap up of his beginnings until now, exhibiting his growth and establishment as a major force in the music business. It’s also a celebration of the journey for which he indicates he’s very grateful as to how everything has turned out thus far. If I had to pick a favorite, it would be Own Eyes Featuring Mozzy and Ink…this joint proved to me he’s got what it takes to cross generational lines and hit some points that will move just about anyone. I think we’ll be talking about Bobby Fishscale for years to come.\n\nAhead of The Evolution drop, I had a chance to get Bobby Fishscale on the line for what rapidly elevated from an interview to a conversation, which in my book as a journalist, is the best thing to have with a personality, when the ice breaks and we can get down to the nitty gritty as people it brings so much more value to the interaction. Tune in and let us know what you think!\n\nKeep up with all things Bobby Fishscale\n\nInstagram: @bobbyfishscale\n\nTwitter: @bobbyfishscale\n\nWebsite: https://www.rocnation.com/music/bobby-fishscale/\n\nTweet\n\nAbout the Author\n\nDr. Jerry Doby Editor-in-Chief of The Hype Magazine, Media and SEO Consultant, Journalist, Ph.D. and retired combat vet. 2023 recipient of The President's Lifetime Achievement Award.
