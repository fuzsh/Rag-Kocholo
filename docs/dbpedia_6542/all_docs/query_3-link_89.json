        "text": "I love to see when others give back, and Jay-Z is doing just that. He recently awarded a $40k scholarship to a Roc Nation student.\n\nThe student’s name is Samantha Samaka. Let me give you a little back story. If you remember, back in 2020, Jay-Z teamed up with Long Island University to launch the Roc Nation School of Music, Sports, & Entertainment. Samantha is a student there. This is huge and she took to Twitter to show how grateful she was.\n\nShe even shared her award letter with the world. Jay-Z shared his thoughts on this scholarship. “We’re excited that the Roc Nation School of Music, Sports & Entertainment will provide unique insight, knowledge, and experiences for students and introduce the world to the next generation of unmatched talent.” Congrats to Samantha.\n\nWhether it's radio or TV, there is someone needed who can add the bang for the buck! Vonyetta is double that bang. Having held the spot as the #1 midday personality in the Charlotte market landed her awards for “Favorite Midday Personality” in 2014 and “Best Midday Show” in 2016 for the “Best In The City Awards.” Besides spending time with family, Vonyetta enjoys writing about things happening in the black community of Charlotte. From things going on in your neighborhoods to HBCU news, she keeps listeners engaged and informed."
