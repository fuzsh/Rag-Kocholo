        "text": "Roc Nation is making a significant investment in the future of underprivileged youth.\n\nAccording to a press release, Roc Nation announced on Friday its plans to launch a new educational campaign in Philadelphia. The initiative aims to secure $300 million worth of scholarships for low-income K-12 students to attend various private schools.\n\n“We have enjoyed such a special connection with Philadelphians, so we’ve made it our mission to invest in the long-term success of the city’s changemakers,” said Dania Diaz, Roc Nation Managing Director of Philanthropy. “Impact starts with the students and with awareness. We want to empower the youth and families with the knowledge to pursue their scholastic dreams, make their voices heard, and become the leaders of tomorrow.”\n\nTo be eligible for the campaign, students must belong to a household with an income not exceeding 250% of the federal poverty line, which is currently $75,000 for a family of four. Scholarship amounts will vary based on eligibility, ranging from $2,500 for half-day kindergarten students, $5,000 for grades K-8, $10,000 for grades 9-12, and $15,000 for students with special needs.\n\nIn addition to providing scholarships, Roc Nation will host a series of events throughout the greater Philadelphia area from June 10-21 to educate the public about the Pennsylvania Award for Student Success (PASS), a Senate Bill aimed at increasing educational opportunities for underprivileged youth attending the state’s lowest-performing public schools.\n\nRoc Nation has long maintained a strong connection with Philadelphia. Over the past five years, the entertainment company has partnered with the city’s REFORM Alliance, a non-profit dedicated to reforming parole, probation, and sentencing in the U.S., to advocate for changes in Philadelphia’s criminal justice system."
