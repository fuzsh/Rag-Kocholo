        "text": "NEW YORK, NY (March 24, 2022) – Today, TIME Studios and Roc Nation announced a partnership to produce an upcoming, multi-part documentary series on GRAMMY® award-winning musician, entrepreneur and philanthropist Megan Thee Stallion that will be directed by Nneka Onuorah.\n\nThe documentary will provide viewers with an intimate perspective into Megan’s life and career. From delving into Megan’s upbringing in Texas to chronicling key milestones in her career, the project will shed light on the many facets of Houston native’s multilayered personality.\n\n“We are thrilled to be able to work with Roc Nation to share Megan’s story with the world. Millions of people are familiar with her as an entertainer, but this series will give her a chance to share her truth as never before,” said TIME Studios Co-Head of Documentary Loren Hammonds. “Her story is a powerful one, and the accomplishments that she continues to achieve are remarkable. We feel lucky to have this opportunity to capture her at a crucial moment in her life and career, as she continues to grow exponentially in both her artistry and global impact.”\n\n“Megan has quickly blossomed into one of the pre-eminent entertainers in the world and it’s a testament to her perseverance, resilience and professionalism,” Roc Nation CEO Desiree Perez said. “Her journey is inspirational and we’re proud to have partnered with TIME Studios to highlight her personal and professional trajectory over the years. Our hope is that this documentary will inspire viewers to stay the course and pursue their passions through the ups and downs.”\n\nWith a mix of rare archival footage and fresh verité video, the documentary will highlight Megan’s rise from viral freestyling phenom to iconic cultural powerhouse. Beyond amplifying the Houston native’s journey to success, the project will also touch on how Megan overcame various personal hurdles to thrive in her professional career.\n\nPrior to partnering with Roc Nation on the documentary, TIME previously highlighted Megan in 2020 with her inclusion on TIME 100, the iconic annual list of the most influential people in the world. Now, with Onurorah (HBO’s The Legend of the Underground) at the helm, the documentary will deliver a fresh look at Megan’s swift trajectory.\n\nTIME Studios has become a prolific voice in the music and cultural icon documentary space with the Netflix and theatrical release of the critically-acclaimed jeen-yuhs: A Kanye Trilogy.
