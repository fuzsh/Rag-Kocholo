        "text": "Jay-Z: Roc Nation Responds To New Album Rumors\n\nJay-Z’s label Roc Nation is responding to rumors that he is dropping a new album. Hidji, a video director, posted a photo of a slate marked “JAY Z – 2024 ALBUM” along with a text message exchange.\n\n“Shooting today,” one message reads followed by “wya,” which is short for “where you at.”\n\nThe response whose identity has not been revealed asks, ” I’m home bro who you shooting bro??”\n\nHidji responds, “Jay Z.”\n\nHowever, according to Roc Nation, which Jay founded in 2008, responded to the viral message.\n\n“That’s news to us,” they wrote back to a retweet of the allegations.\n\nJay-Z Sparks New Album Rumors\n\nThis is not the first time recently that there have been rumors that Jay-Z might drop a new project.\n\nBack in November, according to People, Jay’s Brooklyn Public Library exhibit, titled The Book Of Hov, contains a trophy case that highlights the iconic rapper’s 13 studio albums. However, a 14th case has been added, and it is blank. That led fans to believe that a new album is underway.\n\nHis last solo album was 2017’s 4:44. It featured guest appearances from Beyoncė, his mother, Gloria Carter, Blue Ivy, Frank Ocean, Damian Marley, and James Blake. The album was nominated for eight Grammys, including Best Rap Album and Album Of The Year, at the 60th Annual Grammy Awards. The title track was nominated for Best Rap Performance and Song Of The Year, with songs “Family Feud” (Best Rap/Sung Performance) and “The Story of O.J.” (Best Music Video, Best Rap Song, Record Of The Year) being nominated in their respective categories. While being nominated for eight Grammys, Jay did not walk out with any trophies that night. He later touched on the topic on”Apes—” with Beyoncé.\n\n“Tell the Grammys f— that 0-for-8 s— / Have you ever seen the crowd going apes—,” he raps on the track. Coincidentally, despite Jay calling out the Grammys, the song scored a nomination for Best Music Video, and Jay and Beyoncé’s joint album Everything Is Love won Best Urban Contemporary Album at the 61st Annual Grammy Awards.\n\nJay-Z: The Businesses That Made His Billion-Dollar Empire\n\nAutumn Hawkins is the National Hip-Hop and R&B writer for Beasley Media, currently residing in New Jersey. Prior to working at Beasley Media, she was in broadcast news as an entertainment producer. When she's not impatiently waiting for Beyoncé to drop new music, she is reading, shopping, or planning a vacation."
