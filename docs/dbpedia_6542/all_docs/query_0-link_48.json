        "text": "Roc Nation and S10 Entertainment & Media have announced a creative partnership. The two companies will team up on management, record label, and publishing ventures for what executives call an “expanded shared vision for creatives.”\n\nRoc Nation was founded in 2008 and boasts an impressive roster boasting Rihanna, J. Cole, Big Sean and more. S10 Entertainment & Media, founded by 26-year-old Brandon Silverstein, is a full-service company with signees including Fifth Harmony’s Normani Kordei Hamilton, or Normani as she is known in her solo ventures, and Britain’s rising singer-songwriter Jacob Banks.\n\n“Brandon has a distinct creative vision and passion for music and exploring all aspects of creative expression, which reflects our Roc Nation philosophy,” says Roc Nation CEO Jay Brown.\n\n“Partnering with Roc Nation while aligning with two of my major influences Jay Brown and JAY-Z is the perfect situation for S10,” Silverstein adds. “We look forward to what tomorrow brings. It all comes down to the music. Great music leads to great things.”"
