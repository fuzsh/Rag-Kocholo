        "text": "Desiree Perez, a CEO running a New York City-based business enterprise Roc Nation, started as an agency for athletes and artists.\n\nRoc Nations features imminent stars of music, sports, and film industries.\n\nDesiree became very famous when controversy immerged between the Roc Nation and the former US president Mr. Donald Trump. Read Variety for more details.\n\nPerez founded the company along with Shawn Carter “Jay-Z” and was the Chief Operating Officer between 2009 and 2019.\n\nShe was appointed to her current position in 2019, co-founding the company with Shawn “Jay-Z” Carter.\n\nPerez was born in New York City to Cuban immigrants’ families.\n\nShe has 15 years of decadent experience managing nightclubs.\n\nPerez gained a diverse skill set in that role, including financial oversight and artist acquisition.\n\nThe two started a business partnership that continues to this very day.\n\nJay-Z was booked for an engagement later in her life.\n\nDesiree Perez’s Roc Nation responsibilities include short-term and long-term strategic initiatives.\n\nShe assesses the feasibility and viability of new verticals, ventures, or targeted projects.\n\nShe ensures that the organization’s current endeavors are still on track.\n\nShe also ensures that Roc Nation’s athletes and artists receive the best representation.\n\nDesiree Perez’s natural ability to bring people together has enabled her to negotiate all major Roc Nation deals over the past decade.\n\nHighlights include Jay-Z’s $200 million global tour deal with Live Nation and Rihanna’s lucrative sponsorship deals with Samsung and PUMA.\n\nPerez was also instrumental in executing significant events like Jay-Z’s “Made in America,” which celebrated its 10th year in 2021.\n\nPerez maintains a “big picture” view, but she also oversees the execution of each significant undertaking.\n\nDesiree Perez is responsible for Team Roc, the company’s philanthropic arm.\n\nShe is a leader on social justice issues, such as prison reform or expanded opportunities for minorities.\n\nThese causes are also crucial to her in her personal life.\n\nPerez believes that Roc Nation’s priorities reflect the same goals and motivations of many of its athletes, artists, and community members.\n\nPerez is optimistic that the company’s vast resources, global reach, and impressive platform will bring about the change she desires.\n\nDesiree Perez is looking forward to the future today.\n\nShe is excited to continue helping the multifaceted Roc Nation organization make its mark worldwide.\n\nWhat is the story of Roc Nation?\n\nJay-Z had an idea back in 2009.\n\nJay-Z was motivated to help athletes and artists build their careers and wanted to do so in a new way.\n\nI saw his vision, and we created Roc Nation together.\n\nThe company has expanded to many other areas of influence since then.\n\nHow do you stay productive?\n\nThere is no typical day for me because everyone is unique.\n\nI am always available to speak with both inside and outside partners. I also attend many meetings.\n\nAs I want to see Roc Nation grow, I make sure that I have time each day for strategic thinking.\n\nJay-Z’s vision is always my guide, and I seek out opportunities in line with it.\n\nAt the same, I am always looking for areas that need to be changed.\n\nI consider both short-term as well as long-term goals.\n\nI do how we can best use our resources to achieve those goals.\n\nTime management is essential when managing so many priorities and projects.\n\nI have a system that helps me stay on top of all my tasks.\n\n​How do you bring ideas to life?​\n\nIt takes a lot of teamwork to bring an idea to fruition.\n\nWe have a great team at Roc Nation. Each person has talents and skills, but all of us are focused on the same goal.\n\nWe begin by looking at the origin of the idea.\n\nWe discuss how it can be made possible and who will benefit from it.\n\nOnce Roc Nation accepts the concept, the team gets to work and executes it.\n\nWhat’s your favorite trend?\n\nSocial media is fascinating. It’s incredible at connecting people in many different ways.\n\nSocial media allows people to share and communicate with one another.\n\nSocial media can also be used to spread the word to the world when needed quickly.\n\nIn 2020, social media increased attention to significant social justice reforms.\n\nThis was a crucial time for this new method of communication to succeed.\n\n​What habits make you productive?\n\nIt is hard to manage so many projects at once.\n\nI have my system, and I adhere to it regardless of what.\n\nI incorporate new tasks into my flow when they arise.\n\nWhat’s your advice for the Noob?\n\nYou tend to believe you know everything when you are young.\n\nYou don’t want it to happen when someone suggests improving the process or achieving a better result.\n\nOver the years, I’ve learned that it is often a good idea to listen to others.\n\nSometimes you discover that they have a better method.\n\nIt isn’t brilliant to believe you know everything better than everyone else.\n\nTherefore, listening is more important. It’s better to have someone who has worked on your project or can help you solve your problem.\n\nWhat is one thing we can all agree on?\n\nI am a morning person. I am free from distractions and can go with the flow.\n\nMy day starts early at 4:30 a.m.\n\n​What do you recommend as an entrepreneur?\n\nYou think you can remember a great idea and come back to it later.\n\nYou think you can remember everything when you manage a project.\n\nIt doesn’t work this way. It’s impossible to forget something important.\n\nThis is why I keep everything written down. I also keep lists and make more lists.\n\nIt helps me prioritize my tasks and supports all my projects on track.\n\nWhat’s your rich strategy?\n\nYou can’t be an expert on every aspect of a project or solve a problem when trying to do it all.\n\nIt is essential to seek out feedback from experts in different areas.\n\nPlace everyone in one place and provide all background information.\n\nListen to what they have to say. Then you can formulate a strategy or solve the problem. Next, take action.\n\nHow do you overcome Failure?\n\nMy nature makes me very impatient. I wouldn’t say I like waiting for things to happen or for people to complete a task.\n\nThis attitude got me in trouble in the past.\n\nNow I see that everything moves at its speed, and my impatience will not make it move faster.\n\nEverything will come together if I am patient and can be patient.\n\nWhat’s your recent best buy? ​\n\nI bought software to improve our business operations.\n\nMy favorite is computer programs that save money and make the company more efficient.\n\nI enjoy the challenge of learning new things.\n\nWhat are your favorite Softwares or Apps?\n\nExcel spreadsheets are indispensable for me to do my job.\n\nThey allow me to track expenses and plan projects.\n\nThey can also be customized to produce reports and projections.\n\nWhich book would you recommend?\n\nRichard Rothstein’s The Color of Law is a Forgotten History of how our government segregated everyone should read America.\n\nHe discusses how segregation has occurred in America due to policies of the federal, state, and local governments.\n\nThis book also provides a perspective on our criminal justice system.\n\n​What’s your favorite quote?​\n\nThis is my favorite: “Life expands according to one’s courage.”\n\nThis quote is my constant companion when I’m trying to tackle something new or going through a difficult time.\n\nI got it from Anais Nin, a writer whom I admire for her strength."
