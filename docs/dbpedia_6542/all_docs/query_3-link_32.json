        "text": "JAY-Z‘s Roc Nation has announced that they are once again giving back to the community, and this time, they’re helping out disadvantaged students in the greater Philadelphia area.\n\nBillboard is reporting that on Friday (June 7), the company announced the launch of a $300 million scholarship fund, meant to help underprivileged students in grades K-12 attend prestigious private schools in the area.\n\nRoc Nation is set to host multiple events between June 10 and June 21 to bring awareness to the scholarship fund.\n\n“We have enjoyed such a special connection with Philadelphians, so we’ve made it our mission to invest in the long-term success of the city’s changemakers,” said Roc Nation Managing Director of Philanthropy Dania Diaz in a statement to the outlet.\n\n“Impact starts with the students and with awareness,” she continued. “We want to empower the youth and families with the knowledge to pursue their scholastic dreams, make their voices heard and become the leaders of tomorrow.”\n\nIn recent years, JAY-Z has become better known for his philanthropy than for his music — and other rappers, like Ja Rule, are getting involved.\n\nLast month, the ex-Murder Inc. rapper teamed up with Hova’s REFORM Alliance to host a Mother’s Day lunch for a group of moms who are also ex-convicts.\n\nThe former Murder Inc. rapper also teamed up with Sei Less Restaurants co-founder Ivi Shano and The Ladies of Hope Ministries to put on the luncheon, which was held in New York City on May 7.\n\nJa hosted 40 previously incarcerated mothers and their children, listening to their stories about how they’ve been affected by the criminal justice system while sharing some of his own jail experiences.\n\nFootage from the event showed the Queens, New York native hugging various women and posing for photos.\n\nJa Rule also recently spoke about a mother-to-be in the form of his longtime friend and collaborator Ashanti, who is expecting a baby with Nelly.\n\nWhen asked on the Tamron Hall Show whether he was surprised by the power couple rekindling their romance following their split over a decade ago, he said: “Not really. So her and my wife, they do their ha-ha ki-ki-ing, right? And so, you can tell sometimes when women want that old thing back.”\n\n“I don’t wanna blow sis up!” he added after the crowd exploded. “But the chemistry was there. And I think for both of them, it came back quick. I think they missed each other. The way they clicked just came back so fast.”"
