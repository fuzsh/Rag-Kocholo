Brown has been named vice chairman.\n\nIn her new role, Perez will be responsible for leading and developing Roc Nation’s many verticals, which include a record label, management, publishing, film and TV, touring, philanthropy and branding, among others, according to an announcement made by the company. Brown will continue to cultivate partnerships and expand the Roc brand. Both are co-founders of the company.\n\nThe announcement comes one day after Billboard honored Perez at its annual Women In Music event as this year’s executive of the year, where Brown introduced her. During her speech, Perez thanked the business partners who helped shape her life, including the leadership of Roc Nation Jay Z, Brown, her husband and head of Roc Nation Sports Juan Perez and Roc co-founder/president of A&R Ty Ty Smith."
