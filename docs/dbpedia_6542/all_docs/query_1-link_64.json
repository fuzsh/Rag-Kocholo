        "text": "Collaboration to focus on purpose-driven initiatives and creative activation\n\nPair will also develop a player advisory group, which will give athletes a say in promotion and marketing of the competition\n\nThe new United Rugby Championship (URC) competition has entered into a strategic consulting partnership with Roc Nation, the entertainment agency founded by rapper Jay-Z.\n\nThe aim of the collaboration is to help the tournament – formerly known as the Pro14 – reach new audiences through purpose-driven initiatives and creative activation.\n\nRoc Nation will also assist in the development of a URC player advisory group, which will give the athletes an opportunity to have a say in the promotion and marketing of the game.\n\nThe partnership comes after it was announced last month that the Pro14 would become the URC, with four clubs from South Africa joining sides from Ireland, Italy, Scotland and Wales to form a 16-team competition.\n\nExpanded Pro14 to rebrand as United Rugby Championship\n\n“Roc Nation is at the cutting edge of sports, entertainment and culture, and we believe there’s no better partner to help us reach new audiences and develop new experiences for fans,” said Martin Anayi, the URC’s chief executive. “We are looking forward to this partnership helping us achieve our ambitions of becoming a strong, purpose-led league where players and fans can have a voice and an influence.”\n\nThe deal also deepens Roc Nation’s ties with rugby union, building on its existing partnerships with South Africa captain Siya Kolisi and England’s Maro Itoje.\n\nMichael Yormark, the co-chief executive of Roc Nation Unified, added: “Leveraging our subject-matter experts across our international offices we are confident that the United Rugby Championship will continue to attract some of the biggest names in world rugby with its modern and collaborative approach to player management and redefine the concept of live entertainment on-and-off the field.”\n\nIn addition to rugby union, Roc Nation is also involved in other sports such as soccer, where it works with the likes of Italian giants AC Milan and Premier League side Leeds United, as well as star players such as Romelu Lukaku and Kevin De Bruyne."
