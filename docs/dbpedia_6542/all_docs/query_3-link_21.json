        "text": "Roc Nation Formed In 2008\n\nThe event additionally serves as a platform for Roc Nation signees to boost their star power. Securing an invite to this highly-coveted gathering is an exclusive affair. It requires a personal invitation from someone associated with the label. Invitations to the brunch also bill the gathering as “a celebration of the highest elevation of self.” The result is a social ladder thinly veiled as a casual pre-Grammy party. Here, stars lavish attention on their favorite singers, athletes, and executives, while financial backers aim to align talent with their upcoming projects.\n\nA Private Residence Typically Hosts The Event\n\nThe Roc Nation brunch has occurred each February since 2011, with the exception of 2021 and 2022 due to COVID-19 safety regulations. The event typically takes place at a rotating establishment of private mansions. This includes those in Los Angeles, New York City, and Boston. The press frequently remains uninformed about the time and location of the brunch. Most individuals learn about the event from celebrities on social media. Once the invites begin flying out, the hottest influencers often share sneak-peak glimpses into their wardrobe and aesthetic before the big day.\n\nFurther, throughout the years, Roc Nation has launched partnerships with Universal Music, Three Six Zero Entertainment, and even the NFL, due in no small part to connections formed at the illustrious brunch."
