        "text": "The National Football League Players Association (NFLPA) lists Kimberly Ann Miale of Boston, Massachusetts as a certified Contract Advisor with Roc Nation Sports, a full-service sports management company founded by Shawn Carter (publicly known as \"Jay-Z\"). Miale, a graduate of the Suffolk University School of Law and a practicing attorney, was formerly a part of the football division at Madison Avenue Sports and Entertainment. A representative from Madison Avenue Sports and Entertainment told FORBES that at this time he is not in a place to comment on Miale or Roc Nation Sports.\n\nRoc Nation Sports' hiring of an NFLPA Contract Advisor does not come as a surprise. At this past weekend's Sports Lawyers Association annual conference in Atlanta, Georgia, several agents stated that they believed New York Jets rookie quarterback Geno Smith will sign with Jay-Z's Roc Nation Sports, and that the signing would be separate from Roc Nation Sports' partnership with Creative Artists Agency (CAA). The one complication is that Jay-Z is not yet certified by the NFLPA to handle team contract negotiations and Roc Nation Sports was void of any certified employees. Now it seems clear that Kimberly Miale may soon be tasked with the representation of the thirty-ninth overall pick in the 2013 NFL Draft.\n\nWhen Roc Nation Sports first announced its formation in early April, it indicated that the company had partnered with CAA Sports. The announcement was made in conjunction with the signing of Robinson Cano as a client. At the time, Michael Levin, Co-Head of CAA Sports said, \"Jay Z and his team at Roc Nation have successfully orchestrated powerful brand and business-building opportunities for their clients. We look forward to combining our wide-reaching resources on behalf of top athlete clients like Robinson Cano to help them accomplish their goals on and off the field.\"\n\nThe hiring of an NFLPA Contract Advisor may complicate the relatively newly formed partnership. In April, Jason Cole of Yahoo! Sports wrote that CAA Sports agent Ben Dogra confirmed to him that Jay-Z helped bring New York Giants wide receiver Victor Cruz to CAA. Cruz is an excellent example of how the partnership between Roc Nation Sports and CAA was likely first envisioned to operate. CAA handles the player's team contract negotiations and Roc Nation Sports works with the player for off-field opportunities. However, with Roc Nation Sports bringing a Contract Advisor in-house, will the partnership quickly lose its significance?\n\nAdditionally, Cole's article made many football agents uneasy. Contract Advisors claimed that Jay-Z was \"above the law.\" Why was it permissible for Jay-Z to associate with CAA Sports agents in the recruitment of prospective player-clients when the NFLPA's regulations explicitly say that such an action is against the Union's rules? The NFLPA justified the Victor Cruz situation by claiming that Jay-Z had a long-term friendship with Cruz and was thus exempt in that particular circumstance (even though no such exemption appears within the regulations). Though, hiring a certified Contract Advisor should not alleviate future concerns for Jay-Z when it comes to the recruitment of player-clients, including the aforementioned Geno Smith. The NFLPA's regulations do not have a carve-out for employers to be involved in the recruitment of player-clients who are represented by their certified employees. Should Geno Smith sign with Kimberly Miale, will the NFLPA scrutinize the relationship?\n\nOutside of NFLPA regulation concerns, the hiring of Miale comes with quite a bit of skepticism. Jay-Z has been meticulous in the type of athletes he has been affiliated with to date. He had appeared to only be interested in associating himself with some of the most marketable athletes in their respective sports. It is to be assumed that Jay-Z would likely have his pick at a variety of highly experienced agents for Roc Nation Sports as he begins to grow the division's team of agents certified by the various players' associations. Why then would he choose Miale, a Contract Advisor who appears to have never negotiated an active NFL player's contract, to represent his quickly growing brand? FORBES made multiple attempts to contact Miale; however, at the time of publication, has not received a response.\n\nDarren Heitner is the Founder of South Florida-based HEITNER LEGAL, Founder of Sports Agent Blog, and Professor of Sport Agency Management at Indiana University.
