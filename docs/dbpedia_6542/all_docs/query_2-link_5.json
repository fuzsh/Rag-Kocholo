With more than 30 years of experience he has proven himself to be a visionary, entrepreneur, and is responsible for building several multibillion dollar brands. Since co-founding RocNation in 2008, Jay Brown has overseen the company’s evolution from a full-service boutique to an international entertainment and cultural powerhouse. The conglomerate currently houses superstars such as Rihanna, Christina Aguilera, Big Sean, Megan Thee Stallion and Alicia Keys. The company launched its Sports division in 2013 and has since shown no signs of slowing, expanding into publishing, philanthropy, music distribution, education, and so much more. In March 2019, Shawn “JAY-Z “ Carter, Jay Brown, and Larry Marcus, co-founded Marcy Venture Partners (MVP), a venture capital firm investing in companies that embrace positive values, including sustainability, empowerment, inclusivity, accessibility, convenience, health & wellness and personal expression. Also in 2019, Jay Brown and Tyran “TyTy” Smith teamed up once more to launch their production company following the success of prior projects such as Annie and Free Angela and All Political Prisoners. Their company aims to showcase culturally relevant and thought-provoking entertainment whilst advocating for diverse cast and crew. Jay also serves on several boards, lending his expertise to organizations such as the Hammer Museum, FENTY Beauty, FENTY Skin, Savage X FENTY, BeyGood, ShawnCarter Foundation and Clara Lionel Foundation."
