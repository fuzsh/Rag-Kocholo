Roc Nation is an entertainment agency founded by Jay-Z in 2008. The company is headquartered in Manhattan, New York City and has additional offices in Los Angeles and London.

In April 2009, the Sugababes signed a contract with Roc Nation resulting in working with high profile producers, and released the group's only studio album with the label, Sweet 7. In March 2010, the Sugababes were dropped from Roc Nation after expectations were unmet of the album. [1]
