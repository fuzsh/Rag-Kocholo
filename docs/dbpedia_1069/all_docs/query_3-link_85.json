        "text": "The purpose of this special issue about relationships between word and image in modern periodicals is to promote conversations, and conversations are exactly where this special issue began. In 2018, a group of postgraduate and early-career researchers gathered in the Cadbury Research Library at the University of Birmingham, UK, for a one-day workshop on “Ways of Reading.” Inspired by Patrick Collier’s 2015 essay “What Is Modern Periodical Studies?,” we sought to create a space in which scholars could share, and test out, different approaches to the periodicals we might find in the archive.1 Bringing together art historians, literary scholars, and media and print historians, the interdisciplinary workshop was in the tradition of the humanities labs espoused by Sean Latham and Robert Scholes: “collaborative networks of researchers and institutions that lend their collective expertise to textual objects that would otherwise overwhelm single scholars.”2 Crucially, though, the event had no fixed aim or outcome. Instead, it revolved around a deceptively radical idea: it invited attendees to sit in the archives with a selection of periodicals from the collection and enjoy them. Reveling in the materiality of 100-year-old monthlies and weeklies and one-offs, scholars discussed these magazines with each other, noting the advertisements and the editorials, the cover art and the internal text, the images and the words. In the world of magazine research, it’s rare to have the opportunity to enjoy material in archives without frantically scanning for information pertinent to a particular research area or snapping photos without internalizing what’s printed on the page in front of you. [End Page iii] “Ways of Reading” was conceived of as a way of combatting the at-times isolating experience of solitary archival work; the collective experience of the workshop yielded more diverse and in-depth ways of thinking about periodicals than any individual archival trip could have produced. Art experts learned from literature specialists (and vice versa); historians shared their experiences with scholars knowledgeable about printing techniques. The loose structure allowed for lots of “geeking out”; for aimless, happy wanderings and discussions. It was a way of imitating the way in which these magazines would have been enjoyed when they were first published: a little at a time, with much page turning and picture scanning, and with a healthy dose of dialogue.\n\nOne of the periodicals selected for us that day by Head of Rare Books Martin Killeen was the first series of Form (1916–17), edited by the artist and occultist Austin O. Spare and the painter and etcher Frederick Carter, under the pseudonym Francis Marsden.3 Those participants who found themselves sitting in front of the magazine couldn’t help being intrigued, and at times baffled, by the complex array of image-text interactions found here. Faced with a double-page-spread like this in the first issue (fig. 1), how were we to read the relationship between words and images?4 Here, Leonard Inkster’s rather opaque textual meditation on truth, beauty, and man’s purpose is accompanied by two “Designs” by the magazine’s coeditor Frederick Carter (p. 16) and a “Decoration,” “Title,” and “Initials” by the draughtsman and illustrator Herbert Cole.5 Neither the text nor the images by the two artists seem to have anything in common. All have a strange, slightly mystical quality, but the textual and visual languages seem quite different."
