        "text": "THE RISE AND FALL OF ENGLISH\n\nReconstructing English as a Discipline\n\nBy Robert Scholes\n\n203 pages. Yale University Press. $20.\n\nWhat Robert Scholes proposes in his astute new book, ''The Rise and Fall of English: Reconstructing English as a Discipline,'' sounds simple enough on the face of it. He wants to revise the way English is taught in all our schools by de-emphasizing the study of literature as literature, elevating the instruction of writing and combining the two to form a discipline that would prove more useful to students going out into the world.\n\nHe writes, ''I think we may at present be too concerned with teaching the right ideas in the classroom and not concerned enough with teaching the most effective ways of speaking, listening, reading and writing.'' For ''it is impossible to deny that language and other semiotic systems and their associated media of communication have in the course of history multiplied and penetrated more and more deeply into our daily lives. We are at present, like it or not, the most mediated human beings ever to exist on this earth.'' And ''to function as a citizen of these United States one needs to be able to read, interpret and criticize texts in a wide range of modes, genres and media.''\n\nAll of which may sound unobjectionable. But it isn't, as the author himself immediately announces. A professor of humanities at Brown University and the author of ''Textual Power: Literary Theory and the Teaching of English,'' among other books, Mr. Scholes warns that his proposals risk offending everyone from professors of literature who see themselves as keepers of some sacred flame and who disdain those who teach mere composition, to ''those who want dramatic indictments and sweeping condemnations of conspiracies to betray Western Civilization as we have known it.''\n\nYet his prescriptions are necessary, he argues, because, as things now stand, the system is unreal. Those who study English are being trained for a life of leisurely contemplation of literature they can't possibly live unless perhaps they become English teachers. Those who teach English can't begin to keep up with what is being published even in highly specialized fields. ''One result of all this has been to turn us into professional hypocritics,'' he writes, hypocriticism being a word that ''acknowledges more fully than is usual the roots of hypocrite in the ancient Greek verb hypokrino, which had a set of meanings sliding from simple speech, to orating, to acting on stage, to feigning or speaking falsely.'' He adds, ''We are constantly in danger of following the same trajectory.''\n\nWhat he sets out to do in his book is first trace the rise of English studies at Yale and Brown, two American institutions that ''I happen to know well,'' he writes, and whose experiences were reflected in ''other schools, both private and public, that were established after them.'' This rise turns out to connect with the decline of the teaching of rhetoric and oratory, part of a curriculum ''designed to prepare graduates for careers in the church or for participation in civil government.''\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
