        "text": "I am an archaeologist interested in the cultural entanglements of the early modern world, material culture studies and general anthropology. I have excavated sites in the United States and the Caribbean, but my primary area of research has been in the archaeology, ethnohistory and ethnography of sub-Saharan Africa. I am particularly interested in how archaeology can help us understand the transformations that occurred in Africa during the period of the Atlantic trade. I am currently directing ongoing research projects in coastal Ghana and in Sierra Leone, including work at Elmina, the site of the first and largest European trade post established in sub-Saharan Africa, and at Bunce Island, the major center of European trade on the African coast between the Senegambia and coastal Ghana.\n\nMy principal publications on African archaeology include: \"An Archaeology of Elmina: Africans and Europeans on the Gold Coast, 1400-1900\" (Smithsonian Press, 2001, now available from \"West Africa during the Atlantic Slave Trade\" (an edited volume republished by Bloomsbury Academic, 2016). My book \"Small Worlds: Method, Meaning, and Narrative Craft in Microhistory\" (School of Advanced Research Press, 2008), co-edited with John Walton and James Brooks, brings together the work of twelve scholars from diverse disciplines to explore theoretical vantage and method in the interpretation of the past through the lens of microhistory."
