        "text": "Some beta readers state that they don't read science fiction. I assume from this that they know enough about the genre to know what is and isn't science fiction. I must read it simply because I don't know where one draws the line and even if others consider something to be science fiction it won't affect my enjoyment of a good story anyway. So, to avoid reading the \"genre\" one must have a clear idea of what it is, so can you tell me?\n\nI have tried to imagine the likely answers to this question, but they are not mine as I don't have any answer except \"Presumably I do.\" For example, I have read bad science in many stories that aren't classed as science fiction, especially in the crime and thriller genres. In an effort to twist a plot in an unexpected direction or heighten the action the writer has incorporated something that simply couldn't happen or doesn't exist. There are two distinct sides to life, that which is demonstrably provable, i.e. science, and that which isn't but is accepted on faith. In practice though most of us are obliged to take science on faith because we just can't comprehend it or haven't witnessed any proof of it. Hence it is quite acceptable for a writer to incorporate fictional science into a story provided that they don't draw attention to the fact that they are and scare off readers with an aversion to it. Personally I consider this to be dishonest or incompetent and am appalled when I find bad science in a story that I do not expect to contain any and I feel misled by the declared genre. In contrast I am happy to consider reading any story which is presented honestly as what it is. To be honest most stories can only be described as unqualified \"fiction\". They will most likely be thrilling, romantic, scientific and quite possibly criminal in parts, but none of these characteristics may be clearly sufficient to define the genre and there is usually a disclaimer to say that a story is intended to be entirely fictional, sometimes with specifically defined exceptions.\n\nI can understand that a reader might consider a story to be science fiction if it was necessary to understand science that was not everyday experience to appreciate it, regardless of whether that science was itself fact or fiction. That last point is the distinction between \"hard\" and \"soft\" science fiction as I understand the terms, by the way. However, any good story with a modicum of uncommon science in it will explain it as far as is necessary within itself. If a victim in a crime story is poisoned with arsenic or antimony then the reader only needs to know how such poisons would be administered and their effects and how quickly they occur to satisfy the context. If a rare drug from an animal or plant is used, does it really matter to the reader whether the source is factual or fictional though? Hopefully crime stories are not intended to be tutorials on how to commit crimes. In my own field of computer technology I hope that no writer comes too close to describing exactly how to hack into computer networks, or at least if they do that their facts are safely far enough out of date to cause no harm. One would hope that in general fictional literature contains only effectively harmless, if not actually fictional, information about antisocial activities like poisoning, bomb-making and computer hacking. Those of us who know much about such specific subjects should be grateful rather than critical when we see inaccuracies concerning them in stories.\n\nSo, in much of literature there is probably a modicum of bad or outdated science or some that may need to be explained on the spot, but none of these particularly define the genre of a work as such. Personally I object to readers describing my one novel as science fiction as the majority of my effort went into all the other aspects of it and the fictional aspects of the science were there simply to create the circumstances under which conventional human behaviour could be explored more fully than usual. For example, stories about androids and thinking machines in general fundamentally question what it means to be human, not an android. Thinking machines are by default psychopaths, but many readers who would avoid science fiction would be happy to read stories involving human psychopaths, who are inevitably pale imitations of the real thing. If you want to experience real psychopaths try walking along a totally automated car production line. No matter how extreme a psychopath is depicted as being, machines feature in the role far more often in stories.\n\nAnyway, that's as much as I currently have time to write on this subject for now, but perhaps you get my point, that one cannot simply say that one does not read \"science fiction\" or \"romance\" or any other \"genre\", whatever that word means, without identifying exactly what it is about any story that one chooses not to read.\n\nScience-Fiction is a broad and wide ranging genre that has spawned many sub-genres. The \"Official\" definition of Sci-fi is -\n\nscience fiction\n\nnoun\n\nFiction based on imagined future scientific or technological advances and major social or environmental changes, frequently portraying space or time travel and life on other planets.\n\nBut authors have added to this definition over the years -\n\nHugo Gernsback. 1926. \"By 'scientifiction' I mean the Jules Verne, H. G. Wells and Edgar Allan Poe type of story—a charming romance intermingled with scientific fact and prophetic vision... Not only do these amazing tales make tremendously interesting reading—they are always instructive. They supply knowledge... in a very palatable form... New adventures pictured for us in the scientifiction of today are not at all impossible of realization tomorrow... Many great science stories destined to be of historical interest are still to be written... Posterity will point to them as having blazed a new trail, not only in literature and fiction, but progress as well.\"\n\nJ. O. Bailey. 1947. \"A piece of scientific fiction is a narrative of an imaginary invention or discovery in the natural sciences and consequent adventures and experiences... It must be a scientific discovery—something that the author at least rationalizes as possible to science.\"\n\nRobert A. Heinlein. 1947. \"Let's gather up the bits and pieces and define the Simon-pure science fiction story: 1. The conditions must be, in some respect, different from here-and-now, although the difference may lie only in an invention made in the course of the story. 2. The new conditions must be an essential part of the story. 3. The problem itself—the \"plot\"—must be a human problem. 4. The human problem must be one which is created by, or indispensably affected by, the new conditions. 5. And lastly, no established fact shall be violated, and, furthermore, when the story requires that a theory contrary to present accepted theory be used, the new theory should be rendered reasonably plausible and it must include and explain established facts as satisfactorily as the one the author saw fit to junk. It may be far-fetched, it may seem fantastic, but it must not be at variance with observed facts, i.e., if you are going to assume that the human race descended from Martians, then you've got to explain our apparent close relationship to terrestrial anthropoid apes as well.\"\n\nJohn W. Campbell, Jr.. 1947. \"To be science fiction, not fantasy, an honest effort at prophetic extrapolation from the known must be made.\"\n\n―. \"Scientific methodology involves the proposition that a well-constructed theory will not only explain every known phenomenon, but will also predict new and still undiscovered phenomena. Science-fiction tries to do much the same—and write up, in story form, what the results look like when applied not only to machines, but to human society as well.\"\n\nDamon Knight. 1952. At the start of a series of book review columns, Knight stated the following as one of his assumptions: \"That the term 'science fiction' is a misnomer, that trying to get two enthusiasts to agree on a definition of it leads only to bloody knuckles; that better labels have been devised (Heinlein's suggestion, 'speculative fiction', is the best, I think), but that we're stuck with this one; and that it will do us no particular harm if we remember that, like 'The Saturday Evening Post', it means what we point to when we say it.\" This definition is now usually seen in abbreviated form as \"Science fiction is [or means] what we point to when we say it.\"\n\nTheodore Sturgeon. 1952. \"A science fiction story is a story built around human beings, with a human problem, and a human solution, which would not have happened at all without its scientific content.\"\n\nBasil Davenport. 1955. \"Science fiction is fiction based upon some imagined development of science, or upon the extrapolation of a tendency in society.\"[\n\nEdmund Crispin. 1955. A science fiction story \"is one that presupposes a technology, or an effect of technology, or a disturbance in the natural order, such as humanity, up to the time of writing, has not in actual fact experienced.\"\n\nRobert A. Heinlein. 1959. \"Realistic speculation about possible future events, based solidly on adequate knowledge of the real world, past and present, and on a thorough understanding of the nature and significance of the scientific method. To make this definition cover all science fiction (instead of 'almost all') it is necessary only to strike out the word 'future'.\n\nKingsley Amis. 1960. \"Science fiction is that class of prose narrative treating of a situation that could not arise in the world we know, but which is hypothesized on the basis of some innovation in science or technology, or pseudo-science or pseudo-technology, whether human or extra-terrestrial in origin.\"\n\nJames Blish. 1960 or 1964. Science fantasy is \"a kind of hybrid in which plausibility is specifically invoked for most of the story, but may be cast aside in patches at the author's whim and according to no visible system or principle.\"\n\nRod Serling. 1962. \"Fantasy is the impossible made probable. Science Fiction is the improbable made possible.\"\n\nJudith Merril. 1966. \"Speculative fiction: stories whose objective is to explore, to discover, to learn, by means of projection, extrapolation, analogue, hypothesis-and-paper-experimentation, something about the nature of the universe, of man, or 'reality'... I use the term 'speculative fiction' here specifically to describe the mode which makes use of the traditional 'scientific method' (observation, hypothesis, experiment) to examine some postulated approximation of reality, by introducing a given set of changes—imaginary or inventive—into the common background of 'known facts', creating an environment in which the responses and perceptions of the characters will reveal something about the inventions, the characters, or both\".\n\nDarko Suvin. 1972. Science fiction is \"a literary genre whose necessary and sufficient conditions are the presence and interaction of estrangement and cognition, and whose main formal device is an imaginative framework alternative to the author's empirical environment.\"\n\nThomas M. Disch. 1973. \"The basic premise of all s-f—that Absolutely Anything Can Happen and Should—has never been so handsomely and hilariously realized as in An Alien Heat.\" (Cover blurb for the 1973 Harper and Row edition of the novel by Michael Moorcock).\n\nBrian Aldiss. 1973. \"Science fiction is the search for a definition of man and his status in the universe which will stand in our advanced but confused state of knowledge (science), and is characteristically cast in the Gothic or post-Gothic mould\". Revised 1986. \"a definition of mankind...\", \"...post-Gothic mode\".\n\nRay Bradbury. 1974. Science fiction is \"the one field that reached out and embraced every sector of the human imagination, every endeavor, every idea, every technological development, and every dream.\" \"I called us a nation of Ardent Blasphemers. We ran about measuring not only how things were but how they ought to be. ... We Americans are better than we hope and worse than we think, which is to say, we are the most paradoxical of all of the paradoxical nations in time. Which is what science fiction is all about. For science fiction runs out with tapes to measure Now against Then against Tomorrow Breakfast. It triangulates mankind amongst these geometrical threads, praising him, warning him.\" \"For, above all, science fiction, as far back as Plato trying to figure out a proper society, has always been a fable teacher of morality...There is no large problem in the world this afternoon that is not a science-fictional problem.\" \"Science fiction then is the fiction of revolutions. Revolutions in time, space, medicine, travel, and thought...Above all, science fiction is the fiction of warm-blooded human men and women sometimes elevated and sometimes crushed by their machines.\" \"So science fiction, we now see, is interested in more than sciences, more than machines. That more is always men and women and children themselves, how they behave, how they hope to behave. Science fiction is apprehensive of future modes of behavior as well as future constructions of metal.\" \"Science fiction guesses at sciences before they are sprung out of the brows of thinking men. More, the authors in the field try to guess at machines which are the fruit of these sciences. Then we try to guess at how mankind will react to these machines, how use them, how grow with them, how be destroyed by them. All, all of it fantastic.\"\n\nDavid Ketterer. 1974. \"Philosophically-oriented science fiction, extrapolating on what we know in the context of our vaster ignorance, comes up with a startling donnée, or rationale, that puts humanity in a radically new perspective.\"\n\nNorman Spinrad. 1974. \"Science fiction is anything published as science fiction.\"\n\nIsaac Asimov. 1975. \"Science fiction can be defined as that branch of literature which deals with the reaction of human beings to changes in science and technology.\"\n\nRobert Scholes. 1975. Fabulation is \"fiction that offers us a world clearly and radically discontinuous from the one we know, yet returns to confront that known world in some cognitive way.\"\n\n―. 1975. In structural fabulation, \"the tradition of speculative fiction is modified by an awareness of the universe as a system of systems, a structure of structures, and the insights of the past century of science are accepted as fictional points of departure. Yet structural fabulation is neither scientific in its methods nor a substitute for actual science. It is a fictional exploration of human situations made perceptible by the implications of recent science. Its favourite themes involve the impact of developments or revelations derived from the human or physical sciences upon the people who must live with those revelations or developments.\"\n\nEric Rabkin. 1977. \"...science fiction could begin to exist as a literary form only when a different future became conceivable by human beings―specifically a future in which new knowledge, new discoveries, new adventures, new mutations, would make life radically different from the familiar patterns of the past and present.\" \"The worlds of Dante and Milton remain separate from science fiction because they are constructed on a plan derived from religious tradition rather than scientific speculation or imagination based, however loosely, on science.\"\n\nJames Gunn. 1977. \"Science Fiction is the branch of literature that deals with the effects of change on people in the real world as it can be projected into the past, the future, or to distant places. It often concerns itself with scientific or technological change, and it usually involves matters whose importance is greater than the individual or the community; often civilization or the race itself is in danger.\"\n\nDarko Suvin. 1979. \"SF is distinguished by the narrative dominance or hegemony of a fictional \"novum\" (novelty, innovation) validated by cognitive logic.\"\n\nPatrick Parrinder. 1980. \"'Hard' SF is related to 'hard facts' and also to the 'hard' or engineering sciences. It does not necessarily entail realistic speculation about a future world, though its bias is undoubtedly realistic. Rather, this is the sort of SF that most appeals to scientists themselves—and is often written by them. The typical 'hard' SF writer looks for new and unfamiliar scientific theories and discoveries which could provide the occasion for a story, and, at its more didactic extreme, the story is only a framework for introducing the scientific concept to the reader.\"\n\n―. 1980. \"In 'space opera' (the analogy is with the Western 'horse opera' rather than the 'soap opera') the reverse [Parrinder is referring to his definition of \"hard sf\"] is true; a melodramatic adventure-fantasy involving stock themes and settings is evolved on the flimsiest scientific basis.\"\n\nDavid Pringle. 1985. \"Science fiction is a form of fantastic fiction which exploits the imaginative perspectives of modern science\".\n\nKim Stanley Robinson. 1987. Sf is \"an historical literature... In every sf narrative, there is an explicit or implicit fictional history that connects the period depicted to our present moment, or to some moment in our past.\"\n\nChristopher Evans. 1988. \"Perhaps the crispest definition is that science fiction is a literature of 'what if?' What if we could travel in time? What if we were living on other planets? What if we made contact with alien races? And so on. The starting point is that the writer supposes things are different from how we know them to be.\"\n\nIsaac Asimov. 1990. \"'[H]ard science fiction' [is] stories that feature authentic scientific knowledge and depend upon it for plot development and plot resolution.\"\n\nArthur C. Clarke. 2000. \"Science fiction is something that could happen - but you usually wouldn't want it to. Fantasy is something that couldn't happen - though you often only wish that it could.\" (emphasis original)\n\nJeff Prucher. 2006. Science fiction is \"a genre (of literature, film, etc.) in which the setting differs from our own world (e.g. by the invention of new technology, through contact with aliens, by having a different history, etc.), and in which the difference is based on extrapolations made from one or more changes or suppositions; hence, such a genre in which the difference is explained (explicitly or implicitly) in scientific or rational, as opposed to supernatural, terms.\"\n\nOrson Scott Card listed five types of stories that generally fall into sci-fi. September 28, 2010 \"1. All stories set in the future, because the future can’t be known. This includes all stories speculating about future technologies, which is, for some people, the only thing that science fiction is good for. Ironically, many stories written in the 1940s and 1950s that were set in what was then the future—the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s—are no longer “futuristic.” Yet they aren’t “false,” either, because few science fiction writers pretend to be writing what will happen. Rather, they write what might happen. So those out-of-date futures, like that depicted in the novel 1984, simply shift from the “future” category to:\n\n2. All stories set in the historical past that contradict known facts of history. Within the field of science fiction, these are called “alternate world” stories. For instance, what if the Cuban Missile Crisis had led to nuclear war? What if Hitler had died in 1939? In the real world, of course, these events did not happen—so stories that take place in such false pasts are the purview of sci-fi and fantasy.\n\n3. All stories set in other worlds, because we’ve never gone there. Whether “future humans” take part in the story or not, if it isn’t Earth, it belongs to this genre.\n\n4. All stories supposedly set on Earth, but before recorded history and contradicting the known archaeological record—stories about visits from ancient aliens, or ancient civilizations that left no trace, or “lost kingdoms” surviving into modern times.\n\n5. All stories that contradict some known or supposed law of nature. Obviously, fantasy that uses magic falls into this category, but so does much sci-fi: time travel stories, for instance, or invisible \"man stories.\"\n\nAndrew Milner. 2012. Science fiction \"is a selective tradition, continuously reinvented in the present, through which the boundaries of the genre are continuously policed, challenged and disrupted, and the cultural identity of the SF community continuously established, preserved and transformed. It is thus essentially and necessarily a site of contestation.\"\n\nJohn Boyd. \"... storytelling, usually imaginative as distinct from realistic fiction, which poses the effects of current or extrapolated scientific discoveries, or a single discovery, on the behavior of individuals [or] society.\"\n\nBarry N. Malzberg. Science fiction is \"that branch of fiction that deals with the possible effects of an altered technology or social system on mankind in an imagined future, an altered present, or an alternative past.\"\n\nTom Shippey. \"Science fiction is hard to define because it is the literature of change and it changes while you are trying to define it.\"\n\nBut I am not sure that, that is what you were talking about... I think that the point the a lot of people who \"can't\" read Sci-Fi because of the lack of correct science miss a vital point - it is Science-Fiction. Not fact, or real, or having much to do with reality. It is as much a form of making stuff up as fantasy is. This is why the two genres work so well together."
