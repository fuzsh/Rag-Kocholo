        "text": "This blog has two sections. The first section is about the book I have been reading. The second section is to share an article I came across, which has practical ideas of increasing aesthetic reading in informational texts.\n\nCrafty Reading Vs. Fundamentalist Reading\n\nIn the last chapter of The Crafty Reader, Robert Scholes discusses the enemy of crafty reading–the fundamentalist way of reading. Scholes believes that the literary craft of reading is in direct conflict with fundamentalist way of reading with fundamentalist reading focusing on a fully literal way of reading texts with “a desire to get at the truth of a text” (219), whereas crafty reading allowing for more flexibility with respect to meaning and more scope for textual enjoyment. A crafty reader will allow for an ambiguity or complexity that leaves the text open to further interpretation or questioning, while the fundamentalist reader will resort to complete closure upon the text by reducing meaning to what is already known or what is already allowed to be understood by particular authority over the text (223).\n\nIn spite of the direct opposition between crafty reading and fundamentalist reading, they both care a lot about what a text really means and they both take the problem of interpretation seriously.\n\nThe rest of that chapter talks a lot about reading biblical texts. I find it very distant from my teaching practice and I had limited interest in it. In addition, due to my lack of knowledge in religious texts and religion in general, I found it very difficult to understand the examples Scholes was citing and analyzing.\n\nScholes’ conclusion seems to be that biblical text should be read as sacred rather than as literary. Using the literary, crafty approach to read biblical text would be to open it to criticism, and therefore give readers the freedom to accept or reject the values they have discovered in those texts. This is what fundamentalism cannot allow. The fundamentalist way asks readers to read the biblical texts faithfully, treat the entire text as a divine utterance (God’s words) and leaves no space for criticism.\n\nCritical reading and thinking is a highly valued skill in the 21st century; we teach our students to use a critical eye to view the world around them. Perhaps biblical text is the only field that critical reading and thinking is not encouraged. It is where some people find their spiritual support and where people seek solutions to problems in life; questioning or open interpretation in God’s words is not what can offer people comfort and strength.\n\nStrategies to Increase Aesthetic Stance When Reading Informational Texts\n\nI came across an article about Rosenblatt’s efferent/aesthetic stances and the Common Core Reading Standards and decided to include some of its key points in this blog entry.\n\nWith the Common Core Reading Standards, an increase in informational texts is encouraged. This article poses an urgent question: “As educators, how can we continue to enrich the efferent stance while allowing for the reading of information text to be more enjoyable or filled with depth, senses or feelings associated with the adoption of the aesthetic stance?\n\nThere are several helpful, already-known strategies that can conquer the challenge of increasing aesthetic reading of informational texts. The first strategy is the text-to-text, text-to-self, and text-to-world connections. By making these connections, students can relate to the target informational text in more meaningful ways.\n\nThe second strategy is the double entry diaries. These double entry diaries ask students to note a quote from the text and then follow up with an “I wonder…” statement related to that quote. This allows for students to balance the information learned from the quote with an aesthetic personal reaction or feeling to that quote.\n\nA similar strategy to the double entry diaries is called “extract–react.” Here, students extract an important quote from the text and react to it in a thoughtful way. This method can also be carried out by adopting technology, such as blogs.\n\nAnother engaging strategy to combine efferent and aesthetic reading is digital storytelling. An example of digital story-telling would be making a PowerPoint slide show of photos, which represent historical events, figures or issues being discussed in the informational text.\n\nA more complicated strategy would be to adapt the text to a form of a Reader’s Theatre. Students will act out the information in the text though a theatrical manner.\n\nThe last simple strategy the article mentions is the 3-2-1 strategy. Here, students create a chart listing three things the discovered (efferent), two things they find interesting (aesthetic), and one questions they will have (efferent or aesthetic).\n\nI find this list of strategies very helpful and easy to use in the reading classroom. The Reader’s Theatre seems to be the most complicated and time-consuming activity to do with students and it may not work with all texts. But the rest of the strategies can apply to any informational text and increase students’ aesthetic experience with reading the text.\n\nPARENTI, M. (2013). Driving the Reading Act: Shifting Between the Aesthetic and Efferent Stance When Approaching Informational Text in the Common Core Era. California Reader, 46(4), 16-20.\n\nAs Robert Scholes concludes his essays on the craft of reading, he urges colleges and universities to start taking reading seriously by putting the craft of reading at the center of their English curriculum. To people who question the importance of college reading curriculum including policy makers and fellow educators, Scholes’ proposal seems unreasonable: don’t college students already know how to read? Should they spend their time reading to learn rather than learning to read?\n\nThe conception that “first you learn to read and then you read to learn” is an illusion. Students do not automatically evolve into more proficient readers as they advance through school. It is wrong to assume that as long as students acquire certain reading skills, they will be able to read anything successfully. When it comes to college-level text, the literacy demands are more challenging and students do need to be prepared for the challenge.\n\nScholes’ argument is very relevant to me as a developmental reading instructor . As the debate on developmental reading, and developmental education in general has intensified nationwide, critics are constantly asking why money and resources are spent on teaching students how to read in college.\n\nTo address the critics’ question, two things need to be considered. First of all, historically, developmental reading is not new. There is a rich history of post-secondary literacy instruction in the U.S. Second, statistics show that reading instruction in highly necessary. I just read a white paper on developmental reading and learned the following statistics: “more than 75% of community-college students—and more than 50% of four-year college students—are “non-proficient” in college-level document and prose literacy abilities. In addition, the ACT college entrance test indicated that about half of the incoming students were prepared for the reading requirements of a typical first-year college course.” The numbers are alarming even though they cannot reflect the entire picture of reading education.\n\nReading instruction is appropriate at every educational level. There is a clear need for literacy instruction and support at the post-secondary level. Unfortunately, developmental reading courses have been most effective in preparing students to become proficient college readers. Just speaking from my own experience, our developmental reading courses have poor retention rate and success rate (around 50-60%). In the long run, the effects of developmental reading courses on students who have taken them have not been positively confirmed.\n\nScholes did not talk about how the craft of reading should not or should be taught. As an instructor who is in a college reading classroom every day, I know that the current instructional model is not working well, which teaches discrete skills, such as determining main ideas, recognizing patterns of organization, taking notes, annotating, identifying purpose and tone. etc. There are several problems with this skill-based model: students are reading selections of text out of their contexts; students don’t see the connections between all the skills and don’t know how to use them as a system; students don’t see the real-life application of these reading skills and therefore have low motivation for learning. Going back to Rosenbaltt’s theory, this skill-based model pushes students to read texts from a merely efferent stance. Students do not get to enjoy reading and they are more likely to end up hating reading, especially academic reading that is already dry and challenging.\n\nSo, how the craft of reading should be taught? There are no definite answers yet, but there have been innovated instructional models, which I will discuss in my next blog.\n\nReading remains “incomplete” unless it is absorbed and transformed in the thoughts and deeds of readers.- Robert Scholes\n\nOne of my relatives went to a Common Core meeting at her children’s elementary school and she came back angry and frustrated. She felt that the Common Core Standards were going to dumb down the kids rather than challenge them. I was curious why she felt that way, so I decided to take another look at the Common Core Reading Standards and compare them to Robert Scholes’ theory of reading.\n\nI found a book called Pathways to the Common Core, which explains and analyzes the common core in details. Some sporadic readings of sections of the book have helped me understand the common core a lot better.\n\nIn the book, the overview of the reading standards points out two notable aspects. First, readings skills are organized into a kind of a grid, which offers a set of skills for readers of every age, and for both fictional and informational texts. That is an advantage of the CCRS compared to other standards: most standards try to be all things to all people. They end up with so many criteria that it is difficult to decide what skills are important; CCRS, on the other hand, emphasize the same set of reading skills for all grade levels and for all genres of texts. Students can carry this single set of skills up grade levels and across texts. Another notable aspect of the CCRS is that the set of reading skills require close reading, deep comprehension and high-level thinking. Students, from the lowest grade to the highest grade, are constantly challenged to comprehend, analyze, evaluate, categorize, synthesize, etc, all of which are high-level thinking skills based on Blooms Taxonomy.\n\nTo me, the CCRS are very similar to the skills I am teaching in my college reading courses because we consider these skills essential for college study. CCRS are pushing for a kind of highly academic reading that rewards poring over language, structure, and deciphering internal meaning. The book speculates that CCRS could possibly be created backward from these college reading skills and down to a progression of skills that start at the kindergarten age. In summary, academic reading skills seem to be what CCRS value.\n\nWhat don’t CCRS value? The concept of close reading and deep comprehension is not a new one. New Criticism, developed in the 1920s, urged readers to put aside their own perspectives and experiences and to focus on comprehension within the text and to dig the meaning out of the text. Common Core Reading Standards mark a return to the ideas of New Criticism.\n\nRobert Scholes’s theory of reading provides a contrast to New Criticism’s notion of extracting meaning solely from words, sentences and structures. Instead, he emphasized the role of reader in the reading event and believed that meaning was created between the text and the reader’s experiences and knowledge. As he remarks, ” Reading remains “incomplete unless it is absorbed and transformed in the thoughts and deeds of readers.” In CCRS, we do not see phrases such as access prior knowledge, activate schema, make text-to-self connection, explore personal responses, relate to your own life, state your personal opinion, etc. Therefore, CCRS deemphasize reading as a personal and subjective act; CCRS emphasize reading as textual analysis.\n\nNow going back to my relative’s comment about CCS dumbing down students, I disagree with her. I think CCRS are challenging, at least they meant to challenge students to be able to read complex texts and develop elite college study skills. Will CCRS produce good and effective readers in reality? I guess we have to wait and see.\n\nReference:\n\nCalkins, L., Ehrenworth, M., & Lehman, C. (2012). Pathways to common core. Portsmouth, NH: Heinemann. Retrieved from http://www.heinemann.com/shared/onlineresources/e04355/pathwaystoccch1re.pdf\n\nIn Chapter Four of the Crafty Reader, Robert Scholes examines the genre of private-eye novels and discusses how this genre came into existence and rose to a position of canonicity in American literature. The author did a wonderful job explaining the characteristics of the private-eye novel genre and recounting the development of this genre by citing many examples from classical detective literature. However, I don’t feel it is very relevant to my teaching practice or my research interest. If there is one thing I can take away from reading that chapter, it would be the idea of situating and placing a text.\n\nScholes states that the craft of reading is a set of methods or practices that can be learned, a skill that can be improved by anyone willing to make an effort, although it can never be entirely mastered by any person, however gifted and committed. “A large part of the craft of reading is the ability to ‘place’ or ‘situate’ any particular text …To situate a text, …is to locate it in time and place, to know where it is coming from” (page 139). In other words, to situate a text means to know the social, cultural, and historical context of a particular text . The skill of situating a text is crucial to the comprehension of the text because it provides the reader with necessary background information related to the text. To read a text out of its context is to add an extra level of difficulty into the reading process and could also lead to misinterpretation of the text.\n\nThe author recalls a story from his teaching experience to further illustrate the importance of situating a text. His department gave an exam to a large group of students–a test on which students were asked to respond critically to a variety of poems, without any background information on any of those poems at all: just the poems, minus the names of their authors. One students was very severe on one of those poems, condemning it for using an affected poetic style and completely unsuitable for a modern poet. It turned out that the poem was written by William Shakespeare. Having read the poem as a modern poem, the student was absolutely right in the way that he found the it affected and inauthentic. If the student had read it as a 16th century sonnet, the student would probably find it typical and a strong example of the type. This is a problem with situating the text.\n\nI happen to have an example from my own teaching experience on this issue. My college reading course students have been assigned to read a history textbook excerpt on the 60s generation. When I was preparing for this lesson, I had difficulty in understanding parts of the text as it was so historically situated and without the necessary background knowledge, the text created too many information gaps in my mind. So, in preparing my students to read the text, I put together a powerpoint presentation on the historical, political, and social situations of the 1960s and went over it with my class. I think the presentation worked really well in helping students to situate or place the target text. I realize that the situation is part of the text and cutting the text from its situation would produce difficulties in understanding.\n\nScholes says that in the normal world, we encounter most texts along with clues about their contexts and their sources. But in the world of testing, students are mostly like to encounter texts stripped out of their contexts. Students may not be able to accurately interpret a text due to the lack of historical, cultural and social contexts. This raises a question in regards to the validity of standardized testing.\n\nScholes’ theory of situating a text also corresponds with Rosenblatt’s idea that reading is an event that happens with a particular reader, at a particular time, within a particular context, and with a particular text. In another word, reading is situated.\n\nI chose to read The Crafty Reader with the assumption that it was going to discuss reading strategies for different genres of literary works. Well, the book does talk about different genres of text; however, it does not provide reading strategies, at least not from what I can see. So, I am a little disappointed.\n\nSince I figured out that Robert Scholes was not going to teach me specific reading strategies, I switched my focus and start to examine his reading theories that underlie his essays in this book. I find examining his theories much more helpful.\n\nOne of the arguments Scholes attempts to make is how literature should be taught. Let’s face the reality: most of our students are not going to become literary scholars or writers. They are most likely to be in some line of work far removed from the literary world. If they are not lovers of books, how do we approach them? How do we justify the time and energy we spend on teaching and studying literature? Robert Scholes believes that teachers, too often, put too much emphasis on “reading between the line.” The Scholes approach is to look at how literature intersects with life.\n\nIn the classroom, literature should not be reduced to exercises and drills. Although we can use literature to teach grammar, literary techniques, history, politics, or geometry, that is not the ultimate value of literature. Literature is a piece of art and requires readers to see, to feel and to think.\n\nIf teachers are to make literature matter to students, then students’ personal connections to the literature cannot be denied. Rosenblatt’s transactional theory says that meaning lies in the shared ground between the reader and the text; it is not resident in the text; it is not like lemonade, squeezed out of a lesson. Rather, meaning is created when readers and the text act upon each other (transact). Robert Scholes goes so far as to argue that reading text and reflecting upon our lives are essentially the same intellectual process. He states that learning to read is not just a matter of obtaining information from texts, it is a matter of learning to read and write the texts of our lives. If we do well reading texts , then we will do well reading our lives.\n\nI can see a lot of overlapping between Rosenblatt and Scholes. Both of them believe that reading literature is first of all a personal, unique experience. To read literature is to see, to think and to feel it before analyzing and evaluating it. Both Rosenblatt and Scholes bring the reader into focus by validating the reader’s contribution to the text. Lastly, both of them believe that reading is subjective and meaning is variable to different readers. I did a little further research and learned that both Rosenblatt and Scholes are considered reader response theorists.\n\nI would like to know how Rosenbaltt and Scholes differ in their theories. I can sense that their focuses are slightly different, but cannot pinpoint the differences yet.\n\nIn Chapter 3 of “The Crafty Reader,” the author explains his view that the whole world is a text and that the craft of reading is to be able to read the world critically as a text. Scholes argues that everything in this world is textualized and even the human being condition is a condition of textualization in the sense that human beings are born into pre-scripted patterns of life, almost like actors given a script that they must follow.\n\nFrankly speaking, I found this chapter very difficult to follow because the author’s concepts are very abstract. What I get from this chapter is that we, human beings, operate within a cultural script and much of what happens to us in life falls into patterns that already exist. For example, when two people fall in love, they actually fall into a system of signs, scenes, and situations that have been textualized before. Even though every love story is different, each of them contains many of the same already coded elements. Scholes also creates the term of “textual reality” and states that “we live in a textual reality, full of tropes and traps–scenes of language waiting to inhabit our thoughts and direct our tongues.” Is that suggesting what we say, do, and think is pre-scripted and textualized? What exactly are “the scenes of language”? Scholes is not saying that our life is entirely controlled by an outside force, but much of what happens to us in life falls into patterns that are already there, in the culture, waiting for us. In other words, we can view our world and our life as a invisible script; we are actors, subconsciously following this script and acting it out.\n\nReading the world as a text brings up an interesting and meaningful way to view the world. I agree that the world is readable. To see the world as a readable text is a brilliant way to digest what is going on around us. Based on this idea, everything can be read and interpreted. I was reminded of the coffee cup and flowers assignment we did with Dr. Pence, in which we read and interpret objects that are simple and plain as well as actual texts that are rich in meaning. There is meaning in everything.\n\nThe title of this chapter “reading the world” reminds me of Paulo Freire’s book “Reading the World and Reading the Word.” Freire’s work is about critical pedagogy, which involves the development of critical consciousness that allows people to question the nature of their historical and social situation—to read their world—with the goal of creating equality in the society. I have not actually read Freire’s book, but I am wondering if Freire also focuses on the textualization of the world, as Scholes does here. My understanding is that Freire’s “reading the world” teaches students to examine and understand their social, economical, and historical situation as well as how oppression works. The similarities between Scholes and Freire are their emphasis on critical thinking and reading.\n\nThis chapter has been challenging for me to read. It does not talk about specific teaching implications; it never mentions particular reading strategies; instead, it is very theoretical and abstract. It is examining reading from a philosophical point of view. I am still struggling to figure out the connection of this chapter to the rest of the chapters in the book.\n\nIn the first chapter of “The Crafty Reader,” the author addresses the issue of “poetry anxiety.” He claims that “we have lost the craft of reading poetry—lost sight of poetry’s private pleasures and of its public powers—and that our methods of studying and teaching poetry …are very much to blame for this condition” (6).\n\nFirst of all, I have to agree that the problem of poetry anxiety is real. I personally have a fear for poetry and try to avoid it as much as possible as a student and as a teacher. I dread poetry because they seem ambiguous, dense, and distant. I fear poetry also because they are such a high literature that they might be above my head. I fear poetry as I fear going to an art museum because I don’t know how to appreciate them. In the book, Robert Scholes explains that poetry became a name of fear when the reading public expanded and the gap between high literature and popular texts began to widen.\n\nPoetry used to play a larger role in the society than it does today. As Scholes states, poetry was placed at the top of the literary tree in the good old days. Today, poetry has become a name of fear and Scholes puts the blame on the way poetry is taught in the classrooms. Poetry instruction is not working in many classrooms because of the impact of New Criticism. New Criticism, says Scholes, separated poetry from life by focusing on technical forms, such as tone, theme, irony, and paradox, rather than focusing on students’ experiences with the poems. Scholes further illustrates the pedagogical problems under New Criticism by citing real-life student problems with poetry.\n\nThe specific examples Scholes cites come from online bulletin boards on which students can post questions and ask for assistance. The author spent some time looking on the bulletin boards and offering advice occasionally. The questions students posted had really shed light on the problems with poetry instruction in the classrooms. Here are some of the students’ questions:\n\nI need help identifying symbolism in Rose for Emily!\n\nHow do I decide the tone of Antigone?\n\nI need help finding ironies in Oedipus!\n\nWhat’s the theme of Huck Finn? Help please!\n\nAs you can see, all of the students’ questions are about technical terms and literary techniques used to analyze poetry. Students rarely talk about how they feel about the poems and how they enjoy reading them. As Scholes explains, focusing on the technical forms has “cut poems off from their subject matter and their possible connection with the lives of their readers.”\n\nScholes’ idea of reading poetry corresponds with Rosenblatt’s transactional theory by putting both the reader and the text in focus. What Scholes seems to argue is that poetry needs to be read more from an aesthetic stance. The feelings, emotions, and response evoked by reading poems are more important than learning about the technical forms of the poems. Our education processes often, unwittingly, nullify or subvert the aesthetic stances and overemphasize the efferent purposes of reading.\n\nSo, what are the crafts of reading poetry? The author provides a list of specific ideas, which I find very useful. Here I summarize the list and categorize the items in the list into the following three aspects:\n\n1. understand the situation and the context of the poem\n\n2. Know your response to and your evaluation of the poem: are you convinced? What emotions do you experience from reading the poem? How do you relate to the poem? What value do you find in the poem?\n\n3. consider the technical forms used in the poem and what functions they serve.\n\nAs I was working on this blog, I attended the annual convocation at my school (CNM), which brings the entire college together on a day to celebrate our achievement and reflect on our future goals. This year, the convocation featured a famous poet and his poetry. For the first time in a while, I enjoyed the poems that were shared at our event. I came home and worked on this blog, and then I realized why I enjoyed those poems: They are about teaching and learning that I deal with on a daily basis; they reflect a teacher’s life; they make me feel passionate about my career; they make me laugh hard with my colleagues. (as some of his poems are so funny!) I have just experienced a true aesthetic reading experience of good poetry. I believe that is the kind of poetry reading Scholes tries to promote in this chapter.\n\nThe Crafty Reader by Robert Scholes\n\nIntroduction: Reading as a Craft\n\nI am reading “The Crafty Reader” by Robert Scholes. In the introduction of the book, the author first distinguishes craft from art. “Art is high, craft is low. Art is unique; it can’t be taught. Craft is common; it can be learned”(p.xiii). In other words, art is an open-ended construction achieved through innate creativity and talents ; while craft refers to a set of structured skills that can be acquired. In this sense, reading as an art is clearly different from reading as a craft. Reading as an art would involve virtuoso readers who produce readings that are amazingly original, which turns into writings eventually. Obviously, few people will be able to reach that level of reading. Reading as a craft, on the other hand, involves learning the skills and acquiring certain tools in order to read effectively, which is the purpose of Scholes’ book. The author states that his book attempts to demonstrate how some of these reading tools work and how they may be acquired.\n\nThis introduction reminds me of my first day speech in my college reading class. I always explain to my students that my class is not meant to turn them into avid readers, but to show them some “tricks of the trade” to help them handle college reading. Using Scholes’ term, I am teaching the craft of college reading to my students. Teaching the college reading course has been a personal challenge to me as I am trying to sharpen my own command of the craft of reading–to become a craftier reader, especially in the situation of college text. That is a major reason why I chose to read this book.\n\nI think it is important to make the distinction between reading as an art and reading as a craft. In my experience working with underprepared community college students, some of them are very intimidated by reading and have low self confidence in approaching reading, which is partly due to their misunderstanding of reading. Subconsciously, these students view reading as an art, which requires exceptional skills and talents. What I try to help them understand is that you do not need to be a virtuoso reader in order to succeed in college; instead, they need to be a crafty reader equipped with the tools and skills to interpret college text.\n\nAnother valuable point the author makes in the introduction is that the emergence of new media has generated a gap between “high” texts and “low” texts. Those new texts have been labeled as “low.” The author goes on to argue that “valuable text are to be found in all media, and in many genres within those media” and that difficult and obscure does not equate valuable. I think this argument is important to consider as new forms of texts are becoming more pervasive. What kind of role should new texts assume in the teaching of reading?\n\nFrom reading the Contents page of the book, I note that the author divides up his book based on different genres of texts. It seems that he will be discussing unique craft of reading needed for a particular genre of text, for example, how to read poetry, how to read science fantasy, how to read detective novels, etc."
