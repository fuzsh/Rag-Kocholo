        "text": "Biography\n\nRobert Jarrow is the Ronald P. and Susan E. Lynch Professor of Investment Management at the Cornell SC Johnson College of Business. He is a co-creator of the Heath-Jarrow-Morton (HJM) model, the reduced form credit risk model, and the forward price martingale measure. These are the standard models used for pricing and hedging derivatives in major financial institutions. Jarrow was the first to distinguish forward/futures prices and to study market manipulation using arbitrage-pricing theory. He has written seven textbooks, including the first on the Black Scholes Merton and HJM models, and has over 200 academic journal publications.\n\nJarrow is on the advisory board of numerous academic journals including the Frontiers of Mathematical Finance. His research has won many awards, including the Graham and Dodd Scrolls Award 2001, the CBOE Pomerance Prize 1982, the Ross Best Paper Award 2008, and the Bernstein Fabozzi/Jacobs Levy Award 2009. In 1997, he was named IAFE Financial Engineer of the Year in recognition of his research accomplishments. He is currently an IAFE senior fellow. Jarrow is in the Fixed Income Analysts Society Hall of Fame, Risk Magazine's 50 member Hall of Fame, and listed in the Who's Who of Economics. He received Risk Magazine's Lifetime Achievement Award in 2009. He also serves on various industry advisory boards.\n\nJarrow's teaching and research interests involve the study of mathematical finance, with particular emphasis on derivatives, asset pricing, and risk management. He is a graduate faculty representative in numerous fields: management, economics, operations research and information engineering, and applied mathematics."
