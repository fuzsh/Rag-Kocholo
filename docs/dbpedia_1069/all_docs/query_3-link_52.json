        "text": "Introduction\n\nThe teaching of literature has always been a challenging process, starting from the preparation of\n\nthe course syllabus to the reality of the class. The teaching process has always been connected to the\n\ngoals of teaching literary texts.\n\nAt the beginning, literature bridged the gap between normative expectations, about what society\n\nshould be and the forms of experience in everyday life. Literature was seen as a repository of moral and\n\nspiritual values, responsible of making people better human beings, a matter of morals, civilization and\n\nhumanity, a mark of national culture and identity.\n\nLiterature also helps the acquisition of effective rhetorical and communication skills. It describes\n\nthe world in a given situation and allows its perception and understanding. There is a complex\n\nrelationship between grammar and a humanistic interactive field that changes constantly, since it follows\n\nthe needs of its speakers and changes according to their context. Literature can be considered a valuable\n\nsource of ‘authentic material’ because it has two main characteristics in its written form: one is “language\n\nin use,” that is, the use of linguistics by those who refined it into a form for its native speakers; the second\n\nis an aesthetic representation of the spoken language which is can represent language in a certain cultural\n\ncontext. Language refinement, either through its aesthetic reading or its “efferent reading” of a literary\n\nwork, offers a “rich context in which individual or lexical items are made more memorable”\n\n(Collie&Slater, 1988, p.5).\n\nA literary text provides students with a much clearer idea about the syntactic structure of a written\n\ntext and to what extent written language differs from spoken language. By getting used to the formation\n\nand function of sentences, to the structure of a paragraph, a section or a chapter, their writing skills\n\nimprove and their speech skill can improve. Of course, students considerably expand their vocabulary by\n\nbeing exposed to a literary text.\n\nTo F.R. Leavis, the study of literature was a chief weapon against the corruption and vulgarity of\n\nmass urban industrial society, a space which studied “the most fundamental questions of human\n\nexistence-what is meant to be a person, to engage in significant relationship with others, to live from the\n\nvital center of most essential values” (Eagleton, 1996, p.9)\n\nAlthough literature is closely connected to social contexts, New Criticism isolated the study of the\n\ntext from historical contexts, transforming it in a language laboratory of irony, tone, paradox and\n\nsymbolism. At the other end of the range of diverse literary theories, literature was an explicit political\n\nact, expressing different views of race, gender, radical or political groups which was important in the\n\nformation of personal identity and in political struggle, a form of protest and conscience awakening.\n\nLiterature was also regarded as a type of philosophical study on signification, representation and\n\nideology, a frame which gave rise to transdisciplinary enterprises in its study.\n\nHowever, between the normative and imaginative, between pleasure, philosophy and politics, the\n\nteaching of literature is important in education and life for every individual. That is why, this shared goal\n\nwhich functions for everybody must associate with attention to pedagogy and to learning theories.\n\nConsequently, we should define our objectives in teaching literature as actions and competencies of our\n\nstudents, the skills we want our students to acquire.\n\nCertainly, any teaching process starts from a clear structure of the material and a statement of\n\nobjectives. The taxonomy of educational objectives includes a hierarchy of cognitive skills, knowledge,\n\ncomprehension, application, analysis, synthesis and evaluation. In the Romanian literature curricula for\n\nPreschool and Primary Pedagogy program of studies, the objectives divide into cognitive (acquisition of\n\ntheories on the global approach of language and general information on literature, methods of forming\n\ncreative and correct language, acquisition of modern teaching strategies, of the concepts of projection,\n\noperationalizing and evaluation as well as familiarity of literary genres and representative texts and\n\ntechniques of analyzing and interpreting the literary text), procedural objectives (which refer to the\n\nacquisition of skills in order to operationalize the objectives of different activities in the classroom with a\n\nview to encourage creative thinking) and attitudinal objectives (which mainly refer to the personal side of\n\nthe training for the future profession-responsibility in assimilating fundamental concepts in the domain,\n\ncontinuous professional training through permanent research and documentation, implication in\n\nextracurricular activities.) However, we must not forget that the general objective of the course is not only\n\nto cover a certain set of literary topics, but also to train our students to think, read, analyze, and\n\nunderstand and to approach literary texts as specialists. In other words, we aim at giving them a set of\n\ncritical skills they can apply in the domain of language, literature and culture as well.\n\nConsequently, courses must be defined by the texts of the syllabi and also by the acts that students\n\nwill be expected to perform. In other words, we should train our students to think, read and analyze\n\nliterary texts from a scientific point of view but also to approach the literary text from their point of view.\n\nSome critics like Robert Scholes has proposed a reorientation of literary pedagogy towards rhetoric and\n\nreading, in order to help students” recognize the power texts have over them and assist the same students\n\nin obtaining a measure of control over textual processes” (Scholes, 1985, p.39).\n\nTaking into account any approach we adopt in teaching literature, we must transform it in\n\nmeasurable and realistic units and engage our students in activities meant to form specific competencies\n\nand skills. Mainly, our students should recognize differences in language use, distinguish between literal\n\nand metaphorical meaning, understand figurative language in its units, develop knowledge about an\n\nauthor and his work, and decode the stream of language. The student should also detect cultural\n\nreferences of a different period or society, use literature as a means of broadening life experiences\n\nthrough creative thinking, learn with others and defend one’s opinion through debates and analysis.\n\nTeaching Literature for Pedagogy of Preschool and Primary Education Program of Studies\n\nTo this end, theories that apply to the teaching of literature are divided into subject-centered\n\ntheories which focus on the content and information, teacher-centered theories which are centered on\n\nwhat a teacher should do or be in order to facilitate education and student-centered theories (Showalter,\n\n2006, p.27) which are centered on the way people learn and the structure and organization of the\n\nclassroom process for an active learning. Certainly, very few teachers apply a single theory and we can\n\naffirm from our teaching experience that teachers often use a combination of them, according to the\n\nstructure and level of the class.\n\nSubject centered-theories consider education as a depository act, an act of transferring knowledge\n\nfrom the teacher to the student. All teachers are expected to know their fields and follow a certain\n\ncurricula which include texts considered to be of interest for most students. The Romanian literature\n\ncurricula contain texts and authors such as Alecsandri, Creangă and Eminescu, representative for the\n\nliterary canon and the development of the individual. Such theory was well illustrated by the teaching of\n\nthe leftist poets and prose-writers during the communist era where such texts were taught in order to\n\nshape a future ideology, an aesthetic and moral frame and was considered coercive and undemocratic.\n\nNevertheless, the teaching of representative works allows students to have objective remarks or to\n\ninterpret the texts in point of their actuality, power or interest for the present-day readers.\n\nTeachers may have intellectual convictions about one subject. A teacher may prefer a certain way\n\nof interpreting texts since his ideas and beliefs are at the center of his teaching. That is why it is very\n\nimportant to assess the class level of understanding and to provide a decoding scheme of literary texts in\n\norder to let them discover the hidden meanings. When teaching the fairy-tale it is generally accepted that\n\nit is a story about good and evil, fantastic and mysterious, with different types of characters, with specific\n\ndimensions of the space and time concepts. Sometimes, predetermined clues and meanings can be guided\n\nby the teacher but students can be led to discover the patterns and debate on time, space or other\n\nassociated topics. A complex story like Harap-Alb must give raise to different levels of analysis and\n\nunderstanding (from the story itself, to the symbolical level and to the language).\n\nOn the other hand, subject-centered teaching must take into consideration that if a student is given\n\na lot of information, he will consider reading an optional task. A student can have his own opinion on the\n\ntext only if he knows it. Classroom practice shows that it is always useful to present the text and the\n\nassociated literary theories and then let the students have their own presentations and give their own\n\nopinion in order to meet the curricular functions, all based on their readings.\n\nTeacher-centered theories focus on what teachers must do or be in order to facilitate the\n\neducational act. They focus on the performative aspect of the process, since many studies show that a\n\nteacher with good speaking skills and charisma has good results. Performance must be integral to the\n\nprocess of learning, the classroom becomes a “dynamic and dramatic space” (Showalter, 2006, p. 34).\n\nLiterature teachers need good speaking abilities which are very important in the communication\n\nprocess. In teaching poetry, the act of reading a poem in the classroom has many benefits, from the\n\nconcrete to the emotional material of the text.\n\nFurthermore, Parker J. Palmer, a specialist in pedagogy advocates a “community of learning”\n\nwhich includes the teacher and the students. This refers to physical arrangement of the room, by depth\n\nrather than length of assignments, by the toleration of silence and teaching by questioning and\n\nencouragement to express one’s feelings and beliefs. This approach is far from the impersonal and\n\nobjective teaching of literature, familiar to the traditional style.\n\nThe research of teaching-learning styles has led to a shift towards student-centered theories which\n\nrely less on the traditional presentation of the literary work but on an active collaborative learning where\n\nthe students confronts the text directly. Active learning implies what the student does while teacher\n\nperformance becomes less important and is measured in terms of students’ acquisitions. Thus, it is not\n\nabout teacher omniscience and personality but about large group teaching or small group teaching.\n\nMost teachers need to be pragmatic and use whatever seems to work with the students or the\n\nsubject. This is often called an eclectic view and takes into account the content, the possible meanings,\n\nthe examination of the structure, the historical context assessment and comprehension of the text.\n\nAfter selecting an author or a text, the teacher may consider some pre-teaching activities\n\n(Kramsch, 2010, p.139) such as textual clues, focus, pedagogic format (whole class discussion, individual\n\nreport, group work). Also, the teacher must be ready to switch the lesson plan (reconstruct the story if the\n\nclass has not read the text). Pre-reading activities may refer to types of reading (for information and for\n\nexperience), to pedagogic expectations (students are explained what is expected on them).\n\nThe act of reading is represented by Judith Langer (Pamfil, 2003, p.64) through four types of\n\nrelations which are established between the reader and the text: 1) a shift from the outward to the inward;\n\nentering the world of the text 2) to be inward and explore the text 3) to shift back and rethink the data we\n\nhave 4) to get out of the text and objectivate the experience. Generally, the didactic approach of the\n\nliterary text has three stages: a. pre-reading activities, b. understanding and interpretation, c. reflection.\n\nThe pre-reading stage develops students’ interests for the new text. They are given information\n\nabout the author, period, trend; the fragment is integrated in the whole. Certainly, the classical formula\n\ncan be altered with other modalities, anticipations, discussions, presentations, according to the topic\n\nselected. For instance, if we are ready to teach Eminescu, students may prepare an assignment about\n\nRomanticism that can serve as an introductory part for the course.\n\nThe understanding and interpretation of the text is made by means of the direct contact with the\n\nliterary text first through reading and includes all the other activities which lead to decoding and\n\ninterpretation. The approach of any literary text cannot be done without its reading. With some texts such\n\nas recipes, directions, reports, readers focus on the referential and such kind of reading is called “efferent”\n\nreading, where the primary purpose behind the act is gathering information of some kind. The other kind\n\nof reading, “aesthetic” reading is focused on experiential, namely, reading done for the experience it\n\nprovides. (Rosenblatt, 1978, p.35). This kind of reading is necessary with poems, stories, novels and\n\ndrama or as Scholes argues even with other aesthetic arts such as visual arts and music. The amount of\n\ntime allocated to the reading of the text depend on several factors; literary genre, the structure of the\n\ncourse, the pedagogic format. The teacher must take into consideration independent reading, shared\n\nreading and group instruction (in seminars).\n\nFor decoding and interpretation, the teacher offers the basic comprehension strategies for both\n\nefferent and aesthetic reading. As an experienced strategic reader, the teacher not only gives information\n\nabout the authorial techniques of the respective text but he also facilitates reading and understanding\n\nthrough questions. These can be open-ended questions that ask for new ideas or closed questions which\n\nrefer to already known information. Thus, students must understand the dynamics of the plot, its\n\ndevelopment, identify, classify and define characters, understand the concepts of time and space. In case\n\nof poetry, the teacher might ask students to identify literary devices within a particular section. The\n\nteacher must also encourage students to engage in a dialogue, making intertextual connections and\n\nindividual responses. Learning to read and understand what is read enhances students’ appreciation of the\n\nbook or of the author.\n\nReflection as final stage in the study of the literary text refer to the analysis of the new acquisitions\n\nfor self-experience, to the connections that can be made with other types of text and other types of\n\ncommunication. Students are encouraged to find their own meanings by exploring possibilities,\n\nconsidering understandings from multiple perspectives, sharpening their own interpretations, and learning\n\nabout literary issues through their own responses. Intertextual references not only point to another literary\n\ntext, but also to an entire cultural experience specific to a certain socio-historical context. These\n\ninterconnections guide students to develop a considerable understanding of the way of life and of the\n\nconnections to other cultural disciplines, establishing a complex relationship.\n\nIn addition, between the theories of Robert Scholes who proposed a reorientation of literary\n\npedagogy towards rhetoric and reading rather than teaching any particular great books or literary canons\n\nto the careful analysis of particular pieces of literary genres, each teaching approach appeals to several\n\ntechniques, such as lecturing, listening, memorization, discussions, exercises, group work, and recitation.\n\nSome teachers use new technologies, from slide projectors to websites while others develop technologies\n\nwhich enable open discussions.\n\nTeaching prose fiction has a flexible methodology. Novels may be taught in a wide variety of\n\nchoices. There may be one novel or the novels of an author, the novels of a particular period. It may\n\nbegin with the author, the historical context, the storyline, characters, and narrative conventions of\n\ntemporality. Obviously a major obstacle in teaching a novel is its length. Students must be assigned\n\ncertain number of pages, reading check-terms, also considering intertextuality issues. Another challenge\n\nof teaching long books is the background and especially literary tradition, influence and intertextuality.\n\nThe curricula changed over years and advocates teaching thematic courses in spite of individual authors.\n\nCertainly, individual authors are the reference point but it is more frequent to teach a certain period or\n\nsubspecies and then to illustrate with particular authors, in order to permit comparisons and further\n\ninvestigations. For instance the Romanian literature curricula for Primary and Preschool Pedagogy future\n\nteachers uses themes like traditional short story, traditional novel, the Buildungsroman, the realist novel,\n\nthe psychological novel, the modern novel, the war novel. By the end of the course, students should be\n\nable to identify and analyze the techniques writers use, to locate the works in their historical context, to\n\nidentify themes and motifs, to compare novels with their adaptations for other media in terms of their\n\nnarrative conventions, to form and to apply critical skills to other fields.\n\nWhen teaching the narrative, the text must be made relevant to the students through cognitive\n\noperations: exploring the storyline, formulate questions, establish logical relationships, select\n\ninformation, organize fact and events, generalize, explore consequences, evaluate. For instance Amintiri\n\ndin copilărie can be taught using such operations and can also be used as a starting point for writing\n\nassignments about one’s childhood(pleasant, unpleasant, humorous) experiences.\n\nTeaching poetry detaches the reader from the usual frame of reference by “immersing him in a\n\nworld of sounds, rhymes, stress and other formal figures of speech” (Kramsch, 2010, p.156). Poetry is\n\nusually considered most difficult to teach. In teaching poetry, the teacher must combine a range of\n\ntechniques and methods.\n\nFirst of all, poetry is written in a specialized technical language. Students must understand that\n\n“poetry is written in a line of syllables with sonic and auditory relationships. The sonic patterns encode a\n\nset of meanings that are already there.”(Showalter, 2010, p.65). That is why, the student need a precise\n\nvocabulary to understand poetry. One can also try to organize the course in terms of genre, since such\n\nsegments have a strong generic emphasis which can be effective in analyzing and discussing the poem in\n\nhistory. Moreover, for an understanding of a poem, students need extensive, historical, literary,\n\nmythological or theological information.\n\nIn teaching poetry, three stages must be taken; reading, lecturing (trope and technique) and\n\ninterpretation or emotion. Whether the text is taught in one or over several lessons, the text, opening lines\n\nor part of it should be read in the classroom. Memorization and writing about poetry are also used. The\n\noldest pedagogical method for teaching poetry is memorization. We all learnt poems by heart as school\n\nassignments or voluntarily because we liked it. Formerly, knowing a poem by heart was quite natural or a\n\nsign of good education and intelligence while nowadays the habit seems to be unusual in the modern\n\nclassroom. However, memorization is a useful pedagogical tool since “once committed to memory, the\n\npoem has the capacity to induce a sense of transcendence in the reader who recites it” (Showalter, 2010,\n\np.69). Through memorizing, the student comes in an intimate connection with the author and the work,\n\nunderstands how the work is done and feels the sounds and the words and which runs underneath.\n\nAs a rule, there can be two approaches in teaching poetry. The classical approach takes into\n\naccount reading, discussion of the title, theme, and structure, the analysis on different levels,\n\ninterpretation, and poetic diction. The structuralist model proposes a first stage which includes the use of\n\nimages, films, paintings with reference to the respective piece of poetry, the first exploration-reading, the\n\nintuition of the theme and dominant feeling, selection of relevant lines, the analysis on lyrical sequences\n\nor fragments and the final stage-open questions, interpretations, analogies. There is no rule in choosing\n\none or another model when teaching Romanian poets but one can consider the classical model with\n\nAlecsandri and Eminescu and the structuralist one with poets such as Eminescu, Blaga or\n\nNichitaStanescu.\n\nTeaching drama can be done through a combination of methods since teaching itself is considered\n\nto have a dramatic character. Moreover, taking into account the specific character of the genre, it can be\n\nconsidered that plays are not meant to be read, that is why it is very important to see them on stage and\n\nperceive the performative possibilities. A teacher may bring some elementsof the story, all the\n\ninformation in the way of drama techniques – role playing, dialogue, audience participation, dramatic\n\ntension, improvisation, the strategic use of interaction, space, movement, and gesture, the characters and\n\nthe setting but the whole image can be grasped only at the theatre. Students can also appreciate the non-\n\nverbal elements in a play, such as gestures or sounds. Staged plays such as O scrisoare pierdută , O\n\nnoapte furtunoasă can be entirely seen, giving students clues in matter of content and ideas. Teaching\n\ntechniques can be student-centered and can lead to intellectual discovery of the text."
