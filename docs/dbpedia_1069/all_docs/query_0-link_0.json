        "text": "Academic discipline\n\nFor the academic journal, see Science Fiction Studies.\n\nScience fiction studies is the common name for the academic discipline that studies and researches the history, culture, and works of science fiction and, more broadly, speculative fiction.\n\nThe modern field of science fiction studies is closely related to popular culture studies, a subdiscipline of cultural studies, and film and literature studies.[citation needed] Because of the ties with futurism and utopian works, there is often overlap with these fields as well. The field also has spawned subfields, such as feminist science fiction studies.[citation needed]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nAs the pulp era progressed, shifting science fiction ever further into popular culture, groups of writers, editors, publishers, and fans (often scientists, academics, and scholars of other fields) systematically organized publishing enterprises, conferences, and other insignia of an academic discipline. Much discussion about science fiction took place in the letter columns of early SF magazines and fanzines, and the first book of commentary on science fiction in the US was Clyde F. Beck's Hammer and Tongs, a chapbook of essays originally published in a fanzine.[1]\n\nThe 1940s saw the appearance of three full-scale scholarly works that treated science fiction and its literary ancestors: Philip Babcock Gove's The Imaginary Voyage in Prose Fiction (1941), J. O. Bailey's Pilgrims Through Space and Time (1948), and Marjorie Hope Nicolson's Voyages to the Moon (1949).[2]\n\nPeter Nicholls credits Sam Moskowitz with teaching \"what was almost certainly the first sf course in the USA to be given through a college\": a non-credit course in \"Science Fiction Writing\" at City College of New York in 1953. The first regular, for-credit courses were taught by Mark Hillegas (at Colgate) and H. Bruce Franklin (at Stanford) in 1961.[3] During the 1960s, more science fiction scholars began to move into the academy, founding academic journals devoted to the exploration of the literature and works of science fiction.[4][5] The explosion of film studies and cultural studies more broadly granted the nascent discipline additional credibility, and throughout the 1970s and 1980s, mainstream scholars such as Susan Sontag[6] turned their critical attention to science fiction.\n\nIn 1982, James Gunn established the Center for the Study of Science Fiction as a Kansas Board of Regents Center as a focus for the SF programs he offered at the University of Kansas, beginning in 1969. This was the first such SF organization at a major university.[7]\n\nThe 1990s saw the first academic programs and degree-granting programs established,[8] and the field shows continued steady growth.[9]\n\nDegree-granting programs\n\n[edit]\n\nFlorida Atlantic University, MA in Literature & Theory with a concentration in Science Fiction and Fantasy\n\nUniversity of California, Riverside PhD Designated Emphasis in Science Fiction and Technoculture Studies.\n\nUniversity of Kansas, MA, MFA, PhD in English with Emphasis in Science Fiction Studies Center for the Study of Science Fiction [10]\n\nUniversity of Liverpool, M.A. in Science Fiction Studies (course) (program explores genre of science fiction and its relationship to literature, science, and technology)\n\nBeijing Normal University, M.A. in Science Fiction Studies\n\nDiscontinued\n\n[edit]\n\nUniversity of Dundee, MLitt in Science Fiction\n\nNotable scholars\n\n[edit]\n\nPrincipal journals, conferences, societies, awards\n\n[edit]\n\nSocieties:\n\nScience Fiction Research Association (SFRA)\n\nSociety for Utopian Studies\n\nInternational Association for the Fantastic in the Arts (IAFA)\n\nUtopian Studies Society\n\nLondon Science Fiction Research Community (LSFRC), London-based organisation of SF scholars and fans[11]\n\nGeneral journals:\n\nExtrapolation\n\nScience Fiction Studies\n\nFoundation: The International Review of Science Fiction\n\nMOSF Journal of Science Fiction\n\nThe Eaton Journal of Archival Research in Science Fiction\n\nJournal for the Fantastic in the Arts (JFA)\n\nVector (magazine), critical magazine of the British Science Fiction Association (BSFA)\n\nReview journals:\n\nThe Internet Review of Science Fiction (IROSF)\n\nNew York Review of Science Fiction (NYRSF)\n\nConferences:\n\nScience Fiction Research Association annual convention\n\nInternational Association for the Fantastic in the Arts (IAFA) annual convention\n\nWiscon (hybrid academic science fiction conference/science fiction convention, with an extensive academic programming track concentrating on issues of gender, sexuality and class)\n\nMythcon (Mythopoeic Society annual convention)\n\nEaton Science Fiction Conference, biennial conference at University of California, Riverside\n\nStage the Future conference on science fiction theatre\n\nSignificant scholarship awards:\n\n\"Pilgrim Award\", Science Fiction Research Association\n\nPioneer Award for Outstanding Scholarship, Science Fiction Research Association\n\n\"Distinguished Scholar Award\", International Association for the Fantastic in the Arts[12]\n\nJ.
