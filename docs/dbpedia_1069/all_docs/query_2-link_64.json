George Yano and his mother, sister, and brothers succumb to this fear: they are forced to abandon their farmland in Central Washington and must relocate to a Portland, Oregon assembly center.

As Molly and George grow closer, so too do their families.\n\nIn a rich novel spanning Portland's assembly center, farming communities in Eastern Oregon, and internment camps like Minidoka in Idaho, A Shrug of the Shoulders renders the Yanos’ and Mitas’ lives with care, hope, and historical fidelity.

But she is troubled by the silence that surrounds her parents' death and clings fiercely to her only inheritance from them: the unfinished love note she found hidden in her mother's book of poetry. Korobi dreams of one day finding a love as powerful as her parents’, and it seems her wish has come true when she meets the charming Rajat, the only son of a high-profile business family. On the night of their engagement party, Korobi’s grandfather dies of a sudden heart attack. His death reveals the family's unexpected financial problems as well as a dark secret. This secret will shatter Korobi's sense of self and will thrust her—against the wishes of her fiancé and his family—out of her sheltered Kolkata life into a courageous and troubled search, in the company of an attractive stranger, across post 9/11America, a country that she finds at once dangerous, unwelcoming and alluring. What she discovers at the end will force her to make the most difficult choice of her life.\n\nWinter Quarter 2013\n\nAuthor Alice Derry: Celebrate William Stafford's Birthday\n\nAuthor Alice Derry focuses on the works of the late poet William Stafford, participants will be encouraged to explore the thread they \"don't ever let go of.\" Attendees can expect to complete exercises, discuss writing, practice presented techniques, and read and analyze poetry.
