        "text": "When an article on Oprah Daily opens by saying that a writer’s “widespread acclaim [is] finally catching up with his talent” (Bell), it basically proves its own point. In 2023, Percival Everett—the writer in question—is receiving not only the popular attention that was long overdue but also critical recognition on a new public scale, such as most recently the PEN/Jean Stein Book Award for his novel Dr. No. On top of that, there was and is a substantial readership across the spectrum of professional and non-professional readers who treat Everett like a favorite band, knowing they can buy by default any new work he publishes because they will enjoy it—even though, or precisely because, it will entertain and challenge them in ways in ways they didn’t see coming. All in all, the complaint about Everett’s relative popular and critical neglect that was all too common for decades, with all the expected phrases of a “cult following” or a “writer’s writer” in the mix, is finally baseless today. From an academic perspective, the ever-growing bibliography curated on the website of the Percival Everett International Society1 attests to this steady and solid canonization as much as the existence of that organization itself. At the same time, this scholarly engagement is very much an ongoing project, not least because the man publishes novels at a rate that must make even reviewers nervous about not keeping up. This special issue of Orbit adds to this growing body of critical work, as we may no longer be in a situation where Everett’s novels don’t get enough attention, but we are still in a situation where they deserve more of it.\n\nIf you ever need to tell someone very concisely what Everett is up to in his fiction, look no further than the 2021 reissue of his novella Grand Canyon, Inc. by Picture Books/Gagosian, originally published in 2001. The tale itself has many of the hallmarks of an Everett piece, to be sure: a Western setting that evokes, draws on, and subverts the symbolic inscriptions by a cross-medial aesthetic regionalism that has for centuries tied it to particular imaginations of Americanness, along with those of masculinity, ethnicity, etc.; a satirical mode of humorous critique whose spectrum covers the laugh-out-loud-funny joke and the smile freezing bitterly on your lips; or finally a wildly exaggerated but just-credible-enough premise in the Mark Twain tradition of the tall tale2 that continually escalates into the fantastic in the Donald Barthelme tradition. Yet the tale itself,3 remarkably, is less succinctly illustrative of Everett’s fictional methods than its juxtaposition with Richard Prince’s photograph Untitled (Original Cowboy) in that edition.\n\nThe complicated way of connecting Everett’s fiction to Prince’s photo is to suggest a parallel between Everett’s use of genre, convention, and trope and Prince’s practice of rephotography. Prince is known best for photographing advertisements4 and manipulating them in various ways “to intensify their original artifice,” as the website of The Met has it. Introducing Prince’s most famous work, Untitled (Cowboy), an appropriation of the Marlboro Man, the anonymous author explains that Prince’s modifications “undermined the seeming naturalness and inevitability of the images, revealing them as hallucinatory fictions of society’s desires.” This parallels Everett’s engagement with the West (and occasionally the genre of the Western) that may well be one of the most persistent features5 of his massively diverse oeuvre, starting with his second novel Walk Me to the Distance (1985) and including God’s Country (1994), The Body of Martin Aguilera (1997), Wounded (2005), or short stories such as those collected in Half an Inch of Water (2015), or indeed his children’s book The One that Got Away (1992). As mentioned above, Everett’s Western tales are never simply parodies but multifaceted reworkings of familiar and well-established patterns and motifs alongside unexpected elements that play with the former without entirely dismissing them either, and in that sense they parallel Prince’s critical practice of appropriation and modification—although it would be remiss to suggest that Everett’s reworkings are as derivative as Prince’s.\n\nHowever, the photo that accompanies Everett’s novella is not appropriation art in any stricter sense but a kind of rephotography. The publisher’s shop website points out that Prince took an original photograph that is deeply unoriginal, as he “visited the area to seek out quintessential viewpoints established by preceding photographers” (Gagosian Shop). But again, that’s not even the most salient point. The simple way of connecting Everett’s fiction to Prince’s photo is to point out that the novella about the Grand Canyon comes with a photo of Monument Valley. Unless one takes—as series curator Emma Cline does—the really abstract route of explaining how both Everett and Price are “tricksters who take a sideways look at the mythology of the West and reveal it anew” (Gagosian Shop) to argue that their work has something in common on that level, this juxtaposition of text and image is simply and plainly wrong, and it’s also funny. It would have been terribly boring and conventional to include any image of the Grand Canyon, making it no more than a derivative illustration of the primary text, just like it would have been pretentious or distracting to include any work of art that is too different from the novella, subjecting it in turn to the primacy of another medium. The publication hits the sweet spot between these extremes by including an image that is so blatantly and self-consciously out of place, an image that is staged like an illustrative piece of landscape photography but actually represents the wrong site while being still kind of Western enough to still kind of make you see how the mistake could have happened—especially as it reenacts a normalized, stereotypical view of a cliché instead of granting an actual view beyond a preformed one.\n\nIt’s that joke that is typical of Everett’s fiction. Actually, it’s not just a joke but a trick and a game, a playful act of misrepresentation that deliberately refuses mimetic signification or “realistic” immersion, the kind of gambit that draws attention to itself but still does its job. In short, it is emblematic of metafiction. Even mentioning that word here seems akin to taking that same photograph of Monument Valley again that every other photographer has taken there, as the term has moved from the postmodernist avant-garde to being an empty and tiresome cliché, rehashed ad nauseam. Yet Everett, along with few others writing in English today (such as Margaret Atwood), is worth the groan that comes with the term, since much of his highly diverse work is not only aptly described by this overarching label but actually demands a contemporary reconsideration of its tradition that does justice to its conceptual roots and not its epigonal depletion. In fact, Everett is probably the best American writer of metafiction since Nabokov, matching him in both range and precision. His work also shares with Nabokov’s the quality of occasionally being so subtly metafictional that its metafictionality is hard to recognize. It probably takes a Joycean “ideal reader suffering from an ideal insomnia” (Finnegans Wake 120.13–14)6 to identify Lolita as the elaborate language game it is, just like Telephone (2020) at first invites a reading that is more concerned with the world created by language than the language that creates a world (and that’s not even considering all three textual variants of the novel). To be sure, Everett can be as blatantly self-reflexive as the later John Barth—two of his novels to date even include the author’s name in their titles—but for the most part his metafiction really is Nabokovian and not Barthian, if that’s the spectrum of American metafiction we’ll momentarily and reductively open up here. The aforementioned Donald Barthelme is part of that tradition as well, as is, more uneasily, Thomas Pynchon—just to stick with that same postmodernist moment of the mid-1950s through the early 1970s.\n\nNotes\n\nCompeting Interests\n\nThe author has no competing interests to declare.\n\nReferences\n\nAlter, Robert.
