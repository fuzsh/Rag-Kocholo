        "text": "This study deals with the issue of conflict between the programmed mechanical system and the rebellious human being against this system as reflected in the science fiction novel al-Sayyid min Ḥaql al-Sabānik (The Mister from the Spinach Field) by the Egyptian writer Ṣabrī Mūsā. The novel describes a society divided into classes, committees, centers and bodies run by a general system, which establishes a fixed daily program for everyone from the moment each person rises until they go to bed. Thus, the mechanical robotic human being becomes the master of the universe, while the real human being turns into a mechanical slave that obeys and performs without thinking. The hero of the novel, Homo, tries to break this programmed track because it nullifies citizens? creativity, negates their personal freedom within the concept of ?discipline?, and prevents them from following their whims. The tragedy of Man in the coming age lies in his acceptance of slavery imposed by the programmed system, while any attempt to escape it will be abortive and lead to loss and frustration.\n\nThis study examines the meaning of prison space as it is reflected in two Arabic science fiction novels. Prison is a closed space in which inmates are deprived of their freedom, individuality and identity. Traditionally, the vast majority of prisons have been associated with torture and humiliation. In the novel al-ʾAzmān al-muẓlima (Dark Times), Dr. Qāsim is incarcerated in Guantanamo because of his opposition to the actions of a terrorist group. In prison he suffers physical and mental abuse and is experimented on, as if he were a guinea pig. Because he places Qāsim in solitary confinement, the novel?s author must use the literary device of soliloquy in order to convey what is happening in the character?s mind. The novel also highlights positive aspects of life in prison?a place for exchanging views and ideas and for forging new friendships. It also makes the inmates take a more profound look at life and transforms them intellectually, conceptually and ethically. In the novel Qāhir al-Zaman (Time?s Overcomer), the journalist Kāmil is sent to prison because he opposes testing on living human beings. The novel depicts prison as a dark grave, narrow, stagnant and detached from the world, a place where inmates and their behavior are changed. Kāmil is filled with frustration and despair. He behaves like a nervous animal in a cage and his frayed nerves lead to a complete breakdown. His inner agitation makes him lose all contact with his humanity. Kāmil?s reminiscences are used to provide the reader with the missing information concerning his experiences in prison."
