        "text": "BOOKS IN REVIEW\n\nBrian Baker. Science Fiction. READERS' GUIDES TO ESSENTIAL CRITICISM SERIES. New York: Palgrave, 2014. x + 178 pp. $88 hc.; $29 pbk.\n\nPalgrave’s Readers’ Guides to Essential Criticism series, which already includes volumes on Angela Carter, Mary Shelley, Bram Stoker, and George Orwell, has now presented us with Brian Baker’s study Science Fiction. The book consists of eight chapter-length bibliographic essays and a useful bibliography. Baker makes no attempt to be comprehensive but covers as many of the relevant critical works as possible in the allotted space, some of them at length, others in little more than a parenthetical remark.\n\nBaker begins with an Introduction, “At the Borders of Literature and Genre,” which discusses “Science fiction’s crises of legitimation” and argues that the genre “(and its criticism) remains a contested field” (vii). He then covers the standard arguments about sf’s feelings of illegitimacy, devoting space to Roger Luckhurst’s “The Many Deaths of Science Fiction” (1994), centering on his claim that “[t]he ultimate legitimation [of the field] would be to rejoin the literary mainstream, to end SF as a separate genre” (2), Baker also emphasizes that his book focuses on academic rather than fan criticism, though, he insists, not out of any disrespect; he does, however, devote a chapter to the criticism of sf writers such as James Blish and A.J. Budrys, and discusses the work of non-academic critics who simply cannot be ignored—for example, John Clute, Thomas M. Disch, and Paul Kincaid.\n\nIn “Definitions: What is Science Fiction?” Baker summarizes the numerous genre definitions formulated by such critics as David Seed, Adam Roberts, Luckhurst, Tzvetan Todorov, Rosemary Jackson, Christine Brooke-Rose, and Darko Suvin. Many of Baker’s readers will already know this material, but he is particularly good at pointing out how such critics’ definitions are often grounded in very different preconceptions about the genre:\n\nDefining SF is therefore not a neutral activity. To define it in a particular way, in terms of its formal apparatus, its capacity for critique, its potential as a marginal cultural production to act as a form of cryptogram, its potential to imagine “the Other of what is” or even as a form of escape and entertainment, expresses specific political, ethical and literary conceptualizations of the genre. (9)\n\nSuch definitions will also have a deep effect on the critics’ ideas about the formation of the genre—whether an individual critic argues that it began with Lucian or Shelley or Poe or Verne or Wells, or even with Gernsback, is deeply predicated on that critic’s beliefs, political, ethical, aesthetic, or what have you. Is the utopian tradition, for example, at the heart of sf, as Suvin insists, or is it more marginal? To what extent is sf specifically a product of the Protestant mindset? Is real science truly a necessary constituent of the genre?\n\nIn “A History of Histories,” Baker examines how these same critics have assembled their various histories of the genre. Suvin gets first mention, in part because he “complicates the very idea of a history of the genre from the very beginning” (26) by proposing that it grew out of six different “clusters” of literary works: classical myth; the work of Virgil, Plato, and Lucan; the utopian and romantic writers of the French Revolutionary era; the late-nineteenth-century utopian writers such as Morris and Bellamy; the “fictions of technology and wonder” of Verne and others; and finally, the literature of cognitive estrangement, beginning with Wells and on to the present day (27-28). Adam Roberts, on the other hand, proposes that science fiction is a direct outgrowth of and response to the Age of Empire, and somewhat surprisingly centers on Paradise Lost (1667) “as a crucial antecedent for SF … because Satan emerges as a more vital and ‘powerfully conceived’ figure than God”—a true Other, a genuine Alien, rather than a one-dimensional representative of evil. There is much more that I simply do not have space to cover. Suffice to say that Baker also does justice to the theories of historical origin of Luckhurst, Disch, Roberts, Clute, and Brian W. Aldiss.\n\nIn “Science Fiction Writers on SF,” Baker surveys the critical work of Blish, Budrys, and Kingsley Amis, with emphasis on their importance as the creators of sf criticism, and then on criticism of and by such New Wave writers as J.G. Ballard, Michael Moorcock, and Disch. Stanislaw Lem and Philip K. Dick rate a sub-chapter here, as do Ursula K. Le Guin and Samuel R. Delany. Baker also devotes space to a discussion of the fanzines, with specific reference to the fan-studies publications of academics such as Constance Penley and Henry Jenkins. Oddly, he even devotes a paragraph to slash fiction.\n\nThe next chapter, dedicated to “British Science Fiction,” begins by discussing its relationship to empire and the role of H.G. Wells in its foundation. Baker starts with the criticism of Luckhurst and Edward James, with James pointing out that Wells was far from the founder of British sf. As he was writing The Time Machine (1895), “SF was in fact in the middle of its first important boom.” James describes Wells as “a writer who drew together and formalized many of the cultural and literary threads which were present in late Victorian culture to inform his ‘romances’” (61-62). Other critics whose work receives mention here include Patricia Kerslake, John Rieder, and a number of scholars who have written on Wells’s fiction, including Bernard Bergonzi, Patrick Parrinder, Robert M. Philmus, and Mark Hillegas. Baker then briefly surveys criticism on the fiction of Olaf Stapledon, Arthur C. Clarke, and C.S. Lewis before turning to studies of Ballard and the British disaster novel at length. He cites David Ketterer on John Wyndham, along with Nicholas Ruddick, H. Bruce Franklin, David Pringle, Jeanette Baxter, and others on Ballard, a writer who, along with Wells, clearly sits atop the heap so far as Baker and other critics of British sf are concerned. From Ballard, Baker transitions to the criticism of the New Wave, with emphasis on work by Colin Greenland, Andrew M. Butler, and Rob Latham, who, Baker tells us “reads the ‘rise’ of the [New Wave] as a cultural and generic phenomenon, not simply as an avant-garde moment or movement within the confines of the genre” (78; emphasis in original). Finally, he surveys criticism of the British Boom (Iain M. Banks et al.) by Luckhurst, Butler, Farah Mendlesohn, and Mark Bould.\n\nTurning to “The US Tradition,” Baker begins with critical discussions of Edgar Allan Poe’s place in the genre, emphasizing the work of Aldiss, Franklin, Roberts, and Disch, who denigrates Poe as “most suitable for intellectually hyperkinetic teenagers” but nonetheless claims him as “the source” of what became sf (83-84). He then covers criticism devoted to the editors Hugo Gernsback and John W. Campbell, Jr. (noting with great understatement that Gernsback “has become something of a controversial figure in SF studies” [84]), and E.E. “Doc” Smith, whom he identifies as the key author of the pulp era. Oddly, Edgar Rice Burroughs isn’t mentioned here. Pulp sf has been examined in some depth by Mendlesohn, Clute, Gary Westfahl, Andy Sawyer, and others. Campbell’s Astounding ushered in the so-called “Golden Age” of sf, and Baker, identifying Robert A. Heinlein as the key author, concentrates on the criticism available of that author’s work, particularly his controversial novel Starship Troopers (1959), which Alexei Panshin, another notable author-critic, read “as equivalent to a military recruiting film” (93). David Seed, in a related reading, saw the book as Heinlein’s direct response to communism (95). Baker also concentrates on Dick, the subject of more criticism than any other American sf writer, devoting considerable space to Peter Fitting, who “proposes that ‘Dick’s work presents a model of a more subversive form of writing which undermines rather than reconfirms the repressive system in which it has been produced,’” and thus “acts as a kind of critical SF” (97). Finally, Baker devotes space to American hard sf as it has been theorized by critics such as Westfahl, John J. Pierce, and David Samuelson.\n\n“Utopias and Dystopias” summarizes the criticism of Lyman Tower Sargent, Fredric Jameson, and Tom Moylan (on utopia), and of Moylan, Krishan Kumar, and Ruth Levitas (on dystopia), discussing studies on critical dystopias, the often unrecognized connection between utopia and totalitarianism, and the decline in recent years of actual utopian fiction, which Fitting argues has occurred “because we live in dystopian times” (117). “Feminism and Cyberpunk” are an odd couple to yoke together in one somewhat perfunctory chapter, and Baker makes few connections between the two. He mostly devotes space to sub-chapters on critical writings by and about Le Guin, with a nod towards Marleen Barr’s feminist criticism (Joanna Russ’s influential work goes unmentioned); Donna Haraway, Judith Butler, again fan fiction (apparently one of Baker’s own special subjects), and N. Katherine Hayles; and then the leading critics of cyberpunk and related topics, including Andrew Ross, Istvan Csicsery-Ronay, Brian McHale, and Veronica Hollinger.\n\nAnother brief chapter surveys the criticism of “Science Fiction Cinema,” centering on the work of Vivian Sobchack, J.P. Telotte, Christine Cornea, and others, with a final word on “genre hybridity after the millennium.” A short conclusion, “Science Fiction and World Literature,” mentions few actual critical works but suggests that “in a time when SF has once again been proclaimed to be ‘exhausted’, the genre still has the potential for transmission and to vivify the imaginations of writers in Africa, India, east Asia, South America and Australasia” (160).\n\nLike any book of this type that attempts to discuss an enormous body of material in a small space, Baker’s Science Fiction has its faults and odd quirks, some of which I have discussed above, but all in all this is a useful book, particularly for advanced undergraduates or new graduate students looking for a quick way to get up to speed in the criticism of the field.\n\n—Michael M. Levy, University of Wisconsin-Stout\n\nGroundbreaking Guide to Arab-Language SF.\n\nAda Barbaro. La fanta-scienza nella letteratura araba [Science Fiction in Arabic Literature]. Rome: Carocci, 2013. 293 pp. €29 pbk.\n\nAda Barbaro’s study of sf written in Arabic is an outstanding volume, probably the first book-length work on the subject. Whereas the cover, a shot of Larissa Sansour’s 2010 art installation Palestinauts, hints at the genre’s presence in the art scene, the book focuses specifically on written sf, including some borderline works. Aimed primarily at Arab-culture specialists, the study provides a wide-ranging array of references to sf scholarship, with usefully detailed plot summaries. As a cross-national survey, this is a very rare item in Italian sf/f studies, another recent exception being an equally brilliant volume on animals in the Spanish-American fantastic, Emanuela Jossa’s Raccontare gli animali [Telling the Animals] (Florence: Le Lettere, 2012).\n\nThe book opens strongly with a reference to Foucault’s The Order of Things (1966), considering genre as consubstantial with the birth of the modern notion of literature: new aesthetic values, denying or challenging the classic order, often marginalized and silenced, call for critical attention (11). In the same vein, Barbaro refers to Riccardo Valla’s 1975 introduction to the Italian edition of Jacques Sadoul’s Histoire de la science-fiction moderne [History of Modern Science Fiction, 1973], a plea for grounding criticism in literary history, rather than didactically pushing readers towards acceptable highbrow texts (54-56). Thus, Barbaro presents her study as more “descriptive” than “normative,” with a selection of representative texts that highlights their writings as social statements. The introduction by Isabella Camera d’Afflitto (9-10), possibly Italy’s most noted scholar of Arab culture, is evidence of an unprejudiced curiosity about sf within the discipline.\n\nThis book tries to show that, however delayed the emergence of the genre within Arab-speaking areas, many aspects of Arab and Muslim traditions were not hostile to imagining different spaces and times. A crucial turning point—vis-à-vis a standard Arabic language immutable by definition, whose supreme expression is the Quran (18-19)—was the coinage, around the 1980s, of a lexicon of neologisms, mostly calques and similar borrowings. Starting with sf’s Arab name al-ayāl al-’ilmī, the catalogue of sf subgenres and icons was an act of linguistic creation (23-27). An important strand of folklore-inspired tales of the marvelous is to be found in Medieval mirabilia (29-31). In twelfth-century Spain, Ibn Tufayl’s Hayy ibn Yaqzān was a proto-roman philosophique about the practical and cognitive explorations of a human living in a state of nature (33-34), an influence on later thought-experiments about “other” places, including tales in the One Thousand and One Nights (1704), in turn a lasting influence on works of the fabulous and the oneiric. A utopian tradition starts at the end of the nineteenth century, mixing in various degrees socialist and traditionalist stances.\n\nIn opening the discussion of modern times, Barbaro stresses the rise in the 1980s, especially in Egypt, of some tremendously popular action-adventure series consistently employing sf motifs largely aimed at a juvenile audience, mostly authored by the hyper-prolific Nabil Farouk (57-62). In the 1990s, the birth of criticism follows the emergence of sf; along with a standard stress on the genre’s role as bridge between the “two cultures,” Arab critics assign sf a broader task: in Egyptian author Nihad Sharif’s words, that of “driving minds to imagine more vast, boundless, free horizons” (qtd. in Barbaro 67).\n\nBarbaro notes that whereas historians of Arabic sf have signaled the presence of sf titles as early as the 1950s, before the 1980s-1990s these pieces remained quite unnoticed, with occasional critical nods neglecting their generic specificity. On the other hand, some English-speaking critics paid attention to Arab themes and characters in Anglophone sf. Some awareness of world sf was necessary for the genre to develop, and the 1960s (when illiteracy and poverty dropped significantly) saw the growth of translations into Arabic—which included both Golden Age and dystopian classics, as well as some lesser-known items. In criticism, Jean Gattegno’s and Robert Scholes and Eric Rabkin’s studies appeared in the 1990s. Barbaro’s very convincing hypothesis concerning the “belated” rise of Arabic sf is that the spreading of foreign-language readers helped challenge traditional notions of belletrism. Also, post-1960s changes in English-language sf have contributed to shifting the genre’s perception away from Western-ness into postcolonial territory (76-84).\n\nGroundbreaking critics include Mahmūd Qāsim and Muhammad ‘Azzām, both from Syria, who in the 1990s did much to promote awareness of the history of both Western and Arab sf, and Mahā Mazlūm, author of a 2001 map of Egyptian sf building on structuralism and Bakhtinian chronotopes. A further turning point was in 2007, when a special sf issue of the Egyptian journal al-Fusul was published, devoted mostly to Arab sf. This special issue, along with conferences on the topic in Casablanca and Damascus, engaged with current criticism.\n\nAn acknowledged point of origin for modern Arab sf is Egyptian playwright Tawfiq al-Hakim; in a very long and productive career, plays and fictions mostly dating to the 1950s-60s, sometimes bordering on the absurdist, strongly built on sf tropes, especially rejuvenation and immortality, at times involving complex dystopian and space-travel frames. Partly meant as direct interventions in the domestic public arena like most of his work, al-Hakim’s drama is preoccupied with the disciplining of the sensorium and of human relations (with an arguable awareness of Orwell [115]), and a genuine fascination with space exploration as a metaphor for utopian daydreaming.\n\nThe father-figure of Arab sf was Egyptian author Nihad Sharif, whose 1972 debut novel Qāhir al-zaman [Conqueror of Time] is inspired by Wells (both his sf and his 1942 nonfiction work The Conquest of Time, alluded to in the title). Sharif assimilates to the Arab world a rationalist outlook that breaks with fantastic and dreamlike settings, foregrounding scientific knowledge. The novel is an intricate detection, set in multiple time frames, dealing with a journalist’s discovery of a scientist’s hibernation project as a way to save humanity from the threat of a nuclear war. Although the scientist intends this possible future as utopian, in limiting the benefits of cryosleep to a eugenic selection of the world’s brightest intellects, he displays a hubristic streak reminiscent of Nazism; indeed, the novel is a meditation on the possibilities and dangers of modernity. Sharif is also important in shorter forms, his stories focusing especially on contact with aliens (both explorations and visitations). Some stories also address political themes against the background of the war of 1967, as calls for national awareness. In addressing the Palestinian conflict, Sharif proves more nuanced than what might be the most famous Arab sf novel abroad, the Palestinian Emile Habibi’s The Secret Life of Saeed the Pessoptimist (1974), which, although more surreal satire than sf, gets a mention here. Other novels and stories add gender, pacifism, and religion to Sharif’s repertory. His overall project, Barbaro concludes, is to create a specifically Arab genre aimed at exploring these issues (140).\n\nAnother section surveys in detail the themes of the “challenge to time,” as well as quests for and contacts with “other” spaces, where sf shows, in Barbaro’s view, stronger links to Arab/Muslim culture(s). This is a crowded section, with many parallel readings, in which some names emerging in the 1970s-80s stand out. Moroccan author Muhammad ‘Aziz al-Lahbābī, writing in Arabic and in French, explores reactions to the discovery of an elixir of eternal life. Eternal life features also in Egyptian writer Mustafà Mahmūd, who mixes sf with mystery and the gothic. The only woman in this group, Kuwaiti author Tībah Ahmad al-Ibrāhīm, writes a story of hibernation, with rejuvenation resulting in a tabula rasa of sorts in which family bonds are inverted, a granddaughter becoming a parent figure for her grandfather, who has become a disturbing and estranging figure lacking socialization. Other works by Mahmūd deal with cloning. Egyptian author Sabrī Mūsà is the most consistent dystopian, akin to Huxley in the focus on individuals opposing regimentation thanks to contact with nature (210-16).\n\nThe final part of the book surveys current times. After numerous works focusing on community-building in alien settings, Syrian author Tālib ‘Umrān produced a forceful response to 9/11 in the 2003 sf technothriller al-Azmān al-muzlimah [Dark Times], whose intricate plot stages a contemporary war-on-terror scenario (including a Guantanamo-like setting) and dreams about a threatening future the protagonist tries to prevent. Another crucial contemporary figure is ‘Abd al-Nāsir Muğallī, a prominent Yemeni writer who emigrated to the US in the 1990s; in his short stories, alien places are both estranging mirrors and opportunities to give new shapes to Arab culture. His masterpiece is the 2009 novel Ğuġrāfiyat al-mā’ [Geography of Water], the story of an Arab university biologist working in Michigan who is the first to detect an ominous drop in water levels and discovers that aliens are tapping into Earth’s supply. For the aliens, though, the threat is Earth’s own pollution, while for the Muslim scientist, water stands in for innocence, something that can still be achieved. In its complex, polyphonic structure, this ecocritical novel is the most ambitious piece discussed by Barbaro.\n\nThe study closes with a look at the overall sf scene as, from the mid-late 2000s on, it was emerging in Syria, Egypt, Algeria, Kuwait, and other countries, with magazines providing venues for new writers. Whereas recent tragic events have doomed some endeavors, the Arab scene (including various kinds of diasporic authors writing in other languages) is now an unerasable part of world sf/f. Ada Barbaro’s book deserves an English edition.\n\n—Salvatore Proietti, University of Calabria\n\nImplausible, Baroque, and Surreal.\n\nSimone Caroti. The Culture Series of Iain M. Banks: A Critical Introduction. Jefferson, NC: McFarland, 2015. 252 pp. $40 pbk.\n\nIn this critical study, SimoneCaroti productively analyzes Banks’s effervescent and mordant series about a far-future, post-scarcity utopia called Culture that miraculously remains governed by benevolent hyper-advanced artificial intelligences. Despite Banks’s self-admittedly outré premise, Caroti makes the convincing case that the Culture series deserves serious scholarly study in part for its trailblazing work in developing the millennial sf subgenre popularly known as New Space Opera, where “the emphasis is on space opera as a work of art, an aesthetic construct to be enjoyed precisely because it’s implausible, baroque, and surreal” (156).\n\nIn a tone at once memorial, celebratory, and critical, Caroti’s text bridges biographical criticism based on Banks’s many interviews with chapter-length discussions of the novels, reviews of current criticism, and larger overarching points of contention. In the “Introduction,” Caroti contends that one of the chief merits of the Culture series is the way it deeply questions what constitutes the morally and ethically right thing to do in secular-progressive societies. To this end, the book analyzes the series for its critical-utopian impulses, chapter by chapter addressing each novel in the order of their publishing history. Each chapter also groups the novels in thematic arcs while folding in commentary on the slow accretion of Banks scholarship.\n\nThe first chapter concludes by briefly discussing some of Banks’s mimetic fiction—The Wasp Factory (1984), Walking on Glass (1985), The Bridge (1986), and Complicity (1993)—for the way these novels smuggle in fantastic elements as “Trojan horses” (39). In the second chapter, on Consider Phlebas (1987), Caroti performs an incisive close reading of this first Culture novel, contending that it strategically defies space-opera conventions. If at times notional as opposed to meticulous, the contrast between traditional space operas and the Culture series does serve to highlight Banks’s sophisticated reinvention and debunking of this most despised of sf subgenres. The third chapter examines Banks’s self-avowed use of games as metafictional and moral conceits, analyzing the second Culture novel, The Player of Games (1988). Citing Tom Moylan, Caroti suggests that this novel puts a clever twist on the standard utopian template of the displaced visitor from the present catapulted into a perplexing futuristic utopia.\n\nCaroti organizes the fourth chapter around the recurrence of a specific Culture agent in the novella The State of the Art (1989) and what many consider Banks’s finest Culture novel, Use of Weapons (1990). Although Caroti suggests that many “morality gradients” are at work in the series, he notes that the central ethical strand of The State of the Art is the Culture Mind’s detached excoriation of the neoliberal capitalism that dominates its contemporary Earth setting. Banks’s signature twist is that, unlike the gung-ho militarism of Robert A. Heinlein or Orson Scott Card, his practically pacifist, anti-interventionist novella pivots on the rational decision to reject even making first contact with Earth, let alone the unthinkable atrocity of actually invading. Likewise, Caroti reads Use of Weapons as concerned with the Culture’s involvement in the weaponization of individuals either by pathological war criminals or as proxies in the dirty work of putatively enlightened artificial intelligences. Caroti insists that we take the Culture agent’s caution that “we deal with the moral equivalent of black holes” as high seriousness and not just self-rationalizing camp.\n\nThe fifth chapter discusses the essay “A Few Notes on the Culture” (1994), which Banks wrote during his six-year hiatus from writing the Culture series. Then, following the critic Nick Gevers, the sixth chapter discusses Excession (1996) and Inversion (1999) as companion novels that view the Culture from above and below, respectively. Caroti’s evident admiration of Excession seems warranted given the virtuosity with which the book hybridizes a postmodern multiplicity of genres—space opera, war fiction, romantic comedy, colonial parody, ship-to-ship transcripts between quorums of Culture minds, and a rhapsodic description of exotic, theoretical space-science phenomena such as hyperspace, energy grids, and impossibly sophisticated mathematics. Likewise, Caroti shows that in Inversion, Banks again displays a playful, metafictional use of narrative techniques—for example, found-manuscript textual frames, juxtaposed parallel plot-lines, archaic prose style, and unreliable points of view—to tell a story in which the reader must guess the Culture’s questionable involvement in two medieval kingdoms.\n\nThe penultimate chapter analyzes Look to Windward (2000) as a post-9/11 novel, even though its publication in the UK was a year before the World Trade Center attacks. The novel, respectfully dedicated to the first Gulf War veterans, concerns not only neo-colonial warfare but also the aftermath, justification, and prevention of a terrorist attack on a Culture orbital that will result in gigadeaths; it therefore is unsurprising that when the novel was published in the US in 2001, many American reviewers and readers received the novel as presciently addressing the 9/11 tragedy as it was unfolding. The novel, which ends with a terrorist and a bungling imperialist joining hands to jointly commit suicide in the last light of a dying star, suggests a refusal to settle for easy answers in our contemporary age of terror.\n\nCaroti’s final chapter groups together the last three Culture novels—Matter (2008), Surface Detail (2010), and The Hydrogen Sonata (2012)—as expanding the galaxy of the Culture series with a vaster, more inclusive plurality of alien commonwealths. These topsy-turvy, plot-thick novels unspool shellworlds, sky whales, virtual hells, sentient tattoos, and hyperspace transcendence, all of which Caroti deftly delineates. Throughout these teeming books, as in the series as a whole, Banks remains faithful to his core critical-utopian agenda. Caroti concludes with a brief coda that calls for continued attention to Banks’s fiction by scholars of “utopian studies, political science, sociology, and philosophy” (212) as well as by those who wish to understand Banks holistically, breaking down the boundaries between his mainstream novels and his sf. Indeed, Caroti’s own volume is an excellent first step in that valuable scholarly enterprise.\n\n—Jerome Winter, University of California, Riverside\n\nGothic Devices.\n\nJustin D. Edwards, ed. Technologies of the Gothic in Literature and Culture: Technogothics. New York: Routledge, 2015. 197 pp. $140 hc.\n\nThe essays in Justin Edwards’s collection explore the technologies, broadly defined, associated with the Gothic as a concept and mode. The authors address “Frankensteinesque experiments, Moreauesque hybrids, medical and chemical experimentations, the machinery of Steampunk, prostheses, and technologies of the self” (15). With thirteen short chapters from mostly literary but also cultural-studies, film, and musicology scholars, the collection includes a broad array of approaches to a genre and discourse that for many critics is tied to the origins of sf.\n\nIn contrast to Frankenstein’s monster, the collection is not a malformed amalgamation of misfit appendages. This is not to say that it is seamless either; it does show some signs of scarring. As a stand-alone essay on the topic, Edwards’s introduction is successful and both historically and theoretically informed, citing the most relevant and influential scholars of the Gothic vis-à-vis technology, such as Fred Botting (who opens the collection with his chapter) and Judith/Jack Halberstam. This discussion is supplemented with examples from recognizably Gothic literary texts, such as Frankenstein (1818), along with less obvious examples, such as the original Godzilla (1954). Readers of SFS will likely welcome this synthetic treatment, which includes a brief “cybergothic” reading of the Borg from Star Trek: The Next Generation (1987-94).\n\nEdwards does not lay out an explicit organizational format for the selection and arrangement of the essays, although his introduction does group some of them thematically. The chapters appear to be divided into those pertaining to media, biomedicine, and neoliberalism, along with a final chapter that is more theoretical, with only a few brief references to literary texts. This concluding chapter, “Language Will Eat Your Brain” by Peter Schwenger, while provocative, is not thematically related to any other essays except insofar as it argues that some literatures manage to resist the “zombifying” effects of the self-replicating parasite of language. Edwards’s introduction also never clarifies what he means exactly by the term “technogothics.” Indeed, we do not discover, until we encounter the term again in Rune Graulund’s chapter “Nanodead: The Technologies of Death in Ian McDonald’s Necroville,” that McDonald expressly deployed the term to identify “a mix of science fiction and the Gothic” (128). This lack of coherence in the central concept produces dissonances across the collection.\n\nAt first glance, Edwards’s book seems likely to appeal more to technoculture than to sf scholars. There is, however, significant value in this volume for sf studies, especially given two influential critical views on the relation between the Gothic and sf: Darko Suvin’s suggestion that the two genres should be seen as opposites versus Brian W. Aldiss’s contention that sf was born from the Gothic mode. The two essays in this collection that directly deal with sf texts operate within Aldiss’s framework. Graulund’s “Nanodead,” for example, works through the convergence of nanotechnology and the Gothic in McDonald’s Necroville (1994), ultimately suggesting that nanotech is a contradictory technology: “it points to the past and future” (129). Linnie Blake’s chapter, “Neoliberal Adventures in Neo-Victorian Biopolitics: Mark Hodder’s Burton and Swinburne novels,” articulates how Hodder’s steampunk fiction draws on the imperial Gothic’s focus on degeneration and liminal bodies to critique not only the Victorian imperial project but also contemporary neoliberal politics. In addition, Roger Luckhurst’s chapter, “Biomedical Horror: The New Death and the New Undead,” includes a nuanced discussion of how Gothic tropes and sf “help shape reality” (91; emphasis in original), rather than merely reflecting it in monstrous form, specifically in terms of the liminal construct of brain death.\n\nThree chapters on the topic of biomedicine will also appeal to sf scholars: Sara Wasson’s essay on organ transplant and alienation, Barry Murnane’s related chapter on media narratives of transplant technologies and extended death, and Alan Gregory’s treatment of monstrosity and disability. Murnane’s “George Best’s Dead Livers: Transplanting the Gothic into Biotechnology and Medicine” focuses on the normalization of the uncanny and the abject in modern transplantation and life-extension technologies; in this way, it follows Luckhurst’s suggestion that sf and the Gothic shape our contemporary experience with biomedicine. The five essays on media technologies also have significant implications for sf research. Joseph Crawford’s “Gothic Fiction and Evolutionary Media Technology” provides a concise survey of how the Gothic is intimately entangled with anxieties provoked by new media technologies, a linkage not unfamiliar to sf. Three chapters centering on sound technologies could also spark new avenues of sf inquiry, given the recent prominence of interdisciplinary approaches in sound studies. These chapters will prove particularly fruitful for those working with non-textual sf media, especially film and video games. That said, Kelly Gardner’s essay on zombies and mobile games, “Braaiinnsss!: Zombie-technology, Play, and Sound,” while it offers an enlightening reading of the Gothic and sound in video games, fails to make a strong case for The Walking Dead: Assault (2012) and Plants vs. Zombies (2009) in terms of the media specificity of the mobile phone by contrast with traditional console games.\n\nThese critiques aside, Edwards’s collection is a productive addition to research in Gothic studies, though those looking for a book devoted to a more detailed discussion of the bonds and tensions between the Gothic and sf might be better served by Sara Wasson and Emily Alder’s anthology Gothic Science Fiction: 1980-2010 (2011). As a pedagogical resource, the brevity of the essays in Edwards’s collection allows for easy integration into an undergraduate syllabus; as a whole, the book could serve as an ideal course reader on the subject for more advanced seminars. Clearly, there is no resurgence of the Gothic, as has sometimes been suggested; it never really died but has, instead, continued to live on in the technologies it animates and is animated by.\n\n—Lorenzo Servitje, University of California, Riverside\n\nFatally Underdeveloped.\n\nMichael Grantham. The Transhuman Antihero: Paradoxical Protagonists of Speculative Fiction from Mary Shelley to Richard Morgan. Jefferson, NC: McFarland, 2015. v + 189 pp. $40 pbk.\n\nReading through The Transhuman Antihero, a line from Mad Max: Fury Road (2015) came to me again and again: “Cryin’ shame. Another month, could’ve been your viable human.” Like Splendid Angharad’s baby, this book is terminally premature. Competent, professional academic publishers both demand and support the process of peer review, reorganization, research, and revision that allows dissertations to mature into successful books. McFarland & Company showed no such care in this case, and shipping this fatally underdeveloped book is plain professional negligence.\n\nGrantham’s central question is a good one. “If the promises of transhumanism are to be believed …[,] technoscientific developments will, at some point, provide individuals with the capacity to become smarter and stronger, and to live longer, healthier, and more productive lives.” Yet Grantham notes that transhuman protagonists tend to “openly reject the normative moral and social conventions of social reality [and] enact or espouse undoubtedly immoral and/or extremist ideologies” (1). Why would boosting traits that appear positive and pro-social in themselves consistently lead to antisocial outcomes? This is a tension in the genre that is ripe for fresh analysis. I was especially excited to see Grantham’s final chapters on Richard K. Morgan: locating Morgan within a parabola arcing from Shelley and Stapleton through Bester and Moore seemed like a smart way to move beyond existing scholarship.\n\nUnfortunately, key choices in the way Grantham structures his argument severely limit both the scope and the scholarly relevance of his discussion; these are limitations that any competent peer reviewer would have flagged. Almost all of these issues are on display in this mission statement from the preface: “This book offers a reading of selected examples of the antiheroic transhuman in speculative fiction and examines the duality—transhuman, yet also antiheroic—that renders them paradoxical” (1). First, there is Grantham’s election of “paradoxical” as the key term to think through the relation of “transhuman” to “antihero.” Grantham never explains his choice of “paradoxical,” nor does he give a working definition of it. In his haphazard usage, “paradoxical” indexes any kind of “duality” that features some “blurring” between elements (3). But labeling the particular mixture of transhuman and antisocial as “paradoxical” is symptomatic of Grantham’s biases in this investigation. Grantham’s investigation of transhuman antiheroes proceeds from a position that preemptively rejects as absurd any implication that desires for human perfectibility might entail negative social outcomes. It comes as no surprise, then, that Grantham preemptively absolves transhumanism. “Ultimately, what the paradoxical protagonists come to demonstrate is that while technological development might enable us to transcend the limitations imposed upon the human condition, it won’t enable us to transcend human nature” (1). Here, as throughout The Transhuman Antihero, social and historical analysis is short-circuited by appeals to a transhistorical discourse of morals and essences.\n\nThis leads to the second major limitation: neither the texts nor the Grantham’s “paradoxical” reading of them are located in clear theoretical, historical, or sociopolitical contexts. There is little explanation given for why these examples were chosen over others, how they are connected to each other, or why this reading of them contributes to a larger critical discourse. Are these texts representative or exceptional? Do they trace a line of development or exhibit the recurrence of a stable figure? When did the “paradoxical protagonist” they contain first appear? Grantham’s skeletal introduction gives little guidance on these framing questions, and his chapters do not answer them. Some context filters in from secondary sources, but even then, it doesn’t inform the substance of the argument. This is The Transhuman Antihero’sthird and most fatal limitation. Despite the dutiful literature reviews Grantham provides for his central analytic terms “antihero” (4-7, 79-81) and “transhuman” (7-10, 13-19, 144-49), his application of those terms is so broad as to render them—and so his argument—vague to the point of meaninglessness. When “antiheroic” is applied to any inclination to violent action, resistance to institutional authority, deviation from conventional morality, or inclination to personal weakness or vice, it denotes nothing but an abstract state of moral imperfection. To find it “paradoxical” that literary protagonists—let alone sf ones—might not be morally perfect demands a degree of naïve faith in transhumanist perfectibility that any thorough literature review ought to have dispelled.\n\nThroughout the book, Grantham’s usage of “transhuman” is woefully uninformed. Grantham doesn’t seem to be aware that transhumanism and posthumanism are distinct critical discourses and fundamentally different technopolitical projects. Donna Haraway and N. Katherine Hayles are frequently cited as if they are fellow travelers, rather than critics, of transhumanism. A typical example of this deafness to critical context is Grantham’s breezy assurance that, according to Hayles, “a cyborg is essentially a transhuman and thus superior to human individuals” (103). This displays Gratham’s understanding of transhuman beings not as products of or participants in a distinct philosophical, historical, and political project, but simply as anyone who has gained “skills, powers, abilities, and attributes that far supersede those of everyday individuals” (6). This broad definition specifically elides both the means and ends of that empowerment, as well as the intentionality of the change. In short, it both depoliticizes and aestheticizes superiority in itself. The Transhuman Antihero reproduces the Nietzschean ethics of transhumanism, naturalizing the aesthetics of power at the center of the sf parabola he traces rather than critically interrogating it.\n\nEach of The Transhuman Antihero’sseven chapters is fatally compromised by these limitations. The first, on Shelley’s Frankenstein (1818), makes sense as a dissertation chapter but serves no purpose in a critical volume: it is neither succinct nor comprehensive enough to serve as a teaching text, nor original enough to contribute to existing scholarship. The second chapter gives a Nietzschean reading of Olaf Stapleton’s Odd John (1935), Theodore Sturgeon’s More Than Human (1953), and Alfred Bester’s The Stars my Destination (1957). While competent, these readings contribute little to the overall argument. How are the Nietzschean ethics of human overcoming in these texts related to contemporary social, political, economic, and technological developments? How do these readings build on the discussion of Shelley or set up the discussions in subsequent chapters? These are questions a competent editor would have demanded the chapter address before going to press.\n\nThe next two chapters focus on the work of Alan Moore, examining V for Vendetta (1988-89) and Watchmen (1986-87),respectively. The discussion of V is a derivative mess, but the chapter on Watchmen contains one of the strongest moments in the book: Grantham’s discussion of how vanilla humans Nite Owl, Silk Spectre, Rorschach, and the Comedian illustrate M.P. Woolf’s definition of antiheroic fiction as the drama of abject individuals coping within a society they cannot understand and do not have the power to meaningfully influence. In contrast, Grantham’s discussion of the superhuman Dr. Manhattan is a meandering rehash of established theological readings of the character. Perversely, Watchmen’sonly genuine transhuman, Adrian Veidt, receives only a half-page of attention.\n\nThe fifth chapter offers an uneven overview of cyberpunk that is inadequate to serve as a standalone chapter in a published volume. While addressing the central role of Jameson, Baudrillard, and Suvin in cyberpunk criticism means Grantham has to situate cyberpunk as a literature of late capitalism, most of the chapter remains within an individualistic, moralizing framework that reads the “drugs, violence, theft, and vice” in the genre as evidence of antiheroic moral imperfection (101). At the same time, the importance of film noir and detective fiction as influences on cyberpunk goes unacknowledged, with dire ramifications for the subsequent discussion of Morgan’s work.\n\nThis deeply flawed construal of cyberpunk sets up the final chapters, focused on the post-cyberpunk sf of Richard K. Morgan. Chapter six, on the Takeshi Kovacs series (2002-2005), adds little to existing scholarship by Paweł Frelik, Graham Murphy, and Sherryl Vint. Having ignored cyberpunk’s indebtedness to pulp and noir, Grantham misreads Morgan’s emphasis on amorality, violence, and revenge as a radical departure rather than a return to the genre’s taproots. The final chapter offers a comically literal take on Black Man (2007, a.k.a. Thirteen) that is totally deaf to satire and hyperbole. Grantham excessively quoted Alan Moore interviews in earlier chapters, but here he leaves out Morgan’s consistent description of his work as dramatizing how “violence is never actually a solution to anything…. [S]ometimes it happens, and sometimes it’s unavoidable, sometimes it feels good even, but the truth of the matter is it’s not a good thing” (Jason B. Jones, “An Interview with Richard Morgan,” Clarksworld [Sep. 2008]). One can argue about the extent to which Morgan’s fiction critiques rather than simply performs violent masculinity, but it takes a truly myopic approach to read Black Man and come out arguing, as Grantham does, that the novel’s “hyper-masculine posturing … is not without credibility. Violence and aggression are not simply the means by which one demonstrates superior strength over another, but the catalyst for social, political, scientific, and philosophical progress” (166). This sentence is the closest we get to the politics animating The Posthuman Antihero,because thescanty four-page summary that concludes the book gives no synthesis or closure.\n\nI do not object to this volume simply because I disagree with The Transhuman Antihero’s politics. I am objecting to the implicitness of those politics. It is impossible, in fact, to debate Grantham’s project on a political level when confronted with all the slippages and lacunae of structure and terminology. I don’t think I would have agreed with Grantham’s conclusions in a reworked and revised version of this book,but it would have—and should have—been a productive and provocative contribution to critical conversation about transhumanism in sf, the springboard to a substantive debate. I look forward to seeing Grantham’s work in other venues, where his ideas receive the editorial support they deserve. By neglecting to help scholars refine and develop their arguments, the publisher McFarland is failing the sf community as a whole.\n\n—Joshua Pearson, University of California, Riverside\n\nCosmic Watergate.\n\nAaron John Gulyas. The Paranormal and the Paranoid: Conspiratorial Science Fiction Television. Lanham, MD: Rowman and Littlefield, 2015. xv + 179 pp. $75 hc.\n\nAaron John Gulyas’s book focuses on the culture of conspiracy and belief in the paranormal that fed into sf television during the 1990s. Gulyas argues that society was primed for a period of such dark, sinister works by previous decades of government cover-ups such as Watergate, the Iran-Contra affair, and the many conspiracy theories surrounding UFO sightings and alien abductions. Gulyas begins by stating that his book is “neither solely about science fiction television in the 1990s nor just about conspiracy and paranormal culture but rather about the interconnections and the sporadic but significant dialogue and interplay between the two” (xiii)—and Gulyas does convincingly outline the dialogue between these areas.\n\nThe book begins by describing the cultural forces that inspired the 1990s boom in conspiratorial television, particularly UFO conspiracy culture. Chapter one discusses prominent UFO theories and abduction stories, including the Roswell crash and the abductions of Betty and Barney Hill. The chapter also looks into organizations that focus on UFO sightings and cover-ups, such as NICAP (National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena) and the governmental organization MJ-12. Gulyas dubs all of the cover-ups and government conspiracies regarding UFOs “Cosmic Watergate,” a term referring to a general atmosphere of cultural paranoia that came to permeate sf television during the 1990s. Prior to this time, tv shows such as The Twilight Zone (1959-64), The Outer Limits (1963-65), and Unsolved Mysteries (1987-2002) produced episodes that dealt with UFOs, alien abductions, and government conspiracies, setting the stage for later treatments.\n\nGulyas’s decade of conspiratorial and paranormal television begins in 1993 with the debut of the X-Files (1993-2002) and ends in 2001 with the collapse of the Twin Towers. The X-Files is the quintessential paranoid and paranormal sf show of the 1990s, and it remains the focal point throughout Gulyas’s book. Every other show mentioned in the text hinges upon or emerges from The X-Files. Throughout the book, Gulyas examines various shows in relation to real-life events that manifested the mood of suspicion and paranoia pervading American society. Aside from the X-Files, Gulyas examines many other shows including Dark Skies (1996-97), various episodes and thematic elements from Star Trek: The Next Generation (1987-94), Star Trek: Deep Space Nine (1993-99), and Star Trek: Voyager (1995-2001), as well as Chris Carter’s Millennium (1996-99), The Pretender (1996-2000), and The Lone Gunmen (2001). Gulyas does an excellent job tying together the shows and the culture that inspired them. His focus on the paranormal, however, remains largely on UFOlogy, although he occasionally delves into the world of supernatural cults and Satanism.\n\nIn the end, one may question the real cultural impact on mainstream society of conspiracy theories and UFOlogy. Were they as prominent as Gulyas suggests? Gulyas argues that the rise of television programming that focused on the paranormal and the conspiratorial suggests the popularity of such ideas; yet the fulcrum of his argument, as noted, is the X-Files. Many of the other programs, such as Dark Skies and Millennium, had very brief runs, and Harsh Realm (1999) lasted only three episodes. Gulyas does touch on the wildly popular Star Trek series; he only analyzes isolated episodes, however, that contain conspiratorial themes. In the final analysis, The X-Files was the start, the climax, and the end of the conspiratorial and paranormal boom that Gulyas discusses, which suggests that conspiratorial thinking may not have been as pervasive or powerful as Gulyas would have us believe. When the Twin Towers came down, the cultural focus shifted to issues of terrorism and global conflict, and conspiracy-theory television went into decline. All in all, despite its limitations, Gulyas’s book offers some provocative insights into the brief heyday of paranormal conspiracies in sf television.\n\n—Sarah M. Gawronski, University of Louisiana at Lafayette\n\nTo Be or Not To Be: This Is the Metaphor.\n\nCarlos Gutiérrez-Jones. Suicide and Contemporary Science Fiction. New York: Cambridge UP, 2015. xii + 192 pp. $90 hc.\n\nThe premise of this volume seems rather peculiar at first: why suicide and sf? A grim and morally problematic topic, suicide seems more at home in realist fiction. Indeed, the most famous literary suicides, from Anna Karenina to Arkady Svidrigailov in Crime and Punishment (1866),are firmly embedded in the psychological exploration of regret and despair, focusing on the individual rather than the world. Sf, an “ontological” genre, more concerned with the external rather than the internal, seems ill-suited for such an exploration. Gutiérrez-Jones’s study does have an explanation for its premise but it arrives at this explanation by a circuitous route. To begin with, the author claims that he is more interested in suicide than in sf. He frankly concedes that his engagement with sf theory and criticism is limited and superficial: the book “does not offer a new theory of science fiction, nor does it provide a comprehensive history of the genre” (18).\n\nBut his definition of suicide is “science-fictional”: he regards self-destruction as a strategy for coping with the Other. Moving beyond the contemporary therapeutic approach, in which suicide is seen chiefly as a symptom of mental illness, Gutierrez-Jones reaches back to Emile Durkheim’s sociological study and Georges Minois’s investigation into the history and significance of self-killing to suggest that suicide may be a way to transcend cultural or ontological limits. He proposes a paradoxical definition of “the creative self-destruction,” in which an (aborted) suicide becomes the occasion for characters in crisis to reinvent or “reboot” themselves in order to meet new challenges (7).\n\nThe book discuses a number of key sf texts, from H.G. Wells’s The Island of Dr. Moreau (1897) to Stanislaw Lem’s Solaris (1961) and Margaret Atwood’s Maddaddam trilogy (2003-2013), to show how this process of self-reinvention through self-destruction is triggered by the protagonist’s confrontation with the Other. Particularly interesting in this context is Gutierrez-Jones’s appropriation of Philip Fisher’s taxonomy of “rare experiences,” which draws a distinction between the sublime and the sense of wonder: the sublime is “the anesthetization of fear,” while wonder is “the anesthetization of delight” (28-29). This offers a useful framework for conceptualizing the trajectory of Kris Kelvin in Solaris,as Hari’s suicide shatters his helplessness and hostility toward the Ocean and propels him toward the acceptance of further “cruel miracles” (unfortunately, Gutierrez-Jones follows the old translation of the novel in which Hari is called Rheya). The sense of wonder may be seen as “modulating between self and other” and, as such, is necessary for the character confronted with the radical Other of sf. Suicide, then, becomes the ultimate rejection of anthropomorphism, in which an attempt to destroy oneself separates the would-be suicide from “defensive, solipsistic humanness” and opens him/her up to the wonder of the universe (45).\n\nThis general scheme is applied to a selection of sf texts, each chapter focusing on one novel or one author (with the exception of Chapter 4, which stands apart because it deals with two films: Christopher Nolan’s Inception [2010] and Rian Johnson’s Looper [2012]). The discussion of Solaris is the best in the book because suicide is an explicit theme in Lem’s novel. Hari is a suicidal copy of the suicidal original, and Gutierrez-Jones presents a strong argument linking the dynamics of self-destruction with Kelvin’s transcendence of the strictures of bureaucratic science.\n\nThe discussion of Wells’s Moreau, on the other hand, has more to say about the conflict between anthropomorphism and evolutionary theory than about suicide. The reading of Wells’ novel abounds in illuminating insights, such as the juxtaposition of Wells’s portrayal of the human/animal divide with Gustave Moreau’s famous painting Oedipus and the Sphynx (1864). Considering the important role the sphinx plays in Wells’s imaginative universe (e.g., the White Sphinx of The Time Machine [1895]), this juxtaposition is both startling and logical. Moreau’s name, echoing the name of the famous painter, becomes a clue to the powerful challenge the novel issues to the Victorian belief in human superiority to animals. But the relevance of suicide to this challenge is dubious, not least because Prendick is such a problematic narrator. His response to his experiences on Moreau’s island testifies to an unresolved trauma rather than to any decisive transformation. While he declares his willingness to kill himself several times, it seems to be more an hysterical posturing than an actual determination. Suicide is a side issue in the novel, no matter how much Gutierrez-Jones tries to move it to the center.\n\nSimilar problems occur in other chapters. Where the author’s discussion is most illuminating, it seems to have little to do with his overarching theme; and where suicide comes to the fore, it obscures the actual content of the text. The engaging analysis of William Gibson’s Neuromancer (1984), for example (originally published in SFS in 2014), focuses on issues of “kinship” between humans and AIs and the ways in which the tension between the disdain for the body and the need for physical connection plays out in the novel’s depiction of cyberculture. But apart from the dubious inference that Case’s risk-taking is “suicidal,” there is little to connect this tension to the problematic of self-destruction. The situation is somewhat different in the chapter on Inception because a dream suicide is indeed a means of waking up in the movie’s plot. Thus, suicide becomes part of the movie’s complex web of epistemological uncertainty and ontological collapse, in which dreams are commodified into “mediascapes.” But since we do not know whether the protagonist’s “awakening” at the end is real, suicide as a conduit to an existential transformation is itself problematized, along with all the other components of the movie’s fictional world.\n\nUltimately, in my view, Gutierrez-Jones’s book both succeeds and fails in a way different from what the theoretical introduction leads one to expect. The author makes it clear that his goal is not to make a significant contribution to sf theory; rather, he is using the genre as a way to explicate his concept of “creative self-destruction.” And yet his readings of individual sf texts, even such classics as Solaris and Neuromancer, are often fresh and exciting, integrating an overview of existing criticism with a new perspective. On the other hand, in these discussions, suicide retreats into the background, relegated to a minor detail or reduced to a vague metaphor for risk-taking.\n\nPerhaps the problem originates in the very definition of suicide that underpins the study. In order to function as a catalyst for self-reinvention, suicide, by definition, has to be unsuccessful. When Anna Karenina kills herself, her eponymous novel comes to an end. In all the texts Gutierrez-Jones discusses, the protagonist goes on living after his literal or metaphorical attempt at self-destruction. Prendick, no matter how traumatized, survives the island; Kelvin does not follow Hari’s example; Case continues more or less as usual after his inadvertent creation of the godlike Wintermute; and the protagonists of Inception and Looper are forced by Hollywood conventions into some sort of happy ending. If indeed “suicidal crises may provide an opportunity to break with problematic habits of thought and feeling” (152), what makes them suicidal rather than simply crises? The author convincingly demonstrates how an encounter with the Other can shift the worldview of an sf character from fear to wonder. But it seems to me a little too extreme to call this shift suicide.\n\n—Elana Gomel, University of Tel-Aviv\n\nTranshumanism and Its Ethical Dilemmas.\n\nGilbert Hottois, Jean-Noël Missa, and Laurence Perbal, eds. Encylopédie du trans/posthumanisme: L’humain et ses préfixes [The Human and its Prefixes: An Encyclopedia of Trans/Posthumanism]. Paris: Editions Vrin, 2015. 512 pp. €28 pbk.\n\nAt the Twelfth World Conference on Bioethics in Mexico in 2014, Belgian philosopher Gilbert Hottois presented his vision of transhumanism in a talk entitled “Is transhumanism a humanism?” In it, he contended that transhumanism “provides the possibility to articulate, in a coherent way, a wide range of ideas and issues: anthropological, epistemological, ethical, political, and even ontological.” The encyclopedic endeavor of this new book, directed by Hottois and two researchers at the CRIB (Center of Interdisciplinary Research in Bioethics at the University of Bruxelles), L’Humain et ses préfixes [The Human and its Prefixes] mirrors this constructive and multidisciplinary approach to current transhumanism that “rejects fanaticism, intolerance, superstition and dogmatism.” (These quotations derive from Hottois’s 2014 talk, which can be viewed online on Vimeo.) This encyclopedia presents the facts about and ethical questions raised by today’s technoscientific innovations. It is an ambitious project, and despite some organizational and stylistic problems, it is a successful one.\n\nL’Humain et ses préfixes reads like a book of wonders, each chapter telling an episode of human innovation and the power of imagination. The volume combines technical descriptions, philosophical probes, and artistic explorations to offer a widescale, but not diluted, picture of how technoscientific applications reconfigure, challenge, and enhance the human body. The concept of the human constantly changes as each innovation “pose la question éthique de la transgression des limites naturelles” [asks the ethical question of the transgression of natural boundaries] (67). Thus, the reader will not find a fixed definition of the human or an exhaustive definition of transhumanism; rather, the book offers several definitions from different angles of interpretation. The focus throughout is on the facts and potential outcomes of technoscientific innovation.\n\nThe counterpart of a wide range of approaches and topics is an arbitrary categorization of all entries into three parts: Philosophie et éthique, Technoscience et médecine d’amélioration, and Techniques, arts et science-fiction [Philosophy and Ethics, Technoscience and Enhancement Medicine, and Techniques, Arts, and Science Fiction]. This seeming separation of techniques and their ethical “counterparts” is surprising because the theme of ethics permeates the book from beginning to end. As a result, there are redundancies. For example, the second entry in Part One discusses “Anthropotechnie,” while Part Two starts with “Amélioration-Enhancement.” Anthropotechnie and enhancement refer to the same concept—the medical techniques used to augment the human body. Some information is repeated. Moreover, the author of “Amélioration-Enhancement” starts his first paragraph by dismissing the term anthropotechnie because, he says, it is rarely used in practice. These inherent contradictions are two-sided: one can read them as a weakness in the book or more generously as a dialogue between articles and authors that underscores and performs the contentious nature of all technoscientific concepts.\n\nWhat are transhumanism and posthumanism? The introduction presents the transhuman subject as “un humain en transition cherchant à transcender son humanité” [a human being in transition who is looking to transcend his or her humanity] (8). The article “Posthumain” places it in a historical trajectory:\n\nle transhumanisme s’impose, malgré le disparate de ses versions, comme le symptôme de la démesure moderniste et la tentative pour lui donner une issue: être moderne, c’était en un premier temps «vouloir le perfectionnement indéfini», mais bientôt ce fut «vouloir l’augmentation des facultés innées», et c’est à présent «vouloir être relevé par les machines» [transhumanism, despite its many versions, is a symptom of modernist excessiveness and the attempt to provide an outcome for it: to be modern meant first “wanting indefinite improvement,” but soon became “wanting to enhance innate abilities,” and now means “wanting to be replaced by machines”] (108).\n\nThis entry is a good example of the varied viewpoints on transhumanist techniques, whether cognitive enhancement, robotics, prosthetics, doping, or nanotechnology. The discussion opens up to infinite applications in terms of well-being and better-being, as well as the dangerous excesses they can unleash; it also epitomizes the genealogical approach developed in many other articles. Indeed, one of the strengths of this book is the wealth of background information on technoscientific realities we no longer question because they are now part of our daily lives (e.g. doping, plastic surgery, body-building).\n\nPosthumanism, the book suggests, still has to be defined because “aucune homogénéité doctrinale ne se dessine dans les courants intellectuels qui en admettent la référence et la dignité conceptuelle” [one finds no homogeneous doctrine in intellectual circles that accepts the term and its conceptual integrity] (106). One must understand the concept as a continuity from human to transhuman to posthuman, without a clear breaking point between each stage (167). Posthumanism is thus a form of the transcendence of the human (8). On a darker note, according to Hottois, it can also feed the apocalyptic imagination and thus “flirte avec le nihilisme” [flirt with nihilism] (8).\n\nThere are fifty-nine articles in the encyclopedia, from the expected “Transhumanisme,” “Chirurgie esthétique” [Plastic surgery], and “Cyberpunk” (respectively in Parts One, Two, and Three), to the lesser known “Neuroéthique” [Neuro-Ethics], “Mutation,” and “Technopsychédélisme” [Techno-Psychedelia]. The authors of technical articles succeed in presenting information in ways that invite the reader into their fields of research. As mentioned earlier, articles come in different styles, approaches, and lengths. Most entries by Pierre-Frédéric Daled are opaque, notably because he uses too many quotes without context or analysis, which makes it difficult to understand him without a solid philosophical background. “Mutation” is two pages long, while “Prolongation de la vie” [Prolongation of life] runs to eighteen pages. Oddly, the topic of doping is divided into four separate articles by three different authors.\n\nDespite these awkward organizational choices, the quality of the content is undeniable. There are many wonderful articles in this book, not all pertaining to the technical aspects of transhumanism such as nanotechnologies and cyberbodies. The article “Corps humain” [Human body] is a clear and organized discussion of the history of and quandaries surrounding a concept that has changed much throughout the ages. As the author rightly puts it: “Rien de plus « naturel » que le corps, et rien de moins « naturel » [Nothing is more “natural” than the body and nothing is less “natural” than the body] (46). This quote underlines the intrinsic volatility of the term “natural.” In the third part, longtime readers of science fiction might not learn much from the entry “Science-fiction” or “Cyberpunk.” However, the articles “Art et Bio-corps” and “Art et Techno-corps” [“Art and Bio-body” and “Art and Techno-body”] offer interesting perspectives on the issues sf also explores. Indeed, the author of both entries, Chloé Pirson, supplies many references to contemporary transhumanist art forms by visual and plastic artists around the world and offers excellent in-depth analysis of several art pieces.\n\nWhat will become of the human body is not only the business of scientists, philosophers, and artists. L’Humain et ses préfixes makes clear that transhumanism is omnipresent. Although we cannot know what the human body will look like, what it will do, or what it will think thousands of years from now, the changing process has already begun and it touches us all.\n\n—Annabelle Dolidon, Portland State University\n\nExploring Contemporary Italian SF.\n\nGiulia Iannuzzi. Distopie, viaggi spaziali, allucinazioni: Fantascienza italiana contemporanea [Dystopias, Space Voyages, Hallucinations: Contemporary Italian Science Fiction]. Milan: Mimesis, 2015. 363 pp. €30 pbk.\n\nThis dense monograph by Giulia Iannuzzi came as a surprise. What I was expecting was the second volume of her Fantascienza italiana: Riviste, autori, dibattiti dagli anni Cinquanta agli anni Settanta [Italian SF: Magazines, Authors, Debates from the 1950s to the 1970s], also published by Mimesis in 2014, which mapped the complex world of Italian sf magazines from 1952 to 1980. By focusing on the story of six important Italian magazines, that volume offered readers a widescale and well-wrought picture of the history of Italian sf before 1980, showing how narrative models were imported, mostly through translations, to be assimilated, reused, and mutated by Italian writers. Iannuzzi thus showed that the Italian sf tradition cannot be understood in terms of a nation-based model of literary history but rather must be seen as a non-linear story of chasms and geological faults, where the development of science-fictional devices and narratives is absolutely not self-contained. No wonder, then, that some of the key figures in this story (e.g., Vittorio Curtoni or Roberta Rambelli) were translators—that is, cultural mediators who grafted English-language scientific imagination onto a culture whose models were the ancient Greek and Roman classics, the great authors of the Italian middle ages, plus the French, German, and Russian modern classics.\n\nIannuzzi’s Fantascienza italiana was a welcome contribution to the study of Italian sf, a field in which solid academic works are rare and amateur critics abound; and in the Italian scene, divided by a spirit of campanilismo [excessive civic pride], non-academic critics and experts all too often tend to overestimate the importance of local heroes and downplay or ignore the achievements of authors from other parts of the country (or belonging to other groups of an exceedingly sectarian fandom). What was needed was a balanced picture depicting all the threads of Italian sf’s complex tapestry, and Iannuzzi began to paint it with her Fantascienza italiana. Yet Distopie, viaggi spaziali, allucinazioni is not the second part of her history of Italian sf magazines; this time, the focus is on four authors who have played an important role in the development of Italian sf and sf in Italy.\n\n[Contemporary Italian SF: Historical and Critical Frame], presents us with an 80-page overview of Italian sf from its origins to the present day. Iannuzzi suggests Dante’s Divine Comedy (1320)and Ariosto’s Orlando Furioso (1532) as forerunners, notwithstanding that the former’s spaceflight is allegorical and the latter has more to do with heroic fantasy than sf. What follows, however, is a good introduction to the history of sf in Italy, covering literature, cinema, and television, and proving Iannuzzi’s wide-ranging knowledge of both primary and secondary literature (including up-to-date English-language academic criticism). Iannuzzi competently covers the field of Italian sf, also depicted by Salvatore Proietti in the introductory overview included in the July 2015 SFS special issue on the subject; of course, having a lot more canvas than Proietti (his survey was fourteen pages long), she can tell the multi-faceted and non-linear story of how Italian sf was incubated and born at a more leisurely pace. Interestingly, she details how this development did not follow an autonomous line of growth but was repeatedly subject to the influence of external forces, such as the politics of cultural autarchia [self-sufficiency] enforced by the Fascist regime during the 1930s or the abrupt exposure to the sf produced in the United States and United Kingdom after 1945. Iannuzzi shows quite clearly that the consecutive waves of English-language sf (from the Golden Age to cyberpunk) turned into shockwaves that hit Italy and deeply affected the core community of sf fans and practitioners, the wider readership of the genre, and the publishing industry.\n\nIannuzzi also discusses how Italian sf survived in a tremendously hostile cultural environment, ostracized by academia, ignored or ignorantly berated by non-academic literary critics, snubbed by the most prestigious presses. Distopie puts the blame on the anti-scientific bent of Italian culture, plus the hostility towards non-realistic genres of the two strongest cultural traditions in post-WWII Italy—the Roman Catholic Church and the Communist Party. The lack of a scholarly community focused on sf made the situation even worse—though there were interesting episodes, especially in the late 1970s and early 1980s, accurately recorded by Iannuzzi.\n\nThe introduction is followed by four monographic chapters dealing with four representative figures of Italian sf: Lino Aldani (1926-2009), Gilda Musa (1926-1999), Vittorio Curtoni (1949-2011), and Vittorio Catani (1940- ). Of course, this is only a brief sample of the Italian sf canon (ifsuch a canon really exists); yet these four writers are representative enough, as they are both sf authors and sf critics (Aldani and Curtoni), editors (Curtoni and Catani), or translators (Curtoni). Musa, on the other hand, is, as we shall see, both an interesting author and part of a complex network of sf experts, editors, practitioners, etc., so that Iannuzzi can present readers with a whole literary environment through her portrait of the author.\n\nChapter two is devoted to Lino Aldani, considered “the father of Italian sf,” not only for his stories and novels, but for having written the first Italian book-length critical discussion of sf, La fantascienza [Science Fiction, 1962]. Iannuzzi does not offer readers a complete overview of Aldani’s oeuvre but focuses on a selection of his short stories and novels, preceded by a short biographical introduction; hers is a thematic approach, as she explains in the introductory section of this chapter, by pointing out three main directions in Aldani’s fiction: “[one] of adventurous sf, of revisited space opera; a dystopian direction, of sociopolitical reflection on modernity and its perspectives, often carried out in a satirical key; an introspective direction that tackles the unease of modernity from the point of view of the single individual and often comes to deal with the theme of madness” (103). Iannuzzi first manages to show how Aldani initially refashioned classical sf plots and devices coming from the English-language tradition; she then discusses short stories in which Aldani proves to have learned the lesson of the sociological sf of the 1950s, applying it to the fast-changing society of the Italian economic miracle (1950-63)—a tumultuous period of industrialization with deep and tearing contradictions. Then she tackles a few stories in which Aldani focuses on the issue of psychopathology as a by-product of modern society, plus the novel La croce di ghiaccio [The Ice Cross, 1989], where the theme of madness is tied up with religion. The story of a Roman Catholic missionary visiting other planets, the novel echoes James Blish’s A Case of Conscience (1958) and Ray Bradbury’s story “In This Sign” (1951). Iannuzzi correctly suggests J.G. Ballard as an important influence on Aldani, especially in his 1963 short story “Nemico invisibile” [Invisible enemy]; had she dealt with Eclissi 2000 (1979), which draws much from Ballard’s “Thirteen to Centaurus” (1962), she might have better depicted how Aldani managed to rework, in an original way, the narratives of the British author. She has, however, managed to show how Aldani’s career ran parallel to the evolution of Italian sf from the early 1960s to the 1990s, providing readers with a solid and extensive introduction to the author’s fictional worlds, and offering several interesting interpretive insights.\n\nChapter three contains a discussion of Gilda Musa, a very interesting figure who deserves more critical attention. Aldani was a math teacher in secondary schools, but Musa was educated in the humanities and had a more cosmopolitan upbringing, having graduated in Milan but then specialized in German literature at Heidelberg and English literature at Cambridge. Before starting to write sf, she was a respected poet, translated Brecht and Wiechert, and married writer, critic, screenwriter, and editor Inisero Cremaschi (1928-2014), who introduced her to a network of literati and intellectuals. No wonder that the magazine her husband edited, Futuro, strove to publish literarily conscious sf and to involve such renowned authors/critics as Libero Bigiaretti or Mario Soldati in the debate on sf and its artistic value (163).\n\nInterestingly, in the February 1978 issue of the Italian sf magazine Robot, a short story by Musa, “Gli ex-bambini” [The Former Children, 1978] was published with the translation of Ursula K. Le Guin’s story “Intracom” (1974) and James Tiptree Jr./Alice Sheldon’s “The Women Men Don’t See” (1973). The names of these three female writers are printed large on the cover of the issue so that a connection among them is evidently suggested by the editor, Vittorio Curtoni: specifically, their common interest in the theme of contact with alien species and its transcultural dimension. Most of Musa’s short stories and novels discussed by Iannuzzi deal with the contact/clash between humans and alien species, in a fashion that reminds readers of Le Guin’s anthropological approach to this theme. Musa is also interested—just like Le Guin—in ecology; her style is as elegant and only apparently simple as Sheldon’s; and the three writers use alien civilizations as touchstones to expose the ills and contradictions of humankind.\n\nIannuzzi also discusses “Trenta colonne di zeri” [Thirty Columns of Zeroes, 1964], an interesting variation on the theme of the insane spaceman that stands comparison with the treatment of this figure by such authors as John Wyndham, James E. Gunn, and Ballard. And I am grateful to her for having made me discover Musa’s first sf short story, “Memoria totale” [Total Memory, 1963], an impressive stylistic tour de force that uncannily anticipates one of Philip K. Dick’s best stories, “The Electric Ant” (1969). Musa, who is relatively neglected today, represents a very interesting case study illustrating how Italian sf writers managed to import themes, devices, and ideas from US and UK works and refashion them in original ways.\n\nThe fourth chapter deals with Vittorio Curtoni, arguably an inescapable choice. The role he played as editor and translator of English-language sf into Italian was absolutely crucial. Suffice it to say that in a time when Urania—the most important sf paperback series—often cut the translations of US and UK sf novels to fit its size, Curtoni published integral translations in the paperback series he edited with Montanari, Galassia. Moreover, Galassia published those New Wave writers (e.g., John Brunner, Dick, Samuel R. Delany, Roger Zelazny, Thomas M. Disch, Barry N. Malzberg) who had been banned by the editors of Urania, Carlo Fruttero and Franco Lucentini. Moreover, Curtoni was the editor of Robot, a short-lived (1976-79) magazine that accepted works also by Italian authors and hosted important discussions on sf in general and the peculiarities of Italian sf in particular. In comparison with Curtoni’s activity as a translator and editor, his literary production pales; yet his only novel, Dove stiamo volando [Where Are We Flying, 1972], a gloomy post-holocaust story of persecuted mutants, is representative of the taste of a decade—the 1970s—characterized by an atmosphere of impending (political, social, economic, environmental, demographic) catastrophe.\n\nCurtoni’s best works are his stories, however, and the selection of short fiction discussed by Iannuzzi is well chosen. Once again, Curtoni manages to draw much from the American authors he translated and successfully “applies” them to the Italian scene; his narratives are often embittered and haunted by an overwhelming pessimism that surely has much to do with the grim atmosphere of a country torn by political terrorism, but also with the declining popularity of sf itself (the end of Robot due to insufficient sales in 1979 being part of this story). Curtoni’s bleak tales mirror those years in a vivid manner: hence, one wishes that Iannuzzi had gone deeper into the political aspects of his fiction. Though this chapter is scattered with hints at the social, political, and historical context of Italy in the 1960s and 1970s, no organic connection is made between the stories and their wider sociopolitical context. A paradox that should have been explored is the undeniable fact that Curtoni’s fiction is imbued with anti-Americanism, yet he was powerfully influenced by American authors (Malzberg first and foremost). May this be just a matter of distinguishing the (evil) American imperialism of the Cold War era from the (good) American counterculture? A more in-depth discussion of this aspect of the author’s work would have been appreciated.\n\nThe fifth chapter deals with the only living author, Vittorio Catani, even though at 76 he cannot be considered as belonging to a “new” generation. Probably Iannuzzi, by choosing authors whose lives began even before the term fantascienza was invented in 1952, aimed at discussing four figures endowed with an established reputation, whose long careers allowed the scholar to go back over the history of Italian sf. As for Catani, one must necessarily underscore the fact that he is the first winner of the Premio Urania with his 1990 novel Gli universi di Moras [Moras’s Universes], a solid story of alternate realities set in the region where the author lives, Apulia.\n\nCatani, who published his first stories in the early 1960s, also gives Iannuzzi the opportunity to deal with themes and problems of the twenty-first century, especially in her discussion of his latest novel, Il quinto principio [The Fifth Principle, 2009]: “In his longest work, Catani has depicted a remarkably large scenario, rich in details and inventions on every scale, from the macroscopic dynamics of global economic markets to the technologies we use every day” (300). Drawing from his knowledge of finance (Catani worked as a bank manager), from the discourses about globalization and late capitalism, from the projections of cyberpunk, and from the forecasts about global warming and water scarcity (the novel features a tycoon who manages to purchase Antarctica for 1025 Euros), Catani depicts a not-very-far future world by means of a novel whose multiple plots span the globe, with a believable display of technologies that may be under development today.\n\nIannuzzi stresses Catani’s interest, during the course of his 50-year career, in both the “hard” and the “soft” sciences (something that differentiates him from the other three writers, who generally favored the latter, or even the humanities). She also examines the political implications of his stories and novels and the recurring theme of sexuality (often graphically depicted). As in the previous chapters, Iannuzzi does not claim to have offered a complete overview of Catani’s oeuvre, yet her choices allow readers to picture it quite accurately. What is sometimes missing is a connection with the wider realm of world sf (especially English-language sf, which exerted such a powerful influence on the generation of Catani and Curtoni); for example, when Iannuzzi discusses Catani’s 2006 short story “Sboccerà il crisantemo” [The Chrysanthemum Will Bloom], she does not reconnect it to its quite evident model, Robert Silverberg’s 1974 novelette “Born with the Dead,” which Catani managed to rework in a rather original fashion (especially the ending).\n\nA very short chapter of final remarks makes Iannuzzi’s purpose in writing her monograph explicit: her aim is “to prove … the general capacity of the science-fictional repertoire to lend itself to a constant, fecund rewriting, in which the value and purpose of single works depend on the ability and the will of each author” (329): that is, to show the literary and cultural potential of the genre. Evidently such an inquiry is addressed to the general public and, above all, to Italian academia, which has not shown much interest in Italian sf so far. No wonder that the foreword to the volume, “Archeologie del futuro” [Archaeologies of the Future] has been written by Pierpaolo Antonello, an Italian studies scholar who teaches at the University of Cambridge.\n\nAll in all, Iannuzzi’s monograph (like her previous book, Fantascienza italiana) is a precious contribution to the study of sf in Italy. This is a fair-minded, well-documented, scholarly, and reliable monograph.\n\n—Umberto Rossi, Rome\n\nA Blurring of Themes and Genres.\n\nEdward James. Lois McMaster Bujold. MODERN MASTERS OF SCIENCE FICTION. Urbana: U of Illinois P, 2015. xiii + 201 pp. $85 hc; $25 pbk.\n\nAs a literary form, science fiction has gradually worked its way into the global networks of academic discourse, but its infiltration has not prevented the persistence of certain head-scratching exclusions. Nowhere is this more apparent than with Lois McMaster Bujold, who has won four Hugo Awards for best novel (an achievement matched only by Robert A. Heinlein) and attracted a far-reaching, dedicated fan base, all while remaining largely ignored by academic critics. Some authors and texts are overlooked for understandable—if not entirely justifiable—reasons. This is not the case with Bujold, something Edward James makes abundantly clear in this first full-length study of her work. Along with the 2013 collection of essays edited by Janet Brennan Croft, Lois McMaster Bujold: Essays on a Modern Master of Science Fiction, James’s text signals a growing (and long overdue) recognition of an author who has been critically neglected since her emergence in 1986. What comes through most vividly in James’s study is the intricacy of Bujold’s world-building, the psychological depth of her characters, and the complexity of themes that are never simplified for the sake of easy consumption—features that make her absence from scholarly debate all the more perplexing.\n\nAfter an introduction that functions as a truncated biography and a scan of literary influences, James launches into an exhaustive set of summaries covering Bujold’s extensive sf output, primarily novels belonging to the Vorkosigan Saga (1986- ), which centers mostly on the popular Miles Vorkosigan and his family tree. The summaries are heightened throughout by James’s perceptive analyses, anchored firmly in a set of eye-opening considerations vis-à-vis the genre. It may be the case that “the Vorkosigan stories were usually branded as ‘space opera,’ and that label has tended to stick” (19), but as James makes clear, the sequence is best understood in terms of its subversion of sf subgenres, including the military sf that was so popular during the 1980s: “Bujold has mused that her fiction might better be called ‘medical sf’ than ‘military sf’” (23). Though her characters are embedded within military structures, and though the “military sf” label often clings stubbornly to her work, her focus is more firmly on complex ethical dilemmas, not theatrical violence or blind obedience to the chain of command. In Shards of Honor (1986), my personal favorite of her books, “we encounter the agony of ethical choice, which defines Bujold’s characters and frequently acts as a major plot driver” (28). This is not a consideration one encounters often in traditional military sf.\n\nJames pays close attention to Bujold’s fantasy novels as well, following the sf chapter with a similar survey of her fantasy works. Most interesting is the way he links these novels to her broader oeuvre, highlighting concepts, character types, and recurring interests that cut across the boundaries of her fiction. The “medical” focus that Bujold attaches to her sf, for instance, is on clear display in The Sharing Knife series (2006-2009), with the early novels following a central character as he develops his “groundsense,” an ability to read the details of living things, for “medical purposes” (68). James’s reading of The Sharing Knife novels is illuminating; for him, “[t]he sequence describes the prehistory of the revival of science in this world” (69), which connects the books to concerns about technology and its social impact found in the Vorkosigan Saga. The kind of blurring of themes and genres uncovered so effectively by James is one reason, perhaps, for Bujold’s absence from the academic canon: her narratives lack the explicit flags that enable neat and tidy labeling.\n\nThe five remaining chapters build on James’s textual surveys by examining themes central to Bujold’s writing, focusing on culture, character, disability, gender, and finally war, though these themes are tied to related ideas as well. If the case for Bujold’s relevance was not made earlier, it is unassailable here. I found the chapter on “Disability and Genetic Modification” particularly compelling, as it positions Bujold as one of sf’s most accomplished writers in the exploration of these subjects. After a failed assassination attempt on his parents—events dramatized in the Hugo-winning Barrayar (1991)—Miles is born with several physical impairments: brittle bones and a hunched, four-foot-nine frame. Over the course of the sequence, he is forced to rely on his manic intelligence and tactical flair, and on his home planet Barrayar, where physical irregularity is reviled, he must confront social prejudices that are both pervasive and culturally ingrained. Genetic modification (relying on “uterine replicators” to regulate fetal development) is utilized in these technologically advanced societies to eschew such problems in the first place, but Barrayar is steeped in centuries of feudal tradition. The slow transformation of these structures at the hands of Miles and his father Aral functions as a kind of narrative backbone tying the series together.\n\nAs James illuminates in his chapter on “Women, Uterine Replicators, and Sexuality,” Bujold associates Miles’s plight with issues of gender and sexuality as well: “being disabled and being female are often closely linked concepts” (125), with Miles positioned as a symbolic figure who stands against discrimination and misogyny in several of its guises. In “The Mountains of Mourning” (1989), for instance, he seeks justice for a “mutant” infant who is murdered for her deformities, a mission that, once accomplished, gives Miles “the symbol of what he is fighting for” (128).\n\nConsidering the strength of James’s commentary and the wonderful connections he draws among Bujold’s narratives, I would have liked to have seen a dedicated conclusion, one perhaps gesturing towards unexplored territory for future study. Still, the final chapter, “War, Leadership, and Honor,” brings the book full circle by describing Bujold’s focus on concepts central to military sf. Though thematic and generic “blurring” is a defining feature of her work, James reminds us that she still grapples with military sf’s established concerns—with tradition, duty, honor—only filtered through a lens accentuating moral, ethical, and cultural complexities. The chapter satisfyingly concludes what is a rigorous, instructive text, one that stands as indispensable reading not only for those familiar with Bujold but for students and teachers of sf in general.\n\n—Chad Andrews, Trent University\n\nEverything is Gothic.\n\nSian MacArthur. Gothic Science Fiction: 1818 to the Present. Palgrave Gothic. New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2015. vii + 176 pp. $95 hc.\n\nSian MacArthur’s monograph opens with the well-known account of the composition of Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein (1818), which MacArthur argues is the first instance of the Gothic being linked to science fiction. Her purpose in the book “is to explore this link between the Gothic and science fiction, and to explain just how a genre as seemingly traditional and rigid as the Gothic can combine so deftly with science fiction, a genre celebrated … for … its absolute freedom with regards to subject matter and theme” (2). The coverage extends to the present, the item most analyzed being the 2014 Doctor Who episode “Death in Heaven.”\n\nI was surprised to read that “by definition the Gothic and science fiction are two very different genres” (2), because Frankenstein (as MacArthur acknowledges) is one of the first sf texts, showing that the genres were connected from sf’s inception. This would seem to indicate that sf is intrinsically linked to the Gothic, recalling Brian W. Aldiss’s assertion that sf “is characteristically cast in the Gothic or post-Gothic mode” (Trillion Year Spree [Gollancz, 1986], 25). Of course, one might disagree with that, and indeed, Darko Suvin takes the opposite tack: “less congenial to SF is the fantasy (ghost, horror, Gothic, weird) tale, a genre committed to the interposition of anti-cognitive laws into the empirical environment” (Metamorphoses of Science Fiction [Yale UP, 1979], 8). But MacArthur provides no real definition of either science fiction or the Gothic, making it hard to follow any of her assertions. When MacArthur does define her terms, it is with definitions so broad as to be meaningless; for example, she claims that “‘monster’ does not necessarily mean a literal and physical ‘other’ within the text, but should be interpreted to encompass the theme of threat in its broadest sense” (73), removing anything that makes the term “monster” meaningful or useful.\n\nA lack of engagement with previous criticism plagues the project, which does not cite Aldiss, Suvin, or any other theorist of science fiction except in small asides (e.g., half a sentence from David Seed’s Science Fiction: A Very Short Introduction [2011]), nor the massive body of criticism about the Gothic. Indeed, the book’s engagement with criticism is minimal at best: although MacArthur cites a few academic articles, most of her secondary citations come from sources such as the introductions to Penguin Classics, online study guides, and blog posts.\n\nThe lack of a definition of “Gothic science fiction” makes following the book’s argument and trajectory difficult. The first chapter, “Early Science Fiction and the Gothic,” includes both H.G. Wells’s The War of the Worlds (1898) and Isaac Asimov’s “The Billiard Ball” (1967) as Gothic texts, neither of which would have occurred to me, but I am prepared to be convinced that reading them as Gothic could have some merit; MacArthur presents no such arguments, however. Of War of the Worlds, she says, “That this [human-Martian] battle manifests itself within the text through the depiction of the desire of the Martians against the suffering of the humans is only the first of many ways in which this particular text demonstrates heavy Gothic influence” (9). Her claiming of “The Billiard Ball” as Gothic hinges on the fact that its villain “[i]n true Poe style, displays both cunning and patience in exacting his revenge” (14) and that Asimov “creat[es] characters that are not all together [sic] what they seem” (14-15). None of these attributes feels uniquely Gothic, yet that is all the evidence MacArthur presents for the stories’ allegedly Gothic nature.\n\nAside from the fact that this chapter, ostensibly about “early science fiction,” goes up to Stephen King and Peter Straub’s 1984 novel The Talisman, its biggest flaw is that it never says anything about these texts; it identifies each as Gothic sf, provides some small synopsis or a couple of quotations, and then moves to the next item. Criticism that works with genre has to do something more than just identify texts as members (or not); to be useful, it should say something about what that genre does and what it means, and use that to reveal something about the texts in question. But MacArthur provides no implications to her observations; the chapter functions as a mere catalogue—an unconvincing one at that. A related difficulty is MacArthur’s very simplistic understanding of the Gothic; when discussing Henry Kuttner’s The Dark World (1946), for example, she claims that it is “more than just another Gothic yarn” because of “the large part of the plot that focuses on the boundary between perception and reality” (17). I haven’t read The Dark World, but I would have thought that playing with this boundary was an important quality of the Gothic. MacArthur repeatedly refers to the Gothic as a very rigid genre, but the diversity of the uses of the term she assembles here belies her own point.\n\nThe remaining chapters tackle subgenres of sf that “demonstrate the successful link between traditional Gothic writing and pure science fiction form” (24), including mad-scientist stories, novels of apocalypse, monster stories, Doctor Who, Star Wars, and superhero fiction. MacArthur makes exaggerated claims of stories as Gothic science fiction throughout. For example, in Chapter Two, MacArthur seemingly claims all stories featuring mad scientists as Gothic sf: aside from the expected citations of Frankenstein, The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1886), and The Island of Doctor Moreau (1896), she discusses George Griffith’s Olga Romanoff (1894), the James Bond novel Dr. No (1958), Spider-Man comics featuring Doctor Octopus, and the 2004 film adaptation of I, Robot, none of which I would consider Gothic science fiction, and none of which MacArthur makes a compelling case for as Gothic science fiction, beyond the fact that they contain mad scientists. Some critics have suggested that the Gothic is a mode that a text can use in part, rather than a genre that it must belong to in toto, and I could see how that would apply to some of these works, but this is not a distinction MacArthur makes: for her, works are either Gothic science fiction or not.\n\nThe long-running BBC sf series Doctor Who (1963-89, 1996, 2005- ) is a repeated example throughout the book, culminating in Chapter Five, “‘One Day, I Shall Come Back. Yes, I Shall Come Back’: Immortality and the Fight for Humanity in Gothic Science Fiction,” which—despite its title—is not about immortality in Gothic sf, but about the character of the Doctor and heroism. It periodically makes vague statements about Gothic sf: “as one would expect from a science fiction [sic] that has such strong Gothic influence, things are not always as they seem” (98), with most of the episodes under discussion not being very obviously Gothic—until the chapter’s last few pages, which finally discuss some of the stories that are more clearly Gothic, such as “The Brain of Morbius” (1976) or “Hide” (2013). This chapter also makes some basic errors about the series, including dating story elements introduced in the 2005 revival to its 1963 premiere: “The secrecy surrounding exactly what the Doctor has done in the past, specifically the fall of Gallifrey and the role that he played in the Time War, has been a feature of the series as far back as when William Hartnell held the role of the mysterious time traveller” (100). At other times, MacArthur is merely misleading: for example, she supports her discussion of the character of Davros from the 1975 serial Genesis of the Daleks, in the chapter on mad scientists, by citing dialogue from the 2005 episode “The Parting of the Ways,” without making it clear (except in the endnotes) that the dialogue is from an episode written thirty years later by a different writer in a story that does not feature or mention Davros.\n\nI was looking forward to reading this book because my primary area of research is nineteenth-century British science fiction, an era with a number of sf texts undeniably influenced by the Gothic, and I wanted to see how these motifs tracked forward from there. But Gothic Science Fiction gave me no sense of this: it is primarily a random catalogue of examples with no underlying argument. One might hope it would have some kind of utility as a catalogue, but whenever MacArthur discussed texts I was familiar with, such as nineteenth-century sf or Isaac Asimov or Doctor Who, her claims did not convince me, which means I am not inclined to trust her claims about the books I have not read. MacArthur’s lack of meaningful definitions, dearth of engagement with preexisting criticism, tendency to over-claim texts for the subgenre, and inaccuracies in her discussions mean that Gothic Science Fiction is a monograph best avoided entirely.\n\n—Steven Mollmann, University of Connecticut\n\nA Useful if Ungrounded Study.\n\nSylvie Magerstädt.

Palgrave Pivot, New York: Palgrave, 2014. 106 pp. $45 eBook (PDF); $67.50 hc (on demand).\n\nWhat makes us human? And how are we to be human under conditions of rapid technological change, especially when the forces of transformation may also upend conventional norms about what counts as human in the first place? According to Sylvie Magerstädt in her book Body, Soul, and Cyberspace in Contemporary Science Fiction Cinema, these questions—which are arguably core to the development of sf throughout its history—have galvanized a set of films produced since the turn of the millennium.\n\nAs part of the Palgrave Pivot line of short-form monographs, the book is compellingly streamlined and compact. Each of the main chapters explores the thematization of a particular concept—body, soul, and cyberspace, respectively—to indicate how recent sf films question, modulate, and shore up the notion of humanness. The first chapter argues for a shift in cinematic representations of the human body and organic matter. Whereas earlier sf films predominantly featured the human in opposition to the machine, the natural and organic in opposition to the artificial and the technological, according to Magerstädt, recent films have reformed such dichotomies through more systemic or hybrid articulations. Magerstädt describes a transition within the genre: postmodern, dystopian narratives that focus on confrontation or painful juxtaposition of bodies and machines have been gradually evolving into posthumanist, utopian narratives that underst"
