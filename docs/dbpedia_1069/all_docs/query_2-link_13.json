        "text": "Over the years, Science Fiction has offered me ways of understanding literary genres, as well as ways of thinking about the world. These understandings inform the courses on language, literature and identity that I have taught here and elsewhere. The first part of the presentation is an extended analogy: it develops an account of the genre of Science Fiction through an autobiographical telling of exploring the city of Hyderabad. The second part of this presentation touches upon some of the “thought-tools” that Science Fiction makes available to us. We argue that the imagined worlds of Science Fiction not only paint for us a variety of futures, but perhaps even more importantly, help us to reflect upon, and act in, the complex times we live in.\n\nD. Suvin, Parables of Freedom and Narrative Logics: Positions and Presuppositions in Science Fiction and Utopianism, 2 Vols. Ed. Eric D. Smith. Oxford: P. Lang, 2021. ch19 The preceding essays, dealing both with technical tools of narratology and indispensable value-judgements springing from the reading interests of given social groups, might have established the necessity to characterize SF texts by some ways of fusing these two approaches. As sundered in most criticism today, such approaches are — rather imprecisely — often labelled ‘formal’ and ’sociological’; taking a cue from linguistics, it would be better to call them ‘syntactic’ and ‘pragmatic’, since their necessary overlap in the intermediary ‘semantic’ or meaning-bestowing approach would then become apparent. This whole book arises out of a conviction — itself a feedback from the experiences culminating in Russia from 1910 to 1930 and retraversed in my previous work — that only such a fusion can lead to encompassing and verifiable positions. The formal, or better syntactical, approach can only be undertaken once we have decided which are the significant forms to be privileged as objects of our investigation; that decision necessarily intervenes into the text from ‘outside’.\n\nThis thesis is concerned with the novel, and specifically with how the novel is recognisable as a certain kind of meaning-the kind of meaning known to literary theorists as genre. To say that genre is a kind of meaning is to infer that it shapes linguistic meaning in the broad sense that I have given thus far, for genre can indeed be said to both enhance and constrain meaning in these terms (Frow Genre 10). Thus a statement in a novel, although it will have the same linguistic value that it possesses in ordinary usage, will have the additional meaning described by the term \"fiction\"; and this additional meaning value will both limit and direct the inferences that follow from the utterance. Situation-as an integral relation of space and time-is important because such enhancements will include presumptions founded on conventions not ordinarily required for everyday speech and writing where the utterance is unmediated and the speakers are phenomenally known or knowable. These conventions will position the utterance as deriving from a character in the novel, or the narrator, rather than the author of the work overall. Such distinctions are primarily spatiotemporal: although the coherence of the novel's statements will be critically attributable to the writer, these are mediated through different \"persons\"-they come to us via the fictive speakers of the novel. The four key metaphors identified in the title to this thesis are the kinds of meaning that are mediated in the novel to create this effect, which is the sense of a space and time that is other than the conditions in which the novel was written. Mediation of these terms occurs in a variety of genres but it is in particular the novel which achieves this effect through the elaboration and transformation of ordinary styles of speech. Indeed, the construction of fictive eventfulness is possible because all meaning is metaphoric when added to the world through speech; for speech represents a likeness to the phenomenal aspect without being the same as that aspect: meaning is not material, in other words, but a conceptual aspect correlating to the phenomenal. This realisation underpins post-Saussurean semiologie and post-Peircean semiotics; 1 but in this thesis"
