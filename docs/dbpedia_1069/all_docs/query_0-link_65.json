        "text": "The continuing contemporary growth in science fiction scholarship, the expansion of undergraduate provision, and the interest shown in the genre at postgraduate level firmly situate sf within the provinces of the ‘New English’. It is, arguably, one of the most effective literary genres for challenging the perspectives of a student body which, in Great Britain at least, seems detached from social, political and cultural debate and which sees the status quo as immutable. Its speculative nature, its incessant philosophizing on ‘what if?’, invites a comparative speculative response; it requires engagement with thought-experiments that confront and often overturn passive acceptance of contemporary conditions; it has the capacity to stimulate, to unsettle, to provoke the reader into an intellectual response. Constantly reinventing itself to react imaginatively to transformations in its cultural and ideological milieu, it remains the most vibrant of the popular genres and affords considerable scholarly pleasure to those involved in its teaching and study."
