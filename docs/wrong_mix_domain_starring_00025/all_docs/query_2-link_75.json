        "text": "PLOT (spoiler alert!!!):\n\nMac (Seth Rogen) and Kelly Radner (Rose Byrne) are a young couple with a newborn daughter, Stella. The restrictions of parenthood make it difficult for them to maintain their old lifestyle, which alienates them from their friends Jimmy Blevins (Ike Barinholtz) and his ex-wife, Paula (Carla Gallo). One day, the couple finds out that Delta Psi Beta, a fraternity known for their outrageous parties, has moved into an adjacent house. The fraternity’s leaders, Teddy Sanders (Zac Efron) and Pete Regazolli (Dave Franco), aspire to join Delta Psi’s Hall of Fame by throwing a massive end-of-the-year party.\n\nOne night, the couple ask Teddy to keep the noise down. Teddy agrees on the condition that Mac and Kelly always call him instead of calling the police. To earn Mac and Kelly’s favor, Teddy invites them to join the party, which the couple agree to. At the party, Kelly meets Teddy’s girlfriend, Brooke Shy (Halston Sage), and Teddy shows Mac his bedroom, which includes a stash of fireworks and a breaker box that controls their power.\n\nThe following night, Mac is unable to get in touch with Teddy to ask him to keep it down. Kelly convinces Mac to call the police, but Officer Watkins (Hannibal Buress) identifies them to Teddy. The following day, Delta Psi constantly hazes Mac and Kelly. The couple goes to the college dean, Carol Gladstone (Lisa Kudrow), and learn that the school has a three strikes policy; burning down their old house was Delta Psi’s first strike.\n\nAfter failing to force the fraternity to move by damaging their house, Kelly manipulates Pete and Brooke into having sex and Mac gets Teddy to catch them. Teddy and Pete fight, which ends with a barbecue grill being rolled into the path of a passing car and injuring a professor, giving Delta Psi their second strike. To acquire evidence of Delta Psi’s hazing, Kelly and Mac hire a pledge nicknamed Assjuice (Craig Roberts) to stand up to Teddy to record him threatening retaliation. When Teddy instead shows him kindness, he reveals that Mac and Kelly hired him and also damaged their house. Teddy begins playing violent pranks on the couple.\n\nMac and Kelly send Teddy a counterfeit letter from Gladstone enabling them to have parties again, and Teddy begins planning their end-of-the-year bash. Once the party is in full swing, the Radners call Watkins to complain about the noise. Teddy discovers the random strangers sent by Mac, Kelly and Jimmy. After finding a flyer about the party and determining the letter is counterfeit, he stops the party just as Watkins arrives. Jimmy throws himself from the balcony to distract Teddy, allowing Mac and Kelly to sneak into Teddy’s bedroom and restart the party using the breaker box. Teddy catches them and fights Mac, while Kelly lights one of the fireworks and shoots it at Watkins’s patrol car. Teddy takes the blame for the party and convinces Pete to take the others and flee. Gladstone shuts the house down and Mac and Kelly return home, adjusting to their new lives.\n\nFour months later, Mac is at an outdoor shopping mall when he runs into Teddy, who is working as a shirtless greeter at Abercrombie & Fitch. The two greet each other warmly and Teddy tells Mac that he is attending night classes to complete his degree. Mac takes off his shirt and jokingly acts as a greeter with Teddy.\n\nMac and Kelly later take pictures of Stella dressed in various costumes for a calendar. They get a call from Jimmy and Paula, who are attending Burning Man and invite the couple to come, including Stella. Mac and Kelly decline, accepting their new roles as parents.\n\nREVIEW:\n\nGrowing up as a military brat, I am more than aware of what it is like to be the new neighbor moving into the neighborhood. What happens, though, when the new folks to move in are a fraternity and you’re just a quiet young couple with a new baby? Neighbors aims to answer that question.\n\nWhat is this about?\n\nNew parents Mac and Kelly Radner love their neighborhood — until a rowdy fraternity moves next door and changes the block into party central. As Mac tries to restore a baby-friendly environment, an epic battle ensues.\n\nWhat did I like?\n\nFratboy douche. Fraternities have not been portrayed in the greatest light on film. Before I went to college, I thought this was a bit of a stereotype and/or exaggeration, but after meeting a few frat boys and going to some parties, I can say this is most certainly not true, as they are pretty much like this. I have to hand it to Zac Efron, though, this is a guy that has made a solid name for himself post-Disney and continues to do so with a myriad of different roles. On top of that, he has that look that frat boy presidents tend to have, so kudos to him and the casting director.\n\nAirbags. One of the best gags in the film has to do with airbags. I won’t spoil exactly what it is, but I will say that it was a stroke of genius for the frat to get the upper hand on the “old people”. I’m not sure how they managed to break into places and get the airbags or how they managed to get them work at just the right time, but it had me rolling on the floor laughing.\n\nHusband and wife. Seth Rogen and Rose Byrne. Two people who you never would expect to be married (I’ll touch on that in a bit) actually have some terrific chemistry. Usually with Byrne, she’s playing some super stuffy character that just needs to let loose once in a while whole Rogen is the laid back pothead. In a way they are still those same character, but Byrne is a much looser version and Rogen is…well, let’s just say if it ain’t broke don’t fix it! There are times between these two that I really did think they were husband and wife. Hopefully, we’ll get to see them work together again in some form or another.\n\nWhat didn’t I like?\n\nAssface. There is this character, a pledge for the fraternity, called Assface. Rogen and Byrne manage to trick him into spying and betraying his frat, but something happens and he just cracks. Ok, that happens, but then he just goes on spilling the beans about everything else that happened. Here’s my problem with that. First off, there is something seriously wrong with a guy if he can’t keep anything secret. Second, why would they trust him with that information?!? This is a freshman in college pledging a fraternity. He is going to do any and everything to get in, and that includes turn on you at the first chance he gets. I can’t believe they didn’t know that!\n\nOther neighbors. With the exception of one scene, we don’t see or hear anything from the other neighbors and in that scene it is shown that the frat is getting them “on their side”. Look, I don’t care how firmly planted in someone’s camp I am, if they consistently play loud music at 3 or 4 in the morning, I will lodge a complaint. That may be me sounding like an old “fuddy-duddy”, but I need my sleep! Judging by the looks of these neighbors, they would complain if someone looked at them wrong, so I don’t get why there weren’t more complaints. Also, and this is probably the biggest flaw in the film…how does a fraternity movie into a nice neighborhood like that?!?\n\nRalph Cramden. The fat guy and the hot wife. We’ve been seeing this trend since The Honeymooners, at least. I don’t have a problem with it, other than wondering how in the world a guy like Rogen lands a hot, international chick like Byrne. It leaves me dumbfounded. I want to know his secret! Seriously, though, my biggest pet peeve with these two has to do with a sex scene they have. We see a nude Rogen on top of poor Rose Byrne (who is actually clothed, as someone just pointed out to me) and it looks like he’s smothering the poor woman. Thank goodness this was for a comedic scene with the frat boys being voyeurs because that was not sexy at all. Speaking of sexy, we get to see Rogen’s bare ass, but what about Rose’s goodies? Well, she does whip them out in some strange breastfeeding scene, but it is far from hot, as they are all veiny and weird. Why this film teased us with that, I don’t know!\n\nNeighbors is the kind of film that you know exists and you want to check it out and some point, but just never get around to it. Don’t get me wrong, it does have some good parts, but the parts that aren’t, well, they really aren’t! While not totally horrible, this is a film that did nothing to make the audience think it is anything more than some half-baked National Lampoon’s Animal House clone where the original formula has been so diluted, all that remains is a raunchy college fraternity. I have to say this is not something I would recommend, but I won’t fault you for watching.\n\n3 out of 5 stars\n\nPLOT (spoiler alert!!!):\n\nTheodore “Ted” Wiggins, an idealistic 12-year-old boy, lives in “Thneedville”, a walled city that, aside from the citizens, is completely artificial: everything is made of plastic, metal, or synthetics. Ted sets out to find a real tree for his friend Audrey. His energetic grandmother suggests he speak with the Once-ler about this, and he discovers that their city has been closed off from the outside world, which is a contaminated and empty wasteland. The Once-ler agrees to tell Ted about the trees if he listens to his story over multiple visits. Ted agrees, even after the mayor of Thneedville, Aloysius O’Hare, who is also the greedy proprietor of a bottled oxygen company, confronts the boy and pressures him to stay in town. Over the course of the film, Ted, with the encouragement of his grandmother, continues to sneak out of O’Hare’s sight and learns more of the history of the trees.\n\nOver the visits, the Once-ler recounts the story of how he departed his family to make his fortune. In a lush Truffula Tree forest, he met the Lorax. He is a grumpy yet charming orange creature who served as guardian of the land. At first, the Once-ler had a plan to chop down the trees. Eventually, he promised not to chop another tree down. The young businessman’s Thneed invention soon became a major success and the Once-ler’s family arrived to participate in the business. Keeping his promise at first, the Once-ler continued Thneed production by harvesting the tufts themselves in a sustainable manner. Unfortunately, his greedy and lazy relatives convinced him to resume logging as a more efficient gathering method. Breaking his promise, the Once-ler’s deforestation spiraled into a mass overproduction. Flush with wealth, the Once-ler rationalised his short sighted needs into arrogant self-righteousness and the helpless protests of the Lorax could not stop him. The Once-ler polluted the sky, river and landscape, until finally the last Truffula Tree fell outside, and the Once-ler realised what he had done while making the region uninhabitable with his business’s pollution. With that, the Once-ler was left ruined and abandoned by his own family and became a recluse with the creation and isolation of Ted’s town that came under young Mr. O’Hare’s control, giving him the plan to sell fresh air with the absence of trees. Eventually, the Lorax sends the animals away before departing himself into the sky, leaving a stonecut word: “Unless”.\n\nAt the end of the story, the Once-ler understands the meaning behind the Lorax’s last message, and gives Ted a gift of the last Truffula seed in hopes of planting it to regrow the forest. Ted’s desire to impress Audrey is now a personal mission to remind his town of the importance of nature. O’Hare, determined not to have trees undercut his business, takes heavy-handed steps such as covering Audrey’s nature paintings, closing off the door that Ted uses to see the Once-ler and forcibly searching Ted’s room for the seed. Ted enlists his family and Audrey to help plant the seed, which has begun to germinate after coming into contact with water. O’Hare and his employees pursue the dissidents until they manage to elude him and reach the town center. Unfortunately, their attempt to plant the seed is interrupted by O’Hare who rallies the population to stop them. To convince them otherwise, Ted takes an earthmover and rams down a section of the city wall to reveal the environmental destruction outside. Horrified at the sight and inspired by Ted’s conviction, the crowd defies O’Hare with his own henchmen expelling him from the town. The seed is planted, and Audrey kisses Ted on the cheek. Time passes and the land is starting to recover; the trees are regrowing, the animals are returning, and the redeemed Once-ler is happily reunited with the Lorax.\n\nREVIEW:\n\nThe Lorax is best known as a character from the animated short which usually followed How the Grinch Stole Christmas. That is, it was before they stopped airing them together to “save airtime for revenue generating programming” (don’t get me started on a rant about that). Dr. Seuss’ beloved environmental champion is finally getting the spotlight in this animated film.\n\nWhat is this about?\n\nA 12-year-old boy searches for the one thing that will enable him to win the affection of the girl of his dreams. To find it he must discover the story of the Lorax, the grumpy yet charming creature who fights to protect his world. Can he do it? Will he get the girl?\n\nWhat did I like?\n\nHunk o’ cheese. I think that it is safe to say these songs are not going to be winning any Grammy or Oscar nominations for best song. While they are cheesy and horrible, they are the kind of thing you just can’t turn away from. I dare you to watch and listen and not at least be intrigued.\n\nAbout time. Look, you can say how this is some kind of environmental propaganda film all you want, but there is some truth to it. As I say in many of my western or medieval film reviews, the gorgeous countryside that was once nothing but trees is now nothing but buildings, smoke, smog, and grumpy people. If we keep headed that way, pretty soon we’ll choke ourselves to death. That is unless someone can find a way to charge for air. As greedy as people are in this day and age, I’m surprised they haven’t tried already!\n\nAnimation. Pixar threw down the gauntlet by showing that even fur can be animated in films like Monsters, Inc. and most recently, Brave. It is about time other studios started catching up. The forest animals and the Lorax are beautifully animated, right down to each and every last inch of fur. The trees, when we see them, are just like those troll dolls and fuzzy pen/pencil tops that were popular not so long ago. On the flipside, the humans seem as plastic as the town they live in.\n\nWhat didn’t I like?\n\nOnce-ler. The book is very short and the animated special is about 15 minutes, I believe, possibly 30…been awhile since I’ve watched it. Obviously, in order to make a 90 minute film, they needed to flesh some things out. I would imagine this would allow us to get to know the Lorax a little better, seeing as how this is his film. However, they decided to give us this whole backstory on the Once-ler, including taking away the mysterious form he has and making him human, as well as foisting the Ted stuff on us. I just can’t fathom why they decided to give the Once-ler the once over. It was like in Inspector Gadget when we see Dr. Klaw. These characters are mysterious and in shadow for a reason. Leave them be and don’t try to make them human!\n\nEntrance. The Lorax makes a grand entrance, complete with thunder, lightning, the whole nine yards, and then…a whole lot of nothing. That isn’t his fault, but rather the writers. If you’re going to give him this big intro like that, then give him something to do, such as magical powers or something. Otherwise, just have him randomly appear and start bitching about how the trees have been cut down!\n\nControversy. As I mentioned earlier, there has been some controversy surrounding this film and its “environmental propaganda”. As an adult, I see it, but do you honestly think a 5 yr old kid is going to care about that? Truth be told, this is no worse that getting beat over the head with the environmental stick every week by Captain Planet in the late 80s and early 90s. As a matter of fact, that was worse. There is no reason to turn a harmless film into a political issue, but of course, some conservative nutjob had to do just that. They did the same thing with The Dark Knight, saying Batman was like President Bush going into Iraq. Ugh…why can’t we just watch films and not try to analyze (and ruin) everything!\n\nSwift and unfaithful. Let me just get this out there. I do not care for Taylor Swift. She needs to be worshipping the ground that Kanye West walks on for her career, because if not for that little scene at the awards show a few years back, she would be just another country singer. I also do not care for the way this film treats the actual lines from the book. They do it with such a condescending tone, it is almost as if they want to disavow any knowledge of it, which is an insult to the great words spun from the creative mind of the late, great Dr. Seuss!\n\nThe Lorax is actually one of the better animated films I’ve seen this year. It does everything it sets out to do and even accomplishes a few other things along the way. Kids and adults will enjoy this light-hearted film and I highly recommend it!\n\n4 1/2 out of 5 stars\n\nPLOT (spoiler alert!!!):\n\nOn New Year’s Eve, Vice-President of the Times Square Alliance Claire Morgan (Hilary Swank) is making the final arrangements for the ball drop with the help of her friend Brandon (Ludacris). Meanwhile, after being nearly run over by a car and denied a vacation, Ahern Records secretary Ingrid (Michelle Pfeiffer) quits her job and offers the deliveryman Paul (Zac Efron) tickets for the Ahern Records Masquerade Ball if Paul helps her complete a series of New Year’s resolutions before midnight, which he accepts.\n\nPaul’s sister Kim (Sarah Jessica Parker) is having trouble with her teenage daughter Hailey (Abigail Breslin) who wants to spend New Year’s Eve with her friends and her boyfriend Seth (Jake T. Austin) in Times Square. Paul’s friend, comic book illustrator Randy (Ashton Kutcher), who hates New Year’s Eve after his girlfriend left him on a date, gets stuck in an elevator with Elise (Lea Michele), an aspiring singer who will be providing back-up for musician Jensen (Jon Bon Jovi) in his show at Times Square, he also performs at the Ahern Records ball, where he rekindles his feelings for his ex-girlfriend, Laura (Katherine Heigl).\n\nAt a nearby hospital, Stan Harris (Robert De Niro), a man in the final stages of cancer who refuses chemotherapy and who only wishes to see the ball drop one last time, is kept company by Nurse Aimee (Halle Berry) and Nurse Mindy (Alyssa Milano) after his doctor (Cary Elwes) reveals he will not last much longer. In the same hospital, a young couple, Griffin (Seth Meyers) and Tess (Jessica Biel), about to have their first child, competes with another couple, James (Til Schweiger) and Grace (Sarah Paulson), for a bonus offered for the family of the first child born in the new year. Elsewhere, Sam (Josh Duhamel), a businessman from Ahern Records, attempts to go to the Ahern Records Ball, where he is to deliver an important speech, after his car malfunctions on the other side of New York, all the while wondering if he should attend a meeting with a mysterious woman he met and fell in love with on the previous New Year’s Eve.\n\nAs midnight approaches, one of the billboard lights of the Times Square panel malfunctions, jamming the ball and forcing Claire to call Kominsky (Héctor Elizondo), an electrician, who the company had fired a few weeks prior. Kominsky repairs the ball before midnight, and, in gratitude, Claire leaves him in charge of the operation, and rushes to see the ball drop with her father, Stan. Meanwhile, Nurse Aimee has a video conference with her husband (Common), a soldier serving in Afghanistan.\n\nPaul helps Ingrid complete all the items on her list, and she gives him the tickets. Meanwhile, Randy and Elise bond, and, as they are about to kiss, the elevator is repaired and Elise rushes to Jensen’s show. Randy notices she forgot her rubber band and rushes to give it to her. At the Ball, Jensen leaves midway during the show and apologizes to Laura, who accepts him back and leaves with the approval of her assistant, Sous Chef Ava (Sofia Vergara). With Jensen gone, Elise is called to replace him and attracts the attention of the crowd. She kisses Randy, and they start a romantic relationship.\n\nGriffin and Tess have their baby and, although it is born first, they allow James and Grace to have the bonus after discovering they actually have three children. Meanwhile, after being forbidden from attending the celebration, Hailey runs away to Times Square, where she sees Seth being kissed by another girl. Heartbroken, she meets and is comforted by her mother. Seth finds them and apologizes, claiming the girl stole a kiss from him. Hailey forgives him and Seth kisses her. Her mother allows her to go to an after-party. Kim then goes to a restaurant to meet Sam, who had succeeded in delivering his speech. She is the mysterious woman he met one year prior, and they finally discover each other’s names\n\nREVIEW:\n\nI actually toyed around with the idea of waiting until it was actually December 31 to watch New Year’s Eve, but apparently Netflix had other plans for me. Oh well, it happens. After sitting through this knee jerk of a film, though, I don’t think this is something I would like to have as one of the last memories of the year.\n\nWhat did I like?\n\nA for effort. I give them credit for making a sequel that isn’t a carbon copy of its predecessor, in this case, Valentine’s Day, While it wasn’t a carbon copy, there are elements that seep in. I still wonder why or who thought there needed to be a sequel. No way in the world did that first film make that much money, right?\n\nCohesiveness. Just like the last film, there are many major stars in this film, but none of them get anymore time than the others. Sure, if you were to actually time the amount of screentime we saw Sofia Vergara as opposed to Sarah Jessica Parker, there might be a bit of a time difference, but for the mos part, we’re taking equality here, which is really impressive, especially since one can only imagine how egos got in the way when it came to making this picture.\n\nVariety. Another interesting aspect of the film that I liked is how it is not focused solely on the “good looking” adults. We also get some teenage hormonal stuff in there, as well as some old people melodrama. I thought that was a nice touch.\n\nGlobes. Any straight guy with a pulse is going to love seeing Sofia Vergara out of that chef’s jacket and into that blue dress. I’m going to leave it at that.\n\nWhat didn’t I like?\n\nWrong holiday. At times, it seems as if this film really was trying to be Valentine’s Day II, as opposed to an entirely different entity (technically this isn’t a sequel). They kept pushing the matchmaking, lovey-dovey part so much, the New Year’s aspect got lost until they flashed back to downtown New York as we saw the big ball and all of its technical issues.\n\nRandom. So, while most people in this film are the beautiful, well-to-do sorts, we get this one family that picks up Josh Duhamel and they are about as normal as can be. In any other film, they’d be great, but here they seem a bit out of place, and maybe that was the idea. They did add a bit of charm and provided a nice little departure from the norm. Still, I wasn’t in love with them.\n\nBon Jovi. Nothing against the guy as an actor. I think, especially for musicians, he is pretty good. My issue is why he couldn’t sing his own songs. Don’t give me this crap about the sings and right and all that junk, because Jon, if I’m not mistaken, owns his entire library. It would’ve been nice to get at least a snippet of him singing one of his hits, such as “Blaze of Glory” “Livin’ on a Prayer”, etc.\n\nSara Jessica Parker. Worst actress of all time. Need I say more?\n\nNew Year’s Eve doesn’t stack up to its predecessor. As a matter of fact, the only thing it does manage to achieve is proof that just because you have big name actors in a film, doesn’t necessarily mean it’ll be a good one. This film has some moments that shine, but just as soon as those get settled into your brain, something goes wrong, and you remember that this isn’t that great of a film. Do I recommend this? Yes, but only for date night. I can’t see any other reason to willingly want to check this out.\n\n3 out of 5 stars\n\nPLOT (spoiler alert!!!):\n\nIn New York in 1937, 17-year-old Richard Samuels (Efron) meets theatre director Orson Welles (McKay), who unexpectedly offers him the role of Lucius in Julius Caesar, Broadway’s first Shakespearean production, at the Mercury Theatre. Welles is having an affair with the leading actress while his wife is pregnant. Richard finds ambitious production assistant Sonja Jones (Danes) is attracted to him.\n\nWelles tells Richard a few days before the premiere that he is worried, because he has recently had nothing but good luck; he fears that he will finally have bad luck with the premiere, and that the play will be a flop. During rehearsals, Richard accidentally sets off the sprinkler system, but persuades Welles he was not responsible, and that anyway, this was the bad luck that he needed.\n\nWelles decides the entire production crew would benefit from a coupling game, and Richard cheats to ensure he is paired with Sonja. Richard spends the night with Sonja, but becomes jealous when she spends the next night with Welles. He confronts Welles, mentions his pregnant wife, and is fired. An apparent reconciliation follows, and Richard performs on the first night. The anti-fascist adaptation of Caesar is a huge success, but Richard is told he is still fired.\n\nThe broken-hearted but wiser Richard finds a new girlfriend, a young aspiring playwright whom he met in a music store at the film’s beginning\n\nREVIEW:\n\nI posted on Facebook this weekend how it seems as if I’m obsessed with this particular era (the 30s). Why else would I enjoy Me and Orson Welles so much?\n\nWell, first off, I’m sure there are some of you that have no idea who Orson Welles is. Well, in the late 30s he read H.G. Wells’ The War of the Worlds with such believability that people actually thought aliens were coming. Also, he is the director of what many believe to be the greatest film of all time, Citizen Kane. Those of us that are more geeked out may know him as the voice of Unicron in Transformers: The Movie. Welles was a larger than life personality and an extremely talented actor and director. Now that you have a little bit of info on Orson, let me tell you what this film is about.\n\nA young actor named Richard is looking for his big break. He happens to meet a young Orson Welles who is putting on a production on Julius Caesar and is offered a part in the show. Throughout the film, we become privy to the ins and outs of Orson, but he is actually not the star of the film, Richard is, as apparent by the focus on his love interest in Sonja and the meetings with Gretta.\n\nThe film ends with a confrontation between Richard and Orson that results in hin getting fired, but things do work out for him in the end.\n\nI initially saw this as a trailer on some film earlier this year, and while the thought of a film about Orson Welles intrigued me, I didn’t go out of my way to see it. After watching it this afternoon, I am inclined to believe that I should have watched this long ago.\n\nFirst off, I have to commend the acting. Claire Danes is great, but isn’t she always? I mean, she is an Emmy Award winning actress.\n\nZac Efron has come quite away since his days in High School Musical, but, much in the same way John Travolta can’t seem to be in a movie without dancing, Efron can’t get away without singing, for some reason.\n\nThe real standout in this cast in Christian McKay as Orson Welles. He really made me believe he was Orson Welles. Not only did he put on a great performance, but he also looked the part! The casting director outdid themselves when they chose him.\n\nMuch of this film is fast paced and frantic, much in the way Noises Off! fires off in a machine gun type style. I think this is one of the reasons this film doesn’t fall into the realm of boredom, but keeps the audience’s attention, which is always a plus.\n\nOn top of the great acting, the soundtrack really shines in this film. I’m a little biased, but how could you not love the music of this era. The mixture of swing tunes and the music of Cole Porter is a real treat and helps frame the tone of the film.\n\nI really liked how this film didn’t get too sappy with the love story between Richard and Sonja, but at the same time, I think they could have played it up a little more, or at least set up the ending a bit more.\n\nThis really was a surprise for me. I was not expecting to enjoy this film as much as I did, especially since I don’t recall it being released in theaters (not sure if it was a direct-to-DVD feature, though). This is one very well written, enjoyable film that I highly recommend.\n\n4 1/2 out of 5 stars\n\nPLOT:\n\nJust before his 1989 high school-championship basketball game, 17 years-old Mike O’Donnell’s (Zac Efron) girlfriend Scarlett (Allison Miller) tells him that she is pregnant. He leaves the game and a possible college basketball scholarship to propose to her.\n\nTwo decades later, Mike’s (Matthew Perry) life has stalled. Scarlett (Leslie Mann) has separated from him due to his regrets about abandoning college, forcing him to move in with his geeky and wealthy best friend since high school, Ned Gold (Thomas Lennon); he quits his job; and his high school-age children Maggie (Michelle Trachtenberg) and Alex (Sterling Knight) want nothing to do with him. While visiting Hayden High School to reminisce, an encounter with a mysterious janitor (Brian Doyle Murray) transforms Mike into his 17 year-old self.\n\nGiven the chance to relive his life Mike enrolls in high school posing as “Mark Gold”, Ned’s son, and plans to go to college with a basketball scholarship. As he befriends his children, however, Mike comes to believe that his mission is to help them. Mike comforts Maggie when her boyfriend Stan, the captain of the basketball team, dumps her. With his help, Alex overcomes Stan’s bullying to obtain a place with Mike on the basketball team and the girlfriend he desires.\n\nThrough their children Mike spends time with Scarlett, who is attracted to his remarkable resemblance to her husband in high school. Mike has difficulty resisting his desire for her despite the relationship’s apparent inappropriateness. At the same time, he resists Maggie’s growing infatuation with him by telling her that he loves another. Meanwhile, Ned courts Jane Masterson, the high school principal; they discover a mutual interest in The Lord of the Rings.\n\nAfter embarrassing himself and horrifying Scarlett by trying to kiss her in front of their children, Mike refocuses on basketball. At the championship game, he makes a gesture which Scarlett recognizes. Realizing who “Mark” is, she flees to prevent Mike from again leaving the game and abandoning college. Mike follows, giving Alex the chance to win the game, and the janitor changes him back to an adult. Mike promises Scarlett that he will be a better husband and father. Reconciled with his family, Mike becomes the new school basketball coach.\n\nREVIEW:\n\nHow many pf us would love to go back to our high school days and be 17 again? I know I would, but at the sam time, I don’t want to lose anything I’ve learned since then. In a way, this is the idea behind 17 Again.\n\nLet me get the elephant out of the room first. How in the hell does Zac Efron grow up to become Matthew Perry? Seems to me they could have found either a more schlubby looking kid or someone more Efron-esque. I know that his character is supposed to have grown up to be a loser, of sorts, but something just isn’t quite right about the casting.\n\nOn the flip side, I can totally see how Allison Miller would grow up to become Leslie Mann. When I first saw her, I actually thought they were the same person. Shame they couldn’t have done the same kid of inspired casting with Ned and Mike.\n\nThe story here is sort of a mixture of Big and 13 Going on 30. Mike was a star basketball player in high school. He had the looks, the talent, the girl, and everything. He was about to impress a big time college scout and get a free ride to college, when his ultra hot girlfriend shows up and says she’s pregnant, causing him to leave the game during play, and spend his life with her.\n\nI have issues with the face that this chick shows up in the biggest game of his life. I know this was an important thing to tell him and all, but 2-3 hours later wouldn’t have hurt. She should have known better. Who knows how much better the whole situation would have been had she have waited.\n\nMoving on, we fast forward to current time. Scarlett has kicked Mike out of the house, causing him to live with his nerdy (and rich) best friend, Ned. In a trip to pick up his kids, Mike meets this mysterious janitor, who turns out to be a “spirit guide” and somehow opens up a portal that turns Mike back to his 17 year old body, but with his 37 yr old mind.\n\nThis leads to hilarity with the situations regarding his children and wife, some are rather creepy, to be honest with you.\n\nIn the end, as you can about imagine, everything is worked out and they all live happily ever after.\n\nI’ve already touched on the casting, but the acting isn’t half bad. If there is a weak link, I have to go with Michelle Trachtenberg. She just doesn’t seem to quite fit. I think its more to do with the fact that even though she looks like a teenager, she is nearly outgrowing these kind of roles, as seen here.\n\nMatthew Perry seems to have just called this in. Granted he isn’t exactly on the screen for more than a grand total of probably 10 minutes, but that is no excuse. He should have given the same amount of effort here as he did in every episode of Friends. I didn’t expect too much from him, but I did have higher expectations than this.\n\nZac Efron has come a long way since High School Musical. Ironically, this film has him playing basketball again, as well as doing a dance. Still, he is proving to be a force in Hollywood as more than just a song and dance guy. He single-handedly carries this film, and why shouldn’t he. I mean, he is the star, right?\n\nThomas Lennon is great as the comic relief best friend. He is totally believable as this super geek who appears to have more money than God. On a side note…I loved his Star Wars– themed bedroom.\n\nWhat is the final verdict on 17 Again? Well, it isn’t as bad you would think it is, but at the same time, it isn’t anything that hasn’t been done before. As I said before, it really is just like Big and 13 Going on 30, and other films with the same general plot. Having said that, while this isn’t something to go out of your way to watch, it is a very enjoyable film that just about everyone can enjoy (although, there could have been more Leslie Mann for us guys to enjoy).\n\n3 1/2 out of 5 stars\n\nPLOT:\n\nIt’s the end of the Wildcats’ championship basketball game against the West High Knights, where team captain Troy immediately rallies their spirits (“Now or Never”). With the team’s spirit raised, they win, thanks to the winning shot from their newest team member Jimmie “The Rocket” Zara. Later, at Troy’s after-match party at his house, Troy and Gabriella are seen thinking about their future and wishing that their last few months at East High would not end (“Right Here, Right Now”).\n\nSharpay meets Tiara Gold, a British exchange student whom she hires to be her personal assistant. When drama teacher Ms. Darbus notices that there were so few sign-ups for the spring musical, Sharpay suggests she could do a one-woman show. This alarms Kelsi, who is writing the show, so she signs up everyone in the class for it instead. This results in Ms. Darbus announcing they will create a play about their final days at East High, called “Senior Year.” In addition, she reveals that Sharpay, Ryan, Kelsi, and Troy have all been considered for a scholarship at Juilliard, but only one of them is to be chosen. Troy is confused, because he did not apply to Juilliard. Sharpay becomes desperate to win the scholarship, and knowing that Kelsi will give the best songs to Troy and Gabriella in the musical, she gets Ryan to try to persuade Kelsi to give them a song, by predicting her (and Ryan’s) future (“I Want It All”).\n\nThe next day, Gabriella and Troy have meet on the rooftop and she teaches him how to waltz (“Can I Have This Dance?”). Chad then asks Taylor to go to prom with him. She initially refuses due to his lack of enthusiasm, but later agrees when Chad proves he can put in some effort and asks again in front of everyone in the school. The group rehearses for the musical, a scene about their prom night (“A Night To Remember”). Ryan walks in on Kelsi composing (“Just Wanna Be With You”) in the music room, and performs it with her, and then he asks her to prom halfway through.\n\nWhile Troy and Chad reminisce about their past (“The Boys Are Back”), Sharpay and Tiara discover that Gabriella has a chance to go to college early. Sharpay later convinces Troy that he is the only thing keeping Gabriella from her dream, (“Right Here, Right Now (Reprise)”). Troy talks to Gabriella about this over pizza, and after sharing an awkward goodnight, Gabriella sings (“Walk Away”) and leaves for college the next day.\n\nTroy’s dad, Jack, talks to him about his academic future, which he expects will be in the University of Albuquerque. This assumption makes Troy become angry, confused, and he runs away, storming around East High bewildered (“Scream”) until he finally screams at the top of his lungs in the theatre. Ms. Darbus has been there all this time watching and reveals that she sent in his application for Juilliard, as she knew how comfortable he was on stage and how much he liked it. Troy takes no offense and thinks about the advice given to him. Troy later gets a call from Gabriella saying that although she loves him, she will not return to Albuquerque, as she is too used to being away. However, on the night of prom, Troy visits Gabriella at Stanford and convinces her to return, as everyone is not the same without her (“Can I Have This Dance? (Reprise)”).\n\nBack at East High, Jimmie receives a text from Troy to tell him to cover for him onstage because he is going to be late. The Juilliard representatives are there, and watch as the show seems to go well (“Senior Year Spring Musical”).\n\nDuring the opening number, Kelsi and Ryan debut. While during the second number, Chad, Jason, Zeke and Martha debut, Ryan does his number withthe many chorus girls; Jimmie then performs with Sharpay and embarrasses her. Troy and Gabriella appear during the second half of the show and sing their duet together. Tiara then betrays Sharpay and tells her how she is going to take over next year in the drama department. Sharpay finally learns how it feels to be humiliated, but does not wish to go down. While Tiara performs, Sharpay immediately crashes her performance and upstages her.\n\nMs. Darbus reveals that both Kelsi and Ryan have won the Juilliard scholarship (“We’re All in This Together (Graduation Mix)”). Taylor will go to Yale University; Sharpaywill go to University of Albuquerque and along with that, she will also assist Ms. Darbus in running the drama department in the fall (so that Tiara does not get to take over the Drama Department). Troy decides to go to the University of California, Berkeley, where he can play basketball, study drama, and be close to Gabriella. After learning about Troy’s decision, Chad runs offstage and into the school gym. There he and Troy work things out and learn that their college’s basketball teams will play each other the upcoming fall. Chad decides to attend the University of Albuquerque (U of A).\n\nAt the graduation ceremony, Troy gives the class speech. Throwing their caps in the air, the graduates form a giant wildcat before breaking out into song and dance (“High School Musical”). The six stars walk down the field where a curtain closes off the graduation ceremony and turns into a stage. The six stars do their signature jump and then the camera does a close up of each actor. They take their final bow as the curtain closes.\n\nREVIEW:\n\nYeah, yeah, yeah…I know what you’re saying. Why did I even waste my time with watching this crap? Well, the OCD in me couldn’t help it. I had seen the first two, and though I wasn’t in a rush to see this one, it was eating me up inside that I hadn’t. After watching it this afternoon, I must say I wasn’t bored, but rather surprised.\n\nDon’t mistake me for being a fan of this franchise, because I’m not, but of the 3 films, there is a toss up between this and the first one for the best, yet none compare to real musicals, in my opinion. We all know this has become nothing more than a cash cow for Disney, but at the same time it has made stars of Zac Efron, Vanesa Hudgens, Ashley Tisdale, and to a lesser extent Corbin Bleu, Luxas Grabel, Monique Coleman, and pretty much anyone else under 18 who spoke on camera.\n\nThe film, as the title tells you, puts these characters in their senior year of high school. Apparently, the senior class has to do a spring musical. The theme for this year is “High School Musical” (not the original film, but rather a generic term). As the film progresses we get all kinds of drama and what not. What do you expect, tweens and teens are the target audience.\n\nMusically speaking, the songs aren’t bad. As a matterof fact a few of them are quite catchy, but as with any musical, there are those that just seem to be there as filler, and those that aren’t the great. It happens. Still, the music is a great improvement over the last film. Amazing what a bigger budget can get you.\n\nThe acting (and plot) hasn’t really improved over time, save for Zac Efron, who has become a leading man in Hollywood and is no doubt destined for big things. As for the rest of the cast, they have their moments, but for the most part, they just seem like they were more nervous about being on the big screen and not really giving it their all.\n\nDid I like this film? Yes. Would I watch it again? Yes. Would I rush out and buy it? No. Not because it isn’t good, but rather its not my cup of tea. Every one has their own tastes. This just isn’t mine, but I won’t sit here and bash something that is good, clean, fun.\n\nIt feels as if they wanted to bring the spirit of the first film back and make it bigger for the big screen. I tip my hat to them for doing so without losing any of its spirit. It is all too common for a film to make he jump and lose everything it stands for, mutating into something almost unrecognizable. Now, I hear there is a 4th film in the works. The new characters that were introduced will no doubt be the ones that are tapped to carry this franchise or kill it. Good luck to them!\n\n4 out of 5 stars\n\nPLOT:\n\nOn May 3, 1962, Tracy Turnblad (Nikki Blonsky), a cheerful, rotund high school student living in Baltimor, Maryland, endures a day’s worth of school so that she and her best friend Penny Pingleton (Amanda Bynes) can race home to view their favorite TV program, The Corny Collins Show. The program, a teen dance show, is broadcast from Baltimore’s station WYZT on weekday afternoons.\n\nThe teenagers featured on the show attend Tracy and Penny’s school, in particular the arrogant rich girl Amber Von Tussle (Brittany Snow) and her boyfriend Link Larkin (Zac Efron), with whom Tracy is madly in love. Amber’s mother Velma (Michelle Pfeiffer) manages station WYZT, and goes out of her way to make sure that Amber is prominently featured and that The Corny Collins Showremains a segregated program. Corny Collins (James Marsden) and all of his “Council Members” are white; black kids are only allowed on The Corny Collins Showon “Negro Day”, held the last Tuesday of each month and hosted by local rhythm and blues radio DJ “Motormouth” Maybelle (Queen Latifah).\n\nNeither Tracy’s reclusive laundress mother Edna (John Travolta) nor Penny’s strict Catholic mother Prudy (Allison Janney) approve of their daughters basing their lives around a TV show, particularly one where teens dance to “race music”. Tracy’s father, Wilbur (Christopher Walken), a joke-shop proprietor, is far more lenient. On one day’s show, Corny Collins announces that one of his “Council Members” is going on a leave of absence, and that auditions for a replacement will be held the next morning during school hours. When Tracy attends, Velma rejects Tracy at the audition for being overweight and supportive of integration. Tracy is sent to detention for skipping school, learning that the African-American students practice their dance in the school’s detention hall. Tracy befriends the detention hall’s best dancer, Motormouth Maybelle’s son, Seaweed (Elijah Kelley), who teaches Tracy several R&B dance moves. These moves secure Tracy a position in The Corny Collins Show.\n\nTracy quickly becomes one of Corny’s most popular “Council Members” and a threat to Velma’s wish to have Amber win the show’s yearly “Miss Teenage Hairspray” pageant. Tracy also becomes a threat to Amber’s courtship of Link, as the boy becomes increasingly fond of Tracy and less so of Amber. Tracy’s popularity earns her a sponsorship offer from clothes salesman Mr. Pinky (Jerry Stiller), who wants Tracy to be the spokesgirl for his “Hefty Hideaway” boutique. Tracy convinces Edna to accompany her to the “Hefty Hideaway” and act as her negotiating agent, and in the process brings her mother’s days as an agoraphobe to an end.\n\nAt school, Tracy introduces Seaweed to Penny, whereupon the two are instantly smitten with each other. One afternoon after Amber deliberately has Tracy sent to detention, Link causes the teacher to send him after her. There, Seaweed invites the girls and Link to follow him and his sister Little Inez (Taylor Parks) to a platter party at Motormouth Maybelle’s record shop. At the party, Maybelle informs everyone that Velma has canceled “Negro Day”. Tracy, in reply, suggests that Maybelle and the others stage a protest march, which they plan for the next afternoon, a day before the “Miss Teenage Hairspray” pageant. Link, scheduled to sing at the pageant and fearing for his budding career, does not attend the demonstration, disappointing Tracy. Meanwhile in Tracy’s father’s joke shop, Velma visits Wilbur and flirts with him, and Edna arrives home and finds Velma, sitting on Wilbur and then pushing him up against the wall. Distraught, Edna kicks Wilbur out and bans Tracy from ever performing on that show, which was Velma’s intention. Tracy talks with her father and he and Edna reconcile through song and dance.\n\nThe next morning, Tracy sneaks out of the house to join the protest march, which comes to a halt at a police roadblock set up by Velma. The entire company of protesters is arrested, although Tracy manages to escape. She flees to the Pingletons’ house, where Penny lets her hide in a basement fallout shelter. Prudy discovers Tracy and calls the police while tying Penny to her bed upstairs with a jump rope. Seaweed and his friends, having been bailed out by Wilbur, arrive and help Tracy and Penny escape. The kids then concoct a plan to crash the “Miss Teenage Hairspray” pageant. Meanwhile, Link visits Tracy’s house to look for her, and realizes that he is as much in love with her as she is with him. Seaweed and Penny also acknowledge their love during the escape from her house.\n\nWith the pageant underway, Velma, leaving nothing to chance, places policemen around and inside station WYZT to prevent Tracy from entering. In addition, Velma switches the tallies from the pageant’s phone lines so that Amber is guaranteed to win. Penny arrives at the pageant with an incognito Edna, while Wilbur, Seaweed, and Seaweed’s friends help Tracy infiltrate the studio in time to participate in the “Miss Teenage Hairspray” dance contest. Link breaks away from Amber to dance with Tracy; later, he pulls Inez, who has just arrived at WYZT with Maybelle, to the stage to dance in the pageant.\n\nAgainst all expectations, Inez receives the most votes and wins the pageant, officially integrating The Corny Collins Show. A perturbed Velma loudly declares her frustration, informing her daughter of the tally-switching scheme. Unbeknownst to Velma, Edna has turned a camera on her, and Velma’s outburst is broadcast live on the air, causing her to be fired from the program. Meanwhile, The Corny Collins Show set explodes into a celebration as Link and Tracy cement their love with a kiss.\n\nREVIEW:\n\nAs musicals go, this is one of my favorites. Admittedly, I wasn’t a big fan of the original Hairspray movie. That may be due to the fact that I saw this one first.\n\nNikki Blonsky gives one of the best performances I’ve ever seen by anyone, rather they’re a Hollywood veteran or newcomer. Hopefully, she’ll get more roles in the future. Quenn Latifah and Christopher Walken are great as always. Michelle Pfeiffer does a pretty good job, but she needs to eat a sandwich or two. John Travolta is a brave and talented man to spend the entire time on screen dressed in drag. Even when he sings, it’s in his Edna voice. However, my Baltimore friends have said that the accent left something to be desired. Having never been to Baltimore, I can’t fault him for that. Zac Efron is destined for greatness, and this role is just going to help his star (along with the High School Musical movies)\n\nThis move is perfect, save for one thing. The end number, “You Can’t Stop the Beat”, seemed to go on forever. Don’t get me wrong, I love the song, but it just seemed like it was going on and on. I felt like they could have cut a bit out of it and inserted one of the songs from the end credits in the film.\n\nIn this time of darkness, it is good to see a light movie. Also, this film was a surprise hit of the summer of 2007. Had it not been for Transformers and Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, it might have been the top grossing film of that summer.\n\nAs you can guess, I highly recommend this film, especially if you’re a fan of musicals, or just want to see something that isn’t all dark and emo like most most movies are these days.\n\n5 out of 5 stars"
