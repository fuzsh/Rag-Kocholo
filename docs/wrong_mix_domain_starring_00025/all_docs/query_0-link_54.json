It makes you feel sad, emotional, depressed, angry, then full of life and happy. \nIt‚Äôs a very hard and gruelling look at the Von Erichs family, who for anyone who doesn‚Äôt know went through some pretty hard times and some seriously bad luck. \nIt‚Äôs so frickin good. The brotherly love here is so amazing and the four brothers have such a deep connection with each other that it really shines through the all hardships and the shit life threw at them all. \nThis is Efron‚Äôs BEST performance without a shadow of a doubt.\nThe whole cast is really insanely brilliant!\nDefinitely deserved of another few watches too!\n5 ‚≠êÔ∏è \n#films #movies #movietime #cinematography #cinema #theironclaw  #sad #wrestling #zacefron  #lilyjames  #jeremyallenwhite  #mauratierney  #lifeaffirming #lionsgate  #a24 #filmbuff #filmfan\".",
