        "text": "Plot: Celebrates the birth of show business, and tells of a visionary who rose from nothing to create a spectacle that became a worldwide sensation.\n\nI’m speedily typing this out before I don’t finish again and then couldn’t be bothered to save my draft – yes, I did that three times. The Greatest Showman is a great way to start 2018. I really enjoyed this uplifting, beautiful and gorgeously crafted film and I was legitimately upset when it finished – I wanted more and still want more. A quick look into PT Barnum’s actual life is enough to tell you that this film isn’t a true depiction of his life. He seems to have been a driven and successful businessman, surely nice, but not the outstanding charm that Hugh Jackman brings to this movie. How charming is he? How excellent does he sing and dance? It is beautiful. Michelle Williams is also stunning in this role, I’ve never before quite liked her quite this much. She is a motherly presence and her scenes with the two daughters are beautiful and playful. Then there is Zac Efron, who seems the most comfortable in life when he can be artistic – every film of his where he’s actually been good in is some sort of musical. He’s charming and dazzling, and uses his expressive eyes to lure you into his love for Anne (Zendaya), the flexible and gorgeous trapeze artist who has had one too many rich person sneer at her. The love story wasn’t necessary, but it was still sweet.\n\nIn a time where people out of the norm is under attack, The Greatest Showman takes a clear line in defense with its’ celebration of the strange and unusual, showing they have a place in this world and deserves respect. The townspeople who so vehemently opposes PT Barnum’s circus is perhaps just a bit of social commentary on the current residing office in a whole lot of countries. They don’t understand, so they hate. Yet the circus becomes a tight little group, and not even Barnum’s sudden lack of interest in them when he spots Jenny Lind (Rebecca Fergusson) can stop them from remaining tightly knit. Fergusson did not do her own singing and merely acted the role, but she was utterly convincing as the up and coming Lind, who (if you look at Jackman in that red jacket you would too) develops a massive infatuation on Barnum, seeing their similar upbringings and struggles as an important link. Tragic strikes Barnum in multiple ways and he’s left with a damaged marriage and a tattered circus, but since this movie is all about happiness he rebuilds both quickly.\n\nIs it idealistic? Yes. Is it highly improbably that Barnum was such a nice man? Definitely. However, the colors and choreography, combined with the acting, singing and wonderful set design, makes The Greatest Showman one of the most enjoyable films I have ever seen. It’s a bit early in the year to declare a film a favorite of the year (and also I’ve literally only seen one 2018 release yet), but if we measure only in pure enjoyment then I doubt anything will beat The Greatest Showman this year for me.\n\nRating: 9/10\n\nHere is my monthly rundown of what I was up to the previous month. Right now it is still pretty much only addressing entertainment, but I hope to add some more life things into it soon too. Please feel free to comment below if you’ve seen any of these, or just to say hi!\n\nSouthpaw (2015) – I love a good sport movie. Even though they are all pretty much the same story, I’m always caught up. It was no less with Southpaw, and even though Jake Gyllenhaal irrationally annoyed the shit out of me, I really enjoyed this one.\n\nLetters to Juliet (2010) – Amanda Seyfried delivers another charming performance. Objectively I know this isn’t a strong film, but it is so feel good I actually couldn’t care less about ratings. It is foolishly optimistic and cheerful, and a great film to watch if you are feeling down.\n\nThe Wedding Singer (1998) – The 90’s atmosphere, combined with a surprisingly affable Adam Sandler and an adorable Drew Barrymore, I enjoyed this more than I thought I would. Definitely one of the best Adam Sandler films I’ve ever seen.\n\nMy Best Friend’s Wedding (1997) – I HATED the ending and I really disliked the main character. What a stupid movie.\n\nEnchanted (2007): This spectacular Disney production made me so happy when I watched it again. It is on a grand scale and very elaborate and so lovely to look at.\n\nUnderworld (2003), Evolution (2006), Rise of the Lycans (2009), and Awakening (2012)\n\nAfter years of ignorance I am finally familiarizing myself with this franchise. I had a great time with all these movies. Seline is such a strong female character and saves herself and her love more than once, and the feminist in me was cheering all the way.\n\nFour Weddings and a Funeral (1994)\n\nContinuing on this journey to watch more romantic films that are seen as classics, I got to see this. It was… okay. Hugh Grant really was quite the adorable English actor in his prime, and it is easy for him to be quietly charming. Andie McDowell also had no clue how to act. I’m not sure if she’s ever had a clue in that regard, but it really is prominent here.\n\nThe Lucky One (2012)\n\nThe Lucky One is not by any means the worst Nicholas Sparks film – Best of Me still holds that title – but what is most notable is the awful acting. Taylor Schilling and Zac Efron just don’t gel together. I’m forced to ask whether Zac Efron actually has a brain – there is nothing shining behind those pretty blue eyes. Sure, he’s cute and ripped, but his attempt at a tortured marine invoked less sympathy than concern about synapses firing at an appropriate rate. Schilling, yeah, also pretty bad. They also have zero chemistry and the scenes looked stage and neither actor really wanted their hands on each other. Okay, I’m done. But sheesh.\n\nKong: Skull Island (2017)\n\nKong: Skull Island is what it was supposed to be: a nice action packed adventure with a handsome cast and a big gorilla. Ticked all the boxes for me, excellent popcorn entertainment.\n\nPower Rangers (2017)\n\nI had not planned going to cinema for this. I would have preferred John Wick, but I was sorely outvoted by a bunch of 30 year old men who wanted to watch Power Rangers. There is something to be said for nostalgia. I ended up having a decent enough time – I was unaware up until this point that Power Rangers could be made into something that resembles a non-cheesy film. I’m still shocked.\n\nThe Guardians Trilogy by Nora Roberts: Stars of Fortune, Bay of Sighs and Island of Glass\n\nI read these three books in the span of two weeks and I don’t regret one second of it. It is the most fun I’ve had in ages with Nora Roberts’ fantasy work.\n\nHarry Potter and The Half Blood Prince (JK Rowling)\n\nThe penultimate book in the best series to have ever been written is overshadowed in intensity only by the last book. Half Blood Prince is consistently one of my favorites. It features the more mature trio, naturally Dumbeldore’s death and the discovery of the reason behind Voldemort’s apparent immortality.\n\nHarry Potter and The Deathly Hallows (JK Rowling)\n\nHorace Slughorn returning to the castle to fight, Snape’s secret, Fred dying, Lupin and Tonks, Colin Creevy being tiny in death, Kreacher’s bullfrog voice, Dobby’s death, Hagrid throwing MacNair, Molly vs. Bellatrix– the last hundred pages of this book is nonstop goosebumps. I get tears in my eyes every time. Every. Single. Time. Deathly Hallows binds every single event that occurred in Potter from the very first page of The Philosopher’s Stone to the very last page of Deathly Hallows in a neat bow. This is truly the best thought out work I’ve ever read by an author.\n\nAngel’s Fall (Nora Roberts)\n\nI really enjoy reading through my Nora collection at least once a year. Right now I’m with Reece and Brody, and I particularly enjoy the book – I like both main characters, the setting, the plot and development of said plot.\n\nOctober was by far the slowest month in my year in entertainment. I’m really hopeful that this is the last semester where I will ever have to write a BSc Theoretical exam, so I’ve spent every moment that I wasn’t at work in front of a book. I really hope it will pay off – my heart won’t be able to handle the trauma of failing a subject. So it has been quiet on the entertainment front and even the blog front, but I’ve managed to include see and read some things here and there though, so here is a quick rundown J\n\nWatched:\n\nBourne Supremacy\n\nI really hope I wrote a proper review on this, because I can barely recall the film now. I know it was fast paced and good and very Bourne, and I guess that is what counts.\n\n10 Cloverfield Lane\n\nI LOVED this. The review should be up some time this week, and I am totally with the crowd on this one. It was a phenomenal performance from all three main characters, and they were able to create maddening suspense throughout.\n\nNew Year’s Eve (2011)\n\nI was quite obsessed with this film (to get to see it), and it was so meh. It was probably one of the last films Gary Marshall ever produced, and I hoped it would be something similar to Valentine’s Day. In all essence it was but lacked the heart.\n\nYou Again (2010)\n\nI enjoyed this on the most basic level. It had a pretty good message that bullying stays with you forever and it was nice to watch such a light movie where romance wasn’t the core of the plot.\n\nThe Choice (2016)\n\nI have this game with Nicholas Sparks movies where I HAVE to watch it despite knowing it will probably end up being super crap. But The Choice is one of the better ones, certainly better than the awful Best of Me, and I has a somewhat of a decent time with it.\n\nRead:\n\nThe Woman Who Stole My Life (Marian Keyes)\n\nI finally finished TWWSTM. It was gigantic, and maybe 50 pages too long and then ended up with a rough ending, but this is the least bizarre book I’ve read from Keyes in a while.\n\nDefinitely Dead / All Together Dead / From Dead to Worse\n\nExam brain wants me back on books where I need no brain power, and I’ve been reading some of the Southern Vampire Mysteries again. I’ve actually been having a really good time with this non-Pulitzer material.\n\nNew Moon (Stephanie Meyer)\n\nI’m slowly making my way through these books. Bella is a joy to behold in this particular novel, let me tell you. I always have fun with this – part enjoyment; part scoffing, and it has been the perfect read throughout exam time.\n\nI am Number Four (Pittacus Lore)\n\nThis book is SO good. It is obviously a book that was written at the beginning of the dystopic craze; because the ideas are original and GOOD, and things are named intelligently (the naming conventions in other dystopian novels are quite ridiculous). I need to finish this still, but it is going well.\n\nOn a Life front, those of you who follow me on Instagram will know that I got myself a new car. It really wasn’t an option as I was in a car accident that wrote my little Suzuki Alto off. To say I was upset was an understatement, and it was pretty stressful sorting it out. I have to say my insurers were absolutely fantastic, and I will (and have) recommended them to anybody. However, it was the first car I’d ever owned, and I was so heart sore about the entire process.\n\nIt feels like a lot of things have happened the last month. I’ve had a dear friend in hospital, I’ve been in an accident, there was a break-in at my sister’s boyfriend’s house and another friend of mine got attacked and robbed at gunpoint. So it’s been quite hectic. I’m in need of a Bilbo Baggins holiday to say the LEAST. Oh, I also went to a bachelorettes that was quite wild, and let me tell you, I was shocked at some of the actions there. I’ve been to a significant amount of wild parties in my young life, so when I am shocked, I am S.H.O.C.K.E.D. It feels like I need a peaceful December without any drama. I am on leave for two weeks at the end of December (hear me sobbing in gratitude), and I am so happy that I will get to a place where I don’t need to start functioning at 4:30 am. It will be great.\n\nAnyway, what’s news on your side?\n\nPS: Let’s not even talk about my Blindspot progress. It’s worse than the state of the American election right now.\n\nPPS: I can’t wait until Hillary wins JUST so that Donald can shut TF up.\n\nWoohoo! Happy Friday!! This post was supposed to be a Five things Friday but as you can see it escalated quite quickly! Here is some love for all the young ones in Hollywood… I know some of them can’t really be classified as really young, or even really good, but I like all of these for a variety of reasons. Read, enjoy, and let me know if you agree or disagree. I might just do one for older Hollywood too at a stage. I’ve linked to the posts of the movies I’ve reviewed of these stars so go take a look if you are wildly bored!\n\nEmma Stone\n\nWhy I admire her: She is crazy talented, extremely funny and incredibly beautiful. She also seems to have a genuinely nice personality off screen, which is quite important to me.\n\nBest role: What’s not to love? Zombieland, Easy A, Crazy Stupid Love, the list is endless.\n\nWorst role: Ghost of Girlfriends Past\n\nBenedict Cumberbatch\n\nWhy I admire him: There is such a unique and startling quality to him. He is incredibly talented and well suited to his most famous role. He has these unique looks that make no sense. I’ve never pinpointed why he is so attractive – it shouldn’t work and yet it does extremely well.\n\nBest role: Sherlock (as Sherlock Holmes)\n\nWorst role: har-har\n\nEmma Watson\n\nWhy I admire her: Not only is she a staunch equal rights activist, Emma Watson has manage to exit her Harry Potter years with grace and determination. I honestly can’t wait for her to be Belle in the new Disney adaption!\n\nBest Role: Perks of Being a Wallflower (as Sam)\n\nWorst Role: Harry Potter (as Hermione Granger)\n\nChris Hemsworth\n\nWhy I admire him: Hehe, he’s ridiculously hot. The muscles and arms and hair and eyes and length and did I mention muscles? I’ve mostly really just liked the look of him, but he really did impress in Rush, which makes me believe that he can be in some really good films in the future.\n\nBest role: Rush (as James)\n\nWorst role: Thor (as Thor)\n\nChris Evans\n\nWhy I admire him: He has this extremely likable boy next door vibe. I also think he is exceptionally well cast as Steve Rogers, capturing that genuine essence of good so central to the character.\n\nBest role: Captain America (as Steve Rogers)/Snowpiercer (as Curtis)\n\nWorst role: Fantastic Four (as Human Torch)\n\nTom Hardy\n\nWhy I admire him: Well, duh. Look at him. He’s done some phenomenal roles as well, and has the extra addition of having pulled himself from a difficult past to be what he is today. #respect\n\nBest role: Lawless (as Forrest Bondurant) and The Dark Night Rises (as Bane)\n\nWorst Role: This Means War (as Tuck)\n\nAndrew Garfield\n\nWhy I admire him: He’s extremely cute and extremely likeable and very good in the things I’ve seen him in.\n\nBest Role: The Amazing Spiderman (as Peter Parker)\n\nWorst Role: I’ve only seen him in Never Let Me Go other than as Spidey, and I liked that too, so I guess I don’t have one for him\n\nJames McAvoy\n\nWhy I admire him: The Scottish accent, the brilliance of how he portrays Charles Xavier. The hair. The acting. Have I mentioned the Scottish accent?\n\nBest role: X-men (as Professor X)\n\nWorst role: Wanted (as Wesley Gibson). He wasn’t necessarily bad, I just didn’t like the movie at all.\n\nRyan Gosling\n\nWhy I like him: He inspired the “Hey Girl” meme. He’s pretty good at acting. He is the best Nicholas Sparks hero ever. He was hilarious in Stupid Crazy Love. He’s pretty much the coolest.\n\nBest role: Drive (as the Driver)\n\nWorst role: I will say as Noah Calhoun in the Notebook, but he’s actually really good in that too\n\nEmily Blunt\n\nWhy I admire her: Her role as Rita. GIRL POWER. I also really enjoyed her in The Devil Wears Prada. She’s pretty cool.\n\nBest role: Edge of Tomorrow (as Rita)\n\nWorst role: The Five Year Engagement (as Violet)\n\nEmilia Clark\n\nWhy I admire her: She seems like a person who enforces her privacy, and I think it is really important if you want to stay sane in Hollywood. I really like her casting as Dany – she does such a great job. And how insanely beautiful is she?!?!\n\nBest role: Game of Thrones (as Daenerys Targaryen)\n\nWorst role: Has she even been in anything else?\n\nShailene Woodley\n\nShe’s the girl who made us all cry uncontrollably last year. She’s quirky and the outrageous things she says keeps me laughing for days. She seems genuine and she has such great stores of talent that she’s busy developing.\n\nBest role: The Fault in our Stars (as Hazel Grace Lancaster)\n\nWorst role: Divergent (as Tris Prior)\n\nJoseph Gordon-Levitt\n\nWhy I admire him: He’s the cute geeky kid who grew up. I would really like to see him lead in something now!\n\nBest role: Ten Things I Hate about You (as Cameron James)\n\nWorst role: Another actor that I find extremely enjoyable even when I don’t like the movie 😀\n\nZac Efron\n\ndid your screen also steam up for a second?\n\nWhy I admire him: The funny thing is that this guy still needs to prove himself. I just really enjoy his looks, although he hasn’t been atrocious in his work, even if the movies have been bad.\n\nBest role: The Lucky One (as Logan Thibault)\n\nWorst role: Highschool musical (as Tray Bolton)\n\nChanning Tatum\n\nWhy I admire him: He’s the extremely likable guy who finally made a name for himself.\n\nBest role: 21/22 Jump Street (as Jenko)\n\nWorst role: The Vow (as Leo)\n\nHonorable mentions:\n\nAnsel Elgort\n\nKit Harrington\n\nMiles Teller\n\nChloe Grace Moretz (who recently won me over with Kick-Ass)\n\nRachel McAdams\n\nLiam Hemsworth\n\nBrit Robertson\n\nWhat did you think? Let me know!\n\nI hope you guys enjoyed my double posting yesterday – HINT: I accidentally scheduled both posts for Tuesday instead of Tuesday and Wednesday, and I realized this at work. Sometimes I really do wonder if I’m as smart as my mom thinks I am…\n\nTo continue our nice cheese venture we will today take a look at the Nicholas Sparks movie adaptations I’ve seen. Of the nine movie adaptions Sparks produced I’ve seen seven, which you can see listed below. The other two are Message in a Bottle and Nights in Rodanthe is definitely something I’ll find the time to watch and then come tell you all about it.\n\nWhen you willingly choose to watch a Nicholas Sparks movie, you can know for a fact that it will be unbelievable, inconceivable and utterly romantic. Nicholas Sparks is Disney for grownups – the male lead is sensitive and wants you to love him eternally and the woman is damn lucky to find him wandering on her little stretch of Southern American road. There will be villains but mostly there will be love and adventure and lots of smooch time.\n\nStill, I can watch most of these movies and have fun while doing it. It sets you on an emotional high and even though it creates a false idea in your head permanently that men are like that, you still feel pretty happy afterwards (the depression sets in when Spark’s kills someone, and he loves killing, that man)\n\nNic Sparks movies watched, ranked from best to worst:\n\nThe Notebook (2004)\n\nA Walk To Remember (2002)\n\nThe Lucky One (2012)\n\nDear John (2010)\n\nSafe Haven (2013)\n\nThe Last Song (2010)\n\nBest of Me (2014)\n\nFemale Leads\n\nFirst Place: Rachel McAdams as Allie Hamilton\n\nRachel McAdams has always been the epitome of class to me. Even from her days as skanky Regina George, McAdams made sure you notice her and it wasn’t surprising to anyone that she became the most successful of the Mean Girls clan. McAdams plays a darling Southern girl perfectly and even though she is hampered by the time she grows up in Allie Hamilton still gets her say in things and she is determined.\n\nSecond Place: Mandy Moore as Jamie Sullivan\n\nA Walk to Remember went down when Mandy Moore was still relevant, and I’m surprised this didn’t take her even further into fame. She manages to be the sweet, innocent and sincere Jamie without being too sugary and that is a mean feat to achieve. She also worked really well with Shane West, and they complement each other well enough so that you end up sobbing for them. I really do enjoy A Walk to Remember – it is a book and a movie where Nicholas Sparks was still original and had fresh ideas, and you couldn’t predict what would happen.\n\n#bringBackOriginality\n\nThird Place: Amanda Seyfried as Savannah Curtis\n\nAmanda Seyfried probably ranks as one of my favorite young female actresses. I love her unique looks and her acting ability. She always seems so sweet and pure and that made her perfect as Savannah. I don’t think she has a lot of chemistry with Channing Tatum but they made a good pair onscreen and I also really liked Savannah’s character – she put others above her own needs and cared for the people in her life.\n\nHonorable mention: Miley Cyrus as Ronnie Miller\n\nI used to adore Miley Cyrus. Really, I know she grated on everybody’s nerves long before she grated against Robin Thicke, but I’ve always liked her voice. She wasn’t by any stretch of the imagination a good actress in the The Last Song, but it was pretty much the last time we all understood Miley Cyrus. I also really liked her and Hemsworth together (reunite now, lovebirds!)\n\nMale Leads: Deliciousness always\n\nTo land a spot as the main man in a Nicholas Sparks movie, there are two main requirements:\n\nOne: Be so hot you are one of the main culprits in a sudden increase in global warming\n\nTwo: Have the ability to look pained/pensive/heroic with extra benefits if you can do all these at once.\n\nThat said, most actors in these adaptions have done a very good job and they are all fine actors. I think some of them like Channing Tatum and Zac Efron (Especially Efron) are still proving themselves in Hollywood and romantic movies is a good way to get noticed #MatthewMcConaughey\n\nFirst Place: Ryan Gosling as Noah Calhoun\n\nMy favorite actor in this set of movies is definitely Ryan Gosling: I love the man, I loved Noah in the books and how Gosling represented Noah in the adaption. Gosling himself is three hundred percent charm and can act exceptionally well. The Chemistry between the main characters is another topic but the intense attraction between Gosling and McAdams also contribute greatly to the success of both their roles.\n\nSecond Place: Shane West as Landon Carter\n\nShane West has the perfect face and personality to be the angry teenager with a chip on his shoulder. He worked as Landon Carter as few others could have and he brought the change that took place in Landon after he met Jamie to the table authentically. He had very decent character development – Landon was a spoiled rich kid that found something more rewarding to live for than getting in trouble all the time.\n\nThird Place: James Marsden as Dawson Cole\n\nI had a truckload of issues with this movie, but James Marsden as the leading man in Best of Me was a good choice, even if he had no chemistry with Michelle Monaghan. Marsden is cute as hell, he can act, he has gorgeous blue eyes and he is a perfect mix of defiance and sweetness in his portrayal of Cole.\n\nHonorable mention: Zac Efron as Logan Thibault\n\nFor the sake of full disclosure, I’m admitting I just wanted him on here because he’s so gorgeous. That, and he really did the sad, hardworking ex-marine thing well (go talk to Zoë about that obsession of mine)\n\nYes, It’s Zac Efron holding a dog. You’re welcome!\n\nDeath of a Central Character:\n\nContenders:\n\nGeorge Martin\n\nSuzanne Collins\n\nVeronica Roth\n\nJK Rowling\n\nNicholas Sparks\n\nIn this epic battle Veronica Roth and Suzanne Collins would square off, but I think Collins would win as the most psycho writer because we loved Finnick WAY more than we loved Tris, right? Then as our next set of contenders we would have George Martin killing Nicholas Sparks without mercy (beheading, of course) while JK Rowling would not even notice them and keep writing in her castle, smugly, because she killed Dumbledore, Mad-Eye, Hedwig, Dobby, Lupin, Tonks, Fred, Sirius and Snape within a book and a half.\n\nMy point here is that Sparks sure loves killing people off but it is usually after they’ve gotten some bits of happiness in. The impact is also less because his books are singular entries and not a continuing series, so your attachment, book or movie-wise is not gut wrenching forever.\n\nThe title for the saddest Nicholas Sparks movie is shared by The Notebook and A Walk To Remember. You can still argue that A Walk To Remember is worst, because Noah and Allie end up together for a few decades before they both die whereas Jamie dies on Landon a few months after they fall in love.\n\nBook Vs Movie\n\nBut will I rewatch?\n\nBest of Me (2014): No. It’s mediocre at best and there are far better alternatives if you want some cheesy romance.\n\nSafe Haven (2013): Maybe – It’s not horrid but it’s not the best movie either\n\nThe Lucky One (2012): It has Zac Efron in, I definitely will\n\nThe Last Song (2010): Hmmm, maybe.\n\nThe Notebook (2004): You mean apart from the other ten times I’ve rewatched? Then yes.\n\nDear John (2010): Hmmm, maybe.\n\nA Walk to Remember (2002): Definitely. Nothing better than a good cry 😀\n\nHope you enjoyed this enormous post! Let me know what your opinions are about the movies you’ve seen on this list!"
