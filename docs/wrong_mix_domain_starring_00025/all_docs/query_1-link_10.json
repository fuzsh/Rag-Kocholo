Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? .\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLindsay Lohan was already an established star before playing new girl Cady Heron.\n\nLohan's first film role was as a child actress in \"The Parent Trap.\" Before \"Mean Girls,\" she was in the Disney Channel movies \"Life-Size\" and \"Get a Clue\" and continued in other Disney hits \"Freaky Friday\" and \"Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHer career has since had some ups and downs.\n\nThe same year \"Mean Girls\" came out, Lohan released a debut album. Some run-ins with the law, including charges of driving under the influence and cocaine possession, as well as some stints in rehab slowed her career.\n\nShe appeared in commercials for Lawyer.com and has opened VIP clubs and restaurants in Greece. Lohan also shocked fans when she filmed herself harassing a homeless family and accusing them of human trafficking.\n\nHer MTV reality show, \"Lindsay Lohan's Beach Club\" premiered in January 2019, and took place at Lohan Beach House in Mykonos, Greece. It was reportedly canceled after one season and the titular beach house looks like it's no longer in business, based on its Tripadvisor page.\n\nThese days, Lohan is keeping busy in Europe. She opened two nightclubs in Greece and starred on the British show \"Sick Note.\"\n\nShe now lives in Dubai and considers it safer than America. In a June 2018 interview with The New York Times, the actress-turned-entrepreneur revealed that she is in the process of designing her own island in Dubai.\n\nIn April 2020, Lohan returned to the music scene with a new track called \"Back to Me.\"\n\nThe actress also reunited virtually with the \"Mean Girls\" cast in 2020.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRachel McAdams rose to fame as mean girl Regina George.\n\nShe graduated with a theater degree from Canada's York University in 2001. Her Hollywood film debut was in \"The Hot Chick,\" where she starred alongside Rob Schneider and Anna Faris.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe actress was nominated for an Oscar for \"Spotlight\" and her most recent projects include \"Disobedience\" and \"Game Night.\"\n\nShe's also well known for starring in \"The Notebook,\" Guy Ritchie's \"Sherlock Holmes,\" Marvel's \"Doctor Strange,\" and was on the second season of \"True Detective.\" Most recently she starred alongside Will Ferrell in \"Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga.\"\n\nThe actress welcomed her first son with boyfriend James Linden in 2018 and went on to speak about motherhood in an interview with The Sunday Times UK.\n\n\"It's the greatest thing that's ever happened to me, hands down,\" she said. \"[People say] your life is not your own anymore. But I had 39 years of me, I was sick of me, I was so happy to put the focus on some other person.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLacey Chabert had some of the most memorable lines as Gretchen Wieners.\n\nChabert's first major role was on \"Party of Five.\" She also voiced Eliza Thornberry on \"The Wild Thornberrys.\"\n\nChabert is now a Hallmark movie queen.\n\nShe has been in more than 10 Hallmark movies and was also in \"Ghosts of Girlfriends Past.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAmanda Seyfried made her movie debut as the ditzy Karen Smith.\n\nBefore that, she did stints on the soap operas \"As the World Turns\" and \"All My Children.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSeyfried earned an Oscar nomination for her role as Marion Davies in David Fincher's \"Mank.\"\n\nOther projects of hers include shows \"Veronica Mars\" and \"Big Love\" and musical movies \"Mamma Mia!\" and \"Les Misérables.\" She was also in \"Gringo\" and starred alongside Milo Ventimiglia in 2019's \"The Art of Racing in the Rain.\"\n\nSeyfried also appeared in the \"Twin Peaks\" revival, returned for \"Mamma Mia!
