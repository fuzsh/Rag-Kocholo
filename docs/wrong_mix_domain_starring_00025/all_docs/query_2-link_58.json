        "text": "First things first, they're gonna have to change Regina's line to \"Get in you dumb dog. We're going late night.\"\n\nOne way or another, Mean Girls has been part of our lives since 2004 (if you were even born back then). Perhaps you tried to make \"fetch\" happen. Maybe your mate used to call you \"Glen Coco\"!\n\nIn any case, we've often wondered what the world of North Shore High School would look like if it was set in the Australian education system, and it looks like we're not the only ones.\n\nAussie TikTok comedian Samantha Andrew also possesses a deep love for all things Mean Girls â€” so much so that she even wrote her own musical version of the beloved film, long before the film was actually adapted for Broadway!\n\n@samanthandrew1\n\nYes this is fully real its a joy to be an artist #meangirlsmusical #meangirlsthemusical #reneerapp #tinafey #thespian #musicaltheatre #greenscreenvideo\n\nâ™¬ original sound - Samantha Andrew\n\n@samanthaandrew1 / Via tiktok.com\n\nSo, okay. Tina Fey never replied to Samantha's email about obtaining rights for Mean Girls 11 years ago, but that didn't stop the creator from reimagining her version of the musical on TikTok. This time around...it's complete with Australian slang.\n\n@samanthandrew1\n\nSomeone take our phone away from us xx also - we are on tour, if you havenâ€™t got your tix yet Perth & Adelaide whaaaat r u doing??ðŸ¥µðŸ¥µ #meangirlsmovie #meangirlsmusical #improvisedmusical #melandsam #meangirls #reneerapp\n\nâ™¬ original sound - Samantha Andrew\n\n@samanthandrew1 / Via tiktok.com\n\nIn a video with her best friend and podcasting partner, Mel O'Brien, Samantha improvised a musical theatre tune about Mean Girls if it were set in Australia.\n\nHere are all the references, explained:\n\n1. First off, \"sluzza\"!\n\n2. As for the place with all the stuff for Netball â€” \"Southland\" refers to a popular Westfield shopping centre in Melbourne.\n\n3. When she sings, \"You've gotta wear Rexona, wear Kookai\", those are the deodorant and clothing brands a lot of Aussie high school It Girls wore back in the day. If you weren't in Kookai, you weren't going to be a Plastic!\n\n4. Next up, let's talk about the lyric \"I rooted a guy behind the shed\"...\n\n5. And if you're wondering what the heck \"NAPLAN\" is, it's standardised testing that starts at the age of nine or 10.\n\n6. In this Australian version of Mean Girls, Regina George consumes a diet of \"LCMs\" instead of Calteen bars. These are a sweet, lunchbox snack made from rice krispy/bubble treats.\n\n7. And the most golden Australian reference of all is Samantha and Mel's sing-speak of the iconic Julia Gillard misogyny speech.\n\nIf you're unfamiliar with the speech that defined a generation, here's a taste:\n\nWhat do you think a Mean Girls set in Australia (or your country) would be like?\n\nShare it in the comments below!\n\nShare This Article"
