        "text": "'BEFORE I FALL' TRAILER\n\nZoey’s latest effort is yet another “gem” from the YA doldrums is 'Before I Fall', in which popularity reigns supreme, losing one's virginity seems like the most important thing in the world, there’s a weird chick, an overlooked boy, and it seems that everyone is just an onion waiting to be peeled.\n\nMeet Sam (Deutch). She’s on the verge of finally finishing high school alongside her three besties. All four girls are beautiful and popular yet have a mean streak. One Friday night after tormenting the class “weirdo” at a party, the girls are involved in a car crash, but when Sam wakes up it’s Friday morning all over again. Doomed to repeat the same day over and over again, Sam soon discovers that if her actions don’t mean anything, she’ll make them mean everything and finally right some wrongs.\n\nBased on the 2010 novel of the same name by Lauren Oliver, it’s definitely predictable and not particularly original or profound, but it does send a nice message about the ripple effects our actions have and questioning why we do the things we do. At 99 minutes, the repetition of days is limited enough that it doesn’t get tiresome, however the emotional issues that the characters face do come off as trite and are not nearly handled on a deep enough level to transcend its teen genre.\n\nUltimately, ‘Before I Fall’ boils down to live each day as if it were your last and be kind to one another - I can just watch ‘Ellen’ to get the same message. Nonetheless, my Zoey still has a ways to go before I can be truly proud, but she’s getting there."
