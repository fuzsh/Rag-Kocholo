        "text": "In his two most recent roles—first in That Awkward Moment, and this month, in Neighbors—Zac Efron has played a party-loving bro who's great at having fun but far less successful at being a Big Kid with Real Responsibilities. He's clearly really, really good at playing a Peter Pan-inspired character, not to mention really cute at it (also: cute at everything else in general, but you already know that).\n\nBut to remind us all that he's a versatile actor—remember that time he played nice-guy Troy and sang love songs in High School Musical?—he's just signed on to star in and produce a law thriller based on John Grisham's bestseller The Associate. Zac will be a Yale Law School graduate (so smart!) who's blackmailed by a bunch of bad guys to spy on the world's largest law firm. In other words, the opposite of everything he's played in the past.\n\nIt's been awhile since we've seen a Grisham adaptation on the big screen, but if it's anything like The Client (which you should probably see) and The Rainmaker (which you should definitely see), it'll be worth a movie ticket. Besides, if nothing else, it's an hour-plus of Zac Efron. No brainer.\n\nCelebrity Style\n\nWait, Was Florence Pugh’s Glastonbury ’Fit Inspired by Midsommar?\n\nWe have so many questions.\n\nCulture\n\nWhy Did Normani Skip the BET Awards 2024?\n\nThe singer directly addressed fans after canceling her scheduled performance one hour before the show's start.\n\nCulture\n\nWicked Movie Moves Up Premiere Date to Coincide With Gladiator II\n\nAnd the Barbenheimer comparisons have started."
