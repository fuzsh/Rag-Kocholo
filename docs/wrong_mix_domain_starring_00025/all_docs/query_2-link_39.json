        "text": "It’s November 1, which means it’s officially time to welcome the holiday season. Walmart was quick to kick off its own festivities, releasing its commercial this morning that featured the Mean Girls reunion paparazzi had captured at the beginning of October.\n\nThere’s no Rachel McAdams (thus no Regina George), but Lindsay Lohan, Amanda Seyfried, and Lacey Chabert reprised their roles as Cady, Karen, and Gretchen, respectively. They showed what their grown-up characters are doing now...and no surprise, Gretchen is the “I’m not a regular mom, I’m a cool mom” member of the group.\n\nMany scenes from the movie were recreated with Lohan, Seyfried, and Chabert’s characters acting as adults witnessing the next generation in high school. They look virtually the same—and still perfectly embody the characters. Seyfried’s Karen in particular is a highlight.\n\nThey aren’t the only Mean Girls cast members to make an appearance either. Watch and see who else you spot:\n\nLast November, Seyfried interviewed Lohan for Interview magazine, and the two had a mini Mean Girls reunion. They spoke about how they feel like people still see them as their teenage characters.\n\n“That was my first movie,” Seyfried recalled. “You were in the middle of the whole thing and you created a really fun vibe. I didn’t know how good it was going to be.”\n\n“I had a feeling, just because you don’t always have that much fun making movies and I knew it was going to show through,” Lohan said. “But I never realized what it would be, still today.”\n\n“Ten years ago I used to be like, ‘Yeah, yeah, I was Karen in Mean Girls, for fuck’s sake,’” Seyfried said. “Now I’m like, ‘I was Karen in Mean Girls!’ I’m very proud of it. You had a lot to do with where it went and what it was. I don’t know if you know that. I’m sure you felt the pressure but it didn’t seem like you did. You were working really young, and you were really good, but you were still a kid.”\n\nThey also addressed a Mean Girls sequel and their desire to reprise their roles.\n\n“I would kill just to do one week, all of us playing our own roles on Mean Girls on Broadway,” Seyfried said.\n\n“That would be really fun,” Lohan agreed.\n\n“Because a Mean Girls 2 is never going to happen, is it?” Seyfried pondered.\n\n“I don’t know. I heard something about it being a movie musical and I was like, ‘Oh no,’” Lohan said. “We can’t do that. It has to be the same tone.”\n\n“Yeah. It would just be completely different.” Seyfried said, then adding, “Anyway, Tina [Fey] is busy. She’ll get around to it. Listen, we’re all part of each other’s worlds whether we like it or not, and it is really nice to be in contact as adults.”\n\n“Yeah, everyone’s still the same,” Lohan said. “It’s fun to have certain memories that we can’t share with anyone else.”"
