        "text": "Just in case you aren’t already aware, every guy from the main cast of Mean Girls has come out as gay since the film first premiered. BuzzFeed has brought this fact to everyone’s attention, adding that the film has raised an entire generation of homosexuals – which is a little bit iconic.\n\nThe classic teen movie, which is everyone’s fav there is no denying it, was released in 2004. It has a few lead males as well as the mean leading girls too. These are Daniel Franzese who plays Damian, Jonathan Bennett who plays Aaron Samuels and Rajiv Surendra who is the chaotic fav, Kevin G. Yep – all of these guys in the Mean Girls cast are gay now!\n\nDaniel Franzese publicly came out in 2014\n\nDaniel Franzese, who played the too gay to function queer icon that is Damian in Mean Girls, came out as gay in 2014. During Pride Month five years later, Franzese opened up in an interview with AOL about his journey to coming out around the tenth anniversary of the Mean Girls film.\n\n“I get a lot of fan mail, but around the tenth anniversary of Mean Girls, I got a letter from a fan who was grown up that said, ‘When I was in 8th grade, I was beat up for being chubby and tortured for being a sissy, but then your movie came out and, in 9th grade, on the first day of school, the popular senior girls walked up to me and said, ‘You’re like Damian, come sit with us!'” He said. “And he was like, ‘Thank you so much, I don’t know if you’re gay or not…’ but then I realised it’s so important that I come out.”\n\nHe added: “And then I did come out, and I made two of my other co-stars come out — Kevin G and Aaron Samuels — we’re all gay!”\n\nJonathan Bennett said his friends knew he was gay when Mean Girls came out but he was advised to keep it a secret\n\nJonathan Bennett, who played Aaron Samuels, hadn’t made his sexuality known when the film was first released. In an interview with Too Fab, the actor spoke about coming out and that he was advised to keep his sexuality a secret when the film came out.\n\n“There comes a time in your life when you realise it just doesn’t matter and it’s not worth it to not just live completely open as yourself,” he said. “And that’s what happened for me. I never really talked about it when Mean Girls came out, my friends all knew. I just was kind of told by not anyone specifically, but everyone [to stay closeted]. We lived in a weird world where us actors who were working in the public eye at the time that were gay, we all didn’t know what to do.”\n\nHe continued: “The manual wasn’t there. So we were all figuring it out together. And you know it’s definitely changed a lot. It’s a better climate, but I don’t know if it would have changed if I would have come out earlier. I want to stress this to everyone: I don’t think people should be pressured into coming out just because they’re celebrities or because they’re actors or because they’re in the public eye or even because they’re gay. If they’re not ready, that’s OK, that’s their time and they can do it however they want and there’s no rule that says you have to do it a certain way. It’s everyone’s own journey and they can do it how they want. For me, I was like, OK, it was time. I was like, ‘Yep, I’m done. I’m over it.’ I’m like, fuckin’ don’t cast me, I don’t care.”\n\n“I’m also proud of Mean Girls because it was – for this generation – one of the first movies to have a predominantly gay character that was one of the leads. Damien was such an important part to a lot of high school kids for this generation,” he said of the film.\n\nJonathan got engaged in November of last year to presenter Jaymes Vaughan, who proposed on the set of a film called The Christmas House.\n\nRajiv Surendra believes he wouldn’t have got the Mean Girls role if he’d been openly gay\n\nAnd finally, it’s the man himself – Mr Kevin G. Rajiv Surendra, who is now a successful actor, writer, painter, and chalk artist, has said he doesn’t believe he would have made the Mean Girls cast had he been openly gay at the time. “I know full well that if I was an openly gay actor, there was no way I’d be considered for the role of a sixteen-year-old religious Indian kid in a movie that Fox was putting $100 million dollars into,” he told Kajal mag. “I never felt like it was unfair, I just accepted that that was the way the world worked.”\n\nHe continued: “Regarding cultural taboos, I grew up in a household where no aspect of sexuality whatsoever was ever mentioned, but what was easy for me is that I moved to a completely foreign country. I had complete anonymity there, which I think helped me come to terms with doing what I wanted. I didn’t need to be worried about what everyone else thought.” After Mean Girls, the actor moved to Munich in Germany, which he described as “magical” adding that “living there and going out with guys made me see how easy it was.”\n\nRelated stories recommended by this writer:\n\n• Mean Girls net worths: Who are the richest cast members now?\n\n• Which Mean Girls guy would you end up with?
