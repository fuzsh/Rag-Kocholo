        "text": "If you went to see Mean Girls in cinemas last month and had plans to rewatch at home now that the movie has been released digitally, you might notice a certain joke about Lindsay Lohan is missing from this final cut.\n\nAs noted by multiple outlets, the “fire crotch” joke made by Megan Thee Stallion during her small cameo in the new Mean Girls musical movie has officially been removed from the film's digital release after Lindsay Lohan voiced concerns.\n\nEarlier this year, Lindsay Lohan's long-time rep, Leslie Sloane, provided a statement to both The Messenger and People about the joke, saying, “Lindsay was very hurt and disappointed by the reference in the film.”\n\nIn a video from 2006, socialite Brandon Davis notoriously made distasteful comments about Lohan's body and used the term “fire crotch” to derogatorily refer to Lohan; Davis was recorded by paparazzi leaving a nightclub with Paris Hilton in the video, which was originally published by TMZ.\n\nLohan's father had also spoken out against the joke, calling it “disgusting” and expressing his frustration with the filmmakers to TMZ after the film's theatrical release.\n\nIn the 2024 version of Mean Girls, the term is used non-derogatorily in a small line of dialogue delivered by Megan Thee Stallion in a cameo. “Hot girls, we are going back red. Y2K fire crotch is back,” the singer says in a vertical video showing support for Angourie Rice's character Cady Heron, played by Lohan in the original 2004 film.\n\nAs noted by X user Kristen Maldonado and confirmed by Variety, the digital, updated version of the movie has edited the controversial line to simply: “Hot girls, we are going back red.”\n\nMean Girls, with the edited joke, is now available on Prime Video, Vudu, and Apple TV+. The movie is also expected to be available to stream later this year on Paramount+."
