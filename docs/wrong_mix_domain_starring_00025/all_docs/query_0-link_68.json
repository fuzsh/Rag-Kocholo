I remember this day oddly like very vividly.\n\nThere was so much going on. Seth is so good at improv.\n\nHe's like, Seth to this day, is one of my favorite actors\n\nof all time.\n\nIn this scene in particular,\n\nI remember really not having a De Niro impression,\n\nlike a very good one at all.\n\nAnd just kind of knowing I was gonna be winging it\n\nand hopefully betting on the fact,\n\nthe worse it was, the funnier it would be.\n\nAnd it worked out. [laughs]\n\nI was blown away though when all of a sudden out of nowhere\n\nDave Franco had completely nailed his De Niro impression.\n\nLike he just crushes that.\n\nAre you talking to me?\n\nYes. Yes.\n\nAre you talking to me?\n\nHe literally looks like him. He looks like De Niro.\n\nSo I'm here like upfront sucking at doing Taxi De Niro.\n\nAnd then he comes out and it's like says, [laughs]\n\nYeah, you, Focker. I'm talking to you.\n\nI was like, Did you practice this? It was so funny.\n\nI was like, What the fuck? Dave's killing this.\n\n[Mac] Who are you?\n\nOh, I'm Sam Jackson, you know, from Jackie Brown.\n\nWhat the fuck, Charles? [laughs]\n\nWhoo-ah! Whoo-ah!\n\n[Group] Whoo-ah!\n\nThat's Al Pacino.

[Zac laughing]\n\nThere's no consistency here.\n\nSeth and Rose doing what they do so well,\n\nwhich was just naturally reacting\n\nto this ridiculousness outside the window.\n\nThe whoo-ah, whoo-ah like that's not even De Niro,\n\nthat's Pacino.\n\nAnd I don't remember who did it first, but someone did it\n\nand we all just started copying it.\n\n[laughs] And Seth's reaction to it was very genuine.\n\nIt was like, That's not even,\n\nyou guys, that's not even an impression.\n\nAnd we just kept doing it to make him upset\n\n'cause it was making him mad and it stayed in.\n\nBut hat's one of the most fun movies I've ever filmed.\n\nSo grateful for that and that experience.\n\nMan, I feel like I'm back there. I haven't watched this.\n\nThis is great. I've never watch this stuff.\n\nThis is insane. It's cool.\n\nI know they're making it look like I do this,\n\nbut I don't do this.

[laughs]\n\nThis felt really cool.\n\nIt was a really special moment,\n\nand I'm still just proud of all those guys for doing that.\n\n'Cause it was hard. It was hard.\n\nLike you can't predict where basketball's going.\n\nA lot of people got hit in the face. It was hilarious, man.\n\nIt's so funny.\n\nI just see I look so light in my feet in that. Oh my gosh.\n\nOh wow. Oh, I love you, Kenny.\n\nI miss you guys. Man, that's bringing it all back.\n\nI haven't watched that in years.

Ah!\n\nJoey's so good in that scene. She's so great in that.\n\nYou know, I had seen her earlier work\n\nfrom when she was a little bit younger,\n\nand I noticed back then\n\nthat like she was just acting beyond, you know,\n\nanybody else I'd seen at her age.\n\nWe had so much fun working together as we kind of got back\n\nto that place where we were in that De Niro scene.\n\nLike that was the kind of the shape of the scene\n\nthat we had planned, but a lot of that stuff we added\n\nour own like flavor too, which was really fun.\n\nCelebrity? She didn't sleep with a celebrity.\n\nThat's derogatory.\n\nOkay, I'm a movie star. She slept with a movie star.\n\nOh God. [laughs] I don't remember saying that that way.\n\nI wanted there to be a clear delineation\n\nbetween Chris Cole and like myself.\n\nAs much as I can relate in ways to things\n\nthat Chris might be going through, I think the way\n\nthat he handles it is very different from myself.\n\nI got to play like the worst version\n\nof somebody experiencing fame and sort of the fear\n\nand the imposter syndrome that comes with that.\n\nOn the one hand, I'm still like starstruck\n\nevery time I see her.\n\nSo that's, and it's never,\n\nI don't think that's ever gonna change.\n\nIt's weird. I even to this day.\n\nI really just am in a sense just always gonna be\n\nin permanent awe of her.\n\nI don't know, I've got a deep trust\n\nand like respect for her that I think just makes it fun.\n\nLike I look forward to scenes with her,\n\nand there's very little stress.\n\nI just gotta get past that initial,\n\nYou're Nicole Kidman and we're doing a scene together.\n\nOkay, cool.

I mean, Zen's the best.\n\nShe's just, she's great. She's down for anything.\n\nShe's super brave. I've got so much respect for Zen.\n\nI hope we get to do something again in the future.\n\nShe's the best. I'll never forget it.\n\nIt's really nice to watch this stuff with you guys.\n\nIt's weird. I'm like getting emotional over this.\n\nIt's crazy.\n\n[VCR clicks] ['80s retro music]\n\n[rewind zinging] [VCR clicks]\n\n[Kevin exhales]\n\nYou okay, Dad?\n\nLee, I'm sorry.\n\nI'm sorry, boys.\n\n[sniffles] You shouldn't see me like this.\n\nA man doesn't cry.\n\nSean Durkin, the director of this movie,\n\nhad a very carefully drawn out plan\n\nfor the execution of this film and, of course,\n\non purpose put this scene probably very much last stop\n\nin the film, and I think it was for good reason.\n\nKevin von Erich was never meant to be seen crying,\n\nlike 'cause the family was not allowed to show weakness.\n\nAnd I thought that was a really fantastic note\n\nfrom Sean and a brilliant kind of thing\n\nto guide me through the movie.\n\nAnd there were a lot of scenes, I think,\n\nearlier in the film that warranted tears.\n\nI wanted to cry a lot during this movie,\n\nand he was just saying, No, hold it back,\n\nhold it back for the right moment.\n\nBut then this day came along,\n\nit was the last day of filming,\n\nand I couldn't hold back tears.\n\nAnd all I'm thinking here is, Don't cry, dude.\n\nYou're gonna have to do it again.\n\nLike Sean's not gonna go for this.\n\n[laughs] And when they said, you know,\n\nWe'll be your brothers, I just lost it.\n\nWe'll be your brothers, Dad.\n\nYeah Dad, we'll be your brothers.\n\nI thought I'd ruin the take at that point,\n\nbut I decided to stay in it.\n\nAnd when we finished, the boys kind of ran away\n\nand we continued the take.\n\nAnd I looked up at Sean. I was about to apologize.\n\nHe's like, No, that was it. I was like, Really?.\n\nSo this was the first time I think\n\nthat he wanted Kevin to experience this emotion.\n\nSo I was happy that Sean was happy. It's a cool scene.\n\n[VCR clicks] ['80s retro music]\n\n[rewind zinging] [VCR clicks]\n\nWell, thank you so much, Vanity Fair.\n\nThank you for watching."
