        "text": "I love movies with Zac Efron but I get jealous\n\nof the girls that he gets to date\n\nbecause I wanna be the girl.\n\nHi, I'm Maddie Ziegler and today,\n\nI'm here with Teen Vogue and I'm gonna tell you\n\nsome random facts about myself that you might not know.\n\nMy full name is Madison Nicole Ziegler.\n\nNickname, when I was little, I was called Maddie Moo Moo.\n\nNow, Tonya, my makeup artist, calls me Maddie girl.\n\nMy sign is a Libra.\n\nMy birthday is September 30th, 2002.\n\nI know, I'm young okay.\n\nMy biggest pet peeve is when the fork\n\nhits the plate and it just scrapes.\n\nUgh, it's hurting my ears right now.\n\nMy weirdest quirk, oh, I do some weird accents.\n\nHey y'all, my name's Petunia and I love corn\n\nand I live on a ranch with my pigs and cows.\n\nMy favorite food would probably be strawberries\n\nor ice cream or sushi and cereal, sorry.\n\nMy favorite thing to order at Starbucks\n\nwould be a Venti Very Berry Hibiscus.\n\nA strange food pet peeve for me would be,\n\nlike when they place their food and it mixes together,\n\nlike, don't put your corn and mashed potatoes and mix them.\n\nThat's so gross for me, I don't know why.\n\nI never dyed my hair but when I was about six years old,\n\nmy aunt is a hairdresser and she put\n\na temporary highlight in my hair.\n\nMy favorite way to wear my hair would\n\neither be, down or in a top knot.\n\nWhen I was little, I went through like a very sassy phase.\n\nEveryone would call me Mad Dog,\n\nbecause I would say I always get sassy.\n\nI didn't like when people would make fun of me\n\nor laugh at me, so I would just get really sassy.\n\nI'm out of that now, at least, I hope I am.\n\nThe first thing I notice about somebody when I meet them\n\nwould be their personality and I always look at their eyes\n\nfor some reason, I don't know why.\n\nMy dog is the cutest thing. Her name is Malibu\n\nand she's a Maltipoo and she's four pounds\n\nand she's so little and cute and I love her so much.\n\nMy favorite song would probably\n\nbe anything Harry Styles right now.\n\nI'm kind of obsessed with him and I\n\nthink he's very, very good looking.\n\nMy favorite flower would probably be a daisy.\n\nI think they're really, really cute.\n\nMy favorite smell, this is really weird.\n\nIt's the post office, I don't know why.\n\nI love the smell of mail.\n\nI also love the smell of my garage,\n\nI don't know why, it smells so good.\n\nI literally can fall asleep anywhere.\n\nThe other day we were on set. I fell asleep on set\n\nin my bedroom and I fell asleep while they were filming.\n\nLike I literally can sleep anywhere,\n\nI can sleep on the floor at the airport.\n\nIt takes me about five to seven minutes\n\nto get ready in the morning.\n\nI don't brush my hair because it's so long\n\nand thick that I can barely brush it so,\n\nI just wake up, change my clothes,\n\nbrush my teeth and I'm out the door.\n\nMy favorite color is purple, like a lavender,\n\nI think it's beautiful.\n\nI have a bunch of favorite actors and actresses\n\nbut, I think Kate Hudson is amazing\n\nand she's one of my biggest inspirations.\n\nMy favorite TV show is Gossip Girl.\n\nLove you Chuck Bass.\n\nMy favorite movie,\n\noh, that's a hard one.\n\nI really like Get Out, it's a good movie,\n\nvery scary, but it's good.\n\nMy favorite like three movies to watch,\n\nwould be like a drama, a rom-com and a horror movie.\n\nI'm obsessed with Conjuring.\n\nMy favorite Disney princess would be,\n\nAriel, from Little Mermaid, love that movie.\n\nWhat I want young people to know is,\n\nchase your dreams if you have them\n\nand if you're passionate about something,\n\nthen just go for it.\n\nAnd there you have it, now you know more about me.\n\nBye guys."
