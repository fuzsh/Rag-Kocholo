Rachel McAdams, who played iconic head Plastic Regina George, said she would also be interested in revisiting the role during an interview this weekend. McAdams was speaking on the Heroes of Health: COVID-19 Stream-a-thon.\n\nShe said, according to Entertainment Weekly, that \"it would be fun to play Regina George later in her life and see where life took her!\" There have been discussions but “in joking…not quite seriously,” she said.\n\nShe admitted that she didn't anticipate Mean Girls or The Notebook having a long-lasting effect on people 15 years later. “Let’s hope Mean Girls has helped girls to be nicer to each other, not the other way around,\" she quipped when asked whether she thought the movies would be as culturally defining as they were. \"Yeah, it’s really bizarre. I feel really lucky to have been a part of something that’s stuck around—even a little bit. That was never anything I imagined happening in life. So yeah, it’s strange and surreal still.”"
