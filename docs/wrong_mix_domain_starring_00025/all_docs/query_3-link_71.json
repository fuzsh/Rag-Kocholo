        "text": "Credit: Getty Images (3)\n\nEverything the 'Mean Girls' Cast Has Said About a Sequel to the 2004 Movie\n\nThe beloved 2004 teen comedy Mean Girls has had a direct-to-DVD movie sequel, been adapted into a Broadway musical and now, has a new movie based on said musical — but fans are still waiting on a sequel with the OG cast. Lindsay Lohan, who starred as innocent-homeschooler-turned-Plastic Cady Heron in the original film, reunited with Tina Fey at the January 2024 premiere of the new Mean Girls. Fey wrote the screenplays for both films and is one of two stars who reprised her role in the 2024 adaptation. Apart from Fey and Tim Meadows — who played Ms. Norbury and Principal Duvall, respectively — the musical movie features all-new faces including Reneé Rapp as Regina George (originally portrayed by Rachel McAdams) and Angourie Rice as Cady. While a new Mean Girls era has been ushered in, there’s still talk of rebooting the original.

I wanted to come back with a Mean Girls 2 with the same cast, work with Tina and the whole crew again, and [director] Mark Waters. That was really what I wanted; I was excited to do that. But that’s all in their hands, really.”\n\nCredit: Dia Dipasupil/WireImage\n\nRachel McAdams (Regina George)\n\nDuring an April 2020 appearance on the Heroes of Health: COVID-19 livestream, McAdams said she would like to revisit her role as Queen of the Plastics.\n\n“It would be fun to play Regina George later in her life and see where life took her!” she said while answering questions, per Yahoo Entertainment.\n\nCredit: Kevin Mazur/Getty Images\n\nAmanda Seyfried (Karen Smith)\n\nSeyfried expressed doubt about the likelihood of a sequel during a conversation with Lohan for Interview magazine in November 2022.\n\n\"I would kill just to do one week, all of us playing our own roles on Mean Girls on Broadway,\" Seyfried said of the Broadway adaptation. \"Because a Mean Girls 2 is never going to happen, is it?\"\n\nCredit: Rodin Eckenroth/Getty Images for Caruso\n\nLacey Chabert (Gretchen Wieners)\n\nChabert teamed up with Lohan and Seyfried for a Mean Girls-themed Walmart Black Friday ad in November 2023. She subsequently told TODAY.com that the experience was “like stepping back in time” and said she would “of course be open” to a sequel.\n\nMcAdams was the only member of the Plastics who didn’t participate in the commercial. In December 2023, she told Variety why she’d skipped the gig.\n\n“I guess I wasn’t that excited about doing a commercial if I’m being totally honest,” she said. “I’ve never done commercials, and it just didn’t feel like my bag.”\n\nMcAdams added that she hadn’t been aware so many of her former costars were involved.\n\n“I didn’t know that everyone was doing it. I would, of course, always love to be part of a Mean Girls reunion and hang with my Plastics, but yeah, I found that out later,” she said.\n\nCredit: Phillip Faraone/Getty Images\n\nLizzy Caplan (Janis Ian)\n\n“Of course I would want to be a part of [a Mean Girls sequel], I would be an idiot not to join,” Caplan told Grazia magazine in November 2022. “But to me it feels like Mean Girls had a really good beginning, middle and end. I don’t know what’s left of the story.”\n\nThe Fatal Attraction star added that she was glad to see Lohan return to acting in Netflix’s Falling for Christmas after several years offscreen.\n\n\"I am so on board with this return of Lindsay Lohan,\" Caplan said. \"I'm just pumped. She was such an incredible talent when she was working as a kid and a young adult so I'm happy to see that she's coming back.\"\n\nCredit: John Nacion/Getty Images for Paramount Pictures\n\nTina Fey (Ms. Norbury and Writer)\n\nFey opened up about some changes she made while producing the musical adaptation, including calling the character Dawn Schweitzer a “horny shrimp” rather than a “fat virgin” in the film’s infamous “Burn Book.”\n\n“[Regina’s] going to find a way to inflict pain on people, but she’s not going to get herself in trouble,” Fey explained to The New York Times in January 2024, adding that “some of that” needed to “go faster” in order to make room for songs.\n\nFey continued that they learned “so much with the [stage] show,” including that there doesn’t need to be “rigidity” in the casting of the roles.\n\n“This story works in many interesting permutations,” she explained. “Anyone with charisma is a good Regina. Anyone who looks like they might come apart can be a great Gretchen.”\n\nAs for whether there might be a sequel that brings back the original cast to play their characters as adults, Fey said she has “not really thought much about that.”\n\n“To me, part of why the stakes are so high in the story is because everyone’s so young and feelings are huge, love is huge and friendship is huge in a way [that it isn’t with] middle-age moms,” she said. “I love writing about middle-aged people, but I don’t know.”"
