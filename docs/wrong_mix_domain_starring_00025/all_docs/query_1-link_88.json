        "text": "Mean Girls: Official trailer\n\nBlockbuster hit Mean Girls will be celebrating its 20th anniversary next year with Paramount revealing the full cast for the new movie musical set to be hitting screens in January with a new slate of fresh-faced plastics.\n\nThe new movie will be based on the hit Broadway musical Mean Girls, which itself is based on the 2004 movie.\n\nWho will be in the new cast?\n\nAngourie Rice will be replacing Lindsay Lohan as Cady Heron. The rising Australian star has a number of hit movies under her belt already including Netflix’s Senior Year as well as Tom Holland’s Spider-Man trilogy.\n\nRenee Rapp is reprising her role as Regina George as she was the first actress to bring Rachel McAdam’s infamous antagonist to the Broadway stage.\n\nDon't miss... Inside the lives of the cast of Mean Girls on the movie's special day [LATEST]\n\nIn a surprising twist, Disney Princess Auli’i Cravalho will be taking on the iconic role of schoolyard goth Janis Ian. The actress got her start in Hollywood as the voice of Moana in the 2016 animation.\n\nTony-nominated Broadway breakout actor Jaquel Spivey takes Daniel Franzese’s role as Damien while NBC star Bebe Wood joins the cast as Gretchen Wieners.\n\nAngourie’s Senior Year costar Avantika will be taking over Amanda Seyfried’s iconic role as the airheaded Karen Smith while Mean Girls veterans Lorne Michaels and Tina Fey will be returning to project behind the scenes.\n\nThe cast announcement came as part of Mean Girls’ Day celebrations yesterday, with October 3rd being a sentimental day for the movies’ worldwide fanbase.\n\nDon't miss...\n\nLindsay Lohan updates fans on her postpartum journey as she quotes Mean Girls [UPDATE]\n\nLindsay Lohan gives birth to first baby in Dubai - and shares adorable name [LATEST]\n\nDave season 3 sparks frenzy as Brad Pitt makes appearance in finale [INSIGHT]\n\nThe network also marked the special day by releasing the full 2004 movie for free on TikTok for just one day, splitting the film into 23 clips to fit with the social media platform’s time restrictions.\n\nWhile the well-intentioned celebration was watched by millions, many slammed the network saying they failed to consider that the WGA strike had only just ended.\n\nMembers of WGA had been striking since May, bringing much of Hollywood to a standstill, for a number of reasons but most poignantly over poor pay, particularly from streamers.\n\nOn X, a number of industry professionals slammed the network, as a few writers claimed they were simply trying to find “another way not to pay us for our work”.\n\nDirector’ Chad Garrett questioned: “Paramount, what’s your intended strategy when releasing an ENTIRE FILM on THE DAY that SAG and the AMPTP resume talks to end the strike? Seems like self-sabotage. Do you not want to return to work?”\n\nThe movie was only available on TikTok for October third and has since been taken down."
