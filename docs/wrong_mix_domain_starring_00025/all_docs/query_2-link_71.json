        "text": "2024 marks 20 years since the release of Mean Girls.\n\nThe film has become a cult classic, transcending time as it's been passed down from generation to generation by only the 'coolest' of mums.\n\nIn its two decades of trying to make 'fetch' happen, the Mean Girls universe has given us so much. Merch is still made to this day, the film scored a Broadway adaptation in 2017 and every year on October 3, loyal fans still celebrate Mean Girls Day.\n\nThe latest addition to the canon is a musical film adaption of the Broadway show, starring Aussie actress Angourie Rice in the leading role.\n\nREAD MORE: Megan Rapinoe and Sue Bird address wedding speculation\n\nREAD MORE: Heavily-discounted smartwatches you'll actually want to buy\n\nAt 22, Rice has a résumé well beyond her years, featuring some of Hollywood's biggest modern titles, from The Nice Guys with fellow Aussie Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling, to Tom Holland's Spiderman series and Mare of Easttown with Kate Winslet.\n\nAlthough she's spent years perfecting the American accent, Rice told 9honey Celebrity having to learn to sing in it was a whole different ball game.\n\n\"The problem was I sounded too American when I sang, and they were telling me to soften the Rs and sort of… not hit it so much,\" she said.\n\n\"I was worried, because when I sing, normally I sing in my own accent. I was overcompensating, so that was a funny thing to sort of do in the sound studio.\"\n\nREAD MORE: Fruity, floral, subtle: These are the best fragrances for all noses\n\nREAD MORE: Andre Braugher's cause of death confirmed by publicist\n\nRice stars as Cady Heron, a role originally played by Lindsay Lohan in the 2004 film.\n\nHowever, the actress isn't worried about following in Lohan's footsteps, saying she's confident the film will find its own space.\n\n\"I just really trusted that the character would be different, because I knew that I would bring something different to it,\" Rice said.\n\n\"You can get two actors to read the same scene and they'll do it completely differently just because they're different people.\"\n\nREAD MORE: Tiny detail on energy bill that could save huge cash\n\nREAD MORE: Country music star issues public apology for suing fan\n\nThe new movie sees Tina Fey reprise her role as teacher Ms Norbury, while also stepping in as writer and producer.\n\nAlthough Rice has rubbed shoulders with some of Hollywood's biggest stars, she said meeting Fey had her \"pretty starstruck\".\n\n\"I was just so amazed to just be in the room and to watch her work, to see her come up with different jokes for us to say,\" she said.\n\nFor a daily dose of 9Honey, subscribe to our newsletter here\n\nMean Girls cast: Then and now\n\n\"Something I really admire about her is that she has taken the time to think about every single moment in the script, so any question I had, she had an answer.\n\n\"And it's her world, it's her characters, it's her story, it all began with her. So I felt very fortunate just to be in the room to watch her work.\"\n\nThe movie is set to hit Australian cinemas on January 11, with filming having wrapped up earlier this year in New Jersey.\n\nWhile Rice is used to travelling between the US and Australia for work, like a true Aussie she admits nothing beats a coffee on home soil.\n\nREAD MORE: Sentimental reason Prince William was 'honoured' to attend ceremony\n\nREAD MORE: The biggest and best deals perfect for Christmas gifts\n\n\"I miss the cafés [when travelling],\" she says.\n\n\"Like, that's something I really miss about Melbourne, the café culture I find is just impeccable.\n\n\"There are lots of good cafés overseas as well, but I just have a particular attachment to the ones that I go to in Melbourne. So that's what I miss, definitely. It's hard to beat Melbourne cafés.\""
