124. www.scaruffi.com 124 The Peacetime Dividend • The culture of risk is a whole infrastructure designed to promote, assist and reward risk-takers in new technologies (laboratories, plants, offices, corporate lawyers, marketing agencies, venture capitalists, universities, immigrants) • The main change: need to generate a profit as quickly as possible (the great investor of the 1950s and 1960s, the military, thought long-term, with no interest in return on investment) • The venture-capital firms create a ghost industry (focused on making money) that evolves in parallel to the technological one

125. www.scaruffi.com 125 The Peacetime Dividend • The short-term approach helps communicate effectively with the market. • The Silicon Valley start-up is both "visionary" AND grounded in the reality of technological feasibility and of market readiness • The Darwinian system of small start-ups as a whole is more likely to find a solution to a problem than a large bureaucratic company • Progress is incremental, but rapid

156. www.scaruffi.com 156 Conclusions • Silicon Valley is the symbol and catalyst for the revolution that turned electronic computing from a math appliance into pervasive worldwide communication • Almost none of the enabling technologies was invented by Silicon Valley • SV excels at incubating businesses, not at inventing technology • SV excels in disruptive technologies (that change the world) • A platform for perennial innovation

157. www.scaruffi.com 157 Conclusions • Silicon Valley did not exist in a vacuum: sociopolitical and artistic/cultural background • Alternative lifestyle, anti-establishment spirit, utopian counterculture: "question authority", "think different" and "change the world" • SV is largely the product of a youth culture (just like rock music and videogames) • SV hates the big government, big labor and big corporations • SV loves the eccentric individualist and the "do it yourself" philosophy

158. www.scaruffi.com 158 Conclusions • The Bay Area was uniquely equipped with the mindset to subvert rules and embrace novelty • But it would not have happened without big government: – government was the largest venture capitalist of Silicon Valley – government was also the most influential strategist of Silicon Valley – government invested in high-risk long-term projects while venture capitalists tended to follow short-term trends
