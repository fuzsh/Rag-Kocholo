        "text": "The Unified Modeling Language (UML) has generated considerable enthusiasm within the object-oriented software development industry. Based on the object-oriented analysis and design (OOAD) work of three of the world's most well-known methodologists -- Grady Booch, Ivar Jacobson and Jim Rumbaugh -- the UML is a combination of notation, semantics/syntax and a meta-model for a modeling language. The UML is, however, only a piece of the overall puzzle for activities in the OOAD world.\n\nMore and more interest has recently been raised in the area of OOAD for several reasons, including: the UML and the visibility of the methodologists involved; an OOAD standardization/convergence effort through the Object Management Group (OMG), Framingham, Mass.; an increased interest in business object modeling; and advancements in OO Computer Aided Software Engineering (CASE) tool support. In this update on the state of OOAD, we will review the recent history of OOAD, in particular the rise and dominance of Rational Software Corp., Santa Clara, Calif.; today's industry efforts; the future of OOAD as it looks at this time, especially in conjunction with other efforts like Shlaer-Mellor -- a methodology apparently less interested in converging with others; and parallel development trends in the OOAD software development arena such as the rise of business objects and OO CASE.\n\nRational convergence efforts\n\nThe OOAD community has seen many changes in the last two years. From a methodological perspective, one company has received tremendous visibility during these years for its move to bring together those many consider to be the leading methodologists in the industry. Just two years ago, Rational Software had a single chief scientist, Grady Booch. During the 10 or so years that Booch had then been with Rational, he had helped introduce object technology to the masses through a number of publications and a presentation style that made it both fun and educational to look at object technology.\n\nIn what many considered a bold move, Rational then hired Jim Rumbaugh. Rumbaugh, along with others, created and helped popularize the Object Modeling Technique (OMT), the most used and supported methodology around. Although Booch and Rumbaugh had collaborated and influenced each other's work, Rational's hiring Rumbaugh nonetheless stunned the OOAD community. Interestingly, even after Rumbaugh joined the company, he continued to write articles showing suggested extensions to OMT, which many then referred to informally as the \"Rumbaugh\" technique. Many wondered how Booch and Rumbaugh would work together and what direction the industry would take. Most assumed that a convergence of their work would take place.\n\nA few months later, at a prominent object technology conference, Booch and Rumbaugh announced that they were working on a Unified Method that would be the evolutionary next step in methodologies and would most certainly be the \"upgrade path\" for users of both the Booch and Rumbaugh (or OMT) techniques. They invited other methodologists to participate in defining the Unified Method, which was to be a graphical notation and a process to help users practice proper software engineering techniques. Using a Rational supported mailing list, they created the Object Technology Users Group (OTUG) to track comments and requests, share ideas and get feedback from the industry on the Unified Method. They pledged that the Unified Method would be open to public scrutiny and used to converge an industry that appeared deep in religious fervor over methodologies.\n\nRational soon made another bold move -- they purchased Ivar Jacobson's Objectory -- which combined Booch, Rumbaugh and Jacobson all under one organizational roof. Once again, the industry wondered how the group would work together given the individual visibility each had within the OOAD community. Jokingly, the group came to be called the \"three amigos.\" Rational now commanded an even greater visibility in the convergence of the OOAD methodologies effort.\n\nThe next OOAD convergence move by Rational, expected by the end of the third quarter of 1997, will be through three separate books, one from each of the three amigos. Booch, in the OTUG forum noted, \"Jim, Ivar and I are working on three books: a reference manual, a user guide and a process book for the UML.\"\n\nOMG convergence efforts\n\nAround the same time that the OTUG was formed, activity began within the Object Management Group to determine whether a convergence of the OOAD industry was possible. A special interest group, called the OOAD SIG, was formed at an OMG sponsored meeting in San Jose, Calif., after many of the leading methodologists and tool and training vendors began to discuss what could be done to converge the industry. That first meeting showed the industry that not only were Booch and Rumbaugh interested in convergence, but also that the vast majority involved in methodologies saw benefit in formally working together. The group quickly elected Mary Loomis, Hewlett-Packard's Software Technical Labs director, as chairperson and James Odell, a consultant and educator, as well as co-author of the Martin-Odell methodology, as co-chair. By the end of the morning, the group was formally in place with an initial charter and on its way to determining what level of convergence they could attain.\n\nDuring the OMG meeting, it was pointed out that some OOAD tool vendors had already tried to work together, specifically through a Common Data Interchange Format (CDIF), which had been suggested as an EIA (Electronic Industries Association) standard several years prior. The CDIF standard was to allow vendors to share information contained in their repositories with other tools, both to supplement the capabilities of any given tool in a more easily integrated format and to give users the ability to use different modeling tools if they so desired. Although not universally accepted, CDIF was in fact supported by certain tool vendors, and some suggested that reinventing the wheel in this area would be counter productive. Said Rational's Director of Object Technology, Jon Hopkins, \"The OMG originally thought that a standard OOAD meta-model would be a good thing to standardize. That evolved into the need for a standard meta-object facility (in other words, a meta-meta model), a standard interchange format and a standard OOAD object model.\" (See Fig. 1 .)\n\nThe other question was whether or not to attempt to create a single methodology as the OMG standard. Such a move would have put tool vendors and training organizations in the position where their features and services would be the main added value offered to clients, rather than their support for any one specific methodology. This goal was considered to be too challenging initially. Instead, the group took on the goal of driving a common meta-model for any methodology. A meta-model would allow the underlying definition of object technology concepts to be fundamentally the same, regardless of which specific notation was chosen, and would then still support a convergence in the industry while allowing the notation and process elements of a methodology to be considered later.\n\nThe task at hand"
