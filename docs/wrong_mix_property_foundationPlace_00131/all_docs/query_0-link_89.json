He went on <strong>to</strong> Columbia University, where he received a Master’s Degree (1968) and PhD (1971) in International Affairs.

Under the <strong>Sun</strong> Campus <strong>Incuba<strong>to</strong>r</strong> program, qualifying students will be provided a technical infrastructure <strong>to</strong> develop their e-business ideas with access <strong>to</strong> complete development environments that can be accessed through <strong>Sun</strong>Ray Enterprise Appliances, thin-client, front-end devices located on campus. To initiate the process, students must prepare compelling e-business plans and submit them for consideration <strong>to</strong> <strong>Sun</strong> Microsystems. <strong>Sun</strong> will highlight a select few business plans from every eligible university that has enrolled in the program. Based upon recommendations from faculty and venture capitalists, <strong>Sun</strong> will select the business plans that will receive six months <strong>of</strong> free access <strong>to</strong> the incubation facility. During this time, these start-up companies will develop their pro<strong>to</strong>type or pro<strong>of</strong> <strong>of</strong> concept for their business plan before seeking inves<strong>to</strong>rs for their company. <strong>Business</strong> school students have a unique opportunity <strong>to</strong> turn their ideas in<strong>to</strong> successful businesses faster than ever at a minimal cost <strong>to</strong> themselves. They also have access <strong>to</strong> <strong>Sun</strong>’s leading technology, as well as introductions <strong>to</strong> venture capital firms that could potentially fund these businesses. <strong>College</strong> <strong>of</strong> <strong>Business</strong> faculty and staff will provide support and guidance in business plan development.
