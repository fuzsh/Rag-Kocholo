        "text": "The organizers would like to thank Maria Zemankova, Directorate for Computer & Information Science & Engineering (CISE) at the National Science Foundation for inspiring and supporting this workshop series and report. Furthermore, we owe thanks to all workshop participants. Many of them revealed their most innovative research and development projects and demonstrated systems under development to their competitors in an attempt to identify the most promising synergies.\n\nESA&#39;s Advanced Concepts Team considers biomimetics as a means of finding new and realistic technologies for application in future space missions. Biomimetics could provide optimal solutions in spacecraft and payload design through genetic resources leading to the evolution of organisms compliant with the prevailing environment. A more systematic adoption of biomimetics in space systems design could involve a new approach that treats a functional unit in a concurrent and a multidisciplinary way. Biomimetics also has potential applications in the use of biomimetic automation and data-fusion algorithms in Earth-observation systems, and biomimetic-based environmental control and life-support subsystems.\n\nThis special issue of the Schedae Informaticae journal contains selected papers presented during IV National Conference Computer Methods and Systems in Scientific Research and Engineering Design, which took place at the AGH University of Science and Technology in Krakow in November 2003. Selected papers you can read at this special issue cover the wide area of most interesting problems on applied computer science. Papers describes the new security policies and modular architectures which must be developed and implemented when computers come to business, computer modelling of the blood flow, modern artificial intelligence and much more."
