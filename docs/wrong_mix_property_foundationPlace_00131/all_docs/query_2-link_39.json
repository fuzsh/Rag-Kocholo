Abrams, Paul Berg, James B. D. Mark, Stanley L. Schrier, and Philip Sunshine--discussed the Medical School's move from San Francisco to the Stanford campus in 1959 and its implications. They described the new format for medical education envisioned by the university president and the Board of Trustees, the impact of the integration of the teaching and clinical operations on the Stanford campus, and how Stanford gained a reputation for innovative, high-quality medical care.\n\nThe panelists discussed the forces behind this move: the Flexner Report on medical education in the United States and Canada and the university's assessment of its program's condition after World War II. They also talked about the challenges the Medical School faced as a result of the move, including the creation of an adequate patient base to ensure the success of the medical school and hospital (which occasioned hostility from local physicians, hospitals and clinics) and the need to recruit faculty, physicians, and researchers.\n\nIn the course of the discussion, the panelists also addressed differences among their departments regarding the sharing of research resources.\n\nPreferred Citation\n\nThe Stanford School of Medicine's Move from San Francisco to the Stanford Campus: Rationale, Controversies, and Impacts.

Stanford Arts Initiative Project Series 9 2012\n\nLanguage of Material: English.\n\nPlanting, John 2012 Oct 19 - 2013 May 3\n\nPlanting, John\n\nScope and Contents\n\nIn his first interview, John Planting discusses his arrival at Stanford as a student in 1948, his role as an assistant in the newly established music department, and his subsequent responsibilities as the department administrator in 1957 - 1996. He addresses the changes in the music department during his years at Stanford through his retirement from the department. He talks about how he provided administrative and logistical support for numerous performances over the years, often moving equipment and instruments himself from storage areas to concert locations.\n\nPlanting reminisces about music department directors, professors, teachers, conductors, and concert performers, including Jan Popper, Leonard Ratner, Sandor Salgo, Loran Crosten, Albert Cohen and Wolfgang Kuhn. He also shares memories of places such as Dinkelspiel Auditorium, Braun Music Center, Cubberley Auditorium, The Knoll, and Memorial Auditorium. Planting talks about the relationships between the music department and other parts of the university, such as the School of Education and the School of Humanities and Sciences. He describes the development of the degree programs such as the D.M.A. (Doctor of Musical Arts). Other topics covered include visiting artists, Friends of Music, Committee on Public Exercises, Stanford Lively Arts and ASSU (Associated Students of Stanford University). He also talks about turning points in the history of the department: the establishment of the music department, having their own building (Dinkelspiel), and the effects of the BAP (Budget Adjustment Program) in the 1980s. Throughout, he discusses the issues between musicology (theory) and performance (conservatory) and how his expertise was utilized in the planning of both Dinkelspiel Auditorium and Braun Music Center.\n\nJohn Planting's second interview follows up on several topics discussed in the first interview. He describes the contributions of Wolfgang Kuhn in two areas: degree programs (M.A. plus Teaching Credential; D.M.A. plus Ed.D.) and community outreach (contacts with schools and the Summer Youth Orchestra). He continues with several other topics, including Woodpecker Lodge, Dinkelspiel Auditorium, Music Educators National Conference (significance to Stanford), and the Stanford jazz program.\n\nStanford Pioneering Women I: A Conversation with Women Hired Between 1958 and 1975 2014-08-22\n\nStanford Pioneering Women I: A Conversation with Women Hired Between 1958 and 1975\n\nScope and Contents\n\nThe panelists describe how they came to work at Stanford, and the different family situations they each found themselves in when they began their careers. They discuss the lifetime of hard work and dedication necessary to be a woman paving the way for female representation in the academia. They shed light on the different atmospheres they experienced starting out in their respective fields, including prejudice against and indifference towards them as young women. The panelists go into great detail about the influence and importance of the rise of feminism to not only their own careers, but to the university and the academia in general. They discuss the evolution of issues such as tokenism, affirmative action, the sexual harassment \"troubles\" of the 1970s, and the interplay between the anti-war and civil rights movements and the feminist movement. The panelists look back to certain points in their careers where they feel being a woman gave them undue influence or promotion, and discuss the implications of this on the advancement of the feminist cause.\n\nThroughout, the panelists share richly drawn anecdotes and humorous personal stories that have stuck with them over the years, such as Herzenberg's incredible account of dinners with scientists Erwin Schrodinger and Albert Einstein, and the overwhelmingly positive feminist reaction, and the subsequent reversal of it, to Maccoby's The Psychology of Sex Differences. They reflect on what they have learnt and what they hope they have enabled the women they taught and the young girls of the future to achieve, adding jokingly that taking computer science or becoming an engineer is the best advice they can give. They discuss passionately the direction in which gender equality is moving across the board, from the technology and science industries, to English and psychology faculties in the academia.\n\nSubjects and Indexing Terms\n\nHerzenberg, Leonore A.\n\nLewenstein, Marion\n\nMaccoby, Eleanor E.\n\nPacker, Nancy Huddleston\n\nStanford Pioneering Women Tier II: Women Faculty Hired at Stanford in the Late 1960s and Early 1970s 2016-11-01\n\nStanford Pioneering Women Tier II: Women Faculty Hired at Stanford in the Late 1960s and Early 1970s\n\nBiographical / Historical\n\nModerator\n\nMyra H. Strober is Professor, Emerita in Stanford University's Graduate School of Education and Professor of Economics, Emerita (by courtesy) in the Graduate School of Business. One of the founders of the field of feminist economics, her research focuses on gender issues in the workplace, work and family, and higher education. Hired at Stanford in 1972, Strober was the first woman faculty member in the Graduate School of Business. She moved to the School of Education faculty in 1978. The founding director of Stanford's Center for Research on Women, she was also the first chair of the National Council for Research on Women. She has served as president of the International Association for Feminist Economics and vice president of the NOW Legal Defense and Education Fund. Strober is the author of numerous articles on occupational segregation, women in the professions and management, the economics of childcare, feminist economics, and the teaching of economics. She holds a BS degree in industrial and labor relations from Cornell University, an MA in economics from Tufts University, and a PhD in economics from MIT.\n\nPanelists\n\nSarah S. Donaldson is a leader in the field of radiation oncology. Since 1973 she has been on the faculty of the Radiation Oncology Department in Stanford's School of Medicine, where she founded the pediatric radiation oncology program. She is the associate director of the Residency Program and director of the Mentoring Program for the department, and serves as chief of Radiation Oncology Service at the Lucile Packard Children's Hospital. The author of more than 200 scientific publications, Donaldson was the first female president of the American Board of Radiology and the American Society of Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology, and the first female radiation oncologist to serve as president of the Radiological Society of North America. Her numerous awards include election to the National Academy of Medicine, fellowship in the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and gold medals and honorary memberships from many national and international organizations. She earned undergraduate and nursing degrees from the University of Oregon, a BMS from Dartmouth Medical School, and an MD from Harvard Medical School.\n\nCarolyn Lougee was recruited to Stanford in 1973 as the first woman faculty member hired in Stanford's History Department since the 1890s. She is a European historian, with a particular focus on France, and a pioneer in the use of information technology and quantitative social history methods. She was the first woman granted tenure in the History Department and the first to be its chair. Lougee has held many senior academic leadership posts at Stanford, serving as chair of Stanford's Faculty Senate, senior associate dean of the School of Humanities and Sciences, and dean of Undergraduate Studies. In the 1980s she was a leader in revamping Stanford's entire undergraduate curricula, a change later emulated by many other universities. She was granted Stanford's highest award for distinguished service to undergraduate education and the University's top teaching awards. She is the author of numerous scholarly articles and highly acclaimed books. She holds a BA from Smith College and a PhD from the University of Michigan.\n\nHelen Quinn was appointed staff scientist at SLAC in 1977 after resigning from the Physics faculty at Harvard due to her husband's job relocation. A SLAC staff researcher for 26 years, she was promoted to SLAC Professor in 2003, after she had earned a major scientific award, had been elected to the National Academy of Sciences, and had been elected president of the American Physical Society. Her major contributions to particle physics include the PecceiQuinn symmetry theories on particle interactions and work on the physics of quarks and quark-hadron duality. She is an Honorary Officer of the Order of Australia and the recipient of the Compton Medal for Leadership in Physics of the American Institute of Physics (2016), the J.J. Sakurai Prize for Theoretical Particle Physics (2013), the Oscar Klein Medal from the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences (2008), and the Dirac Medal of the International Center for Theoretical Physics (2000). Quinn chaired a National Academy of Sciences committee that developed a new framework for teaching science in grades K-12. Standards based on it have been adopted in 18 states. Quinn, who is a native of Australia, holds BS and PhD degrees in Physics from Stanford.\n\nElizabeth Traugott is a historical linguist renowned for her theories on the mechanisms of language change. In the 1960s, she worked as an assistant professor at UC Berkeley before nepotism rules there, which prohibited husbands and wives from working in the same department, brought her to Stanford as a part-time lecturer. Traugott was appointed to the Stanford faculty in 1970 as an associate professor of English at a time when there were only seven tenured women faculty in the School of Humanities & Sciences. She later co-founded Stanford's Department of Linguistics and served as chair of that department for five years. In 1985, she became one of Stanford's highest-ranking female academic administrators when she was appointed Vice Provost and Dean of Graduate Studies, a position she held until 1991. Traugott has served as president of the Linguistic Society of America, the International Society for Historical Linguistics, and the International Society for the Linguistics of English. She has written 13 scholarly books and more than 110 articles. Born and raised in England, she earned a BA in English from Oxford and a PhD from the University of California Berkeley.\"\n\nScope and Contents\n\n\"In this oral history, five pioneering women who forged careers in the challenging years when women academics were a rarity reflect on the passage they made to senior faculty and administrative roles at Stanford University. Participants include Myra H. Strober (moderator), Graduate School of Education and Graduate School of Business; Sarah S. Donaldson, Radiation Oncology; Carolyn Lougee, History; Helen Quinn, SLAC; and Elizabeth Traugott, Linguistics and English.\n\nDescribing their early career choices and their paths to Stanford, the women often mention the role of mentors: sometimes parents who encouraged or discouraged their progress, but more often the male mentors who eased access to professional circles or counseled them as their careers took shape. The contribution of male mentors is a thread that continues throughout the discussion, but the women also acknowledge the negative influence of the \"old boys\" network. One woman was turned down for tenure because her trailblazing field was considered marginal, and another was not considered for faculty openings and remained a staff scientist for more than two decades, even as the significance of her research was widely honored.\n\nOther participants point out the help they received from the \"old girls\" network--faculty or administrator's wives with significant influence and secretarial staff who held a wealth of information about \"how things worked.\" In particular, Jing Lyman, wife of then Stanford President Richard W. Lyman, is remembered in personal and institutional contexts, especially her efforts to raise the funds needed to found and develop the Center for Research on Women.\n\nThe women compare and contrast the cultures of their different departments or schools, and they discuss their sometimes ambivalent relationships to the feminism of the 1960s and 1970s. They discuss the strategies of ignoring slights and developing a thick skin in comparison to the more direct approaches taken today. Exploring the impact of affirmative action, the women recall the daunting notion that it--and, implicitly, they--would erode quality, as well as their own fears that they were not good enough for the positions they held. As their careers moved into middle age, affirmative action also meant service, they recall, as every committee needed to have \"a woman\" on it. Some participants talk about the administrative roles they held.\n\nThe conflict between professional and family roles is noted as one of the challenges they faced in mid-career, especially meeting expectations in both areas. Some mention the lack of understanding of their professional role in the community and comment on the awkwardness they faced at university social gatherings, not \"belonging\" in the kitchen with the wives, and yet not entirely comfortable around the fireplace with colleagues. One describes a solution she implemented as president of a professional organization to alleviate professional women's social isolation: creating place cards for dinners that mixed the academics and partners at random.\n\nAs part of a discussion of the glass ceiling in academia, the women assert that continuing discrimination has become subtler and change will involve issues deeper than policy pronouncements. They express concern about the apparent rise in sexual assault on campus. The participants agree that they \"would do it all over again,\" but they wish they had known how hard pursuing an academic career would be from the start. Besides advice from a knowledgeable elder, they would have liked to approach their careers with more selfconfidence and a willingness to accept imperfection.\"\n\nSubjects and Indexing Terms\n\nDonaldson, Sarah S.\n\nLougee, Carolyn Chappell\n\nQuinn, Helen R.\n\nStrober, Myra H.\n\nTraugott, Elizabeth C.\n\nSeries 17.
