I’m on the run, but the Mermaid’s in charge and the button is below.\n\nIt’s Happy Birthday to Linda Ronstadt, a Mudcrutch Monday and the ‘Summer of Love’ Playlist on July 15, 2024\n\nGood morning, Ronstadt fans! Our musical muse is celebrating her 78th birthday today and so are we here in The Mermaid Lounge.

It’s time for another Mudcrutch Monday. It has been a while. Today we give you the entire ball of wax.

Just hit the button below.\n\nWe Start Off the Week With New Stone Poneys, Our ‘Seasons’ Playlist, and Live Hot Tuna, On Monday, August 7, 2023\n\nGood morning, workers! A brand new week is upon is and we’ve got a brand new Stone Poneys playlist to start off the day, but it doesn’t end there! Read on for details!\n\nHere’s your musical lineup:\n\n11:00 a.m. In the Spotlight: The Music of The Stone Poneys NEW!\n\nWhen Linda Ronstadt first left Tucson for LA to make music, she met Bobby Kimmel who proposed they start a band. Then came Kenny Edwards (who would become an integral part of her solo career band). Thus, The Stone Poneys were born. The rest, as they say, is musical history as Linda Ronstadt forged an amazing career that earned her the title ‘The Queen of Rock’ in a male-dominated world. These early days are often forgotten, but not here in The Mermaid Lounge as we give you a brand new Spotlight featuring her days as a Stone Poney.\n\n3:00 p.m. Seasons: Various Artists\n\nYes, we are about to change seasons once again, so we think this is a good time to play this one since we’ve not heard it since the last snowfall. You’ll hear Bobbie Gentry, Janis Ian, Simon & Garfunkel, The Lovin’ Spoonful, The Byrds, Hoyt Axton, Sly & The Family Stone, John Prine, The Rolling Stones, Blood, Sweat & Tears, The Band, Nina Simone, The Kinks, The Zombies, Electric Light Orchestra, Jefferson Airplane, James Taylor and more!\n\n7:00 p.m. Hot Tuna Live at The Fillmore, San Francisco, CA, March 4, 1988\n\nClosing out the programming on Monday is another Lounge favorite, Hot Tuna. This one is live from The Fillmore West.\n\nBefore, in between and after we give you our big, wide Open Stream uninterrupted by commercial advertising and at no cost to you. This is non-profit radio in the extreme. Give us a listen. You won’t regret it.\n\nToday’s Musical Journey Includes Our ‘Travelin’ Fever’ EP and Some ‘Live’ Linda Ronstadt Later, Wednesday, September 7, 2022\n\nGood Morning, Musicologists! Today we’ve got the travelin’ jones with our ‘Travelin’ Fever’ EP and Linda Ronstadt ‘live’ from Budokan in Japan.\n\nHere’s today’s musical lineup:\n\n10:00 a.m. Travelin’ Fever: Various Artists\n\nSongs about the road have always been great fodder for musicians and we’ve got a great extended playlist on that subject today! You’ll hear Canned Heat, Tom Petty & The Heartbreakers, Creedence Clearwater Revival, the Steve Miller Band, Jackson Browne, Bonnie Raitt, Dan Fogelberg, Bruce Springsteen, Linda Ronstadt, Led Zeppelin, Paul McCartney & Wings, The Doors, The Eagles, Little Feat, The Band, Willie Nelson, Edwin Starr, Janis Joplin, Guy Clark, The Traveling Wilburys, Asleep At The Wheel, The Byrds, Joan Baez, Mudcrutch, Loggins & Messina, Buffalo Springfield and more!\n\n7:00 p.m. Linda Ronstadt Live at Nippon Budokan, Tokyo, Japan, March 3, 1979\n\nIt was one of those nights where I hadn’t yet decided on the second act for today. Then I saw Linda Ronstadt’s name trending on Twitter. Like many of her fans, I went into a panic. I was happy to find out that it was just an old interview where she skewered Rupert Murdoch…at a time where most of us hadn’t yet been exposed to what he was really about. She, however, was dating Jerry Brown at the time and was very much in tune. Needless to say, I was relieved. Therefore, you all have this great concert to go to tonight!\n\nLife is full of risks. This is not one of them. This is a no-brainer. We play music all day and night, non-stop, completely free to the public. No. You cannot created “custom” playlists here. But that’s not what radio is all about. For me, the excitement came from wondering what song was coming next. No. You will not hear heavy metal, rap, hip-hop, disco or any related content here. We’re not trying to be all things to all people. But we’re totally free and we’ve got a 29,000-song catalogue at our fingertips, a ton of playlists and more coming. What’s not to love?\n\nIt’s Friday and We’ve Got Otis Redding, Trifectas at the Top of Every Hour, and Our ‘Here Comes The Night’ EP Later, September 2, 2022\n\nGood Morning, Musicologists! We’ve got a great day lined up today as we feature our first night-time multi-artist EP at the request of some of our late-night listeners!\n\nHere’s your musical lineup:\n\n9:00 a.m. In the Spotlight: The Music of Otis Redding\n\nThe world first heard Otis Redding at the Monterey International Pop Festival. It would not be long after that performance that we would lose him. But his musical legacy lives on here in The Mermaid Lounge.\n\nTrifecta Open Stream Afternoon\n\nWe’re running Trifectas at the top of every hour through 6:00 p.m. EST. Here are the featured artists:\n\n11:00 a.m. George Harrison\n\n12:00 p.m. Fats Domino\n\n1:00 p.m. Carly Simon\n\n2:00 p.m. Roy Orbison\n\n3:00 p.m. Linda Ronstadt\n\n4:00 p.m. Talking Heads\n\n5:00 p.m. Mudcrutch\n\n6:00 p.m. The Traveling Wilburys\n\n7:00 p.m. Here Comes The Night: Various Artists\n\nWe’ve received a few requests to run an EP later in the evening, so it’s only appropriate that we start with our ‘Here Comes The Night’ EP. You will hear Warren Zevon, the J. Geils Band, Tom Petty & The Heartbreakers, Van Morrison, Patti Smith, Creedence Clearwater Revival, Bruce Springsteen, The Kinks, The Electric Prunes, Phoebe Snow, Joe Walsh, The Eagles, The Ronettes, John Cougar Mellencamp, Linda Ronstadt, Joni Mitchell, Emmylou Harris, The Doors, Poco, Neil Diamond, The Animals, The Band, The Rolling Stones, Don McLean, Steve Winwood, The Traveling Wilburys, Cat Stevens, Sam Cooke, Jimmy Cliff, Bonnie Raitt and many more!\n\nWe’re here totally free of charge for your listening pleasure 24/7. No lies. No surprises. No credit card or personal information required. All you need is a computer and an open tab. So, what are you waiting for?\n\nThe Work Week is Back and We’ve Got The Hollies, Linda Ronstadt & a Trifecta Afternoon On Tap, Monday, July 25, 2022\n\nGood Morning, Workers! We’re facing another work week and it starts off steamy both inside and out as we’ve got some brand new ‘live’ Linda Ronstadt later on, along with The Hollies and some Trifectas.\n\nHere’s today’s musical landscape:\n\n11:00 a.m. In The Spotlight: The Music of The Hollies\n\nFormed in Salford, England, in 1962, the Hollies were a force in music throughout the sixties and into the seventies and were most known for their distinctive three-part harmonies. But let’s not get too damned technical here: They were just a great band and one of the most influential British Invasion bands.\n\n2:00 p.m. Open Stream with Afternoon Trifectas!\n\nWe haven’t had one of these afternoons in a while, so it is about damned time.\n\n2:00 p.m. Guy Clark\n\n3:00 p.m. Sam Cooke\n\n4:00 p.m. Canned Heat\n\n5:00 p.m. Valerie Carter\n\n6:00 p.m. Norah Jones\n\n7:00 p.m. Linda Ronstadt Live at The Calderone Concert Hall, Hempstead, NY, January 29, 1975 NEW!\n\nLinda Ronstadt was the christening act in the opening of the Calderone back in the day and Tom Rush was her opening act. This performance from 1975 was broadcast on WLIR-FM and most of the songs are from Don’t Cry Now and Heart Like a Wheel. I have seen Ronstadt perform live 39 times in my lifetime, and she never disappointed. Ever. This one is no exception.\n\nJoin your friends. We’ve got Croatia, Romania, Spain, the UK, France, Germany, Greece, The Faroe Islands, Australia, Canada, and some folks in Kansas, New York, and Florida on this morning. Make your Monday more tolerable.\n\nToday, We Celebrate Ronstadt’s 76th Birthday Mixed in With All That Wide Open Stream, Sunday, July 17, 2022\n\nToday we celebrate the 76th birthday of Linda Ronstadt, a woman whose indelible mark on music is legendary. From the very beginning, Linda Ronstadt made sure she was in charge of her own career, and she did a hell of a job with it. She defied those who wanted to pigeon-hole her sound to sing just about any damned thing she wanted.\n\nHere’s your musical landscape for today:\n\n11:00 a.m. Album of The Week: Hasten Down The Wind by Linda Ronstadt\n\nThis was a very tough selection. Like asking me to pick one singular favorite Linda Ronstadt song. But in the end, it made its case. Released in 1976, this was Ronstadt’s seventh studio album during a time when she was the undisputed Queen of Rock. (Some of us believe she still is, frankly.) Although the Laurel Canyon influence is all over this album, Linda Ronstadt switched gears on this one a bit and began to sing the songs of some new songwriters, like Karla Bonoff and Warren Zevon, who would soon be on the map. Two songs were also co-authored by Ronstadt, Try Me Again and Lo Siento Mi Vida, the latter being her first move into the Spanish sound.\n\nThe album became her third consecutive million-selling album, the first such feat by a female singer. Hasten Down The Wind earned Ronstadt a Grammy for the Best Pop Vocal Performance, Female, in 1977, her second of 13 career Grammys. It was also the second of four country #1 albums for her.\n\n2:00 p.m. Linda Ronstadt Live at The Orpheum Theatre, Boston, MA, May 14, 1995\n\nI had the absolute pleasure of being at this show in 1995. I remember it well. It was a real treat to have two brilliant women on stage that night as the late, great Valerie Carter was the opening act and joined Ronstadt on stage for a couple of beautiful songs. The best thing about Linda Ronstadt is that she was never threatened by sharing the stage with others, male or female, and that she felt like she was better as part of a bigger whole…in spite of her amazing solo career. And this brings us to our final programming for the day.\n\n7:00 p.m. Linda Ronstadt & Friends: Duets and More\n\nWe close out the day with a great playlist of songs where Ronstadt shares the limelight. She’s either a back-up singer or a duet singer on these songs, sharing the duties with the likes of Glenn Frey, Valerie Carter, J.D. Souther, Frank Sinatra, Rosemary Clooney, Bette Midler, Emmylou Harris, The McGarrigle Sisters, Bonnie Raitt, Maria Muldaur, Nicolette Larson, James Taylor, Hoyt Axton and others. A fitting ending to our birthday celebration.\n\nBefore, in between and after, there’ll be all that wide Open Stream. Join us for Linda’s 76th birthday bash today. We’re sure you won’t regret it.\n\nWe Kick Off a New Month With Our Big, Bad ‘M is For Motown’ EP and Linda Ronstadt In the Spotlight, Wednesday, June 1, 2022\n\nHere’s your musical landscape:\n\n10:00 a.m. M is For Motown: Various Artists\n\nEvery month is Black History Month here in The Mermaid Lounge. We have more than one soul and R & B EP in our collection, but this one focuses strictly on Motown artists. You’ll hear Barrett Strong, Eddie Kendricks, Eddie Holland, Edwin Starr, Gladys Knight & The Pips, The Jackson Five, Kim Weston, Jr. Walker & The All Stars, Marvin Gaye, Martha & The Vandellas, Stevie Wonder, Smokey Robinson & The Miracles, The Four Tops, The Isley Brothers, The Temptations, The Contours, Mary Wells, Rare Earth, Tammi Terrell, Diana Ross & The Supremes, the Marvelettes, The Spinners, Jimmy Ruffin, and more! That amounts to just about five hours of uninterrupted music from Motor City.\n\n7:00 p.m. In The Spotlight: The Music of Linda Ronstadt\n\nThe music world is full of judgment. In fact, you can look to the word ‘judgment’ as an example. Nobody can really definitively tell you the correct spelling, so fuck it. Some people in music are made to write. Bobbie Gentry, for example, never wanted to sing. She wanted to write songs for other people. Linda Ronstadt, on the other hand, has proven that she can write, but she didn’t think it was necessary since there were already so many great songwriters out there. All she wanted to do was sing. And that’s just fine with me because that voice can sing anything. She’s simply the greatest female vocalist of all time. If you have not yet had the chance to see the documentary, The Sound of My Voice, you need to. The fact that she can no longer sing is a travesty. But we have an amazing body of work from Linda Ronstadt, and it is on display here tonight.\n\nThis is a most excellent day to tune us in. I mean, it doesn’t get much better than this. We’re totally free. We do not accept or air advertising. And we’re on the air 24/7. What more could you ask for?"
