Real, raw and 100% LIVE music. From Linda’s 1967 beginnings with The Stone Poneys, to her amazing renditions in the 70s of songs by beloved songwriters like Smokey Robinson, Warren Zevon, Lowell George, The Eagles and The Rolling Stones, to her 80s smash album Mad Love with its New Wave vibe. Ronstadt Revival will take you on a timeless journey of all of your favorites including, You’re No Good, Blue Bayou, When Will I Be Loved, Tracks of My Tears and so much more!\n\nShannon Rae is a southern California native raised on the Eagles, Tom Petty and of course… Linda Ronstadt. As a matter fact the first album she purchased with her own money was Linda Ronstadt‘s greatest hits, and she about wore that record out!\n\nShannon is an accomplished original artist and songwriter and has released three albums, her self titled, her sophomore album Lucky 13 and the aptly titled #3. She has toured with her band, Shannon Rae and 100 Proof, over the last 5 years and has shared the stage with many modern country rockers including, A Thousand Horses, Eli Young Band and Runaway June as well as country rock icons Wynonna Judd, The Marshall Tucker Band and even the legendary Roy Clark!\n\nIn every performance, Shannon passionately pours her heart and soul into the music of this legendary artist that has inspired not only her, but so many female artists. When asked what is the best part of performing with Ronstadt Revival she says, hearing all of you Ronstadt fans sing along at the top of your lungs!\n\nVisit the Ronstadt Revival’s Website"
