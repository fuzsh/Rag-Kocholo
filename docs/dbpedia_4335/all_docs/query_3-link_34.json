Swamp pop music is admittedly a fairly obscure sub-genre of rock and roll and had only a brief foray into mainstream rock in the 1960s, primarily exemplified by a vocal duo from Louisiana, Dale and Grace. Swamp pop is indigenous to the Acadiana region of south Louisiana and an adjoining section of southeast Texas and was created in the 1950s and early 1960s by teenaged Cajuns and black Creoles. It combines New Orleans-style rhythm and blues, country and western, and traditional French Louisiana musical influences. During the genre's heydey (1958-1964), several swamp pop songs appeared on national U.S. charts including Jimmy Clanton's \"Just A Dream\", Warren Storm's \"Prisoner's Song\", Phil Phillips' \"Sea Of Love\", Rod Bernard's \"This Should Go On Forever\", Joe Barry's \"I'm A Fool To Care\", and Dale and Grace's \"I'm Leaving It Up To You\".\n\nDale and Grace probably would not rank high on most anyones top 1960s pop-rock music performers list, however, they did leave their mark on '60s pop music history with their Cajun-country rock style known as swamp pop music. Dale Houston and Grace Broussard had two Top 10 Gold Record hits in the early sixties with \"I'm Leaving It Up To You\" that was a #1 hit on the Billboard Hot 100 Chart for two weeks in 1963 and \"Stop And Think It Over\" that peaked at #8 in 1964. Their story begins with Dale growing up in the small town of Collins, Mississippi where his father was a minister. By sixth grade, Dale began his musical training by taking piano lessons, but had to quit after three months, as his parents could no longer afford them. From that point on, Dale was self taught and polished his musical skills by playing and singing in church. Determined to make music his life, an 18 year old Dale recorded a song called \"Lonely Man\" that climbed to #75 on the national record charts. Dale was playing in Baton Rouge in 1960 when Montel Record executive, Sam Montel caught his act in a local bar. After listening to some of Dale's material, Montel signed him to compose exclusively for his label. Dale wrote and recorded \"Lonely Room\", \"Bird With A Broken Wing\", and \"That's What I Like About Us\", but none met with success.\n\nIn 1963, Dale was working in a honkey tonk bar in Ferriday, Louisiana when Montel drove from Baton Rouge to get Dale. Sam had an idea that Dale singing harmony with a female would be a good production. He picked up Dale that night and drove back to Baton Rouge, then went to Prairieville and picked up 19 year old Grace Broussard and introduced them to each other. Sam had a piano at his home and the two started rehearsing in preparation of a recording session the next day. It was after midnight and the duo had been at it for about 4 hours when Dale started playing the old Don & Dewey song from the mid '50s called \"I'm Leaving It Up To You\". Sam came out of a dead sleep when he heard it from his bedroom, ran in, still in his underwear and screamed, \"play it again....that's a hit!\"\n\nThe next day Sam Montel took Dale and Grace to the recording studio where they cut 4 songs. Montel Records then released \"I'm Leaving It Up To You\", where according to The Billboard Book of Number One Hits by Fred Bronson, the song broke at Top 40 radio station KNUZ in Houston, where it was unanimously voted the \"pick hit of the week\" by the station's panel of seven deejays. By October, 1963 it was the #1 record in the nation, only to be eventually knocked out of the top spot by The Beatles. The song also reached #1 on the Billboard Adult Contemporary Chart.\n\nThe pair spent much of the rest of the year touring with Dick Clark's Caravan Of Stars and had Thanksgiving at Clark's house. They followed their first hit with a song called \"Stop And Think It Over\" that went to #8 in 1964, but 'The British Invasion' was beginning to take a firm grasp on pop-rock music in America and personal problems between Dale and Grace were starting to take their toll, as well. In addition, Grace's homesickness and a serious illness that landed Dale in the hospital caused the duo to separate in 1965.\n\nDale carried on, teaming with Connie Sattenfield, to form a new 'Dale and Grace', although by this time, swamp pop music was going out of style and no major hits followed. Grace Broussard and her brother also toured as Dale and Grace.\n\nRegretably, Dale Houston passed away in the fall of 2007 in Hattiesburg, Mississippi. Despite their brief foray into 1960s pop-rock music, the southern duo sold over 7 and a half million rock and roll records over the years. \"I'm Leaving It Up To You\" has been a favorite of male-female duos for years and was performed by Sonny & Cher and Donny and Marie Osmond , who returned it to the Top 10 in 1974. Donny and Marie's version of the song also was a Top 20 country hit and won the 1974 Grammy for Best Country Performance by a Duo or Group.\n\nSince the 1990s, Dale and Grace have been recognized for their contributions to music that are noted below. They certainly are the pride of Louisiana and represent the best when it comes to swamp pop music.\n\n1997- Dale and Grace were inducted into the Louisiana Hall of Fame\n\n1998- Dale and Grace were inducted into the Gulf Coast's Hall of Fame\n\nDale is inducted into the Texas Music Hall of Fame\n\n2000- Dale received the \"Louisiana Living Legends Award\" from the Public Broadcasting Service\n\n2007- Dale and Grace were named to the Delta Music Museum Hall of Fame\n\nAn interesting factoid about Dale and Grace, and particularly Dale (Houston), is that their giant hit, \"I'm Leaving It Up To You\", broke the Top 40 chart at a radio station in Houston, Texas. Another eerily interesting factoid is that while on tour in Dallas, Texas, on November 22, 1963, Dale and Grace were standing on a street corner waving to President John F. Kennedy as his motorcade passed by and within seconds and just two blocks later, Kennedy was assassinated. They returned to their hotel rooms after waving to Kennedy and didn't hear about the assassination until several hours later.\n\nTHE BRASS RING\n\n(The Band You Really DO KNOW!)\n\nThis is the biography of The Brass Ring, the 1960s instrumental group whose music was part of the briefly popular style known as \"The Now Sound\". When asked, the majority of sixties music listeners probably would not be able to identify the group.....but, most in fact, undoubtedly DO KNOW this band from New York City from their two hits that not only made Billboards Top 40 Chart, but more importantly, received huge national attention through film and many well-known television commercials. \"The Phoenix Love Theme (Senza Fine)\" charted to #32 in April 1966 and was used in the movie, \"The Flight Of The Phoenix\" starring James Stewart. \"The Dis-Advantages Of You\" reached inside the Top 40 peaking at #36 in March 1967 and was the music used for the amusing series of very popular commercials for Benson & Hedges cigarettes. Read on as you learn about the group you really DO KNOW, but just couldn't place until now!\n\nTo understand the story about The Brass Ring and \"The Now Sound\", it is important to know about the group's leader, Mr. Phil Bodner. The busiest reed man of the space age pop era, Phil Bodner played on many of the albums recorded in New York studios beween the mid-1950s and early 1970s. Bodner met the essential prerequisite of superb technical proficiency on his instrument.....in his case, the whole gamut of woodwinds. After studying music at New York University, he began working as a professional musician in New York City in the mid-1940s. Bodner then spent most of the next three decades running in and out of recording studios, as he became a highly sought-after session musician. He played with Benny Goodman's small combo of the early 1950s and recorded five albums for MGM as a member of the Metropolitan Jazz Quartet.\n\nBodner was one of the mainstays of Enoch Light's Command label and later became the leader of the successful \"Now Sound\" instrumental group, The Brass Ring. He was also a favorite of many Madison Avenue jingle composers, and played behind hundreds of television and radio advertising spots.\n\nPhil Bodner emerged from the anonymity of sessions when he began recording for ABC's Dunhill label as the head of The Brass Ring. The band specialized in \"The Now Sound\" musical style which was largely instrumental, adapting Herb Alpert's hugely successful Tijuana Brass sound and softening it by giving the melody to the reeds and loosening the rhythm to a light swinging groove. The result was the signature instrumental style of the mid-late 1960s - \"The Now Sound\", although the twin-sax sound more closely resembles Billy Vaughn whose biggest hits were in the 1950s.\n\nMadison Avenue paid Bodner its highest compliment and brought The Brass Ring to popular attention when it appropriated their tune, \"The Dis-Advantages Of You\" as the jingle for what would become the humorous series of very effective TV commercials for Benson & Hedges. Numerous other singles hit Billboard's Easy Listening Chart, and a non-chart single, \"Love In The Open Air\", is prized by collectors as it is a cover of a little known composition by Paul McCartney. Between 1965 and 1970, The Brass Ring recorded eight LPs including \"The Now Sound Of The Brass Ring\", \"Lara's Theme\", \"Love Theme From The Flight Of The Phoenix\", their highest charting album, \"Sunday Night At The Movies\", \"The Dis-Advantages Of You\", \"Gazpacho: Brass Ring Featuring Phil Bodner\", and others. The Brass Ring recorded until at least 1972 on Enoch Light's Project 3 label. After 1970, three additional CDs were released bringing the groups grand total to eleven.\n\nAfter \"The Now Sound\" became \"The Then Sound\", Bodner continued to maintain an active calendar of bookings in the studio business. However, he began to taper off in the late 1970s, and by 1981, was appearing regularly in New York City clubs as a memeber of a swing quartet. Phil Bodner died on February 24, 2008 in New York City at the age of ninety.\n\n\"AN EASY LISTENING POP GROUP - LOST, BUT NOT FORGOTTEN\"\n\n(The Biography of The Sandpipers)\n\nThe Sandpipers first foray into the national easy listening pop music spotlight came in 1966 with their cover version of \"Guantanamera\" (#9), a Latin folk song adapted from a poem by Cuban writer Jose Marti. Three months later, the male vocal trio made the Top 40 with their version of \"Louie, Louie\" (#30), the controversial, but high charting song popularized by The Kingsmen in 1963. There would be a four year gap before the group hit the Billboard Chart again with \"Come Saturday Morning\" (#17), a song used in the movie \"The Sterile Cuckoo\" starring Liza Minnelli. This is the legacy of The Sandpipers, not a super group with lots of top charting Gold Singles and media exposure, but a group that does deserve to be remembered for their contribution to the easy listening music genre of the sixties decade. This is their story including several issues that developed over the years that may or may not have impacted their ultimate degree of success, but from a historical perspective, leaves one to wonder.\n\nBefore forming their own group, the three young men from Los Angeles, Jim Brady, Mike Piano, and Richard Shoff, first performed together in California's Mitchell Boys Choir. A short time later, they began their music career as \"The Four Seasons\", a name that was quickly pointed out to them was already being used by a group in New York. They promptly changed their name to \"The Grads\", however, this name would not last long, either.\n\nAlthough The Grads did not set the charts on fire with their early recordings, they performed well enough to secure a residency in a Lake Tahoe nightclub where a friend brought them to the attention of trumpeter, composer, and owner of A&M Records, Herb Alpert. The musician extraordinaire was impressed enough to give The Grads a shot, but after a few singles without success, the group agreed upon a name change to \"The Sandpipers\". Though it did not cause a problem, this name, like their original name, was also being used by another group....., this time by a girl trio in Florida. After the name change, their producer, Tommy LiPuma, recomended they record the Cuban anthem, \"Guantanamera\". Once released in 1966, \"Guantanamera\" became a major transatlantic hit, reaching the Top 10 in both the United Sates and Britain. The boys finally had their first hit, except they were no longer just 'boys' and no longer a trio. Along with the name change came a fourth member, supporting female vocalist, Pamela Ramcier. She contributed ethereal, wordless vocals to the group, never singing as harmony, but functioning in a similar role to the strings that comprised the group's instrumental backing. For some unknown reason, Ramcier was always kept in the background during concerts and was never credited on the group's albums despite becoming an integral part of The Sandpipers sound. In fact, her voice was one of the most distinctive elements of the group's music. This natural attribute along with wearing mini-skirts and go-go boots during concerts often made her more noticeable than the actual Sandpipers.\n\nThe foursome managed to follow \"Guantanamera\" with several minor hits, including their own version of \"Louie, Louie\" and \"Kumbaya\". Then it would be four years before the group charted again in 1970, this time with \"Come Saturday Morning\". Like with \"Guantanamera\", the group distinguished itsself with light, breezy harmonies along with Ramcier's vocals drifting in and out of the music. \"Come Saturday Morning\" was used in the hit movie, \"The Sterile Cuckoo\", nominated for Academy Awards for Best Actress in a Leading Role (Liza Minnelli) and Best Music, Song (\"Come Saturday Morning\"). The group also contributed the title song to the musical comedy film, \"Beyond The Valley Of The Dolls\" directed by Russ Meyer.\n\nBy 1970 The Sandpipers had secured seven separate LP entries on the US Billboard 200 Chart. Though the group continued to record well into the seventies, their audience declined with each successive year. After spending five years without having any hits, The Sandpipers finally broke up in 1975. One possible partial explanation for the groups lack of success in the second half of the sixties was confusion that may have existed between themselves and the \"psychedelic\" pop band, The Lemon Pipers. The latter group overlapped The Sandpipers' years of success, particularly during 1967-1968. The Lemon Pipers are known primarily for their song \"Green Tambourine\" which reached #1 in the US in 1968 and has been credited as being the first bubblegum #1 hit, ushering in the bubblegum pop era. Despite group name problems, the unknown issue surrounding Pamela Ramcier, and potential confusion with the Lemon Pipers, The Sandpipers did carve a niche for themselves in the world of 1960s easy listening pop music.\n\n\"LOVE (CAN MAKE YOU HAPPY)\" and MERCY\n\n\"Wake up in the morning with the sunshine in your eyes\n\nAnd the smell of flowers blooming fills the air.\n\nYour mind is filled with the thoughts of a certain someone - that you love;\n\nYour life is filled with joy when she is there.\n\nLove can make you happy if you find someone who cares\n\nTo give a life time to you and who has a love to share.\n\nIf you think you've found someone you'll love forevermore,\n\nThen it's worth the price you'll have to pay (pay).\n\nTo have, to hold's important when forever is the phrase\n\nThat means the love you've found is going to stay.\n\nLove can make you happy if you find someone who cares\n\nTo give a life time to you and who has a love to share.\n\nLa-love, la-love\n\nLove can make you happy.\n\nLove can make you happy.\n\nLove can make yu happy.\n\nLove...\"\n\nThese are the lyrics to one of the most touching and heart-warming ballads I have ever heard, \"Love (Can Make You Happy)\" by the group Mercy. The other day I was listening to a great '60s music radio station in Phoenix and heard this timeless classic, one of my all-time favorite late sixties songs. For some unknown reason, \"Love (Can Make You Happy)\" is not often played here despite the phenomenal success of the record in May 1969. \"Love\" was a Gold Single that charted all the way to #2 on the Billboard Hot 100 Chart making Mercy an overnight sensation. The tune also peaked at #2 on the Adult Contemporary Chart, as well.\n\nMercy is generally considered a \"one-hit-wonder\" group that had only minimal success after their first and only big hit, \"Love (Can Make You Happy)\". In looking at the genesis of Mercy, the band was formed by Jack Sigler while still in high school in Tampa, Florida. Sigler continued to perfect his writing, arranging and performing skills and in 1968, Sigler and Mercy happened to be heard by George Roberts, a Hollywood producer who was shooting a film, \"Fireball Jungle\" in the Tampa area. Roberts decided he wanted Mercy to appear in the movie featuring \"Love (Can Make You Happy)\". \"Love\", written by Sigler when he was only 16, sold over one million copies and became an international classic. The flip side, \"Fireball\", was a major hit in Japan and parts of Europe.\n\nMercy was then selected by Warner Brothers to record an album as a result of their hit single; the LP, \"Mercy & Love Can Make You Happy\", peaked at #38 on the U.S. charts. The album spun off another hit for Mercy, \"Forever\" followed up by another Jack Sigler original, \"Hello Baby\", which broke into the charts in various parts of the country.\n\nThe original Mercy lineup consisted of seven members, five male and two female, making it one of the larger sized groups of the 1960s. Following their three hits in the Top 100, the band toured the U.S. and Canada extensively, appearing with such greats as Gary Puckett and The Union Gap, The Turtles, The Association, The Cowsills, The Box Tops, The Byrds, Frankie Valli and The 4 Seasons, Tommy James and The Shondells along with many others.\n\nMercy also made several national TV appearances including The Mike Douglas Show, The National March of Dimes with Gary Collins and Mary Ann Mobley plus interviews on Dick Clark's American Bandstand. Jack and Mercy was booked for The Ed Sullivan Show, but was forced to cancel due to scheduling problems.\n\nSome interesting factoids about Mercy include:\n\n*\"Love (Can Make You Happy)\" was recorded at the same studio in Tampa where The Royal Guardsmen recorded \"Snoopy Vs The Red Baron\"\n\n*In 1984, Jack Sigler was awarded with BMI's prestigious \"Millionaire Award\" (one of only 200 songs to do so at the time) and is now well past two million airplays\n\n*Jack and Mercy have the unique distinction of sharing the Top 10 with the three biggest artists in history, Elvis Presley (\"In The Ghetto\"), Frank Sinatra (\"My Way\"), and The Beatles (\"Get Back\"). It was the only time in history these legends would top the charts at the same time Mercy was at #2!\n\n*\"Love (Can Make You Happy)\" is also in Billboard's Top 1000 songs since 1955\n\n*The movie \"Fireball Jungle\" was the last movie that the great actor Lon Chaney Jr. made before his death\n\nThe next time you get a bit down on things, take a listen to \"Love (Can Make You Happy)\". The warm, soothing melody of this song and thoughts of finding the \"right girl\" back when you were young and yearning for love in the '60s can only make you feel better. I guarantee it.\n\n\"THE 123 MAN\"\n\nThe Biography of Len Barry\n\nHis real name was Leonard Borisoff and he was one of many outstanding recording artists in the 1960s to come out of the \"City of Brotherly Love\", Philadelphia. Most '60s music afficionados know Borisoff better as Len Barry, most notably for his huge hit from October of 1965, \"1-2-3\" that charted all the way to #2 on the Billboard Hot 100 Chart where it remained in the Top 40 for ten weeks. Barry's musical career, however, begins long before 1965 and the overwhelming popularity of \"1-2-3\".\n\nThe blue-eyed white soul vocalist from west \"Philly\" first debuted his musical talents as the lead vocalist on The Boss-Tones 1958 single \"Mope-Itty Mope\". A year before, however, Barry formed the group that became The Dovells and was lead singer on their 1961 hit record \"The Bristol Stomp\" that reached #2 on the Billboard Chart. He also sang lead on the band's #3 charting hit, \"You Can't Sit Down\" in 1963. Barry quit The Dovells, though in late 1963 and soon signed with Decca Records as a solo artist.\n\nIn 1965, Barry's single \"1-2-3\" became a major hit, just missing the #1 spot on the pop charts. In the United Kingdom, \"1-2-3\" climbed to #3 on the UK Singles Chart. His early 1966 follow-up hit, \"Like A Baby\" peaked at #27 in the US, while in Britain it reached #10. Both songs were partly composed by Barry and David White (first tenor), one of the original Juniors from Danny & The Juniors, another rock group from Philadelphia. It was on \"1-2-3\" and the similarly paced \"Like A Baby\" that Barry's white soul vocals were best exemplified. In April 1966, Len Barry would score his second and final follow-up hit record, \"Somewhere\" (the \"West Side Story\" anthem) that topped out at #26 on Billboard. Unfortunately for Barry, \"Somewhere\" had already charted in the UK by virtue of one P.J. Proby.\n\nmusic machine of the 1950s and 1960s, has certainly left his mark in '60s rock music history.\n\nDespite his sharp suits and clean-cut image, Barry seemed a Philadelphia teen-idol chronologically cut adrift already in 1965, and his contention that long-haired groups were on the way out caused a few ripples in the pop press. Hopes of a top-rated singing career waned greatly during the psychedelic boom of the late '60s and with hits drying up, Barry went out of fashion and gradually toned down his lively stage act for cabaret purposes. By the end of the decade and through the 1970s, Barry moved into songwriting and production work with WMOT Productions.\n\nFrom 1965 through 1982, Len Barry recorded and released four albums, his first, \"1-2-3\" in 1965. This LP was followed in 1967 with \"My Kind Of Soul\", and later in 1972 with \"Ups & Downs\". His final long-playing vinyl disc would come out in 1982, entitled \"More From The 123 Man\".\n\nLen Barry, part of the dominant Philadelphia rock Besides his three Top 40 hit records, his legacy includes:\n\n* The song \"1-2-3\" was featured on the soundtrack for the highly acclaimed film, \"Mr. Holland's Opus\"\n\n* \"1-2-3\" was one of the songs that appeared in John Lennon's jukebox.\n\n* In December 2005, Welsh singer-songwriter Cerys Matthews recorded a new version of \"1-2-3\" in Nashville, Tennessee,\n\nUPDATE ON THE EXPORTS\n\nEarly in 2008 I wrote an article entitled, \"HELP SOLVE A 60s ROCK GROUP MYSTERY\" (Who Were The Exports?). Despite many hours of research, I had been unsuccessful in finding out and learning more about this 1960s instrumental rock group that had recorded one of my all-time favorite instumentals from the period, \"Car Hop\". My thought was that by soliciting help via The 60s Official Site, perhaps someone might come forward with the information I was seeking, or at least provide a lead in helping solve this mystery. It would not be too many months later that I received a tip from someone who had read the article that would ultimately lead me to Ron Jongsma, one of the founding members of the band. After several telephone conversations with Ron, not only was the mystery of \"Who Were The Exports?\" solved, but I would be able to write the first-ever biography of this talented band from Chicago. It should be noted that though \"Car Hop\" never charted nationally, it was very popular and charted in the Top 10 on many radio stations throughout the Midwest and in southern Canada and now is part of the body of classic hot rod instrumental music from the 1960s. The history of The Exports does not end here, however; lets fast-forward to late summer, 2009.\n\nRecently I was surprised to receive additional biographical information on The Exports by the only other remaining and original member of the group, Mr. Howard \"Howie\" Friedman, the band's drummer. Somehow Howie had learned about the initial article and subsequent follow-up/biography, \"MYSTERY SOLVED! (Who Were The Exports?)\", and wanted to provide some added information on the band he helped found. Here are the new details chronicling the story of The Exports.\n\nRon Jongsma and Howie Friedman knew each other since junior high school days in Hammond, Indiana. It was Ron's second Cousin, Tom Barnhart and his boyfriend, George Felaney who comprised and were the original members of The Exports. The band was at their best in playing insturmental tunes that included many by The Ventures. One day George came up with a guitar lick that sounded very cool to the rest of the group. Each of the members then proceeded to craft their own parts of the song until they were all pleased with the end result - \"Car Hop\". The \"B side\" tune, \"Seat Belts Please\", came about with the same method of creation. \"Seat Belts Please\" received a lot of air play in Chicago on the predominately black radio stations. Unlike \"Car Hop\" and many other rock n' roll tunes, \"Seat Belts Please\" had a funkier, almost R&B feel to it that included some syncopated passages.\n\nTom and George were in a National Guard unit during those turbulent days of the Viet Nam War and were required to fulfill their active duty status at the same time as the band was playing booked engagements in the Chicagoland area. Ron and Howie decided to honor the bookings with substitute musicians for Tom and George. One of the replacement players was Rick Grigsby who lived across the street from Ron; the other was a good friend of Rick named Greg Scott. The two new additions were both killer lead guitar players. It was at this point that Ron and Howie had a friendly parting of the ways with Tom and George and left The Exports. The quartet of Ron, Howie, Rick and Greg formed a new band called The Kritters, a very successful regional band that played together for several years.\n\nInterestingly, after the recording sessions and many, many engagements had all come to an end, nearly all of The Exports and The Kritters would have successful careers in the music industry (see \"Mystery Solved!\") including Greg from The Kritters who relocated to Florida to pursue a full time music career. As previously mentioned, Howie was offered a good job in Texas where he represented Fender Musical Instruments for nearly 30 years. It was only of recent that he retired, but continues to live in the Dallas area. According to Howie, \"Ron, Rick and I remain best of friends more than 40 years after our fifteen minutes of fame\". Though Ron and Rick have left careers in the music business, the two childhood friends continue to work together, both in the wine cellar business.\n\nThrough the worldwide reach of the Internet and the popularity of The 60s Official Site, another part of 1960s rock n' roll history has been written for all to read, ponder and enjoy. Much has been written about the super groups of the sixties, but we must not forget the many musical contributions other groups such as The Exports have made to the sum total of music now known as classic rock and roll, or \"oldies\". The Exports and other 1960s groups like them are the glaze on the aggregate of music that defines this decade and makes it so very, very special, especially for the millions of Baby Boomers around the country and around the world.\n\n{Writer's Note}: It has been personally gratifying to not only have solved the mystery of an outstanding instrumental rock band, but to write the story of this once popular group from Chicago whose music provided me and many thousands of others with much enjoyment during the decade of America's greatest music - the 1960s. In his e-mail to me, Howie Friedman thanked me for my interest \"in one of the happiest times in my life\". To this end may I say, \"Thank you, Howie, Ron, Tom, George , Rick and Greg for giving us some of the very best musical memories one can have from those special years growing up in the 1960s. It truly has been my pleasure\"!\n\nAND NOW THEY'RE ROCKIN' IN HEAVEN\n\nAs an aging' 60s \"Baby-Boomer\", I have become more aware of my increasing age as well as those who influenced my life through their rock and roll music in the 1960s. Its a sad day when I hear that another '60s rock artist has passed on and is now \"rockin' in Heaven\". I keep trying to think that all of us who grew up in this most dynamic decade of all time and listened to the greatest music ever made, would always continue to be young, but I guess that isn't the case. Well, anyway, I'm going to at least keep trying and hope for the best.\n\nMy realization of getting older led me to think about the hundreds and hundreds of rock and roll artists who have all contributed in their own unique, special way to the body of music commonly now referred to as \"Oldies\". In researching those recording artists that have passed, I was amazed at two striking facts: the unusually high number, many at very young ages, and the myriad of causes leading to their passing. The list of medical diseases alone that caused so many deaths reads like a shopping list for a large family at Christmas time. And then there are all the other causes such as auto accidents, airplane crashes, murder, drug overdoses, electrocution, etc.\n\nI have listed below a comprehensive list of '60s artists that have passed, including for many, the cause of death. If in the process of researching this topic I have missed or overlooked a musician, please let the Webmaster know so the person may be included in the list. May God Bless those who have left us and may they be at peace, rockin' in the biggest rock and roll venue anywhere, HEAVEN.\n\nJan Berry (JAN & DEAN): one-half of the duo of Jan & Dean, passed away on March 26, 2004 after suffering a seizure at his home.

On the R&B Chart, it was a #1 hit for four weeks. At the same time, the \"Mashed Potato\" became a popular dance craze and was danced to songs such as Dee Dee Sharp's \"Mashed Potato Time\". Also referred to as \"mash potato\" or \"mashed potatoes\", the dance move vaguely resembles that of The Twist, by Sharp's fellow Philadelphian, Chubby Checker. Sharp sang on Chubby Checker's huge hit, \"Slow Twistin'\" that charted to #3 at the very same time \"MPT\" was on the charts and being played across the country.\n\nLiterally three months after \"MPT\", Sharp had another Billboard Hot 100 hit with \"Gravy (For My Mashed Potatoes)\" that peaked at #9. This continued her string of successful Top 40 hits in 1962-1963 (noted below) which would eventually earn her the title of, \"The Queen of Philadelphia Soul Music\". Dee Dee Sharp's rapid rise to fame in the world of pop, R&B, and soul music all began by singing in her grandfather's church. At the young age of 13, Sharp answered a newspaper advertisement for a girl who could read music, play piano and sing. Soon she was singing background vocals on records by Frankie Avalon, Freddy \"Boom Boom\" Cannon, and Chubby Checker. Her first major record came about in singing with Chubby Checker on \"Slow Twistin'\" in early 1962. It was at this time that Dee Dee took center stage at Cameo Parkway Records when she was asked to record her first solo single, \"Mashed Potato Time\". The record soared up the pop and R&B charts and was followed by \"Gravy\", \"Ride!\" (#5), \"Do The Bird\" (#10), and \"Wild!\" (#33); Sharp also had four other records make it on the Billboard Hot 100 Chart. Sharp and Checker joined together and recorded an album entitled \"Down To Earth\", one of nine albums by Sharp released by Cameo Records. Along with \"Slow Twistin'\", Sharp's ten hit singles were all recorded and released in a span of three years from 1962 to 1965.\n\nOnly in her teens, Dee Dee Sharp became an international star. She toured extensively throughout the U.S. and Europe, quite often as part of Dick Clark's \"Caravan of Stars\". She was also a familiar face in the extremely popular teenage girls publication, \"16 Magazine\". Her days in the recording studio did not stop here, however, as she recorded three singles from 1966 to 1968 including a duet with Ben E. King on \"Whatcha Gonna Do About It\". In 1967 she married famed record producer Kenny Gamble. Two more singles appeared on Gamble & Huff's TSOP record label, plus the album, \"Happy 'Bout The Whole Thing\". She then signed with Philadelphia International Records for five more singles and \"Conquer The World Together\"\", another duet, this time with David Siqler. Sandwiched in between making records and marriage, Dee Dee made many television appearances on such national shows as \"The Ed Sullivan Show\", the \"Tonight Show\", \"The Mike Douglas Show\", \"American Bandstand\", \"Entertainment Tonight\", etc.\n\nIn the 1970s Sharp headed Huga Management for her then-husband Kenny Gamble. She guided such noted artists as Harold Melvin & The Blue Notes, The O'Jays, Billy Paul and Teddy Pendergrass into super stardom. Sharp recorded three albums of her own for the Philadelphia International Record label, criticallty acclaimed and arguably her best.\n\nThere were both bad and good times for Dee Dee in the early 1980s. In 1980, Sharp divorced Gamble, but maintained good visibility via television, tours, concerts, and club dates that took her around the world. In 1981 she scored a #1 dance hit on the Hot Dance Club Play Chart with \"Breaking and Entering\"/\"Easy Money\" from her album \"Dee Dee\". Sharp also appeared in films, including \"Desperately Seeking Susan\", \"Don't Knock The Twist\", \"Hairspray\", \"Sister Act\", and \"Troop Beverly Hills\".\n\nIf you ever have the opportunity to see Dee Dee Sharp in concert, please do. She is, as the saying goes, a \"must see\"! Her performances are powerful, yet passionate and vesatile and her tantalizing vocals with a sassy style have been Sharp's signature during her nearly forty year career as a song stylist.\n\nSome interesting factoids about Dee Dee Sharp include:\n\n* Sharp was the first black female teen idol\n\n* Despite an incredibly hectic music career, Sharp is a college graduate and holds a PhD in Psychology from the University of Pennsylvania\n\nTHE FIVE AMERICANS----THE PRIDE OF TEXAS\n\nThe Biograpy of The Five Americans\n\nRecently on a ham radio net I host, a discussion developed around a 1960s band that, I must confess, I had forgotten about and had not heard their music on the 'oldies' airwaves in decades-- The Five Americans. The group from Dallas, Texas, had four Top 40 hits in 1966-1967, most notably \"Western Union\" that charted all the way to #5 on the Billboard Hot 100 Chart in March 1967. One of the net members asked me when I mentioned the name of this major hit if this was the song where the group sings the refrain in \"Morse code\"-like harmony, to which I replied, \"Yes, it certainly is\"! Singing in \"Morse code\"-like fashion, I must assume, was perhaps used to identify/reference the days when Western Union telegrams were indeed sent in Morse code via telegraph.\n\nThe members of The Five Americans first met in Durant, Oklahoma at Southeastern Oklahoma State University in 1962. Mike Rabon took on the leadership role of the five young college students and formed a group called The Mutineers. Other members of the band included John Durrill on keyboards, Norman Ezell, guitar and harmonica, Jim Grant, bassist, and Jimmy Wright, drummer. The band, with Rabon on lead guitar, played at local beer joints and fraternity dances until the summer of 1964 when Rabon suggested they go to Dallas to try and make enough money to pay for tuition for the following fall semester. The group also made another major decision at this time and that was to change their name. It was in 1964 that the onslaught of the 'British Invasion' was beginning with bands permeating the American pop music scene with strange sounding names. Reflecting on this new music phenomenon, and not wanting to be bugs or beasts of any kind, the college kids from Oklahoma decided they were simply going to be called The Five Americans.\n\nThe group with a new name achieved some area notoriety and were subsequently discovered by Jon Abnor, President of a local record label called Abnak Records. Abnor took the group under his wing and provided them the resources to write and practice original songs. In the summer of 1965, The Five Americans released an original tune entitled, \"I See The Light\". By February of 1966 the song had peaked at #26 on the Billboard Pop Chart and paved the way for a string of hits by the five young men. \"I See The Light\" was followed by \"Evol-Not Love\" which topped out at #52 on the pop chart nationwide.\n\nThen came the biggest hit of all, \"Western Union\". Mike Rabon was lead vocal on the huge hit that was inspired by a Western Union telegram sign. In addition to a #5 ranking on Billboard, \"Western Union\" went to #3 on the Cashbox Chart and sold in excess of one million records. The highly successful record made it possible for the group to appear on \"American Bandstand\" twice and on \"Where The Action Is\" a total of four times. The band also made an appearance on the popular \"Steve Allen Show\".\n\n\"Western Union\" was followed by a less gimmicky and more melodic song entitled \"Sound Of Love\" that ended up at #36, just inside the Top 40 Pop Chart. The band, bowing to pressure from DJ's around the world to write another 'communication song', then wrote and recorded \"Zip Code\" that also reached #36 on Billboard. For a short while, the band enjoyed the \"high life\", touring and making money. However, John Abnor, president of their record label and band manager, was allowed complete control of their money.\n\nIn 1969, The Five Americans would release what would be their final single, \"7:30 Guided Tour\" which only reached #96 on the Billboard Chart. At this point, the boys simply became weary of touring and of each other and all five went their separate way. The young men from Dallas would each take a different career path thereafter as noted below.\n\nMike Rabon: had a successful touring career afterwards and released two albums with UNI Records that sold well. Despite hard work and good effort on Rabon's part, most of the promotion and attention went to the only other artist that UNI had signed at the time, one Elton John. Rabon's group, Michael Rabon and Choctaw, went on to become a very successful touring band through the mid-seventies in the southwestern United States. Later Rabon returned to college and acquired a master's degree in public school administration and has been in the Oklahoma public school systems for 28 years\n\nJohn Durrill: wrote \"Dark Lady\" for Cher and \"Misery And Gin\" for Merle Haggard. Durrill was also a member of the touring band of The Ventures, the group that strangely enough influenced The Five Americans in their early years\n\nNorman Ezell: became a public school teacher and minister in northern California\n\nJim Grant: formed his own successful logo company in Dallas. One of his designs is the Chili's Restaurant logo, a huge restaurant chain in the Southwest. Grant died on November 29, 2004\n\nJimmy Wright: returned to live in Durant, Oklahoma where The Five got their start and played on commercial jingles from time to time. He would later move to Ohio and became a videographer for Breakthrough Ministries\n\nIt should be noted that after Jon Abnor's death in 1996, all rights to The Five American's songs that should have reverted to the group, were purchased by Sundazed Records. That would ultimately change and The Five Americans are now receiving the royalties they so richly deserve. Other noteworthy factoids concerning the band include The Five Americans were the first to achieve what no other group in Texas had done in 5 short years.... selling millions of singles and LPs. In January of 1998, \"Western Union\" made the one million mark in radio airplay according to BMI, Broadcast Music Incorporated.\n\nThe next time you hear a song on your favorite oldies station that includes the sounds of \"dits and dahs\" (Morse code), you undoubtedly are listening to \"Western Union\" and The Five Americans, the pride of Texas!\n\nSUNDAY WILL NEVER BE THE SAME\n\nThe Biography of Spanky and Our Gang\n\nFor whatever reason(s), some 1960s rock groups never seem to get the attention they so rightly deserve, hence this article on Spanky and Our Gang, a folk-rock band formed in Chicago in 1966 that put five Top 40 hits on the Billboard Top 100 Chart in 1967-1968. The group was led by Elaine McFarlane, nicknamed \"Spanky\" by one of the band members who, perhaps influenced by her last name, said that she resembled Our Gang (The Little Rascals) star George \"Spanky\" McFarland. However, before the members of the group even knew each other, McFarlane had been part of an ensemble called The New Wine Singers in 1963 as the folk music scene grew in popularity across the US. It was here that she met multi-instrumentalist Malcolm Hale and was given the name \"Spanky\".\n\nBy the winter of 1965, the New Wine Singers had split and McFarlane headed to Florida where she met Paul \"Oz\" Bach and Nigel Pickering. While stranded during a hurricane, the trio jammed for three straight days, resulting in her inviting the boys to Chicago. McFarlane was a native of Illinois. Later that year, McFarlane was working as a singing waitress at a club when the owner offered her a chance to form a group to open for his featured acts. She quickly recruited Pickering and Bach. McFarlane played washboard and kazoo while Pickering played guitar and Bach was on bass. The trio jokingly began calling themselves Spanky and Our Gang, playing on their singer's nicknmae. Things went surprisingly well for the trio and after receiving favorable reviews in a local newspaper, the group decided to keep the name. As they progressed, guitarist Malcolm Hale was brought in and they moved up to bigger and better venues.\n\nBy late 1966, representatives from Mercury Records took notice and signed the band to a contract. Producer Jerry Ross spent a year polishing their sound before taking them to New York to record. Here they were given a tune, \"Sunday Will Never Be The Same\" that was a perfect vehicle to showcase McFarlane's powerful voice. One month after the single was released, it peaked at #9 on the Billboard Hot 100 Chart in June 1967. When the demand for personal appearances started to grow, drummer John Seiter was added to the mix. Spanky and Our Gang were coming into prominence with a sound similar to that of The Mamas and The Papas, who coincidently, were fading in popularity. The group was also helped along by the somewhat similar appearance and vocal style of \"Spanky\" and Mama Cass Elliot. Like The Mamas and The Papas, the group was becoming known for its vocal harmonies. \"Sunday Will Never Be The Same\" was the band's first and biggest hit, striking a chord with the record-buying public during the so-called \"Summer of Love\" and putting Spanky and Our Gang on the pop music map. They continued recording several albums with some of their singles becoming hits, including \"Making Every Minute Count\" (#31) and \"Lazy Day\" (#14), both later in that same year.\n\nIn early 1968, guitarist and vocalist Lefty Baker was added to the band and his friend Kenny Hodges replaced \"Oz\" Bach on bass. The band would record and release two more songs, \"Sunday Mornin'\" that charted to #30 and \"Like To Get To Know You\" that made it to #17, both major hits for the band. \"Like To Get To Know You\" was included in the band's second album which lent it's name to the LP. The single brought Spanky and Our Gang back into the Billboard Top 20 in the summer of 1968. This last record, however, would be the final Top 40 entry for the group. In October 1968 the band suffered a tragedy when at age 27, their lead guitarist, Malcolm Hale, died of carbon monoxide poisoning reportedly emanating from a defective space heater. Hale's death has also been attributed to bronchopneumonia. In the wake of his death, the group played out its concert commitments and then took a break to reassess its future. The now 26 year old McFarlane was pregant and decided to quit performing while drummer John Seiter had been offered a chance to play with The Turtles. Rather than reorganize around such key membership changes, the group decided to call it quits.\n\nThe group's third album, \"Anything You Choose/Without Rhyme Or Reason\" was released on the Mercury label in January 1969. It contained two popular songs, \"Give A Damn\" and \"Yesterday's Rain\". \"Give A Damn\" was released as a single in the summer of 1968. In spite of being banned in several states because of the profanity in its title - and in some cases due to the fact that it was a comment on racial equality that became the theme song for the New York Urban Coalition - the song became a regional hit where released and overall made #43 on the charts. It was also performed live on an episode of The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour, resulting in the CBS Standards and Practices division to receive numerous complaints about the song's title being used during 'family viewing hours'. One such complaint reportedly came from Richard Nixon. Ironically, \"Give A Damn\" would become John Lindsay's campaign song during his successful run for Mayor of New York.\n\nA second member of Spanky and Our Gang to pass away was Lefty Baker. He died on August 11, 1971. Life, however, continued on for the remaining members of the group. In 1975, \"Spankey\" and Pickering joined with musicians Bill Plummer, Marc McClure and Jim Moon to form a new band. They recorded on the Epic label, performed on Roger McGuinn's first solo album, and toured until 1980, primarily in Texas. \"Spanky\" recorded some songs as a solo artist and then in the early 80's joined up with John Phillips and Denny Doherty as the lead singer for a re-formed version of The Mamas and The Papas. McFarlane toured the world with them for over ten years with various lineups. Meanwhile, Mercury continued issuing albums containing the music of Spanky and Our Gang for decades.\n\nSadly, a third member of the band, \"Oz\" Bach succumbed to a lengthy battle with cancer in September of 1998. As the years marched on, time and illness have taken their toll. As we all get older, time does seem to go by ever so quickly. In reflecting on this band from the latter part of the 1960s, it's \"time in the sun\" was very short, like many bands that came before it and like many other bands that came after it. Nevertheless, on a positive note, Spanky and Our Gang continue to be well-remembered by music fans of the 1960s with their legacy firmly established in the rock and roll music history of that incredible decade. Though the '60s are long gone, the music lives on including \"Sunday Will Never Be The Same\".\n\n\"Can You Dig It, Baby\"?\n\n(The Biography of The Friends Of Distinction)\n\nFor whatever reasons, the summer of 1969 is exceptionally memorable for me including the rock and roll hits I listened to every day on WLS in Chicago. One of those big hits was \"Grazing In The Grass\" by The Friends Of Distinction, a #3 charting Gold Single for the group from Los Angeles. To this day when I hear \"Grazing In The Grass\", the record resonates deep within my heart and soul and gives me that good feeling all kids have during the summer - that feeling of being carefree, having fun, staying up late, and not having to worry about going to school the next day. And perhaps, too, its the bright, uptempo orchestration of the song and the rapid syncopation of the chorus that makes this a special 60s \"feel good\" song for me.\n\nThe Friends Of Distinction were one of the most likeable and vocally cohesive singing groups of the late 1960s and early 70s. The soul pop group formed in 1968 and consisted of Harry Elston, Floyd Butler, Jessica Cleaves and Barbara Love. After polishing up their act for six months, the group hit the local tour circuit in Los Angeles and realized immediate success. With well-developed talent and the support of a widely-known manager, former NFL football great Jim Brown, the group signed with RCA Records. In 1969, \"Friends\" released their first single, \"Grazing In The Grass\" that reached #3 on the Billboard Hot 100 Chart where it achieved Gold Single status and graced the R&B charts for 17 weeks, peaking at #5.\n\nThe group, whose sound was similar to, and often confused with The Fifth Dimension, had a second major hit on the charts just four months later with \"Going In Circles\". This brilliant ballad climbed its way to #3 on the R&B charts after a very productive 19 weeks, and reached #15 on the pop charts. Like \"Grazing\", this record also sold over 1 million copies and was a Gold Single.\n\nGreat harmonies and crossover arrangements backed the individually strong lead vocals of the group members. Like The Fifth Dimension, both included tightly harmonizing men and women dressed in late 60s \"hip\" clothing, though \"Friends'\" music was generally more soulful. Combined with top notch material, the group sounded like a breath of fresh air on pop radio in 1969.\n\nThree more hit singles charted for the group - \"Love Or Let Me Be Lonely\" that went all the way to #6 on the pop charts in March 1970, followed by \"Time Waits For No One\" and \"I Need You\" - though none were as rewarding as the group's first two hits. The Friends Of Distinction were also quite prolific in the production of LPs from 1969-1971, releasing 5 albums. Unfortunately for the group, the winds of change were beginning to develope in the mid-70s as popular music took a different direction and the \"Friends'\" fortunes declined. A grueling tour schedule and the lack of a hit for several years led the group to call it quits in 1975.\n\nThe Friends Of Distinction had a relatively short life in its original incarnation, but made some of the most memorable soul pop music of all time. In 1990, Elston and Butler decided to bring the \"Friends\" back together. Tragically, Butler died before the group reunion could be realized. Elson would then spend several years forming a new \"Friends\" group that currently tours and continues to entertain audiences nearly 40 years after the world first heard The Friends Of Distinction. Isn't it great that we can still hear their music in live concerts and of course on CDs including that all too familiar chorus from \"Grazing In The Grass\",\n\n\"I can dig it, he can dig it, she can dig it, we can dig it, they can dig it, you can dig it\n\nOh, let's dig it. Can you dig it, baby?\n\nI can dig it, he can dig it, she can dig it, we can dig it, they can dig it, you can dig it\n\nOh, let's dig it. Can you dig it, baby\"\n\nSociety's Child\n\n(The Biography of Janis Ian)\n\nJanis Ian, like the Oakland Raiders of the National Football League, is someone you either really like or dislike for her pointed handling of heretofore taboo/controversial topics through song. Her outspokenness on such subjects as interracial romance, incest, prostitution, homosexuality, etc. has made her both celebrated and decried by the American public over the years.\n\nHer career in music began at an early age growing up in New Jersey. When just 14 and waiting to meet with her school guidance counselor, Ian wrote and would soon record her first hit single, \"Society's Child (Baby I've Been Thinking)\" in June 1967. The song is a meditation about an interracial romance forbidden by a girl's mother and fro"
