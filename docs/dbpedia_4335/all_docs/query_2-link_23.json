        "text": "Happy Birthday Linda Ronstadt! Born on July 15, 1946, Linda is one of the greatest voices in Rock & Roll. It’s no secret that Linda is a favorite of ours in Miss Sydney & The Downtown Saints, and for good reason – simply put, she did it right! So today on her birthday, we feel it necessary to celebrate with her by recognizing some of the things we appreciate about Linda Ronstadt. So in no particular order, here are 3 reasons to celebrate Linda Ronstadt today.\n\nShe Could Sing Anything! – While she certainly had her own songs, some of her most popular songs (she’s had 21 top 40 hits) were her renditions of songs originally performed by others and it would instantly become her song. Probably the most famous example of this is her #1 hit You’re No Good from 1974. While the song had been performed earlier by the likes of Dee Dee Warwick and Betty Everett, it was Linda who made that song the hit that still dominates the airwaves and movie soundtracks to this day. One of my favorite examples of Linda making a song her own was her take on the Rolling Stones hit Tumbling Dice.\n\nShe valued performing with a band – Years before she was gracing the cover of Time Magazine, Linda started her music career in a band called The Stone Poneys in the 60’s. While she quickly emerged as she standout in the group, the name Linda Ronstadt quickly overshadowed the traditional band name. But that never stopped Linda from working as a group. As most people know, The Eagles were originally Linda’s band in the early 70s at the LA Troubadour scene. Note: Check out this video of Linda talking about those days. After the Eagles went out on their own, Linda fully supported them and she continued with heavy hitters including Andrew Gold , fellow Stone Poney, Kenny Edwards , and Waddy Wachtel (who also plays with Joe Walsh, Stevie Nicks, and more).\n\nShe is a fan of music – This may seem like a generic statement, but I think it’s the best way to describe how Linda sees things, even to this day. While her talent gave her celebrity status, she didn’t use that platform to turn into a diva, but rather as an opportunity for a fan of music to pursue what she could contribute. In most interviews she would always talk about other music that she likes instead of her own. After being diagnosed a few years ago with Parkinson’s disease, Linda gave a rare interview (watch it here) where she talked about current favorites including Alicia Keys, Sia, and the Carolina Chocolate Drops.\n\nHappy Birthday Linda Ronstadt from all of us in Miss Sydney & The Downtown Saints. With 30 albums, 21 Top 40 hits, 10 Grammys, and a membership in the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, we thank you for all the great music you have given us! You have inspired us by staying true to your talent and love for music. In the spirit of following your lead, here is our band’s take on “You’re No Good” as a humble 4-piece band."
