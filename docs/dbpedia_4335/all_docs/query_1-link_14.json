        "text": "Linda Ronstadt and Aaron Neville recorded four duets for her solo album Cry Like a Rainstorm - Howl Like the Wind in 1989. They were dubbed \"the First Couple of pop music.\"\n\n\"I think our singing together was meant to be. We have the same type of heart,\" Neville said.\n\nThe musicians reportedly dated from 1989 to 1992.\n\nLinda Ronstadt started dating famed director George Lucas in 1983 after the two met backstage at one of her concerts. However, they were both very private, and made sure to never be photographed together. It was rumored, however, that Ronstadt would carry an Empire Strikes Back lunchbox around Los Angeles as a playful nod to her boyfriend at the time.\n\nRonstadt even used the recording studios at Skywalker Ranch for her 1987 album, Canciones de Mi Padre. They got engaged at one point, though it was not to last. In 1988, the pair ended their romance after five years.\n\nLinda Ronstadt dated a young Jim Carrey in 1983, after meeting him at one of his performances at The Comedy Store in Los Angeles. She was looking for someone to open for her on tour - which Carrey did not want to do - though he did say he would go out with her if she wanted. And she did.\n\nThe two dated for about eight months, with Carrey later saying, \"She was an absolutely incredible human being. She is an incredible human being.\"\n\nLinda Ronstadt and politician Jerry Brown first met in 1971 at Lucy's El Adobe, a Mexican restaurant in Los Angeles. Their curious relationship made a Newsweek magazine cover in April 1979.\n\nIn April 1979, Ronstadt and Governor Brown famously took a trip to Africa together. The two were spotted together throughout the mid-late '70s and into the early '80s, after which things seemed to fizzle out. Ronstadt said she found him to be \"a relief\" from the musicians she hung out with. However, she doesn't believe they would have had a good marriage.\n\n\"Neither of us ever suffered under the delusion that we would like to share each other’s lives. I would have found his life too restrictive, and he would have found mine entirely chaotic… Eventually we went our separate ways and embraced things that resonated with us as different individuals… We have always remained on excellent terms,\" Ronstadt said.\n\nMick Jagger and Linda Ronstadt reportedly had an affair from 1977 to 1978.\n\nRonstadt recorded her won version of Rolling Stones song, \"Tumbling Dice.\" It was one of the few Rolling Stones covers to make it into the Top 10.\n\nTheir affair ended when Jagger's then-wife Bianca Jagger flew to California to confront him after she found out he was spending time with the country singer at her ocean-front home."
