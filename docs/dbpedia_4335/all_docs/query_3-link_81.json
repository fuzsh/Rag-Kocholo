        "text": "Friends, followers, and fellow melophiles, the time has come again.\n\nI’m listening to every entry on a list of 1,001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die. The list originates from a book, and a simple yet intuitive online generator serves me one album at random to rate and review each day.\n\nRecords are rated on a five-star scale, and all my reviews are creatively condensed into the cozy confines of one compact line.\n\nMuch like the one you just read.\n\n“Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication,” said Leonardo da Vinci, the original Renaissance man.\n\n“The ability to simplify means to eliminate the unnecessary so that the necessary may speak,” the painter Hans Hofmann once proclaimed.\n\n“Why waste time say lot word when few word do trick?” the wise philosopher Kevin Malone did pontificate.\n\nSo far, I’ve listened to 400 albums and written 400 one-line reviews.\n\nAs is tradition, I’m using this latest milestone as an excuse to reflect on the past hundred days of listening and put forward some perspective—backed by data—on those reflections.\n\nAnd I gotta tell ya, I’m feeling better than ever. Records 301–400 were rife with beautiful discoveries and reinvigorated revisits of some of my all-time favorite albums.\n\nIn fact, these past 100 albums made for my highest-rated group yet.\n\nCheck this out.\n\nIt’s…\n\nThe Star Count\n\nRecords 301–400\n\n5-Star Albums: 26\n\n4-Star Albums: 27\n\n3-Star Albums: 36\n\n2-Star Albums: 9\n\n1-Star Albums: 2\n\nA few eyebrow-raising findings to note here:\n\nThis is by far the highest number of 5-star albums per 100 I’ve yet had. My second highest was just 16.\n\nThe last 100 albums also garnered my highest number of 3-star ratings and my lowest number of 2-star ratings.\n\nMy average rating per 100 has consistently gone up group over group — from 3.33 across my first hundred to 3.46, 3.56, and now 3.66.\n\nThese three points illustrate how strong the last 100 days of listening truly have been, and they might also suggest a slight softening of my critical edge as I make my way through this experience.\n\nI’d reckon the two aren’t mutually exclusive.\n\nTotals After 400 Records\n\n5-Star Albums: 70\n\n4-Star Albums: 142\n\n3-Star Albums: 115\n\n2-Star Albums: 65\n\n1-Star Albums: 8\n\nThanks to Reddit user _Silent_Bob_ (a fellow 1,001 Albums participant and contributor to the project’s subreddit), I can dive deeper into my rating data through an intuitive dashboard designed to visually illustrate key insights.\n\nAnyone participating in this listening experience can do the same thing; just plug in your project name or shareable ID to access several visualized rating breakdowns sorted by artist, decade, genre, and more. My favorite component of this supplemental resource categorizes the user’s best and worst album streaks.\n\nAlbums 301–400 housed my best streaks of both five albums…\n\nBest 5-Album Streak\n\nAnd ten consecutive albums.\n\nBest 10-Album Streak\n\nFor those keeping track at home, my worst streaks of five and ten albums both occurred during my very first 100. So, again, all signs point to this 300 group being a positive outlier, and maybe, just maybe, I’m becoming less critical as I go.\n\nBut will the positive trend continue? I’m not so sure…\n\nIf I can offer a brief peek behind the curtain, I’m late writing this recap and have already put a small dent into the next 100 albums. While it’s far too early to call, the 400s are looking like they’ll be considerably weaker than the 300s.\n\nEvery high is followed by a comedown, I suppose.\n\nI’d wager the 300s will remain the highest-rated group by the time my next check-in drops, and I doubt I’ll be hitting 100 five-star records anytime soon (a milestone I’m greatly looking forward to).\n\nBut I’m open to being pleasantly surprised. I still have quite a ways to go, after all.\n\nAs I chip away at this list of albums, I find myself thinking more and more about legacy. The legacy of all these “important” bands and artists, yes, but also of the legacy inherent to my participation in this exercise.\n\nI’m more or less building a historical catalog of my taste in music. At least as it relates to these 1,001 albums, this opinionated document will always be tied to my name.\n\nThat name will forever be connected to, for example, a love of U2, OutKast, and the cymbal work of Stewart Copeland. When people hear the name Blake Matson Becker, they might be reminded of a distinct lack of patience for grunge or an uncommonly unfavorable opinion of a certain foursome from Liverpool.\n\nIt sounds slightly self-consumed, perhaps, but I don’t mean it that way. I just trip out on the thought that as more albums are listened to and as more reviews are logged, a more illuminating snapshot of my musical loves, likes, and dislikes materializes.\n\nSurrendering yourself to art opens you up to new experiences and fresh perspectives. To that point, this daily exercise continues to be a cherished meditative and therapeutic practice for me.\n\nI clear space to interact with a piece of art each day, and even if I don’t like it, the very act of making time to enter that headspace is teaching me more about music and culture, as well as the importance of mindfulness, and the vast variability of human expression.\n\nI guess what I’m trying to say is that I’m a sonic spirit in a musically material world, and I couldn’t keep these thoughts to myself if I tried. I’m thankful there are those willing to entertain my need to make a record of those thoughts.\n\nLet’s get on with it: my one-line reviews for records 301–400 are below, followed by a brief conclusion recapping the latest updates to my favorite genres and artists.\n\nEnjoy!\n\nAnd we’re back!\n\nWhat kind of impact did this latest batch of reviews have on the generator’s perception of my tastes? Let’s take a closer look.\n\nYep, this still checks out.\n\nLast time I took stock, jazz, funk, and hip hop topped my favorite genre spots. Now we’ve got soul barging in and bouncing hip hop to round out the trio. My list of least favorite genres remains unchanged.\n\nCharting the evolution of my favorite and worst genres is going to be one of the more interesting and tectonic aspects of these check-ins. Genre representation as well as straight-up mathematics will be the greatest factors in ultimately deducing what the generator makes of my musical profile.\n\nLet me break it down.\n\nOf my first 400 albums, 28 were considered jazz, only 19 were deemed funk, and 34 were identified as soul. The average ratings for these current favorite genres are, in the same order, 4.18, 4, and 3.89.\n\nTo give you a better understanding of the general genre representation included in this list (something I plan on diving much deeper into in future check-ins), an astounding 248 (!) albums have been placed in the rock or rock-and-roll buckets.\n\nYou see what I’m getting at here?\n\nDespite such imbalance and inequality, the records that are showing up for genres like jazz, funk, soul, and hip hop are showing up big as undeniable classics, with more than a handful of really solid records rounding out the offerings.\n\nMeanwhile, there have been countless mediocre or worse rock records watering down the iconic works of Jimi Hendrix, Led Zeppelin, and Black Sabbath, for example.\n\nThis seems as good a segue as any into the latest, substantial, update to my favorite and worst artists…\n\nBig changes here! Only Miles, Hendrix, and Zeppelin populated my list of favorite artists last time around.\n\nJoin me in extending a warm welcome to U2 (my all-time favorite band), Joy Division, Can, OutKast, Funkadelic, and David Bowie as they enter my music taste’s hallowed hall of fame.\n\nThat’s a 200% increase in residency. Impressive!\n\nThese nine artists have generated 28 albums, and 25 achieved a perfect 5-star rating. Most impressive!\n\nAs for the bands on the other end of my taste spectrum, those lovable (a relative term) bowl-cut lads were kind enough to join Nirvana down in the watery depths of my worst artists. Misery loves company, I guess.\n\nThis feels right. This feels just. I may be in the vast minority, but Nirvana and The Beatles are most definitely the bands I’m most averse to. And it’s not even that deep; I just don’t dig these dudes. These aversions are exacerbated by the universal love they garner, no doubt.\n\nWith these high-profile dislikes out of the way, I don’t anticipate my worst artists list will be growing anytime soon. I’ve only handed out eight 1-star ratings across 400 albums, and no other band or artist (save for maybe someone like Drake, but I doubt he’ll be making an appearance on this list) draws as much ire from me.\n\nAnd with that, we come to the conclusion of another certified 1,001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die check-in. By the time we next meet, I’ll be gearing up to cross the halfway mark of my listening and writing marathon.\n\nAs always, thanks for tagging along.\n\nDon’t feel like waiting to read my thoughts?
