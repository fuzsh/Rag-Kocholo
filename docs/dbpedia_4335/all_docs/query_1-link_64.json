Supported by a superb backing band, Tristan’s formidable vocal talent and stage presence will transport you to a time when Linda Ronstadt ruled the airwaves as one of the most popular female vocalists in music history. The Linda Ronstadt Experience takes you on a Musical Journey of Chart Topping Smash Hits, “You’re No Good”, “When Will I Be Loved”, “That’ll Be The Day”, “Blue Bayou” and many more classic hits by Jackson Brown, Elvis Costello, Tom Petty, Neil Young, Warren Zevon, The Rolling Stones, and Little Feat to name a few!\n\nThe Linda Ronstadt Experience with American Idol Star Tristan McIntosh is the premier touring tribute band showcasing the songs that Linda Ronstadt made famous. The show takes you on a musical journey of smash hit songs, including “You’re No Good,” “When Will I Be Loved,” “That’ll Be the Day,” and a particularly delicate, nuanced interpretation of “Blue Bayou,” among many more. To convey the majesty and impact of McIntosh’s powerful vocal quality is hard to put into words. She exudes poise and grace, with a delivery both electrifying and subtle, by turns. Tristan brings the original singer’s version stunningly alive through her own artful touch. A sea of listeners throughout a theater can often be heard quietly singing along at the summit of “You’re No Good,” drawing out that famous, 8-second vowel. The LRE show is touring widely, and becoming ever more popular, earning increasingly sold-out houses. Catch them when—not if—you can. It’s a shining experience that will buoy your days to come.\n\nPresented by Count Basie Center for the Arts"
