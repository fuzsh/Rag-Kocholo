The Simon & Garfunkel singer-songwriter reprised his dual role three more times, including with co-host actress Catherine Oxenberg in season 11. During his hosting gigs, Simon shared the musical stage with the likes of George Harrison, Ladysmith Black Mambazo, and Linda Ronstadt. He has served as musical guest an additional nine times—an SNL record—including as recently as 2018.\n\n02 of 47\n\nLily Tomlin\n\nDouble duty dates: Nov. 22, 1975; Jan. 22, 1983\n\nComedy queen Lily Tomlin first toplined SNL for the show's sixth episode, singing with Howard Shore & the All Nurse Band. Tomlin hosted again in season 2, but this time she left all the singing to James Taylor.

Garfunkel, was joined by co-musical guest Stephen Bishop on \"Wonderful World,\" and performed \"All I Know,\" \"Scarborough Fair,\" and \"Crying in My Sleep\" himself.\n\n07 of 47\n\nThe Rolling Stones\n\nDouble duty date: Oct. 7, 1978\n\nThe Rolling Stones—yes, the entive band—fronted by Mick Jagger, opened SNL's 4th season as both the night's host and musical guest. The group rocked out to a medley of their songs, including \"Beast of Burden\" and \"Shattered.\"\n\n08 of 47\n\nFrank Zappa\n\nDouble duty date: Oct. 21, 1978\n\nFrank Zappa appeared as a musical guest in season 2, but when he returned for hosting and music duty two years later, things didnt go so well. The episode is remembered as largely a disaster in which Zappa made a point of telling the audience he was reading off cue cards, and his added unpopularity with the cast and crew reportedly got him banned from SNL. Zappa never appeared on the show again before he died in 1993.\n\n09 of 47\n\nRicky Nelson\n\nDouble duty date: Feb. 17, 1979\n\nThe actor and former teen heartthrob fronted SNL in season 4, parodying his TV sitcom image with sketches spoofing The Twilight Zone, I Love Lucy, and more. He was also the musical guest, along with Judy Collins, and performed the songs \"Hello Mary Lou,\" \"Travelin' Man,\" \"Fools Rush In,\" and \"Dream Lover.\"\n\n10 of 47\n\nGary Busey\n\nDouble duty date: March 10, 1979\n\nWhen Gary Busey hosted, the Buddy Holly actor performed a percussion solo in his monologue and later sang \"Stay All Night.\" The other musical guests for the episode were Gregory Hines and Eubie Blake.\n\n11 of 47\n\nDebbie Harry\n\nDouble duty date: Feb. 14, 1981\n\nCredited as Deborah Harry, the Blondie lead singer hosted SNL's Valentine's Day episode during the program's sixth season. She took over musical duties, singing \"Love TKO\" and \"Come Back Jonee\" before joining group Funky 4 + 1 More in a performance of \"That's The Joint,\" becoming the first hip hop song to ever be played on television.\n\n12 of 47\n\nOlivia Newton-John\n\nDouble duty date: May 22, 1982\n\nGrease star Olivia Newton-John led the sketch series during a season 7 episode, in which she also performed songs from her Physical album, including the hit titular track.\n\n13 of 47\n\nStevie Wonder\n\nDouble duty date: May 7, 1983\n\nDuring his turn as host and musical guest in season 8, Stevie Wonder appeared in sketches with Eddie Murphy, who often played the singer on the show. Wonder took to the piano to sing \"Fingertips,\" \"Overjoyed,\" and \"Go Home.\"\n\n14 of 47\n\nWillie Nelson\n\nDouble duty date: Feb. 21, 1987\n\nWillie Nelson took the stage as host and musical guest during the show's 12th season. The singer, then 53, performed three of his own songs, in addition to the goofy \"The Boyfriend Song,\" with some help from cast member Victoria Jackson. The country legend also appeared as musical guest in 1977 and 1993.\n\n15 of 47\n\nDolly Parton\n\nDouble duty date: April 15, 1989\n\nActress and country star Dolly Parton hosted in season 14, months before the release of Steel Magnolias. Parton's ample bosom proved to be a big focus point on the show as the camera zoomed in on her chest from above during the monologue, and she played a prisoner in a sketch called \"Planet of the Enormous Hooters.\" Parton performed songs from her 1989 album White Limozeen, including the title track and \"Why'd You Come in Here Lookin' Like That.\"\n\n16 of 47\n\nQuincy Jones\n\nDouble duty date: Feb. 10, 1990\n\nQuincy Jones took on the hosting and musical gig in season 15.

Dooinit.\"\n\n17 of 47\n\nSting\n\nDouble duty date: Jan. 19, 1991\n\nSting has been a musical guest four separate times, but during the show's 16th season, the Police frontman pulled double duty as host and musical performer. His performance was a bit lackluster and when he returend to host again in 1997 he handed over official musical duty to Veruca Salt, although he did end us singing a rendition of \"My One & Only Love.\"\n\n18 of 47\n\nM.C. Hammer\n\nDouble duty date: Dec. 7, 1991\n\nM.C. Hammer, who was credited as simply Hammer on the show, hosted a season 17 episode. During his monologue, he awkwardly refered to himself in the third person, and as a sketch performer, he was noticeably stiff, but at least loosened up to perform \"2 Legit 2 Quit\" and The Addams Family theme \"Addams Groove,\" which would go on to win the Razzie Award for Worst Original Song.\n\n19 of 47\n\nDeion Sanders\n\nDouble duty date: Feb. 18, 1995\n\nAlthough Bon Jovi was the official musical guest of the episode, NFL star Deion Sanders also took the stage between sketches to perform two tracks from his 1994 rap album Prime Time. Both Sanders' music and his comedy skills were not well received.\n\n20 of 47\n\nGarth Brooks\n\nDouble duty dates: Feb. 28, 1998; Nov. 13, 1999\n\nCountry star Garth Brooks first appeared as a musical guest in 1992 alongside host John Goodman before returning later in the decade to juggle dual roles two years in a row—with a twist. During his first hosting gig, he came out to perform his standard fare, including his country hit \"Two Piña Coladas,\" but when he returned the next year, Brooks took the musical stage as his alt-rock alter ego Chris Gaines instead.\n\n21 of 47\n\nBritney Spears\n\nDouble duty dates: May 13, 2000; Feb. 2, 2002\n\nBritney Spears' very first appearance on SNL was as both host and musical guest in seasons 25 when she was just 19 years old, and she hit us one more time by reprising her dual in season 27, joined for her monologue by then-boyfriend Justin Timberlake, who would go on to become a fan-favorite SNL host himself. Spears popped up again to sing in 2003, but left the hosting duties to Halle Berry that time.\n\n22 of 47\n\nJennifer Lopez\n\nDouble duty dates: Feb. 10, 2001; Feb. 27, 2010\n\nAfter playing musical guest in an Alan Cumming-hosted season 25 episode, Jennifer Lopez returned the next season, just after release of The Wedding Planner, to do it all herself. And almost exactly 9 years later, Jenny returned to the block to pull double duty again in season 35.\n\n23 of 47\n\nJustin Timberlake\n\nDouble duty dates: Oct. 11, 2003; Dec. 16, 2006; March 9, 2013\n\nJustin Timberlake is a member of SNL's illustrious Five-Timers Club (those who have hosted the show five or more times), but he's done the difficult job of playing his own musical guest three times—just one appearance short of Paul Simon's record. Although, on one of his host-only shows, Timberlake did perfrom \"Love Sex Magic\" with musical guest Ciara. He's also served as musical guest on two episodes that he didn't host, once with NSYNC and once solo. And that's not counting all the times he's performed in digital shorts with The Lonely Island, harmonized as Robin Gibb to Jimmy Fallon's Barry Gibb, and, of course, his recurring singing mascot sketches. Bring it on down to icon-ville!\n\n24 of 47\n\nJanet Jackson\n\nDouble duty date: April 10, 2004\n\nJust two months after the infamous Super Bowl Halftime Show in which Justin Timberlake tore off Janet Jackson's shirt, exposing one of her breasts, Jackson bravely made another go at live TV to host and perform during a season 29 episode. She reprised her childhood role of Penny on Good Times in one sketch, and did impressions of Condoleezza Rice and Paula Abdul in others. For her musical performances, she rocked out to her songs \"Strawberry Bounce\" and \"All Nite (Don't Stop).\" Prior, Jackson was the musical guest in 1994.\n\n25 of 47\n\nQueen Latifah\n\nDouble duty date: Oct. 9, 2004\n\nThe effortlessly cool Queen Latifah was the emcee of the night during SNL's 30th season to help promote her movie Taxi with Jimmy Fallon (who left the SNL cast a few months earlier). She later jammed to her songs, \"The Same Love That Made Me Laugh\" and \"Hard Times.\"\n\n26 of 47\n\nLudacris\n\nDouble duty date: Nov. 18, 2006\n\nDuring season 32, rapper Ludacris graced the Studio 8H stage to host and perform \"Money Maker\" and \"Runaway Love,\" with an assist from Mary J. Blige.\n\n27 of 47\n\nTaylor Swift\n\nDouble duty date: Nov. 7, 2009\n\nTaylor Swift is no stranger to SNL having made three turns as musical guest. But in season 35, the songstress showed her \"Fearless\" range by doing double duty as host, showing off impersonations of Kate Gosselin, holding her own alongside SNL stars like Bill Hader, Kristen Wiig, and Andy Samberg, and performoing \"You Belong With Me\" and \"Untouchable.\"\n\n28 of 47\n\nElton John\n\nDouble duty date: April 2, 2011\n\nNearly 30 years after appearing as a musical guest, Elton John returned during SNL's 36th season where he quipped \"The bitch is back!\" The show's star wattage maxed out that night, as Tom Hanks, Jake Gyllenhaal, Carmelo Anthony, and more made cameos in the episode. Then, with help from Leon Russell, John performed \"Hey Ahab\" and \"Monkey Suit.\"\n\n29 of 47\n\nMick Jagger\n\nDouble duty date: May 19, 2012\n\nDecades after the Rolling Stones hosted and performed as a band, frontman Mick Jagger returned to 30 Rock to carry the season 37 finale on his own. During his musical performances, he was joined on stage by rockers like Arcade Fire, Foo Fighters, and Jeff Beck.\n\n30 of 47\n\nBruno Mars\n\nDouble duty date: Oct. 20, 2012\n\nBruno Mars has wowed as a musical guest, but he made an even more impressive turn as both host and performer during season 38, showing off a dizzying array of musical impersonations, serenading the audience with \"Locked Out of Heaven\" and \"Young Girls,\" and, most importantly, portraying the down-on-his-luck Times Square mascot in the beautifully weird \"Sad Mouse\" video short.\n\n31 of 47\n\nJustin Bieber\n\nDouble duty date: Feb. 9, 2012\n\nThree years after serving as musical guest, Justin Bieber returned to SNL to do double duty during a season 38 episode, but his appearance had some harsh critics, including two former cast members. Bill Hader and Jay Pharaoh named the Canadian heartthrob as the worst guest host they'd worked with. The Barry star noted that Bieber came with a 20-man posse that made it impossible to move around backstage.\n\n32 of 47\n\nMiley Cyrus\n\nDouble duty dates: Oct. 5, 2013; Oct. 3, 2015\n\nMiley Cyrus has carried the show as combined host and musical twice. In her many appearances on the show over the years, which also include separate hosting and performing duties, the \"Wrecking Ball\" singer has busted out impressions of Hillary Clinton, Justin Bieber, Lindsay Lohan, and more.\n\n33 of 47\n\nLady Gaga\n\nDouble duty date: Nov. 16, 2013\n\nLady Gaga can do it all, so serving as both host and musical guest on an episode of SNL was no different. The pop star wowed with her powerful vocals and proved that she can laugh at herself, which made for a strong show.\n\n34 of 47\n\nDrake\n\nDouble duty dates: Jan. 18, 2014; May 14, 2016\n\nRapper, actor, and ... comedian? Drake killed it in his two appearances in which he fulfilled both hosting and musical duties. Not many could pull off playing Lil Wayne playing Steve Urkel, but the Degrassi alum proved his impressive chops.\n\n35 of 47\n\nBlake Shelton\n\nDouble duty date: Jan. 24, 2015\n\nDuring this season 40 episode, musician Blake Shelton led a night that heavily leaned on his country roots. The singer and The Voice mentor regaled the audience with his songs \"Neon Light\" and \"Boys 'Round Here,\" as well as a hilarious musical sketch about a \"Wishin' Boot.\"\n\n36 of 47\n\nAriana Grande\n\nDouble duty date: March 12, 2016\n\nIf you didn't know it by now, Ariana Grande is the queen of musical impressions. In this season 41 episode, the \"Dangerous Woman\" songstress was a machine, churning out spot-on impersonations of Jennifer Lawrence, Britney Spears, Celine Dion, and Shakira. Sadly, after her failed engagement to current SNL cast member Pete Davidson, it may be awhile before Grande is back on stage at Studio 8H.\n\n37 of 47\n\nDonald Glover\n\nDouble duty date: May 5, 2018\n\nDonald Glover brought along his Childish Gambino alter ego for this season 43 episode, and they were both exceptional—from the hilarious \"Friendos\" and \"A Kanye Place\" sketches, to the outstanding musical performances, the night was a hit with audiences.\n\n38 of 47\n\nHalsey\n\nDouble duty date: Feb. 9, 2019\n\nAlthough this season 44 episode was just so-so, Halsey stood out. She was game for anything as a sketch performer, and her musical performances of \"Without Me\" and \"Eastside\" were the most memorable parts of the night (who else has painted a full portrait while singing?).\n\n39 of 47\n\nChance the Rapper\n\nDouble duty date: Oct. 26, 2019\n\nAfter two stints as musical guest and one episode hosting while Eminem served as the night's musical entertainment, Chance the Rapper returned to do it all for the season 45 Halloween episode.\n\n40 of 47\n\nHarry Styles\n\nDouble duty date: Nov. 16, 2019\n\nHarry Styles pulled double duty for his hosting debut. Although it was his first time steering the ship, the show marked Styles' fifth time as musical guest, including three times as a member of boy band One Direction and twice as a solo artist.\n\n41 of 47\n\nNick Jonas\n\nDouble duty date: Feb. 27, 2021\n\nNick Jonas joined the club in an episode that marked his first turn hosting the show and fourth time as musical guest. The singer-actor previously performed twice alongside siblings Joe and Kevin as part of the Jonas Brothers, and once as a solo act in a 2016 episode hosted by Julia Louis-Dreyfus.\n\n42 of 47\n\nBillie Eilish\n\nDouble duty date: Dec. 11, 2021\n\nBillie Eilish made her Saturday Night Live hosting debut on Dec. 11, making her the first host to be born in the 21st century. She was previously the musical guest for the season 45 premiere of Saturday Night Live and she performed \"Bad Guy\" (in a rotating set) and \"I Love You.\"\n\n43 of 47\n\nLizzo\n\nDouble duty date: April 16, 2022\n\nA couple years after serving as musical guest during Eddie Murphy's triumphant return, Lizzo made her hosting debut playing her own musical guest on the April 16, 2022 episode. The Grammy winner put her singing and flute-playing to use during several sketches, and looked like she was having a good as hell time throughout. \"Ladies and gentlemen, me,\" she said, introducing herself before her first musical performance of the night (something both Chance the Rapper and Justin Timberlake did as well), with her mother sweetly doing the honors for her next song.\n\n44 of 47\n\nMegan Thee Stallion\n\nDouble duty date: Oct. 15, 2022\n\nAfter a previous stint as musical guest, Megan Thee Stallion turned SNL into a hot girl show of her own in season 48, with a highly energetic hosting turn.\n\n45 of 47\n\nJack Harlow\n\nDouble duty date: Oct. 29, 2022\n\nJack Harlow did double duty a year after making his musical debut on the show. The season 48 Halloween episode also saw the return of Tom Hanks' beloved David S. Pumpkins character.\n\n46 of 47\n\nBad Bunny\n\nDouble duty date: Oct. 21, 2023\n\nBad Bunny made his musical guest debut in a February 2021 episode in which he also popped up in a couple sketches. The music superstar and Cassandro actor made enough of an impression that he was invited back to fill both host and musical guest spots on an episode packed with celebrity cameos, including Pedro Pascal, Mick Jagger, Lady Gaga, and Fred Armisen."
