        "text": "While Paul Wendell Obis is a great musician and has been heard on many open mic nights, he's also a funny guy. I'm not kidding. :) Luckily, there's a new residency in town, and it's all because Paul has brought his comedic talents to Friendly's stage, and each show features other local comedians who are sure to give audiences some hearty laughter. Paul says, \"The next comedy night is July 30th and features Andrew Frank, who is hysterical. I think he has a bright future ahead. This will be one not to miss.\"\n\nSo mark your calendars and get ready to bust a gut.. Sunday, 7/30 @ 8:00 pm.\n\n​You are a musician and a comedian. How did you get started in each role?\n\nI got started in music at a very young age. I took cello lessons from the age of two and did that until I became a teenager, but I didn't think cello was rock and roll enough, so I started playing drums and guitar. Comedy started a few years back when I decided I was tired of lugging instruments around. I'm not very good at singing, so I decided, \"Hey, what if I could just show up to shows and talk to people?\" So, really, it was started out of sheer laziness. But honestly, I've always been fascinated by comedy, and I started doing it a few years ago, and found it to be a total rush. It's impossible not to feel alive and present when you're holding a mic in front of a room full of people who want to laugh.\n\nWho are your influences?\n\nI love artists who are multifaceted. I remember learning for the first time that Dave Grohl was not only one of the best rock and roll drummers, but also a prolific songwriter and funny, affable guy. I also like Maynard James Keenan, who is one of the all time great rock singers, but is also a skilled wine maker, has multiple successful bands, and is also very funny. I think, to kids sometimes, there is a false belief that successful people are just very good at that one thing you know them for, when really, more often the case is that\n\nyour favorite musician is probably also a chef, loves bird watching, is great at chess, and loves ballet.\n\nWhat’s your favorite part of performing in front of a live crowd?\n\nI love doing fun stage banter in between songs. I think it can keep an audience engaged during what is normally the boring part of a show. So even if I'm drumming or playing guitar in a band, you'll probably get a good dose of comedy mixed in as well.\n\nWhat’s something surprising about you?\n\nI was so obsessed with Mr. Rogers Neighborhood when I was little, that my Dad did an interview with him for his magazine Vegetarian Times, and they became best friends, so I grew up knowing one of my idols right from the very start.\n\nWhat brought you to the Friendly Music Community?\n\nI've been going to open mic night at Friendly for over 10 years. There's a story about a polka player, a turtle neck sweater that I was wearing, and scissors that I would tell here, but it is better told over a beer.\n\nWhat can the audience expect from your next comedy night?\n\nFor the next comedy night, there is an extremely funny guy named Andrew Frank. He is doing a full hour, which is always an impressive feat to see. We will have a couple openers, do quick 10 minute sets as well. I am the MC and will tell a zinger or two. It's been amazing to witness the reaction that comedy night gets in the big room at Friendly. The comics and crowd seem to have the time of their lives with it. It's almost like the big room was built to be a comedy club.\n\nCheck out Paul Obis in \"Milkdud MacKenzie\"-\n\nhttps://milkdudmackenzie.bandcamp.com/album/milkdud-mackenzie\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/MkdudMac\n\nDOWD & DREW, the newest residency at Friendly Tap, play every second Thursday. Combined, this duo has performed with more musicians than one can count, and there's a reason for that... they're charismatic and gifted! With music running through their blood since birth, Gerald Dowd and Rachel Drew bring profundity and flair to whatever genre they choose. Here's a brief dialogue to get a glimpse into what they're all about:\n\n* How did you get started in music?\n\nRACHEL DREW:Singing with my family. My parents were in the folk scene in Chicago as teenagers. I was born while they were still in college. Growing up, music was just all over the house, all around me. My mom would make up songs for everything we'd do. There was an elaborate pirate song for bath time, her own creation. Lots of \"Y'aarrrs\" and \"Mateys\" and threats to spit in my eye. Her songs were always funny. My parents were very young, and things didn't always go so smoothly, but there was joy inside of music. I learned that from them.\n\nI've been singing for as long as I can remember, and I was singing harmony with my folks quite early - age 5 or 6. To this day, singing harmony feels like home. When I was a teen, I got involved in musicals at school, and even got to sing lead in Oberlin College's disco orchestra (our biggest gig was being the headliner for Oberlin's cross-dressing Drag Ball... MTV News showed up to film us, but the segment never aired as it was preempted by the breakup of Soundgarden). I had a world music radio show on WOBC at Oberlin, and got deeply into old R&B and jazz standards around that time. I used to say Ray Charles helped me through those years. And though I was always singing, and listening, and always making up melodies, it wasn't until my 30s that I began playing guitar or writing my own songs. And it was even more years until I started playing these songs in public.\n\nSo, for me, it was a slow start to go public, but I was always doing music, or part of it somehow. It's been supremely joyful to find other people to make music with over the past few years.\n\nGERALD DOWD: My family has always been musically active: lots of singing, listening, with cello and piano hobbyists abounding. We were all forced to take piano and violin, both of which bored me to tears. So when the opportunity presented itself for me to finally pick the most annoying instrument possible, I asked for a drum when I was 10. And have now been annoying people for almost 40 years.\n\n* Who were your influences?\n\nGERALD DOWD: Too many influences to list individually, but I will now attempt to do just that: The Beatles (duh) are the first band I remember really making an impact on me. I used to have dreams with their music as the soundtrack. My brothers had what I thought was the coolest taste in music, so I scavenged their Billy Joel, Aerosmith and The Cars records often. But nothing had a bigger impact on me than my Steve Martin records -- still music to my ears! My dad (a real-life 'Mad Men' character in the '60s) loved jazz (from whence my Buddy Rich fetish sprung) and bluegrass/country (Tom T. Hall, Roger Miller and Charlie Rich were his, and then my, favorites) and my El Salvadorian mom loved classical and Latin American music. The five records to which I routinely played along in high school: The Who - \"Who's Next\" ; Circle Jerks - \"Group Sex\"; Peter Tosh - \"Legalize It\"; Led Zeppelin - \"Coda\" or \"Houses Of The Holy\"; Elvis Costello's \"Punch The Clock\"\n\nCollege unearthed more gems (James Brown, Metallica, Fishbone, Public Enemy, avant-garde jazz and classical) and even more missteps (horrifying pictures of Dave Weckl's '80s haircut).\n\nRACHEL DREW: Oh, this will be an incomplete list, but off the top of my head: Ella Fitzgerald, Linda Ronstadt, Nat King Cole, Willie Nelson, The Kinks, Otis Redding, Doc Watson, Hank Williams, Ruth Brown, Ray Charles, Gladys Knight, and, of course, The Beatles.\n\n* How do you describe your style?\n\nRACHEL DREW: I've got a big voice, but I feel like singing is painting, and so I've got to be ready to use different brushes, which I do - so my voice is not always big. Singing is spreading truth, and sometimes the emotional truth needs to be a very fine line. My style is varied, but if left to my own devices, I go pretty bluesy. For the songs I write, they almost always begin with melody. It's rare for me to start with chords or riffing on the guitar. I'll get a clear melody in my head, and sometimes the ideas for instrumentation come at the same time, and sometimes lines come at the same - but I consider the melody to be the soul of any of my songs. I try not to alter whatever the spark melody is, or even change the key, and the ideal is to let the song grow around that.\n\nGERALD DOWD: A broad, mature, reverential but original style encompassing many different flavors and textures, filled with subtle yet knowing nods to musicians and genres both current and bygone. Songs where the lyric and melody rule above all else, and which will make you smile, laugh, dance...and think.\n\nCASUAL LISTENER: \"An acquired taste.\"\n\n* What's your favorite part of performing?\n\nGERALD DOWD: Watching people dance and/or sing along, and otherwise enjoy the hell out of themselves without yelling requests at us while we're playing. Or in the case of the gig where I met my wife: watching someone mouth every single word of every single song from memory, while mournfully pulling on a cigarette and looking bored near to tears. What kinda mind-game IS that?!?\n\nRACHEL DREW: There are so many things. I love music, but I also love being part of something bigger than myself, and something that surrounds and includes everyone in the room. Music is full of feeling, and sometimes you can actually feel, while performing, that the song is resonating for someone else listening for the first time, hitting them in a certain way. The song about my grandmother becomes the song about their grandmother, etc. I'm still surprised by moments in song. Just last week at Friendly Tap, in the middle of singing \"I Never Would,\" I felt like I was actually inside of a record for a minute, like I'd become Dionne Warwick, or 1970s me. It was a strange, transcendental moment of sublime something. How did that happen? I don't know. So there's this continual opening up and connection in performance, and that's exciting, too.\n\n​* What's something surprising about you?\n\nRACHEL DREW:Hmm. I'm not sure. I'm pretty open about everything. Maybe that's surprising. I almost never lie, not even when it's a good idea or convenient. I feel like my head is too full, and lying is too hard. I'd never be able to keep track of anything. But there was one time, years ago, that I was getting rung up to pay at the grocery store. It was basic small talk. I said I was tired, then muttered something like, \"Kids...\" At the time, I only had one kid (I now have two). The cashier asked how many kids I had, and I lied and said I had six. I was so shocked (at myself). Anyway, I went home and told my husband I'd lied about how many kids we had, so then we named the other five that didn't exist. They all got names like \"Runaway\" and \"Cartwheel\" and \"Ju-Vee.\"\n\nGERALD DOWD: I do actually sit quietly and not speak for long stretches of time. I also do a fairly believable Ted Knight impression.\n\n* What brought you to the Friendly Music Community?\n\nRACHEL DREW:I've played Friendly Tap several times with Peter Joly's trio (with Jon Williams and Josh Piet, and once with Andon Davis and Maggie Dahlberg). Peter has a Sunday residency, so playing with Peter is how I got to know the space. I sang with him at the Friendly Folk Festival last year, and that's when I met Sally Hanson. She was so welcoming. When Gerald and I were looking for a place to do a duo show a few months back, I naturally thought of Friendly Tap, and Sally received us with open arms. Rob Pierce has been amazingly welcoming since we began, and we're so happy to be on Molly Hanrahan's night. Friendly Tap is a very special place. It's very unusual to find a place and community so welcoming to and supportive of its musicians.\n\nGERALD DOWD:\n\n1. Alcohol\n\n2. I had hung out as a civilian many times at the Friendly, and of course loved it because deep down I'm really just a 75-year-old boozehound. I'd always WANTED to play there, but my independent booking game is so weak, son! Anyway, Friendly was at the top of our list when Rachel and I were thinking of places to set up this residency, and we're thrilled it's actually happening.\n\n3. Alcohol\n\n* What can the audience expect from your new residency?\n\nGERALD DOWD:Country-soul-rock-jazz-influenced originals and covers played with a hotshit (or 'world-class', if 'hotshit' is inappropriate) (or leave this whole paragraph as is, if that's funniest) band that we're positive you'll really enjoy, or your money back.\n\n​RACHEL DREW:So far we're lucky enough to have gotten some of the best musicians in Chicago, and maybe the world, to play with us once a month: Larry Brown, Dave Nelson, Josh Piet, Scott Stevenson. We're doing mostly originals, but also some covers. I think you can expect a deepening and opening up of all the songs we've been doing, and you can also expect us to be trying on some variety. It'll be exciting and different each time, and a lot of fun.\n\nHere's the music that turned me into a fan:\n\nRachel Drew and the Bitter Roots - \"Under the Sun\"\n\nGerald Dowd - \"Home Now\"\n\n(Worth a listen: WXRT Local Anesthetic interview, 11/02/2014, with Gerald Dowd)\n\nAccording to their press release, \"Alan Bresloff of Around the Town Chicago has called the music of Tank and the Beez 'well-done' and 'stirring.' The duo’s timeless vocals and unassuming instrumentation harken back to the musicians and music of old-time radio.\"\n\nBeth “Beez” Blankenship (lead vocals and guitar) and husband Brian “Tank” Blankenship (upright bass and backing vocals) are sure to be a new sensation in the community. As Oak Park residents, the Friendly Tap welcomes this local, dynamic couple and looks forward to showcasing the sound of an era that will never be lost as long as Tank and the Beez take the stage.\n\n* How did you get started in music?\n\nTank started taking piano lessons back in grade school which led to playing in the symphony and marching band in high school. He played in several rock cover bands through his teens and early twenties, mostly on keyboards and some form of vocals.\n\nBeez grew up singing with her siblings and father, who is a church Musical Director and plays in a sixties rock and roll cover band. She performed in choirs, musicals, and operas throughout high school and college, where she studied Music Therapy.\n\n* Who were your influences?\n\nOur biggest musical influence is definitely The Beatles. Even though their songs are a little more modern than the music we play, we think our appreciation still comes through in our musicality, especially in our original songs.\n\nOther influences include Bessie Smith, WC Handy, Leadbelly, and more recently, Leon Redbone.\n\n* How do you describe your style?\n\nAmerican Roots and Americana. But when people don't know what that means, we usually just say early folk and jazz.\n\n* What's your favorite part of performing?\n\nThe looks on peoples' faces when they realize that they've heard a song before. Folks tend to think they don't know any music from the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. We like helping people realize that these songs are the precursors of virtually all modern American music.\n\n​\n\n* What's something surprising about you?\n\nMost people from our day job are surprised to find out that we're musicians. So, audience members might be surprised to know that, outside of the band, we're married and work together at a non-profit that assists people with disabilities.\n\n* What brought you to the Friendly Music Community?\n\nWe were looking for venues in and around Chicago that work with smaller acoustic acts. Our first experience with the venue was a Boozeday Tuesday with Ian Leith, and we immediately felt at home at Friendly Tap. The patrons are supportive and the staff is warm and welcoming.\n\n* What can the audience expect from your Dec. 16 show?\n\nWe've been playing as a duo for the past four years, so this show is an exciting opportunity for us to work with a full, four-piece band. Tommy and Amy Malouf (below) are incredibly talented musicians from the Chicagoland area who will be playing a couple of solo tunes before sitting in with Tank & the Beez. Audience members can expect high-energy music, tight harmonies, and some old-fashioned, family fun.\n\nA Fan's Two Cents: Every now and again, you meet people and think that there's something unique about them. It could be the ease of conversation, the connection of spirit, or simply, the likability of the individuals themselves. That's how I felt about Tank and the Beez from the start, but when hearing them live, their specialness deepened. Their calling to this music genre (late 19th/early 20th century roots music) is undeniable, as they capture a time and place many musicians strive to accomplish but miss the mark. In this case, Tank's Americana ear and Beez's vocal perfection blend in such a way that I call it transporting. And their joy for the music they play? It's contagious. So come on out and get ready to smile, to be \"stirred,\" and to experience a special show!\n\nTo learn more about Tank and the Beez, check out their website: tankandthebeez.com\n\nand their YouTube Channel.\n\nBut first, treat yourself by taking a listen to\n\n​\"Hard Times Come Again No More\" (1854, Written by Stephen Collins Foster).\n\n​Peter Joly comes to Friendly Tap every 3rd Sunday, and I remember the first time I had the opportunity to hear him play. I planned on recording a song or two for the FMC YouTube channel and then taking off, but I got so wrapped up in the beauty of his music, I never pressed the record button on my camera. As it turned out, I returned the following month for a video clip, and I've had great admiration for this singer/songwriter ever since. Needless to say, I'm overjoyed to profile Peter Joly for this month's musician spotlight. Enjoy!\n\nHow did you get started in music? I’ve always felt a special connection to music; like it was in my DNA. When I was 9 or 10 years old, I was fascinated by this young folk musician, I don’t even recall his name, who played old folk tunes and children’s songs on TV each morning. He had this local PBS show in Buffalo, NY where I grew up. He’d walk around this TV farm playing guitar and singing songs. I’d fake being sick just to stay home from school and watch this guy. Then one Sunday morning, out of the blue, a guitar teacher showed up on our front porch. My mother had hired him to give me private lessons at home. She hadn’t even told me about him. Mr. Abrams. He was a very big man, old, with a big cowboy hat, Levis jacket, cowboy boots and bolo tie. During our lessons he’d keep time by pounding his booted foot so hard on our dining room floor that the whole room shook. He became affectionately known by my family as “The Foot”. He became my teacher for at least 6 years. All formative ones, he gave me the perfect foundation to build upon.\n\nThe only guitar we had in the house was so inadequate that all that was holding it together was white masking tape wrapped around its body. I played that piece of junk for over a year until one Sunday, Mr. Abrams showed up to our lesson with an old Harmony arch top with a couple crack repairs that he had found at a garage sale. He said, “You need a real guitar. Here you go, you owe me $65 bucks”. I still have and play that guitar. I wrote my first song on that guitar. I was in 8th grade I think, and the song was horrible!\n\nWho were your influences? Songwriters. My first concert experience was Neil Young, solo at Buffalo Memorial Auditorium. I was a freshman in high school. It was the most beautiful thing I had ever heard. I learned the whole Walking Man record by James Taylor. I had gotten good at listening to a song on a record over and over; lifting the needle and setting it back down in the same spot a hundred times until I could match what the guitar on the record was doing. That’s how I learned to finger pick.\n\nThen in high school I discovered a whole array of amazing songwriters: Cat Stevens, Joni Mitchell, Dr. John, Gordon Lightfoot, Elvis Costello, Joan Armatrading- I was knocked out by her stuff for over a year or so. My high school pals were walking around with Van Halen under their arms while I was toting “Show Some Emotion”. There was this excellent, indie, second hand record store, The Record Exchange, close to home. I could walk there and buy anything I wanted, cheap. Randy Newman was also huge for me. Sail Away, wow. I recall seeing Paul Simon live as the musical guest on a very early Saturday Night Live- he was a young man at the time. I was transfixed by this guy. Just a guitar, a pretty voice, heartbreaking lyrics and the coolest chord changes I could ever have imagined. He was also huge for me.\n\nBeyond those early influences, I discovered other music that just exploded for me. For about two years I listened to practically nothing but The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway double album – I knew every word. I eventually discovered more old traditional stuff too like the Preservation Hall stuff, Willy, Johnny. Of course there’s Dylan and lots of rock stuff too. I absolutely love Wilco. There are so many.\n\nHow do you describe your style? Oh gosh, this is always an awkward question for me. It’s kind of like being asked “what do you look like?” My most recent standard go-to on this is “Americana, roots, original, acoustic, singer/songwriter”- how’s that?\n\nWhat brought you to the Friendly Music Community? More like who brought me. That would be Jon Williams. Jon is such a tremendous musician and just as tremendous of a human being. He is an asset, so valuable to the Chicago music scene. I met Jon shortly after relocating to Chicago in ’93 and we’ve worked on so much music together over the past 20 years. He’s a mentor. The Friendly asked Jon to fill 3rd Sundays of each month, and he thought I might be a good fit, so he asked me to see how it goes. That was two years ago October. I always look forward to our monthly Friendly Tap gig- thanks for that Friendly’s!\n\nWhat's your favorite part of performing? It’s interesting; I’ve always had terrible stage fright. It’s gotten manageable over the years, but in the beginning it could be debilitating at times. As a very young performer I fell into the trap of creating these unrealistic self comparisons. That voice inside my head would say, “hey man, what are you doing? You’ll never be Bob Dylan- you have so far to go, give it up, you have zero shot’”. In a lot of ways I’ve often acted counter productively to creating avenues for my music to reach as broad of an audience as possible. The brain is so weird man. I mean, can’t we just be on the same team! Work with me here! Funny that. I’ve gotten much better with that over the years. Despite that anxiety, my inner drive to write songs and perform music has always come out on top. I’ve reached a level of confidence in my abilities, both musically and performance wise now that I feel I belong where I’ve always wanted to be. I’m a big believer that things happen when they are supposed to. Or don’t happen for that matter. There’s a sense of calm in that belief- it helps prevent anxiety over judging your progress against others out there, just doing their thing and making their own deserved progress. It’s a slog that’s for sure. So I guess the short answer is my favorite part of performing is finding that place of peace during a live set when I know that I’m just playing my best and singing my best and everything else has melted away.\n\nWhat's something surprising about you? That I love to spend time alone. Maybe it’s because that’s when I write and read. I mean I love all the people who have blessed my life, but I cherish my completely alone time. I need it to cope. I love it.\n\nWith the new release, is there a story you'd like to share about a particular song on the CD? Hmm, well I’m not a fan of explaining my song lyrics, I feel that kind of closes the book on that song for the listener, takes the listener out of the process a bit and puts a song to bed in a sense. I will give this one up only because it’s so singular to this particular song. Off my new record, I wrote “God in Love in June” on the day that I’d heard the news that June Carter Cash had died. That’s all you’ll get.\n\nA FAN'S TWO CENTS: When was the last time you listened to a song that honestly made you teary-eyed? When each word and sound tugged at your heart? When the ending came too soon? For me, it was probably Leonard Cohen's \"Hallelujah.\" That is, until I heard \"God in Love in June\" by Peter Joly. If you don't remember the last time you had such an experience, at least the next time just might happen after you press the PLAY button below. Sigh.\n\n​Be sure to \"like\" Peter Joly on Facebook, and don't forget to check out his new CD.\n\nAngelic, passionate, soulful. Jodi Walker lights up a stage whether performing solo, in a duet with husband Dave Walker, alongside the breathtaking voices of Jenny Bienemann and/or Naomi Ashley, or in the talented company of The Significant Others. This round-the-clock mom and professional speech pathologist graces the stage of the Friendly Music Community every month, sharing her gifts and introducing the audience to top-notch musicians. Jodi was kind enough to participate in an online interview, so fans like me could learn a little about herself and her art.\n\n* How did you get started in music?\n\nI sang in choruses as a youngster; in high school I was in a vocal jazz group with three other girls. We arranged our own harmonies, and I learned so much about harmony by using my ear. After college I sang at open mics here and there; at 26 I met my husband and began performing in Atlanta with his accompaniment on guitar. We then moved to New York where he attended music school, and during those ten years we performed in NYC and on Long Island with jazz ensembles and a large party cover band. We moved to Oak Park in 2009; within the next few years I began writing and playing mandolin.\n\n* Who were your influences?\n\nI grew up listening to Simon and Garfunkel, classic rock groups such as The Who, progressive rock groups like Yes and I was especially drawn to powerful women musicians such as Stevie Nicks and Bonnie Raitt. In high school I got really interested in jazz and listened to a ton of Billie Holiday, Ella Fitzgerald and Sarah Vaughn. After college I was obsessed with Nina Simone and Nancy Wilson. Most of my current influences are local songwriters including Jenny Bienemann, Naomi Ashley, Cheryl Tomblin, Ron Lazzeretti and the late great James McCandless.\n\n* What's your favorite part of performing?\n\nCollaborating with other musicians, listening to my songs fleshed out by the insanely talented people I play with, and singing back up harmonies\n\n* What's something surprising about you?\n\nI am very socially awkward in new situations and I consider myself to be introverted. I love people but I also love love love my alone time.\n\n* Do you have a special Friendly memory/performance?\n\nThere are so many; it's hard to choose. The Friendly Folk Festivals and What the Folk shows stand out for sure. In particular, I feel very honored to have been present for the Lopardo family's set several years back at the Friendly Folk Festival. Glorious harmonies and power vocals soaring through the space until you thought the roof might blow off.\n\n* What should potential Friendly visitors know about the Night of 1000 Stars show?\n\nWe are so fortunate to have this night every month! Rob basically said, \"Come on in and do whatever,\" and we took that very seriously. Every month we feature two performers - usually a solo singer-songwriter and a small ensemble. We feature local artists from the Oak Park/Berwyn area primarily but have also had folks in from the Westside and Northside, from Door County, WI where we also perform, and occasionally from as far as New York. And as to genre, you never know what you might find: we've had folk, free jazz, hip-hop, roots rock; basically if we see an act we love we ask them to come play. The night always finishes up with our band The Significant Others which features the original songs of Robin Bienemann, Jenny Bienemann and me with an occasional Dave Walker or Cheryl Tomblin original thrown in for good measure. It's a ton of fun and we also raise money via the tip jar each month to support Kidz Express, which is an after school program in Austin. Last year we were able to buy a number of guitars and sheet music for our volunteer music lesson program.\n\n* I love the song \"Listen\" from Broken Bubble. Can you tell me how that song came about? Did the lyrics or music come first?\n\nI'm so glad you asked about that song! I have been involved for about 20 years in a process called Community Building developed by the late Dr. M. Scott Peck in the late 1980's. For the past 7 years I have built community with a fabulous poet named Joe DeMars out of Minneapolis. Joe brought a poem called \"Listen\" to one of our workshops several years ago and I fell in love with it. I took the poem and wrote some music around it to create the song. And I'm not the only one! There is another version of that song out there being performed in churches in Minneapolis.\n\nA Fan's Two Cents: Jodi mentioned that her style of music is a hybrid of jazz, folk, and soul. When listening to her songs, that description is right on. Pieces like \"Alone Together\" and \"Don't Explain\" offer the soothing, seductive vibe of jazz, while \"Grumpy\" (from the album Petulance) presents upbeat, playful folk. And then there's \"Listen,\" a song that I choose for open road night drives, cranked high so that my own sorry voice is drowned out by Jodi's melodious sound (my apologies to my most recent passenger and Michigan friend Kiki, who loved this tune more when she heard it without my harmony). Dim the lights and take a \"listen\" for yourselves."
