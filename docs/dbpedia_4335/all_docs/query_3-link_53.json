        "text": "Three years ago, Ted Tocks Covers began a fun tradition.\n\nWelcome to year four of the Ted Tocks Covers Hall of Fame. Once again, four significant acts will be added to the 12 groups, artists and lyricists that have been appointed by this panel of one. If you are a recent follower of this feature, here are the previous three\n\nTed Tocks Covers Hall of Fame – Year One Inductees\n\nThe Beatles\n\nThe Rolling Stones\n\nLed Zeppelin\n\nWillie Dixon\n\nTed Tocks Covers Hall of Fame – Year Two Inductees\n\nRush\n\nWarren Zevon\n\nGrateful Dead and Robert Hunter\n\nJohn Prine\n\nTed Tocks Covers Hall of Fame – Year Three Inductees\n\nBob Dylan\n\nNeil Young\n\nTom Petty and the Heartbreakers\n\nThe Tragically Hip\n\nThis annual post has become a favourite of mine, even though narrowing it down to four at a time is a major challenge. Perhaps, the most rewarding aspect of this exercise is the fact I get to go back and listen to a ton of great music. Then, I labour over who the four inductees will be with a focus on their legacy on music as a whole, and most importantly, to this feature, the world of cover versions.\n\nThis year’s four inductees quite literally embody why I write Ted Tocks Covers. Each of these artists are phenomenal in their own right. In fact, they are downright legendary. From this standpoint they belong in this quaint little Hall of Fame. But, further to this criteria, these artists often took time to share cover versions by musicians that came before. They were themselves influenced and motivated to the point that they recorded songs by such huge names as B.B. King, Howlin’ Wolf, Carl Perkins, Arthur ‘Big Boy’ Crudup, Otis Redding, Bob Dylan, Buddy Holly, Frank Sinatra, Mike Stoller, Jerry Leiber, Ray Charles and The Beatles.\n\nIt is this lineage that inspired me to write this blog. There is a lot of merit in each and every one of the original artists that produced these timeless recordings. This fact is undeniable. The fascination continues through the years as artists like the four I am about to share offer their own take on the songs that came before. They put a stamp on the significance of the original song, and by virtue of their greatness they take many a wonderful song and put it on the lexicon of timeless.\n\nIt is the level of timeless and legendary where these performers truly reside. Each of them is definitely timeless. Truly essential. They served to define their generation of performers and their influence has gone on to influence several generations of musicians that followed.\n\nTherefore, they define to the perfect degree why I first began to write Ted Tocks Covers, and why I dreamed up the idea of having my own little tribute known as The Ted Tocks Covers Hall of Fame.\n\nSo here you go.\n\nThe first inductee is Aretha Franklin. The ‘Queen of Soul’. What else can I say? Aretha Franklin, was the first woman inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and now fittingly, the Ted Tocks Covers Hall of Fame.\n\nOn that night in 1987, she was inducted by Keith Richards, and even back then, while describing Franklin, ‘Keef’ astutely stated that there are;\n\nNo superlatives left.”\n\nKeith Richards\n\nFrom that day, Aretha Franklin still had three decades of performing and recording to come. Accepting on Aretha’s behalf was her brother Cecil, and the acclaimed record company magnate, Clive Davis. It was Davis that read Aretha Franklin’s speech to those who had gathered to pay tribute to that year’s inductees.\n\nTo be the first woman inductee into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame is a historical moment and indeed a milestone in my career … It is with many thanks and appreciation that I proudly accept and take my place in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.”\n\nAretha Franklin\n\nIn a career that spanned over seven decades, Aretha was inspired by gospel, soul and the blues. When she was a teenager, aspiring to greatness she entered the orbit of such huge names as Ray Charles and Sam Cooke.\n\nIt’s hard to imagine the music world without Franklin, but her songs and her legendary career will continue to live on for years to come — and so will the path she paved for the female artists that will come after her.\n\nWith the exception of one, each of these songs are covers. But as you sift through the list of songs and listen to Aretha Franklin’s take on these classics, you get a sense of how important she is in terms of presentation and style. It is that quality that has carried on through the years.\n\nIt’s all about Respect. The respect that she so richly deserves.\n\nRespect\n\nEleanor Rigby\n\nJumpin’ Jack Flash\n\nCry Like a Baby\n\nI Knew You Were Waiting\n\nGoin’ Down Slow\n\nEveryday People\n\nLove the One You’re With\n\nLet it Be\n\nYou Can’t Always Get What You Want\n\nBridge Over Troubled Water\n\nThe Weight\n\nPeople Get Ready\n\nBorder Song\n\nAmazing Grace\n\nThe Thrill is Gone\n\nSince I began writing Ted Tocks Covers at the beginning of 2018, a name that came up frequently as I dug deeper into the songs, I was writing about was the alluring Linda Ronstadt.\n\nFor Linda Ronstadt, being a performer was all about diversity. She began on the edge of the country rock movement that emerged from the Gram Parsons era of the Byrds and the burgeoning vision of Jackson Browne and the Eagles. She was connected because she was so good. Just listen to the Stone Poneys. They were actually ahead of their time. It was out of this artistry that Linda Ronstadt developed both a following and a network of musicians that gave her a massive platform.\n\nShe rode the wave.\n\nListen as Glenn Frey of the Eagles inducts Linda Ronstadt into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame back in 2014. This is a good speech. Not only is it well written, but Frey speaks to how Linda Ronstadt refused to rest on her laurels and settle on one genre.\n\nLinda Ronstadt recorded 31 albums. She sold over 100 million records and had a career that spanned five decades. She has been a shining example and a true inspiration to every woman who ever stood in front of a microphone and sang her heart out. And through it all, she remains nothing but authentic. You see, Linda lives in a place where art trumps commerce, where self-exploration trumps self-exploitation, where hard work and integrity trump fame and failure. She never wanted to be a star, she just wanted to make good music.”\n\nGlenn Frey\n\nLinda Ronstadt began with country rock, then moved on to Broadway with ‘The Pirates of Penzance’, then jazz, before moving on to a tribute to Mexica classics. Virtually every style she recorded harkened back to her days enjoying music in her family home.\n\nIf I didn’t hear it on the radio, or if my dad wasn’t playing it on the piano, or if my brother wasn’t playing it on the guitar or singing it in his boys’ choir, or my mother and sister weren’t practicing a Broadway tune or a Gilbert and Sullivan song, then I can’t do it today. It’s as simple as that. All of my influences and my authenticity are a direct result of the music played in that Tucson living room.”\n\nLinda Ronstadt\n\nIn many ways Linda Ronstadt never left that comfortable place.\n\nShe shared her voice with beauty, grace and love.”\n\nGlenn Frey\n\nLinda Ronstadt’s voice that could grab people’s hearts and ears no matter what style.\n\nJust Like Tom Thumb’s Blues\n\nLove Me Tender\n\nRock Me on the Water\n\nRiver\n\nCry Like a Baby\n\nBad Case of Lovin’ You\n\nI Fall to Pieces\n\nThat’ll Be the Day\n\nWillin’\n\nCrazy\n\nIt’s So Easy\n\nGet Together\n\nI Believe in You\n\nReturn of the Grievous Angel\n\nA Salute to Tom Petty\n\nA Salute to Warren Zevon\n\nDifferent Drum\n\nYou’re No Good\n\nNext up is the King of Rock and Roll; Elvis Presley\n\nOnce again, we are in a position where superlatives have all been used so nothing truly original can be uttered. Similar to Aretha Franklin and Linda Ronstadt, Elvis Presley was influenced by countless artists who came before. He and his musical peers were literally pioneering the rock and roll genre in the mid to late ‘50s. Once again, we are presented with a list of songs that were written by the blues artists of the day. We also get a true gospel influence. Elvis also gathered inspiration from bluegrass musicians and the ultimate evolution into what would become country music. Almost seamlessly Elvis managed to bundle everything up and share it in a way like no one had ever done before. There was a sex appeal that conservative America struggled to accept. Words and phrases were offered with a double entendre that had been offered in the music of blues artists for years, but because they were Black, the voice was somewhat suppressed in mainstream America. Elvis brought it to the forefront and people began to emulate the style. It was the delivery; the performance that defined the man. He had the charisma and the moves to put it all together. Elvis was a conduit. Seventy years later, he is still essential.\n\nWhen Elvis Presley was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame it was an interesting choice of presenters. Watch as John Lennon’s sons Sean and Julian Lennon share memories of their father John. They recall how much he credited Elvis with everything that followed in terms of music.\n\nOur father was a big fan of Elvis’s and, of course, Elvis was loved all over the world, and we are all influenced [by] him. I think a lot of people in the world get a lot of pleasure from listening to him and love him greatly. Elvis was the thing, whatever people say, he was it. I was not competing against Elvis, rock happened to be the media I was born into – it was the one, that’s all. Those people who picked up paintbrushes, like Van Gogh, probably wanted to be Renoir or whomever went before him. I wanted to be Elvis.”\n\nJulian Lennon\n\nThis speaks volumes. John Lennon and The Beatles knew their place in the lexicon of music history. Once again, this is why I write Ted Tocks Covers. Even those we consider to be the greatest, drew from a wide array of inspiration. This is a common theme in music.\n\nReinforcing this point, once again I turn to John Lennon.\n\nWithout Elvis Presley there would never have been The Beatles.”\n\nJohn Lennon\n\nAs the Elvis Presley Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction speech continued his long-time friend, George Klein delivered what is part eulogy and part induction speech. Ten years after his death, this quote speaks to his status in rock and roll history.\n\nElvis Presley wasn’t a star, he was a damn galaxy!”\n\nGeorge Klein\n\nVery true in terms of his place in music history. Klein goes on to share this beautiful passage from a speech that Elvis Presley gave during a rare public appearance in the early ‘70s. This speaks to the way Elvis defined his own purpose. There is a sense of humility in this passage. Elvis knew he was never bigger than the music. It is partially because Elvis so clearly understood his place in the bigger picture that he remains essential.\n\nWithout a song, the day would never end;\n\nWithout a song, a man ain’t got a friend;\n\nWithout a song, the road would never bend;\n\nWithout a song…\n\nSo, I keep singing a song.”\n\nElvis Franklin\n\nAnd without I song I wouldn’t write these tributes. In terms of rock and roll, this is where it all began. Once again, take note of the fact that the 30 features that follow are either cover versions of classic songs or creations written for Elvis to present in his own inimitable way.\n\nLove Me Tender\n\nAmazing Grace\n\nBridge Over Troubled Water\n\nReturn to Sender\n\nA Mini Salute to BB King\n\nAlways on My Mind\n\nHeartbreak Hotel\n\nBaby What You Want Me to Do\n\nEarly Morning Rain\n\nMy Way\n\nBurning Love\n\nSweet Caroline\n\nSuspicious Minds\n\nI Got a Woman\n\nThat’s All Right Mama\n\nHound Dog\n\nTutti Frutti\n\nWhole Lotta Shakin’ Goin’ On\n\nBlue Suede Shoes\n\nMystery Train\n\nSuch a Night\n\nBaby Let’s Play House\n\nPolk Salad Annie\n\nI’m So Lonesome I Could Cry\n\nThe Last Farewell\n\nLittle Sister\n\nBog Boss Man\n\nBlue Moon of Kentucky\n\nAll Shook Up\n\nJailhouse Rock\n\nLast up is the great Joe Cocker. For several years now Ted Tocks Covers has declared that Cocker is the greatest cover artist of all time. I stand by this quote and here is why.\n\nThe spirit of his delivery. It was immediate. Whether you were listening or watching, the Joe Cocker vibe came through in the performance and you felt like anything was possible.\n\nJoe Cocker defined soul. In my opinion, he was the natural evolution from Ray Charles. Joe Cocker had a deep respect for his American counterpart.\n\nWhen Joe Cocker took the stage or stood behind the microphone in the recording studio, he not only channeled the artist he was honouring, he took his interpretation to a different level. The intensity of his mannerisms defined Joe Cocker. He was like a shaman casting a spell and the mood he evoked became a pressure cooker, just waiting to explode.\n\nThe power of Joe Cocker was immediate thanks to the vision of producer Denny Cordell. His debut album featured the Grease Band. Cocker’s soulful rendition of ‘With a Little Help from My Friends’ blew people’s minds. Here, Paul McCartney paid tribute when he was commenting on Joe Cocker’s death ten years ago.\n\nHe was a lovely northern lad who I loved a lot and, like many people, I loved his singing. I was especially pleased when he decided to cover ‘With a Little Help from My Friends’ and I remember him and (producer) Denny Cordell coming round to the studio in Savile Row (central London) and playing me what they’d recorded and it was just mind-blowing, totally turned the song into a soul anthem and I was forever grateful to him for doing that.”\n\nPaul McCartney\n\nLike so many of the greats, the best tributes come from his peers and there is a long line of musicians that have advocated for Joe Cocker.\n\nWith all eyes on him, Cocker brought his act to the stage during Woodstock and he stole the show. A year later he teamed up with his long-time friends Chris Stainton and Leon Russell among many others. The result was the ‘Mad Dogs and Englishmen’ tour which borders on legendary over fifty years later. Joe Cocker put so much of himself into that tour that it nearly killed him. He left everything on the stage, and it has to be noted, the drugs took a toll.\n\nBut he prevailed.\n\nThe hits ran through the decades, and the legend only grew.\n\nUnlike the other three honourees featured today, Joe Cocker is not in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\n\nIn a sense, Ted Tocks Covers has beaten the institution to this recognition.\n\nJoe Cocker had a captivating presence and his soulful delivery grabbed you by the throat and the heart at the same time.\n\nEvery time.\n\nPut him up where he belongs. Ted Tocks Covers is leading the charge.\n\nHere are several Ted Tocks Covers features that have included Joe Cocker.\n\n#1 on the Same Date 14 Years Apart\n\nJamaica Say You Will\n\nSummer in the City\n\nUnchain My Heart\n\nDelta Lady\n\nMidnight Rider\n\nThe Letter\n\nSomething\n\nCan’t Find My Way Home\n\nFeeling Alright\n\nUp Where We Belong\n\nWhiter Shade of Pale\n\nA Little Help From My Friends\n\nWhen a Man Loves a Woman\n\nYou Are So Beautiful\n\nYou Can Leave Your Hat On\n\nFirst We Take Manhattan\n\nDon’t Let Me Be Misunderstood\n\nTo summarize, todays’ feature is all about how music has evolved through the years. If you look at the songs featured you will note that original versions date back as far as the 1770s in the case of ‘Amazing Grace’, and go all the way through to pretty much the present day when we check out the cover versions. That’s 250 years of musical power, and how songs and performance inspire everyone from the artist who shares their talent to the vast audience who take everything in.\n\nMusic has the power to define our lives.\n\nThis sentiment has been demonstrated over and over again in the pages of Ted Tocks Covers.\n\nThe four artists honoured today speak to that premise. They each did it their own way.\n\nAretha Franklin paved the way for women and represents the pinnacle of achievement. Quite appropriately, many others have followed, but the Queen of Soul was first.\n\nLinda Ronstadt succeeded in literally every style she presented, and never let the prevailing trends determine her path. She went in her own direction. Her vocal prowess became her calling card and she drew people in like a mythological siren.\n\nElvis Presley pretty much knows no peers, but somehow at the same time he is the best example of how even the greatest artists of all time had their head on a swivel for the best artists to emulate. By borrowing from those who surrounded him, Elvis quite literally served to pioneer the genre of music known as rock and roll. Through 70 years this all-encompassing definition has splintered into more elements than we can even count. But, one thing will always be true.\n\nIf you ask any musician to share a list of most influential artists of all time, I guarantee you Elvis Presley will appear on the majority.\n\nFinally, Joe Cocker just managed to interpret everything he heard in such a dynamic way. Music is about presentation. It appeals to the senses. Obviously, a good recording will allow a listener to hear the quality. With Joe Cocker, you also saw how the song moved him. You could truly feel the emotion. He was electrifying. A case could be made that Joe Cocker also touched upon the other two senses.\n\nHopefully you can spend some time with today’s feature and explore these essential artists. There are over 80 posts and I suspect well over 200 acts within these words. Each are sharing their take on a number of songs. In every case the musical timeline will flow back to the four people honoured today.\n\nYou can almost picture the scene.\n\nA van with Canadian plates. A group of musicians are rolling down the highway to a gig in New Orleans. Because in the words of C.W. McCall, they looked like some “long haired friends of Jesus in a chartreuse micro bus” a couple of truckers thought it would be fun to surround them and slow their roll to a crawl.\n\nThe band was Bachman-Turner Overdrive and they were on their way to a gig in New Orleans.\n\nThe story above continued until the truckers pulled into a rest stop. Randy Bachman and Fred Turner were determined to not let them get away with this transgression so they approached the drivers, one of whom Bachman described as “a Volkswagen with a head” and began to lash out. Relatively unphased by the Canadian rockers, they just smirked and told the band that they needed to calm down.\n\nSometimes the best advice comes from the strangest of places, when you least expect it.\n\nThe exact expression they used was, they needed to just “let it ride.”\n\nBachman and Turner were frozen in their tracks. They took these words of advice with them to Bourbon Street and wrote ‘Let it Ride’ in their dressing room that night.\n\nRandy Bachman borrowed the guitar riff from a classical piece by Antonin Dvorak called ‘Piano Concerto in D’. He managed to transpose the chord progression to suit the phrasing. To his credit, Bachman is very open about this influence.\n\nYou’ve got to get them, reshape them, and hopefully they are reshaped enough that you can call it original.”\n\nRandy Bachman\n\nDo you know who was not quite so honest about the creative revelation that occurred before writing a hit song.\n\nIf you guessed The Doobie Brothers, you may be correct.\n\nThe band that Bachman-Turner Overdrive were opening for in New Orleans that night was in fact, The Doobie Brothers. They shared a dressing room. While Fred Turner and the three Bachman brothers were working out the structure for ‘Let it Ride’ the other ‘Brothers’ were nearby. They were captured by the riff.\n\nListen to ‘Long Train Runnin’.\n\nThe Doobie Brothers deny this accusation. They claim that ‘Long Train Runnin’ was derived from a long-standing jam piece from their earliest days jamming in front of the Hells Angels up and down the California coast.\n\nI will leave this argument for debate.\n\nFor B.T.O., ‘Let it Ride’ became the lead single for the album ‘Bachman-Turner Overdrive II’ which was released fifty years ago today. Back in the days of vinyl, it was the fitting track to close side 1 of this classic Canadian album.\n\nNow, let’s turn the record over and see what side 2 brings.\n\nMuch like The Doobie Brothers claim with ‘Long Train Runnin’, ‘Takin’ Care of Business’ has roots going all the way back to Randy Bachman’s days as the driving force behind The Guess Who. Bachman is very clear that he was inspired to write a tribute to the white-collar worker based on The Beatles ‘Paperback Writer’. Since he departed The Guess Who in 1970, he needed to avoid re-creating the band’s post Bachman single, ‘Bus Rider’. For a few years the idea was shelved until he formed Bachman-Turner Overdrive.\n\nMuch like ‘American Woman’ the earliest incarnation of ‘Takin’ Care of Business’ flowed from his strings during an improvised jam session. In this case, Fred Turner’s voice had given out during a show which left the vocals up to a somewhat unprepared Randy Bachman. Not to be deterred, Bachman called out to the band to;\n\nPlay these three chords over and over – C, B flat, and F – endlessly and when I get to the hook, help me out.”\n\nRandy Bachman\n\nIn what was perhaps a perfect twist of fate, Bachman had recently heard a local DJ tell his listeners that he was in the booth ‘Takin’ Care of Business’. Bachman felt this was a better idea than the vanilla ‘White Collar Worker’ that was lying dormant in the back of his mind.\n\nSo, while the band jammed the repetitive riff over and over again, Randy Bachman let the audience know that he and the boys were just on stage ‘taking care of business’.\n\nLet’s face it. The riff is a winner. Here is the ultimate album track which was released as the ‘Bachman-Turner Overdrive II’ follow up single to ‘Let it Ride.\n\nTwo riffs. Two timeless hits.\n\nIn order to avoid the monotony of the repetitive three chords Randy Bachman recalled a song he had been working on with Canadian musician, song writer and producer, Ralph Murphy. Its working title was ‘A Little Bit of Rain’.\n\nThat riff is used in the middle of ‘Takin’ Care Of Business,’ just to break the monotony because ‘Takin’ Care Of Business’ was three chords over and over and over. It had no bridge. No hook. No song format, other than that it was ‘Louie Louie’. ‘Endless, mind-bashing of three chords. And the original version, as I explained at the Ryman, had twelve chords. That’s why nobody liked it. It had an incredible number of chords.”\n\nRandy Bachman\n\nHere is ‘A Little Bit of Rain’ in its final form. The song was released by a band called Shooter in 1976. This is really good. Fans of the Grateful Dead might detect a little bit of ‘Shakedown Street’ in this track.\n\nIf you get the sense that ‘Takin’ Care of Business’ was a combination of spontaneity and a bunch of spare parts floating around in Randy Bachman’s fertile musical mind you are correct.\n\nPerhaps the best anecdote related to ‘Takin’ Care of Business’ is how the piano track became an integral component of this essential CanCon hit.\n\nWho is that piano player? Who is Norman Durkee?\n\nWell, one version of the story suggests he is the pizza guy. Yes, the pizza guy with a good ear for music.\n\nIt is alleged that Norman Durkee was entrepreneurial enough to get the pizza right to the crew as they were working on ‘Takin’ Care of Business’ and he was bold enough to offer his thoughts.\n\nEssentially, he had two observations.\n\nGood song.\n\nIt needs a piano track.\n\nBTO’s initial thought was, thanks for your input and here’s your money but as the session stalled, they all came to a new consensus.\n\n“Let’s call Norman.”\n\nHere is the story as told by Randy Bachman’s long-time friend John Presho.\n\nRandy Bachman told me that when BTO was in the recording studio the record producer wasn’t happy with the raw version of that song. BTO took a time out, ordered a pizza and went back to work on the song. A while later there was a knock on the studio door and it was the pizza delivery man. After giving the band their pizza he commented that ‘Takin’ Care of Business’ was a great song but it needed some piano playing. The pizza man introduced himself as Norman and said that he was a piano player. BTO thanked and tipped him and sent him on his way. Hours later with no improvement in the song they decided to call Norman, but no one got his phone number or could remember the name of the pizza place. BTO called a half dozen pizza houses before they were able to track him down. The band paid Norman’s $75 to join the musician’s union so he could play the piano in the recording studio.”\n\nJohn Presho\n\nThis is a great rock and roll story, but unfortunately it may not be entirely true.\n\nThe studio was Kaye-Smith Studios in Seattle. We know this for sure.\n\nThe validity of the pizza guy legend is a matter of some dispute.\n\nBTO drummer, Robbie Bachman has stated that Norman Durkee was actually in the studio as a session player. An observant sound engineer named Buzz Richmond suggested that they grab the guy in the next room who was working on some commercials. After a quick conversation with Randy Bachman, Durkee learned the chord structure of ‘Takin’ Care of Business’. Because he was on the clock, he wrote the chords on a pizza box and they recorded his track live from the floor. One and done.\n\nA simple search on Google will reveal quite a musical resume for Norman Durkee and it does not involve scenes like this.\n\nMuch to everyone’s delight ‘Takin’ Care of Business’ was the closing track on ‘Bachman-Turner Overdrive II. What a way to sign off.\n\nOne anecdote related to ‘Takin Care of Business’ that is definitely true is that Elvis Presley was a fan of the song and the expression. So much so, that over the last few years of his life the King of Rock and Roll adapted a modified version of this phrase as his motto and the name for his back up band.\n\nTakin’ care of business in a flash.”\n\nElvis Presley\n\nThis was highly visible on his private jet and it remains a cornerstone of his official merchandise 50 years later. Unlike the pizza guy rumour this reference has been verified by Priscilla Presley.\n\nIt is also interesting to note that Elvis is known to have recorded a version of ‘Takin’ Care of Business’ but it resides in a vault somewhere. That recording would likely add some nice change to the Elvis Presley estate.\n\nMore than enough to buy some pizza.\n\nLet’s take a ride back through time and look at a few versions of ‘Takin’ Care of Business’ from a variety of acts.\n\nTo begin, here is Bachman-Turner Overdrive takin’ care of business with an enthusiastic introduction from none other than Keith Moon of The Who.\n\nHere is an interesting cover version from Kurtis Blow from 1980. This is where rock and roll is exploring the possibilities of rap.\n\nOne act that imagined what ‘Takin’ Care of Business’ would have sounded like as an Elvis song was the eternally funky act Dread Zeppelin. Check out their recording from 1992. This appears on their album ‘’It’s Not Unusual’. Like they say; you can file this under ‘groovy booty bomb’.\n\nOne year later, country music legends, Alabama added ‘Takin’ Care of Business’ to their live set. This is from their album ‘Gonna Have a Party Live’\n\nThrough fifty years of recording and touring, and as a result of being a classic rock staple ‘Takin Care of Business’ has become not only an industry catch-phrase but yet another essential guitar riff. Back in 1994 Randy Bachman hosted an amateur guitar jam that included 1322 guitar players of varying ability. This group of enthusiastic players played for over an hour. The record stood until 2009 when over 6300 players gathered in Poland to jam on ‘Hey Joe’.\n\nSpeaking of pop culture connections, enjoy this fun clip from The Simpsons in 2000.\n\n“Bart – Who are those pleasant old men?\n\nHomer – That’s BTO. They’re Canada’s answer to ELP. They’re big hit was TCB. That’s the way we talked in the ‘70s. We didn’t have a moment to spare.”\n\nThe Simpsons\n\nIs it just me or does Randy Bachman look like Jerry Garcia.\n\nThree years later in 2003, British rock and roll legends Status Quo released a cover of this Canadian classic. This is from their album ‘Rifts’. Similar to Slade; Status Quo is an act that was huge in the U.K. but never really caught on in North America. Always rockin’ and always fun. ‘Takin’ Care of Business’ is the perfect song for these guys to offer up to their devoted audience.\n\nBringing things all the way back around, let’s close off today’s post with a couple of quality covers.\n\nFirst, enjoy this incredible blast from Canadian rockers Big Sugar. This is from their 1998 album ‘Heated’. Heavy sludge with a funky groove. Man, this is good. The best of all covers shared in this feature. Listening to this cover made me wonder if Randy Bachman and Gordie Johnson have ever collaborated on a recording and at a glance, I do not see any evidence of this happening. Ted Tocks Covers would like to issue this as a formal request.\n\nWho’s with me?\n\nThis seems like a pretty good stepping off point. Ted Tocks Covers will send you on your way with The Guess Who ‘Together Again’ in Toronto back in 1983. Some guy named Burton Cummings is hammering the piano keys, with a big thanks to Norman Durkee. Just awesome!\n\nPlease take note of two important life lessons in this post courtesy of Bachman-Turner Overdrive.\n\nFirst, if somebody makes a bit of a mistake in your presence but it doesn’t really hurt anyone, just ‘Let it Ride’. You never know what they may be going through, and in the moment, they may have just lost their focus.\n\nSecond, in the name of productivity, make use of your time. Get down to what needs to be done.\n\n“Take good care of your business”\n\nEvery day…in every way.\n\nThen take some time for yourself.\n\nYou deserve it.\n\nMost, if not all of us know ‘Love Me Tender’ by Elvis Presley as a hit song from the King of Rock and Roll’. How many know that it was derived from a Civil War era love ballad?\n\nHere is the brief story, and as Ted Tocks Covers so often does, I will sift through some covers and share a few with you.\n\nBack in 1956, Elvis was a heartthrob of unimaginable proportions. In order to capitalize on his popularity, Elvis’s people looked to making him a movie star. Initially he was to play a bit part in a movie called ‘The Reno Brothers’. As the filming progressed the focus undeniably shifted to Elvis and the song that ultimately describes the sentiment of the film. That song was ‘Love Me Tender’.\n\nThe credit for this concept should go to musical director Ken Darby. The premise of the film was to create a movie where songs from the Civil War period were adapted for Elvis to sing. One particular song was ‘Aura Lee’ which was written by W.W. Fosdick and George R. Poulton in 1861, and originally recorded by Geo. Campbell in 1862. Unfortunately, I couldn’t track down any version of the recording from over 160 years ago, I was able to find this version from the Shelton Brothers dating back 85 years. This will give you a sense of the passion behind the lyrics.\n\nHere is the extremely sentimental poem.\n\nAs the blackbird in the spring\n\n‘neath the willow tree\n\nsat and piped I heard him sing\n\npraising Aura Lee.\n\nAura Lee! Aura Lee! Maid of golden hair\n\nsunshine came along with thee\n\nand swall-ows in the air.\n\nTake my heart and take my ring\n\nI give my all to thee\n\ntake me for eternity\n\ndearest Aura Lee!\n\nAura Lee! Aura Lee! Maid of golden hair\n\nsunshine came along with thee\n\nand swall-ows in the air.\n\nIn her blush the rose was born\n\n’twas music when she spoke\n\nIn her eyes the light of morn\n\nsparkling seemed to break.\n\nAura Lee! Aura Lee! Maid of golden hair\n\nsunshine came along with thee\n\nand swall-ows in the air.\n\nAura Lee the bird may flee\n\nthe willow’ golden hair\n\nthen the wintry winds may be\n\nblowing ev’rywhere.\n\nAura Lee! Aura Lee! Maid of golden hair\n\nsunshine came along with thee\n\nand swall-ows in the air.\n\nYet if thy blue eyes I see\n\ngloom will soon depart\n\nfor to me sweet Aura Lee\n\nis sunshine to the heart.\n\nAura Lee! Aura Lee! Maid of golden hair\n\nsunshine came along with thee\n\nand swall-ows in the air.\n\nW.W. Fosdick\n\nYou can feel the tension between love and fear, along with regret and impending doom.\n\nFor good measure, here is a more current rendition by Tom Roush. This was done in 2014.\n\nDo you remember the 1982 movie ‘Trading Places’ with Eddie Murphy, Jamie Lee Curtis and Dan Ackroyd? Here is a scene which is actually a take on ‘Aura Lea’ and its popularity as a traditional song.\n\nGetting back to the Elvis version, the lyrics are credited to Ken Darby’s wife, Vera Matson, and Elvis Presley. As noted, the melody is a direct take on ‘Aura Lea’. Therefore, the song credits acknowledge all three. As noted above, in 1956, ‘Aura Lea’ simply existed in the public domain as a traditional song. It was immensely popular among glee clubs and barbershop quartets.\n\nWhile Matson and Presley received the writing credit for ‘Love Me Tender’ all it takes is a little reading between the lines to recognize that the lyrics were purely a Ken Darby creation. First, here is a quote from Darby when asked why the song was credited to his wife.\n\nBecause she didn’t write it either.”\n\nKen Darby\n\nIn a less bitter moment, Darby gave Elvis full credit for his presentation.\n\nHe adjusted the music and the lyrics to his own particular presentation. Elvis has the most terrific ear of anyone I have ever met. He does not read music, but he does not need to. All I had to do was play the song for him once, and he made it his own! He has perfect judgment of what is right for him. He exercised that judgment when he chose ‘Love Me Tender’ as his theme song.”\n\nKen Darby\n\nThis speaks to the strength of Elvis as an artist. Interpretation was the space where Elvis thrived. It is here that we understand the context of ‘Love Me Tender’ in the movie. Listen to this introduction from Ed Sullivan back in 1956.\n\nAs one watches, you can’t help but notice how captivated the audience becomes. Elvis has everyone in the palm of his hand. The spontaneous applause during a couple of key moments comes from the depths of their soul. The backing vocals by The Jordanaires is haunting. This version of ‘Love Me Tender’ was performed on September 9, 1956. It pre-dated the movie release by about a month. Based on this performance, RCA received over 1 million advance orders for the song which made it a gold hit before it was even released. It hit #1 on November 3, 1956 and stayed on the top of the charts for five weeks. This just puts Elvis and his popularity in perspective.\n\nOne more quick note; the producer of ‘Love Me Tender’ would not allow Elvis Presley to record with his regular band which famously included Scotty Moore, Bill Black and D.J. Fontana. Back up was provided by The Ken Darby Trio which included Red Robinson, Charles Prescott and Vita Mumolo. Jon Dodson offered backing vocals. Here is the movie version.\n\nSing along with the lyrics that were adapted by some combination of Vera Matson, Elvis Presley and Ken Darby.\n\nLove me tender,\n\nlove me sweet,\n\nnever let me go.\n\nYou have made my life complete,\n\nand I love you so.\n\nLove me tender,\n\nlove me true,\n\nall my dreams fulfilled.\n\nFor my darlin’ I love you,\n\nand I always will.\n\nLove me tender,\n\nlove me long,\n\ntake me to your heart.\n\nFor it’s there that I belong,\n\nand we’ll never part.\n\nLove me tender,\n\nlove me dear,\n\ntell me you are mine.\n\nI’ll be yours through all the years,\n\ntill the end of time.\n\n(When at last my dreams come true\n\nDarling this I know\n\nHappiness will follow you\n\nEverywhere you go).\n\nVera Matson, Elvis Presley and Ken Darby\n\nNow let’s move on to the cover versions. As always, with Elvis the list of covers numbers well over 300, so limiting the number within the context of Ted Tocks Covers becomes a challenge. Nevertheless, here we go…\n\nWe are coming out strong with this 1966 cover from the great Percy Sledge. The soul just pours from his delivery.\n\nThree years later in 1969, Johnny Nash covered ‘Love Me Tender’. It comes across as so sincere; it is like he is reciting a love letter. So nice.\n\nAnother one from 1969. Here is Albert King from his Elvis tribute album cleverly entitled, ‘King does the King’s Things’.\n\nMoving on to 1978, here is Linda Ronstadt from her album ‘Living in the USA’. Linda is always the personification of vocal perfection.\n\nLet’s cap off our mini tribute to ‘The Kings’. We can call it ‘We Three Kings’. In all seriousness, here is BB King live in 1983. He lets his band shine. I love the piano and the sax solo is beautiful. Ever the legend, B.B. holds back until 3:44 before he puts a finishing touch on the song with his trademark guitar work.\n\nYou gotta love Willie Nelson. Here he is back in 1985. He is still going strong. He is a living legend. This beautiful version is from the soundtrack for Porky’s Revenge.\n\nThis one is for my mother-in-law, Deanna! Here is Nana Mouskouri from her 1986 album ‘Why Worry’. Yet another evocative cover version.\n\nThis is an important cover from the one and only, Jordanaires. This comes complete with a short back story. They released this tribute album in 1989. It was appropriately entitled ‘Elvis Memories’. It consists of ten epic Elvis tracks, interpreted by this famous vocal ensemble.\n\nHere, we lighten the mood a little with Bugs Bunny and Friends. Foghorn Leghorn takes the lead in this 1997 tribute. Toward the end, it gets a little silly, but it’s still fun.\n\nHeading into the new millennium which represents over half a century of Elvis influence we feature Chris Isaak and Brandi Carlile. I love Brandi and Chris Isaak is just an amazing vocalist. This is a live recording from 2008. For Carlile, it was a sign of the greatness that was just emerging.\n\nTwo years later, in 2010 Nora Jones covered ‘Love Me Tender’ on her album ‘Come Away with Me’. Just one more in a long line of incredible covers.\n\nA quick check lists official cover versions at 355 and counting. That doesn’t even take into account the many versions of ‘Aura Lea’. The story behind ‘Love Me Tender’ speaks to the power of music and influence that sometimes bridges centuries. It becomes a fascinating journey.\n\nIt says here, that musicians will be recording ‘Love Me Tender’ ‘til the end of time.\n\nThere is not much that Ted Tocks Covers can say about Elvis Presley or today’s feature ‘Return to Sender’, that has not already been said. This song goes back sixty years. It resided at #1 on this day in 1962 following its release in early October of that year. ‘Return to Sender’ was recorded by Elvis and performed in the movie ‘Girls, Girls, Girls’.\n\nToday’s post will serve as a nod to the lesser-known writing talent of the great songwriter, Otis Blackwell, who wrote ‘Return to Sender with Winfield Scott.\n\nBy 1962, Elvis Presley was getting a little bit restless in his journey as a rock and roll idol and cultural icon. Branching out into film was an escape, but elements of it all were becoming cliché. In the spring of ’62 he was asked to record 13 songs for the ‘Girls, Girls, Girls’ soundtrack. To say he was uninspired is an understatement. Elvis breezed through the recordings at a rapid pace along with The Jordanaires, Dudley Brooks, D.J. Fontana and Scotty Moore. It wasn’t until they got to ‘Return to Sender’ that Elvis came alive. Accounts of the session recall that Elvis was energized. He recorded the song in just two takes, modelling his delivery on the tried and true presentation of Otis Blackwell. Presley had success with a Blackwell composition in 1957 with ‘All Shook Up’.\n\nThe term that arose from recollections related to the ‘Girls, Girls, Girls’ sessions was the “old magic” returned when Elvis sang ‘Return to Sender’. That creative inspiration is truly captured in the presentation. From a lyrical perspective ‘Return to Sender’ is a sad piece, but by virtue of a couple of key decisions the song turned into a boppy and up-tempo hit. Taking a page from Otis Blackwell’s style, Elvis opted to make the saxophone of Boots Randolph the lead instrument in the chorus rather than the more customary guitar. This allowed the song about a man who was ghosted by his lover to become almost joyful in its presentation.\n\nTo follow up on the studio recording, here is the visual from the ‘Girls, Girls, Girls’ movie.\n\nNow let’s explore the Otis Blackwell influence. Here is Otis from his 1977 release. ‘These Are My Songs’. You have got to love the album title. Otis is a gem. He should be celebrated.\n\nSadly, Otis Blackwell never had the opportunity to meet Elvis Presley. Elvis’s manager Colonel Tom Parker offered him a cameo in ‘Girls, Girls, Girls’ but he politely declined. It seems Otis was a little superstitious and felt that meeting his ‘voice’ might destroy the successful collaboration.\n\nPerhaps this was a wise move, because over the years, songs penned by any combination of Otis Blackwell, either solo or with song writing partners such as Winfield Scott, or under Blackwell’s pseudonym, John Davenport, sold over 200 million copies.\n\nSadly, Otis Blackwell was slowed down by a stroke in 1991 and he died of a heart attack in 2002.\n\nTypical of any song popularized by Elvis Presley, there are numerous cover versions available to share. Today’s feature will offer four covers which have been chosen based on a combination of intrigue and star factor.\n\nTed Tocks Covers will lead off with Frankie Venom of Teenage Head fame live from the stage of Rock and Roll Heaven in Toronto, back in 1986. Venom stamps his trademark style on this timeless song. This show represents Venom with his new band The Vipers, a short time after he opted to leave Teenage Head.\n\nHere is Ian McCulloch of Echo and the Bunnymen fame in 1990. This is from his album ‘Mysterio’. This is so smooth. So good.\n\nPerhaps the most important cover was produced by the great Dave Edmunds in 1994. This is from a tribute album appropriately entitled ‘Brace Yourself: A Tribute to Otis Blackwell’.\n\nDo yourself a favour and listen to this album in its entirety. This truly captures the brilliance of Otis Blackwell.\n\nOver the years, Rod Stewart has made it his personal mission to celebrate the importance of the artists that made his success possible. Here is Sir Rod with the MGs in 2009.\n\nIt’s difficult to put a finger on it, but something doesn’t sit well with the lack of recognition for Otis Blackwell in the lexicon of song writers over the past 70 years. The song featured in this post. and the few others I have shared only scratch the surface. When record sales approach the quarter billion-mark accolades really should extend beyond the inner circle in the music scene and super fans of the artists who made his songs famous. ‘Don’t Be Cruel’ people, explore on your own and then branch out and see for yourself. Otis Blackwell needs to be celebrated.\n\nHere is a beginning.\n\nNow, don’t get me wrong. Otis has received some high praise. In 2010, he was honoured posthumously in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame with the Ahmet Ertugen Award for his contribution to music behind the scenes.\n\nAgain, great recognition, but there is a veil to the honour.\n\nIt should be added that he is in the Songwriter’s Hall of Fame, and Otis Blackwell was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame earlier this year. This is positive, but the blues only represents a portion of his contribution to music. His music has covered up to four generations and multiple genres including rock and roll, country and R&B.\n\nMaybe it just a reflection of Otis and his laid back approach. He never really wanted to be in the spotlight.\n\nI always figured it was best if I write my songs, take them to my publisher and just lay back. There used to be so many things going on – getting to the artist, getting to the publishers – you know, politics. I just didn’t want to get mixed up in all of that.\n\nOtis Blackwell\n\nAn argument could be made that he was on to something.\n\nIn the meantime, this one’s for Otis.\n\nA pioneer in the truest sense.\n\nCelebrate!\n\nThe goal of today’s post is to have a little bit of fun. In a way, it is an effort to reach out and touch someone in order to let them know you are there.\n\nHands, touching hands, reaching out\n\nTouching me, touching you”\n\nNeil Diamond\n\nWhile I do this, I will briefly explain how ‘Sweet Caroline’ became a rally song in Boston’s Fenway Park, and ultimately a worldwide arena anthem. Hopefully it will serve this purpose.\n\nThe interesting truth about ‘Sweet Caroline’ as a song is it has always been a bit of an underdog. I guess you could say it was an afterthought. The fact that it remains a vital hit over fifty years after its initial release is very fitting. In April of 1969, Neil Diamond released his fourth studio album, ‘Brother Love’s Travelling Salvation Show’. The title track from that album became a top 30 hit, reaching #22 on the charts. This left Neil clamoring to come up with a follow up single. He wrote ‘Sweet Caroline’ as a love song for his wife at the time, Marsha. Although he had a perfect muse, the two-syllable name was not working, and he was struggling to find a word to rhyme with Marsha. Around the time he was creating the song, Diamond saw an article in a magazine about the Kennedy family. He was captured by the poise of young Caroline Kennedy. Now the song, had completed lyrics and a proper title. With some arrangement assistance from Charles Calello, Neil Diamond hit the studio with producers Tom Catalano and Tommy Cogbill, who also played bass. ‘Sweet Caroline’ became an instant hit, making its way to #4 on the charts the very same week that half a million music fans converged on Max Yasgur’s farm in Bethel, New York. The fact that ‘Sweet Caroline’ became so popular became a bit of a challenge to Neil Diamond and his management team. Since the song was recorded and released after the album, they had to adapt. The result was, all future releases of ‘Brother Love’s Traveling Salvation Show’ included ‘Sweet Caroline’. This came complete with a new sleeve that promoted ‘Sweet Caroline’ as part of the package known as ‘Sweet Caroline/Brother Love’s Traveling Salvation Show’. The follow up had dominated the original release.\n\nBefore I move on, it should be noted that ‘Sweet Caroline’ included the famous Memphis Boys, the house band from Chip Moman’s American Sound Studio. These guys were prolific. They included the aforementioned Tommy Cogbill on bass, Gene Chrisman on drums, Bobby Emmons on keyboards and Reggie Young on guitar (see ‘Suspicious Minds’). For some added perspective, Bobby Emmons and Chips Moman wrote ‘Luchenbach Texas’ for Waylon Jennings. In other words, Neil Diamond was surrounded by greatness in this Memphis studio.\n\nAs great as the song was upon its original release and subsequent pressings it has enjoyed a new life over the past twenty-five years. It all began in 1996 in Charlotte, North Carolina at the home of the National Football League’s Carolina Panthers. The programmer played ‘Sweet Caroline’ at all of the team’s home games. This practice continues to this day, most recently as a salute to front line workers during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nPerhaps the most famous combination of ‘Sweet Caroline’ and a sports team exists at Fenway Park in Boston, the famous home of the Boston Red Sox. This tradition began in 1997 in a relatively innocent way. Fenway Park employee Amy Tobey was in charge of music at the iconic venue. Her friend had recently given birth to a baby daughter fatefully named Caroline. Before the home team came up in the 8th inning Tobey blasted ‘Sweet Caroline’ as an ode to the new addition. She noted that it seemed to go over well, so she attached some rules to its use. She would only play it between the 7th and 9th innings, and it could only happen if the Red Sox were winning. By 2002, Dr. Charles Steinberg joined the Boston Red Sox as Vice President of public affairs. He insisted that ‘Sweet Caroline’ become a regular part of the gameday experience. He saw the song as having ‘transformative powers’. He initiated a policy that the song be played in the middle of the eighth inning.\n\nI wanted it to be the middle of the eighth, because you want your more festive songs to occur when the home team is coming up to bat. So we started playing it each day in 2002.”\n\nDr. Charles Steinberg\n\nSo, from 2002 to the present, Neil Diamond and ‘Sweet Caroline’ have become inextricably linked to the Boston Red Sox. This was all firmly cemented when Diamond revealed the connection between the song title and Massachusetts’ own Caroline Kennedy in an interview in 2007.\n\nIt was a No. 1 record and probably is the biggest, most important song of my career, and I have to thank her for the inspiration. I’m happy to have gotten it off my chest and to have expressed it to Caroline. I thought she might be embarrassed, but she seemed to be struck by it and really, really happy.”\n\nNeil Diamond\n\nOver the years, ‘Sweet Caroline’ has become as much a part of the Fenway Park experience as beer and a bowl of clam chowder. Never was the power of the song so strong as when in 2013, Neil Diamond agreed to come and perform the song as a salute to the ‘Boston Strong’ cause after the Boston Marathon bombings. Diamond kindly agreed to donate royalties from ‘Sweet Caroline’ to ‘One Fund Boston’, a charity formed to help the people most impacted by the horrific bombings set by domestic terrorists during the running of the 2013 Boston Marathon. Before singing, Neil Diamond saluted the crowd and the city by saying:\n\nWhat an honor it is for me to be here today. I bring love from the whole country.”\n\nNeil Diamond\n\nHere is that galvanizing performance.\n\nAs much as this is a fun tradition, baseball purists are appalled at the notion that a song with no real connection to the team has become such a tradition. The arguments go back and forth. Here is a comment from Boston sportswriter Nick Underhill who cynically points out:\n\nEach night they shamefully scream out the words to “Sweet Caroline” as if everything is all good even when it isn’t. Hey, you spent $400 to bring your family to a game and they just blew a nine-run lead to your most hated rival. How do you feel right now? ‘So good! So good!’”\n\nNick Underhill\n\nI can see both sides of this argument. It used to drive me crazy when fans at Toronto Blue Jays home games started ‘the wave’ at inappropriate times. Having said that, it is hard to speak out against the pure fun the crowd is having, especially in moments like the Neil Diamond performance shared above. In the end, the Boston Red Sox managed to break an 86 year World Series drought in 2004. ‘Sweet Caroline’ was front and centre during that run and for each victory since that time. You can’t argue with success.\n\nThe celebration of ‘Sweet Caroline’ did not end with the Boston Red Sox. In 2006, the potential of the song as a rally cry gained the attention of Iowa State University’s Cyclones football team. Two years later University of Pittsburgh adapted the song to their own purposes. They played ‘Sweet Caroline’ during the fourth quarter of Panthers home games. The fans would substitute “Let’s go Pitt” in place of the famous “Ba ba ba.” The school has since added to everything from additional sporting events to alumni events and commencement ceremonies. Still in Pennsylvania, Penn State University also used the song off and on in the 2000s, but it stopped temporarily in 2012 while the school was in the throes of the child sex abuse scandal. It was felt that the “touching me, touching you” line was a little disturbing in light of the allegations and eventual convictions. ‘Sweet Caroline’ was reinstated a year later though. The power of the Neil Diamond classic even made its way into the Ultimate Fighting Championships as fighter Darren Till used it as his entrance song during a UFC Fight Night.\n\nTo no one’s surprise, the Library of Congress selected ‘Sweet Caroline’ for preservation in the National Recording Registry for being historically, culturally or aesthetically significant.\n\nBefore I get to today’s cover versions, here is a video of Neil Diamond performing ‘Sweet Caroline’ on the Ed Sullivan Show late in 1969.\n\nThe following year Elvis Presley got in on the act and added ‘Sweet Caroline’ to his vast live repertoire.\n\nI will jump forward a few decades and into a completely different genre. Here is Austrian singer DJ Otzi with his version that made it into the Austrian and German top 20.\n\nThis is fascinating. Here is James Corden with MIGOS. If you like this, watch the whole segment. Here they do their very own adaptation of ‘Sweet Caroline’. Tons of fun as always.\n\nDuring Covid-19 Neil Diamond created a parody of ‘Sweet Caroline’ in order to help people cope with what was to become the ‘new normal’.\n\nWhere it began, I can’t begin to know when\n\nBut then I know it’s growing strong\n\nWasn’t the spring\n\nAnd spring became the summer\n\nWho’d have believed you’d come along”\n\nNeil Diamond\n\nBetter days are ahead. In the meantime make the most of this day.\n\nToday’s version of Ted Tocks Covers is a classic example of how music evolves when artists have the vision to blend the best of two or more genres. In order to illustrate this point, I will focus on the legendary Ray Charles and his monumental song ‘I Got a Woman’. This classic R&B single owes its roots to a gospel song called ‘It Must Be Jesus’. In all of Ray Charles’ visionary wisdom, he adapted the presentation in order to pay homage to his ‘woman’. Here is a brief summary of how the song took shape before I move on to the most important element of this post…How ‘I Got a Woman’ continues to inspire musicians 75 years after its release.\n\nPicture this! Ray Charles and his band were traveling between gigs back in 1954 and this song comes on the radio.\n\n‘It Must Be Jesus’ spoke to Ray Charles in a way that went beyond enjoyment. He began to consider what could happen if he merged the gospel reverence to ‘Jesus’ and turned it into a more secular piece that paid tribute to a beautiful woman. With the help of his trumpet player, Renald Richard, Charles wrote ‘I Got a Woman’. Within this piece you get the gospel origin, a jazz inspired horn section and the beginning of what became Ray Charles signature R&B/soul sound. This became the template for a litany of classic Ray Charles songs. ‘I Got a Woman’ hit #1 on the R&B chart in January of 1955. The first of many for this cross genre/cross generation musical icon.\n\nI can’t really do justice to explaining how influential Ray Charles was, and is, as an artist. It has all been stated by many, more knowledgeable than me. For the purpose of today’s post, it should suffice to let the music do the talking. I will walk you through the decades and you can enjoy this musical feast. It is both jaw – dropping and awe inspiring.\n\nThe homage all begins with ‘The King’ himself; the great Elvis Presley. I was torn between a live version or this studio version from 1956. In studio Elvis added some rockabilly to the cross-genre presentation.\n\nContrast this to the live version which took on a more gospel tone, with the remarkable assistance of his backup singers. Another example of a song that sends chills up and down your spine.\n\nSo, where do we go from here?\n\nHow about Johnny Cash?\n\nTogether with the magnificent June Carter, they turn it into a mutual admiration piece. It changes the perspective, but it works so well.\n\nHere’s a version that made me sit up and smile. Let’s have Fred McDowell and Johnny Woods bring it all back to its blues roots. This is what its all about, because blues, jazz, R&B, gospel and soul are all interconnected. I could listen to this all day. Watch for more about Fred McDowell in future Ted Tocks. His story needs to be shared. He is a blues master who doesn’t get nearly enough credit, although the greatest artists of the last half century absolutely adore him.\n\nHere is a go-go delivery brought to us by the vocal prowess of The Everly Brothers. I just thought this provided an interesting scene with the dancers and the enthusiastic audience. It truly reflects the era.\n\nListen to this version by The Honeydrippers. Robert Plant has always acknowledged his musical roots when it comes to his astonishing vocal brilliance. For every great Robert Plant vocal performance this legendary vocalist could likely point to ten artists that inspired him. As amazing as he is, he has always been humble when it comes to his reverence for the singers who paved the way.\n\nTed Tocks Covers has a rule. If Tom Petty covered it, it will be featured. I miss Tom Petty. Another artist who always mentioned those who came before him. He never took all the credit, because he knew so much of what he became, was directly related to his influences.\n\nAnother clear example of music’s lineage is illustrated through this live tribute by the great Stevie Wonder. He turns ‘I Got a Woman’ into a revival. There is no doubt that Stevie Wonder was inspired by Ray Charles.\n\nTo close out today’s feature, here is John Mayer along with Steve Jordan on drums and Pino Paladino on bass. We all know John Mayer as a versatile guitarist with a wide ranging resume of musical performance. He shines in this atmosphere. Steve Jordan is a highly sought after drummer who is recognized mostly for his role as drummer for the Saturday Night Live band and David Letterman’s Late Night band. He is also Keith Richards’ go to guy for his solo projects. Pino Paladino is an extraordinary bass player who is best known for taking over from John Entwistle in The Who.\n\nHaving said all of this, it should be noted that the original lyrics do not really stand the test of time.\n\nWell, I got a woman, way over town\n\nThat’s good to me, oh yeah\n\nSaid I got a woman, way over town\n\nGood to me, oh yeah\n\nShe gives me money when I’m in need\n\nYeah, she’s a kind of friend indeed\n\nI got a woman, way over town\n\nThat’s good to me, oh yeah\n\nShe saves her lovin’, early in the mornin’\n\nJust for me, oh yeah\n\nShe saves her lovin’, early in the mornin’\n\nJust for me, oh yeah\n\nShe saves her lovin’, just for me\n\nAh, she, loves me, so tenderly\n\nI got a woman, way over town\n\nThat’s good to me, oh yeah\n\nShe’s there to love me\n\nBoth day and night\n\nNever grumbles or fusses\n\nAlways treats me right\n\nNever runnin’ in the streets\n\nLeavin’ me alone\n\nShe knows a woman’s place\n\nIs right there, now, in her home\n\nI got a woman, way over town\n\nThat’s good to me, oh yeah\n\nSay I got a woman, way over town\n\nThat’s good to me, oh yeah\n\nOh, she’s my baby, don’t you understand\n\nYeah, I’m her lovin’ man, now\n\nI got a woman, way over town\n\nThat’s good to me, oh yeah\n\nWell, don’t you know she’s all right\n\nWell, don’t you know she’s all right\n\nShe’s all right, she’s all right\n\nRay Charles and Renald Richard\n\nShe knows a woman’s place\n\nIs right there, now, in her home.”\n\nRay Charles and Renald Richard\n\nClearly, this line is a little troubling in 2020. This is not lost on me. This post is mostly about the music. Music inspires change. Hopefully we can continue to move forward as a society. This cannot be done unless we truly understand our past. If we take the good, and eliminate the bad, we can only see better days ahead.\n\nIn the meantime…listen to the music play…\n\nDid you know ‘tutti frutti’ means all fruits in Italian?\n\n‘Tutti Frutti’ was written by Little Richard and Dorothy LaBostrie sixty four years ago. It became Little Richard’s first hit record. The song is defined by Little Richard’s opening shout of “A-wop-bop-a-loo-mop-a-lop-bom-boom.” When Little Richard belted out this line, he was attempting to simulate the song’s drum pattern. This line came to symbolize not only Little Richard’s style but also rock and roll. Yes, the song is that important.\n\nVolume – Check\n\nCommanding vocal performance – Check\n\nDistinctive beat – Check\n\nLyrics with a sexual connotation – Check\n\nAttitude – Check\n\nThe song is so important to rock and roll that it was selected as the #1 song on Mojo Magazines list of The Top 100 Songs that Changed the World. This is not some run of the mill list. The selection committee consisted of an array of artists including: Tom Waits, Tori Amos, Brian Wilson and Steve Earle.\n\nPerhaps the best line describing ‘Tutti Frutti’ and its impact was provided by the U.S. Library of Congress National Recording Registry when the song was added to its registry.\n\n“‘Tutti Frutti’s unique vocalizing over the irresistible beat announced a new era in music.”\n\nThe U.S. Library of Congress National Recording Registry\n\n“A-wop-bop-a-loo-mop-a-lop-bom-boom” was described as the most inspired lyric.\n\nBriefly, it should be noted that ‘Little Richard’ Penniman was not an overnight success. He had been recording since 1951 but the results were not a commercial success. By 1955 Little Richard was looking for a new opportunity. He sent a demo to Specialty Records and the company’s owner, Art Lupe liked what he heard. This opened the door to a recording session with Fats Dominos’ backing band and a production team led by Robert ‘Bumps’ Blackwell. The band included the great Huey ‘Piano’ Smith on piano. (See Rockin’ Pneumonia and the Boogie Woogie Flu).\n\nThe recording session that led to ‘Tutti Frutti’ was not going well and Little Richard was frustrated. During a lunch break Richard began playing a song he claims to have written while working as a janitor in a bus station. It was an overtly sexual lyric that jumped out at Robert Blackwell.\n\n“A-wop-bom-a-loo-mop-a-lomp-bom-bom!\n\nTutti Frutti, good booty.”\n\nLittle Richard\n\nHe also knew that the song would have to be modified if it was to get radio airplay. Enter Dorothy LaBostrie. She worked with Little Richard to revise the lyrics while maintaining the melody. The ultimate result was:\n\n“Tutti Frutti, aw rooty\n\nTutti Frutti, aw rooty.”\n\nLittle Richard and Dorothy LaBostrie\n\nIt is not a stretch to see that this translates to “all fruit, all right”. In a biblical sense this could translate to ‘forbidden fruit’. Think of the implications. Homosexuality in the deep south in the 1950s was definitely not an open discussion. The original lyrics and the underlying theme of the song could speak to homosexual relations.\n\n“Tutti Frutti, good booty\n\nIf it don’t fit, don’t force it\n\nYou can grease it, make it easy”\n\nLittle Richard\n\nOr\n\nTutti Frutti, good booty\n\nIf it’s tight, it’s all right\n\nAnd if it’s greasy, it makes it easy\n\nLittle Richard\n\nDorothy LaBostrie disputes this sexual origin. She claims she saw the ‘Tutti Frutti’ ice cream flavor in a drug store and thought the name would make a great idea for a song. She then went to the studio and wrote ‘Tutti Frutti’, ‘I’m Just a Lonely Guy’ and ‘Blessed Mother’ in one day. It is clear that her contribution was significant. The question comes down to whether one focuses on the superficial or underlying message. LaBostrie received royalty cheques as a co-writer of the song until her death in 2007.\n\nFor his part, Little Richard is a very complicated character. He was ‘born again’ in 1957 and became an ordained minister in 1970. On a positive note he spoke of uniting the races and bringing lost souls to repentance through God’s love. His history is a long and convoluted series of issues related to self-doubt and charges related to his sexual conduct. In his 1984 biography he listed himself as ‘omnisexual’ and on occasion he has denounced homosexuality, calling it an “unnatural affection” that goes against the way God wants you to live.” Like I said, the man is complicated. He is even on record as stating that rock and roll exists in direct conflict with living a good life. Like many evangelists, his hypocrisy knows no bounds and the reality of his life and what he preaches from the pulpit are often, two different things.\n\nFor today’s cover versions I had a plethora of options.\n\nFirst, it is natural that Pat Boone covered ‘Tutti Frutti’ because he made a career out of ripping off the original artists. (See ‘Long Tall Sally’)\n\nOf course. Elvis covered ‘Tutti Frutti’. A great version.\n\nNot to be outdone, Carl Perkins recorded his own version in 1958. Many artists of the day would follow the success of a specific recording in order to capitalize on the gravy train. Some just did it better than others. Carl Perkins did everything well.\n\nMC5 covered ‘Tutti Frutti’ in 1970. Their name often comes up in discussions about influential bands from this era.\n\nHere is a great version from Buckwheat Zydeco in 1988. This may be the best version from a musical standpoint.\n\nTo close out today’s post here is a fun version from The California Raisins who got in on the act, also in 1988. I love this. What a way to close out."
