He was 64.\n\nEdwards had collapsed earlier this month in Denver while on tour with singer-songwriter Karla Bonoff, a longtime musical partner.\n\nHe was hospitalized in Denver, then air-lifted to a hospital near his home in Santa Barbara, where he died.\n\n“He was always a beacon to me,” Ronstadt said Thursday. “He introduced me to so much stuff, and his opinion always counted a lot to me.”\n\nShe credited Edwards with creating the musical framework for her only No. 1 single, “You’re No Good,” in 1974.\n\nLater, Edwards teamed with singer-songwriter Wendy Waldman, Karla Bonoff and Andrew Gold to form the folk-rock band Bryndle.\n\nBarely out of high school, he formed the Stone Poneys in 1965 with Bobby Kimmel, a Tucson musician who had moved to Los Angeles to explore the burgeoning folk-rock scene.\n\nSend questions/comments to the editors."
