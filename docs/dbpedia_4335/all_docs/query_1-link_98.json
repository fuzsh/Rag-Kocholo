        "text": "Bass players never seem to get the proper respect. Randy Meisner suffered that fate as much as any of them. But from being a founding member of The Eagles, being there during the early formations of country rock…\n\n“Sweet Western Sound” will be very effective for what it was designed to do: win Grammy Awards. For Tanya Tucker, and Brandi Carlile. And when it does it will be hard to argue against, because its brilliant moments unquestionably soar.\n\nIn the founding era of country rock, guitarist Tom Leadon was right there witnessing and participating in some of the most important moments and projects. He just happened to be overshadowed in many respects by the bigger names that country rock would launch.\n\nA pretty universal consensus from the country fans who did suffer through the presentation to see the extended Alan Jackson tribute at the end was that in 2022, the CMA Awards seemed to do a 180-degree turn, and started going back in the right direction toward featuring more actual country music.\n\nLuke Combs said it best while accepting the trophy for Entertainer of the Year Wednesday night (11-9) at the 2022 CMA Awards: “This is my fifth or sixth year being at this awards show, and country sounded more country than it has in a long time tonight.” In truth, the CMA Awards righting the ship goes back even further.\n\nJody Miller passed away on October 6th in Blanchard, Oklahoma due to complications from Parkinson’s Disease. She was 80 years old. First signed to Capitol Records as a folk artist in 1962, Jody Miller’s contributions spanned multiple genres, including pop, folk, country, and eventually Gospel.\n\nA recent petition launched to coincide with Freddy Fender’s birthday, and subsequent media reporting, has stimulated a healthy amount of discussion about the prospects for Freddy Fender being inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame.\n\nThe Tucson Music Hall in downtown Tucson on Church Street will be renamed for Linda Ronstadt on May 7th. Built in 1971, the 2,289-capacity venue is part of the great Convention Center complex, and is in the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nIt’s that time of year again to consider who might be in the running for the precious few spots as the newest inductees into the Country Music Hall of Fame. A secret committee commissioned by the CMA is going over their final ballots and whittling down the names.\n\nThere are few tours that are more legendary to the history of country music than the six-week tour that Gram Parsons embarked on in 1973 behind his album GP. Yes, there were certainly bigger tours with higher grossing receipts, or tours that featured a more scintillating lineup.\n\nohn Prine was the big winner posthumously from the 2021 Grammy Awards and the Premier Ceremony that takes place before the proper telecast. Taking home two Grammy Awards, both for his final recorded song, “I Remember Everything,” he became the most awarded artist from the roots.\n\nIt’s that time of year again to consider who might be in the running for the precious few spots as the newest inductees into the Country Music Hall of Fame. A secret committee commissioned by the CMA is going over their final ballots and whittling down the names to the few who will make it.\n\nThe Grammy Awards have announced their annual inductions into the Grammy Hall of Fame, and a few of them have deep ties to country music, including “The Gambler” by Kenny Rogers, as well as Dolly Parton, Emmylou Harris, and Linda Ronstadt in “Trio.”\n\nThe 2021 Grammy Award nominees were announced on Tuesday (11/24), and as can be expected, there is some good, some bad, many worthy nominations, a few probably born of virtue signaling as you can expect. But overall, it’s about par for the course.\n\nTo many, David Olney is the songwriter who lost consciousness mid performance at the 30A Songwriters Festival last weekend and passed away in a poetic manner. Some knew of him before hearing the compelling story, and many didn’t. But to the folk and songwriting community, David Olney was a pillar of the craft, and a close friend.\n\nIt’s the often-used cliche to say someone died while doing what they love. For some, it’s a dream they wish upon. For David Olney, it was a reality. “Olney was in the middle of his third song when he stopped, apologized, and shut his eyes. He was very still, sitting upright with his guitar on…”\n\nChris Darrow, multi-instrumentalist, singer and songwriter, country rock pioneer and member of multiple influential bands including the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band and The Corvettes who backed up Linda Ronstadt, has passed away according to his representatives. He was 75-years-old. He was a centerpiece of country rock.\n\nNot as a rebuke of the work of the documentary, but as an addendum for those who watched and might want to dig deeper into the history of country through some of its more important personalities not represented well in the film, here are some of the Country Music film’s biggest oversights.\n\n“Linda could literally sing anything,” Country music legend Dolly Parton says in the recently-released trailer for the film (see below). Dolly performed with Linda along with Emmylou Harris in the award-winning country supergroup, Trio. “When we heard our voices, it was light a high you’ve never felt.”\n\nThe upcoming Linda Ronstadt documentary called Linda Ronstadt: The Sound of My Voice will soon be headed to a theater (hopefully) near you. Produced in part by CNN Films, there was at least the notion the film might be broadcast on the cable news station only. But Greenwich Entertainment and 1091 have co-acquired the North […]\n\nIn a curiously under-reported story, country music music icon and now Rock & Roll Hall of Famer Linda Ronstadt is the subject of an upcoming documentary biopic directed by two award-winning filmmakers that will be making its worldwide debut at the Tribeca Film Festival on April 26th. It’s called ‘The Sound of My Voice.’\n\nLinda Ronstadt may not be able to sing anymore due to a Parkinson’s Disease diagnosis in 2013. But she can still talk and speak her mind, and that exactly what she did in a recent interview with Rolling Stone when prompted to discuss her influence on pop, rock, and country music—all of which she dabbled with in her career."
