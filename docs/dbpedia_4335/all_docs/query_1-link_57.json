        "text": "LINDA RONSTADT is a musician born in 1946, and raised in and around Tucson, Arizona. She’s had a #1 song in the U.S. (“You’re No Good”) has had 21 singles in the Top Ten, has sung rock, country and even light opera, won 10 Grammies for her music, an Emmy for a TV performance, released 24 albums and since 2014 has been in the Rock’n’Roll Hall of Fame. She’s sold 100 million records and made famous versions of songs like “Desperado,” “Willin’” and “Blue Bayou.”\n\nHer surname is from her great-grandfather Friedrich August Ronstadt, a mining engineer from Hanover, Germany who came to the Southwest in the 1840’s, married into a Mexican family and renamed himself Federico Augusto Ronstadt.\n\nHis son and Linda’s grandfather, Federico Jose Maria Ronstadt, was a well-known cattle rancher, wagon-maker, and bandleader in Tucson. He had only a seventh grade education, and being a rancher in the desert is always a struggle, but he built beautiful wagons, luxury wagons for the wealthy or for those trying to make an impression.\n\nAnd in the days before the radio was everywhere, his band played at weddings and funerals and military parades, or for anyone who wanted a fancy hired serenade for their sweetheart. Federico played the flute, and arranged songs from Gilbert & Sullivan’s “The Pirates of Penzance.” He and his wife lived just a few hundred yards away from Linda and her family, and as a girl Linda walked to her grandparents’ house and listened to 78’s on their old Victrola of arias from great operas: La Boheme, Madame Butterfly, La Traviata.\n\nGrowing up around Tucson in the 1950’s, Linda was surrounded by music. She drank in Mexican as well as American culture. Her older brother Pete was a boy soprano soloist with the Tucson Arizona Boys Chorus. Her sister Suzy liked Hank Williams weepers. Her little brother Mike played the double bass.\n\nRanchers on her father’s side of the family had been in the Mexican state of Sonora since the 1500’s. Linda’s parents made sure that she understood that her family had stayed put; it was the border that had changed. Mexicans were not foreigners in the Southwest; they were natives.\n\nHer father made a living running a hardware store but also sang Mexican country music: cowboy songs called rancheras; story songs called corridos; and mysterious songs from the Mexican mountains called huapangos. He gave Linda the intriguing rhythms of mariachi music. She learned Mexican phrasing.\n\nHer father had a lovely old guitar made in 1898, and would get out that guitar at 10 or 11 o’clock at night, when guests were over. He’d play and sing in a resonant voice, a voice a little like Sinatra’s, and when she was little, Linda would often fall asleep in his lap hearing that voice.\n\nDays were informal for the Ronstadt kids, with little supervision. Linda played with clay, created her own toys and games. Late in the 1960’s, she noticed little children playing with Legos, brightly colored pieces of plastic that snapped together. She was appalled by how sterile and predictable and ready-made it all was. There were even little maps included in Lego sets which told the children what to build. Linda also hated modern architecture and she developed a theory that modern architects were kids who’d grown up playing with Legos, and were still aping its simplistic shapes.\n\nLinda’s mother was mostly raised in Michigan, an inventor’s daughter. His mind was fertile and he invented a popular thermostat and also the electric toaster. But he never made much money from his inventions and spent most of the money he did make trying to figure a way to cure his wife of Parkinson’s Disease. That was one invention that eluded him — the one he wanted most.\n\nThe Ronstadts were living a rough-and-ready sort of life in Arizona, but Linda’s mother had grown up in places more proper than the desert outside Tucson, and so alongside of the desert informality and Mexican influence that Linda absorbed, she also learned from her mother that a woman is always respectable. A woman wears a hat and gloves, gets married if she can and always finds ways to be useful.\n\nLinda could always sing beautifully; that came naturally. Staying on pitch across a wide vocal register, remembering the words and phrasings of a large number of songs, picking out harmonies… all those things were just in her, she never had to think about any of it.\n\nBeing on stage and getting used to being looked at by an audience was harder, but she mastered that, too. Linda, her brothers Pete and Mike and her sister Suzy made Mexican music together. After hearing the folk music duo Bud & Travis play in Tucson, playing both Mexican and American stuff, Linda and some friends started a band, the New Union Ramblers, and played folk music around Tucson, both in English and Spanish. But none of this was competitive; it was relaxed, something to pass the time, and bring pleasure to themselves and to small audiences.\n\nPete Ronstadt stopped focusing on music, became a cop and, ultimately chief of police in Tucson. Suzy had a bunch of kids, and decided she couldn’t go on the road. Linda was the only one of the Ronstadt children to try to make music a career. In 1964, just 18 years old, she moved to Los Angeles, wanting to be a professional singer, but with almost no idea how. She put off telling her parents she was going until the night she was leaving, and they were shocked and angry. When her father saw that she’d made up her mind, he left the room. He returned with his beautiful guitar from 1898, and gave it to her.\n\nIn Los Angeles she found her way into a professional group, the Stone Poneys. They weren’t making big money, and she was just one of the band, but they had a manager and a record label. Both the manager and the record label had a much better idea than Linda did of how to make money in the music business, but these commercial ideas often clashed with Linda’s notion that music should be an honest, fair-minded collaboration.\n\nFor instance, Linda heard the song “Different Drum” and in 1967 recorded it with the Stone Poneys. It was a bluegrass-tinged version of the song, with guitar and mandolin. Linda’s manager and the record label liked her vocals but asked her to record it again with a new arrangement. When she arrived at the recording studio the song not only had a different arrangement; the other Stone Poneys had been replaced by session musicians she’d never seen before.\n\nShe loved “Different Drum” and knew the song in her bones, but when it was time to sing it for a record company, the new musicians and new arrangement threw her. She sang it with a lot of self-doubt. But it’s a song about a woman full of doubt about a man, and somehow it worked. She felt she’d failed the vocal, but the song became a minor hit. This did wonders for her confidence and gave her some leverage in the music business, but it launched her as a solo act, which hadn’t been her original idea.\n\nHow to dress on stage was something that bothered her as a young performer. There were so many poses that female singers used and none of them seemed quite right to her. Earth mother… rock ’n’ roll mama… solemn folkie… party girl. When she performed at Disneyland, she got paid very well but they had strict rules about how short a woman’s skirt could be. The dress code was silly but at least it simplified the question of how to dress for a show.\n\nHer 1970 solo album Silk Purse featured the lovely song “Long, Long Time” and radio play earned her some new fans.\n\nShe always thought the sex, drugs and rock ’n’ roll mythology of musicians was overdone. Sure, sex and drugs were available for traveling musicians, but the road was a grind, performing at night made sleep hard to come by and the musicians who lasted tended to take care of their bodies, souls and spirits. She found that reading good books and knitting were very helpful for bringing a sense of continuity to the scattered quality of the road.\n\nOne day she was reading “Heart of Darkness” by Joseph Conrad, and Conrad observed that, despite their reputation, sailors are very provincial people. Sure they sail the world, he wrote, but nearly all of that time is spent on the boat with a small number of comrades. Harbors are much the same the world over, with taverns and brothels that offer only fleeting company. And Linda thought: ‘It’s the same with musicians! We go all over the place, but mostly just with the other guys in the band. It’s the bus, the hotel room, backstage at the arena, the show, the bus, the hotel room again. A provincial life.\n\nShe wanted more. She’d set out to make a decent living as a singer in a music group; she’d done that. Then she’d decided to become a headliner and she’d succeeded at that. She was making good money but feeling constricted by the choices being made for her by her manager and people at her record label.\n\nThen one day she heard Emmy Lou Harris sing, and was blown away — not just by the quality of her voice, but by the range of her songs. She was intrigued that Emmy Lou Harris seemed content to be a “minor star” so long as she could choose her own material. Ronstadt had to decide: Am I going to be jealous of Emmy Lou Harris at a distance, or should I try to befriend her? She chose to extend a hand of friendship and the two became dear friends. Quietly, Emmy Lou Harris urged her to push back at the record company, to insist on recording and releasing certain songs that she believed in.\n\nLinda loved the music of Canadians Joni Mitchell, Neil Young, Leonard Cohen, Gordon Lightfoot. “Heart Like a Wheel” was a song by a Canadian group, Kate & Anna McGarrigle which Linda first heard as a demo. The demo had storytelling and sentiment beautifully refined, as if it were recorded in a chapel. Ronstadt’s manager called the song corny and precious but Ronstadt insisted on recording “Heart Like a Wheel,” covered it beautifully and titled her next album “Heart Like a Wheel.” She used a simple arrangement, with piano and fiddle, and wove emotion through the song, sometimes letting go, at other points holding back.\n\nThat album also included a lovely version of Paul Anka’s “I Guess It Doesn’t Matter Anymore” and the Hank Williams tune “I Can’t Help It If I’m Still in Love with You.” Two of Linda’s more popular later albums were Simple Dreams and Living in the U.S.A. With strong production, excellent session musicians and a record company behind them, these albums sold very well.\n\nWith the leverage she had, Ronstadt insisted on releasing an album of musical standards, with Nelson Riddle arrangements, and an album of Mexican songs.\n\nIn 1975, millions of people got used to hearing Linda sing “You’re no good, you’re no good, you’re no good… baby you’re no good. I’m going to say it again…!” Actually, she liked men; it was marriage that didn’t interest her. Serial monogamy was her style. She admired people in long, happy marriages but she knew that a good marriage needs compromise and she was never a good compromiser. The touring life was stressful enough; being in a marriage seemed like more than she could handle. Besides, many of her favorite Mexican songs were about women who had misplaced their affection, trusted men too much.\n\nDuring one TV special in which Linda was performing, late in the evening, one of the top executives from the show invited himself into her hotel room, and removed all of his clothes. She went down to the lobby and called her manager. He told her firmly “Don’t say anything. They might kick you off the show.” Tired, eager to sleep, she sat fuming in the hotel lobby for several hours before summoning the courage to return to her hotel room. The creep was gone.\n\nAround the year 2000, Ronstadt began to show symptoms of progressive supranuclear palsy, and it ended her career early. For the first time in her life, she had to worry about how to hit the notes, and how to stay on pitch. She didn’t have the muscle control to sing to her own standard. She made her last album in 2004 and did her last live show in 2009, at the age of 63. By then she had trouble walking, and she’d lost the ability to knit, which had helped her pass endless hours on the road, and in between shows.\n\nBut she’s done an excellent job of living her new life. She has never succumbed to self-pity. She wrote Simple Dreams: A Musical Memoir. “Everything comes in its season,” she says. She smiles and adds: “I had a long time at the trough.” She is still trying to be useful."
