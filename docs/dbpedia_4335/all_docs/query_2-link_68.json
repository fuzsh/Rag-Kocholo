        "text": "Holly (Bailey) Aprecio was raised in musical theater.Â Since age 6, she has performed in both lead and supporting roles in classics such as Annie, Peter Pan, The Sound of Music, Into the Woods, Miracle on 34th Street, Grease, and many more.Â By age 18, she was also performing in local band, About Face and has written and recorded her own music.Â When she is not on stage singing anything from show tunes to rock n roll, she is a professional photographer and busy mother of 4 young children!\n\nARNY BAILEY\n\nMulti-Instrumentalist and lead vocalist, Arny has performed with About Face, The Rockafellers, and Tribute acts Borrowed Time: The Music of Styx, The Grand Delusion and Highway Run (Styx and Journey), and WingsNThings: The Music of Paul McCartney. Arny has now assembled Just One Look's great group of musicians to pay tribute to the leading female vocalist of the 1970s.\n\nMARC MONTAGNINO\n\nMarc has been involved in the Seattle Music Scene for over 20 years, contributing his drumming and talents towards a multitude of local bands including Beyond the Fringe, Max Axle, WingsNThings: The Music of Paul McCartney, and Tony LaStella's Wise Guys. His ability to play a huge variety of drumming styles as well as his vocalist abilities has earned Marc a successful place in the local music industry as one of Seattle's most versatile and talented drummers.\n\nJOHN PARADES\n\nOriginally from Los Angeles, with first influences by 70âs artists such as Bob James, ELP, Jean-Michele Jarre and Vangelis, John started with early synthesizer compositions leading him to work as a session synthesist and keyboardist for popular Los Angeles-based recording studios from the late 80âs to the mid-90's, working on pop albums as well as mainstream film trailers while attending CalArts for Digital Music Composition. Since moving to Seattle in 2006 with his family John has been heavily involved in the Tribute scene, like performing with groups like , Petty Thief (Tom Petty), Kings Of Hollywood (Eagles), American Fool (John Mellencamp), Just One Look (Linda Ronstadt), Wildflower (Sheryl Crow), Rear View Mirror (60âs), American Vinyl (70's show band), The Harvest Moon Band (Neil Young), Reckless (Bryan Adams), Wasted On The Way (CSNY), Feelin' Alright (Joe Cocker), Bell Bottom Blues (Eric Clapton), and Taylor Made (James Taylor).\n\nMARTIN RUSH\n\nMartin has been playing bass guitar since his older brother gave him his firstÂ oneÂ back in grade school. After learning all the current rock classics of the time, he movedÂ on to jazz, country, funk, and pit work for theater. With a well-rounded style-background andÂ a solid groove, he is gaining a reputation as a premiere working bassist in theÂ Seattle area for groups such as Black Velvet 4, Second Hand Newz, Blue Madness, Test Run,Â and RootSeller, to name a few.\n\nKARL HAUG\n\nThe Piano lessons his parents made him take never went over well with Karl. But as a teenager, he started borrowing his sister's guitar and the fun began. Karl has performed solo on his acoustic guitar, played mandolin in duos and played both acoustic and electric guitar in an assortment of rock, folk, and blues bands. Working with these bands and recording a number of CDs has helped him develop a unique style of playing and singing."
