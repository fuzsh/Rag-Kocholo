        "text": "“When I think back on all the crap I learned in high school, It’s a wonder I can think at all, and though my lack of education hasn’t hurt me none, I can read the writing on the wall.” Opening lyrics of “Kodachrome” written by Paul Simon (1973).\n\nIt was early June 1973: I was driving to my Glenvar High School graduation ceremony and I heard “Kodachrome” from Paul Simon being played on Top 40 WROV 1240 AM Roanoke, Virginia. It was a perfect song for my listening ears, as I was transitioning from life as a high school student into new life adventures as a young adult.\n\nAs I reflect back on the 50 years since I completed high school, I am remembering the music from my youth. With this music blog message, I will be counting down what I consider to be my favorite top 40 hits from 1973.\n\nThe number 1 song on the Billboard Hot 100 the day I graduated from high school was “My Love” by Paul McCartney & Wings.”\n\nI have fond memories of listening to top 40 radio in 1973. It was the year I turned 18 and started my freshman year at Virginia Western Community College.\n\nDuring daylight hours, I exclusively listened to Roanoke’s legendary WROV 1240 AM. This station featured a Top 40 format and was the number one top-ranked radio outlet in my city.\n\nAudio Aircheck of Larry Bly WROV Roanoke April 1973. Courtesy of WROV History Website/Pat Garrett\n\nBart Prater and Larry Bly were my two favorite WROV DJs back in 1973. When WROV reduced power at sundown, I would listen to 3 top 40 AM radio stations located hundreds of miles away from my Virginia home.\n\nAudio Aircheck of Bart Prater WROV Roanoke May 1973. Courtesy of WROV History Website/Pat Garrett\n\nAfter sundown, I would tune into three 50,000-watt clear channel AM stations: WLS 890 AM Chicago, WCFL 1000 AM (Super CFL) and WABC 770 AM New York.\n\nFor my countdown of ’73 superfine singles, I used two sources in my calculation for the biggest records in this category: Billboard and Cash Box magazines’ year-end top 100 singles charts for 1973.\n\nAs I surveyed the prominent hits from 50 years ago, the countdown is entirely based on my opinions. My selections are songs that I deem to be culturally, historically, aesthetically significant, meaningful or relevant.\n\nAn interesting fact that I learned when researching this topic: Billboard and Cash Box year-end charts both agreed on the biggest two hits for 1973:\n\n1 TIE A YELLOW RIBBON ROUND THE OLE OAK TREE – Tony Orlando & Dawn\n\n2 BAD, BAD LEROY BROWN – Jim Croce\n\nBefore I start my countdown of superfine singles, I want to share 10 of my favorite songs that were not ranked by either Cash Box or Billboard on their top 100 year-end charts for 1973.\n\nPieces of April—Three Dog Night\n\nPeaceful Easy Feeling—Eagles\n\nChina Grove—The Doobie Brothers\n\nOver the Hills and Far Away—Led Zeppelin\n\nWe May Never Pass this Way Again—Seals and Crofts\n\nKnockin’ on Heaven’s Door—Bob Dylan\n\nRocky Mountain Way—Joe Walsh\n\nLiving in the Past—Jethro Tull\n\nTequila Sunrise—Eagles\n\nI’m Just a Singer (In a Rock and Roll Band)—The Moody Blues\n\nNext up are songs I considered for the 1973 countdown but fell outside my top 25 selections.

Single is ranked at #92 on Billboard Magazines “Greatest Songs of All Time” listing.\n\nLyrics are brilliant as she describes her narcissistic lover. In real life, Simon says that her song is actually about 3 men. However, fifty years later, she remains secretive about revealing the identity of these fellow.\n\nI consider this masterpiece as one of the best epic story songs from the 70s. Without a doubt, “You’re So Vain” by Carly Simon is my number 1 best single for 1973.\n\nThat wraps up what I consider to be my favorite and best top 40 hits for 1973. I completely understand that my listing of songs in this category was written from my point of view and is subjective.\n\nIf you were creating a similar register of excellent 1973 hits, your tabulation may be totally different. What do you consider to be best preeminent singles from ’73? I hope you will comment below.\n\nListening to music from the golden age of Top 40 radio will always have a special place in my heart. I still cherish and fondly remember my favorite superfine singles of 1973. Rock on!\n\nTo subscribe to my blog via email, please click the “Follow” button in the menu above.\n\nBack by popular demand, this is my latest installment with the topic of one hit wonders. I continue to be amazed by the popularity of this subject matter, as it brings back nostalgic memories for many folks.\n\nOver the past 3 years, I have published one hit wonders messages from years 1968 through 1972. These articles are among my most viewed messages of all-time.\n\nWith this latest edition of musical musings, I am concentrating on the best “one hit wonders” from 1973. I will be counting down the top songs in this category from 50 years ago.\n\nI have fond memories of listening to top 40 music from 1973 as it is the year that I graduated from Glenvar High School in Roanoke County Virginia. Then in September ’73, I started my freshman year at Virginia Western Community College, located in Roanoke.\n\nDuring daylight hours, I exclusively listened to Roanoke’s legendary WROV 1240 AM. This station featured a Top 40 format and was the number 1 top-ranked radio outlet in my city.\n\nAudio aircheck of Terry Young WROV Roanoke May 1973. Courtesy WROV History Website/Pat Garrett.\n\nThe WROV DJs that I remember back in 1973 were Larry Bly, Bart Prater, Terry Young, Shane Randall and Chuck Holloway. When WROV reduced power at sundown, I would listen to top 40 AM radio stations located hundreds of miles away from my Virginia home.\n\nAudio aircheck of Larry Bly WROV Roanoke April 1973. Courtesy WROV History Website/Pat Garrett.\n\n50,000-watt WLS 890 AM Chicago, WCFL 1000 AM (Super CFL) and WABC 770 AM New York were my top three choices for nighttime listening 50 years ago.\n\nIn Chicago, I remember WLS DJs John Records Landecker, JJ Jeffries and Fred Winton, while Larry Lujack, Bob Dearborn and Ron O’Brien were superb on Super CFL. Cousin Brucie (Morrow) and Dan Ingram were radio announcing legends at WABC New York.\n\nSome other powerful radio stations that I occasionally heard in ’73: WOWO Fort Wayne 1190 AM, CKLW Windsor, Ontario (Detroit) 800 AM and WKBW Buffalo 1520 AM.\n\nWhat exactly is a “One Hit Wonder?” The basic definition: An artist has only one hit song on the national Billboard Hot 100 pop chart during their career. This music blog message pertains solely to hit songs within the United States.\n\nTo avoid any confusion, here are the criteria that I am using to define a one hit wonder:\n\nNo other songs from an artist ever peaking at number 40 or higher on the Billboard National Pop Chart. (Chart positions from number 40 to number 1).\n\nOne hit wonders vary from country to country. An artist may have just one hit in the United States but may have multiple hits in another country.\n\nRegional hits are not taken into account: A second song must be a national hit and chart within the Billboard Top 40 pop survey.\n\nSingles that peak from numbers 41 through 100 on the national Billboard Hot 100 pop chart are generally not considered as a second hit. Example: a 2nd song peaking at number 87 does not constitute an artist as a two-hit-wonder.\n\nAll documentation of chart positions I share below in this article comes from The Billboard Book of Top 40 Hits by Joel Whitburn. I proudly own a hard copy of this excellent reference manual, which I consider to be the ‘bible” handbook for music history with Top 40 radio.\n\nAs a point of reference, below are the top 10 biggest records of 1973. None of these artists are one hit wonders as they all had multiple top 40 hits.\n\n1 “Tie a Yellow Ribbon Round the Ole Oak Tree” Tony Orlando and Dawn\n\n2 “Bad, Bad Leroy Brown” Jim Croce\n\n3 “Killing Me Softly with His Song” Roberta Flack\n\n4 “Let’s Get It On” Marvin Gaye\n\n5 “My Love” Paul McCartney & Wings\n\n6 “Why Me” Kris Kristofferson\n\n7 “Crocodile Rock” Elton John\n\n8 “Will It Go Round in Circles” Billy Preston\n\n9 “You’re So Vain” Carly Simon\n\n10 “Touch Me in the Morning” Diana Ross\n\nBefore starting my countdown with the best 1973 one hit wonders, I must clear up some Internet erroneous information that some proclaim on this topic. The band Stealers Wheel is actually a “TWO-HIT WONDER.”\n\nStealers Wheel was a Scottish rock band formed by Gerry Rafferty and Joe Egan is 1972. The group’s well-known hit “Stuck in the Middle with You” peaked at #6 on the Billboard Hot 100 during the spring of 1973.\n\nA second hit single for Stealers Wheel was “Star.” This highly acclaimed song also charted on the Billboard Hot 100, reaching #29 in March 1974.\n\nAdditional 1973 one hit wonders. Notable outside my countdown.\n\nPlayground in My Mind—Clint Holmes\n\nWalk on the Wild Side—Lou Reed\n\nSoul Makossa—Manu Dibango\n\nLove Jones—Brighter Side of Darkness\n\nArmed and Extremely Dangerous—First Choice\n\nSmoke Gets in Your Eyes—Blue Haze\n\nIn the Midnight Hour—Cross Country\n\nBack When My Hair Was Short—Gunhill Road\n\nWithout further ado, the countdown begins with 1973 groovy one hit wonders.\n\n15.

Brother Louie—Stories\n\nPeak Positions on Billboard Charts: #1 Hot 100, 13th Biggest Song of 1973\n\nHot Chocolate band members Errol Brown and Tony Wilson co-wrote “Brother Louie” and had an early ’73 U.K. hit with their song.

Lawrence was also an actress/comedian, who played the character “Mama” on the Carol Burnett TV show. One of the best country pop epic story songs from the 70s.\n\n2. Wildflower—Skylark\n\nPeak Positions on Billboard Charts: #9 Hot 100, 25th Biggest Song of 1973\n\nCanadian pop/rock band. Reached #1 in Canada during 1972. Since the song was not available in the US as a single, Top 40 CKLW Windsor, Ontario, which is part of the Detroit, Michigan radio market, started playing “Wildflower” as an album track.\n\nThe song quickly became a hit in Detroit and was picked up by other top 40 stations in Michigan. Capitol Records then released the Skylark single in the US and it spent 21 weeks charting on the Billboard Hot 100. Folks all across North America loved the smooth vocals by lead singer Donny Gerard on this outstanding power ballad.\n\n1. Dancing in the Moonlight—King Harvest\n\nPeak Positions on Billboard Charts: #13 Hot 100, 36th Biggest Song of 1973\n\nWithout a doubt, “Dancing in the Moonlight” by King Harvest is my top selection as the best 1973 one hit wonder. It is an all-time favorite single for me.\n\nKing Harvest formed in 1970, while the band members were attending Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. “Dancing in the Moonlight” is actually a cover song, with the original recording by a band called Boffalongo.\n\nShortly after the chart success of “Dancing in the Moonlight” on the Billboard Hot 100, King Harvest’s recording label Perception Records went bankrupt. Left without a recording contact, the band membership started to fluctuate. Eventually, King Harvest called it quits in 1976.\n\nThe only top 40 hit for King Harvest is still popular here in 2023. Whenever I play this song at wedding receptions where I am hired as a DJ, folks still love to dance to this song. Without a doubt, “Dancing in the Moonlight” is my favorite and top one hit wonder for 1973.\n\nI completely understand that my listing of 1973 groovy one hit wonders was written from my point of view and is subjective. Obviously, I do not want to come across as authoritative with my critique.\n\nWhat do you consider to be the best one hit wonders from 1973? There are no right or wrong answers. I welcome your thoughts.\n\nListening to music from the golden age of Top 40 radio will always have a special place in my heart. I cherish and fondly remember my favorite “one hit wonders” of 1973. Rock on!\n\nTo subscribe to my blog via email, please click the “Follow” button in the menu above.\n\n“Wanna see my picture on the cover\n\n(Stone) Wanna buy five copies for my mother (Yes)\n\n(Stone) Wanna see my smilin’ face\n\nOn the cover of the Rollin’ Stone (That’s a very very good idea)”\n\nOK: this message has absolutely nothing to do with Shel Silverstein’s written song, “The Cover of the Rolling Stone” that was a hit for Dr. Hook & the Medicine Show in 1973.\n\nMy latest music article actually is on the topic of superb cover songs that were popular during the golden age of top 40 radio. The time frame for these excellent remakes, ranges from 1965 through 1980.\n\nI will be featuring a countdown on what I consider to be 20 magnificent remakes of classic original songs. In most cases, the initial first version and the cover remix, are both equally-exceptional recordings.\n\nHere is my definition of a cover song: a new performance or recording by an artist other than the original composer and/or performer.\n\nThere are a couple of different types of cover songs. First are remakes that sound similar to original version. The second type of cover tunes are reinterpretations of a song that differs substantially from the original recording.\n\nMy countdown of outstanding cover songs will highlight newer recordings of well-known hits that are presented in unique, different and fresh ways, as compared to the older original productions.\n\nI must note before revealing my listing of cover tunes: this is NOT an article comparing original older versions with newer renditions. The words “better” and “best” will not be used when describing the songs that I have selected for my countdown in the cover song category.\n\nA good example of how I am proceeding with excellent cover songs is with the fantastic Dolly Parton written ballad, “I Will Always Love You.” The legendary country music singer-songwriter had her original superb version reach number one twice on the Billboard Hot Country chart, in 1974 and again in 1982.\n\nForward to 1992, Whitney Houston had one of the biggest singles of the 90s with her rendition of “I Will Always Love You.” Houston won two Grammy Awards with Dolly’s anthem and both versions of this iconic song are uniquely outstanding.\n\nBefore I start the countdown on what I consider to be sterling cover songs, I am listing ten noteworthy tunes that landed just outside of my top 20 countdown:\n\nSuperstar—The Carpenters\n\nSummer Breeze—The Isley Brothers\n\nHere Comes the Sun—Ritchie Havens\n\nStrawberry Letter 23—The Brothers Johnson\n\nDancing in the Moonlight—King Harvest\n\nSloop John B—The Beach Boys\n\nSummertime Blues—Blue Cheer\n\nHush—Deep Purple\n\nCrossroads—Cream\n\nWithout You—Nilsson\n\nWithout further ado, my countdown of fabulous cover songs begins:\n\n20. You’re No Good—Linda Ronstadt 1974\n\nOriginal version: Dee Dee Warwick in 1963\n\nLinda Ronstadt reached superstardom with her cover version of “You’re No Good.” Backing musicianship on the song is impressive. A driving bass line, superior guitar riffs and a sparse drumming pattern generates a haunting melody.\n\n19. Take Me to the River—Talking Heads 1978\n\nOriginal version: Al Green in 1974\n\nTalking Heads co-produced this version with Brian Eno. Tune has a slow tempo. Combines pop/rock and classic soul/R&B in forming an eclectic mix of gospel, punk rock and new wave sounds.\n\n18. My Back Pages—The Byrds 1967\n\nOriginal version: Bob Dylan in 1964\n\nThe Byrds provide a superb interpretation of Bob Dylan’s song. Uses multiple acoustic guitars, a flowing melody, wonderful vocal harmonies by the band. Results in a magnificent cross-section of psychedelia with country/folk rock.\n\n17. Roll Over Beethoven—Electric Light Orchestra 1973\n\nOriginal version: Chuck Berry in 1956\n\nOpening this tune: a snippet of Beethoven’s Fifth Symphony before evolving into a straight up rock tune, featuring Chuck Berry’s original music and the “Peter Gunn Theme” song in the background. This is ELO’s absolute crown jewel.\n\n16. Love Hurts—Nazareth 1974\n\nOriginal version: Everly Brothers in 1960\n\nScottish Blues rock Nazareth soared high on international charts with their power ballad “Love Hurts.” Vocalist Dan McCafferty delivers an emotional outpouring of grief and seeking compassion on this rock track.\n\n15. Got to Get You into my Life—Earth Wind & Fire\n\nOriginal version: The Beatles in 1966\n\nMaurice White’s signature vocals sets up this innovative rendition. Music spans the genres of jazz, R&B, rock, funk, disco and pop. Earth Wind & Fire won a Grammy Award for “Best Instrumental Arrangement Accompanying Vocalist” with their Beatles cover.\n\n14. Me and Bobby McGee—Janis Joplin 1970\n\nOriginal version: Roger Miller in 1969\n\n“Me and Bobby McGee” was written by American singer-songwriter Kris Kristofferson. Blues/rock ballad.

Light My Fire—Jose Feliciano 1968\n\nOriginal version: The Door in 1967\n\nPuerto Rican vocalist and guitarist.

Respect—Aretha Franklin\n\nOriginal version: Otis Redding in 1965\n\nOtis Redding penned this song in 1965.

In 2002, the Library of Congress honored Franklin’s version by adding it to the National Recording Registry. Rolling Stone rates Franklin’s version of “Respect” as the number 1 best single on their “500 Greatest Songs of All Time” List.\n\nAll Along the Watchtower—Jimi Hendrix\n\nOriginal version: Bob Dylan 1967\n\nJimi Hendrix comes in at #1 on my countdown of excellent cover songs. The artist took the outstanding lyrics written by Bob Dylan and created a magical musical masterpiece.\n\nUtilizing a hard rock psychedelic sound, Hendrix’s rendering creates an outstanding landscape with powerful guitar riffs. Mixing dynamic instrumentation, along with Dylan’s almost biblical lyrics, invokes a sense of foreboding urgency, dread and possible doom.\n\nThe remake received a Grammy Hall of Fame award in 2001, and was ranked 40th in Rolling Stone magazine’s “500 Greatest Songs of All Time” listing.\n\nWithout a doubt, “All Along the Watchtower” by Jimi Hendrix is my top outstanding cover song from the golden age of top 40 radio.\n\nI completely understand that my listing of excellent cover songs was written from my point of view and is subjective. If you were creating a similar register of great cover tunes, your tabulation may be totally different.\n\nObviously, I do not want to come across as authoritative with my critique. What do you consider to be outstanding cover songs from the golden age of top 40 radio?\n\nTo subscribe to my blog via email, please click the “Follow” button in the menu above.\n\nI am amazed by the popularity of one hit wonders, and how the topic brings back nostalgic memories for many folks.\n\nOver the past 3 years, I have published one hit wonders blogs from years 1969 through 1972. These articles are among my most viewed messages of all-time.\n\nWith this edition of my musical musings, I am concentrating on the best “one hit wonders” from 1968. I will be counting down the top songs in this category from 55 years ago.\n\nAudio aircheck above: Fred King WROV Roanoke June 1968. WROV Top 40 survey below from June 10, 1968. Courtesy of the WROV History Website/Pat Garrett.\n\nI have fond memories listening to top 40 radio from my home in Roanoke, Virginia during 1968. My go to station was legendary WROV 1240 AM, which was the top-rated radio outlet in my city.\n\nThe WROV DJs that I remember back in 1968 were Jack Fisher, Fred Frelantz, Bart Prater, Fred King, Ron Phelps and Phil Beckman. During daylight hours, I exclusively listened to WROV.\n\nWhen WROV reduced power at sundown, I would listen to top 40 AM radio stations located hundreds of miles away from my Virginia home. 50,000-watt WLS 890 AM Chicago and WABC 770 AM New York were my top two choices for nighttime listening.\n\nWhat exactly is a “One Hit Wonder?” The basic definition: An artist has only one hit song on the national Billboard Hot 100 pop chart during their career. This music blog message pertains solely to hit songs within the United States.\n\nTo avoid any confusion, here are the criteria that I am using to define a one hit wonder:\n\nNo other songs from an artist ever peaking at number 40 or higher on the Billboard National Pop Chart. (Chart positions from number 40 to number 1).\n\nOne hit wonders vary from country to country. An artist may have just one hit in the United States but may have multiple hits in another country.\n\nRegional hits are not taken into account: A second song must be a national hit and chart within the Billboard Top 40 pop survey.\n\nSingles that peak from numbers 41 through 100 on the national Billboard Hot 100 pop chart are generally not considered as a second hit. Example: a 2nd song peaking at number 87 does not constitute an artist as a two-hit-wonder.\n\nAll documentation of chart positions I share below in this article comes from The Billboard Book of Top 40 Hits by Joel Whitburn. I proudly own a hard copy of this excellent reference manual, which I consider to be the ‘bible” handbook for music history with Top 40 radio.\n\nAs a point of reference, below are the top 10 biggest records of 1968. Only two of the songs listed are one hit wonders: “Love is Blue” and “The Good, the Bad and the Ugly.”\n\n1 “Hey Jude” The Beatles\n\n2 “Love is Blue” Paul Mauriat\n\n3 “Honey” Bobby Goldsboro\n\n4 “(Sittin’ On) The Dock of the Bay” Otis Redding\n\n5 “People Got to Be Free” The Rascals\n\n6 “Sunshine of Your Love” Cream\n\n7 “This Guy’s in Love with You” Herb Alpert\n\n8 “The Good, the Bad and the Ugly” Hugo Montenegro\n\n9 “Mrs. Robinson” Simon & Garfunkel\n\n10 “Tighten Up” Archie Bell & the Drells\n\nBefore starting my countdown with the best 1968 one hit wonders, I must clear up some Internet erroneous information that some proclaim on this topic.\n\nThere are two outstanding singles from 1968 by artists who have been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Some may disagree with me but I don’t consider either of these individuals as “one hit wonders.”\n\nJimi Hendrix: “All Along the Watchtower” Peaked at #20 on Billboard Hot 100\n\nA song written by the legendary Bob Dylan, “All Along the Watchtower” was the only Jimi Hendrix song to chart #40 or higher on the Billboard Hot 100. However, the superb guitarist did have three other songs peaking between numbers 52 and 67: “Crosstown Traffic”, “Purple Haze” and “Foxy Lady.” Here in 2023, all 3 of these singles continue to receive heavy airplay on US classic rock radio stations.\n\n2. Janis Joplin: “Piece of My Heart” Big Brother & the Holding Company: Peaked at #12 on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nThe San Francisco psychedelic rock band Big Brother & the Holding Company had Janis Joplin as lead singer. While “Piece of My Heart” was the only song to chart #40 or higher on the Billboard Hot 100, the group’s follow up single, “Down on Me” peaked at #43 during the fall of 1968. Joplin also had a posthumous #1 hit “Me and Bobby McGee” in 1971.\n\nNoteworthy 1968 one hit wonders outside of my top 20 countdown:\n\nFire—The Crazy World of Arthur Brown\n\nSkip a Rope—Henson Cargill\n\nShame Shame—Magic Lanterns\n\nIn-a-Gadda-Da-Vida—Iron Butterfly\n\nPlayboy—Gene and Debbie\n\nLove Makes a Woman—Barbara Acklin\n\nNovelty 1968 One Hit Wonders:\n\nTip Toe Thru’ the Tulips with Me—Tiny Tim\n\nHere Comes the Judge—Shorty Long\n\nQuick Joey Small (Run Joey Run)—Kasenetz-Katz Singing Orchestral Circus\n\nHere Comes the Judge—Pigmeat Markham\n\nAs Casey Kasem used to say on his American Top 40 show: “It’s now on with the countdown.”\n\n20.

The Horse—Cliff Nobles & Co.\n\nPeak Positions on Billboard Charts: #2 Hot 100, 21st Biggest Hit of 1968\n\nInteresting that Cliff Nobles didn’t perform on the tune credited to him.

Summertime Blues—Blue Cheer\n\nPeak Position on Billboard Charts: #14 Hot 100, 56th Biggest Song of 1968\n\n“Summertime Blues” originally was a hit by Eddie Cochran in 1958.

Love is Blue—Paul Mauriet\n\nPeak positions on Billboard Charts: #1 Hot 100, 2nd Biggest Hit of 1968\n\nWith “Love is Blue” reaching number 1 for five weeks during February and March in 1968, Paul Mauriat became the first French artist to top the Billboard Hot 100. The tune also spent 11 weeks at number 1 on the “Easy Listening” chart and became the second-best-selling record in 1969 according to Billboard.\n\n7. Harper Valley PTA—Jeannie C Riley\n\nPeak Position on Billboard Charts: #1 Hot 100, 17th biggest Song of 1968\n\nCountry singer-songwriter Tom T Hall created a most unusual story for this crossover Top 40 hit. The Harper Valley PTA meeting was a wild and wacky affair as an “unfit mother” addresses her concerns about the hypocrisy of multiple other members with the school organization.\n\n6. MacArthur Park—Richard Harris\n\nPeak Positions on Billboard Charts: #2 Hot 100, 51st Biggest Song of 1968\n\nFirst 45-rpm single over 7 minutes long to reach top 10 on Billboard Hot 100.

The Amboy Dukes were known primarily as a psychedelic/hard rock band. Musically and lyrically, this masterpiece helped to define the 60s psychedelic era of songs on top 40 radio. Nugent started a solo career in 1975.\n\n1. Pictures of Matchstick Men—Status Quo\n\nPeak Positions on Billboard Charts: #12 Hot 100, 55th Biggest Song of 1968\n\nBritish rock band Status Quo has my number 1 song with “Pictures of Matchstick Men.” Formed in 1962, the band is still active in 2023. Interestingly, while Status Quo has charted fifty-seven top 40 hits in the UK, they have just one hit song in the US.\n\nStatus Quo co-founder, guitarist and lead singer Francis Rossi wrote the song for band’s only American hit. The songwriter’s lyrics use the term “matchstick men” which came from a reference to the paintings and drawings of English artist L. S. Lowry.\n\n“Pictures of Matchstick Men” is musically rich, with the tune featuring a phasing audio effect and wah-wah guitars. The record is said to be one of the first to use this technique. The distinctive four-note guitar riff throughout the song makes this a memorable song from the summer of 1968.\n\nWithout a doubt, I consider “Pictures of Matchstick Men” by Status Quo as one of the best singles from 55 years ago and the greatest one hit wonder of 1968.\n\nNow that I have humbly submitted my countdown of 1968 one hit wonders, I am curious to find out your opinion on this topic. Obviously, I do not want to come across as authoritative with my critique. The songs that you feel are the best may be completely different from my selections.\n\nWhat do you consider to be the best one hit wonders from 1968? There are no right or wrong answers. I welcome your thoughts.\n\nListening to music from the golden age of Top 40 radio will always have a special place in my heart. I cherish and fondly remember my favorite “one hit wonders” of 1968. Rock on!\n\nTo subscribe to my blog via email, please click the “Follow” button in the menu above.\n\nI discovered top 40 radio in early 1967 as an 11-year-old boy in Roanoke, Virginia. Finding WROV 1240 AM that year, expanded musical horizons in my life and set up a future course for me working as a radio DJ.\n\nAttending Oakland Elementary School, I was familiar with the Beatles and viewed “The Monkees” TV series on a weekly basis but my knowledge of pop/rock music was limited.\n\nChristmas 1966, I was gifted 3 albums that whetted my appetite for popular music at that time: “Boots” by Nancy Sinatra, “Gary Lewis & the Playboys Greatest Hits” and The Monkees’ self-titled debut album. Santa Claus also left a record player underneath the Christmas tree that year.\n\nMy parents were not rock fans so I didn’t inherit any guidance on this popular type of music. My father listened to country music on WSLC 610 AM while my mother favored the smooth “Middle of the Road” format on WDBJ 960 AM.\n\nIn the winter months of 1967, I was curious about radio and started my lifelong love of music. Located in our living room was a huge RCA stereo console, which featured an AM/FM radio. I spent many afternoons exploring various local Virginia stations after I got home from school.\n\nIt was also in this time period that I bought my first record album: “More of the Monkees.” This was the second LP released by the TV rock band and featured the mega number 1 hit “I’m a Believer.”\n\nForward to spring break 1967: with no school happening, I found an AM desk-top tube radio in our kitchen. The stations that I listened to that week both had Top 40 formats: WROV 1240 AM and WPXI 910 AM.\n\nThen on my 12th birthday in May 1967, my parents gave me a transistor radio. From that point on, I was hooked on top 40 radio and WROV.\n\nLegendary Top 40 WROV 1240 AM was the top-rated radio station in Roanoke during the mid to late 60s and also throughout the 70s decade. The two DJ’s that I distinctly remember from WROV back in ‘67 are Jack Fisher and Fred Frelantz.\n\nWROV DJs Fred Freelantz and Jack Fisher. Photo courtesy of WROV History Website/Pat Garrett.\n\nBack side of WROV Roanoke Musicard: Photo courtesy of WROV History Website/Pat Garrett.\n\nMy radio listening expanded during the “summer of love” in ’67, as I commandeered the desk-top tube radio from our kitchen and permanently kept this device in my bedroom. During daylight hours, I exclusively listened to WROV.\n\nUnlike my small transistor radio, the devise in my bedroom could pick up radio stations that were located hundreds of miles away from my Virginia home. On many nights that summer, I would tune in 50,000-watt, clear channel AM radio stations, such as WLS 890 Chicago and WABC 770 New York.\n\nI still have fond memories listening to top 40 radio during 1967. For the remainder of this article, I will be sharing what I consider to be the best songs played on top 40 music stations 55 years ago.\n\nAs a guide, I used the Billboard Year-End Hot 100 singles of 1967 survey for songs I selected with my countdown. For chart information, I utilized, “The Billboard Book of Top 40 Hits” by Joel Whitburn.\n\nBelow are the top 10 songs of 1967 according to Billboard:\n\n1 “To Sir With Love” Lulu\n\n2 “The Letter” The Box Tops\n\n3 “Ode to Billie Joe” Bobbie Gentry\n\n4 “Windy” The Association\n\n5 “I’m a Believer” The Monkees\n\n6 “Light My Fire” The Doors\n\n7 “Somethin’ Stupid” Frank & Nancy Sinatra\n\n8 “Happy Together” The Turtles\n\n9 “Groovin'” The Young Rascals\n\n10 “Can’t Take My Eyes off You” Frankie Valli\n\nSongs listed below are 1967 singles that I like but fell outside my top 20 countdown, randomly placed with no ranking. It was extremely hard excluding these outstanding songs from the final listing:\n\nSoul Man—Sam & Dave\n\nThe Letter—The Box Tops\n\nLight My Fire—The Doors\n\nTo Sir with Love–Lulu\n\nExpressway (To Your Heart)—The Soul Survivors\n\nSomebody to Love—Jefferson Airplane\n\nOde to Billie Joe—Bobbie Gentry\n\nPleasant Valley Sunday—The Monkees\n\nAll You Need is Love—The Beatles\n\nGimme Little Sign—Brenton Wood\n\nMirage—Tommy James & the Shondells\n\nI Had too Much to Dream (Last Night)—The Electric Prunes\n\nFriday on My Mind—The Easybeats\n\nHere Comes My Baby—The Tremeloes\n\nReflections—The Supremes\n\nAs Casey Kasem used to say on his American Top 40 show: “It’s now on with the countdown.”\n\n20. White Rabbit—Jefferson Airplane\n\nPeak Positions on Billboard Charts: #8 Hot 100, 81st Biggest Song of 1967\n\nWritten by Jefferson Airplane’s vocalist Grace Slick.

Lyrics honors some of the biggest R&B artists from the mid 60s: The Miracles, Lou Rawls, Sam & Dave, Wilson Pickett, Otis Redding and James Brown. Brass instruments create a rich sound on the tune.\n\n11. On a Carousel—The Hollies\n\nPeak Positions on Billboard Charts: #11 Hot 100, 42nd Biggest Song of 1967\n\n“On a Carousel” is a perfect pop song, written by Hollies band members Allan Clarke, Graham Nash and Tony Hicks. Melodic tune and vocal harmonies are rich on popular recording.\n\n10. I Was Made to Love Her—Stevie Wonder\n\nPositions on Billboard Charts: #2 Hot 100, 14th Biggest Song of 1967\n\nStevie Wonder was just 17 years old when “I Was Made to Love Her” was a hit.

Bernadette—The Four Tops\n\nPeak Positions on Billboard Charts: #4 Hot 100, 82nd Biggest Song of 1967\n\nOne of Motown’s greatest bass lines is found on this song. Levi Stubbs provides outstanding vocals on the Four Tops last top 10 hit of the 60s. I rank “Bernadette” as the 8th best Motown single of the Detroit years with the recording company.\n\n6. Ain’t No Mountain High Enough—Marvin Gaye & Tammi Terrell\n\nPeak Positions on Billboard Charts: #19 Hot 100, 87th Biggest Song of 1967\n\nI rate Marvin Gaye & Tammi Terrell’s single as the best Motown duet of all-time and the second greatest song during the 1961-1971 time period with the record company founded by Barry Gordy. With instrumentation by the Funk Brothers and Detroit Symphony Orchestra, Terrell/Gaye are marvelous on this toe-tapping tune.\n\n5. I Can See for Miles—The Who\n\nPeak Positions on Billboard Charts: #9 Hot 100, 98th Biggest Song of 1967\n\nThe Who’s first top ten hit in the U.S. Rolling Stone places “I Can See for Miles” as the second greatest song by the British band. Pete Townshend’s soaring guitar and Keith Moon’s driving drum playing, makes this one of the best rock singles from the 1990 Rock & Roll Hall of Fame inductees.\n\n4. Incense & Peppermints—Strawberry Alarm Clock\n\nPeak Positions on Billboard Charts: #1 Hot 100, 23rd Biggest Song of 1967\n\nPsychedelic rock band formed in Glendale, California. Founding member Ed King went on to fame with Lynyrd Skynyrd. Recorded songs in the “Sunshine Pop” genre. “Tomorrow” was a second top 40 hit for the band.\n\n3. For What It’s Worth—Buffalo Springfield\n\nPeak Positions on Billboard Chart: #7 Hot 100, 27th Biggest Song of 1967\n\nOriginally called “For What It’s Worth (Stop, Hey What’s That Sound).” Stephen Stills wrote and sang lead vocals on the single. Became an anthem during the 1967 “Summer of Love” and is considered one of the greatest protest songs from the 20th century.\n\n2. Penny Lane—The Beatles\n\nPeak Positions of Billboard Charts: #1 Hot 100, 55th Biggest Song of 1967\n\n“Penny Lane” and “Strawberry Fields Forever” were originally set to appear on the Beatles “Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band” album. Instead, both songs were released as a double-A sided 45-rpm single.\n\nPaul McCartney’s masterpiece “Penny Lane” uses many instruments not associated with most Beatles songs: flutes, piccolos, oboes, trumpets and a flugelhorn. “Penny Lane” is my second favorite Beatles song of all-time and was the first 45-rpm single that I bought with my own money during the spring of 1967.\n\nWhiter Shade of Pale—Procol Harum\n\nPeak Positions of Billboard Charts: #5 Hot 100, 38th Biggest Song of 1967\n\nBritish band Procol Harum came through with another 1967 “Summer of Love” anthem with their song “A Whiter Shade of Pale.” The single sold over 10 million copies world-wide, inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame and is number 57 on the Rolling Stone “500 Greatest Songs of All Time” list.\n\nThe music was composed by band member Gary Brooker and Matthew Fisher, while lyrics were written by the group’s Keith Reid. Melody on the song has a classical music feel, with an outstanding mixture of organ and bassline. This is a brilliant piece of music, in my humble opinion.\n\n“A Whiter Shade of Pale” is my second favorite song of all-time and Procol Harum’s chef d’oeuvre is my number 1 top 40 single of 1967.\n\nNow that I have submitted what I consider to be the most significant top 40 hits of 1967, I am curious to find out your opinions on this topic. What are your favorite songs on my countdown?\n\nObviously, I do not want to come across as authoritative with my critique of superb pop hits from 1967. The songs that you might feel are the best, may be completely different from my selections.\n\nThanks in advance for sharing your thoughts and comments below on what you consider to be the fantastic top 40 hits of 45 years ago. I look forward reading your responses. Rock on!\n\nTo subscribe to my blog via email, please click the “Follow” button in the menu above.\n\nEarlier this year, vocalist Terry Brown of Roanoke’s legendary band the Kings temporarily stepped down due to some health issues. Finding a stand-in substitute could have posed a problem for long-time Kings leader Larry Wheeling.\n\nIn finding a fill-in pinch hitter, Wheeling didn’t have to call Ghostbusters. Instead, he found Roanoke native Chris Keaton to sing and play saxophone for the Kings while Brown is convalescing from his illness.\n\nThe Kings were founded in 1965 by Perry Caligan, who still acts as the business owner of the band. Current leader and manager of the Kings is Larry Wheeling, who joined the Roanoke based group during 1969.\n\nOver four years ago, I featured the Kings on a music blog message and attended one of the band’s concerts in downtown Roanoke. Here is the link for The Kings Rocking Roanoke Since 1965: https://woodsonrva.com/2018/07/11/the-kings-rocking-roanoke-since-1965/\n\nThe Kings in concert in downtown Roanoke on July 5, 2018.\n\nWhile Terry Brown recovers from his health issues, the Kings have been fortunate to secure the services of Chris Keaton. I had the opportunity to interview Keaton last month, just before he and the Kings had a concert at Roanoke’s Black Dog Salvage.\n\nChris Keaton was born in Roanoke, Virginia and grew up in the town of Vinton. After graduating from William Byrd High School, Keaton spent a year at Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) in Richmond. Chris then following in the footsteps of Bob Dylan left college life to pursue a career in music.\n\nDuring the mid 70s, Keaton played saxophone and toured with pop/rock bands ranging from Gary U.S. Bonds to Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons. He also had gigs with Jay & the Techniques during this time period.\n\nA few bands that Keaton was a member of during the 70s and 80s were High & Mighty, Dazzle Boys and Band of Oz. Interestingly, Chris also had two separate stints performing as a member of the Kings during his younger years.\n\nAn album from the Kings: 1989. Chris Keaton co-produced this LP with Brian Wheeling. Band members (L-R), Bruce Wall, David Ferguson, Randy Wheeling, Chris Keaton, Kent Martin, Larry Wheeling and Brian Wheeling.\n\nIn 1993, Keaton moved to Nashville, Tennessee and became a business partner with another Roanoke native Tommy Holcomb. Eventually, Holcomb moved back to Roanoke while Keaton stayed in the “Music City” to venture into a new career path.\n\nSince the mid 90s, Keaton’s career has become multifaceted. His official bio states: “Chris is a Nashville-based entertainment industry executive, award winning music publisher, artist management consultant and a 2016 Inductee in the North Carolina Music Hall of Fame.”\n\nWhen I interviewed Chris last month, 3 words stood out to me that describe Keaton’s current profession: connector, influencer and encourager. Keaton utilizes various forms of social media during his day-to-day activities.\n\nOne social media avenue Keaton uses is podcasting. He describes his “Random Acts” podcast, “of kindness, stories, a song or two, seeds of hope and love, and the randomness of it all through the eyes of Chris Keaton.”\n\nAnother fascinating venture of Keaton’s work is with the fashion industry. For a number of years, Chris has been a member of Macy’s Style Crew as a “brand influencer.” As a result of his Macy’s gig, Keaton published a book in 2020 called “Dapper.”\n\nPublished at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020, “Dapper” was written by Keaton and the text is supported by photographer Keith Charles. The book conveys, “Serious tips on being a dapper gentleman tempered with a dash of humor.”\n\nTwo years ago, Keaton was a guest on Larry Dowdy Mic Side podcast and talked about his book “Dapper” along with some of his past musical performing career.\n\nVersatility and Chris Keaton go hand-in hand as he has been a long-time voting member of the Recording Academy (Grammy Awards) and is a reviewer for an Internet country music site.\n\n2016 was a memorable year for Keaton as he was inducted into the North Carolina Music Hall of Fame. Working with the beach music group Band of Oz, Keaton composed an award-winning rendition of the song, “Somewhere Over the Rainbow” for his induction.\n\nConsidering all of the activities that Keaton has been involved with during the past few years, the influencer hasn’t performed many in-person concerts. However, that changed a few months ago when Larry Wheeling asked Chris to play with the Kings on a temporary basis.\n\nThe current 2022 lineup of the Kings:\n\nTerry Brown–Vocals\n\nMike Feamster –Drums\n\nBrian Jones– Bass\n\nChris Loder–Guitar\n\nMelody Irby — Vocals & Keyboards\n\nAlan Walker— Sax\n\nRandy Wheeling–Trumpet & Trombone\n\nLarry Wheeling —–Trumpet\n\nChris Keaton—- Vocals & Sax\n\nWith Keaton temporarily performing with the Kings, he plays saxophone and shares lead vocal duties with Melody Irby. The brass section of the band is superb.\n\nMusically, the Kings are a pop/rock band and have a large following in central and southwestern Virginia. The band plays a wide variety of cover tunes, ranging from the 60s through songs from the past ten years.\n\nThe Kings are Roanoke’s quintessential band and have been fortunate to secure the services of Keaton on a temporary basis. Providing his vocal talents and excellent saxophone skills, make him a perfect fit with the Kings.\n\nMy assessment of Keaton can be summed up as “renaissance man.” He flows within a wide mixture of diverse areas, bringing his talents and knowledge for positive results.\n\nWithout a doubt, Chris Keaton is helping to make the world a better place by being an encourager, spreading peace, love and tranquility to everyone on his path in life.\n\nTo subscribe to my blog via email, please click the “Follow” button in the menu above.\n\nWhat are the most significant top 40 songs from 45 years ago? While that are no definitive answers to that question, I will be sharing what I consider to be the best pop singles of 1977.\n\nDuring 1977, I lived in Roanoke, Virginia and was employed by WJLM 93.5 FM as a country DJ. With this full-time position, I was totally immersed within the genre of country music at my radio station.\n\nWhenever I wasn’t working at WJLM, my radio listening tended to be in non-country formats. Since my first love musically was rock music, I predominantly listened to top 40 stations. And whenever possible, I also tuned into “All Things Considered” on Roanoke’s NPR affiliate, WVWR 89.1 FM.\n\nMy go to radio station that I heard the most during 1977 was WROV 1240 AM. I was employed part-time at this legendary top 40 outlet while attending Virginia Western Community College during 1974 and 1975. I fondly remember regularly listening to WROV DJs Bart Prater, Rob O’Brady, Bill Jordan and Larry Bly in ’77.\n\nSince WROV reduced their power at sundown, I would sometimes listen to a couple of 50,000 watt AM stations during the nighttime: WLS 890 Chicago and WABC 770 New York.\n\nOn the FM band, I could listen to a couple of high-powered top 40 North Carolina stations that came in strong throughout the Roanoke Valley: WKZL 107.5 FM Winston-Salem and WRQK 98.7 FM Greensboro. And if weather conditions were just right, I could pick up Q94 Richmond (94.5 FM) which was a premier Top 40 station in Virginia.\n\nWith this edition of my musical musings, I am concentrating on most significant top 40 hits from 45-years ago. Using Billboard magazine’s, “Year-End Hot 100 Singles of 1977” chart as a reference, I will countdown the what I consider to be the best songs in this category.\n\nBelow are the ten biggest records of 1977 according to Billboard.

In early June that year, WJLM program director Gary E. Cooper handed me text for a commercial that he wanted me to create for an upcoming Elvis Presley Roanoke concert, that was scheduled for August 24, 1977.\n\nWhen I recorded the spot, I used two Elvis songs for a musical bed which I felt like our WJLM listeners would recognize: “Moody Blue” which had been a number 1 hit at my station earlier that year and Presley’s 1956 hit “Don’t be Cruel.”\n\nForward to August 16, 1977: I was on vacation in Northern Minnesota visiting relatives, when my grandmother Agnes Burt shared tragic news with me: “Elvis had left the building.” Obviously stunned, I couldn’t believe that Presley had died at the young age of 42.\n\nBack in 2017, I had my friend David Hollandsworth digitize some of my old WJLM DJ airchecks from reel-to-reel tape to computer files. Thankfully, the Elvis spot that I recorded was among my saved airchecks and can be heard below; the commercial I created for Presley’s Roanoke show that never happened.\n\nElvis Presley was just one of many crossover artists that we played on WJLM during 1977. Country radio was evolving and our FM station was on the forefront of airing artists from a wider, more diverse musical mix, compared to existing traditional AM radio country formatted outlets.\n\nWith this music blog message, I will chronicle excellent classic country crossover hits from 1977. In this category, I will countdown what I consider to be the premier songs that I played on WJLM 45 years ago.\n\nIn laying out parameters on this topic, I must define the term “Country Crossover.” For purposes of this article, the definition has multiple meanings.\n\nA “Country Crossover” refers to songs and/or artists from two directions. First, pop/top 40 artists recording songs that have country music elements and became hits on country radio. Second, proven hit makers within the genre of country music who have hit songs played on pop/top 40 stations and charted on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nI will be highlighting what I consider to be the best country crossover hits that I played on WJLM Roanoke 45 years ago.\n\nWJLM changed formats in August 1976 from religious programming to playing country music. Our main competition in the Roanoke market was WSLC 610 AM.\n\nWSLC AM primarily played traditional country songs of the 70s and a heavy dose of 50s/ 60s oldies, with roots within the Nashville and Bakersfield sounds of the country music genre.\n\nCore Artists on WSLC: Johnny Cash, Conway Twitty, Buck Owens, Loretta Lynn, George Jones, Tammy Wynette, Bill Anderson, Porter Wagoner. Their format tended not to play pop, outlaw or progressive county songs.\n\nOn WJLM, we played mostly current music or songs that were less than 2 years old. Our format aired traditional Nashville/Bakersfield Sound artists but only if those artists were releasing new singles. Virtually no country oldies were featured on the regular WJLM rotation.\n\nDiffering from WSLC’s format, WJLM achieved a balanced mix of hits: 50% traditional artists, with the other half being in the “Outlaw/Progressive” genre and/or pop artists that recorded songs that had crossed over to country radio.\n\nBesides traditional country music legends like Johnny Cash and Dolly Parton, WJLM core artists included Willie Nelson, Waylon Jennings, Kris Kristofferson, David Allan Coe, Emmylou Harris, Linda Ronstadt, Glen Campbell, Olivia-Newton-John, John Denver, B.J. Thomas, Kenny Rogers, Anne Murray and Elvis Presley.\n\nSince WJLM didn’t have a vast library of older hits, the station was billed as “Roanoke’s New FM Country Leader.” The biggest advantage that we held over WSLC AM: the music sounded better on WJLM as our signal was broadcasted in stereo on the FM band.\n\nWhen we started playing country music in August 1976, WJLM’s playlist was 100 percent current music. Two of the biggest crossover hits we aired that summer were “One Piece at a Time” by Johnny Cash and “If You Got the Money Honey I’ve Got the Time” from Willie Nelson.\n\nDuring the remainder of 1976, Gordon Lightfoot’s epic story song, “The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald” was my number 1 favorite country crossover that I played on WJLM.\n\nAt the beginning of 1977, WJLM rolled out a second slogan for our station: “Your Place in the Country.” This catchy phrase invited listeners to find a new musical home with 93.5 FM.\n\nBefore starting the best 1977 classic country crossover singles countdown, I am listing some notable songs that fell outside of my top 20 tabulation for this category.\n\nSam—Olivia Newton-John\n\nYou Light Up My Life—Debby Boone\n\nMargaritaville—Jimmy Buffett\n\nSay You’ll Stay Until Tomorrow—Tom Jones\n\nTorn Between Two Lovers—Mary MacGregor\n\nAfter the Loving—Engelbert Humperdinck\n\nHow Can I Leave You—John Denver\n\nHome Where I Belong—B.J. Thomas\n\nI submit to you what I consider to be the top 20 premier country crossover singles that I played on WJLM Roanoke during 1977. These are songs that I deem to be culturally, historically, aesthetically significant, meaningful or relevant.\n\n20. Right Time of the Night—Jennifer Warnes\n\nPeaked Positions of Billboard Charts: #6 Hot 100, #17 Hot Country Singles\n\nWritten by Peter McCann.

However, hit songs without singing were commonplace on Top 40 radio from 1960 through 1985. In that time span, there were 18 different instrumental songs all peaking at number one.\n\nThe biggest instrumental hit of the 60s is “The Theme from a Summer Place” by Percy Faith and the Orchestra. This monster hit spent 9 consecutive weeks at number 1 and was the biggest record of 1960 according to Billboard. Faith won a Grammy Award for “Record of the Year” in 1961 for this song.\n\nThe summer of 1968 was the pinnacle for instrumental hits on Top 40 radio. On the Billboard Hot 100 chart for the week ending August 3, there are three instrumentals in the top eight positions: “Classical Gas” by Mason Williams peaked at #2, “Grazing in the Grass” from Hugh Masekela ranked #4 and “The Horse” by Cliff Noble and Co was number 8.\n\nAt the end of 1968, Billboard ranked 6 instrumental songs in their “Year-End Hot 100 Singles” chart with Paul Mauriat’s tune “Love is Blue” coming in as the second biggest record for ’68.\n\nWith this latest music blog message, I will be counting down what I consider to be the top 10 most significant instrumental singles between the years of 1965 and 1969. This time frame is considered to be part of the “Golden Age of Top 40 Radio.”\n\nCriteria that I am using in this article:\n\nTune charted during the 1965 to 1969 time period\n\nSingle peaked at number 10 or higher on the Billboard Hot 100 chart\n\nSong has NO voices, speaking of words or whistling anywhere on the tune\n\nMy favorite instrumental: Soul Coaxing by Raymond Lefèvre and His Orchestra. Peaked at number 37 on the Billboard Hot 100 during the spring of 1968.\n\nInstrumentals that are good but not eligible for my countdown because of human voices, brief singing or whistling:\n\nSoul Finger—The Bar-Kays\n\nThe Good, The Bad and the Ugly—Hugo Montenegro\n\nNo Matter What Shape—The T-Bones\n\nI Was Kasier Bill’s Batman—Whistling Jack Smith\n\nThe “In” Crowd—Ramsey Lewis Trio\n\nInstrumental songs just outside of my top 10\n\nHang ‘Em High—Booker T and the MGs\n\nQuentin’s Theme—Charles Randolph Grean Sounde\n\nKeem-O-Sabe—Electric Indian\n\nAs Casey Kasem used to say on his American Top 40 show: “And now it’s on with the countdown.”\n\n10. Midnight Cowboy—Ferrante & Teicher (1969)\n\nPeak Positions on Billboard Charts: #2 Easy Listening, #10 Hot 100\n\nMusical score written by John Berry for the 1969 film “Midnight Cowboy.” The Ferrante & Teicher duo were American piano players who recorded many movie soundtracks, show tunes and light classical music tunes.\n\n9.

The Horse—Cliff Nobles & Co (1968)\n\nPeak Positions on Billboard Charts: #2, Hot 100, 21st Biggest Hit of 1968\n\nInteresting that Cliff Nobles didn’t perform on the tune credited to him. A group of session musicians jammed in the studio to create the instrumental track. “The Horse” was released as the B-Side of the 45-rpm single “Love is All Right” and is the instrumental version of that tune.\n\n5. Soulful Strut—Young-Holt Unlimited (1968)\n\nPeak Positions on Billboard Charts: #3 Hot 100, #2 Easy Listening\n\nYoung-Holt Unlimited was a jazz trio from Chicago, Illinois.

The tune also spent 11 weeks at number 1 on the “Easy Listening” chart and became the second best selling record in 1969 according to Billboard.\n\n2. A Taste of Honey—Herb Alpert & the Tijuana Brass (1965)\n\nPeak Positions on Billboard Charts: #1 Easy Listening, #7 Hot 100\n\nSignature tune by Herb Alpert received four Grammy Awards, including “Record of the Year” in 1966. “A Taste of Honey” topped the Billboard Easy Listening chart for five weeks and the American trumpeter was a 2006 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductee.\n\nClassical Gas—Mason Williams (1968)\n\nPeak Positions on Billboard Charts: #2 Hot 100, 43rd Biggest Hit of 1968\n\n“Classical Gas” was composed by Mason Williams and features instrumental backup by the professional session musicians known as the “Wrecking Crew.” During 1969, the tune won three Grammy Awards for categories all associated with instrumental music. Without a doubt, the musical masterpiece known as “Classical Gas” by Mason Williams is my number 1 selection for the best instrumental top 40 single of the mid to late 60s.\n\nNow that I have submitted my top 10 premier pop instrumental hits of the 60s, I am curious to find out your opinions of this topic. What are your favorite songs on my countdown?\n\nThanks in advance for sharing your thoughts and comments below on what you consider to be the best Top 40 pop instrumental hits from the mid to late 60s.

The song is now available for purchase and is the first track from an upcoming October 2022 Niemietz album release called “Superman.”\n\nThe “Locks” single and the remaining 13 other tracks from the new “Superman” LP are a collaboration between Sara Niemietz and her musical partner Linda Taylor. This dynamic duo merged their musical talents together over the past two years: Niemietz-Taylor are co-producers for “Superman” and co-wrote every song on their collaborative project.\n\nNiemietz is a singer-songwriter, musician, actor and member of PostModern Jukebox, who has recorded 3 albums during her career. Taylor is a superb guitarist, composer, music producer and plays guitar on ABC TV show “Whose Line Is It Anyway?” Together, the Niemietz-Taylor team creates musical magic!\n\nWith the production of “Locks” and “Superman” by Niemietz-Taylor, the duo employed session musicians for their recordings. Personnel on all 14 songs include:\n\nSara Niemietz – vocals\n\nLinda Taylor – guitars\n\nLéo Costa – drums\n\nEd Roth – keyboards\n\nDaniel Pearson – bass\n\nHere are my thoughts about the new Niemietz-Taylor single. When I heard “Locks” for the first time, I responded back to Sara and Linda via email with the following reply: “The track is a good choice for a first single. It is a catchy, up-tempo groove. Excellent interplay with the drum, guitar and bass. I love the special effects with the switching of tune tempo. Outstanding vocals and harmonies. A Superb production. Pleasing to my ear.”\n\nWhat does the co-producer team of Niemietz-Taylor have to say about their new single? I asked Sara and Linda about “Locks” and they answered my inquiry from two different continents.\n\nTaylor’s answer came to me from her Los Angeles, California home, submitting a quote from an official press release on “Locks” and the “Superman” album: “The bluesy “Locks” captures the bittersweet side of getting through life challenges. Here, Sara’s rich and sultry vocals imbue the song with a sense of burnished hope befitting the lyrics. One choice passage reads: “Who’s that looking out from the mirror/A little bit leaner, meaner/She figured it out/Can’t believe what I see/It’s almost hard to believe/This other side of the street I’m standing on.”\n\nMy question for Niemietz: “Why did she and Taylor choose “Locks” as the first single to be released? Sara replied via email, on a bus somewhere in Austria, as she was touring with PostModern Jukebox last month: “We have new versions of some previously released songs on “Superman” but “Locks” was the first idea specifically for the album. It went through several re-writes and re-records before we found its heart. In fairness, it got a little beat up, but we weren’t willing to let it go. Now we find it just feels like the start, the start of the setlist, the start of the album, the opening chapter, it sets everything in motion and the obvious first single.”\n\nLink for purchasing “Locks” single: https://tinyurl.com/saralocks\n\nSara’s official website: www.saraniemietz.com\n\nLinda’s official website: www.lindataylormusic.com\n\nAs I mentioned above, “Locks” and all the songs on “Superman” were written and produced by Niemietz-Taylor. The album will feature five new studio versions of previously released singles of the past two years: “Come to Me”, “Superman”, “Lovely Lies”, “The Dimming”, and “GOODX3.” From these five existing songs, the last two have already become fan favorites for those who follow the Niemietz-Taylor musical pair.\n\nConsidering that Niemietz has recorded three excellent albums during her career, “Superman” promises to be a musical delight. The collaborative Niemietz-Taylor album is now available for pre-ordering from Bandwear. Link to purchase album is below:\n\nFor anyone searching for new music to purchase this summer, look no further than “Locks” and the upcoming “Superman” album from Sara Niemietz and Linda Taylor.
