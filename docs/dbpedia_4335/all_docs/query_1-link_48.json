        "text": "THE LEGACY LIVES ON!\n\nLinda Ronstadt, 11-time Grammy winner who sold over 100 million albums in country, rock, Latin, Motown, and even Broadway music, is no longer performing publicly. Yet millions of her devoted fans still long to hear the beloved songs that made up the soundtrack of their lives.\n\nFortunately, her incredible musical legacy now lives on through the stunning talents of Gesenia and her Ronstadt Revue. Every Ronstadt Revue show, performed in painstaking detail in both English and Spanish, covers every musical genre of Ms. Ronstadt’s 40+ year career. Their performance is so authentic that two of Linda Ronstadt’s own band members are currently co-producing and featured on the upcoming Ronstadt Revue album and one of them, John Beland, appears with the band at selected shows across the country.\n\nPlease click to watch our live video highlights reel and enjoy reliving the legacy of the legendary Linda Ronstadt as lovingly presented by Gesenia and Ronstadt Revue – the closest you’ll ever come to the sound of Linda Ronstadt!"
