        "text": "Don Henley, who helped found the Eagles, always has been a thoughtful, introspective musician.\n\nEven at the hedonistic heights - or rock-bottom lows - of the Eagles' Rock and Roll Hall of Fame run, Henley was able to blend intellectuality with carnality. He was both cerebral and visceral.\n\nDon Henley, born in Gilmer, Texas, and raised in Linden, Texas hooked up with Detroit-born Glenn Frey to form one of the most influential and commercially successful bands ever to emerge from Los Angeles. They first played together as Linda Ronstadt's back-up band.\n\nDoing difficult dual duty as a drummer and distinctively raspy-voiced vocalist - only The Band's Levon Helm was his equal at that tough task - Henley wrote or co-wrote most of the Eagles' memorable songs and megawatt hits.\n\nBetween 1972-80, the band - in several alignments, with Henley and Frey the constant - released nine albums, including \"Hotel California,\" a the definitive landmark from 1976. The album sold 32 million copies in the U.S., Canada and the United Kingdom.\n\nAll of the albums from their initial incarnation have achieved platinum sales (1 million or more), selling 75 million copies just in the U.S. \"Their Greatest Hits: 1971-75\" remains one of the best-selling albums in history (49 million in the U.S. and Canada).\n\nThey released 29 singles in an era when radio airplay was a make-or-break reality. Six of them got to No. 1: \"Best of My Love\" (1964), \"One of These Nights\" (1975), \"New Kid in Town\" (1976), \"Hotel California\" (1977), \"Heartache Tonight\" (1979) and \"Love Will keep Us Apart\" (after a 1994 reunion).\n\nCreative and personal differences - as well as corporate avarice that's been well-documented - persistently dogged the group. The 1994 reunion tour set records for ticket sales as have subsequent tours.\n\nHenley said a 40th anniversary burst of activity is due in 2012.\n\nHenley, 64, has been the most successful of the Eagles as a solo artist. Each of his four albums since 1982 has achieved gold or platinum status.\n\nMore importantly to him, he's received some of the critical claim and artistic cred that too often - and too inappropriately - eluded the Eagles.\n\nHe also crafted some signature songs with near-Eagle-ian staying power: \"The Boys of Summer\" (1984), \"Dirty Laundry\" (1982), \"All She Wants to Do Is Dance\" (1985), \"The End of the Innocence\" (1989).\n\nAn outspoken advocate for environmental sanity (the Walden Woods Project and others) and musicians' rights in the Internet era, his voice is being heard again.\n\nA 1978 revision of U.S. copyright law now makes it possible for musicians to regain control of their music and recordings. It applies only to music created in or after 1978 and artists must apply three years prior to the March 2013 enforcement date.\n\nLosing control of - and profits from - catalogue recordings by artists of Henley and the Eagles' stature could further damage the major record companies, many of which spent decades exploiting young musicians with onerous and unfathomable contracts.\n\nHenley, who closes out this summer concert series at Ironstone Vineyards in Murphys on Saturday night, discussed some of these issues - and his upcoming fifth album - in a recent email interview with the Record:\n\nQ: How do you see the new copyright regulations playing out? Is there any legitimate defense for the record companies? Are you applying to regain control of your post-1978 songs?\n\nA: There is no predicting what a court of law will do, these days, but all the scholarly opinions I've read come down squarely on the side of the artists - the creators. The record companies have conjured up a lot of red herrings, but, ultimately, I don't think they'll hold up.\n\nAt this point, we have not filed anything with regard to regaining control of our master recordings, but we are discussing it and will likely be filing in the near future. We look at it this way: The labels will have had 35 years in which to exploit our post-1977 albums - works that we created and paid for. All the recording costs were recouped long, long ago and the companies have reaped millions in profits. So why shouldn't we get those copyrights back? They should belong to our children.\n\nQ: You've been an outspoken advocate for musicians rights. Did you know what you were \"getting into\" as young men (Eagles)? Did you keep your publishing? Have things improved at all?\n\nA: We had no idea what we were getting into back in 1971. Very few young artists understand the terms of a recording contract. It's an extremely complex document containing lots of the proverbial \"fine prints.\" Only the most seasoned music attorneys fully fathom these Byzantine bargains.\n\nWe unwittingly signed away half of our publishing rights, which we later retrieved in a legal settlement after we filed suit. But, like so many young hopefuls with stars in their eyes, we had to learn the hard way.\n\nThat's why, when I see the ecstatic winners on one of these \"American Idol\"-type shows, I just smile, shake my head and think, \"Kid, you don't know what you're in for.\"\n\nQ: What's your take on the Internet's continuing impact on creativity, property rights and the record biz?\n\nA: The Internet is a wonderful thing, but it also has a dark side. It fosters a culture of theft, counterfeiting, copyright infringement, invasion of privacy, etc., all aided and abetted by Google and other search engines.\n\nThe Internet is literally killing copyright. It's cultivating a whole new generation that has no respect whatsoever for property rights - for a creator's right to make a living from his work, whether it be a songwriter, an author, a photographer, a journalist or any other persons who create things that can be digitized.\n\nIn the case of the record business, the record companies have mistreated artists and fans. So now the fans are retaliating against the record companies and the artists are caught in the middle. If the record companies don't get paid, then neither do we.\n\nIn the coming years, the sale of recordings will not be profitable at all, so I think we'll see fewer new songs being written and fewer recordings being made. I love my work, but it should be remembered that it is also my livelihood - and the livelihood of singers and songwriters who have been much less fortunate than me.\n\nSomeday soon, Internet piracy very well might lead to the total collapse of the record industry. While I am no fan of the big record labels, I also realize that if they go under, thousands of jobs will be lost - not only jobs in the record, radio and touring businesses, but industry-related jobs such as distribution, accounting, law, electronics, musical instruments, lighting, design, trucking, carpentry and a whole host of other low-profile-but-critical professions.\n\nThe foundation upon which all this commerce rests is the popular song. I would prefer to think of a song as an artistic work, or at least a craftwork, rather than a commodity or a product, but the fact is that it's both.\n\nA good song might retain its artistic or sentimental value for a very long time. When it no longer has any commercial value in the marketplace, all the complex business apparatus that brings it to the marketplace no longer has a reason to exist.\n\nThere has been a lot of hot air devoted to the idea that an artist can successfully promote himself from obscurity to worldwide recognition, simply by way of the Internet, but I haven't seen any evidence of that happening on any kind of meaningful scale.\n\nWithout the proper promotion, which is costly, it's like trying to find a needle in a haystack. This is where the large record companies still hold a trump card. Until somebody comes up with a new model that actually works, it's going to continue to be extremely hard for a young band or solo artist to get started without the support of a major record label, provided any of them still exist.\n\nQ: How is the new album turning out? Does its \"country\" aspect reflect your formative years in Texas?\n\nA: The new album is going extremely well. I've had the opportunity to sing with artists I admire, including Dolly Parton, Alison Krauss, Vince Gill and several others. There will be some surprises on the album, too - some unexpected guests. I hope to get it out next spring.\n\nSome of the music is what might be called \"old school.\" Some of it is more contemporary, but all of it reflects my formative years in Texas.\n\nMy paternal grandfather loved fiddle music, so when I would visit him on weekends, I heard bluegrass music coming out of his old wooden radio. My mother played gospel-style piano, so that was a staple in our home. I heard choirs, both black and white, and my grandmother, as she grew older, would sit in her rocking chair, softly singing hymns to herself.\n\nI listened to Hank Williams and Patsy Cline on the radio with my dad while I rode with him to work. We always tuned in to a program called \"The Louisiana Hayride,\" which was broadcast live from Shreveport, La. I grew up in a part of Texas where the Old South meets the West, so I heard hillbilly music from Arkansas, Cajun music from Louisiana and Western Swing music from Dallas and Fort Worth.\n\nThere was a rich folk and blues tradition, as well. Scott Joplin and T-Bone Walker were both born in my hometown (Gilmer), which has a population of less than 2,500. Lead Belly (Huddie Ledbetter) was also born and raised in that area and I visit his grave from time to time. So, I'm a musical mutt because I grew up in a musical, cultural crossroads. Like many of my musical heroes, I am literally from \"the country\" - the sticks - and it has been a great catalyst for me.\n\nQ: What motivated your ongoing involvement and activism in environmental and other charitable/philanthropic endeavors?\n\nA: Well, it's a basic rule of camping, isn't it? I was always taught to leave a campsite in better condition than I found it. Since we're all just camping out here on this earth, I think the same rule would apply. I have four great kids and I don't want them to inherit a used-up, burned-out world. I want them to inherit a world of wonder and opportunity.\n\nQ: For a show like Ironstone Vineyards, do you pretty much play tracks from \"The Very Best of Don Henley\"? Any new songs and/or Eagles faves included?\n\nA: We'll do some new songs by a couple of young songwriters that I've discovered this past year, as well as my solo stuff and some Eagles favorites. But, people shouldn't come out expecting an \"Eagles Greatest Hits\" show. That's not what I'm doing.\n\nQ: Any upcoming Eagles plans? How do you view the group's ongoing influence and legacy?\n\nA: Spring 2012 will mark the 40th anniversary of the Eagles' debut on the airwaves. We've got several projects in the works, including a record, a documentary, more touring and, in a couple of years, a theatrical production based on our musical catalog.\n\nAs for our influence and legacy, those are things I don't spend time thinking about. That's very subjective stuff and we have no control over that. We just concentrate on what we're doing at present and strive to do good work. That's the way we've always operated.\n\nQ: Where does the protagonist of \"Johnny Can't Read\" (a song on \"I Can't Stand Still,\" Henley's 1982 solo debut) stand in today's world?\n\nA: He is jobless with a difficult future ahead of him. The literacy rate in this country varies from state to state, but, overall, it is still lower than it should be. The high school dropout rate is a little over 8 percent.\n\nThough this is about half the dropout rate of 30 years ago, the number of under-educated adults attempting to join the work force presents a significant obstacle to economic security.\n\nConsidering that the U.S. economy is already struggling, the fact that there will be a shortage of 7 million properly educated workers by 2012 will make an economic recovery even more difficult.\n\nWe're all much too distracted, these days, with our electronic gadgets. We've all got ADD. It's time to get back to basics."
