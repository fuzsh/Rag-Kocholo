        "text": "Linda Ronstadt was raised in Tucson, Arizona. Growing up, she listened to many types of music, including folk, rock & roll, country, opera, pop standards, and Mexican ballads, the last of which reflected her father’s heritage. Throughout her decades-long career, she experimented with these genres and worked with many different musicians, including members of the Eagles, Dolly Parton, and Emmylou Harris. She also made appearances on The Johnny Cash Show, and on Dolly Parton’s TV show, Dolly. In the 1970s, Linda earned the nickname “Queen of Country-Rock,” for her country-rock music. Later in her career, she leaned into her Mexican heritage and released albums of Spanish-language music that she grew up hearing from her father. The versatility and talent shown by Linda have cemented her as one of the most successful and influential vocalists of our time.\n\nWe use cookies in the following ways: (1) for system administration, (2) to assess the performance of the website, (3) to personalize your experience, content and ads, (4) to provide social media features, and (5) to analyze our traffic.
