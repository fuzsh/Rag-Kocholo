        "text": "Born into a pioneering Tucson family, Linda Ronstadt is a talented and versatile singer who for over 4 decades has embraced many musical styles from rock, folk, and country to covering family songs her father brought from his native Mexico. The Ronstadt family name is well known in Tucson first as a successful turn of the century wagon maker to local contemporary hardware store. Many other extended members of the Ronstadt family played and sang music. Linda drew musical inspiration and was greatly influenced by them.\n\nIn the mid-60’s Linda moved to the Los Angeles music scene. Early success would be with a group called the STONE PONYS. Their hits included DIFFERENT DRUM to LONG LONG TIME. Linda has won several Grammy Awards and a roomful of trophies and platinum albums and is one of the greatest voices and song stylists in music and entertainment history. Linda Ronstadt is Arizona homegrown\n\n(bio by Jim West)"
