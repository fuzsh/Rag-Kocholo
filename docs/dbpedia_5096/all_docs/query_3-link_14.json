        "text": "If Theodore is catching on, how ’bout this related name?\n\nThanks to Caitlin for suggesting Theophile as our Baby Name of the Day.\n\nFile Theophile with Theodule and Theodosia – an unusual Theo- name that has undeniably seen use, but has mostly faded, at least in English.\n\nTheophile is the French form of the Greek Theophilos, Theophilus in Latin – theos refers to God, and philos to love, so Theophile is loved by God, or one who loves God, or maybe just a friend of God.\n\nThe name was in use in the ancient world. Coins tell us that an Indo-Greek king, somewhere in the last two centuries BC, wore the name. And Plutarch quoted an earlier writer’s work on the geography of Italy – the writer was also Theophilus.\n\nThen comes the New Testament. Both the Gospel of Luke and the Acts of the Apostles are dedicated to Theophilus. But exactly who Theophilus is remains unclear. There are three possibilities:\n\nIt could be the given name of a historical figure.\n\nIt could be an honorific used for a real person.\n\nIt could be a general form of address, something like writing to “dear Friend.”\n\nTheories abound, but let’s leave with this: all of the Theophil- names are ancient, indeed.\n\nHistory gives us many more bearers of the name:\n\nIn the late eleventh and early twelfth centuries, someone – possibly a Benedictine monk – wrote under the pen name Theophilus Presbyter. Writing in Latin, he compiled descriptions of various medieval arts, from painting and drawing to creating stained glass windows and building organs. It’s quite the tome.\n\nHere’s one of my favorites – Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart was baptized Johannes Chrysostomus Wolfgangus Theophilus. The first two – Johannes Chrysostomus – were given in honor of his day of birth, January 27, the Feast of John Chrysostum. Wolfgang was a family name, and Theophilus the name of one of his godfathers. Theophilus became Amadeus in Latin, and Gottlieb in German. It’s an interesting piece of name history, but Mozart was rarely referred to as Theophilus, and never in the course of his musical career.\n\nThe first governor of New Haven Colony in Connecticut was Theophilus Eaton.\n\nNineteenth century French poet, travel writer, and art critic Théophile Gautier, has been cited as an influence by writers as distinguished – and different – as Honore de Balzac, T.S. Eliot, and Oscar Wilde. He was a devotee of the Romantic Ballet, and extraordinarily well-traveled – his writing took him to Spain, Italy, Egypt, Algeria, and Russia. Later in life he became part of Princess Mathilde Bonaparte’s court, officially serving as her librarian.\n\nThornton Wilder’s last novel was the semi-autobiographical Theophilus North.\n\nRapper Theophilus London was born in Brooklyn of Trinidadian descent.\n\nIt’s Teofilo in Italian, Spanish, and Portuguese, and there are a handful of notable examples of both.\n\nFrom history to literature to music, there’s a Theophilus for nearly everyone. Theophile is much harder to pin down, and according to Meilleurs Prenoms, he’s rarely bestowed upon boys in France today.\n\nStill, you’ll find the occasional Theophile in the US, mostly in Cajun families.\n\nIs he wearable in 2014? Maybe. Theophilus could blend in with other ancient names like Atticus and Augustus. Plus, the nickname Theo is very stylish.\n\nWhat do you think of Theophile? Is he wearable in 2014?\n\nRelated articles"
