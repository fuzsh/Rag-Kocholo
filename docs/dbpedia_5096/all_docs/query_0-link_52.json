Contributors to this work include Victor Hugo, Emile Blemont, Leon Cladel, E Corra, John Payne and Swinburne. All poems to this work are in the original language. Therefore, the majority of the work is in French, with the poems by Swinburne and Payne typically in English. Algernon Swinburne contributed six poems, four of which are in English, one in Latin, and one in Greek. All of the poems to this work, are in honour of Pierre Jules Theophile Gautier. With a frontispiece of Gautier. Loosely inserted is a portion of what was the original front wrap. Theophile Gautier was a French author, who penned poems, plays and novels as well as his many works of criticism. Gautier's works were difficult to classify, and contain elements of many subsequent literary traditions such as Parnassianism, Symbolism, Decadence and Modernism. This is a fascinating work, with many famed contributors. In a half calf binding with paper covered boards. Externally, in an excellent condition with just minor shelfwear. Internally, firmly bound. Pages have deckled edges, which are slightly age toned. Occasional light spots to pages. Very Good Indeed - Le Tombeau de Theophile Gautier",
