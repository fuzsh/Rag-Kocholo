Tagged: Author.\n\n(1811-1872) French author, a leading figure in the Romantic movement; father of Judith Gautier. Many of his works, including the lushly erotic Mademoiselle de Maupin (1835) – which is prefaced by his manifesto for \"l'art pour l'art\" – are so self-consciously exotic as to qualify as borderline fantasies even though without supernatural content [for fuller entry on Gautier see The Encyclopedia of Fantasy under links below].\n\nOf Gautier's eight novels, two are of some sf interest. Les deux étoiles [\"The Two Stars\"] (20 September-15 October 1848 La Presse; 1848; rev vt Partie carrée [\"Menage à quatre\"] 1851 3vols) [for further details see Checklist below], is a spoof of exorbitant tales of adventure, climaxing in the attempted rescue of Napoleon from St Helena by submarine (see Under the Sea). And Le Roman de La Momie (1858; trans Anne T Wilbur as Anne T Wood as Romance of the Mummy 1863) depicts the discovery of an intact millennia-old mummy in Egypt, and the unexplained transference of its memories, which ravish the discoverer, who may have experienced a form of Timeslip. But Gautier remains of greater contemporary interest for his shorter works. The first compendious translation of hiss tales into English, One of Cleopatra's Nights (coll trans Lafcadio Hearn 1882), contains a representative sample of this work; Hearn's translations were being reprinted in various formats as late as 2011, though not always acknowledged [for details on stories in this collection, and for selected republications of Hearn's renderings, see Checklist below]. The title novella is a fantasia on the personality of Cleopatra; Clarimonde is a Vampire tale; in \"Arria Marcella\", which is a Timeslip romance, a She figure seduces a young man in the ruins of Pompeii; in \"Omphale: A Rococo Story\" a tapestry comes to life; the original to whom the eponymous Mummy's Foot was once affixed appears to the contemporary gentleman, who is using it as a paperweight, and requests its return.\n\nTales of interest not translated by Hearn include Avatar (feuilleton 29 February-3 April 1856 Le Moniteur universel: 1857; trans anon as Avatar; Or, the Double Transformation 1888), the story of an ill fated Identity Exchange; Jettatura (1857; trans M de L 1888), which examines the plight of a man who unwittingly falls prey to an unfortunate curse; and Spirite; nouvelle fantastique (feuilleton 17 November-6 December 1865 Le Moniteur universel; 1866; trans anon as Spirite: A Fantasy 1877), a sentimental tale of a love affair between a young man and a female ghost.\n\nGautier's best-known shorter work of direct sf interest is \"Paris Futur\" (December 1851 Le Pays; trans Brian Stableford as \"Future Paris\" in Investigations of the Future, anth 2012, edited by Stableford), a perhaps insufficiently fictionalized description of the technological triumph of the soon-to-be-rebuilt City, whose soaring expectations are based on a profound Underground fundament (see Ruins and Futurity).

For clarity, a selection of individual works with translations is listed immediately below; selected collections of works translated into English are listed below under Collections in Translation. It should be noted that Gautier's tales, because they are novella-length, often appear both separately and in collections.\n\n\"Omphale\" (1834 Journal du monde artiste fashionable as \"La Tapisserie amoureuse\") [mag/]\n\nLa morte amoureuse (Paris: Librarie de la Collection de Dix, 1904) [novelette: first appeared 1836 La Chronique de Paris: illus/hb/A-P Lauren]\n\nClarimonde (New York: Brentano, 1899) [chap: trans by Lafcadio Hearn (see One of Cleopatra's Nights under Collections below) of the above: hb/]\n\nClairmonde: Vampire and Harlot (Girard, Kansas: Haldeman-Julius Company, circa 1922) [chap: vt of the above: hb/]\n\nThe Beautiful Vampire (London: A M Philpot, 1926) [vt of the above: hb/]\n\n\"The Dead Leman\" in The Dead Leman and Other Tales from the French (London: Swan Sonnenschein and Company, 1889) [trans by Andrew Lang and Paul Sylvester of the above: hb/]\n\nUne Nuit de Cléopâtre (Paris: A Ferroud, 1894) [novella: chap: first appeared 29 November-6 December 1838 La Presse: introduction by Anatole France: hb/]\n\nCleopatra (London: H S Nichols, 1899) [novella: trans by Lafcadio Hearn (see One of Cleopatra's Nights under Collections below) of the above: hb/]\n\nOne of Cleopatra's Nights (Chicago, Illinois: Privately Printed, 1929) [novella: trans by Lafcadio Hearn (see One of Cleopatra's Nights under Collections below) of the above: hb/]\n\nFortunio (Paris: Desessart, 1838) [first appeared 28 May-14 July 1837 Le Figaro as \"L'Eldorado\": binding unknown/]\n\nFortunio (New York: The Jenson Society, 1907) [omni with other titles: trans by F C de Sumichrast of the above: hb/nonpictorial]\n\n\"Le pied de momie\" (September 1840 Le Musée des families) [mag/]\n\nThe Mummy's Foot (no place given: Project Gutenberg, 2007) [story: ebook;
