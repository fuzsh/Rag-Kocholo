        "text": "The product material choices\n\nIn the dropdown lists right next to the product offering you can pick the size and material of your choice. We allow yout to choose among the following variants:\n\nCanvas print: The printed canvas material applied on a wood frame. It makes the typical effect of three-dimensionality. The great advantage of canvas prints is that they are relatively low in weight, which means that it is easy and straightforward to hang up the Canvas print without the use of extra wall-mounts. A canvas print is suitable for any kind of wall.\n\nAluminium dibond print: These are metal prints on aluminium dibond with an outstanding depth, which creates a fashionable impression with a surface , which is non-reflective. The white and bright parts of the artpiece shine with a silk gloss, however without the glow. The colors are luminous in the highest definition, details of the print are clear and crisp, and there’s a matte look that you can literally feel.\n\nPoster (canvas material): The Artprinta poster is a UV printed canvas paper with a fine surface texture. It is excellently appropriate for framing the art print in a special frame. Please note, that depending on the size of the poster we add a white margin of approximately 2 - 6cm round about the print motif, which facilitates the framing with a custom frame.\n\nThe acrylic glass print (with real glass coating): The acrylic glass print, which is often referenced as a UV print on plexiglass, transforms your chosen artwork into wonderful décor. The artwork is printed with modern UV direct printing machines. This creates the impression of intense and deep color tones.\n\nLegal note: We strive to describe our products as closely as possible and to exhibit them visually. However, the tone of the printed materials, as well as the imprint can differ to a certain extent from the image on your monitor. Depending on your settings of your screen and the condition of the surface, not all colors can be printed as realistically as the digital version depicted here. Since all our art prints are printed and processed manually, there might as well be minor discrepancies in the motif's exact position and the size.\n\nOriginal artwork description from Maison de Balzac Paris (© - Maison de Balzac Paris - Maison de Balzac Paris)\n\nBlond woman wearing in dating back loops; wide-brimmed hat, with a white feather and white satin ribbons and cherry. fluted white collar.
