        "text": "Boulevard des Airs\n\nBoulevard des Airs (BDA) is a French pop band with catchy tunes, meaningful lyrics and a touch of electro!\n\nBDA is a group of friends who are all from Tarbes and in 2004 decided to form a band. Sylvain Duthu, Florent and Jean-Noël Dasque, Jérémie Planté, and Laurent Garnier are all a part of this exciting adventure and each brings his own style and influence.\n\nAfter years of hard work, their album ‘Bruxelles’ propelled them to fame when it went double platinum in 2015. In 2018, they won the song of the year at the Victoire de la Musique competition with their song ‘Je me dis que toi aussi’.\n\nAs they became more and more well-known, they were invited to perform at some of the big festivals in France such as the Francofolies and Garorock, and to team up with some big names, such as Dj Snake, Vianney, Tryo, LEJ, Patrick Bruel, Yannick Noah, Claudio Capéo, Lola Dubini, Jérémy Frérot, and many more.\n\nThe band likes to do their part in helping others and so they composed the song for the charity event Les Enfoirés 2020, ‘A côté de toi’, along with Tibz and prepared the launch of their very own label to help young artists break into the music scene!\n\nThey are attached to their hometown and continue to compose and produce their work here. It’s not rare to see them performing at Chez Marcel or just enjoying a drink with friends.\n\nDavid Fray\n\nDavid Fray was born in Tarbes in 1981 and is an international renowned pianist.\n\nDavid Fray’s parents were both teachers and he started playing the piano at a very young age. At the age of 14, he was honoured by the Conservatoire de Tarbes and then at the age of 18 he joined the ‘Conservatoire National Supérieur de Musique et de Danse’ in Paris and graduated with distinction. David Fray was then accepted onto a postgraduate course with Jacques Rouvier, and then went on to study chamber music. Since finishing his studies, he has been performing on some of the most prestigious stages and plays with international orchestras. He performs all over the world.\n\nTreat yourselves to a concert in Tarbes!
