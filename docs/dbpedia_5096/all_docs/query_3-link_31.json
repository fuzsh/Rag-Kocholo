Art\n\nTHE GOD AND THE OPAL\n\nTO THÉOPHILE GAUTIER\n\nGray caught he from the cloud, and green from earth,\n\nAnd from a human breast the fire he drew,\n\nAnd life and death were blended in one dew.\n\nA sunbeam golden with the morning's mirth,\n\nA wan, salt phantom from the sea, a girth\n\nOf silver from the moon, shot colour through\n\nThe soul invisible, until it grew\n\nTo fulness, and the Opal Song had birth.\n\nAnd then the god became the artisan.\n\nWith rarest skill he made his gem to glow,\n\nCarving and shaping it to beauty such\n\nThat down the cycles it shall gleam to man,\n\nAnd evermore man's wonderment shall know\n\nThe perfect finish, the immortal touch.\n\nAgnes Lee.\n\nPREFACE\n\nWhen empires lay riven apart,\n\nFared Goethe at battle time's thunder\n\nTo fragrant oases of art,\n\nTo weave his Divan into wonder.\n\nLeaving Shakespeare, he pondered the note\n\nOf Nisami, and heard in his leisure\n\nThe hoopoe's weird monody float,\n\nAnd set it to soft Orient measure.\n\nAs Goethe at Weimar delayed\n\nAnd dreamed in the fair garden closes,\n\nAnd, questing in sun or in shade,\n\nWith Hafiz plucked redolent roses,\n\nI, closed from the tempest that shook\n\nMy window with fury impassioned,\n\nSat dreaming, and, safe in my nook,\n\nEnamels and Cameos fashioned.\n\nAFFINITY\n\nA PANTHEISTIC MADRIGAL\n\nOn an ancient temple gleaming,\n\nTwo great blocks of marble high\n\nThrice a thousand years lay dreaming\n\nDreams against an Attic sky.\n\nSet within one silver whiteness,\n\nTwo wave-tears for Venus shed,\n\nTwo fair pearls of orient brightness,\n\nThrough the waste of water sped.\n\nIn the Generalife's fresh closes,\n\nBy a Moorish light illumed,\n\nTwo delicious, tender roses\n\nBy a fountain met and bloomed.\n\nIn the balm of May's bright weather,\n\nWhere the domes of Venice rise,\n\nLighted on Love's nest together\n\nTwo pale doves from azure skies.\n\nAll things vanish into wonder,\n\nMarble, pearl, dove, rose on tree,\n\nPearl shall melt and marble sunder,\n\nFlower shall fade and bird shall flee!\n\nNot a smallest part but lowly\n\nThrough the crucible must pass,\n\nWhere all shapes are molten slowly\n\nIn the universal mass.\n\nThen as gradual Time discloses\n\nMarbles melt to whitest skin,\n\nRoses red to lips of roses,\n\nAnd anew the lives begin.\n\nAnd again the doves are plighted\n\nIn the hearts of lovers, while\n\nOcean pearls are reunited,\n\nSet within a coral smile.\n\nThus affinity comes welling;\n\nBy its beauty everywhere\n\nSoul a sister-soul foretelling,\n\nAll awakened and aware.\n\nQuickened by a zephyr sunny,\n\nOr a perfume, subtlewise,\n\nAs the bee unto the honey,\n\nAtom unto atom flies.\n\nAnd remembered are the hours\n\nIn the temple, down the blue,\n\nAnd the talks amid the flowers,\n\nNear the fount of crystal dew,\n\nKisses warm, and on the royal\n\nGolden domes the wings that beat;\n\nFor the atoms all are loyal,\n\nAnd again must love and greet.\n\nLove forgotten wakes imperious,\n\nFor the past is never dead,\n\nAnd the rose with joy delirious\n\nBreathes again from lips of red.\n\nMarble on the flesh of maiden\n\nFeels its own white bloom, and faint\n\nKnows the dove a murmur laden\n\nWith the echo of its plaint,\n\nTill resistance giveth over,\n\nAnd the barriers fall undone,\n\nAnd the stranger is the lover,\n\nAnd affinity hath won!\n\nYou before whose face I tremble,\n\nSaywhat past we know not of\n\nCalled our fates to reassemble,\n\nPearl or marble, rose or dove?\n\nTHE POEM OF WOMAN\n\nMARBLE OF PAROS\n\nUnto the dreamer once whose heart she had,\n\nAs she was showing forth her treasures rare,\n\nMinded she was to read a poem fair,\n\nThe poem of her form with beauty glad.\n\nFirst stately and superb she swept before\n\nHis gazing eyes, with high, Infanta mien,\n\nTrailing behind her all the splendid sheen\n\nOf nacarat floods of velvet that she wore.\n\nThus at the opera had he watched her bend\n\nFrom out her box, her body one bright flame,\n\nWhen all the air was ringing with her name,\n\nAnd every song made her fair praise ascend.\n\nThen had her art another way, for look!\n\nThe weighty velvet dropped, and in its place\n\nA pale and cloudy fabric proved the grace\n\nOf every line her glowing body took;\n\nTill softly from her shoulder marble-sweet\n\nThe veil diaphanous fell, the folds whereof\n\nCame fluttering downward like a snowy dove,\n\nTo nestle in the wonder of her feet.\n\nShe posed as for Apelles pridefully,\n\nA lovely flesh and marble womanhood:\n\nAnadyomene, she upright stood\n\nNaked upon the margent of the sea.\n\nFairer than any foam-drops crystalline,\n\nGreat pearls of Venice lay upon her breast,\n\nJewels of milky wonder lightly pressed\n\nUpon the cool, fresh satin of her skin.\n\nExhaustless as the waves that kiss the brim,\n\nUnder the gleaming moon of many moods,\n\nWere all the strophes of her attitudes.\n\nWhat fascination sang her beauty's hymn!\n\nBut soon, grown weary of an art antique,\n\nOf Phidias and of Venus, lo! again\n\nWithin another new and plastic strain\n\nShe grouped her charms unveiled and unique.\n\nUpon a cashmere opulently spread,\n\nSultana of Seraglio then she lay,\n\nLaughing unto her little mirror gay,\n\nThat laughed again with lips of coral red;\n\nThe indolent, soft Georgian, posturing\n\nWith her long, supple narghile at lip,\n\nShowing the glorious fashion of her hip,\n\nOne foot upon the other languishing.\n\nAnd, like to Ingres' Odalisque, supine,\n\nDefying prurient modesty turned she,\n\nDisplaying in her beauty candidly\n\nWonder of curve and purity of line.\n\nBut hence, thou idle Odalisque! for life\n\nHath now its own fair picture to display\n\nThe diamond in its rare effulgent ray,\n\nBeauty in Love hath reached its blossom rife.\n\nShe sways her body, bendeth back her head.\n\nHer breathing comes more subtle and more fast.\n\nRocked in her dream's alluring arms, at last\n\nDown hath she fallen upon her costly bed.\n\nHer eyelids beat like fluttering pinions lit\n\nUpon the darkened silver of her eyes.\n\nHer bright, voluptuous glances upward rise\n\nInto the vague and nacreous infinite.\n\nDeck her with sweet, lush violets, instead\n\nOf death-flowers with their every pearl a tear;\n\nScatter their purple clusters on her bier,\n\nWho of her being's ecstasy lies dead.\n\nAnd bear her very gently to her tomb\n\nHer bed of white. There let the poet stay,\n\nLong hours upon his bended knees to pray,\n\nWhen night shall close around the funeral room.\n\nA STUDY OF HANDS\n\nI\n\nIMPERIA\n\nA sculptor showed to me one day\n\nA hand, a Cleopatra's lure,\n\nOr an Aspasia's, cast in clay,\n\nOf masterwork a fragment pure.\n\nSeized in a snowy kiss, and fair\n\nAs lily in the argent rise\n\nOf dawn, like whitest poem there\n\nIts beauty lay before mine eyes,\n\nBright in its pallor lustreless,\n\nReposing on a velvet bed,\n\nIts fingers, weighted with their dress\n\nOf jewels, delicately spread.\n\nA little parted lay the thumb,\n\nShowing the undulating line,\n\nBeautiful, graceful, subtlesome,\n\nOf its proud contour Florentine.\n\nStrange hand! I wonder if it toyed\n\nIn silken locks of Don Juan,\n\nOr on a gem-bright caftan joyed\n\nTo stroke the beard of some soldan;\n\nWhether, as courtesan or queen,\n\nWithin its fingers fair and slight\n\nWas pleasure's gilded sceptre seen,\n\nOr sceptre of a royal might!\n\nBut sweet and firm it must have lain\n\nFull oft its touch of power rare\n\nUpon the curling lion-mane\n\nOf some chimera caught in air.\n\nImperial, idle fantasy,\n\nAnd love of soft, luxurious things,\n\nFrenzies of passion, wondrous, free,\n\nImpossible dream-flutterings!\n\nRomances wild, and poesy\n\nOf hasheech and of wine, vain speeds\n\nBeneath Bohemia's brilliant sky\n\nOn unrestrained and maddened steeds!\n\nAll these were in the lines of it,\n\nOf that white book with magic scrolled,\n\nWhere ciphers stood, by Venus writ,\n\nThat Love had trembled to behold.\n\nII\n\nLACENAIRE\n\nStrange contrast was the severed hand\n\nOf Lacenaire, the murderer dead,\n\nSoaked in a powerful essence, and\n\nNear by upon a cushion spread.\n\nLetting a morbid fancy win,\n\nI touched, despite my loathing sane,\n\nThe cold, hair-covered, slimy skin,\n\nNot yet washed clean of deathly stain.\n\nYellow, uncanny, mummified,\n\nLike to a Pharaoh's hand it lay,\n\nAnd stretched its faun-shaped fingers wide,\n\nCrisp with temptation's awful play;\n\nAs though an itch for flesh and gold\n\nLured them to horrors yet to be,\n\nTwisting them roughly as of old,\n\nTeasing their immobility.\n\nThere every vice and passion's whim\n\nHad seamed the flesh abundantly\n\nWith hideous hieroglyphs and grim,\n\nThat headsmen read with fluency.\n\nThere plainly writ in furrows fell,\n\nI saw the deeds of sin and soil,\n\nScorchings from every fiery hell\n\nWherein corruptions seethe and boil.\n\nThere was a track of Capri's vice,\n\nOf lupanars and gaming-scores,\n\nFretted with wine and blood and dice,\n\nLike ennui of old emperors.\n\nSupple and fierce, it had some dower\n\nOf grace unto the searching eye,\n\nSome brutal fascination's power,\n\nA gladiator's mastery.\n\nCold aristocracy of crime!\n\nNo plane inured, no hammer spent\n\nThe hand whose task for every time\n\nHad but the knife for implement.\n\nThe hand of Lacenaire! No clue\n\nTherein to labour's honest pride!\n\nFalse poet, and assassin true,\n\nThe Manfred of the gutter died!\n\nVARIATIONS ON THE CARNIVAL OF VENICE\n\nI\n\nON THE STREET\n\nThere is a popular old air\n\nThat every fiddler loves to scrape.\n\n'T is wrung from organs everywhere,\n\nTo barking dog with wrath agape.\n\nThe music-box has registered\n\nIts phrases garbled and reviled.\n\n'T is classic to the household bird;\n\nGrandmother learned it as a child.\n\nThe trumpet and the clarinet,\n\nIn dusty gardens of the dance,\n\nBlow it to clerk and gay grisette,\n\nIn shrill, unlovely resonance.\n\nAnd of a Sunday swarm the folk\n\nUnder the honeysuckle vine,\n\nQuaffing, the while they talk and smoke,\n\nThe sun, the melody, the wine.\n\nIt lurks within the wry bassoon\n\nThe blind man plays, the porch beneath.\n\nHis poodle whimpers low the tune,\n\nAnd holds the cup between its teeth.\n\nThe players of the light guitar,\n\nDecked with their flimsy tartans, pale,\n\nWith voices sad, where feasters are,\n\nThrough coffee-houses fling its wail.\n\nGreat Paganini at a sign,\n\nOne night, as with a needle's gleam,\n\nPicked up with end of bow divine\n\nThe little antiquated theme,\n\nAnd, threading it with fingers deft,\n\nHe broidered it with colours bright,\n\nTill up and down the faded weft\n\nRan golden arabesques of light.\n\nII\n\nON THE LAGOONS\n\nTra la, tra la, la, la, la,who\n\nKnows not the theme's soft spell?\n\nOr sad or light or mock or true,\n\nOur mothers loved it well.\n\nThe Carnival of Venice! Long\n\nAdown canals it came,\n\nTill, wafted on a zephyr's song,\n\nThe ballet kept its fame.\n\nI seem, whene'er its phrase I hear,\n\nA gondola to view,\n\nWith prow voluted, black and clear,\n\nSlip o'er the water blue;\n\nTo see, her bosom covered o'er\n\nWith pearls, her body suave,\n\nThe Adriatic Venus soar\n\nOn sound's chromatic wave.\n\nThe domes that on the water dwell\n\nPursue the melody\n\nIn clear-drawn cadences, and swell\n\nLike breasts of love that sigh.\n\nMy chains around a pillar cast,\n\nI land before a fair\n\nAnd rosy-pale facade at last,\n\nUpon a marble stair.\n\nOh! all dear Venice with her towers,\n\nHer boats, her masquers boon,\n\nHer sweet chagrins, her mad, gay hours,\n\nThrobs in that ancient tune.\n\nThe tenuous, vibrant chords that smite,\n\nRebuild in subtle way\n\nThe city joyous, free and light\n\nOf Canaletto's day!\n\nIII\n\nCARNIVAL\n\nVenice robes her for the ball;\n\nDecked with spangles bright,\n\nMulti-coloured Carnival\n\nTeems with laughter light.\n\nHarlequin with negro mask,\n\nTights of serpent hue,\n\nBeateth with a note fantasque\n\nHis Cassander true.\n\nFlapping loose his long, white sleeve,\n\nLike a penguin spread,\n\nThrough a subtle semibreve\n\nPierrot thrusts his head.\n\nSleek Bologna's doctor goes\n\nMaundering on a bass.\n\nPunchinello finds for nose\n\nQuaver on his face.\n\nHurtling Trivellino fine,\n\nOn a trill intent,\n\nScaramouch to Columbine\n\nGives the fan she lent.\n\nGliding to the tune, I mark\n\nOne veiled figure rise,\n\nWhile through satin lashes dark\n\nLuring gleam her eyes.\n\nTender little edge of lace,\n\nHeaving with her breath!\n\n\"Under is her own dear face!\"\n\nAn arpeggio saith.\n\nAnd beneath the mask I know\n\nBloom of rosy lips,\n\nAnd the patch on chin of snow,\n\nAs she by me trips!\n\nIV\n\nMOONLIGHT\n\nAmid the chatter gay and mad\n\nSaint Mark to Lido wafts, a tune\n\nLike as a rocket riseth glad\n\nAs fountain riseth to the moon.\n\nBut in that air with laughter stirred,\n\nThat shakes its bells far out to sea,\n\nRegret, a little stifled bird,\n\nMingles its frail sob audibly.\n\nAnd in a mist of memory clad,\n\nLike dream well-nigh effaced, I view\n\nThe sweet Beloved, fair and sad,\n\nOf dear, long-vanished days I knew.\n\nAh, pale she is! My soul in tears\n\nAn April day remembers yet:\n\nWe sought the violets by the meres,\n\nAnd in the grass our fingers met. . .\n\nThe vibrant note of violin\n\nIs the child voice that struck my heart,\n\nExquisite, plaintive, argentine,\n\nWith all the anguish of its dart.\n\nSo sweetly, falsely, doth it steal,\n\nSo cruel, yet so tender, too,\n\nSo cold, so burning, that I feel\n\nA deadly pleasure pierce me through;\n\nUntil my heart, an archway deep\n\nWhose waters feed the fountain's lip,\n\nLets tears of blood in silence weep\n\nInto my bosom drip by drip.\n\nO Carnival of Venice!theme\n\nSo chilling sad, yet ever warm!\n\nWhere laughter toucheth tears supreme,\n\nHow hast thou hurt me with thy charm!\n\nSYMPHONY IN WHITE MAJOR\n\nIn the Northern tales of eld,\n\nFrom the Rhine's escarpments high\n\nSwan-women radiant were beheld,\n\nSinging and floating by,\n\nOr, leaving their plumage bright\n\nOn a bough that was bending low,\n\nDisplaying skin more gleaming white\n\nThan the white of their down of snow.\n\nAt times one comes our way,\n\nOf all she is pallidest,\n\nWhite as the moonbeam's shivering ray\n\nOn a glacier's icy crest.\n\nHer boreal bloom doth win\n\nOur eyes to feasting rare\n\nOn rich delight of nacreous skin,\n\nAnd a wealth of whiteness fair.\n\nHer rounded breasts, pale globes\n\nOf snow, wage insolent war\n\nWith her camellias and her robes\n\nOf whiteness nebular.\n\nIn such white wars supreme\n\nShe wins, and weft and flower\n\nLeave their revenge's right, and seem\n\nYellowed with envy's hour.\n\nOn the white of her shoulder bare,\n\nWhose marble Paros lends,\n\nAs through the Polar twilight fair,\n\nInvisible frost descends.\n\nWhat beaming virgin snow,\n\nWhat pith a reed within,\n\nWhat Host, what taper, did bestow\n\nThe white of her matchless skin?\n\nWas she made of a milky drop\n\nOn the blue of a winter heaven?\n\nThe lily-blow on the stem's green top?\n\nThe foam of the sea at even?\n\nOf the marble still and cold,\n\nWherein the great gods dwell?\n\nOf creamy opal gems that hold\n\nFaint fires of mystic spell?\n\nOr the organ's ivory keys?\n\nHer wingèd fingers oft\n\nLike butterflies flit over these,\n\nWith kisses pending soft.\n\nOf the ermine's stainless fold,\n\nWhose white, warm touches fall\n\nOn shivering shoulders and on bold,\n\nBright shields armorial?\n\nOf the phantom flowers of frost\n\nEnscrolled on the window clear?\n\nOf the fountain drop in the chill air lost,\n\nAn Undine's frozen tear?\n\nOf May bent low with the sweets\n\nOf her bountiful white-thorn bloom?\n\nOf alabaster that repeats\n\nThe pallor of grief and gloom?\n\nOf the feathers of doves that slip\n\nAnd snow on the gable steep?\n\nOf slow stalactite's tear-white drip\n\nIn cavernous places deep?\n\nCame she from Greenland floes\n\nWith Seraphita forth?\n\nIs she Madonna of the Snows?\n\nA sphinx of the icy North,\n\nSphinx buried by avalanche,\n\nThe glacier's guardian ghost,\n\nWhose frozen secrets hide and blanch\n\nIn her white heart innermost?\n\nWhat magic of what far name\n\nShall this pale soul ignite?\n\nAh! who shall flush with rose's flame\n\nThis cold, implacable white?\n\nCOQUETRY IN DEATH\n\nI beg ye grant, when low I lie,\n\nBefore ye close my coffin-bed,\n\nA little black beneath mine eye,\n\nAnd on my cheek a touch of red!\n\nAh, make me beautiful as now!\n\nFor I would be upon my bier,\n\nAs on the night of his avow\n\nCharming and bloomful, gay and dear.\n\nFor me no linen winding-sheet!\n\nBut gown me very grand and bright.\n\nBring forth my frock of muslin sweet,\n\nWith many ruffles soft and white.\n\nMy favourite frock! I wore it well,\n\nWho wore it at love's flowering.\n\nAnd since his look upon it fell,\n\nI've kept it as a sacred thing.\n\nFor me no funeral coronet,\n\nNo tear-embroidered cushion place;\n\nBut o 'er my fair lace pillow let\n\nMy hair droop free about my face.\n\nDear pillow! Often did it mark,\n\nIn mad, sweet nights our brows unlit,\n\nAnd, all within the gondola dark,\n\nDid count our kisses infinite.\n\nAbout my waxen hands supine,\n\nFolded in prayer at life's deep gloam,\n\nMy rosary of opals twine,\n\nBlessed by His Holiness at Rome.\n\nI'll finger it, when bedded cold\n\nWhere never one shall rise. How oft\n\nHis lips upon my lips have told\n\nA Pater and an Ave soft!\n\nHEART'S DIAMOND\n\nEvery lover deep hath set\n\nIn a sacred nook apart\n\nSome dear token for the heart\n\nIn its hope or its regret.\n\nOne hath nested safe away\n\nBlackest ringlet ever seen,\n\nOver which an azure sheen\n\nLieth, as on wing of jay.\n\nOne from shoulder pale as milk\n\nTook a tress more golden-fine\n\nThan the threads that softly shine\n\nIn the silk-worm's wonder-silk.\n\nIn its hiding mystical,\n\nMemory's reliquary sweet,\n\nGlances of another greet\n\nGloves with fingers white and small.\n\nAnd another yet may list\n\nTo inhale a faint perfume\n\nOf the violets from her room,\n\nFreshly givenfaded, kissed.\n\nHere a slipper's curving grace\n\nOne with sighing treasureth.\n\nThere another guards a breath\n\nIn a mask's light edge of lace.\n\nI've no slipper to revere,\n\nNeither glove nor tress nor flower;\n\nBut I cherish for love's dower\n\nA divine, adorèd tear,\n\nFallen from the blue above,\n\nClearest dew, heaven's drop for me,\n\nPearl dissolved secretly\n\nIn the chalice of my love.\n\nTo mine eyes the dim-worn dew\n\nBeams, a gem of Orient worth,\n\nStanding from the parchment forth,\n\nDiamond of a sapphire blue,\n\nSteadfast, lustreful and deep!\n\nTear that fell unhoped, unsought,\n\nOn a song my soul once wrought,\n\nFrom an eye unused to weep.\n\nSPRING'S FIRST SMILE\n\nWhile up and down the earth men pant and plod,\n\nMarch, laughing at the showers and days unsteady,\n\nAnd whispering secret orders to the sod,\n\nFor Spring makes ready.\n\nAnd slyly when the world is sleeping yet,\n\nHe smooths out collars for the Easter daisies,\n\nAnd fashions golden buttercups to set\n\nIn woodland mazes.\n\nCoif-maker fine, he worketh well his plan.\n\nOrchard and vineyard for his touch are prouder.\n\nFrom a white swan he hath a down to fan\n\nThe trees with powder.\n\nWhile Nature still upon her couch doth lean,\n\nStealthily hies he to the garden closes,\n\nAnd laces in their bodices of green\n\nPale buds of roses.\n\nComposing his solfeggios in the shade,\n\nHe whistles them to blackbirds as he treadeth,\n\nAnd violets in the wood, and in the glade\n\nSnowdrops, he spreadeth.\n\nWhere for the restless stag the fountain wells,\n\nHis hidden hand glides soft amid the cresses,\n\nAnd scatters lily-of-the-valley bells,\n\nIn silver dresses.\n\nHe sinks the sweet, vermilion strawberries\n\nDeep in the grasses for thy roving fingers,\n\nAnd garlands leaflets for thy forehead's ease,\n\nWhen sunshine lingers.\n\nWhen, labour done, he must away, turns he\n\nOn April's threshold from his fair creating,\n\nAnd calleth unto Spring: \"Come, Springfor see,\n\nThe woods are waiting!\"\n\nCONTRALTO\n\nThere lies within a great museum's hall,\n\nUpon a snowy bed of carven stone,\n\nA statue ever strange and mystical,\n\nWith some fair fascination all its own.\n\nAnd is it youth or is it maiden sweet,\n\nA goddess or a god come down to sway?\n\nLove fearful, hesitating, turns his feet,\n\nNor any word's avowal will betray.\n\nSideways it lieth, with averted face,\n\nStretching its lovely limbs, half mischievous,\n\nUnto the curious crowd, an idle grace\n\nLighting its marble form luxurious.\n\nFor fashioning of its evil beauty brought\n\nThe sexes twain each one its magic dower.\n\nMan whispers \"Aphrodite!\" in his thought,\n\nAnd woman \"Eros!\" wondering at its power.\n\nUncertain sex and certain grace, that seem\n\nTo melt forever in a fountain's kiss,\n\nWaters that whelm the body as they gleam\n\nAnd merge, and it is one with Salmacis.\n\nArdent chimera, effort venturesome\n\nOf Art and Pleasurefigure fanciful!\n\nInto thy presence with delight I come,\n\nLoving thy beauty strange and multiple.\n\nThough I may never close to thee draw nigh,\n\nHow often have my glances pierced the taut,\n\nStraight fold of thine austerest drapery,\n\nFast at the end about thine ankle caught!\n\nO dream of poet passing every bound!\n\nMy thought hath built a fancy of thy form,\n\nTill it is molten into silver sound,\n\nAnd boy and girl are one in cadence warm.\n\nO tone divine, O richest tone of earth,\n\nThe beautiful, bright statue's counterpart!\n\nContralto, thou fantastical of birth,\n\nThe voice's own Hermaphrodite thou art!\n\nThou art the plaintive dove, the linnet rare,\n\nPerched on one rose tree, mellow in one note.\n\nThou art fair Juliet and Romeo fair,\n\nSinging across the night with one warm throat.\n\nThou art the young wife of the castellan,\n\nChaffing an amorous page below her bower,\n\nUpon her balcony the lady wan,\n\nThe lover at the base of her high tower.\n\nThou art the yellow butterfly that swings,\n\nPursuing soft a butterfly of snow,\n\nIn spiral flights and subtle traversings,\n\nOne winging high, the other winging low;\n\nThe angel flitting up and down the gold\n\nOf the bright stair's aerial extent,\n\nThe bell in whose alloy of mighty mould\n\nArc voice of bronze and voice of silver blent\n\nYea, melody and harmony art thou,\n\nSong with its true accompaniment, and grace\n\nMatched unto force,the woman plighting vow\n\nTo her Belovèd with a close embrace;\n\nOr thou art Cinderella doomed to spend\n\nHer night before the embers of the fire,\n\nDeep in a conversation with her friend,\n\nThe cricket, as the latter hours expire;\n\nOr Arsaces, the great and valorous,\n\nWaging his righteous battle for a realm,\n\nOr Tancred with his breastplate luminous,\n\nCuirassed and splendid with his sword and helm;\n\nOr Desdemona with her willow song,\n\nZerlina laughing at Mazetto, or\n\nMalcolm, his plaid upon his shoulder strong.\n\nThee, O thou dear Contralto, I adore!\n\nFor these thou art, thou dearest charm of each,\n\nO fair Contralto, double-throated dove!\n\nThe Kaled of a Lara, for thy speech,\n\nThou mightest, like the lost Gulnare, prove,\n\nIn whose heart-stirring, passionate caress\n\nIn one wild, tremulous note there blend and mount\n\nA woman's sigh of plaintive tenderness,\n\nAnd virile accents from a firmer fount.\n\nEYES OF BLUE\n\nA woman, mystic, sweet,\n\nWhose beauty draws my soul,\n\nStands silent where the fleet\n\nAnd singing waters roll.\n\nHer eyes, the mirrored note\n\nOf heaven, merge heaven's blue\n\nBestarred of lights remote,\n\nWith the sea's glaucous hue.\n\nWithin their languor set,\n\nSmiles sadness infinite.\n\nTears make the sparkles wet,\n\nAnd tender grows the light.\n\nLike sea-gulls from aloft\n\nThat graze the ocean free,\n\nHer lashes flutter soft\n\nUpon an azure sea.\n\nAs slumbering treasures drowned\n\nSend shimmers lightly up,\n\nGleams through the tide profound\n\nThe King of Thule's cup.\n\nAthwart the weedy swirl\n\nBrilliant, the waves upon,\n\nShine Cleopatra's pearl,\n\nAnd ring of Solomon.\n\nThe crown to ocean cast,\n\nThat Schiller showed to us,\n\nStill under sea caught fast,\n\nBeams clear and luminous.\n\nA magic in that gaze\n\nDraws me, mad venturer!\n\nThus mermaid's magic ways\n\nDrew Harold Haarfager.\n\nAnd all my soul unquelled\n\nAdown the gulf betrayed\n\nDives, to the quest impelled\n\nOf some elusive shade.\n\nThe siren fitfully\n\nDisplays her body's gleam,\n\nHer breast and arms that ply\n\nThrough waves of amorous dream.\n\nThe water heaves and falls,\n\nLike breasts with passion's breath.\n\nThe breeze insistent calls\n\nTo me, and murmureth:\n\n\"Come to my pearly bed!\n\nMy ocean arms shall slip\n\nAbout thee: salt shall spread\n\nTo honey on thy lip!\n\nOh, let the billows link\n\nAbove us! Thou shalt, warm,\n\nFrom cup of kisses drink\n\nOblivion of the storm!\"\n\nThus sighs the glance that sweeps\n\nFrom out those sea-blue gates,\n\nTill heart down treacherous deeps\n\nThe hymen consummates.\n\nTHE TOREADOR'S SERENADE\n\nRONDALLA\n\nChild with airs imperial,\n\nDove with falcon's eyes for me\n\nWhom thou hatest,come I shall\n\nUnderneath thy balcony!\n\nThere, my foot upon the stone,\n\nI shall twang my chords with grace,\n\nTill thy window-pane hath shone\n\nWith thy lamplight and thy face.\n\nLet no lad with his guitar\n\nStrum adown the bordering ways.\n\nMine the road to watch and bar,\n\nMine alone to sing thy praise.\n\nLet the first my courage brave.\n\nHe shall lose his ears, egad!\n\nWho shall howl his love and rave\n\nIn a couplet good or bad.\n\nRestless doth my dagger lie.\n\nCome!

and with my dagger's point\n\nLet me write upon thy brow.\n\nLet them come, alone, in mass:\n\nFirm of foot I bide my place.\n\nFor thy glory, as they pass,\n\nWould I slit each paltry face.\n\nO'er the gutter ere thy clear,\n\nSnowy feet shall be defiled,\n\nBy the Rood! a bridge I'll rear\n\nWith the bones of gallants wild.\n\nI would slay, thy love to wear,\n\nAny foe, yea, even proud\n\nSatan's very self to dare,\n\nSo thy sheets became my shroud.\n\nSightless window, deafened door!\n\nWilt thou never heed my sounds?\n\nLike a wounded bull I roar,\n\nMaddening the baying hounds.\n\nDrive at least a poor nail then,\n\nWhere my heart may hang inert.\n\nFor I want it not again,\n\nWith its madness and its hurt!\n\nNOSTALGIA OF THE OBELISKS\n\nTHE OBELISK IN PARIS\n\nDistant from my native land,\n\nEver dull with ennui's pain,\n\nLonely monolith I stand,\n\nIn the snow and frost and rain.\n\nAnd my shaft, once burnt to red\n\nIn a flaming heaven's glare,\n\nTaketh on a pallor dead\n\nIn this never azure air.\n\nOh, to stand again before\n\nLuxor's pylons, and the dear,\n\nGrim Colossi!be once more\n\nMy vermilion brother near!\n\nOh, to pierce the changeless blue,\n\nWhere of old my peak upwon,\n\nWith my shadow sharp and true\n\nTrace the footsteps of the sun!\n\nOnce, O Rameses!

O tatters light,\n\nStarred with a cross! Heroic things\n\nOf ridicule, ye gleam more bright,\n\nMore beautiful than robes of kings!\n\nLimp feathers fluttering adorn\n\nThe tawny colbacks worn and grim.\n\nThe bullet and the moth have torn\n\nAnd riddled well the dolmans dim.\n\nTheir leathern breeches loosely hang\n\nIn furrows on their lank thigh-bones,\n\nTheir rusty sabres drag and clang,\n\nAs heavily they scrape the stones.\n\nOr some round belly firm and fat,\n\nSqueezed tight in tether labour-donned,\n\nMakes mirth and jest to chuckle at\n\nOld hero quaint and cheveroned!\n\nBut do not mock and jeer, my lad.\n\nSalute him, rather, and, believe,\n\nAchilles he, of Iliad\n\nThat Homer's self could not conceive.\n\nRespect these men with battle signs\n\nThat twenty skies have painted brown;\n\nTheir scars that lengthen out the lines\n\nOf wrinkles age has written down;\n\nTheir skin whose colour deep and dun,\n\nBared to the fronts of many foes,\n\nTells us of Egypt's burning sun;\n\nTheir locks that tell of Russia's snows.\n\nAnd if they shake, no longer strong?\n\nAh! Beresina's wind was cold.\n\nAnd if they limp? The way was long,\n\nFrom Cairo unto Vilna told.\n\nIf they be stiff? They'd but a flag\n\nFor sheet to hold their bodies warm.\n\nAnd if a sleeve be loose, poor rag?\n\n'T is that a bullet tore an arm.\n\nMock not these veteran shapes bizarre,\n\nAt whom the urchin laughs and gapes.\n\nThey were the day, of which we are\n\nThe evening, and the night, perhaps,\n\nRemembering if we forget\n\nRed lancer, grenadier in blue,\n\nWith faces to the Column set,\n\nAs to their only altar true.\n\nThere, proud of pain each scar denotes,\n\nAnd of long miseries gone by,\n\nThey feel beneath their shabby coats\n\nThe heart of France beat mightily.\n\nAnd so our smiles are steeped in tears,\n\nSeeing this holy carnival,\n\nThis picture wan that reappears,\n\nLike morning after midnight's ball.\n\nAnd, cleaving heaven its own to claim,\n\nWide the Grand Army's eagle spreads\n\nIts golden wings, like glory's flame,\n\nAbove their dear and hallowed heads.\n\nSEA-GLOOM\n\nThe sea-gulls restless gleam and glance,\n\nThe mad white coursers cleave the length\n\nOf ocean as they rear and prance\n\nAnd toss their manes in stormy strength.\n\nThe day is ending. Raindrops choke\n\nThe sunset furnaces. The gloom\n\nBrings the great steamboat spitting smoke,\n\nAnd beating down its long black plume.\n\nAnd I, more wan than heaven wide,\n\nFor land of soot and fog am bound,\n\nFor land of smoke and suicide\n\nAnd right good weather have I found!\n\nHow eagerly I now would pierce\n\nThe gulf that groweth wild and hoar!\n\nThe vessel rocks. The waves are fierce.\n\nThe salt wind freshens more and more.\n\nAh! bitter is my soul's unrest.\n\nThe very ocean sighing heaves\n\nIn pity its unhopeful breast,\n\nLike some good friend that knows and grieves.\n\nLet belost love's despair supreme!\n\nLet beillusions fair that rose\n\nAnd fell from pedestals of dream!\n\nOne leap! The dark wet ridges close.\n\nAway! ye sufferings gone by,\n\nThat evermore returning brood,\n\nAnd press the wounds that sleeping lie,\n\nTo make them weep afresh their blood.\n\nAway! regret, whose crimson heart\n\nHath seven swords. Yea, One, maybe,\n\nDoth know the anguish and the smart\n\nMother of Seven Sorrows, She!\n\nEach ghostly grief sinks down the vast,\n\nAnd struggles with the waves that throb\n\nTo close about it, and at last\n\nDrown it forever with a sob.\n\nSoul's ballast, treasures of life's hand,\n\nSink! and we'll wreck together down.\n\nPale on the pillow of the sand\n\nI'll rest me well at evening brown.\n\nBut, now, a woman, as I gaze,\n\nSits in the bridge's darker nook,\n\nA woman, who doth sweetly raise\n\nHer eyes to mine in one long look.\n\n'T is Sympathy with outstretched arms,\n\nWho smileth to me through the gray\n\nOf dusk with all her thousand charms.\n\nHail, azure eyes! Green sea, away!\n\nThe sea-gulls restless gleam and glance.\n\nThe mad white coursers cleave the length\n\nOf Ocean as they rear and prance\n\nAnd toss their manes in stormy strength.\n\nTO A ROSE-COLOURED GOWN\n\nHow I love you in the robes\n\nThat disrobe so well your charms!\n\nYour dear breasts, twin ivory globes,\n\nAnd your bare sweet pagan arms.\n\nFrail as frailest wing of bee,\n\nFresher than the heart of rose,\n\nAll the fabric delicate, free,\n\nRound your body gleams and glows,\n\nTill from skin to silken thread,\n\nSilver shivers lightly win,\n\nAnd the rosy gown have shed\n\nRoses on the creamy skin.\n\nWhence have you the mystic thing,\n\nMade of very flesh of you,\n\nLiving mesh to mix and cling\n\nWith your glorious body's hue?\n\nDid you take it from the rud\n\nOf the dawn? From Venus' shell?\n\nFrom a breast-flower nigh to bud?\n\nFrom a rose about to swell?\n\nDoth the texture have its dye\n\nFrom some blushing bashfulness?\n\nNoyour portraits do not lie\n\nBeauty beauty's form shall guess!\n\nDown you cast your garment fair,\n\nArt-dreamed, sweet Reality,\n\nLike Borghese's princess, rare\n\nFor Canova's mastery!\n\nAh! the folds are lips of fire\n\nSweeping round your lovely form\n\nIn a folly of desire,\n\nWith a weft of kisses warm!\n\nTHE WORLD'S MALICIOUS\n\nAh, little one, the world's malicious!\n\nWith mocking smiles thy beauty greeting.\n\nIt says that in thy breast capricious\n\nA watch, and not a heart, is beating.\n\nYet like the sea thy breast is swelling\n\nWith all the wild, tumultuous power\n\nA tide of blood sends pulsing, welling,\n\nBeneath thy flesh in life's young hour.\n\nAh, little one, the world is spiteful!\n\nIt says thy vivid eyes are fooling,\n\nAnd that they have their charm delightful\n\nFrom faithful, diplomatic schooling.\n\nYet on thy lashes' shifting curtain\n\nAn iridescent tear-drop trembles,\n\nLike dew unbidden and uncertain,\n\nThat no well-water's gleam resembles.\n\nAh, little one, the world reviles thee!\n\nIt says thou hast no spirit's favour,\n\nThat verse, which seemingly beguiles thee,\n\nHath unto thee a Sanskrit savour.\n\nYet to thy crimson lips inviting,\n\nIntelligence's bee of laughter,\n\nAt every flash of wit alighting,\n\nAllures and gleams, and lingers after.\n\nAh, little one, I know the trouble!\n\nThou lovest me. The world, it guesses.\n\nLeave me, and hear its praises bubble:\n\n\"What heart, what spirit, she possesses!\"\n\nINES DE LAS SIERRAS\n\nTO PETRA CAMARA\n\nIn Spain, as Nodier's pen has told,\n\nThree officers in night's mid hours\n\nCame on a castle dark and old,\n\nWith sunken eaves and mouldering towers,\n\nA true Anne Radcliffe type it was,\n\nWith ruined halls and crumbling rooms\n\nAnd windows graven by the claws\n\nOf Goya's bats that ranged the glooms.\n\nNow while they feasted, gazed upon\n\nBy ancient portraits standing guard\n\nIn their ancestral frames, anon\n\nA sudden cry rang thitherward.\n\nForth from a distant corridor\n\nThat many a moonbeam's pallid hue\n\nFretted fantastically o'er,\n\nA wondrous phantom sped in view.\n\nWith bodice high and hair comb-tipped,\n\nA woman, running, dancing, hied.\n\nAdown the dappled gloom she dipped,\n\nAn iridescent form descried.\n\nA languid, dead, voluptuous mood\n\nFilled every act's abandon brief,\n\nTill at the door she stopped, and stood\n\nSinister, lovely past belief.\n\nHer raiment crumpled in the tomb\n\nShowed here and there a spangle's foil.\n\nAt every start a faded bloom\n\nDropped petals in her hair's black coil.\n\nA dull scar crossed her bloodless throat,\n\nAs of a knife. Like rattle chill\n\nOf teeth, her castanets she smote\n\nFull in their faces awed and still.\n\nAh, poor bacchante, sad of grace!\n\nSo wild the sweetness of her spell,\n\nThe curvèd lips in her white face\n\nHad lured a saint from heaven to hell!\n\nLike darkling birds her eyelashes\n\nUpon her cheek lay fluttering light.\n\nHer kirtle's swinging cadences\n\nDisplayed her limbs of lustrous white.\n\nShe bowed amid a mist of gyres,\n\nAnd with her hand, as dancers may,\n\nLike flowers she gathered up desires,\n\nAnd grouped them in a bright bouquet.\n\nWas it a wraith or woman seen,\n\nA thing of dreams, or blood and flesh,\n\nThe flame that burst from out the sheen\n\nOf beauty's undulating mesh?\n\nIt was a phantom of the past,\n\nIt was the Spain of olden keep,\n\nWho, at the sound of cheer at last,\n\nUpbounded from her icy sleep,\n\nIn one bolero mad, supreme,\n\nRough-resurrected, powerful,\n\nShowing beneath her kirtle's gleam\n\nThe ribbon wrested from the bull.\n\nAbout her throat the scar of red\n\nThe deathblow was, dealt silently\n\nUnto a generation dead\n\nBy every new-born century.\n\nI saw this self-same phantom fleet,\n\nAll Paris ringing with her praise,\n\nWhen soft, diaphanous, mystic, sweet,\n\nLa Petra Camara held its gaze,\n\nClosing her eyes with languor rare,\n\nImpassive, passionate of art,\n\nAnd, like the murdered Ines fair,\n\nDancing, a dagger in her heart.\n\nODELET\n\nAFTER ANACREON\n\nPoet of her face divine,\n\nCurb this over-zeal of thine!\n\nDoves wing frighted from the ground\n\nAt a step's too sudden sound,\n\nAnd her passion is a dove,\n\nFrighted by too bold a love.\n\nMute as marble Hermes wait\n\nBy the blooming hawthorn-gate.\n\nThou shalt see her wings expand,\n\nShe shall flutter to thy hand.\n\nOn thy forehead thou shalt know\n\nSomething like a breath of snow,\n\nOr of pinions pure that beat\n\nIn a whirl of whiteness sweet.\n\nAnd the dove, grown venturesome,\n\nShall upon thy shoulder come,\n\nAnd its rosy beak shall sip\n\nFrom the nectar of thy lip.\n\nSMOKE\n\nBeneath yon tree sits humble\n\nA squalid, hunchbacked house,\n\nWith roof precipitous,\n\nAnd mossy walls that crumble.\n\nBolted and barred the shanty.\n\nBut from its must and mould,\n\nLike breath of lips in cold,\n\nComes respiration scanty.\n\nA vapour upward welling,\n\nA slender, silver streak,\n\nTo God bears tidings meek\n\nOf the soul in the little dwelling.\n\nAPOLLONIA\n\nFair Apollonia, name august,\n\nGreek echo of the sacred vale,\n\nGreat name whose harmonies robust\n\nThee as Apollo's sister hail!\n\nStruck with the plectrum on the lyre,\n\nAnd in melodious beauty sung,\n\nBrighter than love's and glory's fire,\n\nIt resonant rings upon the tongue.\n\nAt such a classic sound as this,\n\nThe elves plunge down their German lake.\n\nAlone the Delphian worthy is\n\nSo lustreful a name to take,\n\nPythia! when in her flowing dress\n\nShe mounts her place with feet unshod,\n\nAnd, priestess white and prophetess,\n\nWistful awaits the tardy god.\n\nTHE BLIND MAN\n\nA blind man walks without the gate,\n\nWild-staring as an owl by day,\n\nFumbling his flute betimes and late,\n\nAlong the way.\n\nHe pipeth, weary wretch and worn,\n\nA roundel shrill and obsolete.\n\nThe spectre of a dog forlorn\n\nAttends his feet.\n\nFor him the days go lustreless.\n\nInvisible life with beat and roar\n\nHe heareth like a torrent press\n\nAround, before.\n\nWhat strange chimeras haunt his head And on his mind's bedarkened space,\n\nWhat characters unheard, unread,\n\nDoth fancy trace?\n\nThus down Venetian leads of doom,\n\nWan prisoners ensepulchred\n\nIn palpable, undying gloom\n\nHave graven their word.\n\nAnd yet perchance when life's last spark\n\nDeath speeds unto eternal night,\n\nThe tomb-bred soul, within the dark,\n\nShall see the light.\n\nSONG\n\nIn April earth is white and rose\n\nLike youth and love, now tendering\n\nHer smiles, now fearful to disclose\n\nHer virgin heart unto the Spring.\n\nIn June, a little pale and worn,\n\nAnd full at heart of vague desire,\n\nShe hideth in the yellow corn,\n\nWith sunburned Summer to respire.\n\nIn August, wild Bacchante, she\n\nHer bosom bares to Autumn shapes,\n\nAnd on the tiger-skin flung free,\n\nDraws forth the purple blood of grapes.\n\nAnd in December, shrivelled, old,\n\nBepowdered white from foot to head,\n\nIn dream she wakens Winter cold,\n\nThat sleeps beside her in her bed.\n\nWINTER FANTASIES\n\nI\n\nRed of nose and white of face,\n\nBent his desk of ice before,\n\nWinter doth his theme retrace\n\nIn the season's quatuor,\n\nBeating measure and the ground\n\nWith a frozen foot for us,\n\nSinging with uncertain sound\n\nOlden tunes and tremulous.\n\nAnd as Haendel's wig sublime\n\nTrembling shook its powder, oft\n\nFlutter as he taps his time\n\nSnow-flakes in a flurry soft.\n\nII\n\nIn the Tuileries fount the swan\n\nMeets the ice, and all the trees,\n\nAs in land of fairies wan,\n\nArc bedecked with filigrees.\n\nFlowers of frost in vases low\n\nStand unquickened and unstirred,\n\nAnd we trace upon the snow\n\nStarred footsteps of a bird.\n\nWhere with lightest raiment spanned,\n\nVenus was with Phocion met,\n\nNow has Winter's hoary hand\n\nClodion's \"Chilly Maiden\" set.\n\nIII\n\nWomen pass in ermine dress,\n\nSable, too, and miniver,\n\nAnd the shivering goddesses\n\nHaste to don the fashion's fur.\n\nVenus of the Brine comes forth,\n\nIn her hooded mantle's fluff.\n\nFlora, blown by breezes North,\n\nHides her fingers in her muff.\n\nAnd the shepherdesses round\n\nOf Coustou and Coysevox,\n\nFinding scarves too light have wound\n\nFurs about their throats of snow.\n\nIV\n\nHeavy doth the North bedrape\n\nParis mode from foot to top,\n\nAs o'er fair Athenian shape\n\nScythian should a bearskin drop.\n\nOver winter's garments meet,\n\nEverywhere we see the fur,\n\nFlung with Russian pomp, and sweet\n\nWith the fragrant vetiver.\n\nPleasure's laughing glances feast\n\nFar amid the statues, where\n\nFrom the bristles of a beast\n\nBursts a Venus torso fair!\n\nIf you venture hitherward,\n\nWith a tender veil to cheat\n\nGlances over-daring, guard\n\nWell your Andalusian feet!\n\nSnow shall fashion like a frame\n\nOn your foot's impression rare,\n\nSigning with each step your name\n\nOn the carpet soft and vair.\n\nThus were surly master led\n\nTo the hidden trysting-place,\n\nWhere his Psyche, faintly red,\n\nWere beheld in Love's embrace.\n\nTHE BROOK\n\nNear a great water's waste\n\nA brook mid rock and spar\n\nCame bubbling up in haste,\n\nAs though to travel far.\n\nIt sang: \"What joy to rise!\n\n'T was dismal under ground.\n\nI mirror now the skies.\n\nMy banks with green abound.\n\n\"Forget-me-notshow fair!\n\nBeseech me from the grass;\n\nWings frolic in the air,\n\nAnd graze me as they pass.\n\n\"I yet shall bewho knows?\n\nA river winding down,\n\nAnd greeting as it flows\n\nValley and cliff and town.\n\n\"I'll broider with my spray\n\nStone bridge and granite quay,\n\nAnd bear great ships away\n\nUnto the long wide sea.\"\n\nSo planned it, babbling by,\n\nAs water boiling fast\n\nWithin a basin high,\n\nTo top its brim at last.\n\nCradle by tomb is crossed.\n\nGiants are early dead.\n\nScarce born, the brook was lost\n\nWithin a lake's deep bed.\n\nTOMBS AND FUNERAL PYRES\n\nNo grim cadaver set its flaw\n\nIn happy days of pagan art,\n\nAnd man, content with what he saw,\n\nStripped not the veil from beauty's heart.\n\nNo form once loved that buried lay,\n\nA hideous spectre to appal,\n\nDropped bit by bit its flesh away,\n\nAs one by one our garments fall;\n\nOr, when the days had drifted by\n\nAnd sundered shrank the vaulted stones,\n\nShowed naked to the daring eye\n\nA motley heap of rattling bones.\n\nBut, rescued from the funeral pyre,\n\nLife's ashen, light residuum\n\nLay soft, and, spent the cleansing fire,\n\nThe urn held sweet the body's sum,\n\nThe sum of all that earth may claim\n\nOf the soul's butterfly, soul passed,\n\nAll that is left of spended flame\n\nUpon the tripod at the last.\n\nBetween acanthus leaves and flowers\n\nIn the white marble gaily went\n\nLoves and bacchantes all the hours,\n\nDancing about the monument.\n\nAt most, a little Genius wild\n\nTrampled a flame out in the gloom,\n\nAnd art's harmonious flowering smiled\n\nUpon the sadness of the tomb.\n\nThe tomb was then a pleasant place.\n\nAs bed of child that slumbereth,\n\nWith many a fair and laughing grace\n\nThe joy of life surrounded death.\n\nThen death concealed its visage gaunt,\n\nWhose sockets deep, and sunken nose,\n\nAnd railing mouth our spirits haunt,\n\nPast any dream that horror shows.\n\nThe monster in flesh raiment clad\n\nHid deep its spectral form uncouth,\n\nAnd virgin glances, beauty-glad,\n\nSped frankly to the naked youth.\n\nTwas only at Trimalchio's board\n\nA little skeleton made sign,\n\nAn ivory plaything unabhorred,\n\nTo bid the feasters to the wine.\n\nGods, whom Art ever must avow,\n\nRuled the marmoreal sky's demesne.\n\nOlympus yields to Calvary, now;\n\nJupiter to the Nazarene!\n\nVoices are calling, \"Pan is dead!\"\n\nDusk deepeneth within, without.\n\nOn the black sheet of sorrow spread,\n\nThe whitened skeleton gleams out.\n\nIt glideth to the headstone bare,\n\nAnd signs it with a paraph wild,\n\nAnd hangs a wreath of bones to glare\n\nUpon the charnel death-defiled.\n\nIt lifts the coffin-lid and quaffs\n\nThe musty air, and peers within,\n\nDisplays a ring of ribs, and laughs\n\nForever with its awful grin.\n\nIt urges unto Death's fleet dance\n\nThe Emperor, the Pope, the King,\n\nAnd makes the pallid steed to prance,\n\nAnd low the doughty warrior fling;\n\nBehind the courtesan steals up,\n\nAnd makes wry faces in her glass;\n\nDrinks from the sick man's trembling cup;\n\nDelves in the miser's golden mass.\n\nAbove the team it whirls the thong,\n\nWith bone for goad to hurry it,\n\nFollows the plowman's way along,\n\nAnd guides the furrows to a pit.\n\nIt comes, the uninvited guest,\n\nAnd lurks beneath the banquet chair,\n\nUnseen from the pale bride to wrest\n\nHer little silken garter fair.\n\nThe number swells: the young give hand\n\nUnto the old, and none may flee.\n\nThe irresistible saraband\n\nCompelleth all humanity.\n\nForth speeds the tall, ungainly fright,\n\nPlaying the rebeck, dancing mad,\n\nAgainst the dark a frame of white,\n\nAs Holbein drew ithorror-sad;\n\nOr if the times be frivolous,\n\nTrusses the shroud about its hips:\n\nThen like a Cupid mischievous,\n\nAcross the ballet-room it skips,\n\nAnd unto carven tombs it flies,\n\nWhere marchionesses rest demure,\n\nWeary of love, in exquisite guise,\n\nIn chapels dim and pompadour.\n\nBut hide thy hideous form at last,\n\nWorm-eaten actor! Long enough\n\nIn death's wan melodrama cast,\n\nThou'st played thy part without rebuff.\n\nCome back, come back, O ancient Art!\n\nAnd cover with thy marble's gleam\n\nThis Gothic skeleton! Each part\n\nConsume, ye flames of fire supreme!\n\nIf man be then a creature made\n\nIn God's own image, to aspire,\n\nWhen shattered must the image fade,\n\nLet the lone fragments feed the fire!\n\nImmortal form! Rise thou in flame\n\nAgain to beauty's fount of bloom\n\nLet not thy clay endure the shame,\n\nThe degradation of the tomb!\n\nBJORN'S BANQUET\n\nBjorn, odd and lonely cenobite,\n\nHigh on a barren rock's plateau,\n\nFar out of time's and the world's sight,\n\nDwells in a castle none may know.\n\nNo modern thought may violate\n\nHis darkened and secluded hall.\n\nBjorn bolts with care his postern-gate,\n\nAnd barricades his castle wall.\n\nWhen others wait the rising sun,\n\nHe from his mouldering parapet\n\nStill contemplates the valley dun,\n\nWhere he beheld the red sun set.\n\nSecurely doth the past enlock\n\nHis retrospective spirit lone.\n\nThe pendulum within his clock\n\nWas broken centuries agone.\n\nWaking the echoes wanders he\n\nBeneath his feudal arches drear,\n\nHis ringing footsteps seemingly\n\nFollowed by other footsteps clear.\n\nNor priests nor friends with him make bold,\n\nNor burghers plain nor gentlemen;\n\nBut his ancestral portraits hold\n\nA parley with him now and then.\n\nAnd of a midnight, sparing him\n\nThe ennui of a lonely cup,\n\nBjorn, harbouring a gloomy whim,\n\nInvites his ancestors to sup.\n\nForth stepping at the hour's grim stroke,\n\nCome phantoms armed from foot to head.\n\nBjorn, quaking, to the solemn folk\n\nProffers with state the goblet red.\n\nTo seat itself each panoply\n\nWith joints that grumble in revolt\n\nMaketh an angle with its knee,\n\nThat creaketh like a rusty bolt;\n\nTill all at once the suit of mail,\n\nRude coffin of an absent bulk,\n\nCleaving the silence with a wail,\n\nFalls in its chair, a clanking hulk.\n\nLandgraves and burgraves, spare and stout,\n\nCome down from heaven or up from hell,\n\nThe iron guests of many a bout,\n\nArc bound within the midnight spell.\n\nTheir blow-indented helmets bear\n\nHeraldic beasts that bay and grin,\n\nAthwart the shades the red lights glare\n\nOn crest and ancient lambrequin.\n\nEach empty, open casque now seems\n\nLike to the helms of heraldries,\n\nSave for two strange and livid gleams\n\nThat issue forth in threatening wise.\n\nSeated is each old combatant\n\nIn the vast hall, at Bjorn's behest,\n\nAnd the uncertain shadows grant\n\nA swarthy page to every guest.\n\nThe liquors in the candle-shine\n\nTake on suspicious purples. All\n\nThe viands in their gravy's wine\n\nGrow lurid and fantastical.\n\nSometimes a breastplate glitters bright,\n\nA morion speeds its flashes wroth,\n\nA rondelle from a hand of might\n\nDrops heavily upon the cloth.\n\nHeard are the softly flapping wings\n\nOf unseen bats. The shimmer flicks\n\nUpon the carven panellings\n\nThe banners of the heretics.\n\nThe stiffly bended gauntlets play\n\nIn the dull glow incarnadine,\n\nAnd, creaking, to the helmets gray\n\nPour bumpers full of Rhenish wine;\n\nOr with their daggers keen of blade\n\nCarve boars upon the plates of gold.\n\nThe corridor's uncanny shade\n\nHath clamours vague and manifold.\n\nThe orgy waxes riotsome\n\nOne could not hear God's voice for it\n\nFor when a phantom sups from home,\n\nWhat wrong if he carouse a bit?\n\nNow every ghostly care they drown\n\nWith jokes and jeers and loud guffaws.\n\nA wine-cascade is running down\n\nEach rusty helmet's iron jaws.\n\nThe full and rounded hauberks bulge,\n\nAnd to the neck the river mounts.\n\nTheir eyes with liquid fire effulge.\n\nThey're howling drunk, these valiant counts!\n\nOne through the salad idly wields\n\nA foot; another scolds the sick.\n\nSome like the lions on their shields\n\nWith gaping mouths the fancy trick.\n\nIn voice still hoarse from silence long\n\nIn the tomb's dampness and restraint,\n\nMax playfully intones a song\n\nOf thirteen hundred, crude and quaint.\n\nAlbrecht, of quarrelsome repute,\n\nStirs right and left a war intense,\n\nAnd drubs about with fist and foot,\n\nAs once he drubbed the Saracens.\n\nAnd heated Fritz his helmet doffs,\n\nNot deeming he's a headless trunk.\n\nThen down pell-mell mid roars and scoffs\n\nTogether roll the phantoms drunk.\n\nAh! 'T is a hideous battle-ground,\n\nWhere pots and weapons bang and scud,\n\nWhere every dead man through some wound\n\nDoth vomit victuals up for blood.\n\nAnd Bjorn observes them, sad of eye,\n\nAnd haggard, while athwart the panes\n\nThe dawn comes creeping stealthily,\n\nWith blue, thin lights, and darkness wanes.\n\nThe prostrate mass of rusty brown\n\nPales like a torch in daylight's room,\n\nUntil the drunkest pours him down\n\nAt last the stirrup-cup of doom.\n\nThe cock crows loud. And with the day\n\nOnce more with haughty mien and bold,\n\nTheir revel-weary heads they lay\n\nUpon their marble pillows cold.\n\nTHE WATCH\n\nNow twice my watch have I taken,\n\nAnd twice as I've gazing sat,\n\nThe hand has pointed unshaken\n\nTo oneand it's long past that!\n\nThe clock's light cadences linger.\n\nThe sun-dial laughs from the lawn,\n\nAnd points with a long, gaunt finger\n\nThe path that its shade has drawn.\n\nA steeple ironically\n\nCalls the true time to me.\n\nThe belfry bell makes tally\n\nAnd taunts me with accents free.\n\nAh, dead is the wretch! I sought not,\n\nLast night, to my reverie sold,\n\nIts ruby circle! I thought not\n\nOf glimmering key of gold!\n\nNo longer I see with pleasure\n\nThe spring of the balance-wheel\n\nFlit hither and there at measure,\n\nLike a butterfly form of steel.\n\nWhen Hippogriff bears me, yearning,\n\nThrough skies of another sphere,\n\nMy soul-reft body goes turning\n\nWherever the steed may veer.\n\nEternity still is giving\n\nIts gaze to the lifeless face.\n\nTime seeketh the heart once living,\n\nHis ear at the old watch-case,\n\nThat heart whose regular motion\n\nWas followed within my breast\n\nBy wave-beats of life's full ocean!\n\nAh well! the watch is at rest.\n\nBut its brother is beating ever,\n\nSteadfast and sturdy kept\n\nBy One Who forgetteth never,\n\nWho wound it the while I slept.\n\nTHE MERMAIDS\n\nThere's a sketch you may discover\n\nBy an artist of degree\n\nRime and metre quarrel over\n\nThéophile Kniatowski.\n\nOn the snowy foam that fringes\n\nAll the mantle of the brine,\n\nRadiant with the sunlight's tinges,\n\nThree mermaidens softly shine.\n\nLike the drownèd lilies dancing\n\nTurn they, as the spiral wave\n\nBuoys their bodies hiding, glancing,\n\nAs they sink and rise and lave.\n\nIn their golden hair for dowers\n\nThey have twined with beauteous hands\n\nShells for diadems, and flowers\n\nFrom the deep wild under sands.\n\nOysters pour a pearly hoarding\n\nTheir enrapturing throats to gem,\n\nAnd the wave, its wealth according,\n\nTosses other pearls to them.\n\nBorne above the crest of ocean\n\nBy a Triton hand and strong,\n\nTwine they, beautiful of motion,\n\nUnder gleaming tresses long.\n\nAnd the crystal water under,\n\nDown the blue the glories pale\n\nOf each lovely form of wonder,\n\nTapered to a shimmering tail.\n\nAh! But who the scaly swimmers\n\nWould behold in modern day\n\nWhen a bust of ivory glimmers,\n\nCool from kisses of the spray?\n\nLook! Oh, mingled truth and fable!\n\nO'er the horizon steady plied,\n\nComes a vessel proud and stable,\n\nToward the mermaids terrified!\n\nTricoloured its flag is flaunted,\n\nAnd it vomits vapour red,\n\nAnd it beats the billows daunted,\n\nTill the nymphs dive low for dread.\n\nFearlessly they did beleaguer\n\nTriremes immemorial,\n\nAnd the dolphins arched and eager\n\nWaited for Arion's call.\n\nThis of old. But now the steamer\n\nVulcan hurtling Venus' charms,\n\nWould destroy the siren gleamer,\n\nWith her fair, nude tail and arms.\n\nFarewell myth! The boat that passes\n\nThinks to see on silver bar,\n\nWhere the widening billow glasses,\n\nPorpoises that plunge afar.\n\nTWO LOVE-LOCKS\n\nReviving languorous dreaming\n\nOf conquered, conquering eye,\n\nUpon thy forehead gleaming,\n\nTwo fairest love-locks lie.\n\nI see them softly nesting,\n\nOf wondrous, golden sheen,\n\nLike little wheels come resting\n\nFrom car of Mab the Queen;\n\nOr bows of Cupid ready\n\nTo let the arrows fly,\n\nBent circlewise and steady\n\nFor archer's mastery.\n\nOne heart have I of passion.\n\nYet two love-locks are thine!\n\nO brow of fickle fashion!\n\nWhose heart is caught with mine?\n\nTHE TEA-ROSE\n\nMost beautiful of all the roses\n\nIs this half-open bud, whose bare,\n\nUnpetalled heart a dream discloses\n\nOf carmine very faint and fair.\n\nI wonder, was it once a white rose,\n\nTill butterfly too ardent spoke\n\nA language soft, and in the light rose\n\nA shyer, warmer tint awoke?\n\nIts delicate fabric hath the colour\n\nOf lovely and velutinous skin.\n\nIts perfect freshness maketh duller\n\nEnvironing hues incarnadine.\n\nFor as some rare patrician features\n\nEclipse the brows of ruddier gleam,\n\nSo masquerade as rustic creatures\n\nGay sisters of this rose supreme.\n\nBut, dear one, if your hand caress it,\n\nAnd raise it for its sweet perfume,\n\nEre yet your velvet cheek shall press it,\n\n'T will fade before a fairer bloom.\n\nNo rose in all the world so tender,\n\nThat gloweth in the springtime fleet,\n\nBut shall its every charm surrender\n\nUnto your seventeen years, my sweet.\n\nA face hath more than petal's power:\n\nA pure heart's blood that blushing flows\n\nO'er youth's nobility, is flower\n\nHigh sovereign over every rose.\n\nCARMEN\n\nSlender is Carmen, of lissome guise,\n\nHer hair is black as the midnight's heart;\n\nDark circles are under her gypsy eyes,\n\nHer swarthy skin is the devil's art.\n\nThe women will mock at her form and face;\n\nBut the men will follow her all the day.\n\nToledo's Archbishop (now save His Grace!)\n\nTones his mass at her knees, they say.\n\nNestled in warmth of her amber neck\n\nLies a massive coil, till she fling it down\n\nTo be a raiment to frame and deck\n\nHer delicate body from foot to crown.\n\nThen out from her pallid face with power\n\nHer witching, terrible smiles compel.\n\nHer mouth is a mystical poison-flower\n\nThat hath drawn its crimson from hearts in hell.\n\nThe haughtiest beauty must yield her fame,\n\nWhen this strange vision shall dusk her sky.\n\nFor Carmen rules, and her glance's flame\n\nShall set the torch to satiety.\n\nWild, graceless Carmen!Though yet this be,\n\nSavour she hath of a world undreamt,\n\nOf a world of wonder, whose salt young sea\n\nProvoked a Venus to rise and tempt.\n\nWHAT THE SWALLOWS SAY\n\nAN AUTUMN SONG\n\nThe dry, brown leaves have dropped forlorn,\n\nAnd lie amid the golden grass.\n\nThe wind is fresh both eve and morn.\n\nBut where are summer days, alas!\n\nThe tardy flowers the autumn stayed\n\nFor latter treasures now unfold.\n\nThe dahlia dons its gay cockade,\n\nIts flaming cap the marigold.\n\nRain stirs the pool with pelt and shock.\n\nThe swallows to the roof repair,\n\nConfabulating as they flock\n\nAnd feel the winter in the air.\n\nBy hundreds gather they to vow\n\nTheir little yearnings and intents.\n\nSaith one: \"'T is fair in Athens now,\n\nUpon the sun-warm battlements!\n\n\"Thither I go to take my nap\n\nUpon the Parthenon high and free.\n\nMy cornice nest is in the gap\n\nA cannon-ball made there for me.\"\n\nAnd one: \"A ceiling meets my needs\n\nWithin a Smyrna coffee-house,\n\nWhere Hadjis tell their amber beads\n\nUpon the threshold luminous.\n\n\"I go and come above the folk,\n\nWhile their chibouques their clouds upfling.\n\nI skim along through silver smoke,\n\nAnd graze the turbans with my wing.\"\n\nAnother: \"There's a triglyph gray\n\nOn one of Baalbec's temples high.\n\n'T is there I go to brood all day\n\nAbove my little family.\"\n\nAnother calleth, \"My address\n\nIs settled: 'At the Knights of Rhodes.'\n\nIn a dark colonnade's recess\n\nI'll make the snuggest of abodes.\"\n\n\"Old age hath made me slow for flight,\"\n\nDeclares a fifth; \"I'll rest at even\n\nOn Malta's terraces of white,\n\nWhere blue sea melts to blue of heaven.\"\n\nA sixth: \"In Cairo is my home,\n\nUp in a minaret's retreat:\n\nA twig or two, a bit of loam\n\nMy winter lodgings are complete.\"\n\nA last: \"The Second Cataract\n\nShall mark my placethe nest of brown\n\nA granite king doth hold intact\n\nWithin the circle of his crown.\"\n\nAnd all together sing: \"What miles\n\nTo-morrow shall have stretched beneath\n\nOur fleeing swarm:remembered isles,\n\nSnow peaks, vast waters, lands of heath!\"\n\nWith calls and cries and beat of wings,\n\nGrown eager now and venturesome,\n\nThe swallows hold their twitterings,\n\nTo see the blight of winter come.\n\nAnd II understand them all,\n\nBecause the poet is a bird,\n\nOh!

Away,\n\nThou still-born masterpiece,aye,\n\nTill Monday I am my master.\n\nNo melodrama shall whiten\n\nMy labour with threadbare leaves.\n\nThe warp that my fancy weaves\n\nWith silken flowers shall brighten.\n\nBrief moment my spirit's warder,\n\nYe voices of soul that float,\n\nI'll hearken your sorrow's note,\n\nNor verses evoke to order.\n\nThen deep in my glass regaining\n\nThe health of a day gone by,\n\nOld visions for company\n\nThe bloom of my vintage draining,\n\nThe wine of my thought I'll measure,\n\nWine virgin of alien glow,\n\nGrapes trodden by life, that flow\n\nFrom my heart at my heart's own pleasure!\n\nTHE CASTLE OF REMEMBRANCE\n\nBefore my hearth with head low-bowed\n\nI dream, and strive to reach again,\n\nAcross the misty past's gray cloud,\n\nUnto Remembrance's domain,\n\nWhere tree and house and upland way\n\nAre blurred and blue like passing ghosts,\n\nAnd the eye, ponder though it may,\n\nConsults in vain the guiding-posts.\n\nNow gropingly to gain a sight\n\nOf all the buried world, I press\n\nThrough mystic marge of shade and light\n\nAnd limbo of forgetfulness.\n\nBut white, diaphanous Memory stands,\n\nWhere many roadways meet and spread,\n\nLike Ariadne, in my hands\n\nThrusting her little ball of thread.\n\nHenceforth the way is all secure.\n\nThe shrouded sun hath reappeared,\n\nAnd o'er the trees with vision sure\n\nI see the castle tower upreared.\n\nBeneath the boughs where day grows dark\n\nWith shower on shower of leaves down-poured\n\nThe dear old path through moss and bark\n\nStill lengthens far its narrow cord.\n\nBut creeping-plant and bramble-spray\n\nHave wrought a net to daunt me now.\n\nThe stubborn branch I force away\n\nSwings fiercely back to lash my brow.\n\nI come upon the house at last.\n\nNo window lit with lamp or face,\n\nNo breath of smoke from gables vast,\n\nTo touch with life the mouldering place!\n\nBridges are crumbling. Moats are still,\n\nAnd slimed with rank, green refuse-flowers,\n\nAnd tortuous waves of ivy fill\n\nThe crevices and choke the towers.\n\nThe portico in moonlight wanes.\n\nTime sculptures it to suit his whim.\n\nAnd with the wash of many rains\n\nMy coloured coat of arms is dim.\n\nThe door I open eagerly.\n\nThe ancient hinges creak and halt.\n\nA breath of dampness wafts to me\n\nThe musty odour of the vault.\n\nThe hairy nettle sharp of sting,\n\nThe coarse and broad-leafed burdock weed\n\nIn court-yard nooks are prospering,\n\nBy spreading hemlocks canopied.\n\nUpon two marble monsters near,\n\nThat guard the mossy steps of stone,\n\nThe shadow of a tree falls clear,\n\nThat in my absence has upgrown.\n\nSudden the lion sentinels raise\n\nTheir paws, aggressive and malign,\n\nAnd challenge me with their white gaze;\n\nBut soft I breathe the countersign.\n\nI pass. The old dog menaceth,\n\nBut falls back hushed, the shades amid.\n\nMy resonant footstep wakeneth\n\nCrouched echoes in their corners hid.\n\nThrough yellow panes of glass a ray\n\nOf dubious light creeps down the hall\n\nWhere ancient tapestries display\n\nApollo's fortunes from the wall.\n\nFair tree-bound Daphne still with grace\n\nStretches her tufted fingers green.\n\nBut in the amorous god's embrace\n\nShe fades, a formless phantom seen.\n\nI watch divine Apollo stand,\n\nHerdsman to acarus-riddled sheep,\n\nThe Muses Nine, a haggard band,\n\nUpon a faded Pindus weep;\n\nWhile Solitude in scanty gown\n\nTraces \"Desertion\" in the dust\n\nThat through the air she sifteth down\n\nUpon a marble stand august.\n\nAnd now, among forgotten things,\n\nI find, like sleepers manifold,\n\nPastels bedimmed, dark picturings,\n\nYoung beauties, and the friends of old.\n\nMy faltering fingers lift a crape,\n\nAnd lo, my love with look and lure!\n\nWith puffing skirts and prisoned shape!\n\nCidalise à la Pompadour!\n\nA tender, blossoming rose she feels\n\nAgainst her ribboned bodice pressed,\n\nWhose lace half hides and half reveals\n\nA snowy, azure-veinèd breast.\n\nWithin her eyes gleam sparkles lush,\n\nAs on the rime-kissed, deadened leaves.\n\nUpon her cheek a purple flush\n\nDeath's own cosmetic hue!deceives.\n\nShe startles as I come before,\n\nAnd fixeth soft on me her eyes,\n\nReproachfully forevermore,\n\nYet with a charm and witching wise.\n\nLife bore me from thee at its will,\n\nYet on my heart thy name is laid,\n\nThou dead delight, that lingereth still,\n\nBedizened for the masquerade!\n\nEnvious of Art, fair Nature wrought\n\nTo overpass Murillo's fame,\n\nFrom Andalusia here she brought\n\nThe face that lights the second frame.\n\nBy some poetical caprice,\n\nOur atmosphere of mist and cloud,\n\nWith rare exotic charm's increase\n\nThis other Petra Camara dowed.\n\nWarm orange tones are gilding yet\n\nHer lovely skin of roseate hue.\n\nHer eyelids fair have lashes jet\n\nThat beams of sunshine filter through.\n\nThere shimmers fine a pearly gleam\n\nBetween her scarlet lips elate;\n\nHer beauty flashes forth supreme\n\nA bright south summer pomegranate.\n\nLong to the sound of Spain's guitar,\n\nI told her praise 'mid song and glass.\n\nShe came alone one evenstar,\n\nAnd all my room Alhambra was.\n\nFarther I see a robust Fair,\n\nWith strong and gem-beladen arms.\n\nIn pearls of price and velvet rare\n\nAre set her ivory bosom's charms.\n\nHer ennui is a weary queen's,\n\nAn adulating court amid.\n\nSuperb, aloof, her hand she leans\n\nUpon a casket's jewelled lid.\n\nHer sensuous lips their crimes confess,\n\nAs crimson with the blood of hearts.\n\nWith brutal, mad voluptuousness\n\nHer conquering eye a challenge darts.\n\nHere dwells, in lieu of tender grace,\n\nVertiginous allure, whereof\n\nA cruel Venus ruled a race,\n\nPresiding o'er malignant love.\n\nUnnatural mother to her child,\n\nThis Venus all imperative!\n\nO thou, my bitter joy and wild,\n\nFarewell forever! I forgive!\n\nWithin its frame in shadow fine,\n\nThe misty glass that still endures\n\nReveals another face than mine,\n\nThe earliest of my portraitures.\n\nA retrospective ghost, with face\n\nOf vanished type, steps from the vast\n\nDim mirror of his biding-place\n\nIn tenebrous, forgotten past.\n\nGay in his doublet satin-rose,\n\nColoured in bold and vivid way,\n\nHe seems as if about to pose\n\nFor Deveria or Boulanger.\n\nTerror of glabrous commoner,\n\nHis flowing locks in royal guise,\n\nLike mane of lion, or sinister\n\nKing's hair, fall heavy to his thighs.\n\nRomanticist of bold conceit,\n\nKnight of an art which strives anew,\n\nHe hurled himself at Drama's feet,\n\nWhen erst Hernani's trumpet blew.\n\nNight falls. The corners are astir\n\nWith many shapes and shadows tall.\n\nThe Unknowngrim stage-carpenter\n\nSets up its darksome frights o'er all.\n\nA sudden burst of candles, weird\n\nWith aureoles, like lamps of death!\n\nThe room is populous, and bleared\n\nWith folk brought hither by a breath!\n\nDown step the portraits from the wall,\n\nA ruddy-litten company!\n\nCircling the fireplace in the hall,\n\nWhere the wood blazes suddenly.\n\nThe figures wrested from the tombs\n\nHave lost their rigid, frozen mien,\n\nThe gradual glow of life illumes\n\nThe Past with flush incarnadine.\n\nA colour lights the faces pale,\n\nAs in the days of old delight.\n\nFriends whom my thought shall never fail,\n\nI thank ye, that ye came to-night!\n\nNow eighteen-thirty shows to me\n\nIts great and valiant-hearted men.\n\n(Ah, like Otranto's pirates, we\n\nWho were an hundred, are but ten!)\n\nAnd one his reddish beard spreads out,\n\nLike Barbarossa in his cave.\n\nAnother his mustachio stout\n\nCurls at the ends in fashion suave.\n\nUnder the ample fold that cloaks\n\nAn ever unrevealèd ill,\n\nPetrus a cigarette now smokes,\n\nNaming it \"papelito\" still.\n\nAnother cometh, fain to tell\n\nHis visions and his hopes supreme.\n\nLike Icarus on the sands he fell,\n\nWhere lie all broken shafts of dream.\n\nAnd one a drama hath begot,\n\nPlanned after some new model's freak,\n\nWhich, merging all things in its plot,\n\nMakes Calderon with Molière speak.\n\nTom, late forsaken by his Dear,\n\nLove's Labour's Lost must low recite;\n\nAnd Fritz to Cidalise makes clear\n\nFaust's vision of Walpurgis Night.\n\nBut dawn comes through the window free.\n\nDiaphanous the phantoms grow.\n\nThe objects of reality\n\nStrike through their shapes that merge and go.\n\nThe candles are consumed away.\n\nThe ember-lights no longer gleam\n\nUpon the hearth. No thing shall stay.\n\nFarewell, O castle of my dream!\n\nDecember gray shall turn once more\n\nThe glass of Time, for all we fret!\n\nThe present enters at my door,\n\nAnd vainly bids me to forget.\n\nCAMELLIA AND MEADOW-DAISY\n\nWe praise the hot-house flowers that loom\n\nFar from their native sun and shade,\n\nThe flaring forms that flaunt their bloom,\n\nLike jewels under glass displayed.\n\nWith never breeze to kiss their heads,\n\nThey have their birth and live and die\n\nOn costly, artificial beds,\n\nBeneath an ever-crystal sky.\n\nFor whomsoever idly scans,\n\nBaring their treasures to entice,\n\nLike fair and sumptuous courtesans,\n\nThey stand for sale at golden price.\n\nFine porcelain holds their gathered groups,\n\nOr glove-clad fingers fondle them\n\nBetween the dances, till each droops\n\nUpon a limp or broken stem.\n\nBut down amid the grass unreaped,\n\nShunning the curious, in repose\n\nAnd silence all the long day steeped,\n\nA little woodland daisy blows.\n\nA butterfly upon the wing\n\nTo point the place, a casual look,\n\nAnd you surprise the sweet, shy thing,\n\nWithin its calm, sequestered nook.\n\nBeneath the blue it openeth,\n\nRising on slender, vernal rod,\n\nSpreading its soul in fragrant breath\n\nFor solitude and for its God.\n\nAnd proud camellias tall and white,\n\nRed tulips in a flaming mass,\n\nAre all at once forgotten quite,\n\nFor the small flower amid the grass.\n\nTHE FELLAH\n\nOn seeing a Water-Colour by Princess Mathilde\n\nCaprice of brush fantastical,\n\nAnd of imperial idleness,\n\nYour fellah-sphinx presents us all\n\nWith an enigma worth the guess.\n\nA rigid fashion, verily,\n\nThis mask, this garment, seem to us,\n\nIntriguing with its mystery\n\nThe ball-room's every Oedipus.\n\nIsis bequeathed her veil of old\n\nTo modern daughters of the Nile.\n\nBut through this band austere, behold,\n\nTwo stars of radiance beam and smile,\n\nTwo stars, two eyes, two poems that spring,\n\nThe soft, voluptuous fires whereof\n\nResolve the riddle, murmuring:\n\n\"Lo, I am Beauty! Be thou Love!\"\n\nTHE GARRET\n\nFrom balcony tiles where casual cats\n\nSit low in wait for birds unwise,\n\nI see the worn and riven slats\n\nOf a poor, humble garret rise.\n\nNow could I as an author lie,\n\nTo give you comfort as you think,\n\nIts window I would falsify,\n\nAnd frame with flowers refined and pink,\n\nAnd place within it Rigolette\n\nWith her cheap looking-glass, somehow,\n\nWhose broken glazing mirrors yet\n\nA portion of her pretty brow;\n\nOr Margery, her dress undone,\n\nHer hair blown free, her tie forgot,\n\nWatering in the pleasant sun\n\nHer pail-encompassed garden-plot;\n\nOr poet-youth whom fame awaits,\n\nWho scans his verse and eyes the hills,\n\nOr in a reverie contemplates\n\nMontmartre with its distant mills.\n\nAlas! my garret is no feint.\n\nThere climbeth no convolvulus.\n\nThe window with its nibbled paint\n\nLeers filmy and unluminous.\n\nAlike for artist and grisette,\n\nAlike for widower and lad,\n\nA garretsave to music set\n\nIs never otherwise than sad.\n\nOf old, beneath an angle pent,\n\nThat forced the forehead to a kiss,\n\nLove, with a folding-couch content,\n\nTo chat with Susan deemed it bliss.\n\nBut we must wad our bliss about\n\nWith cushioned walls and laces wide,\n\nAnd silks that flutter in and out,\n\nO'er beds by Monbro canopied.\n\nThis evening, to Mount Breda fled\n\nIs Rigolette, to linger there,\n\nAnd Margery, well clothed and fed,\n\nNo longer tends her garden fair.\n\nThe poet, tired of catching rimes\n\nUpon the wing, has turned to cull\n\nReporter's bays, and left betimes\n\nA heaven for an entresol.\n\nAnd in the window this is all:\n\nAn ancient goody chattering,\n\nAnd railing at a kitten small\n\nThat toys forever with a string.\n\nTHE CLOUD\n\nLightly in the azure air\n\nSoars a cloud, emerging free\n\nLike a virgin from the fair\n\nBlue sea;\n\nOr an Aphrodite sweet,\n\nFloating upright and empearled\n\nIn the shell, about its feet\n\nFoam-curled.\n\nUndulating overhead,\n\nHow its changing body glows!\n\nOn its shoulder dawn hath spread\n\nA rose.\n\nMarble, snow, blend amorously\n\nIn that form by sunlight kissed\n\nSlumbering Antiope\n\nOf mist!\n\nSailing unto distant goal,\n\nOver Alps and Apennines,\n\nSister of the woman-soul,\n\nIt shines;\n\nTill my heart flies forth at last\n\nOn the wings of passion warm,\n\nAnd I yearn to gather fast\n\nIts form.\n\nReason saith: \"Mere vapour thing!\n\nBursting bubble! Yet, we deem,\n\nHolds this wind-distorted ring\n\nOur dream.\"\n\nFaith declareth: \"Beauty seen,\n\nLike a cloud, is but a thought,\n\nOr a breath, that, having been,\n\nIs naught.\n\n\"Have thy vision. Build it proud.\n\nLet thy soul be full thereof.\n\nLove a womanlove a cloud\n\nBut love!\"\n\nTHE BLACKBIRD\n\nA bird from yonder branch at dawn\n\nIs trilling forth a joyful note,\n\nOr hopping o'er the frozen lawn,\n\nIn yellow boots and ebon coat.\n\nIt is the blackbird credulous.\n\nLittle of calendar knows he,\n\nWhose soul, with sunbeams luminous,\n\nSings April to the snows that be.\n\nRain sweeps in torrents unrepressed.\n\nThe Arve makes dull the Rhone with mire.\n\nThe pleasant hall retains its guest\n\nIn goodly cheer before the fire.\n\nThe mountains have their ermine on,\n\nEach one a mighty magistrate,\n\nAnd hold grave conference upon\n\nA case of Winter lasting late.\n\nThe bird dries well his wing, and long,\n\nDespite the rains, the mists that roll,\n\nInsists upon his little song,\n\nBelieves in Spring with all his soul.\n\nHe softly chides the slumberous morn\n\nFor dallying so long abed,\n\nAnd bids the shivering flower forlorn\n\nBe bold, and raise aloft its head;\n\nBehind the dark sees day that smiles,\n\nEven as behind the Holy Rod,\n\nWhen bare the altar, dim the aisles,\n\nThe child of faith beholds his God.\n\nHe trusts to Nature's purpose high,\n\nSure of her laws for here and now.\n\nWho laughs at thy philosophy,\n\nDear blackbird, is less wise than thou!\n\nTHE FLOWER THAT MAKES THE SPRINGTIME\n\nThe chestnut trees are soon to flower\n\nAt fair Saint Jean, the villa dipped\n\nIn sun, before whose viny tower\n\nStretch purple mountains silver-tipped.\n\nThe little leaves that yesterday\n\nPressed in their bodices were seen\n\nHave put their sober garb away,\n\nAnd touched the tender twigs with green.\n\nBut vainly do the sunbeams fill\n\nThe branches with a flood of light.\n\nThe shy bud hesitateth still\n\nTo show the secret thyrse of white.\n\nAnd yet the rosy peach-tree blooms,\n\nLike some faint blush of first desire.\n\nThe apple waves a wealth of plumes,\n\nAnd laughs in all its fresh attire.\n\nTo bask amid the buttercups\n\nThe timid speedwell ventures out.\n\nNature calls every earthling up,\n\nAnd reassures each tiny sprout.\n\nYet I must off to other sphere!\n\nThen please your poet, chestnuts tall,\n\nYea, spread ye forth without a fear\n\nYour firework bloom fantastical!\n\nI know your summer splendour's pride.\n\nI've seen you standing sumptuous\n\nIn autumn's tunics purple-dyed,\n\nWith golden circlets luminous.\n\nIn winter white and crystal-crossed\n\nYour delicate boughs I saw again,\n\nLike lovely traceries the frost\n\nLimns lightly on the window-pane.\n\nYour every garment I have known,\n\nYe chestnuts grand that loom aloft,\n\nSave one to me you've never shown,\n\nOf young green fabric first and soft.\n\nAh, well, good-bye, for I must go!\n\nKeep, then, your flowers, where'er they be.\n\nThere is another flower I know,\n\nThat makes the springtime fair for me.\n\nLet May with all her blooms arise,\n\nLet May with all her blooms depart!\n\nThat flower sufficeth for mine eyes,\n\nAnd hath pure honey in its heart.\n\nLet be the season where it waits,\n\nAnd blue or dull be heaven's dome\n\nIt smiles and charms and captivates,\n\nThe precious violet of my home!\n\nA LAST WISH\n\nHow long my soul has loved thee, love!\n\nIt is full many a year agone.\n\nThy springwhat charm of flowers thereof,\n\nMy winterwhat wild snows thereon!\n\nWhite lilacs from the land of graves\n\nBlow near my temples. Soon enow\n\nThou'lt mark the pallid mass that waves\n\nEnshadowing my withered brow.\n\nMy westering sun must speedy drop,\n\nAnd disappear behind the road.\n\nAlready on the dim hill-top,\n\nThere gleams and waits my last abode.\n\nThen from thy rosy lips let fall\n\nUpon my lips a tardy kiss,\n\nThat in my tomb, when comes the call,\n\nMy heart may rest, remembering this.\n\nTHE DOVE\n\nO tender, beauteous dove,\n\nCalling such plaintive things!\n\nWilt serve unto my love,\n\nAnd be my love's own wings?\n\nO, but we 're like, poor heart!\n\nThy dear one, too, is far.\n\nRemembering, apart,\n\nEach weeps beneath the star.\n\nLet not thy rosy feet\n\nStay once on any tower,\n\nI am so fain, my sweet,\n\nSo weary turns the hour!\n\nForswear the palm's repose\n\nThat spreadeth over all,\n\nAnd gables where the snows\n\nOf other pinions fall.\n\nNow fail me not, nor fear!\n\nHe dwelleth near the king.\n\nGive him this letter, dear,\n\nThese kisses on thy wing.\n\nThen seek again my breast,\n\nThis flaming, throbbing goal,\n\nThen come, my dove, and rest\n\nBut bring me back his soul!\n\nA PLEASANT EVENING\n\nWhat flurrying of rains and snows!\n\nNow every coachman, blue of nose,\n\nIn fur and ire\n\nSits petrified. Oh, it were right\n\nTo spend this wild December night\n\nBefore one's fire!\n\nThe cosy chimney-corner chair\n\nAssumes its most persuasive air.\n\nI seem to see\n\nIts arms held out, its voice to hear,\n\nBeseeching like a mistress dear:\n\n\"Ah, stay with me!\"\n\nA gauze reveals the orbèd lamp,\n\nLike a fair breast beneath a guimpe,\n\nAnd drowsily\n\nThe shimmer of its light ascends,\n\nFlushing with gold and crimson blends\n\nThe ceiling high.\n\nThe silence frames no sound of things,\n\nSave for the pendulum that swings\n\nIts golden disk,\n\nAnd many winds that roam and weep,\n\nOr stealthy to the hall-way sweep,\n\nTo dance and frisk.\n\nIt's ball-night at the Embassy.\n\nMy coat's limp sleeves are signalling me\n\nTo dress anon.\n\nMy waistcoat yawns. My shirt obtuse\n\nSeems raising high its wristbands loose,\n\nTo be put on.\n\nA narrow boot's abundant glaze\n\nReflects the ruddy firelight's blaze.\n\nHave I forgot?\n\nA glove's flat fingers span the shelf.\n\nA thin cravat protrudes itself,\n\nAnd begs a knot.\n\nThen must I forth? But what a bore\n\nTo seek the over-crowded door!\n\nTo fall in line\n\nOf coaches bearing coats of arms\n\nAnd haughty beauties with their charms,\n\nSuperb and fine!\n\nTo stand against a portal wide\n\nAnd see the surging mass inside\n\nBear form on form:\n\nOld faces, faces fresh and young,\n\nBlack coats low bodices among,\n\nA motley swarm!\n\nAnd puffy backs that hide their red\n\nWith laces fine of costly thread\n\nAerial,\n\nDandies, diplomatists, that press,\n\nWith features dull, expressionless,\n\nAt fashion's call.\n\nWhat! Brave, to win a glance of hers,\n\nThe rows of lynx-eyed dowagers!\n\nTry undeterred\n\nTo speak the dear name of my dear,\n\nAnd whisper softly in her ear\n\nLove's little word!\n\nNay, but I'll not! Her eye shall heed\n\nA letter in the flowers I'll speed.\n\nNo ball-room now!\n\nLet Parma violets make good\n\nWhatever be her passing mood.\n\nThey hold my vow.\n\nEnsconced with Heine or with Taine,\n\nOr, if I like, the Goncourts twain,\n\nThe time will go.\n\nI'll dream, until the hour shall stir\n\nReality, and wait for her.\n\nShe'll come, I know.\n\nART\n\nMore fair the work, more strong,\n\nStamped in resistance long,\n\nEnamel, marble, song.\n\nPoet, no shackles bear,\n\nYet bid thy Muse to wear\n\nThe buskin bound with care.\n\nA fashion loose forsake,\n\nA shoe of sloven make,\n\nThat any foot may take.\n\nSculptor, the clay withstand,\n\nThat yieldeth to the hand,\n\nThough listless heart command.\n\nContend till thou have wrought,\n\nTill the hard stone have caught\n\nThe beauty of thy thought.\n\nWith Paros match thy might,\n\nAnd with Carrara bright,\n\nThat guard the line of light.\n\nBorrow from Syracuse\n\nThe bronze's stubborn use,\n\nWherein thy form to choose.\n\nAnd with a delicate grace\n\nIn the veined onyx trace\n\nApollo's perfect face.\n\nPainter, put thou aside\n\nThe transient. Be thy pride\n\nThe colour furnace-tried.\n\nLimn thou, fantastic, free\n\nBlue sirens of the sea,\n\nAnd beasts of heraldry.\n\nBefore a nimbus gold\n\nTranscendently uphold\n\nThe Child, the Cross foretold.\n\nThings perish. Gods have passed.\n\nBut song sublimely cast\n\nShall citadels outlast.\n\nAnd the forgotten seal\n\nTurned by the plowman's steel\n\nAn emperor may reveal.\n\nFor Art alone is great:\n\nThe bust survives the state,\n\nThe crown the potentate.\n\nCarve, burnish, build thy theme,\n\nBut fix thy wavering dream\n\nIn the stern rock supreme.\n\n---\n\n[Transcribers notes: I have created this online text from two sources: Émaux et camées by Théophile Gautier (Paris: Charpentier, 1872), and Agnes Lee's English translation entitled Enamels and Cameos, published in Volume XXIV of The Complete Works of Théophile Gautier (Cambridge, MA: University Press, John Wilson and Son, 1903).
