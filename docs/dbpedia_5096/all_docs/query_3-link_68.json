        "text": "​REYER, Ernest, whose real name is Rey, was born at Marseilles, Dec. 1, 1823. As a child he learned solfeggio at the free school of music founded by Barsotti (born in Florence 1786, died at Marseilles 1868), and became a good reader, though he did not carry his musical education far. At 16 he went to Algiers as a government official, but continued his pianoforte practice, and began to compose without having properly learned harmony and counterpoint. He was soon able to write romances which became popular, and composed a mass which was solemnly performed before the Duke and Duchess d'Aumale. Had he remained in Algiers he would probably never have been anything beyond a mere amateur, but the Revolution of 1848 depriving him of the support of the Governor-General, he returned to Paris, and placed himself in the hands of his aunt Mme. Louise Farrenc, who completed his musical education, and before long he found an opportunity of coming before the public. From his friend Theophile Gautier he procured the libretto of 'Le Selam,' an oriental 'Symphony' in 4 parts, on the model of David's 'Le Désert.' It was produced with success April 5, 1850, and then Méry furnished him with 'Maître Wolfram,' a 1-act opera, which was also successful, at the Théâtre Lyrique, May 20, 1854. His next work was 'Sacountala' (July 20, 1858), one of the charming ballets of Théophile Gautier; but his full strength was first put forth in 'La Statue,' a 3-act opera produced at the Théâtre Lyrique, April 11, 1861, and containing music which is both melodious and full of colour. 'Erostrate' (2 acts) was performed at Baden in 1862, and reproduced at the Académie, Oct. 16, 1871, for two nights only. The revival of 'La Statue' at the Opéra in 1878 was also a failure, and M. Reyer may find it difficult to secure the performance of 'Sigurd,' of which the overture and some of the more important numbers have been heard. To complete the list of his compositions we may mention 'Victoire,' a cantata (the Opéra, June 27, 1859); a 'Recueil de 10 Mélodies' for voice and PF.; songs for a single voice; and some pieces of sacred music.\n\nBesides being reckoned among the most poetical of French musicians, M. Reyer is an accomplished feuilletoniste. After writing successively for the 'Presse,' the 'Revue de Paris,' and the 'Courrier de Paris,' he became musical critic to the 'Journal des Débats' after the death of Berlioz. His articles are not only pleasant reading, but evince both intellect and culture. He is librarian to the Opéra, and succeeded his first model, David, at the Institut in 1876."
