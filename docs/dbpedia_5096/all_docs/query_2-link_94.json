The comment was (wer-modest when it was made; it is untrue today, for on the walls of his house in the rue de Longchamps at Ncuilly a marble slab reminds us of I'heophile Gautier, poke. Yet it is perhaps symbolic that die plaque remains upon a house that is otherwise forgotten, a house in which no relics have been gathered together, a house to which even those in the rue do Longchamps cannot always direct you. For Gautier, like his last house, is abandoned: pos- terity remembers the rose-coloured doublet, remembers the name from the programme of Giselle-, the student has read, it may be, one of the travel books. Mademoiselle de Maupm, le Capiiaine Fracasse and Emaux ct Camecs. But the rest of the three hundred volumes that Gautier filled with his poems and his travels, his novels and short stories, his plays and his forty unremitting years of journalism: these arc forgotten in libraries, or hidden in the Press of a century ago, buried as deep as Tahoscr in her tomb. And Gautier’s correspondence is even more inaccessible: tlte vast bulk of it remains in the library of the Instiiut de France, the Collection Spoelberch de Lovenjoul at Chantilly. And here, more than eighty years after the poet’s death, his most intimate letters are still being withheld. Twice I went to Chantilly and twice I was forbidden to consult them; and only after several years of research, through the generosity of two distinguished gainicristcs, was I able to see what I believe to be copies of this vital correspondence. Small wonder that there is no good Life of Gautier in liis own language, and that until now there has been no Idfe of Gautier in English. lie still deserves the title that Adolphe Boschot gave him years ago : le grand judcomiu. Misunderstanding by itself is, of course, no adequate reason for a biography. But 1 think that Gautier also has his claims to greatness. Flis two major novels must be examined in any survey of the nineteenth- century French novel; and as a poet he is not only distinguished but influential. As a chronicler of the contemporary French theatre he is incomparably the most gifted, the most accurate and the most pic- turesque; as a critic of art he is original and penetrating. As a writer of travel books he is, at his best, a model. As a correspondent he is charming. His life is a vivid part of the nineteenth century, and as a nineteenth-century figure he is brilliant, exotic, Romantic, ubiquitous and, for all his evident faults, strangely endearing. I have, then, written the Life of Thdophile Gautier because I have 12 FOREWORD lone held him in particular affection and because, to ray muid, Ins Life Lilanded to be witten. The house in the rue de Longchamps remains forgotten; and, as Gautier wrote in his foreword to le Capitaine braca^st, ‘we had to braid a home for tlie wandering ghost . I should like to record my gratitude to those who have helped m n the research for this book: first, and not least, the librarians and Mall of the British Museum Reading Room, the British Museum e ws- paper Library, the Bodleian Library, the Library of the laylor Iiisli- tute, and the Bibliotheque Nationale. I am grateful to M. Jacques Bardoux, of the Assemblee Nationale, M. Georges Lecomie, of He Academie-Frangaise, and M. Marcel Bouteron, of the lustitut, who enabled me to consult the CoUection Spoelbcrch de Loveiqoul at ChantiUy; and to M. Jean Pommier, curator of the Clolleciion, who gave me access to certain unpublished notes and correspondence. I am also indebted to M. Jean Tild, and to Mme Mcyer-Zundel, the Inend of Judith Gautier, who read me passages from the unpublished volume of Ib Collisr des Jours. I am glad to thank Dr Peter Green for his encouragement and excellent criticism, and I am prolotindly giaielul to M. Ptnilp. Henriot, of the Academie-Fran?aisc, who so generously allowed me to use the letters of Gautier to Carlotta Grisi. I owe much to my mother for her patient interest in my Gautier studies, and for aU her constructive comments on this biography. My greatest debt is too large to be paid in a Foreword. I acknowledge it most gladly in the dedication of this book. Oxford-ChantiUy-Paris-London 1953-1958 J.R. Introduction THiiOPHiLii GAUTIER cannot make his ojffiidal^ flamboyant^ rosy- doublctcd entrance until we have raised the curtain on the nineteenth century. A man must perform within the decor of his times^, his part must integrate with the contemporary play. One might almost say that Hernani was Gautier’s cue^ it so perfectly suited him. It is^ however, a common fallacy to date the Romantic movement from 1830: in fact. Romanticism might be traced back far earlier: as far, perhaps, as la Nouvelle H 6 lom in 1761. Rousseau and Chateaubriand, between them, had introduced many elements of Ro- manticism by the turn of the century: morbid introspection, the sense of isolation, pantheism and the return to nature, the love of the exotic, a passionate, fluent, highly-coloured style. In the Meditations of Lamar- tine, published in 1820, the poetry of Christendom, the power of lyricism were revealed. Napoleon’s campaigns had revived an interest in Egypt, Italy, Spaing in a thousand chinoiseries in bric-a-brac shops lay another source of inspiration only waiting to be revived. And before the bataille d' Hernani was fought in 1830, Dumas pere had tossed off his passionate historical dramas Christine de Suede and Henri III et sa Cour^ and Victor Hugo had written the unactable Cromwell^ with the preface that was to become the credo of the new school. On 25 February 1830 there were, then, many Romantic glimmerings in a Romantic firmament; all that was needed was a brilliant planet: or, rather, a pole star to which new writers might turn for constant guid- ance. For many years the old order had been changing; it remained for the new, by some splendid coup-d’etat^ to impose itself. Hernanh first performed on this February night, nearly a hundred and thirty years ago, was to be the most deliberate, most celebrated coiip-d^ 6 tat in literature. The first night was expected to be (and proved to be) a literary battle; and night after night, of course, the battle was repeated. But when Hernani was accepted by the public, the days of classical revival and classical pastiche were ended, and the Romantics were rcsplendcntly enthroned. Romantic drama was a notable failure: psychology and neat construc- tion were conspicuously lacking. The fiasco of Hugo’s les Burgraves in 1843 meant the death of Romantic drama after thirteen years. But the passion, the unrestrained lyricism that had proved the undoing of drama were triumphant in poetry; and the historical sense, the love of the exotic and the adventurous that had failed to save les Burgraves inspired Romantic poets and novelists for years. Much of the stock-in-trade was, of course, bound to date. Byron would not have been happy in 1850. The extremely personal element in Romanticism was followed by the 14 INTRODUCTION extremely impersonal element in the Parnassians; the fantastically im- probable novels of Sue were followed by the chnically realistic novels of the Goncourts. The beginning of the century had seen Chateaubriand’s Rene. The end of the century saw Zola. The change from personal to impersonal, from fantasy to realism, ;ind, one might add, from the effervescent to the cotttained, the uncontrolled to the precise, is, at first glance, very striking. But it was, of course, a very gradual process. And when we look for literary influences, when we try to trace naturalism and reahsm to their sources, we come back to the long-haired, familiar figure in the rose-coloured doublet on the first night of Hernani. Theoplule Gautier was, no doubt, a flamboyant youth; but he soon cast ofi' his Romantic excesses. Basically, like Flaubert, he remained Romantic; but while the rest were still enthusing over the Gothic in 1830, he was already worshipping the Greek ideal of beauty. And while the rest might continue to pose as misunderstood geniuses, Gautier understood that though art must be practised for its own sake, it must be related to hfe if it were to survive. The creed of Art for Art’s Sake, of which he became the chief and most fervent apostle, was not, as is commonly believed, an impractical, peered and highfalutin creed. It was flic recognition of absolute and mdependent standards for art: the only standards, indeed, by which art may be judged. It meant that art was set above the artist, was set above conventional morals or religions, that art was a religion in itself. But Gautier insisted,_time and time again, that art must be brought into the home: that public taste in all forms of art must be improved ; and this insistence is among the most striking facts in his criticism. It is appropriate that the creed of Art for Art’s Sake should have been taught by one who had himself intended to be a painter. It is also under- standable that Gautier’s other great claim to distinction is that he endowed hterature, as surely as Baudelaire, with tin frisson nouveau. It was not, merely, a new excitement, but a new dimension, an umlis- covered sense. For it was Gautier, the one-time artist, who made writers permanently aware of the visual. ‘My whole distinction,’ he told the Goncourts, is that I am a man for whom the visible world exists.’ It was not his whole chstinction; but we may trace a large part of his SSMi?d'''T4 ’ tfiree-dimensional, coloured and accurate writing Ss \"“s™\" ”*■ said for over a or even known, is Gautier the has been sketched in; the actor must make his entrance. PART ONE The Son of Artagnan PART ONE • THE SON OF ARTAGNAN I. The Son of Artagnan Towards THE end of i8io Pierre Gauiierj a minor tax-official^ and his wife^ the former Antoinettc-Adclaidc Cocardc^ spent their honeymoon and early married life at the Chateau d' Artagnan that was one day to figure in a novel. Then they made their way south-east, to the town of Tarbes, near the Spanish border: a town, indeed, so near the Pyrenees, that one could hardly escape the blue vista of mountains at the end of a street. They installed themselves, it is said, in shabby rooms where the previous tenants, an itinerant troupe of actors, had left some properties to settle their debts: the tawdry, tinsel accessories of pantomime. Among them (for the nomads acted Pcrrault) was Cinderella’s tltronc. And to this throne, for want of a bed, Mmc Gautier clung on the night of 30 August 1811. It was on this throne (according to the legend, a tempting legend that one hopes is true) that she gave birth, next day, to the child she had probably conceived at the Chateau d’ Artag- nan: to her first child and only son, a born Romantic: Pierre-Julcs- Thdophile.^ For the first few years of his life Thcophile and his parents lived in this southern town where the sun cut out the shadows with sharp scissors and fell heavy in the summer on brown backs and brown faces. Thcophile looked a southern child, with his dark hair, dark eyes and dusky skin, with his indolence, his momentary moods of elation and depression. And when he was three and a half, and his fitther’s nomina- tion as receiver of taxes led them to Paris, Thcophile made no secret of his temperament. He recalled years later (though perhaps the account was exaggerated) that his regrets for the South made him suicidal: that he hurled his toys out of the window and would have followed had he not been restrained. Parisian French seemed to him a foreign tongue; and once, in a Paris street, as he heard some passing soldiers speaking the fimiiliar Gascon, he tugged his nurse’s hand: ‘Come on! Let’s follow them! They’re ours!’ Though he spent nearly all the rest of his life in Paris, llicophile Gautier remained a southerner: ‘The memory of blue mountains in silhouette at the end of every alley has never left me, and has often touched me in my pensive moods.’ This frail and gentle child, who looked ‘like some little Spaniard from Cuba, chilly and nostalgic,’ lived ‘in the most serene, most chaste of surroundings. It is hard to imagine an existence so purely enshrined as mine. My years llowed past, in the shadow of my mother’s chair, jg THEOPHILE GAUTIER \\vith my litde sisters and the dog. I saw nothing round me but the good, kind tranquH faces of old servants, heads grown white in our service; fnends and relations, grave and devout, clad in black, who put their gloves down separately on the brims of their hats; a few aunts, of a certain age, nice and plump, and neat, discreet, with dazzling linen, grey skirts, string mittens, and their hands folded in their laps, like pious people/- He could read at the age of five. They had taught him for months, with small profit, how to spell; but one day he was given a well-bound, gilt-edged copy of Lydie de Gersin, HCeep it for next year,’ said the donor, 'since you can’t read yet.’ 'I can read,’ stammered Theophile, pale with anger, and retired into a corner; he made such efforts of will and intelligence that he deciphered the book from cover to cover and narrated it when the visitor next called. The door was unlocked. He turned to Robinson Crusoe. He could dream of nothing but desert islands and returns to nature, and stayed for hours in his cabin under the drawing-room table. He went on to Paul et Virgink:, to find an intoxication w’hich (so he declared) he found in no book in his maturity. He learned Latin from his father, a good humanist ; and he spent his leisure copying etchings of Greek triremes : ‘ How many hours I spent shaping a log and hollowing it out with fire like the savages ! How many handkerchiefs I sacrificed for sails! Everyone thought I was going to be a sailor, and my mother grew desperate at the idea of a vocation which in time would take me far away.’ The triremes were succeeded by model theatres, and the decors turned the boy’s thoughts towards painting. But it was time to begin his formal education. On 9 January 1822, at the age of ten years and three months, he entered the College Royal de Louis-le-Grand.^ It was a grim change from the familiar and grateful warmth of home, his father’s kindly tuition, his mother’s enveloping devotion, the wide- eyed adroiration of his younger sisters Lili and Zoe. He was, of course, miserable. His fellow pupils, rough and turbulent, filled him with horror. He felt he would die of cold, boredom and isolation inside the high, grim wails. He was terrified by the college watchdog. The food his mother gave him mouldered in his pockets, he could not eat the food he had at school, and he grew so thin (he recalled) that tlie college bec^e alarmed. On 23 April, after three brief months, his childish aspirations were realized and he was taken away by his family. ' During his unduly short stay at the College,’ went the report, 'he showed him- self gentle, sensible, and ve^ weU disposed. We have had nothing to reproach him for, except a little frivolity during the last days.’-^ THE SON OF ARTAGNAN 19 So it was tliat Theophile Gautier finished his education at the Col- lege Charlemagne as a day boy^ an externe lihrC:, a title which he inscribed with enormous pride on all his written exercises. He made few friends except Eugene de Nully and Gerard de Nerval (who had already dis- tinguished himself by publishing a book of Odes nationales ) ; he did not entirely satisfy his teachers^ for at times he imitated the style of the Latin decadents; and once, congratulated on his perfect prose,, he answered unpleasantly that there was no cause for congratulation: he had made a deliberate mistake and the Latin master had failed to observe it. He also studied old French authors, especially Villon and Rabelais, whom he knew by heart, and he attempted a poem, le Fleuve Scamandre^ translations from the Greek, and a poem on Helen of Troy in decasyllabic verse: all of which have been lost. \"I have no pleasant memory of my college years,’ he wrote, ‘and I should not like to live them over again.’ But long after he had left the College Charlemagne, one not unpleasant memory came to mind: ‘ It was Saint Charlemagne’s Day, and our college had asked the Fran9ais for a performance of Andromaque with Talma playing Oreste. Overexcited by our wine-and- water (a little more purple, a little less watery than usual) we were almost delirious at the thought that we should see the famous actor; and the moment the doors opened, we were all of us sitting down in the pit, under the eye of our ushers. We must admit that Andromaque did not greatly amuse us. No doubt, although we were still in the sixth, nature had deposited some fatal germs of Romanticism within us; but what enchanted us was Talma’s buskin, made of red crossed-over bands which went between his big and second toes. His flesh-coloured tights had toes as a glove has fingers, and that was far more amazing than the sublime manner in which he made his s's vibrate when he tliought he saw the Furies. Alas ! the passion for local colour was already aflame within us!’^ * * The unorthodox collegien spent his holidays at Mauperthuis, and it was at Mauperthuis, it seems, that he read The Mysteries of Udolpko^ the Confessional of the Black Penitents^ the Chateau des Pyrenees:^ ‘ and with what anxiety we read them all, what anguish, what nervous shudders, what cold sweats down our back, especially if it were evening, and the rain whipped the windows, and the winter wind groaned in the chim- ney, and the weathercock screeched on the gables like a bird of night ! The frail and Spanish-looking child was growing sturdy: when he was free from the classroom he went to the Ecole Petit to learn swim- ming, sometimes he spent the whole day in the emerald Seine. It was his ambition to be a strong swimmer, to wear scarlet drawers, a calegon 20 THEOPHILE GAUTIER rotigei it was^ he added later^ \"the only one of my ambitions to be realized'. Nor was swimming Iiis only deviation from the curriculum: before he finished his course, he was learning painting in Rioult’s studio in the nearby rue Saint-Antoine. It was here that he learned the art of close obsen^ation, developed his sense of form and colour; he ow'ed to Rioult, he recorded, his ability to see and appreciate. And he owed, perhaps, to the little, ugly, paralysed master in the rue Saint-Antoine, to the artist whose own painting has been forgotten, the quality that would dominate and distinguish his prose and poetry and, through him, profoundly affect the course of French literature : the quality he would signify to the Goncourts when he told them: \"I am a man for whom the visible world exists.’ His short sight and his merely conventional canvases may have indi- cated to Gautier that painting was not his vocation. But in 1829, in the rue Saint-Antoine, the decisive revelation was accorded him.'^ ‘On a single circumstance, a picture seen, a volume read, a piece of music heard by chance, a destiny may depend ... I should probably have turned artist had it not been for a book by Victor Hugo which fell into my hands m the studio; it was les OrientalesJ . . . Alors s'en vont en foule et stiltaiis et sultanes, Pyramides^ palmiers^ galkes capitaneS:, Et le tigre vorace et le chameau frugal^ Djinns au volfurieux^ danses des bayaderes ^ VArabe qui se penche au cou des dromadairesy Et lafaiwe girafe au galop inegall Alorsy ilephants blancs charges de femmes brunesy Cites aux ddmes d^ or oii les mois sont des lunesy Imams de Mahomety magesy pretres de Bel . . The vision mght die to Hugo in les Orientalesy but it was to remain wiUi Gautier for life. ‘ From that moment the master played a more important part m our existence than the most intimate of our friends.’ In the su^er of 1829, the etemaUy nomadic G6rard de Nerval and Ae wild and fascinatmg Petrus Borel offered to introduce Gautier to Viaor Hugo, the condescending idol of Romanticism.* The young TOitOT amvmg at the rue Jean-Goujon was so overcome that he sat for more t^ an hour on the stairs, summoning composure Still s^echless, he was shown into the presence. Hugo, from Sight of his twenty-seven years, ‘deigned to smile and speak a word or tVo of THE SON OF ARTAGNAN 21 thuis, but he was no longer just a student of art. He was already a student of literature. And when, on 29 October, he attended the first night of Vigny’s le More de Venise^ he was ‘still almost a child, but already loving art with a love that has not left us’.® sjc ifc On 25 February 1830 some of the audience in the Theatre-Frangais pointed out to each other, with horror, M. Theopliile Gautier. ‘His flamboyant waistcoat shone that evening over pale grey trousers with black velvet bands down the seams, his hair cascaded from beneath his flat broad-brimmed hat. The impassibility of his pale and regular features and the sang-froid with which he surveyed the good folk in the boxes proved to what degree of abomination and desolation the theatre had fallen.’ It was the first night of Hernani: the night that was to decide the prestige — one might almost say the supremacy — of the new Romantic literature. Hugo’s garish troops had been waiting for six or seven hours for the decisive fight between traditional and progressive, past and future. Classicism and Romanticism. ‘A rising storm was grumbling in the auditorium, it was time for the curtain to rise; and people might have come to blows before the play, so great was the animosity on either side. At last the three raps sounded. Slowly the curtain drew back and there, in a sixteenth-century bedroom, lit by a little lamp, we saw Dona Josefa Duarte, an old woman dressed in black, her skirt sewn with jade in the style of Isabella the Cathohc, listening for the knocks that the expected lover should knock on his mistress’ secret door: Serait-ce dejd lui? — Cest bien d Vescalier Derobe . . The enjambement had been made and the bataille d\" Hernani had begun. If Hernani had been produced in London that evening, it would have created small stir outside the theatre; broad vocabulary, elastic syntax, freedom from unities of time and place: these were taken for granted by the compatriots of Shakespeare. To the compatriots of Racine it was otherwise. Hugo’s freedom of speech, his enjamhements^ his rejection of the unities amounted to iconoclasm. In Hernani he was attacking the sacrosanct traditions of the theatre; and he was doing so, moreover, in the holy of holies, the Theatre-Frangais. And in France, where litera- ture, and particularly the theatre, is a matter of constant and lively public concern: in France, where literary traditions are fiercely re- spected, and the public is Classical, not Romantic, at heart, Hernani was epoch-making. It was as if a pubhc schooled for generations on 22 THEOPHILE GAUTIER Pope and Dryden were suddenly given the Ode to a Nightingale. Hemani imposed a new way of thought^ a new and successful literary religion. ‘The twenty-fifth of February 1830! ’ wrote Gautier^ not long before he died: ‘The date remains written in flame in the depths of our past : the date of the first performance of Hernani\\ That evening decided our destiny. There we received the impulse that spurs us on^ even now^ after so many years^ the impulse that will make us march on until the end of our days. Many years have passed^ but we still feel all the fervour of our youthj and whenever we hear the enchanted echo of the horn, we prick up our ears like an old warhorse ready to begin the battles of long ago.’^^ ^ Five months after the victory of Romanticism came the July Revolu- tion: tv’-o days of street fighting in Paris which ended in the exile of Charles X and the accession of Louis-Philippe. The bourgeois mon- archy had begun. And as the cannon-smoke wafted down the Passage des Panoramas, there appeared, in the window of Mary, the publisher, a small rose-bound volume printed at the expense of Monsieur Pierre Gautier: forty-two poems, written between 1826 and 1830, the Poesies of his son. Poesies is evidently a first book; there is something timid, even vftginal about it. It is wiritten by a youth far less observant, far less vigoroi^, far less exuberant, than the Gautier who, a few years later, will write Mademoiselle de Matipin. It is the work of a writer who has not yet found himself: who still refers to eyes as soleils jumcaux^ avdens mirotrs, still rhymes madame mxhflamme, still uses all the Gothic im- pedimenta of stained-glass windows, moonht basilicas, corpses on gibbets, birds of prey, death^s heads and cataracts. Byron is openly imitated, and ‘our dear authors, Victor and Sainte-Beuve’ are not far distant. Poesies is no brilliant beginning, but it shows a gentle, boyish poet not to be found in later anthologies: a poet who does not yet see ^^^scape as an unfiramed picture or as a poor substitute for art is, none the less, already preoccupied with the visible world! matever its merits, Poesies passed almost unnoticed in the cannon- smoke of 1830 But the author was not deterred. He was living with his My at 8, place Royale, a comer house in the graceful square now feown as place des Vosges; and soon after the Revolution Victor Hugo Me SS TT\"? swaUows nested in the eaves above, and the chestnuts slowly opened into candles in the sauare below, master and pupil, lord and vassal, talked hterature from window THE SON OF ARTAGNAN 23 to window. And slowly Gautier’s painting was abandoned^ quietly his writing increased. Hugo liked him well enough^ encouraged his admira- tion, let him \"sit like some familiar page on the steps of his feudal throne’. Drunk with such favour, Gautier sought to deserve it, and wrote the legend of Albertiis, It appeared, with his published Poesies^ a score of new poems, and a lithograph by Celestin Nanteuil, late in October 1832. Albertus (it might equally well be called Veronique) is the tale of a witch turned woman who persuades her lover to sell his soul to the devil. Albertus consents, Veronique turns witch again and Albertus dies. The theme is simple and familiar, it is carried through more than a hundred stanzas, and both theme and accessories are supremely Romantic. Albertus is an achievement for a poet of twenty, a lively advance on the Poesies of 1830, it shows a wide technical vocabulary, developing consciousness of visual detail, and anticipates a little of the vigorous description of Mademoiselle de Maupin. It is, however, far from being successful: it is self-conscious, and the style continually distracts from the subject. Gautier’s facility is both an excuse and a warning. And (though he could not have read Lamia:, even in transla- tion) Albertus inevitably suggests the Keatsian poem with which, for feeling, language or technique, it could not stand comparison. Hugo’s bounty had inspired Gautier to write Albertus^ Hugo’s introduction led him to write his first short stories ; for it was at 6, place Royale that he met Eugene Renduel, the publisher who sped about Paris in a cabriolet of steel and ebony, the great Romantic publisher who boasted Balzac and Hugo on his lists and seemed to possess a flair for divining glory. Renduel found Gautier \"droll’ and asked liim to write something for him. The first result was a kind of Precieuses ridicules of Romanticism, les Jeunes-Franced^ And les Jeunes-France surely fulfilled aU Renduel’ s expectations ; it is a collection of satirical short stories which shows Gautier at his youthful best: vigorous, facile, original, paradoxical, gay. The stranger excesses of his artistic contemporaries are parodied in Onuphrius : on les vexations fantastiques d^un admirateur d^Hojfmann, The medieval cult is exploited in the most sympathetic, most poignant of his tales: Elias Wildman- stadius; while Daniel Jovard ou la Conversion d^un classique is a devastat- ing manual for all who would qualify as ^maitre passe en la gaie science du romantisme\\ Celle-ci et CelleAdy ou la Jeune-France passionneC:, already shows the Gautier of Fortunio and Mademoiselle de Maupin : sensual, assured, appreciative, Romantic, and, as he repeatedly tells us, ■^^Turkish in his sexual freedom. These tales, which more than once satirize the author himself, carry weight because they are written with 24 THEOPHILE GAUTIER sympathy as well as amusement; they are sparkling forerunners of the Pantheon Nadar. They are some of the best of Gautier’s early writings they remain among the most spirited of his works. 2. The Green Season At the end of 1834 Pierre Gautier was appointed receiver of taxes at Passy. To move from the place Royale to the very bounds of Paris would, to Theophile, have been exile; and for two hundred and fifty' firancs he rented two tiny rooms in the Impasse du Doyenne and enjoyed his first independence. The Impasse du Doyenne was a dead-end of dilapidated buildings in a comer of the Carrousel, a few yards from the Louvre. It was all that remained of a quartier being demolished, and the houses seemed to Balzac like livmg tombs. The end of the Impasse was marked by weatherbeaten planks salvaged from boats; on the me de Richelieu side was a marsh, on the Tuileries side rose dumps of unused paving-stones on the side of the old Louvre spread the rubble and wreckage of demolition. The ruins of the church of Saint-Thomas-du-Louvre which, m the eighteenth century, had collapsed, killing six canons in Its lalJ^ added to the general desolation. The gloom was pleasing to the Romantic mind, and, to Gautier, tlie rums assumed a charming aspect in moonlight. And if his own foothold in the topasse were small, he was living next door to Camille Rogicr rtS M Charlemagne: Gerard de Nerval They had mstaUed themselves in a large apartment where Ro^er had embelhshed the walls with a porttaif of NeS sagely hke Itself, whfie Gerard had provided tapestries,^ two ^ Renaissance bed for some nebulous divmity (he himself slept in a tent on the floor). In this stranee oasis they were woken each morning by the door-keep4’s cocks crow- maJk in hism^^h! f T ^ fancy-dress ball which made its ^k m totory. The refreshments were visual: Adolphe Leleux the of Braons product a b«;chani in the style of VeSut ei^^nth ee.,^. ,i J THE GREEN SEASON 25 Watteau, while Gerard, engagingly immaterial, contributed the advice that they should wreathe themselves with flowers. The colony and festivities grew: Arsene Houssaye, the future director of the Comedie-Fran9aise, installed himself with Gerard, paying his rent by dinners at the Proven9aux in times of opulence; Eugene Piot, the local Maecenas, photographer and collector of antiques, established liimself on the opposite side of the landing. It was the time of Musard’s intoxicating music, the time of febrile carnivals ; tliey gave their balls in the Doyenne (‘our Louvre,’ as Gerard said) and danced till morning, when they sallied out in daylight, in fancy-dress, to breakfast in the Bois de Boulogne; and sometimes, wildly, they danced at La Chaumiere, where Gautier distinguished himself in the galops, his Merovingian hair flying loose in the wind of his speed. It was an easy-going, energetic, independent world, an enchanting vernal world that tliey would long recall, Gerard in his Petits Chateaux de Bohemey Houssaye in his Cojifessions^ his Souveiiirs de Jeunesse and even in poetry: TheO:, te souviens-tu de ces vertes saisons? . . . Retournons un instant a cette belle annee : Trainons les vieux fauteuils devant la che 7 ninee; Prenons un manuscrit pour rallmner le feii^ Appelons nos deux chats et devisons un peu, Que dit-on par le monde? Eh! quHmporte? nous sommes Dans la verte oasis^ loin du desert des hommes, Laissons-les s^epuiser avec les vanites^ Notre rive vaut mieux que leurs realites . . ?■ And Gautier hardly needed Houssaye to remind him. Again and again he recalled the green Parisian oasis where art was enjoyed for the sake of art and life for the sake of life; again and again he recalled ‘the wild young men who live on their wits a little haphazardly and from day to day: artists, musicians, poets, journalists, who love pleasure better than money, and prefer to all things, even to glory, their indolence and liberty. They are a pleasant and a facile race, full of good instincts, prompt to admire, swept away and diverted by trifles, forgetting to- morrow’s bread for this evening’s conversation. To that Bohemia we all belong, more or less, or we have belonged to it. Oh! happy time when you thought yourself in debt for a few hundred francs, always paid twice over, when you grew drunk with youth if you drank a glass of THEOPHILE GAUTIER 26 water, when you thought yourself Don Juan because your neighbour had smiled at you over her mignonette and sweet peas! How many fine dreams we have spun through tobacco smoke! What splendid stanzas recited, what fine pictures seen! What exchanges, what combinations of formal clothes when it came to a soiree! One of us, obhged to go to a minister’s, could only find, in all Bohemia, a cutaway coat in garnet velvet that an artist friend had ordered for some Pompadour w^him that had once passed through his mind on a prosperous day! . . . We raise our glass, and cry both loud and clear : Vive la Boheme ! ’ ^ * * In this Bohemia, in his microscopic writing, Gautier scribbled away. His renowm was already spreading. The pupil of Rioult had begun to be known as a Salon critic with his articles in la France litteraire. The author of the Poesies, Alter tus, les Jeunes-France was the elated owner of a letter from Hugo: H am very proud, dear Albertus, proud of your fidendship, proud of your talent . . . You are a great poet and an excel- lent friend.’® And Gerard, on his foreign peregrinations, tvrote home to Renduel: Hf you see Petrus and Theophile, tell them tliey’re read in all the reading-rooms of Italy,’-^ Gautier was certainly read in the reading-rooms of France, for les Grotesques, his studies of 'grotesque ’ and unfamiliar French poets, had begun in la France litteraire, in January 1834, with an article on Villon. It w^as, for the times, an audacious article : a few years earlier, Sainte- Beuve had accorded Villon prudent and moderate praise. Now Gautier wrote not only with sympathy but with enthusiastic admiration: an admiration that would do much to resurrect Villon in France. The immediate result was that Theophile Gautier and la France litteraire had both been attacked by le Constitutionnel', and in May 1834, enlarg- ing his diauibe against le Constitutionnel, Gautier had demolished utihtanan literature and the whole tribe of journalists and critics, recited the creed of Art for Art’s Sake that he would profess all his life and, with all the unrestraint and fire of a passionate youth in a wildly exciting age, produced the finest example of rhodomontade in French Hterature. It was the Preface to Mademoiselle de Maupin, . Nothing beautiful is indispensable to life. If you suppressed the flowers, the world would not materially suffer; yet who would wish there were an end of flowers? . . . '1 j ’ music? What is the use of painting? Who wodd be mad enough to prefer Mozart to M. Carrel, and Micl^ngelo to the mventor of white mustard? Nothing is really beautiful unless it is useless; everything useful is THE GREEN SEASON 27 ugly^ for it expresses a need and the needs of man are ignoble and dis- gusting;, like his poor weak nature. The most useful place in a house is the lavatory. 'For myself, I am one of those to whom the superfluous is neces- sary ... I should most joyfully renounce my rights as a Frenchman and a citizen to see an authentic picture by Raphael, or a beautiful woman naked — the Princess Borghese, for example, when she has posed for Canova, or Julia Grisi when she enters the bath . . . ' Instead of creating a prix Mouthy on for the recompense of virtue, I should prefer, hke Sardanapalus, that great philosopher who has been so misunderstood, to give a handsome prize to the man who invented a pleasure; for enjoyment seems to me to be the end of life, and the only useful thing in the world. God has willed it so. He who created women, perfumes and light, lovely flowers, good wines, lively horses, grey- hounds and Angora cats ; He who said not to His angels : \" Be virtuous,” but \"be loving,” He who has given us a mouth more responsive than the rest of our skin that we may kiss women, eyes looking upwards that we may see the light, a subtle sense of smell to draw in the souls of flowers, strong thighs to grip the flanks of stallions and fly as swift as thought, sensitive hands to caress the long heads of greyhounds, the velvet backs of cats, and the satin shoulders of creatures of little virtue, and Who, in short, has given us alone the triple and glorious privilege of drinking without thirst, of striking light, and of making love in every season, which distinguishes us from the brute far more than the habit of reading papers and making charters. . . The vibrant love of beauty, the passionate love of pleasure, the capacity for enjoyment, the question of Art for Art’s Sake, all is there in embryo ; despite the outrageous manner, the ghttering pyrotechnics, the enormous paradoxes, the astonishing, constant rain of conceits, the Preface to Mademoiselle de Maupin contains much that stayed deep in Gautier’s soul all his days. And it contained, too, much that had an unconscious irony: 'You only become a critic when it is weU proved in your own eyes that you cannot be a poet. Before you degrade yourself to the wretched task of looking after the coats and noting the moves like a billiard-boy or a ball-boy, you have long courted the Muse, you have tried to possess her; but you lack the strength for it. Breath has failed you, and you have fallen weak and pale at the foot of the holy mountain. 'I understand this hatred of critic for poet. It is oppressive to see someone else at the banquet to which you yourself are not bidden, someone else sleeping with the woman who has rejected you. From the 28 THEOPHILE GAUTIER depths of my heart I sympathize with the unfortunate eunuch obliged to watch the sport of the Grand Signor/ ^ Many of Gautier’s theories as a critic of literature (and^ indeed^ as a critic of the arts in general) are found in the Preface and text of Mademoiselle de Manpin. The Preface bears little relation to the novel, and is probably included on its ov^^n brilliant merits as a polemic. To posterity it has more than polemical interest j for when Gautier derides the whole conception of utility and declares, with all the ardour of his early manner, all the categorical certainty of youth, that 'nothing is really beautiful unless it is useless’, he is for the first time professing the creed that he will profess, as poet and as critic, throughout his life. The Preface to Mademoiselle de Maupiri:, written at the outset of his career, is an impressive declaration of the creed of Art for Art’s Sake, of the sovereignty of art, of its independence of moral and social con- ditions. It insists upon the supreme importance of beauty^ it is an early expression of the philosophy tliat Gautier will express, more than twenty years later, in la Nue: ‘Aime! e'est V cssentiel ! \" It is only this belief in beauty and in love that relates the Preface to Mademoiselle de Maupin, The novel is, in fact, much less a novel than an admirable series of visual descriptions, an honest, full-blooded likeness of Gautier in his early twenties, a Gautier already possessing many of the beliefs and emotions that will inform his criticism. The story is the least important part of the book : it is only important in so far as the equivocal position of the heroine, her ability to arouse a double passion, enables Gautier to suggest that beauty may be loved inde- pendently of sex, and for its own sake. His personal worship of loveli- ness is seen here not merely in his delicate and emotional portraits of women, but in his lyrical invocation to ideal beauty ('Whomsoever thou be, angel or demon, virgin or courtesan . . .’) and in his hymn to beauty, 'pure personification of the thought of God’. Time and again in Mademoiselle de Maupin we are made aware of the author’s religion of beauty, his Greek worship of loveliness. 'I entirely understand the wild enthusiasm of the Greeks for beauty,’ he declares i it is the ex- planation of his assertion that 'Christ did not come for me; I am as pagan as Alcibiades and Phidias’. In his attitude to beauty, Gautier is pagan indeed; and there remains profound trutli in his comment: 'I have looked at love in the classical light, as a more or less perfect piece of sculpture.’ If he could consider a woman as her sculptor, this showed no inhumanity: it showed, rather, the Greek attitude, the attitude of the artist and idealist. And in his search for beauty and love, Gautier was a confirmed idealist: 'There is something great and fine in loving THE GREEN SEASON 29 a statue/ he proclaims in his novel. ‘ The impossible has always pleased me.’ This Romantic love of the impossible recurs throughout his work and dominates his life. It is the love he describes when he writes: ‘If Don Juan had once found his ideal^ he would have been the most faitliful of lovers ; but his greatness was in not meeting it^ for he sought absolute beauty^ and absolute beauty is God.’ ^ * Mademoiselle de Maupin was published by Renduel late in 1835. It is a version of As You Like It written with all the naivete of a Romantic in his early twenties. It is based on a premise that does not bear the scrutiny of reason: that a woman could pass among young and old, men and women, amorous and experienced, month after month, as a man. Once this wild impossibility is accepted, we accept every conceivable quid pro quo; perversion becomes innocent or mitigated, love grows hesitant or guilty, and morality becomes strangely contorted. It is not surprising that the novel shocked contemporary opinion : the emotions it revealed were far from the conventional, idealised emotions of la Nouvelle Heloise. Yet Mademoiselle de Maupin is more than an explora- tion of forbidden pleasures. If it impresses us by its unrestrained sen- suality, its detailed, appreciative physical description, it impresses us, too, by its impulse and enthusiasm: its fire, momentum and vivacity transform it into a testament of youth. Mademoiselle de Maupin is a book that is written once in a lifetime, when dreams have not dissolved and disillusion is still unknown. None of Gautier’s later prose is driven by the same energy j no novel better embodies the careless rapture of the young Romantic. And the book is more than a Romantic novel, more even than a testament of youth: it is a profession of faith. It is this eager profession that gives Mademoiselle de Maupin both lyricism and dignity. If the Preface is a tour de force as much as a declaration of the principle of Art for Art’s Sake, the text itself has a higher status. It is a brilliant though unconscious development of the Keatsian theme: ‘I have lov’d the principle of Beauty in all things.’ It shows, already, Gautier’s passionate idealism, his eager, wholehearted worship of beauty. ‘I adore above all things the beauty of form; beauty, for me, is visible Divinity, palpable happiness descended on earth . . . Beauty, which alone of all things cannot be acquired; frail and ephemeral flower that grows without being sown, pure gift of heaven! Oh beauty I the most radiant diadem with which chance may crown the brow — thou art admirable and precious like everything beyond the reach of man, like the azure of the sky, the gold of stars, the perfume of tlie seraphic lily! One may change a footstool for a throne; one may con- quer a world, many indeed have done so; but who could not kneel THEOPHILE GAUTIER 30 before thee^ pure personification of the thought of God!’ Seen in this spirit^ Mademoiselle de Maiipin has an aesthetic significance. It is not merely the earliest and best-written of Gautier’s novels. It is tlie first, the most sustained, and one of the most brilliant of Gautier’s profes- sions of his creed. * iic -1^ The year of Mademoiselle de Maupin was an exciting year : ‘ Come and dine one of these days in your old corner of the place Royale,’ wrote Hugo to his disciple in January. ‘There is a swallow’s nest over one of your old windows which always makes me think of you. You should certainly do as the swallow, and come back and lodge there in the month of April.’ ^ And then, one morning, a young man of distinguished appearance crossed Gautier’s threshold in the Impasse du Doyenne: Jules Sandeau, an emissary from Balzac. Balzac had read Mademoiselle de Maupin^ much admired the style, and wanted Gautier to collaborate on his paper le Chroniqiie de Paris. For all his literary success, the author of Mademoiselle do Maupin felt apprehensive when, for the first time, he went to meet the author of la Peau de Chagrin^ Eugenie Grandet and le Pkre Goriot. Balzac had already achieved enough to found half a dozen reputations. It was with something of the nervousness he had known, six years ago, when he had first met Hugo, that Gautier introduced himself. Bull-ncckcd, fiery-eyed, wearing the white flannel robe that symbolized, perhaps, his cloistered life, Balzac had risen at midnight and worked until his visitor’s arrival, but he showed no sign of tiredness, indeed throughout tlie lunch he was wildly gay. The conversation veered cowards litera- ture; by the time they had finished the foie gras (with forks especially borrowed from Balzac’s publisher), Gautier had promised to write for the Chromque de Paris. He had also formed a friendship that was to last until the death of Balzac, fifteen years later. * > 1 : In July 1836, with the restless Gerard, Gautier set out on his first journey abroad: to Belgium, ‘to seek the reality of Rubens paintings.’ The Hotel de Ville in Brussels was to him a revelation of the Middle Ages, and the Gothic palace opposite was so dramatic in moonlight that he waited for the entry of that passionate Romantic actress, Mmc Dorval. Then he and Gerard went on by train to Antwerp, through a landscape ‘perfectly flat and perfectly green; here and there the white houses of Laeken, like marguerites, blossomed on rich emerald carpets dotted with heavy oxen which swam in grass up to the belly; English gardens with yellow alleys, sleepy rivers with pewter and quicksilver waters, Chinese bridges illumined with brilliant colours, passed to left THE GREEN SEASON 31 and right; tall thin poplars filed past at a gallop; towers rose up on the edge of the horizon, great pools of water, the scattered scales of some gigantic fish, mirrored here and there on the brown earth. In the numerous hollows by the edge of the railway, a few taverns, with Verkoopt men dranken in letters a foot high, smiled sweetly from the bottom of their tiny hop-gardens, and made a thousand advances to the traveller, inviting him to get down and drink a good glass of strong Flemish beer, and smoke a pipe of patriotic Belgian tobacco: useless advances, for on a railway you caimot stop, even to drink — which, to my mind, is one of the gravest disadvantages of trains.’ And sensual, enthusiastic, young in heart, still the Gautier of Made- moiselle de Maupin^ Gautier returned to France in August, to take the most momentous step in his life. Until now he had been a poet, a novelist, writing gaily and not too often in lesser journals. On 26 August 1836 his article on the paintings in the Throne Room of the Chambre des Deputes appeared, with the signature ' Gauthier’ he so deplored, in la Presse, Emile de Girardin, the editor, promptly asked him to write on the art of the French School in Rome.® The second article appeared on 30 August. Girardin declared: ‘Your place, Monsieur, is assured by the article you have written, for all tlie articles you write.’^ And so, the day before his twenty-fifth birthday, the green season of life was ended. Theophile Gautier entered the newspaper world. His journalism would take him from Salon to concert to theatre, among the most distinguished men and women of the age; it would carry him to London, Munich and Berlin, to Spain, Algeria and Italy, to Turkey, Denmark, Russia, Greece, and Switzerland and Egypt. It would pro- duce a ceaseless flood of novels and short stories and more than two thousand articles for the next thirty-six years. It would shape and fill his life. It would weigh upon his shoulders all his days. PART TWO • FORTUNIO THE CRITIC 3. Fortunio the Critic Emile de Girardin^ five years older than Gautier, was the natural son of Alexandre de Girardin, General, and Grand Veneur to Charles X, and Aime Dupuy, the wife of a counsellor at the Cour royale in Paris. ‘ He was an imposing figure in an imposing age. At every step you walk into this cold, swift man, this suppressed volcano, this marble beacon which flames on all the horizons of the intelligence. You will meet him on the rostrum, you will meet him in the Press, always rejected, always victorious, taking by assault the place that is refused him, fearful adversary, feared ally . . Dickens would be awestruck by Girardin’s arsenals of cigars, Rachel would be one of his mistresses, the royalty of art and letters were already among his guests and contributors, if not among his friends. He had chosen the newspaper industry as he would have chosen mining if his tastes had led him to metallurgy; and he had founded and now edited la Presse. He professed constant scorn (it was said) for literature pure and simple. He was, above all, tough, disciplinarian and businesslike: some declared he rose at four to begin his day. It has been rightly said that the chief of Gautier’s editors was more American than French. He was certainly the antithesis of Gautier. He was the supreme example of the self-made man, tlie nine- teenth-century precursor of Citizen Kane. But if Emile de Girardin was an exacting employer, his wife was the most graceful of presiding deities. Under the pseudon 5 nn of le Vicomte de Launay, Delphine de Girardin contributed engaging gossip-columns to la Presses she was to write more than one play for Rachel. Her con- versation, her presence, her influence were alike delightful. In her salon in the rue Saint-Georges, Lamartine spoke of poetry to Hugo, Gautier and Balzac spun their verbal fantasia. And just as her salon lent charm to Gautier’s life, so her influence gently smoothed his professional path. It is said that she had advised her husband to make him the literary editor of la Presse. But among the contributors was Balzac: far less amenable as journalist than he had been as host or guest; and Gautier found diplomacy difl5.cult. ‘My lovely queen,’ went his note to Mme de Girardin,^ ‘if I’m to go on getting caught between Emile the anvil and Balzac the hammer, I shall resign my office. I’d sooner plant cabbages or rake the paths in your garden.’ ‘ I have a very satisfactory gardener, thank you,’ answered Mme de Girardin. ‘Go on keeping order in the palace.’ THEOPHILE GAUTIER 36 She counted Gautier among her closest and most favoured friends, she treated him with tact, charm, affection; and in her presence, when he wrote to her, he showed his happiness: 'Madame, I regret I have an engagement today,’ goes a letter in his hand, 'but I shall come this evening and be there when the fireworks arc let off after dessert. Like the urchins on public holidays I shall go home with five or six rockets. At your feet.’ ifc :1c The poet who charmed Mme de Girardin had a strong and unsur- prising fascination for womens and had already charmed them with effect. We do not know where he met Eugenie Fort : perhaps in literary circles, for she had certain literary pretensions, and could turn her hand to translation. We know little about her save that she came of good family, was passionate by nature and Spanish in appearance. But what more was needed to attract the partisan of Hernam\\ the future author of Voyage en EspagJie} Eugenic grew wildly enamoured of his poetry and of himself; and Gautier, who wrote her Declaration and Apres le bal^^ who had made her the heroine of Onuphrius in les Jeimes- France A grew enamoured of Eugenie: Par un caprice poetique^ Notre climat para Dhme grace au charme exotiqiie Cette autre Petra Camara, De chaudes teintes orangees Dorent sajoue au far d vermeil; Ses paupieres de jais fratigics Fihrent des rayons de soleil. Entre ses levres d^icarlate Scintille un eclair argentic Et sa beaute splendide eclate Comme une grenade en etL Au son des guitares d’Espagne Ma voix long temps la celebra. Elle vint un jour^ sans compagne^ Et ma chambre fut ? Alhambra . . , On 27 November 1836 Eugenie gave birth to Th(§ophilc Qmtidx fils. According to Arsene Houssaye,'^ that happy spinner of talcs, her FORTUNIO THE CRITIC 37 brother promptly offered Gautier the alternatives of marriage to Eugenie or a duel. Gautier (so legend continues) replied that he would accept the lesser of the evils^ chose Houssaye and Eugene Plot as his seconds, and went next morning, at daybreak, to the gardens of Saint-Ouen, near Montmartre. The duel began. Then he had a change of heart, and agreed to recognize his son. And what of Eugenie? Houssaye records that Gautier Tore up this chapter in his life’; Eugenie herself implies in her diary that she refused a proposal from this poet of inadequate means. Did Gautier ever pro- pose to Eugenie? He says that he had oriental ideas about women: that he would have preferred to be faithful to several wives rather than deceive a wife with several mistresses. Perhaps he could not have borne the idea of final or exclusive commitments. Perhaps he continued to wait, like d’ Albert in Maupiri:, for some impossible Romantic ideal. Whatever the trutli, he might have been much happier had he married Eugenie now; and he often professed to regret that he had not done so. Meanwhile, Eugenie forgave him for his misdeeds, brought up le petit Fortunio^ and earned the lasting devotion of Gautier’s two sisters, Lili and Zoe, who addressed her persistently as ‘Madame Gautier’. And while she retired, for the moment, into the shadows of his life, Gautier himself fell under the spell of Victorine, ‘a beautiful brown girl, crimson moutli and hellfire eyes.’ She seems to have been digrisette with little but physical attractions. Fierce and unscrupulous, she re- mained his mistress until, in 1841, he fell in love with the unattainable Carlotta Grisi. ^ ^ Theophile Gautier, this selfish, attractive Romantic, was sometimes seen in Paris in Egyptian costume (‘one or two women, knowing I only knew Arabic, even declared that I was very fine’).^ This original journalist, this engaging conversationalist, would have been Balzac’s chosen companion in Italy in the spring of 1837; but ‘my disappoint- ments began with the loss of my travelling companion’, wrote the novel- ist to Mme Hanska on a rainy Florentine day.® ‘ Gautier was to share the expenses of the journey and write a serious sequel to his Belgian travels ; but the need to do the exhibition and write accounts of all the wasted canvas at the Louvre, obliged him to stay at home. Italy is the loser, for he is the only man capable of saying something new about it and of understanding it; but next time I make the journey, he will come.’ And so Balzac consoled himself in Italy, while Gautier remained in Paris, assessing the influence of Ingres and Delacroix, the brilliant advance in landscape painting, the future of sculpture, That art so royal, so divine’,'^ and waiting for the imminent publication of Fortunio, THEOPHILE GAUTIER 38 Fortunio is written with something of the fire and vigour of Mademoi- selle de Maupini it is the story of an impeccably beautiful courtesan who kills herself for love of a flawlessly handsome^ dazzling, and largely indifferent young man. Fortunio (like d’ Albert in Mademoiselle de Maupin) has many characteristics of the young Gautier, many qualities that Gautier dreamed of possessing. Fortunio, in his early twenties, is nonchalant, yet suggests a hidden vivacity and strength. He looks more Spanish than French, more Arabian than Spanish, his complexion is sallow, his hair is black and long^ his hands (and Gautier was proud of his hands) are of 'inimitable perfection’. He is a fine conversationalist, a man of the world, an irresistible lover, an admirable horseman, a youth of fabulous wealth who demolishes part of Paris to build his Eldorado, the golden glass-domed palace of his dreams. Mademoiselle de Maupin had been a hymn to beauty; Fortunio is a fitting sequel, a cantata in praise of wealth, the splendour that surrounds it and the splendour that it brings. 5|< 5|C jfC ‘The feeling for poetry is not so dead in France as certain critics say,’ wrote Gautier happily in January 1838, on the revival of Hernani, ‘Art is still loved; and we are not just reduced to the whipped cream of the Vaudeville.’® On 10 February his words were put to the test: his new book of poetry, la Comedie de la Morty was published by Dcscssart. ‘What! Theophile Gautier a poet ! ’ cried Mme de Girardin with feigned sur- prise.® ‘This prince of mockers, this master of irony, this great icono- clast, is also a dreamer of cascades, a melancholy inhabitant of the floating kingdom of clouds! Gautier, the brilliant contributor to la Presse 1 ’ The astonishment recorded in the Lettres parisiennes was ex- pressed, less kindly, in V Artiste: ‘Never [that journal declared] never did man have fewer pretensions to serious thought than M. Thdophile Gautier. If, in his productions, you perceive an apparently moral or philosophical opinion, be well assured that, when you come closer, you will only find the strangest paradox sustained with sang-froid and ending in monstrous fancy ... As soon as M. Thdophile Gautier abandons the realm of thought, where he sees nothing but chaos, to concern himself exclusively with the transient sensations of each day, he writes with verve and magnificence. Every fine form and graceful image, everything bright and beautiful, shining and splendid, is found in his poetry . . La Comedie de la Mon is based on the Romantic theme of life in death and death in life: the poet, wandering about the cemetery, imagines the agony of tlie dead who have not died, who have discovered FORTUNIO THE CRITIC 39 the inconstancy of their lovers^ the indifference of their relations^ grown bitterly aware of the world’s forgetfulness. And then, returning to the living world, the poet turns to those who suffer from le neant tnvisibky from the inner, spiritual death that no one mourns and no one sees; and in a final passage that touches a new height of poetry, he pleads with death to spare him: Je suis trap jeune encor^ je mux aimer et mvre:, O Mon! . . . etje ne puis me resoudre d te stiivre Dans le sombre chemin; Je rCai pas eu le temps de bdtir la colonne Oil la Gloire viendra suspendre ma couronne; O Morty reviens demainj Vierge aux beaux seins d^albdtre^ epargne ton poete^ Souviens-toi que ckst moi quide premier fai faite Plus belle que le jour; J^ai change ton teint vert en pdleur diaphane^ Sous de beaux cheveux noirsj^ai cache ton vieux crdne, Etje fai fait la cour, Laisse-moi vivre encor^je dirai tes louanges; Pour orner tes palais^ je sculpterai des angeSy Je for gerai des croix; Je ferai dans Veglise et dans le cimetiere Fondre le marbre en pleurs et se plaindre la pierre Comma au tombeau des rois!

Je veux une jeimesscy N^eut-elle qu^un seul jour! . . But death comesj unrelenting. La Comedie de la Mort is technically far in advance of Albertus. Gautier has lost his stylistic self-consciousness, he is borne along by his theme; and he is already deeply troubled by doubts of the life to come. He is not only terrified (as he will always be) by the thought of physical decomposition, he is already profoundly saddened by the thought of spiritual death: the death which, to him, is far worse than the death of tlie body. He can only counsel, in the words of Faust, in the words that he himself will echo in la NuCy some thirty years later, ' Aimez! car tout est Id!' He beheves in delighting in life. He would like to believe in a consolation after death, but he cannot ; and he will never be able to accept the Catholic belief in the life to come. Gautier will always venerate all rehgions; he will constantly practise many of the Catholic virtues. And whatever his cynicism, it will always hide a Romantic thirst for the impossible, the longing implicit in la Comddie de la Mort\\ the longing to believe, the longing for Christian faith that is not satisfied. % And then there must be a footnote, for Gautier is not wholly portrayed in Fortunio and in his poetry. And in the turning pages of memoirs and correspondence he passes before us, like a shadow show, the author of la Comidie de la Morty the wild, engaging Gautier of 1839: harassed by the authorities for failing to mount guard with the garde nationale^^ dispatching his Abyssinian servant, Abdallah Pergialla, to collect his dues from his editors,^® boosting Balzac, that literary Briarcus, in la Pressej-^^ and receiving from Balzac tlie dedication of Une Princesse parisienne.^^ He watches Mile Grahn taking over la Sylphide from Mile Elssler, and decides she has 'earned her place among the most brilliant DON TEOFILO 41 hopes of the Opera; her feet already speak French very weU’.^® He sends an urgent request to Girardin: ‘Please give 100 francs or more to the bearer of this note^ be kind enough to do what I ask for without money I should die of hunger in the tyrant’s cells — I will setde the debt with quick and copious copy — come and see your unfortunate contributor under lock and key.’^\"^ And then^ out of prison^ there is a gay glimpse of him in the salon of the ‘ docte Uranie/ the Princess Belgiojoso passing through the ‘veritable string of catafalques’ in the rue d’Anjou-Saint- Honore^ the decor which would have done credit to the Theatre de la Porte-Saint-Martin. A turbaned negro in a brocade skirts out of Veronese, leads him to the Gothic oratory decorated with death’s heads, then into the salon hung with silver-starred black velvet, where the princess Hes receiving her guests. Pale as a risen corpse (her pallor carefully maintained) the ‘nouvelle JuHe’ limply reclines on a sofa, a nargileh between her lips and a wreath of fuchsias about her brow, welcoming Gautier, Heine, Houssaye, and a multitude of artists and dandies, madrigals and compliments. 4. Don Teofilo In MARCH 1840, on the eve of the Salon, Gautier demanded a rise from la Presse. ‘ It is painful to discuss remuneration for intellectual work because I have to vaunt my abilities, but I cannot do this work for so little: I have always found the payment inadequate . . The letter clearly, pathetically shows that Gautier lacked the toughness of the journalist. Girardin recognized the fact and miderpaid him, while he considered him an imbecile for not selling his soul to the theatre man- agers and raising his income from 3,000 to 40,000 francs. It seems unlikely that Gautier was given the increase for which he asked; and within a week or two, as so often happened, he had found a means of expressing his feelings to his readers. The pretext was a performance of Vigny’s Chatterton: ‘ . . . Poor Chatterton, it seemed hard indeed to work for your living, to seU your immaterial thoughts, to be driven on by a bookseller! You preferred to empty your phial of opium rather than finish your task uninspired. Today you would drink three cups of black coffee to have fever for want of inspiration, if you were a journalist like us, obliged to concern yourself always with the thoughts of others, obliged to foUow their dreams and not your own, to improvise without rest, to write THEOPHILE GAUTIER 43 night and day, about everything, about notliing, v^^ith no time to study, to correct, obliged to sacrifice every morning what is dearest to man, literary self-respect ... You are rich, you are loved, what more do you want ? Egoist ! When you died you did not think of Kitty Bell ; when you burnt your poems, you did not think of posterity, that pale comforter of the great and misunderstood.’^ * ?fi Some time that April, when the restlessness of the spring was upon him, Gautier remarked that he wanted to visit Spain. The stray remark, so he tells us, was taken for an intention, and soon his friends were asking when he would leave and expressing surprise to sec him still in Paris. He did not need much persuasion to depart; for if spring fever drew him towards the Pyrenees, he also longed to break the chain of journahsm, to refresh his mind, to make a voyage of discovery, to see for himself the inspiration of Hernani and some of les Orientales;, to search for the Toledo swords of Romantic oratory. And this last motive, in- deed, was more than metaphorical; for as Eugene Piot, his companion, pointed out, Spain was impoverished by the Carlist Wars and Spanish antiquities should be cheap to buy. On 5 May, bearing a primitive camera and high Romantic hopes, they left on the Bordeaux diligence on the first stage of their journey. At last they came to the bridge of la Bidassoa, half in France and half in Spain; another few turns of the wheels, and Gautier might lose an illusion, see the flight of the Spain of his dreams, the Spain of the romancero, the Spain of the ballads of Victor Hugo, the Spain of the tales of Merimee and the contes of Alfred de Musset. As he crossed the border he remembered the pleasant challenge of Heine: 'How will you talk about Spain once you have been there? ’ 'Jc: On one side of the bridge stood a gendarme, grave and upright; on the other, a Spanish soldier lazed in the grass. Already the undulating roofs, the whitewashed walls of Irun had a touch of the Moorish about them; the horses were unharnessed and replaced by mules. A zagal in pointed cap with velvet stripes came to look after the carriage, and two esco- peteros sat on the box to scare the bandits. Then off they galloped, while beggar children tossed flowers and wild strawberries into the carriage. At sunset next day the exotic procession entered Vittoria. Gautier shufiied oif the lethargy of Paris like a chrysalis, and flew from customs to church, from church to supper, from supper to a theatre to see a haile nadonaL A few hours later they set off for Burgos, where the magnificence of the cathedral filled him with despair: 'Utter sadness falls upon me when I visit one of these prodigious buildings of the DON TEOFILO 43 past^’ he was to write. 'A vast discouragement takes hold. And all I want is to retire into a corner, set a stone beneath my head, and await, in the immobihty of contemplation, the final immobility of death. Why labour, why bestir oneself? The most violent human effort will never excel it . . . When I think that Fve spent the best part of my life rhyming ten or twelve thousand hnes, writing six or seven poor volumes in and ±ree or four hundred bad newspaper articles, I am ashamed of myself and of my times.’ They left Burgos in 'a fantastic coffer with aU sorts of queer-shaped windows, and furnished inside with little satin-covered cushions which might have been pink once upon a time . . . This respectable carriage was trustingly slung on ropes, and tied together in dangerous places with esparto cords’. They drove off as if the devil followed and, sure enough, as Gautier revolved some hemistich in his mind, they came to sudden grief. Pink cushions covered the road, the mules had vanished, and in an even more dubious vehicle they sped on to Valladolid to watch a Spanish translation of Hernani, Dona Sol, noted Gautier, ‘was almost as young as Mile Mars, and lacked her talent’. The acidity of the remark behed his mood: free of journalism, of the petty cares of daily existence, he was not merely happy but exalted; and on the way to Madrid, when they were forced to dismount and follow the carriage on foot across the mountains, he was drunk with the pure, sharp air: T felt so lighthearted, so joyful, so full of enthusiasm, that I cried aloud and capered about like a young goat; I wanted to throw myself head first into all these charming chasms, so azured, so vaporous, so velvet; I should have liked to roU in cascades, bathe in every stream, take a leaf from every pine, wallow in sparkling snow, mingle with all this nature, and melt hke an atom in this immensity.’ The high peaks glinted and seethed with hght like dancers’ sldrts in their rain of silver spangles; at times it was hard to know where moun- tain ended and heaven began. And sometimes tliey met Valencians, as brown as Florentine bronze, leading convoys of mules bedecked with bells and fringes and striped coverings. Then they descended the mountains, crossed a dry and desolate landscape, entered Madrid, settled in la fonda de la Amistad^ and sent the servant for tickets for the next bullfight. * * As he waited for the buU to burst into the huge arena on that sunlit summer day in 1840, Gautier experienced one of the strongest emotions he had known. The colour and savagery, the skill, the audacity of tlie corrida swept him into a Romantic heaven, so impressed him tliat in later life he would wait five hours in Mediterranean heat for a fight. THEOPHILE GAUTIER 44 or ride thirty leagues to see Montes wield his sword. Of all the myriad spectacles he had witnessed in Paris and was to witness in many parts of the worlds none so excited him^ none so possessed him. And Gautier’s impressions of Spain show a gaiety and entrain that none of his later travel books recaptures. He was twenty-eighty free and vigorous^ the full weight of journalismy of deception and unhappinessy had not yet fallen upon himy he was not yet suffering from debts and persistent creditors. In Spain, in this summer and autumn of i840y he ^yd’ecaptured some of the joyousness of the Impasse du Doyenne. He was only to know it once more in his life. Night after night he wandered down the Prado at Madridy admiring the women with their heart-shaped mouths y like so many Regency portraitSy and looking (amateur of the picturesque) for a manola:, one of a vanished race; and 'onccy as I crossed the Rastro quarter of Madridy I found myself in a tiny deserted alley; and there, for the first and last time, I saw the manola I wanted. She was a big strapping girl of about twenty-four, with a swarthy complexion, a sad and steady gaze, a rather full mouth, and something indefinably African in her face. An enormous tress of hair, so black that it was blue, was swathed round her head and held up by an elaborate comb; bunches of coral hung from her ears and round her sunburnt neck; a red fan trembled like a cinnabar butterfly in fingers that were weighted with silver rings. Then the last of the manolas turned the corner of the alley and dis- appeared from my astonished gaze. I had this once, in the real and living world, seen a dress of Duponchel’s, a costume from the Opera ! ’ The Madrid of 1840 is caught in the amber of Voyage en Espagne : tire water- sellers bearing sunburnt barrels on their backs, the fire-sellers, with their cry offuegojuego, offering lights for cigarettes and Havana cigars, the cafes where the visitor regales himself with almond drinks m&spumasi and, late at night, when the city is otherwise silent, the choirs of chirp- ing crickets hung in cages outside the windows. And vivid, too, in its contrast, is Gautier’s impression of the Escurial: huge, bleak and terrible. In the chapel of the Escurial he felt so down- cast, so crushed, so firmly in the hold of some inflexible, unseen power, that prayer seemed useless. When he climbed to the palace roof, he felt he stood on some monument of the Pharaohs; when he paced the corridors, he moved in some architectural nightmare. ' I advise those who have the fatuity to believe themselves depressed to go and spend three or four days at the Escurial; there [he wrote] they will learn the real meaning of spleen, and all the rest of their lives they will enjoy the thought that they might be in the Escurial and they’re not.’ When Madrid had been exhausted, he and Piot left for Toledo, ‘the DON TEOFILO 45 town of fine swords and Romantic daggers’; and from the top of the ruined Alcazar^ which seemed to reahze Piranesi’s dream^ Gautier admired the sunset. He bathed in the Tagus, explored the cathedral conscientiously to fulfil his Tiumble mission of literary daguerreotype’, and returned to Madrid to catch the dihgence for Granada. * * Granada brought some of the highlights in his Spanish travels: some, indeed, of the most enchanting moments in his life. The Alameda was to him one of the most pleasant places in the world, with its foun- tains, its vast flowerbed filled with myrtle, roses and jasmine, its evening procession of young women in mantillas, wearing flowers in their hair and satin shoes on their feet; and ‘ a spectacle which the northern peoples cannot conceive is the Alameda at Granada at simset: the Sierra Nevada takes on unimaginable tones. All the steeps, the summits struck by light, turn roseate: a dazzling rose, ideal, fabulous, glazed with silver, shot with purple and reflections of opal, that would make the clearest colours on the palette seem muddy ; tones of mother-of-pearl, transparencies of ruby, veins of agate and aventurine to defy dl the fairy jewellery of the Arabian Nights. The valleys, the crevices, the roughnesses, all the places beyond the reach of the setting sun, are of a blue to vie with the azure of sky and sea, of lapis-lazuli and sapphire; this contrast between the light and shade is prodigious in its effect: the mountain seems to have clad itself in a measureless robe of shot silk, spangled and ribbed with silver; little by little the splendid tones dissolve and melt into violet half-tints, the shadow invades the lower ridges, the hght withdraws towards the summits, and when all the plain has long been in obscurity, the silver diadem of the Sierra still sparkles in the serenity of heaven beneath the kiss of farewell of the sun.’ For the Alhambra itself Gautier conceived a passion; and a Idnd authority allowed him to hve there for four days and four nights which, he said later, were the finest he had known. In the huge, marble- pillared Court of Lions he made his home, with two mattresses, a copper lamp, an earthenware jar and a few bottles of Jerez wine which he left to cool in the fountain. It was in this fountain that the thirty-six members of the Abencerrage family had been decapitated by their rivals, and tradition said that the red stains at tlie bottom were not rust. Apprehensively he watched the moonbeams on the water; and once he woke abruptly from his sleep, and reflected: \"The hour will come THEOPHILE GAUTIER 46 when you will be lying down as you are now^ and you will rise no more.’ One can understand that he found the real charm of the Gcneralife in its gardens and their fountains. And in the midst of one of these fountains bloomed an immense oleander of incomparable brilliance^ 'like an explosion of flowers^ the bouquet of a floral firework; with a splendid and vigorous freshness, almost clamorous, if the word may be used of colours, enough to make the reddest rose seem pale. Its fine flowers burst with all the ardour of desire towards the pure light of heaven; its noble leaves, formed ex- pressly by nature to crown the glorious, washed by the drizzle of the water-jets, sparkled hke emeralds in the sun. Nothing has ever given me a more lively feeling of beauty.’ Dans le Gemralife:, il est un laurier-rose^ Gai comme la victoire^ heureux comme F amour.

J^ai cm sentir la fleur me rendre mon baiser . . ifi 5}C Invigorated by such beauty, by his Spanish happiness, Gautier climbed the MuUiacen, wrote a poem near the summit, and set off for Malaga, where the new arena was to be inaugurated and Months de Chiclana, the most brilliant of matadors, was himself to perform. To leave Spain without seeing Montes was as uncivilized as to leave Paris without seeing Rachel; and on a torrid day when an excited rumour hung about the town like a haze of sound, he made his way through the narrow streets of Malaga. 'Oh singers with golden voices, dancers with fairy feet, actors of every kind, emperors and poets, you who imagine you have roused entliusiasm, you have not heard them applauding GISELLE AND LA PERI 47 Montes!’ That evening he went to a theatre: they were performing Lope de Vega to a deserted auditorium. It was through Cordova and Seville (whose cathedral seemed to him like a hollow mountain) that Gautier^ with Piot^ made his way home towards France. It was from Cadiz that he sailed round the Spanish coast. It was at Port-Vendres that he set foot again on French soil. Spain had given him inspiration for a book of poems, Espana^ for one of his happiest travel books. Voyage en Espagne\\ he would write them, as he would write so much besides, with a quiU fallen from an eagle one white and azure day on the Sierra Nevada. And if he confessed that 'people who go to Spain to buy curiosities are very disappointed’ he had discovered something as durable as any Toledo sword: Spain was one of his spiritual homes. 'Nor Italy, nor Africa, nor Asia, nor Greece, for all tlieir marvels, ever excited in us the nostalgic regret that makes the cachucha a sort of Ranz des vaches unbearable to hear.’^ 5. Giselle and la Peri 'My dear Henri Heine, ‘A week or two ago, as I was turning over the pages of your fine book r Allemagne^ I came across a charming passage — one only needs to open the book to do so — it’s the part where you speak of the elves in white tunics whose hem is ever damp, of the water sprites who show their tiny satin feet on the ceiHng of the bridal chamber, of wilis the colour of snow, with their unrelenting waltz, and of aU those dehghtful apparitions you have met in the Hartz and on the shore of the Use, in the velvet mist of a Teutonic moonlight; and I could not help exclaiming: \"What a ballet it would make ” In a fit of enthusiasm, I even picked up a large sheet of white paper and wrote at the top, in an admirable, careful hand: LES WILIS, ballet. Then I began to laugh and threw the paper away without more ado, telling myself that this vaporous, nocturnal poetry, this voluptuously sinister phantasmagoria, all these legends and ballads so foreign to our customs, could not possibly be translated into theatre. That evening, at the end of a corridor at the Opera, while my head was still bursting with your idea, I met the gifted man who brought into ballet all the fantasy and caprice of le Diahle amoureux (and much of his own, besides) : all the fantasy and caprice of Cazotte, the great poet who discovered Hoffmann in the middle of the eighteenth century, THEOPHILE GAUTIER 48 in mid Encyclopaedia. I told him the legend of the wilis. Three days later the ballet Giselle was written and accepted. At the end of the week;, Adolphe Adam had composed the music, the scenery was almost finished, and rehearsals were in full swing.’^ Giselle was first performed at the Opera on 28 June 1841, and the public, ‘who still regretted Taglioni and still counted on the return of Elssler, la sylphide and la cachucha incarnate, were consoled in an evening and no longer envied St. Petersburg or America. A dancer had been revealed’. Carlotta Grisi had already appeared in la Favorite and ZingarOy but she was indeed revealed to the world this night, in the ballet that Theophile Gautier had written; and through his lorgnette, this summer evening, he watched the first performance of the most popular of all his works, the greatest triumph of the ‘blonde Italian with forget-me-not eyes’, of Carlotta, whose feet ‘would be the despair of an Andalusian majoy who could wear Cinderella’s slippers over her ballet shoes. Her legs are slender, elegant, responsive, the legs of Diana the huntress, they would follow the anxious deer with, case through the thickets . . . We could give no better idea of her complexion than by comparing it with the softest rice-paper from China or the inner petals of a camellia just in flower. . . .’ Gautier’s adoration for Carlotta is evident from this moment. His original tepid interest has turned to passionate admiration: ‘When from time to time the tip of her little white foot skims the ground,’ he wrote of her Beatrix in lajolie Fille dc Gandy ‘ you know that it is entirely out of kindness, not to cause too much despair to those who have no wings Never did pearl more divine fall from the necklace of heaven upon the common carth.’^ He noticed every detail of her appearance: her tunic starred with silver, when she appeared as Diana, the crescent of jewels in her hair, the quiver slung from her shoulder. Whether she were convalescing from cholera or posing for a statuette, whether she were touring the provinces or touring abroad, he cast his rain of flowers at her feet. Countless appreciations and asides scattered throughout his criticism reflect the love tliat shines from his ballets and his poems, from Spirite and from his letters: the love that, as he told her, a quarter of a century after Giselle had been born, was ‘the true, the only love of my heart’. And when, in so many of his works to come, he wrote of a passion ideal, impossible, the love of a statue, a spirit, a woman far removed in place and time, the Romantic love of the unattainable, it was not only the Romantic love of Mademoiselle de Maupin: it seemed a reflection, GISELLE AND LA P&RI 49 now^ of his own predicament. Carlotta had married Jules Perrot^ her master and partner: it was for her a marriage of pure convenience. But when in time she chose a lover^ bore his child, accepted his villa on the shores of Lake Geneva, she chose a Polish nobleman. Prince Radziwill. To Gautier she was the statue that never came to lifej and she rewarded her Pygmahon for his devotion, for ballets, poems, novel, for creating her career, with that bitter consolation : lasting aifection. 'I sometimes spoke, quite alone, under the chestnut trees, with the Lady of the Violet Eyes,’ wrote one who had known her, at the end of the century, when Carlotta Grisi had died.^ ‘We spoke of the master in whom she had inspired a love so profound that it dominates his work and drew his last sigh from him. We talked of him in low voices, as if in a ruined chapel, and she was flattered that she had been the object of liis passion, but less flattered than astonished. . . . No one, indeed, had a less romantic soul than Giselle, tlie Wih of the Hartz imagined by two poets and reahzed by a httle Balzacian bourgeoise of the Maison du Chat-qui-pelote. What touched her most was the memory of the works he had written, not about her, but for her, the works that had brought her the finest triumphs of her career. For the rest, she was only coy and modest about an over-zealous friend who had mistaken his altar. . . . And I saw how unrehable it is, the axiom that all women are aware of the love that they inspire.’ * * * One night in January 1842, at the Porte- Saint-Martin, Theophile Gautier, greatly astonished and slightly apprehensive, saw, on stage, a vaudeville vision of the twentieth century. ‘ On all sides the houses rise in Babylonian magnificence ... At night the beacons of sideral gas shed a blue light throughout the town, a light as briUiant as that of the sun . . . There are women lawyers, women artists, women writers . . . Steam tilburies are passing in all directions ... A trumpet sounds, the omnibus for China’s about to leave . . .’^ And then, in the way of the world, something that might have seemed equally impossible to the partisan of Hernani^ the author of Mademoiselle de Maupin and Fortunioy hap- pened in real life to Theophile Gautier. The previous year he had been appointed secretary to the commission for Napoleon’s monument: a commission which included Ingres, David, and an imposing array of officials from the Beaux- Arts.® Now, on 16 January, over his signature, the commission published its report. On 17 January ‘M. Theophile Gautier, homme de lettres\\ became Chevalier de la Legion d’honneur.® It was the beginning of respectability: the beginning, it seemed, of a shghtly more conventional career. And yet (one records the story with a certain pleasure) it was far from marking complete reform. It is said D THEOPHILE GAUTIER 50 that when the official called to pin on the decoration, he found M. Theophile Gautier, homme de lettres:, swathed in gay but amorphous drapery (perhaps his old Egyptian costume) with no lapels. Constantly, in his dress, in his work, and in his travels, Gautier escaped from nineteenth-century Pans. One morning this March, having spent the night at a fancy-dress ball^ he tore off his caftan and daggers (so he tells us) and determined to cure his hangover by a visit, his first visit, to London. It might be more accurate to say that he departed to help stage Giselle for Carlotta at Her Majesty’s Theatre. He crossed from Boulogne on the Harlequin; after two or tliree hours, 'a white line rose from the sea like a cloud: the coast of Albion, on which the vaudeville-writers have written so many couplets’. The Harlequin puffed past the well-groomed Kentish landscape into the Thames Estuary, where the cosmopolitan multitude of sunlit boats, crossing and passing ‘with orderly confusion’, appeared ^the most prodigious spectacle that human eye could see’. The East India Docks were, Gautier thought, ‘ enormous, gigantic, fabulous, exceeding human proportions’, the forest of rigging would have shamed the virgin forests of America, and by the time he disembarked he had decided that water was the Englishman’s native home. Next morning he set off to explore the city: observing the soot-dark statues, the Duke of York like a negro on his pillar, George III, an equestrian chimney-sweep. He noticed ‘gin-temples,’ drunken beggars sadder than Goya’s Caprices^ the sentimental pictures and pungent caricatures of royalty in the printsellers’ windows, the hoardings in Trafalgar Square where Nelson’s Column would rise. He admired the policemen with batons and numbered top-hats, he studied the birds on the lake in St. James’s Park, he noted his impressions of Her Majesty’s Theatre, sharp, bright, naive as a Victorian print. The audience seemed like illustrations in keepsakes : ‘ Here indeed arc the long-lashed eyes, their gaze sunk in the distance, the spirals of fair hair caressing the white shoulders, and the white breasts generously dis- played.’ And then, for the first time in London, the curtain rose on Giselle^ ‘the ballet which [remembered The Times'\\ created such a sensation at Paris . . . Carlotta Grisi is the heroine, and very beautifully does she give the character of Giselle . . . Poor Perrot had hurt his leg, and posted notices to that effect about the theatre, but he sprang about with his usual rapidity as the Duke, and his apology seemed altogether super- fluous.’^ So, too, thought the new manager of Her Majesty’s Theatre, Mr. Benjamin Lumley: ‘The charming ballet with the truly GISELLE AND LA P£RI 51 captivating music of Adolphe Adam^ was admitted [he recalled] to be vastly pretty. The production may be regarded as the main element of attraction on the opening of my first season.’® Gautier returned to France with the confirmation of his greatest theatrical success. He took away^ too^ a lively first impression of Lon- don that was not to be altered on his later visits. He might indulge in the expected quips about weather, food and clothes, yet 'despite these criticisms of detail, the general appearance of London has something that astonishes and almost stupefies. London [he wrote] is very certainly a capital in the sense in which civilization understands the word’. * * * The new year, 1843, opened with Rachel’s first performance in the part that was to be her supreme achievement. Even Gautier, with his Romantic disapproval of Racine, was spellbound by her classical beauty, her passionate Greek interpretation of Phedre. The year was indeed to be memorable in the theatre: in March came the ponderous, un- manageable Hugohan drama which spelt the failure of the Romantic theatre. But if Romantic drama had ended in laughter (in les Hures at the Palais-Royal and les Buses graves at the Varietes), Gautier’s own dramatic ventures were flourishing. January brought the announcement of a new ballet 'attributed to an author for whom we have the greatest respect, an author whom we would not venture to criticize in tire least, as he happens to be none other than ourselves. According to well- informed people, the subject of this choreographical work is taken from Oriental legend’.® In an open letter to Gerard de Nerval, the greatly respected author was more exphcit: 'I should so have liked to join you in Cairo, as I’d promised, but as I couldn’t follow you. I’ve made my own Orient at the Academie royale de musique et de danse ... I am a Turk, myself, not from Constanti- nople but from Egypt. It seems to me that I’ve lived in the East; and when I disguise myself in the carnival with a caftan and a tarbouch I feel I am wearing my real clothes again. I have always been surprised not to understand Arabic fluently. I must have forgotten it. 'It was with this Oriental preoccupation, one grey, rainy day when the wind was keen, that I began something like a little Turkish or Persian poem ; and I had already written twenty lines, when the judicious idea fell from heaven that if I wrote any more, no one would ever read them. Poetry is the language of the gods, and gods alone read it, to the great despair of publishers. So I threw the stanzas into the waste- paper basket, and, taking a sheet of paper, I entrusted my subject to 52 TH^OPHILE GAUTIER the feet which;, out of four lines of HeinC;, created the last act of Giselle. The result was la Peri. It was first performed at the Opera on 17 July 1843, witla 'immense success’. 'We should be very tempted to attack the critic of la Presse for abandoning the literary tourney to limit himself to ballets [said la France litteraire]. But how could we not for- give the author of Giselle and la Peri? This new ballet touches per- fection.’ La Peri is a development of d’ Albert’s quest for ideal beauty in Mademoiselle de Maupin. It also strangely anticipates Spirire^ the novel that Gautier would write twenty-two years later: it has the same theme of the love of mortal and spirit. And in the ballet as in the novels one seems to see the author himself : the youth who has exhausted temporal pleasures and^ 'like all great voluptuaries^ fallen in love with the impossible’. But all symbolism was forgotten in Carlotta’s dancing; however charming the Oriental peris might be with their gold-striped trousers and jewelled bodices^ their parrots’ wings^ their black-tinted eyelids and scarlet hands^ they could hardly, Gautier considered, be lovelier than she. And when she floated from the cloud-tops into her lover’s arms, as light as a dove’s feather: 'What marvellous dancing! You would think her a rose-leaf borne on the wind.’ Nine columns he filled with adulation : ' If my name were not on the posters,’ he ended simply, 'what praises I should sing of this enchanting Carlottal’ * 5l< And within a few weeks came another dramatic success, Un Voyage en Espagncy a three-act vaudeville by Theophilc Gautier and Paul Siraudin, was first performed at the Varietes on 21 September. This crazy series of abortive love-affairs, arrests, capture by brigands and involvement in the Carhst Wars scored a notable success. 'My dear Thdophile [wrote Roqueplan, director of the Varietcis], you have allowed all your fancies to disport themselves, and the people who constantly ask for novelty ought to show me some gratitude for recruit- ing you as a writer of vaudevilles.’^^ Un Voyage en Espagne brought Gautier more than a tribute from Roqueplan: it brought him the favours of one of the most endearing courtesans of the time: Julie- Justine Pilloy, better known as Alice Ozy. She had a small part in the vaudeville and was much afraid that it would be taken from her. Someone advised her to sec Gautier, and Gautier invited her to dinner. It was that evening (so it is said)^^^ that she inspired the quatrain: GISELLE AND LA PERI 53 Penteliqtie^ Paros^ marbres tieigeux de Grece^ Dont Praxitele a fait la chair de ses Venus ^ Vos blancheurs suffisaient d des corps de deesse, NoircisseZ:, car Alice a montre ses seins nusP^ Henceforward it was Alice who sat in the critic’s box when she was not admired on the stage. It was AJicCj some ten years later, who reserved the privilege of taking his arm and pricked the jealousy of Marie Mattei ; it was Alice who wrote to Gautier: ‘ Give me a part at the Vaudeville, and I will refuse you notiiing.’ Their relationship, more or less amorous, lasted tlie rest of his d^ys. Yet Aiice Ozy remained of comparative insignificance in Gautier’s life. ‘ The invention of Apollo surrounded by the nine Muses is a symbol realized by every poet today, married or not,’ wrote Arsene Houssaye, with a certain justice. 'While Mme de Lamartine paints water-colours, Lamartine might count up the belles mondames among his followers. Victor Hugo has just been noticed with his third Muse. Alfred de Musset is in love with a princess, a woman of the world and a female novelist, not to mention Mme A 4 imi Pinson . . . Theophile Gautier is in love with the three Grisis.’^^ Gautier’s admiration of the beauty of Julia Grisi shines from the Preface of Mademoiselle de Maupin and the lines of la Diva. Gautier’s adoration of Carlotta, the presiding, unattainable divinity, is evident in his writing from Giselle to Spirite^ in a multitude of letters, in reviews ; in the record, in later years, of his constant pilgrimages to the Villa Grisi-sur-Saint-Jean. But it was neither la Diva nor Giselle who was to dominate his daily existence for the next twenty years : it was the sister of Giselle, Emesta Grisi. Her fine Italian profile remains on a medallion ; sallow and large-eyed, seductive, a blossom-wreath on her dark hair, she watches posterity from Riesener’s portrait. Was it her likeness to Carlotta that first drew Gautier? Was it her passionate contralto as she sang at the Theatre- Italien? Was Gautier drawn to her purely by physical attraction? All these reasons may help to explain why, by 1844,^® he had become the lover of this fiery singer : of this capable housewife who took him in her charge as his mother had taken charge of a spoilt child. But probably the strongest influence was Ernesta’s comforti"
