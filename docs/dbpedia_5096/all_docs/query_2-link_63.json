        "text": "Death, what hast thou to do with me? So saith\n\nLove, with eyes set against the face of Death;\n\nWhat have I done, O thou strong Death, to thee,\n\nThat mine own lips should wither from thy breath?\n\nThough thou be blind as fire or as the sea,\n\nWhy should thy waves and storms make war on me?\n\nIs it for hate thou hast to find me fair,\n\nOr for desire to kiss, if it might be,\n\nMy very mouth of song, and kill me there?\n\nSo with keen rains vexing his crownless hair,\n\nWith bright feet bruised from no delightful way,\n\nThrough darkness and the disenchanted air,\n\n​\n\nLost Love went weeping half a winter's day.\n\nAnd the armed wind that smote him seemed to say,\n\nHow shall the dew live when the dawn is fled,\n\nOr wherefore should the Mayflower outlast May?\n\nThen Death took Love by the right hand and said,\n\nSmiling: Come now and look upon thy dead.\n\nBut Love cast down the glories of his eyes,\n\nAnd bowed down like a flower his flowerless head.\n\nAnd Death spake, saying: What ails thee in such wise,\n\nBeing god, to shut thy sight up from the skies?\n\nIf thou canst see not, hast thou ears to hear?\n\nOr is thy soul too as a leaf that dies?\n\nEven as he spake with fleshless lips of fear,\n\nBut soft as sleep sings in a tired man's ear,\n\nBehold, the winter was not, and its might\n\nFell, and fruits broke forth of the barren year.\n\n​\n\nAnd upon earth was largess of great light,\n\nAnd moving music winged for worldwide flight,\n\nAnd shapes and sounds of gods beheld and heard,\n\nAnd day's foot set upon the neck of night.\n\nAnd with such song the hollow ways were stirred\n\nAs of a god's heart hidden in a bird,\n\nOr as the whole soul of the sun in spring\n\nShould find full utterance in one flower-soft word,\n\nAnd all the season should break forth and sing\n\nFrom one flower's lips, in one rose triumphing;\n\nSuch breath and light of song as of a flame\n\nMade ears and spirits of them that heard it ring.\n\nAnd Love beholding knew not for the same\n\nThe shape that led him, nor in face nor name,\n\nFor he was bright and great of thews and fair,\n\nAnd in Love's eyes he was not Death, but Fame.\n\n​\n\nNot that grey ghost whose life is empty and bare\n\nAnd his limbs moulded out of mortal air,\n\nA cloud of change that shifts into a shower\n\nAnd dies and leaves no light for time to wear:\n\nBut a god clothed with his own joy and power,\n\nA god re-risen out of his mortal hour\n\nImmortal, king and lord of time and space,\n\nWith eyes that look on them as from a tower.\n\nAnd where he stood the pale sepulchral place\n\nBloomed, as new life might in a bloodless face,\n\nAnd where men sorrowing came to seek a tomb\n\nWith funeral flowers and tears for grief and grace,\n\nThey saw with light as of a world in bloom\n\nThe portal of the House of Fame illume\n\nThe ways of life wherein we toiling tread,\n\nAnd watched the darkness as a brand consume.\n\n​\n\nAnd through the gates where rule the deathless dead\n\nThe sound of a new singer's soul was shed\n\nThat sang among his kinsfolk, and a beam\n\nShot from the star on a new ruler's head.\n\nA new star lighting the Lethean stream,\n\nA new song mixed into the song supreme\n\nMade of all souls of singers and their might,\n\nThat makes of life and time and death a dream.\n\nThy star, thy song, O soul that in our sight\n\nWast as a sun that made for man's delight\n\nFlowers and all fruits in season, being so near\n\nThe sun-god's face, our god that gives us light.\n\nTo him of all gods that we love or fear\n\nThou amongst all men by thy name wast dear,\n\nDear to the god that gives us spirit of song\n\nTo bind and burn all hearts of men that hear.\n\n​\n\nThe god that makes men's words too sweet and strong\n\nFor life or time or death to do them wrong,\n\nWho sealed with his thy spirit for a sign\n\nAnd filled it with his breath thy whole life long.\n\nWho made thy moist lips fiery with new wine\n\nPressed from the grapes of song, the sovereign vine,\n\nAnd with all love of all things loveliest\n\nGave thy soul power to make them more divine.\n\nThat thou might'st breathe upon the breathless rest\n\nOf marble, till the brows and lips and breast\n\nFelt fall from off them as a cancelled curse\n\nThat speechless sleep wherewith they lived opprest.\n\nWho gave thee strength and heat of spirit to pierce\n\nAll clouds of form and colour that disperse,\n\nAnd leave the spirit of beauty to remould\n\nIn types of clean chryselephantine verse.\n\n​\n\nWho gave thee words more golden than fine gold\n\nTo carve in shapes more glorious than of old,\n\nAnd build thy songs up in the sight of time\n\nAs statues set in godhead manifold:\n\nIn sight and scorn of temporal change and clime\n\nThat meet the sun re-risen with refluent rhyme\n\n—As god to god might answer face to face—\n\nFrom lips whereon the morning strikes sublime.\n\nDear to the god, our god who gave thee place\n\nAmong the chosen of days, the royal race,\n\nThe lords of light, whose eyes of old and ears\n\nSaw even on earth and heard him for a space.\n\nThere are the souls of those once mortal years\n\nThat wrought with fire of joy and light of tears\n\nIn words divine as deeds that grew thereof\n\nSuch music as he swoons with love who hears.\n\n​\n\nThere are the lives that lighten from above\n\nOur under lives, the spheral souls that move\n\nThrough the ancient heaven of song-illumined air\n\nWhence we that hear them singing die with love.\n\nThere all the crowned Hellenic heads, and there\n\nThe old gods who made men godlike as they were,\n\nThe lyric lips wherefrom all songs take fire,\n\nLive eyes, and light of Apollonian hair.\n\nThere, round the sovereign passion of that lyre\n\nWhich the stars hear and tremble with desire,\n\nThe ninefold light Pierian is made one\n\nThat here we see divided, and aspire,\n\nSeeing, after this or that crown to be won;\n\nBut where they hear the singing of the sun,\n\nAll form, all sound, all colour, and all thought\n\nAre as one body and soul in unison.\n\n​\n\nThere the song sung shines as a picture wrought,\n\nThe painted mouths sing that on earth say nought,\n\nThe carven limbs have sense of blood and growth\n\nAnd large-eyed life that seeks nor lacks not aught.\n\nThere all the music of thy living mouth\n\nLives, and all loves wrought of thine hand in youth\n\nAnd bound about the breasts and brows with gold\n\nAnd coloured pale or dusk from north or south.\n\nFair living things made to thy will of old,\n\nBorn of thy lips, no births of mortal mould,\n\nThat in the world of song about thee wait\n\nWhere thought and truth are one and manifold.\n\nWithin the graven lintels of the gate\n\nThat here divides our vision and our fate,\n\nThe dreams we walk in and the truths of sleep,\n\nAll sense and spirit have life inseparate.\n\n​\n\nThere what one thinks, is his to grasp and keep;\n\nThere are no dreams, but very joys to reap,\n\nNo foiled desires that die before delight,\n\nNo fears to see across our joys and weep.\n\nThere hast thou all thy will of thought and sight,\n\nAll hope for harvest, and all heaven for flight;\n\nThe sunrise of whose golden-mouthed glad head\n\nTo paler songless ghosts was heat and light.\n\nHere where the sunset of our year is red\n\nMen think of thee as of the summer dead,\n\nGone forth before the snows, before thy day,\n\nWith unshod feet, with brows unchapleted.\n\nCouldst thou not wait till age had wound, they say,\n\nRound those wreathed brows his soft white blossoms? Nay,\n\nWhy shouldst thou vex thy soul with this harsh air,\n\nThy bright-winged soul, once free to take its way?\n\n​\n\nNor for men's reverence hadst thou need to wear\n\nThe holy flower of grey time-hallowed hair;\n\nNor were it fit that aught of thee grew old,\n\nFair lover all thy days of all things fair.\n\nAnd hear we not thy words of molten gold\n\nSinging? or is their light and heat acold\n\nWhereat men warmed their spirits? Nay, for all\n\nThese yet are with us, ours to hear and hold.\n\nThe lovely laughter, the clear tears, the call\n\nOf love to love on ways where shadows fall,\n\nThrough doors of dim division and disguise,\n\nAnd music made of doubts unmusical;\n\nThe love that caught strange light from death's own eyes,[1]\n\nAnd filled death's lips with fiery words and sighs,\n\nAnd half asleep let feed from veins of his\n\nHer close red warm snake's mouth, Egyptian-wise:\n\n​\n\nAnd that great night of love more strange than this,[2]\n\nWhen she that made the whole world's bale and bliss\n\nMade king of all the world's desire a slave,\n\nAnd killed him in mid kingdom with a kiss;\n\nVeiled loves that shifted shapes and shafts, and gave,[3]\n\nLaughing, strange gifts to hands that durst not crave,\n\nFlowers double-blossomed, fruits of scent and hue\n\nSweet as the bride-bed, stranger than the grave;\n\nAll joys and wonders of old lives and new\n\nThat ever in love's shine or shadow grew,\n\nAnd all the grief whereof he dreams and grieves,\n\nAnd all sweet roots fed on his light and dew;\n\nAll these through thee our spirit of sense perceives,\n\nAs threads in the unseen woof thy music weaves,\n\nBirds caught and snared that fill our ears with thee,\n\nBay-blossoms in thy wreath of brow-bound leaves.\n\n​\n\nMixed with the masque of death's old comedy\n\nThough thou too pass, have here our flowers, that we\n\nFor all the flowers thou gav'st upon thee shed,\n\nAnd pass not crownless to Persephone.\n\nBlue lotus-blooms and white and rosy-red\n\nWe wind with poppies for thy silent head,\n\nAnd on this margin of the sundering sea\n\nLeave thy sweet light to rise upon the dead."
