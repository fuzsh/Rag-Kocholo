        "text": "Although Gautier's importance as a music critic is finally being recognised (see pioneering work by Andrew Gann) it has still received little attention by musicologists, whose focus has been more on his ballet criticism or his many literary collaborations with music and dance. Perhaps the extraordinary range and versatility of his artistic talents–poet, novelist, and travel writer, art, music and ballet critic–has caused scholars to regard his music criticism as superficial. Yet he was highly respected as a music critic for over 25 years and wrote hundreds of reviews, the majority of which have been little examined since the day they appeared. . The concept of the transposition d'art has often been used in discussions of romantic criticism of the arts, in which the criticism is a metaphorisation of the musical or artistic work. Gautier was passionately interested in the creative possibilities of a fusion of the arts (see in particular works such as his \"Variations sur le Carnaval de Venise\") and in his criticism he delights in viewing one art through the prism of another, whether it be describing architecture as music or music as a poetic narrative. Sainte-Beuve saw Gautier's novel Capitaine Fracasse as a series of transposed paintings and Maxime du Camp, using a fairly unusual understanding of the word “art”, even argued that the intensity of Gautier's lived experience in his travel writing could be called a transposition d'art. In his travel writings Gautier discusses chiefly folk song, street and cafe music. This article explores his use of language in his descriptions of this music, focusing in particular on Spain, and assess the extent to which it differs from his music criticism, and some of his short stories, (for instance Militona) from the same period. I shall also address the rhetorical question posed by Gautier himself in one of his reviews in La Presse, \"L'Orient de l'Opéra, L'Espagne de convention, sont-ils supérieurs à l'Orient et l'Espagne réels?\" (La Presse, 25 May, 1852)."
