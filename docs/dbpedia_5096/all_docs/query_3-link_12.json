        "text": "Pierre Jules Théophile Gautier, a French poet, novelist, and critic, was born in Tarbes, Hautes-Pyrénées, on August 30, 1811, to Jean-Pierre Gautier, a government official, and Antoinette Adelaide Cocard. At a very early age, his family moved to Paris, where the unsettled Gautier took up reading, fascinated by the story of Robinson Crusoe. He briefly attended the Collège Louis-le-Grand before joining the Collège Charlemagne, where he met Gérard de Nerval, and they became lifelong friends.\n\nNerval, who later became one of the most significant figures in the French Romantic movement, introduced his friend to Victor Hugo. Hugo was already an established dramatist and became a major influence on the young Gautier, prompting him to pursue a career in writing. Gautier describes his experiences from that period and the debates surrounding Hugo’s controversial drama, Hernani, in Les Jeunes-France (1833), a satire on Romanticism.\n\nHe began his writing career as a poet when his father financed the publication of his first collection of verses in 1830. The work remained largely unnoticed but demonstrated his originality and a gift for a precise and clear form of expression.\n\nIn 1835, Gautier published Mademoiselle de Maupin, an epistolary novel that caused quite a stir in French society by challenging the notions of virtue and immorality in literature. The work describes the adventures of Mademoiselle de Maupin, a young lady who disguises herself as a man to learn the secrets of men she wishes to get involved with, causing both men and women to fall for her in the process. In the same year, Gautier published La Cafetière, a novella where the characters from a painted wallpaper come to life and interact with Théodore, the narrator. The supernatural theme is also present in two more of the author’s works, Avatar (1857) and Le Roman de la momie (1856), a love story in Ancient Egypt.\n\nGautier spent the following year working on novellas and art critiques, some of which were published in Honoré de Balzac’s literary magazine La Chronique de Paris (1836) and the rest in the popular daily newspaper La Presse (1836). He also published a poetry collection, La Comédie de la Mort (1838), heavily influenced by the works of Goethe, Shakespeare and Dante and a theatrical play, Une Larme du Diable (1839).\n\nDuring the next three decades, Gautier travelled extensively through Europe and Africa. He sent his impressions from a visit to the Pyrenees with photographer Eugène Piot to La Presse before travelling through Spain and publishing Le Voyage en Espagne (1843) and the poetry collection España (1845). He also visited Algeria (1845), London (1846), Italy (1850), Greece and Turkey (1852), Russia (1859), Switzerland, and Egypt (1869), where he attended the inauguration of the Suez Canal as a representative for the Journal Officiel de la République Française. Although he only published impressions on Italy (incomplete, 1852), Constantinople (1853), Switzerland (1865), and Russia (1867), Gautier’s travel experiences provided inspiration for many of his works.\n\nIn the 1840s, Gautier fell in love with ballerina Carlotta Grisi, for whom he wrote the librettos for the romantic ballet Giselle (1841) and La Péri (1843). Unable to win Carlotta’s heart, he married her sister Ernesta, a singer, in 1844 and had two daughters, Judith and Estelle.\n\nAs the prominent authors of the Romantic movement, including Victor Hugo, François-René de Chateaubriand, and Alfred de Vigny, became less active, Gautier’s influence in the literary world increased. He became the director of La Revue de Paris between 1851 and 1856 and editor of the influential review L’Artiste in 1856. Six years later, he became the chair of the Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts, contemporary to artists such as Eugène Delacroix, Édouard Manet, and Gustave Doré, but his attempt to earn membership in the Académie Française failed on four occasions (1856, 1867-9).\n\nGautier’s family moved to the outskirts of Paris in 1857 and settled in a small house at Neuilly-sur-Seine, where he regularly entertained Baudelaire, Alexandre Dumas fils, Gustave Flaubert, Puvis de Chavannes and other prominent French writers and artists. He briefly returned to Paris in 1870 during the Franco-Prussian War and remained there through the Commune (a revolutionary government that seized power between March and May 1871).\n\nIn a career that spanned over forty years, Gautier is considered not only a proponent of Romanticism but also one of the most influential art and literary critics of the 19th century. His unique and reflective style redefined art and literary criticism and contributed to the development of objective criteria for theatrical criticism. Prominent among his works as a critic are Les Beaus-Arts en Europe (1855), L’Art Moderne (1856), a biography of Honoré de Balzac (1858), Rapport sur les progrès de la poésie (1868) and the review of several works by classical and opera composers such as Mozart, Beethoven, Donizetti, Rossini, Gounot, Chopin, and Wagner, all of which are included in the collection La Musique (1911).\n\nGautier died of a heart attack on October 23, 1872."
