LOS ANGELES (AP) — Walt Disney Co. is buying the childrens cable service Fox Family Worldwide Inc. for $3 billion in cash plus the assumption of $2.3 billion in debt.

The deal announced Monday adds another major cable outlet to Disneys portfolio, which already includes ESPN, A&E, the Disney Channel and Lifetime. The Fox Family Channel, which Disney plans to rename ABC Family, reaches about 81 million cable subscribers in the United States.

Disney bought Fox Family from News Corp. and Saban Entertainment Inc., which each owned 49.5 percent of the company. Saban, a major childrens programmer that created the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, had exercised its right to have News Corp. buy out its share.

For News Corp., the deal provides welcome cash just as the company is hoping to reach an agreement with General Motors Corp. on a purchase of DirecTV, a division of GMs Hughes Electronics unit.

The deal expands Disneys programming reach worldwide with a 76 percent ownership in Fox Kids Europe, a childrens programming channel that reaches 24 million homes, and a 10-million-subscriber channel in Latin America called Fox Kids.

This is a perfect fit for our company, Disney chief executive officer Michael Eisner said in a conference call. We paid appropriately for a great asset, which drives us to the No. 1 position in basic cable subscribers and gives us a greater presence and growth opportunity internationally.

Disney is also getting Sabans programming library, which contains more than 6,500 episodes of shows.

It is the first major acquisition by Disney since it bought Capital Cities/ABC in 1996. Disney officials said the deal should increase advertising revenue for its media networks division by 50 percent within two years from the 2001 level of approximately $200 million. ABC, ESPN and other networks have suffered from an advertising slump in recent months because of the slowing economy.

Disney will use the new ABC Family channel to distribute programming content from other parts of Disneys entertainment warehouse, including ABC and Disney-owned TV shows. The channel will also continue to show the 700 Club and other shows made by Pat Robertsons Christian Broadcasting Network, which originally started the cable outlet called CBN and later the Family Channel before becoming Fox Family.

Ive talked to Pat Robertson and we happen to think he is an asset to the channel, Eisner said. He produces a quality program and we will build a schedule with a commitment to him.
