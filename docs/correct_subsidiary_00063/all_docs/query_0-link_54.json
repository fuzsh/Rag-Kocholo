        "text": "I very much doubt it would be rebranded with ABC prefix. As Kev said ABC doesn't mean much to many in the UK.\n\nDisney branded them with the ABC prefix in the US because Disney own ABC Network and in the TV world it's a stronger brand than Disney due to the following reason.\n\nDisney is often seen as a pre-school warm and snuggley cartoons network. Although we know they make a lot of other programs/movies they will always be remembered for Winnie the Pooh and of course the giant mouse! So the Disney name is not a good one to associate with the type of programming on Fox Kids which is aimed at making the pre-teens think they're cool.\n\nI doubt fox can take their name back from the european FoxKids networks as when you sell a company or subsidery you sell the name too. Like Virgin radio.\n\n0\n\nAlso, there used to be an ITV company over here called ABC, which used to broadcast in the North and Midlands of England each weekend from 1956-68. In 1968, Granada and ATV ran the North and Midlands franchise seven days a week, while the television operations of ABC joined up with Rediffusion London to form Thames Television, who, of course, ran the London Weekday franchise until 1992, when they were famously shafted, in favour of Carlton.\n\nSo, I dont think you could call it \"ABC\", for historical reasons.\n\n0\n\nOriginally posted by kev\n\nABC doesn't mean anything over here in TV terms does it?Perhaps it will carry the Disney name, or some other Disney brand....\n\nI doubt they will use the Disney brand as they don't want to associate it with the non-Disney programming on FOX Kids - eventhough Disney own both Sabian (production company) and FOX Kids.\n\nThe question is; can they keep the FOX name forever when they're no-longer part of FOX / News Corp.?\n\n0\n\nOriginally posted by astra19E\n\nI thought that SKY just last year completely took over FOX Kids???\n\nEr.. no? What gave you that idea?\n\nFox Kids (worldwide) was purchased by Disney last year. In America, Fox Kids and Fox Family Channel were rolled into a channel called 'ABC Family'. (Disney owns ABC too.) while the kids programming on the Fox network was renamed \"Fox Box\" and subcontracted to (I think ) 4kids, the anglicisers of Pokemon. Worldwide, I think Disney have got a couple of years to stop using the Fox name - one way or another.\n\n0"
