[there] was so supposed to be someone there,\" Bongino said on Donald Trump Jr.’s podcast “Triggered” on Tuesday from the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee.\n\n\"They're now making up excuses saying the pitch of the roof. My source says to me that no one knows why the post didn't show up.\"\n\n\"I was also told that the USSS director has been given instructions from the administration and the DHS secretary: 'If you wanna keep your job, you'll keep your mouth shut about this.'\"\n\nBongino told Trump Jr. that a person not showing up for their respective post “could have gotten your dad killed, within millimeters.”\n\nThe former president was shot in his upper right ear and a rallygoer was killed. Crooks was killed during a gunfire exchange.\n\nPosted by Scott McDonald Share\n\nTrump’s attempted assassin likely didn’t use ladder to scale his way to the roof: report\n\nThomas Matthew Crooks, the 20-year-old who attempted to assassinate former President Trump last Saturday in Pennsylvania, likely didn’t use a recently purchased ladder to climb onto a nearby roof before firing at Trump.\n\nLaw enforcement sources allegedly told ABC News that even though there was a Home Depot receipt for a recently purchased 5-foot ladder found on Crooks, he did not use it to access the roof where he fired shots at Trump and instead climbed an air conditioning unit.\n\nTrump was shot in the ear Saturday during his rally preceding this week’s Republican National Convention. Secret Service agents quickly killed Crooks in retaliation fire.\n\nCrooks accessed the roof of a nearby building and fired from about 150 yards away from Trump. The shot that hit Trump nicked him in the ear, but was just a few inches away from hitting the former president in the front or side of his head.\n\nFox News Digital’s Rebecca Rosenberg and Greg Wehner contributed to this report.\n\nPosted by Scott McDonald Share\n\nSarah Huckabee Sanders says 'not even an assassin's bullet could stop' Trump\n\nArkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who once served as press secretary under former President Trump and is known for her brash ways of dealing with media, looked compassionate while endorsing Trump at the Republican National Convention on Tuesday in Milwaukee.\n\n“I want to say, I have always been proud to stand with President Trump,” the governor said. “But never have I been more proud than to stand with him right here, tonight.”\n\nThe crowd at Fiserv Forum arena gave her a raucous ovation before she acknowledged the assassination attempt on Trump last weekend in Pennsylvania. Trump even smiled with glee during her opening remark.\n\n“Not even an assassin’s bullet could stop him,\" she continued. “God Almighty intervened because America is one nation, under God, and He is certainly not finished with President Trump.”\n\nShe received another standing ovation before saying, “and our country is better for it.”\n\nHuckabee Sanders called working as press secretary under Trump “the best job.” She went on to add other talking points in her brief remarks, like \"the left doesn't care about empowering women. Biden and Harris can't even tell you what a woman is, they only care about empowering themselves.\"\n\nPosted by Scott McDonald Share\n\nMore than $5 million raised for victims, families following Trump assassination attempt\n\nA GoFundMe page to help wounded victims or the family of those killed during the attempted assassination attempt of former President Donald Trump in Butler, Penn., last Saturday has already surpassed $5 million, more than quintupling the desired $1 million goal.\n\n\"President Donald Trump has authorized this account as a place for donations to the supporters and families wounded or killed in today’s brutal and horrific assassination attempt. All donations will be directed to these proud Americans as they grieve and recover. May God bless and unite our nation,\" it reads on the fundraising page.\n\nTrump was shot and wounded in his ear during an outdoor rally on Saturday. Secret Service killed the gunman, 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks. Trump walked away with his injury, but firefighter Corey Comperatore, 50, was killed during the incident.\n\nPosted by Scott McDonald Share\n\nBrother of mother of five rips Biden admin after she was allegedly killed by illegal immigrant\n\nThe family of a mother of five who was allegedly murdered by an illegal immigrant slammed the Biden administration on Tuesday night for having \"opened our borders\" to the man accused of killing her.\n\nMichael Morin, the brother of Rachel Morin, spoke at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Morin was killed in August after going out for a jog on a trail near her home in Maryland. Police found her body in a culvert, covered in bruises and with severe head trauma.\n\n\"Rachel, a joyful, accomplished athlete and mother of five was raped and murdered by a suspected illegal immigrant,\" Michael Morin told the crowd at the Republican National Convention. \"This was described as among the most brutal and violent offenses that has ever occurred in Harford County, Maryland history.\"\n\nVictor Antonio Martinez-Hernandez, 23, faces a half-dozen charges, including first-degree murder, rape, and kidnapping, in connection with Rachel Morin's death. Officials said Martinez Hernandez, who has suspected gang ties, fled his home country in February 2023 after a warrant was issued for the murder of a woman there.\n\nHe made three unsuccessful attempts to enter the United States before making it across the border on Feb. 13, 2023 near El Paso, Texas, authorities said.\n\nRachel’s brother slammed those who advocate for open borders.\n\n\"Open borders are often portrayed as compassionate and virtuous. But there is nothing compassionate about allowing violent criminals into our country and robbing children of their mother,\" he said.\n\nHe then criticized the Biden administration for its policies at the border.\n\n\"Joe Biden and his designated border czar Kamala Harris opened our borders to him and others like him, empowering them to victimize the innocent,\" he said.\n\nFox News' Adam Shaw contributed to this report.\n\nPosted by Landon Mion Share\n\nSen. Rubio honors Trump rally victim Corey Comperatore: 'Best dad a girl could ever ask for'\n\nSen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., spoke at the Republican National Convention on Tuesday in which he addressed Saturday's shooting at former President Trump's campaign rally in Pennsylvania, where a man was killed.\n\nCorey Comperatore, 50, a firefighter at the Buffalo Township Volunteer Fire Company in Pennsylvania, was killed at the rally shielding his wife and daughter from bullets when gunman Thomas Mathew Crooks, 20, opened fire attempting to assassinate Trump, who sustained a wound to his ear.\n\n\"This thing we do called politics, it matters, it's not unimportant, but it is our people who must always matter the most in everything we do,\" Rubio said. \"By giving voice to everyday Americans, President Trump has not just transformed our party, he has inspired a movement.\"\n\n\"[Comperatore] was a former fire chief and a loving husband,\" Rubio continued. \"He was described as the best dad a girl could ever ask for. He was a man of God who loved Jesus fiercely ... Corey was one of the millions of everyday Americans who make our country great.\"\n\nPosted by Landon Mion Share\n\nExclusive Trump rally video shows chaos after gunman opened fire\n\nShocking cellphone video shows chaos at the Butler Farm Saturday after Thomas Matthew Crooks opened fire on a Pennsylvania Trump rally, injuring the former president, killing one spectator and critically wounding two more.\n\nThe video shows ducking spectators flagging authorities for help after the gunfire stops.\n\n\"We've got someone down,\" a man can be heard shouting as he waves his arms. \"Hey!\"\n\nThe camera pans toward the stage, as Trump returns to his feet, flanked by Secret Service agents, and raises a fist.\n\nTodd, the Army veteran who took the video and asked to be identified only as Todd the Driller, said he initially offered to bring his son to the rally but was concerned the crowd might be too boisterous.\n\nHe said he was relieved when the 9-year-old wanted to back out. But then both the boy and his 12-year-old daughter asked for Trump campaign hats, so he wound up attending alone.\n\nTodd arrived early and called his kids on FaceTime from a row of vendors. They chose their hats. He bought them. Then he made his way toward the stage.\n\nThe rally started late, he said, but by the time Trump arrived, he had a good vantage point near the north fence.\n\nHe had been taking pictures and videos to send his son, but when the gunfire erupted, his phone was in his pocket and he was listening to Trump's remarks.\n\n\"I had no idea I was in the lane of fire between the shooter and President Trump, but when I heard the crack-crack-crack, I knew what that was,\" he said. \"It was directly behind me, and bullets whizzed like maybe 20 feet to my left.\"\n\nFox News' Michael Ruiz contributed to this report.\n\nPosted by Landon Mion Share\n\n3D animation shows grounds, surrounding buildings where would-be assassin shot Trump during rally\n\nA 3D animation shows the grounds and surrounding buildings where a would-be assassin shot former President Trump during a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania on Saturday.\n\nDespite sniper teams stationed on the rooftop behind Trump, the would-be assassin -- later identified as Thomas Matthew Crooks -- managed to evade authorities and climb onto the roof of a building on the outer perimeter of the rally grounds, roughly 150 yards from where Trump was speaking.\n\nThe U.S. Secret Service has faced scrutiny in the days following the assassination attempt for not taking out the shooter sooner.\n\nUSSS Director told ABC News Tuesday that personnel were not positioned on top of the building where the Trump rally shooter opened fire because of a \"sloped roof,\" despite images showing snipers set up on a sloped roof behind the former president’s podium.\n\nPosted by Bradford Betz Share\n\nEx-DHS, FBI official demands overhaul of Trump shooting probe after 'colossal security failure’\n\nA former senior Homeland Security official and FBI agent is calling for a bipartisan commission to be formed to investigate the assassination attempt on former President Trump, arguing the public has lost trust in the federal agencies.\n\nMark Morgan most recently served as acting head of Customs and Border Protection under the Trump administration and also had a 20-year career with the FBI, including as a former SWAT operator and tactical instructor, and with the FBI’s critical incident response group.\n\nHe spoke to Fox News Digital Tuesday about the ongoing reviews of Saturday's assassination attempt.\n\n\"Here's the reality that we have to face for those of us who were past and even those that are currently involved in these agencies. … America's trust in the Department of Justice, the FBI, Congress, it has dropped precipitously the past few years.

She said the Secret Service sought assistance from local law enforcement for the outer perimeter where the building on which the would-be assassin fired upon Trump from a roof was located.\n\n“There was local police in that building – there was local police in the area that were responsible for the outer perimeter of the building,” Cheatle said.\n\nThe day after her ABC News interview, the USSS wrote on X that “Any news suggesting the Secret Service is blaming local law enforcement for Saturday’s incident is simply note true.”\n\n“I am having difficulty reconciling the answer the Director gave in her ABC interview with the official statement made on social media,” Yoes said in a statement. “Our goal is to provide whatever assistance the Secret Service needs to perform their mission and to do so with mutual respect, trust, and accuracy.”\n\nPosted by Bradford Betz Share\n\nBreaking News\n\nDHS to investigate Secret Service after Trump assassination attempt\n\nThe inspector general of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has opened an investigation into the U.S. Secret Service’s planning of a Trump rally in Butler, Pennsylvania that took place on Saturday.\n\nJoseph V.

He said it wasn’t his decision to have local law enforcement responsible for the building in question. All those decisions were made, he said, by the U.S. Secret Service.\n\nSecret Service sources have confirmed that local law enforcement officers were stationed inside the AGR building while Crooks was on the roof. During an interview with ABC News Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle said a decision was made not to put officers on the roof it was sloped “at its highest point.”\n\n“And so, you know, there's a safety factor that would be considered there that we wouldn't want to put somebody up on a sloped roof,” Cheatle said.\n\nMultiple law enforcement experts have Fox News that it is ultimately the USSS’ decision whether a particular building is put within the security perimeter.

He also said he is a former protectee.\n\nWith those credentials, Zinke said he could say “without a doubt” that the Select Committee to investigate failures of security and the attempted assassination of Trump “must go forward.”\n\n“While other bodies carry out their inquiries, it is critical for the integrity of the investigation and the trust of the American people that a commission made up of select members of the House, Senate, White House and Supreme Court is empowered with the same – if not more – rights and access to information as the 9/11 Commission,” Zinke wrote. “Many Americans rightfully do not trust the same agency that has been politically investigating and harassing Trump with investigating his near death.”\n\nPosted by Greg Wehner Share\n\nComer issues subpoena for USSS director to testify after assassination attempt\n\nHouse Committee on Oversight and Accountability Chair Rep. James Comer, R-Ky., has issued a subpoena for U.S. Secret Service director Kimberly Cheatle to testify before lawmakers after the assassination attempt on former President Trump on Saturday.\n\nFox News’ congressional correspondent Chad Pergram reports that Comer has issued a subpoena for Cheatle to appear before house lawmakers next Monday.\n\nAn Oversight Committee spokesperson said a subpoena would “head off any attempt by [the Department of Homeland Security] to backtrack from her appearance on Monday,” Pergram said on “The Story with Martha MacCallum” Tuesday.\n\nHe noted that communication between the DHS and the U.S. Secret Service in Capitol Hill “was not going as well as some members had hoped.”\n\n“They were thinking that communication was going pretty good. I was told by one source that Homeland Security kind of stepped in and quieted some of the communication between the Secret Service and Capitol Hill,” Pergram said.\n\nIn addition to next Monday’s hearing there will be a second hearing the following Tuesday where House lawmakers will hear from Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas and FBI Director Christopher Wray, Pergram confirmed.\n\nUSSS director Cheatle has been under scrutiny in recent days for the Secret Service’s failure to prevent an assassination attempt on the former present.\n\nTrump’s would-be assassin – later identified as 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks – fired shots at the former president from the rooftop of a nearby building just minutes after the rally began on Saturday. While the bullets only grazed Trump’s ear, one attendee was killed and others were injured.\n\nCheatle said Tuesday that the building from which Crooks fired had “a sloped roof at its highest point.”\n\n“And so, you know, there’s a safety factor that would be considered there that we wouldn’t want to put somebody up on a sloped roof,” Cheatle said. “And so, you know, the decision was made to secure the building from inside.”\n\nDespite her comments, snipers were stationed on sloped roofs behind the building where Trump spoke.

Associated Press photographer Evan Vucci captured the image that immediately went viral and landed on newspaper front pages across the world.\n\n\"I was literally just thinking about doing the best possible job I could, because I knew that this was a moment in American history that I had to be at the top of my game for,\" Vucci told Fox News Digital on Monday from Milwaukee, where he was preparing to photograph the Republican National Convention.\n\nVucci, a Pulitzer winner who has covered thousands of similar events for the AP since 2003, said the Butler, Pennsylvania rally was \"just like any other\" until he heard popping sounds over his left shoulder.\n\n\"I knew immediately it was gunfire. I trained my lens on the stage, and I saw Secret Service agents going to run to the president, covering him up. And from that moment, I ran to the stage and I got my wide angle lens, and I started making photographs. I went into work mode,\" Vucci said.\n\n\"I knew immediately that it was going to be one of the most important things I'll ever photograph, and that I needed to do the best job possible,\" Vucci continued. \"So I just immediately started thinking about, ‘OK, what do I need to do? How do I compose this? What's going to happen next?’\"\n\nVucci switched to a wide angle to ensure the flag flying above got in his shot. He noticed an SUV parked to the side of the stage as Secret Service agents covered Trump and chaos erupted around him. Vucci said he \"sprinted\" to the side of the stage, assuming it was where Trump would exit, and got in position to snap photos as Trump pumped his fist toward the crowd.\n\n\"That’s where I was when he was coming down… and that's the photo a lot of people are sharing,\" he said.\n\nThe photo hasn’t merely been shared. It has also been praised as both iconic and instantly historic, and it will be on the next print cover of TIME Magazine. it's also one that could change some people's perceptions forever of Trump, one of the most controversial, beloved and loathed political figures in American history.\n\nFox News Digital's Brian Flood and David Rutz contributed to this update.\n\nPosted by Chris Pandolfo Share\n\nLast words of 'hero' firefighter who died at Trump rally shooting revealed\n\nThe volunteer firefighter who died while shielding his family from the sniper who tried to kill former President Trump over the weekend at a rally in Pennsylvania said \"get down!\" as his final words, his wife has revealed.\n\nHelen Comperatore told the New York Post that she and her husband Corey were close to celebrating their 29th wedding anniversary when their family headed to the campaign event in Butler, outside of Pittsburgh, on Saturday.\n\n\"He’s my hero,\" Helen Comperatore said to the newspaper from her home in nearby Sarver, Pennsylvania. \"He just said, ‘get down!’ That was the last thing he said.\"\n\n\"Me and the kids were all there as a family,\" she added. \"He was just excited. It was going to be a nice day with the family.\n\nCorey Comperatore, 50, was the former fire chief for the Buffalo Township Volunteer Fire Company. The department now has a memorial set up outside its firehouse featuring Comperatore’s uniform to honor who they described as a \"brother, son, husband, father and friend.\"\n\n\"He was a simple man, but he put his wife and kids first all the time. I did nothing here. I didn’t lift a finger. He did everything,\" Helen Comperatore told the New York Post in the wake of the shooting, which injured Trump and critically injured two other rallygoers who are expected to survive.\n\nHelen Comperatore also said President Biden tried to call her family following the incident but \"I didn’t want to talk to him.\n\n\"I didn’t talk to Biden,\" she said. \"My husband was a devout Republican and he would not have wanted me to talk to him.\"\n\n\"I don’t have any ill-will towards Joe Biden,\" Helen Comperatore added. \"I’m not one of those people that gets involved in politics.

But by the time Crooks was located, it was too late to stop his bullets.\n\n\"The shooter was actually identified as a potential person of suspicion,\" she said. \"Unfortunately, with the rapid succession of how things unfolded, by the time that individual was eventually located, they were on the rooftop and were able to fire off at the former president.\"\n\nCheatle told ABC News her first reaction to the shooting was \"shock.\"\n\nShe also said the Secret Service was aware of the security vulnerabilities presented by the building Crooks took a sniper's position on to aim at Trump. However, a decision was made not to place any personnel on the roof.\n\n\"That building in particular has a sloped roof at its highest point. And so, you know, there's a safety factor that would be considered there that we wouldn't want to put somebody up on a sloped roof.

He said he was fine, and he thanked me for calling.\"\n\n\"I told him he was literally in the prayers of Jill and me, and his whole family was weathering this,\" Biden added.\n\nHolt’s wide-ranging interview touched on a number of topics about Biden’s troubled run for president in November and the way that the assassination attempt on Trump at his Pennsylvania rally changed the election.\n\nBut Holt first focused on Biden’s own actions following the news of what had happened: Biden was in Delaware on a planned vacation when the attack happened, and he immediately canceled his plans and returned to the White House to address the nation. He announced within hours that he had spoken with Trump on the phone, which Trump praised his rival for reaching out to him.\n\n\"[My] first reaction was, oh my God, this is, oh, there’s so much violence now,\" Biden told Holt. \"I mean, the whole notion that there is this – there’s not place at all for violence in politics in America. None. Zero.\"\n\n\"We’ve reached the point where it’s become too commonplace, not assassinations, but to talk about, for example, you know, the Jan. 6 attack on the capitol,\" Biden continued. \"I got in this race early on in 2020 – for the 2020 race. I wasn’t going to run again because I had lost my son. I didn’t feel … and I watched what happened in Charlottesville, Virginia.\"\n\n\"It was folks coming out of the woods with torches, carrying swastikas, singing the same Nazi bile, accompanied by the Klan,\" he added. \"A young woman was killed, and I was a bystander, and the president – then president – was asked, what do you think?

He was his same usual self, and he's been in a great mood. He's been joking around. He's very fired up and energetic,\" he said.\n\n\"I was proud to see that. It's a good example [of] when you have other people that work for you that are a little shaken up. It's a leadership move, and I'm proud to see the way he's stepped up.\"\n\nJackson's nephew, who attended Trump's campaign rally in Butler on Saturday, was also injured when a bullet grazed his neck but is \"doing well.\"\n\n\"To be honest with you, I think the most traumatic thing for him was not the superficial, minor injury that he sustained, but the fact that he was in the medical tent with the gentleman who passed away,\" Jackson said.\n\n\"They were in the medical tent together. I think that shook him up a little bit,\" he added.\n\nJackson, who formerly served as White House physician during the Obama and Trump administrations, got the chance to look at the former president's wound while onboard a plane with him on Sunday.\n\n\"It did hit his ear, obviously you saw the blood, but he turned his head just at the exact right time, and it just took off a little bit of the top of part of his ear. The ear, of course, is very vascular, so it bleeds like crazy. It's bandaged up and everything because it's prone to bleed again, and it has been a little bit,\" he said.\n\nFox Business' Taylor Penley contributed to this update.\n\nPosted by Chris Pandolfo Share\n\nTrump assassination attempt: Fraternal Order of Police blasts Secret Service 'failure'\n\nThe Fraternal Order of Police is taking issue with the U.S. Secret Service (USSS) response to the attempted assassination against former President Trump at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, on Saturday evening.\n\n\"All of us want answers to our questions. There was, as Secretary Mayorkas said earlier, a security failure—one that nearly cost former President Trump his life,\" FOP President Patrick Yoes said in a statement. \"All of us in law enforcement can agree that the roof of the building should have been secured by law enforcement. It clearly was not. Nonetheless, we must recognize the extraordinary heroism of the Secret Service agents and other officers on the scene who saved the life of their protectee.\"\n\nYoes' comments come as the USSS faces national backlash for its security during the Trump rally that left 50-year-old Corey Comperatore dead after he was shot while protecting his wife and daughters from gunfire. Two others, 57-year-old David Dutch of New Kensington, Pennsylvania, and 74-year-old James Copenhaver of Moon Township, Pennsylvania, are critically wounded.\n\nWhile many locals and rally attendees who spoke with Fox News Digital are thankful Trump is still alive, they are devastated that Comperatore was killed and still asking questions about how gunman Thomas Crooks was able to get on the rooftop of a nearby building and shoot toward the former president.\n\nThe FOP noted that while information about the shooting is still developing, Crooks was still able to reach a position with a direct line of sight toward Trump, who is protected by the USSS.\n\n\"We must remember that the law enforcement mission is a shared mission and law enforcement at every level routinely cooperates and collaborates with one another,\" Yoes continued. \"More than 90% of U.S. law enforcement are [s]tate and local officers. They would not be as effective at their jobs without the support of the Federal colleagues, and our Federal partners would be unable to perform their functions without the assistance of State and local agencies.\"\n\nYoes added that suggestions made to media that local law enforcement agencies should not assist the USSS at events like a presidential campaign rally \"do not know what they are talking about.\"\n\nFox News Digital's Audrey Conklin contributed to this update.\n\nPosted by Chris Pandolfo Share\n\nTrump shooter's assassination attempt shocks former FBI task force officer: 'Blown away'\n\nA veteran Nevada law enforcement officer, who served in the elite FBI Joint Terrorism Task Force, said he was left \"blown away\" after a barrage of gunfire broke out at former President Trump's rally in Pennsylvania.\n\nAshton Packe, a retired Las Vegas detective, shared an inside look into the investigation of the assassination attempt in Butler.\n\n\"I was initially just blown away,\" he said. \"I couldn't believe what I was seeing was actually happening because we put so much faith and belief in the system of the Secret Service to protect former presidents, current presidents and their families.\"\n\nPacke applauded the U.S. Secret Service personnel who quickly surrounded the former president without hesitation.\n\n\"I think I counted less than three seconds from the initial shot to an agent throwing himself on President Trump's body,\" he said. \"I've analyzed the video. I've gone through it several times myself.\"\n\nThe law enforcement veteran said the suspect, who was identified as 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks of Bethel Park, Pennsylvania, was \"amateur hour.\"\n\n\"As far as the suspect is concerned, it was amateur hour,\" he said. \"Anyone you know with an AR-15 rifle or a M4 variant is very effective within 150 yards of where that shot was taken.\n\n\"And so he failed at this, as I'm sure he's failed at many things in his life,\" Packe said.\n\nFox News Digital's Sarah Rumpf-Whitten contributed to this update.\n\nPosted by Chris Pandolfo Share\n\nWhat FBI searching Trump shooter's phone and laptop at Quantico are looking for: Fmr. agent\n\nA former FBI special agent gave an inside look into what federal investigators are looking for after they decrypted the killer's cellphone and laptop in the hope in the hope of discovering Thomas Crooks' motive.\n\nRetired FBI Supervisory Special Agent Scott Duffey told Fox News Digital that, since the FBI announced that it successfully unlocked Crooks' electronics, it is now able to download the contents of his digital footprint.\n\n\"The FBI's cellular analysis surveillance team would be able to look through his phone, be able to download what is on there through software that they have and through cell tower information,\" he said.\n\n\"Since this is a rural area, did he leave that area?

So were they improvised devices that were already ready to go, or was it materials that, for whatever reason, was just to throw dogs off and whatnot,\" he said.\n\n\"And they [the FBI] will want to know how long he had been doing this,\" Duffey said. \"The research that led into the ultimate act of taking a rifle up on top of a rooftop and then firing it into a crowd and ultimately towards the former President of the United States, Donald Trump.\"\n\nDuffey said that federal agencies will also prioritize if Crooks left a final note before his attack at the former president's rally.\n\n\"Did he leave a manifesto?
