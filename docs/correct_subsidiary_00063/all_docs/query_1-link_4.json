        "text": "FOX: Prior to founding my agency, I served as Sr. Creative Director at Fox Studios in Los Angeles.\n\nLeveraging my experience creating oKID.com, in 2000 I landed a gig as a Senior Creative Director at FOX where I was hired to manage the design, editorial and development teams to spin up FoxKids.com as a dot-com start-up. A few months into this opportunity, our team was given responsibility over the digital aspects of the Fox Family brand in addition to Fox Kids. My experience working at FOX was incredible as I learned to successfully navigate the logistics of national, high profile and high traffic brands.\n\nIn 2001, Fox Family Worldwide was sold to Disney in a $5.2 billion dollar acquisition. The Fox Kids content was transitioned into the Disney suite of programming. The Fox Family content was rebranded as ABC Family. Our division was downsized from 50+ to the final six of us who “turned off the lights” on the digital brand in June of 2002. Following my experience at Fox and leveraging my robust contact pool, I embarked on a freelance career that quickly evolved into the creation of my agency, Riser, which operated for the next 13 years."
