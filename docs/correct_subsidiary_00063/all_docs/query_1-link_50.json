        "text": "Nathan is a happy 12-year-old boy who loves to smile and give high fives.\n\nHe loves watching Dora the Explorer, Mickey Mouse, and Jake and the Never Land Pirates. He's also a fan of books featuring any of the above-mentioned characters, especially having the books read to him. A talented artist in his own right, he loves to draw and color.\n\nNathan likes playing with Play-Doh or putty, and gets excited when adults interact with him with these materials. He also loves blocks and Magformers and enjoys building with them. He plays independently on the playground and with yoga balls in school. He is the type of child who does not need much teaching to enjoy play or toys. He is independent with most leisure activities.\n\nNathan responds well to a structured setting with positive reinforcement. He is making great progress at school and is learning to master skill after skill. His personality shines through and all his teachers report that he's a pleasure to work with.\n\nREAD MORE: TUESDAY'S CHILD: Tatiana Loves Swimming and Horses\n\nNathan would do best with an active family with lots of energy and some experience with children. A two-parent family would be preferred due to the level of supervision Nathan requires. If there is a single parent with a large engaged support system and experience with children, they would be considered as well. As part of the Open Adoption Agreement, Nathan needs to maintain regular sibling visitation therefore a family in Massachusetts or the New England area will be considered.\n\nWho Can Adopt?\n\nIf you’re at least 18, have a stable source of income and have room in your heart, you may be a perfect match to adopt a waiting child. Adoptive parents can be single, married or partnered; experienced or not; renters or homeowners; LGBTQ+ singles and couples. As an adoptive parent, you won’t have to pay any fees. Adoption from foster care is completely free in Massachusetts.\n\nAdopting a child from foster care includes training, interviews and home visits to determine if adoption is right for you. These steps will help match you with a child or sibling group that will be a good fit.\n\nTo learn more about adoption from foster care, call the Massachusetts Adoption Resource Exchange (MARE) at (617) 964-6273 or visit www.mareinc.org. Start the process today and give a waiting child a permanent place to call home."
