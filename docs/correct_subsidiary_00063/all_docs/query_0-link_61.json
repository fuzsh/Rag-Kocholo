        "text": "Looking to compete more aggressively with integrated congloms like Viacom and AOL Time Warner, Disney confirmed Monday its $5.3 billion purchase of Fox Family Worldwide.\n\nIt’s “a deal we had been fantasizing about for maybe three years,” asserted Mouse chairman-CEO Michael Eisner during a press conference at the Television Critics Assn. tour in Pasadena.\n\nThe same could be said for the net’s former 50-50 owners, Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp. and Haim Saban, who were frustrated by the channel’s weak ratings.\n\nBut Disney plans to inject new life into the net and get more bang for its entertainment buck by drawing, in part, on rebroadcasts of Mouse properties such as ABC primetime shows, news and sports. Fully distributed cable nets are rare assets, and with 81 million subscribers, Fox Family holds enormous potential.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nDisney will pay $3 billion in cash plus the assumption of $2.3 billion in debt (Daily Variety, July 23). In return it gets the Fox Family Channel, the Saban Entertainment library, 76% of Fox Kids Europe and Fox Kids Latin America.\n\nRenamed ABC Family, net will be headed by Maureen Smith, president of Fox Family and Fox Kids Network. Channel will rely heavily on repurposed content from Disney properties, including ABC, ESPN and Disney Channel, as well as Disney-owned magazines Family Fun and Discover.\n\nNet will be managed jointly by the ABC Television Network and the ABC Cable Networks Group. The international channels will report to the ABC Cable Nets Group, which also oversees the international Disney Channels. Eisner said that no immediate layoffs were anticipated, but the consolidation of Fox Family’s assets into the Disney empire “could over time create cutbacks.”\n\nProgramming costs\n\nDeal will give ABC the opportunity to amortize the costs of original programming — a common goal in this age of fragmented television audiences and skyrocketing programming costs. NBC, for instance, re-airs several news programs on its cable nets CNBC and MSNBC.\n\nABC multicasts its daytime soaps on its cabler SoapNet and broadcasts “Once and Again” on Lifetime — in which Disney owns a 50% stake — days after it airs on ABC.\n\n“The need to better amortize program costs is extreme,” said Robert Iger, Disney’s president and chief operating officer. “This would give us a second airing of an ABC Television network program on ABC Family in a fairly brief time,” Iger said, adding that the repurposing “will not be limited to one type of program genre or one program.”\n\nRepurposing plan\n\nThrough its most recent deal with its affiliates, ABC has the right to repurpose 25% of its primetime entertainment programming within a week of its original broadcast. In addition, ABC can pepper the sked of the new net with rebroadcasts of its news, sports and daytime programming, as well as movies and specials.\n\nSpecifically, Eisner said “ABC World News Tonight” and ABC News’ “Nightline” could be multicast on ABC Family. Also, ABC News’ “Good Morning America” could be extended with a live component on the new ABC cabler.\n\n“This deal is the beginning of a new trend in the American broadcast and cable environment,” Eisner said. “This acquisition means that we can still make expensive Hollywood film and entertainment content.”\n\nRepurposing programming may be cost-effective, but it tends to irk affiliates. ABC will conduct a conference call for affils today to discuss Disney’s acquisition of Fox Family and potential repurposing possibilities. ABC’s pact with its affiliates expires in one year.\n\nRebroadcast complications\n\nIt’s also more complicated than it sounds to rebroadcast an entertainment series on a cable net. Profit participants must give their approval to avoid the accusation that nets are self-dealing or favoring their sister companies.\n\nSteven Bochco, for instance, accused Fox of licensing “NYPD Blue” to its own cable network, FX, at fees substantially below fair-market value. In April, Bochco settled his suit against 20th Century Fox. David Duchovny filed a similar suit against Fox over “The X-Files.”\n\nDisney, of course, is no stranger to angry profit participants: The studio engaged in a battle with “Home Improvement” producer Wind Dancer in the mid-1990s. Wind Dancer, which eventually settled with Disney out of court, accused the studio of not shopping “Home Improvement” around town and sealing a sweetheart deal with ABC when the show’s license came up for renewal. Disney originally sold “Home Improvement” to ABC when Capital Cities still owned the network, but had acquired the web by the time the Tim Allen laffer’s initial license expired.\n\nPut to good use\n\nDisney plans to use the new cable net to bring back its Friday night “TGIF” block of family-friendly shows, which aired on ABC until spring 2000. Disney will also assume Fox Family’s portion of Fox’s Major League Baseball programming. The eight to 11 first-round playoff games will be produced and marketed by ESPN, which will also sell the ad time.\n\nABC Family will inherit News Corp.’s obligation to carry Pat Robertson’s “700 Club” program and other programs produced by the Christian Broadcast Network. News Corp. agreed to do so when it acquired Robertson’s cable TV empire in 1997. Iger declined to comment on when the shows will air and how long ABC Family is required to air the religious-themed series.\n\nFox Kids not included\n\nThe Fox Kids Network, an afternoon and Saturday block of kids programming that airs on Fox broadcast affils in the U.S., was not included in the deal. News Corp. will separately acquire Saban’s interest in Fox Kids.\n\nThe future of Fox Kids Network has been up in the air for some time. Faced with a soft local kids ad market, affils have pressured Fox to drop the afternoon block. Fox has a long-term agreement with its affils to program that block, however, which could then be filled with programming from Twentieth TV.\n\nIt’s doubtful that Fox Kids would completely disappear, especially as long as stations are required to air three hours per week of educational programming.\n\nDisney chief financial officer Tom Staggs called the Fox Family assets “diamonds in the rough” and said Disney projects it will double the combined operating cash flow of those operations to $300 million by 2003. He said the international operations hold particularly good prospects for boosting subscriber growth.\n\nAsked if Disney planned to follow the big buy with further acquisitions, Eisner told analysts the Mouse House remains on an acquisitive tract. But, he added, “I think this is enough for this week.”\n\nRun for AT&T Broadband?\n\nSome within Disney, for instance, believe the conglom has little choice but to consider making a run for cable giant AT&T Broadband to gain lucrative pipelines. But under present ownership rules and without FCC waivers, the Mouse would likely have to shed valuable owned-and-operated stations in major markets where AT&T is the primary cable provider.\n\nThe Fox Family deal could close in three to four months, depending on antitrust approvals in the U.S. and abroad.\n\nDisney shares closed down 12¢ at $26.88 on Monday; News Corp. was up 67¢ at $36.17. That’s about what one would expect as buyers usually see an immediate stock price dip and sellers a gain. Still, Wall Streeters mostly applauded the deal as a good strategic move for Disney despite the hefty pricetag.\n\nIt was a down day on Wall Street generally, with all three major indexes posting significant drops."
