No credit card required.\n\nABC\n\nABC, or American Broadcasting Corporation, is one of the largest and oldest US television networks and pay-television providers that, by affiliations with numerous stations, caters for practically all tastes of TV viewers.\n\nABC Family Worldwide (to give its full name) is a subsidiary of Walt Disney Television. By amalgamating and rebranding various networks (including Fox Family and Fox Kids, Disney XD, Disney Junior and others), ABC Family is now one of the best entertainment channels with thousands of shows for families and kids.\n\nThe service, just like a lot of other geo-located platforms, is only available in a restricted area. What it means is that if you want to watch it outside the US (for example, while traveling), you will see the message that the service is unavailable in your area. It happens because the ABC servers detect your IP location as being outside the US territory.\n\nHow to watch ABC Family outside the US with Smart DNS Proxy\n\nSmart DNS reroutes part of your traffic via US-based servers. Your IP avoids being detected as non-US and enables you to connect to geo-blocked services which are available only in the USA. It is not as complicated as it seems as there is no need to install any extra software or have any specialist knowledge. You simply join us for a free 14-day trial, set up your device to be used with our service (you can easily do it yourself or follow our support tutorials) and you are all set to stream ABC Family and enjoy your time with your family.\n\nAnother solution is setting up your home network to work with Smart DNS Proxy Smart DNS (you can ask our support engineers to help you out if you have any problems with it) to make all your Internet-enabled devices in your home be ready to stream geo-located services that we support.\n\nABC Family is a great platform to watch with your family and kids. It runs a number of kids shows, and thanks to its acquisition by Disney, it has a wide variety of programs that anyone can enjoy. All of them can be made available thanks to Smart DNS Proxy Smart DNS technology.\n\nHow to use Smart VPN to stream ABC Family\n\nAnother great way to gain access to geo-blocked services like ABC Family is Smart VPN which is also available to our subscribers. This heavily encrypted and secured Internet connection takes you directly to one of our American servers. Such connection keeps your online activities fully confidential and no sensitive data is revealed to us, to you ISP or anyone who would like to take control of your data.\n\nRegister with Smart DNS Proxy and use the possibilities of unblocking geo-restricted services like ABC Family and watching the best movies and shows on streaming platforms."
