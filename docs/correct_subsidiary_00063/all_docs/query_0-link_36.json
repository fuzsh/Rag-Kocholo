        "text": "Background\n\nABC Spark was launched on March 23, 2012 by Corus Entertainment and Shaw Media, replacing Dusk. In April 2013, Corus assumed full ownership of the channel. The channel's name and programs are licensed by The Walt Disney Company under Walt Disney Television subsidiary, ABC Family Worldwide.\n\n1st Logo (2012-2016)\n\nVisuals: Similar to the ABC Family Originals logo of the time, except a white flash is shown and the ABC Spark logo forms from sparks, hence the name. The text \"an original presentation of\" is above the logo as it zooms out while sparks emitter around it.\n\nVariant: Starting in 2016, the logo was enhanced with a different background and the logo forms faster than usual. In addition, the above text is absent and \"ORIGINAL\" appears inside a banner alongside a Corus byline fading in.\n\nTechnique: CGI by SPILLT and elevation.\n\nAudio: None or the closing theme.\n\nAvailability: Seen on an ABC Spark print of the film Beautiful Girl, plastering the 2003 ABC Family Originals logo. The variant with the Corus byline appears on Rise.\n\n2nd Logo (July 6-September 7, 2016)\n\nVisuals: On a white background with faint gray lined and dotted textures behind it, the ABC Spark logo in a teal color appears glitching in several locations. It then stops to form the logo, as \"ORIGINAL\" inside a teal rectangle peeks in from the bottom. Then the Corus byline in black fades in underneath.\n\nTechnique: 2D computer animation by Jennie Davis.\n\nAudio: None.\n\nAvailability: This (alongside the YTV, Global, Teletoon, Treehouse, CMT, HGTV, Food Network and W Network logos) was later replaced by the Corus logo. Only seen on Canadian printings of Cheer Squad, as US prints have the Freeform logo."
