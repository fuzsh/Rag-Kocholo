        "text": "HLAS Web This link opens in a new window\n\nFeatured\n\nAlternate Name(s) HLAS Online, Handbook of Latin American Studies\n\nThe Handbook of Latin American Studies (HLAS) is a bibliography on Latin America consisting of works selected and annotated by scholars. Edited by the Hispanic Division of the Library of Congress, the multidisciplinary Handbook alternates annually between the social sciences and the humanities. Each year, more than 130 academics from around the world choose between 2,000-3,000 works for inclusion in the Handbook. Continuously published since 1936, the Handbook offers Latin Americanists an essential guide to available resources.\n\nCoverage: 1936-present\n\nUpdated regularly, HLAS Web provides rapid, comprehensive access to decades of scholarship on Latin America. The annotated citations describe books, journal articles, book chapters, conference papers, maps and atlases, and e-resources published from the 1960s to the present. HLAS Web is an ADA-compliant, mobile friendly site with robust search options and permalinks for each record. Older volumes are available in print and can be found in the Hispanic Reading Room. The print volume of the Handbook is published annually by the University of Texas Press.\n\nJSTOR Jewish Studies External This link opens in a new window\n\nNew\n\nJewish Studies Collection features journals that cover a unique range of historical and regional aspects of Jewish Studies.

As part of their effort to curb imperial influence, the Bolsheviks closed the newspaper Sanktpeterburgskiia Viedomosti, which had been founded by Peter the Great in 1702.\n\nAfter Pravda was relocated to Moscow in 1918, Petrogradskaia Pravda was established to function as the official organ of the local Communist Party committees and soviets. During this time, it covered events such as the Polish-Soviet War (1918-1921) and the establishment of the Soviet Union (1922).\n\nFollowing Lenin’s death in 1924, Petrograd was renamed Leningrad—and the title was subsequently renamed Leningradskaia Pravda.\n\nLeningradskaia Pravda is perhaps best known for continuously publishing during the Siege of Leningrad (1941-1944), during which time only a single issue did not appear. Following World War II, the title covered the trials and executions of Nazis who committed atrocities during the siege.\n\nLeningradskaia Pravda continued to publish through the second half of the twentieth century, during which time the publication was awarded the Order of Lenin for its revolutionary merits. Following the August 1991 Soviet coup attempt, the newspaper ceased publication.\n\nThe Leningradskaia Pravda Digital Archive is a valuable resource for scholars of history, politics, sociology, and Slavic studies. It also represents a valuable historical preservation project and may be of interest to institutions that study war, genocide, and the Holocaust."
