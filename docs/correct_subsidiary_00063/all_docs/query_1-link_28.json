        "text": "Forever Red to Air Tommorrow on ABC Kids\n\nTommorow, 9.4.02, the highly anticipated teamup with all past Red Rangers will air on ABC Family and next Sunday, 9.12.02, on ABC Family. Be sure not to miss this one; it is probably the most anticipated episode this season.\n\nAnother Video To Be Released\n\nIn addition to Lionheart and Ancient Awakening , the two videos currently released, and Identity Crisis and The Curse of the Wolf, two to be released December 1, a video entitled \"Red Alert\" will be released on October 1. On this video will be three episodes from Mighty Morphin, Space, and Time Force ~ \"Two Heads Are Better Than One\", \"Mission To Secret City\", and \"Beware The Knight\", respectively.\n\nRemember 911\n\nI think we should all take a time out to remember the people who lost their lives September 11, 2001. I wrote this in a forum not long ago about the events.\n\nI couldn't understand why God had allowed this to happen, but I knew there was a reason. Though I can't say I know the will of God, I do know good did come out of it. Insteading of having actors or actresses as the acclaimed stars, we had the people deserving of that title given it to them. That was the firefighters, policemen, and our men and women in the service. I also believe it struck a newfound spirituality to this nation, though many of it was hypocritical and lasted very little time at all.\n\nOverall, I think we as a nation have forgotten lessons learned. Much of the newfound \"spirituality\" has been lost, as well as simple things as being kind to others. We have forgotten our cause in the War on Terror, now even questioning whether we should invade Iraq, one of the biggest terrorist funding nations with weapons designed to kill Americans. Pluralism has overtaken Americans, insisting every religion and \"belief\" is true, not a single Truth, and moral absolutes. Whats worse, we have had things like the lawsuits to ban the pledge of allegiance.\n\nHopefully, it won't take another attack for us to remember lessons learned.\n\nCheck Local Affiliates for Time\n\nJust a reminder to check your local ABC affiliates for preemption and other reasons for either not showing the episodes at their correct time. If you are sure you will miss it, it might be wise to wait for the episode's premier on ABC Family.\n\nThere are supposedly two new episodes airing, one of them being Forever Red. Tune in to see!\n\nABC Family's Lineup Altered\n\nAdding a little confusion to our lives, Disney has altered ABC Family's schedule. In the change, here are the times (eastern). Mon-Fri: WF at 8:00 ; Sat: WF at 8:00, LR at 8:30 ; Sun: LR at 8:00, 8:30, 10:00 , WF at 10:30.\n\nOn ABC Kids, Wild Force episodes will air on Saturdays at 11:30 and 12:00.\n\nMaster Org Figure Produced\n\nKeeping up with the largeness of the Wild Force toyline, Bandai has decided to release a Master Org figure in a set with what looks like the Red, Blue, and Lunar Wolf Savage Battle figures, a Black cycle figure, and a yellow cycle figure. This will be the second year in a row that an American made villain has been released.\n\nPower Rangers Game Boy Advance Game Reviewed\n\nVideo game site IGN.com recently reviewed the new Power Rangers Wild Force game for the Game Boy Advance. In the review, the editor said it wasn't as bad as previous games, but was still aimed at the younger audience. One of the high points is its multiplayer compatibility (although everyone has to have a cartridge) and the variety of Zords. To read the full review from IGN, go here.\n\nPower Rangers CD to be Released?\n\nAccording to this musicsite(scroll ot the bottom to see) and others, there will be a \"Power Rangers Collection\" CD series to come out. These will most likely contain theme and/or battle songs, something many fans have wanted for several years. According to the list, Volume 1 will come out October 22. Despite skepticism, maybe Disney's purchase of Power Rangers wasn't such a bad idea anyway.\n\nMore News of Power Ranger's Move\n\nFirst off the official press release from ABC of its new ABC Kids block, inlcuding Digimon and Power Rangers, can be found here.\n\nOn the Fox Kids side of things, on 8/17 Fox Kids came in forth in ratings behind ABC, CBS, and WB. What a sad fate to the network who basically started the network kids programming idea, and started such hits as Batman, The Animated Series, Spiderman, and Power Rangers. For a list of all the shows that have appeared on Fox Kids, go here.\n\nNew \"Forever Red\" Pictures\n\nFrom the Official Jason David Frank Fan Clubcomes pictures directly from the set of \"Forever Red\". (Note: SPOILERS ahead; highlight to read)From what I can tell, the only actor not returning is Leo. Tommy's hair is now short, and it appears Bulk and Skull will return.\n\nWild Force Toyline Continually Expanding\n\nIn addition to the wave one toys and some of the wave two toys currently being released, tons of new toys have been coming out. Three different kinds of twelver inch figures have come out, one that talks, one that comes with armor, and one that comes with a huge Savage Cycle. The Temple Ruins toyset is out with an exclusive Princess Shayla figure, and there are two playsets released, one with the Predazord and one with Isis. Also, there will be large Red or Lunar Wolf spin morph plastic figures (not vinyl like the twelve inch figures)that come with a remote controlled Savage Cycle. For the Isis line, there will be a Jumbo Isis Megazord and large Isis playset. If you think all that is enough in addition to the already announced wave two toys, there will be an Ultimus Megazord with Red Kongazord, Blue electronic Bison, Blue Shark, mini Soul Bird arm, and Armadillo (not like the normal one).\n\nNext Wild Force Episode to Air on ABC Kids Sept. 14\n\nConfirming the move to ABC Kids ans Family, Wild Force will be taking a break to air the next episode on ABC Kids at 11:30 (I believe). Be sure to catch the move September 14.\n\nMore Forever Red and ABC Family Info\n\nThe official date for Power Rangers going to ABC Family is confirmed to be September 14, the same day the Fox Box premiers. According to the schedule, Power Rangers Wild Force will be on 7 days a week, and twice on Sunday (hopefully these won't be new, because that would mean myself and many others would have to set the VCR because of church).\n\nOf other interest, in the episode Forever Red, there will be TEN Rangers to return, yes ten. They will be Jason, Aurico, Tommy, T.J., Andros, Leo, Carter, Wes AND Eric, and Cole.\n\nTo get some really good info, go here! Go on down and see the picture of all ten Rangers!\n\nTime Force/Wild Force Teamup To Air\n\nPart one of the two part \"Reinforcements from the Future\" will air theis Saturday, July 27! Three \"Mut-Orgs\" (Mutant Orgs) attack the Wild Force Rangers, but Eric and Wes try to stop them. They, knowing who can help, contact the Rangers in the future who recruit Ransik and Nadira to help!\n\nI'm glad they're not throwing out the fact that Ransik and Nadira are good. Hopefully this two parter, as well as the teanup with past Red Rangers \"Forever Red\" which airs the Saturday after part 2 of the TF/WF teamup, will breathe some fresh air into Wild Force which in my opinion desparately needs it!\n\n\"Fox Box\" Begins Promotions\n\n4Kids Entertainment replacement for Fox Kids, the Fox Box, recently began promotions for it's fall lineup. Though not much in the way of shows was previewed, there were a few clips which were hard to see. Be assured, more promotions are on the way.\n\nPower Rangers Ninja Storm to Film in New Location?\n\nSome rumors have surfaced that Power Rangers Ninja Storm will film in a different location than it has for the past ten seasons. Some have said it will be New Zealand, but nothing has been confirmed.\n\nWave Two Toys Begin To Hit Shelves\n\nWild Force toys wave 2 toys are beginning to hit shelves across the country. Currently out (where I live anyway) are the Auto-Morphin Rangers and new cycles (much resembling the Strata Cycle). One notable item is that there is a Zenaku Auto-Morph that changers to a Lunar Wolf Ranger head.\n\nPower Rangers Ninja Storm Confirmed!\n\nRecently, Disney has revealed the name of the next Power Rangers : Power Rangers Ninja Storm!\n\nThe press summary goes as follows:\n\nThree rebellious students are the last ones remaining at their ninja academy after evil aliens attack the Earth. With mankind at the brink of destruction, the fate of the world lies in the hands of these unlikely heroes. Their ninja master teaches them to harness ancient mystical energies that transform them into Power Rangers.\n\nWild Force Videos Confirmed\n\nIt has been confirmed that four new videos will be produced, of course with many more to come. The four confirmed are Lion Heart, Ancient Awakening, Curse of the Wolf, and Identity Crisis. With already four videos on the way, Wild Force may come out with a record number of videos for one season.\n\nBulk and Skull to Return Also\n\nIn addition to the rumor that Jason David Frank will return, Paul Schrier (Bulk) has confirmed that he and Jason Narvy (Skull) will return for a Power Rangers Wild Force episode. This is most likely true. Who else will be in the supposed Power Rangers reunion episod? Only time will tell. For the arcticle, go here.\n\nFirst Wild Force GBA Screens\n\nNow on the web are some impressive shots of the new Wild Force Game Boy Advance game hitting the shelves later this year. What is interesting is that the game is in 3D in contrast with the Time Force GBA game which was 2D last year. The Zord battles have been vastly improved also. Here are the shots: 1, 2,3,4,5 , 8\n\nNew ABC Family Schedule\n\nA new ABC Family schedule has been put in place, showing Wild Force the weekdays instead of Time Force. Another change that has happened is that Best of Power Rangers has been moved to 10 am.\n\nFox Kids's Replacement Named\n\nAs many of you know, 4Kids Entertainment (the company behind Pokemon) has bought the Fox Kids block on Saturday mornings. The block debuting on September 14 has been officially named the \"Fox Box\" and will feature a whole new lineup of shows. Power Rangers Wild Force will obviously be moved to ABC Family because of the change.\n\nHere is the lineup for the new \"Fox Block\"\n\n8:00 AM: STARGATE INFINITY\n\n8:30 AM: ULTRAMAN TIGA (A show much like Sentai in Japan)\n\n9:00 AM: KIRBY\n\n9:30 AM: KINNIKUMAN: ULTIMATE MUSCLE\n\n10:00 AM: ULTRAMAN TIGA/TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES (Launches Q1-2003) (Not the original, but a new series)\n\n10:30 AM: ULTIMATE MUSCLE\n\n11:00 AM: KIRBY (Based on the Nintendo character)\n\n11:30 AM: FOOD FEUD\n\nAll info is from Toon Zone\n\nLunar Wolf Ranger Revealed!\n\nThe Lunar Wolf Ranger has been revealed to be Merrick, originally Zen-Aku (athough this was kind of obvious)! Here is the backstory to Merrick / Lunar Wolf Ranger / Zen-Aku:\n\nMerrick was originally one of the original six warriors to protect Animaria. The battle between Animus and Master Org was not going good, so Merrick decided he must do something to help. He had heard of the legend of a wolf mask that gave great power, so he set off to find it and harness its power. When he did, he realized there were consequences and that he might be cursed, but he put it on anyway.\n\nPutting on the mask, he calls on the Predazord which is now fully powered by the mask. Together, they stop Master Org. Later, though, the mask takes over, turning him into Zen-Aku. He pleads that the other five warriors destroy him before he is completely overtaken by evil, but they can't fight a friend. As he is turned completely evil, they decide they must lock him up. He has layed locked away, until just recently...\n\nWild Force Fan Zone Shuts Down\n\nOne of the most respected and informative Wild Force websites, the Wild Force Fan Zone, has completely shut down due to the webmasters busyness and lack of desire to work on it. It was probably one of the best Wild Force sites on the web, complete with episode reviews (about 8 per episode!), snaps, information, and even visits from most of the Wild Force cast! We respect the webmaster's decision and hope he will do well in all further ventures. To visit the webiste and see the reasons of his closure, go here. (((Updated 5/29/02: The site has recently reopened, but has much fewer of the features.)))\n\nLack of Updates\n\nSorry for the recent lack of updates. I have been very busy and have not had much time to work on this site. The episode information will be up very soon (albeit with much shorter summaries) as well as updated character information.\n\nFormer Power Ranger Jason Frank To Return?\n\nCould former Power Ranger Jason David Frank, known to his fans as Tommy, be returning? Several reports on many PR boards have said that Jason David Frank's agent has made a statement saying he may make an appearance on a Power Ranger Reunion Episode and may become a regular if the fans contact ABC Family. Whether this is true has yet to be seen, but seeing that we would have to contact ABC Family leads me to believe this possible change may occur in the fall when Power Rangers moves to ABC Family full time. Other reports from the JDF fan group have said the same thing. Only time will tell if our speculations are correct.\n\nCurse of the Wolf: Zen'Aku to Premier!\n\nNext week, Lord Duke Zen'Aku will premier after being locked away for the past three thousand years. With his wolf-like appearance, he will be able to move about from place to place with enourmous agility, which will be a big problem for our heroes. And now for some spoilers (highlight to read)... Zen'Aku will call upon the Hammerhead Shark, Alligator, and Wolf to create the Predazord. Later, Zen'Aku will become the Lunar Wolf Ranger and joing th Wild Force team.\n\nHappy Easter!\n\nI would like to wish a happy Easter to everyone! Please remember Easter is not about the chocolates and bunnies, but has a greater meaning! For more information on the way of salvation and the true meaning, go here.\n\nHaim Saban Makes Record Donation for Democrats\n\nMuch to my dismay (please know I am NOT a Democrat), Power Rangers creator Haim Saban has given a record $7 million dollars to the Democratic National Committee. It is believed to be the single largest donation to a political party ever and will be used to help fund a new DNC headquarters. Thankfully Mr. Saban is no longer in control of Power Rangers.\n\nNew Fox Kids Promo Advertises the Lunar Wolf Introduction!\n\nA new promo running on Fox Kids advertises the villain who will eventually become the Lunar Wolf Ranger. Look for him to appear in two weeks!\n\nTHQ Announces Wild Force GBA Game!\n\nAccording to IGN, THQ has announced they are creating a Power Rangers Wild Force game for the hand-held Game Boy Advance system. Speculation is it will be much similar to the Power Rangers Time Force GBA game. Other than this, not much other is known.\n\nFor more, go here\n\nPower Rangers Wild Force at Toy Fair 2002!\n\nWild Force was shown at this year's Toy Fair in New York. Featured were many armored Rangers, vehicles, Zords, and also the return of the auto-morphin Rangers (or in this case, Spin-Morph)!\n\nAlso confirmed were the names of the Megazords. For those of you familiar with Gaoranger, I'll show the equivalent. First, the Isis Megazord (Gao Icarus) is comprised of a Falcon, Deer, Giraffe, Rhino, and Armodillo. Second, the Pegasus Megazord (Gao Centaurus?) is made up of a Lion, Falcon, Shark, Tiger, and Elephant. Third, the already confirmed Predazord (Gao Hunter) is made up of an alligator, hammerhead shark, and wolf. Lastly, the Animus Megazord (Gao God) comprised of Gun-metal Lion, Maroon Shark, Brown Bison, Yellow Leopard, and Blue Falcon. Also confirmed is the name of a new villain, Lord Zen-Aku! Who it is has not been confirmed, but I personally believe it will be the Org who will eventually become the Lunar Wolf Ranger.\n\nThough Bandai didn't allow photography in their showroom, they did hand out CDs with pictures on them. To see the pictures and more, go to either Action-Figure.com or Toymania.\n\nMore Power Ranger DVDs on the Way?\n\nA recent arcticle showing what Buena Vista plans to produce included two Time Force arcs, the Destiny sage and End of Time. In addition to being on VHS, it said they were available on DVD also. This still remains to be seen, but we will find out at the time of their release.\n\nPower Rangers Wild Force Premier (Review)!\n\nUnless you have been lost in an Amazonian jungle somewhere, you will most likely realize that Power Rangers Wild Force premiered yesterday with two episodes, \"Lionheart\" and \"Darkness Awakening\". Under the helm were two new writers replacing Judd Lynn and Jackie Merchand. They were William Winkler and Derek Rydall (please note these may not be the writers for the entire show). They definitly have done many things differently in these first two episodes, mainly sticking to the Sentai closer and making the show more action oriented.\n\nI felt \"Lionheart\" to be a bit rushed. It would have been beter to make this a two parter and have a more proper introduction to the other four Rangers. You can tell much emphasis will be on the Zords because this episode featured ample footage of them.\n\n\"Darkness Awakening\" was a much better episode. This was not too rushed and played a key part in the enveiling of the villains. We find out that the Master Org somehow escaped a place called the Nexus, and that the Org are a group on monsters without a heart. It seems like the Org Master is an attempt at a Ransik-type villain. I definitly prefer Ransik over this guy. His third eyeball looks fake and he looks kind of dorky with all the rags and stuff.\n\nThe acting, though, was very good in my opinoin. All five Rangers did a very good job portraying their characters. Jindrax's voice actor portrays him very well, and for the first time since Lost Galaxy, the female villainess is a good actor! My only complaints are with the overly happy Shayla and the Org Master.\n\nOverall, the premeir wasn't that bad. For some reason thay changed the theme song from what we heard in the promo, but it's not that bad.\n\nPower Rangers Wild Force in One Week!\n\nPower Rangers Wild Force premiers in one week, but still little is known about the actor's names or the official names of many of the characters themselves. It has been rumored the Rangers names are Cole, Danny, Max, Taylor, and Alyssa, but no confirmation.\n\nContrary to earlier beliefs, the Wild Force premier will be three episodes, though only two will be shown on Feb 9. The first two are called Lionheart and Darkness Awakening, so they a re apparently not following the \"pt.1, pt. 2\" format.\n\nNext Sentai Confirmed Harikenja!\n\nThough this may be old news, the next Sentai series is called Harikenja (or Hurricanger). You can read more info at Sentai Spoilers, but it begins with three rangers (Red, Yellow, Blue), then adds two more (Orange, Purple). There will be an animal theme again, but this time with a ninja feel.\n\nPower Rangers Theater on ABC Family!\n\nMy prediction about Disney aquiring Fox Family and Saban may be wrong. New news tells us that ABC Family will be airing Power Rangers Theater on Sunday mornings. As much as I dislike the timeslot, this will be a great opportunity to relive some of the greatest episodes in Power Rangers history, and introduce the newer generation of Power Rangers fans to the original show. Beginning in March, catch episodes from Power Rangers seasons 1-5 Sunday Mornings on ABC Family!\n\nOfficial Press Release for Wild Force!\n\nThis is the official press release for Wild Force, containing some of the names of characters in the show. According to this, the villians are named Args (a little TOO close to the Sentai name, Aurgs), two of the main villians are Jindrax and Toxica, Shayla is a mentor to the Rangers, and the floating island is called the Animarium (the EXACT name of the Gaoranger floating island). Though this says the premier will be for half an hour, FoxKids.com has said it will be one hour. Here is the entire arcticle, from Google.\n\nFox Kids Launches 10th Anniversary Season with \"POWER RANGERS WILD FORCE\" (2/9/02)\n\nBlast into the future and celebrate the 10-year anniversary of the Power Rangers franchise with the launch of POWER RANGERS WILD FORCE Saturday, Feb. 9 (8:30-9:00 AM/ET) on Fox Kids.\n\nIn this latest incarnation of the legendary Power Rangers, the ancient Power Animals of Animarium choose five young humans to fight the unnatural, soulless monsters known as the Orgs with wisdom, courage and the powers of their animal Zords: lion, eagle, shark, bison and tiger.\n\nWith the assistance of Shayla, the ageless seer and princess of Animarium, the Wild Force Rangers must find and defeat each Org as soon as it awakens, and before Jindrax and Toxica, the Duke and Duchess of the Orgs, can form an army and free their dark Master.\n\nPOWER RANGERS WILD FORCE is produced by Saban Entertainment.\n\nFox Kids is the action and adventure destination for kids, with four hours of Saturday morning programming. Since its debut in 1990, Fox Kids has maintained a strong position, winning the February 2001 ratings \"sweep\" among broadcast competition with Kids 2-11, Kids 6-11, Boys 2-11 and Boys 6-11. Fox Kids is supported by www.foxkids.com, an award-winning website boasting 1.2 million unique visitors monthly\n\nNew Wild Force Promo Running on Fox Kids!\n\nToday, January 5, Fox Kids began running a promo during Time Force. In the promo we, saw the Red Ranger (who apparently is a Native American) having a dream of looking at large mechanical beasts, and overlooking the island where the Zords reside. When he awakes, he fnids a red glowing orb appear in his hand, the glowing orb being the the item upon which he can call his first Zord, the Lion. If you haven't seen it yet, be sure to catch it next Saturday. Though it isn't as interesting as the first Time Force promo, it does spark an interest in the show.\n\nIn other news, the confirmed name for the combined weapon of all the Rangers is called the Jungle Sword.\n\nFigures.com Wishes Power Rangers a Happy Tenth Anniversary !\n\nIn a recent arcticle, Figures.com highlighted some of Power Rangers achievements in its ten season history. Some of those achievements are being Best Selling Male Action Brand of all the 90's, 2000, 2001 (NPD Group) and having the Starlight Foundation Children's Friendship Award presented to Bandai America and the Power Rangers for their support of children's issues. Here is the entire arcticle.\n\nOfficial PRWF Bandai Site Up!\n\nBandai's new site is up, full with information pertaining to the new Power Rangers Wild Force toys, currently available on stores. Inside you can find pictures and descriptions of the toys, as well as downloadable wallpaper and screensavers. It's pretty cool! Check it out here !\n\nOfficial PRWF Fox Kids Promotional Page Up!\n\nFox Kids's Wild Force promorional page is up, showing an artist's conception of the Wild Force Rangers (could these be the overused annual PR drawings of the Rangers that are plastered everywhere?). Go here to see it.\n\nMore Toys and Confirmed Names!\n\nThanks to Ebay, we now have information regarding the names of some of the Megazords and clearer pictures of the figures. Notice it seems the Red Wild Force Ranger has no possibility in his legs, except for the knees. Plus, Kongazord? What kind of a name is that?\n\nClearer picture of Red Ranger,clearer picture of Black Ranger, clearer picture of Blue Ranger, clearer picture of Putrid, clearer picture of Yellow Ranger, Wild Force Predazord, Deluxe Wild Force Megazord, Wild Force Megazord, Wild Force Kongazord, Red Savage Cycle, Blue Savage Cycle, Yellow Savage Cycle, Red Playset and Crystal Saber. Plus, here's an interesting picture of an upcoming Megazord, a Wild Force Megazord with renovations if you will.\n\nWild Force Toys Hitting the Shelves!\n\nIn some areas, Power Rangers Wild Force toys have been hitting the shelves. Some of the toys that have been released are the five rangers, Jindrax, Putrids, and the morpher, now officially called the \"Growl Phone\" (notice this is the first time in Power Rangers history the morpher hasn't had the term \"morpher\" used in its name). Here are some of the toys from e-bay.\n\nJindrax, Putrids, Blue Ranger, White Ranger, Black Rangger, Red Ranger, Yellow Ranger, and Growl Phone.\n\nClassic Christmas Power Rangers Episode to Air!\n\nHave you been waiting patiently for a rerun of a Mighty Morphin Power Rangers episode to air? Wait no further; this Saturday, December 15, Fox Kids will be airing \"I'm Dreaming of a White Ranger\" in the regular Time Force slot. This episode has been released on video severaly times and was the last episode to feature Kimberly until Turbo: A Power Rangers Movie. Don't miss a chance to relive \"the good old days\" as you watch the Rangers foil Lord Zedd's plan, this Saturday at 8:30 am EST!\n\nFuture for Power Rangers and Fox Kids?\n\nRecently, Fox Kids has been delegating whether to lease its block because of declining ratings. What does this mean for Power Rangers? Read some of these arcticles... (due to their length I will not put them here)\n\n- AOLTW and Nickelodeon possible bidders for FK and TNBC\n\n- FK go bye-bye?/PR to move to ABC Fam?\n\nWild Force Toys Revealed!\n\nWild Force toys have appeared on a shipping company's website featuring some very promising figures. I'm not that proud of the 5.5\" figures and the Zords (which look cheaper, both in price and quality, most likely because of the ample zords we will have) , but other than that the toys look pretty cool! See wave one here!\n\nBrief Look Into Wild Force!\n\nLast Saturday we saw the first promo for Wild Force, featuring some very good film quality and some awesome Zord sequences! This Saturday, November 17, don't miss a preview of Wild Force sometime during End of Time, pt. 3.\n\nRecent Events Hit Toy Industry...\n\n...but not necassarily for bad, for some companies at least. In light of the recent terrorist attacks and the current strikes on Afghanistan, many toy selling stategies will have to be rethought, especially that of Power Rangers. The following arcticle is form World Magazine.\n\nAmerica's war on terrorism has brought back the old \"war toys\" debate in a new way. Since September 11, the toy industry has been busy editing product lines, quitely delaying or pulling some items deemed too violent.\n\nInitial sales, however, may show consumers running against the grain of corporate concern. Wal-Mart reported increased sales of Hasbro's new GI Joe series. Toy analysts say the line could be attractive to parents who want to help children act out their fears. Firefighter and policeman figures are also moving steadily, as well as rescue toy vehicles.\n\nToymakers are trying to eschew violence on one hand while still filling kids' desires for role-playing. Anne Brown, chairwoman of the Consumer Products Safety Commission, reflects the mindset. She said she's against any toys that \"glorify violence,\" yet she also says Army toys and GI Joes are acceptable because \"kids need to really re-enact their fears as heroes.\"\n\nThis view cuts against some politically correct strategies. For example, Bandai America redesigned some of its advertising and marketing for the Power Rangers to promote teamwork instead of combat. The extreme position is like that of the Zany Brainy chain, which ran a promotion where parents could trade in their kids' war toys for \"nonviolent\" items.\n\nRight now, companies are wary about anything that directly concerns terrorism, especially involoving New York or the World Trade Center. The video game industry has been scrambling to remove such images from its new releases.\n\nSympathies and Prayers go out to Terrorist Victims\n\nAs all of youknow, this past week has been a tragic one in which America's freedom was attacked by terrorists. The World Trade Center has collapsed, as well as the Pentagon damaged. The death toll is currently in the thousands. Our greatest sympathies and prayers go out to those whose family was killed or injured in these \"cowardly acts of terrorism\", and we pray that Mr. President will lead us in God's will for this country. God bless America!\n\nDeath of Thuy Trang, Former Yellow Ranger\n\nThough this has not yet been confirmed (but was stated on Funaroverse which is usually correct), Thuy Trang, original Yellow Ranger Trini after Audrey Dubois rejected the role after the pilot, died earlier this week in a car accident. Our sympathies go out to Thuy's friends and family, as does the Power Rangers fandom.\n\nGaoranger VS Super Sentai out in Japan!\n\nAccording to Sentai Spoilers, the much anticipated Gaoranger Vs. Super Sentai is out on video now! This movie has five rangers from different Super Sentai shows come together to help out the Gaorangers to fight a villain that is \"out of their league\". The rangers are Go Yellow from Gogo V (Lightspeed Rescue), Ginga Blue from Gingaman (Lost Galaxy), Mega Pink from Megaranger (in Space),Big One from JAKQ, and Red Falcon from Liveman ( both JAKQ and Liveman were never turned into Power Rangers series). This movie also contains a HUGE \"mecha\"(Zord) fight with ALL the main Megazords. Here are some pics from Sentai Spoilers.\n\nANOTHER Gaobeast:Gao Falcon!\n\nAnother Gaobeast has been shown: the Gaofalcon! I'd be saving my cash this summer; there are going to be TONS of new zords to come out! The picture and arcticle below are from Figures.com.\n\nThe newest Gaoranger is about to be released. The newest Megazord is Gao Falcon. Its huge from the looks of the picture. Itll retail at 4,000 YEN. Gaorangers is really pushing the Zords to their fullest. What will this mean for Power Rangers Wild Force? Well it looks like well defiantly need a lot of money but its cool. There hasnt been a Power Rangers series to date where a Megazord could transform into so many ways. Perhaps Power Rangers Time Force was the beginning of a bright new future.\n\nThis new series has already has aired half of the episodes in Japan and will feature a 2 PART team-up with the current series \"Time Ranger\" to begin October 2001-November 2001 in Nakano, Tokyo Japan. The new series also breaks new ground by not only having a guy-dressed-up-in-a-Zord costume. But also look for new high-tech CGI effects.\n\nUntil next time, Time For Time Force\n\nWalt Disney to Purchase Power Rangers\n\nIt has just been announced that Walt Disney Co. has bought Fox Family Worldwide, which includes Fox Family Channel, International Fox Kids channels and the entire Saban library. What does this mean? Fox Family channel will become ABC Family, Disney now owns all of the Power Rangers episodes. What does that mean? Disney now has control over all the Power Rangers shows. This could mean Power Rangers as we know it will be watered down to a more kid-friendly show, meaning in Power Rangers Wild Force we might not get some of the more mature stories like Alex's *supposed* death. Here is the entire arcticle.\n\nBURBANK, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--July 23, 2001--The Walt Disney Co. will purchase 100 percent of Fox Family Worldwide from News Corp. and Haim Saban, it was announced today by Michael D. Eisner, chairman and CEO, and Robert A. Iger, president and COO.\n\nAmong the businesses being purchased by Disney are:\n\nThe Fox Family Channel, which currently reaches approximately 81 million cable and satellite television subscribers throughout the U.S. and will be renamed ABC Family;\n\nA 76% ownership interest in Fox Kids Europe, which reaches more than 24 million subscribers across Europe and will eventually be recast under the Disney brand;\n\nFox Kids channels in Latin America, which are currently seen by approximately 10 million subscribers and which also will take advantage of the Disney brand;\n\nThe Saban Library and Entertainment Productions business, with its more than 6,500 episodes of animated and live-action children's and family-friendly programming.\n\nThe transaction consists of $3 billion in cash, plus the assumption of $2.3 billion in debt. It is projected to close in three to four months, subject to antitrust approvals both in and outside the U.S.\n\n``This acquisition strengthens our company's worldwide business of family entertainment,'' Eisner said. ``The Family Channel and Fox Kids are unique assets that are particularly well suited to be a part of The Walt Disney Company. The Fox Family Channel is one of the few fully distributed stand-alone channels and gives us a platform for launching ABC Family and strengthening our position as the leading provider of family television programming.\n\n``In creating a new and vibrant family-oriented channel, we also will use the strong programs and brands from ABC and ESPN, as well as Disney-branded services and content from the unparalleled Disney libraries. Using the combined resources of ABC Television and the ABC Cable Networks Group, ABC Family will bring broadcast and cable to a new level of integration, enabling our ABC and cable affiliates to offer viewers new and exciting programming options,'' Eisner added.\n\nSaid Iger, ``The acquisition of the Fox Kids international channels strengthens our presence in important markets in Europe and Latin America and enhances our vast potential for growth outside the U.S. They will provide us with a vehicle for further distributing our programming and brands internationally on basic cable.\n\n``These channels will benefit greatly from a combination of Saban and Disney programming. They will be operated in close cooperation with our 14 international Disney Channels and more than 90 branded time slots on broadcast television, which air in 42 countries around the world and collectively reach 600 million viewers per month. We believe our newly acquired international services will grow far beyond their current distribution levels and their impact on the rest of our international businesses, by virtue of this enhanced reach, will be profound,'' Iger added.\n\nThe Fox Kids international channels include 14 channels covering 74 countries in 18 languages throughout Europe, Latin America and Australia, for a total of 35 million subscribers. Included in the arrangement is the Saban Library, containing more than 6,500 episodes featuring such popular kids' fare as Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, Digimon, Beetleborgs and Spiderman, as well as serials and live-action films.\n\nThe deal provides Disney with a 76 percent interest in Fox Kids Europe; the remaining 24 percent is publicly traded on the Amsterdam stock exchange. Fox Kids Europe will continue to be headed by Ynon Kreiz, who has served as its chairman and CEO since 1999.\n\nThe transaction also includes the television rights to Major League Baseball games two nights a week during the regular season, plus 8-11 first-round playoff games.\n\nEisner added, ``This acquisition further solidifies our cable programming and brand extension strategy, giving us three ABC Television services -- the ABC Television Network, SoapNet, and the new ABC Family. At ESPN, we have four domestic channels: ESPN, ESPN2, ESPN Classic, and ESPNEWS, plus ESPN.com, ESPN The Magazine, and ESPN Zone. And, of course, we have the growing family of Disney-branded television services: Disney Channel, Toon Disney, and the soon-to-be-launched Playhouse Disney, coupled with all the other branded outlets and extensions of the Disney brand.''\n\nNoted Iger, ``We believe that our newly enlarged portfolio of branded entertainment television assets is ideally suited to take advantage of the continued growth of the international cable and satellite market. In addition to giving us an entry into markets like Scandinavia, Poland and Russia, the international Fox Kids channels allow us to broaden our branded reach in markets such as the U.K., France, Germany and Latin America, where we already have a strong presence. We will eventually put the Disney name on the channels to take advantage of the strength of our brand.''\n\nDisney expects that there will be significant opportunities for consolidating resources and back-office functions and sharing business infrastructures. For example, Disney's integrated advertising sales force, ABC Unlimited, which encompasses ABC, ESPN, SoapNet, and Toon Disney, plus the company's Internet and publishing businesses, will also support ABC Family.\n\nDisney will explore with its broadcast affiliates ways for them to participate in ABC Family so they may also benefit from the myriad ways this new channel is expected to enhance the ABC brand, network and stations. Disney will also work with the channel's cable affiliates, who have supported this service since the beginning, to ensure that family-friendly programming retains its role as a highly valued component of basic cable. Since it debuted a revamped programming schedule in 1998, Fox Family Channel has received enthusiastic support from MSOs and satellite distributors.\n\nABC Family will be managed collaboratively between the ABC Television Network and the ABC Cable Networks Group. The international channels will report to the ABC Cable Networks Group, which also has responsibility for the international Disney Channels, including Toon Disney and Playhouse Disney. ABC Family will continue to broadcast the 700 Club and other programs produced by the Christian Broadcast Network, headed by Pat Robertson. The transaction does not include the Fox Kids domestic programming block currently aired on the Fox broadcast network.\n\nWhen fully integrated into Disney, ABC Family will be an outlet for an array of new family-friendly content from other Disney sources. For example, the company intends to explore opportunities such as family television features or series based on the content of Disney-owned magazines such as Family Fun and Discover, and the Family.com web site, which will be further complemented by the Fox Family-related web sites that are part of this transaction.\n\nHere are some more news arcticles. - Disney in Talks to Buy Fox Family Worldwide for $3.3 Billion, -Disney near $5.3 bln deal to buy Fox Family\n\nPower Rangers Wild Force for 2002!!!\n\nAccording to the New York Trade Show, the next Power Rangers series will be called Power Rangers Wild Force!

I will soon make a site about it once we get more information.\n\nThe following is from Figures.com.\n\nPower Rangers Wild Force = The 10th anniversary for the Power Rangers.\n\nIsn't it exciting? 10 years of Power Rangers. In 2002 the newest Power Rangers Show and Toys will hit North America. Past seasons have focused on the Rangers weapons and armor, but this new endeavour will zoom in primarily on the power animals (Zords). The show in question? 100 Beasts Task Force-Gao-Ranger currently airing in Japan; to be simply entitled Wild Force Power Rangers here in the States. The new series is described as:\n\n\"Evil Forces have unleashed monsters bent on destruction. From the depths of all that is vile, the remnants of industrial pollution, toxic waste and environmental pillaging have created sinister beings that raid the earth of its living energy. The only hope for the world is a squad of five teens, each chosen for his or her special skill and sense of adventure. The powerful group possesses the mighty Bio-Energy power that enables them to morph into the invincible Power Rangers Wild Force. At the Rangers' sides are the devoted Power Animals that descend from their habitat when the rangers need them most. These brave creatures morph into unstoppable zords... forces like any other in Power Rangers'history.\"\n\nThis new series has already been signed for 51 episodes in Japan and will feature a 2 PART team-up with the current series \"Time Ranger\" to begin October 2001-November 2001 in Nakano, Tokyo Japan. The new series also breaks new ground by ditching the cheesy (but classic) guy-dressed-up-in-a-Zord costume look for new high-tech CGI effects."
