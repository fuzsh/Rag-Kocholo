If you are having symptoms you believe may be the result of mold allergens, please visit Student Health Services in DaSilva Hall.\n\nThe EPA reports that “there is no practical way to eliminate all mold and mold spores in the indoor environment; the way to control indoor mold growth is to control moisture”. St. John’s University has a Mold Management Plan to identify and treat areas of potential mold growth.\n\nGuidelines for Preventing Mold and Mildew Growth\n\nREDUCE HUMIDITY\n\nMinimize indoor humidity levels during hot and humid weather, by keeping room windows closed, and operating your air conditioners at or above 70° F.\n\nThoroughly dry your personal items. Do not leave wet or damp clothes, towels or shoes in closets. Set them out on drying racks until completely dry.\n\nDo not place potted plants or any other source of moisture on or around heating and cooling units.\n\nDo not block the airflow from your heating or cooling unit.\n\nCondensation usually appear on cold surfaces. Wipe visible condensation with a paper towel and discard in trash.\n\nREMOVE FOOD SOURCES\n\nMold feeds on dust. Routinely wipe down dusty surfaces.\n\nMaintain good housekeeping practices and clean your room, bathroom, bed linens, clothing and towels regularly. Please empty your room and bathroom trash on a regular basis, and do not allow trash to accumulate in your room.\n\nWHEN TO REPORT\n\nIf you see what you suspect are small amounts of mold, you can clean this with a general household cleaner.\n\nReport larger or recurring mold growth to Facilities Services by calling 718-990-6254, or using the MySJU > How Do I > Submit a Request to Facilities Services.\n\nFor emergencies involving a plumbing leak or any water infiltration, please call Facilities Services at 718-990-6253 or 718-990-6254 (day) or Public Safety 718-990-6281 (evenings/weekends).\n\nMold and Mildew FAQ\n\nWhat are the health effects from mold?\n\nMolds have the potential to cause health problems. Mold exposure can irritate the eyes, skin, nose, throat, and lungs. Molds produce allergens (substances that can cause allergic reactions) and irritants. Inhaling or touching mold or mold spores may cause allergic reactions in sensitive individuals. Allergic responses include hay fever-type symptoms, such as sneezing, runny nose, red eyes, and skin rash. Molds can also cause asthma attacks in people with asthma who are allergic to mold. For more detailed information consult the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention mold website.\n\nWhat is the difference between mold and mildew?\n\nMolds include all species of microscopic fungi that grow in the form of multicellular filaments, called hyphae. Molds can thrive on any organic matter, including clothing, leather, paper, and the ceilings, walls and floors of homes with moisture management problems. Mildew refers to certain kinds of mold or fungus. The term mildew is often used generically to refer to mold growth, usually with a flat growth habit. Mildew often lives on shower walls, windowsills, and other places where moisture levels are high.\n\nWhat is \"black mold\"? What is \"toxic mold\"?\n\n\"Black mold\" is not a species or specific kind of mold, and neither is \"toxic mold.\" When the media talk about \"toxic mold\" and \"black mold\", they are usually referring to molds that may produce toxic substances called mycotoxins. Often they are referring to a specific mold called Stachybotrys chartarum. For more information, please consult www.epa.gov/mold."
