        "text": "The information that I was able to see through the 10 Steps! classes was very good and gave me a new perspective about how to live a healthier lifestyle. One important thing I discovered was the number of seemingly healthy foods that in reality are not good for you. I was surprised to find out that some of the snacks I would give to my children had so much sugar! Now that I know what to avoid, I have started to focus on only buying foods I want my family to eat. Now that my kids are used to eating healthier snacks it is easier for them to choose the right option and avoid junk food. The class taught a lot about creating habits, and that is something I have tried to do for my children. I was also very interested by the ideas around routines and food that we learned in class. As a mom it isn’t possible to constantly be cooking for my family, so in order to make sure I don’t spend my whole life in the kitchen I emphasize eating times for my kids. If they get hungry before mealtime I reinforce that we must stick to the routine (and give them whole fruit to eat in the meantime). Even though this can be difficult, I found this to be a great way to avoid falling into the fast-food/sugary drink trap. My kids choose how much to eat, but not where/when. I’m very happy with what I learned through 10 steps!\n\n-Beatriz, Mother\n\nI first heard about the diaper program through FIRST 5 programs at my local FRC. I was pregnant in the beginning of the pandemic and was nervous with stores being closed, not knowing where I will get my baby supplies. I had stopped working and we were living off of just my husband’s income. I was very excited and happy when the staff told me I could register for the free diaper program. She called me over the phone, and the process of registration was fast and easy. Since I was pregnant, I was very cautious about going out and seeing other people. The process of picking up diapers was also very easy and convenient. After the staff told us our appointment day, we would show up at the school’s drive through. There was a phone number for us to call, we told them our name, and they would bring the diapers directly to our trunk without any contact. I felt very safe, and happy because I was one step closer to being ready for my baby’s arrival. I would like to thank the funders for helping my family through the pandemic. Even though it’s just one item, it has made a huge impact on my family. It was very comforting to know that there are still generous donors and funders out there in our community, who still cares about us even through we were going through a global pandemic.\n\n-Huong, Mother\n\nAs a single mother of two sons, I did not know how to provide my kids with all the love and care that they need. Six months ago, my husband passed away because of Covid 19. I was under depression because I have relied on my husband for everything. I was never worried about my children's well-being. My husband took care of all the doctor appointments, medical insurance, and bills. My child has astigmatism on both eyes; however, I did not know until the Healthier Kids Foundation's staff notified me and explained the vision screening results. I was scared about raising a ten years old boy without my husband. Moreover, I sometimes had mental distress and emotional trauma. I could not always have a positive mindset and manage daily aspects promptly. Adding up, I did not know how to schedule an appointment because I could not understand English. I did not know where to bring my child for an eye exam. However, the staff offered to help me schedule an appointment. She helped me to find an optometrist close to my house. Then she followed up with me right after my child’s appointment to ensure that my child received a comprehensive eye exam. I also shared with the staff my concerns regarding raising my children as a single mother. The staff comforted me, let me know that there would be help available anytime for the well-being of my family. I appreciated the great support from the Healthier Kids Foundation’s staff. I never knew another organization that did all the works, like Healthier Kids Foundation. In the future, I hope that the Healthier Kids Foundation will continue providing programs that help all children and parents that need better health and well-being.\n\n-Phuong, Mother"
