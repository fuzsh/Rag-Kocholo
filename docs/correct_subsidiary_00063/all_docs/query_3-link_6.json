        "text": "Originally posted by CryptiniteDemon\n\nOkay forever now I have been wondering what goes on behind the scenes of the networks and stuff.\n\nLike how did the whole foxbox start. What changes or buyouts have ocurred to CN, ABCfamily, Fox, WB, Williams Street, and FUnimation.\n\nCause I constantly hear about them, but I barely know what the hell anyone's talking about.\n\nOkay, I'll tell you what I know.\n\nThe Fox Broadcasting Company was launched in 1986 in a few low-watt markets with one show, The Late Show With Joan Rivers. A year later, the network officially launched with a prime-time lineup. The children's programming division, Fox Kids Network, was founded by Fox Network co-founder Jamie Kellner and launched in September 1990. The block, which aired on weekday mornings, afternoons, and Saturday mornings, had a stranglehold on the unsuspecting populace almost immediately. Over the years, shows like Batman, Eek the Cat, The Tick, Animaniacs, X-Men, and Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers took over the airwaves. Power Rangers' producer, Saban, became such an intrigual part of the company, they bought half of the company, and the company became Fox Kids Worldwide. Worldwide was an understatement as the reformed company took over the world one nation at a time with new Fox Kids networks forming on all points of the globe. In the middle of all of this, Saban also controlled broadcasting blocks on UPN and in syndication. One of the series they bankrolled in syndication was FUNimation's Dragonball Z.\n\nFUNimation Productions, based in Ft. Worth, Texas, was primarily a small local company that sent forgettable children entertainers throughout southwestern America. The company's founder was a fan of Dragonball (it's rumored that he's related to an exec at Toei Animation, animators of Dragonball), and he convinced them to bring the series to America in the fall of 1995. Saban saw the potential of the franchise and bankrolled the second season in the fall of 1996, moving past over 100 episodes of Dragonball and going headfirst into Dragonball Z. Despite its extensive editing and poor timeslots, the series was a hit with the fans. It was also a merchandising cashcow, which FUNimation owned every cent made from licensing. Of course, the egos became intense, and Saban lost interest in the series and stopped production in 1997. Dragonball Z would have been dead in America if not for Cartoon Network.\n\nCN brought the series back from the dead by scheduling them on their young Toonami lineup in August 1998, becoming almost immediately the franchise series. The new episodes every season starting in September 1999 became a huge draw on the block. FUNimation should kiss Cartoon Network's feet (/end opinion), and because of the success of DBZ on Toonami, they brought rights to shows like Blue Gender, Yu Yu Hakusho, Lupin III, and Fruits Basket and tried to buy the rights to YuGiOh. They also found a renewed interest in Dragonball, dubbing new episodes of that series which premiered on Toonami in August 2001. Recently, they got the rights to distribute 4Kids Entertainment projects on Home Video and DVD, including the one that got away, YuGiOh!\n\nIn 1998, Fox Kids Worldwide bought International Family Worldwide, a family entertainment unit spun off from the Christian Broadcasting Network that owned the Ice Capades, MTM Productions, and The U.S. Family Channel (I have to differentiate it for the sake of the Canadian readers because they have a Family Channel up there as well), and merged the bulk of IF into the new Fox Family Worldwide, highlighted by the Fox Family Channel (MTM Productions became a part of Twentieth Television). This purchase marked the beginning of the end of Fox Kids, though viewers didn't see it coming.\n\nFox Family launched a pair of spinoff channels in fall 1999, bChannel and gChannel, which were aimed toward gender-based audiences. The channels had original programs as well as shows that had been in storage like Spider-Man and The Tick. The gender-based channels failed to click with subscribers and cable operators, so they pulled the plug in the fall of 2000. However, that didn't stop them from continuing the gender-based programming. Boy-themed shows became prevalent on Fox Kids while girl-based shows ruled on Fox Family. Audiences waned, and the powers that be wanted to drop the whole thing, so, in the winter of 2000, Fox Family was put up for sale. Some say they sold it because they wanted to get rid of the lagging properties while others said that they wanted to get rid of it because Fox owner/walking contradiction Rupert Murdoch wanted to buy DirecTV. In the summer of 2001, The Walt Disney Company bought Fox Family Worldwide, and the end was definitely near. By the end of 2001, Fox Kids no longer aired on weekdays and Fox Family was now ABC Family. The final nail of the Fox Kids empire was hammered on September 7, 2002, the final day of broadcasting for the Fox Kids network, making way for the Fox Box.\n\nFox Box is a four-hour programming block produced by 4Kids Entertainment, a New York-based production company that imports anime series like Tama and Friends, Yu-Gi-Oh!, and Pokemon and CG productions like Cubix. 4Kids is also a licenser of Marvel, WWE, and Nintendo properties, and in the 80's, was known as Leisure Concepts,who helped develop the marketability of shows like Thundercats and toylines like M.U.S.C.L.E., which will return on the Fox Box as Ultimate Muscle. The Fox Box is owned by Fox Broadcasting Company, but they don't program it.\n\nThe Cartoon Network was planned in the fall of 1991 by Turner Broadcasting and launched on October 1, 1992. The network's initital programming was crafted from the extensive Turner library, which included the entire Hanna-Barbera company, pre-1948 WB shorts, MGM shorts, and other shorts. In 1994, Cartoon Network went on a talent search to look for new shorts which could evolve into a regular series. Around the same time, Cartoon Network created a production company to create a strange talk show. Ghost Planet Industries was born, and Space Ghost Coast To Coast was launched. In the spring of 1995, the first of the What a Cartoon shorts premiered in a simulcast on Cartoon Network, TNT, and TBS. In July 1995, media company Time-Warner purchases Turner Broadcasting and a media giant was reborn. In '96, when the merger was completed, more Warner Bros.-owned programming was appearing on the network.\n\nOn March 17, 1997, Ghost Planet Industries, now known as Williams Street Productions, launched their first Cartoon Network programming block, Toonami. Hosted by SGC2C controller Moltar, the block showcased the network's acquired shows, including Warner Bros.-owned Thundercats, Voltron, and the Hanna-Barbera production The Real Adventures of Jonny Quest as well as a few classic action-animation shorts from the Turner library. The block evolved into a showcase for anime hits and action animation and becoming a more global entity, expanding throughout Europe, Australia, Africa, Latin America, and Japan. The block's success gave Williams Street a little more power within the network. Heck, Mike Lazzo, a Vice-Chairman, is a Williams Street vet. The second Williams Street block, Adult Swim, has become as successful as Toonami, with a comedy block launching in September 2001 and an anime/action block launching in February 2002. Of course, things within Cartoon Network were a bit complicated thanks to a coup within the Turner ranks in February 2001, immediately after Time-Warner's merger with AOL was completed.\n\nKids' WB was founded in fall 1995 by Jamie Kellner as part of his WB Television Network, a weblet launched in January 1996 with Warner Bros. owning a majority stake, Tribune owning a lower stake, and Kellner owning a smaller, yet more significant stake. Shows came and went over the first four years, but things really came to a head with Kellner and Tribune. Tribune was forced to drop WB programming from their marquee cable network, WGN, in October 1999. Kids' WB also relied more on outside productions like Pokemon than productions from Warner Bros. Animation, which they embraced in their first years (the WB watertower, a mainstay on Animaniacs, still remains as a network identity icon). In the fall of 2001, 95% of the initial programming came from outside WBA. Around this time, Kellner, now President and CEO of Turner, created a synergy unit between his Kids' WB and Cartoon Network that would create a cohesive unit advertising both properties equally. At least that sounded good on paper. Instead of being considered as equals, Kids' WB basically stole elements from Cartoon Network without giving credit back to Cartoon Network. Toonami aired on Kids' WB without even a plug to the Cartoon Network version on-air and on-line, and Powerpuff Girls were basically seen as a Kids' WB series to those that have never seen it on Cartoon Network. Scooby-Doo, once a mainstay of Cartoon Network, now has new episodes premiering exclusively on Kids' WB rather than Cartoon Network. These kind of things soured the relationship between Kids' WB and Cartoon Network.\n\nLike I said, this is everything I know.\n\nOriginally posted by Andy505\n\nOh, and when will the next \"Watch this Space\" be on CNX?\n\nThe next Watch This Space will be on the site as soon as the server move is complete at Toon Zone and I get my new server info. Got an itchy trigger finger, and I'm ready to get back into action.\n\nOriginally posted by jetwing5\n\nWow, you just wrote 5 pages of the companies' history (double space, 12 font). That's amazing. Although it is biased, it's very good. Say, can you tell me the history of 4Kids? I know they turned popular when Pokemon started, but before that, I don't anything about them.\n\nBiased?\n\nBiased?!?\n\n*clears throat* Admittedly, I don't know THAT much about 4Kids Entertainment. The only thing I know is that 4Kids began life as Leisure Concepts, Inc. in the early 80s. Basically Leisure Concepts is more or less \"a property manager,\" meaning that they're basically doing everything to promote properties owned by outside companies. They helped to create the promotional look of the World Wrestling Federation in the mid-80s and continues to have a relationship with the company. In 1983, their second high-profile assignment was to co-develop the Thundercats series for Rankin-Bass and Telepictures Distribution. Basically, by working alongside Thundercats creator, the late Ted Wolf, LCI helped make the Thundercats a little more marketable to the general public as well managed the marketing of items based on the Thundercats franchise, including the popular Marvel comics and the LJN action figures. By working with Marvel to help market Thundercats, the comic publisher also saw a potential partner to help market their franchises, including introducing Marvel to a new, struggling action figure maker, Toy Biz.\n\nLeisure Concepts kept a low profile in the early 90s, though they still helped license WWF, Marvel, and Nintendo franchises. In the mid-90s, Nintendo launched a new franchise that had the potential to be big, Pocket Monsters, and LCI was on tap to help bring it to America. However, since that infamous seizure episode of the Pocket Monsters animated series, a lot of studios and distributors that would have intitially released it here, like Saban and DiC. Strangely, Leisure Concepts decided to bring the series to America by editing and producing the translation themselves, as a new production company, 4Kids Entertainment. Pocket Monsters, marketed as Pokemon in North America, premiered in September 1998 and, like gangbusters, was a hit. The show was a hit, and everything that had the Pokemon name on it, including the games, sold out.\n\nIn Spring 1999, the Kids' WB block brought Pokemon to Saturday mornings where it slowly became the marquee show for the weblet. In the fall of 1999, 4Kids Entertainment and Warner Bros. brought Pokemon to the big screen, where it had a very high opening weekend. Many media analysts started to notice 4Kids' considerable clout in the world of entertainment. As the Pokemania was dwindling down, 4Kids began to think outside the Pokeball. In 2000, they got the licencing rights to a pair of franchises from the 80s, M.U.S.C.L.E. and Thundercats. They tried to buy Thundercats outright, but Warner Bros. refused to give away that franchise. This is probably one of the reasons why 4Kids pursued that Fox lineup. Throughout 2001, they premiered three different shows; Cubix, Tama and Friends, and Yu-Gi-Oh, the latter of which is becoming just as popular as Pokemon.\n\nIn the throughout the remainder of 2001 and the first quarter of 2002, 4Kids began more manuvering in the entertainment world. 4Kids licensed the Pokemon movies to Miramax Pictures and they snagged rights to program the Fox Saturday Morning lineup, partnering up with DiC Entertainment, who was trying to buy it themselves. 4Kids may be small, but they're growing through leaps and bounds.\n\nBiased?!?"
