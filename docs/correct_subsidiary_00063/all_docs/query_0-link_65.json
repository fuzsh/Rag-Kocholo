        "text": "Movies Under the Stars, presented by the Calcasieu Parish Police Jury in Lake Charles, is a great way to get family time on a budget. Grabbing a few blankets and lawn chairs doesn't cost anything, and heading out to the park, right? It's a great time, and best of all, it's free!\n\nMovies usually begin at 6:30 p.m. or around dusk (times vary during the summer.) As a rule of thumb, you always want to arrive a little early anyway to allow for parking and to get a good spot. Feel free to bring your own food and snacks, but FYI, snacks will be provided, including popcorn and cotton candy, in addition to food trucks from local vendors.\n\nPlease note that the movie presentations are at a different locations. See featured presentations locations and schedules for July 12 and July 19 are below:\n\nFriday, July 12 – “Cars” - 2006 (Rated G)\n\nThis movie will be shown at Prien Lake Park, 3700 West Prien Lake Road.\n\nFriday, July 19 – \"Toy Story” - 1995 (Rated G)\n\nThis movie will be shown at River Bluff Park, 543 Theriot Road, Moss Bluff.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: Movies will be canceled in the event of inclement weather. Cancellations will be announced before the event on the Calcasieu Parish Police Jury’s website at calcasieu.gov and on CPPJ’s Facebook and Instagram pages."
