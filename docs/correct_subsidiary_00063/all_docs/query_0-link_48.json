        "text": "ABC Cable Networks, Fox Kids Europe and Fox Kids Latin America have teamed up to launch Jetix, a joint kids programming worldwide alliance that will feature original, acquired and library action/adventure series for kids to reach a combined 137 million television households in 77 countries and in 18 languages.\n\nFeaturing such popular action programs such as POWER RANGERS, Jetix programming blocks will debut in the U.S. in February 2004, with morning programming on ABC Family and primetime shows on Toon Disney.\n\nJetix blocks on Fox Kids channels will start up in April in Europe and the Middle East. These channels are scheduled to be renamed Jetix channels in fall 2004 while Fox Kids outlets in Latin America will become Jetix in midyear.\n\nThe unique name Jetix was developed, and researched with children, with the goal of finding a word that implied action and adventure and yet could be used in a number of international markets without being a proper name for something else.\n\nAnne Sweeney, president of ABC Cable Networks Group and Disney Channel Worldwide calls Jetix, \"a strategic, ad-supported complement to Disney-branded television around the world, including our 22 Disney Channels.\"\n\nBruce Steinberg, chairman/ceo of Fox Kids Europe said, \"Jetix propels Fox Kids' offering of high-energy entertainment to a worldwide kids audience. This will strengthen Fox Kids Europe's partnership with Disney and enable us to develop exciting original programming to bring to this expanded audience and continue our success as the leading pan-European kids action-adventure entertainment company. We will build on this new alliance to continue to successfully leverage our programming library through our channels, consumer products, program distribution and online and interactive businesses.\""
