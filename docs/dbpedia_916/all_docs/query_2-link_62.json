        "text": "A teenage schoolgirl was hit by a train and killed at a railway station.\n\nShe has been named locally as 13-year-old Heather Still.\n\nPolice and paramedics were called to the station in the Glasgow suburb of Whitecraigs just after 2pm but were unable to save the girl’s life.\n\nShe was pronounced dead at the scene.\n\nInitial reports suggested she was with her mum and sister when she was struck and they witnessed the tragedy.\n\nBut that was later contradicted by an official statement released by British Transport Police.\n\nIn a statement, her family said: \"We are completely devastated at the senseless loss of our beautiful and much loved daughter and sister, Heather, and words cannot express our pain and despair.\n\n\"We would also like to thank everyone for their kind messages and support that we have received and also request that our privacy be respected at this incredibly difficult time.\"\n\nHeather was a pupil at Mearns Castle High School in Newton Mearns, East Renfrewshire.\n\nHeadteacher Dean Smith said: \"We are deeply saddened by the tragic news of the loss of a bright and popular pupil, Heather Still.\n\n\"This is a time of profound sadness for our school community and we are concentrating on providing support to our pupils and staff who are understandably shocked and upset.\n\n\"We ask for privacy for the family and for the school to allow us to make sense of this loss. Our thoughts are with Heather's family.\"\n\nA BTP spokeswoman said the death was not thought to be suspicious and trains were back running through the station around two hours after the incident.\n\nShe said: “Officers were called to Whitecraigs railway station on Tuesday after a report that a girl had been struck by a train.\n\n“Officers from Police Scotland attended and this was reported to British Transport Police at 2.12pm.\n\n“Paramedics from the Scottish Ambulance Service attended but the girl was pronounced dead at the scene.\n\n“The incident is being treated as non-suspicious and a report will be submitted to the fiscal.\n\n“Officers are working to identify the girl and inform her parents.”\n\nTributes were paid to the teenager by shocked local residents on Twitter yesterday.\n\nAmong those expressing their condolences was Tory MSP Jackson Carlaw, who lives locally.\n\nCarlaw tweeted: “Saddened and shocked to hear of the death of a teenager who was struck by a train this afternoon at Whitecraigs railway station.”\n\nGavin Ross wrote: “So sad to hear about the girl killed by a train at Whitecraigs today, for some reason tragedies emanate stronger feelings when closer 2 home.”\n\nAnna McGinness tweeted: “Rip to the 13-year-old girl who got struck by a train today at Whitecraigs station.”\n\nCia wrote: “Just heard a young girl got hit by a train at Whitecraigs station today. Absolutely tragic, wish people knew to get help.”"
