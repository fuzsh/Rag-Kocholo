        "text": "I was born in Ipswich in 1917. I lived with my mother and father and my three brothers, Jack, Harry and Eric and my two sisters Muriel and Molly. We had relatives who owned a farm, so I helped out a lot on it. My dad was a carpenter, and mum ran the house. We were never rich people, we didn’t have a lot of money, but that’s the way life was then, and we just accepted it and made our own fun.\n\nWhen I grew up, I was a carpenter to trade. I fixed the ships during the war, so I wasn’t sent to fight because I was an essential worker. During the war we had to ration food and other supplies, but we managed, there was always enough, my mum was a good cook and knew how to make things last, people were much better at that in those days.\n\nI don’t remember much about about the Spanish Flu, but people were in isolation like they are now with the Coronavirus pandemic, and the hospitals were full. We have to do what we can to help in our own way, even if, and especially when, we face difficult times.\n\nMy wife Mary was from Stornoway. We met in St Enoch Square after I had asked her for directions for the bus. After she had told me the directions, Mary asked me when would I be taking her out again. I was in the Navy by then. Mary and I fell in love and we got married and had eleven children together, Arthur, Catherine, David, Irene, Roy, Graham, Margaret, Doreen, Elizabeth, Muriel and Philip. I know that sound like a lot of kids to keep track of and look after, but we didn’t have them all at once, so it wasn’t so bad. I would take the kids berry picking a few times a week and Mary made jam and berry pies. I played football and cricket with the boys and tennis with the girls, I played games with them a lot, there was a lot of fun going on. We have twenty grandchildren, and I think about sixteen great grandchildren - so just a small family, I’d say.\n\nI was a police officer both here and in Norwich. In those days, my job was, if you saw a lawbreaker, you took them in. I retired from the police force in 1977, but I then started taking statements for the police, and I still get correspondence from them to this day – the police not the lawbreakers.\n\nI always loved listening to classical music, but unfortunately I have lost my hearing now, well I am 102.\n\nI’m also a bit of a fitness maniac. I played football for school and the boys brigade, and tennis and I still do my exercises every morning.\n\nNow I live in Renaissance Care’s Whitecraigs Care Home, and my best friend here, is the nurse Laura, she makes me laugh a lot. I still have a good sense of humour. At Halloween, I dressed up as a chimney sweep and Laura dressed up as Mary Poppins, we make quite a double act us two.\n\nI don’t have a secret to a long life, I’ve always enjoyed mine and I still do. To be truthful with you, I don’t feel any different now than I did at 22."
