In many areas parish boundaries have changed significantly over the years. You can click on the 1951 parish outlines to get to individual parish maps.\n\nThe parishes of 1890 appear as they were before considerable boundary changes which took place the following year, including the removal of divided parishes and outliers.\n\nThe parishes of 1951 were the result of important changes in 1891 and in 1929 (when parishes lost their administrative function), making them considerably different from 1890. Unfortunately the only maps from which these boundaries could be digitised were of small scale and therefore they appear simplified compared to reality.\n\nThe parishes of 1991 are generally rather better digitised than those of 1951, but there are relatively few changes.\n\nThe parishes of 2001 include some significant changes, reflecting their change in use to purely statistical units. These boundaries were compiled by government as a best-fit aggregation of 2001 census output areas."
