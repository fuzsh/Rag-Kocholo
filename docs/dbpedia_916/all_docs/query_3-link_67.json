        "text": "Whitecraigs railway station serves the Whitecraigs and Davieland areas of Giffnock and Newton Mearns, East Renfrewshire, Scotland. The station lies on the Neilston branch of the Cathcart Circle Line. The line here forms the boundary which separates Newton Mearns & Giffnock.\n\nStation History\n\nWhitecraigs station was opened on 1 May 1903 by the London, Midland and Scottish Railway on the former Lanarkshire and Ayrshire Railway. In some timetables the station was known as Whitecraigs for Rouken Glen.\n\nThe line was electrified in 1962 and for many years train services were mainly provided by Class 303 \"Blue Train\" electric multiple units.\n\nIn 1983 Strathclyde PTE proposed the closure of Whitecraigs as well as Patterton and Neilston stations, all these stations were reprieved."
