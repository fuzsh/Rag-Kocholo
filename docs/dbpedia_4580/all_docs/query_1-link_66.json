        "text": "From tracing the spread of invasive lionfish to examining an outlier leopard shark collected 155 miles north of its normal range, researchers can tap into information previously accessible only by visiting individual collections in person or online or by borrowing specimens.\n\nScientists are using the data to explore a variety of questions, including how museum records and the field notes of Henry David Thoreau document the shift in New England’s fruit season under a changing climate; the ways in which chemical cues in bat hair serve as a travel log to uncover their migration pathway; and whether pollinator communities return when their natural habitats are restored.\n\niDigBio’s major achievements also include assembling a growing network of more than 300 museums and academic institutions and training their collections staff how to fold digitization into standard curation protocols. As new digitization techniques emerge, such as 3D imaging and CT scanning, iDigBio has evolved in step.\n\n“iDigBio has brought the museum community together and allowed us to work with one another in ways that weren’t possible before,” Nelson said.\n\nEngaging community scientists to help upload specimen information has allowed the project to scale up, said botanist Austin Mast, a co-principal investigator on the grant and professor at Florida State University, a key iDigBio partner. Currently, the iDigBio portal contains more than 130 million specimen records, representing an estimated 400 million museum specimens.\n\n“With the new NSF funding, ‘sustainability’ is now iDigBio’s middle name,” Mast said. “We will continue to focus on building long-term plans for sustaining high-value activities, both at iDigBio and in our broader community of collections that are creating and managing digital data about their specimens.”\n\nArizona State University and its Symbiota software package, under the direction of Nico Franz with co-leaders Edward Gilbert and California Polytechnic State University’s Jenn Yost, is joining iDigBio as its newest partner. Symbiota provides tools for communities to build their own portals for specimen and observation-based information, including maps of where species live, specimen images and interactive identification keys. The Symbiota hub accounts for about 20 million specimen records in iDigBio’s database.\n\niDigBio also will continue to connect students and early career scientists with natural history collections. The program will expand its development of learning activities and provide skill building to support underrepresented students, as well as host an annual conference for high school and undergraduate students to introduce them to careers in biological sciences.\n\nNelson said the presence of the Florida Museum made UF a natural homebase for the program.\n\n“We’ve got one of the best natural history museums in the country, and we’ve had nothing but good support from the university and the provost and vice president for research,” he said. “[Former iDigBio Director] Larry Page built a strong team during his directorship, and Doug Jones has been fantastic. He helps us out in any way he can.”\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the importance of the digital data and virtual connections offered by iDigBio, as scientists and educators turned to online resources during lockdowns. In March of 2020, the iDigBio team rapidly shifted its focus to enhancing and expanding virtual platforms, activities and techniques, a pivot that resulted in one of the project’s most productive years.\n\n“Now, everybody realizes that online access is really even more critical than we thought,” said Steven Ellis, iDigBio’s NSF program officer. “We’re starting to better leverage digitized resources and the kinds of opportunities they represent.”\n\nStill, digitization doesn’t diminish the value of curating physical specimens, Nelson said.\n\n“Specimens are one small step away from biodiversity in nature. Without collections, we don’t have the ability to return to a specimen to examine it more closely. Even with good observations, images and records, there’s no replacement for the actual specimen. You just can’t lose that.”"
