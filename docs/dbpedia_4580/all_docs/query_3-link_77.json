First edition of this translation, but probably a later printing. Twenty-seven stories based on European and Middle-eastern folklore by a noted French lawyer and man of letters who wrote a number of works on American history and politics and who, according to his translator, had never visited the nation he considered to be \"the future of civilization\" and \"the future of liberty.\" He admired the American Constitution and proposed France's gift of the Statute of Liberty.

Cloth worn at spine ends and corners, a couple of spots on cloth, a sound, good copy. (#167780).\n\nPrice: $35.00"
