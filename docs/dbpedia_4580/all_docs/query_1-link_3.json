        "text": "New genera and species records of Nicaraguan Eumolpinae\n\nThe confirmed presence of Caryonoda funebris n. sp. in Nicaragua represents the first formal record for this genus in Nicaragua, but also in Central America. But in the course of our work in Nicaragua, we found several other new genera and species records, in this case for the country. The list below reports these findings with commentaries about the species, their identification, and their distributions, and provides illustrations to help interpreting our findings in future studies.\n\nAllocolaspis grandicollis (Blake, 1976a )\n\n(Figs. , )\n\nNew species record: JGZC: (1) male (JGZC-1236), Rivas, Cárdenas, Finca Sierra Serena, 11.234449 -85.5539179, 66 m, 14 July 2010, J.-M.

Hernández leg.\n\nAllocolaspis Bechyné 1950a, as currently defined, is a genus with species distributed in northern South America, Central America south from Guatemala, and the Antilles (Bechyné 1953; Flowers 1996). Fourteen species were reported from the region of interest, with one of them endemic from Nicaragua, A. belti (Jacoby 1881), and the only record of the genus in the country. The current species, originally described from Panama, and confirmed studying the penis (Fig. ) of the only specimen collected in Nicaragua (Fig. ), would be the second registered species of Allocolaspis in this country.\n\nAntitypona submetallica (Jacoby, 1890 )\n\n(Figs. , )\n\nNew species record: JGZC: male (JGZC-1211), Granada, Reserva Silvestre Privada Domitila, May 2010, J.-M. Maes leg., Antitypona submetallica (Jac.) J. Gómez-Zurita det. 2022.\n\nThere is some confusion about the limits between the genera Antitypona and Lamprosphaerus, two genera of typically small, roundish, and metallic beetles with a facies similar to Spintherophyta and Brachypnoea, but without clavate antennae. Both genera can be somewhat distinguished by the shape of hypomera, longitudinally indented in Lamprosphaerus and relatively convex in Antitypona (Weise 1921), and also by the degree of inclination of epipleura, horizontal in Lamprosphaerus and slanted, visible laterally in Antitypona (Flowers 1996). A single male specimen from Nicaragua (nearly 3 mm long) is very similar to the female type specimen of A. submetallica (Jacoby, 1890) except in the marked dorsal metallic green color and the antennae more slender and nearly entirely pale (except last antennomere), but the latter also show the enlarged pedicel and short and fine antennomeres 3–4 as in the type and the same fine punctation on head and pronotum over microreticulated background (Fig. ). This male is tentatively classified as Jacoby’s species, also taking into account that all the other species of Antitypona, except the characteristic A. apicalis (> 3.5 mm), are much smaller (< 2.6 mm), but the penis is figured to allow for future assessment of our interpretation (Fig. ). The species is known from Costa Rica and Panama (Flowers 1996), and the Nicaraguan record would extend the range of the species to the north.\n\nBrachypnoea modesta animatoria (Bechyné, 1953 )\n\n(Figs. , , )\n\nNew species record: JGZC: 2 females (JGZC-1299 and 1313) and 2 males (JGZC-1314 and 1315), Rivas, Sapoa, Finca Guadalupe, 11.179983 -85.6807925, 15 September 2009, J.-M. Maes leg., Brachypnoea modesta animatoria (Bech.) J. Gómez-Zurita det. 2022.\n\nBrachypnoea Gistel, 1848 is one of the most diverse genera of Central American Eumolpinae, also in Nicaragua, where five species were reported so far (Maes and Staines 1991). The new specimens of Brachypnoea collected in Nicaragua belong to an informal group of species that could be characterized by small size (around 3.0 mm or less), fulvous antennae and legs, as well as the presence of tubercles and costae on the elytra of females, among other traits. A particular feature of these specimens is that they have fulvous tibiae and tarsi, but dark femora, which is a combination not that commonly seen in Brachypnoea. B. thoracica (Jacoby, 1881) and B. opacicollis (Jacoby, 1890) from Mexico show bicolor legs, but they have the antennae with apical antennomeres dark and females lack basal tubercles on elytra, and they have differences in texture and punctation of pronotum as compared to the Nicaraguan specimens (B. thoracica is much larger too). B. boucardi (Jacoby, 1878) from Guatemala, another species with pale tibiae and tarsi, is not that different to the insects from Nicaragua, but the species was described as having dark apical antennomeres and the type material in the Museum of Comparative Zoology, a male, possibly the holotype, shows differences in the punctation of pronotum and elytra, which also have faint apical costae, missing in the Nicaraguan males. Moreover, Bechyné (1955) subordinated B. boucardi to B. lefevrei (Jacoby, 1878), which in case that this was a sound assessment, it would imply that the females lack tubercles on elytra, unlike the specimens from Nicaragua. B. fulvicornis (Jacoby, 1890) from Mexico occasionally has darker femora, but this species has dull pronotum with very fine punctation, compared to the Nicaraguan specimens. Something very similar could be said for B. parvula (Jacoby, 1890) from Panama, typically having bicolor legs, but fine, dull sculpture on pronotum. However, B. parvula belongs to an unstable taxonomic complex that has experienced some changes in rank and combination, including the incorporation of traits that fit the Nicaraguan specimens. For example, Bechyné (1953) described B. parvula animatoria from Costa Rica and Guatemala, precisely highlighting the stronger punctation on pronotum of these specimens compared to typical B. parvula. Later, Bechyné (1955) subordinated B. parvula to B. modesta (Lefèvre, 1878), a species characterized by the presence of a tubercle posterior to the prebasal depression of elytra, present in the Nicaraguan specimens (Fig. ). Based on these considerations, we are inclined to agree with the taxonomic solution adopted by Flowers (1996), considering the combination B. modesta animatoria, where we refer our Nicaraguan specimens, thus adding an intermediate locality to the current disjunct distribution between Guatemala and Costa Rica. With the aim to assist future reanalysis of these taxa and how they relate to each other, we provide with illustrations of the male genitalia (Fig. ) and spermatheca (Fig. ).\n\nChrysodinopsis cupriceps (Lefèvre, 1877 ) n. comb.\n\nChrysodina cupriceps Lefèvre, 1877\n\n(Figs. , , )\n\nNew species record: JGZC: (1) female (JGZC-1375), Estelí, Reserva Natrual Miraflor, Finca Beylla Vista, Mirador Los Cerritos, 13.263 -86.2293 [118], July 2010, A.

Maes leg., Chrysodinopsis cupriceps (Lef.) J. Gómez-Zurita det. 2022.\n\nJacoby (1890) reflected on Chrysodina cupriceps and suggested that it may be better placed with Noda curtula, and both in his Noda (currently, Brachypnoea), based on their morphological similarities. Bechyné (1950b) created the monotypic genus Chrysodinopsis for N. curtula based on differences in the shape of elytra and epipleura relative to typical Brachypnoea, and later transferred N. basalis to this genus too (Bechyné 1957), while retaining C. cupriceps in Chrysodina (Bechyné 1953). Flowers (1996) respected the limits to Chrysodinopsis established by Bechyné (1957) and transferred C. cupriceps to Brachypnoea. Van Roie et al. (2019) reported C. cupriceps from El Salvador, placing it in the genus Chrysodinopsis, but without justification. After comparing C. cupriceps with C. curtula, we agree with Jacoby’s (1890) original assessment on the strong morphological similarity between both species, including slightly flattened apex of elytra in the only male examined. While the validity of Chrysodinopsis remains unchallenged, both species should be placed in the same genus based on their morphological proximity; thus, we formalize the new combination here. Previously reported from El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Mexico (Flowers 1996; Van Roie et al. 2019), the presence of C. cupriceps in Nicaragua would extent the range of the species considerably to the south. Nicaraguan specimens range from cupreous to metallic green, blue, purple, and almost black, sometimes with slight differences in the hue of pronotum and elytra, but the head is always of a different color compared to the rest of the body (Fig. ). We illustrate the penis and the spermatheca of the species for future comparisons (Figs. and ).\n\nColaspis jalapae (Bechyné, 1950c )\n\n(Figs. , , )\n\nNew species record: JGZC: (1) male (JGZC-1790), Estelí, Reserva Natural Miraflor, 13°13′16″N 86°14′56″W, 1389 m, 10 September 2011, on Solanum myriacanthum, J.-M.

Hernández leg.\n\nThe genus Colaspis Fabricius, 1801 (the Maecolaspis Bechyné, 1950b of most Neotropical catalogs; also in Maes and Staines 1991) is definitely one of the most diverse genera of American Eumolpinae. The genus is well represented in Nicaragua, where at least seven species were reported (Maes and Staines 1991). Here, we report a new species of Colaspis from Nicaragua that belongs in the bulk of very similar species occurring throughout America, and highly diverse in Central America, typically characterized by bright metallic green dorsum and fulvous legs and antennae, and very difficult taxonomically, since most species are very similar externally (Bechyné 1950c). C. jalapae was described from Veracruz (Mexico) and has not been reported anywhere else; thus, the presence of the species in Nicaragua would represent a significant expansion of the known range. Given the taxonomic difficulties of this group, there is a chance that the identification of Nicaraguan specimens is wrong, but these large (6.4–7.2 mm) and brightly colored specimens, even though they are not as big as reported in the original description (i.e., 8 mm), share the most important traits with the Mexican species, as to leave little doubt about their identification or, at the very least, their taxonomic proximity. Some of these traits include the darkened interstitial antennomeres and also the abrupt median enlargement of male metatibiae (Bechyné 1950c). One female specimen as well as the male genitalia and the spermatheca are illustrated for future reference (Figs. , , ).\n\nMegascelis spinipes (Jacoby, 1888)\n\n(Figs. , , )\n\nNew species record: JGZC: (1) female (JGZC-1490), Estelí, Reserva Natural Miraflor, Finca Las Flores, 13.189271 -86.325221, 926 m, March 2010, A. del Socorro & B.

Maes leg.\n\nThis is a member of another large, taxonomically complicated group of mostly Neotropical Eumolpinae (Lacordaire 1845), which is also relatively diverse in Nicaragua, where up to four species have been reported so far (Maes and Staines 1991). This would be the first Nicaraguan report of M. spinipes, a species cited from Guatemala and southern Mexico (Flowers 1996), and we are confident on our identification based on the male, displaying a pronounced tooth in metafemora (Fig. ), and two female specimens (Fig. ) compared with one of the species syntypes in the Museum of Comparative Zoology (Harvard, USA). There are several distinguishing traits for the species, apart from the notorious metafemoral modification in males, including the dark, relatively dull green color of dorsum with a broad ocher lateral stripe on elytra, tight transverse punctures and dense golden pubescence of elytra, or the finely transversely rugose texture of pronotum among others. We also illustrate the spermatheca of the species (Fig. ), which would have a much larger range than originally assumed.\n\nMetachroma panamense (Blake, 1970 )\n\n(Figs. , )\n\nNew species record: JGZC: female (JGZC-2594), León, Salinas Grandes, Reserva Natural Isla de Juan Venado, 12.27217 -86.88130, 36 m, 24 January 2012, J.

Staines det. 1993.\n\nMetachroma Chevrolat, 1836 was comprehensively revised by Blake (1970) and she raised the number of species found in Central America from twelve up to 25 species, most of them from Mexico, and three of them reported from Nicaragua already (Maes and Staines 1991). M. panamense is a species originally described from Panama, as the name suggests, and characterized by the presence of four dark spots on the pronotum, vittate elytra, and differences in punctation and sculpture on pronotum and elytra compared to other species with spotted pronotum, as well as the lack of convex lateral intervals in female elytra (Blake 1970). The specimen from Nicaragua fits the description of M. panamense in most respects, including the relatively short inner appendix of bifid claws, the presence of median dark spots on disc of elytra close (actually fused) to suture, pale margins of pronotum and scutellum, and a relatively small size (length of female = 4.1 mm). However, the specimen also shares some traits with M. clarkei Blake, 1970, a larger Mexican species described from Yucatan, but very similar externally to M. panamense, although they present some distinctive traits which are present in the Nicaraguan specimen. These would include darkened apical antennomeres, presence of subhumeral and median dark spots fused to lateral margin of elytra, the prominent spots on elytra with sutural stripe enlarged behind scutellum, or the relatively strong punctation on elytra, attenuated apically, but clearly distinct on disc. Both species apparently have very similar male genitalia, based on Blake’s (1970) illustrations, and it is entirely possible that they are indeed conspecific. However, until the genus is revised again with more data, we are inclined to consider the Nicaraguan record akin to the Panamanian, rather than the Mexican taxon.

Hernández leg., Nodocolaspis femoralis M. Geiser det. 2020.\n\nThis species was originally described in the genus Colaspis and it is reminiscent of the informal group of C. melancholica, as defined by Blake (1976b), characterized by species of nearly black dorsum with traces of metallic shine and strong, dense dorsal punctation. However, it was transferred to the genus Nodocolaspis Bechyné, 1949 by Bechyné (1953), who recognized the synonymy with Colaspis rufofemorata Lefèvre, 1884 and the proximity of the species to N. tarsata (Lefèvre, 1882), the latter clearly in the genus Nodocolapis according to this author, based on the shape of prosternum, antennae and male protarsi. Subsequent authors, such as Flowers (1996), disregarded this taxonomic decision although expressed doubts about the correct placement of Colaspis femoralis. We agree with the interpretation by Bechyné (1953) and retain his classification to emphasize the position of this species outside of the genus Colaspis. The species is known from Colombia, Venezuela, Panama, and the State of Amazonas in Brasil (Lefèvre 1878, 1884; Jacoby 1890; Bechyné 1955, 1958), and it shows some variability in the coloration of legs (Bechyné 1953), including red femora and tibiae, red femora and black tibiae, or red femora with black apex and black tibiae, the latter corresponding to the type of C. rufofemorata, the variant we found in Nicaragua (Fig. ) and also reported by Jacoby (1890) from Panama. If the conspecificity of specimens from the Amazonas to Nicaragua were confirmed, this would be one of the species of American Eumolpinae with a larger range across the Isthmus of Panama. We illustrate the penis (Fig. ) and spermatheca (Fig. ) of this species for the first time.\n\nParia nigritarsis (Jacoby, 1882)\n\n(Figs. , )\n\nNew genus and species record: JGZC: female (JGZC-2596), Rivas, Cárdenas, Finca Isla Vista, 11.23345 -85.55123, 56 m, 8 February 2012, A. Cardoso, G. De la Cadena & A. Papadopoulou leg., Paria nigritarsis Jac. J. Gómez-Zurita det. 2022.\n\nParia LeConte, 1858 is a genus relatively diverse in North America and with some twenty species in the Neotropics (Bechyné 1953). In Central America, there are records for only half a dozen species and it has not been reported from Nicaragua so far (Flowers 1996). This would be the first country record of Paria, corresponding to one species that was known from Guatemala and Panama, thus providing an intermediate occurrence that suggests a more continuous distribution in tropical Mesoamerica. The specimens from Nicaragua conform to the type and description of P. nigritarsis, except for their pale tarsi. However, this seems to be a polymorphic trait in the species, considering that Jacoby (1891) already reported that the specimens he had seen from Panama also had pale tarsi. The cephalic traits of this species, including the narrow supraocular furrow and the broad, flat area of frontoclypeus between antennae clearly refer the species to the genus Paria. We provide with illustrations of habitus (Fig. ) and spermatheca (Fig. ).\n\nRhabdopterus uncotibialis (Blake, 1976a)\n\n(Figs. , , )\n\nNew species record: JGZC: (1) female (JGZC-1226), Atlántico Norte, cra. a Siuna, Empalme-Coperna, Puente Baka, June 2009, Fr.

Most species were described by Jacoby (1882) as Rhabdophorus, and a few were described by Blake (1976a), who interpreted them as semicostate Colaspis (Flowers 1996). The species of Rhabdopterus often present species-specific color patterns in their antennae, with different sets of alternating pale and dark antennomeres. The specimens from Nicaragua clearly have the seventh (and to some extent the sixth as well) and three apical antennomeres dark, which is a very unusual combination. As far as we know, this pattern has only been described for R. uncotibialis, a species currently known from Panama thus far, and the Nicaraguan specimens (Fig. ) fit the description of this species in every other detail, including the size above 5.5 mm. Interestingly, it is not possible to reach this species using Blake’s (1976a) key because she considered different length proportions of pronotum and elytra as observed in the Nicaraguan specimens, which have elytra three or more times longer than pronotum. This trait would lead to R. panamensis (Blake, 1976a) instead, which is admittedly similar to R. uncotibialis, but clearly smaller (< 5 mm) and lacks the characteristic color pattern of the antennae (Blake 1976a). Moreover, the penis of the Nicaraguan male specimen (Fig. ) has the characteristic angulate preapical margin of R. uncotibialis, instead of the gradually narrowed apical margin that Blake (1976a) described for R. panamensis. The availability of females allows illustrating the spermatheca of the species (Fig. ), and our new records considerably expand the range of the species northward.\n\nSpintherophyta ignita (Lefèvre, 1877 )\n\n(Figs. , )\n\nNew species record: JGZC: female (JGZC-1304), Río San Juan, El Castillo, refugio Bartola, 10°58′37.19″N 84°20′12.33″W, 79 m, 3–6 November 2008, J.-M. Maes leg., Spintherophyta ignita (Lef.) J. Gómez-Zurita det. 2022.\n\nLefèvre (1877) described Chrysodina ignita, one of the largest (4.0–4.5 mm) species of Chrysodina, of golden purple color, with metallic legs and four basal antennomeres pale, darkened dorsally on scape. Jacoby (1881) commented on the possibility that this species could be the same as C. fuscitarsis Lefèvre, 1877, also metallic purple dorsally, but slightly smaller (3.5–4.0 mm) and with five basal antennomeres fulvous and tarsi and apex of tibiae darker. Bechyné (1951) recognized dark violaceous forms of C. ignita in Costa Rica (= ab. supraviolacea). The specimen from Nicaragua, which fits the description of Spintherophyta, is a large (4.7 mm) female, dark violaceous blue, with four pale antennomeres basally and scape with a dark dorsal spot, and can be tentatively classified as Spintherophyta ignita (Lefèvre). We document it here (Fig. ) as well as the type of spermatheca (Fig. ) to assist its interpretation in the future. This species has been reported from Mexico and Costa Rica (Bechyné 1951; Flowers 1996) and the Nicaraguan record would help bridging the gap between these distant localities.\n\nSpintherophyta minuta (Jacoby, 1881)\n\n(Figs. , , )\n\nNew species record: JGZC: (1) female (JGZC-2612), Rivas, Cárdenas, Finca Isla Vista, 11.23345 -85.55123, 56 m, 6 February 2012, A.

De la Cadena, J.-M. Maes & A. Papadopoulou leg., Spintherophyta minuta (Jac.) J. Gómez-Zurita det. 2022.\n\nJacoby (1881, p. 110) described Chrysodina minuta from Guatemala, not to be confounded with Lamprosphaerus minutus described from the same country (p. 113), the latter having been already reported from Nicaragua (Maes and Staines 1991). Relative to the former, the author expressed doubts about its correct generic placement, mainly because of its relatively elongate shape and long prosternum, which did not fit his concept of Chrysodina (Jacoby 1890). Lefèvre (1889a) transferred Jacoby’s taxon to Lamprosphaerus without justification, but Jacoby (1890) was not satisfied with this decision, highlighting that the enlarged apical antennomeres of his species were not characteristic of Lamprosphaerus. Bechyné (1953) proposed a new combination with Nodonota, and years later to Antitypona, but without any justification (Bechyné 1955). Flowers (1996) treated most Chrysodina described by Jacoby as Spintherophyta, including C. minuta. The specimens collected in Nicaragua (Fig. ) agree well with the type of C. minuta, also in the shape of their antennae, with short antennomeres 3 and 4 and a markedly enlarged second antennomere, characteristic of Central American Spintherophyta; they also show clear microreticulation on head and pronotum, even though the dorsal tinge is of a stronger green and blue hue compared with the type. Thus, we tend to agree with Flowers’ (1996) assessment for this species and retain it in Spintherophyta, and take the opportunity to illustrate the penis (Fig. ) and spermatheca (Fig. ) of this species for the first time. S. minuta is only known from Guatemala, and the Nicaraguan records, all found in the south of the country, represent a remarkable expansion of the known range of the species.\n\nTalurus tortonesei (Bechyné, 1957)\n\n(Figs. , , )\n\nConfirmation records: JGZC: (1) 3 females (JGZC-1205, JGZC-1207, JGZC-1217) and 2 males (JGZC-1208, JGZC-1209, JGZC-1219), Granada, Reserva Silvestre Privada Domitila, May 2010, J.-M.

Flowers det. 2020.\n\nThis species of Talurus Lefèvre, 1889b, which was originally described from Corinto, a coastal locality of Chinandega (Nicaragua), is common and widespread in Nicaragua, although Maes and Staines (1991) missed reporting it in their catalog. While this is not a proper new country record, we take the opportunity to amend the previous catalog with our own records of this species in Nicaragua, including illustrations of habitus (Fig. ) and genitalia (Figs. and ). This species is also important for another reason. T. rugosus (Jacoby, 1882), described from Mexico, has been reported as a pest of different crops across Central America (e.g., Coto et al. 1995), and there has been a trend to automatically refer all Talurus found attacking crops to this species, including in Nicaragua (e.g., Maes and Staines 1991). However, based on our assessment, all the available specimens of Talurus from Nicaragua, which display quite a range of chromatic alternatives, actually belong to T. tortonesei Bechyné, and perhaps other country records also need a reassessment (e.g., Van Roie et al. 2019). Bechyné (1957) detailed the main differences between the two species, where the most remarkable would include the preapical enlargement of protibiae in T. tortonesei, against the straight tibiae of T. rugosus, but also the finer, denser punctation on pronotum and a less transverse pronotum in the case of T. tortonesei.\n\nTijucana vitticollis (Jacoby, 1882)\n\n(Figs. , )\n\nNew genus and species record: JGZC: female (JGZC-1305), Río San Juan, El Castillo, Refugio Bartola, 10°58′37.19″N 84°20′12.33″W, 79 m, 3–6 November 2009, J.-M.

Maes leg.\n\nTijucana Bechyné, 1957 is a small genus that was proposed based on eyes strongly emarginate internally and reduced anterior prosternal lobes, and it only contains three known species (Bechyné 1958): one from Brasil (State of Rio de Janeiro), one from Bolivia, and one that was known from Panama and later found in Costa Rica (Flowers 1996). The presence of T. vitticollis in rainforests of the south of Nicaragua (Fig. ), close to the border with Costa Rica, slightly expands the range of the genus further north. Interestingly, one of the specimens, a female, has abnormally formed apex of right mesotibia and corresponding mesotarsus, where a notable case of trifid tarsal schistomelia can be observed (Fig. ). Schistomelia is the division of an appendix in two or more growth axes, and while this type of abnormality typically affects the antennae of many insects, there are relatively few reports of this process affecting the legs of Coleoptera (Ortuño and Ramos Abuín 2008), which makes this observation particularly interesting.\n\nTypophorus apicicornis (Jacoby, 1891 )\n\n(Figs. , )\n\nNew species record: JGZC: female (JGZC-2591), Managua, Montelimar, Reserva Natura, 11.87659 -86.88130, 36 m, 24 January 2012, J. Gómez-Zurita, A. Cardoso, G. De la Cadena & A. Papadopoulou leg., Typophorus apicicornis Jac. J. Gómez-Zurita det. 2022.\n\nThis species of Typophorus Erichson, 1847, was previously known only from Panama (Bechyné 1953; Flowers 1996), and it is relatively easy to identify based on chromatic pattern. The individuals are dark reddish brown with four darker spots on elytra, which are faint but visible in the Nicaraguan specimen, and the antennae have antennomeres 6–10 black and the remaining antennomeres pale, including the apical one (Fig. ). The legs of T. apicicornis are dark reddish brown with apex of tibiae and femora black, a contrast that also occurs in the Nicaraguan specimen although it is difficult to appreciate because of its generalized dark color. Punctation of the Nicaraguan specimen also fits the type. The only specimen available for study is a female and the spermatheca is figured for future reference (Fig. ). As with most species reported in this work, the presence of the species in Nicaragua greatly expands the range of the species in a significant part of Central America.\n\nTypophorus cyanipennis (Lefèvre, 1876)\n\n(Figs. , )\n\nNew species record: JGZC: female (JGZC-1387), Managua, Montelimar, Reserva Natura, 11.862763 -86.5117021, 69 m, 9 October 2010, J.-M.

Thompson leg., Typophorus cf. mexicanus R. Westerduijn det. 2020.\n\nThis originally Mexican species of Typophorus has been recognized as allied to another Mexican and Guatemalan species, T. mexicanus Jacoby, 1876 (Jacoby 1882). While it was initially proposed that the reddish legs of the former (at least on femora basally) could distinguish them compared with the dark metallic legs of the latter (Jacoby 1876, 1882), it was subsequently recognized that T. mexicanus could show variability in this trait as well (Jacoby 1891), thus complicating the separation of both species. Both T. cyanipennis and T. mexicanus share their very characteristic chromatic pattern and a tenuous, nearly imperceptible punctation on head and thorax, and faint, sparse punctation on elytra, and they may be indeed conspecific. Jacoby (1891) struggled to keep them separated on the basis of supposedly longer antennae in T. mexicanus. While this issue is settled, the specimens from Nicaragua, including a 4.0 mm long female (Fig. ) conforms better to the original description and chromatic traits of T. cyannipennis, also in the smaller size (Lefèvre gave 4.5–6.0 mm for his taxon, and Jacoby 5.3 mm), and considering that Jacoby’s description was published nearly at the end of 1876 (5th December), it is possible that Lefèvre’s taxon would have precedence in case of an eventual synonymy were decided. The spermatheca of one Nicaraguan specimen is figured (Fig. ).\n\nTypophorus subbrunneus (Jacoby, 1882)\n\n(Figs. , , )\n\nNew species record: JGZC: (1) female (JGZC-1896), León, Jardín Botánico (bosque de galería), 12.433378 -86.9140889, 50 m [919], 4 August 2011, J.-M.
