From 2009-2013, Professor Altschuler also served as vice president for university relations, with responsibilities for articulating and overseeing strategies related to communications, government relations, and land grant affairs. Professor Altschuler has been an animating force in the American Studies Program and has been a strong advocate on campus for high-quality teaching and advising. In 1998, he became the Thomas and Dorothy Litwin Professor of American Studies. For many years, his two-semester survey, Popular Culture in the United States 19900-Present, was one of the most popular courses at Cornell.\n\nGlenn Altschuler is the author or co-author of 11 books and about fifteen hundred essays and reviews. He is a regular contributor to The Hill and Psychology Today. The National Book Critics Circle has cited his work as “exemplary.” Psychology Today has featured it as “essential reading.” For four years he wrote a column for the Education Life section of The New York Times. From 2002 to 2005 he was a regular panelist on national and international affairs for the WCNY television program The Ivory Tower Half Hour. His political commentary appears on websites and newspapers in the United States and abroad.\n\nTarcisio Alvarez-Rivero is a recently retired senior staff member of the United Nations, where he served for 29 years. He is currently an adjunct professor and lecturer at American University and IE University, Madrid, in addition to his classes at Cornell University.\n\nAt the United Nations, Professor Alvarez-Rivero’s last assignment was as Coordinator of the SPARK (Strategy, Partnerships, Accountability, Results and Knowledge) teams in the Office of the Under-Secretary General of the UN Economic and Social Commissions for Western Asia (UN ESCWA) in Beirut, Lebanon. In this position, he oversaw ESCWA’s strategic planning and business intelligence processes as well as the evaluations, risk management, and internal control programmes. Professor Alvarez-Rivero also led ESCWA’s organizational learning and change management processes, including its transition to an AGILE-based business model. In addition, he oversaw the development of the UN Development System’s Regional Knowledge and Data Hub and ESCWA’s online Arabic learning management system.\n\nProfessor Alvarez-Rivero was a member of the UN Development Group’s Task Team on Programme Development and Results, and he led the UN Strategic Planning Network Task Force on Strategy and UNSDCFs, through which he coordinated the interagency processes that developed the planning guidance for all UN country offices (2020) as well as the update of the UN Development System guidance document on Results-Based Management. Professor Alvarez-Rivero was also a member of the principals group of the UN Evaluations Group and the UN high-level Task Forces on Strategic Human Resource Management and on Gender Finance.\n\nDuring his UN career, Professor Alvarez-Rivero executed a number of field projects, including the development of national cleaner technology strategies in Argentina, Colombia, Nicaragua, the Slovak Republic, Tanzania, and Vietnam. He has also engaged in advisory services with several governments for the development of supply chain and environmental management initiatives, including projects in Denmark, Norway, Korea, Japan, and the United States. Professor Alvarez-Rivero was a member of the drafting committees of the ISO 14051 and ISO 26000 standards and led the drafting group of the International Federation of Accountants Environmental Management Accounting Guidelines. Additional achievements include the creation of the global programme on the 10-year Framework of Programmes on Sustainable Consumption and Production (10YFP), the establishment of the UN Office for the Decade of Water in Zaragoza, Spain, and the co-founding of the EMAN Global Network.\n\nPrior to joining the United Nations in 1995, Professor Alvarez-Rivero worked in the private sector for over a decade, most recently as a representative agent for Cargill Inc. in Latin America, where he negotiated commodities contracts and managed commodities production and export programmes.\n\nAriel Avgar is an Associate Professor at the ILR School at Cornell University and Associate Director for Research and Student Engagement with the Scheinman Institute on Conflict Resolution.

I received a B.S. in chemistry from Butler University in 2000 and a Ph.D. in Biochemistry, Molecular and Cell Biology from Cornell University in 2007. My research area of interest is folate-dependent one-carbon metabolism, which is required for synthesis of DNA precursors and methionine. Perturbations in this network may result from folate deficiency, polymorphisms in genes that encode folate-dependent enzymes, and/or other B-vitamin deficiencies. These perturbations are associated with adverse physiological outcomes that include certain cancers, cardiovascular disease, neurological impairments, and birth defects. While fortification of the food supply with folic acid has decreased birth defect rates both in the U.S. and throughout the world, the mechanisms that underlie this response and possible interactions with other clinical outcomes are not completely understood.\n\nMy research uses several in vitro and in vivo model systems to study the mechanisms that underlie physiological outcomes associated with perturbed one-carbon metabolism. More specifically, inadequate thymidylate (dTMP, or the “T” base in DNA) can result in misincorporation of uracil into DNA, which then leads to DNA damage and genome instability in both nuclear and mitochondrial DNA. Recent studies using isotope tracer methodologies have elucidated mechanisms whereby mammalian cells respond to folate deficiency to spare nuclear dTMP synthesis at the expense of methionine synthesis. We have also shown that nucleotide precursors of thymidylate, namely uridine and deoxyuridine, have distinct fates in DNA, and dietary intake of each of these nucleosides uniquely modifies folate-responsive birth defects and colon tumor formation in mice. Current and future research will extend these studies to understand the mechanisms by which perturbed one-carbon metabolism and genome instability affect pathologies including peripheral neuropathy, neurological disorders, and lung cancer.\n\nMitochondrial de novo dTMP biosynthesis is considerably more sensitive to folate depletion than nuclear de novo dTMP synthesis, as measured by misincorporation of uracil into mitochondrial. Elucidating the molecular mechanisms linking folate nutrition and enzyme expression/localization in supporting mitochondrial de novo dTMP synthesis is also a focus of my current research–especially as related to mitochondrial DNA integrity and pathogenesis of metabolic diseases such as mitochondrial DNA depletion syndromes, chronic disease, and age-related decline in mitochondrial function.\n\nThis project is addressing the metabolic pathways underlying the association between erythritol exposure, endogenous erythritol synthesis, central metabolism, and weight/central adiposity gain.\n\nAllan Filipowicz is clinical professor of management and organizations at the Samuel Curtis Johnson Graduate School of Management at Cornell University.
