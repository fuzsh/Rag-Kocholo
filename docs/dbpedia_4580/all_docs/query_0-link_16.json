A list of the 418 described species of Symphyta in Korea is presented. The list is in taxonomic sequence by superfamily, family, subfamily and genus and includes 116 genera in 22 subfamilies, 12 families, and seven superfamilies. We provide the page reference of the original description of every species and genus listed, Korean name, host records, and all Korean records. The list also provides the distribution of all the species by country.",
