        "text": "I think everyone has suspected that the copyright expiring on 'Steamboat Willie' -- the inspiration behind Walt Disney's Mickey Mouse -- would lead to some interesting consequences.\n\nIt goes without saying that this beloved animated character has been front-and-center behind the happiness of children around the world for the better part of the last century. Created in 1928 (according to Google.com), the Mick has inspired others to laugh in ways only a true pioneer could; thus, that copyright issue -- one would think -- might've been a bigger deal than the Mouse House ever anticipated it would, could, and should be. Whatever the case may be, I think we're resting on the perch of something completely different in entertainment now that its in public domain ... and one of the very first mutations looks to be coming to screens near you very, very, very soon.\n\n​Why, it was just today that I received the press release from Gravitas Ventures promoting their forthcoming The Mouse Trap (aka Mickey's Mouse Trap) for video and physical release this next month in August. In lieu of any further commentary on part, I'm going to do the noble copy-and-paste from their materials, this way preserving exactly what the powers that be want you to know about their impending Horror flick entirely.\n\nRead up, kids! Mickey's taking a rather dark turn!\n\n​\n\n-- EZ\n\n​\n\nThe Mouse Trap\n\nAnnounces Distribution Partner And Release Dates\n\nInto Frame Productions partners Jamie Bailey and Simon Phillips are pleased to announce several multi-region partnerships for The Mouse Trap. The film garnered huge press attention when their teaser trailer dropped on January 1st on Simon Phillips' personal YouTube account and has since been seen by millions of people worldwide.\n\nThe film producers inked deals with Gravitas Ventures, An Anthem Sports & Entertainment Company, for the United States and Canada. The Horror feature The Mouse Trap releasing on VOD on August 6th, and DVD and Blu-Ray on August 13th 2024.\n\nSteamboat Willie is the earliest version of Disney’s Mickey Mouse character, which entered the public domain on Jan. 1, 2024.\n\nThe film's Director Jamie Bailey states \"The Mouse Trap film is famously the first horror film to use the Mickey Mouse character from Steamboat Willie. We just wanted to have fun with it all. I mean it's Steamboat Willie's Mickey Mouse murdering people. It's ridiculous. We ran with it and had fun doing it and I think it shows.\"\n\nThe film stars Simon Phillips (THE WITCHER, FUBAR) as the titular villain, said of the film \"We have a childlike excitement to show the world the film! We love the amazing work Walt Disney created here and we love the creative freedom the character coming into public domain provided. Fun. That's what we had making it and what you will get watching it.\"\n\nIt was produced by Paul Whitney, Mark Popejoy, Alexander Gausman and Andrew Agopsowicz and the Co Producer is Filmcore's Mem Ferda.\n\nAbout Gravitas Ventures\n\nGravitas Ventures is a leading all rights distributor of independent feature films and documentaries.

He has also cited and won awards for his gruesome portrayal of Santa Claus in Christmas Horror features Once Upon A Time At Christmas and The Nights Before Christmas. His Feature film - Butchers, garnered high praise from The Guardian newspaper stating \"It's Phillips' performance that keeps the film's pulse going. His Owen is exhilarating unpredictable, alternating between moments of meticulous villainy and sheer lunacy - one moment he will be refitting a spooky music box while eyeing his oblivious prey, next he will be whacking his victim bloodily, channeling a kind of biblical righteousness that makes him slippery, fascinating and, most importantly, terrifying to watch.\" He has appeared in feature films with Arnold Schwarzenegger, Bruce Willis, Mark Hamill, Robert Englund, Rutger Hauer, Richard E. Grant, Jean-Claude Van Damme, Jonathan Rhys Meyers, John Malkovich, and Mel Gibson.\n\n​\n\nWhere oh where does our collective fear of spiders come from?\n\nA quick Google.com search suggests that an average of 24% of Americans live with arachnophobia – the fear of spiders – and that’s only eclipsed by the fear of public speaking. An article published by the British Psychological Society suggests that not only is that 24% high – their research pits it around a negligible 6% (although qualified by ‘extreme arachnophobia,’ as if that makes it any more impressive) – but also it’s a highly irrational anxiety: spiders are our friends, only a scant 0.5% are deadly to humans, and they actually dine on other insects that likely terrify us as much if not more. The article goes on to suggest that, chiefly, scholars believe spiders get psychologically associated with the more deadly scorpion – they’re also arachnids – making any attempt to convince sufferers otherwise a bit of an uphill battle at best.\n\nIndeed, this irrational fear of spiders has been exploited by a great many storytellers, so much so that perhaps filmmakers should be sued by any ‘arachnid society’ for contributing to their noxious reputation. The 1950’s not only saw The Incredible Shrinking Man taking it on-the-lam inside his own house to escape the clutches of a common house pest but also studios put out three silver screen releases – Tarantula (1955) and The Spider (1958) – that supersized their arachnids and put them rampaging in giant-style across the American countryside. Roughly two decades later, Hollywood rekindled their love affair with the creeping crawlies with such outings as The Giant Spider Invasion (1975) and Kingdom Of The Spiders (1977). Then – in 1990 – director Frank Marshall really went for broke in delivering the aptly titled Arachnophobia to theaters, a tale that saw a lethal South American spider terrorizing small-town America as a starting point for its global domination.\n\nNow, there have been more – many more, in fact – so it should go without saying that this particular paranoia isn’t going away any time soon: earlier this year, writer/director Kiah Roache-Turner ventured back into the dark with Sting (2024), a yarn that aesthetically has a great deal in common with those aforementioned 50’s flicks. This protagonist arrives from Outer Space, and it crashes down unseen into a big city side-street apartment building where unsuspecting occupants slowly comes to grips with this extraordinarily intelligent mutation of the species. Before all is over, blood will be let, lives will be lost, and a little girl will come to love the surrogate father she nearly lost in the process.\n\n(NOTE: The following review will contain minor spoilers necessary solely for the discussion of plot and/or characters. If you’re the type of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler-free, then I’d encourage you to skip down to the last few paragraphs for the final assessment. If, however, you’re accepting of a few modest hints at ‘things to come,’ then read on …)\n\nFrom the film’s IMDB.com page citation:\n\n“After raising an unnervingly talented spider in secret, 12-year-old Charlotte must face the facts about her pet-and fight for her family's survival-when the once-charming creature rapidly transforms into a giant, flesh-eating monster.”\n\n​\n\nIt’s been suggested over the years that writer/director Steven Spielberg truly invigorated Hollywood’s best efforts to focus on storytelling for the young and the young-at-heart. While I’ll concede that’s a valid argument, I’ve always insisted that he was far from the first to do so; still, given the fact that I think his films were among those big studio efforts largely embraced for this emphasis, he winds up getting a great deal of credit. Thankfully, many other auteurs have followed in those footsteps – Chris Columbus, Robert Zemeckis, JJ Abrams, etc. – and even a good deal more have tapped into the Spielberg vision while pushing their adventures in decidedly different directions.\n\nGiven that cinematic Fantasy borders very, very closely to topics and subject matter obsessed with things that go bump in the night, the Horror genre has benefitted as well from what I’ll call a bit of bleedover effect. For example, Netflix’s widely popular Stranger Things has amassed a huge fan following by picking up on such Spielbergian magic but infesting its various plotlines with some adult trappings of conspiracy and – more importantly – authentic screen Horror. The Duffer Brothers – the siblings largely credited with a great deal of what’s evolved from the streaming show – have certainly proven that screen magic and mystery need not ignore that there are things both children and adults should be afraid of; and the franchise continues to be a juggernaut by mixing the good, the bad, and the terrifying with each season.\n\nFor what it’s worth, Sting – even with its faults – fits within this same construct. While it’s functionally the story of young Charlotte (Alyla Browne), an artistic misfit struggling to fit in at home in much the same way screen children rather commonly get portrayed, director Roache-Turner never shies away from the chance to remind us that Char’s still a kid within an adult world … and maybe even they’re not enough to protect her from the monster she inadvertently releases.\n\nWe’re first introduced to Sting – the film’s central baddie – when it cracks open from the small meteor(ish) egg which crashes down into an elaborate dollhouse. Much like those facehuggers from Ridley Scott’s spectacular Alien (1979), Sting stretches its legs and crawls out into the faux domicile, slowly making its way from room to room whilst credits roll in the set-up. In short order, we meet Charlotte – a bit of a benign cat burglar using the apartment building’s HVAC ducts to explore her neighbors – who finds the tiny arachnid, captures it in a matchbox (do those things exist anymore?), and takes it back to her room as a newfound pet.\n\nWhere there are children, it naturally follows there will be parents (or some other figures of authority); and Char is very soon confronted by her step-father Ethan (Ryan Corr), a hopeful comic book illustrator whose day job it is to manage the building’s many, many, many maintenance issues for his abusive aunt-in-law, landlord, and fellow tenant Gunter (Robyn Nevin). With a name like ‘Gunter,’ she’s every bit the full-blooded German matriarch the Third Reich would’ve produced, leaving Ethan with a never-ending list of jobs needing his immediate, undivided attention. His wife – Char’s mother – Heather (Penelope Mitchell) spends her days toiling in her work-from-home career and her nights caring for her Alzheimer’s afflicted mother Helga (Noni Hazlehurst). Torn between an endless list of responsibilities, Ethan has begun to show cracks of frustration between managing the needs of so many while watching his personal dreams slowly slip away.\n\nSimilarly, Roache-Turner’s script suffers under the weight of trying to keep the expected suspense moving forward while balancing out screen time between this rather slim cast of characters. Gunter and Helga are the first obvious casualties here, reduced from the onset to being little more than stereotypical old codgers – one somewhat debilitated and the other little more than a Nazi(ish) shrew – so they wind up serving more as comic fodder whenever they appear. Upstairs neighbor Erik (Danny Kim) gets portrayed as the – ahem – brainy foreigner with no social skills and a penchant for knowing whatever science fact is required to effectively more the plot forward when needed. The building’s only other resident – Maria (a luminous Silvia Colloca) – has apparently suffered some dire tragedy – it’s implied that she lost her husband and children to some grim affair – but none of that really matters as (you guessed it) she’ll wind up as one of the earliest victims to Sting’s growing hunger.\n\nStill, it helps that both Browne and Corr are well cast in their respective roles. Their father-daughter dynamic works almost whenever it’s relied upon (there are a few rough spots, but given Browne’s young age it’s easy to overlook), even though the man winds up acting a bit cowardly in a few small spots. I could be wrong (I have been before), but I’m apt to wonder if Roache-Turner felt responsible to – ahem – defang any appearance of a strong male lead – an ongoing problem inside Hollywood and beyond, from what I’ve seen – in favor of handing more heroics to the women and children. While I can appreciate just how put upon the father felt at times, I still couldn’t wonder what his motivation was for cracking so much as he does late in the picture. Charlotte does have the answers necessary to guarantee everyone’s survival up to a point; but it’s Ethan’s handyman(esque) moxie that comes into play in the final reel. Though the kid gets to ultimately vanquish her mortal enemy – Sting has now grown to man-sized proportions, wouldn’t you know – I’d argue that she deserved the honor of delivering the coup de grace given the way the story was crafted.\n\nHorrors of this particular variety – like those mentioned above from the 1950’s and 1970’s – operate on a slim efficiency. Basically, there isn’t much to know, nor much need to know, and you’re just here to observe. Audiences aren’t required to wade through a great deal scientific meandering to grasp what’s transpiring – basically, there’s a spider, it has an insatiable appetite and some cosmic talents, and it’s getting larger and larger with each passing meal – and, from there, you roll with the changes. What, how, and why the creature does what it does matters not. What, why, and how the monster varies its killing style isn’t meant to be a distraction so much as it is the main attraction; and that’s all you need to know. Sting is the kind of circus sideshow – the bearded lady, the intelligent donkey, the fire-breathing man, etc. – that exists entirely on one level. You’re not given a lot of time to mull things over for fear that you’d change from a believer to a skeptic. It’s disposable entertainment, and there’s absolutely nothing wrong with that.\n\nTo the film’s credit, Roache-Turner’s script stays pretty lean. As I said, it’s a thin cast of characters, and this allows for the efforts of crafting tension with some excellent camera trickery – accomplished largely in such a way to minimize the need for too many intrusive special effects – to remain always at the forefront. While it might’ve been nice to have a bit more scientific explanation for how and why Sting – the spider – is able to exist, grow, and feed, it isn’t all that important because what’s assembled here is a (collective) house haunted by an aggressive monster. One spill is little more than the set-up for the next chill, and viewers are constantly encouraged to do nothing more than sit back and enjoy the ride.\n\n​\n\nI’d be remiss if I failed to mention that Roache-Turner and cinematographer Brad Shield do an amazing job infecting almost each and every visual with something to watch. Like that Spielbergian magic I mentioned above, the camera captures every sheen and every glimmer; and it bobs, weaves, and – dare I say – crawls from point to point with an irrepressibly whimsical style, much like a spider creeping exactly where it always intended to go. Rarely is such a technique as laudable as it is here – I’ve seen it done in Dramas and Comedies, and it’s felt like stylistic overload – elevating what they’ve captured on film to have been possibly plucked from nightmares in the best way possible … if such a thing were ever desired, that is.\n\nSimply put, Sting emerges as a project that’s fun to watch and watch closely. There’s often more going on in there that meets the eye, and such creativity should be celebrated when caught in such an subversive web.\n\nAnd … yes … I say this as one who is very, very, very afraid of spiders.\n\nSting (2024) was produced by Align, Pictures In Paradise, and See Pictures. DVD distribution (for this particular release) has been coordinated by the fine folks at Well Go USA Entertainment. As for the technical specifications? While I’m no trained video expert, I found the project’s sights and sounds to be pretty damn exceptional from start-to-finish. Lastly, if you’re looking for special features? Well, sadly, there isn’t much. You get a trailer and a brief making-of – one that serves more as a bloated promotional short – to digest; and that just wasn’t enough for this viewer. Never is.\n\nRecommended.\n\nWhat I like about Sting (2024) is that – most of the time – it functions very much like a late 1950’s oversized monster movie, complete with the trappings of the fateful spider possibly coming from outer space and sticking all of the action very close to a slim cast of characters. What I didn’t like was that – with such a small cast – the script really should’ve invested a bit more time in actually developing these players other than being stock additions. Sadly, they end up being little more than victims (to a degree), and we only got to know them passingly. A bit more effort could’ve had this one being worth a repeat visit … if not the rather obviously promised sequel.\n\nIn the interests of fairness, I’m pleased to disclose that the fine folks at Well Go USA Entertainment provided me with a complimentary Blu-ray of Sting (2024) by request for the expressed purpose of completing this review. Their contribution to me in no way, shape, or form influenced my opinion of it.\n\n-- EZ\n\n​\n\nFolks, without blowing my own horn, I do like to point out when I diverge from fandom's opinions in general.\n\nToday's exhibit: 2008's The X-Files: I Want To Believe.\n\n​Released on this day back then, the film was a vastly lower-budgeted affair than was its predecessor (1998's The X-Files aka The X-Files: Fight The Future) with a vastly less mythology-driven caper that brought former FBI Special Agents Fox Mulder and Dana Scully back into the government circle for a very specific and grisly abduction. According to a Google.com search, the project grossed under $70 million from the global box office -- on a budget reportedly of $30 million -- but it mostly failed in its mission to re-ignite the franchise by whetting the appetite of fans to demand more X.\n\nHere's the plot summary as provided by IMDB.com:\n\n\"Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) worked at the F.B.I. as partners, a bond between them that led to them becoming lovers. But now they're out of the F.B.I. and have begun new careers. Scully works as a staff physician at a Catholic hospital. Her focus these days is on a young boy with an incurable brain disease. Administration wants to give up on him. Scully, who feels a special bond with the boy, does not. Meanwhile, Mulder's focus is on clipping newspaper articles, throwing pencils into his ceiling and writing about the paranormal. Scully and Mulder are brought together as partners again when a special case requires Mulder's expertise, and Scully is prevailed upon to convince him to help. The case involves a pedophile priest who claims he is having psychic visions regarding the whereabouts of a missing F.B.I. Agent.\"\n\nWhile a case could be made that the series which ran from 1993 through 2013 (with ample time-off in between those dates) earned the largest percentage of its reputation exploring the idea of life out there interacting in some way with life down here (on Earth), I still insist to those who listen that the procedural was still at its very best when it stuck to the 'Monster Of The Week' format. Be it vampires, werewolves, psychics, clones, or any number of fringe antagonists, X very uniquely presented real world people who found themselves in extraordinary circumstances; and -- in this structure -- Agents Mulder and Scully were allowed to do their thing, mainly chatting through any number of possibilities to confirm or deny the existence of something ... something ... well ... freaky. Yes, it's equally acceptable to champion those countless hours exploring the show's central mythology; but -- for me -- I was usually more invested with tales that colored outside of those somewhat predictable lines.\n\nAfter all, they were never going to prove we weren't alone ... were they?\n\n​That's why I'll always defend 2008's I Want To Believe. It turned left when audiences and fans probably expected it to turn right, showing us the eventual strain on our beloved duo's relationship might eventually produce the resulting fracture. As much as some always wanted the pair to 'get together' (and they did), the 2008 feature showed that true love within their unique circumstances might not be enough to lead to any 'happily ever after' construct. While they may've reached a personal and professional compromise, threads were forever destined to pull them in other directions.\n\n​\n\nFurthermore, what really excited me was that -- yes -- they were back together -- back in the business of confronting a wonderful puzzle -- even though they weren't exactly part of the usual suspects. Their usual camaraderie was missing from the film's earlier moments -- that strain I spoke of briefly above -- and they had to find it again, not one-on-one but with a small(ish) cast of characters watching. It introduced a new dynamic into their relationship, testing these characters and the patience of their fans in ways that produced some solid dramatic moments. No, it wasn't anything bit -- like their first screen kiss or anything on that level -- but it gave these talented actors something new to confront; and I think it made for a better picture.\n\nAlso, I think Believe really set the stage for what could've, would've, and should've been a soft reboot for the franchise.\n\nInstead of doing what the agents had done before on screens big and small, the X franchise was really at a crossroads. Their relationship had kinda/sorta run its course -- both as a couple and as government employees -- so spinning them off into new waters gave them a measure of independence they hadn't quite known before. Gone was the Higher Authority that either cooperated with them or secretly placed obstacles in their path; and in its place there was this almost macho sense of 'you came to us for us so stay out of our way' attitude. It kinda/sorta cast them in the mold of experts -- independent contractors, if you will, available as contract-for-hire to those with enough cash -- and that's what I think was an inspiration for an all-new direction.\n\n​\n\nImagine that the franchise at that point could've continued in a string of modestly budgeted adventures. Each story could've had its own premise, never being tied to anything that had been done before; and this could've allowed both Mulder and Scully to be -- as I said -- agents for hire. No, I'm not suggesting in any way that they should set up shop, formed their own LLC, and put up advertising on late-night television; but what I was (at the time) in favor of was seeing more of the intrepid couple being sought out as experts by any number of organizations, both foreign and domestic.\n\nThis newfound relationship might have even occasionally put them at odds with the Federal government in ways the show handled mostly with kid gloves. As an example, suppose a UFO crashed in South America, and foreign powers came to Mulder asking for him to assist in its recovery. He could've gone on his own -- leaving Scully behind -- and then, perhaps, something goes horribly awry in the other nation. After being warning by the U.S. government not to intervene, Scully then goes rogue (or a sort), hopping the next plane to the foreign land to find her lost partner. All of this inevitably could bring the reunited pair in conflict once again with the U.S. on foreign soil; and that, too, could've pushed the door open for some other curious event.\n\nMy point is -- ahem -- not to suggest that I should be penning these stories. (I do write, I have written, but that is far from the point.) Rather, it's that I think Believe introduced a great springboard from which X could've truly re-invented itself for the cineplexes; and I'm sad that never quite happened.\n\n​\n\nAs a standalone feature, the 2008 film works adequately. Mulder and Scully are given a tension they explore. While it's certainly never intrinsic to the main plot, the actors made the most of this smaller, quieter, even gentler affair; and they did so with some new faces added to the mix along with a familiar one popping in here and there. The central scope stayed relatively small -- I say that compared to their previous theatrical outing as well as what the show accomplished in its popular serial format -- and the downside was that -- ahem -- one might suggest this didn't even need to be a Mulder/Scully production. While it was great to see them together again, the narrow scope seemed to leave fans a bit -- ahem -- disenfranchised; and this title has all but disappeared as a talking point.\n\nX did return to the small screen a few years later; and that, too, was occasionally good but sparingly in my estimation. Putting the wheels back for a weekly go-round -- even though these were vastly shorter seasons -- made the experience feel a bit like a cash grab more than it was an authentic attempt to spin new yarns in the conspiratorial network. A once tentpole genre franchise is now mostly dark, and that's sad ... especially given the modest promise Believe offered when it had a slim chance.\n\n​\n\nAs always, thanks for reading ... thanks even more for sharing ... thanks even more for being a fan ... and live long and prosper!\n\n-- EZ\n\n​\n\nIt goes without saying that no one likes to be the bearer of bad news.\n\nWhat’s worse?\n\nWell, the only thing I can think of immediately is being the recipient of some bad news; but when you get in the business of trying to both talk about entertainment and critique it against the backdrop of history, you have to be willing to ‘man up’ and deliver the good, the bad, and the ugly.\n\nIn part, that’s all I was trying to do yesterday when I talked about the death of good storytelling in the greater Star Wars Universe. Looking back, I didn’t think then – nor do I think now – that I said anything remotely controversial. In fact, I’ve always tried to approach presenting my perspective with a whole lot of common sense woven in there between the nouns, verbs, and adjectives. Like it or not, it might’ve stirred to the pot a bit too heartily for some, mostly because I received some feedback suggesting that I said “Star Wars is dead.”\n\nAgain, I never said that exactly, but let me take a moment to clear up any confusion I may’ve inadvertently created:\n\n“Star Wars – as we once knew it – is dead.”\n\nIn fact, I think that’s an accepted consensus amongst the hardest of the hard-core Star Wars fans: it wasn’t but just last week that Film Threat’s Chris Gore and his merry band of collaborators hosted the online event titled “Funeral For A Franchise.” For those of you who missed it – shame on you – it was largely a long wake coordinated by Gore that highlighted a great many reasons why that galaxy far, far away has slipped further and further from our cultural collective consciousness. Unlike other online content creators, Film Threat delivered an event that was as thoughtful as it was satirically tinged. While one could’ve come away feeling differently about the State of The Empire, I thought that there was still no denying that what Star Wars has become under Lucasfilm’s Second Reich is a far cry from the whimsical, fantastical fairy tale that inspired a generation (or two) of consumers in ways the Walt Disney Company can (arguably) never recapture.\n\nNow, I’m surprised that this is something I’d ever find myself clarifying, frankly.\n\nWhile what I wrote yesterday was never intended to insult anyone who still invests time and money in the Outer Rim territories, I’m astonished how audiences can look at Star Wars: Episode IV – A New Hope and find legitimate thematic comparisons to Andor, Ahsoka, or The Acolyte.\n\nAndor – a good Fantasy/Drama in its own right – hinges very heavily on understanding the political structure of the franchise George Lucas created. It coopted some of the original’s ideas and gave them new life by introducing political comparisons to our modern era. So, yes, it’s an adult excursion within this intergalactic fairy tale; and, yes, I get why some like it. But … for me? It feels more like that newfangled Battlestar Galactica than it does something Luke, Han, and Leia would fit easily into, and I’ve no plans to watch its second season at this point.\n\nIn minor ways, Ahsoka hinted strongly in small pieces like it wanted to be something very much ‘in the tradition of’ what Lucas did. Sadly, the show’s pacing was horrific, gravitating between painful instances of characters standing around waiting for something to spur them into action instead of the plot organically doing that all on its own. I guess those who dabble in the Expanded Universe may’ve found more to like in it than I did, but – again – the narrative inconsistency bored me to tears.\n\nBasically, this brings us to The Acolyte, a program that – if ratings data is accurate – quite possibly lost more of its audience than the franchise ever really gained. For clarity’s sake, no, I didn’t watch it – had no interest, honestly – but I followed the plot points via online blogging and vlogging. I don’t feel I missed anything; and I’m quite certain that – given what I’ve heard about it – it wouldn’t have changed my mind about the current dire predicament some Star Wars fans find themselves in today.\n\n​\n\nIf you’re wondering, then, why I felt it necessary to offer up today’s clarification, it’s only because I heard from a few in the readership suggesting that I was a bit harsh on the franchise. I don’t think I was – not even in the slightest – but responders did ask what I would do to fix the problem?\n\nWell … how do you bring anything back from the dead, folks?\n\nOkay, okay, okay … yeah, maybe that was harsh. Forgive me for that – no, I’m not deleting the line because it’s relevant – and let me offer up something perhaps a tad more constructive.\n\nPart of the challenge, I think, that Lucasfilm – under the Walt Disney Company – has is that they’re in the business of turning out products and not stories. Yes, yes, and yes: the corporation has given us some wonderful films over the years – and they may yet again one day – but if the powers that be cannot see how ‘Star Wars’ and ‘Disney Stars Wars’ differ even only on the thematic level then what good is expending any effort trying to concoct a plan? I could be wrong here, but if The Acolyte had massive ratings even with its storytelling flaws do you honestly believe they’d think twice about doing anything differently? George Lucas – by contrast – always said he was telling the stories he wanted to tell; Kathleen Kennedy – Lucasfilm’s current head – appears to have no interest in telling stories so much as she does pushing propaganda. Those are two vastly dissimilar starting points, and I’m not certain they can exist in the same creation of mythologies.\n\nSo the only problem they see is that (A) the films are underperforming financially and (B) the television series are underperforming as selling points for Disney+. What this tells me is that the company is okay spending, say, $1 billion to make a new flick so long as it grosses, say, $3 or $5 or $7 billion at the box office. Things like story, characters, plot, etc. don’t factor into that equation, not in any negligible way. Similarly, I suspect they’d be happy to spend $1 billion on a new Star Wars streaming show so long as it netted them 3 or 5 or 7 billion new subscribers. Once more, the things I want to know more about – story, characters, plot, etc. – are inconsequential. Because apparently only profit matters in their corner of existence, how do I fix corrupted narratives? In short, there is no fix if you don’t acknowledge the core deficiency, something few executives are ever interested in exploring.\n\nAll I can offer again is my query: “How do you bring back the dead?”\n\nNow, I hold out hope that the circumstances might change.\n\nIn our hearts, I do think we’ve an optimistic people; and it’s in our nature to wish for things to be as good as they are green. No one wants to feel down and out when talking about any of our entertainment experiences, but even we need to be better about not giving swindlers more of what’s in our wallet when they care so little about the quality of the slop they dump in the trough. The best that Iger and Kennedy could do for now would be to shelve every Star Wars project in the pipeline and let the waters clear. Put some space between what they’ve done and what they could do, even if that means ultimately finding other intellectual properties to do something with in the meantime. If nothing else, a bit of a recess might help develop a greater hunger for whatever comes out next, and that alone might help lift even a middling effort out of the red and into the black.\n\nI know, I know, I know … but what would you do?\n\nThere is no simple answer. If there were, then I suspect Disney or Lucasfilm would’ve already exploited it.\n\nBut … what I would do would be something a bit different, that’s for sure.\n\nI’m an O.G. guy, and for me Star Wars has always been Luke, Han, Leia, Chewie, R2, and C-3PO. I’d bring them back in animated form with either a television show or smaller movie set after the events of Return Of The Jedi. It doesn’t have to be anything big and grand – though I’d not turn that down – but it does have to be a story worth watching, a chord they haven’t quite since acquiring the franchise from Lucas. Give us the further adventures of Luke Skywalker – a tagline that even the Jedi Master has used here and there – and put the band back together again. It was an opportunity that Lucasfilm deliberately avoided, and that single mistake told me everything about ‘Disney Star Wars’ that I needed to know in one fell swoop.\n\nIf you wanna recover from that?\n\nPut the band back together.\n\nAnd let them play.\n\n-- EZ\n\n​"
