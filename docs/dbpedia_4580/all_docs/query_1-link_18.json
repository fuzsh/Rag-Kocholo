        "text": "\" We believe that Mr Weaver was formerly a shoemaker, but abandoned that sedentary pursuit for a more active life in collecting insects. His captures in Scotland, little more than ten years ago, mark an era in the entomology of this country, and no doubt his success has led, and is still leading, others to abandon a settled calling for a more roving style of life.\" H.T. Stainton. Obituary in the Entomologists Weekly Intelligencer, January 1858.\n\nRichard Weaver (1783 -1857) was one of the most industrious collectors of British insects that this country has ever known. During his expeditions to Scotland and elsewhere he added many insects to the British list , including a number that were new to science, and some of these will be discussed in forthcoming articles. There is no known portrait of Weaver.\n\nTo British entomologists, Weaver is usually only known for the capture of a non-native butterfly in Britain, the Weaver's Fritillary, Boloria dia. Salmon (2000) in the Aurelian Legacy gave a short account of Weaver in his biographical British entomologist's hall of fame and Allan (1943) who detailed the unscrupulous 19th century dealers exonerated Weaver of any dishonesty regarding B. dia.\n\nDuring a period of ill heath in 1818, a doctor told Weaver to take long walks in the countryside surrounding Birmingham where he lived, which was then just a small provincial market town. Weaver's interest in entomology began around this time and he decided that he would leave the drudgery of the work of a cobbler and become a professional collector. Nothing seems to be recorded about Weaver's personal life except that he came from humble dwellings and had limited means. In a letter to James Charles Dale in 1841, Weaver who was then living at Worcester, mentioned that he was a native of that town. In 1842 he returned to Birmingham and seems from then on to have resided in the centre of that town at Bromsgrove Street and later at various addresses in Pershore Street.\n\nWeaver was also keen on ornithology, learning taxidermy and mounting his own specimens. He occasionally seems to have traded insects for certain bird skins, he was very keen to obtain. In 1825, Weaver who was then living at Number 28 Wearman Street in Birmingham, wrote to J. C. Dale for the first time on November 1 of that year. Dale and John Curtis had been on a collecting tour of Scotland in the summer of 1825, and Weaver was keen to add a pair of Erebia aethiops to his collection from the series they had captured, as it was then considered a rarity; in his letter he added his own price list of specimens he had for sale. Weaver's correspondence with Dale continued intermittently until shortly before his own death in 1857. Over this period Dale bought or exchanged many insects with Weaver.\n\nThe Museum.\n\nAs Weaver built up his collections of insect and birds, in spite of his limited means he had the novel idea of opening a museum. His first museum which he began around 1828 was a small affair in premises at where he was staying at 38 New Street and as his collections grew, he moved to the Associate Artists Institution rooms in Temple Street. With patronage from local business men, gentry and nobility, he was able to buy all the necessary glass cases and add minerals and shells to his collections. J. Wallace wrote of Weaver's museum in the Zoologist (1832) \" It may be gratifying to your scientific readers, and to the lovers of science generally, to learn that a museum has sprung up in the heart of the kingdom, which may vie in extent and splendour with any provincial collection in the world. The large room in which the collection is now opened to the public is 50ft long, by 25ft wide, lofty in proportion, and lighted from above by five lights on each side, inclining at such an angle as to exhibit pictures to the greatest advantage, and therefore in the highest degree adapted for the purposes of a museum of natural history. The cases of British insects are ranged down the centre of the room (about 5,000 different species) forming the appearance of a desk, inclining each way in such a manner to meet the eye ; upwards of twenty large cases of foreign insects are similarly placed across each end, and on one of the sides ; and more than thirty cases of minerals and shells fill the other side; the cases of birds occupying the walls\". If it was not for the account by Wallace, we would know little of Weaver's museum he called the \" Museum of Natural History Curiosities\" as there are no other written contemporary accounts. When Weaver's museum closed is not known but it seems certainly by 1841, as he was then residing in Worcester and in 1843, in a letter to Dale, he was writing of his late museum.\n\nThe Reverend William Thomas Bree (1786-1863) a well know naturalist, visited Weaver and his museum and published an article in the Zoologist (1832) with his own figures of a few of the special butterflies he saw there. It was Bree who first noted an unusual Fritillary in the collection, which later was identified as Boloria dia, a butterfly that would cause a lot of controversy among British entomologists. Weaver had captured an extreme melanic aberration in Sutton Park in 1827 that Stephens in his illustrations (1828) had identified as Argynnis adippe and which Bree thought due to the presence of a prevailing green tint of the underside wings was perhaps a specimen of Argynnis aglaja. Another fine aberration of A. aglaja in the Weaver collection was very unusual with elongated silver spots on the upper and lower hindwing. It was taken by Weaver in the neighbourhood of York.\n\nArgynnis adippe aberration, Weaver collection. Illustrated by W. T. Bree. Zoologist 1832.\n\nArgynnis aglaja aberration, Weaver collection. Illustrated by W. T. Bree. Zoologist 1832.\n\nBree also drew attention to specimens that Weaver had received from the Himalayas that were allied to our native species, one was Vanessa indica Herbst, 1794 a butterfly which was then very rare in collections. Weaver also had been sent specimens of Papilio machaon from the Himalayas. Ranged among Weaver's British insects were specimens of Colias europome which Bree writes \" No doubt, are of foreign origin, palmed upon him as indigenous ; he has no knowledge of the place or time of capture\". Colias europome = Colias palaeno europome is another of the many butterflies that certain dealers introduced as British, probably obtaining their specimens from Germany.\n\nVanessa indica. Weaver collection. Illustrated by W.T. Bree in the Zoologist 1832.\n\nBree finished his article by observing that \" Mr Weaver deserves well of the scientific world and the public at large ; and I sincerely hope that this enterprising spirit will meet with its due reward.\" Newman (1857) described a remarkable melanic variety of Boloria euphrosyne that Weaver had previously captured.\n\nWeaver the last Letters to J.C. Dale, collections and Death.\n\nWeaver's last three letters to Dale were written in October 1857, just a few weeks before he died. In a letter written on October 5 he writes \" Sir I would have written before but I have been unwell. I am but poorly now, I have been to Exeter, Plymouth and Burnham (*Dale wrote above the latter Appledore Sands) at the latter place I examined a large bed of of Euphorbia but I found no larva, only a few stellatarum (*Macroglossum) on the Yellow Bedstraw. I was at Torquay, the fact was I wanted to find a comfortable spot to winter as I cannot now bare the cold winds but I was afraid of the cost and that I may find nothing to take up my time.\" The rest of the letter is a list of insects that Dale might be interested in purchasing. William Raddon many years previously had claimed that he had found the larvae of Hyles euphorbiae on the sand dunes at Appedore, and it was later generally believed he had bred them from imported larvae and for which Weaver in 1857 was searching for in vain. * My italics.\n\nT. Campbell, wrote in the Entomologist's Weekly Intelligencer January 1858, \" Sir, - Not having seen the death of Mr Richard Weaver noticed in your periodical, I suppose that the knowledge of that lamented event has not yet reached you. He died on the 11th of December, at the advanced age of seventy-four, after, I believe, a short illness, but he had long been subject to a severe asthma. He left very valuable collections of Coleoptera and Lepidoptera, which I expect will now be dispersed. Hoping you will inform your readers of this event.\" Stainton the editor of the Intelligencer placed a short note in the March 13, 1858 issue that Richard Weaver's collection would shortly be sold and in the following issue there was a notice of the sale from Weaver's last place of residence.\n\nAdvert announcing the sale of the Weaver collection. Entomologist's Weekly Intelligencer, March 20, 1857.\n\nF.R. Rowley, E. Howarth and W.R. Butterfield writing of the Birmingham Museum collections in the Museums Journal for 1955 recorded that \" The roots of the Department of Natural History seem to lie in the collections amassed during the earlier years of the last century by two Birmingham naturalists. One of these, Richard Weaver, was a boot maker, who in 1841 became a taxidermist and established his workshop in Bromsgrove Street. His collections were housed in Temple Street, and after his death in 1851 were purchased by Queen's College for the sum of £1,500. \". There are a number of facts wrong in their article, Weaver was a taxidermist long before 1841, almost certainly by 1827, as he was preparing bird specimens for his museum and he died in 1857 not 1851.\n\nQueen's college in Birmingham was established by the surgeon William Sands Cox (1802 -1875) and had both medical and scientific departments. Later the two departments split and Maston Science College was established which became University of Birmingham in 1900. Birmingham museums certainly have some of Weaver's bird specimens. On their web page Birmingham Museums have a notice regarding inquiries about their natural history specimens, stating these have been suspended \"Birmingham Museums are unable to provide any details in the long term future, regarding requests for information on their Natural History collections\" ; certainly a very strange situation regarding their legacy of over 200,000 specimens and to research workers.\n\nAccording to Brown (1980) Weavers insect collections which were bought by the Reverend J. Johnston of Huddersfield in 1861. Johnson's collection was bought by Benjamin Cooke, a Liverpool dealer for £63 at the J.C. Stevens auction house in 1863. Benjamin Cooke's private collection was sold at Stevens on June 19, 1883.\n\nReferences.\n\nAllan. P.B.M. (1943) Talking of moths.\n\nBree W.T.

I went two or three times over the ground that I have taken Hipparchia cassiope (*Erebia epiphron) 16 years before but could not see a single specimen of it. I walked back across the hills to Ravenglass which is 18 miles, I lost the track and I made it 22 miles, it began to rain in the morning about half an hour after I started and followed me all the way, it was so cold and I was obliged to walk in a great coat and muffled up. I was completely wet through that I looked like a drowned rat. I was in these parts a month, most of the time it was cold and wet. \" Richard Weaver, letter to J.C. Dale regarding a visit to the Lake District in July 1843. *My Italics.\n\nIn 1809 Thomas Stothard found for the first time in Britain Erebia epiphron in the mountains of the English Lake District. Haworth (1812) described the butterfly as Papilio Mnemon and recorded that Stoddard's specimens were in the collection of John Francillon, the London jeweller. Stoddard gave details of the discovery of E. epiphron to John Curtis and James Charles Dale and during their visit to the Lake District in 1827, they visited the locality, Red Screes north of Ambleside in June and took a long series but rather surprisingly only captured the males. Weaver arrived at Ambleside on July 1, 1827, Curtis and Dale having left the village a few days previously and shortly afterwards he discovered the first females of E. epiphron on the Langdale Pikes. Just a few days later on July 8, Thomas Marshall of Keswick also took both sexes of E. epiphron at Styhead Tarn at the head of Borrowdale.\n\nJames Francis Stephens was first to figure E. epiphron under the name Hipparchia cassiope Fabricius 1787 in his Illustrations of British Entomology, vol 1, (1828) with specimens provided by Weaver that he had collected the previous year.\n\nHipparchia cassiope = Erebia epiphron Mnemon.

OUMNH.\n\nA new British butterfly, Erebia epiphron scotica Cooke 1943.\n\nVisiting Kinloch Rannoch, Perthshire in 1844, Weaver was exploring the surrounding hills when at 3000 feet he found a small Erebia. He sent specimens to Edward Newman who compared them to specimens in the British Museum and to those in Henry Doubleday's collection, and to a series of German specimens in Mr Becker's collection. Both Newman and Doubleday, concluded that Weaver's specimens he had captured in Scotland were Erebia melampus Boisduval. E. melampus was originally described by Füssli in 1775 from the Alps of Central Europe.\n\nErebia epiphron scotica female, Weaver, Rannoch. Dale coll OUMNH.\n\nNewman announced the new British butterfly in the Zoologist (1844) and gave details provided by Weaver of its discovery. \" I took these butterflies when the sun shone, morning and evening, the first on the 27th of June, and the last on the 27th July. They appeared confined to a spot of level and rather marshy ground, about 150 yards in length and 50 in breadth ; it was grassy, but without heath, and although there was plenty of heath all round the neighbourhood, I did not see a single specimen settle on it. The locality is among rocky mountains some of which attain an altitude of 4000 feet above the sea, and I think the spot where I found the butterflies is at least 3000 feet. I spent tens days in hunting them, and although I wandered over most of the country for ten or fifteen miles around, I found them nowhere else. The nearest village is Kinloch Rannoch, consisting of a few scattered houses, one of which is a shop for sundries, two are pot houses, and the remainder are principally the residences of shepherds. It has no road to any other place.\"\n\nAt the time Newman was writing the study of Erebia was in its infancy and he knew of only four species of this genus in Europe. By 1847 Hawley and Guns had recognized that Weaver's Scotch Mountain Ringlet was not Erebia melampus but belonged to the same species as the butterfly from the English Lake District that they referred to as E. cassiope Fabricius, 1787, a junior synonym of Erebia epiphron Knoch, 1783. This did not please Weaver, it was bad enough that Hawley and Guns in their privately printed Catalogue of British Lepidoptera, published in December 1846, not only had they omitted his capture of Boloria dia but they also had expunged his new Scottish Erebia. Weaver (1847) stated that \" Twenty years ago I captured Erebia Cassiope, in abundance, on the highest moorland at the top of Langdale Pikes, 2400 feet in height. I found them on a spot that inclines to the south, overlooking the little tarn, and near to the pointed rocks known by the name of Stickle Pikes. I recommend any entomologist that may be in that part of the kingdom in July to search the above spot. I have no doubt whatever in my mind that the insects I captured there are quite a different species from those of the same genus taken by me in Perthshire, on similar elevation, land and foliage. \"\n\nWeaver was correct that the Scottish butterflies were different from those occurring in the mountains of the Lake District, sufficiently so for them to be recognized today as two separate subspecies. Trinomial nomenclature had yet to be introduced, so many entomologists regarded what we now know to be subspecies as different species because of the differences in their morphology.\n\nHawley (1847) remarked that all dubious British species in their catalouge were submitted to Henry Doubleday who was now in little doubt that the Scottish specimens collected by Weaver were a local variety of E. Cassiope = E. epiphron and not E. melampus as he originally thought and could not therefore be admitted to the British list.\n\nReferences.\n\nHawley J. R. & Guns A. J.

Macleay (the secretary of the Linnean society) visited the Isle of Arran for grouse shooting in August. During their visit they also collected butterflies, and Walker stated that among their specimens of Papilio blandina Fabricius, 1787, a junior Synonym of Erebia aethiops Esper, 1777, were several specimens of Erebia ligea that was to become known to British entomologists as the Arran Brown.\n\nIn 1825 James Charles Dale & John Curtis made a collecting tour of Central Scotland. Reaching the Isle of Arran, situated in the Firth of Clyde in western Scotland on July 25, they searched the moors around Brodick Castle on the east coast, hoping to find E. ligea, where Walker had stated he had caught his specimens but they could only find E. aethiops. The two entomologists became aware that at least E. aethiops occurred in other localities in Scotland, as they observed it near Loch Awe, Argyll and Dale records taking the butterfly on August 9 at Loch Katrine, Stirling, previously it had only been known from Arran and the Isle of Bute. A few years later, E. aethiops was discovered at Castle Eden Dene, Durham in northern England, Stephens (1828) noting that the English specimens differed from those found in Scotland.\n\nHipparchia ligea. J.F. Stephens (1828) Illustrations of British Entomology, vol 1, plate 6.\n\nErebia aethiops female. Arran. Dale collection. OUMNH.\n\nRichard Weaver's first collecting expedition to Scotland was in 1839, he travelled from Birmingham to Glasgow and from there to Oban on the west coast, where he did a little collecting and then went on to the Isle of Arran where he spent three months hoping to secure E. ligea. He wrote to Dale (1841)\" I hunted well for ligea I could not find one wing, I have taken a good lot of Blandina (* E. aethiops) fine, but they are quite a dead letter. I cannot sell them for £5 or £1.\" Clearly E. ligea was proving an elusive butterfly and even the most resourceful of collectors were failing to capture one. * My italics.\n\nWeaver reached Arran again in August 1842, where he spent three weeks in search of E. ligea but once again the butterfly proved to be elusive, he writes \" I travelled onward along the canal towards Greenock, and passed on to the Isle of Arran, in hopes of obtaining Erebia Ligea: I had seen two specimens of this insect in the cabinet of the late Mr Stephens, which were captured by the late Sir Patrick Walker, on the moors at the back of Brodick Castle, when out one day grouse shooting : I was informed by Mr Stephens that he received that statement from Sir Patrick himself : I have tried that locality three different seasons without finding the insect, still I do not despair.\" Weaver was back in Arran in 1844 and still there was no sign of the fabled butterfly.\n\nThere are apparently a few other specimens of E. Ligea in old collections labelled Scotland but they must remain as unauthenticated as no one as been able to discover a viable population, in the Isle of Arran or for that matter anywhere else in Scotland. Salmon (2000) recorded that in 1977, a young member T.J. Daley arrived at a British Entomology and Natural History Meeting with a box containing E. aethiops when it was noticed that among them was a specimen of E. ligea, that he said was captured with the others on the edge of Rannoch Moor in 1969. All the current authorities list the butterfly as a non-native British species.\n\nReferences.\n\nSalmon M. (2000) Aurelian Legacy\n\nStephens J.F.

It is absent from Britain, South-west France, North Germany, Fennoscandia, South Italy and the Mediterranean islands except north Sicily.\n\nDuring a visit to Weaver's Museum of Natural History Curiosities in Temple Row, Birmingham in 1832, the Reverend William Thomas Bree was examining specimens of Boloria selene, when he noticed that two were unusual ; he figured one of the specimens in the Magazine of Natural History (1832) and wrote \" Fig. 124 is a very interesting insect, allied to Melitaea selene; of perhaps, it may be only a variety. Mr Weaver possesses two specimens, both of which were taken in Sutton Park; one about ten years ago ; the other, not more than five or six. I would invite the attention of entomologists to this insect, which deserves minute investigation \". Later, Thomas Marshall took the unusual specimens to London where they were determined as Melitaea (Boloria) dia.\n\nWilliam Thomas Bree. Drawings and description of Melitaea dia. Magazine of Natural History, vol 5, 1832.\n\nIn a letter sent to James Charles Dale in 1843, Weaver stated \" Sir I would not have troubled you with this only for the doubt that some express of me taking M. dia. On my honour as a man I assure you that I did take those two insects that Mr Marshall took up to London and they were pronouced the true dia. I took them within 10 miles of this town but the precise spot I do not know. I had them some time before I thought them different or even noticed them. In examining my insects later I thought it looked different. I have never exchanged this insect with anyone nor had foreign specimens. \" One of Weaver's B. dia is in the Dale collection at the Oxford University Museum of Natural History. Whether J.C. Dale bought the specimen from Weaver or it was purchased later at auction by his son, Charles William Dale, is not recorded.\n\nOne of the famous specimens of Boloria dia from Richard Weaver. Dale collection, OUMNH.\n\nIn a review of the butterflies that J.O. Westwood has included in his Transformations of British butterflies, published in parts 1840 & 1841, which were then issued complete in a book form; Edward Newman in the Entomologist (1842) thought that author had included too many species which were questionably British and gave his opinion of all those species that Westwood had included. He wrote \" Melitaea Dia. This one of those insects on which it is difficult to give a decided opinion. The author states \" Found by Mr Weaver several times near Birmingham, and also near Aldery in Cheshire by Mr Stanley. \" Without suspecting the least disposition on the part of these gentlemen to mislead, there seems to me a possibility of a mistake through the unintentional mixing of British and foreign specimens. It is an inquiry of a great interest, and the species should neither be received nor rejected without abundant evidence.\"\n\nWeaver replied to Newman's statement in the Zoologist (1845) \" at page 267 of the Entomologist (No. xvii.), published in March 1842, you throw some doubts upon the fact of the reported capture of Melitaea in this country ; and remark the ascertaining of such fact is \" an enquiry of great interest.\" Now, I have the pleasure of positively stating, that I had the good fortune to capture two specimens of that new insect in one of my early entomological excursions, more than twenty years ago. I must have taken them within ten miles of Birmingham. : that being the utmost extent to which I had then travelled in search of insects. No sooner had I discovered that I possessed such a treasure, than I carefully separated them from my specimens of M. selene, for which I had mistaken. For the last twenty years, having been much occupied in exploring various remote parts of the United Kingdom, I have had but little time or opportunity to travel over my old grounds in the neighbourhood of Birmingham, or visit, at the proper season, the spot which I believe I can confidently point out as where my specimens of dia must have been taken. Very shortly after the discovery of what my specimens probably were, they were taken to London by Mr Marshall, the well known entomologist, and ascertained to be the true M. dia. Much has been said by some gentlemen about mixing foreign specimens of insects with British. No one can condemn the practice more strongly than myself. Yet I really think that there is little justice or good feeling accusing, or even suspecting an entomologist of such unpardonable negligence, without something more than surmise of the fact. Now I can very confidently state that, until long after the time when the two specimens of M. Dia fell into my hands, I never bought, nor exchanged, any insects ; and that I possessed not a single foreign specimen : so that I could not possibly have confounded those of my own capture with others. I regret that I was, till lately, ignorant of the remarks in the Entomologist ; otherwise this statement would have reached you at a much earlier date.\"\n\nWhat is interesting about Weaver's reply to Newman he seems unclear when and where he actually took the two specimens of B. dia and does not mention the locality that he told Bree, Sutton Park near Tamworth, seven miles to the north of Birmingham. Weaver's Fritillary was omitted from the British list when Hawley and Guns published their Catalogue of British Lepidoptera in 1846. This of course did not please Weaver, and he posted a note in the Zoologist (1847) that he saw no justification for the expulsion of dia from the British list. Hawley (1847) in a reply gave his reasons for the omission of the butterfly \" of Dia, I have understood the box in which one at least of Mr Weaver's two specimens was found, had been some time out of his possession, and he believed it to contain only M. Euphrosyne, a larger species and very distinct, there seems to have some doubt whether Dia was actually his own capture, or had been introduced amongst his specimens by someone else without his knowledge.\" Does Hawley's comment solve the mystery of Weaver's B. dia. If the box was out of Weaver's possession it must have been before 1832 when the two B. dia specimens were noticed by Bree among those of B. selene in his museum. Hawley had this information from Henry Doubleday who they had submitted their list of all the known British butterflies for his comments. Did some unknown person place the B. dia in a box of Weaver's specimens that he returned to him with perhaps either innocent or malicious intentions, and then Weaver convinced himself that he must have taken them at Sutton Park, where he took specimens of B. selene and B. euphrosyne, this can only be speculation.\n\nWeaver it appears wrote to Newman again, who was not convinced that B. dia was a British butterfly, he added a note in the Zoologist (1847) \" I have received, from Mr Weaver and others, communications concerning this butterfly : all of them, like those already published, appear to me inconclusive. If this insect really is British, I cannot doubt it will again occur, and so the matter will be settled to the satisfaction of all parties : at present the evidence, as furnished by Mr Weaver himself, appears unsatisfactory ; and I agree with those entomologists who decline to introduce the name into the British list.\"\n\nThe Reverend B. Smith reported in The Entomologist's Weekly Intelligencer (1857) that a village lad had knocked a specimen of dia down with his cap at Marlow, Buckinghamshire and had given it to a young collector, The Hon C.A. Ellis. Smith who sent the specimen to Doubleday for confirmation. Smith writes \" \" he pronounced it to be Argynnis Dia, and through the liberality of Mr Ellis, the specimen is now in my collection. This fact will give deserved pleasure to Mr Richard Weaver, whose capture of Dia near Sutton Coldfield years ago, thus receives confirmation.\" In the ensuring pages of the Intelligencer, this supposed capture of B. dia at Marlow caused a lot of controversy and ridicule, until the editor Henry Tibbats Stainton put an end to the heated exchanges.\n\nWeaver wrote two notes concerning butterflies to the Zoologist in November 1857 which he did not live to see published, as they appeared after his death in 1858. In one of the notes, 'A remark on Melitaea Dia', he writes \" I see by the Intelligencer (iii 60) that there is a record of the capture of a third specimen of Melitaea Dia.\" (*the Marlow specimen). B. dia did turn up again on a few rare occasions in Britain but all are thought be either deliberate or accidental introductions. * My italics.\n\nReferences.\n\nBree W.T.
