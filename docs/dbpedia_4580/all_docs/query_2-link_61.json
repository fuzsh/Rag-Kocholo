        "text": "Jean-Édouard Vuillard (11 November 1868 – 21 June 1940) was a French painter and printmaker associated with the Nabis.\n\nIn his paintings and decorative pieces, Vuillard depicted mostly interiors, streets, and gardens. Marked by a gentle humour, they are executed in the delicate range of soft, blurred colours characteristic of his art. Living with his mother, a dressmaker, until the age of sixty, Vuillard was very familiar with interior and domestic spaces. Much of his art reflected this influence, largely decorative and often depicting very intricate patterns."
