        "text": "After capturing our hearts on the Disney Channel, Joe Jonas has become a multi-hyphenate creative: singer, songwriter, actor, and entrepreneur. The artist relaunched The Jonas Brothers with his siblings Nick and Kevin after a six-year hiatus, and has also made chart-topping songs as part of the band DNCE. And when he's not in the studio, he's acting. His newest project is the biographical war drama Devotion, where he stars alongside Glen Powell and Jonathan Majors.\n\nOn top of Jonas' stacked workload, he's now adding a new gigâ€”bartender. He partnered with Tanqueray to launch his own gin-based cocktail, appropriately named \"Cup of Joe.\" It pairs Tanqueray London Dry gin with coffee liqueur, cold brew concentrate, and tonic for a boozy drink with plenty of caffeine. We caught up with Jonas to talk about this new collaboration, his experience on the set of Devotion, and his go-to spots to grab coffee and cocktails.\n\nGabby Romero: I saw the recipe for Cup of Joe, and I'm super interested in how you came up with this cocktail. What was your inspiration?\n\nJoe Jonas: Well, most of my life I wasn't a coffee drinker, but somebody was like, \"You need to drink coffee. Your name is Joe, you're gonna have a cup this morning.\" So I started becoming a coffee lover and coffee connoisseur and finding my favorite coffee shops around the U.S. Then internationally when I started touring, and then I fell in love with Tanqueray and their gin.\n\nSpending a lot of time in the UK, I just wanted to be able to have a fun time learning. Especially during the lockdown. I was doing a lot of cocktail-making at home. And this was one that I felt like mixed a few of my favorite loves, coffee and Tanqueray gin, and finding a nice balance of flavors. It kind of reminds me of an Espresso Martini, but I haven't really experienced anything like this before. And I find it just delicious and something that is the right cocktail to start the night off right.\n\nI love the idea of having it like at the start of a night, but what other ways would you feel like Cup of Joe is best enjoyed?\n\nThat's a good question. I really love my Cup of Joe. I think it's delicious. If you're having a dinner party, or even at the end of the day if you're just trying to relax. It's a good holiday drink as well if you're on vacation. There's something about the coffee aspect that I feel is very versatile. You can really incorporate some of your favorite kinds of coffee liqueurs that you might like.\n\nHave any of your co-stars or bandmates tried the cocktail yet?\n\nOh, yeah, definitely. I had a few friends just this past weekend come in town for my birthday, which was really sweet. And we had a couple of the Cup of Joe's, which was great. Everyone seemed to really enjoy themselves.\n\nSo you mentioned earlier that you first or you fell in love with Tanqueray while you were in the UK on tour? What was your first experience drinking Tanqueray?\n\nI mean, I might not be able to remember my first, but I can definitely say that Tanqueray was the first gin I tried in a cocktail. That was like my first real experience of being impressed with the different styles of cocktails that they make with gin, especially in the UK. And I became a big fan. And I was like, \"Okay, this is definitely something I can I try to do myself\" and continued my hand at making really great cocktails. And I love to try to find like little speakeasies around each city when we're touring. It's a fun little activity, especially before the show or after a show you just have tons of energy. It's hard for you to just go back to the hotel room and fall asleep.\n\nI'm interested in these speakeasy experiences, especially around the world. What are some of the best ones you've been to?\n\nYeah, there's one at 69 Colebrooke Row in London called The Bar with No Name. It's a little speakeasy that I stumbled onto with a buddy of mine. And I just had the best cocktails. And I was just a fan and I found it really exciting to try these places while we're traveling. There's so many great bars and great little cocktail bars that you can discover pretty much in each city, and that became a nice pastime. Start with the best coffee in town and find the best cocktail.\n\nOkay, now I have to ask: What is your favorite coffee shop that you've been to?\n\nNow this is a tough one. But I'll say probably my favorite coffee shop, honestly in the world, is here in Miami. It could be one of the reasons I live here. Not far from my house is a place called Suite Habana Cafe. Delicious Cuban coffee. I've become friends with the couple who owns the coffee shop. They're really good people and they serve delicious, delicious coffee. It's just great. And it's always nice to support a small business and especially people that are hardworking and just beautiful souls. I can't recommend that more.\n\nOh, for sure. So this is a little bit of a sidebar, but I'm interested in your movie Devotion that's coming out later this fall. It seems like a departure from your other acting work. How is this project different than what you've done before? And what did you learn throughout the process?\n\nI'm really proud of the film. I can't wait for people to see it. I saw it a couple months ago before the CGI had been done and I can't wait to see it again. The film was brought to my attention I think at the end of 2020. Yeah, wow. It's crazy. It's been a while. And we had the whole audition process but in the middle of pandemic, so it was all taking place via Zoom. It's based off a book, and it's an absolutely beautiful story about Navy Air Force pilots and the camaraderie and friendship that these guys had for each other.\n\nI don't want to give too much away, but there's also a lot of emotion attached to it and I was challenged. I was with incredible actors. Jonathan Majors and Glen Powell lead this film and they really set the bar. When you show up on set every day, you have to bring your A game. And so I was really challenged and really inspired. I loved the process. It'll be out Thanksgiving weekend and I can't wait for people to see it.\n\nYeah, I'm really excited to see it too. Okay, I have one last question for you: what else do you have in store this fall?\n\nWell, I got some Jonas Brothers shows just announced, some shows in Vegas. I can't wait for people to come out to see the show that we've been putting together. We really tried to make an effort to change up this live show and make it special. Each show has something new, like playing songs we haven't played in years.\n\nAnd then on top of that, DNCE and I are playing a show for the US Open. And we have a couple shows in Mexico that kind of kick off the fall. Me and my brothers are going down there for four or five shows. We haven't been there since pre-pandemic. So this is like, really, really exciting. And I can't wait to go back and see.\n\nâ€”"
