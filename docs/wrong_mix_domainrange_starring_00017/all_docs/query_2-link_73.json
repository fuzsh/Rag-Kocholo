        "text": "Joe Jonas had a boys’ night out with his brother Nick one day before his estranged wife, Sophie Turner, sued him for “wrongfully” retaining their two kids.\n\nIn photos obtained by Page Six, the “Cake By the Ocean” singer and his younger brother met up on Wednesday night with some friends in NYC at Waverly Inn, which is three blocks away from where Turner and his other ex Taylor Swift went out the night before.\n\nThe Jonas Brothers musicians appeared to be having a deep conversation as they enjoyed their meals.\n\nAn eyewitness also told Page Six exclusively that “no one seemed sad” after greeting each with “smiles and hugs.”\n\nNick, 31, and Joe, 34, dressed casually for the outing, both wearing baseball caps and white shirts.\n\nThe husband of Priyanka Chopra, however, opted to rock a pair of blue pants, while his older brother paired his white tee with a pair of brown trousers.\n\nTheir night out came hours before Turner, 27, filed a bombshell lawsuit against her estranged husband, alleging that he “wrongfully retained” their two daughters by not returning them to her home country, England.\n\nIn court docs obtained by Page Six, the “Game of Thrones” alum filed the lawsuit in a Manhattan court Thursday, requesting to secure “the immediate return of children wrongfully removed or wrongfully retained.”\n\nPer the docs, Turner claimed the “wrongful retention” began Wednesday.\n\nThe actress claimed that she and Joe agreed last Christmas to make the UK their “forever home” and talked about looking for schools for their older daughter, Willa, to attend there.\n\n“The parties were both excited for the family’s move to England,” read the documents.\n\nThe pair — who tied the knot in 2019 — officially relocated from Miami to England in April, according to the documents.\n\nFor more Page Six you love…\n\nListen to our weekly “We Hear” podcast\n\nShop our exclusive merch\n\nThat summer, Turner began filling “Joan” nearby in Spain while the “Sucker” singer kicked off the Jonas Brothers’ tour with his siblings in NYC in August.\n\nThe “Dark Phoenix” star said she allowed Joe to take the girls with him because he was able to spend more time with the 3- and 1-year-old girls during the day.\n\nHowever, three weeks after the couple got into an argument on Aug. 15, Joe filed for divorce in Miami, stating that the marriage was “irretrievably broken.”\n\nTurner claimed in the docs that she found out about the filing “through the media.”\n\nThe mom of two is now claiming that her estranged husband is withholding their daughters’ passports so they can’t leave the US.\n\n“The Father has possession of the children’s passports,” the documents stated. “He refuses to return the passports to the Mother and refuses to send the children home to England with the Mother.”\n\nFollowing Turner’s lawsuit, Joe fired back, insisting that he did not “abduct” their children.\n\nIn a statement from his rep, the DNCE frontman called the lawsuit a “harsh legal position” that goes against the “amicable co-parenting setup” he believed he and Turner were working toward as recently as last weekend.\n\n“Joe is seeking shared parenting with the kids so that they are raised by both their mother and father, and is of course also okay with the kids being raised both in the US and the UK,” his rep said, adding that the young children about both American citizens.\n\nThe singer’s rep also told Page Six that Turner was “aware” he was going to file for divorce following “multiple conversations.”"
