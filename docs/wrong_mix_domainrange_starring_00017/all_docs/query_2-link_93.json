        "text": "Joe Jonas' new solo album is the \"most personal\" music he's ever put out, amid his shock split with Sophie Turner.\n\nThe Jonas Brothers star revealed his \"emotional\" new record is like 'sharing his journal', so it was too personal to release with his brothers. Joe, 34, and Sophie, 28, decided to call it quits in September 2023 after four years of marriage and two children together, Willa, four, and Delphine, one.\n\nJoe has described his new music as \"all over the place\", explaining: \"There’s some real beautiful ballads, there’s some songs about being a dad, there’s songs about love, there’s songs about being better to yourself - kind of everything.\"\n\nSpeaking about his new single Work It Out, released next Friday, he said: \"We wrote it really quickly. The idea is that sometimes you realise that you just have to shake yourself out of something and you’re the only person that’s going to fix it for yourself - no-one’s going to come save you. It’s an emotional lyric with fun music.”\n\nSpeaking to Therapuss podcast, Joe said: \"I needed to go and express some stuff, just for myself. I had a window of time and I locked myself away with a bunch of incredible singer-songwriters. We made an album in like two weeks. I’m really, really excited. Ut’s the most personal music I’ve ever put out.\"\n\nSince the split, Sophie has spoken out about the difficult time and the effect it had on her as a mother. Speaking about her and Joe's split, she told Vogue: \"I mean, those were the worst few days of my life. There were some days that I didn’t know if I was going to make it.\n\nThe Game of Thrones actress continued: \"And then, finally, after two weeks of me being in a rut, she [my lawyer] reminded me that it was my children I was fighting for. Once anyone says to me, 'Do it for your kids,' I’m doing it. I wouldn’t do it for myself, but I’ll find the strength for them.\"\n\nSince splitting last year, Joe has reportedly moved on with model Stormi Bree, while Sophie has already sparked engagement rumours after being spotted with a sparkler on her ring finger. The actress has been seeing British aristocrat Peregrine \"Perry\" Pearson, and the couple made it official with an Instagram post in January 2024.\n\nDuring a recent romantic break in Capri, Italy, Sophie was spotted with a golden band on her left ring finger, while holding her iPhone and lighting a cigarette. They were first seen together in October 2023 at the Rugby World Cup Final together in Paris, where onlookers saw them chatting and kissing."
