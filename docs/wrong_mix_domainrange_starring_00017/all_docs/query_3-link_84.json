        "text": "Updated 3/3/20: For ELLE's April cover story, Sophie Turner gave even more details about the first time she met her husband, Joe Jonas.\n\nWhile working on a movie in 2016, one of the producers (who previously lived next door to the Jonas Brothers) told the actress, \"You should meet Joe Jonas. I feel like you would really get along with this guy.\" Afterward, a string of coincidences ensued. She recalled, \"I went to a meeting, and Joe's agent was in the room. And he was like, 'You remind me of one of my clients. I bet you two would really hit it off.'\"\n\nLater in the year, Jonas DMed her to ask if she wanted to hang out while he was in town touring. \"I was living with my friends in Camden, in a really rough flat—people were always climbing in and out of the windows,\" Turner said. \"When I told my friends, they were like, 'That's hilarious. You have to do it! And you have to text us everything he says.'\"\n\nShe didn't have the most favorable impression of him at first. \"I expected him to show up with security and everything,\" she continued. \"I thought, 'He's gonna be such a dick.' I brought all my guy friends to come with me to meet him, because in the back of my mind I still worried that he could be a catfish—or I don't know what. I just wanted my guy friends with me. I had my rugby boys. I was safe.\"\n\nShe also added that the location in question wasn't exactly the most romantic place. \"It was just this local shitty bar, dirty, with great music and people throwing up everywhere,\" Turner said. \"It was that kind of place. Kind of like the worst, but also kind of the best.\"\n\nAs fate would have it, Jonas and Turner hit it off straight away.\n\n\"He didn't bring security. He brought a friend, and they drank just as hard as the rest of us,\" she said. \"I remember the two of us spending only a couple of minutes on the dance floor, and then we just found a space far in the corner and we just talked. We talked for hours, and hours, and hours. And I was, like, not bored. It wasn't contrived. It wasn't small talk—it was just so easy. And soon we were, like, inseparable. I went on tour with him.\"\n\nActress Sophie Turner revealed in the May issue of Harper's BAZAAR UK that she met her fiancé, singer Joe Jonas of the Jonas Brothers and DNCE, through Instagram direct-message (DM).\n\nShe also dropped a hint about their upcoming wedding ceremony, which Jonas previously confirmed to James Corden will take place this summer.\n\nTurner also touched on how passionate her and Jonas' fanbases are. She also added that the JoBro fans are no longer hating on her for being in a relationship with their favorite brother.\n\nOriginal Story 4/1/19:\n\nGame of Thrones star Sophie Turner got candid about the surprisingly normal (and very millennial) way she and her fiancé, musician Joe Jonas, initially met in the May issue of Harper's BAZAAR UK.\n\nBefore the couple had even met in real life, they both followed each other on Instagram. Turner explained to the publication that they initially shared \"a lot of mutual friends,\" who wanted to \"introduce us for a long time.\"\n\n\"One fine day, out of the blue\" Jonas took his shot and direct-messaged her on Instagram, and the pair became engaged in 2017.\n\nIn a recent cover story for Rolling Stone, Turner defended becoming engaged when she was 21 and Jonas was 28. \"I think once you've found the right person, you just know,\" Turner, now 23, told the magazine. She added that she feels \"much older\" than her actual age, like 27 or 28.\n\nAlthough she understandably kept the details of their pending nuptials under wraps, the profile with Harper's BAZAAR UK revealed a precious moment about Turner's relationship with Jonas. The interview took place around Turner's 23rd birthday (February 21) and Jonas surprised her with a romantic gesture: a hotel room filled with hundreds of vibrant balloons including gold helium ones that said \"HAPPY BIRTHDAY\" attached to the wall.\n\nInterestingly enough, during a previous joint interview with his brothers/bandmates, Jonas confirmed to James Corden that he and Turner would tie the knot this summer.\n\nTurner also spoke about how passionate fans of both the Jonas Brothers and GoT feel about the band and cast's romantic relationships. When writer Sasha Slater asked if the JoBro fans hate her, Turner responded: \"Yeah, I guess so. It’s better now. His fans have gotten a bit older. If I’d been dating him during the years when he was appealing to the 14-year-old crowd, it might have been a bit more hostile.\"\n\nTurner did add that GoT fans are equally as invested in their faves's love life. \"The people who watch the show are quite protective of me because they’ve seen me grow up,\" she said. \"They write to him and say 'If you do anything to her...if you break her heart...' It’s sweet. I like it.\""
