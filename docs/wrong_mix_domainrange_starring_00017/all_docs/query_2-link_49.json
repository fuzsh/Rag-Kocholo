        "text": "Joe Jonas has taken pride in his high rating on WikiFeet.\n\nThe Jonas Brothers member appeared on an episode of Therapuss with Jake Shane last week to promote his latest solo music venture. The 34-year-old is releasing a solo song, Work It Out, on Friday July 19, which he premiered the chorus of on Jake's podcast.\n\nJoe shared with Jake that he found out that one of his body parts is highly rated online. His youngest brother, Frankie Jonas, shared with him recently that he was on WikiFeet, a website that showcases celebrity feet and grades them on a scale from one to five.\n\nClick here to follow the Mirror US on Google News to stay up to date with all the latest news, sport and entertainment stories.\n\nREAD MORE: Ice Spice's defiant response to Rolling Loud Europe festival audience booing Taylor Swift song\n\nREAD MORE: Woman auditions as 'new Hawk Tuah girl' in attempt to find fame wild street interview\n\n\"I was like, 'Oh cool, what's that?'\" Joe asked his brother and then went to the website himself to take a look. While on the site, Joe found out his feet were rated 4.9 out of 5.\n\nJoe proclaimed to Jake: \"I’d never been more proud in my life.\" He added: \"And by the way, ever since I got this rating, I’m taking care of these feet way more than I have been before.”\n\nHe isn't the first celebrity to realize how valuable feet could be, Lily Allen launched a foot-themed OnlyFans account earlier this month. \"So maybe I will get on OnlyFeet,\" Joe joked.\n\nThough Joe is about to release a solo song, he isn't turning his back on the Jonas Brothers, the band he has with his older brother Kevin Jonas and his younger brother Nick Jonas. At the beginning of this month, the group performed at the Festival d’été de Québec in Canada.\n\nHowever, Joe seemed to not want to reference his estranged wife, Sophie Turner, as he avoided a lyric that named a show she starred in. Joe was singing the band's hit song Cool which includes the lyric: \"Oh I feel like Post Malone when I get home, Sitting there winning like it's Game of Thrones.\"\n\nHe let the audience sing the part about the hit HBO show in which Sophie played Sansa Stark for all eight seasons. Joe and Sophie were married in Las Vegas in 2019 and Joe filed for divorce in September 2023."
