        "text": "Demi Moore is continuing her “Demi-sance” with a flirty new friendship with Joe Jonas, sources tell Page Six.\n\nThe 61-year-old actress — who stole the show at Cannes Film Festival with a series of attention-getting red-carpet looks — met the 34-year-old singer while in the South of France last month, according to insiders.\n\n“Demi and Joe have struck up a friendship. They have mutual friends and they bonded,” one well-placed source told us of the pair, who were seen having lunch together at the exclusive Hotel du Cap-Eden-Roc in Antibes, France.\n\nWhile one insider told us that things were already getting romantic, the well-placed source was quick to dispel any rumors of hanky-panky.\n\nMoore — whose new horror film, “The Substance,” was all the buzz at Cannes — hosted the amfAR gala during the festival, where Joe made a surprise appearance onstage alongside his brother Nick.\n\nWhile Nick, 31, was scheduled to perform at the event, it was the addition Joe for his band DNCE’s hit “Cake by the Ocean” that got the crowd out of their seats. Moore was seen dancing with Oscar winner Michelle Yeoh during the song.\n\nMoore was later spotted dining with Joe, his brother Kevin and supermodel Heidi Klum.\n\nWe’re told that Joe is also friends with Moore’s stylist Brad Goreski and her manager Jason Weinberg.\n\nThe new friendship comes on the heels of Joe’s break-up with model Stormi Bree, after five months of dating, as Page Six confirmed last month.\n\n“He’s been busy working on his solo album,” a source told Page Six at the time.\n\nJoe has been sharing photos from his vacation at the luxurious One&Only Portonovi resort in Montenegro in the Balkans, while Moore was last seen over the weekend in Vienna, Austria, at Cartier’s High Jewelry masquerade ball.\n\nThe singer and actress Sophie Turner called off their three-year marriage last September in what they said was a “united decision.” Things soon deteriorated as they battled for custody of their daughters, Willa, 3, and Delphine, 1.\n\nAfter weeks of back-and-forth, Jonas and the “Game of Thrones” star, 28, reached a temporary custody agreement in October. However, Turner asked a judge to reactivate their divorce in March after they failed to reach a settlement.\n\nDespite the drama, the actress — who is now dating aristocrat Peregrine “Perry” Pearson — told British Vogue in a revealing interview earlier this month that she and Joe are “doing the best [they] can.”\n\nMom of three Moore — who is also a grandmother to her daughter Rumer’s baby girl, Louetta — has largely been single since her divorce from her third husband, Ashton Kutcher, in 2011.\n\nShe remains extremely close to her second husband, Bruce Willis, the father of her children, who is suffering from frontotemporal dementia.\n\nRumer last week said her dad is doing “so good” and loves spending time with Louetta, 1, adding, “He’s a girl dad, through and through.”\n\nReps for Moore and Joe were unavailable for comment."
