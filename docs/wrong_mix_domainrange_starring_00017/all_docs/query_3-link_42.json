        "text": "Sophie Turner and Joe Jonas are spending the summer getting ready to welcome their baby, but they've also been working on another project of late. They took part in an at-home remake of The Princess Bride (1987) from Quibi. The project, benefitting World Central Kitchen, was directed by Juno's Jason Reitman and was shot entirely at home by the actors on their phones. Beginning June 29, Quibi will release chapters of the movie every day for two weeks.\n\nOn Friday, Vanity Fair released a first look of the movie, which shows Turner in the role of Westley (originally played by Cary Elwes) and Jonas playing Princess Buttercup (originally played by Robin Wright) in the scene where they escape the fire swap and face the Rodent Of Unusual Size (ROUS). Their corgi plays the ROUS.\n\nThe project stars couples Common and Tiffany Haddish, Neil Patrick Harris and David Burtka, and Chris Pine and Annabelle Wallis, as well as Hugh Jackman, Jennifer Garner, Elijah Wood, Jon Hamm, Beanie Feldstein, Lucas Hedges, Jenna Ortega, Jack Black, David Oyelowo, Keegan-Michael Key, Patton Oswalt, Josh Gad, Andy Serkis, Diego Luna, Taika Waititi, Zazie Beetz, and more. The celebrities each had their own creative take on a scene from the movie.\n\nFor example, here's Common and Hadish as Westley and Buttercup. You can also see Hugh Jackman getting very creative with some Legos.\n\nThis will surely be a home video Turner and Jonas show their kid one day."
