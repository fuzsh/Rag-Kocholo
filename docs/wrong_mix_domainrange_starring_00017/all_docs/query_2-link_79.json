        "text": "Joe Jonas and Sophie Turner are divorcing after four years of marriage.\n\nThe Jonas Brothers singer, 34, filed for divorce from the \"Game of Thrones\" actress, 27, in Miami-Dade County court on Tuesday, according to court documents reviewed by USA TODAY.\n\nThe petition for dissolution of marriage filed by Jonas states the reasoning as \"the marriage between the parties is irretrievably broken.\"\n\nThe couple spoke out in a joint statement Wednesday with posts to both of their Instagram accounts.\n\n\"After four wonderful years of marriage we have mutually decided to amicably end our marriage,\" they wrote. \"There are many speculative narratives as to why but, truly this is a united decision and we sincerely hope everyone can respect our wishes for privacy for us and our children.\"\n\nIn the petition, Jonas also requests \"shared parental responsibilities\" between himself and Turner for their two daughters as well as enforcement of their April 2019 prenuptial agreement.\n\n\"It is in the best interests of the minor children that the parties have shared parental responsibility,\" the petition reads. \"A parenting plan should be established, which addresses all parenting issues and contains a timesharing schedule providing for frequent and continuing contact with both parties.\"\n\nTheir 3-year-old daughter, Willa, and their second daughter, who was born in July 2022 and whose name remains private, have been living with Jonas in Miami \"and other locations throughout the United States,\" the petition adds. Turner is originally from Northampton, England.\n\nUSA TODAY has reached out to reps for Jonas and Turner for comment.\n\nJonas and Turner officially married in May 2019 in a low-key, Elvis impersonator-officiated Las Vegas ceremony after the Billboard Music Awards. They followed up with a significantly more upscale wedding in France in July 2019 and brought together family, friends and other recognizable stars to celebrate.\n\nJonas is currently on tour with the Jonas Brothers as the band's largest tour to date is underway, with more than 90 shows across 20 countries scheduled.\n\nTurner was recently in England filming the upcoming British TV series \"Joan.\"\n\nPublic separations are hard: Joe Jonas, Sophie Turner and when divorce gossip won't quit\n\nSophie Turner and Joe Jonas were 'inseparable' soon after meeting\n\nThe British actress met her husband-to-be after a movie producer and Jonas' agent, on different occasions, mentioned to Turner that she would \"hit it off\" with Jonas, she told ELLE in 2020.\n\nJonas later DM'ed her while touring in the U.K. and they met up for drinks.\n\n\"I expected him to show up with security and everything. I thought, 'He’s gonna be such a (expletive),'\" Turner recalled. \"He didn't bring security. He brought a friend, and they drank just as hard as the rest of us. I remember the two of us spending only a couple of minutes on the dance floor, and then we just found a space far in the corner and we just talked. We talked for hours, and hours, and hours. And I was, like, not bored.\"\n\nShe added, \"It wasn't contrived. It wasn't small talk – it was just so easy. And soon we were, like, inseparable.\"\n\nDubbed \"Jophie,\" Turner and Jonas were known for not taking themselves too seriously, like when she roasted her husband during Netflix's Jonas Brothers Family Roast for wearing a purity ring as a teen.\n\nSophie Turner advocates for her kids’ privacy after accidentally posting daughter on Instagram\n\nSophie Turner supported the Jonas Brothers on tour right before splitting with Joe\n\nTurner also said her sisters-in-law, Nick Jonas' wife Priyanka Chopra-Jonas and Kevin Jonas' wife Danielle Jonas, were another perk of being part of his family.\n\n\"It's also nice to have built-in girlfriends who are actually really cool, who I can hang out with and we can really talk to each other about, like, how crazy the boys' lives are,\" she told ELLE. \"We can relate on so many different levels. It's like, thank God, because you never know (about your in-laws).\"\n\nPrior to their split, Turner was a regular at Jonas Brothers concerts alongside Danielle Jonas and Chopra-Jonas. She was in the crowd at their The Tour kickoff in August, and during the boy band's five-night concert residency on Broadway in May, Joe Jonas dedicated the song \"Hesitate,\" which he'd written for his wife, to Turner.\n\n\"Sophie, where you at? There's not much to say, but I love you,\" he said during the show.\n\n\"I will take your pain / And put it on my heart / I won't hesitate / Just tell me where to start,\" he crooned to her.\n\nTurner celebrated the band's tour launch last month by posting photos of herself at the sold-out Yankee Stadium performances. In the first photo of her Aug. 14 Instagram post, she is walking backstage with Jonas as she kisses their clasped hands.\n\nContributing: Anika Reed, Hannah Yasharoff, Sara Moniuszko, USA TODAY"
