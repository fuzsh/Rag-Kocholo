        "text": "Ever since Sophie Turner and Joe Jonas announced their engagement in 2017, the Game of Thrones actress and Jonas brother have been one of the internet's favourite celebrity couples, but sadly the pair recently confirmed their divorce with a joint statement.\n\nThe pair have been together for seven years, and married for four, while they also share two daughters. Here's a look back at all the best bits of their relationship, starting with the most recent point of interest and then back to the very beginning...\n\nMay 2024: Sophie Turner opens up about her 2023 divorce from Joe Jonas, admitting they were the worst days of her life.\n\nIn a new interview with Vogue, the actor shared she was filming Joan in the UK when news of her divorce spread, and was unable to be with her children. \"I mean, those were the worst few days of my life,\" the 28-year-old shared. \"I remember I was on set, I was contracted to be on set for another two weeks, so I couldn’t leave.\n\n\"My kids were in the States and I couldn’t get to them because I had to finish Joan. And all these articles started coming out. It hurt because I really do completely torture myself over every move I make as a mother – mum guilt is so real! I just kept having to say to myself: ‘None of this is true. You are a good mum and you’ve never been a partier.'\"\n\nShe also shared that she was experiencing the dating world for the first time, revealing, \"I am having fun dating. It’s very fun. I mean, it’s strange when you get married so young. It’s like you never really learn how to date. So it’s all very new to me.\"\n\n5 November 2016: Rumours that the pair are dating start swirling when the Jonas brother is spotted with his arm around Sophie at the MTV EMAs.\n\nShe later tells Marie Claire that the couple met through mutual friends.\n\n-28 November 2016: A mutual friend shares an adorable photo on Instagram showing the couple larking around in a photobooth at someone's wedding. Also in the photo is another Jonas Bro, Nick, presumably meaning Sophie had already met the family at this point.\n\n5 December 2016: Sophie and Joe are photographed looking all cute in north London after going out for lunch at the pub with Sophie's family.\n\n1 January 2017: Sophie finally seems to confirm her new romance when she shares a picture of Joe smoking a cigar on a boat in Miami.\n\n10 January 2017: At the Golden Globes, Sophie is asked directly about \"going out with Joe\" by Extra TV host Mario Lopez. She gives a coy yet cute yet slightly awks response: \"I'm not saying anything... I'm very happy.\"\n\n14 February 2017: Joe Jonas is witnessed being the perfect Instagram boyfriend when he comments on a picture of Sophie with a flame emoji.\n\n6 March 2017: Sophie and Joe touch down in Paris for fashion week and are pictured at the airport holding hands.\n\n2 May 2017: The couple attend the Met Gala but do not pose on the red carpet together.\n\n5 July 2017: Sophie talks about Joe in an interview for Marie Claire. She reiterates that she's happy, says he is romantic and snorts when she's presented with the couple name fans have given them: Jophie.\n\nShe also vents her frustrations of what comes with being in a high-profile relationship.\n\n\"You do feel like you’re living in a fishbowl… It’s frustrating [that] it’s the most mundane things that make the news – how boring! There are really no other headlines?\"\n\nJuly 2017: In an interview with The Sunday Times, Sophie states: \"I'm in a relationship, but it's a very private relationship.\"\n\n5 September 2017: The couple take a more serious step when they jointly adopt an adorable husky puppy.\n\nSophie uploads a picture of her and Joe's new puppy, who's named Porky Basquiat, and the two are spotted taking it for a walk around New York City days later.\n\n15 October 2017: Which brings us nicely up to October, where less than a year later, the couple are engaged.\n\nHooray!\n\n11 April 2018: Sophie makes a very important point in an interview when she's asked about her engagement, stressing that she doesn't see the milestone as an \"achievement\" but, instead, just a lovely addition to her life.\n\n“I’m still like, Holy sh*t! I’m engaged,\" she tells Marie Claire. \"There’s this weird misconception that being married is the greatest thing that’ll ever happen to you. But I’ve always found that my career is something I work for, and when I achieve something, there’s a sense that this is the greatest thing I’ll do in my life. It’s lovely to be engaged. Not like I achieved anything, but I found my person, like I’d find a house that I love and want to stay in forever. There’s a sense of peace that comes with finding your person. But there’s a drive that comes with your career.”\n\nHere for it.\n\n4 December 2018: Before Sophie and Joe get married there's another Jonas wedding to attend first. Nick Jonas and Priyanka Chopra get married in a lavish multi-day ceremony in India and Sophie and Joe are there to share in the beautiful celebrations.\n\n25 December 2018: Sophie and Joe spend Christmas with both of their families in England. Cute!\n\n1 March 2019: Sophie has a starring role in the Jonas Brothers' The Favourite-esque music video for their comeback single 'Sucker', along with the 'Jonas sisters' Priyanka and Kevin's wife, Danielle.\n\n26 March 2019: Sophie stars on the cover of Rolling Stone with her GOT BFF Maisie Williams and talks about getting engaged at a relatively young age. She also spoke candidly about sexuality, saying she believes you love a soul, not a person, and her soul is Joe.\n\n\"I was fully preparing myself to be single for the rest of my life. I think once you've found the right person, you just know. I feel like I'm much older a soul than I am in age. I feel like I've lived enough life to know. I've met enough guys to know - I've met enough girls to know. I don’t feel 22. I feel like 27, 28.”\n\n“Everyone experiments,” she says with a shrug. “It’s part of growing up. I love a soul, not a gender.”\n\n31 March 2019: Sophie stars on the cover of Harper's Bazaar where she reveals her relationship with Joe started in true Millennial fashion: Via a DM.\n\n\"We had a lot of mutual friends and they'd been trying to introduce us for a long time,\" the 23-year-old told the magazine. \"We were following each other on Instagram and he direct-messaged me one fine day, out of the blue.\"\n\nShe also provided an update on the upcoming wedding, saying they're both trying to \"keep it as low-key as possible\" and make it \"more of an intimate thing\".\n\n2 May 2019: Sophie and Joe tied the knot in a classic Las Vegas ceremony straight after hitting the Billboard awards.\n\nTheir nuptials were held at the famous Little White Wedding Chapel and officiated by an Elvis Presley tribute act. The DJ Diplo (who also took to the decks later in the evening) shared videos of the ceremony on Instagram, where fellow Jonas brothers Kevin and Nick can be seen serving as groomsmen. Sophie looked gorgeous in a white jumpsuit and veil.\n\n7 May 2019: Sophie and Joe walk their first red carpet as a married couple, and they look dreamy.\n\nAnd just look at the co-ordinated outfits. Bravo, Jophie. Bravo.\n\n19 May 2018: On the day the final ever episode of Game of Thrones ends and Sophie officially retires as Sansa Stark, Sophie credits her husband with \"saving her life\" as she discusses meeting him aged 20 when she was particularly struggling with her mental health.\n\n\"I was going through this phase of being very mentally unwell,\" she tells The Sunday Times in an interview. \"He was like, 'I can't be with you until you love yourself, I can't see you love me more than you love yourself.' That was something, him doing that. I think he kind of saved my life, in a way.\"\n\nThe actress also reveals how the couple once broke up... for a day. \"It was the worst day of our lives,\" she says. \"For a second, we both had cold feet, then 24 hours later we were both like, 'Never mind.'\"\n\nPhew.\n\n31 May 2019: New details about Sophie and Joe's wedding in France are revealed. “Joe and Sophie want to have a huge party,” a source told Us Weekly. “The decor is going to be sophisticated, but there’ll be some kitschy elements, including a really wild cake. There’ll be a live band, and the Jonas Brothers are expected to take the stage.”\n\n6 June 2019 : Sophie Turner hilariously reveals husband Joe Jonas nearly kissed her stunt double, Megan Parkinson, on the set of Game Of Thrones.\n\nSpeaking on Nova's Smallzy's Surgery, Sophie commented, \"On Game of Thrones actually I had a photo double that people would do double takes at because she looked so much like me, it was insane. Even Joe went up to her at one point and tried to give her a kiss and he was like 'Oh, Sorry, sorry it's not Sophie, wrong one!\"\n\n27 June 2019: Sophie Turner shares naked photo of Joe Jonas in a bath tub during romantic holiday to France.\n\nJoe Jonas and Sophie Turner are having a huge wedding ceremony in France later this summer, and have been sharing an insight into their pre-nuptials holiday to Paris on Instagram. The latest snap from the Game Of Thrones star shows her future husband (well, they're technically already married) chilling in a luxurious-looking French claw-foot bathtub with a matching tub next to him, probably for Sophie. Oh, and he's most likely naked:\n\n28 June 2019: Sophie and Joe get married again. They may have tied the knot officially in Vegas the first time round, but they hosted a huge wedding ceremony in France on Saturday to make it extra legit.\n\nE! News reports the couple did \"I do\" round two in Sarrians, in the Provence region of southern France, where Sophie's fellow Game of Thrones actress and best friend Maisie Williams served as bridesmaid.\n\nThe second wedding sounds a lot less slapdash than the first, with E! News describing \"white elegant flowers and glass candles\" adorning the aisles, and a reception at a casual Château. No photographs of the day have emerged yet, but Sophie's dress is described as \"a long lace dress with sleeves. She had her hair down with a veil and had light makeup.\"\n\n4 July 2019: Sophie Turner and Joe Jonas share photos from their wedding in France. What a pair of babes.\n\n16 August 2019: Sophie Turner celebrates Joe Jonas turning 30 with some super soppy (and adorable) Instagram Stories, as well as turning up to a Jonas brothers gig with a cake on stage.\n\n\"Happy 30th to my love and the best thing that's ever happened to me @JoeJonas I love you,\" Sophie wrote on Instagram, along with a second photo which read, \"You are my world.\"\n\nHonestly, these two.\n\nJuly 2020: Super cute baby news alert! Joe and Sophie welcomed their first child together: a baby girl, who was born in Los Angeles. The news was broken by TMZ, who also reported that the couple have given their daughter the truly adorable name of 'Willa'.\n\nDecember 2020: Joe and Sophie, who welcomed daughter Willa in July, are enjoying a cosy pre-Christmas winter getaway. The couple were pictured bundled up in warm ski suits while out shopping in Mammoth Lakes, California, on 20th December.\n\nA source told E! News, \"They seem very happy and are spending a lot of time in the house they are staying in.\" The source adds, \"They went skiing and went to the local store to pick up some supplies.\"\n\nDecember 24, 2020: Sophie Turner has been giving fans a glimpse into life behind closed doors with more previously unseen photos from her early pregnancy.\n\nSharing the snaps to her Instagram Story as part of a fan Q&A, Sophie posted an adorable photo of her and Joe just before they found out they were expecting baby Willa. In a second post, Game of Thrones star Sophie revealed she was missing her baby bump, while a third hilarious snap showed her at her bachelorette party before tying the knot with Joe in 2019.\n\nKeep 'em coming, please.\n\n21 February 2021: Proving that they'll always be our favourite comedy duo as well as celeb couple, Joe posted a hilarious birthday tribute to wife Sophie over the weekend.\n\nCelebrating her 25th birthday Joe posted two pictures of her side by side on Instagram along with the caption, \"Happy Birthday babe. You have two moods and I love them both equally 💜 love you @sophiet.\"\n\nAs you can imagine the pictures were pretty contrasting: the first showed Sophie looked sensationally chic, in an all white and cream outfit and sunglasses, while the second showed her messing about with a hood tucked behind her ears.\n\nHappy birthday Sophie, never change.\n\n29 June, 2021: Sophie and Joe celebrate their two year anniversary by sharing a series of unseen wedding photos to their Instagrams. \"Two years as your wife holy moly I love you bub,\" Sophie captioned one of her posts, while Joe captioned his \"The best two years of my life. Love you @sophiet.\" How cute!\n\nThe unseen snaps show the couple enjoying their first dance, as well as an aerial shot of their wedding venue and a pic of their wedding cake.

He was sticking his fingers in co-stars, actresses, and even a supermodel or two.\"\n\nAs the audience cracked up over the joke the cameras panned to Nick and Kevin's wives, Priyanka Chopra and Danielle Jonas, both of whom laughed at the joke with *just a hint* of a knowing look.\n\n2 May 2022: Sophie and Joe confirm they're expecting their second child together!\n\nSophie and Joe confirmed that they're expecting their second baby together in the most stylish way: on the 2022 Met Gala red carpet, of course.\n\nPosing for pictures together, Sophie could be seen casually cradling her bump in various photos, while Joe also reached over to touch the bump and hold Sophie's hand. No words needed, right?\n\nFollowing the Met, Sophie went on to appear on the cover of ELLE UK, showing off her gorgeous baby bump in a series of beaut pics. Opening up about her pregnancy, she told the publication, \"It’s what life is about for me – raising the next generation. The greatest thing in life is seeing my daughter go from strength to strength. We’re so excited to be expanding the family. It’s the best blessing ever.\"\n\nThe couple previously welcomed daughter Willa in July 2020, and we can't wait to hear news of their second arrival. Congratulations to these two!\n\n4 May 2022: Sophie opens up about the sweet way Joe supported her during a tough time\n\nOK, we know these two are about as cute as you can get. And now, Sophie has shared more details on the sweet way Joe supported her during a tough time when she felt \"lost\". Appearing on the cover of ELLE UK, the actress recalled meeting Joe in 2016, with the couple later getting married in 2019 during the same year that Game of Thrones ended.\n\nShe told the publication, \"I’m quite glad I had that next thing to move on to. If I hadn’t found Joe, I think I would have felt quite lost after Game of Thrones. And I did feel quite lost after it finished.\"\n\nSophie went on, \"But it forced me into this new chapter, which was really exciting and something for me to focus on,\" adding that her relationship with Joe was \"the perfect thing to move on to.\" Very much here for how supportive these two are of each other.\n\n15 June 2022: Joe opens up about expecting second baby with Sophie\n\nJoe has shared a sweet update on how he's feeling about expecting his second baby with Sophie, and it's all very lovely. The singer told People in a new interview, \"You really don't know what to expect.

Joe went on to reflect on his experience of fatherhood so far, saying, \"It's been amazing to be a dad and to learn every day more about myself and what that's like.\"\n\n\"[We're] living in a new city, and it's a very exciting time,\" he added, with Joe and Sophie having just moved to Miami. \"I'm very much looking forward to the future on all things.\"\n\n14th July 2022 - Joe and Sophie welcome their second child together!\n\nJoe and Sophie have confirmed that they've welcomed their second child together - a baby girl! The couple announced the news via a statement from their reps. Speaking to PEOPLE, they said, \"Joe and Sophie are happy to announce the arrival of their baby girl.\"\n\nCongratulations to these two!\n\n18th July 2022 - Joe posts an adorable 'love story' tribute to Sophie\n\nThese two are the best when it comes to cute couple's posts (hello, hilarious TikToks), and Joe is back with an *adorable* 'love story' tribute to Sophie.\n\nThe singer took to Instagram to share a montage of his memories with Sophie - from cute dinners and cuddles in bed, to their epic wedding day and welcoming their first (and now second!) baby together.\n\nHe added the caption, \"Started from the bottom now we’re here…\" before telling fans, \"I want to see your ❤️ story.\" Joe paired the clips with a snippet of his new DNCE song 'Got Me Good', aaanndd these two have officially got us.\n\nFans were of course feeling the same, with one commenting, \"Everyone's favourite couple ❤️❤️,\" while another added, \"You guys are so freaking cute 🥺🤩💕.\" Couldn't agree more.\n\nThe post comes days after Joe and Sophie confirmed they had welcomed their second child together - another baby girl - via an announcement on 14th July. Congratulations!\n\n14th November 2022 - Joe opens up to magazine about why he and Sophie don't share too much of their relationship online or in public.

And in the end, it makes me a better person to have something for myself.\"\n\nHe also cited the recent drama around Harry Styles and Don't Worry Darling as the perfect example as to why he keeps his life away from prying eyes. \"There have been a lot of situations in my career where, like [Harry], a small thing has been blown out of proportion,\" Joe said, adding that it essentially created a \"trickle effect\" which stopped him using social media as much.\n\n12th March 2023: Joe and Sophie are the ultimate cool couple at the 2023 Oscars, attending the Vanity Fair after-party in the ultimate matching get up. Ugh, we love them.\n\nSeptember 2023: Reports allege Sophie and Joe are heading for divorce, but Joe then shares multiple pictures wearing his wedding ring\n\nA report from TMZ on 3rd September claims multiple sources have said \"Joe has had his people contact and consult with at least 2 LA-area divorce lawyers and he is on the cusp of filing divorce docs to end his marriage to Sophie.\"\n\nWhile neither Joe or Sophie have commented on the claims, Joe seemed to shut them down by sharing multiple photos on Instagram wearing his wedding ring, just days after reports broke:\n\nAlso, last month, Sophie shared photos of the pair holding hands to her Instagram grid, along with the caption, \"🎵 long long New York nights 🎵\"\n\nSeptember 2023: Joe Jonas and Sophie Turner release joint statement confirming their divorce\n\nAfter days of speculation, Joe and Sophie released a joint statement on the 6th September confirming they are sadly going their separate ways. In full, it reads:\n\n\"After four wonderful years of marriage we have mutually decided to amicably end our marriage. There are many speculative narratives as to why but, truly this is a united decision and we sincerely hope that everyone can respect our wishes for privacy for us and our children.\"\n\nBoth Sophie and Joe shared the statement with no caption, tagging each other in it.\n\nThis comes as CNN reported yesterday [5th September] that Joe has very sadly filed for divorce from Sophie, after almost seven years as a couple – four of which they've spent married. As for the reason why, the official paperwork describes the marriage as \"irretrievably broken\". It's said that Joe filed the paperwork in Florida.\n\nAs for their two young children, it appears the couple will be sharing joint custody of their daughters, with the paperwork saying \"it is in the best interests of the minor children that the parties have shared parental responsibilities.\"\n\nSeptember 2023: Joe Jonas appears to address Sophie Turner divorce\n\nFollowing Joe and Sophie's announcement that they have decided to end their marriage, Joe appeared to address his divorce from Sophie during a recent Jonas Brothers concert.\n\nWhile performing at the Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles on 9th September, alongside brothers Nick and Kevin, Joe reportedly said (via Entertainment Weekly): \"It's been a crazy week. I just wanna say, look: If you don't hear it from these lips, don't believe it. Okay?\"\n\nJoe added to the crowd: \"Thank you, everyone, for your love and support. Me and my family love you guys.\n\nHis words come a week after Sophie and Joe publicly announced their split on Instagram, telling their followers that after four years of marriage they decided to \"amicably end\" their marriage. The couple have two daughters together.\n\nWe hope they're both doing as okay as they can be during this tough time for their family."
