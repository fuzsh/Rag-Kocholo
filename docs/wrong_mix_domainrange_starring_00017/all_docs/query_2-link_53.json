        "text": "Joe Jonas wants us to know that the divorce was really hard for him, too. The singer, who announced his divorce from Sophie Turner in September, is processing his feelings the only way he knows how: through the power of song. The Jonas Brother shared a snippet of a new song to TikTok on Wednesday, in which he seems to be addressing his own feelings about the end of his marriage. Let’s all watch and then we’ll regroup.\n\nWell, to be positive, wherever he’s biking looks lovely. I even thought that guitar bit at the beginning was nice, it kind of sounded like something from Kacey Musgraves’s latest album. The lyrics are where he’s losing me, personally.\n\n“Come on, Joe, you got so much more to be grateful for,” Jonas sings as the song shifts from its folky intro to a kind of Neon Trees–inflected electro-pop tune. Okay, sure! Divorce is hard, and it’s good to take stock of your life to find what else can bring you joy. I’ll give him that. “Stop being sad because you’re making the room uncomfortable / Okay I get it / I know you’re feeling so miserable / Sometimes I wish I had powers to be invisible,” Jonas continues. This is a snooze of a line to me, but he’s just ramping up to his big moment.\n\n“Even baddies get saddies and that’s the hardest truth / Called your mommy and daddy, they don’t know what to do,” Jonas sings. To be clear, he is the baddie with the saddies in this lyric. He called his mommy and daddy for help (the perspective of the song is kind of confusing). I imagine this is him trying to be playful in light of something serious, but it really misses the mark. I would be more receptive to a full-throated power ballad about loving and losing than whatever this is. Be earnest, man!"
