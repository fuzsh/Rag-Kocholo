        "text": "It's an exciting time to be in Buffalo, especially if you love movies and film crews turning the city into a mini Hollywood.\n\nYou probably know about John Krasinki being in town two years back to film A Quiet Place: Part II and of course, Guillermo del Toro and Bradley Cooper were in downtown Buffalo to film the movie, Nightmare Alley. That movie transformed Niagara Square into the 1930s and 40s for a week or two and was quite the sight in the cold winter.\n\nBuffalo has recently been bubbling with activity with major movies filming in Western New York in 2021.\n\nThe latest will be a movie called Cabrini and according to WGRZ, will be feature 37 locations in roughly 45 days as production begins.\n\nCabrini takes place in the 1890s, so the throwback feel will be quite evident. Italian actress Christiana Dell'Anna will play Cabrini and the movie's setting will be New York City, even though it's Buffalo.\n\nTwo pretty famous film actors will star in the film as well.\n\nJohn Lithgow and David Morse will star in Cabrini.\n\nLithgow is best known for his work on the TV show 3rd Rock from the Sun and films such as Shrek and Interstellar.\n\nMorse has starred in The Green Mile, Disturbia, and World War Z to name a few.\n\nFilming in Buffalo will go through September 15th. There is no release date since it's an independent movie and has not yet been sold to a distributor.\n\nHow cool is all of this? Have you seen crews yet?\n\nCelebrity Couples Who Secretly Got Married\n\nThe Quickest Celebrity Engagements"
