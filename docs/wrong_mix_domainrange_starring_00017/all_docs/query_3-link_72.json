        "text": "Joe Jonas is gearing up to release his \"most personal music\" yet as he prepares to drop new solo music amid his divorce from ex-wife Sophie Turner.\n\nAfter confirming he has new music on the way, Jonas opened up on the Therapuss podcast on Wednesday (July 10) about how the music is \"the most personal music I've ever put out,\" per Entertainment Tonight. Speaking to host Jake Shane of his upcoming single \"Work It Out,\" which drops next week, Jonas said the track is about learning how to get yourself out of a funk without relying on others.\n\n\"The idea is sometimes you realize you have to just shake yourself out of something and you're the only person that's going to fix it for yourself,\" he said. \"No one's going to save you.\"\n\nJonas also gave a peek at what fans can expect from the new album, which he said he made in only two weeks and confirmed is coming sometime \"later this year.\"\n\n\"This music, it's all over the place,\" he said. \"There's some really beautiful ballads, there's some songs about being a dad, there's songs about love, there's songs about being better to yourself, kind of everything.\"\n\nWhile Jonas has released music on his own in the past, with 2011's Fastlife, and with another band in DNCE, he is more known for being one third of the Jonas Brothers, alongside Nick Jonas and Kevin Jonas. When he felt the draw to make something away from the group, he checked in with his brothers and got their \"blessing\" to go it alone as they were also working on separate projects.\n\n\"I asked my brothers' blessings. I was like, 'Hey, I'm gonna go work on, I don't want to call it solo, but I'm gonna go do something on my own, and I don't feel like it's DNCE. And I need to go just express some stuff for myself,'\" he said. \"And they're like, 'Go for it.' Nick booked a movie. Kevin was going to do another season of Claim to Fame [with brother Frankie Jonas]... and so I had the window of time.\"\n\n\"Work it Out\" drops July 19."
