        "text": "In most cases, movie theaters are no longer using the traditional film format I grew up with. Since around 2000, digital projectors have been the industry standard. I'm wondering out loud if that's about the same timeline that the most popular movies stopped being treated as the best movies by the Academy Awards, film critics and Golden Globe Awards.\n\nPerhaps the most well-known award in American cinema, the Oscars are handed out every year to actors, directors, producers, and film professionals who work with and for the people they're voting for.\n\nThe Phil Paleologos Show's gifted reviewer of films and other talkies, Jason Kent – heard Fridays at 9:45 a.m. – was mentioning the Oscar winners. Jason asked when and why do blockbuster multi-million or even billion-dollar earning movies hardly get a mention compared to what the beautiful people of Hollywood choose as what is best for us? It never used to be like that. We'd like to hear your thoughts on this or call in live Friday morning.\n\nSidetracking for a moment, a standing ovation to 83-year old Anthony Hopkins for winning Best Actor for his portrayal in The Father.\n\nHere's a point of reference. In 2018, Avengers: Infinity War reaped 10 times more money than the Oscar winner for best picture, The Shape of Water, which brought in $63.9 million in ticket sales compared to $678 million for the Marvel movie. Over 10 times more money, yet only one Oscar nomination, for best visual effects – and it didn't even win.\n\nSo let me ask you folks: what does Hollywood know that we don't? Are we all so blind to the filmmaking process that we just don't see greatness when it's put before us? Or is the answer more simple: do the Hollywood elites just like to pat each other on the back for a job well done, when the public is saying otherwise?\n\nI guess the entire entertainment industry must be brighter, better-read, and much better informed than you. Just ask them!"
