        "text": "JONAS Brothers frontman Joe Jonas has officially moved on from his split from Game of Thrones actress Sophie Turner.\n\nThe two - who got married in 2019 - called it quits in September 2023 via an Instagram statement.\n\nSophie, 28, and Joe, 34, share two children: Willa and Delphine.\n\nA month after their split announcement, the two got into a nasty custody battle - where Sophie sued Joe for the \"wrongful detention\" of their children.\n\nDespite their ongoing feud, Joe is ready to move forward from his former relationship.\n\nJoe has been linked with model Stormi Bree but broke up after five months together.\n\nOver the last month, the Jonas Brothers member has been spotted with actress Demi Moore, 61.\n\n\"Joe is finding his groove as a single dad and pretty much fully recovered from the roller-coaster ride of his marriage and his divorce from Sophie,\" a source told Life & Style.\n\n\"He’s in rebuilding mode and not leaning as much on his brothers as he was a year ago. He’s his own man again.\"\n\nThe insider continued, \"They also have more mutual friends than people realize.\n\n\"Joe’s laid-back and low-stress demeanor is catnip for Demi, and dating an actual rock star has always intrigued her, so there are strong odds that these two are going to spend more time together.\"\n\nThe Life & Style source discussed how the pop music singer is an \"easy guy to get to know\" and is on the hunt for a \"fulfilling long-term relationship\" and a possible stepmom to his children.\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA OFFICIAL?\n\nIn May, Demi attended the Cannes Film Festival in France for her latest film, The Substance - which received a 13-minute standing ovation from the audience.\n\nWhile in France, Joe and Demi were photographed talking to one another while on a lunch date at Hotel du Cap-Eden-Roc.\n\nThe Burnin' Up hitmaker was seen wearing a collared shirt and white pants.\n\nThe Hollywood actress wore a plunging black and white top with a gray sweater overtop.\n\nIn a recent Instagram post, Joe posted a video of Demi and Academy Award-winner Michelle Yeoh, 61, dancing at the amfAR Gala on May 23.\n\nDEMI'S PAST RELATIONSHIPS\n\nThis isn't the first time Demi has dated a younger man.\n\nDemi and Joe have a 27-year age gap.\n\nFrom 2003 to 2011, Demi dated and was married to actor Ashton Kutcher, 46 - in which they had a 15-year age gap.\n\nIn 2005, the couple officially tied the knot, then called it quits six years later in 2011.\n\nTheir divorce was finalized in 2013."
