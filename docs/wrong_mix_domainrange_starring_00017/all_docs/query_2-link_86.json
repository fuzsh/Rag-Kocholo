        "text": "If you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, Rolling Stone may receive an affiliate commission.\n\nJoe Jonas is leaning on family as he navigates his recent split from Sophie Turner. Speaking for the first time since news broke of his divorce from the Game of Thrones star, Joe tells Rolling Stone he’s been “so grateful” to be on tour with his brothers, adding that it’s given him “time to have some normalcy.”\n\n“You know, we’ve been a band, but we’re also a family,” Joe says, revealing that the guys “had a great dinner” the other night and that he and Nick have been playing golf and binge-watching the Paramount+ series, Special Ops: Lioness as a way to “decompress” as of late.\n\n“We’re also like an extended family,” Joe adds, “because we’ve had the same guys working with us on the band front to the management side for over 15 years at this point. So it feels like one big family on the road.”\n\nThe Jonas Brothers have been in the middle of a massive stadium and arena run, simply dubbed “The Tour.” The trek kicked off at Yankee Stadium in August, with dates running through December. As part of their current run, the Jonas Brothers are teaming up with car-sharing marketplace Turo to give fans a chance to book one of the guys’ previously owned cars to take to an upcoming concert date.\n\nJoe will list his Escalade for the October 14 Miami show, while Nick will list his Toyota Tundra for the October 29 Anaheim show. Kevin will list his Range Rover for the December 9 show in Brooklyn. Fans who book a car will have a chance to meet the guys in person and receive two VIP tickets to the concert in each car’s location. Guests can request to book the Jonas Brothers’ cars starting at 10 a.m. PT on October 12 at Turo.com.\n\nWhile the guys say their sold-out tour is their “most ambitious one yet,” it’s also given them the opportunity to launch unique partnerships with brands they’ve long wanted to work with. “It’s always fun for us to incorporate things that give our fans experiences when it comes to partnerships and collaborations,” Nick says. “And we were so thrilled with the opportunity to collaborate with Turo to build this experience, and give our fans the chance to come meet us in person. It’s also really unique to have our personal cars be a part of this and have people drive out to the shows and experience how much fun this has been.”\n\nEditor’s picks\n\nJoe says that he really does own an Escalade, noting that the SUV has been especially helpful as a father of two young children. “They enjoy [road trips],” Joe says of his two daughters with Turner. “It’s definitely useful with the Escalade as well, because you’ve got the TVs, and you can connect everything on there. But they love seeing the world,” he shares. “It’s one of the luxuries of doing what I do for a living because I get to show them some of my favorite places.”\n\nThe Jonas Brothers tour takes them across North America through December before heading to Australia and Europe next spring. Billed as “Five Albums, One Night,” The Tour has been compared by many to Taylor Swift’s record-breaking “Eras Tour,” though the guys are quick to give Swift her spotlight.\n\n“It’s important to differentiate the vernacular and the language around that,” Nick says. “Certainly, ‘Eras’ is a major piece of Taylor’s story, but I think our tour is our own version of telling our story and the journey we’ve been on, and I couldn’t be prouder of where we are today, as a band and as a family.”\n\nTrending\n\nThe guys say their shows — and activations like the Turo partnership — are a way to give back to their fans for years of unwavering support. “It’s so fulfilling for us to be up there every night and play shows for people that have been supporting us for as long as our fans have been supporting us,” Kevin says. “People that were a part of our journey when it came to the first concert, you see that they’re still there today.”\n\nRegardless of anything else that’s going on in their lives, the brothers say they hope their music, at least, can provide an escape for people who are dealing with their own struggles. “Every night, there are real reactions and responses of how this show affects people in a positive way,” Joe adds. “I can think of certain artists that I look up to, and I grew up listening to, and [I remember] how they were helpful in different stages of my life. And I think about how, if we’re something like that for these fans, then that’s what it’s all about.”"
