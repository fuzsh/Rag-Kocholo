You never know, you might get inspiration on what to watch next or find out you have something in common with somebody new!\n\nNow, I'm going to do five, but you can do as many or as few as you want.\n\nEdward Scissorhands. This is possibly my favourite movie of all time. In the extremely unlikely case you haven't seen it, it's about a small town full of strange, shallow people. Nearby, a doctor who could never have a son creates one, however he dies before he can finish, leaving poor Edward with scissors instead of hands. He comes to live in the town and eventually falls in love with one of it's most popular girls, who loves him back, but ultimately they can't be together because he accidentally stabs this asshole with his scissors (he totally deserved it tho). I don't know why I love this so much, to be honest, I just find it both heartwarming and heartbreaking in equal measure. Plus it's Tim Burton so it's quirky.\n\nForrest Gump. The plot of this is kind of long winded but basically, a simple but kind hearted guy who loves only one girl grows up in Alabama, fights in 'Nam, and eventually finds out he has a son. There are so many happy and sad moments in this one. I love it for that and the fact that it has humour to it throughout- it's a very well rounded film.\n\nBilly Elliot. Idk why all my favourites are names, but anyways. This is a British made film set during the 80s, in coal mining town in the north during the strikes against Thatcher's government. Among the austerity and poverty, a young boy discovers his talent of ballet dancing. Which goes down super well with his very alpha male dad, as one might expect. But eventually everyone comes to accept it when they realise how good he is and gets into the Royal Ballet School. This movie has excellent music from the 70s and 80s all throughout, it has that classic mixture of comedy, happiness and sadness. If you haven't seen this, do. I haven't seen the West End stage show, mind you, but I love the film.\n\nEternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. A man meets a woman. It turns out that woman is his ex, who took a pill and went through a process to erase him from her memory permanently. Rewind some time, and his girlfriend has vanished from his life. He finds out she had this procedure, and he decides to do the same as the heartache is too much. Cue lots of trippy camera work and weirdness as, during the process, we go inside his head, where he realises too late he doesn't want to forget her so he tries to find a way to hide her in his subconcious. He kind of manages to because he remembers the beach where he first met her - and she did the same. They meet. Full circle. Perfect, but weird.\n\nGone With The Wind. One of the very first full length colour movies. Based on the book, with some minor changes. Everything about this film is lovely to look at, the shots are stunning and the acting is good. Yes, there are some extremely racist undertones, but that's sort of to be expected when it is set in the Antebellum south during the civil war. Anyway, Clark Gable is officially bae and everything about this film is beautiful and tragic, right down to the end:\n\nScarlett: But if you leave, where do I go? What shall I do?\n\nRhett: Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn.\n\nI don't doubt that there have most likely been a few threads where we name our favourite movies etc, but why not have one where we pick our top favourite movies and explain a little bit about why we love them so much/what they're about?
