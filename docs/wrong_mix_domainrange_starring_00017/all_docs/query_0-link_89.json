        "text": "FOR OVER a decade, Winona Ryder has been in a relationship with Scott Mackinlay Hahn.\n\nPreviously, the Stranger Things star also dated Matt Damon, Johnny Depp, and Christian Slater.\n\nScott Mackinlay Hahn (2011-present)\n\nSince 2011, Winona Ryder has been dating Scott Mackinlay Hahn.\n\nThe latter is a fashion designer and sustainability advocate from Brooklyn, New York.\n\n\"Winona has found her soulmate in Scott, who’s a real gentleman and super successful but loves flying under the radar and enjoying his success in a low-key way just like her,\" a source told Us Weekly.\n\n\"They may eventually marry but it’s never been a priority, nor has starting a family.\n\n\"[Winona] loves what they have and [they] are perfectly content.\n\n\"They spend their time up north near San Francisco, though she does commute back and forth to L.A. for work and to see friends and often brings him with her.\"\n\nBlake Sennett (2007)\n\nWinona's relationship before Scott was with guitarist Blake Sennett from the band Rilo Kiley.\n\nIt seemed Winona had a soft spot for musicians during her dating career.\n\nThe couple dated for a year without much fanfare.\n\nBlake formerly dated his bandmate, Jenny Lewis.\n\nHenry Alex-Rubin (2006)\n\nIn 2006, Winona dated filmmaker Henry Alex-Rubin.\n\nThey had known each other for years, initially meeting on the set of Girl, Interrupted in 1999.\n\nPage Hamilton (2003)\n\nWinona dated musician Page Hamilton, the lead singer of the alternative metal band Helmet.\n\nHamilton alleges that many songs on Helmet’s 2004 album, Size Matters, were written about Winona.\n\nPete Yorn (2001)\n\nIn 2001, Winona was in a brief relationship with (yet another) musician, Pete Yorn.\n\nThe New Jersey artist had just found fame with his successful debut album, musicforthemorningafter.\n\nTheir relationship happened right around the same time as Winona's shoplifting scandal.\n\nBeck (2000)\n\nWinona was rumored to be dating indie musician Beck in 2000.\n\nWhen asked about Winona in an interview with Rolling Stone a few years late, Beck said: \"If you’re seen standing next to somebody, you’re together with them.\n\n\"I’ve been keeping to myself mostly. I met her when I was younger, right before my first record came out.\n\n\"I hung out with her for a month or two. But talking about any of this is weird unless you’re a complete exhibitionist.\"\n\nMatt Damon (1997-2000)\n\nWinona and Matt Damon were introduced by friends and former celebrity couple Gwyneth Paltrow and Ben Affleck.\n\nThe couple dated for three years before splitting on good terms.\n\nIn 2009, Winona told Blackbook Magazine: “Matt couldn’t be a greater, nicer guy. I’m really lucky that I’m on good terms with him.”\n\nDavid Duchovny (1996)\n\nIn 1996, Winona was linked to X-Files star David Duchovny, but it seems it was a little one-sided.\n\nDuring the time they were rumoured together, Duchovny told TV Guide: “I’m happy, and I’m in love.”\n\nMeanwhile, Winona told an interviewer that she was “completely single” when asked about Duchovny’s comments.\n\nEither they were never dating, or Winona was completely uninterested.\n\nDavid Pirner (1994–1996)\n\nWinona and David Pirner allegedly met when she attended an MTV Unplugged session where Pirner’s band, Soul Asylum, was featured.\n\nThe pair dated from 1994 to 1996.\n\nJohnny Depp (1989-1993)\n\nOne of Winona's most famous relationships (and one of the most beloved couples of the 90s) was her coupledom with Johnny Depp.\n\nThe two struck up a romance after starring together in Tim Burton’s Edward Scissorhands.\n\nIn an interview, Winona admitted their relationship was full of firsts.\n\nShe said: \"When I met Johnny, I was pure virgin. He changed that.\n\n\"He was my first everything. My first real kiss. My first real boyfriend. My first fiancé.\n\n\"The first guy I had sex with. So he’ll always be in my heart.\"\n\nChristian Slater (1988-1989)\n\nFollowing their undeniable chemistry in Heathers, Winona was reportedly dating her co-star, Christian Slater, between 1988 and 1989.\n\nBut it sadly wasn't meant to be with Winona and the teen heartthrob, as she told Vogue in 1993: “He broke my heart, or I thought he did at the time.”\n\nRob Lowe (mid-80s)\n\nWinona's first rumored relationship was with fellow American sweetheart Rob Lowe.\n\nIt's thought they had a fling in 1987 while filming Square Dance.\n\nThey attended the Golden Globes together the following year.\n\nHowever, the rumors were never confirmed as Lowe was linked to other women at the time."
