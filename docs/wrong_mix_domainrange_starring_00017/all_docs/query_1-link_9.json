        "text": "\"It was kind of this plus-one feeling,\" Turner told 'British Vogue' of the general public's perception of herself and the other Jonas Brothers' wives\n\nSophie Turner doesn't want to be seen as anyone else's accessory.\n\nIn a new cover story interview with British Vogue, the 28-year-old actress and mother of two opened up about the origins of her marriage to estranged husband Joe Jonas and feeling frustrated by the general public's perception of herself and the other Jonas Brothers' wives.\n\nThe pair went on their first date at a pub in London's Camden area in 2016. \"Joe had just DM-ed me on Instagram,\" recalled Turner to the outlet. \"I brought my brother and all my guy friends because I didn’t know if I was maybe getting catfished.\"\n\nRelated: Joe Jonas and Sophie Turner's Relationship Timeline\n\nLuckily, Jonas was not catfishing Turner. In fact, their romance blossomed quite quickly, as the 34-year-old \"Cake by the Ocean\" performer proposed about a year after they met. They tied the knot in a last-minute wedding at the famed A Little White Wedding Chapel in Las Vegas in 2019, followed by a second ceremony at Le Château de Tourreau in Sarrians, France, the same year.\n\n\"It was really surreal, like a fever dream,\" reflected the Game of Thrones actress on marrying Jonas and settling in Los Angeles. \"Because he was older than me, I just felt like I was really taken care of, to the point I came back home and didn’t know how to do anything for myself.\"\n\nTurner wasn't a big fan of living in L.A., she told British Vogue, and while the Jonas family welcomed her with open arms, she began to notice how she was seen by many people alongside her husband.\n\nRelated: Sophie Turner Addresses Claims She Was a ‘Partier,’ Not a Good Mom amid Split from Joe Jonas: ‘It Hurt’\n\n\"There was a lot of attention on the three brothers, and the wives,\" she said, referencing Nick and Kevin's respective wives, Priyanka Chopra Jonas and Danielle Jonas. \"Well, we were always called the wives, and I hated that.\"\n\n\"It was kind of this plus-one feeling,\" added Turner. \"And that’s nothing to do with him – in no way did he make me feel that – it was just that the perception of us was as the groupies in the band.\"\n\nNever miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from juicy celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\nShe and Jonas welcomed their first child, daughter Willa, in 2020, moved to Miami the following year (where she \"didn’t have any friends,\" per British Vogue) and had their second child, daughter Delphine, in 2022. By the end of 2023, he'd filed for divorce.\n\n\"After four wonderful years of marriage we have mutually decided to amicably end our marriage,\" read a statement released by the exes in September 2023. \"There are many speculative narratives as to why, but truly this is a united decision and we sincerely hope that everyone can respect our wishes for privacy for us and our children.\"\n\nFor more People news, make sure to sign up for our newsletter!"
