        "text": "Goodbye, Mr. Perfectly Fine.\n\nSophie Turner, 27, appeared to snub her now-estranged husband, Joe Jonas, 34, with a Taylor Swift reference mere days before the couple split.\n\nThe “Game of Thrones” star was spotted wearing a friendship bracelet that read “Mr. Perfectly Fine” to Jonas’ “The Tour: Five Albums One Night” concert at Yankee Stadium on Aug. 13, according to Mail Online.\n\nTurner said in her divorce filing the split happened “very suddenly” after they had a fight on Aug. 15, Jonas’ 34th birthday.\n\nSwift released the vault track “Mr. Perfectly Fine” in 2021 as part of her “Fearless” album re-recording. Jonas — who briefly dated Swift, 33, in 2008 — is speculated to be the subject of the hit.\n\nThe Post reached out to Turner, Jonas and Swift for comment.\n\nJonas filed for divorce from Turner in early September. They married in May 2019.\n\n“After four wonderful years of marriage, we have mutually decided to amicably end our marriage,” wrote the couple in a joint statement. “There are many speculative narratives as to why but, truly this is a united decision and we sincerely hope that everyone can respect our wishes for privacy for us and our children.”\n\nSince the statement, the divorce has been anything but amicable.\n\nJonas and his PR team appeared to launch a smear campaign against Turner, claiming that her affinity for partying was to blame for the marriage breakdown.\n\n“She likes to party; he likes to stay at home. They have very different lifestyles,” an unidentified source told TMZ.\n\nThe bad blood between the two parents escalated after Turner accused Jonas of withholding their children’s passports and not allowing them to return to their “forever home” in England.\n\nA lawsuit filed Thursday by Turner in Manhattan federal court accused the “Celebrate!” singer of keeping hold of their kids’ passports — despite allegedly agreeing they would raise the girls, aged 3 and 1, in the UK.\n\nAccording to the filing, the couple had put their Miami home on the market before Jonas allegedly blindsided Turner with the divorce.\n\n“The parties were both excited for the family’s move to England” in April, the court papers stated.\n\nThe document stated that Jonas would take both girls on tour while Turner was filming the TV show “Joan” in the UK.\n\n“The children would then at least be able to spend some time during the day with one of their parents until the Mother finished her filming commitments,” the filing states, adding it was a “temporary arrangement.”\n\nJonas fired back at his ex-wife, claiming that he was not holding the passports hostage.\n\n“Joe and Sophie had a cordial meeting this past Sunday in New York, when Sophie came to New York to be with the kids. They have been with her since that meeting,” Jonas’ rep told The Post last week. “Joe’s impression of the meeting was that they had reached an understanding that they would work together towards an amicable co-parenting setup.”\n\n“Less than 24 hours later, Sophie advised that she wanted to take the children permanently to the UK, continued the statement. “Thereafter, she demanded via this filing that Joe hand over the children’s passports so that she could take them out of the country immediately. If he complies, Joe will be in violation of the Florida Court order.”\n\nSince the meeting, Jonas has expressed hope that Turner will “reconsider her harsh legal position and move forward in a more constructive and private manner,” saying that his “only concern is the well-being of his children.”"
