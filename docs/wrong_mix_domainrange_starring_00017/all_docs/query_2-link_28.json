        "text": "Joe Jonas, Daren Kagasoff and Spencer Neville have joined the high-flying cast of Devotion, a Korean War drama from Black Label Media.\n\nNick Hargrove and Thomas Sadoski have also joined the call sheet for the feature. Jonathan Majors and Glen Powell star in the true story, which is due to begin shooting in February in Savannah, Georgia, with J.D. Dillard in the director’s chair.\n\nBased on the best-selling book by Adam Makos, Devotion: An Epic Story of Heroism, Friendship and Sacrifice, the project tells of two U.S. Navy fighter pilots, Jesse Brown (Majors) and Tom Hudner (Powell), from different worlds. Per the official logline, they are initiated together into the VF-32 squadron and pushed to their limits, testing and flying a new design of fighter jet. But their friendship is tested when one of them is shot down behind enemy lines.\n\nJonas and Neville are playing members of the 32 squadron. Kagasoff is a squad member who knows Hudner from their younger years while Sadoski will play the squad’s head.\n\nJake Crane and Jonathan A. Stewart wrote the script, which has been revised by Dillard. Molly Smith, Rachel Smith, Thad Luckinbill and Trent Luckinbill are producing via Black Label Media.\n\nSony is distributing domestically while STX is handling international sales.\n\nJonas was one of the three brothers that made up the Jonas Brothers, a teen sensation pop act in the 2000s. While the singer has made a few appearances beyond music videos, including in the music-themed Disney Channel movie Camp Rock, Devotion may be his first dramatic outing. He is repped by UTA and Mannatt, Phelps & Phillips.\n\nKagasoff was one of the stars of The Secret Life of an American Teenager. He appeared in horror movie Ouija and recently starred in TV’s The Village. He is repped by Gersh and manager John Carrabino.\n\nNeville is an up-and-comer who has appeared in TV shows such as Ozark and Good Trouble. He is repped by Pakula/King & Associates, 3Arts and Morris Yorn.\n\nSadoski appeared in two John Wick movies and is repped by UTA and Industry Entertainment."
