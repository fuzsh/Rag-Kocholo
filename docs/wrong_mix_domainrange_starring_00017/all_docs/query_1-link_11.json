        "text": "Johnny Depp is almost synonymous with peculiar imaginative roles while instantly evoking the idea of glamorous movie-star. Somewhere between Edward Scissorhands and Pirates of the Caribbean franchise, the actor established himself as the go-to artist for wacky costumes and delightful roles that you cannot imagine anyone but him pulling off. With a very specific filmography that blends serious Oscar-worthy (there were many nominations) roles and character transformations, he became one of the most diverse actors of Hollywood.\n\nOn his 57th Birthday (feeling old yet?), we’re looking back at some of the actor’s best roles. And that’s quite the insurmountable task considering the many masterful roles to his credit. But we have, after hours of contemplation managed to come up with a definitive list of Johnny Depp’s best roles.\n\nSidenote: This list is biased (very biased) to Johnny Deep's team-up with Tim Burton.\n\n10. Sweeney Todd - Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street\n\nSweeney Todd only got Johnny Depp an Academy Award nomination but he did win a Golden Globe for Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy category along with a couple of fan awards. Depp played the role of a deranged, bloodthirsty barber with such perfection, it was hard to look away from him. His serious vocal talents made even his horrific murderous sprees fun to watch. Trust the actor to make a demented character in a gory film appealing.\n\n9. Sleepy Hollow\n\nThe gothic aesthetic suits Depp so much, he becomes an almost natural extension of it on screen. Ichabod Crane was Johnny Depp at his peak and it doesn't take much decoding to see that the film relied quite a lot on his merits as an actor. The film also tested out the creative limits of Tim Burton and Depp's pairing and unsurprisingly found that it is pretty much a no-fail formula.\n\n8. William Blake - Dead Man\n\nRight from the opening scene, Depp plays William Blake, the accountant who finds himself in the middle of accidental (and non-accidental) murders realistically with every fibre of his artistic being. Dead Man arrived as fresh proof that Johnny Depp isn't a temporary face in the industry and neither does he need to rely on the spectacle of cinema to boost his performance. It is the scenes with almost nonexistent dialogues that confirm the actor's talent of expressing a range of emotions while remaining largely tight-lipped. Never has a common character and his complex development looked so profound on screen.\n\n7. Raoul Duke - Fear and Loathing In Las Vegas\n\nJohnny Depp took on the role of alcohol and drug charged journalist Raoul Duke in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas and the result is a hilariously dressed, doped-up character. The psychedelic exploration of the film is enhanced more often than not by a young Johnny Depp. This film happened when the actor was fresh off 21 Jump Street's TV run. Revisiting his initial performances is always eye-opening and you realise (all over again) exactly why he became the superstar he is.\n\n6. Ed Wood - Ed Wood\n\nThis film about a cult director (often regarded as the worst director of his time), Johnny Depp gives the titular character an appeal that makes you want to know his story. Set in an outwardly self-indulgent film, the role is played skillfully right down the manic delusion of the man it's based it. It is particularly wonderful watching him keep up the cheery ton of his voice while uttering even the most poignant lines. The film was a perfect medium Depp and Burton to deliver their love letter to Hollywood and for the actor to delivery a riveting performance.\n\n5. J.M. Barrie - Finding Neverland\n\nEvery time Johnny Depp stepped out of larger-than-life films and played one of his more human roles, it stirred up Oscar-speculations. Finding Neverland is one such movie and J.M. Barrie, inspired by the real-life author of Peter Pan is one such role. Finding Neverland earned the actor an Academy Award nomination and for good reason. His character portrayal was filled with deep and emotionally compelling moments and is famous for moving audiences to tears.\n\n4. Gilbert - What's Eating Gilbert Grape\n\nSure, Leonardo DiCaprio had the flashier role in this drama film but Johnny Depp's Gilbert managed to stay in the spotlight for a majority of the run-time. Gilbert has responsibilities towards his mentally-impaired brother and his obese mother but his priorities get increasingly complicated when he meets Becky. Johnny Depp manages to effectively portray the innermost conflicts of a character who can't seem to escape his dreary fate. And it's one hell of a heartfelt watch.\n\n3. Joseph D. Pistone - Donnie Brasco\n\nIn another of his roles inspired by real-life characters, Johnny Depp took on Joe Piston and owned it. He plays the undercover cop with a dicey moral compass with such finesse that he stole the show from Al Pacino. Imagine that! And that's really saying something about the prowess of an actor from his generation. Pistone is probably one of his finest performances and it would be tough to bring up a plausible argument against it. Period!\n\n2. Edward - Edward Scissorhands\n\nOne of the best movies of Johnny Depp came pretty early in his career. Edward Scissorhands was the actor’s very first collaboration with director Tim Burton and it marked the beginning of a successful actor-director pairing spanning decades. The actor played his poignant, goofy part which left little in the way of dialogues and he did it with merely his expressions. It was endearing enough to showcase his capabilities as a performer and rest is history.\n\n1. Captain Jack Sparrow - Pirates of the Caribbean series\n\nThere isn’t a character as remarkably successful as Jack Sparrow. The actor bagged this role in Pirates of the Caribbean franchise and from the very first movie, it was evident that Depp was destined to be the crazy drunk yet brilliant captain of a pirate ship. Every moment he spent in the frame is infused with pure hilarity and suddenly an entire fandom is calling the actor Jack Sparrow like it’s his name. It’s no wonder that The Curse of the Black Pearl won him a Screen Actors Guild award. The very fact that this avatar has a separate fanbase amongst so many comparably wonderful avatars speaks of its magnificence. And then there is the fact that he played it for five full movies without falling out of character even once. This is by far his best role of the actor and we won’t hear otherwise!\n\nHappy Birthday Johnny Depp and thanks for giving cinema ever-lasting proof of the merit of a movie star with elaborate costume changes.\n\nCover artwork: Bhavya Poonia/Mashable India"
