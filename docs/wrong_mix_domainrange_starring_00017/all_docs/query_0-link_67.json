        "text": "The Jonas Brothers are hitting the road for 2021, bringing Kelsea Ballerini along for a 44-concert national tour.\n\nThe tour is set to begin in late August and run through the end of October. Ballerini is the primary opener for the show, but some stops will include musical acts like Jordan McGraw and other surprise guests.\n\nAlabamians can rejoice because three stops will be within spitting distance of the Yellowhammer State. Popular concert cities Nashville and Atlanta are on the list for Sept. 16-18, but in October, the JoBros are rounding back around to make a pit stop just an hour up the road from Tuscaloosa.\n\nThe Oak Mountain Amphitheatre in Pelham, Alabama will host the trio on Oct. 18. Tickets are set to go on sale May 27.\n\nThe band announced the tour Wednesday on their social media accounts. Check it out:\n\n\"Had to make sure we could see you guys as soon as we could!\" the Facebook post read. \"Here's to creating a whole bunch of new memories that we'll never forget ... Can't wait to see you guys again on the #RememberThisTour!!\"\n\nAll the concerts will take place outdoors, though specific social distancing requirements will likely be up to each venue for consideration.\n\nStay connected here for more information on how to get tickets, and watch Ticketmaster for the official launch next week.\n\nREAD MORE: 25 Companies You Might Not Know Are Owned by Disney\n\nLOOK: The most famous actress born the same year as you\n\nMany of the actresses in this story not only made a name for themselves through their collection of iconic performances, but also through the selfless, philanthropic nature with which many of them approached their stardom.
