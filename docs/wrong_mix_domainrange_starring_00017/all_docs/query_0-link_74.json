        "text": "There's word of another feature film shoot that is planned to get underway soon in the Binghamton area.\n\nThis week, it was confirmed that a movie directed by Matthew Modine is expected to use the former Davis College property in Johnson City for some scenes.\n\nNow, Kelly Fancher, who heads the Binghamton Film Office, says production for a film called \"Susie Searches\" is expected to get underway next month at SUNY Broome Community College.\n\nFancher said the movie will be directed by Sophie Kargman. It's described as a darkly comic thriller that takes place - appropriately enough - at a community college.\n\nSpeaking on WNBF Radio's Binghamton Now program, Fancher said shooting is scheduled to start September 20.\n\nAlthough most of the scenes are to be shot on the town of Dickinson campus, Fancher said scouting continues for other locations in the Binghamton area.\n\nSUNY Broome president Kevin Drumm said the \"Susie Searches\" production \"fits in with our communications program.\"\n\nDrumm was asked whether he'll make a cameo appearance in the film. \"Absolutely not!\" he said with a laugh.\n\nContact WNBF News reporter Bob Joseph: bob@wnbf.com or (607) 772-8400 extension 233.\n\nFor breaking news and updates on developing stories, follow @BinghamtonNowon Twitter.\n\nLOOK: The most famous actress born the same year as you\n\nMany of the actresses in this story not only made a name for themselves through their collection of iconic performances, but also through the selfless, philanthropic nature with which many of them approached their stardom. In an age of flipping the script on societal norms, many of these actresses are using their voices and platforms to be advocates for those who are otherwise unheard."
