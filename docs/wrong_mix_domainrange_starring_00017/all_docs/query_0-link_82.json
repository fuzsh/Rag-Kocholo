        "text": "This movie was good, but doesn't hold a candle to the book. So many huge changes were made... what of the son? Stuff like that. For the first time in my life (and the last time before he died) my father sent me a christmas gift the year this book was released in hardcover. He sent me this book. I got it in the mail, crawled in the bathtub at about 3pm and didn't get out till I'd finished the book. It was quite good (though not as good as my favorites The Stand, and 'Salem's Lot ), but worth the night in the tub. The movie wasn't as good and the only thing that really saved it was the superb acting by Kathy Bates, who is my hero! Dolores Claiborne Rated R"
