        "text": "Joe Jonas is one-third of the Grammy-nominated, multiplatinum-selling pop group the Jonas Brothersâand arguably the most prominent third, as the frontman and face of the franchise. Born in Casa Grande, AZ, in 1989, Jonas grew up steeped in music: In addition to singing in a church choir, he learned to play keyboard, tambourine, and guitar. Though it was his younger brother Nick who originally signed a recording deal, the label quickly scooped up Joe and their brother Kevin as well, recognizing the trioâs pop potential. As lead singer, Joe starred in the Disney Channelâs Camp Rock movies, which featured him singing urgent pop-rock with a country patina, as well as in two TV shows, Jonas Brothers: Living the Dream and Jonas. A solo career beckoned, and in 2011 he released his first album, Fastlife, featuring the catchy, knotty pop singles âJust In Loveâ and âSee No More.â As Nick was champing at the bit as well, the family band broke up two years later. But it didnât take long for Joe to find his feet. In 2015, he rebounded with the group DNCE and quickly scored a hit with the Maroon 5-esque chant-along âCake by the Oceanâ; they released their first full-length album the next year. But just as Jonas Brothers fans had given up on a reunion, the brothers dropped a new album, Happiness Begins, in 2019. A few years apart had given them maturity and purposeâand undeniable songwriting chops that resulted in the beguiling, falsetto-heavy hit âSuckerâ and promised more to come."
