        "text": "During Billy Joel’s concert at Hyde Park in London on Friday, Joe Jonas had a memorable experience when he performed alongside the music icon.\n\nIn an Instagram Reel documenting the moment, he described it as a “major bucket list” moment.\n\nThe clip starts with him finishing a soundcheck and showing his excitement for the upcoming performance.\n\n“I'm doing something, really exciting today. Bucket list — major bucket list,” he said. “Quite nervous. But the person I sang with is incredible and made me feel very comfortable.”\n\nIn the next clip, Jonas is seen heading to the Hyde Park stage to duet with Joel. “The sun is officially down or about to be down. I’m just walking to stage. My friend is on his last song, can you hear it? And I’m about to go and join him up there,” Jonas revealed, before nervously adding, “Wish me luck!”\n\nNext, the Sucker singer was seen beaming as he hugged Joel, 74. The duo went on to entertain the lively audience with an energetic rendition of Billy Joel's famous track Uptown Girl.\n\nEven hours later, he was still elated from the unforgettable moment."
