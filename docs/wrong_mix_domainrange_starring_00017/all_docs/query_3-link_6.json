        "text": "His love life was always “Burnin’ Up.”\n\nJoe Jonas filed for divorce from Sophie Turner after just four years of marriage in September 2023.\n\nThe estranged couple tied the knot in 2019 and welcomed two daughters during their time together.\n\nThings took a messy turn when the “Game of Thrones” actress sued Jonas to return their children to England, where she resides.\n\nPrior to tying the knot with Turner, the Jonas Brothers singer had a star-studded dating roster.\n\nHere’s a look back at the “Sucker” singer’s relationships, from Taylor Swift and Gigi Hadid to Demi Lovato and Ashley Greene.\n\nMandy Van Duyne\n\nBefore making it big time, Jonas was romantically linked to his childhood friend Mandy Van Duyne when they were in high school.\n\nIn 2006, the Jonas Brothers released their debut single, “Mandy,” which was from their first studio album, “It’s About Time.”\n\nThe band confirmed that the song was about Van Duyne, previously telling AOL, “Mandy is our childhood friend that has always been a part of our lives. She dated Joe at one point. Although they are no longer together, they will be best friends forever.”\n\nAJ Michalka\n\nThe singer found love again when the Jonas Brothers went on tour with Alyson and AJ Michalka, who made up the Disney pop duo Aly & AJ, in 2006.\n\nJonas dated AJ while they were on the road together but they broke up after dating for just a year.\n\nAJ later revealed that Jonas was her first kiss, telling MTV in 2016, “I’m pretty sure I was his too.”\n\n“[The Jonas Brothers] opened for us when we were all like, 15, and so we started dating and we were together for a year.”\n\nAly & AJ’s hit single “Potential Breakup Song” was long rumored to be inspired by her split from Jonas. However, they later clarified in 2020 that it was actually their song “Flattery” that was inspired by the Jonas Brother.\n\nTaylor Swift\n\nJonas secretly started dating Swift in 2008.\n\nWhile the two musicians kept their romance under wraps, the “Love Story” singer revealed in an interview on “The Ellen DeGeneres Show” that Jonas dumped her in a 25-second phone call.\n\n“That guy’s not in my life anymore, unfortunately,” she said at the time. “That’s an ouch.”\n\nSwift shared that they hadn’t talked since splitting and she retaliated by writing a song about their breakup called “Forever and Always.”\n\nJonas responded with his own song, referencing Swift’s hit “Teardrops on My Guitar” in the Jonas Brothers’ track “Much Better,” singing, “Now I’m done with superstars / And all the tears on her guitar.”\n\nWhile their split was quite prickly, the two singers eventually buried the hatchet.\n\nJonas was in the audience as Swift hosted “Saturday Night Live” in 2021 and he even changed the lyrics in “Much Better” to, “Now I’m cool with superstars,” during the band’s Las Vegas residency.\n\nMeanwhile, Swift hinted that she gifted Jonas and Turner a gift for their baby in her song “Invisible String” from her 2020 “Folklore” album.\n\nBut things may have turned sour again after Jonas’ separation from Turner, considering Swift and the actress were spotted hanging out in New York City together after he filed for divorce.\n\nThe “I Knew You Were Trouble” singer moved on with several famous men and dated Joe Alwyn for six years until breaking up in March 2023. She then had a brief fling with The 1975 singer Matty Healy before rumors swirled that she was hanging out with NFL star Travis Kelce.\n\nCamilla Belle\n\nJonas sparked dating rumors with actress Camilla Belle after they stepped out together on countless occasions in 2008.\n\nThey initially met when Belle was featured in the Jonas Brothers’ music video for their song “Lovebug.”\n\nWhile they never publicly discussed their relationship, Belle’s rep confirmed in July 2009 that their romance had cooled off.\n\n“Yes, it’s true, they have broken up,” her rep told People at the time, adding, “There is no third party involved and they care deeply about each other and will remain friends.”\n\nDemi Lovato\n\nJonas fell for his “Camp Rock” co-star Demi Lovato.\n\nThe duo started off as friends while starring as each other’s love interests in the 2008 Disney movie. However, things apparently shifted from friendship to romance and they confirmed they were an item in March 2010 after the premiere of “Camp Rock 2.”\n\nUnfortunately, things didn’t last long after taking their love public and they broke up that May.\n\nThe exes appeared to keep things cordial though, performing together on stage and exchanging pleasantries at star-studded parties over the years.\n\nThe “Heart Attack” singer even congratulated Jonas on his engagement to Turner in 2017, commenting on an Instagram post at the time, “HUGE CONGRATS!!!!! Sooooo happy for the both of you!!!!”\n\nLovato was romantically linked to model Austin Wilson and engaged to Max Ehrich until moving on with musician boyfriend Jute$.\n\nAshley Greene\n\nJonas swiftly moved on with Greene in 2010.\n\nHe and the “Twilight” actress dated for a year before ending things in March 2011.\n\n“It was mutual and amicable,” a source told Page Six at the time, adding they drifted apart because of their work schedules.\n\nJonas later revealed that he lost his virginity to Greene during a 2016 chat on Reddit.\n\n“I didn’t have any condoms, so I went to our drummer Jack’s room — who was my roommate at the time — and I demolished his room looking for them,” Jonas recalled. “[I] found them underneath his underwear drawer. When he came home, he thought somebody broke into his room because his whole room was demolished.”\n\nHe added, “I was in dire need. Needed to happen then and now. Safety first, kids.”\n\nGreene responded with a cryptic message at the time, posting on her Instagram, “Class is Timeless.”\n\nShe married Paul Khoury in 2017 and they welcomed daughter Kingsley in 2022.\n\nBlanda Eggenschwiler\n\nJonas started dating Swiss model Blanda Eggenschwiler in 2012.\n\nThe pair made several public appearances during their relationship and even sat front row together during New York Fashion Week.\n\nBut after nearly two years together, a rep confirmed that they broke up in August 2014.\n\nShe has since moved on with fashion designer Simon James and they welcomed a child together in 2022.\n\nGigi Hadid\n\nJonas and Hadid first sparked dating speculation in the summer of 2015 after being friends for years.\n\nThey were spotted out together on numerous occasions, including Paris Fashion Week and the US Open in New York.\n\nThey made their red carpet debut at the Global Lyme Alliance inaugural gala in 2015 and Hadid even co-directed the “Cake By the Ocean” music video for Jonas’ band DNCE.\n\nBut after five months of dating, the model and rocker broke up in November 2015.\n\nA source at the time told People, “Nothing serious happened … it wasn’t a dramatic breakup. It was just hard to make it work with their schedules.”\n\nThe insider added, “They will definitely remain friends.”\n\nHadid welcomed daughter Khai with ex-boyfriend Zayn Malik in September 2020 before sparking dating rumors with Leonardo DiCaprio.\n\nSophie Turner\n\nJonas and Turner started dating in 2016 after he slid into her Instagram DMs.\n\nThey confirmed their relationship on the social media app that brought them together in January 2017 and even adopted a dog together that September. Their pup was later killed after being hit by a car in New York City.\n\nHowever, things continued to move forward for the couple and Jonas popped the question in October 2017.\n\nA year after getting engaged, they made their red carpet debut at the Louis Vuitton fashion show at the Louvre in Paris.\n\nIn May 2019, they got married in a surprise Las Vegas ceremony and the next month they said “I do” in front of friends and family with a wedding in France.\n\nThe pair welcomed their first child, daughter Willa, in July 2020. They welcomed their second daughter two years later.\n\n“Joe and Sophie are happy to announce the arrival of their baby girl,” their reps revealed in July 2022, without revealing the infant’s name.\n\nRumblings that there was trouble in paradise for the couple began in September 2023 after sources claimed they were heading for divorce.\n\nOn Sept. 5, Jonas officially filed to divorce the HBO star as several rumors swirled about how Turner’s partying played a role in their demise.\n\nThe “Do Revenge” star responded by suing Jonas, who has had their daughters in the US, to return their children to her in England.\n\nThe musician fired back, with his rep telling Page Six in a statement, “This is an unfortunate legal disagreement about a marriage that is sadly ending. When language like ‘abduction’ is used, it is misleading at best, and a serious abuse of the legal system at worst.”\n\nStormi Bree\n\nJonas moved on from his marriage with model Stormi Bree.\n\nIn January 2024, the pair were photographed on a Cabo San Lucas trip. They followed this up with an Aspen, Colo., getaway.\n\nPage Six confirmed in May 2024 that Jonas and Bree had called it quits after five months together.\n\nLaila Abdallah\n\nIn June 2024, Jonas made headlines for cozying up to a mystery woman on a beach in Greece.\n\nThe brunette was identified as Lebanese actress Laila Abdallah.\n\nThe pair were spotted hugging on the shore and getting touchy-feely in the water, with Jonas in green swim trunks and the actress in a blue one-piece bathing suit."
