        "text": "The Princess Bride is being remade this summer with Sophie Turner and husband Joe Jonas starring as Westley and Princess Buttercup, respectively. Yes, I said respectively.\n\nA number of other Hollywood A-listers have teamed up for this version of Princess Bride, which was filmed by at their own homes amid quarantine, using their phones. According to Variety, the remake will be released in chapters every day for two weeks on Quibi, beginning June 29.\n\nOther cast members include Hugh Jackman, Jennifer Garner, Diego Luna, Elijah Wood, Jon Hamm, Common, Chris Pine, Tiffany Haddish, Beanie Feldstein, Neil Patrick Harris, David Burtka, Jack Black, Diego Luna, Taika Waititi, and Zazie Beetz.\n\n\"The actors will trade off roles throughout scenes, each paying homage to The Princess Bride in their own unique way,\" Variety reports.\n\nJonas and Turner, who are expecting their first child later this year, star in their scene as Princess Buttercup and Westley, with Jonas wearing a blond wig as Turner dons a perfect replica of Westley's black mask. The roles were first made famous by actors Robin Wright and Cary Elwes in the original 1987 movie, which follows a hero's quest to rescue his true love from the vile Prince Humperdinck (Chris Sarandon).\n\nVanity Fair shared an exclusive first look of the remake on June 26. The best part? Their adorable corgi plays R.O.U.S (rodent of unusual size).\n\nIn another scene, the film's original director, Rob Reiner, will play the grandfather, replacing Peter Falk, who passed away in 2009, and Josh Gad will play Fred Savage's original character, the grandson. In this scene, Common takes on the role of Westley, with Tiffany Haddish playing the princess.\n\nCheck it out some highlights for yourself, below."
