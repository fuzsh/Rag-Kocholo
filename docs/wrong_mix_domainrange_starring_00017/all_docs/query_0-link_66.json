        "text": "Coming to a stage near you! Theatre productions and West End musicals touring the UK and Ireland this year\n\nPublished on 21 August 2023\n\nThere’s no shortage of incredible productions making their way up and down the UK and Ireland this year, delighting audiences from town to town. We take a look at some of the must-see productions featuring Spotlight members that are coming to a theatre near you.\n\n‘2:22 A Ghost Story’\n\nAfter a sell-out run on the West End, with an ever-changing cast of diverse talent, 2:22 A Ghost Story is hitting the road, spooking audiences all over the country. The touring cast features the talents of Spotlight members Joe Absolom (A Confession), Charlene Boyd (Mayflies), Nathaniel Curtis (It’s a Sin) and Louisa Lytton (EastEnders).\n\nKicking off at Theatre Royal Bath in September 2023, and travelling the length and breadth of the country, this show will be stopping at over 30 venues (with more to be announced)!\n\n2:22 A Ghost Story tour dates\n\n‘Charlie and the Chocolate Factory’\n\nMusical theatre fans around the world will remember when this exciting adaptation of the 1964 Roald Dahl novel of the same name first made its way to the stage. Charlie and the Chocolate Factory premiered at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane in June 2013 and ran for nearly four years, amazing audiences young and old.\n\nThis magical musical is now on a nationwide tour with musical theatre heavyweight and Spotlight member Gareth Snook taking on the iconic role of ‘Willy Wonka’, alongside an exceptionally talented cast. The tour kicks off in August and will continue through to 2024 with stops in Manchester, Hull, Dublin, Glasgow and more.\n\nCharlie and the Chocolate Factory tour dates\n\n‘Matthew Bourne’s Romeo + Juliet’\n\nKicking off its UK tour at the Hull New Theatre and making a pit-stop at London’s Sadler’s Wells in August is Matthew Bourne’s Romeo + Juliet. After making its debut back in 2019, Matthew Bourne continues to surprise us with his contemporary style and breathtaking productions.\n\nMatthew Bourne’s productions have been amazing audiences for over 30 years, and Romeo + Juliet is one not to be missed. Spotlight member Cordelia Braithwaite and Monique Jonas will be playing ‘Juliet’, while ‘Romeo’ will be played by Paris Fitzpatrick and Spotlight member Andrew Monaghan.\n\nRomeo + Juliet tour dates\n\nOther ballets of Matthew Bourne include Swan Lake, The Nutcracker and Edward Scissorhands, which also embarks on a nationwide tour in November this year and stars Dominic North and Spotlight member Liam Mower in the titular role.\n\nEdward Scissorhands tour dates\n\n‘Life of Pi’\n\nAfter its groundbreaking run at London’s West End Wyndham Theatre, and receiving five Olivier Awards, including ‘Best New Play’, Life of Pi is currently embarking on an epic 2023 and 2024 UK and Ireland tour to sell-out audiences.\n\nThe story, based on the Yann Martel novel of the same name, follows a young boy as he finds himself on a spiritual journey with only a tiger for company. The novel was adapted to screen in 2012 by Oscar-winning director Ang Lee, which paved the way for this breathtaking stage production, starring Spotlight member Divesh Subaskaran as ‘Pi’.\n\nLife of Pi tour dates\n\n‘Buddy – The Buddy Holly Story’\n\nThe West End and Broadway smash hit biographical musical is currently on its UK tour, stopping at theatres all over the country, from Nottingham’s Theatre Royal to Cardiff’s New Theatre.\n\nStarring Spotlight members Christopher Weeks and AJ Jenks as Buddy Holly, Buddy – The Buddy Holly Story features songs from the musician’s career, while telling the life story of the musical superstar, and diving deep into his personal life and rise to fame.\n\nBuddy – The Buddy Holly Story tour dates\n\n‘Pretty Woman: The Musical’\n\nAfter a sell-out run and recently dropping the curtain for the last time at the Savoy Theatre on the West End, Pretty Woman: The Musical is embarking on a UK tour this autumn. Original songs written by music legend Bryan Adams accompany the tale of Vivian and Edward, as two worlds collide in this beloved fairytale.\n\nSpotlight member Amber Davies is moving on from her role as Jennifer in Back to the Future to lead the cast as Vivian, with fellow Spotlight member Oliver Savile in the role of Edward. Tickets are already selling fast for the tour that sets off at The Alexandra in Birmingham, stopping at Glasgow, York, Milton Keynes and more along the way.\n\nPretty Woman: The Musical tour dates\n\n‘And Then There Were None’\n\nAdapted from one of the best-selling crime novels of all time, by acclaimed author Agatha Christie, comes the UK tour of And Then There Were None. Christie’s stage adaptations have been a sure-fire hit for theatre audiences for many years.\n\nCurrently residing in St Martins Lane on the West End is The Mousetrap, and at London’s County Hall, in a genuine courthouse, is Witness for the Prosecution. Both of these productions pave the way for the touring production of And Then There Were None, which will be passing through Truro, Guildford, Cambridge and many more until April 2024.\n\nAnd Then There Were None stars Joseph Beattie and Spotlight members Bob Barrett, Oliver Clayton, Jeffery Kissoon, Andrew Lancel, Louise McNulty, Nicola May-Taylor, Katy Stephens, Lucy Tregear, Sophie Walter, Matt Weyland and David Yelland.\n\nAnd Then There Were None tour dates\n\n‘Fantastically Great Women Who Changed The World’\n\nFinally, we celebrate a group of fantastically great women who changed the world in the new musical… Fantastically Great Women Who Changed The World! The show is based on the book of the same name by Kate Pankhurst, which showcases the lives and careers of figureheads such as Frida Kahlo, Marie Curie and Rosa Parks.\n\nAfter its sell-out run at London’s Theatre Royal Stratford East, Fantastically Great Women will be kicking off its UK tour at the New Wembley Theatre, before hitting the road until February 2024.\n\nFantastically Great Women Who Changed The World tour dates\n\nFrom powerful plays to exciting musicals, all these fantastically diverse productions will be housed in UK theatres between now and next summer, providing audiences with endless entertainment – no matter where they’re based.\n\nJoin Spotlight to see castings for stage shows, musical theatre and more.
