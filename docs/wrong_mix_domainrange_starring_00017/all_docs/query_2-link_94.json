        "text": "Sophie Turner says she's still \"in shock\" over the mom-shaming she experienced amid her split from husband Joe Jonas.\n\nThe former \"Game of Thrones\" star, who was filming the British crime series \"Joan\" at the time, told British Vogue that headlines depicting her allegedly wanting to party rather than stay at home with her young daughters marked \"the worst few days of my life.”\n\n“I remember I was on set, I was contracted to be on set for another two weeks, so I couldn’t leave. My kids were in the States and I couldn’t get to them because I had to finish 'Joan.' And all these articles started coming out…” she recalled.\n\n“It hurt because I really do completely torture myself over every move I make as a mother — mum guilt is so real! I just kept having to say to myself, ‘None of this is true. You are a good mum and you’ve never been a partier.’”\n\nTurner and Jonas briefly engaged in a legal battle over their daughters, Willa and Delphine, with Turner at one point suing her ex for the girls' return to England. The lawsuit was later dropped as the two worked out a custody agreement.\n\n“There were some days that I didn’t know if I was going to make it. I would call my lawyer saying, ‘I can’t do this. I just can’t.’ I was just never strong enough to stand up for myself,\" Turner told the publication.\n\nElsewhere during the interview, Turner revealed that she was dating again.\n\n\"It’s very fun,” she said. “I mean, it’s strange when you get married so young. It’s like you never really learn how to date. So it’s all very new to me.”\n\nJonas filed for divorce from Turner on Sept. 5, four years after they married in a surprise wedding in Las Vegas, and seven years since they began dating in 2016.\n\nWhile the pair announced they had reached a temporary custody agreement for their two children on Oct. 10, attorneys for Turner filed a notice on March 14 stating abatement had ended and that the divorce case should be reactivated, according to court documents filed in Florida circuit court and obtained by NBC News.\n\nTODAY.com reached out to both Jonas, 34, and Turner, 28, at the time for comment.\n\nRead on to see a timeline of the pair’s marriage and breakup, as well as statements given in the aftermath of the divorce.\n\nJonas and Turner started dating in 2016\n\nJonas and Turner started dating soon after meeting in 2016.\n\nTurner told \"Tonight Show\" host Jimmy Fallon in 2022 that she knew she wanted to marry the musician “the first night” they met.\n\n“We went out, and we hung out at a bar with all my friends and all his friends. They all came back to my apartment, and we had drinks after,” she said.\n\nWhen everyone left, Turner suddenly became emotional.\n\n“I remember him leaving and I just wept to my brother. I was like, ‘I love this man so much!’” she shared.\n\nThe couple tied the knot in 2019\n\nThe former couple got engaged in October 2017.\n\nThey tied the knot in several ceremonies in 2019, first eloping in Las Vegas on May 1, right after the Billboard Awards.\n\nThe following month, they walked down the aisle at Château de Tourreau in the south of France.\n\nThe couple welcomed two children\n\nJonas and Turner are parents to two daughters.\n\nThey welcomed their first daughter, Willa, in July 2020.\n\nIn July 2022, a rep for the couple confirmed to TODAY.com that they recently welcomed their second daughter, Delphine.\n\nJonas filed for divorce on Sept. 5 of this year\n\nTODAY.com exclusively obtained a petition that confirmed that Jonas filed for divorce on Sept. 5, 2023 in Miami Dade County, Florida.\n\nIn the petition, Jonas stated that “the marriage between the parties is irretrievably broken.”\n\nIt also stated that the former couple's two minor children had been living with Jonas in Miami and other locations throughout the country, but that “it is in the best interests of the minor children that the parties have shared parental responsibility.”\n\nThe pair had a prenuptial agreement.\n\nJonas and Tuner issued a joint statement on Sept. 6 about their split\n\nOn Sept. 6, Jonas and Turner issued a joint statement about their split on their individual Instagram accounts.\n\n“After four years of wonderful marriage we have mutually decided to amicably end our marriage,” the statement read. “There are many speculative narratives as to why but, truly this is a united decision and we sincerely hope that everyone can respect our wishes for privacy for us and our children.”\n\nJonas appears to address the split during a concert on Sept. 9\n\nOn Sept. 9, four days after filing for divorce from Turner, Jonas appeared to address the former couple's split during a Jonas Brothers concert at Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles.\n\n“It’s been a tough week,” he said. “I just want to say, look, if you don’t hear it from these lips, don’t believe it, OK?”\n\n“Thank you everyone for the love and support to me and my family. I love you guys,” he added.\n\nJonas then performed the song \"Hesitate,\" from the band's 2019 album, “Happiness Begins,” which he has previously said was inspired by Turner.\n\nTurner sues Jonas for the return of the couple's kids to England\n\nTurner filed a petition on Sept. 21 in the Southern District of New York and obtained by NBC News, that alleged that Jonas was engaging in a “wrongful retention” of the couple’s two daughters in New York City.\n\nAccording to the petition, which was filed through the child abduction clauses of the Hague Convention, Turner and Jonas had previously agreed that the couple's children would return to “their habitual residence in England,\" where they would attend school.\n\nThe petition stated that prior to Jonas filing for divorce, he and Turner had decided in April to make their permanent home in England.\n\nIn May, the former couple rented a home and had plans to purchase a home in July with plans to move into the home in December, the filing said.\n\nAccording to the filing, Turner and Jonas decided that when Turner began to film a new drama series in the U.K. in May, the couple's daughters would join their father and a nanny when he went on tour in the with the Jonas Brothers in the U.S..\n\nTurner's filing said the couple planned for their daughters to stay with Jonas and other family members until Turner was done filming her series in mid-September, at which time she would travel to the U.S. to pick up her daughters and return with them to England.\n\nThe petition stated that after making the plans, the couple engaged in a marital argument on Aug. 15 and Jonas filed for divorce in early September.\n\nThe petition stated that Turner learned that her husband filed for divorce when the story made headlines.\n\nAccording to the petition, when the former couple met on Sept. 17 to discuss their separation, Turner told Jonas she still wanted their daughters to return with her to England, but Jonas refused to provide their passports.\n\nThe petition called for the “immediate return” of the couple’s daughters to Turner’s home.\n\nJonas responds to Turner's petition for the children's return to England\n\nA rep for Jonas responded to Turner’s petition in a statement to NBC News, explaining that the Florida Court where Jonas filed for \"restricts both parents from relocating the children.\"\n\nThe statement said the former couple had a recent “cordial” meeting in New York to discuss their divorce and their children, and that Jonas is seeking “shared parenting” across the U.K. and U.S.\n\n“Joe’s impression of the meeting was that they had reached an understanding that they would work together towards an amicable co-parenting setup,” the statement said.\n\n“Less than 24 hours later, Sophie advised that she wanted to take the children permanently to the UK,” the statement continued.\n\nAccording to the statement, if Jonas were to “hand over the children’s passports so that (Turner) could take them out of the country immediately,” he would will be “in violation of the Florida Court order.”\n\nTODAY.com has not reviewed the Florida court order in question.\n\nThe statement objected to Turner’s petition using words like “abduction” calling it “misleading at best, and a serious abuse of the legal system at worst.”\n\nThe statement also disputed a claim made in Turner's petition that said she was unaware that Jonas was going to file for divorce on Sept 5, explaining that Jonas had “multiple conversations” with Turner about the state of the couple's marriage.\n\nJonas and Turner agree to temporarily keep their kids in New York\n\nThe couple agreed to temporarily keep their two daughters in the U.S., according to an interim consent order filed in a New York City court on Sept. 25.\n\nAccording to the order, Turner and Jonas “are prohibited from removing their two children … or causing the children to be removed from the jurisdictions of the United States District Courts for the Southern & Eastern Districts of New York pending further order of this Court.”\n\nTODAY.com did not receive a response from Turner and Jonas about the order.\n\nTurner submits a letter Jonas wrote about seeking 'a permanent home' for their children\n\nOn Sept. 26, Turner filed legal documents including a letter that she said was written by Jonas about looking for \"a permanent home\" for their two children in England before their divorce.\n\nJonas wrote to the seller of a home on June 16, 2023, that communicated his intention to have their children raised in England, according to a court filing obtained by NBC News.\n\nThe pair went into contract on July 7 to purchase the seller's home in Oxford, England, for $7.8 million, according to the filing, though the sale was not complete at the time and a closing date was scheduled for Dec. 2.\n\n“When my wife and I decided we were going to spend more time in the UK and search for a permanent home, our daughter expressed three unwavering requirements: having chickens, a pony and a Wendy house,” the letter stated, according to the filing. “Many of the houses we viewed met this criteria, the moment we turned the corner and caught sight of the charming blue shutters adorning, we experienced a sense of magic unlike anything we had felt before.”\n\nTurner's attorneys wrote in the court filing that the couple planned to find a “forever home” in England in 2022. She submitted his 2023 letter to the seller as proof of his “clearly communicated intentions at the time.”\n\n“We could tell that your family have truly loved living here and we can envision our children growing up here and making this our forever home,” the letter stated. “I really think Sophie and I will be able to look after and for many many years pay homage to the magic you have created here.”\n\nJonas did not comment on the letter in the filing.\n\nJonas and Turner reach a temporary custody agreement for their daughters\n\nOn Oct. 10, Jonas and Turner released a statement announcing they had agreed to a temporary custody agreement that would allow their daughters to travel to the U.K. with Turner.\n\n“After a productive and successful mediation, we have agreed that the children will spend time equally in loving homes in both the U.S. and the UK. We look forward to being great co-parents,” Jonas and Turner said in a statement to NBC News.\n\nJonas and Turner agreed to a consent order filed in a New York City court that outlined which parent would have custody of their two daughters over the next three months.\n\nThe pair alternated custody of the children every few weeks between October and January, according to court documents.\n\nThe couple was also undergoing mediation toward their divorce settlement at the time, according to the filing.\n\nTurner reactivates divorce proceedings\n\nOn March 14, Turner filed a notice in Florida circuit court asking a judge to reactivate their divorce proceedings after their abatement had \"come to an end.\"\n\nTurner and Jonas did not immediately respond to a request for comment from TODAY.com.\n\nTurner says she's still 'in shock' over the mom-shaming she experienced after the split\n\nTurner opened up about the pain she endured after her split with Jonas — including the \"shock\" she experienced when she was mom-shamed in the media — during a candid interview in British Vogue published on May 15, 2024.\n\nThe mom of two said headlines that alleged she was out \"partying\" and not home with her young daughters, Willa and Delphine, marked “the worst few days of my life.”\n\n“It hurt because I really do completely torture myself over every move I make as a mother — mum guilt is so real! I just kept having to say to myself, ‘None of this is true. You are a good mum and you’ve never been a partier,'\" she recalled.\n\nTurner also said in the interview she's dating again.\n\n“It’s very fun,” she said. “I mean, it’s strange when you get married so young. It’s like you never really learn how to date. So it’s all very new to me.”"
