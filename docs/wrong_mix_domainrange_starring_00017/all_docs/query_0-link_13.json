        "text": "OPENING\n\nTHE KILLING OF JOHN LENNON\n\nA docudrama about John Mark Chapman’s murder plot, starring Jonas Ball, directed by Andrew Piddington. Opening Jan. 2. (IFC Center.)\n\nONE MISSED CALL\n\nA thriller about people who receive phone calls from themselves announcing the time of their death. Starring Edward Burns and Shannyn Sossamon; directed by Eric Valette. Opening Jan. 4. (In wide release.)\n\nNOW PLAYING\n\nATONEMENT\n\nA very British affair, not just in its personnel—the director Joe Wright and the screenwriter Christopher Hampton serve up a loyal adaptation of Ian McEwan’s novel—but in its obsession with the upheavals of the Second World War and with the minor, eternal skirmishes over social class. In 1935, a bright girl named Briony Tallis (Saoirse Ronan) intervenes in—and thus, unwittingly, all but destroys—a passionate rapport between her sister Cecilia (Keira Knightley) and Robbie (James McAvoy), the housekeeper’s son. The movie’s middle section finds Robbie serving in France during the chaotic retreat from Dunkirk, in 1940, while his beloved waits in London and Briony (now played by Romola Garai) ponders her childhood crime. Wright handles the loops and leaps of time with deftness and clarity, and the film, brimming with sensual detail, certainly honors McEwan’s depiction of one hot, cruel day that unfolded into a lifetime of guilt and expiation; but clever books have a troubling habit of coming across, onscreen, as too clever by half, and, somewhere in the labyrinth of its construction, this love story loses its heart. With a wonderful turn, late in the day, by Vanessa Redgrave, as the final incarnation of Briony.—Anthony Lane (Reviewed in our issue of 12/10/07.) (In wide release.)\n\nTHE BUCKET LIST\n\nReviewed this week in The Current Cinema. (In wide release.)\n\nCHARLIE WILSON’S WAR\n\nThe new Mike Nichols film is a mixed bag: suave and zippy in the matter of Charlie Wilson (Tom Hanks) himself, the good-time congressman who channelled funds, guns, and moral support to the Afghans in their fight against the Soviet Union, but flip and slapdash when it comes to war itself. George Crile’s book was adapted for the screen by Aaron Sorkin, and the scenes of office politics—especially those in which Wilson jousts with Gust Avrakotos (Philip Seymour Hoffman), the bullish C.I.A. agent who runs the operation—are fluent, combative, and entertainingly distant from the drabness of actual politics. Hoffman pretty much strides away with the movie, leaving even Julia Roberts, in her role as a Texan society hostess, looking a little beached. The closer the story draws to front-line combat, where Wilson’s noble schemes come to fruition, the weaker and more embarrassing it grows; once again, like it or not, Nichols has proved himself to be a connoisseur of closed worlds.—A.L. (12/24 & 31/07) (In wide release.)\n\nDAISY KENYON\n\nFrom the first scene, when Dana Andrews haggles with a New York cabdriver and then waits to be buzzed into a walkup building, Otto Preminger builds his sombre yet frenetic 1947 melodrama from the stuff of life. Daisy Kenyon (a tightly restrained Joan Crawford), a successful fashion illustrator, is in love with Dan O’Mara (Andrews), a domineering, street-smart corporate lawyer who happens to be married. Suffering the eternal fate of the other woman, with stolen moments and broken dates, she starts to see Peter Lapham (Henry Fonda), a naval architect, twice-wounded war veteran, and depressed widower she finds “unstable.” Peter wants to marry her at once, but Dan doesn’t give up so easily; caught between the two, the tough, worldly Daisy begins to fall apart. Jolting behavioral touches—hard stares and startled retreats, sudden kisses, blows, and tears—thrust the action into the realm of mental disturbance. As Dan’s marriage breaks up and moves to the tabloid scandal of divorce court, the triangle builds to a fearsome pitch of emotional conflict and psychic crisis. Rarely have love and madness seemed so fruitfully allied.—Richard Brody (Film Forum; Jan. 2-3.)\n\nTHE DIVING BELL AND THE BUTTERFLY\n\nIn 1995, Jean-Dominique Bauby, the editor of French Elle, suffered, at the age of forty-three, a massive stroke that left him able to move nothing but his left eye. The short book that Bauby composed by blinking while a secretary ran through the alphabet serves as the basis for this astounding movie, which was directed by Julian Schnabel and written by Ronald Harwood. At first, we see only what Bauby (Mathieu Amalric) sees: a blur of faces, which turn out to be the doctors and nurses at the hospital, who float into view in fearsome closeup, like deep-sea monsters. Consciousness arrives, and we experience the discomforts of Bauby’s treatment. But then, by degrees, the movie opens up to the great world: Bauby’s life and past, his fantasies and dreams. The associations are wild and free, yet nothing feels arbitrary or showy. (One thinks of the visionary episodes in silent films rather than of Fellini.) We need this free-flowing beauty; we deserve it; the movie, in the end, is an overwhelming sensual experience. In French.—David Denby (12/3/07) (In wide release.)\n\nTHE GREAT DEBATERS\n\nDenzel Washington directs and stars in a fictionalized account of the nineteen-thirties Wiley College debate team, from Texas, which was the first from an all-black college to debate a team from a white school. The fourteen-year-old James Farmer, Jr. (the winsome Denzel Whitaker), the precocious son of a preacher (Forest Whitaker, no relation), is inspired by one of his college professors, Melvin B. Tolson (Washington, with his usual seductive authority), to join the debate team. The bad boy Henry Lowe (Nate Parker) and the ambitious beauty Samantha (Jurnee Smollett) round out the team, as well as the young-love triangle. In gauzy, predictable scenes, Tolson drills and goads his students, while at night he jeopardizes the team’s successful run by organizing a farmhands’ union. The actors bring great spirit to their roles, but all the supposedly edifying speeches render the drama stagnant.—Shauna Lyon (In wide release.)\n\nHONEYDRIPPER\n\nReviewed this week in The Current Cinema. (Cinema Village.)\n\nI AM LEGEND\n\nIn 1973, when “Day of the Dolphin” opened, Pauline Kael wrote that it was “the most expensive Rin Tin Tin picture ever made.” Alas, this is no longer true. Will Smith’s movie cost two hundred million dollars, and he spends almost the entire two hours talking to a German shepherd. Man and dog are apparently the only fully human and fully canine survivors after an anti-cancer serum has killed everyone else in the world except for some rabid humanoids and devil dogs. The digitized shots of an empty New York, with grass sprouting between the cracks in the pavement, are intriguing to look at, but the rest of the movie is a violent retread of older last-man-on-earth films with Vincent Price, Charlton Heston, and Don Johnson. The religious will be relieved to know that God is explicitly not responsible for eliminating the earth’s population. The villain is science. Directed by a badly overmatched Francis Lawrence.—D.D. (In wide release.)\n\nJOUR DE FÊTE\n\nThis recently restored color version of Jacques Tati’s first feature, from 1947, sheds new light on Tati’s intentions and the world he filmed. Shooting on location in the rustic village of Sainte-Sévère-sur-Indre, Tati used a muted, earth-toned palette to lend its heavy stone walls a timelessly ancient air. The story concerns the arrival of a travelling carnival for Bastille Day festivities and the bittersweet turmoil that follows, but the action is set in motion by the clash of cultures: old and new, rural and urban, French and American. In the first scenes, a local woman makes a splash with a gown she copied from a Parisian magazine, and a romance between the carny barker and a country girl unfolds to the sound of dialogue from an American Western playing in a nearby tent. Tati, a master mime (who here talks a blue streak in a country accent, usually to himself), plays François, the awkward local mailman, all elbows and angles, who makes his rounds on a rickety bicycle and is put to an uproariously comic test by jet-propelled methods imported from America. The gags run on the laughably unintended interconnectedness of mechanical things, but in Tati’s wistful vision, the chain reactions leave behind merely the memories of missed connections.—R.B. (Walter Reade; Jan. 4 and Jan. 6.)\n\nJUNO\n\nThe terrific comedy writer Diablo Cody, working with the director Jason Reitman, has fashioned this lovely little movie entirely from the point of view of a teen-age girl. Juno (Ellen Page) finds herself in a terrible fix—she’s pregnant at sixteen—and her initial reaction to her overwhelming new situation is to treat it with the same flip, pop-cult school-locker sarcasm that she uses for everything else. She decides to carry the baby to term and finds what seems like an ideal yuppie couple (Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner) to adopt it, but everything falls apart. Where are love and constancy to be found? Reitman stages Juno’s crisis with great gentleness, and enfolds it into a witty and playful formal frame: the narrative progresses through the seasons, starting in autumn, with the first three seasons corresponding to Juno’s trimesters. Kimya Dawson’s plaintively funny little songs provide additional punctuation, as do recurrent groups of runners from Juno’s high school, including Paul (Michael Cera), whose golden shorts reveal his best feature (according to Juno), his slender long legs. The writing throughout is both delicate and sharp.—D.D. (12/17/07) (In limited release.)\n\nTHE KITE RUNNER\n\nAn Afghan émigré to California, Amir (Khalid Abdalla), gets the chance to redeem himself after betraying, years ago, in Kabul, a servant boy who grew up in his household. Amir’s salvation is a rescue operation that requires him to go back to Afghanistan, now dominated by the Taliban. Shame is rarely an active emotion, and that may account, in part, for the movie’s slight stiffness and hesitancy. In addition, the director, Marc Forster, a Swiss-German, is working with Afghan and Iranian actors, and the differences in language seem to have eliminated speed and colloquial ease—the dialogue is well written, but there’s a bit of dead air around the lines. The best things in the movie are the portrait of Kabul’s flourishing upper-class life before the Soviets and then the Taliban took over and the depiction of the bleak hypocrisies of the Taliban period—the disgusting cruelties performed in the name of righteousness and the madness that makes it an offense to look at a woman’s face but acceptable to keep a young boy in sexual servitude. Adapted by David Benioff from the international best-seller by Khaled Hosseini.—D.D. (12/17/07) (In wide release.)\n\nNANKING\n\nAn exceptionally well-knit documentary about the horrifying events that took place in Nanking between December, 1937, and March, 1938, when the Japanese Army fell upon the city, then the capital of China, and slaughtered as many as three hundred thousand soldiers and civilians and raped twenty thousand women. Directed by Bill Guttentag and Dan Sturman, and produced by the AOL executive Theodore J. Leonsis, the movie integrates two kinds of material—letters and journals written mainly by Western observers of the events and read by actors (including Woody Harrelson and Mariel Hemingway), sitting in a rehearsal room, and historical footage of the bombardment and slaughter. It’s very likely that the anguish of a city helplessly besieged by a marauding army hasn’t been conveyed with comparable power since the Greek tragedies that were told from the Trojan point of view. The movie lays special emphasis on the heroic and largely forgotten efforts of Americans and Germans in Nanking to protect as many citizens as they could.—D.D. (Film Forum.)\n\nPERSEPOLIS\n\nA striking new animated production, made in France but rooted in Iran. Its origins lie in two graphic novels by Marjane Satrapi, who has co-directed the movie version with Vincent Paronnaud. She is plainly the source for her heroine, also named Marjane, who is born in Tehran during the Shah’s regime and grows up to witness the revolution of 1979; the mood, at first exultant, is soon darkened by a new sense of repression and threat. Marjane is an instinctive foe of the system, though her idea of rebellion is to listen to Iron Maiden in her bedroom, and a period spent as a student in Vienna ends in frustration and woe. Most of the film is in black-and-white, with sharply clipped and unshaded images; there is no denying their clarity and wit, yet the childish simplicity—like the general inexpressiveness of the faces—eventually pales, not least as Marjane leaves her own childhood behind. In the French version, the voice of her grandmother was supplied by Danielle Darrieux; U.S. audiences hear that of Gena Rowlands. A fair trade.—A.L. (12/24 & 31/07) (In wide release.)\n\nTHE SAVAGES\n\nA vital, honest, and engaging movie about two fortyish siblings who have never grown up. Philip Seymour Hoffman plays a saturnine literature professor who specializes in the most acidulous of twentieth-century artists, Bertolt Brecht, and Laura Linney is his kid sister, an unproduced playwright who gets by working temp jobs, stealing from office supply rooms, and hustling for grants. Unresolved in everything that matters, brother and sister, to their chagrin, find themselves in charge of their nasty and unreachable father (Philip Bosco), who has never given them any love. The movie, however, is less interested in their relation to him than in their cranky elbowing of each other. Written and directed by Tamara Jenkins, “The Savages” asks whether two people who have never been prized can possibly bring themselves to value anyone else or even themselves. The answer is soberly inspiring.—D.D. (12/3/07) (In wide release.)\n\nSTARTING OUT IN THE EVENING\n\nReviewed this week in The Current Cinema. (In wide release.)\n\nSWEENEY TODD\n\nIn many ways, Tim Burton should be the ideal director to bring Stephen Sondheim’s triumphant musical to the screen. The maker of “Edward Scissorhands” and “Sleepy Hollow” has repeatedly shown that he has a stomach for the bizarre and a sweet tooth for blood—or, at any rate, for displays of bright red. His regular muse, Johnny Depp, with his air of adventurous freakiness, seems equally primed for the part of Sweeney—the London barber who slashes the throats of customers and grinds the bodies up to fill the pies of Mrs. Lovett (Helena Bonham Carter) down below. All the more surprising, then, that the result of their collaboration should too often feel thin and cramped. Even with an arsenal of razors at hand, Sweeney comes across as more of a misfit than a murderer, and the romantic subplot, about a pair of star-crossed lovers (Jamie Campbell Bower and Jayne Wisener), verges on the twee. The best performances come from Alan Rickman, as the vulpine Judge Turpin (who alone brings a sexual frisson to the film), and Ed Sanders, both vital and solemn, as Mrs. Lovett’s assistant. The songs are delivered lustily, although audiences may not be ready for what is, in effect, a murky comic opera.—A.L. (12/24 & 31/07) (In wide release.)\n\nTHERE WILL BE BLOOD\n\nThis enthralling and powerfully eccentric American epic, written and directed by Paul Thomas Anderson (adapting Upton Sinclair’s garrulous 1927 novel, “Oil!”), covers a thirty-year span in the life of Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day-Lewis), who begins as a lonely silver miner in 1898 and winds up as one of the richest, and craziest, tycoons in early-twentieth-century California. Much of the first part of the movie is given over to raptly silent passages of physical effort—men lifting, hauling, pounding, wordlessly working in the muck and viscous slime. The film is about the driving force of capitalism as it both creates and destroys the future, and its tone is at once exhilarated and sickened. Day-Lewis lowers his chin slightly, and his dark eyes dance with merriment as he speaks in full, coarse, and rounded tones. It is the voice of dominating commercial logic, an American force of nature. Plainview’s great antagonist is a young man, Eli Sunday (Paul Dano), who thinks he has the word of God within him, and who creates, in the oil fields, the revivalist Church of the Third Revelation. Anderson has set up a kind of allegory of development, in which the two overwhelming forces—entrepreneurial capitalism and evangelism—build Southern California together and then, inevitably, fall into combat. Their final confrontation goes as far over the top as one of Plainview’s gushing wells. The music, at times distressing or pulse-raising, is by Jonny Greenwood, of Radiohead. The magnificent cinematography is by Robert Elswit.—D.D. (12/17/07) (In limited release.)\n\nWALK HARD: THE DEWEY COX STORY\n\nReviewed this week in The Current Cinema. (In wide release.)\n\nYOUTH WITHOUT YOUTH\n\nThe worst thing about Francis Ford Coppola’s movie is that it isn’t outrageous enough to become camp. A seventy-year-old Romanian linguist and polymath, Dominic (Tim Roth), struck by lightning in 1938, undergoes some sort of regenerative process and recovers the body of his forty-year-old self. Years later, in the mountains, he runs into a pretty girl, Veronica (Alexandra Maria Lara), and damned if she doesn’t get struck by lightning, too, at which point she turns into his long-dead paramour, now suddenly granted access to languages and civilizations from aeons ago. In the junk movies of the past, women inhabited by someone else’s soul spoke in tongues—maybe during sex—but, when Veronica bursts into Sumerian or Sanskrit, Coppola presents it as a revelation of the eternal return of civilization. The material is based on the work of the distinguished Romanian novelist and religious historian Mircea Eliade, but Eliade’s ideas may not be amenable to dramatic treatment, and, in this case, they have been handled with appalling solemnity. People sit around discussing time and language; professors with thick accents deliver opinions on arcane subjects; there’s a bald swami with a stick, as well as a cave in India with skulls and parchment that turns to dust. Some of the images and period settings are lovely, but Coppola, once the greatest storyteller in movies, has settled for the kind of unworkably pompous nonsense that most people leave behind in a college bull session. With Bruno Ganz.—D.D. (In wide release.)\n\nALSO PLAYING\n\nALVIN AND THE CHIPMUNKS: In wide release. THE ORPHANAGE: In wide release.
