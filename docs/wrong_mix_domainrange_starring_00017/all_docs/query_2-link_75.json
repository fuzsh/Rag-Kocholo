        "text": "It seems like from almost the moment Sophie Turner and Joe Jonas met, they knew they found someone special. They were engaged a year after they started dating, and married a few years after that. They've had two children together since.\n\nTheir relationship lasted until September 2023 when Jonas filed for divorce.\n\nHere’s the complete relationship timeline of the Game of Thrones star and DNCE musician, from the beginning of their romance to the current status of their divorce and lives post-breakup.\n\nOctober 2016\n\nFans noted Turner in the background of a group shot posted to Instagram, wearing bunny ears and standing just below Jonas, who seems to be a dog of some kind.\n\nNovember 2016\n\nJonas' band DNCE performs at the MTV EMAs, and he is seen sitting next to Turner at a pre-MTV Europe Music Awards Kings of Leon concert at the Oude Luxor Theater with his arm around her. They allegedly were kissing.\n\nThey're also spotted at a friend's wedding in Malibu along with his brother Nick Jonas.\n\nDecember 2016\n\nBy December, their relationship seems to be official, but they're still keeping things pretty private. A source tells People, “They’re dating exclusively. He was playing the field, but he really likes her and is willing to settle down for her.”\n\nJanuary 2017\n\nTo start the new year, Turner makes things Instagram official! Turner posted a photo of Jonas riding on the back of a boat while smoking a cigar, captioning it, “Miami daze.”\n\nA week later, Us Weekly reports that the pair were seen kissing at a Golden Globes after-party.\n\nFebruary 2017\n\nTurner posts a photo of herself looking fantastic in Louis Vuitton at the BAFTAs, as Jonas is in L.A. for the Grammys. He leaves her a fire emoji just to let her know how he feels about her look.\n\nMay 2017\n\nThey were allegedly seen kissing at the Met Gala afterparty but did not walk the red carpet together.\n\nJuly 2017\n\nStarting in July of that year, the couple slowly started talking more about their relationship.\n\n“I'm in a relationship, but it's a very private relationship,” Turner told the on July 4. She didn't say much else, except for sharing that she recently had become much more extroverted under the influence of... someone.\n\n“I very much isolated myself for a while and forgot what was fun. Going out with friends, going out to eat, not really having a care,” she explained. “And people I've met recently in my life have drawn me out of that. It really helps you own those insecurities. The things I tortured myself about before, I can forget about.”\n\nOn July 21, at Comic Con, Turner calls Jonas “a good accessory” before getting flustered.\n\n“I don't know, I don't know,” she tells Entertainment Weekly of Jonas rooting for her Thrones character Sansa Stark. “We don't talk about it...You made me blush! Oh god, yeah! I'm sweaty, I can't tell.”\n\nThe next day, she arrives at LAX wearing a denim jacket embroidered with “Kissing Strangers,” the name of a DNCE single.\n\nThen, on July 25, Turner shared in an interview with Marie Claire UK that she was “very happy” with Jonas, but it's not easy being in public.\n\n“You do feel like you're living in a fishbowl! It's frustrating [that] it's the most mundane things that make the news—how boring! There are really no other headlines?” Turner said.\n\nSeptember 2017\n\nThey adopt a puppy together, a Siberian Husky puppy named Porky Basquiat who currently has almost 100k followers on its own Instagram account.\n\nOctober 15, 2017\n\nAfter just about a year together, they announce their engagement with matching Instagram posts featuring the pear-cut diamond on Turner's finger.\n\n“She said yes,” Jonas captioned his pic.\n\nTurner wrote, “I said yes.”\n\nIn a comment, Nick Jonas wrote, “Ahh! Congratulations to my brother… and sister in law to be on your engagement. I love you both so much.”\n\nApril 2018\n\nTurner opens up about being engaged to People, saying it was fulfilling in a whole new way.\n\n“It's lovely to be engaged,” she said. “Not like I achieved anything, but I found my person, like I'd find a house that I love and want to stay in forever. There's a sense of peace that comes with finding your person. But there's a drive that comes with your career.”\n\nOctober 2018\n\nOn October 3, the couple make their red carpet debut at the Louis Vuitton show during Paris Fashion Week, though it was more of a street corner.\n\nTurner shared a pic from inside the event, where Jonas is kissing her on the cheek.\n\n“With my love in Paris,” she captioned the image.\n\nDecember 2018\n\nThe pair spent the holidays in London with Jonas' family, including the newly-married Nick Jonas and Priyanka Chopra.\n\n“Family,” Turner captioned the group pic of everyone enjoying dinner.\n\nMarch 2019\n\nTurner says in a cover story with Glamour UK that Jonas helped her find herself again after she had an “identity crisis” from growing up too fast amid her Games of Throne stardom.\n\n“A lot of [my happiness now] is to do with being with a person I've fallen in love with, who loves me more than he loves himself, and who wants to see me find my own happiness,” she said. “That was probably the biggest thing that pushed me to find who I am—and find my happiness in things other than acting.”\n\nThat same month, Turner starred in the Jonas Brothers' music video for “Sucker” along with Kevin Jonas' wife Danielle and Nick Jonas' wife Priyanka.\n\nLater, she told that making the video was “a lot more chaotic” than usual.\n\n“[With Game of Thrones] you have to be done with this scene by a certain time, and you have to say these words and stand at exactly these spots, because otherwise it wouldn't work. Whereas with a music video, it's just much more kind of free and loose and improvisational,” she explained.\n\nMay 2019\n\nIn an interview with the Sunday Times, Turner admitted they secretly broke up for about 24 hours before getting back together.\n\n“It was the worst day of our lives. For a second we both had cold feet, then 24 hours later we were both, like, ‘Never mind,’” Turner said.\n\nThat month, they committed hard and had a last-minute wedding in Las Vegas at the famous A Little White Wedding Chapel just a few hours after the Billboard Music Awards. Diplo live-streamed the event on his Instagram, Dan + Shay played music, and they said their vows with Ring Pop wedding rings. While his brothers were there, they forgot to invite the parents.\n\n“We had to get legally married in the states, so we thought it'd be really fun to get all of our friends, invite them out, and do an impromptu wedding,” Jonas later told . “And we actually had some people that I didn't really even know that well there.”\n\nThat month, they also walked the Met Gala red carpet together again.\n\nJune 2019\n\nOn June 29, they get married again in France for a more official ceremony with everyone gathered together.\n\nThe event was held at Le Château de Tourreau in Sarrians, France, and Turner's Game of Thrones costar Maisie Williams was her maid of honor. Nick and Kevin stood up with their brother.\n\nThey don't share many pics but occasionally dole out one or two for the fans.\n\nJune 2020\n\nTurner is spotted out with Jonas in Los Angeles, and it sure looks like she has a baby bump. A source tells People, “They are definitely preparing for the baby... She and Joe are both very happy.”\n\nJuly 2020\n\nOn July 22, 2020, Turner gives birth to the couple's first child, a baby girl named Willa. Their reps tell People, “Sophie Turner and Joe Jonas are delighted to announce the birth of their baby.”\n\nSeptember 2020\n\nOnce Willa is born, Turner seems to be comfortable finally sharing pregnancy pics. She posts one in her pool with their dog, another with Jonas placing his hands on her stomach, and one of her sitting on a couch outside in her bikini.\n\nJune 2021\n\nFor the couple's second wedding anniversary, Turner decides to let loose with the French wedding pics, revealing that it included a DJ set from Diplo, music from the Jonas Brothers, and a beautiful pool\n\nMay 2021\n\nJonas makes an appearance on CBS This Morning and talks about how “amazing” things have been during quarantine.\n\n“It's been forced time at home,” he explained. “I'm always moving and traveling and touring. And to be in one place for a solid amount of time and just have my feet on the ground and be with my immediate family, is time I don't think I'll get back. I'm so thankful and grateful.”\n\nSeptember 2021\n\nThe pair sell their Los Angeles home and move to Miami. Turner later tells ELLE UK that she hopes they end up in England.\n\n“We're very lucky to live in Miami. We have good weather and live by the water,” she shared. “I really love living in America but, for my mental health, I have to be around my friends and my family. And also for my daughter—I would love her to get the education and school life that I was so lucky to have. England would ideally be the final destination, but [Joe] might take quite a bit of convincing!”\n\nOctober 2021\n\nThe couple celebrate the 5th anniversary of their first date, with Jonas posting on with a montage commemorating meeting Turner for the first time.\n\nMay 2022\n\nOn May 2, Turner and Jonas walk the red carpet at the Met Gala, and they're accompanied by Turner's new baby bump.\n\nA day later, they officially confirm the news when Turner talks about how much she loves being a mother with ELLE UK.\n\n“It's what life is about for me—raising the next generation,” Turner explained. “The greatest thing in life is seeing my daughter go from strength to strength. We're so excited to be expanding the family. It's the best blessing ever.”\n\nJune 2022\n\nJonas is interviewed by People for a cover story with the Jonas Brothers, and discussed being a dad again, saying, “You really don't know what to expect. I think [I'm] maybe a little less nervous [this time], but I'm just excited...It's such an amazing part of life.”\n\nJuly 2022\n\nReps tell People that the couple has welcomed another baby girl, saying, “Joe and Sophie are happy to announce the arrival of their baby girl.”\n\nAugust 2022\n\nJonas discusses the “adjustment period” of work and family balance with People, admitting he's still “learning.”\n\n“It's an adjustment period,” Jonas said. “Just something that I'm learning as I go, I think I can now work a little bit harder to take time off. I'm still trying to figure it out. Some weeks are a little bit more challenging than others, but it makes it a lot easier when you enjoy your gig … I wake up every day just thrilled to be able to go make music or act and create different projects and have a beautiful family, so it feels like a dream come true.”\n\nSeptember 2022\n\nTurner and Jonas attend the premiere of the singer's new movie Devotion at the Toronto International Film Festival, their first red carpet appearance since the birth of their second child.\n\nNovember 2022\n\nIn an interview with MR PORTER, Jonas explains why privacy in his relationship with Turner is so important.\n\n“I want to feel like an open book,” he said. “But when we started dating, I realized that I didn't have a ton of stuff that was just for me. And in the end, it makes me a better person to have something for myself.”\n\nJanuary 2023\n\nWhile talking with Ryan Seacrest, Jonas said he asked Turner's dad for her hand in marriage, and it was nerve-wracking.\n\n“I was probably more nervous to ask her dad than I was to ask her,” he said. “You throw it out there, and you hope that the response is good. Luckily, it went well.”\n\nLater that month, Turner accompanied her husband as the Jonas Brothers received their star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. During his speech at the ceremony, Jonas shouted Turner out by saying, “Sophie, what up homie. You're my partner in crime. You keep me motivated and inspired every day. I strive to be as cool as you. You got any plans after this?”\n\nHe then mentioned his daughters, saying, “To my little ones at home, Daddy loves you to the moon and back.”\n\nMarch 2023\n\nJonas and Turner had a very public date night, attending the Vanity Fair Oscar after-party together on March 12.\n\nMay 2023\n\nTurner accidentally posted a video of her and Jonas' older daughter Willa briefly to her Instagram Story. She explained in a post after why she and Jonas still intend to keep their daughters' lives as private as possible. She wrote:\n\n“Earlier today I made an honest mistake accidentally posting a video of our daughter on instagram stories. We have always advocated for our kids’ rights to privacy so sharing this publicly is something that is against anything I stand for. Our children deserve the right to grow up out of the public eye, to learn and grow in private. If I ever were to post anything of our kids, know that it is unquestionably a mistake. I would greatly appreciate if anyone who has reposted on any other platform, please delete the video.”\n\nIn a lighter moment for the couple toward the end of May, Turner made a special appearance during Jonas' Chicken Shop Date video.\n\nAugust 2023\n\nTurner posted a birthday tribute to Jonas for his 34th birthday on August 15, featuring the couple in matching pajamas. “Happy birthday handsome,” she wrote, tagging Jonas.\n\nSeptember 2023\n\nSeptember 1-3: Divorce rumors surface.\n\nFans of the couple noted that they'd both been recently seen without their wedding rings during the first few days of September 2023.

As a family, they were based in Florida. The kids were with him the last few months, traveling with him with family while he’s been on tour. Sophie’s been working in the U.K.”\n\nThe source added that their divorce does not come as a “surprise” to those who know them.\n\nPage Six spoke to a source close to the Jonas family, who described the divorce being the result of “many disagreements” just adding up.\n\n“Divorce was a last resort for Joe,” Page Six’s source said. “He never wanted to break up his family, but he had to take what he felt was the best course of action for his girls.”\n\n“An unhappy home isn’t a home, and the truth is that he and Sophie were going through it this year,” the source continued. “There’s a lot of noise out there, but it wasn’t a straw-that-broke-the-camel’s-back situation like it’s being reported. [The disagreements] just kept building, and Joe finally reached a point where he felt that he had exhausted all options to salvage the marriage.”\n\nSeptember 6: Jonas and Turner release a joint statement confirming their divorce. Jonas changes Turner-inspired song lyrics during his concert that night.\n\nDuring the morning, Jonas and Turner released a joint statement on their Instagram accounts confirming their separation. “After four wonderful years of marriage we have mutually decided to amicably end our marriage,” they said. “There are many speculative narratives as to why but, truly this is a united decision and we sincerely hope that everyone can respect our wishes for privacy for us and our children.”\n\nFans also noted that during his concert in Phoenix, Arizona, on Wednesday, September 6, Jonas changed the lyrics to “Hesitate,” a song he wrote in honor of Turner.\n\n“Don’t be scared because I’m on her side,” Jonas sang in footage posted to social media. The original line was “Don’t be scared because I’m on your side.”\n\nHe stated in the Jonas Brothers’ 2020 documentary, Chasing Happiness, what the song was about.\n\n“‘Hesitate’ is a song I wrote. It’s like my vows before I wrote my vows. It’s my promise to Sophie,” he said. “I can see in the audience when it’s definitely those other people’s songs. I see couples holding each other. I see somebody, that song got them through something.”\n\nHe continued, “For me, it takes me to a whole other universe, I’m seeing her walk down the aisle again every time I close my eyes.”\n\nSeptember 9: Jonas tries to distance himself from comments sources linked to him made disparaging Turner.\n\nOn Saturday, September 9, Jonas seemed to walk back some of the statements that have been circulating about the split between himself and Turner. While on stage for a Jonas Brothers concert in Los Angeles at Dodger Stadium, the singer stated, “I just wanna say, look: if you don’t hear it from these lips, don’t believe it. Okay? Thank you everyone for your love and support. Me and my family love you guys.”\n\nSeptember 21: Turner sues Jonas for keeping their children from returning with her to England. His rep releases a statement in response to her filing.\n\nTurner filed a lawsuit in New York City on September 21, claiming that Jonas was withholding their two children’s passports and keeping them from their “habitual residence” of England.\n\nOutlets widely report on the and all they revealed about Jonas and Turner’s relationship and how quickly their marriage dissolved.\n\nTurner claimed in them that she learned about Jonas filing for divorce through the media and that they had agreed in December 2022 to make England their “forever home.” She detailed how they had taken steps in the months after to make that transition. She also indicated her intent to file another suit in England for custody.\n\nJonas’ rep responded to her filing with a long statement to TMZ. The rep claimed that Jonas needs to keep the children in the U.S. so he does not violate his divorce filing in Florida. “The Florida Court has already entered an order that restricts both parents from relocating the children,” the rep said.\n\nAttorneys not associated with Turner and Jonas’ case told Page Six that due to their filing in two different jurisdictions, the matter isn’t likely to be resolved easily or quickly. “It’s going to be a long court battle,” New York trial lawyer Aaron Richard Golub said, adding it is one that “is going to swing like a pendulum.”\n\nSeptember 22: Jessica Chastain and Roxanne Gay tweet in support of Turner.\n\nOn Friday, September 22, actress Jessica Chastain reposted a tweet from author Roxane Gay. It read, “The way Joe Jonas miscalculated his popularity with his transparent attempts at PR manipulation, particularly when the North remembers is FASCINATING.”\n\nShe added, “And holding the children’s passports to keep them from their mother? Bruh. And the thing is, these are not people I know or follow. I just read the ‘news.’ He has handled this SO badly that now I’m paying attention.”\n\nChastain shared the first tweet, adding a reference to Gay as “The Oracle.”\n\nSeptember 25: Jonas and Turner legally agree to keep children in New York while they figure out custody case.\n\nBoth Jonas and Turner signed an interim consent order that multiple media outlets obtained where they agreed to have their children remain in New York as they work through their custody case.

Page Six noted that the former couple is due to appear in court on October 3 for a pretrial conference.\n\nSeptember 29: The custody case reveals Joe Jonas wrote a letter about wanting to live in England.\n\nIn July, Jonas and Turner were looking to buy a property in Wallingford, England. As part of their attempt to close on the house, Jonas wrote a letter to the then-owner to persuade them to sell to the celebrity couple.\n\nThe letter was shared by Page Six, and it includes a rave review of living in the U.K. from Jonas.\n\n“When my wife and I decided we were going to spend more time in the UK and search for a permanent home, our daughter expressed three unwavering requirements: having chickens, a pony and a Wendy house,” the musician allegedly stated. “While many of the houses we viewed met this criteria, the moment we turned the corner and caught sight of the charming blue shutters adorning [redacted], we experienced a sense of magic unlike anything we had felt before.”\n\nHe went on to discuss how he and Turner would live in the house, building out a music studio and working on the garden.\n\n“We could tell that your family have truly loved living here and we can envision our children growing up here and making this our forever home,” the letter supposedly goes on. “I really think Sophie and I will be able to look after [redacted names] and for many years pay homage to the magic you have created here.”\n\nThe sale has not closed, and their divorce commenced two months after putting down a ten percent deposit on the property.\n\nOctober 2023\n\nOctober 4: Jonas and Turner start mediation for child custody.\n\nJonas and Turner started their 4-day mediation for child custody and their divorce. A source told Page Six that Jonas was hopeful about the mediation going in. “Joe is committed to making it work with Sophie in mediation and doesn’t want to put up a fight—as long as they can come to a fair agreement on the kids,” the source said. No source associated with Turner spoke out on her perspective.\n\nOctober 10: Court documents reveal Jonas and Turner’s temporary agreement for custody through the end of 2023. The couple releases a statement on custody.\n\nJonas and Turner came to a temporary agreement for custody of their daughters. In court documents obtained by multiple outlets, including People, Turner and Jonas will alternate having their daughters for two weeks each.

Jonas will then have custody from October 21-November 2 with the same travel permissions, with the couple handing off their girls in New York City.\n\nFrom November 2-22, Turner will have custody, then Jonas from November 22 to December 16. Turner will have her daughters for the holidays, from December 16 to January 6.\n\nTheir agreement states that by December 23, “the parties shall jointly submit a status report letter” on their mediation.\n\nShortly after the court documents’ release, Turner and Jonas shared a joint statement on their progress. “After a productive and successful mediation, we have agreed that the children will spend time equally in loving homes in both the U.S. and the U.K.,” they said. “We look forward to being great co-parents.”\n\nOctober 12: Jonas filed a petition to dismiss his Miami case as he and Turner pursue a private resolution to their divorce.\n\nIn a sign of progress made between Turner and Jonas, Page Six obtained court documents showing that Jonas filed to dismiss his petition in Miami so the couple could handle their divorce in private.\n\nIn the docs, per Page Six, Jonas shared that he and Turner reached “various agreements” after their mediation last week and plan to “pursue an amicable resolution of all issues.”\n\nNovember 2023\n\nNovember 1\n\nTurner is photographed kissing British aristocrat Peregrine Pearson in Paris. A source explained to Us Weekly later that day that Turner is not committed to anyone but is open to dating again.\n\n“She’s definitely putting herself out there and keeping her options open,” the source said, going on to describe her and Pearson as “not serious at all.” She is “casually dating a few people,” the source said, adding, “There are a few men she’s shown interest in but [Sophie] isn’t jumping into anything or settling down.”\n\nA second source addressed Jonas’ feelings on her dating and where he stands on it for himself. He is not “concerned” about Turner seeing new people.\n\n“He’s focusing his energy on his music and his family,” the source said. “Joe is doing great, and he had an amazing time celebrating Halloween with his daughters [whom he shares with Turner and had custody of that past week]. He has a lot on his plate between his career and his girls, so he doesn’t even have time to date.”\n\nDecember 2023\n\nClose to the holidays, Jonas was spotted in London at Chiltern Firehouse, according to TMZ. According to their former couple's custody agreement, Turner is set to have the kids for Christmas and through January 7. It is speculated that they might end up spending the holiday together, or that the girls will see their dad for part of Christmas.\n\nJanuary 2024\n\nAccording to court documents obtained by People, Turner filed to dismiss her September charges against Jonas where she alleged “wrongful retention” of their children. The U.S. judge approved the dismissal after Jonas and Turner signed a parenting agreement approved by a U.K. judge on January 11.\n\nMarch 2024\n\nTMZ reported on March 18 that Turner filed legal documents to reopen her and Jonas’ divorce case. The proceedings had been put on hold while the former couple went to mediation to privately work out a property and child custody agreement.\n\nThe outlet reported that Turner is now asking a judge to hear their case and grant a court-ordered settlement. This move means that Jonas and Turner’s filings in the case will be public."
