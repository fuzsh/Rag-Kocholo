        "text": "Sophie Turner was definitely not into the JoBros before she met her husband. “My friends and I were not Jonas Brothers fans … We hated them,” the actress told Elle for its April 2020 issue. But that all changed after he reached out on social media.\n\n“We were following each other on Instagram and he direct messaged me one fine day, out of the blue,” she shared in her May 2019 cover story with Harper’s Bazaar U.K. Eventually, they met at a bar, where the musician won her over. “I expected him to show up with security and everything,” she told Elle. “I thought, ‘He’s gonna be such a d–k.’\n\n“We talked for hours, and hours, and hours. And I was, like, not bored. It wasn’t contrived. It wasn’t small talk — it was just so easy,” she shared. “And soon we were, like, inseparable. I went on tour with him.”\n\nThe Game of Thrones star appeared on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon while pregnant with her second child, around the time the couple was celebrating their third wedding anniversary. During the chat, the comedian asked Turner when she knew Jonas was the man for her. Turns out, it was basically immediately.\n\n“The first night I met him, I remember, like, he left my apartment,” she recalled, saying that she and a bunch of their friends had met at a bar before heading to her place. “I wept to my brother. I was like, ‘I love this man so much!’ And I knew! And that was it!”\n\nThe former couple addressed their split in a joint statement posted to their social media accounts.\n\n“After four wonderful years of marriage we have mutually decided to amicably end our marriage,” their statement began. “There are many speculative narratives as to why but, truly this is a united decision and we sincerely hope that everyone can respect our wishes for privacy for us and our children.”\n\nIt turns out the split may not have been as amicable as the former couple had indicated. On Sept. 21, the actress filed suit in New York against her estranged husband, alleging that the singer had “wrongful retention of two children … from their habitual residence of England,” according to the court document obtained by Billboard. She also claimed in her filing that she found out he had filed for divorce through the media.\n\nJonas denied the allegations to Billboard through a rep, who said the two had met just days earlier had agreed to “work together towards an amicable co-parenting setup.”\n\n“Joe is seeking shared parenting with the kids so that they are raised by both their mother and father, and is of course also OK with the kids being raised both in the U.S. and the U.K.,” the statement continued. “This is an unfortunate legal disagreement about a marriage that is sadly ending.”"
