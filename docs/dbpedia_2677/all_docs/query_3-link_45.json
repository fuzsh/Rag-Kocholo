        "text": "Fun game to practice logical thinking and matching skills.\n\nMy son and I had a lot of fun testing this game out to see how it worked. I was very happy with how it turned out. The adorable animals and bright colors make it a fun way to spend time together while also reinforcing several skills. This game really makes them use those logical thinking skills to plan out where they will put their next card. It also works their matching skills as they look for the animals to match the ones on their cards.\n\nThere are 6 pages of cards in three colors. Print and laminate the cards. Then play dominos. Instructions are included.\n\nGreat for family quality time or for boredom breakers!\n\nClick Below To Download\n\nSuggestions, requests, questions, corrections, or comments?\n\nUse our worksheets or activities?\n\nSend a picture to be featured in a future post!\n\nEmail to: miniaturemasterminds@gmail.com\n\nThis download is mostly color and free to use for any daycare, church, school, personal, co op, or home school use.\n\nWe all make mistakes sometimes, if you happen to find one of mine feel free to email me and let me know so I can correct it!\n\nTERMS OF USE:\n\nAll activity images, printables, and games are free to download and/or use as you choose, with the exception of claiming as your own, modifying, or redistributing as your own.
