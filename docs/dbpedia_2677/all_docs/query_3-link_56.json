        "text": "The channel is the first piece of work from VCCP since it added the digital brief for the brand last month, following its appointment as lead creative and digital agency in April.\n\nIt can be found on Sky channel 539, Virgin channel 269, Freesat channel 164, YouTube, TVPlayer, TVGuide and Zattoo.\n\nDescribed as a \"one-stop-shop for soothing, relaxing programming\" that \"requires absolutely no brain power\", the channel will feature content like sunsets, a roaring fire, cute animals and hints and tips on how to de-stress.\n\nThe messaging of the channel is that Domino’s is the \"official food of recovery\" – a continuation of the positioning launched by VCCP in September, \"The official food of everything\".\n\nPromotion of the channel will run beforehand across social media, digital and eCRM. The TV channel booking is being undertaken by Arena Media.\n\nTony Holdway, sales and marketing director for Domino’s, said: \"We know that New Year’s Day can be a struggle for some and for that reason we are excited to be able to provide 24 hours of non-stop entertainment.\n\n\"Taking over a TV channel for a day is a bold move, but I’m confident that the Recovery Channel will become the official channel for 1 January. The same way that Domino’s pizza is 'The official food of everything', including days when you don’t leave the sofa,\" he added.\n\nPete Grenfell, managing director, VCCP Partnership, said: \"Domino’s is an iconic brand, which deserves ideas that can help to reinforce this status.\n\n\"The Recovery Channel is exactly that. An idea than spans digital, social and advertising to create a memorable (and relaxing) start to the year for both viewers and the brand.\""
