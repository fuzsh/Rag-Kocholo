Undefeated, Domino's has instead started to deliver via scooters dressed as reindeer, complete with antlers and a fluffy tail.\n\nThe program was ostensibly introduced to demonstrate the company's new GPS-based delivery service, which allowed customers to monitor their piping hot pizza's path on a special app. The reindeer were included as a novel way of battling Hokkaido's blizzard conditions, where temperatures regularly drop into the low 20s.\n\nDomino's even released a detailed action plan as part of the stunt, comparing the advantages of using a reindeer to a helicopter or a car. They noted \"it didn't need a license\" since it was a \"light vehicle,\" could \"carry heavy items,\" and came with \"no costs.\"\n\nSocial media was split on the announcements, with some \"calling it out for animal cruelty\" and others asking how they could \"tip it\" and \"what happens if it eats all the pizzas instead.\""
