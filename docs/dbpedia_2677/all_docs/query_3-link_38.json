This process will require minor excavating around the meter box.

This is a long-term project over the next full year. Our goal is 20 a week. You may notice some sand around your meter boxes after our investigation, where we filled in the holes. Lastly, Once the information is gathered and submitted to the TCEQ, we will be making the information available on the city website for you to view.\n\nIf you have any questions, please email me at: PWD@cityofleonard.net\n\nThank you,\n\nWoody Patrick\n\nPublic Works Director\n\nCity of Leonard, Texas\n\n111 W.

These types of issues are clear and present in every city, and it is upon each one to find a solution that is right for them. Please ensure that you and your animals are in compliance.\n\nThe humane control and treatment of animals are regulated by state laws, as well as being the subject of some of our ordinances dedicated to promoting the benefit, health, safety, and welfare of the general public (and its pets). The City of Leonard is not currently equipped to safely and humanely trap, transport, or shelter animals. For example, animal control officers require special training, certifications, and vaccinations; and facilities must meet certain standards. After surveying surrounding cities, as well as the county and the state health and licensing boards, the city selected All American Dogs based on recommendations from other municipalities that have utilized or are currently utilizing their services. All American Dogs is a company which is equipped and trained to handle these matters, shifting the administrative time and allowing your public works team to focus on much needed maintenance and repairs.\n\nAs a reminder, the City of Leonard’s Animal Control Ordinance requires that pets be vaccinated and registered, and that such vaccinations and registrations be kept current. It also states that animals shall not be allowed to roam at large or present a nuisance to other people, passing vehicles, or other animals. In case that doesn’t happen, the city needs a solution and a mechanism to keep people and animals safe from harm. Most of the animals which come through the city are not tagged or registered and it is not feasible to determine the owners, or if any exist at all.\n\nAll American Dogs will pick up animals in violation of the ordinances, aggressive or roaming free. They will also pick up animals or lost pets which are caught and held by citizens until animal control can arrive. Their goal is to respond in thirty minutes of receiving the report, barring any emergency calls.\n\nPet owners will be responsible for any fees associated with the impoundment and keeping of stray animals, to be paid directly to All American Dogs before the animal can be retrieved.\n\nFees:\n\nImpoundment Fee: $75.00\n\nBoarding Fee: $15.00 per day or portion thereof\n\nTrapping Fee: $60.00\n\n10-day Quarantine $300 – 400 depending on aggression\n\nAfter appropriate fees are paid, All American Dogs will return the pet to the owner, or the owner can drive to their facility to pick it up.\n\nLost/found pets can still be reported to City Hall at 903-587-3334. Found pets will be posted to All American Dogs’ Facebook page “All American Dogs Shelter in Pilot Point Texas.” City of Leonard will attempt to contact the owners and share any pictures/posts of found pets to our Facebook page “City of Leonard”.\n\nAll American Dogs can be contacted directly at 972-382-3647.\n\nThank you for your cooperation.\n\nGeorge Evanko\n\nCity Administrator\n\nThe City of Leonard\n\n_____________________________________\n\nNOTICE OF PUBLIC HEARING\n\nON VOLUNTARY ANNEXATION\n\nNOTICE IS HEREBY GIVEN TO ALL INTERESTED PERSONS, THAT:\n\nThe City Council for the City of Leonard will conduct a Public Hearing on Tuesday, February 14, 2023, at 6:30 P.M. at the Leonard City Hall Council Chambers located at 111 West Collin Street, Leonard, Texas giving all interested persons the right to appear and be heard on the following proposed voluntary annexations by the City of Leonard.

If you have a leak, you’ll want to attend to it as quickly as possible to keep your bill down and conserve the city resources. We have heard of several such situations already, and are requesting the participation of residents, landlords, business owners, and property owners at this time.\n\nIf you notice a water leak:\n\nReport the leak by calling 903-587-3334\n\nEmail utilitybilling@cityofleonard.net\n\nIf you experienced a leak:\n\nProof of repair will be required at the time you file your water loss claim, and adjustments will be processed within ten (10) business days. Please refer to the City’s water loss policy and claim form.\n\nIf you need to make plumbing repairs, or have made plumbing repairs:\n\nA building permit is required to perform plumbing work in the city. Due to the extenuating circumstances, the city is waiving permit fees at this time for plumbing repairs due to the freeze. We are NOT currently waiving the requirement for building permits or the requirement for plumbing work to be completed by an authorized person, or for a contractor registered with the city. Contractors must be licensed and registered.\n\nPer City Ordinance:\n\nNo person shall engage in work or the conduct of the business of plumbing within the municipality, except as herein specifically exempted, unless such person is the holder of a valid license as issued by the state board of plumbing examiners. Nothing contained herein shall prohibit the employment of a journeyman plumber or apprentice to engage in plumbing work under the general supervision of a master plumber nor plumbing work done by a property owner in a building or on premises owned or occupied by him or her as his or her home. (2002 Code, sec. 150.041)\n\nThank you for your patience and cooperation while we get the City back up and running to better serve you.\n\nThe City of Leonard"
