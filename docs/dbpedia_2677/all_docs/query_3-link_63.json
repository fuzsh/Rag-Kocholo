        "text": "Category: Press Release\n\nHumane Society International\n\nThis Friday, on World Egg Day, Humane Society International celebrates the growing number of Singaporeans buying cage-free eggs. The Singaporean cage-free market has grown over the past two years, with at least five brands of cage-free eggs now available at supermarkets in the city-state. A growing number of socially responsible restaurants and hotels are also featuring cage-free eggs on their menus.\n\nPenny Cox, vice president of commercial & marketing at home-grown online supermarket RedMart Limited, says, “Since the launch of RedMart Cage Free Eggs in June this year, growth has been over 20 percent month on month, with August to September growth expected to hit around 30 percent. This clearly demonstrates that there is a real and growing appetite within our customer base for cage-free eggs.”\n\nThe majority of egg-laying hens in the world, including hens raised in facilities serving the Singaporean market, are confined to barren battery cages for nearly their entire lives. Given space about the size of a single sheet of paper to live in, each hen is unable to fully spread her wings, much less engage in important natural behaviours like nesting, perching and dustbathing. This kind of intensive confinement leads to physical and psychological suffering.\n\nMajor companies worldwide are switching to cage-free eggs over conventional battery cage eggs in their supply chains. The rise of cage-free eggs in Singapore speaks to a global trend of increasing consumer interest in animal welfare. In fact, some of the largest food companies and hospitality chains around the world have made commitments to source 100 percent cage-free eggs throughout their supply chains, including in Singapore. This list includes AccorHotels, Compass Group, Hilton Hotels and Resorts, Marriott Hotels and Resorts, Nestle, Sodexo and Unilever, among others.\n\nDawn Neo, HSI’s corporate outreach manager for Asia, says, “It is heartening to see more consumers in Singapore embrace higher animal welfare products such as cage-free eggs. By making better food choices, consumers can improve the lives of millions of farm animals.”\n\nSupport farm animals.\n\nPeople can also eat more compassionately by reducing consumption of eggs or switching to cage-free eggs. It is easy to prepare egg-free versions of almost any dish or dessert, and plenty of egg substitutes and cage-free egg brands are available. HSI advocates compassionate eating – or the Three Rs: “reducing” or “replacing” consumption of animal products with plant-based foods, and “refining” our diets by avoiding products from farms with abusive practices, such as the confinement of hens in cages and choosing products from sources that adhere to higher animal welfare standards.\n\nSupermarket chains in various countries have committed to stop selling eggs from caged hens within the next 10 years or less. These include all major supermarket chains in U.K. and New Zealand, all of the top 25 food retailers in the U.S. and Canada, Woolworths and ALDI in Australia, and many more.\n\nMedia contact: Dawn Neo, dneo@hsi.org, +65 91999608\n\nReference in the article to any specific commercial product or service, or the use of any trade, firm or corporation name is for the information of the public and does not constitute or imply endorsement, recommendation or approval by Humane Society International or any of its partner organizations of the product or service, or its producer or provider. The views and opinions of interviewees expressed in the article do not necessarily state or accurately reflect those of Humane Society International or its partner organizations.\n\nHumane Society International\n\nHumane Society International, along with the Fur Free Alliance, are pleased that the leading global fashion house Gucci has announced it will no longer use animal fur, beginning with its spring summer 2018 collection. Gucci’s President & CEO Marco Bizzarri announced the fur-free policy on Wednesday, October 11th during the 2017 Kering Talk at The London College of Fashion.\n\nGucci’s commitment follows a long-standing relationship with The Humane Society of the United States and LAV—members of the international Fur Free Alliance, a coalition of more than 40 animal protection organizations working together to end the fur trade.\n\nGucci’s fur-free policy includes mink, coyote, raccoon dog, fox, rabbit, and karakul (otherwise known as Swakara, Persian lamb or astrakhan) and all others species specially bred or caught for fur.\n\nThe HSUS and LAV will continue to support Gucci in identifying and reducing its impact on animals and the environment.\n\nThe company joins many other leading fashion brands and retailers in going fur-free—including Armani, HUGO BOSS, Yoox Net-a-Porter, Stella McCartney and more—and will be part of the international Fur Free Retailer Program.\n\nKitty Block, President of Humane Society International, said: “Gucci going fur-free is a huge game-changer. For this powerhouse to end the use of fur because of the cruelty involved will have a huge ripple effect throughout the world of fashion. A staggering one hundred million animals a year still suffer for the fur industry, but that can only be sustained for as long as designers continue to use fur and consumers purchase it. So we commend Gucci’s compassionate decision, and for helping to ensure that the future of fashion is fur-free.”\n\nMarco Bizzarri, Gucci’s President & CEO, said: “Being socially responsible is one of Gucci’s core values, and we will continue to strive to do better for the environment and animals. With the help of HSUS and LAV, Gucci is excited to take this next step and hopes it will help inspire innovation and raise awareness, changing the luxury fashion industry for the better.”\n\nJoh Vinding, Chairman of Fur Free Alliance, said: “For decades animals in the fur industry has been subjected to intense cruelty, living their entire lives in miserable, filthy cages. Gucci’s new fur free policy marks a game-changer for the whole luxury fashion industry to follow. Gucci is taking a bold stand for animals, showing the world that the future of fashion is fur-free.”\n\nFor further information, please direct enquiries to:\n\nHarriet Barclay, HBarclay@HSI.org, +44 (0) 7794354596\n\nHumane Society International\n\nSão Paulo State Penitentiary System has become the first penitentiary system in Brazil to serve exclusively meat-free meals one day a week in its correctional facilities. The institution’s adoption of this program follows discussions with Humane Society International, Sociedade Vegetariana Brasileira and State Representative Roberto Tripoli. The new program will be implemented in 48 units of the São Paulo State Penitentiary System, and serving more than 46,600 meals per week.\n\nSandra Lopes, food policy manager for HSI Farm Animals in Brazil, stated: “Reducing our meat consumption is one the most effective ways we can help the environment and our health, and we applaud the Secretariat of Penitentiary Administration of the State of São Paulo for joining this initiative. We look forward to continuing to work together to ensure the success of this program, and to working with other institutions on the adoption and implementation of similar programs, including through our workshops and culinary trainings for chefs.”\n\nThe São Paulo penitentiary system joins thousands of schools, hospitals, restaurants and consumers in Brazil and around the world that participate in Meatless Monday or similar programs to reduce their environmental impact, improve public health and reduce animal suffering.\n\nHSI promotes humane eating or the 3 R’s: reducing our consumption of animal-based foods, refining our diets by choosing animal products from sources that adhere to higher animal welfare standards and renewing our diets by replacing meat and other animal-based foods with plant-based options.\n\nFacts:\n\nA growing number of school districts in Brazil are adopting Meatless Monday, including the State of São Paulo and City of Paulicéia school districts.\n\nWe can significantly reduce our environmental footprint by eating more plant-based meals. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, animal agriculture is one of the greatest contributors to the most serious environmental issues, like global warming, and is a major consumer of scarce water resources. For example, in terms of protein, the water footprint is six times bigger for beef, and one and a half times larger for chicken, eggs and milk, than it is for legumes.\n\nChoosing plant-based foods helps our health. Many of the chronic diseases plaguing the world, including obesity, heart disease, diabetes and high blood pressure, can be prevented, treated and, in some cases, even reversed with a healthy plant-based diet.\n\nBrazil is currently facing an obesity epidemic, with 60 percent of the population obese or overweight, including children. One in three children between the ages of five and nine are obese or overweight.\n\nMeatless Monday also reduces animal suffering. Tens of millions of animals in food production in Brazil, like egg-laying hens and breeding sows, spend virtually their whole lives confined in small cages where they can’t express natural behaviors.

The proposed legislation will now move to debate and a final vote in the Canadian Senate. If the bill passes this stage, it will proceed to the House of Commons. Senators amended the bill in committee to include a phase-in period to allow industry time to comply with the legislation.\n\nTroy Seidle, HSI’s senior director of research and toxicology, issued the following statement:\n\n“Cosmetic testing on animals is an outdated, needless practice with no place in a modern and progressive society. It is for that reason that 37 countries – including the world’s largest cosmetics markets – have taken action to ban or restrict their trade in cosmetics tested on animals. Yet here in Canada, it remains perfectly legal for cosmetic chemicals to be dripped into rabbits’ eyes and spread on their delicate skin, all for the sake of a new lipstick and skin cream. We are calling on the Canadian Senate to pass S-214 and for the House of Commons to move quickly to adopt this lifesaving legislation.”\n\n“Animal Alliance and Humane Society International commissioned a poll which showed that 81 percent of Canadians support a national ban on cosmetic animal testing,” said Liz White, director, Animal Alliance of Canada. “Today’s decision was an important step forward in respecting Canadian opinion and bringing our industry standards into line with those of other developed nations.”\n\nThe Animal Alliance and HSI poll is available here.\n\nMedia Contact: Christopher Pare, 514 395-2914 x 206, cpare@hsi.org\n\nHumane Society International\n\nThe Quebec coroner’s office released its report on the death of Christine Vadnais, who in 2016 was attacked by a dog misidentified by the media as a pit bull.\n\nFollowing this tragic event, the City of Montreal and other municipalities moved to ban pit bull-type dogs while the Province of Quebec introduced Bill 128, which also aims to prohibit certain breeds of dogs in the entire province. The coroner, Dr. Ethan Lichtblau, concludes in his report that:\n\nThe dog who attacked Ms. Vadnais cannot be formally identified as a pit bull type even with DNA test results;\n\nA lack of socialization and stimulation, as well as basic care, are factors that probably led to his dangerous behavior; and\n\nBreed-specific legislation is not an effective measure to protect the public.\n\nEwa Demianowicz, campaign manager for Humane Society International/Canada, issued the following statement:\n\n“From the very beginning, we warned the City of Montreal that banning certain breeds of dogs is not an effective measure to prevent bites. Yet our elected officials chose to ignore sound science and expert advice by adopting a senseless ban on pit bulls and pit bull type dogs. The coroner’s report is the latest in a long list of expert testimony and studies that conclude that responsible animal management should avoid breed-specific language and focus instead on community education, enforcement and appropriate pet care.\n\n“It is heartbreaking to read in the report that this tragic event may even have been prevented had the municipality followed up on previous dog bite incidents implicating the same dog. The inaction of the authorities and the lack of enforcement of by-laws that were already in place have contributed to this tragic event, but sadly our governments continue to use pit bulls as scapegoats.\n\n“As cited in the report, the City of Calgary – which adopted an approach based on responsible pet ownership – has been able to reduce the rate of incidents with dogs by 78 percent without any breed ban. This approach has been proven to work and should serve as a model for governments across the country.\n\n“We hope that the coroner’s findings will help us move forward towards humane, efficient and enforceable legislation that will truly protect the public, and we call on the City of Montreal to revoke its breed specific legislation.”\n\nFacts:\n\nThe coroner has made several recommendations following his findings, mainly to create a centralized database of incident reports implicating dogs, mandatory municipal dog licensing, measures to increase canine sterilization, fair and objective means of defining a “dangerous” dog, and an emphasis on public awareness and education.\n\nThere is no evidence that breed-specific laws reduce dog bites or attacks on people and no jurisdiction has been able to prove that this kind of legislation has improved public safety. After more than 10 years of a breed ban in Ontario, rates of dog bites are higher than ever. These laws are costly, cannot be effectively enforced, and unnecessarily harm families, dogs and communities.\n\nThe best way to prevent dog bites is through proactive outreach across all sectors in the community. The Canadian Veterinary Medical Association and the Ordre des médecins vétérinaires du Québec have clear position statements that do not support breed specific legislation.\n\nExperts have consistently found that no one breed is more likely to bite than another. Factors that are scientifically linked to aggression in dogs include neglect, abuse and leaving animals unsterilized; effective public safety legislation focuses on these areas instead of ineffective and harmful breed bans.\n\nIn the past 30 years, six individuals have been killed by dogs in Quebec. Of the eight dogs involved in these deaths, seven were husky type dogs and the breed of the dog involved in the death of a Montreal woman in 2016 has not been conclusively determined. Notably, breed specific legislation rarely targets breeds other than pit bull type dogs.\n\nIn April 2017, the Quebec government introduced Bill 128 that would give the government new powers to impose restrictions on certain dogs and their owners, including bans on specific breeds. The proposed legislation specifically targets pit bull type dogs and Rottweilers, as well as crosses of those breeds. The bill has not been yet adopted.\n\nMedia Contact: Christopher Paré, 514 395-2914 x 206, cpare@hsi.org\n\nCanadian fashion icon and Order of Canada recipient supports the Cruelty-Free Cosmetics Act (S-214)\n\nHumane Society International\n\nFashion reporter, author and columnist Jeanne Beker is calling on Canada to ban animal testing in the beauty industry. The Canadian fashion and media icon is making her plea on behalf of the #BeCrueltyFree Canada campaign led by Humane Society International and Animal Alliance of Canada, part of the largest ever global campaign for an end to cosmetics cruelty.\n\nAsked about her support, Beker said: “There’s nothing fashionable about cruelty to animals. Cosmetic animal testing is a senseless practice that has no place in a humane nation, and that is why 37 countries have already taken action to stop animal testing for cosmetics. I am grateful to the Canadian Senate for considering this important issue and I am calling upon the Canadian government to pass a strong ban on cosmetic animal testing and trade. It’s time for Canada to #BeCrueltyFree!”\n\nMost Canadians share Beker’s sentiments on cosmetic animal testing. There is substantial public support for bans on cosmetics animal testing, both within Canada and globally. Eight out of every 10 Canadians surveyed (81 percent) in 2013 oppose animal testing for any purpose. Polling in other major cosmetics markets by HSI and our #BeCrueltyFree partners reveals similar majority support for nationwide bans on the testing of cosmetics and their ingredients on animals.\n\nIn laboratories across Canada, animals are suffering and dying in toxicity tests for chemicals that could make their way into mascara, lipstick and other cosmetics. Terrified rabbits have chemicals dripped in their eyes, mice have substances forced down their throat, and guinea pigs endure having ingredients smeared on their bare, shaved skin.\n\nTroy Seidle, HSI’s Senior Director, Research & Toxicology, said: “Animal testing for cosmetics is quite literally a dying practice. More and more countries around the world are banning it because it’s cruel, unreliable and completely unnecessary. Thirty-seven countries including the European Union – the largest cosmetics market – have banned cosmetic animal testing. It’s time that Canada caught up and ended cosmetics cruelty, too.”\n\nThe #BeCrueltyFree campaign led by HSI and its partners has been a key force in securing many of the national bans in place today. Laws currently exist to end or limit cosmetic animal testing and/or sales in the 28 member countries of the European Union, India, Israel, New Zealand, Norway, South Korea, Switzerland, Taiwan, Turkey and Guatemala. Similar legislation is pending in Australia, Brazil, Chile, the United States, and other countries.\n\nMedia Contact: Christopher Paré Office: 514 395-2914 x 206, cpare@hsi.org\n\nInitiative is part of an official work plan between HSI, the Environment Ministry and National Police to rescue and free illegally held captive wildlife\n\nHumane Society International\n\nAs part of an official work plan to strengthen the capacity of Salvadorian authorities to treat and rehabilitate confiscated wild animals, Humane Society International is providing wildlife management training along with wildlife handling equipment the country’s Ministry of Environment and the National Police.\n\nThe donated equipment includes kennels, snake tongs and bags, nets, gloves and other handling equipment, valued at almost $6,000. Earlier this month, Guatemalan wildlife expert, Dr. Fernando Martinez, provided training to Salvadorian authorities on animal handling techniques and equipment use, on behalf of HSI.\n\nAndrea Borel, executive director of HSI/Latin America, said: “We are proud of the work with the Ministry of the Environment and the Environment Police to protect El Salvador’s wildlife. This training and specialized equipment will allow rescuers to humanely handle wild animals who have been illegally captured, so that we can get them the proper treatment and rehabilitation, and return them to the wild where they belong.”\n\nBecome a Wildlife Defender.\n\nTraffickers typically capture wildlife, especially armadillos and iguanas, to sell their body parts for food. Traffickers also trade macaws, parrots, parakeets, toucans, monkeys and falcons/hawks in the exotic pet trade or for illegal exhibition in hotels and restaurants that cater to tourists. Rescuers typically find iguanas suffering from severe dehydration and malnutrition and with their legs tied to make them easier to handle when being sold. Birds and mammals face a similar situation, though captors often stuff them in small, dirty cages or boxes for transport. Smugglers prefer to sell birds as babies, with most birds dying during the selling and extraction process.\n\nBetween August and September of this year, the Ministry, the Environment Police and HSI jointly organized six operations to confiscate illegally attained wildlife. The operations resulted in the rescue of 70 animals, including deer, monkeys, raccoons, turtles, snakes, birds and a coyote. The animals are now safe and undergoing rehabilitation to be later released in their habitats.\n\nMedia Contact: Raul Arce-Contreras, rcontreras@humanesociety.org\n\nHumane Society International\n\nKraft Heinz has committed to sourcing exclusively cage-free eggs in its entire supply chain in Latin America. This policy follows discussions with HSI and other animal protection organizations. The company, which produces mayonnaise and salad dressings that contain egg, will conclude the transition to cage-free eggs by 2025.\n\nElissa Lane, deputy director of HSI Farm Animals, stated: “We applaud Kraft Heinz for its commitment to improving animal welfare in its supply chain in Latin America by eliminating its procurement of eggs produced by hens confined in controversial battery cages. Consumers care about the treatment animals receive in food production, and we’re proud of the work we’re doing with industry leaders in Latin America and globally to meet the growing demand for higher welfare products and generate transformational change in the global egg industry.”\n\nIn Latin America, the majority of egg-laying hens are confined in wire battery cages. The cages are so small that the hens can barely move or stretch their wings. Each battery cage confines five to 10 egg-laying hens and each animal has less space than a letter-sized piece of paper on which to spend her whole life. Hens confined in battery cages are unable to express important natural behaviors, including nesting, dustbathing, and perching. Cage-free systems generally offer hens higher levels of animal welfare than battery cage systems.\n\nKraft Heinz joins other multinational companies that have committed to using exclusively cage-free eggs in the country and throughout the region, including Unilever, Grupo Bimbo, Compass Group, Sodexo, Subway, McDonald’s, Burger King, and Alsea (Archies y Dominos).\n\nHumane Society International\n\nHumane Society International welcomes the introduction of a bill revising Korea’s Act on the Registration and Evaluation, etc. of Chemical Substances (K-REACH) by National Assembly member Ms.Jeong-ae Han, with support from nine other assembly members.\n\nSince coming into effect in 2015, the K-REACH has led to a disturbing increase in animal testing, including the needless repetition of more than 100 tests, contrary to the law’s intent that companies negotiate to share existing test data to minimize costs and animal use. Some companies are even investing in expanding animal testing capacity in anticipation of potential contracts for data production.\n\nKey among the proposed changes include:\n\n1. Elevation of ‘promotion of development and use of alternatives to vertebrate animal testing’ to a core objective of the K-REACH law (Article 1)\n\n2. Stronger provisions for use and sharing of existing test data and avoidance of duplication (Article 17)\n\n3. The requirement that animal testing be undertaken only as a last resort, after all alternative options are exhausted (Article 37-2)\n\nThe bill’s sponsor, Ms. Han, said, “Unreasonable use of animals just for human benefit, cannot be justified especially while alternatives are available. As included in the revised bill, providing alternative methods replacing animal use will advance 21st century science technology for the better future for the public and environment.”\n\nBecome a Lab Animal Defender.\n\nIn Korea, the number of animals used in testing increased by more than 55 percent since 2012 to an unprecedented 2.87 million animals in 2016. And some stakeholders seem to view K-REACH as an opportunity to create animal testing business for Korean GLP testing facilities, contrary to the law’s clear data sharing mandate.\n\nHSI Policy Advisor Borami Seo said, “K-REACH was established to protect humans. This should not lead to unimaginable suffering of animals. The revised bill clearly states the principle of considering animal testing only as a last resort. With this bill, countless thousands of animals could be saved.”\n\nThe K-REACH amendments under consideration in the assembly were developed in consultation with HSI toxicology experts, who have been at the forefront of advocating for animal testing alternatives and data sharing under chemical laws in the European Union, United States, Australia and elsewhere. HSI has been working for the past two years to promote #ScienceWithoutSuffering in Korea, hosting numerous assembly forums including ‘21st Century Science’, ‘Importance of alternatives to animal testing in chemical sector’ and experts’ roundtable to discuss K-REACH revision. HSI has gathered more than 8,900 signatures in support of this goal from Korean politicians, celebrities and members of the public via its online petition at hsi.org/koreascience (Korean).\n\nLink to K-REACH reform bill (Korean).\n\nMedia contact: Borami Seo +(0)2. 6376. 1405, bseo@hsi.org"
