        "text": "WE BELIEVE IN OUR PEOPLE\n\nAt Domino’s, we want to enrich people’s lives and propel them forward. We want all our people – our corporate staff, franchise partners and frontline team members – to share in the challenge to achieve a better slice for everyone.\n\nKey elements for this ambition are:\n\nFun is in our DNA – it makes our people and franchise partners happier.\n\nWe help our people to grow and prosper\n\nWe aim to create unlimited possibilities – to propel our people forward to become the best that they can be\n\nWe cherish the diversity of our workforce and want to offer our employees a working environment where they can be themselves, are treated equally and rewarded fairly\n\nWe do the right thing because it is the right thing to do – this drives our culture and our decision making.\n\nWE PROVIDE WORLD CLASS TRAINING & DEVELOPMENT FOR OUR TEAM MEMBERS\n\nAll Domino’s team members have access to our world-first Path to Excellence training platform, which is a bespoke app that offers a world of personal growth and professional development.\n\nDelivered via a gamified experience, Path to Excellence shows team members how to grow themselves personally and professionally, and grow through the company in a way that is best suited to them.\n\nPath to Excellence features a personalised avatar, virtual awards and an animated map, check out the video below for more information!\n\nWE SUPPORT FREEDOM OF ASSOCIATION AND THE RIGHT TO COLLECTIVE BARGAINING\n\nIn 2018, Domino’s became the first Quick Service Restaurant (QSR) in Australia to introduce Modern Award rates for store staff, including penalty rates – higher than the minimum wage. For corporate staff not under award rates, market-based wages are paid and reviewed regularly to stay in line with the market and CPI increases.\n\nWE ENCOURAGE AND PROTECT WHISTLEBLOWERS\n\nDomino’s is committed to whistleblower protection as outlined in our Whistleblower policy.\n\nWe have a number of processes and resources in place to assess and monitor compliance risk.\n\nOur wage assistance hotline is managed internally and our whistleblower hotline is managed by an external company. Both hotlines are communicated to employees through posters which are permanently placed in all Domino’s stores.\n\nWE SUPPORT EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES AND NON-DISCRIMINATION\n\nDomino’s is proud to be an equal opportunity employer and is committed to eliminating discrimination and fostering inclusion throughout the workforce. Employment at Domino’s is based solely on a person’s merit and professional competence. Domino’s does not discriminate against any employee or applicant because of race, age, religion, gender, sexual orientation, disability, marital status, or any other basis protected by law. Because it’s the differences in who we are, what we’ve experienced, and how we think that makes our business stronger. And more importantly, because it’s the right thing to do.\n\nWE ARE COMMITTED TO GENDER EQUALITY\n\nTarget: By 2030, Domino’s intends to reach gender diversity at the Board, Global Leadership and Country Leadership levels: with at least 40 per cent female representation.\n\nDomino’s is a member of the 30 Percent Club, whose global mission is to reach at least 30 per cent representation of women on all board and C-suites. Domino’s has met and surpassed its target of 30 per cent gender diversity on its Board, and we are working to increase female representation across our leadership teams globally.\n\nAt Domino’s we are committed to bringing people closer, breaking down barriers and connecting through the world’s best bonding food: pizza. To do this, our Company must reflect the communities in which we operate, with employees from all backgrounds.\n\nAs a member of the 30 Percent Club, whose global mission is to reach at least 30 per cent representation of women on all boards and C-suites, Domino’s has met and surpassed its target of 30 per cent gender diversity on its Board. The Company is also working towards increasing female representation across our leadership teams.\n\nIn addition, Domino’s has committed to achieving greater gender equity for the board, global leadership and country/regional leadership, with a target of at least 40 per cent women by 2030, as part of the 40:40 Vision.\n\nWE PROVIDE A SAFE WORKPLACE FOR OUR PEOPLE\n\nAt Domino’s the safety and wellbeing of our team members is our highest priority. It’s something we continually work to improve because you can always be doing more. Our delivery experts are not employed by a third company, they are our very own team members and a part of the Domino’s family. Only Domino’s delivers Domino’s and our team of delivery experts are paid per hour and not per ride or delivery, wear helmets and other personal protective equipment to improve visibility and safety and all team members must complete the appropriate road safety training. A lot of our technology centres around keeping our team members safe, including our GPS Driver Tracker Technology which tracks the speed and location of our drivers with the goal of reducing safety incidents. Protecting our team of thousands of delivery experts on the roads is a commitment we make every day and on every delivery.\n\nPARTNERS FOUNDATION\n\nAt Domino’s, we are focused on being a pillar of support for our team members during times of need. The Partners Foundation is a charitable trust established to assist Domino’s team members in times of personal hardship or misfortune.\n\nBased on the principle of team members helping team members, every team member at Domino’s, from those working instore to those in head office, has the opportunity to donate to the Partners Foundation through their pay each week, with these funds going to support other team members in need.\n\nWE CARE ABOUT OUR COMMUNITIES\n\nThe success of our business greatly depends on the role we play in the communities in which we operate. In times of disaster, we’re there to serve. We are always proud to be the first kitchen to open and the last to close. We know the impact we have and we never take for granted our opportunity to operate our stores and serve communities across our markets. Our purpose is not just to give back to our communities – we want to create shared value through partnerships with not-for-profit organisations. We provide workplace giving and volunteering opportunities to our team members including through our own internal foundations and external charities and fundraisers.\n\nWe want to be the neighbour people love by giving communities more than they thought possible:\n\nOur franchisees are proud members of their community and they have a positive impact in their community, because they are part of the Domino’s family.\n\nWe help the people in our local communities with a fair and equal chance in life.\n\nWe contribute to a sustainable future for the communities where we operate.\n\nWe are always there in desperate times and support those in need.\n\nDomino’s operates stores in every Australian state and territory, from the big cities to the small towns. We are a truly national Australian company, and through our franchisees and team members we believe in giving where we can, particularly when communities or individuals are doing it tough.\n\nHere are some of the ways Domino’s is committed to giving back.\n\nMINDS & MEALS\n\nAt Domino’s, we’re about more than just pizza. We’re about bringing people closer and supporting those within our local community by delivering fresh hope in times of crisis.\n\nEstablished in 2024, Domino’s registered charity Minds & Meals was launched following a rebrand from ‘Give for Good’, Domino’s previous registered charity (established in 2016). Minds & Meals aligns closely with Domino’s commitment to giving back to the communities in which we operate by supporting youth mental health through a national partnership with headspace in Australia and Youthline in New Zealand, as well as disaster relief – important causes that are close to the hearts of our people and our customers.\n\nThrough Minds & Meals, we aim to help headspace deliver up to 300,000 digital support sessions to improve the mental wellbeing of young people by 2024, and help Youthline counsellors respond to more than 1,500 text messages from young people who reach out for help by 2027.\n\nTo find out more about Minds & Meals, please visit https://www.dominosmindsandmeals.org/\n\nWe’re proud to say that Domino’s registered charity has been recognised through the following award programs:\n\nCorporate Philanthropist of the Year (sponsored by The Public Trustee of Queensland) by the Queensland Community Foundation. Domino's was recognised for the Company’s ‘Round Up for Charity’ initiative, which allows customers to round up their pizza order to the nearest dollar to support the Company’s registered charity, Minds & Meals and its partners.\n\nHighly commended for Best Launch or Refresh (by an Employer) in the Workplace Giving Australia 2022 Awards.\n\nCorporate Volunteering Program at the 2023 Queensland Corporate Volunteering Awards.\n\nFEED THE KNEAD\n\nDomino’s is committed to supporting the local communities in which our stores operate, which is why our community based ‘Feed the Knead’ program is available right across Australia.\n\nLaunched in late 2020, Feed the Knead is run by local Domino’s stores, and provides support in the form of free pizza to those who are doing it tough, ensuring they have one less thing to worry about – a safe, hot meal.\n\nIf you’d like to learn more about Feed the Knead, or nominate an individual, business or charity in ‘knead’, visit: https://www.dominos.com.au/feed-the-knead\n\nDOUGHRAISERS\n\nAt Domino’s, we are passionate about doing the right thing because it’s the right thing to do. Many of our stores across Australia show their support for community causes by hosting ‘Doughraisers’ – Domino’s version of a fundraiser for local charities, community groups, sporting clubs, hospitals, individuals/families in need, and more. Thanks to the generosity of Domino’s franchisees, a certain amount from every pizza sold during a Doughraiser is donated to this local cause.\n\nIf you, or someone you know would like to organise a Doughraiser, reach out to your local Domino’s store. To find your nearest store, please visit: https://www.dominos.com.au/store-finder.\n\nDOMINO'S FOR GOOD DAY\n\nHeld annually on World Pizza Day (9 February), Domino’s for Good Day sees Domino's and its Franchise Partners come together for a good cause, donating $1 from every pizza sold to our registered charity Minds & Meals – which supports youth mental health through a national partnership with headspace in Australia and Youthline in New Zealand, as well as disaster relief through delivering hot meals and much-needed funds to those who need it most.\n\nWE ARE SERIOUS ABOUT OUR FOOD\n\nWhat people put in their bodies matters. Our customers tell us they appreciate our food because it is a treat, an indulgence with which they celebrate milestones, connect with family and friends, and reward themselves. We want to ensure that our food remains an indulgence, but we also believe rich flavours need not come at the expense of health or quality. Together with our suppliers and business partners we are working hard to implement more sustainable production methods, eliminate human rights abuses and improve animal welfare standards in our value chain.\n\nOur food should make our people proud because it is:\n\n100% authentic, non-artificial, quality food that tastes really good - as judged by our customers. All ingredients are 100% free of artificial additives – from dough to topping.\n\nFood without regret – an indulgent choice: we aspire to provide good, nutritious food for our customers, our people and the environment. Our food is an indulgence, but we believe that this does not need to come at the expense of health or quality.\n\nEthically and sustainably sourced: we ensure that our products are sourced in a socially responsible and environmentally sustainably way through active, long-term relationships with our business partners. By jointly addressing risks and fostering innovation in our value chain, we ensure that all workers and animals are treated ethically, and all ingredients are grown sustainably.\n\nOur food standards are world class: every team member in each market understands and operates according to our food safety standards.\n\nWE CARE ABOUT THE SUSTAINABILITY AND QUALITY OF OUR FOOD AND STRIVE FOR THE BEST\n\nDomino’s is on a continuous quest to improve the quality of the food we serve. We believe our products should be true to what our customers expect, using high quality ingredients while delivering excellence taste and value for money.\n\nIn recent years, we have made significant improvements in the fat and sodium content of our products. We also worked hard to reduce the use of artificial colours, flavours and preservatives. We endeavour to avoid the use of palm oil in our food.\n\nWe do not contribute to the depletion of global fishing stocks, instead using farm-grown seafood where possible.\n\nWe are proud of the quality of our products and we are always seeking out opportunities for continuous improvement. We are Hungry to be Better.\n\nBUSINESS PARTNER CODE OF CONDUCT\n\nTrust is important to us. Trust that our customers place in our stores and in our brand every single day, with every single order. It’s this trust that drives us to meet and exceed the highest of standards. To work with only the best food suppliers in the country. Suppliers that we hold to these standards and that deliver only the highest quality products. Trust to hold our own stores to these standards when it comes to food safety responsibility. Providing customers with safe, quality food is not only a priority, but it is paramount to our integrity and to our commitment to bringing people closer. This includes rigorous food auditing and food safety programs.\n\nFOOD SAFETY\n\nWe take our commitment to food safety extremely seriously.\n\nAs part of this, Domino’s has a registered Food Safety Program which is reviewed and certified annually. All stores have Food Safety Supervisors who have passed a fully accredited training program. Domino’s also has a comprehensive approved supplier program, where all suppliers and ingredients are certified to strict food safety standards and accreditations. All stores are required to have 6-week pest control management conducted by external certified pest control technicians.\n\nWE HAVE A STRONG SOCIAL CONSCIENCE REGARDING ANIMAL WELFARE\n\nDomino’s Business Partner Code of Conduct outlines our expectations around labour rights and human rights, but we also have strong expectations of our suppliers when it comes to animal welfare.\n\nWe expect our business partners to ensure that any animals involved in the good or services provided by Domino’s are treated humanely.\n\nThis includes requirements that suppliers:\n\nAvoid the use of animals in experiments that cause suffering or distress and are not essential to humans or animals.\n\nAvoid cruel or inhumane use of animals in any industrial activity.\n\nAvoid supporting cruel or inhumane use of animals in any sporting or entertainment event.\n\nOur current commitments include:\n\nBy 2025, Domino’s will only use cage free eggs.\n\nBy 2026, Domino’s will ensure that 100% of its chicken meets or exceeds the Better Chicken Commitment standards across all stores in Australia and New Zealand.\n\nAs of the 4 September 2023, approximately 27% of the volume of eggs used in Domino’s products across Australia are cage free. In New Zealand, approximately 22% of the volume of eggs used in Domino’s products are cage free.\n\nThe Better Chicken Commitment\n\nIn 2021, Domino’s partnered with Compassion in World Farming and signed the Better Chicken Commitment (BCC) – a first for the Fast-Food Industry across Australia and New Zealand.\n\nThe Better Chicken Commitment aims to significantly improve the conditions in which broiler chickens are raised and slaughtered, including providing environmental enrichment, more space per animal, slower-growing breeds, the presence of perches and natural light, and more respectful slaughter methods by 2026. It lays out strict standards which exceed those currently set by local animal welfare bodies in both Australia and New Zealand including:\n\nAt least 2.7 metres of perch space and one pecking object per 1,000 birds\n\nGood quality bedding in the form of dry litter (at least 50mm deep) in accordance with the BCC criteria\n\nAt least 50 lux of light, including natural light\n\nOne hundred per cent of Domino's suppliers are audited by a third party to ensure they meet the BCC criteria.\n\nDomino’s is proud to be leading the way in this space.\n\nWE ARE MINDFUL OF THE ENVIRONMENT\n\nIn recent years, Domino’s has made significant progress to reduce our environmental footprint by implementing initiatives such as green electricity in our offices and stores, e-delivery, waste reduction and sustainable packaging. We choose equipment and appliances based on energy efficiency and constantly work towards improving energy efficiency in our operations.\n\nWe recognise the science, and urgency, of addressing climate change, and we want be part of the solution by linking our business to Planetary boundaries with an initial focus on climate.\n\nWe will do this by:\n\nReducing our emissions, including our franchisees emissions: starting today and in line with limiting global warming to 1.5°C before 2050.\n\nReducing deforestation to zero in our supply chain before 2025.\n\nRegenerating and protecting natural habitats in lands used to source our ingredients.\n\nReducing our pressure on the watersheds where we operate.\n\nTarget: By 2030, Domino’s intends for the electricity supply to all stores to be carbon neutral.\n\nInitiatives to implement this approach include DOMINO’S BUSINESS PARTNER CODE OF CONDUCT, Supply Agreements, ingredient initiatives and continuous supplier reviews.\n\nOUR SUPPLIERS HAVE WORLD-LEADING ENVIRONMENTAL PRACTICES\n\nDomino’s is proud to work with suppliers who strive for excellence in their environmental practices. Our suppliers are committed to a range of strategies and methods of environmental protection.\n\nExamples of key areas that we focus on include:\n\nSupport for disadvantaged farmers and farming communities\n\nFarmer health and wellness\n\nImproved farming practices that increase yields and efficiencies\n\nSupporting farming research and development.\n\nOUR STORES ARE ENERGY EFFICIENT WITH LIMITED FOOD WASTE\n\nAt Domino’s, we are always looking for opportunities to reduce our energy consumption and choose equipment and appliances based on energy efficiency. This also includes our local stores looking for energy efficiencies through a number of initiatives, including solar power.\n\nTo ensure we are environmentally responsible and also to save costs, we continually work to reduce food wastage in our stores – which, per meal, is typically lower than the average household. We also work with world-class suppliers whose environmental and financial interests are also invested in no, or minimal, food waste.\n\nWE ENCOURAGE THE USE OF E-BIKES\n\nDomino’s uses electronic pushbikes to increase efficiencies in delivery times and reduce impact on the environment. Not only do e-bikes help the environment, they also reduce noise in the area and provide a fun, safe and active way for us to deliver pizza to our customers.\n\nOur electronic pushbikes have been designed and modified for our delivery needs, ensuring our drivers can safely deliver piping hot pizzas while doing our bit for the environment.\n\nOUR PACKAGING IS RECYCLED AND RECYCLABLE\n\nDomino’s strives to reduce as much packaging as possible.\n\nWe report on our packaging levels through the Australian Packaging Covenant Association (APCO), and our pizza boxes are made of 100% recycled cardboard. We also encourage our customers to recycle these boxes in line with local council laws.\n\nWe have fully phased out single-use plastics in Australia, and offer Eco straws for our thickshakes, which are oxo-biodegradable and break down in 18 months, compared to more than 30 years for regular plastic straws.\n\nWe do not use any substances in our packaging such as softeners, semicarbazide, epoxidised soybean oil or migrated mineral oils, and no glass packaging is allowed in our stores.\n\nWE CHERISH OUR CUSTOMERS\n\nThe definition of ‘good food’ is different for every individual and is based on personal interests, tastes and moments. This is why we strive to offer choices for everyone. Our wide range of pizzas can be altered to suit personal tastes, but we don’t compromise on quality. We know how important convenience is for our customers, and we consider delivery and a great and secure digital experience key to the success of our business. We actively engage with our customers and share our journey of continuous improvement openly and honestly – the milestones we’ve achieved, the barriers we face and how we plan to address them. We also place strong emphasis on responding to customer concerns and continuously improving our service and image.\n\nWe want to surprise and delight the people we serve, creating fans for life:\n\nWe ensure a generous and joyful experience: we want customers for life and what they buy from us should be a treat and provide convenience.\n\nWe ensure inclusive and affordable choices for all customers: everyone should be able to buy the pizza they crave at all our stores worldwide.\n\nWe ensure transparency: customers know what they buy from us, what the ingredients are, where they are sourced, our products’ nutritional value and the environmental footprint, and the sustainability of our product’s packaging.\n\nWe ensure privacy and security is a priority: we are passionate about protecting our customers’ privacy by providing a secure and convenient digital experience.\n\nEach year, we serve more than 1/5th of the households in the communities we serve, representing tens of millions of customers each year. Domino’s recognises that this is a privilege, not a right, and that the choice of our customers is paramount.\n\nWE OFFER AN INFORMED CHOICE\n\nDomino’s is committed to offering customer choice. Our customers recognise our food is an indulgence, but we will always strive to help them make the best choices possible by supplying the best ingredients possible and nutritional information on all our products. This includes providing all relevant information relating to nutritionals, allergens and additives clearly on our website to help customers choose food that fits into their lifestyles.\n\nWe are proud to share detailed kilojoule information on our menu boards, website and marketing materials.\n\nThis includes implementing kilojoule menu labelling across all states and territories. We made this move because it’s the right thing to do and our customers deserve to make informed decisions about their food choices.\n\nOUR MARKETING IS RESPONSIBLE\n\nDomino’s is passionate about ethical marketing practices. We pride ourselves on marketing which is truthful, accurate, balanced and never misleading, unsubstantiated, derogatory, degrading or offensive.\n\nOur advertising is always clearly identifiable as advertising, and not presented as research or other published formats.\n\nDomino’s does not market to children, and this is reflected in our company policy. We do not provide items such as toys or games to appeal to children."
