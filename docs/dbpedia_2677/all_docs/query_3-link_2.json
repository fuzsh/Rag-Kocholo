        "text": "Main Text\n\nBy allowing the simultaneous identification of thousands of DNA variants at once, next-generation sequencing (NGS) has revolutionized the way human genetic diseases are investigated and diagnosed. Thanks to NGS and dedicated bioinformatics pipelines, both research and molecular diagnosis can be performed in a truly unsupervised way, by assessing thousands of DNA variants over entire genomes. However, this wealth of information is also a confounding factor when single events determining monogenic conditions are sought. Specifically, in Mendelian diseases, only one or two pathogenic mutations must be precisely identified among the myriad of innocuous variants that are naturally present in the human genome, roughly reducing NGS-based analyses to the recognition of one true positive (the actual mutation) from many false positives (benign DNA changes). The genome of a single individual typically carries 20,000 exonic variants, including ∼400 good-quality, nonsynonymous, and rare DNA changes.1, 2 In recessive conditions, two of such variants have forcibly to be present in the same gene to cause disease, lowering the number of candidate genes associated with the pathology to only 5–10, genome-wide.1, 3, 4 In contrast, any gene harboring one of these 400 variants in a heterozygous state represents potentially a gene associated with a dominant disorder, making it difficult to identify the cause of this class of genetic conditions ( A). As a consequence, NGS-based studies appear to be almost 10-fold more efficient in detecting genes associated to recessive disorders as compared to dominant ones.5 Prioritization of rare alleles as a function of their pathogenic potential at the heterozygous state represents therefore a crucial problem in solving dominant cases.\n\nSeveral in silico tools have been developed to predict the damaging effect of DNA changes.6, 7 Yet, most of these methods focus on the deleteriousness of such variants on protein structure and/or function, rather than on making a distinction between mutations that are dominant or recessive. Other approaches predict haploinsufficiency of genes in the human genome.8, 9, 10, 11 These methods provide a partial solution to this problem, because dominant variants can produce a phenotype not only by haploinsufficiency, but also by gain-of-function or dominant-negative behavior.12\n\nHere we propose an alternative approach, based on the scoring of features that distinguish genes associated with autosomal dominant (hereafter referred to as AD genes) versus autosomal recessive (referred to as AR genes) disorders, rather than on properties that are specific to a given DNA variant. To this end, we developed a predictive tool, called DOMINO, based on linear discriminant analysis (LDA), trained on a set of genes with known inheritance mode on a series of specific features, and finally validated with an independent group of genes.\n\nWe first collected a list of genes from different sources: hOMIM, a manually curated subset of OMIM13 (275 entries); RetNet, containing all genes involved in retinal degenerations and characterized by a high degree of genetic heterogeneity (99 entries); the Nosology of genetic skeletal diseases,14 listing genes linked to skeletal disorders (193 entries); and finally the full list of newly-discovered genes associated with Mendelian disorders published from 2009 to 2015 in the American Journal of Human Genetics (418 entries). To ensure quality, we manually curated these sources by discarding (1) all genes having both AD and AR inheritance, (2) genes directly linked to cancer, (3) genes carrying mutations that were not reported in the literature in more than one pedigree, and (4) genes associated with non-clinical phenotypes (Supplemental Methods and Table S1). We also removed all non-autosomal loci, as molecular evolution acts differently on autosomal versus X chromosome genes.15 This process resulted in the selection of 985 genes: 291 associated with AD phenotypes, and 694 with AR phenotypes, which were used as the “training set.”\n\nTo provide the highest a priori discrimination power to our tool, we used a wide range of features obtained from various databases and covering most of the attributes that genes can have, including general genetic, evolutionary, interactional, and functional information (Supplemental Methods and Table S2). Of the 700 different gene-specific features that could be extracted initially, 432 resulted to be available for protein-coding genes and allowed reliable scoring. These features were then filtered based on their significant differences between AD and AR genes of the training set, producing in the end 308 usable features.\n\nAn LDA-based algorithm was then chosen to allow machine-learning from the training set of genes, not only because of its recognized performance as a statistical method, but also to ensure the precise identification of the relevant features selected by the final model, allowing potentially to gain information on their biological relevance in the context of AD versus AR genes. To build a robust scoring system and to prevent over-fitting the training data, we devised an iterative process, able to identify the most discriminant features ( B, , , ). We first chose the one feature individually producing the highest area under the curve (AUC) from the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) function. Then, we iteratively tried to remove, replace or add features with specific criteria of acceptance (increase or decrease of the AUC, C). Each time a change was accepted, 10 × 10-fold cross-validation16 was applied to the training set, to generate a “testing set” ( C). We let the algorithm run for 40 iterations and selected as best model the one for which there was an optimal AUC for the training and testing sets ( D). In other words, we selected the least complex model among those displaying similar AUC values. In our case, the best model was the one tested at the 14th iteration, composed of 8 features ( D) and displaying AUCs of 0.912 and 0.908 for the training and testing sets, respectively ( E). Starting from the 15th iteration, we observed a limited improvement of the testing set and a decreased performance for the validation set, clearly indicating over-fitting of the model on the training set, in support of the initial threshold selection. For each gene, in decreasing order of importance, the selected features were: (1) the number of interactions with AD genes of the training set from the combined score of STRING (a database regrouping functional protein association networks from various sources), with a confidence > 500 and a maximum of 8 interactions,17 (2) pRec (probability to be intolerant to homozygous but not heterozygous loss-of-function variants) as extracted from ExAC,18 (3) the number of interactions with AD genes of the training set from the experimental score of STRING, with a confidence > 400 and a maximum of 3 interactions,17 (4) the missense Z score from ExAC (intolerance to missenses),18 (5) the average PhyloP score for mammals across the transcriptional start site (TSS) (+/− 500 bp from the actual site),19 (6) the number of interactions with AD genes of the training set using the text-mining score of STRING, with a confidence > 300 and a maximum of 3 interactors,17 (7) the ratio between the number of donor site variants and synonymous variants present in ExAC,20 (8) a high mRNA half-life (> 10 hr) in mouse embryonic stem cells21 ( F, Figures S1).\n\nAt the end of this process, a score was computed for each gene, based on the LDA model. To facilitate the interpretation of the results by the end user, we transformed this score in a probability value, P(AD), measuring the probability for a gene to carry dominant mutations ( A, and Supplemental Methods), and developed a web-based interface (see Web Resources), enabling the interactive query of candidate genes and the scoring of their AD potential. As expected from the ROC curve ( E), most AD genes from the training set had a high P(AD), displaying the opposite trend when compared to AR genes ( B and 2C). At the maximal informedness point (LDA score = 0.225), computed by the Youden’s J equation (Jmax), the model had a specificity of 84.7% and a sensitivity of 80.4%. Interestingly, genes known to cause deleterious phenotypes by both dominant and recessive mechanisms, which we recovered from the pool of discarded genes from the training set and tested as new candidates, were scored either as AD or AR genes (Table S3). Specifically, out of 78 of such loci, 43 (55.1%) had a LDA score > 0.225, whereas the rest had P(AD)s comparable to those of genes associated with recessive disorders (Figure S2A), indicating the absence of an artifactual bias created by the model.\n\nAs a “validation set,” we used 99 genes with Mendelian mutations (26 AD genes and 73 AR genes) that we extracted from papers published from January 2016 to March 2017 in The American Journal of Human Genetics and in Nature Genetics, to mimic the discovery of newly-reported genes and confirm the absence of a potential bias toward well-studied and annotated genes, composing the bulk of the training set (Table S4). For the validation set, DOMINO predicted AD association with an AUC of 0.920 ( D and 1E) and specificity and sensitivity of 88.5% and 78.1% at Jmax, respectively (Table S4, D and 2E). Specifically, 23 out of the 26 AD genes were correctly identified, confirming the reproducibility of the data obtained with the training set. For the remaining three dominant genes that were not recognized as such, namely: OVOL2 [MIM: 616441], KLHL24 [MIM: 611295], and SAMD9L [MIM: 611170], we noted unconventional mechanisms of pathogenicity. OVOL2 contains variants in the non-coding promoter region that results in a hyperactive promoter,22 while KLHL24 has a start-loss DNA change resulting in the use of a downstream alternative initiation site.23 The mechanisms of pathogenesis for SAMD9L are also rather unusual for a Mendelian condition and are characterized by particular chromosomal rearrangements.24\n\nAD mutations can cause pathological phenotypes via different mechanisms, such as gain-of-function or haploinsufficiency. To examine the effectiveness of DOMINO in these two different cases, we evaluated AD genes from the training set as a function of the type of causative mutations they harbor. We reasoned that genes carrying exclusively pathogenic missenses (N = 107) would mainly cause disease by gain-of-function mechanisms, whereas those containing only truncating variants (N = 40) would be compatible with a haploinsufficient model of pathogenesis (genes carrying both types of variants were excluded, Table S5). Scores for the two groups were not statistically different (Figures S2B and S2C), with average P(AD) values of 0.66 and 0.74, respectively (p = 0.42, by Wilcoxon rank sum test with continuity correction). Therefore, in contrast to current tools, DOMINO’s effectiveness is not affected by the presence of specific mutations that a given gene might harbor, being a true predictor of AD features regardless of their mode of pathogenesis.\n\nThe performance of our model was also assessed by scoring the probability of being dominant for well-known false-positives for rare conditions in genome-wide screens,25 such as genes encoding mucins, taste and olfactory receptors, etc. Out of 436 genes from this set, only 4 had LDA scores higher than Jmax (Table S6, F).\n\nTo assess the behavior of DOMINO on real sets of exome / genome data, we tested it on genotypes from denovo-db, a database of de novo variants identified by NGS,26 from which we extracted data from individuals with intellectual disability (ID) (N = 1,010) or with epilepsy (N = 532). Following a stringent filtering on allelic frequency (not see in ExAC or ESP),20 predicted effect on protein (nonsense, frameshift, missense) or on splicing (disruption of splicing sites), we selected all genes with at least two variants in different individuals (N = 82 for intellectual disabilities and N = 19 for epilepsy, Tables S7 and S8). By virtue of their heterozygous de novo inheritance (i.e., dominant in following generations), their presence in the same gene in more than one person, and of strict filtering procedures, all these DNA changes likely represent pathogenic mutations, and therefore all genes harboring them represent true AD genes detected by real NGS experiments. We then ranked all autosomal genes from the human genome according to their P(AD) and retained those for which P(AD) was ≥ 0.95, i.e., all genes that were predicted to be associated to dominant conditions with high confidence. Subsequently, we assessed the enrichment of genes with P(AD) ≥ 0.95 in these two groups of diseases within all human autosomal genes with P(AD) ≥ 0.95, by a hypergeometric test. We found that genes with at least two de novo variants from both the ID and epilepsy cohorts were significantly enriched for high P(AD) genes, with associated p-values of 1.8 × 10−35 (enrichment score = 18.9) and 9.6 × 10−14 (enrichment score = 43.1), respectively ( ).\n\nRemarkably, for cases with epilepsy, all 15 genes with at least two variants in different individuals and with high P(AD) were already known to be associated with dominant forms of the disease (4 were present in the training set). For ID, 39 out of 51 bona fide genes with high P(AD) were also already associated with AD forms of the diseases and allied conditions in OMIM (11 were present in the training set). Among the 12 remaining genes, three were previously predicted to be linked to this disorder by in silico analyses,27 whereas the other 9 represent excellent intellectual disability candidate genes that we propose for validation by forthcoming studies ( ). In more general terms, genes with high P(AD) genome-wide represent therefore either genes that were already identified to be associated with dominant conditions, or excellent new candidate genes for known or novel AD conditions. For instance, among the top 20 genes with highest P(AD), 10 were previously found to carry mutations for dominant disorders, while the remainder were not associated with any condition and might be considered in the future for disease association with very high confidence ( ).\n\nFinally, we took advantage of the LDA approach, allowing a transparent assessment of the features selected by the model, to gain possible insights on the general properties of AD versus AR genes. Interestingly, STRING components, accounting globally for the 47.5% of the weight of the model, are strong determinants of dominance, implying that organization in networks is seemingly rather important for AD genes/proteins. Moreover, among the many parameters measuring evolutionary pressure and conservation across species, only the PhyloP score at the TSS was retained (11.4% of the weight), while more classical scores, such as for instance the dN/dS ratio,28 appeared to be less relevant and were not included in the final model. Sequence-based features were nonetheless significant and have been retained in DOMINO, accounting for 37.8% of the weight. Their significance seems to be related to the global variation landscape in the human population, as identified in the ExAC project.20 Another intriguing result emerging from the selection of features is the fact that few AD genes have a long mRNA half-life. This finding could possibly be related to the observation that stable transcripts are enriched for mRNA encoding enzymes,21 which are usually associated with AR conditions. Also, our analysis of NGS data from individuals with intellectual disability or epilepsy showed that DOMINO has relevant predictive power for identifying genes that have not yet been studied or not yet found to carry pathogenic mutations.\n\nIn conclusion, DOMINO allows for an efficient prioritization of candidate genes associated with autosomal dominant Mendelian conditions, independently from the mutational events that a given gene might carry. Therefore, it can be used in combination with other predictors focusing on deleteriousness of DNA variants to reduce the number of false positives in mutational screens. In addition, the flexibility and modularity of the machine learning system enables the incorporation, at every update, of new informative features as they might emerge from future studies, making DOMINO a constantly evolving tool with progressively improving performances."
