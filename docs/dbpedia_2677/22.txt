Fun game to practice logical thinking and matching skills.

My son and I had a lot of fun testing this game out to see how it worked. I was very happy with how it turned out. The adorable animals and bright colors make it a fun way to spend time together while also reinforcing several skills. This game really makes them use those logical thinking skills to plan out where they will put their next card. It also works their matching skills as they look for the animals to match the ones on their cards.

There are 6 pages of cards in three colors. Print and laminate the cards. Then play dominos. Instructions are included.

Great for family quality time or for boredom breakers!
