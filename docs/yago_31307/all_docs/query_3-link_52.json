        "text": "Many performers are taught to think of themselves as ”disposable”, and a ”dime a dozen”. This language and mindset can be very taxing on a performer’s self-worth and core confidence. What happens is that coping mechanisms, masking, and competitive mindsets begin to dominate the creative process. Which is not fertile ground for creativity and can be wounding and potentially traumatizing for a vulnerable performer.\n\n​\n\nI hope to inspire a new model for performance practice. Using a base of self-care practices with somatically engaged access to a state of creative flow! I believe we can foster create more conscious empathy within our creative communities. Developing richer landscape for healthy relationships to ourselves, each other, and the creative process itself which I believe leads to more authentic and cathartic art!"
