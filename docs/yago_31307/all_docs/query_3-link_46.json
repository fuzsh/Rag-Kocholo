        "text": "In the Where to Eat: 25 Best series, we’re highlighting our favorite restaurants in cities across the United States. These lists will be updated as restaurants close and open, and as we find new gems to recommend. As always, we pay for all of our meals and do not accept free items.\n\nA.Kitchen\n\nRittenhouse Square | American, French\n\nOn Sunday afternoons at this restaurant, you might find perfect French omelets, plates of chickpea panisse and some of Philadelphia’s best chefs eating lunch on their day off. Across from Rittenhouse Square, this all-day restaurant has been open since 2011, quietly maintaining an essential place in the local dining scene thanks in part to the efforts of the chef, Eli Collins. His longstanding relationships with the region’s farmers are a boon to the menu, reflected in dishes like crispy oyster mushrooms grown in nearby Kennett Square, and chicken liver toast topped with red wine-preserved cherries he picks up from the farmers’ market. Dinner should start with airy gougères and a bottle from one of Philly’s most extensive natural wine lists — try a chilled Chambourcin from the local winery Camuna Cellars. REGAN STEPHENS\n\nWell before the dessert course, when you’re scooping pumpkin tiramisù from the depths of a hollowed-out gourd, you’ll get the feeling that Ambra isn’t a typical fine-dining experience. Despite all the hallmarks of a lofty occasion meal — the seven-course menu, the $300 price tag (which includes a wine or alcohol-free drink pairing, tax and tip) — the Modern Italian boîte run by the chef Chris D’Ambro and his wife, Marina de Oliveira, lacks all stuffiness. From one of just 14 seats — four of which are in the working kitchen — guests are treated to a parade of bites that might include cacio e pepe gougère, and a mosaic of cured fluke with osetra caviar and tart beet granita, served alongside carta di musica — Sardinian crackers, paper-thin and pressed with herbs. REGAN STEPHENS\n\n705 South Fourth Street, Philadelphia; 267-858-9232; ambraphilly.com\n\nAngelo’s Pizzeria\n\nBella Vista | Pizza"
