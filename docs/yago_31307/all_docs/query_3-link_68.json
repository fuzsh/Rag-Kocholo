Told in one 80-minute act by five actors playing multiple roles, “Macbeth x 5” tells the story using a seamless interchange of spoken word and physical movement. ​\n\nOCTOBER 21 - NOVEMBER 19,2017\n\nFridays and Saturdays at 8pm, Sundays at 2pm​\n\n​\n\nTickets: $18-$36​\n\nBuy Tickets online ​\n\nBox office: 310-477-2055​\n\nA Visiting production at The Odyssey Theatre\n\n2055 S. Sepulveda Blvd. LA, CA 90025\n\nThe Joel Asher Studio in association with PlayMakersLA present “Macbeth x 5,” a modern reconstruction of Shakespeare’s politically-charged masterpiece about ambition, retribution, and fate. Told in one 90-minute act by five actors playing multiple roles, “Macbeth by 5” tells the story using a seamless interchange of spoken word and physical movement. “Macbeth x 5” is adapted and directed by Joel Asher (LA Shakespeare’s Taming of the Shrew, Othello, Twelfth Night, Merry Wives), with movement by Marissa Moses (Getty Villa and Broad Stage with Helios Dance Theater). “Macbeth x 5 is a visiting production at West LA’s Odyssey Theatre, opening October 21, 2017.\n\n​\n\nIn Macbeth x 5, ambitious General Macbeth, fresh off a military victory, is confronted by three witches who foretell his rise to power. Together with his wife, Macbeth murders his way to the throne - only to descend into insecurity, paranoia and tyranny.\n\n​\n\nMacbeth x 5 is a 90-minute scaled-down reinterpretation of Shakespeare’s Macbeth, using an intersection of language and movement to illuminate the story.\n\nSays Joel Asher: “Macbeth is a political play, from the original production which catered to King James’ fascination with witches - down through 400 years of ambition and retribution. We have found a physical language that illuminates the subtext and makes it modern. While this production will not imitate current political figures, audiences will find it relevant to the world we’re in now. “\n\nImage and Movement by Marissa Moses. Pictured: Alex Wright, Nate Ruleaux, Rosie Moss\n\n​Award-Winning Design Team:\n\nScenic design for Macbeth x 5 is by John Iocavelli (Emmy Award for Peter Pan w/Cathy Rigby, Los Angeles Drama Critics Award for Career Achievement); lighting design is by Bosco Flanagan (2016 Stage Raw award for Odyssey Theatre / New American Theatre’s Tempest Redux); sound design is by Christopher Moscatiello (composer for AMC’s The Walking Dead, 2015 Stage Raw Award for Sound Design for Rogue Machine’s Penelope) and costume design is by Denise Blasor (2016 Stage Raw Award nomination for Odyssey Theatre / New American Theatre’s Tempest Redux).\n\n​\n\nCast:\n\nStephen Tyler Howell (RII at Boston Court, Disinherit the Wind, Hot 'N' Throbbing with Illyrian Players, Angel: A Nightmare at Crown City Theater) is Macbeth and Alexandra Wright (Rosalind in As You Like It at American Repertory Theater at Harvard, Lady Percy at Shakespeare OC,) is Lady Macbeth. Rounding out the ensemble playing over 20 characters are Chase Cargill (Son of Semele Ensemble’s If You Can Get to Buffalo) Rosie Moss (Lifetime/A&E's miniseries The Rookie, FUGU at West Coast Jewish Theatre) and Nate Ruleaux (The Tempest, Henry IV Part 1 at Shakespeare Orange County).\n\n​\n\nDirector Joel Asher's connection to Shakespeare goes back to the 60s when he acted in Twelfth Night starring Faye Dunaway and As You Like It starring Jane Alexander. He went on to found the New Hampshire Shakespeare Festival and later became Producing Director of the Los Angeles Shakespeare Company directing productions of Taming of the Shrew, Henry IV, Othello and Twelfth Night. As a film actor, he has been in Bard Productions' Merry Wives of Windsor and Othello. Beside Shakespeare, Joel has been a director in Los Angeles for over thirty years, recently at 2Cents' ActOut Festivals directing two originals and at The Fountain Theatre directing The Lady's Not for Burning. Joel has also produced documentaries including his 4-part Actors at Work instructional DVDs and a series of Period Movement for Actors plus a series on Great Acting Teachers and Their Methods.
