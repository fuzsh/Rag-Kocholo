        "text": "I have been professionally working in the Performing Arts for 16+ years with so much baggage to unpack I need a U-haul.\n\nSometimes there comes a time in a person’s life when you wake up and realize “Oh, wow, not everything is my fault!” If you are a person who has had that revelation, I am so very proud of you, keep going, you’re doing great!\n\nThose are some of the things I have learned how to tell myself as I’ve been recognizing, reconciling, and integrating the enormous amount of complex trauma I have from too many years trying to prove myself, change my capacity, hurry up and get better, push through the pain and injury for the sake of the production.\n\nTo tell you that these things are ONLY a problem in the Performing Arts would be a big, fat, lie — these things are a problem in our society’s dominant culture. These things are a bi-product of commodifying and objectifying NATURE. Whether it is our inner nature, the nature of an oppressed community, or natural habitats of plants/animals/indigenous peoples of the world.\n\nI’m giving you a wide scope context because it’s important to understand how we as individual people get to the point of having such an entangled and complexly abusive relationship to the Arts to begin with — I could go even further back to how religion (Christianity) has colonized the body, hearts, and minds of well…much of the planet and that the philosophical principals it’s rooted in raises God above man, and man “above” nature. This is in contrast to how Indigenous spirituality consistently seems to function across time and space. Which is that there is an inter webbing that connects all life and everything has a spiritual essence that we are inter-relational with on multiple planes.\n\nAll that said, I believe in decolonizing basically everything. I also see that effective somatically based trauma therapy is all about learning how to listen, relate non-invasively, and integrate aspects of ourselves that have been hiding or imprisoned in the recesses of our “persona”\n\nSo, what does all this have to do with Hollywood and Commercial work? EVERYTHING.\n\nWhen the work we do is separated from our own inner Nature, we will perpetuate harmful behavior towards ourselves and each other. So much of my time as an educator has been spent teaching students how to bypass or gaslight their own inner experiences. How to pretend they don’t feel unsafe when a group of their peers who talk behind their backs between classes is watching them do something super vulnerable. How to jump through hoops, and put their own needs and discomforts aside so they can make their agent, manager, academic adviser, choreographer, etc. don’t have to register that something they are doing is registering as “too much, too soon, too fast” for the artist. By the way “too much, too soon, too fast” is one of the definitions of what creates a trauma response from the nervous system.\n\nWe do dangerous things all the time. I recognize that. Yet, I have found that the acknowledgment of the real/perceived lack of safety allows a sort of calm to wash over my students in moments when they are feeling activated.\n\nSome teachers or coaches will push a student to go into or past their comfort zone. Yet, because of the power dynamic between students and those in authority positions, I have found it increasingly important to reframe the way I speak to “invite” instead of “push” my students. Their work becomes grounded, sustainable, and spiritually alchemical. It is truly amazing what happens when we allow whatever arises to be present, become relational with where we are at, and move at our own pace from there.\n\nThis is the style of facilitation and guidance I hope to see more and more of in Creative Arts Industries.\n\nI believe this style of being with one another and the creative flow that becomes accessible from there has healing properties “The Industry” would benefit greatly from — and our society from there — because storytelling is impactful. It shapes our subconscious and therefore our lives.\n\nIf this article helped you see a bit of yourself more clearly, I invite you to take a deeper dive into where your curiosity leads from here…\n\nI have personally found that having access to an intersectional exploration of creative, therapeutic, ad spiritually based modalities the most helpful in my own recovery.\n\nI wish you all the best in yours!"
