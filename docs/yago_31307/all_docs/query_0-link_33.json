Thanks to Ryan,  Adam collapses mid-ceremony ... and goes to hell. Sorta kinda -- you'll see what we mean. \n\nMeanwhile, Annie's got another problem on her hands:  Ryan is determined to prove she's not really pregnant (and thus Adam won't feel compelled to not confess to Stuart's murder, freeing Kendall and busting Annie).  Worried she might not be able to actually get pregnant anyway, Annie decides the best thing to do is fake a miscarriage. Real logical thinker, that Annie. But when she's rushed to the ER after a \"fall,\" the prognosis shocks EVERYONE. Annie IS pregnant. But is Adam the daddy -- or is Scott? \n\nðŸ“·  Aidan turns to a blast from his past to help keep him and Kendall hidden. But beware Zendall fans: With Kat (played by One Life to Live's BethAnn Bonner) and Aidan working together, things are about to get much tougher for Zach and Kendall. \n  ðŸ“· When JR discovers his father murdered his Uncle Stuart, he confronts Adam, and for the 9,000th time decides he wants nothing more to do with the Chandler name. Will he actually be able to stick to it this time ...   especially when Zach is turning to him for the truth? Could JR really turn his own father in for murder? Stranger things have happened in this town. \n  ðŸ“· Amanda gets concerned she won't be able to get pregnant right away, so to ensure it's a speedy process, she and David decide to waste no more time and head to an out-of-town in-vitro clinic. But when they hit a speed bump, look for disaster to strike. This all leads up to Amanda making either the dumbest, smartest, or weirdest decision of the year -- we'll leave it up to you to decide. \nðŸ“· While Randi and Frankie are enjoying a romantic evening, Brot and Natalia set up their apartment for a surprise. Unfortunately, a not-so-dead psychopath has a surprise of her own for the couple. You guessed it: Madison is alive and well. And it means nothing but T-R-O-U-B-L-E for the Hubbard family. In fact, because of her, one of the Hubbards is rushed to the hospital this week! \n\nAll this, PLUS: Damon figures out baby Stuart is his; Angie and Jesse grow further apart; and  Liza slaps Zach.  \n   Â \n ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ \n Looks like there may be some really good Zoonyer stuff coming!Â  I really hope there is, we have so little time ðŸ“·Â  How I went from outright hating Joonyer to ignoring him to tolerating him to liking him, but if this one works, I will ablsolutely flove him ðŸ“·Â  Don't know what Liza slapping Zach is all about ðŸ“·\n\n But let's not forget, when all this shit comes to a conclusion, we have to bow to The Rage Monkey in gratitude ðŸ“·",
