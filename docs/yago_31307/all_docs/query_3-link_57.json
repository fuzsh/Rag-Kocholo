Ready for more details? Well, read on ... if you dare. \n\nAfter Emma threatens to spill the beans about Adam killing Stuart if her mommy walks down the aisle, Annie puts the wedding on hold. (We love this kid! But, seriously, line up a therapist -- stat!) Annie breaks the news to Adam that they can't get married until Emma accepts him, so Adam does what a Chandler does best -- takes matters into his own hands. And get ready, because the results are quite surprising. \nðŸ“· Amanda is understandably shocked when David explains the details of his latest crazy deal: if she'll give him another baby, he'll let her move out (remember, he's been threatening to never let her see her son again if she doesn't live with him). \n\nWhich, first of all ... WHAT? Secondly, Amanda is torn, but Jake immediately is against it (for good reason!), as is Liza -- whom David turns to for drawing up the legal contact. Amanda finally gets through to Jake and he relents, assuring her he'll support her through anything. But don't think it's going to be that simple -- just wait until you hear the terms of David's contract! Amanda can't really go through with this ... can she? \nðŸ“· Marissa is appalled when she finds out about her father's plan. She accuses David of using innocent babies as leverage -- and he warns her that it's also the Chandler way, so she needs to be prepared. Meanwhile, JR struggles with another patient's story of how cancer destroyed his marriage. It definitely hits home when JR later finds his wife crying. Uh oh. Is the honeymoon over already? \nðŸ“· Kendall and Aidan are in trouble this week when their hideout is discovered. See, Natalia and Brot are hot on their trail (and for each other, but we'll get to that later) despite Jesse's best efforts to keep them away from the fugitives. Kendall turns to poetry as a means to communicate with Zach, and he is able to warn her that the church isn't safe -- but it's too late; someone is already there. \nðŸ“· Meanwhile, Zach, Erica, and Ryan put their plan into motion and start drugging Adam. Expect an elaborate scheme at the Halloween party that causes Adam to remember the night he killed his brother. Now that he realizes he's to blame, what does this mean for everyone -- especially Annie? \n\nAll this, PLUS: Scott and Annie are trapped; Bailey's ex-boyfriend shows up in Pine Valley; sparks fly between Brot and Natalia ... but quickly defuse; and Liza has a surprising date for the Halloween party.",
