        "text": "On the Thursday, May 2 episode of “All My Children,” The OnLine Network finally revealed what the ABC finale in 2011 left viewers clamoring to know…Who Did JR Shoot? Fans will remember that the character was drunk and aiming his gun at at unknown individual(s) when shots were fired and the show faded to black. Now in 2013, we have our answer and sadly, some of you will not be happy.\n\n“Who were you really out to kill that night? Did you even know? And what would have happened had I not seen you peaking out from the tunnels? Had made my way to get behind you, tried to stop you?” asks David Hayward (Vincent Irizarry), while speaking to a compatose JR Chandler (now played by Ryan Bittle, pictured above) in his hospital room. Viewers were then taken back in time to that very night, which showed David coming upon JR, as he said, before a struggle over the gun ensued and two shots were fired. One of those shots (or both as it isn’t stated) killed Marissa Tasker (played by Sarah Glendening when on ABC), David’s daughter. Ironically, at that same time, Bianca Montgomery (Eden Riegel) was visiting the gravesite of Marissa after leaving her daughter Miranda (Denyse Tontz) to enjoy her first date with Hunter Morrison (Daniel Covin), which was anything but an exciting time. Marissa’s tombstone read: Beloved Daughter, Partner and Friend. Her lifeline read: 4/10/1983 – 9/23/2011 (same day “AMC” last aired on ABC).\n\n“When I saw her lying there, I almost put the gun to my own head. But then I realized that you were still alive, and I did the only thing I could do. [Gun shot] I had no qualms about pleading guilty. I told them I wish I had been a better shot,” David said in reference to the third shot aimed for JR after it became obvious Marissa had been hit. David then sees JR moving his fingers after being in a coma for the last five years. Of course, by episodes end David is ready to choke the life out of JR just before the end credits roll.\n\nIn today’s debut episode of “MORE All My Children,” Irizarry is asked what his character thinks should happen to JR after killing Marissa. “I think he should be drawn and quartered, what do you think? Of course. What else is he gonna say? He wants his revenge. If there’s anything — anybody that he wants revenge with, it’s with JR. He definitely wants revenge, and he also spent five years in jail because he tried to kill JR at that very moment when this happened, at the gunshot. But, unfortunately, Dr. David isn’t as good of an aim as he is a world-renowned cardiologist. He’s not just your general practitioner, by the way. I just want to make sure everybody understands that.”\n\nWhat Did You Think?"
