Granted, it has been awhile since I've watched it, but I am still surprised with what seems a large influx of 'new' characters, lol\n\n(no subject) - (Anonymous)\n\n(no subject) - (Anonymous) Expand\n\n(no subject) - baby_phat_honne Expand\n\n(no subject) - ronderzponderz Expand\n\n(no subject) - krestin Expand\n\n(no subject) - colossusx Expand\n\nMe too.

She playedacompletely diff. character on GL that tormented Grady or was it Cyrus. Cuz chicky chick from Army Wives played Lara in those photos.\n\ni LOVE her\n\n(no subject) - (Anonymous)\n\nWhat's up with the numbers?\n\nThe number of episodes they've been in since the show started.\n\nWhat about Lil A? :(\n\n(no subject) - (Anonymous)\n\nFuck Babe! Hated that bitch when she was with my JR and hated Alexa's smug acting\n\nI would love it if Alexa returned. She's the reason I started watching in the first place (well, I just liked Babe xD) and I quit when Alexa left.\n\nFUUUUUUUUCK GO AWAY MADISON\n\nWhenever I see her I just wanna scream 'Go back to fucking your cousin!'\n\nlol at you both, A+ comments!\n\nno Aiden Turner? i guess i will never watch AMC. not that i ever did but 100% no without the eye candy...\n\nYea he was fired recently. Sorry.\n\nex-tammy is on AMC now? that's news to me.\n\nalso, bummed that beth ehlers isn't making the move but ricky paull goldin is. no harley/gus reunion then :(\n\nYeah she is. And apparently, she's getting a contract and going to LA.\n\nas much as i LOVE david canary.. him moving to the west coast completely ruins the storyline i had in my head to write him off.. :(\n\non another note.. yay for all the hubbards moving!\n\nLOL all he's doing is probably moving back after the last yr he left when he was axed on Y&R. God he has a stupid ass s/l on there.\n\ndavid canary was on Y&R?\n\n(no subject) - baby_phat_honne Expand\n\n(no subject) - baby_phat_honne Expand\n\n(no subject) - goddess4eva17 Expand\n\n(no subject) - amelia_heinle Expand\n\n(no subject) - colossusx Expand\n\nLucci is commuting - she doesn't want a permanent move out to LA. I think her daughter even moved to NYC to be closer to her mom a few yrs back.\n\nI can't wait to see how much fail this show is but YAY for no more MacBETH and Brianne Mongrief!\n\nF to the uck! I wish all of this soap drama had gone down before GL was cancelled because GL could have gotten back so many of its old cast members! Beth Ehlers has been fired from AMC, Jerry ver Dorn was bumped down to recurring on OLTL, and Rick Hearst was showless for a while before he signed with B&B. That's Harley, Ross, and Alan-Michael pretty much ready for a comeback. And since Vincent Irizzary is going to be commuting, he could have decided at the end of his contract that the commute was too much and also gone back to GL as Nick.\n\nSo much lost potential. So many wasted opportunities. DAMN YOU, CBS!\n\nsusan lucci is old as fuck.\n\nNo more Zendall?\n\nA+ use of a Brooke gif."
