She is an expert in events and nothing will get in the way of making your vision become reality.\n\nGereld & Eloisa Angeles Chef & Catering Manager\n\nUsing fresh, high quality ingredients, Executive Chef/Co-Owner Gereld Angeles personally works his magic into bringing your menu to life. Chef Gereld's culinary career began in his parent's kitchen at age thirteen creating dishes with what he found inside the fridge. There, he worked his way up starting as a dish washer at a country club in Palo Alto to prep cook then landing a position as a sous chef. He was given the chance to attend culinary classes at the Culinary Institute of America. After completing his certifications and teaching at CIA, he relocated to Southern California. His move to Los Angeles landed him an opportunity to work for Warner Brothers, cooking for Salma Hayek, Friends Cast and many more. This experience ingrained in him a demand for high quality ingredients and discerning eye for presentation. Following his dreams, he then landed his position as Executive Chef at Saratoga Retirement Community. His extensive background and experience allowed him to leave his career in 2016 to pursue his passion of being a chef/entrepreneur to open Modern Fine Catering alongside his wife, Eloisa.\n\nRoberto Grounds Keeper\n\nRoberto and his team take meticulous care of our grounds year round, making sure the property is looking its best at all times. Its all the details that make each event and wedding come to life. Roberto plays a large role in making this happen."
