        "text": "The T. S. Eliot Prize, the prestigious literary prize that honors new poetry collections in the UK, has announced its shortlist of 10 books.\n\nJudges Jean Sprackland, Hannah Lowe and Roger Robinson determined the shortlist from a record submission pool of 201 books; each of the poets on the shortlist will receive £1,500 and the winner will receive £25,000. The winner will be announced on January 16, 2023.\n\nSprackland, the chair of the judging committee, called the shortlisted books “shapeshifting” in their approach to language:\n\nThe ten shortlisted books are unflinching in their explorations of love and grief, brutality and desire. They are alive with insects and angels, psychedelic plants and deep-sea fish; and haunted by the ghosts of Caravaggio and Daniel O’Connell. The English of these books is supple and shapeshifting, inflected with Yoruba, Newry street dialect, and the rhythms of Caribbean speech. These are books that thrilled, surprised, and struck us to the heart.\n\nHere are the shortlisted books:\n\nVictoria Adukwei Bulley, Quiet (Faber & Faber)\n\nFiona Benson, Ephemeron (Cape Poetry)\n\nJemma Borg, Wilder (Pavilion Poetry/Liverpool University Press)\n\nPhilip Gross, The Thirteenth Angel (Bloodaxe Books)\n\nAnthony Joseph, Sonnets for Albert (Bloomsbury Poetry)\n\nZaffar Kunial, England’s Green (Faber & Faber)\n\nMark Pajak, Slide (Cape Poetry)\n\nJames Conor Patterson, bandit country (Picador Poetry)\n\nDenise Saul, The Room Between Us (Pavilion Poetry/Liverpool University Press)\n\nYomi Ṣode, Manorism (Penguin Poetry)\n\nCongratulations to the shortlisted poets!"
