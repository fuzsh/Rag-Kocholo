Considered one of the 20th century's major poets, he is a central figure in English-language Modernist poetry.\nEliot first attracted widespread attention for his poem \"The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock\" in 1915, which, at the time of its publication, was considered outlandish. It was followed by The Waste Land (1922), \"The Hollow Men\" (1925), \"Ash Wednesday\" (1930), and Four Quartets (1943). He was also known for seven plays, particularly Murder in the Cathedral (1935) and The Cocktail Party (1949). He was awarded the 1948 Nobel Prize in Literature, \"for his outstanding, pioneer contribution to present-day poetry\".\nContents:\nThe Hollow Men\nThe Waste Land  \nThe Love Song of J.
