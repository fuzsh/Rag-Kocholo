        "text": "On Thursday, October 13, the Swedish Academy announced the 2016 Nobel Prize in Literature is awarded to Bob Dylan, poet, political activist, and singer-songwriter, for “having created new poetic expressions within the great American song tradition.” This is the first time this honor has gone to a musician. He joins the company of T.S. Eliot, Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Samuel Beckett and Toni Morrison, who have also received this honor.\n\nIn 2006 Dylan was profiled by American Masters, a production of WNET at Thirteen, with the Martin Scorsese documentary, Bob Dylan: No Direction Home. The film documents the Dylan’s life and music from 1961-66, with Dylan detailing the journey from his hometown of Hibbing, Minnesota, to Greenwich Village, New York, where he became the center of a musical and cultural upheaval, the effects of which are still felt today.\n\nBob Dylan receives the esteemed Nobel Prize for his poeticism in the same year he turned 75. On the occasion of his 75th birthday on May 24, American Masters compiled favorite lyrics and quotes from Dylan.\n\nYou can read some of his prose about growing up in the Midwest and his early gigs in New York City in this excerpt from Dylan’s autobiography, Chronicles: Volume One.\n\nCongratulations, Bob Dylan!"
