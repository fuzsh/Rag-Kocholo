Hamlet famously reminds us:

There are more things in Heaven and Earth, Horatio,

Than are dreamt of in our Philosophy.

Nobel Prize winning Poet T. S. Eliot had never forgotten. Drawing on Judeo-Christian, Buddhist, and Hindu imagery, his Four Quartets is a beautiful exploration of the spirit, a blazing journey into time and eternity and the heart of creation written by one of our finest poets at the height of his powers.

T. S. Eliot was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature. Come see why.

Journey with us into the heart of creation.

This Event is a recording of an Athenaeum Original, Four Quartets by T. S. Eliot, presented live onstage in Athenaeum Centerâ€™s Studio A Theater from October 13 through October 29, 2023. Run Time: 82 minutes.
