A 1967 Gibson Flying V played extensively by Albert King is going up for auction.

The first guitar of King's to ever come up for auction, the Flying V was the blues guitar legend's go-to instrument both onstage and in the studio from 1967-1972. Consequently, the guitar powered some of King's best-known recordings, such as “Born Under a Bad Sign” and “I’ll Play the Blues for You.”

Inscribed with the words “Love / you / Albert King,” the guitar was gifted to King by Gibson after his first Flying V, "Lucy," was lost. It is said to be the Flying V that inspired none other than Jimi Hendrix – after he watched King give a particularly ferocious performance – to purchase a V of his own.

King's Flying V will go under the hammer as part of Julien's Auctions' Icons & Idols Trilogy: Rock ’N’ Roll auction, which is scheduled to take place on December 1 and 2.

It's expected to fetch between $300,000 – $500,000.
