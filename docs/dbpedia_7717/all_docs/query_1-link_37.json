        "text": "Can you name five famous left handed guitarists? I’ll bet that you probably can – but I’ll also wager that after five or so you would start to struggle!\n\nTo help out, here’s a list of some of the greatest left handed guitar players both past and present.\n\nThere are plenty of famous musicians in this list that everyone should be aware of, but I’ve also included a few newer, perhaps lesser-known artists who you might also like to check out.\n\nAlthough we are the minority in the guitar world, we sure do have some highly influential players within our ranks.\n\nMake no mistake, many of these southpaw players are considered some of the greatest musicians of all time!\n\nFamous Left Handed Guitarists\n\nYou won’t find any right handed guitar players here, although you might discover a few right handed musicians who for one reason or another ended up playing a lefty axe!\n\n1. Jimi Hendrix\n\nNever mind famous left handed guitarists, Jimi Hendrix is arguably the most celebrated and influential guitarist of all time!\n\nHaving his name amongst our ranks almost single-handedly makes it cool to be a southpaw.\n\nHe was best known for wielding Fender Stratocasters. Instead of playing a left handed Fender guitar, he would restring a right handed guitar upside down.\n\nLearn some incredible trivia and dive into his musical genius by reading my Jimi Hendrix Facts article.\n\n2. Tony Iommi\n\nBlack Sabbath’s Tony Iommi is widely regarded as being the pioneer of heavy metal and is undeniably one of the biggest names in rock guitar.\n\nTony lost two of his fret-hand fingertips in a workplace accident but carried on as a left handed guitarist thanks to his prosthetic replacements!\n\nHe is best known for playing left handed Gibson SGs, and has released several signature Gibson and Epiphone guitars.\n\n3. Kurt Cobain\n\nKurt Cobain founded Nirvana, the band that defined the grunge movement in the 90s.\n\nNirvana became one of the biggest names in music and to date has sold over 75 million albums worldwide.\n\nTwo of his guitars hold the number one and number two positions in the list of the most expensive guitars ever sold at auction. A true testament to the importance of this man to music history!\n\nCobain was generally best known for playing Fender Mustangs and Jaguars.\n\nFender has released several signature Cobain Jaguars, Mustangs, and Jag-Stangs, all of which are available left handed.\n\nLearn some incredible trivia and dive into his musical genius by reading my Kurt Cobain Facts article.\n\n4. Paul McCartney\n\nTwo words – ‘the Beatles’. Enough said?\n\nAs a member of the Beatles and also as a very successful solo artist, Paul McCartney has sold over 100 million albums worldwide.\n\nAfter his almost endless contributions to the world of music, he was awarded a Knighthood in 1997.\n\nPaul is probably most widely known for playing his Hofner 500/1 violin bass which you can see in the video above.\n\n5. Elliot Easton\n\nElliot Easton was the lead guitarist in the American rock band The Cars.\n\nHe is probably best known for his Pelham Blue Gibson SG model, but he also released a signature Gibson Tikibird Firebird guitar.\n\nAside from his signature Gibsons, he also owns one of the most impressive lefty guitar collections you are ever likely to see!\n\n6.

Eric Gales\n\nEric Gales is an American blues-rock guitar player. Aside from releasing several of his own successful solo albums, he is also a highly sought-after session musician.\n\nHe is a little different from most lefty guitar players in that he plays a right handed guitar upside down, without reversing the strings!\n\nEric has a range of signature Magneto guitars, one of which you can see him rocking above!\n\n9. Dick Dale\n\nAfter pioneering the style of music known as surf guitar, Dick Dale was crowned the King of the genre.\n\nDale also worked closely with Fender’s amplifier division and helped to push the boundaries of amp design. This collaboration resulted in the production of the world’s first-ever 100-watt model.\n\nHe was most associated with playing Fender Stratocasters and even had his own signature model.\n\nDick sadly passed away in March 2019 at the age of 81.\n\n10. Otis Rush\n\nOtis Rush is perhaps the most intense, and soulful bluesman of his era.\n\nUnlike most southpaw players, Otis plays guitar with the string order reversed, i.e. he has the low E on the bottom.\n\nAs a result, you will most likely spot him in videos playing right handed guitars upside down.\n\nHe is arguably best known for playing Gibson ES 335 guitars. And what a voice!\n\n11.

Mdou Moctar\n\nMdou Moctar is a Nigerien musician who plays rock music influenced by the desert blues.\n\nHe is frequently referred to as the ‘Jimi Hendrix of the Sahara’.\n\nMdou is known for playing Fender Stratocasters, but his first instrument was actually a DIY guitar fashioned from a slab of wood and a bicycle cable!\n\n22.

Michael Angelo Batio\n\nShred guitarist Michael Angelo Batio is a right-handed player. However, he does play his double and quad-neck guitars left handed, so we can include him here, right?\n\nMAB is best known for being the guitarist in the 80s glam-metal band Nitro, his numerous shred guitar instructional DVDs, plus his insane multi-neck guitars!\n\n27.
