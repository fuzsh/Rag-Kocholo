Reply to your question is because (a) it's a copy of a Gibson, (B) because I couldn't find an answer to the question anywhere, and Â© it's always nice to get in touch with other guitar fans across the world.\n\nTo Twiz - not sure if it's me, but I couldn't see any link/picture etc on your post. Great sideburns by the way.\n\nThanks guys\n\nNath\n\nit turned my b and my c into a smiley and a copyright symbol instead of the follow on from point (a)!\n\nAs you can tell, I'm new to all this kind of forum stuff!"
