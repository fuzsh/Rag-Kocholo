        "text": "About Gibson Flying-V Guitars\n\nGibson Flying-V guitars are an all-time classic electric. Just by looking at their super-cool angular shape, you know they're ready to rock! And that's no accident, as it was first introduced in 1958 as part of Gibson's futuristic \"Modernistic\" line of guitars - it was born to break the mould.\n\nThat said, the Flying-V's distinctive V-shaped body was initially met with mixed reactions, but it has since become one of the most recognizable and sought-after guitar designs in the world, being rocked by many influential artists over the years.\n\nThose include titans like Jimi Hendrix, Albert King, and Dave Davies of The Kinks, and modern-day rockers like Lizzy Hale and Synyster Gates. The guitar has also been prominently featured in popular culture, appearing in films like Wayne's World and on album covers for bands like Judas Priest.\n\nOne of the key benefits of the Flying-V is its unique shape, which allows for easy access to the upper frets and a comfortable playing experience. The guitar is also known for its powerful and versatile sound, thanks in part to its dual humbucker pickups. Those pickups originally included the holy-grail PAFs (pattern applied for) humbuckers but have since expanded to feature both vintage and modern voiced models.\n\nWhile the Flying-V initially struggled to find its footing in the market, it has since become a beloved classic and a symbol of rock and roll rebellion. Today, Gibson continues to produce Flying-V guitars in a variety of colours and finishes, ensuring that this iconic instrument will remain a staple in the world of rock music for years to come.\n\nGibson Flying V FAQs\n\nAre Gibson Flying-V guitars any good?\n\nGibson Flying-V guitars are known to be high-quality with massive tones and an iconic design. The V-shaped body allows for comfortable playing and easy access to the upper frets, while the humbucker pickups provide a powerful and versatile sound.\n\nDid Jimi Hendrix ever play a Gibson Flying-V?\n\nJimi Hendrix played a Gibson Flying-V on occasion during his career. One of the most famous instances was his seminal performance at the Isle of Wight festival in 1970, where he played a white Flying-V customised with psychedelic paint.\n\nWhat is the difference between Les Paul and Flying-V?\n\nThe main difference between the Gibson Les Paul and Flying-V guitars is the body shape and overall design. Where the Les Paul is curved and rounded, the Flying-V is angular and sharp. Both have easy access to the upper frets and a powerful, versatile sound."
