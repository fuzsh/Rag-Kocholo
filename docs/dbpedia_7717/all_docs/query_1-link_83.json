Every time I try something other than a Gibson in a V, I end up disappointed in it. The Gibson has the neck and all the specs I just gel with.\n\nYou might want to check the used section of Guitar Center. Everything on there used over $500 is 10% off.\n\nI noticed any V on there for $1500 or less sells FAST. I look on there frequently.\n\nAlso, don't kid yourself.

The second one was a 2017, I just couldn’t gell with it , and I sold it for $900.00 .\n\nI want another V first, then I will try another Explorer..\n\nHowdy-Do, @Mitchell Pearrow;\n\nAs you may recall, last year I bought a regular natural V, and love the thing:\n\nView attachment 138153\n\nI see that one of these 70's V's is in stock at my local shop, in the Natural color version (usually my preference):\n\nView attachment 138154 View attachment 138155\n\nWhat do you (and others of you here) think of the tone of these 70's models? Seems like a very good Priest/ Schenker (UFO-era) tone.\n\nVin, I have a 70's model. I love it and yes as you suspect it's perfect for Priest, Schenker, Scorpions. It actually plays better than my '93 ('67 Reissue) and my '21 Natural, I like the neck over the other two.\n\nFunny thing about logic. Do I buy an authentic '79 or pay a shitload more for a reissue that comes with a piece of paper that sports the name of someone who has mixed reviews?\n\nGibson Custom Shop Artist Collection Kirk Hammett 1979 Flying V Murphy Lab Aged Ebony | Reverb\n\nOne of the Most Important Heavy Metal Guitars of All Time Metallica fans worldwide are familiar with Kirk Hammett’s 1979 Flying V.
