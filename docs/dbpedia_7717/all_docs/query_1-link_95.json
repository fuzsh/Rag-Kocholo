        "text": "Do you know what years it changed hands? From Eric to George? George to Jackie? Jackie to Todd?\n\nI am curious as George apparently gave his original red one to Pete Ham in '69 & got his red Led Paul from Eric in '68...\n\nWondering if George ever had both SG's in his possession at the same time? If Clapton gave him both the Les Paul & the SG at the same time? And/or which one Clapton gave to him first?\n\nGuessing the most likely detail you'd know is what year Todd got it from Jackie- THE guitar deal/steal of all-time!!!\n\nSorry, I'm good with details but not with dates. I do know Todd saw Cream at Madison Square Garden. He was apparently in the front row and was just mesmerized by this guitar, so when Jackie offered to sell it to him he snatched it up. Jackie had been playing it as a lap guitar, and the paint on the back was just basically destroyed. Todd call it \"Sunny\" for the sunburst on the back as well as for Sunshine of Your Love.\n\nI'm not sure but they apparently did the same thing with girlfriends.\n\nI'll have to look. @LaserKen did a long interview with Todd and I believe that guitar came up in conversation, or it might have been the equally long interview that sportscaster Roy Firestone did.\n\nTodd got some crap at the time of selling it, and there was some debate whether or not it was Jackie's to sell. Todd donated 10% of the auction price too Eric's favorite charity. The terms of the auction were that it couldn't be resold, and of course the weasel who bought it did in fact resell it for half a million dollars. I have no idea who owns it now though it might be showing up in Paul Allen's estate auction.\n\nFound this interview with Guitar World magazine:\n\nHow did you come to own Eric Clapton’s psychedelic SG known as the Fool? Did he ever want to buy it back? — Norman Staller\n\nI have the feeling that Eric had given that guitar up, because it went through a number of hands before I got it. I think he gave it to George Harrison, and I’d heard that Paul Kossoff from Free owned it, too. I got it from Jackie Lomax, who was signed to Apple. This was when I was up in Woodstock working with the Band.\n\nThe guitar was in horrible shape at the time. The paint job was all flaked off because they never put a sealer on it. It didn’t have the original tailpiece, the neck was a mess at one point, the headstock snapped off. I did a lot of work on it. I played it for decades, and I owned it until the mid-Nineties. I owed the IRS a lot of money, so I auctioned it off. But I did get to play it onstage with Ringo—with Jack Bruce, we did “Sunshine of Your Love,” which I thought was appropriate.​\n\nSo it was when Todd was recording Stage Fright with The Band in 1970.\n\nThanks!! I remember reading about Todd being blown away by an early Cream show in NYC but I thought it was somewhere smaller than MSG? Small detail anyhow & I certainly could be wrong...\n\nWhile I first came to know the guitar via Clapton & Cream, being a gigantic Todd fan, I've spent most of my life thinking of it in terms of it being Todd's- the iconic \"Todd\" shot, many years of use, countless YouTube videos & the fact that, unlike Clapton, he bothered to get an identical one to replace it & utilizes that icon to this day."
