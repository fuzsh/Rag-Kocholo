        "text": "The guitar has become an icon of the role of popular music in American culture. One direct consequence is the rise in the value of iconic instruments. In this example, ‘iconic’ means: owned and played by someone special. An example would be the white Fender Stratocaster used by Jimi Hendrix at Woodstock to play “The Star-Spangled Banner.” Iconic might also mean that a particular instrument has a special place in history. An example of this would be Scotty Moore’s Gibson ES-295 that was used in the original Sun Studio sessions with Elvis Presley, or Bill Black’s stand-up bass used in the same sessions and now owned by Sir Paul McCartney.\n\nIn simple terms, a new white Fender American Standard Stratocaster with a maple neck/fretboard is readily available at a local music store or on-ine for about the same price: $1,100. A pre-owned version (a few years old) is simply considered ‘used’ and is worth something less than the ‘new’ price ($450 to about $750). At a certain age (more than 10 years), it may begin to rise in value as a ‘Vintage’ instrument. On the other hand, it may not. Few instruments actually get more valuable. A few more tend to hold their used value better than others. In short, it starts to get complicated….\n\nOne thing is clear: The white Fender Stratocaster used by Jimi Hendrix at Woodstock to play “The Star-Spangled Banner” will sell at auction for considerably more than a used white Fender Stratocaster. The instruments played by some of the Guitar Gods of the 1950s, ‘60s, ’70s, ’80s and ’90s have fetched quite large sums at auction and by private sales.\n\nThe following list of instruments is notable in the amount they were sold for. The list is a work-in-progress and mostly reflects auction sales. The dollar amounts are the total cost of the instruments after the auction. They are the sum of the high-bid plus the Buyer’s Premium and any related auction house fees. In the case of Doug Irwin’s Wolf, it also includes a matching amount donated as part of the bid to the seller’s selected charity. Where instruments were sold privately, the sum hasn’t been verified. These amounts reflect and understanding of the guitar community as to what was paid (not much better than a restated rumor).\n\nPlease note the dates of the auctions. They mostly fall within a fairly short period. If you have any other (or better) information than what is shown here, please contact us and let us know.\n\n1973 Doug Irwin ‘Wolf’\n\n$789,500 5/8/2002\n\n$3,200,000 5/31/2017\n\nOriginally bought for $1,500 by Jerry Garcia of the Grateful Dead from Luthier Doug Irwin, the iconic instrument was auctioned to raise money for the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC). The winning bid of over $1.9 million was placed by Brian Halligan, CEO of the software company ‘HubSpot’ and an avid Deadhead. Halligan’s bid was then matched with a $1.6 million donation, raising a total of $3.2 million for the SPLC. The guitar was Garcia’s primary instrument between 1973 and 1979. Jerry Garcia died in 1995 and left both ‘Wolf’ and ‘Tiger’ in his will to Doug Irwin. Nevertheless, Irwin had to sue the Grateful Dead for the instruments. It took until November of 2001 for the lawsuit to be settled. Once ownership was fully established, Irwin then put both up for auction in 2002 with various other bits of Grateful Dead memorabilia at Studio 54 in Manhattan. ‘Wolf’ set a new record as the most expensive electric guitar in in the world (at that time) when it was anonymously bought by philanthropist, musician and filmmaker Daniel Pritzker. He served as caretaker for the next 15 years.\n\n1959 Gibson Les Paul Standard\n\n$1,000,000+/- 2006\n\nThis guitar belonged to Keith Richards. The transaction was a private sale so the number is not confirmed. Purchased and used by Richards before he was famous, the guitar was played during the Rolling Stones’ US tours in 1964. It was also played on their appearance on the Ed Sullivan Show. It was used to record such hits as “Time is on My Side,” “Get Off My Cloud”, “The Last Time,” “Let’s Spend the Night Together” and “Satisfaction.” It was also played by Jimmy Page, Eric Clapton, Peter Green, Paul Kossoff, Joe Walsh, Billy Gibbons, Mark Knopfler, Ace Frehley and Mike Bloomfield. The guitar was reportedly stolen in 1971, either during the recording of Exile on Main St. or taken from London’s Marquee Club after a gig there. It surfaced three years later in the possession of Cosmo Verrico (Heavy Metal Kids), and later by Bernie Marsden (Whitesnake) who sold it to a UK collector in 2004. In 2006, it was said to have been sold to a Swedish collector for more than $1,000,000.\n\n1969 Eric Anthony Zemaitis 12-string\n\n$253,900 6/24/2004\n\nThe instrument was named: “Ivan the Terrible” by Eric Clapton and used on the 1969 Blind Faith album. He then loaned it to George Harrison to record My Sweet Lord. Dave Mason (Traffic) also borrowed it. Mason was seen playing Ivan on stage with Clapton at the Lyceum in London on June 14th, 1970 for the Dr. Spock Concert. Clapton custom ordered the guitar from Zemaitis in the mid ‘60s. It was Clapton who requested the size, the silver inlays, the heart shape sound hole and the four-leaf clover on the headstock. The guitar is not fully original. In Clapton’s own words, “I was involved in a very, very, stormy relationship at the time (Alice Ormsby-Gore). During one of our big rows, I took the guitar and I demolished it. I took it by the neck and I banged it against the wall until there was nothing left. Then about 5 years later I still had the neck, I took it back to Tony and (said to him) “I’ve got to tell you a terrible story, forgive me … I can’t bear to be without it,” and I apologized and made all the excuses I could think of … he was shocked … but he understood. So, he built another body onto the neck. So, this is Mark 2 – the 1st one was destroyed, but the neck is original.”.\n\n1957 Gallotone Champion Acoustic\n\n$244,384 9/14/1999\n\nUnderstood to be John Lennon’s 1st guitar: originally purchased by mail-order for £10 after his mother loaned him 5 pounds and 10 shillings. Lennon played it with his first band: ‘The Black Jacks,’ who later became: ‘The Quarry Men.’ This was the guitar Lennon was playing when the Quarry Men performed at the St. Peter’s Parish Fete in Woolton, Liverpool on July 6th, 1957. As the story goes: Paul McCartney appeared with his Rex guitar and showed Lennon a few chords he didn’t know. The rest is history. The guitar was auctioned with a small brass plaque that Lennon’s Aunt Mimi had mounted on the headstock. It had the advice she once gave to Lennon: “Remember, you’ll never earn your living by it.”. The 3/4 size Gallotone guitar was broken by Lennon sometime in 1958 and left with his Aunt Mimi. On her death, and after repairs, it was given to a local disabled boy and subsequently, when he died, it was passed on to a disabled girl. The provenance was not lost and the guitar was auctioned to secure her future. In the process of authenticating the guitar prior to auction, Sotheby’s called on Rod Davis, one of the original Quarry Men. He remembered that when the band played the gig where Lennon & McCartney met, “John took the skin off the edge of his index finger while playing”. When Davis changed one of the strings on Lennon’s guitar, he noticed a spot of blood inside. Davis advised Sotheby’s to look inside for the spot: it was still there."
