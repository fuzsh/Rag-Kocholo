        "text": "Starting life as YouTube videos for the JTC channel, the Custom Solos grew into a fully fledged series containing some of Guthrie’s very best playing. With fully transcribed solos and extended backing tracks to boot, you’ve got everything you need to explore your own ideas and concepts on the fretboard as well as taking the best bits from Guthrie’s live improvised takes.\n\nIncluded in this release is one video performance, one backing track, and complete tab and notation.\n\nWith dorian sounds taking centre stage, Guthrie navigates an onslaught of dominant changes to perfection with adept musicality and skill. Have you got what it takes to match him?\n\nThe Oracle Volume 2\n\nIntermediate\n\nIt has been said that this man of mystery shuns the public eye due to his displeasure of once being given a Knighthood and lands by the Valyrian King, only to have them stripped from him after a four day bender in which he was overheard to have referred to 'his Grace' as a pompous oaf. Having now, no title, no home and the mother of all hangovers, he re-titled himself 'The Oracle'. In Series 1, The Oracle bust you out of that lick rut....now he will help you Raise Your Game!\n\nView Package"
