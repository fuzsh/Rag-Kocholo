        "text": "Good evening all.\n\nHave a bit of a question, I have to Gibson V's, one has a 500T in the bridge and the other has a Dirty Fingers.\n\nI recently got a Les Paul Studio with the 498T, I was amazed at how well they sounded and since then I've noticed that the V's sound a little thin.\n\nAre there any opinions on how a 498T would sound in the V's, I play SPace Rock/Metal, which has a classic Rock/metal feel, into a Marshall DSL 100, with a MXR GT OD and MXR Super Bad *** Distortion.\n\nI put a \"57 Classic +\" in the bridge on my V and it's pretty great. Does it blow my mind? No. But it sounds like what you'd expect a hot Gibson to - Supposedly the 57+ has extra windings or something. I regret not slamming a raunchy Teisco pickup in there for a more individual sound, though. At the end of the day, it sounds like a hot Gibson, which is pretty great but not exactly fascinating. I agree with whoever also found the original pickups to sound thin ...but I kept the neck - it has a weird quacky quality that's great for blues and surf. Every guitar is different."
