        "text": "About Gibson Flying V Guitars\n\nWhen the iconic Gibson Flying V electric guitar was released in 1958, it was not an instant success. In fact, like its futuristic sibling The Explorer, it was a bit ahead of its time. Intended to modernize Gibson’s standing in the marketplace to compete with the flashier Fender Stratocaster, the Flying V and Explorer models were met with lackluster sales. While the Explorer continued its initial production run until 1963, the Flying V was discontinued after only a year or so. However, by 1967, with popular culture rapidly evolving, and with the dawning of the psychedelia and hard rock movements, Gibson reissued the Flying V with greater success. It has remained in production ever since, including variations like the V2, from the late 70s, and the limited-run Reverse Flying V, released in 2007. You'll find the best selection of new Flying V guitars right here at Musician's Friend.\n\nThe first run of Gibson Flying V’s were constructed with a body of solid korina, or limba wood. It’s an African tonewood similar to mahogany, but lighter in weight and color, with an enhanced midrange. They were loaded with a pair of Gibson’s recently-developed humbucking dual-coil pickups. They had a Tune-O-Matic bridge, with through-the-body strings, rather than the stopbar tailpiece used in later configurations. Early Flying V players include blues and rock virtuoso Lonnie Mack. He bought the seventh V off the production line, and has used it throughout his career. Lefty blues legend Albert King flipped his over and played it upside down, with the low E string on the bottom. He played a collection of V’s over the years, each one named “Lucy,” and was a huge influence on Jimi Hendrix and Eric Clapton, among others. The Kinks helped launch the British Invasion, and guitarist Dave Davies helped popularize the Flying V, which he got for the band’s American tour in 1965.\n\nAfter it was re-released in 1967, the Flying V caught on with guitarists like Leslie West of Mountain, Andy Powell of early-70s rockers Wishbone Ash, and, of course, Jimi Hendrix, who owned three V’s, including the psychedelic one he painted himself. Other rockers who favored the V were brothers Rudolf Schenker (of The Scorpions) and Michael Schenker (of The Scorpions, UFO and MSG), Johnny Winter, Lenny Kravitz and Eddie Van Halen. Aerosmith’s Joe Perry has a Flying V or two in his impressive arsenal, as does Keith Richards of The Rolling Stones, and ZZ Tops’ Billy Gibbons. Of course, Metallica’s Kirk Hammet helped define 80’s heavy metal with Flying V. Today, the Gibson Flying V is still riding high, with models like the Traditional Pro, featuring a mahogany body and neck and loaded with a pair of screaming Zebra humbuckers, or the Heritage Cherry, with ceramic pickups for screaming metal tone. Or check out a signature Kirk Hammett Flying V if you’re looking to Ride the Lightning. Whatever your playing style, the Gibson Flying V will get you there in first class style.\n\nThe Gibson Flying V B-2 is a stealthy V that's ready to shred. Its revolutionary, ready-to-take-off-for-the-moon body shape has always left no doubt that you won't settle for the ordinary. This stealth black version drives home the point. A resonant mahogany body and high-output Dirty Fingers + humbucking pickups combine for screaming tone that only needs your best riffage to complete the picture.\n\nPrevious Gibson Flying V Models\n\nGibson Flying V Traditional Pro\n\nThe sleekest rocker on the planet, revamped and ready to rumble. The Flying V Traditional Pro starts with great tonewoods. In this case, its a bevy of Grade-A mahogany.

Killer looks are assured by a thin nitrocellulose lacquer finish in your choice of Ebony Black or Wine Red, given an added touch of elegance with cream binding around the body and fingerboard, and vintage gold \"top hat\" control knobs. The time-tested dimensions of a 24 3/4\" scale length, a 1 11/16\" nut width, and a 12\" fingerboard radius ensure that legendary Gibson playability, too.\n\nTo truly capture the tonal superiority of the great original Vs of the late '50s, the Flying V Traditional Pro carries a pair of vintage-style humbucking pickups. A '57 Classic in the neck position delivers warm throaty tones with plenty of clarity, and a slightly hotter BurstBucker 3 in the bridge offers searing crunch and soaring lead tones. Two of Gibson USA's most popular humbuckers. Both are installed uncovered with exposed \"zebra coil\" bobbins. These units are made with genuine Alnico II magnets and wound with 42 AWG wire, just like the legendary PAFs of the late '50s and early '60s, and offer a blend of richness and clarity that few pickups can match today. A Tune-o-matic bridge and stopbar tailpiece ensure a solid anchor and optimum sustain, while a set of high-quality TonePros Vintage Kluson button tuners grace the soaring arrow-shaped V headstock. For thundering metal or ripping blues, the Flying V Traditional Pro offers unbeatable tone, and undeniable style.\n\nGibson Faded Flying V\n\nThe faded finish gives it the look of a seasoned performer.

Gibson USA proudly released the Grace Potter Signature Flying V.

Its glued-in Grade-A mahogany neck is carved to a \"Slim V\" profile that measures .800\" at the 1st fret and .850\" at the 12th, and topped with a luxurious dark-brown chechen fingerboard with 22 medium-jumbo frets. A PLEK-slotted Corian nut ensures a maximum amount of that crucial neck resonance arrives in the guitar's final sonic brew, while vintage-style TonePros tuners with pearloid keystone buttons maintain a traditional look at the back-angled headstock. All this along with Gibson's renowned craftsmanship and the classic specs of the 24-3/4\" scale length, a 1-11/16\" nut width, and a 12\" fingerboard radius ensure legendary playability, too.\n\nTo capture the tonal splendor of this well-crafted guitar, Gibson USA loads the Grace Potter Signature Flying V with a pair of its finest PAF recreations. The BurstBucker Pro Rhythm at the neck and BurstBucker Pro Lead at the bridge are both made with Alnico V magnets and wound with 42 AWG enamel-coated wire like many of the best original PAFs. They provide output levels in line with vintage humbuckers, although the bridge pickup is given extra turns of wire for a little more grind in the lead position and an excellent balance between the two. Also, in a contemporary twist, both pickups are wax potted to combat microphonic feedback, so you can crank this sweet, soulful tone monster through your amp of choice, achieving everything from warm, rich, bluesy tones to wailing lead and crunching rhythm, without fear of howl or squeal. The classic pairing of Tune-o-matic bridge and stud-mounted stopbar tailpiece keep it all locked down for maximum sustain and easy intonation adjustment, and a pair of individual volume controls, a master tone, and a three-way switch give you all the sonic versatility required.\n\nGibson Rudolf Schenker Flying V\n\nA distinctive body shape with arena-ready colors and sounds.

The guitar is hand-finished in VOS (Vintage Original Spec) to give the look of a new guitar, some decades old, that has been stored and played very little. The Flying V' shape was a wildly original futuristic shape with heavy, resonant tone that is both iconic in the world of rock and blues today. From its arrowpoint headstock to its dual volume and single tone controls to its vintage tulip tuners and Holly headstock veneer to its V tailpiece, the Flying V is a craft that fully appears to have blasted its way forward from half a century ago."
