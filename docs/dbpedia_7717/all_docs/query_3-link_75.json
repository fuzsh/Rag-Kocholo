It was first introduced in 1958, and in the following decades, it became increasingly popular, especially with hard rock and metal guitarists. For many of them, the 1980s is when the model really hit its stride. The Gibson 80s Flying V is based on the highly sought-after 1984 models. It features a fast-playing SlimTaper™ mahogany neck with a rosewood fretboard. The iconically-shaped mahogany body is outfitted with new 80s Tribute pickups that accurately capture the unique fat-toned sound and rich sustain of the models from that era. Now available in Ebony.\n\nSPECIFICATIONS"
