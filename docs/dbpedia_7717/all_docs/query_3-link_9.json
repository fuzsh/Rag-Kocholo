You probably know the distinctive shape as the guitar of choice for Memphis Music Hall of Fame inductee Albert King, who began playing the V almost immediately after the product launched in 1958.

        "text": "When he got his 1958 Korina V he immediately flipped it over and played it with the low-E string on the bottom, where a conventional player’s high E would be. So, like fellow lefty blues guitar daredevil Otis Rush, King bent downwards instead of the usual upwards direction. Try this on any gauge of string and you’ll see the immediate advantage pulling down rather than pushing up yields in controlling bends — better vibrato, easier string travel, and the ability to bend up or down to a note — or even up two notes — in steps, like King often did.\n\nToday’s low-tuned metal guitar bands also owe a little something to King, even if they’ve never heard his music. King answered the question “how low can you go?” by tuning his thickest string down to C and employing open E-minor tuning (C-B-E-G-B-E) or kicking things up to open F (C-F-C-F-A-D). Credit that to his interest in Hawaiian music, which uses a wide variety of open, so-called “slack key” tunings."
