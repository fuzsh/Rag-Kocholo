I believe this because not only did those two pal around and play together a lot, but also all of Albert's Vs had that area of wear above (below in lefty position) the pickups, caused not by flat picking but by his fingers and sweat! AK also played righty guitars left-handed but never flipped the strings, so this could DEFINITELY be a more kickass picture than initially intended!"
