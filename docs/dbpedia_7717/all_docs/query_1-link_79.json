        "text": "This was Stevieâs main guitar. He got it from the owner of Ray Henningâs Heart of Texas music shop in 1973, and it quickly became his main companion. Number One originally had a white pickguard which was replaced with a black one that now adds the âSRVâ logo, and a right-handed tremolo bar â now gold-plated left-handed.\n\nThe guitar was built using a 1963 Stratocaster body and a 1962 neck, even though Stevie believed it was a 1959 Stratocaster. It is rumoured, although not proved, that he believed it was a 1959 model because he once took the pickups off and realized that they were made in 1959, so he made a conclusion from that. It was not until 1980 that Rene Martinez took the whole guitar apart and saw the year 1963 stamped in the body and 1962 on the neck.\n\nStevieâs Number One is finished in sunburst and itâs original neck has a thick, D-shaped profile with 1-5/8â³ (41mm) nut width. The fingerboard radius was originally 7.25â³ but eventually came down to 10â³. This was a consequence of countless refret jobs done by Rene Martinez, who mostly used Dunlop 6100 fretwire. The headstock was fitted Fender Schaller Elite Gold tuner pegs.\n\nThe neck eventually became damaged beyond repair, so Rene figured out heâd put the neck from Stevieâs 1962 red Stratocaster on it. Unfortunately that neck was broken into pieces at a show in Holmdell, New Jersey, when a piece of stage equipment fell on several of Stevieâs guitars. After that, Number One had a new Fender neck until after Stevie died, when the original Number One neck was re-installed on it.\n\nNumber One is currently in the possession of Jimmy Vaughan.\n\nThis guitar first caught Stevieâs attention around 1979, when he went with couple of friends to a pawnshop in Austin, Texas.\n\nUnfortunately it cost $350, and he couldnât afford it at that time. That didnât stop his wife, Lenora, who talked to a couple of Stevieâs friends to cash in $50 each, so they could give it to him as a birthday present. The plan worked out, and they presented the guitar to Stevie on October 3rd 1980 at Steamboat Springs â nightclub he often played at.\n\nThe guitar was originally a 3-tone sunburst maple-neck model with a rosewood fingerboard. It was refinished by the previous owner with a dark natural color, and it had arty inlay behind the bridge.\n\nStevie decided to replace the neck with the mid-â50s-style maple neck given to him by Billy Gibbons. He kept the tremolo arm, pickups and frets in their original condition, but added his signature and initials on the neck plate and pickguard.\n\nThis guitar also has Mickey Mantleâs autograph on the back of the body, who signed it on April 10, 1985, when Stevie was invited to play the national anthem at the Houston Astros season opener at the Houston Astrodome.\n\nStevie recorded with this guitar on many of his heartfelt love songs, including âRiviera Paradiseâ, and of course â âLennyâ.\n\nThe guitar was put up for auction at the Eric Clapton Crossroads Guitar Festival on June 24, 2004 and it was sold to Guitar Center for $623,500.\n\nThis guitar was previously owned by Vince Martell, Vanilla Fudgeâs lead guitarist, who sold it to Charley Wirz of Charleyâs Guitar Shop in Dallas.\n\nThe previous owner had hollowed out the body to mount four humbuckers but Wirz removed those and installed a new pickguard in which he placed a Fender single-coil pickup in the neck position. He also painted the whole body yellow, and installed Charvel brass tremolo system.\n\nCharley then gave the guitar to Stevie in early 1981, who added SRV decals where the two pickups would normally be placed, just under the strings.\n\nThis was supposedly the guitar Stevie played on the album versions of âHoney Beeâ and âTell Meâ, and live on DVD âLive at Montreuxâ for the last song on the set â âCollins Shuffleâ.\n\nYellow was stolen in 1985 at the Albany International Airport in New York, and has never been recovered. Some sources state that the guitar was later recovered and is now on display in the Las Vegas Hard Rock Cafe, but this is incorrect.\n\nIn late 1983, Vaughan purchased a 1962 sunburst Fender Stratocaster from Charley's Guitar Shop, though he had it repainted by Fender in fiesta red as a custom color option, and simply named the guitar \"Red.\"\n\nThe guitar remained stock until December 1985, when a left-handed neck was installed and \"SRV\" stickers were applied to the pickguard.\n\nIn 1989, the neck on \"Number One\" was unable to withstand more re-fret jobs, replacing it with the original neck from \"Red.\"\n\nThe next year, following a concert at the Garden State Arts Center in Holmdel, New Jersey, a stanchion fell onto Vaughan's rack of guitars, splitting the neck from \"Red\" that was installed on \"Number One.\"\n\nThe neck was replaced in time for the next night's gig.\n\nThis was a custom Stratocaster-style guitar made for Stevie by James Hamilton in Buffalo, NY. It was presented to Vaughan by James as a gift from Billy Gibbons on April 29, 1984.\n\nThis guitar features a 2-piece maple body and a 3-piece \"neck-through body\" design. It also originally had EMG preamped pickups, but Stevie didn't like the pickups in it.\n\nHis next music video was about to be made, which was \"Couldn't Stand the Weather\" and he didn't want to get Number One wet during filming, so he used the Hamiltone for filming.\n\nDuring the recording of this video the pickups were damaged, and soon after replaced with vintage Fender single-coils.\n\nThe EMG pickups and Gibson style amber top hat knobs were changed in June 1984.\n\nScotch is a 1961 Fender Stratocaster used by Vaughan for the last 5 years of his life. He acquired this guitar in the fall of 1985, and it is said to have been bought in either Baltimore or \"The Boathouse\" in Norfolk, Virginia.\n\nIt was to be a prize at one of Stevie's shows, but he liked the guitar so much, he gave away another one of his guitars.\n\nThis guitar has a butterscotch colored finish and originally had a plain white pick guard, which was later replaced with a non-original tiger-striped pickguard made by Rene Martinez, Vaughan's guitar tech.\n\nThe guitar was stock except for the tiger-striped pickguard which resembled the same pickguard Buddy Guy had on his butter-colored guitar at the time.\n\nThe guitar, with the original pickguard can be seen on the front of the Live Alive album cover.\n\nStevie used this guitar when having problems with Number One, or regardless from that â live for songs such as âLeave My Girl Aloneâ and âSuperstitionâ.\n\nStevie was seen playing this guitar around 1977/78, whilst in Triple Threat Revue and also while gigging with Hubert Sumlin, and it was supposedly one of his first guitars.\n\nDuring one of the gigs â which happened to be on Stevieâs birthday, Hubert Sumlin showed up with no guitar after a cabbie drove of with his guitar and amp. Stevie decided to give the Rickenbacker and a Westberry amp to Hubert as a kind of reverse birthday present, though it was stolen soon thereafter.\n\nAmazingly, when Stevie found out the guitar had been stolen from Sumlin, he set out to find it and ended up recovering it. Once he got it back, he personally walked into Antoneâs in Austin and returned it to Sumlin before his gig that same night. No one can say that Stevie wasnât a good friend.\n\n* (info provided by Stevieâs guitar tech Greg Sisk)\n\nStevie used this guitar on MTV Unplugged. This guitar actually belonged to Stevieâs friend and personal assistant Timothy Duckworth. Timothy recalls that Stevieâs hands were so strong that he accidentally cracked the neck.\n\nGuild produced the F412 model in the 1960s as a custom order-only, and it appears around 20 or so were produced during this time frame. These early models have some unique characteristics that differ from the later production version. One of most apparent differences is the tuners extend much higher on the headstock (above the Guild logo), and they are full size Grover tuners.\n\nOther subtle differences include the \"through\" saddle as opposed to the later \"drop-in\" saddle and the older \"G-shield\" logo on the label.\n\nThis guitar was displayed at The Hard Rock Cafe in Dallas until its closing in 2019.\n\nIn April 2023 Heritage Auctions advertised an F-412 guitar, which they have stated was the one Stevie used on his MTV appearance. They stated that the guitar was hired from Studio Instrument Rentals in New York City, which contradicts every other source that the guitar belonged to Timothy Duckworth.\n\nThis guitar was given to Stevie by his brother Jimmy around 1966, after Stevie had found it discarded and in bits, in a cupboard in the family home. Stevie put it back together and after Jimmy had given it to him, he added an extra pickup and changed the tone control into a second volume control. The guitar is inscribed \"Jimbo\" on the back of the body.\n\nThe guitar is actually historically significant for two reasons and even without the fact it was Stevie's, it is worth a lot.\n\nIn 1951 Fender launched a new guitar, called the Broadcaster. It quickly became apparent that there was already a guitar on the market called a Broadcaster, so Fender had to stop using the name. Unfortunately they'd already made a lot of these guitars, so while they were deciding on a new name, these existing ones were sent to guitar stores, without a logo on the headstock. Fender soon decided on the replacement name of Telecaster and went with that.\n\nThe guitars that were shipped without a logo became colloquially known as the \"Nocaster\" and are collectors' items because they were only available for a few months.\n\n\"Jimbo\" is one of those guitars without a logo on the headstock and is therefore a \"Nocaster\"\n\nIn 1971, Stevie traded it for a '63 Epiphone Riviera, but after his rise to fame, he publicly begged for the guitar's return, pledging to pay whatever it took to buy it back, but no one came forward. It wasn't until the mid-2000s that the guitar was recognized for what it was, by a man called Loni Specter, a songwriter, photographer, and head of the Los Angeles Amp Show, who happened to see a session musician playing it.\n\nStevie was first spotted playing the red and white, semi hollow body 1963 Epiphone Riviera live on 14th January, 1971, in the band Pecos. He was later photographed playing this guitar in other early projects, like Blackbird, the Nightcrawlers (where he opened for ELO, KISS, and ZZ Top), and Krackerjack.\n\nBefore Stevie realized his signature fondness for Strats, the Riviera was one of Stevieâs main instruments and remained in his collection long after he stopped playing it regularly. Over the years, it was photographed live in various states with and without the original pickguard. Famously, it popped back up on video over a decade after Stevie first played it in a fiery live version of âHideawayâ with two pickguards â one for the top and one for the bottom.\n\nLeft: An early photo of Stevie and during a concert at the USF Sundome in Tampa, FL on 1st August 1984, where he was opening for Huey Lewis and the News.\n\nThis guitar was purchased by Stevie in 1986, just before the show at the Harriet Island Riverfest on 11th July 1986. He bought it from Pete's Guitars in St Paul, MN. Fender made 4 prototypes for a guitar that they hoped to put into production. According to one source Fender could not get clearance from Hendrix's Estate, so the project was abandoned. However according to Mark Page, who worked for Fender, 25 of these guitars were made as a special run, for sale by guitar dealers in Texas.\n\nStevie's prototype was the second of 4 made. He can be seen using it for \"Superstition\" and \"Willie the Wimp\"at the 1987 Daytona Beach, FL show.\n\nStevieâs Tokai vintage Strat copies are in many ways the oddest entry in this list. Stevie was rumored to play (and was photographed with) multiple Tokais in the â80s. Where this story starts to get interesting is the lack of available information on Stevieâs most famous Tokai: the sunburst, maple neck â50s-style Springy Sound model on the cover of Texas Flood.\n\nOne of the most bizarre aspects of Stevieâs tie-in with the Springy Sound is that Stevie was never known by those close to him to have purchased it or have seriously played it live or in the studio. A popular guess is that Stevie bought the guitar while on tour, as he would often pick up guitars in the towns that he visited.\n\nOutside of the cover, few â if any â photographs of Stevie playing this guitar live (or in private) are known to exist. With that said, there is a \"live\" photo of the Texas Flood guitar in Hopkins' book from 1982, so it appears that he did use it live up until a year before Texas Flood was released.\n\nCraig Hopkins posits that an endorsement deal was being explored at the time, and five Tokai guitars plus a of couple basses were negotiated as a goodwill offering toward Stevie signing with the brand. A signed contract for a Tokai endorsement was found that corroborates Hopkinsâ guess, but the signature and the information provided on the contract (dated 30th December, 1984) appears to be forged, with his wife Lenora â âLennyâ â as the signed witness.\n\nThis potentially falsified contract was likely the basis for the creation of the â85-â86 Tokai catalog and poster that featured Stevie Ray and Tommy Shannon playing Tokai guitars/basses. Stevie was known to have been infuriated by the marketing. Once, when presented with the poster by a fan, Stevie wrote âI PLAY FENDERâ over the Tokai logo.\n\nAnother major complication to Hopkinsâ explanation that the Texas Flood Tokai was a possible endorsement guitar is that the 1984-â85 timing of this deal puts Tokai in the middle of a headstock change for their American-distributed guitars. In fact, a Stevie-owned Tokai that sold at auction for over $20,000 (with COA and photographic proof) was, in fact, a Tokai AST, which featured an altered, non-vintage, Strat-style headstock.\n\nThis guitar that sold also appears to be one of the guitars Stevie is photographed playing in the infamous Tokai poster. All of this together points to the free promotional guitars given to Stevie as being the 1984-introduced ASTs instead of his earlier Springy Sound models.\n\nTo make this Stevie-Tokai situation even weirder, Craig Hopkins has stated that Stevie is also playing a Tokai on the cover of Live at Carnegie Hall. The photographic evidence from Chuck Pulinâs photoshoot that night lends credence to his claims, but the decal is neither conclusively a Tokai or Fender based on the available photographs.\n\n* (info provided by reverb.com)\n\nThis is a rare picture of Stevie using a Fender Bass VI, at the Sam Houston Coliseum on 1st February 1986. He would this guitar for the second guitar solo on CSTW, usually with a slide. He only did that in late 85/early 86. Stevie can be seen picking up this guitar at around 39 minutes in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7fPLT7CL8k\n\nFirst released in 1961, it followed the concept of the Danelectro six-string bass released in 1956, having six strings tuned E to E, an octave below a standard tuned guitar. It was designed to bridge the gap between the playability of a guitar and the low-end power of a bass.\n\nThe VI had an offset body similar to that of the Fender Jazz. However it differed in having six strings, a shorter scale, thinner strings and a mechanical vibrato arm.\n\nThe Bass VI never really caught on and was discontinued in 1975.\n\nThis guitar was designed by Stevie himself. Stevie sketched out the shape and prototype design of the guitar in 1982 and consulted with experts on the technical limitations he'd have to overcome to bring it to life.\n\nBy 1984 Stevie had expressed his interest to design and build a custom guitar, with the possibility to go on and mass produce it. He was assisted by Swedish guitarist Gordon van Ekstrom.\n\nVarious options were discussed, including having the pickups in the shape of Stevieâs initials. Seymour Duncan were approached with this idea, but they said it would not work. The unfinished guitar was used on one song at the Metro Center, Halifax, NS in Canada in April 1988 and then not used again.\n\nStevie was photographed with multiple takes on a single cutaway prototype body in 1984, as well as the double cutaway version in the mid-to-late-â80s."
