        "text": "The Gibson Flying VT is considered an iconic design by modern guitarists. It was first introduced in 1958, and in the following decades, it became increasingly popular, especially with hard rock and metal guitarists. For many of them, the 1980s is when the model really hit its stride. The Gibson 80s Flying V is based on the highly sought-after 1984 models. It features a fast-playing Slim Taperâ„¢ mahogany neck with a rosewood fretboard. The iconically-shaped mahogany body is outfitted with new 80s Tribute pickups that accurately capture the unique fat-toned sound and rich sustain of the models from that era. A hardshell case is also included.\n\nSerial Number: 204730076\n\nWeight: 6.2lbs\n\nSKU: DSVE00EBCH1\n\nSPECS\n\nBody\n\nShape: Flying V\n\nMaterial: Mahogany\n\nTop: N/A\n\nWeight Relief: N/A\n\nBinding: N/A\n\nNeck\n\nNeck: Mahogany\n\nProfile: Slim Taper\n\nNut width: 43.053mm\n\nFingerboard: Indian Rosewood\n\nScale length: 628.65mm\n\nNumber of frets: 22\n\nNut: Graph Tech\n\nInlay: Acrylic Dots\n\nHardware\n\nBridge: Aluminum Nashville Tune-O-Matic\n\nTailpiece: Aluminum Stop Bar\n\nTuners: Grover Rotomatic with Contemporary Buttons\n\nPlating: Chrome\n\nElectronics\n\nNeck pickup: 80s Tribute\n\nBridge pickup: 80s Tribute\n\nControls: 2 Volume, Master Tone; Hand-wired with Orange Drop Capacitors\n\nCase & SKUs"
