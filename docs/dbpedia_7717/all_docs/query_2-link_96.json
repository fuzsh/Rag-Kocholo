        "text": "2nd Edition Details\n\nIt Looks and Sounds Better\n\nThis course was originally produced in 2011, and shot at 720p resolution. All the source footage has been upscaled and enhanced to 4K resolution. The audio has been remastered, and the backing track has been upgraded with better drums, bass, and rhythm guitar parts.\n\nNew Rhythm Lesson\n\nThe 2nd Edition has a companion rhythm lesson teaching the rhythm guitar part heard in the new backing track. This rhythm part is a mix of chorded accents, shuffles, and more.\n\nIt's Easier To Study\n\nThe lessons in this course have been re-edited to utilize our more modern lesson format, including our LRI Format. LRI stands for:\n\nLearn Licks\n\nRepeat Phrases\n\nIntegrate Everything\n\nThe repetition of phrases, and integration of previous choruses is now built right into the lesson videos. After you learn several new licks in a row, you'll be prompted to repeat a phrase that incorporates those licks together, then try to integrate them with the rest of the chorus. No more rewinding, or switching videos to review. It's all baked right into the lessons."
