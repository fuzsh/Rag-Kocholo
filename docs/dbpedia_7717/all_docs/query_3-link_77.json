        "text": "OTOH....\n\nFrivolous lawsuits won't win you any friends, but is it actually frivolous to defend your brand? IMHO, it is obvious that Gibson owns the body shape of the Flying V, Explorer, F-style mandolin, and probably others. How to enforce this some 60-100 years later seems to be the issue. Did their \"ownership\" suddenly expire?\n\nIn the case of Fender's body and neck shapes, they have been copied since the mid 70's by import brands and also by the booming \"parts guitar\" market and then later by \"boutique\" makers. Fender has prevailed at least to a small degree in getting the parts makers to license their brand and now aftermarket necks are stamped \"licensed by Fender.\" FWIW\n\nThe way I see it is the Flying V is the first oelectric guitar you can stand against a wall without it falling over and breaking off the 'accident-waiting-to-happen' headstock joint. This was a design move of breathtaking practicality, unfortunately it put loads of hard working guitar techs out of business, so they had to go work for companies that made proper guitars that people wanted to play, which could fall over and break the head joint. This was a move out of long tradition - for over 50 years the company had been making F style mandolins which have bits to break off when they fall over, so why stop now?"
