        "text": "Abstinence\n\nOrganized efforts to promote abstinence as the only acceptable behavior for young and unmarried persons are often called either “abstinence programs” or “abstinence-only education”. Family planning programs often present abstinence as an option to their clients, especially the very young. Abstinence programs promote this behavior as the preferred or only acceptable alternative for young and unmarried persons. Abstinence programs are educational interventions, not clinical services. The extent to which abstinence-only educational programs present abstinence as the only acceptable behavior, or denigrate contraception, varies by program.\n\nFederal support for abstinence-only education began prior to the presidency of George W. Bush and flourishes during his tenure. In the 2000 presidential campaign, he promised to spend as much money on abstinence programs as he claimed the federal government was spending on contraceptive services for adolescents – $135 million. While the accuracy of this figure has been questioned (2), the President has kept his word. By fiscal year 2006, the federal government alone committed $176 million for abstinence programs (3).\n\nFederal funding for abstinence-only education derives from more than one legislative source (Table 1). The Adolescent Family Life Act has promoted abstinence since the Reagan Administration. The 1996 Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (widely known as “Welfare Reform”) authorizes $50 million per year to be given to the states for abstinence programs.\n\nUpon assuming office in 2001, President Bush successfully advocated for authorization of a third federal abstinence program, Community Based Abstinence Education (CBAE), authorized under Title V of the Social Security Act, the Maternal and Child Health block grant (4). This new abstinence-only program adheres to more rigid guidelines than do the other federal abstinence programs. Grantees, often religious organizations, are required to teach that abstinence from sexual activity is the only way to avoid out-of wedlock pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases. “Sexual activity refers to any type of genital contact or sexual stimulation between two persons including, but not limited to, sexual intercourse” (5). Funded curricula must embrace the perspective that sexual activity outside of marriage is likely to have harmful psychological and physical effects. Table 2 shows dramatic increases in funding for this strict abstinence-only educational program. CBAE gained 40% in fiscal year 2005; the Presidential request was for a 148% increase (6).\n\nContraception\n\nWorth watching in the contraceptive policy arena are funding for family planning, emergency contraception, condoms, and parental involvement.\n\nFamily planning\n\nAnnual increases in federal funding for family planning services have not kept pace with those for abstinence-only education (Table 2). The FY 2006 Congressional appropriation for Title X, the only source of dedicated federal money for domestic family planning services, did not increase, while funding for the strictest abstinence educational program, CBAE, rose 11% (3). For FY2007, the President requested $3 million less for dedicated family planning funds and $27 million more for the strictest program of abstinence-only education (7). Congressional appropriations for family planning are unlikely to increase in 2007 (8, 9). While dedicated federal appropriations for family planning still exceeds those for abstinence, these family planning funds support clinical services for women in all reproductive ages. In contrast, abstinence-only education programs include no costly clinical services and focus primarily on adolescents.\n\nTaking into account medical inflation and small increases in funding, the federal family planning program has been diminished during President Bush's tenure. Rising costs of contraceptive supplies exacerbate this trend. From 1995 to 2001, contraceptive prices to family planning clinics increased 58% (10).\n\nEmergency Contraception\n\nEmergency contraception offers the potential to prevent over a million induced abortions in the US annually (11). During the Clinton Administration, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a dedicated product for post-coital contraception, and the government encouraged federally funded family planning clinics to provide emergency contraception.\n\nThe political climate changed dramatically with the Bush Administration. In 2003, Barr Laboratories, the manufacturer of a brand of emergency contraception, submitted an application to the FDA to approve sale of their product without prescription, as “over-the-counter” status was already the norm in many countries. The FDA defied the recommendation of its own expert panel in refusing to grant “over the counter status”. Going far beyond the issue of drug safety, an FDA official reported worrying that if young people had easier access to emergency contraception, they might be more likely to have sex without using condoms (12, 13, 14).\n\nSeveral months later, Barr Laboratories tried again to accommodate the FDA's stated concerns about adolescents, ages 16 and younger. The revised application would allow emergency contraception to be sold without a doctor's prescription to women ages 17 and older, but dispensed only with a doctor's prescription for girls ages 16 and younger. In spite of a promised deadline, several high profile resignations, ongoing litigation, and a report from the Government Accounting Office concluding that the FDA's review process had been “unusual,” the FDA continued to stall approval throughout 2005 (14).\n\nThe FDA finally approved non-prescription sales of emergency contraception in August 2006 – but only after a major political confrontation between Democratic and Republic members of the Senate – and only to women 18 years of age and older. (On 31 July 2006, the FDA sent a letter to Barr Pharmaceuticals saying that it was ready to engage in discussions with the company regarding the over-the-counter sale of its emergency contraception product to this age group. Barr Pharmaceuticals again amended its application to accommodate the FDA's age preference. Then began Senate confirmation hearings for the acting FDA Commissioner, during which Democratic Senators blocked approval of the candidate until FDA completed its decision.) Many reproductive health advocates and certain members of Congress remain concerned about the lack of scientific evidence to support this new age restriction, as well as its implications for teenage pregnancy in the US (15, 16).\n\nCondoms\n\nGiven the President's commitment to abstinence, his Administration evinces ambivalence toward the use of the male condom. The same FDA that expresses concern that emergency contraception may discourage condom use, proposes to require warning labels for condom acknowledging value, as prophylactics “greatly reduce, but do not eliminate” the risk of pregnancy and HIV infection when used during sexual intercourse. Many public health professionals worry that such warning labels will discourage the use of condoms (17).\n\nAnother issue that has received increased emphasis in the Bush Administration is parental involvement in minors' contraceptive decisions, in the context of the provision of services in the federally funded family planning program. In fact, Title X has required providers to encourage family participation since 1981 (PL 97–35) and certify it since 1997 (PL 105–78). What is new here is that clinic-based family planning programs are now required to include activities that promote proactive family planning relationships,” and are encouraged “to partner with faith-based organizations” (18).\n\nAbortion\n\nWithin the reproductive health arena, abortion politics are the most vitriolic. During President Bush's first term, the domestic abortion-related issues receiving the most attention were partial birth abortion, stem cell research, and fetal homicide. In the second term, the most salient issues concerning abortion have been appointments to the US Supreme Court and the pending vote on the Child Interstate Abortion Notification Act. In spite of the build-up of US troops in Iraq, there has been little publicity on the unavailability of abortions in military hospitals.\n\nPartial birth abortion is not a medical procedure, but a political term, emanating directly from the agenda of the Christian Coalition (19). While his predecessor vetoed the Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act twice (20), President Bush signed it into law on 5 November 2003 (21). This legislation defines such an abortion as one “in which the person performing the abortion partially vaginally delivers a living fetus before killing the fetus and completing the delivery.” The law is directed toward late second trimester and third trimester abortions, that account for only 1% of the abortions performed in the US (22, 23).\n\nStem cell research can, but does not necessarily, involve induced abortion. It does, however, raise the issue of when life begins. Research that uses fetal tissue has been ongoing for decades and has been vital in vaccine development. For example, the 1954 Nobel Prize for Medicine was given to scientists whose work on cultures of human fetal kidney cells contributed to the development of the polio vaccine” (24).\n\nThe federal government funded fetal tissue research until 1988 when the Reagan Administration issued a temporary moratorium. President Clinton lifted the moratorium by executive order in early 1993. Later that year, Congress passed the NIH Revitalization Act, allowing federal funding for research using embryos created through in vitro fertilization (IVF). Within a year and a half, the new 104th Congress blocked funds for IVF research. In 1998, two separate teams of scientists announced their respective capabilities to isolate and cultivate stem cells, a breakthrough that many biomedical researchers consider extremely promising. This development increased pressure for the federal government to resume research funding (24, 25, 26).\n\nAfter 3 years, President Bush responded by announcing that he would allow the use of federal funds for embryonic stem cell research. This declaration, however, had an important limitation. Federal funding was to be limited to what the President said were 60 existing stem cell lines, since the life and death decision (for those embryos) has already been made (27).\n\nPresident Bush's decision has not quelled the stem cell controversy (26, 28). Within the scientific community, the major debate has been the number of cell lines truly available to researchers, most say only a fraction of 60 (26). Since 2001, scientists have developed new and more productive lines of embryonic stem cells, but under the Bush policy, these cannot be used in federally funded research (29). The stem cell debate gained prominence during the 2004 presidential election (30), with John Kerry saying that if he were elected, he would lift the President's restrictions (25). Within the Republican party, too, many, including Senate Majority Leader Frist and former First Lady Nancy Reagan, have called for a less restrictive policy (31).\n\nBy July 2006, both the House and the Senate had passed legislation to expand federal support for embryonic stem cell research. The bill that was sent to President Bush for his signature would have allowed federal funding for research on embryonic stem cells, regardless of the date these lines were developed. Like the President's 2001 decision, this bill required that the stem cells had, with the donors' consent, to be extracted from frozen embryos that were going to be destroyed (27, 31).\n\nInstead of signing this legislation, George W. Bush exercised the first veto of his Presidency, saying that “this bill would support the taking of innocent human life in the hope of finding medical benefits for others” (31). Within hours of the President's veto, a House effort to override it fell 51 votes short of the two-thirds majority needed to override a Presidential veto (27). Despite bipartisan Congressional support for changing the policy, Bush's 2001 decision continues to govern federally funded embryonic stem cell research.\n\nThe Child Interstate Abortion Notification Act, which passed the House in April 2005, would criminalize the act of assisting a minor to cross state lines for the purpose of obtaining an abortion without parental notification. The bill would impose fines of up to $100,000 or up to 1 year in prison for people who violate the measure and also could penalize doctors who perform abortions on minors from other states. In the House, amendments to allow exceptions for adult relatives, such as grandmothers and aunts, were struck down. A corresponding bill, the Child Custody Protection Act, overwhelmingly passed the Senate in July 2006 (32). When the House and Senate bills are reconciled, there is little doubt that President Bush will sign this legislation (33).\n\nThe Bush Administration has shown no signs that it would reconsider the current prohibition on performing abortions in military hospitals, even when private funds are used. After assuming office in 1993, President Clinton removed the abortion ban for military hospitals that had been in effect during the Reagan-Bush years. However, the Republican majority in the 104th Congress reinstated this ban in 1995 (34, 35).\n\nThe Bush Administration has made dramatic changes in international reproductive health policy. Early in his first term, President George W. Bush reinstated the “Mexico City policy” from the Reagan-Bush era. Under this policy the US Government refuses to fund any foreign organization that provides abortion services or counseling “even with funds from non-US sources.” It gets its name because the US first announced it at the 1984 World Population Conference held in Mexico City (36, 37). Since 2002, the President has refused to contribute to the UNFPA, contending that the agency sanctions coercive practices in China.\n\nAbstinence\n\nThe Administration's international abstinence efforts, endorsing the ABC approach, have focused on HIV/AIDS policy, not on international family planning and reproductive health assistance per se. As the delivery of reproductive health services and the prevention of sexually transmitted diseases are inherently linked, the parameters of US HIV/AIDS policy become important.\n\nDuring President Bush's tenure, the US has responded to the international HIV/AIDS pandemic by funding the multilateral Global Fund and operating the much larger bilateral President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR). PEPFAR's spent $2.7 billion in fiscal 2005 for HIV/AIDS, while the US appropriation for the Global Fund was $435 million (38).\n\nPEPFAR pays for HIV/AIDS treatment, care, and prevention. It targets 15 countries that together have over 50 percent of the world's HIV cases: Botswana, Cote d'Ivoire, Ethiopia, Guyana, Haiti, Kenya, Mozambique, Namibia, Nigeria, Rwanda, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, Vietnam, and Zambia (38). PEPFAR embraces the ABC approach to HIV/AIDS prevention, which is “Abstain, Be faithful or use Condoms if you cannot follow A or B” (39, 40).\n\nPEPFAR has stressed abstinence. In fiscal 2006, the Administration increased PEPFAR resources to promote abstinence while limiting funds for condoms. PEPFAR authorizing legislation requires one third of prevention funds be spent on “abstinence-until-marriage programs”, ((38), p. 11) but the administration now says “66 percent of the resources dedicated to the prevention of HIV from sexual transmission must be used for activities that promote abstinence before marriage and fidelity” (41). The Bush Administration stipulates that PEPFAR funds may not be used for marketing or distributing condoms within school settings or for promoting condoms as the primary method of HIV prevention among youth (40).\n\nPEPFAR contractors must also make an anti-prostitution pledge, but a federal court found that this violated the first amendment of the Constitution (42, 43). Public health advocates worry that this stipulation could “inhibit the ability of NGOs to work with a group that is a key vector for HIV” ((38), p. 11).\n\nContraception\n\nReinstatement of the Mexico City policy, withholding all money from UNFPA, and no increases for family planning dominate Bush Administration policy.\n\nThe Mexico City policy applies only to US funds for international family planning assistance authorized under Title X of the Foreign Assistance Act; it does not extend to US international HIV/AIDS policy and other global health assistance. Under the Mexico City policy, no US family planning funds can be granted to foreign non-governmental organizations that provide abortion counseling or pregnancy terminations, even if using non-US sources. The 1984 Mexico City policy had been in effect until 1993 when President Clinton rescinded it (37, 44).\n\nThe Mexico City policy has some interesting twists. It does not apply to foreign governments, thus population assistance to governments continues. India and Bangladesh receive US funds for national public health systems that include menstrual regulation or induced abortion. In nations where abortion is illegal, the current Mexico City policy forbids foreign non-governmental recipients of American population assistance from engaging in political advocacy for changing these laws (45). This limitation would be unconstitutional if applied to American non-governmental organizations.\n\nThis policy has presented a real dilemma for foreign non-governmental organizations, which provide reproductive health services, particularly for past recipients of US family planning assistance. If they accept American family planning funds, they may continue to provide the same level of contraceptive services, but they cannot participate in civil dialogue about abortion in their countries. By forgoing US support, they must cut back services or find other monies (45).\n\nBecause of the Mexico City policy, approximately 480 organizations in 50 countries have agreed not to perform or refer for abortions or to speak about liberalizing abortion laws (46). According to 2003 data from the International Planned Parenthood Federation, foreign non-governmental organizations in more than 20 African countries declined to sign the Mexico City policy. As many African countries do not have well-developed public health infrastructures, their refusal to sign has meant that the poorest continent in the world is most affected by this policy. Country case studies have documented clinic closings and contraceptive shortages (45).\n\nIn 1969, the United Nations created its program to provide family planning and demographic assistance to developing countries. Ironically, another Republican US president, Richard Nixon, spearheaded the creation of UNFPA, as he preferred a multilateral approach to family planning assistance. Over the years, UNFPA's has broadened its mission to include additional reproductive health concerns, such as obstetric fistula. For the last two decades, American politicians opposed to abortion or contraception have attacked any assistance for UNFPA. During the second Clinton term, Congress and the President struggled endlessly over UNFPA funding and whether UNFPA's involvement in China implied that it was endorsing coercive practices (46, 47).\n\nDuring fiscal year 2002, UNFPA continued to receive US funding. In May 2002, the Bush Administration sent a team to investigate China's UNFPA program. After a 2-week visit, team members concluded that they had found no evidence that UNFPA “knowingly supported or participated in the management of a program of involuntary sterilization in the PRC,” and they recommended continued US support for UNFPA. Their findings were corroborated by an independent British team. Nevertheless, the State Department stopped funding UNFPA in July 2002 stating that China's population programs “retain coercive elements in law and practice” ((47), p. 397), skirting the role of UNFPA. Since 2002, the Senate has sought to reinstate funding, but not the House.\n\nThe US provided about 13 percent of UNFPA's budget in 2002 when the Bush Administration suspended the Congressionally authorized $34 million payment. In 1986, UNFPA was intended to get $46 million, about 25 percent of its budget. No published analysis describes how US actions since 2002 have affected donations from other countries, but the total budget for UNFPA has increased markedly since the US curtailed its funding. The Netherlands, Japan, and the UK were the largest three donors in 2004 (48).\n\nTable 3 shows that US bilateral funding for international family planning and reproductive health has remained largely flat during the Bush years (49). The Presidential request for the fiscal year that begins in October 2006 cuts 18 percent from international family planning programs (50, 51). As costs for contraceptives and other necessary commodities rise (52), even flat funding means less capacity to provide reproductive health services.\n\nAbortion\n\nThe Bush Administration opposes induced abortion, but the current Mexico City policy permits recipients of American population assistance to provide post-abortion care to patients, meaning that family planning grantees may treat post-abortion complications. These same grantees are not, however, allowed to refer women to clinics that provide safe abortion care. In a further twist, recipients of US population assistance may treat post-abortion complications, but they are not allowed to purchase supplies for doing so, such as manual vacuum aspiration equipment (53)."
