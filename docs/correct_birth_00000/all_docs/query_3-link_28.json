        "text": "Wednesday, November 7, 2007\n\nOn November 7, the presidents of two great nations met together in a truly inspirational setting: the large dining room of George Washington's Mansion. They talked about the values they share and reaffirmed their mutual quest for a peaceful world.\n\nPresident George W. Bush and French President Nicolas Sarkozy both made references to following in the historic footsteps of George Washington and the Marquis de Lafayette, who probably talked about some of the same topics, perhaps in the same room, more than two centuries ago.\n\nUnlike the visits of many other heads of state to Washington's home, this was no mere social gathering or photo op. The two presidents met in a closed session with only a handful of top advisors. Among the topics they discussed were strengthening security and encouraging democracy in Afghanistan, as well as stopping Iran from securing nuclear weapons. The talks touched upon the far corners of the globe, focusing on peace in the Middle East, halting genocide in Sudan, and encouraging a democratic government in Burma.\n\nAlthough a number of international leaders have traveled to Mount Vernon with American leaders-- including Winston Churchill of England, Charles de Gaulle of France, and a host of kings, queens and emperors-- historians believe the Bush-Sarkozy session marks the first time the Mansion has been used for a substantive meeting between two heads of state.\n\nTo make the strictly confidential meeting possible, Mount Vernon curators removed most of Washington's original furnishings and the delicate china, silver and glass that decorates the room. Fortunately, the Kindel Furniture Company in Grand Rapids, Michigan, handcrafted a Duncan Phyfe-style mahogany table that was perfect for the 12 members of the presidential delegations.\n\nTo make Washington's dining room more pleasing to the eye, Mount Vernon's Collections staff recovered period-style chairs with fabric donated by Brunschwig & Fils. It was a bold green--thought to be Washington's favorite color.\n\nOn the day of the meeting, President Bush and his advisors arrived first by helicopter. President Sarkozy, who addressed a joint session of Congress in the morning, traveled to Mount Vernon by limousine, stopping traffic and turning heads of curious onlookers in Old Town Alexandria, George Washington's hometown.\n\nBoth heads of state were greeted at the Mansion by Gay Hart Gaines, Vice Regent for Florida of the Mount Vernon Ladies' Association, where they were presented with leather­bound copies of a recent speech penned by author David McCullough on the close relationship between the United States and France. Executive Director James Rees then provided the two gentlemen (and two translators) with a ten-minute whirlwind tour of the Mansion.\n\nAlong the way, President Bush explained to his French counterpart that his first visit to Mount Vernon was as a young boy. \"My grandmother thought I should see this place,\" he remembered. President Bush has visited many times since, and he recalls riding his bicycle to Mount Vernon at least once. He previously visited Mount Vernon in February of that same year, to participate in a tribute to Washington on his 275th birthday.\n\nThe two leaders then paused for photographs on the piazza and the east lawn, before closing the doors of the large dining room for their official meeting.\n\nFollowing the business session, they walked through Washington's famous Upper Garden to the greenhouse, where they enjoyed a luncheon featuring squash-stuffed agnolotti and seared rockfish, prepared by White House Chef Cristeta Comerford.\n\nThe last stop during the three­-hour stay was the Bowling Green, where more than 100 reporters were gathered for a press conference.\n\n\"I have a partner in peace,\" President Bush said of Sarkozy, \"who has clear vision, basic values, who is willing to take tough positions to achieve peace.\"\n\nPresident Sarkozy announced at The White House on the previous evening, \"I wish to reconquer the hearts of America.\" He continued, \"When I say the French people love the American people, that is the truth and nothing but the truth.\"\n\nIf George Washington and his young friend Lafayette had been watching, they would have undoubtedly approved.\n\nCourtesy C-SPAN"
