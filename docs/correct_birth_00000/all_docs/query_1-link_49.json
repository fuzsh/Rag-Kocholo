        "text": "Struggle for affordable housing continues\n\nWhen urban renewal razed their homes, the displaced families' new locations were often race-dependent\n\nOf all the white families displaced, a plurality (38.5%) relocated to a private rental in the city and 26.9% of white families moved on to homeownership in the city. Just 7.7% of nonwhite families went on to own homes in the city.\n\nOf nonwhite families, 29.5% relocated to public housing in the city â the destination of just 8.1% of white families.\n\nThe focus of the urban renewal projects was not housing. It was infrastructure. New Haven is still facing housing shortages.\n\nBy 1980, New Haven was the seventh poorest city in the country, based on the number of families living below the poverty line. Just 10 years earlier it had been the 38th poorest.\n\nAccording to the census, 25.2% of people in New Haven lived in poverty in 2010, which is slightly lower than Hartford but above Boston, which had a poverty rate of 18% in 2010.\n\nThe disparities in the race of the families living in public housing resulted from discriminatory and racist policies surrounding which families were able to get loans, or redlining.\n\nâThe culmination of that is the huge wealth gap â Black families owning far less than white families,â said Karen Dubois-Walton, executive director of the Housing Authority of the City of New Haven. âYou see the continued segregation in states like Connecticut, where our suburban communities that were built in this way continue to be higher income.â\n\nHamden, a suburb of New Haven, had a 9.2% poverty rate in 2010, according to the Census. While New Haven is 43.6% white, Hamden is 58.5% white. Cheshire, another suburb in New Haven County, is 80.3% white.\n\nDubois-Walton pointed out that New Haven looked to urban renewal policies in the first place because of systemic disinvestment in the cities and the people who lived there to pave the way for the suburbs.\n\nâThe highway was used to quickly get people in and out of cities, right?â Dubois-Walton said. âIt wasn't used to invest in the city, it was like, âLet's find a way to get people who need to come into work quickly and without having to see any of the stuff that they don't want people to see.â And how do we get you quickly back out to your suburban home after you worked at maybe the university or the hospital?â\n\nThe remnants of the consequences of these decisions are still reverberating in New Haven today.\n\nâYou see in a couple places where (Interstate) 91 runs through New Haven, it runs through, actually right next to one of our public housing developments,â Dubois-Walton said. âIt's a great example of how it cut off that community from Wooster Square and feeling connected to downtown.â\n\nJim Paley, the executive director of Neighborhood Housing Services of New Haven since 1980, has been studying public housing for decades. He wants to help people in New Haven own homes by investing in neighborhoods and the upkeep of existing homes.\n\nPaley said public housing in the traditional sense has failed.\n\nHe cited the Pruitt-Igoe apartment complex in St. Louis as an example of public housing gone wrong. In the wake of urban renewal and increased need for housing, he warned against the temptation of building massive public housing complexes as a quick solution.\n\nâIt provided for the accumulation of people of a particular socioeconomic and racial and ethnic background in a segregated area,â Paley said. âThat was not a successful experiment.â\n\nThis predicament was not unique to St. Louis, but the 33 11-story buildings demolished two decades after their construction have the most infamy.\n\nNew Havenâs Elm Haven project had a similar fate. Elm Haven, built in the 1940s, was demolished in 1989 due to poor living conditions.\n\nâThis was just deemed not to be a good idea, in retrospect, to place all low income, minority people in the same structures,â Paley said.\n\nElm Havenâs replacement, Monterey Place, is a more successful development according to Paley. The buildings vary in design, layout and income level.\n\nAs for Leeâs approach to urban renewal, Paley said he wished the city had tried to rehab some of the existing homes and then constructed sensible, accessible, mixed-income housing for those who were relocated.\n\nâSome of the houses could have been preserved instead of demolished,â Paley said. âCertainly, broad scale demolition was a mistake. But what they chose to replace the houses that were demolished, that are called slums, was not really effective over time.â\n\nTrending now: The plan from 1910\n\nItâs been over a century since the âReport of the New Haven Civic Improvement Commissionâ died on Mayor Frank Riceâs desk.\n\nNew Haven does not have a subway running beneath it, but it does have a âhighway to nowhereâ running through it and many parking garages. There are some bike lanes and parks, but they are built around roads for cars, not vice versa.\n\nThe Downtown Crossing Construction is a step toward reconnecting a city disconnected by car-focused infrastructure. It is also part of a larger movement across the state and the country to refocus on pedestrians, bicyclists and neighborhoods.\n\nâMany people have jobs that essentially require them to drive everywhere, or have organized their lives around having multiple cars in a household,â said Sandy Johnston, city planner with Boston Metropolitan Planning Organization. âThose cars might be bankrupting them, but they can't envisionâ¦ they may not be in a position where they can negotiate anything else for them. We need to figure out how to make that transition happen, because it is necessary. If we can't do that, we have to give up on fighting climate change.â\n\nA life before cars existed in New Haven and continues to exist, but city planning decisions that involve car-related infrastructure changed behaviors and expectations for how people would get around.\n\nDoug Hausladen said that 30% of New Haven households have no car.\n\nA 2017 study revealed that 62% of millennials preferred a walkable community. Many groups in Connecticut such as SafeStreets Coalition, DesegregateCT and the Commuter Rail Council have advocated for those trying to get around in ways other than driving.\n\nLessons learned? Maybe\n\nLee is not here to defend his decisions. Nor is Logue. But the consensus among family members, historians, experts and their own words at the time is that The Oak Street Connector and the other remnants of urban renewal were not meant to be a project so disastrous that the city would have to spend decades reversing it.\n\nâHe said, âYou know, I could have restored that building, and made it into apartments. But instead, I knocked it down and put concrete up. And, you know, I look back on that, and, and in hindsight, as an older man, I think I could have done things differently,ââ Sally Lee said, describing a conversation she had with her father in his retirement.\n\nBiotech companies are among the structures being built on boulevards that used to be highways in downtown New Haven.\n\nâYou increase the connections between the communities and by developing on these parcels you make the city more like a human scale instead of this giant canyon of roads that you have to cross,â said Adam Weber, municipal civil engineer in New Haven.\n\nThe Congress for a New Urbanism advocates for highway removal and walkable urban spaces, through the âHighways to Boulevardsâ program.\n\nBen Crowther, who manages that program, said there has been a legacy of building highways through the path of least resistance, which is usually on the cheapest land, owned by people with the least means to fight back.\n\nCNU hopes to change that. Crowther pointed to recent highway removal programs in Rochester as a success story.\n\nâThey've taken out about two thirds of a mile of their inner loop and replaced it with a city streetâ¦â Crowther said. âRochester has been able to reclaim six and a half acres of landâ¦they've built about 540 housing units.â\n\nA new generation of leaders is coming of age in New Haven with big dreams not unlike Lee, delivering papers door to door so many decades ago.\n\nâI think rebuilding communities is exactly what we're trying to do,â said Eli Sabin, a Yale student and New Haven alderman. âI think we're trying to create the built environment, the infrastructure that allows communities to flourish. So that means, the housing, the affordable housing, the safe, walkable streets with access to transit and jobs, the restaurants and businesses that people want to be close to.â\n\nSabin has lived in New Haven his whole life and has no plans of leaving. It may not be a âmodel city,â but he said itâs one with a lot of potential.\n\nâThe New Haven that I want to live in 10, or 15 or 20 years from now is the New Haven where everybody who wants one has a good paying job they can support their family on and has an affordable place to live and feel safe on our city streets and that their kids are going to a good public school,â Sabin said.\n\nâI think, if we make that happen, all the other problems that we face in the city are going to go away.â"
