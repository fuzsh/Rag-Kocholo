        "text": "George W. Bush of 281 Edwards Street was born on July 6, 1946, in New Haven, Connecticut, at Grace-New Haven Hospital, now Yale-New Haven Hospital, to George Bush and Barbara Pierce Bush. The New Haven Free Public Library conducted a search for a birth announcement for George W. Bush in the town where he was born at our request. They sent an email on December 2, 2015, stating “sorry to report that we checked the New Haven Register for 7/7/1946 through 7/11/1946 and did not find a birth announcement for George W. Bush.”\n\nThe Texas State Library and Archives Commission told us by email on December 1, 2015, that they had found “a digital image of a notice of registration of birth for George W. Bush contained in the Governor George W. Bush Press Office Speech Files, Biographical and family information … The document was faxed to the Governor’s Office from the holdings of the presidential library of George H. W. Bush, located in College Station, Texas.”\n\nSource documentation to the above:\n\n1. New York Times, “Bush’s Birthplace? It’s Deep in the Heart of . . . New Haven,” By Dick Ahles, Dec. 24, 2000 (Accessed on 12/10/15)"
