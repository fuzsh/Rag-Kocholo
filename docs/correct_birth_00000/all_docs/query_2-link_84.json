        "text": "The scene above dates to around 1886 looking east down Chapel Street from the corner of College Street. The New Haven House Hotel stands at the corner across from the Green. This scene was largely unchanged until 1910 when the hotel was torn down and replaced with the Hotel Taft. The Taft was built by Yale graduates, and named after another alum, President William Howard Taft. This building, designed by New York architect F. M. Andrews and built in 1911, was then the tallest in New Haven and it was also considered the finest hotel between New York and Boston. The images above depict how the hotel looked in the months following its opening on January 1, 1912. Starting at the top left and going clockwise in photos below: view of the front entrance on College Street, the main lobby, the basement Rathskeller or Grill Room and the main Dining Room. Besides these larger spaces the hotel also had a large basement swimming pool, a ballroom on the top floor, a Palm Room for dining, a reading room and Lady’s Lounge.\n\nThe Hotel Taft became the center of New Haven’s popular social life and its proximity to the Shubert Theater and Yale University made it the destination of students, professors, tourists and actors. Some of the famous people who were guests at the Hotel Taft include presidents, actors, writers, producers, scientists and athletes. Woodrow Wilson stayed at the Taft while on his presidential campaign trail in 1912. William Howard Taft, pictured on the upper left, was known to have stayed here while he was searching for a home, while he was a Yale professor in 1914. Babe Ruth, pictured on the top center, stayed at the Taft in 1932 and was completely mobbed outside by young fans. Other notables who have visited the Taft include Humphrey Bogart, Spencer Tracy, The Marx Brothers, Katherine Hepburn, Henry Fonda, Marlon Brando, pictured on the bottom center, Thornton Wilder, Eleanor, Roosevelt, pictured on the bottom left, Jack Dempsey, Albert Einstein, pictured on the top right, and Lou Gehrig. The Taft was featured in songs, books, musicals and films as well. Cole Porter wrote and performed songs here from 1912-13, a reproduction of the hotel lobby was built in Hollywood for the F. Scott Fitzgerald based film “A Chorus Girl’s Romance” in 1920, Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein, pictured on the bottom right, rewrote the musical “Oklahoma!” here after it bombed at the Shubert, “The Gilmore Girls” television show was based here and references to the Taft were made in F. Scott Fitzgerald’s book “The Great Gatsby” and in J. D. Salinger’s book “Franny and Zooey”. Numerous dinners, dances and celebrations featuring national and local clubs, leagues, schools and businesses occurred in the Taft. Connecticut’s first AM radio station, now called WDRC, broadcast from the Taft in the 1920s.\n\nThe Hotel Taft, pictured at right around 1912 shortly after it was constructed, was a great social center and gathering place during its days of operation. The advent of Prohibition in 1920 in the United States meant that no alcohol could be served in any capacity. This devastating blow affected all hotels, restaurants and saloons. The Taft Barroom was shuttered during this period, but surely drinking was accomplished behind locked doors and in alleys. The Speakeasy was born at this time and it is believed that one of these secret clubs existed in the Grill Room in the basement. During the Great Depression the repeal of Prohibition occurred in 1933, giving a green light for alcohol to be served at the Taft. The Barroom was renovated with a new bar, moldings, doorways and more, creating the English Tap Room in 1935. A new stairway was installed to the basement Grill Room from the front of the bar. The advertisement on the top left from 1937 shows the Double Cocktail being served in both bars at the time. The ad in the top middle from the same year shows Eddy Weaver and his Hotel Taft Grill Orchestra in the basement Grill Room. On the top right is an advertisement from a 1946 Shubert Theater playbill inviting playgoers to indulge in the bar at all times. On the bottom is an article from a 1946 newspaper that shows some of the happy guests of the Belle-Tan Club of New Haven in the Collonade Room, or main Dining Room in 1946.\n\nThe image above shows the Taft Barroom with its original wood paneling, plaster ceiling, bar and bar back in 1912. Below shows how it looked in 1935 after Prohibition when it was called the Tap Room.\n\nThe Hotel Taft closed in 1973 partly due to competition from the Park Plaza nearby and also due to Yale University’s acceptance of women in 1969, as the hotel saw less business from visiting females from other Ivy League schools. For almost a decade the hotel sat vacant until 1981, when the Starrett Housing Corp. of New York renovated the building into apartments. The old Tap Room still sat vacant until one of the residents, Richter Elser, a Yale graduate and crew instructor, stumbled on the space and opened up Richter’s Cafe instead of heading to Harvard Law School. The photo above shows how the bar looked just before renovations in 1982, taken by local photographer David Ottenstein. After nearly 20 years of business providing quality beer in pints, pitchers and half yards, Dieter von Rabenstein, longtime Richter’s owner, shut its doors in 2011. Restoration finally began by local restaurateurs Jason and brother Tom Sobocinski, Mike Farber and Tim Cabral in 2013. This timeline was prepared and created by local author, historian and architectural designer, Colin M. Caplan. Cheers!"
