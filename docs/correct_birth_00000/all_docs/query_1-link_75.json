        "text": "We are pleased to be able to offer our patients who desire midwifery care the ability to see the midwives affiliated with the Center for Women’s Health and Midwifery (CWHM) located at 789 Howard Avenue, New Haven (Phone 203-789-3029).\n\nFew times in life are as exciting and full of opportunity as the time when you are expecting a new baby. Choosing a birth setting that fits your values and preferences is an important part of the experience.\n\nYale Health now offers two choices for care during pregnancy and when the time comes to welcome your new baby into the world. Both options use the Labor and Birth unit at Yale New Haven Children’s Hospital which is at the 20 York Street Campus of YNHH.\n\nOne option is to continue to receive your care during pregnancy from our team of physicians, nurse practitioners, and registered nurses at Yale Health, with your birth attended by one of our obstetricians.\n\nA second option is to receive your care during pregnancy and childbirth from certified nurse midwives at the Center for Women’s Health and Midwifery (CWHM) who see patients at 789 Howard Avenue, New Haven. This option requires a referral from your Yale Health Ob/Gyn clinician.\n\nWith either choice, you will receive prenatal care during the first three months of your pregnancy at Yale Health. After the first trimester, you will be able to transfer your care to the midwifery group if you so choose, assuming you have no complicating medical conditions. If you are interested in this option, you should discuss this with a clinician during one of your appointments in early pregnancy, and together decide if transferring your care to the midwifery group is a good choice for you. If this is deemed to be a good choice, the clinician will then enter a referral to our Referrals office to recommend approving the coverage for midwifery care at CWHM. Once approved, you would then schedule prenatal care appointments with CWHM by calling their office.\n\nIf you choose to transfer your care to CWHM but unexpected complications arise during pregnancy, you may need to be transferred back to Yale Health. For example, if your baby is breech and you are advised to have a scheduled cesarean delivery, you would return to Yale Health Ob/GYN for the remainder of your prenatal care and for the cesarean delivery surgery.\n\nRegardless of whether you get care at Yale Health or care with the certified nurse-midwives at Yale New Haven Hospital, you should:"
