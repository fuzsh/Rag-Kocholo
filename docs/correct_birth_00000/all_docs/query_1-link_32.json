        "text": "Who We Are\n\nNHHS is a federally-funded urban health initiative to reduce infant mortality and eliminate racial and ethnic disparities in birth outcomes. The program is part of a national network of 101 Healthy Start programs in 37 states and funded by the federal grant (H49MC00095) from the Department of Health and Human Services, Health Resources and Services Administration, Maternal and Child Health Bureau, Division of Perinatal Health Systems.\n\nHow We Work\n\nNew Haven Healthy Start strengthens the maternal and child health system for women and babies through its care-coordination partnership model.\n\nCare coordinators are strategically located at New Haven Heathy Start partner sites where pregnant mothers are most likely to visit and make sure they are connected to all the services they need for successful births.\n\nCollaborating to improve the health of babies and families\n\nConsortium Meetings\n\nThe NHHS Consortium provides a platform for the community to learn and understand conditions that impact family health. Community members are invited to participate in discussions and activities to improve conditions that impact families and the services they receive.\n\nNHHS also hosts a Menâ€™s Consortium as a support network for men & fathers in the Greater New Haven area.\n\nBest practices for community research\n\nResearch Partnerships\n\nSince 2005, New Haven Healthy Start Executive Director Natasha Ray and physician researchers from the Yale Robert Wood Johnson Clinical Scholars Program (YRWJFCSP) have partnered on a series of research projects to address maternal health issues in New Haven.\n\nTheir collaboration produced a guidebook for best practices in community partner research. The guide is intended to enhance the experiences of other community leaders (including other Healthy Start Programs) and university researchers who are working in collaborative relationships."
