        "meta_description": "George W. Bush, who would become the 43rd president of the USA, was born in 1946 in a hospital in New Haven, Connecticut, and he lived in the city for his first two years of life (in a house now occupied by the Yale School of Economics), while his father finished school at Yale. After that, the new family moved to West Texas, ending up at this house in Midland, one of a few places where two future presidents lived under one roof. George Sr. paid $9,000 for the 12 year old 1,400 square foot home, at 1412 West Ohio Avenue. Over their time there, the family grew with three more children. Four years later, when George W. was eight, the family moved into a bigger house in town. The original house changed hands many times after they sold it. It was purchased by the Permian Basin Board of Realtors in 2001 for $100,000, and turned over to the George W. Bush Childhood Home, Inc. a nonprofit supported in part by the Bush family, in order to become a museum. It was restored to the time that the Bushes were living there, and opened to the public in 2006. The family moved to Houston in 1959, and the following year George W. went away to boarding school in Massachusetts (Phillips Andover, where his father went too), then to college at Yale (like his father), then, also like his father, moved to Midland, to work in the oil business, in 1975. George W. and his wife bought a house, at 1405 Golf Course Road, in 1977, raising their two children there, until 1985, when they moved away. George W. founded and managed a few small oil and gas exploration companies, including Arbusto Energy, in 1979, which evolved into Harken Energy in 1986. He moved his family to Washington in 1988 to help manage his father’s presidential campaign, then got involved in Dallas’ Texas Rangers baseball franchise in 1989, and local politics.",
