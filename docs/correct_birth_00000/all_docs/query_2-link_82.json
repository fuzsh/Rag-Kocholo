        "text": "1a. Cuyler Reynolds (ed.), Hudson-Mohawk Genealogical and Family Memoirs - Vol. I, Lewis Historical Publishing Company, New York, NY, 1911: pgs. 94-100.\n\n\"The Thompson family of Troy, New York, whose ancestry is herein recorded, descended from Anthony Thompson, of England, who came to America in 1637 and is the founder of the American family of Thompson known as the New Haven branch. It is not known from what part of England he came, but as Rev. Davenport (with whom he came) had been a minister in London and Eaton, Hopkins and others had been merchants in that city, the inference is that he was a native of or near London. The name has long been known in England, Scotland and Ireland under different spellings - Tompson, Tomson, Thomson and Thompson. In a later generation the line crossed another Thompson family, not known to be related, beginning with John Thompson, of England and Stratford, Connecticut. Through this line descent is gained from Elder William Brewster of the 'Mayflower,' Sir Richard Saltonstall, Lion Gardiner and other famous colonial and revolutionary families. The Thompson arms: Or, on a fesse dancettee az, three etoiles ar. on a canton of the second, the sun in glory ppr. Crest: An arm erect, vested gu. cuff ar. holding in the hand ppr. five ears of wheat or. Motto: In lumine luce.\n\n(I) Anthony Thompson with his wife (name unknown), two children, and brothers, John and William Thompson, embarked at London, England, on the ship 'Hector,' for America, where they arrived June 26, 1637, according to Winthrop's Journal, but according to Cotton Mather, the date was July 26, 1637. They landed at Boston. They were a part of the company which came with Governor Eaton and Rev. Davenport, dissenters from the Church of England, who left their homes to take up a residence in the new world, where they could be free from the constant persecutions which characterized the reign of Charles I. The company was composed of men of wealth and energy, and after careful selection, they decided to follow their pastor, Rev. Davenport, in his choice of location, which was Quinnipiack or New Haven, Connecticut. The Thompson brothers were allotted lands and became leading citizens. John lived at East Haven, where he died December 11, 1674. The farm he owned is said to be yet owned by descendants. He married but left no male issue. William made his will October 6, 1682, dying the same year. He resided and died in New Haven.\n\nAnthony Thompson signed the Colonial Constitution, June 4, 1639, and appears in the original list as having shares in the first and second divisions of land. He took the oath of allegiance in 1644. His will was made March 23, 1648, shortly before his death. It was probably made 'in extremis.' It was drawn up by Rev. John Davenport, pastor, and Robert Newman, ruling elder of the church. He is called Brother Anthony Thompson, and seems to have been a devout member of the church. The name of his first wife is unknown. His second wife was Kathern. By first wife he had two sons and a daughter, and by the second wife, two daughters and a posthumous son. Children of Anthony Thompson, the emigrant:\n\n1. John, born in England, 1632, see forward;\n\n2. Anthony, born in England, December, 1634, died at age of twenty years;\n\n3. Bridget, born 1637, married Rev. John Bowers, of Guilford, New Haven and Derby, Connecticut;\n\n4. Anna, baptized June 8, 1645, married --------- Stanton;\n\n5. Lydia, baptized July 24, 1647, married, September 20, 1665, Isaac Crittenden, of Guilford;\n\n6. Ebenezer, baptized October 15, 1648, married, June, 1671, Deborah Dudley.\"\n\nThe transcriber of this account included a son, Stanton, as child number five of Anthony Thompson. However, other reputable sources indicate that the surname of the husband of Anna Thompson was Stanton. Hence, this is an obvious typographical error, which has been corrected. (Schenectady Digital History Archive, www.schenectadyhistory.org/families/hmgfm/thompson-1.html, 2003.)\n\nb. ibid.: pgs. 419-23.\n\n\"Mary Thompson, wife of Dr. Samuel Gale, of Troy, descended from Henry Thompson, of Lenham, England, and Dorothy, his wife.\n\n(II) Anthony, son of Henry and Dorothy Thompson, was born at Lenham, Kent county, England, August 30, 1612, died March, 1684. He landed at Boston from the ship 'Hector,' July 26, 1637, and was one of the first settlers of New Haven, Connecticut, and signed the Colony Constitution, June 4, 1639. The name of his first wife is unknown. His second was Katherine ---------.\n\n(III) John, eldest son of Anthony Thompson and his first wife, was born 1632. He is called 'Skipper' John Thompson, and John Thompson, 'the mariner,' and Mr. John Thompson. He died June 2, 1707. His wife Hellena died October 8, 1690.\n\n(IV) Captain Samuel Thompson, son of John and Hellena Thompson, was born May 12, 1669, at New Haven, Connecticut, died March 26, 1749; married, November 14, 1695, Rebecca, daughter of Lieutenant-Governor James Bishop, of Connecticut, and his wife, Elizabeth Tompkins. Captain Thompson was a merchant, and was successively sergeant, ensign, lieutenant and captain.\n\n(V) Samuel (2), son of Captain Samuel (1) and Rebecca (Bishop) Thompson, was born December 2, 1696, at New Haven, Connecticut. He married Sarah (or Hester) Allen (or Alling), January 20, 1719. He settled in Goshen, Connecticut, removing from there to Stanford, Dutchess county, New York, where with his brothers he bought twenty-eight hundred acres of land.\"\n\nObviously, the date March, 1684, given for the death of Anthony Thompson is incorrect. The year should have been 1648 N. S. and in all likelihood, 1684 is a simple typographical inversion of 1648. As for the month of March, it is known that Anthony Thompson made his will on March 23, 1647 (1648 N. S.). However, it is generally believed that his son Ebenezer, born or christened on October 15, 1648, was posthumous. Within this context, Savage stated that Anthony Thompson made his will some months before the birth of his son and modern researcher, Gary Boyd Roberts, states that he died in September of 1648. Taken together, both of these statements imply that Anthony Thompson died at least a few months after he made his will, but before the birth of his son the following October. In addition, as noted elswhere, the presumption that Anthony Thompson was the son of Henry and Dorothy Honywood Thompson of Lenham, County Kent, England, is almost certainly erroneous.

William Richard Cutter, Genealogical and Family History of Western New York - Vols. 1-3, Lewis Historical Publishing Company, New York, NY, 1912: Vol. 1, pgs. 295-6.\n\nThis account of the early Thompson family is essentially identical to that given above by Reynolds and must have come from the same source. The only differences are that it has been applied to the \"Thompson family of Cattaraugus county\" instead of Troy, New York, and the description of arms and a few other details have been omitted.\n\nb. ibid.: Vol. 2, pg. 575.\n\n\"Anthony Thompson, with his wife, two children and two brothers, John and William, embarked at London, on board the ship 'Hector,' in company with Theophilus Eaton, Rev. Mr. Davenport, and others, from Coventry, England. They arrived in Boston, June 26, 1637. They were Dissenters from the Church of England, and left home to enjoy quietly here the principles of their faith, as well as to avoid the constant persecutions, taxes and exactions which were so frequent during the reign of Charles I. The Davenport colony finally settled in Quinnipiac (New Haven). Anthony signed the colony constitution June 4, 1639. The Thompson brothers each secured grants of land. John lived in East Haven, where he died December 11, 1674. William and Anthony resided in New Haven all their lives, and died there. Anthony died March 23, 1647, at which time he made a nuncupative will in presence of Rev. John Davenport and Robert Newman, who afterward committed his instructions to writing and appeared before the proper officer to prove it, May 27, 1650. He bequeathed the lands which were set off to him originally, and the house he had built thereon, to his second son, John, other lands to his son Anthony (2), a certain sum to Bridget, daughter of his first wife, provided she married in accordance with the wishes of the deacons of the church, and the remainder of the estate to Catherine, and to his three daughters by her, her share to continue during her widowhood only, but as she married Nicholas Camp, July 14, 1652, the property reverted to the estate.\"\n\nHere, Cutter stated that Anthony Thompson died in March on the same day as he made his will. Other researchers disagree with this and believe that he lived until the late summer or early fall. However, the assertion that his will was nuncupative would suggest that the state of his health must have been very poor and that he was probably an invalid and, perhaps, incompetent.\n\nback to bio.\n\n3. Stephen Dodd, The East-Haven Register, T. G. Woodward and Co., print., A.H. Maltby, distrib., New Haven, CT, 1824: pg. 154.\n\n\"JOHN and ANTHONY THOMPSON, brothers, signed the Colony Constitution, New-Haven, June, 1639, and in 1647, their brother WILLIAM is mentioned. ANTHONY had a son John. In ANTHONY'S Will, dated 1647, he mentions his brothers WILLIAM and JOHN. In 1654, ANTHONY, jun. by Will, gave all his lands to his brother John. One John died in 1674. In 1682, WILLIAM made his Will and names his sister Ellen, his brother ANTHONY'S son John, his cousins John and William, sons of his nephew JOHN, and other relatives. EBENEZER, who settled in Gulford, was of the New-Haven family, and had a son John, who died in 1676. The JOHN that settled at Stoney River, was also of this family, and was called Farmer JOHN, in distinction from JOHN at New-Haven, who was a seaman.\"\n\nback to bio.\n\n4a. Edward E. Atwater, History of the Colony of New Haven to its absorption into Connecticut, privately published, New Haven, CT, 1881: pgs. 110, 150-1, 542-4, & 548.\n\n\"Passing now to the suburb on the west side of West Creek, we find, on the corner made by the streets now named Hill Street and Congress Avenue, the lot of William Ives. He died in 1648, leaving a wife and four children. William Basset married the widow; and the family continued to reside in the house till it was sold, in 1652, to the widow of Anthony Thompson.\"\n\n\"These three are all of the lots in the suburb on the west side of the West Creek that can be located. The other proprietors in this suburb were Matthew Moulthrop, Anthony Thompson, John Reeder, Robert Cogswell, Matthias Hitchcock, Francis Hall, Richard Osborne, William Potter, James Clark, Edward Patteson, and Andrew Hull.\"\n\n\"Anthony Thompson died about ten years after the first settlement of the town. His widow married Nicholas Camp of Milford. As one of his two brothers was childless, and the other had only daughters, he is probably the ancestor of all, or nearly all, in New Haven who, bear the name of Thompson.\"\n\nfootnote: \"There was another Thompson at Fairfield, contemporary with Anthony of New Haven. Possibly, from that source or some other, Thompsons may have removed to New Haven, and become undistinguishably mixed with the descendants of Anthony.\"\n\nb. ibid.: pg. 112. The \"1641 map of the original nine squares\" has had an interesting history and has been believed erroneously by some researchers to actually date to the seventeenth century. However, Atwater took full responsibility for drawing it based on original land titles.
