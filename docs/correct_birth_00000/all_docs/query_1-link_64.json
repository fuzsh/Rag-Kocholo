        "text": "Our History\n\nIn 1985, The Community Foundation convened the Commission on Child and Infant Health to address alarmingly high infant mortality rates in New Haven, particularly among African Americans.\n\nThe collaboration between health officials, community leaders and child care advocates provided the base for The Community Foundation’s application for federal funding for a Healthy Start program in New Haven.\n\nThe program received its first grant and was launched in 1997. To this day, New Haven Healthy Start is one of only two Healthy Start programs in the country to be part of a community foundation.\n\nSince its inception, New Haven Healthy Start has has successfully implemented all core services for a federal Healthy Start program. In June 2024, it received its most recent 5-year federal grant award to support the program.\n\nOur Impact\n\nIn 25 years of New Haven Healthy Start . . .\n\nMore than 19,600 pregnant women have received care coordination services\n\nMore than 11,500 infants have secured medical homes in primary care centers\n\nInfant mortality rates in New Haven have dropped by more than half.\n\nAll prenatal women enrolled in NHHS have received comprehensive risk assessments\n\nThe Consortium has increased partner and participant engagement\n\n1987\n\nPrior to New Haven Healthy Start, one out of 50 babies in New Haven died within their first year of birth, an Infant Mortality Rate (IMR) of more than 20 deaths per 1,000 live births. The IMR was 79% higher than the state average and 64% higher than the national average.\n\n2024\n\nThe current infant mortality rate has fallen to 10.8 deaths per 1,000 live births, but is 14.4 per 1,000 live births in African American and Latina families."
