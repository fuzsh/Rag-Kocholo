        "text": "George Walker Bush was born on July 6, 1946, in New Haven, Connecticut. The eldest son of George and Barbara Bush, he grew up in Midland and Houston, Texas. In 1968 he graduated from Yale University with a degree in history. He then served as a pilot in the Texas Air National Guard. In 1975 he earned a master’s degree in business from Harvard University.\n\nBush returned to Midland and started an oil business. In 1977 he married Laura Welch. The couple had twin daughters. In 1978 Bush ran for a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives but lost. He worked on his father’s campaign during the 1988 presidential election. Bush then joined a group that bought the Texas Rangers baseball team.\n\nIn 2000 Bush ran for president with Richard Cheney as his vice presidential running mate. His opponent was Al Gore, vice president under President Bill Clinton.\n\nIn the election more people voted for Gore than for Bush. But in a presidential election a candidate must win the votes of a group of people known as the electoral college. That contest was very close. The outcome depended on Florida, as both candidates needed its electoral votes to win. The vote in Florida was also very close, and for several weeks Florida recounted its votes. Eventually the U.S. Supreme Court stopped the recounts. That decision made Bush the winner in Florida and the next president. Bush took office on January 20, 2001.\n\nBush had the advantage of working with a Republican-led Congress. Soon after his election he signed a major tax cut into law.\n\nBush faced his greatest challenge on September 11, 2001. Thousands died after terrorists flew hijacked airplanes into the World Trade Center in New York City and the Pentagon in Washington, D.C. Bush called for a global war on terrorism. He identified Osama bin Laden, the leader of a group called al-Qaeda, as the main suspect in the attacks. Bush ordered air attacks against the government of Afghanistan, which he accused of helping bin Laden. The government fell by the end of the year.\n\nIn 2002 Bush turned his attention to Iraq. Bush accused Iraq’s president, Saddam Hussein, of supporting al-Qaeda and of having banned weapons. In March 2003 a U.S.-led force invaded Iraq. Within a few months the force overthrew Iraq’s government, and in December Saddam was captured. U.S.-led troops remained in Iraq to help the country form a new government. However, fighting continued.\n\nMany people protested the war, as well as the poor U.S. economy. Nevertheless, in 2004 Bush was elected to a second term. He defeated Democrat John Kerry.\n\nDuring his second term Bush appointed two people to the Supreme Court. But he continued to face problems related to the ongoing war and the economy. These issues made Bush and other Republicans very unpopular. They helped Democrat Barack Obama defeat Republican John McCain in the presidential election in 2008. Bush left office in January 2009 and returned to private life in Texas."
