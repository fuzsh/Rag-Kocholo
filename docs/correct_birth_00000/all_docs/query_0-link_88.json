        "text": "Dwight Eisenhower was the thirty-fourth president of the United States of America. He was born in Denison, Texas on October 14, 1890 to David Jacob Eisenhower and Ida Elizabeth Stover Eisenhower (Eisenhower, 2014). His parents’ had seven sons and he was the third of the seven sons. The family lived near railroad track in a tiny house in Denison, Texas, all the while his father David cleaned train engines to earn a living for them. Before Dwight was born, the Eisenhower lived in Abilene, Kansas. When he was only a year and a half old, his family moved back to Abilene, Kansas so that his father could acquire a better job at his brother-in-law’s creamery. When Dwight was four years old, his 10-month old brother Paul died of diphtheria. Despite the tragedy of the passing of his brother, Dwight didn’t let that stop him from having happy childhood memories.\n\nBenjamin Harrison was the 23rd president of the United States of America. He was born on a small Ohio farm on August 20, 1833, the second of nine children of hard working parents John Harrison and Elizabeth Ramsey Harrison. In many ways Benjamin Harrison was “born to be President” because of his heritage. He was named after his great grandfather who was a member of the House of Burgesses and a signer of the Declaration of Independence. He was the grandchild of 19th President of the United States William Henry Harrison, and the descendent of many other significant political officers and patriots. All of these facts added up to his reputation and led up to his presidency.\n\nBorn in July 6, 1946, George W. Bush, America’s 43rd president, served in the White House office from 2001 to 2009. Before coming into the White House, he was the oldest son of former 41st U.S. President George H. W. Bush, who was also a two-term Republican governor of the state of Texas. George W. Bush was a graduate of Yale University and Harvard Business majoring in business administration. George W. Bush worked in the Texas oil industry and he was also an owner of the Texas Rangers baseball team before becoming the governor of Texas. In the year of 2000 he barely won the Electoral College vote in one of the closest and most controversial elections in American History. He won the presidency after narrowly defeating his Democratic opponent Al Gore. George W. Bush’s presidency in office was basically shaped by the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks against the United States of America. Due to the attacks, he declared a global “war on terrorism”, which resulted in the formation of the Department of Homeland Security and the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.\n\nDuring Bush’s Senior year in high school, he was the class president. This made him realize he liked to be involved and have his voice heard. When in college, he was the captain of the baseball team. Once again this reminded him that he wanted to be a leader. When in the Navy, he dealt with many other countries making him very interested in foreign affairs. In 1953, Bush became the president of Zapata Off-Shore Company. When he moved his family to Texas, he decided it was his turn to follow his dad in politics and he was elected the Republican party chairman in Harris County. He was later appointed to several important positions: U.S. ambassador to the United Nations in 1971, head of the Republican National Committee during the watergate scandal, U.S. envoy to China, and director of the Central Intelligence Agency in\n\nThe social life of Ronald Wilson Reagan was not as comfortable as anyone my think of for a president of United States of America, with a background of a poor family of a mix parent of both Irish and Dutch origin. Ronald Wilson Reagan was born on 6th February 1911 in a apartment located in a commercial building in Tampico Illinois where his parent had to work hard to provide what life had to offer at that time.\n\nTexas made way for many great things, frozen margarita machines, chili con carne, corn dogs, Whataburger, and Six Flags, but did you know a truly heroic, patriotic president also came from this fascinating state? George Walker Bush was born to the former president, George Herbert Walker Bush and the former first lady, Barbara Pierce Bush in New Haven, Connecticut, along with some of his brothers and sisters, Jeb, Neil, Marvin, Robin, and Dorothy. (Rountree, 1) Not only was his father into the politics, but also was his grandfather, Prescott Bush. Not only was Prescott a former banker for the world famous Wall Street, but he also happened to be a\n\nGeorge H.W. Bush deserves to be named “Person of the Decade”. He worked hard to follow his own beliefs in what was the right thing to do and achieved amazing things because of that. When dealing with the Soviet Union and Mikhail Gorbachev he established his own methods and plan instead of following Raegan’s. Soon after his plan was established things in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union began to change. The berlin wall collapsed and the communist rule through out Eastern Europe was overthrown. Bush chose to let all of these events happen naturally, cautious not to do anything to make Gorbachev’s position any worse. Bush had the policy review complete and decided to meet with Gorbachev. While in the meeting they laid the basis for completing\n\nThe George W. Bush administration was riddled with many tragic events, from natural disasters to terrorist attacks, and economic hardships that made lasting impressions of the American peoples’ perceptions of our government and the world outside of the United States’ boundaries. The six people who conducted this research, George Shambaugh, Richard Matthew, Roxane C. Silver, Bryan McDonald, Michael Poulin, and Scott Blum, set out to discover how the before mentioned events effected the group unit of analysis, “U.S. Public”, views towards our government, the media, terrorism, and their overall outlook on America’s future. It had appeared that they had the predetermined notion that because of terrorist attacks and natural disasters the U.S. public would be pessimistic and afraid foreign countries. Other suggested hypothesis were that peoples’ independent identities affect their perception of national and personal threat, outlook for the future, trust in the government, and approval of policies passed in our nation’s difficult times in a way that creates a noticeable divide at these identities. Although, neither of these hypothesis seem to be true.\n\nThe United States (US) and the global community await the inauguration of elected President Donald J. Trump this coming January. The new incoming president is the result of Republican Party backing and the voting power of the people who voiced their needs to see major change in the US political system of government. As the American public await the allocation of 15 presidential cabinet positions, one cannot help but question the ability of the president elect to take the US to a positive and prosperous direction. These questions arise in light that Mr. Trump, though a leader in the real estate market and a focal point in some areas of the media, has no working military or political experience. Thus it is my belief that the policies of the US will be driven by the experience of the executive cabinet and the general directives of President-elect Trump. The president-elect ran on a populist platform touting opposition on illegal immigration, Current international trade agreements like the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) (Emery Jr., 2016) and a reversal, opposition of current policy, of key security at home points such as a buildup in military force and missile defense, removal of gun purchasing restriction and right to carry laws (Gilmer, 2016). The affirmation of President-elect Trump’s resolve will be solidified by his administration and the embodied experience that will be used to support it. But what can this new\n\nOne may be making a virtuous decision when choosing the lesser of two evils, but one will still find himself stuck with an evil choice. Many Americans today find themselves in this predicament when considering the only two real possible choices for President of the United States. On one hand, voters have former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who the Federal Bureau of Investigations labeled “careless” and “grossly negligent” in the handling of America 's top secret information. On the other hand, voters have Donald Trump, who has said “he would like to ban all Muslims”. It is easy to see how the Pew Research Center has reported that there is widespread skepticism among registered voters concerning the presidential race. The poll reported that a higher percentage of voters thought that both candidates would make “terrible presidents” rather than merely “average presidents’”(Pew Poll, August 2016). Americans are very unhappy with their two choices for President of the United States. The three main reasons behind this dissatisfaction are increasing negative partisanship, media 's constant push of a narrative to appeal to their base, and the overall qualities of the candidates themselves.\n\nAmerica lies in the wake of the impending presidential election, which has been shrouded in controversy from its infancy. FBI investigations, leaked emails, private recordings, rape allegations, and indubitable untruths have plague both front-runners. Despite the foul taste left in the mouth of many Americans by Donald Trump and Hilary Clinton, they have come out victorious in their campaign to represent their respective party as the nominee for president. While it was once widely believe that the American people democratically elect the president of the United States, through current influences such as the media, internet, and growing population an exorbitant amount of Americans believe that their vote no longer counts, thus posing the question who’s really in control of the electoral process? In the past, the call to question of the integrity of the electoral processes was strictly reserved for the most devout conspiracy theorist, but with the pullulating concerns over super delegates, average sound mind Americans are not sure the full truth is being told. Has America been fed at noble lie? A simple answer yes, a more complex answer America has been fed a misconception disguised as a lie."
