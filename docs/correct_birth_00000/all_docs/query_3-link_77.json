Bush, 41st President of the United States.\n\n\"The President's Own\" Marine Chamber Orchestra will participate in the funeral of President Bush beginning at 11 a.m., Wednesday, Dec. 5 at the Washington National Cathedral. The full program and details will be posted here as become available.\n\n\"The President's Own\"\n\nRemembers George H.W. Bush\n\nby Master Sgt. Kristin duBois\n\nAs the nation mourns the passing of one its finest patriots, current and former members of the Marine Band remember President George H. W. Bush as a man whose love of music and uncommon graciousness elevated the unique relationship between the Chief Executive and “The President’s Own.”\n\n“Although President Bush served as our Commander-in-Chief before my time in ‘The President’s Own,’ the close relationship he developed with the Marine Band is well-known,” Music Adviser to the White House and Marine Band Col. Jason K. Fettig said. “We have been fortunate to have had wonderful moments with every president we serve, but President and Mrs. Bush’s gratitude for our Marines and for the special music we provide in The People’s House was especially warm and always engaging. He never missed an opportunity to connect with those around him and thank them for their contributions, and the men and women in the band who got to know President Bush both during his administration and in the many years beyond will always remember his ever-present appreciation and admiration for all those who served our nation alongside him.”\n\nRead the full story\n\nInauguration of President George H. W. Bush on Jan. 20, 1989, at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C. \"The President's Own\" U. S. Marine Band was seated directly below the podium and provided music throughout the ceremony. (Video courtesy of C-SPAN)\n\nPresident Bush spoke briefly to thank Dana Carvey, a presidential impersonator and comedian, for appearing at the White House staff’s Christmas ceremony, and to wish the staff a happy holiday season. Prior to the president’s remarks, Mr. Carvey took the podium to conduct brief comedic impressions of the president and 1992 presidential candidate Ross Perot. \"The President's Own\" U.S. Marine Band provided music and was also in attendance.
