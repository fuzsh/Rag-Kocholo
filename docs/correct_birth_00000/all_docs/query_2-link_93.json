        "text": "Theophilus Eaton (born c. 1590, Stony Stratford, Buckinghamshire, Eng.â€”died Jan. 7, 1658, New Haven, Conn.) was a merchant who was cofounder and colonial governor of New Haven colony.\n\nAs a youth, Eaton went to London as a merchant apprentice. He began his own commercial enterprise trading with Baltic seaports, and his successes in business resulted in his election as deputy governor of the East-Land Company and also in his appointment to the court of Denmark as agent for Charles I.\n\nWhen he returned to London from his residence in Copenhagen, Eaton became interested in the settlement of New England. He was one of the original patentees of the Massachusetts Bay Company. Eaton had adopted firm Puritan beliefs, and in early 1637 he joined his boyhood friend John Davenport and several Puritan followers in migrating to New England. The group arrived in Boston in June, but instead of settling in Massachusetts Bay, they established an independent colony at New Haven (Quinnipiac) in April 1638. The next year Eaton was elected governor of the colony, and he was reelected annually until his death."
