        "text": "Bob Thomas Ford is proud to serve the New Haven, Connecticut area. New Haven is one of the United States' oldest cities, having been founded in 1638 by Puritan settlers from England. Those first streets planned and paved by the Puritans in the 1640s may still be walked on by modern New Haveners downtown at the New Haven Green, a recognized National Historic Landmark.\n\nNew Haven is also the proud home of one of the country's most prestigious institutions of learning, Yale University. Founded in 1701, it is the third-oldest college in America and only one of nine chartered before the American Revolution.\n\nNew Haven is more than just its history, though. Today, our city is home to a variety of cultural delights, from live public arts performances to diverse museums and beyond. In New Haven, you can enjoy a night on the town starting at one of our renowned restaurants then catching a show at one of our many independent theaters. If you happen to be a history buff, there is no better place to visit or live than New Haven, which offers numerous historic bus and walking tours ranging from colonial traditions to spooky ghost adventures.\n\nSurrounding the New Haven metropolitan area, you will find stunning wildlife and a host of gorgeous nature preserves, perfect for exploring in a new Ford truck or SUV. City-slickers and outdoorsmen alike find joy in New Haven, Connecticut.\n\nWhether you were born and raised in New Haven or are newly transplanted to the neighborhood, we are happy to have you in our hometown!\n\nFor all your new and used Ford automotive needs, please visit us at Bob Thomas Ford in Hamden.
