        "text": "ODESSA, Texas (KOSA) - In honor of what would have been George H. W. Bush’s 100th birthday, the Bush Family Home State Historic Site hosted a special celebration.\n\nThe celebration featured music by a local father-son duo called “Five Years Apart” and a barbecue cookout where guests enjoyed meals at picnic tables. A crowd favorite was the Crazy Sock Contest, inspired by George H. W. Bush’s post-White House fashion of wearing fun socks with bold patterns and bright colors to liven up his suits.\n\nDuring the event, members of the Texas Historical Commission offered tours of the Bush family home. The tours provided a glimpse into the Bush’s life in West Texas, from 1948 until 1957 when Marvin Pierce Bush, their last son, was born in Midland. Visitors could see the 1940s television, a Lazy Susan fridge, and George W.’s childhood bedroom.\n\nTroy Gray, Site Manager of the Texas Historical Commission, shared insights into the celebration.\n\nThe event also highlighted George H. W. Bush’s lasting legacy. Earlier in the day, U.S. Congressman August Pfluger introduced a resolution in the House of Representatives to honor the life, achievements, and distinguished public service of George Herbert Walker Bush. The resolution extends thanks and commendations to him and his family, acknowledging his positive impact on the country and the world through his decency and compassion, regardless of political affiliation.\n\nThough no official arrangements have been made yet, the Texas Historical Commission plans to hold a similar celebration for Barbara Bush on her 100th birthday next year."
