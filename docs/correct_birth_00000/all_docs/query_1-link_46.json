We offer advanced treatments, including ECMO (Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation), a machine that acts as an artificial heart and lungs for a patient, which is crucial for an infant’s life-threatening heart and/or lung problems.Yale is home to the world’s first NICU. Every year, approximately 6,000 babies are born at Yale New Haven Children’s Hospital, and more than 850 newborns are admitted to the NICU. The NICU has a capacity of 55 patients, making it the largest clinical unit in the Children's Hospital, and the largest NICU in the state. Through participation in the National Institutes of Health’s neonatal research network and other national multicenter trials, we offer patients access to the latest treatments available.",
