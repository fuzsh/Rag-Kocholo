        "text": "My Doula Philosophy\n\nSince starting my doula career in 2012 one of the most important things to me has always been YOUR informed choice. As January Harshe says, \"I do not care what kind of birth you have...a home birth, a scheduled cesarean, epidural hospital birth, or if you birth alone in the woods next to a baby deer. I care that you are supported in your choices and that you were respected.\" I want to support YOU in having the most positive birth experience for YOU.\n\nOne of the things I hear most often from the families I work with is that I have a very calming presence. Having a calm and relaxed atmosphere where you can let go and surrender to the process is one of the utmost things I strive to maintain for you.\n\nOf course, I have a bag full of tools and tricks at my disposal to aid in your relaxation and comfort, but my biggest \"trick\" is watching you and listening to you and helping to guide you on your birth journey...sometimes leading the way as you navigate tougher terrain, other times fading into the background as you and your partner hit your stride and walk in step together.\n\nI'm often asked what led me to become a doula - these two little ladies are a big part of the answer!\n\nNeither of my girls decided to follow my playbook for how I wanted their births to go. BUT, thanks to choosing the right care team, having the support of my husband, and having my amazing doulas their births were still wonderfully positive and beautiful experiences.\n\nEven when I was faced with needing to alter my plans and desires I was always met with compassion, options, respect, and support. That made all the difference in feeling like I had a positive birth that I could look back on with joy instead of a negative birth that could have had the potential to cause regret or trauma. I knew I wanted to help other families who might have to navigate those same waters to have a positive birth no matter what story their baby decided to write!\n\nIn addition, I've always loved science, particularly anatomy and physiology...I've also always loved to help friends and family when they were having their babies (in hindsight, I was probably that over-zealous, obnoxious friend...sorry guys!). When I learned what a doula was and realized I could take my love of science and pouring over research articles and evidence-based care, and I could take my love of supporting people in the perinatal period and combine them together, I knew becoming a doula was a perfect fit for me!\n\nAfter almost a decade of living in New Haven, I recently moved back to my hometown of Southington, CT along with my wonderful husband and two amazing daughters. I love being \"home\" and am thrilled that my children will grow up there and graduate from the same school that I did. Fun fact - my husband and I have been friends since we were kids!\n\nIn our downtime, we love to sing and make music, play video games, watch movies together, travel, spend time with our extended family and friends, and scream our lungs out on the rollercoasters at Six Flags!\n\nWhile birth absolutely can be fun, it's typically pretty serious business.
