        "text": "Background\n\nGeorge W. Bush is one of America’s most well-known presidents with a long political history and legacy. He has made numerous significant contributions to a wide range of America’s current legislation, particularly in terms of domestic and foreign policy. Bush was born on July 6, 1946, in New Haven, Connecticut. His zodiac sign is Cancer. He comes from a long line of politicians on his father’s side. His father, George H.W. Bush, was also an American president, and his paternal grandfather, Prescott Bush, was a Senator representing Connecticut. His family’s political career inspired him to pursue a political career of his own, but only after attending university, joining the military, and working in business.\n\nBush participated in baseball, rugby, and even cheerleading during his high school and university years. He earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in history from Yale, an Ivy League university, in 1968. After attending Yale, he received his Master’s in Business Administration from another Ivy League university, Harvard, in 1975. He is the only American president in history who has earned an M.B.A. After graduating from Harvard, he joined the Texas National Air Guard. Six years later, in 1974, he left the Air Force Reserve in Montgomery, Alabama. He then joined the world of business for nearly two decades, first establishing an oil exploration company and then managing the Texas Rangers baseball franchise.\n\nIn the 1980s, he entered the world of politics, assisting his father with Bush Snr.’s presidential campaign and then again with his father’s re-election campaign in the early 1990s. In the mid-1990s, he tried his hand at politics, and in 1995, he was elected governor of Texas. He held this position until he was elected President of the United States in 2000. During his first term as president, he responded to the terrorist attack on the World Trade Centre (also known as the Twin Towers) on September 11, 2001, by implementing a much more authoritative foreign policy that ignited the ‘war on terrorism.’ His policies drew mixed reactions, but he was re-elected for a second term in 2004. He left the White House at the end of his second term in 2009 after Democrat nominee Barack Obama won the presidential election against Senator John McCain. Since then, he has been involved with both domestic and foreign affairs but has maintained a relatively low profile."
