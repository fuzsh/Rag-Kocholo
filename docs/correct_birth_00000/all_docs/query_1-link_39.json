        "text": "We love our clients and have worked hard to build relationships with the providers they choose, throughout Connecticut!\n\n​\n\nWe've worked with every doctor, midwife, hospital and birth center in the state, dozens, and in some cases, hundreds, of times over the past 29 years, and are appreciative to be welcomed by them, as we serve their patients!\n\nAs the mother of 4, I am very slow to give advice, because after all, we are all just doing the best we can as parents right? BUT for\n\nbirth experiences I have to say that having a doula (and delivering with midwives!) are hands down the greatest investments in yourself\n\nand your baby. I have worked with Janet and two of her incredibly talented, supportive, kind and understanding doulas for 3 of my births.\n\nTo say I was completely and utterly supported physically and emotionally is just the tipping point. Having a doula allows you to labor and\n\nnot worry about what to do to next to help yourself (I mean you are a laboring woman and that's enough work!).\n\nFor example, I will share that I am a CNM myself, but in labor, I am a laboring mom, that's it! My doulas and midwives have worked\n\nseamlessly to support me through 3 unmedicated births with rebozo, position changes, supportive dialogue, and lots of smiles and laughter.\n\nFeeling safe and secure are essential during childbirth and you get to know your doula so well. I came to crave the phone chats with Dawn\n\n(our Birth Partners doula) and thought how amazing it was to process the pregnancy and prepare for the birth with someone so\n\nunderstanding and knowledgable. The fabric of my birth stories is weaved so beautifully from the team of my partner, my midwives,\n\nand my doula.\n\nYou need a Birth Partners doula, trust me on this!\n\n​\n\nJenna LoGiudice, PhD, CNM, RN, FACNM\n\nAssociate Professor\n\nEgan School of Nursing and Health Studies\n\nFairfield University\n\nBirth Partners has a proven track record with St.Vincent’s of providing doulas that are clearly committed to the empowerment of\n\nwomen and families who want to have control in their birthing experiences. Their doulas are knowledgeable, yet never intrusive, and\n\nactually partner with the healthcare team to optimize the family’s experience with us. It truly does take a village.\n\n​\n\nMelissa Melendez, BSNRN, Nurse Manager\n\nSt. Vincent's Medical Center, Family Birthing Center\n\nBridgeport, CT.\n\nAs a lactation professional, I visit many mothers in the first weeks after birth. Some of the advice I hear given by other baby nurses and doulas to these vulnerable mothers can be quite damaging to the breastfeeding relationship. Birth Partners clearly chooses and trains all of their doulas to trust and respect that breastfeeding relationship. I can always tell when a mother has used Birth Partners because she is more knowledgeable and confident in her parenting abilities. That is why Birth Partners is on the top of my referral list for doula services. New parents: you can trust them to give the extraordinary care you deserve.\n\n​\n\nAnnie Brown, FNP, IBCLC\n\nFamily Nurse Practitioner, International Board Certified Lactation Consultant\n\nAdvanced Practice Lactation\n\n​\n\n​\n\nWomen's Health Associates and Birth Partners doulas have long been allies in the care of expecting families in Connecticut. We are thrilled when our patients accept our recommendation to work with Birth Partners as we know that the family will be incredibly well-supported before, during, and after birth. Birth Partners doulas always live up their reputation as talented and tireless labor coaches and have earned the respect not only of the midwives in our practice, but also of our nursing and physician team members at Yale New Haven Hospital. We are deeply grateful to Birth Partners for their commitment to their clients and skill in helping them achieve the brith they seek. We're so lucky to have them in our community!\n\n​\n\nThe Midwives of Women’s Health Associates\n\nNew Haven, CT\n\nI first learned about Birth Partners nearly five years ago when I was in the process of becoming a midwife and wanted to also work\n\nas a doula. I was drawn to Birth Partners over other doula accreditation programs specifically because of their internship and mentorship\n\nprocesses — they had a far more comprehensive training process (encompassing significantly more than just \"hands on\" labor support)\n\nthan any other organization I could find. I feel so grateful for that internship, and still use the skills I was taught to this day. And now that\n\nI'm on the other side, working as a provider with many different doulas, I see the true difference in skill, support, and rapport\n\n(and respect) with both their clients and hospital staff that a Birth Partners doula has. I look forward to every birth with a\n\nBirth Partners doula! I can't recommend Birth Partners highly enough.\n\nHallie Mathia, CNM, WHNP-BC\n\nCircle for Life Midwifery, St. Vincent's Hospital\n\nIt is difficult to come across businesses that are professional and simultaneously nurturing and thorough. Birth Partners has accomplished this with grace, and has been an asset to many expectant families in providing support and an ease to communicate and coordinate care. They truly go above and beyond and are a strong advocate for families involved. They have managed to maintain their quality of care for years and I look forward to continue working with them for years to come.\n\n​\n\nKazuko Nakamura, ND, LAc\n\nTrumbull Naturopathic & Acupuncture\n\nAs a midwife, Birth Partners is my go-to recommendation when a client is looking for a doula. Having had a wonderful experience with Janet and Shannon myself, I know first hand the care that Janet takes in the whole process from careful selection of doulas, her personal training program and continuing education she does with her team, and then the final selection of the souls that best matches the needs and personality of the individual birthing woman. I trust Janet and have seen the amazing work her Doulas do on both sides of the birthing bed.\n\n​\n\nSara Church, CNM\n\nNorwalk Hospital Midwifery Service"
