Most families are referred to Birth to Three by their child’s primary health care provider but this isn’t required.\n\nHow do Birth to Three teams determine if a child is eligible?\n\nA professional evaluation team meets with the parent and child where the family lives. Together, they evaluate the child’s strengths and needs, often using one or more standardized tests.\n\nThe team — which includes a parent — will evaluate all areas of development, regardless of the reason for the referral. These areas include:\n\nCognitive skills — problem solving, memory, learning\n\nCommunication skills — understanding and expressing ideas, following directions, pointing, talking\n\nSocial or emotional behaviors — relationships and expressing emotions\n\nPhysical development — seeing, hearing, movements and health\n\nAdaptive skills — self-help or daily living skills\n\nIf a child is 16 months or older, they will also be screened for autism.\n\nWhat kinds of supports do Birth to Three programs provide?\n\nEach family with an eligible child will be offered an Individualized Family Service Plan (IFSP) that is tailored to the family’s priorities and daily activities. Supports are offered using:\n\nService coordination\n\nCoaching as a style of interaction\n\nNatural learning environment practices\n\nA primary service provider approach to teaming\n\nTeams can include practitioners from a variety of disciplines as needed to address the family’s outcomes for their children, including:\n\nSpeech-language pathology\n\nDevelopmental therapy (teachers)\n\nPhysical therapy\n\nOccupational therapy\n\nSocial work\n\nEarly Intervention supports are usually provided in the home, but they can also be provided in childcare settings or other settings that are natural for the child and family.\n\nDo families pay for Birth to Three supports?"
