        "text": "(Also Drexelius or Drexel.)\n\nAscetic writer, b. at Augsburg, 15 August, 1581; entered the Society of Jesus 27 July, 1598; d. at Munich, 19 April, 1638. He was professor of humanities and rhetoric at Augsburg and Dillengen, and for twenty-three years court preacher to the Elector of Bavaria. His writings enjoyed an immense popularity. Chief among them was his \"Considerationes de Æternitate\" (Munich, 1620), of which there were nine editions; in addition to these Leyser printed 3200 copies in Latin and 4200 in German. It was also translated into English (Cambridge, 1632; Oxford, 1661; London, 1710 and 1844) and into Polish, French, and Italian. His \"Zodiacus Christianus\" or \"The Twelve Signs of Predestination\" (Munich, 1622) is another famous book but there seems to have been an edition anterior to this; in 1642 eight editions had already been issued and it was translated in several European languages. \"The Guardian Angel's Clock\" was first issued at Munich, 1622, and went through seven editions in twenty years; it was also translated extensively. \"Nicetas seu Triumphata conscientia\" (Munich, 1624) was dedicated to the sodalists of a dozen or more cities which he names on the title page; \"Trismegistus\" was printed in the same year and place; \"Heliotropium\" or \"Conformity of the Human Will with the Divine Will\" came out in 1627; \"Death the Messenger of Eternity\" also bears the date 1627. His fancy for odd titles shows itself in other books also. Thus there are the \"Gymnasium of Patience\"; \"Orbis Phaëton, hoc est de universis vitiis Linguæ\". The only work he wrote in German was entitled \"Tugendtspregel oder Klainodtschatz\" (Munich, 1636). He has also a \"Certamen Poeticum\"; Rosæ selectissimarum virtutum\"; \"Rhetorica Coelestis\"; \"Gazophyacium Christi\". There are in all thirty-four such books. Other works are \"Res bellicæ expeditionis Maximiliani\" (1620), and some odes and sermons.\n\nDe Backer, Bibl. de la c. de J., 1646-55; Sommervogel, Bibl. de la c. de J., III, 181 sqq.\n\nT.J.
