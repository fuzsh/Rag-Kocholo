        "text": "All concert photos by Drechsel Photography.\n\nWILMINGTON — Hundreds of people came out to the Brooklyn Arts Center in downtown Wilmington, to see soulful rhythm and blues musician Anderson East on election night.\n\nAnderson East, along with opening act, American country music singer Brett Cobb, played to a full house Tuesday night in one of the final 98.3 FM The Penguins shows of the concert season. In celebration of Election Day, anyone who brought their “I Voted” sticker to the concert was automatically entered to win a pair of seasons passes to The Penguin’s 2017 Greenfield Lake concert series.\n\nNearly a third of concertgoers showed up to the concert with their voting sticker. On Wednesday morning, radio hosts Kim Swinny and Beau Gunn picked the winner of the prize on-air. Congratulations to Laurie Cerami, who was named the winner of the 2017 season passes.\n\n“A huge thank you to the community for their support of the show and participating in the electoral process,” said Gunn, host of 98.3 FM The Penguin and market manager for Local Voice Media in Wilmington.\n\nAnderson East, whose real name is Michael Anderson, recently released his debut album “Delilah,” produced by Dave Cobb. Cobb has also just recently produced albums from Chris Stapleton, Jason Isbell and Sturgill Simpson. Out of Athens, Alabama, Anderson East’s hits include “Quit You,” co-written with Chris Stapleton, as well as “Devil in Me” and “Satisfy Me.”\n\nListen to Anderson East’s full interview on 98.3 FM The Penguin, ahead of Tuesday night’s concert."
