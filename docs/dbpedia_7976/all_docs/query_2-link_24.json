We seek to create a space for e√ective and ongoing conversations between North and South, Natives and non-Natives, academics and activists, throughout the Americas and the Paciﬁc region. We are committed to complicating and transgressing the disciplinary and epistemological boundaries of established academic discourses on Native peoples. This series encourages symmetrical, horizontal, collaborative, and auto-ethnographies; work that recognizes Native intellectuals, cultural interpreters, and alternative knowledge producers within broader academic and intellectual worlds; projects that decolonize the relationship between orality and textuality; narratives that productively work the tensions between the norms of Native cultures and the requirements for evidence in academic circles; and analyses that contribute to an understanding of Native peoples’ relationships with nation-states, including histories of expropriation and exclusion as well as projects for autonomy and sovereignty. An empathetic yet critical examination of how struggles for federal recognition, and the conﬂicts over the state policies associated with them, have a√ected three tribes in central Louisiana, Brian Klopotek’s Recognition Odysseys is a most welcome addition to our series. By analyzing federal recognition policy as a particular project of national and racial power that reproduces colonial relations, Klopotek critically contributes to conversations around indigeneity and nationhood in the United States. He shows as well how\n\nthe shining promises often attached to the achievement of federal recognition can sometimes ring hollow for the people involved. Finally, his historically and regionally grounded study of speciﬁc Native peoples and their experiences provides both empirical and theoretical depth to the criticisms leveled at the ﬁelds of cultural, ethnic, and American studies for tending to lump indigenous peoples into a broader category of racial minorities, without attending to the di√erences between race and indigeneity. Klopotek’s ability to combine a critical and politically committed analytical perspective with a deep empathy for the Tunica-Biloxis, the Jena Band of Choctaws, and the Clifton-Choctaws who are at the heart of his story provides us with an important model for the kind of methodologies we wish to highlight and foster in our work.\n\nviii\n\nabout the series\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nI wish to thank ﬁrst and foremost the Indian people of Louisiana whose stories I discuss in this book. I feel an overwhelming debt of gratitude for the generosity of Tunica-Biloxi, Jena Choctaw, and Clifton-Choctaw tribal members in particular, but also the Choctaw-Apache, Apalachee, Houma, Caddo-Adai, and Coushatta tribal members who took the time to work with me in the early stages of this project. All the people I talked with are ethnohistorians in their own right, and I thank them for modeling tribal knowledge, strength, vision, and persistence for me. Special thanks are due to John Barbry, Brenda Lintinger, Cheryl Smith, and Theresa Clifton Sarpy, without whom this book would not have been possible. In addition, thank you to Aimee and Lydia Barbry, Donna and Michael Pierite, Jean-Luc Pierite, Elisabeth Pierite, Rose Pierite White, Anna Juneau, Marshall Sampson Sr., Inez Sampson, Earl Barbry Sr., Becky Wambsgans, Greg Lintinger, Emily Lintinger, Alfred Barbre, Steve Johnson, Debbie Johnson, Joe Barbry, Harold Pierite Sr., David Rivas Jr., David Rivas Sr., Robert Barbry, Dante White Owl, Daniel Barbry, Linda Bordelon, Mary Jackson Jones, Jerry Jackson, Christine Norris, Christy Murphy, Clyde Jackson, Barbara Chapman, Rusty Smith, Corine Tyler, Myrtlene Shackleford, Roy Tyler, Amos Tyler, Norris Tyler, Les Sarpy, Sabrina Webb, and Betty Clifton, who each contributed to this work in ways large and small. I would like to express my deep esteem for several people who have passed away since I began this research: Mary Jackson Jones, Jerry Jackson, Roy Tyler, and Norris Tyler were each helpful and inﬂuential on this project, and each beloved\n\nby their families and communities. I am sure that even the people who guided me the most would have written these stories di√erently, but I hope I have done them justice in this book. Any shortcomings are my own, however, and not theirs. This project began as a dissertation at the University of Minnesota, where Brenda Child, David Wilkins, Jean O’Brien, Carol Miller, Riv-Ellen Prell, and Patricia Albers made up an exceptionally talented and intellectually generous dissertation committee. I am particularly grateful to Brenda Child for the advice, guidance, and support she has given since we both arrived at the University of Minnesota in 1996. I am grateful to Jay Gitlin for early guidance on this road in college. Thank you too to my incredible friends from the University of Minnesota, who have provided a stimulating intellectual community and bonds that just keep growing, especially Anne Martinez, Matt Basso, Angela Smith, Heidi Stark, Jill Doerﬂer, Tiya Miles, Hokulani Aikau, Matt Martinez, and an honorary Gopher, Joe Gone, among many others.

Current procedures require tribes petitioning for recognition to document their history, race, culture, and genealogy and submit the documents for semipublic review to the O≈ce of Federal Acknowledgment (ofa) of the U.S. Bureau of Indian A√airs, making this tiny federal o≈ce the unelected arbiter of Indian identity in many ways.∞ Scathing reviews of ofa’s e≈cacy have come from more than two dozen Congressional hearings, two investigations by the Government Accountability O≈ce, various journalists, scholars, and tribes, and even the head of the Bureau of Indian A√airs. ofa wields enormous material and discursive power as it structures access to federal resources while drawing on and contributing to American racial thinking, making federal recognition policy an urgent site of scholarly inquiry. This book examines the impact of federal recognition policy on three small Indian tribes within ﬁfty miles of each other in central Louisiana that have petitioned for recognition through ofa. The Tunica-Biloxi Tribe (federally recognized in 1981), the Jena Band of Choctaw Indians (federally recognized in 1995), and the CliftonChoctaws (currently petitioning for federal recognition) share a mix of similarities and di√erences in size, historical experiences, racial composition, cultural persistence, and various social health indicators that allows for revealing direct comparisons. Important\n\nState and federally recognized tribes of Louisiana. The Houmas are currently divided into several closely related communities represented by distinct tribal governments. Map by Derek Miller.\n\nnew insights into the political and racial dimensions of Native American identities emerge from their stories, with signiﬁcant implications for the study of race and indigeneity more broadly in the United States. At its most basic level, federal recognition (also called, more formally, acknowledgment) establishes a political and legal relationship between a tribe and the United States that carries particular rights and responsibilities for both parties under federal law: it a≈rms the status of a tribe as an indigenous nation with inherent rights to self-government in its homeland, but it simultaneously validates the colonial authority of the United States 2\n\nintroduction\n\nover the nation. While the federal-tribal relationship has routinely been a means through which the United States has exerted control over tribes, the government-to-government relationship also a√ords tribes unique standing to protect their political, legal, and cultural rights. Because formal federal recognition procedures were not established until 1978, most of the 560-plus federally recognized tribal governments in the United States never went through any formal evaluation of their status as tribes.≤ The United States government simply accepted their tribal status as obvious almost any time Congress, the president, a federal court, or the Bureau of Indian A√airs or its predecessors interacted with a tribe based on its status as an Indian nation through treaties, lawsuits, or policy enactments.≥ In the 1830s, for example, the United States did not ask for evidence that the Cherokees were an Indian tribe; that was an accepted fact. While federal recognition of many tribes was maintained as the status quo with little fanfare, the political status of other tribes became more and more nebulous through the nineteenth century, as their ability to militarily uphold their sovereignty slipped away, removal treaties rendered remaining Indians politically enfeebled, and Indians became increasingly dominated by local nonIndian peoples and governments, to the extent that the federal government ceased to deal with them as distinct tribal nations. Other tribes never entered into any formal relationship with the United States, having lost too much of their land and military strength through earlier colonial encounters to be of concern or value to the federal government, while still other nonfederal tribes had their federal status terminated at some point through governmental ﬁat or oversight. To lack status as a tribe within the meaning of federal law means to live without the limited protections and beneﬁts available for tribes under that law—tribes must be federally recognized to exercise legal jurisdiction over their own land, be exempt from state taxes, or operate high-stakes gaming facilities, for example. But because federal recognition has been as much a means of domination and subjugation as a means of protection for tribal sovereignty, its appeal to tribes has ebbed and ﬂowed with shifts in federal Indian policy and race relations in the United States more generally.∂ Tribes seeking recognition since formal procedures were created in 1978 have been regularly funneled through ofa by Congress, the courts, and other o≈ces in the executive branch that used to regularly decide independently to recognize tribes, making the o≈ce the bearer of a troubling amount of deﬁnitional authority. At ﬁrst glance ofa’s criteria for tribal recognition seem reasonable (see Appendix): they require that a group demonstrate ‘‘a reasonintroduction\n\n3\n\nable likelihood’’ that its members descend from an Indian tribe or tribes, that surrounding populations have considered them Indians, and that they have been socially and politically cohesive and distinct. Racial, cultural, and political shifts since ﬁrst contact—many of which have been a result of assimilationist pressures from Anglo-Americans—have made it at times less obvious to outsiders who counts as an Indian tribe or nation in the present day, and these contested deﬁnitions and interpretations have been at the core of the controversy over recognition policy. Scholars and tribal members have challenged both the criteria themselves and ofa’s administration of them, identifying a series of signiﬁcant problems: the criteria have been applied inconsistently, so that what qualiﬁes as proof of tribal existence in one case often does not in the next; the level of proof required to meet individual criteria keeps going up, and ofa does not inform tribes of this until after the fact; certain sta√ members have been characterized as incompetent and unqualiﬁed; there is evidence of pre-decisional bias; ofa serves as prosecutor, defense, and judge; the criteria for recognition are much more stringent than the precedents on which they claim to be based; the sta√ is too secretive about its sources and ﬁndings; ofa expects unrecognized tribes to have the same form as recognized tribes; the regulations rely too heavily on non-Indian observations about petitioners, observations that are bound to rigid conceptions of ‘‘authenticity’’; ofa will not accept oral history as evidence; the process favors petitioners without African ancestry; and petitions are reviewed at such a sluggish pace that decades pass before determinations are made on active petitions.∑ On the other end of the spectrum are those who feel that ofa is incompetent because it recognizes too many tribes too quickly. Politicians in Connecticut, pandering to the white backlash against tribal sovereignty and casino gambling, have led this assault, hijacking scholarly criticisms of ofa and misconstruing them for their own use.∏ Senators Chris Dodd and Joe Lieberman have introduced legislation to place a moratorium on recognition decisions until problems with the process are solved, and allegedly even threatened to remove Secretary of the Interior Gale Norton from o≈ce if she did not reverse a recognition decision on the Schaghticoke tribe.π Attorney General Richard Blumenthal, an ardent leader of Connecticut’s anti-tribal attacks, has testiﬁed before Congress on the matter and vowed to support the legal battles of Connecticut towns against tribal entities. These politicians have received a chilly reception from federally recognized tribes, since their posturing very transparently expresses anti-tribal and antigambling sentiments much more than any real concern with the fairness of the recognition process.∫ 4\n\nintroduction\n\nTribes have invested millions of dollars, decades of labor, and immeasurable emotional energy into their petitions for federal recognition, providing ample reason for close scholarly attention to the matter. This book builds upon established critiques of recognition policy, taking them as a starting point as it moves beyond policy study to explore the limits and opportunities of both recognition and nonrecognition in tribal life.Ω Though recognition has acquired a transformational aura, seemingly able to lift a tribe from poverty and cultural decay to wealth and revitalization through federal funding, casino development, new protections for tribal sovereignty, and federal a≈rmation of tribal identity, the cases of the three tribes examined here reveal that reality has been more complex. First, transformation and revitalization need to be understood more broadly as ongoing processes for federal and nonfederal tribes, so that the event of a federal recognition decision is placed in the context of a longer trajectory of change in tribal histories. Second, while transformation after recognition can be signiﬁcant, it is largely gradual, occasionally compromising, and always incomplete. Both federal and nonfederal tribes are deeply a√ected by the other people and events that shape this world; recognition does not shield tribes from racism, colonialism, or other social forces, just as federal nonrecognition does not prevent tribes from participating in revitalization movements or developing their political and economic infrastructure. Moreover, recognition consistently undermines certain aspects of traditional tribal cultures, especially in the areas of government and the regulation of community boundaries, suggesting the need for careful attention to the negative aspects of federal recognition as well. Plainly delineating what recognition can and cannot do helps frame recognition status as one factor in tribal life, returning a degree of agency to both federal and nonfederal tribes that is absent in more deterministic narratives. Beyond the immediate impact of a recognition decision, the tensions and contradictions of the federal recognition process provide opportunities to scrutinize the explicit production of race, nation, and power it entails. Recognition policy can usefully be thought of as a battle of competing racial projects, following the discussion by Omi and Winant of a racial project as an attempt to deﬁne the boundaries of racial identity for the purposes of structuring race relations and controlling the distribution of resources based on those racial deﬁnitions.∞≠ Federal Indian policy always inﬂuences the direction of social, political, and cultural transformation among Indians, and federal acknowledgment policy speciﬁcally has been particularly signiﬁcant in inﬂuencing Indians in Louisiana because of the large number of nonfederal Inintroduction\n\n5\n\ndians and competing racial projects there, but Indian people have always challenged, shaped, and responded to the impositions of the federal government by asserting their own visions of tribal life and the federal-tribal relationship. At its heart, this research is a discussion of those tribal challenges to federal attempts to deﬁne and control the boundaries of Indian identity and the ways that context has shaped the lives of Louisiana Indians. Omi and Winant theorize racial formation as an ongoing, multisited, multiscaled process of competition among various racial projects, reminding us to account for the entire array of racial projects, rather than just examining the primary conﬂict between these particular tribes and a government agency, or between Indians and whites in general. Federal recognition policy is representative of a particular kind of racial project, but it is far from being the only racial project a√ecting Louisiana tribes. Of particular importance to this book is that racial projects emanating from—or directed toward—other communities of color, other tribes, and other individuals matter deeply for Indians. Earlier work in the various ﬁelds of ethnic studies understandably tended to focus on the relationship of each group to whites, but recent work conﬁrms that a similarly rich set of knowledge lies relatively untapped within other racial relationships.∞∞ For the three tribes in this book, discourses around blackness and whiteness shaped the boundaries of Indian identity in ways that have not previously been explored, leaving profound implications and opportunities for e√orts at social justice and future academic research. White supremacist ideology in particular has been a central racial project shaping relations among racial and ethnonational groups in the United States.∞≤ While popularly the terms ‘‘white supremacist’’ and ‘‘white supremacy’’ typically conjure up images of Klan robes and neo-Nazi skinheads, the terms as they are used in this book (and increasingly in the ﬁeld of ethnic studies) refer primarily to the everyday ways of thinking and acting on an entrenched, often unspoken, unconscious, and reﬂexive set of beliefs about white racial superiority, beliefs carried even by people who do not consider themselves racist, including people of color.∞≥ It is an ideology that understands white people and their ancestors as morally, intellectually, politically, and spiritually superior to nonwhites, and therefore entitled to various forms of privilege, power, and property. It wields power even in the absence of explicit legal protections because it so often goes unnoticed, making social and political inequalities seem ‘‘natural.’’∞∂ The ideology of white supremacy is the set of thoughts, while white supremacy is the set of relations that the 6\n\nintroduction\n\nideology creates as people act on these thoughts. The ideology and the practice are closely related and mutually constituted, so that a change in one can precipitate a change in the other. But the process of changing ideology— deeply cultural and layered as it is—and of changing practice—heavily premised on the social relations that the ideology constantly reproduces—has been a monumental challenge.∞∑ Thus making visible both whiteness and the ways it accumulates privileges and resources to whites has been a central project in ethnic studies over the last two decades, and it is a task that this book takes up as well.∞∏ In Native American studies scholars have tended to focus on the political status of tribes as sovereign nations, external to the racial politics of the United States, which has tended to divert scholarly attention from racial theory in the ﬁeld. Such an approach has been warranted time and again, since too many people understand Native Americans as simply racial minorities without any categorical distinction from other communities of color in the United States. Indigeneity distinguishes Native American historical experiences and grievances against the United States from those of other groups, and nationhood provides the basis for the ongoing government-togovernment relationship with the United States.∞π The distinctive relationship between Indian nations and the United States is encoded in federal law in many ways, beginning with the Constitution and continuing through a range of legislation and federal court decisions that determine the extent of tribal governmental independence. The hundreds of ratiﬁed treaties, which can only be entered into by nations (not minorities) and only apply to the speciﬁc nations that participated in them (rather than to the racial group called Indians), provide perhaps the most easily accessible evidence of the distinction. Legally, politically, and morally, indigeneity and nationhood set Native Americans apart from other racialized minorities. Tribal sovereignty has been paramount in Native American studies because it protects Native peoples from dissolving into the political mass of the United States—a central concern of indigenous groups living under Anglo-American racism and colonialism. In arguing for people to understand indigenous nations as distinct from racial minorities, however, we have too often ignored the racial components of Native American lives. While the racial relationship between Indians and whites has been explored often, attention to broader processes of racial formation and the position of Native peoples within constellations of race relations would help develop a framework for e√ectively incorporating racial theory into Native American studies, allowing for new insights even while introduction\n\n7\n\nmaintaining the centrality of indigeneity and sovereignty. Native peoples have both a racial status and a political status in the United States; the many shared experiences of racial discrimination with other communities of color attest to the racial status of Indians, just as the many aspects of Indian experiences that are unique to indigenous groups justify a distinction. As an example, in Louisiana, where during the Jim Crow era local whites and Washington o≈cials alike tried to erase or downplay tribal rights by racializing Indians as ‘‘colored,’’ Indians fought for access to education and economic opportunity in part by engaging in anti-black racism to distinguish themselves from blacks. There was a complicated tangle of racial projects and colonialism at work in this situation, and an investigation that does not attempt to comprehend each will fail to shed light on a problem that has created grief, shame, anger, and antagonism in each community. Likewise, federal recognition policy in the present day presses tribes to distance themselves from blacks—even pressing tribal members who do not have African ancestry to distance themselves from tribal members who do—in order to have their Indian racial and political identity validated. The racial and political are closely tied. Attention to the racial elements of these stories reveals how Indian anti-black racism undermines tribal well-being on many levels that would not be apparent otherwise. Since race has been integral to culture in the United States since its inception, every tribe has been deeply a√ected by the multiple racial projects of the nation in ways that have not been interrogated thoroughly, creating a gap that has only recently begun to be addressed in the ﬁeld.∞∫ Native American studies will beneﬁt immensely from the ongoing robust exploration of this component of tribal existence. At the same time as Native American studies has avoided racial theory, the various allied ﬁelds of ethnic studies, American studies, and cultural studies have not demonstrated a solid understanding of the distinction between indigenous nations and racial minorities, and scholars in these ﬁelds often fail to highlight how the relationship between the colonizer and the indigenous is both central to and distinct from other racial projects. The routine failure to account for the distinction between race and indigeneity is the failure of these ﬁelds to provide an adequate framework for people contemplating indigenous issues or indeed racial formation in the United States more broadly. Such failure is not simply benign neglect; Haunani-Kay Trask has noted how ignoring the distinction between race and indigeneity in Hawai’i has sabotaged valid, distinct, and critical Native Hawaiian grievances.∞Ω Robert Warrior further notes that attempts to erase that distinction under the rubric of 8\n\nintroduction\n\n‘‘inclusion’’ in ethnic studies similarly erase the unique value of the relationship of indigenous to colonizer as a ‘‘miner’s canary’’ for the general political atmosphere in the United States, because tribal rights are linked to federal law and policy in distinct ways, making Indians deeply vulnerable to shifting political winds to an unusually direct extent.≤≠ Thus in addition to meriting study on its own terms, the relationship of indigenous to colonizer matters for every community, because it provides insight into the history, scope, scale, and function of related racial projects in the United States. The experiences of the Tunica-Biloxis, the Jena Band of Choctaws, and the Clifton-Choctaws reveal that the relationship between federal recognition policy and American Indian racial and tribal identity is more complicated than at ﬁrst appears. The ongoing discourse in Indian country about the boundaries of Indian identity is an important function of Indian and tribal self-regulation, and ofa is part of that process. As Mark Miller has noted elsewhere, criticism of acknowledgment regulations contains an apparent conundrum, in that the regulations largely reﬂect the views of members of recognized tribes who worked with and for the Bureau of Indian A√airs to help develop the criteria.≤∞ The predominantly Indian-run bia today has begun to shed its historical image as the epitome of bureaucratic incompetence and white paternalism, but exerting colonial power remains part of the bia’s legacy and function too, whether intentionally or not, as ofa policy demonstrates. The existence of supposedly objective federal recognition procedures clouds the multiplicity of indigenous perspectives on the issue; indigenous people, whether federally recognized or not, hold a range of views so broad as to be oppositional at points, yet federal recognition policy gives the appearance of settled precision. Federal bureaucrats thus become colonially empowered voices in Indian identity debates. The conversation is not resolvable in the way that the federal government attempts to resolve it, because there are so many competing deﬁnitions and racial projects at play. This only makes it all the more urgent for ofa to establish liberal recognition procedures so that tribes are being evaluated in a way that does not simply cater to the most restrictive deﬁnitions of tribal status. To move beyond the tightly bound deﬁnitions that o≈cial discourses of tribal existence imply, equal attention needs to be paid to uno≈cial discourses in which nonfederal tribes are embraced and supported as Indians by other tribes and other Indians, even if they are opposed and shunned by some too.≤≤ Variables such as genealogy, blood quantum, family histories, connection to place, size and cohesion of community, skin tone and other racially loaded introduction\n\n9\n\nfeatures, political histories, and cultural markers factor into the calculus of tribal existence in varying degrees, depending on who is doing the calculating, in what context, and for what purpose. All tribes, recognized or not, are subject to multiple discourses, and federal tribes sometimes contend with much the same racial, political, and cultural challenges to their identity as nonfederal tribes do.≤≥ Once it is understood that every tribe is subject to multiple discourses and is multiply constructed, the subjective and deeply invested position of o≈cial federal discourse becomes more apparent. Tribes are composed of the same people with the same history before and after a recognition decision, and the continuities outweigh the changes that come with recognition. Transformation and revitalization e√orts in place before an ofa decision proceed under di√erent circumstances depending on the decision, but they proceed nonetheless. Recognition e√orts have been but one segment of tribal persistence struggles that began long before the bia existed and will continue long after a recognition decision is rendered for or against a tribe. Recognition needs to be reframed in this manner so that we can better understand how ofa decisions matter and how they do not. Perhaps more important for tribal well-being is not the decisions themselves but how the tribes respond to those decisions and the racial, cultural, and political cues that come to them through the process. As it happens, there is both more and less at stake in ofa decisions than is apparent at ﬁrst blush—more, because of the centrality of recognition to identity and wellness across the spectrum of Indian communities; and less, because the ﬁnancial beneﬁts of recognition are smaller and slower than typically imagined for most tribes. However, if tribes can work toward these goals with or without recognition, and if recognition does not bring with it the beneﬁts that people have imagined, tribal attention might turn inward, focusing on means of promoting community-deﬁned conceptions of wellness that do not rely upon and endorse federal authority, as an increasing number of nonfederal and federal tribal members have suggested. To illuminate these issues of authority and entitlement, race and indigeneity, and o≈cial and uno≈cial discourses, this book examines how recognition policy and recognition itself have been a part of the revitalization and transformation of the Tunica-Biloxi Tribe, the Jena Band of Choctaws, and the Clifton-Choctaws. Taken together, their histories illustrate the varied impacts of the process on social and political structures, community cohe-\n\n10\n\nintroduction\n\nsion, cultural revitalization projects, identity, and economic health in Indian communities. After reviewing the legal and political development of federal recognition policy, the book moves into discussions of each tribe’s history. The discussion of the Tunica-Biloxis is somewhat longer than the others both because of the tribe’s long and pathbreaking struggle to achieve recognition, and because it has had over twenty-ﬁve years of experience with federal recognition. Similarly, the discussion of the Clifton-Choctaws is the shortest of the three because as yet the tribe has no recognition decision or post-decision years to discuss. The Tunica-Biloxi discussion proceeds chronologically from the early years of contact with colonial groups, when the tribe’s ancestors belonged to several tribes that eventually formed a community where the tribal reservation now exists. The predecessor tribes were all living in small enough groups to be overlooked during the removal era of the 1830s and 1840s. They posed little threat to American settlers by then and occupied a small amount of land, so relations with the federal government were never formalized through treaty agreements.≤∂ While this arrangement allowed the tribes to remain in their home area, it also meant that they lacked the status of nations in the eyes of the federal government. Being ignored by the federal government was a mixed blessing: the Tunicas and allied tribes were never removed or sent to boarding school, but neither were they a√orded the meager beneﬁts and protections that the federal government developed for Indian tribes over the years. Ernest Downs, a scholar of Tunica history who helped the tribe to compile a petition for recognition in the 1970s, notes that the Tunicas ‘‘began to realize that Federal recognition was going to be absolutely necessary for them to be able to carry on . . . as early as 1917’’ because of a clash between state inheritance laws and tribal customs.≤∑ While there had been sporadic e√orts before this time in response to white encroachment on their land and sovereignty, the chiefs of the tribe consistently sought federal recognition from the Bureau of Indian A√airs thereafter. The Tunica-Biloxis had compiled a formal petition for recognition by 1976, using earlier precedents for recognition within the bia as a guideline, but the bureau waited until it had developed standardized procedures for tribes seeking recognition before reviewing the Tunica-Biloxis’ case. The Tunica-Biloxi Tribe was the third tribe in the country recognized under the new procedures, the ﬁrst in Louisiana.\n\nintroduction\n\n11\n\nTunica-Biloxi tribal members have beneﬁted culturally from recognition in identiﬁable ways. Tribal identity has always been fairly strong, though distinct markers of tribal culture had been fading since even before the death of the last Tunica speaker in the early 1950s, and a considerable number of tribal members had moved away from the reservation by the 1970s. They have steadily built up their community strength since recognition, though expectations for what recognition could accomplish were fairly low when they were recognized in 1981. Access to the small amounts of federal money and programs available for things like health care, housing, and construction of a tribal government building helped them to address a few of their most pressing needs. Perhaps more signiﬁcantly, federal recognition helped the tribe to intervene in a lawsuit to win custody in 1985 of a collection of looted grave goods known as the Tunica Treasure, an event that has become an immense source of pride and a focal point of Tunica-Biloxi identity. In the repatriation of the grave goods, elements of historical trauma based in racism and colonialism become visible, and the redemption and healing that accompanied the repatriation of the grave goods parallel the impact of recognition on the Jena Choctaws. As a federally recognized tribe, the Tunicas were able to open a casino in 1994, an event that has dramatically a√ected the tribe. The creation of jobs with decent pay in the area has helped tribal members move to the reservation, where they can renew and maintain important family and tribal relationships, and casino money now funds important cultural projects such as a summer camp, an annual powwow, and a new Cultural and Educational Resource Center. On the other hand, a few tribal members have expressed concern that the inﬂux of nonlocal tribal members looking for jobs has the potential to dilute Tunica-Biloxi cultural identity. E√ects on the centers and boundaries of tribal communities are among the perhaps unforeseen results of recognition on tribal identity and cultural persistence. The Jena Choctaws did not have the same kind of activist chiefs as the Tunica-Biloxis, so their e√orts to gain federal recognition as a tribe did not begin until much later. Some of the tribe testiﬁed before the Dawes Commission at the beginning of the twentieth century, and for several years in the 1930s a local white woman ran a school for Choctaw children using money secured from the Bureau of Indian A√airs, but that was the extent of Jena interactions with the federal government. Education activism was a surprisingly consistent arena for the development of tribal political activism and racial identities in Louisiana during the 12\n\nintroduction\n\nNew Deal. Tribes in Louisiana had a variety of experiences, but in most instances Indians sought enrollment in white schools and refused to enroll in black schools. In such cases Indians endorsed white conceptions of both blacks and whites, undermining in unnoted ways both their racial position and their political position as indigenous nations. The Jena Band’s brief interlude of federal services further illustrated the extent to which federal anti-black racism, not just southern Jim Crow laws, inﬂuenced tribal and racial identities in the South. The Jena Choctaws were eventually integrated into white schools during the Second World War, and tribal activism virtually disappeared for several decades. Political activism resurged in the early 1970s, though, and in 1974 the Jena Band organized formally to seek government funds and services. The Jena Choctaws toyed with the idea of seeking federal recognition, but that seemed unattainable and even a little bit dangerous at the time. Some members of the older generation were leery of diving headlong into the federal relationship, knowing its coercive history, so recognition plans took a back seat to other projects. Further, Jena Choctaws did not feel that they needed recognition to validate their identity, which is often cited as a reason for seeking recognition; half the tribe still spoke Choctaw ﬂuently at the time, so their identity as Choctaws was never in doubt. By the 1980s tribal feelings about recognition began to shift, and e√orts to complete a petition began in earnest. In the early 1990s the Jena Choctaws decided that the tribe would beneﬁt from partnering with a gaming company that would provide it with the money needed to attain recognition and help it to develop a lucrative casino after recognition was granted. Partnerships of this sort have become fairly routine since the advent of tribal casinos, but the practice has brought with it a host of problems. White responses to tribal casinos are often deeply imbued with racial and colonial discourses, in which people and nations of color are either supposed to be subordinate to whites or forbidden to have any rights di√erent from those of whites. Politicians in Louisiana often curry voters’ favor by invoking intertwined conceptions of white supremacy and federal authority to oppose federal recognition of Indian tribes on the grounds that it facilitates tribal gaming. The basic question of tribal existence inherent in ofa procedures becomes a referendum on tribal gaming instead. Still, with the help of money from gaming investors and the support of the Mississippi and Oklahoma Choctaws, the Jena Band received federal recognition in May 1995, after the tribal casino movement was under way nationally introduction\n\n13\n\nand in Louisiana. In contrast to the modest expectations of tribes in the 1980s, by the time of Jena Choctaw recognition, acknowledgment decisions had become so closely associated with casino development that anything short of instant wealth would be experienced as failure. At this writing, though, the tribe still has no gaming facility, and prospects for opening a class III casino in the near future appear slim.≤∏ The divergence between expectations and reality caused tumult and frustration in the tribe for years, but amid the chaos a sense of equanimity and resolve emerged, and projects designed to serve tribal needs have gone forward successfully in several arenas, even without the luxury of casino funds. The impediments that the tribe has faced are a reminder that recognition is only a small part of a broader racial and political relationship with the United States, and that the e√ects of recognition are more complex than they at ﬁrst appear. Yet recognition supports tribal wellbeing to the extent that it helps to alleviate historical trauma, and the tribe has been persistent in pursuing its goals of political strength, cultural vitality, social cohesion, and economic growth, just as it was before the recognition decision. The extent to which tribal response shapes tribal futures is evident from the example of the Jena Choctaws. Contemporary Clifton-Choctaw recognition e√orts began with a chance meeting of tribal elders in a hospital in Alexandria in the 1970s, and the narrative in this book moves backward and forward from that point. Following the lead of other Louisiana tribes, the Clifton-Choctaw tribal government incorporated as a nonproﬁt and submitted a letter of intent to petition for federal recognition in 1978. Until 1970 the Clifton-Choctaws had been extremely isolated, attending only their own community school, which went to eighth grade, because they were not allowed in white schools in Rapides Parish and refused to attend black schools. The resulting low educational attainment rate, combined with an economic bust in the timber industry, forced many people to move away to ﬁnd work in the 1960s. Facing the same economic, educational, medical, and cultural concerns as other nonfederal Indians, they hoped that organizing to attain services available for Indians could help their community stay together and thrive economically and culturally. The Clifton-Choctaws are still not close to achieving federal recognition, more than thirty years after they initially organized. Their political and cultural histories are not as well documented as those of the Tunica-Biloxis and Jena Choctaws; they are clearly a distinct group with a persistent Indian identity, but their political forms have tended toward the informal and they have not retained the range of cultural markers that the federal process 14\n\nintroduction\n\nexpects from Indian tribes. In that sense they pose a challenge to federal procedures largely based on producing evidence of the very traditions that they lack, and the federal procedures likewise pose a disturbing challenge to the Clifton-Choctaws’ sense of self. Issues like those confronting the CliftonChoctaws lead to questions about internal and external determinations of identity and indigenous status, about the place of multiple discourses in tribal senses of self, and about whether federal recognition is an emancipatory or decolonizing project at all. Like the Tunica-Biloxi Tribe, a signiﬁcant portion of the Clifton-Choctaw community has African ancestry, which has led some outsiders to classify the community as black or ‘‘Redbone’’ rather than Indian. While the bia claims that blackness plays no role in determinations of tribal status, tribes with African ancestry face many obstacles that tribes without black ancestry do not face. Some members of each of the three tribes discussed here have responded to the racial projects underlying these obstacles by distancing themselves from blacks through anti-black rhetoric (even though two of the tribes do have a signiﬁcant portion of tribal members with African ancestry), while other tribal members dismiss this rhetoric as racist and unfair. Examining the echoes of black-Indian relations in educational segregation that reverberate through recognition e√orts provides insights into the interwoven nature of racism and colonialism that will help e√orts to understand and undermine both. With over three hundred groups now involved in the petitioning process and a rate of resolution of approximately two cases a year, ofa lacks adequate resources for completing its increasingly di≈cult caseload, much less assisting tribes with their petitions. Moreover, with signiﬁcant gaming revenues at stake and tribes spending more than $10 million on petitions, a small tribal community such as the Clifton-Choctaws uninterested in gaming partnerships is severely outmatched in a contest with federal o≈cials, so achieving recognition will be an uphill battle. Yet without recognition the CliftonChoctaws have not withered but rather have proceeded to pursue community goals of educational attainment, economic development, and cultural revitalization through other available means. Certainly federal status would be welcomed, but their right to exist is not dependent upon it. Seen in this light, it is easier to understand Clifton-Choctaw recognition e√orts as a component of broader goals, much as the recognition movement in general is a component of a broader revitalization campaign in Native America. As with other tribes, how the Clifton-Choctaws respond to federal policy matters introduction\n\n15\n\ndeeply for their racial and political identity. That tribal life continues at Clifton outside the federal domain despite troubling racial and political cues from the federal government suggests that tribal goals can be—and indeed have consistently been—pursued with or without federal recognition, putting recognition in perspective of the longue durée without undermining its signiﬁcance for tribal well-being. One of the goals of my research has been to provide information about tribal life after involvement in the federal administrative acknowledgment process, whether a tribe attained recognition or not. Side-by-side examination of tribal experiences after each case has been reviewed reveals the potential beneﬁts and hidden risks of recognition—the range of advantages, tensions, and problems that emerge in the economic, cultural, social health, and political realms. While this book discusses inherent problems with the O≈ce of Federal Acknowledgment and suggests remedies, the more important lesson is that indigeneity persists independently of federal policy, and tribal identities have proven to be too variable for the federal legal structure to be capable of determining dependably.≤π Attempting to mold academic, legal, and popular Indian and American deﬁnitions of tribal identity into one unwieldy set of criteria, the bia has assumed the task of creating an o≈cial line that clearly marks the boundaries of Indian identity, an impossibility given the diverse and complex identities of Indians around the country. The impact of attempting to do so nevertheless has been enormous.\n\nMethods and Methodology I am a nonfederal Choctaw with roots in Sabine Parish, Louisiana, so this project developed out of personal interest. In 1998 I began conducting exploratory interviews with leaders of seven tribes in Louisiana that either were or had been federally nonrecognized, and settled on these three because of their proximity and comparability. I am not a member of any of these communities, though my family history has ﬂavored my research in many ways. Formal interviews with tribal members provided the bulk of information about tribal perspectives on federal recognition and current tribal a√airs, and the interviews were complemented by archival research and ethnographic ﬁeldwork.≤∫ Most of the people whom I chose to interview formally were tribal leaders of one sort or another, and many had served in tribal government positions over the years.≤Ω Interviewing primarily tribal leaders gave me access to the internal workings of the petitioning process and the tribal 16\n\nintroduction\n\ngovernment to some extent, so this might be called an intellectual history of the recognition movement.≥≠ Further work is needed to bring in the important voices of the many other tribal members who are not represented here, but the interviews provide a useful view that centers contemporary tribal perspectives, shifting the focus away from ofa and toward tribal experiences with federal recognition policy. I have maintained a collaborative approach to research and writing whenever possible in order to present stories embodying some essential truths that make sense to tribal members. I have tried to center tribal members’ understandings of the federal recognition process as they have expressed it to me in formal interviews and informal conversations. I sent copies of chapters regarding each tribe to members of each community for comments and suggestions, and I addressed tribal concerns where possible when they were expressed.≥∞ Though courtesy and ethics obviously come into play, collaboration also makes for better research, because it provides an added layer of expert review. That said, it is important to acknowledge the limits of this kind of work in representing the voices of others, because even someone who supports the project as a whole will not necessarily be interested in reviewing academically oriented manuscripts, not everyone had the opportunity to comment, and some tribal members would disagree with assertions that I make.≥≤ The recentness of some of the events represented here is a reminder that these histories are neither ﬁnished nor complete, that this is a snapshot of tribal life in motion, and that some people and stories are more visible than others. The resolutions to the stories that I tell will prove inadequate in some respects, reinforcing the notion that the stories of the Tunica-Biloxis, the Jena Choctaws, and the Clifton-Choctaws belong to the people themselves and not to me or to the pages of this book. Christine Norris, the current chief of the Jena Choctaws, illustrated this point nicely when she said that the elders in her community were always wary of people who came in to ask them about their culture and history. ‘‘They always felt that the people would take advantage of them. They were there to gather information for books or whatever, but that it was always twisted. What came out in print was not what they really said. That’s why they were very close-mouthed to nonIndians. Because they felt like, they just want to know what we do, how we live, and they’re going to take that and try to use it and say they know Indian ways and culture.’’ I ask the reader to keep in mind that these pages contain only my discussion of those parts of the people’s lives that they have chosen to introduction\n\n17\n\nshare with me or that are available in the historical record, rather than as the ﬁnal word on what it means to be a Jena Choctaw, a Tunica-Biloxi, or a Clifton-Choctaw. The written medium sometimes creates the illusion that people and text are co-terminal, that a single, objective narrative exists and can be described, and I would rather remind the reader of this illusion here than insert myself into the stories recounted throughout the text. Recognition policy forces us to confront race and identity in ways that are sometimes di≈cult to talk about, and doing so in a public forum will make some people uncomfortable.≥≥ Indeed, it makes me uncomfortable at times, but discomfort can be a useful tool that directs our attention to underlying problems. Troubling matters such as Indian anti-black racism in education and recognition activism appear in this book not as spectacle but as a means of moving us toward healing and decolonization. Anti-black racism is part of the legacy of white supremacy that all our families—across the racial spectrum—have inherited, and transformation in race relations and indigenous futures lies in taking responsibility for problems like it rather than burying them. Similarly, many Indians around the country have been trying to cope with centuries of colonization, and federal and nonfederal Indians alike are sometimes self-conscious when trying to reconnect with aspects of aboriginal heritage lost in the colonial encounter. Because it is harder to maintain the economic and political structures that sustain tribal cultural cohesion without communal land and with fewer schools, tribal enterprises, or other institutional supports, nonfederal Indians have been particularly vulnerable to the forces of assimilation in the contemporary era. Federal recognition policy stokes anxiety, shame, anger, grief, and feelings of inadequacy over cultural loss when it is not understood for what it is: a particularly colonial racial project emanating from a particularly colonial source. Ngugi Wa Thiong’o describes a similar situation among postcolonial Africans, where, he assures his readers, ‘‘the present predicaments . . . are often not a matter of personal choice: they arise from an historical situation.’’ It follows, as he suggests, that solving problems of this kind requires not simply personal transformation but a broader break from colonial ideologies and the people who espouse them.≥∂ When we recognize the historical and structural basis of these feelings, we can understand how they a√ect federal and nonfederal Indian tribes, and more conﬁdently renew e√orts to support and maintain indigenous identities.\n\n18\n\nintroduction\n\nchapter 1\n\nThe Origins of Federal Acknowledgment Policy\n\nPrelude The passage of the Indian Reorganization Act (ira) in 1934 marked a substantial turn in federal Indian policy. Rejecting and condemning the antitribal policies practiced by previous administrations of the O≈ce of Indian A√airs, as the bia was formerly known, the newly installed administration of John Collier successfully lobbied Congress to legislate a new policy that supported Indian tribalism, as Collier saw it. The act professed to serve ‘‘all persons of Indian descent who are members of any recognized tribe now under federal jurisdiction, and all persons who are descendants of such members who were, on June 1, 1934, residing within the boundaries of any Indian reservation, and shall further include all other persons of one-half or more Indian blood.’’∞ The wording created a problem for bureaucrats in the O≈ce of Indian A√airs, since they took it to mean they had to decide who was or should be under federal jurisdiction and just how to make that determination. Though such a distinction had existed previously in practice, as certain Indian groups had extensive relationships with the federal government while others were ignored, the ira articulated the divide in ﬁxed terms. Without a determination of recognition from the federal government, tribes would not be eligible to access the ira’s provisions. According to this clause, however, members of federally nonrecognized tribes had the opportunity to receive beneﬁts as Indians if they could prove they were half-Indian or more, a provision that o√ers an interesting prelude and parallel to the modern practice of\n\ndetermining tribal eligibility for federal services. Collier, who considered the issue of how exactly the o≈ce would make this determination ‘‘an administrative problem of some complexity,’’ outlined procedures for the o≈ce to follow: The evidence upon which a determination of blood degree may be made divides naturally into ﬁve classes (1) tribal rolls . . . accepted [by us] as accurate . . . which record the percentage of Indian blood; (2) testimony of the applicant, supported by family records, . . . showing blood degree; (3) a≈davits from persons who know the applicant[’s] family background; (4) ﬁndings of a qualiﬁed physical anthropologist based on examination of the applicant; (5) testimony of the applicant and supporting witnesses, tending to show that the applicant has retained a considerable measure of Indian culture and habits of living. . . . burden of proof on applicant. Usually, however, investigation of the applicant’s claim will be required. . . . Where the available evidence is insu≈cient to establish degree of blood, the Commissioner may appoint as a member of the [investigating] committee a competent physical anthropologist to examine the applicant. . . . In reviewing the ﬁndings of the investigator or investigators, the Commissioner of Indian A√airs will exercise administrative discretion in determining what comparative weight shall be given to the various kinds of evidence. Where the genealogical or biological data still leave doubt as to the applicant’s claim, the commissioner will consider whether or not the attitude of the applicant and his manner of living tend to show the inheritance of Indian characteristics.≤ Following these procedures, in 1936 Collier sent Carl Selzer, a professor of physical anthropology at Harvard, to investigate the applications of 209 Lumbees, then known as ‘‘Siouan Indians of Robeson County’’ by the O≈ce of Indian A√airs, and make determinations regarding who among them displayed the appropriate physical characteristics to be considered one-half or more Indian in ancestry. While there were thousands more in the area who might have asked to be recognized as Indians, Selzer examined only those who had actually applied. After various tests and measurements of the hair, teeth, skin, blood, skull, and other physical features, Selzer decided that twenty-two of the applicants had the appropriate physical characteristics to qualify as at least half-Indian. Predictably, among those rejected were several full siblings of those who had been accepted.≥ 20\n\norigins of federal acknowledgment policy\n\nSimilar tests to determine precise Indian ancestry were conducted in other Indian communities around the country, with similar results. Most notably, Albert Jenks and Aleˇs Hrdliˇcka performed tests on residents of the White Earth Chippewa reservation in northern Minnesota in 1917 to determine who among them was ‘‘full-blooded.’’ The results of their examinations not only invalidated tribal social categories and genealogical understandings but also contributed to precipitous land loss by declaring certain individuals mixedblood and therefore ‘‘competent’’ to sell their allotments.∂ The reservation was reduced from its original 837,000 acres to less than 10 percent of that at present, in part because of the anthropologists’ racial (re)classiﬁcation of hundreds of members who had lost their land patents to con artists and timber barons. The impact on the White Earth band has been devastating.∑ Racial anthropometry such as that practiced in these years has since been characterized as a product of the racialized and racist value systems of the eugenics movement, masquerading as impartial, objective science.∏ Within a single lifetime the absurdity of these ‘‘scientiﬁc’’ evaluations of Indians and biological measures of ‘‘race’’ has become evident. Yet the bia’s O≈ce of Federal Acknowledgment, which is currently responsible for determining whether groups can be counted as Indian tribes, deploys many of the same misguided ideas about race and identity as Collier did in the 1930s. The same racial and colonial logic informs federal recognition policy, irrevocably damaging Indian communities now just as it did then. The bia is still attempting to use academic assessments to draw a powerful, federally enforced line between tribal and nontribal people, but it will be instructive to remember earlier attempts to ‘‘have the illusion provided by expert opinion that all decisions, however complex, are fairly and logically made.’’π\n\nThe Development of Federal Recognition Policy and the Federal Recognition Movement The federal-tribal relationship has evolved through more than two centuries of treaties, legislation, policy, and case law,∫ but for present purposes the important point is that once the federal government acknowledges the existence of a tribe, tribal sovereignty is assumed, and a set of laws and policies governs the way the United States interacts with that tribe, though the federal government has historically failed to uphold most of its own rules that could be interpreted to protect tribal sovereignty.Ω Through the years the relationship between sovereign Indian nations and the sovereign United States government has been consistently revamped and redeﬁned, but the basic origins of federal acknowledgment policy\n\n21\n\ncharacterization of the relationship as sovereign-to-sovereign remains the guiding principle from the tribal point of view. From the point of view of the federal government, the relationship has been more ambiguous. While the sovereign-to-sovereign principle remains, the federal government has consistently whittled away the boundaries of indigenous tribal sovereignty in much the same way as it has carved away indigenous lands. Various doctrines, policies, and Congressional acts impede tribal sovereignty at all levels, which is how tribal sovereignty arrived at its current muddled state. Policy shifts and court decisions have persistently altered the contours of tribal sovereignty and thus the desirability of federal recognition for Indian people. While federal Indian policy occupies many uneasy spaces between tribal sovereignty and plenary federal power, the signiﬁcant issue to contemplate is the implication of semi-sovereign trust status for tribes trying to achieve recognition. Trust status, which implies that the federal government is entrusted with protecting the small nations within its borders, carries a contradictory assortment of implications. It simultaneously recognizes tribal sovereignty and asserts its lack; seeking federal recognition suggests tribal resistance as well as tribal acquiescence to federal authority. Recognition entitles Indian tribes to funding and social services and protects tribal political authority and trust land against state and local governmental intrusion, and each of these beneﬁts help tribes to survive by making it feasible for people to live decent lives in their home communities, maintaining important relationships with other tribal members. Federally recognized tribes have limits, however, on how funding and land can be used and the extent of tribal authority, which diminishes the tribe’s ability to make culturally appropriate decisions. They have less ﬂexibility in determining community membership, and they must develop and administer formalized legal codes to ensure that they are meeting formal federal standards rather than using informal ideals to regulate community behavior.∞≠ Moreover, even a brief survey of federally recognized tribes reveals that trust status is hardly a panacea. Unrecognized tribes, with none of the beneﬁts of federal recognition, lead di√erent struggles. They exist within the same colonial and racial order as recognized tribes, but they have little formal recourse for protection of their culture, values, or sovereignty aside from whatever internal authority they can exert. They have fewer resources available to ﬁght social ills, and they have trouble maintaining organizations and securing and maintaining a land base. In most cases it matters little that the federal government does not limit 22\n\norigins of federal acknowledgment policy\n\nunrecognized tribes in their exercise of power, since they have virtually none in the ﬁrst place. It seems as though they can only gain by petitioning for recognition, but the negative e√ects of recognition on a tribe’s internal sovereignty and cultural integrity, along with the inherent acquiescence to federal authority, are often forgotten in the e√ort to secure funding for health, social, and economic programs. What might be called a recognition movement emerged from the wreckage of the termination and relocation era of the 1950s, when the federal government sought to erase tribalism and indigenous political status altogether.∞∞ Federal and nonfederal tribes alike responded to this era of repressive assimilationism and conformity by reasserting their sovereignty at the local and national levels.∞≤ Nonfederal tribes have continually sought to establish individual relationships with the United States government, even through the termination era, and occasionally regional e√orts were made, but it was not until the 1960s that federally nonrecognized tribes began to consider themselves an interest group on a national level and to work together on shared issues of nonrecognition.∞≥ The American Indian Chicago Conference (aicc), a gathering of more than ﬁve hundred Indians that included at least twenty nonfederal Indians and produced the ‘‘Declaration of Indian Purpose’’ in 1961, was an important forum in several ways for developing a national recognition movement, just as it was for Indian activism across the country.∞∂ First, it provided moral support and some validation from other Indians and from anthropologists for the federally nonrecognized groups represented at the conference.∞∑ Second, it put nonfederal Indians in touch with each other and with federal Indians, and they were able to encourage one another and develop new ideas together. Chief Calvin McGhee, a longtime activist from the Poarch Band of Creeks of Alabama, then federally nonrecognized, stated that he had no idea there were ‘‘so many Indians in the same boat’’ before he attended the conference. Seeing recognition as a matter of broad historical circumstances rather than the shortcomings of an individual tribe was of immeasurable value.∞∏ While it is fair to say that the aicc catalyzed a growing federal recognition movement, the movement actually began with various regional e√orts that had been initiated by tribes in North Carolina, Virginia, New England, and elsewhere through the years. In Louisiana, the Tunicas took a leadership role in the 1920s, when Tunica subchief Eli Barbry attempted to form a coalition of tribes in an e√ort to secure federal assistance. The 1930s saw a ﬂurry of activity in the state, with Houmas, Tunicas, Choctaws, and Coushattas reorigins of federal acknowledgment policy\n\n23\n\npeatedly seeking federal assistance for Indians. ‘‘Recognition’’ was not the term used, but the goals and concepts were the same. What the aicc provided to the Indian people who had been working on these issues for several generations was a larger forum in which to network and strategize with other tribes, especially those who were similarly situated, and the movement continued to grow from there.∞π By the time Vine Deloria Jr. published Custer Died for Your Sins in 1969, the nationwide recognition movement had grown considerably. Deloria mentioned the surprise appearance of the federally nonrecognized Tiguas (Ysleta del Sur Pueblo) at the convention of the National Congress of American Indians (ncai) in 1966 near their land in El Paso as an eye-opening event. Their persistence for three hundred years in the middle of El Paso, with only occasional federal recognition, convinced attendees that tribes were not doomed to vanish, as termination rhetoric had begun to suggest to many of them. Heartened by the concept ‘‘that tribes were really entities that had no beginning or end, . . . the ncai set its sights to contact as many groups as possible in the eastern portion of the United States,’’ including the Tunicas.∞∫ Deloria asserted that the Bureau of Indian A√airs had also begun ‘‘to push for recognition of bands which had always been eligible for federal services but which had been caught between reservations during frontier days.’’∞Ω Though he does not o√er examples of the groups they had reached, the bia extended recognition to seven tribes between 1962 and 1974, including the Coushatta tribe of southwestern Louisiana,≤≠ while Congress extended recognition to an eighth and restored one terminated tribe, conﬁrming Deloria’s notion that there was some attempt under way at the federal level to respond to requests for recognition that had been ongoing for a number of years.≤∞ Tribes in the 1960s and 1970s sought recognition from the federal government through the ‘‘informal’’ administrative channels supposedly available to federally nonrecognized tribes (as opposed to Congressionally terminated tribes, who can only have their federal recognition restored through an act of Congress), but not all were able to achieve it. Since there was no formal process for tribes to follow until 1978, the decision over whether to recognize a tribe was generally at the discretion of key bia personnel. The bureau had standards for evaluating whether to acknowledge that certain groups should be served by the federal government as Indian tribes, despite claims that no formal procedures were ever drawn up. These standards were somewhat similar to the criteria that would eventually become codiﬁed as the formal recognition procedures, since both were supposedly based on deﬁnitions of 24\n\norigins of federal acknowledgment policy\n\nIndian tribes sketched in the 1930s by Felix Cohen in his capacity as solicitor for the Department of the Interior, but there was not a signiﬁcant consistency of practice in applying these criteria to petitioning tribes.≤≤ Cohen noted that eligibility for federal services as an Indian tribe ﬁrst became an issue when the O≈ce of Indian A√airs attempted to determine who was eligible to organize under the Indian Reorganization Act (ira) of 1934, which he had helped draft. The deﬁning legislation for the ‘‘Indian New Deal’’ under the commissioner of Indian a√airs John Collier, the ira limited beneﬁts to ‘‘recognized’’ tribes and individual Indians of half or more blood, as mentioned earlier. The executive branch decided that because of this phrasing, it needed a way to decide who was eligible for services or protections under acts passed by Congress. After Cohen determined that the political branches of the federal government (Congress and the executive branch, including the secretary of the interior) both had authority to acknowledge tribes, the O≈ce of Indian A√airs in 1937 extended recognition to the Mole Lake Band of Chippewas of Wisconsin, a federally nonrecognized group at the time, so that it could organize under the ira, setting a clear and unchallenged precedent allowing the bia to recognize a tribe as long as Congress had not speciﬁcally terminated it.≤≥ While the bia had recognized a string of tribes from 1962 to 1974, it began reconsidering its authority to recognize tribes sometime after extending recognition to the Sault Ste. Marie Chippewa tribe in February 1974. By August of that year an attorney from the solicitor’s o≈ce reconﬁrmed the authority of the bia to extend recognition, but this did not resolve the matter of how and when this authority would be exercised.≤∂ The bureau still needed to establish consistent procedures for making recognition decisions. The bureau used Cohen’s determinations of federal practice as a guideline. Cohen noted that in cases where it was not immediately clear to the bia whether a group qualiﬁed as an Indian tribe, an opinion as to its tribal status should be requested from the solicitor of the Department of the Interior. He further suggested that the considerations which, singly or jointly, have been particularly relied upon [by the solicitor and others in the bureau] in reaching the conclusion that a group constitutes a ‘tribe’ or ‘band’ have been: That the group has had treaty relations with the United States That the group has been denominated a tribe by act of Congress or Executive order. origins of federal acknowledgment policy\n\n25\n\nThat the group has been treated as having collective rights in tribal lands or funds, even though not expressly designated a tribe. That the group has been treated as a tribe or band by other Indian tribes. That the group has exercised political authority over its members, through a tribal council or other governmental forms. Other factors considered, though not conclusive, are the existence of special appropriation items for the group and the social solidarity of the group.≤∑ The extent to which the modern regulations are based on these understandings will become evident in the coming chapters, but for the time being I note that the guidelines are fairly speciﬁc in terms of which evidence had been used in the past to determine tribal existence, but still very unclear in terms of instructions for most of the tribes seeking recognition in the 1970s. Would meeting any one of the criteria su≈ce, or would a tribe have to meet several or all of them? What types and levels of evidence would the bia accept? Who would decide, and how long would a decision take? Lack of clarity made it easy for the bia to be evasive and hard for tribes to force the issue, hence the lack of ‘‘consistency of practice in giving ‘federal recognition’ ’’ noted by the bia in 1974.≤∏ Even with the solicitor’s opinion of 1974 and the precedent of previous unchallenged recognition of Indian tribes, the Department of the Interior still claimed at various times afterward that it had no unambiguous authority to recognize tribes.≤π Despite this inconsistency, there are indications that by early 1975 the bia had begun to develop formalized procedures. The associate solicitor for Indian a√airs, Reid Peyton Chambers, stated as much in a response to a request for help in restoring federal recognition for the Clatsop and recognizing the Lower Band of Chinook Indians. After suggesting that the groups follow established informal guidelines in preparing information in support of a bill for restoration and recognition, he wrote that ‘‘recognition standards are currently undergoing review within the Department.’’≤∫ This is the earliest indication available that the department was working on revising recognition procedures. By May the endeavor was fully under way. At that time Kent Frizzell, acting secretary of the interior, wrote to Senator Henry Jackson regarding the Snohomish tribe’s petition for federal recognition, stating that ‘‘standards and procedures for determining requests such as the\n\n26\n\norigins of federal acknowledgment policy\n\nSnohomish petition have never been established. Accordingly, this O≈ce has undertaken a general legal study of the concept of recognition in order to aid in the development of such standards and procedures if possible.’’ He added, optimistically, ‘‘it is intended that all pending requests for recognition will be dealt with following completion of this study within the next month or two.’’≤Ω The new phase of research at the bureau was more concerned with the obligations of the federal government to federally nonrecognized tribes, and accelerated as a result of the Passamaquoddy decision of 11 February 1975.≥≠ The Passamaquoddy decision changed the playing ﬁeld by saying that federal laws regarding Indian tribes applied to all tribes, whether the federal government had previously recognized the obligation or not. Thus the Passamaquoddy successfully argued that the cession of their land in 1794 to the state of Maine (then part of Massachusetts) should have been null and void, since it was carried out in contravention of the Indian Trade and Intercourse Acts that stated relationships with Indian tribes to be solely the province of the federal government. While the decision itself was simply a declaratory judgment that the Indian Trade and Intercourse Acts applied to the Passamaquoddy Tribe and that the acts established a trust relationship between the United States and the tribe, the decision did force the federal government to reassess its obligations to tribes that it had not served previously—any Indian tribe that existed in the United States had a trust relationship with the federal government, whether or not the government had historically acknowledged it.≥∞ The decision brought a wave of new petitions to the o≈ce, as tribes gained hope that they would ﬁnally be eligible for federal protections and services. Shortly after the Passamaquoddy decision the American Indian Policy Review Commission (aiprc) provided further impetus for the bia to revisit federal recognition policy. In response to issues highlighted by the armed occupation of Wounded Knee by Indian activists in the spring of 1973, two Indian legal activists, Kirke Kickingbird and Vine Deloria Jr., urged Senator James Abourezk of South Dakota, a non-Indian raised on the Rosebud Sioux Reservation, to initiate a review of all aspects of federal Indian policy and make suggestions to Congress for reforming and revising them.≥≤ Composed of eleven ‘‘task forces,’’ each dedicated to a separate area of Indian law, policy, or administration of services, the commission had ambitious goals. Task Force 10 of the commission was charged with assessing the needs of federally\n\norigins of federal acknowledgment policy\n\n27\n\nnonrecognized and terminated Indians around the country and developing a coherent and just policy that the federal government could follow in determining its responsibilities to these tribes. Beginning work in August 1975, the sta√ of Task Force 10 was composed of several Indians from communities that did not receive federal services: Jo Jo Hunt (Lumbee), Robert Bojorcas (Klamath), George Tomer (PenobscotMaliseet), and John Stevens (Passamaquoddy). The work of the task force was exceptional inasmuch as it provided a forum for discussing federal recognition issues by people who knew them best, as well as large amounts of data and testimony from numerous tribal members and expert tribal assistants across the United States. Task Force 10’s impact on the bureau’s federal recognition policy is hard to gauge. At a minimum the task force pressed the issue for the bureau through sharp criticism and provided it with a solid needs assessment for nonrecognized tribes around the country. As indicated above, the bureau had been (very slowly) developing what it believed would be su≈cient standards for review of tribal status based on the expanding number of groups petitioning for recognition, but Task Force 10’s information forced the bureau to rethink what its recognition standards would look like and what its obligations would be toward those tribes not currently receiving services.≥≥ In its own ﬁnal report, however, Task Force 10 provided recommendations that could not realistically be used by the bia. For instance, it never recommended that formalized criteria and procedures be instituted for tribes to follow in petitioning for recognition. Instead it recommended that all distinctions between federally recognized Indians and federally nonrecognized (including terminated) Indians be erased, since the Passamaquoddy decision clearly indicated that such distinctions had no basis in law. Task Force 10’s deﬁnition of Indians to be served included all those descended from persons indigenous to the United States.≥∂ This deﬁnition reduced Indian identity solely to biological ancestry, though, which was not typically the way Indian people or Indian nations deﬁned themselves or had been deﬁned by others. Further, the bia refused to open its service pool to just anyone calling himself or herself Indian without evidence, for to do so would be just as arbitrary and capricious as a decision not to recognize Indian tribes at all. The reality stated by Ted Jojola, that ‘‘no other people . . . have ever had to reestablish and rea≈rm their identity as many times as the American Indian,’’≥∑ remains frustratingly relevant because of the political status, rights to land, and other beneﬁts tied to American Indian tribal status. 28\n\norigins of federal acknowledgment policy\n\nThe ﬁnal report of the aiprc (as opposed to the earlier ﬁnal report of Task Force 10), issued in May 1977, does eventually recommend the establishment of standards for use in determining whether a given group of Indians should be treated as a tribe under federal law.≥∏ Here the recommended standards were again too liberal, since they demanded that any group recognized as a tribe by any other tribe or state, county, or local municipal government should be automatically recognized as a tribe by the United States. The legitimate point being made was that ‘‘the bia has no authority to refuse services to any member of the Indian population,’’≥π and that if left to their own standards the federal bureaucrats would almost certainly be too stringent in deﬁning Indians to be served. But it would be unwise to leave the government with absolutely no discretion in deciding whether to give political status and resources intended for Indians to any group claiming to be an Indian tribe that could persuade a completely uninformed city council to vouch for it. Moreover, there was no indication of what would happen if city and state governments disagreed about whether a group was a tribe. The task force’s recommendations were not implementable in that regard.≥∫ The task force pressed for resources to be provided to petitioning tribes to help them complete the research necessary to compile a defensible petition, and in this they were apparently successful. The aiprc ﬁnal report noted the obstacles that lack of education and funding created for a tribe that would have to perform an enormous amount of research to document its history for a recognition petition.≥Ω To this end petitioners were directed to apply to the O≈ce of Native American Programs (later the Administration for Native Americans of the U.S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare) for funds to perform research in support of their petition, and many groups have used these funds almost exclusively to pay for their research. Whatever its impact on the eventual policies adopted by the federal government, Task Force 10 further stimulated the recognition movement and provided people from tribes not currently receiving federal services with a degree of hope that at some level the federal government was looking into their situations. Task Force 10 tried to provide as much information as it could during site visits and hearings held around the country, and it gathered critical information and testimony that had not been gathered before. The hearings were important meeting grounds that helped make the recognition movement more cohesive, and helped to legitimate the concerns of the tribes involved. This was the ﬁrst time the needs of federally nonrecognized Indians as a group had been studied in detail and by sympathetic people, and the ﬁnal origins of federal acknowledgment policy\n\n29\n\nreport helped situate their struggles within the broader struggles of Indians in the United States. The aiprc, combined with growing complications and disputes from the eastern land claims, litigation from the Stillaguamish tribe,∂≠ pressure from the ncai, and increasing petitioning e√orts of nonfederal tribes around the country, induced the bureau to establish uniform procedures for recognition, and the bia squirmed as the stakes of recognition decisions rose.∂∞ By February 1976 the secretary of the interior was claiming that the doi did not have the authority to recognize Indian tribes, and therefore decided to propose legislation that would explicitly grant the department that authority and ‘‘establish rather restricted standards or criteria to be applied in determining whether a Tribe should be recognized.’’∂≤ In July 1976 it was reported orally to an attorney for an inﬂuential organization called Small Tribes of Western Washington (stoww) that yet another solicitor’s opinion demonstrating secretarial authority to recognize tribes was being drafted.∂≥ In June 1977, the month after the release of the aiprc’s ﬁnal report, the bia published draft acknowledgment regulations in the Federal Register that provided recourse only for tribes seeking to establish that they had already been and should continue to be federally recognized, despite the clear statement in the Passamaquoddy decision that the Indian Trade and Intercourse Acts, and thus the federal trust relationship, applied to all tribes, whether the federal government had previously recognized them or not.∂∂ The response from tribes, attorneys, and academics to the initial proposed regulations, in addition to the comments collected at public hearings held around the country, was ‘‘so overwhelming’’ that the bia completely revised the regulations and published them again as a new set of ‘‘proposed regulations,’’ inviting a second round of comments.∂∑ On 5 September 1978, after a year of public comment and review, ﬁnal procedures were set that attempted to allow more broadly for the acknowledgment of any group that could demonstrate its existence as an Indian tribe from historical times to the present following o≈cial criteria.∂∏ The bia conceded that drawing a line between tribes and non-tribal Indian communities could be very di≈cult. There are numerous ways to deﬁne tribal existence, and many were discussed over the course of developing the new procedures, but the bureau ﬁnally settled on what it believed would be the best criteria for determining whether a group could demonstrate having maintained political and social solidarity as an Indian people throughout its history. The bia clariﬁed that this process was designed to recognize Indian 30\n\norigins of federal acknowledgment policy\n\npolities, and that ‘‘failure to be acknowledged pursuant to these regulations does not deny that the group involved is Indian. It means these groups do not have the characteristics necessary for the Secretary to acknowledge them as existing as an Indian tribe and entitled to rights and services as such.’’∂π The statement that race and polity are not equivalent is an accurate one, but one must challenge nonetheless the viability of the statement that ‘‘the failure to be acknowledged . . . does not deny that the group involved is Indian.’’ The racial and colonial authority of the federal government creates a particularly powerful racial project that determines for many purposes whether a group can in fact be accepted as Indian or avail itself of beneﬁts and protections intended for indigenous peoples. While federal status remains one of many discourses on Indian identity, it is still an incredibly powerful one because of the material, political, and legal beneﬁts tied to it and the deﬁnitional authority that it carries. Its discursive and legal e√ect is to ‘‘deny that the group involved is Indian’’ in many contexts, whether intended or not.\n\nThe Racial and Tribal Politics of Federal Recognition The national recognition movement must be understood as a part of—and a product of—the political and creative surge in Indian arts, literature, cultural production, tribalism, historical writing, and activism known as the Indian renaissance that began in the early 1960s and has lasted to the present day. The Indian renaissance has its roots in a variety of sources, including the continued activism of tribal leaders in response to termination policies, the American Indian Chicago Conference, the formation of organizations such as the National Indian Youth Council, the broader social and political movements of the 1960s, and the educational achievement of a growing number of Indians. The term ‘‘Indian renaissance’’ denotes the renewed vigor in American Indian tribal identities, political e√orts, and artistic production in the face of decades of repression from all quarters.∂∫ This renewal did not honor the boundary between federal and nonfederal Indians. For federally nonrecognized Indians, one of the most signiﬁcant ways to participate in the Indian renaissance was to assert their strength of identity, reinforce tribalism, and pursue political justice on behalf of their tribe by working for federal recognition. Not all unrecognized tribes pursued this strategy, but a good number became convinced that recognition was the linchpin to tribal persistence and renewal of political strength. The movement for recognition has consistently alarmed a fair number of leaders from tribes with long-standing relationships to the federal governorigins of federal acknowledgment policy\n\n31\n\nment. Responding to the placement of Lumbees in certain Indian preference positions, Roger Jourdain, the longtime tribal chairman of the Red Lake Chippewas, complained in 1975 that ‘‘as it now stands because of certain legislation, any group of people who want to call themselves Indians can be Indian and derive beneﬁts which should go to land based, federally recognized Indians.’’∂Ω Jourdain’s assertion was by no means unique. The theme had been sounded by numerous other leaders of recognized tribes before Jourdain’s statement, and has been reiterated since. In fact, leaders of recognized tribes founded the National Tribal Chairmen’s Association in 1971 at least partially in response to the threat to their sovereignty that they perceived from federally nonrecognized tribes and urban Indian coalitions, which they believed were attempting to ‘‘water down the deﬁnition of an Indian.’’∑≠ Task Force 10 of the aiprc was ultimately not very inﬂuential in the federal arena precisely because of these sentiments. A key incident at the ncai convention in Portland, Oregon, in 1975 demonstrates the reception that the task force was given in certain quarters. A poignant memorandum from George Tomer, Task Force 10 specialist, to Ernest Stevens, aiprc director, details the degrading experiences that the members of nonfederal tribes endured there. Prior to the actual decision of the Task Force to attend the ncai Convention as a member of a discussion panel on ‘‘Federal Recognition,’’ the task force members and specialist had carefully considered the following: 1. The possible constructive ramiﬁcations of attending a National Congress of American Indians initially designed to serve the interests of all American Indians; 2. The possible destructive—and endangering—aspects of any position paper written by ncai in face of the harsh realities of modernday practices and pseudo-ideologies of the body politic in ‘‘Indian Country’’; 3. The grim possibilities of being ‘‘shouted o√ the podium’’ by merely being associated with a task force investigating the subject area of ‘‘terminated and nonfederally recognized’’ Indians; and most importantly; 4. The vague feeling that something would happen in Portland, Oregon which could negatively a√ect Task Force #10 directly or indirectly, either immediately or in the intermediate future.\n\n32\n\norigins of federal acknowledgment policy\n\nIndeed it would have been my extreme pleasure to say ‘‘Yes, there were ‘constructive ramiﬁcations’ while attending ncai . . . Yes, there was an attempt to ‘shout us o√ the podium,’ but our friends came to rescue us from the bad-guys . . .’’; Only, this world we live in is hardly a soap-box melodrama. To paraphrase Mr. Allen Sockabasin, Tribal Governor of the Indian Township Passamaquoddys: I’ve been to a lot of National Indian meetings, but I’ve never felt so outof-place and so goddam frustrated . . . We participated in the workshop immediately after the spokesmen for United Southeastern Tribes, Inc. had spent about one-half hour of workshop time in the room assigned for the workshop in an obvious attack on Commissioner Dial and Jo Jo Hunt, Task Force #10 chairwoman. The experience prior to the workshop was very demeaning and put us on the defensive. Ms. Hunt attempted to respond to some of the accusations but she had even not heard all of them. She was the only Commission employee to speak in defense of Lumbee people, Commissioner Dial and herself. This left little doubt in anyone’s mind the kind of support we have.∑∞ Later in that same meeting the ncai passed a resolution opposing federal recognition of the Lumbees and the disbursement of funds to ‘‘organizations that are not Federally recognized Indian Tribes.’’∑≤ Yet the ncai president, Mel Tonasket, noted the ncai’s support in 1976 for the Passamaquoddy tribe, then federally nonrecognized, stating that ‘‘our stand must not exclude consideration of the valid but nonfederally recognized Tribes and groups,’’ and in fact the ncai had previously recognized the Lumbees, and would recognize them again in later years.∑≥ Rather, the ncai only opposed ‘‘wholesale and indiscriminate recognition of every group claiming to be Indian.’’∑∂ While there is goodwill from some federal tribal leaders, skepticism and antagonism exist alongside it. Indian leaders have said that they do not support services for federally nonrecognized Indians, and have then proceeded to say that there are a number of federally nonrecognized Indians deserving of federal recognition and services. If there are legitimate nonfederal tribes, those tribes ought to be receiving full federal services immediately, but the multiple conﬂicts over Indian identity produce a common default position that a person is probably not a real Indian until the federal government conﬁrms that he or she belongs to a tribe. Such a position carries an inherent willingness to ignore the needs of nonfederal tribes for the origins of federal acknowledgment policy\n\n33\n\nsake of expedience and a misguided faith in federal decision making on this single issue. The stigma of federal nonrecognition is di≈cult to erase; some tribal groups are not universally considered Indians even after they are federally recognized.∑∑ The Tulalip Tribe of Washington has been a key opponent of petitioning tribes in the Paciﬁc Northwest, beginning with the Stillaguamish Tribe in the 1970s, and it continues to oppose recognition of more Puget Sound tribes to the present day. In 1976, after opposing recognition of the Stillaguamish, the Tulalips grudgingly accepted the Stillaguamish into the inner circle of recognized tribes. The Tulalips’ service manager, Francis J. Sheldon, issued a statement to the e√ect that they accepted the federal designation of the group as an Indian tribe. In the same letter, however, he argued that the Tulalips still believed ‘‘that if a group of people have left their culture, disappeared into the general society, and only now are resurfacing because there is money around, then th"
