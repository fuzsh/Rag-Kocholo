As the face of ANW, this could be really bad for the world of Ninja competition. Thoughts?\n\n****************************************\n\nETA June 26, 2024:\n\nCAMDEN, N.J. – A Florida man was sentenced today to 121 months in prison for receiving child pornography and enticement to travel for illicit sexual conduct, announced U.S. Attorney Philip R. Sellinger.\n\nAndrew Drechsel, 35, of Saint Cloud, Florida, pleaded guilty on June 1, 2023, before Chief U.S. District Judge Renée M. Bumb to an information charging him with one count of receiving child pornography and one count of knowingly persuading, inducing, enticing and coercing a minor to travel interstate to engage in sexual activity for which the defendant can be charged with a crime. Judge Bumb imposed the sentence today in Camden federal court.\n\nAccording to documents filed in this case and statements made in court:\n\nFrom 2014 to Nov. 8, 2019, Drechsel lived in Hamden, Connecticut. His victim lived in New Jersey. On Nov. 8, 2019, law enforcement agents searched one of Drechsel’s phones and found images of child sexual abuse, including images of the victim when the victim was 14 years old. Drechsel admitted that he originally met the victim through his activities in the parkour community as an “American Ninja Warrior.” Drechsel admitted the victim traveled across state lines in July 2015 and he had sexual relations with the victim.\n\nIn addition to the prison term, Judge Bumb sentenced Drechsel to 15 years of supervised release and ordered him to pay $100,000 in restitution to the victim.\n\nwww.inquirer.com/news/american-ninja-warrior-drew-drechsel-sentenced-20240626.html\n\nPost by tyler on\n\nwww.justice.gov/usao-nj/press-release/file/1300981/download\n\nHe was certainly arrested. The document lists stuff to make the argument for probable cause. It sounds like there is a lot more. I always like to say innocent until prove guilty but if even half of what the FBI agent said is true, it's horrific. And there's likely more. The fact they have phone records with pictures and videos seems really incriminating.\n\nPost by sparky930 on\n\nThis is beyond disgusting. Just threw my signed Real Life Ninja shirt away. After reading the case documents, there's no denying he's guilty.\n\nI can't imagine how much ANW producers must be scrambling right now putting together Season 12. I'm sure he was EVERYWHERE and they constantly had cameras on him. I don't know how/if NBC can just pretend he doesn't exist after this came out. I can't even imagine them re-airing USA vs. The World next week with him as the team captain.\n\nPost by tyler on\n\nThis is beyond disgusting. Just threw my signed Real Life Ninja shirt away.

I can't even imagine them re-airing USA vs. The World next week with him as the team captain.\n\nHe's the big name of the show coming off winning the big prize. He likely is featured in so many places. Most of ANW social media posts have prominent posts of Drew as one of their most recent posts. They seriously might even need to redub some runs.\n\nBut the big thing is others should not be erased because of his actions. It would not be fair to others. Like there will likely be some people calling to remove all the episodes that feature Drew from Peacock. Others should not be punished for what Drew did.\n\nPost by PsychoDelusion on\n\nIf it's real then it sucks big time. Drew inspired me so damn much over the years. Pretty convenient that all of this happened after he won the million dollars. Thoughts are with April and the child right now. Drew is the last person I'd expect to do sth like this\n\nPost by Zach Smith on\n\nHe was always a favorite of mine, but something about him just seemed... off, like there was something weird about him and I couldn't quite figure out why. But now I know, we all know.\n\nPost by Ninja Warrior Ryan on\n\nSo did not expect to hear something like this happen, especially coming from a seemingly nice guy like Drew! No possible way he will be invited back to any competition in the world, Sasuke, ANW, or other. He really screwed up if it's true, sadly.\n\nFrom stuff I've heard on how he treats people (for example, production team at ANW) he doesnt seem to be as nice as he portrays on tv.\n\nPost by Ninja Warrior Ryan on\n\nThis is beyond disgusting.
