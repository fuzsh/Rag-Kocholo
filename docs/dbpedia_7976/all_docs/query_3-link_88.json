        "text": "American Ninja Warrior 16 is the sixteenth season of American Ninja Warrior, and the first season after Daniel Gil and Vance Walker's total victories on the previous season.\n\nIt was revealed in the leaked acceptance letter that this season, alongside American Ninja Warrior 15, will be filmed. Details on when this season will air in relation to American Ninja Warrior 15 were a year apart. Casting for this season, unbeknownst to the general public, closed on December 16, 2022.\n\nAs a result of this dually-structured filming, the following changes are happening these two seasons:\n\nThis season is filmed after each part of American Ninja Warrior 15 wraps up. For example, Qualifiers for American Ninja Warrior 15 were filmed, in a few days time, Qualifiers for this season were filmed and so on.\n\nThat means some competitors will be in the Semifinals and/or Las Vegas National Finals solely for one season or the other.\n\nSome competitors may not be available for both seasons, however, so this doesn't mean every competitor competed in American Ninja Warrior 15 will be featured in this season (such as Barclay Stockett, Sandy Zimmerman, Jera Boyd, Isaiah Wakeham, Evan Andrews, Jonathan Bange and Grant McCartney).\n\nHowever, several slots are purposely vacant, and competitors who were not initially called but did well would occupy these slots (such as Taylor Greene and Madelyn Madaras).\n\nThe Mega Wall's prize money was increased to US$20,000 or 2% of the million-dollar prize according to Zuri.\n\nDue to the aforementioned filming, the format is identical with the previous season.\n\nSimilar to previous seasons, most of the episodes are two hours long excluding the following episodes which were one hour long:\n\nThe fourth and fifth episode showcasing the last two qualifiers respectively.\n\nAbbreviations\n\nThe following abbreviations are used to differentiate the episodes in between the qualifiers and semifinals for simplicity sake and to avoid confusion:\n\nQF - Qualifiers\n\nSF - Semifinals\n\nEP - Episode\n\nLos Angeles Qualifiers\n\nQF EP 1 (Qualifiers 1 & 2)\n\nOriginal Airdate: June 3rd, 2024\n\nObstacles\n\nQualifier 1\n\n① Pole Vault\n\n② ^Reel to Reel\n\n③ ^Dangerous Waters\n\n④ ~Duck Duck Goose\n\n⑤ *Jawbreakers\n\n⑥ Warped Wall\n\nConditional\n\nMega Wall (if under 1:20)\n\nQualifier 2\n\n① Pole Vault\n\n② Double Twister\n\n③ ^Dangerous Waters\n\n④ ~Duck Duck Goose\n\n⑤ Ring the Bells\n\n⑥ Warped Wall\n\nConditional\n\nMega Wall (if under 1:20)\n\nThe Runoffs\n\n① Home Run\n\n② Spring Forward\n\n③ Wingnuts\n\n④ Hopscotch\n\n^ - New Obstacle\n\n~ - Fan-created Obstacle (Obstacle Design Challenge Winner)\n\n* - Modified Obstacle (Compared to Previous American Ninja Warrior's Seasons)\n\nResults\n\nTop 13 Men Competitors\n\nPlace Name Profile Result Notes Qualifier 1 1st Jonah Brown Welder Clear (1:15:16) Digest.
