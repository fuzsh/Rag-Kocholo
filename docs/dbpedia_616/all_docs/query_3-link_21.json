        "text": "There were 1.8 million total border crossings to Hungary from Ukraine as of 1 December 2022. There were 32,564 applications for temporary protection and 28,379 positive decisions taken.\n\nUNHCR has been present in Hungary since 1989, working closely with state entities including local and municipal authorities, UN agencies, and national partners. Our UNHCR office in Budapest, Hungary oversees operations in the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia and Hungary.\n\nWorking alongside government counterparts, partners, and national institutions, we work to ensure refugees and asylum-seekers secure essential rights, access to basic services and legal and protection assistance. We also aim for inclusion in national services and to foster community support capacity. Directly and through partners, we provide much-needed assistance to refugees across a range of basic needs and protection sectors, while also working to raise awareness and prevention of statelessness. We are committed to creating public support for asylum-seekers, refugees, and stateless persons."
