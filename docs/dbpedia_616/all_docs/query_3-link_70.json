The idea came about after a visit to Hungary where Ferenc, Peter and Roy were welcomed like family to the small town of Kiskunhalas. Having been invited to take part in a military parade organized by the Hussar Banderium of Kiskunhalas, to proudly represent the United States, Ferenc and Peter dressed as Union Cavalry Officiers and Roy dressed as Sitting Bull.\n\nThe generosity of their gracious hosts in Kiskunhalas and their sincere appreciation for the culture and the hussar traditions in European History prompted them to form the first California Hussar Regiment.\n\nPresident: Frank Bakonyi\n\nwww.californiahussars.com\n\n408-674-3899\n\nEszterlánc Hungarian Folk Ensamble\n\nPerforming Group\n\nHistory: The Eszterlánc Hungarian Folk Ensemble has been celebrating and showcasing Hungarian folk culture in the Bay Area since 1977 through presentations to the Hungarian community and the general public.\n\nThe Ensemble consists of twelve to twenty young adults ranging from age 14 and up. Most are of Hungarian heritage, although membership has never been limited to those with Hungarian backgrounds. The dancers receive their training in the Ensemble as well as from guest teachers and at workshops statewide.\n\nThe community served by Eszterlánc is vast, as appearances include international festivals, social events, patriotic holidays, and ethnic events. The Hungarian community alone, the group's most supportive audience, numbers in the tens of thousands in California. Recently, the group has toured to Los Angeles, Sacramento, and even as far as Vancouver, B.C.\n\nP.O.

Our mailing list includes over 150 members, and our planned weekly activities are generally attended by an average of 10-20 participants. All of our meetings are conducted primarily in English; however, those who wish to improve their language skills also have the opportunity to interact with the many native Hungarian speakers counted among our membership.\n\nModern-day Hungary is a small country, roughly the size of Indiana, and throughout the world there are about ten million Hungarian speakers. Although the number of native Hungarians is relatively small, Hungarian language and culture remains strong, even in Southern California. Our club often plans activities with the small, vibrant and close-knit Hungarian community in Los Angeles that includes many prominent filmmakers, professors, actors, and writers. The greater Hungarian community allows our club to participate in activities outside of UCLAs borders, including film festivals, restaurant outings, and events at other Hungarian cultural centers in the area. However, most of our activities will be conducted at UCLA and include lectures, film watching, poetry recitation, and cooking lessons.\n\nHungarian members: 150 people\n\nPresident: Aliz Raksi\n\nwww.studentgroups.ucla.edu/magyarklub\n\naliz0611@hotmail.com\n\nHungarian Freedom Fighters Federation\n\nPresident: András Rékay\n\nwww.http://sfkornyek.szabadsagharcos.org/\n\nHungarian Heritage Foundation\n\nNon-profit organization\n\nHistory: Hungarian refugees arrived in the SF bay area in great numbers after the Hungarian Revolution and Freedom Fight in 1956, and swelled the number of Hungarians already living here. Soon they began to organize and eventually bought a property to serve as a Hungarian House in San Francisco, in 1969.\n\nAs Hungarian-Americans dispersed around the Bay Area, leaders of the Hungarian House decided in 1991 to sell the Geary Street property, which needed major renovations and a seismic retrofit. With the sale of the property the Magyar Jövo Alap (Hungarian Future Fund) committee was formed from Hungarian House leaders and representatives of several other Hungarian organizations, to promote Hungarian cultural activities until a new center could be established. Over the years other Bay Area Hungarian groups* joined or worked with the Jövo Alap to keep our heritage alive for us and our children. The Jövo Alap has now inspired the creation of the Hungarian Heritage Foundation of the San Francisco Bay Area.\n\nA non-profit organization was established and formally registered in California, in March 2009.\n\nPO Box 5383, Redwood City, CA 94063-0383\n\nPresident: Victoria K.

The houses were built during the 1936 San Diego Exposition for the different ethnic groups to show their traditions, customs, and history. The project was so successful that the City of San Diego decided to donate them permanently to the ethnic groups in order to keep them open for the public. There was a temporary interruption during WWII, when the Naval Hospital used the buildings, but after the war, the City returned them to the different nationalities. House of Hungary became an official member of the HPR in 1948. Our cottage is open to the public every Sunday afternoon, with a hostess offering homemade pastries, coffee and other refreshments to the visitors. Our language school is conducted by professional Hungarian-born teachers and is open to all interested individuals. At the beginning we shared one cottage with the Czechoslovakian\n\ns, but we had always hoped to have our own. In 1980 the Building Fund Committee was established at Gabor Tatrais suggestion. It took 15 years of hard work and dedication - in large part successful food fairs and Gabor Tatrais idea of the annual Gala Balls - until we were able to save enough money to start building our own cottage. In 1989 the Building Committee was established. Although the House of Hungary was built from the donations of our members and the savings through many years, it is the property of the City of San Diego, and as a non-profit organization we are under the direction and by-laws of the City and the HPR. Our house, like the other cottages, delegates two representatives to the HPR parliamentary meetings held once a month. We elect every November our President and the Board of Directors, all members over the age of 18 have the privilege to vote.

Today the United Magyar House is hosting our National Holydays. The United Magyar House's major agenda is to promote and cherish the Hungarian culture, language and tradition, further to unite the Hungarians living in Los Angeles.\n\nFinally the president and the directors of board are pronouncing their great gratitude to the founders of the United Magyar House as well as the Hungarians living in Los Angeles, being involved in caring and supporting the organization and continuing the tradition. 1975 West Washington Blvd.\n\nPresident: Miklós Pereházy\n\nwww.unitedmagyarhouse.org/home.html\n\nperehazy.miklos@gmail.com\n\n323-734-1453\n\nHungarian Community Club of Wallingford\n\nThe Hungarian Community Hall, home of the Hungarian Community Club of Wallingford, opened its door in 1918, and it was to become an important center for the Magyar population of Central Connecticut for decades, subsequently.\n\nThe Hall had been built by first generation Hungarians; many hard working people- men and women- had contributed their hard earned money towards the funds needed for the completion of the House.\n\nBy 1941, the mortgage was fully paid up, and the Hungarian House of Wallingford has been debt-free ever since. The entrance of the Hall was reconstructed and a new stage was added in 1950. Activities were numerous and well-attended success of the Wallingford facility reached its zenith in the late 50s and early sixties; there were occasions when the House could not accommodate all of the prospective attendees, so, at times, a number of them had to be turned away at the door.\n\nAttendance at functions at the Community Hall started to decline in the 1970s A number of factors, including Hungarians moving away from the vicinity of the Hall, significantly\n\nchanging demographics and a noticeable ebbing of interest had contributed to the this process. Consideration of sale of the building first surfaced in the late 70s; however, a sudden resurgence of interest and enthusiasm saved the Club from going under, at that time..\n\nUnfortunately, years of frequently treacherous struggle for survival, with unmistakable signs of disillusionment followed. It had become increasingly and painfully evident that only a handful of members were willing to participate in the work needed for the preparation of the Clubs functions and for the upkeep of the House. These few people (and they were always the same ones) were becoming tired, bitter and resentful and had shown signs of being drained, physically and emotionally, alike. Meetings of the Executive Board and Membership had regularly centered on the prospects of sale of the House. In November of 2006, the apparently inevitable decision was made to sell the building.\n\nPresident: Ákos Horváh\n\nwww.hccwallingford.org/\n\n203-284-9899\n\nHungarian Cultural Society of Connecticut\n\nThe Hungarian Cultural Society of Connecticut (HCSC) was established in 1988 as the successor of the original Hungarian Reading Circle of Wallingford, CT. HCSCs mission at the beginning was essentially local and focused on providing first and second generation Hungarian Americans monthly opportunities to experience their rich ancestral heritage, through music, literature, drama and poetry. In the 90s, however, as evidence of their more comfortable economic status, HCSC members expressed an interest to support selected Hungarian cultural and educational institutions servicing some of the 2 million strong ethnic Hungarian minority populations established for centuries in the Transylvania region of Rumania and Trans-Carpathian Ukraine. Fall annual gala dinners organized by HCSC are this organizations sole fundraising vehicles. Below are two particular examples of programs sponsored by HCSC.\n\nwww.hcsc.us\n\ninfo@hcsc.us\n\nP.O.

Today the Clubs main objective is to promote Hungarian culture and traditions, to bring the Hungarian-American community together, organizing regular events, involving all generations. Our annual scholarships are awarded to assist young Hungarian-Americans who are actively involved in the community.\n\nP.O.

AHF was founded in 1906 and incorporated in 1907 in Cleveland, Ohio as a non-profit association of Hungarian Fraternal societies, institutions and churches to \"defend the interest of Americans of Hungarian origin in the United States.\" Over the past 100 years, AHF's mission has broadened to include support of people of Hungarian descent on both sides of the Atlantic and in the successor states of the Carpathian Basin.

The question of the charter had been discussed three times formerly, on December 19, 1906, on January 10, 1907, and on January 11, 1907. The debate revealed why the bill proposed by South Bend Congressman Abraham Lincoln Brick had such a stormy life. The convention of the Hungarian Reformed Federation of America is not the only place where bills are sent from one committee to the other, because the same thing happened to the bill concerning the charter in the House of Representatives. Originally it was proposed to the committee managing the affairs of the District of Columbia who passed it on to the Committee on the Judiciary. James R. Mann, a representative from Chicago taking part in the charter debate, gave them a piece of his mind; it seems that if a bill is not favorably accepted by the committee it was handed in to, it simply passed\n\nit on to another one where it will be treated on more friendly terms. However, Brick refuted this statement saying that there were other reasons for passing the bill to another committee. In any case, when it was presented to the meeting on February 4, the number of the bill was H.R.24046. The debate can be read in the appropriate volume of the Congressional Record\n\n2001 Massachusetts Ave, NW Washington, D.C.\n\nPresident: Leslie L.

Florida was started in November of 2000. By the end of 2001 the club had 58 members. The membership today is close to 250 people. The organization is governed by a board of directors that is nominated and elected by the membership at the beginning of each calendar year. The board consists of a president, vice-president, secretary, treasurer, and directors.\n\nIn order to keep the expenses to a minimum the club doesnt have a permanent club building. Board and committee meetings are held at members homes or at other public places. Club events are held at private or public facilities like country clubs, restaurants, banquet facilities, or public parks in the Naples/Bonita/Estero area. Locations are based on value, availability, and quality.\n\nMany of the clubs events (i.e. dinner/dances, picnics) are social in nature. The club had entertainers from Hungary perform at several of these events. There are also events that are in support of cultural and/or historic awareness. An example of one such project was the implementation, fund-raising and dedication of a statue commemorating the 50th anniversary of the 1956 Hungarian Revolution. The statue is located on the grounds of the Collier County Government Building in Naples, FL. They have also sponsored fundraisers for projects such as building a central water supply for the village of Kero in Transylvania.\n\n6590 Huntington Lakes Cir #104, Naples, Fl 34119\n\nPresident: Frankl Dobos\n\nwww.hacswfl.com\n\ninfo@hacswfl.com\n\n239-597-2345\n\nHungarian Christian Society\n\nNon-profit social organization\n\n165 N Jackson Rd, Venice, FL 34292\n\n941-483-4830\n\nHungarian Kossuth Hall\n\nNon-profit organization\n\n2230 NW 14th St, Miami, FL 33125\n\nHungarian members: 50 people President: Erzsébet Kiss\n\nwww.www.hungarianchurchofmiami.comxa.com\n\nmia.egyhaz@mindspring.com\n\n305-638-1631\n\nÁrdádhon Hungarian Settlement Cultural Association\n\nIn 1976, the Bicentennial of the United States triggered a cultural awareness throughout the country, including Louisiana. In an attempt to preserve and promote the Hungarian culture of the Albany, Louisiana area, some of the local Magyar descendants established the Arpadhon Hungarian Settlement Cultural Association (AHSCA). The (AHSCA) is based in a rural ethnic community known as Hungarian Settlement. It is located in eastern Livingston Parish, Louisiana due south of a small town called Albany. This ethnic enclave, once known as Árpádhon, contains many of the descendants of the early Magyar settlers who immigrated there near the turn of the twentieth century. At the present time, residents are striving to preserve at least some of the Hungarian culture of their ancestors, though much has changed over the past hundred years since the origin of this unique community. After more than thirty years, this organization is still an integral and vibrant part of this rural community. The AHSCA sponsors\n\nyearly events that include the Hungarian Harvest Dance, which takes place on the first Saturday of every October. Hungarian Heritage Day, an event that usually takes place in May or June, provides the community with yet another opportunity to promote the rich history and culture of the area by honoring the Hungarian descendants who are seventy-five years of age and older.\n\nThe Arpadhon Hungarian Settlement Cultural Association is located in the former Erdey-Kiss Amvets Building less than one-quarter mile south of Albany, Louisiana\n\n29025 Louisiana 43 Albany, LA 70711\n\nHungarian members: 80 people\n\nPresident: Wayne Kerko\n\nwww.magyars.org\n\nHungarian Settlement Historical Society, Hungarian Museum\n\n29025 Louisiana 43 Albany, LA 70711\n\nPresident: Alex Kropog\n\nwww.hungarianmuseum.com\n\nakropog@att.net\n\n225-294-5732\n\nHungarians of Louisiana\n\nCultural and educational organization\n\nA non-profit tax exempt cultural and educational organization founded November 21, 2000 in New Orleans.

It meets quarterly at various venues.\n\nHungarla has sponsored the installation of a bronze plaque on Lafayette Square in New Orleans to commemorate the 150th anniversary of the visit of Lajos (Louis) Kossuth to New Orleans between March 25 and April 1, 1852. Kossuth addressed 8000 citizens on Lafayette Square in front of the City Hall now called Gallier Hall. Lafayette Square is a monument square with statues of Henry Clay, Benjamin Franklin and John McDonough. There are multiple commemorative bronze plaques on the square.

The Ensemble actively exists since 1998, and has over the years evolved into one of Americas leading ethnic dance ensembles.\n\nThroughout the years, the Ensemble has performed in locations as prestigious as The State Theater of New Brunswick and Manhattans Town Hall. The members seek and accept performance opportunities at various events, such as Hungarian and international folk festivals, ethnic dance events, school events and more.\n\nThe choreographies on stage are usually presented with live music played by Életfa, the best known Hungarian folk music band in U.S. Életfa treats its audiences to a high-energy, entertaining tour of Hungarys folk music, song and dance culture. The groups members specialize in and present the authentic, archaic folklore from the villages of present-day-Hungary, Transylvania, Slovakia and beyond, delivered in a style suitable for Western audiences.\n\n197 Somerset St. New Brunswick, NJ 08901\n\nwww.csurdongolo.blogspot.com/\n\ncsurfolk@gmail.com\n\n732-930-1038\n\nHungarian Alumni Association\n\nSocial education organization\n\nP.O.

It was officially abolished in Hungary in 1948. In 1989 it was again legalized. Our organization started operating in the displaced persons camps in Germany and Austria in 1948 as the Paul Teleki Scout Association. In 1948, we renamed ourselves as the Hungarian Scout Association. In 1989, we returned the Association's original seal to Hungary and gave it to the new Hungarian Scouts Association.\n\nIn the early fifties, the DPs (Displaced Persons, refugees from the Second World War and the new Communist regimes in Eastern Europe) started immigrating to various overseas countries. Our first overseas troop was founded in 1950 in Rio de Janeiro. Our 2 troops in Caracas, Venezuela are still active. After Brazil and Venezuela, troops were founded in the USA, Canada, Australia, and other countries. The organization grew from about 1000 members in the early 50's to over 6000 members in the late seventies. Today, we are 4500 strong and have 70 troops on our rolls. Typically, we have a Boy Scout and Girl Guide troop in most cities that have substantial Hungarian populations.

Magyar Church opened its first Hungarian School in 1914. The Daughters of Divine Charity came from Hungary to the United States in October 1913. In January 1914 the sisters were already invited to St. Stephens to teach religion and Hungarian language to the children of the parish.\n\nFrom 1933 Hungarian classes were held regularly again. Hungarian nuns  Daughters of Divine Charity  taught every Saturday from 9-3. After World War II it became a bilingual Catechism School. It ceased to exist at the end of the 1940's.\n\nIn 1953, when many new Hungarian refugees arrived from Europe the Saturday Hungarian School was started again at St. Stephens under the leadership of the Hungarian Scout movement. Most of the teachers were scout leaders.\n\nIn 1958, Fr. János Gáspár opened the doors of the St. Stephen Hungarian Weekend School, which was sponsored by the Hungarian Holy Name Society.\n\nIn 1965, under Fr. Dr. Antal Dunay a significant and unique change took place. As a result of the untiring organizational work of Dr. András Pusztai the first Daily Hungarian School in the United States was established at St. Stephens in Passaic.\n\nIn 1976, St. Stephens Parish and the Reformed Church joined forces and founded the Hungarian School of the Two Sister Churches. It operated at the Calvin Hall until the end of 1983 and then moved to the classrooms of St. Stephens School. As St. Stephen R.C. Magyar Church has become the only supporter of the school, it was renamed ST.

HHRF is the only professional organization in the West devoted to the rights of these communities.\n\nSince the 1989 downfall of communism, HHRF has mobilized Western support for the positive initiatives and aspirations of Hungarian minority communities to rebuild civil society, to promote economic self-reliance, and to restore in the contemporary context their centuries-old traditions of educational and cultural excellence.\n\nRelying on well-developed sources in the region, the award-winning Foundation serves as a clearinghouse of information for Western governments, human rights organizations, the media and the general public. A private, independent and not-for-profit 501(c)(3) corporation, HHRF operates from its New York headquarters and maintains offices in Budapest and Kolozsvár (Cluj), Romania, in addition to representatives around the world.\n\nHungarian minorities still face an uphill struggle to regain linguistic, cultural and educational rights so long denied them. The legacies of intolerance against national minorities remain, and governments have colluded with ultra-nationalistic and neo-fascist organizations which openly incite majority populations against minorities.\n\nP.O.

Vardy, and Peter Sugar. They charged their new organization with the following mission:\n\nTo act as a forum for historians interested in Hungarian history, and to establish contacts and cooperate with the colleagues in Hungary.\n\nBy 1973 it had 74 members and was successful in organizing and sponsoring panels at the annual national conventions of the American Historical Association and the American Association for the Advancement of Slavic Studies. This organization was never an exclusionary one, but was open to cooperation with scholar in other fields.

Its constitution and By-Laws were chartered in the County of Monroe, State of New York. The Clubs general purpose is to preserve our cultural heritage in nonpartisan and nonsectarian manner; i.e.\n\n1.) To promote cultural and social exchange\n\n2.) Represent our Hungarian-American community within the society-at-large\n\n3.) Encourage initiatives, projects, youth organizations whose aims overlap that of the Club\n\n4.) To lend guidance to newcomers\n\nDuring the ensuing decades, the Club1s basic purpose remained constant, even though our makeup has changed in many ways. Today, most of us are either American born or have lived here for over a generation and our overall assimilation into the host society has been a model success story.

By the Fall of that year there are two boys' troops, one on the east side of the city in the Buckeye Road neighborhood and one on the west side in the Ohio City area. They also are registered troops with the Boy Scouts of America. Girls' troop forms in 1952 and splits into two troops in 1957 in the same neighborhoods. The Hungarian scouts learn all the traditional skills of scouting but also are familiarized with the history, customs and traditions of Hungary. It is a prerequisite for all members to speak Hungarian. Most also read and write in Hungarian. All meetings (on Friday nights), outings and camps are held with only the Hungarian language being spoken. Scouts 14 years old and older can join the Hungarian Scout Folk Ensemble. These scouts meet every Tuesday night and specialize in learning the dances and songs of Hungary among other crafts and skills. To help with language skills, and to learn\n\nthe geography, ethnography and history of Hungary, the Hungarian School has classes on Monday nights. Most scouts attend classes for up to 10 to 12 years.\n\nThe Cleveland troops are supported by the American Hungarian Friends of Scouting. They hold three large fundraising events a year: an awards banquet in February, a debutante benefit ball in May and a Hungarian Scout Festival on Sunday of Labor Day weekend. They also own the 130 acre Teleki Scout Park named after Pál Teleki, Prime Minister of Hungary 1920-21 and 1939-41 and the first Chief Scout of Hungary.

The REVIEW is subtitled \"The Second One Hundred Years\" in recognition of the fact that significant waves of Hungarian immigration to the US took place more than 100 years ago in the 1880s. Now Hungarian-Americans are entering into a second one hundred years of settlement in the United States. In its first two years, the REVIEW was funded by Grants from the Ohio Arts Council and came out quarterly.\n\nThe CHHS opened the Hungarian Heritage Museum in the Richmond Mall on September 7, 1996.\n\nThe CHHS opened the Hungarian Heritage Museum in its new location at the Euclid Square Mall in May, 1999.\n\nIn addition to its Museum collection, the CHHS has been working to organize its significant archival and library collections.\n\nP.O.

Stephen Szilagyi was visiting in Hungary and saw a small child who needed surgery to correct scoliosis, curvature of the spine. The procedure was not available in Hungary but was done regularly in the U.S.\n\nRev. Szilagyi collected enough money to bring this young boy to the United States to receive the surgery he needed to straighten his back. But other children needed this operation, too.\n\nRev. Szilagyi realized that what were really needed were doctors trained in the U.S. to go back to Hungary to perform many operations. So he arranged for one physician to come the U.S. to be trained and for the equipment the surgeon would need to be sent to his hospital in Hungary. This was the way SARA began.\n\nToday, the procedure to correct scoliosis is being done regularly in Hungary, and hundreds of children stand straight and tall because of it.\n\n141 Cummims Ave, Conneaut, Ohio 44030\n\nPresident: Dr. Fleming Fallon, Jr.\n\nwww.saragroup.org\n\nmailto:szilsara@suite224.net\n\n440-593-2021\n\nSociety and Order of St. László\n\nSzent László Társaság és Rend\n\n1640 Columbia Rd.

At that time, the orphanage moved to downtown Ligonier, while the elderly remained in the original Home.\n\n1951, 1962, 1975\n\nSpace in the original Home became limited. Thus, in 1951, the first wing of the historic Bethlen Home for the Aged was built. Newer sections were dedicated in 1962 and 1975.\n\n1979\n\nThe orphanage closed its doors. Over the span of nearly six decades, the orphanage provided a home for more than 3,000 children.\n\n1980s - Present\n\nBuilt 20 cottages in the Bethlen Retirement Village\n\nRemarketed the old orphanage as the Bethlen Apartments\n\nAcquired Ligonier Gardens Personal Care Home\n\nConstructed a new Bethlen Nursing Home to replace the historic facility\n\nWrapped its multiple services and lifestyles under the name Bethlen Communities\n\nOpened Home Health and Hospice Services\n\n135 Kalassay Drive, Ligonier PA 15658\n\nPresident: Rev.

The group grew swiftly, and was soon able to purchase a site at Eight & Columbia. This remained their home until 1923, when a property at 2007-12 North Second Street was acquired. As members of the United Worker's singing Societies of the North Eastern States, various singing groups were successful until the late 1940's.\n\nIn 1922, the Banater Athletic Club organized. Even in the early years, soccer teams made great strides. Soccer remains our major sport. Over the years, senior and youth teams won many championships at local, state regional and national competitions. Club members have been active at all levels, and the Club has played host to numerous regional and national championship finals. In 1965, the Club won the United States Amateur Soccer Association Open Club in a thrilling game held at the Club. They repeated this feat again in 1999, becoming the last open cup champions of the 20th century!\n\nOn February 4, 1973, a destructive fire ravished the clubhouse. Thanks to enthusiastic leadership from the Club's President and Board, and the dedication and long hours from a large group of members, a new clubhouse opened almost three months to the day from the disastrous fire.\n\nAlong with Soccer, dance has always been an important part of the Club's social life. Throughout the years those in charge have brought not only cultural and ethnic music and performers, but also popular entertainment to the Club.\n\nThe club is particularly proud of the accomplishments of the last 40 years.\n\n466 E.

It was chartered by the State of Pennsylvania in December of that same year under the name Verhovay Aid Association. The goal of the founders was to extend a helping hand to each other and to the many Hungarian immigrants who worked and suffered in the mines and industrial centers of America at a period in its history when insurance of any sort was still in the far away future. With no sick benefits, no unemployment compensation, and no death benefits for their families, and with the immigrants being maimed and killed by the thousands in the ever-recurring industrial accidents, they had no other recourse but to turn to each other for help. This is how fraternalism was born in America, and these are the same conditions that prompted the thirteen founders to establish the Verhovay Aid Association.\n\n709 Brighton Rd.
