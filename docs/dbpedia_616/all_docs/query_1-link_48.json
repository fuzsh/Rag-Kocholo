        "meta_description": "•\tThe Hungarian government introduced significant changes to its immigration system, with key changes implemented on March 1, 2024, including:\no\tThe end of the ‘single permit’ and the introduction of multiple new permit types, including a new ‘guest worker’ permit which is more restricted in its scope and rights;\no\tThe introduction of the ‘Hungarian Card’ – a domestic ‘highly-skilled worker’ immigration pathway; and\no\tStricter notification rules for employers. \n•\tWhile the law was being implemented, residence and settlement permits expiring during the temporary suspension of application processing were automatically extended until April 30, 2024. Processing has since resumed as of March 1, 2024.\n•\tThese reforms are likely to make it harder for employers to source and retain low-skilled workers (which is part of a broader government strategy of protecting local workers); while, conversely, providing relaxed or new pathways for sourcing highly-skilled talent, especially in the engineering or information and technology sectors.",

        "text": "End of the ‘Single Permit’; multiple new permits. The previous Work & Residence Permit – often called the ‘Single Permit’ – has been replaced by a wide range of permits, many of which are new, including:\n\nGuest Worker permits. For a wide range of temporary work roles (discussed further below).\n\nThe Hungarian Card. A type of ‘highly skilled talent’ work permit (discussed further below).\n\nThe Residence Permit for the purpose of Posting. A type of posted worker work permit where the posting company must be within the European Union.\n\nThe National Card. Specific to Serbian and Ukrainian nationals, with eligible applicants being work permit exempt and able to access non-labor shortage roles. Despite the ‘National Card’ being new per se, a similar regime existed previously for Serbian and Ukrainian nationals. Update - July 10, 2024: Effective July 10, 2024, eligibility for the National Card has expanded to include not only nationals of Serbia and Ukraine but also of Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Moldova, Montenegro, North Macedonia, and Russia.\n\nThere are also some permits that are remaining under the new system, including:\n\nEU Blue Card. This permit existed previously but now allows for foreign nationals in certain information technology roles to be eligible if they have adequate professional experience (regardless of educational qualifications).\n\nIntra-Corporate Transfer Residence Permit. This permit type has not undergone any changes.\n\nGiven the new diversity of permit types, employers may need to consider their future human resources strategy with fresh eyes. A 'one-size-fits-all’ approach is unlikely to suffice anymore.\n\nGuest Worker permits. The new ‘Guest Worker’ category includes four new types of residence permit:\n\nA seasonal employment permit for seasonal roles in areas like agriculture, fishing, plant production, and forestry.\n\nAn ‘employment for investment purposes’ permit which provides a right of employment for the purpose of carrying out an investment.\n\nResidence permit for purposes of employment. This captures employees on a Hungarian payroll with positions where the employee’s Hungarian Standard Classification of Occupation, which often captures lower-skilled roles and roles not requiring any educational qualifications, but can also encompass highly-skilled roles that overlap with the Hungarian Card and the EU Blue Card.\n\nGuest worker residence permit. This permit is linked to employers engaged in projects of strategic significance for the Hungarian economy. Update - July 10, 2024: Effective July 10, 2024 and following their addition to eligibility for the National Card, nationals of Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, North Macedonia, and Russia are no longer eligible for the residence permit for guest workers.\n\nValidity period. Guest Worker permits are valid for two years and can be extended a further one year.\n\nLimitations. Guest Worker permits have the following notable limitations:\n\nBan on certain roles for non-EU foreign nationals. There are approximately 300 roles which non-EU foreign nationals will not be eligible for under the Guest Worker permit category, including roles in the armed forces and the police services, government and politics, health, education and elderly care, engineering and science, law and accounting, medicine, news, culture and the arts, as well as driver, mechanic and company director and chief executive roles.\n\nGuest Worker permits cannot be renewed. Affected individuals must instead apply for a new permit each time. In the interim period they will not be allowed to work. Previously, ‘single permit’ holders could renew their permits prior to expiry.\n\nStatus change. Guest Worker permit holders cannot switch to another type of permit, including permanent residence. Previously, ‘single permit’ holders could change their permit status, including arranging permanent residence.\n\nFamily reunification. The dependent family members of guest worker permit-holders are not eligible for family reunification permits. Previously, the family members of ‘single permit’ holders were eligible for family reunification permits.\n\nGuest worker specific limitations. The other permit types are not subject to these above limitations.\n\nThe new ‘Guest Worker’ category provides a more restrictive immigration pathway than the previous ‘Single Permit’ option. In short, it is less attractive for foreign workers and their employers.\n\nEmployers will face increased challenges sourcing and retaining relevant foreign talent. The range of eligible roles has decreased (including due to the list of around 300 banned roles for non-EU foreign workers), and employers will face periodic ‘work pauses’ where existing employees are unable to work until they obtain a new work permit.\n\nEmployees may be deterred from working in Hungary given barriers to ever accessing permanent residence (or alternate immigration statues), and challenges in bringing over their family.\n\nThe Hungarian Card.\n\nThis new permit is a domestic equivalent of the EU Blue Card, catering to highly-skilled talent who either have adequate higher education qualifications (which directly relates to the role in question) or are engaged in sport or the performing arts.\n\nTalent shortage roles. It is largely limited to roles that are facing talent shortages, including in the engineering or information technology space.\n\nMinimum salary level. The minimum salary of the role must at least be 80 percent of the average salary received by a Hungarian national in the same role.\n\nRenewal, family reunification and change of status. Unlike the guest worker category, this permit allows for permit renewal, family reunification, and change of immigration status (including accessing permanent residence).\n\nAlongside the more relaxed EU Blue Card pathway, this new status may assist employers seeking talent in, among other areas, the engineering and information technology sector.\n\nGiven this card is not affected by the same limitations imposed on the Guest Worker permit (that is, renewal, reunification and status change limitations), eligible foreign workers are likely to be attracted to this option."
