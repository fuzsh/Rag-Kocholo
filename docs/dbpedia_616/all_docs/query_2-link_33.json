        "text": "Dirt as a socialist remnant\n\nRomanticized sensations of homelands are typical tropes in nationalist imaginaries. Indeed, many first generation returnees speak of their expectations in terms of re-experiencing pleasant sights, sounds and smells, sensations that have and can only exist in the homeland. However, they rather find themselves in that impossible in-between position where desired memories are no longer retrievable, but disdained ones still linger. Neglect, dirt and decay are symptomatic examples of the latter.\n\nWhat is interesting for us is that dirt and decay are not simply defined relatively but are abstracted to national and political discourses as their meaning is located in specific historical contexts. The returnee rhetoric of filth gains its power from various powerful discourses. The first is the established historical narrative on the nexus between civilization and cleanliness. Since the eighteenth century, cleanliness, more than most other traits and practices, has played a central role in the capacity of hygiene to be a signifier of civilization (Hirsch, 2015, p. 304; Schülting, 2016; Walther, 2017). While hygiene was associated with civilization and the West, the East at hand was depicted as unhygienic and uncivilized. For example, in her research on Albanians and Bulgarians working in Greece, Hantzaroula (2016) finds that narratives of Europeanization mobilized around dirt and cleanliness. Kristeva, (Bjelić, 2008) in the name of French cleanliness, French “taste” and French “cosmopolitanism” denigrates the Balkans as the filth of Europe. She divides European nations into those like France, which have an aesthetic of the public sphere, and those, such as Bulgaria, which do not. Such orientalist connotations were strengthened and multiplied after the fall of the Berlin Wall (Zarycki, 2014; Ivasiuc, 2017; Buchowski, 2006) further dramatizing conflicting “moral geographies” of post-socialist nations. This othering is performed by means of reductive categorization and entails a need to push these countries upwards on the civilizational slope (Melegh, 2006).\n\nThe returnee dynamic is no less orientalizing in its essence. It is, however, more complex than the usual “Europeanization” canons, which could be evoked by any tourist passing by in Hungary, as it is connected to other national and diasporic narratives. The importance of dirt and decay for the first generation returnees is also rooted in the powerful narrative of an unfinished Hungarian transformation. The Hungarian transition of the 1989-1990s proceeded smoothly, without political annihilation or chaos. Economist Éva Voszka (1993) called it “the unbearable lightness of non-cathartic transition.” The state party peacefully handed over power after negotiating and accepting a compromise solution. However, pre-transition pacts and understandings between the outgoing and the incoming political elites yielded ambiguous political and socio-economic outcomes. While these initial agreements made well-crafted provisions for Hungary’s institutional transition from a one-party communist system to parliamentary democracy, priorities around such volatile matters as political justice and societal consensus on post-communist policy, especially resource allocation, were left in abeyance (Tőkés and Rudolf, 1996). Hungary’s post-communist institutions were built on unexamined foundations whereby new and revamped political institutions could be created with the stroke of a pen. What my interlocutors would call an “unfinished transformation” is a particularly neuralgic point for the diaspora. Dirt on the streets, decay and pollution in Hungary are all seen by first generation returnees as symbols of the trauma of this partial transformation. During their visits, a great majority of older returnees complained about the irreversibility of the haunting “communist legacy” in Hungary. They concluded that Hungary and Hungarians could still not overcome the Communist tradition of improper language, littering and negligence. This inability to reject mental habits acquired under the Soviet system informs the complex of individual and societal behaviors encapsulated by the notion of the legendary homo sovieticus (Sztompka, 2000, 2004; Buchowski, 2006, p. 469) as my informant Endre explained:\n\nThe garbage bins are full, people spit on the streets, dogs shit everywhere […] it is still the old soviet primitive mentality.\n\nFor these returnees, dirt was not just seen as a sign of the incapacity of individuals to leave behind ingrained habits. Rather, it was interpreted as a sign of corruption and misuse of power above and a widespread disregard of laws and administrative rules below, creating a symbiotic whole of moral decay and diminished civic competence.\n\nAlso, radically different from the common Orientalist narratives here is the idea that dirt is an alien entity, forced on Hungary by Soviet colonization, which needs to be cleansed from the cultural body of the country (from streets, maps and language) and from social body. Elvira explains:\n\nThis beautiful country is a tragic country. It is always under foreign occupation and cannot flourish, cannot resurrect. Look at that packed garbage bin over there. It is the Soviet legacy. Hungarians are not Balkan people, but it is very difficult to purge the country of this Soviet filth.\n\nImportantly, in the quote above, although usually referring to different phenomena, Soviet and Balkan are used interchangeably indicating the alien, the foreign and the destructive in Hungary’s “tragic” history.\n\nDirt as Eastern European authenticity\n\nEvidence collected demonstrates that the younger generation diaspora-backpackers have a radically different view of dirt in Hungary than their parents and grandparents. First, these youngsters’ relationship with Hungary differs greatly from that of their parents’. While the first generation has a tangible, both joyful and often traumatic experience of Hungary, from which nostalgic memories have emerged and flourished during the long years of exile, later generations spent their entire life in Australia. Although youngsters might also be emotionally connected to the country and anticipate its positive future, their emotional investment is considerably lower in the fate of Hungary. Further, while the first generation refers to the journey to Hungary as “going home,” for the later-generations the trip is to their country of ethnic origin. Even though their perception is different from that of their elders, they draw on the same or similar global and diasporic discourses when interpreting filth in Hungary.\n\nAlthough it was obvious from my interviews and fieldwork that beyond a certain point and after a certain period of time, the encounter with dirt is burdensome and unpleasant for the youngsters, on superficial level dirt was nonetheless viewed in a positive fashion.\n\nExperiencing decay and dirt, in the youngsters’ narratives, was connected to several classic backpacker tropes. One of them was the importance of immersion in the mundane reality of everyday life in Hungary (Pearce and Zare, 2019; Cao, 2013; Conran, 2006; O’Regan, 2018; Maoz, 2006; Muzaini, 2006; Noy and Cohen, 2012). It seemed that abandonment and shabbiness were not only tolerated but also actively pursued. Walking on the “dirty streets,” traveling on old and used buses and shopping at downtrodden markets were some of the ways in which diaspora youngsters tried selectively to achieve an authentic integration and at the same time disassociate themselves from those older returnees who are desperately searching for the past and not willing to keep up with the present. For instance Zsuzsi, like several others to whom I spoke, believed that such actions would bring her closer to everyday reality and provide her with the greatest sense of adventure:\n\nI do not mind that it is shabby and dirty. This is how people live here and therefore, this is what I also want to experience.\n\nThe intimacy young people seek in this way is also essential to defining themselves as real travelers. Lozanski (2013 2010, p. 758) writes that Western travelers mark the difference between themselves and the “tourist other” through physical geographies, the chaos of cities or backwardness of rural villages being exemplars (Korpela, 2017). However, from Misi’s words below, it becomes clear that these youngsters’ positive claims about dirt not only mimic the simple backpacker-tourist hierarchical slope but also deeply rooted in their diasporic lives:\n\nI travel on second class shitty trains on purpose. How else would I discover how real people live? Older returnees are blinded by their nostalgic lies, I think. They are incapable of accepting that Hungary is how it is now. The country doesn’t live in the past. They do! Therefore, it is impossible for them to forge meaningful connections with the locals.\n\nMisi and others were quick to explain that, unlike older diaspora members, they looked at dirt and underdevelopment with non-judgmental eyes, as these phenomena are indeed essential parts of contemporary reality. Here it becomes obvious that while the first generation perceives dirt and filth as a haunting remnant of the past, youngsters see it as a vital part of the present.\n\nAnother paramount difference that is obvious in the two generations’ perception is that older returnees perceive dirt as an alien parasite entity on the national body of the country, brought about by a foreign colonizing power. Here, symbolically, “dirt” also stands for unethical and not true. Douglas (1966) defines it as “matter out of place,” meaning that dirt, by appearing in the wrong place disrupts a sense of order in the world. Youngsters saw dirt in a radically opposite way. For them, dirt and decay, as “routine aspects of mundane quotidian existence” (Huxley, 2004, p. 43), were perceived as a quintessentially authentic feature of Eastern Europe. Recent scholarship claims that although many independent travelers considered themselves to be more culturally responsible and sensitive than other tourists, Orientalist fantasies and tropes are deeply ingrained in the travel imagination even of backpackers (Sun and Xie, 2019; O’Reilly, 2006, p. 1004; Lozanski, 2010, p. 746; Sobocinska, 2014; Korpela, 2017). Kinga and Vera, two friends with whom I spent some time in Hungary, told me:\n\nKinga: You know when I arrived, I have to admit, that the full garbage bins and the dirty streets disturbed me. I was so used to that narrow, and kind of square Australian order and cleanliness. But very soon I discovered the wildness of it, I felt this place is so much more alive.\n\nVera: Yes, I feel the same. I feel I came to understand this place exactly because I am open-minded and did not close myself in front of unpleasant sight and sensations […] like those Kinga mentioned Kinga: Exactly! You cant understand the place by just looking at the beauty of it. You have to go deeper.\n\nLike backpackers in general, Kinga and Vera, along with other young diaspora members, aestheticize and exoticize filth and associate it with authenticity. Dirt and decay become images that are positioned as more truthful and realistic than the artifice of tourist sites. There is a second possible meaning, namely, the notion that poverty and hardship are more “real” and “true” than contemporary urban middle-class culture. These young diaspora backpackers pride themselves on their sensitivity to details and claim to be penetrating genuine Hungary, while others only glimpse the superficial. Thus, although, most first generation returnees would see dirt and decay as in their faces, that same dirt and decay symbolize for their grandchildren the “unknown” side of the place, “not something people would usually seek to embrace”.\n\nWe have seen so far how dirt is connected both to mundane everyday reality in Hungary and at the same time to orientalist ideas of backwardness and Easternness. Diaspora-backpackers feel secure about their views and their contrasting attitude toward dirt becomes a locus for the expression of their belief in the superiority of their perception vis-à-vis the older generation. Interestingly, we face a situation in which, as Douglas (1966, p. 4) asserts, “pollution beliefs can be used in a dialogue of claims and counter-claims to status” becomes contrary to the original meaning. Nonetheless, when the dirt is being linked to the past socialist regime of the country, this emblematic issue seems to trigger confusion and unease in several youngsters. Most young informants respect the Australian-Hungarian narrative about the horrors of the dictatorship and even those who challenge its totality accept its basic premise. In our conversations, they all assured me that they are aware of the brutality of the dictatorship and the scars it left on the country. Still, the visual heritage of socialism, which they associated with dirty and rundown industrial cities and districts, served for many as geographic sites of authentic Hungarianness. Some of these excerpts from interviews with Adri and Thomas echo the complicated moral baggage youngsters felt when associating dirt with the past:\n\nI know what has happened there, but I wanted to embrace the whole picture. And yes, those ugly socialists buildings are part of it. (Adri) It was crazy to think about that the country was destroyed by the regime and at the same time I really enjoyed seeing the rundown train stations and things like this (Thomas).\n\nAs I have shown in this section aestheticizing and exoticizing filth serves more than just positioning it as a truthful and realistic side of Hungary. Their different response enables the younger generation to separate off from the attitudes and experiences of their elders and claim a unique experience in Hungary."
