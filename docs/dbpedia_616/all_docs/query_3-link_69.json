They also help CSP entrants and their families find accommodation and settle into the community.\n\nThe role of the Assyrian Australian Association is to provide settlement services support to CSP entrants within a 12-month period.\n\nAs an APO, the Assyrian Australian Association is responsible for:\n\nLinking employers with prospective humanitarian applicants;\n\nLodging visa applications; and\n\nEnsuring the provision and management of settlement services to these people following arrival within Australia, and assisting entrants to become financially independent within the first 12 months of arrival.\n\nThe Assyrian Australian Association has been assisting refugees since 1980, by providing support to humanitarian entrants and other eligible migrants in their first five years of life in Australia. We particularly focus on fostering social and economic participation, personal well-being, independence, and community connectedness."
