        "text": "4. Economic status of non-UK-born residents\n\nThe census does not collect data for why migrants come to the UK, but it does give insight into whether non-UK-born or those holding non-UK passports are in employment or not. In Census 2021, we asked everyone completing the census aged 16 years and over to answer the questions on their economic activity status.\n\nAs the census uses different labour market definitions from those used by the Labour Force Survey (LFS), estimates differ between these two sources. You can find further information in our Comparing Census 2021 and Labour Force Survey estimates of the labour market, England and Wales: March 2021 article.\n\nCensus 2021 took place during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, a period of unparalleled and rapid change. The national lockdown, associated guidance and furlough measures will have affected the labour market topic.\n\nHigh rates of employment can be seen for those born in the EU2 (80%), EU8 (79%) and Antarctica, Oceania and Other (75%) in Figure 2. Self-employment rates are especially high for EU2 and other non-EU-born compared with those born elsewhere. For those born in the UK, 56% were currently employed. This is to be expected when looking at all residents aged 16 years and over as the older UK-born population has a higher proportion of economically inactive people (35%).\n\nFigure 2: Employment rates of non-UK-born residents vary across different country of birth groupings\n\nEconomic activity by country of birth, usual residents aged 16 years and over, 2021, England and Wales\n\nEmbed code\n\nEmbed this interactive\n\nDownload the data\n\n.xlsx\n\nFor migrants who were in employment at the time of the census, we can look at the industries they were working in. Wholesale, retail and repair of motor vehicles (15.0%) is the most common industry for UK-born, followed by human health and social care (14.3%). These industries are also the most common for non-UK-born and for non-UK passport holders.\n\nA number of industries stand out as having overrepresentation or underrepresentation of non-UK-born workers compared with UK-born. In Figure 3, we see that non-EU workers are much more likely to be in human health and social work (19.5%) and information and communication (6.4%) than UK or EU-born workers. The most overrepresented industries for EU workers are accommodation and food service activities (7.9%) and manufacturing (10.5%). Both EU and non-EU-born are underrepresented in education and public administration and defence compared with UK-born workers.\n\nFigure 3: Industries have varying levels of over and underrepresentation of non-UK-born workers compared with UK-born\n\nPercentage of usual residents aged 16 years and over in employment by country of birth, 2021, England and Wales\n\nEmbed code\n\nEmbed this interactive\n\nDownload the data\n\n.xlsx\n\nBack to table of contents\n\n6. Country of birth by passports held\n\nIn this release, passports held have been prioritised by UK passport first, followed by Irish and then other passports. Where individuals hold more than one passport, we have only recorded them once based on this prioritisation. The interaction of country of birth and passports held allows us to look at how many non-UK-born have gained a UK passport and how many only hold an EU or non-EU passport.\n\nAfrican (63%), Middle East and Asian (59.1%) and other EU-born (Malta, Cyprus and Croatia, 71.2%) residents had the highest proportion of UK passport holders excepting those born in the UK and British Overseas territories (Figure 5). This contrasts with EU14 (23.9%), EU8 (7.5%) and EU2-born (7.5%) where a comparably small percentage of residents hold a UK passport.\n\nEU-born tend to have a very high proportion of residents holding an EU passport, in particular the EU8 (89.2%) and EU2 (86.9%). Non-EU born regions show a greater range of passports held, with a notable proportion of the Americas and Caribbean (14.4%), African (9.9%) and Other non-EU-born (21.0%) holding an EU passport. Wales and England show similar patterns for country of birth and passports held, though there is a notably higher proportion of Antarctica, Oceania and Other-born holding a UK passport (64.5%) in Wales.\n\nFigure 5: EU-born residents are less likely to hold a UK passport\n\nPercentage of non-UK-born residents by country of birth grouping and passports held, 2021, England and Wales\n\nEmbed code\n\nEmbed this interactive\n\nDownload the data\n\n.xlsx\n\nWhen breaking down into individual non-UK countries of birth, India (483,000, 52.5%), Pakistan (420,000, 67.4%) and Bangladesh (188,000, 69.0%) have the highest number of UK passport holders overall. Of the top 10, five are Middle East and Asian countries. Looking at the proportion of other passports held, EU countries make up 7 of the top 10 countries of birth. The top three from this list are Poland (663,000, 89.3%), Romania (477,000, 88.6%) and India (423,000, 45.9%).\n\nThe proportion of residents holding a UK passport can give an indication of naturalisation for non-UK countries of birth. Figure 6 looks at the top 10 and bottom 10 proportions of UK passports held across the top 60 non-UK countries of birth by total volume. Those born in African countries are the most likely to hold UK passports, with Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda having the highest proportions. The countries of birth with the lowest proportion of UK passports held are all EU member countries, except Moldova, with Lithuania, Moldova and Romania showing the lowest proportions.\n\nFigure 6: Those born in African countries are most likely to hold a UK passport while those from EU countries are least likely\n\nPercentage of residents who hold a UK passport, top and bottom 10 non-UK countries of birth (from top 60 most common non-UK countries of birth), 2021, England and Wales\n\nEmbed code\n\nEmbed this interactive\n\nDownload the data\n\n.xlsx\n\nNo passports held\n\nAround 1 in 6 (7.7 million) usual residents born in the UK did not hold a passport. Whereas around 1 in 29 (343,000) non-UK-born residents did not hold a passport\n\nThe reasons for this will vary by country, with many UK-born non-passport holders having no need for a passport, such as children or the elderly. For non-UK-born this may include:\n\nasylum seekers without travel documentation awaiting a decision\n\nthose born in the Republic of Ireland who did not require a passport to enter the UK\n\nthose from other EU countries who may have arrived here using a national identity card\n\nthose who may have acquired UK nationality but do not currently hold a passport\n\nthose who moved here whose passport has subsequently expired or not been renewed\n\nthose who settled in the UK under the Windrush scheme and did not require a passport\n\nthose who arrived as children on a parent's passport\n\nBack to table of contents\n\n7. Recent arrivals\n\nMigration by most recent year of arrival\n\nPeople born outside of the UK were asked when they most recently arrived to live in the UK. Migration is often temporary, and people who arrived in the UK more recently are more likely still to be present than those who arrived in earlier years. Census data can tell us how past migration patterns have contributed to the migrant population in 2021, but do not fully reflect all of the migration that took place in previous years.\n\nOur International migration, England and Wales: Census 2021 bulletin showed that of the 10.0 million non-UK-born residents, 4.2 million (42.4%) had reported their most recent arrival in 2011 or after. The largest group of these were born in the Middle East and Asia (1.3 million, 30%), with other substantial groups being the EU14 (713,000, 17%), EU2 (565,000, 13%), EU8 (550,000, 13%) and Africa (464,000, 11%). England and Wales both show similar trends here, with the majority of those recent arrivals to Wales also born in the Middle East and Asia (29,000, 32%).\n\nFigure 7 looks at what proportion of the non-UK-born population most recently arrived in England and Wales, in each year from the last decade. The Middle East and Asia make up a much larger proportion of those who arrived in the last three years. This reflects the large international student population from this area, and the more temporary nature of student migration. The proportion from the EU14 and Africa remains relatively stable. The EU8 shows a much lower proportion from 2015, following them making up almost 1 in 4 of those who arrived in 2013. Those born in the EU2 show a different picture, with a large increase from 2014, influenced by working restrictions for Romanian citizens being lifted in this year. The proportion of EU2-born has decreased over the last three years while the proportion of those born in the Middle East and Asia has increased.\n\nFigure 7: The countries of birth of non-UK-born arrivals have changed over the decade\n\nPercentage of non-UK-born residents by most recent year of arrival between 2011 and 2020 and country of birth, 2021, England and Wales\n\nEmbed code\n\nEmbed this interactive\n\nDownload the data\n\n.xlsx\n\nMigration in the year prior to Census 2021\n\nBecause of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, UK travel restrictions were enforced from March 2020 onwards and restrictions were also put in place in other countries across the world. As a result, migration to and from the UK in the year before the census was highly restricted.\n\nCensus 2021 asked non-UK-born residents when they most recently arrived to live in the UK, and how long they intended to stay. Migration to the UK in the year before the census can be identified by focusing only on those who arrived after March 2020 and intended to stay in the UK for 12 months or more.\n\nThe most common countries of birth for those who arrived in the year prior to the census were India (11.8%, 63,000), Romania (8.2%, 44,000), and China (6.1%, 33,000), seen in Figure 8. Compared with 2011, recent arrivals in 2021 were higher for those born in Romania, India, Nigeria and Hong Kong (Special Administrative Region of China), with Romania showing a much greater difference. In contrast, recent arrivals for those born in Poland and China were lower.\n\nFigure 8: More people born in India and Romania arrived in the year before Census 2021 than in the year before the 2011 Census\n\nTop arrivals by country of birth in year prior to Census 2021 compared with 2011, England and Wales\n\nEmbed code\n\nEmbed this interactive\n\nDownload the data\n\n.xlsx\n\nLooking at the age and sex breakdowns of the top three countries of birth in Figure 9, we see that those arriving in the year before the census who were Indian born were typically aged 20 to 34 years, and consisting of slightly more men. This is also true for those born in Romania, though there is a higher proportion of men aged 40 years and over. Those born in China show a very different picture, with 56% of recent arrivals aged 20 to 24 years, and 59% of overall arrivals, being women.\n\nConsidering all those arriving in the year before the census, the median age was just 26 years compared with 40 years of age for the overall population of England and Wales. Recent arrivals are more likely to be studying and are typically younger, while longer-term residents are more settled. This can be seen in the Indian and Chinese-born arrivals, though Romanian-born arrivals show a greater similarity to the total Romanian-born population.\n\nFigure 9: The age and sex distributions of non-UK born residents who arrived in the year prior to Census 2021 differ from the pattern for all non-UK born\n\nResident population by sex, five-year age bands and country of birth compared to those who arrived in year prior to Census 2021, England and Wales\n\nEmbed code\n\nEmbed this interactive\n\nDownload the data\n\n.xlsx\n\nEconomic activity for recent arrivals\n\nOf those who had most recently arrived in the year prior to Census 2021 (Figure 10), we can see that a large proportion of recent arrivals tend to be economically inactive students. This group make up the majority of recent arrivals for other EU (56%) and Middle East and Asian (37%) countries of birth, and a large proportion of those from the EU14 (32%). We plan to look at international students in more detail in a future article later this year.\n\nOther areas show a much lower proportion of economically inactive students and instead show high levels of employment, such as the EU2 (70%), Antarctica, Oceania and Other (61%), and the EU8 (61%). Of those in employment, EU2 and other non-EU-born also stands out for self-employment, with one in five self-employed (EU2, 21%; other non-EU, 19%). Similar trends can be seen when considering the types of passports held.\n\nFigure 10: Economically inactive students make up a large proportion of people who arrived in the year before Census 2021\n\nEconomic activity by country of birth, usual residents aged 16 years and over who arrived in the year before Census 2021, 2021, England and Wales\n\nEmbed code\n\nEmbed this interactive\n\nDownload the data\n\n.xlsx\n\nNon-UK-born arrivals over the last five years by local authority\n\nThe non-UK-born population who had recently arrived in the UK can also be looked at by local authority to show important areas of movement. The proportion of all non-UK-born by local authority who arrived in the last five years is shown in Figure 11.\n\nThe local authorities with the highest proportions of non-UK-born arriving recently tend to be those with large universities such as Cambridge and Oxford. The area with the highest proportion of arrivals in the last five years was West Suffolk. This is driven primarily by American-born residents and is expected to be linked to the US RAF base in the area. In Wales, the highest proportion was in Gwynedd.\n\nLocal authorities with a low proportion of recent arrivals included Rochford, Tendring and South Staffordshire. The lowest proportion of arrivals in Wales was in Caerphilly.\n\nFigure 11: The local authorities with the highest proportions of non-UK-born who arrived in the last five years tend to be university areas\n\nProportion of non-UK-born population who arrived in the past five years, 2021, local authorities in England and Wales\n\nEmbed code\n\nEmbed this interactive\n\nDownload the data\n\n.xlsx\n\nBack to table of contents\n\n9. Glossary\n\nLong-term international migration\n\nThe Office for National Statistics (ONS) Centre for International Migration uses the UN-recommended definition of a long-term international migrant: \"A person who moves to a country other than that of his or her usual residence for a period of at least a year (12 months), so that the country of destination effectively becomes his or her new country of usual residence.\"\n\nEU\n\nEU is the sum of the EU14, EU8 and EU2, plus Malta, Cyprus and Croatia (from 1 July 2013).\n\nEU14\n\nEU14 is Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Republic of Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain and Sweden.\n\nEU8\n\nEU8 is Czechia, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia.\n\nEU2\n\nEU2 is Romania and Bulgaria.\n\nOther EU\n\nOther EU is Malta, Cyprus and Croatia (from 2013).\n\nNon-EU\n\nNon-EU is the sum of the rest of the world including the rest of Europe. British nationals are excluded from these numbers.\n\nOther non-EU\n\nThe category \"Other non-EU\" refers to the following list of countries:\n\nAlbania, Andorra, Azerbaijan, Armenia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Belarus, Cyprus (Non-European Union), Faroe Islands, Georgia, Guernsey, Iceland, Isle of Man, Jersey, Kosovo, Liechtenstein, Monaco, Moldova, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Norway, Russia, San Marino, Serbia, Svalbard and Jan Mayen, Switzerland, Turkey, Ukraine, Vatican City.\n\nEconomic activity\n\nPeople aged 16 years and over are economically active if, between 15 March and 21 March 2021, they were:\n\nin employment (an employee or self-employed)\n\nunemployed, but looking for work and could start within two weeks\n\nunemployed, but waiting to start a job that had been offered and accepted\n\nIt is a measure of whether or not a person was an active participant in the labour market during this period. Economically inactive are those aged 16 years and over who did not have a job between 15 March to 21 March 2021. Or they are those aged 16 years and over who have not looked for work between 22 February to 21 March 2021 or could not start work within two weeks.\n\nThe census definition differs from International Labour Organization (ILO) definition used on the Labour Force Survey (LFS), so estimates are not directly comparable.\n\nEmployee\n\nAn employee is a person aged 16 years and over in employment doing paid work for an individual or organisation.\n\nThis relates to people's main jobs or, if not working at the time of Census 2021, their last main jobs.\n\nSelf-employed\n\nSelf-employed people aged 16 years and over who own and operate their own business, professional practice or similar enterprise, including those operated with a partner.\n\nThis relates to people's main jobs or, if not working at the time of the census, their last main jobs. This can include people who work freelance, which means someone who is self-employed and works (or worked) for different companies on particular pieces of work.\n\nSelf-employed people who are not freelance can have employees who work for them.\n\nIndustry\n\nClassifies people aged 16 years and over who were in employment between 15 March and 21 March 2021 by the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) code that represents their current industry or business.\n\nThe SIC code is assigned based on the information provided about a firm or organisation's main activity.\n\nEmployment by industry\n\nCensus estimates of the number of people employed by industry differ from estimates from the Business Register and Employment Survey (BRES). BRES collects data directly from business. In contrast, the census relies on respondent information about the business they work for in their main job only. The BRES estimates are the preferred measure of the number of jobs within each industry while the census estimates allow analysis of characteristics of people working in each industry not possible with the BRES data.\n\nBack to table of contents"
