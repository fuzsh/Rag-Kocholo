That’s why we passionately serve vulnerable people in crisis through comprehensive, effective, and innovative services that empower them to build better lives for themselves, their families, and their communities.\n\nVeteran Services\n\nVeteran Services\n\nHomelessness prevention/stabilization, parenting programs, financial assistance, and mental healthcare for Veterans and their families.\n\nCommunity Services\n\nCommunity Services\n\nHousing and employment for Veterans, families, seniors, children, and individuals requiring case management, clinical services, and life-skills training.\n\nEmergency Services\n\nEmergency Services\n\nWith a proven track record in disaster relief and recovery, Endeavors steps up to help our community’s most vulnerable individuals, including victims of hurricanes, tornadoes, public health crises, and inclement weather.\n\nMigrant Services\n\nMigrant Services\n\nDirect care, migrant wellness support, case management, home study and post-release services, staffing, and holistic programming for unaccompanied migrant children and families.\n\nENDEAVORS IS THE LARGEST PROVIDER OF SUPPORTIVE SERVICES FOR VETERAN FAMILIES.\n\nThe state of Texas is home to more than 1.4 million Veterans, which represents the second largest state Veteran population in the country. I understand the challenges facing our men and women in uniform as they return to civilian life, and I’m proud to work with Endeavors to provide support for Veterans and their families. Endeavors has compassionately served vulnerable populations for more than 50 years with a mission of restoring dignity and offering hope to Veterans.\n\n*The views and opinions presented herein are those of the author and do not necessarily represent the views of DoD or its Components.

Endeavors does just that. Founded on the belief that God calls us to love and serve all people, they offer compassionate, holistic care for vulnerable populations in our community – including physical and mental health resources.\n\nMAX LUCADO\n\nAmerica’s Pastor\n\nENDEAVORS’ CASE MANAGERS UNDERSTOOD THAT THERE IS NO ‘ONE SIZE FITS ALL’ RESPONSE TO DISASTERS.\n\nIn the aftermath of our recent experiences with disasters and emergencies, many organizations stepped up and assumed important roles. Endeavors became the largest Disaster Case Management provider in Puerto Rico working with 50 out of 78 municipalities. Their team and case managers helped us identify the immediate needs of those most impacted by Hurricane Maria while planning for long-term recovery.\n\nDAVID J. CARRASQUILLO MEDRANO\n\nHispanic Federation Puerto Rico\n\nWe honor America’s Veterans for their patriotism, love of country and willingness to serve and sacrifice for the common good.\n\nWe also know that military service sometimes comes at a personal cost for service members and their families. It is reassuring to know that Endeavors is there to help Veterans, regardless of the situation, to provide the services and hope needed to build better lives for them and their families.\n\n*The views and opinions presented herein are those of the author and do not necessarily represent the views of DoD or its Components.
