Take that into account when planning your stay in Hungary.\n\nYou must always carry photo identification (eg. Passport or Hungarian ID card) in case the Hungarian authorities ask you to prove your identity. They will not accept a copy.\n\nIf you become a resident in Hungary, you must apply at your local government office (kormányhivatal) for a Hungarian personal identification (ID) card (személyi igazolvány in Hungarian). You will need to show your permanent residence document (Nemzeti Letelepedési Engedély) and your address card (lakcímkártya), if you have one.\n\nIf you move to a different address in Hungary, you must register your new address at the local Government Office (Kormányablak).\n\nVisas and residency if you were living in Hungary before 1 January 2021\n\nIf you applied for your new residence card ‘Nemzeti Letelepedési Engedély’ by 31 December 2021, your rights are protected by the Withdrawal Agreement pending a decision on your application.
