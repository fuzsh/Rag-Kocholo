        "text": "We understand that if you are reaching out to us, it is likely that you feel you are in immediate and pressing danger and urgently wish to speak with a member of our team. While we wish we could provide immediate communication to every person that requests our help, the demand for our support far exceeds our team’s capacity.\n\nImmediately upon submitting a request for help, a case is created based on your request in our system and a case number is generated and is automatically communicated to you. You will also receive an email from us outlining next steps depending on the information you shared with us. These are the automated parts of our system that allow rapid case queuing .\n\nOnce we begin working on your case our caseworkers assess severity of risk and feasibility of support, alongside factors such as external and internal constraints. This then dictates what the wait times will look like for your file. Wait times vary substantially, and between communications with you, we will need to organize and verify the information you’ve provided to us.\n\nIn some cases, we will not be able to support your request. This is typically as a result of factors beyond our control, and occasionally is because the support you are seeking is not within our mission, mandate, or capacity. If we do not have the ability to support you, we endeavor to communicate this with you directly and clearly at the earliest possible juncture point. We appreciate that this can be very hard to receive, and while it is very difficult for us as well, it is more important to us to be honest and clear with you than to build false hope.\n\nWhile we appreciate that the process can be arduous and stressful, especially while waiting and experiencing increased threat or risk, please do not send multiple emails, – this slows down our response time as we have to reply to numerous duplicate requests and requires us to organize and clear inquiries instead of working with persons directly. While you wait, please research other routes to safety and make backup plans to support yourself.\n\nIf you know someone who needs help, direct them to the request for help page and ask them to fill in the form. You may help the person fill in the form if they are illiterate and/or do not speak any of the languages available to fill a request for help on our website.\n\nYou can support the person at risk by reading about the options for claiming landed refugee status in various countries around the world. Be a partner for them in exploring their options and developing a way to get them to safety.\n\nWe must have direct contact with the individual who needs our help. If we are unable to establish direct contact with the individual at risk, we will not be able to continue working on the request and will close the request.\n\nPlease DO NOT submit a request for help on behalf of someone else. The only exception is if the individual is being held against their will or is incarcerated. Please make this very clear with substantial detail regarding the circumstances if submitting a request of this kind.\n\nPlease note that we do not accept case referrals in-person at either of our office locations in Toronto or New York. This is for the safety and confidentiality of our work, the clients we serve, and our staff. If you choose to visit our office to request help on behalf of someone at risk, you will be directed to fill out the form available on our website.\n\nWrite or type your letter of support, then sign the letter and include a photocopy of your identification. Please carefully outline your relationship with the person at risk and what you have witnessed in relation to their history of persecution or need for support.\n\nIf you are a representative of an organization submitting a support letter on behalf of an individual at risk, please submit an organizational letterhead and provide contact information for follow up along with the supporting employee’s name and role. Send the letter of support to the person seeking help so they can then send it to us. Only submit your letter to us directly if the person you are concerned about cannot contact us directly or you lose touch with them during the intake process."
