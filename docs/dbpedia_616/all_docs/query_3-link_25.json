        "text": "What Expats Should Know about Hungarian Healthcare\n\nHungary offers universal healthcare that covers 100% of the population. Medical professionals are well-trained and public hospitals offer a wide range of services. Public insurance fully covers preventative and medically necessary treatments. Hungary’s healthcare system ranks 34th out of 195 in the Global Health Security Index.\n\nSome immigrants are eligible to use the public system, depending on their visa type. However, many choose to use the private system due to long wait times and language barriers. The more rural you’re living, the more difficult it can be to find English-speaking medical staff. Keep in mind, too, that certain foreigners moving to Hungary need to provide proof of insurance as part of their visa requirements.\n\nEven if the public system is available to you, you’ll still want to supplement with private coverage. International health insurance guarantees comprehensive coverage both in and out of Hungary. These plans offer coverage for medication and equipment that the public system in Hungary does not pay for.\n\nHungary Healthcare System Pros & Cons\n\nHealthcare in Hungary has its advantages and disadvantages. High-quality care is available in both public and private systems throughout the country and treatment is affordable. However, rural areas have limited options. Even in urban areas, clinics suffer from long wait times and a shortage of staff.\n\nPros of Hungary’s Healthcare System\n\nHungary has a universal healthcare system that is 100% free for many citizens. The government subsidizes anything not fully covered at a lower cost. Doctors and nurses are well-trained to provide quality care to anyone who needs it.\n\nEven within the private system, healthcare costs are lower in Hungary than in the United States or Western Europe. As a result, the country is becoming a popular destination for medical tourism. Dental work, plastic surgery, fertility treatments, orthopedic surgery and eye surgery are some of the most popular medical tourism treatments that foreigners visit to receive. As such, private clinics in these areas are thriving.\n\nCons of Hungary’s Healthcare System\n\nLack of funding is a perpetual issue in Hungary’s healthcare system. Public clinics suffer from staffing shortages, outdated equipment, and long waiting periods. Many doctors have switched to private clinics in search of higher pay and better working conditions.\n\nThere is also a notable divide in the public healthcare system between the services and amenities offered in rural and urban areas. Issues such as understaffing and limited diagnostic testing capacity are particularly serious in rural areas.\n\nIn recent years, the number of doctors working in Hungary has been decreasing as more young graduates and professionals leave the country. Meanwhile, the average age of healthcare workers is rising. One in two doctors is over the age of 50.\n\nAdditionally, for years, “gratitude payments” were an essential part of medical appointments in Hungary. This made it all but mandatory for patients to leave a tip when they had a medical appointment. The government officially banned this practice in January 2021, but the campaign to completely eliminate it is still ongoing.\n\nDoes Hungary Have Universal Healthcare?\n\nThe National Health Insurance Fund (NEAK) administers Hungary’s healthcare system. Payroll contributions, taxes, and co-pays on supplemental services are the primary funds of The NEAK. Payroll contributions are about 3% of an employee’s income. Employers then cover an additional 15%.\n\nThe NEAK fully covers children, parents with a baby at home, students, retirees, people with no income, those with disabilities, priests and other church employees at no cost at all.\n\nWhat Does a National Health Insurance Card Cover?\n\nYour insurance fully covers any preventative or necessary medical treatment. You must pay out of pocket for any care or medicine not prescribed by your doctor or a specialist.\n\nDental: Free up to age 18. Only emergency care for those over 18.\n\nOptical: Eye exams and required surgeries are covered. Optional care such as LASIK is not covered.\n\nMental Health: Services such as general psychiatric examinations, drug therapy, and counseling are available but limited.\n\nAlternative Care: If prescribed by your primary care physician, some alternative treatments are covered.\n\nPrescription Drugs: Medicine given in the hospital is fully covered. At pharmacies, the costs are subsidized.\n\nHow to Access & Receive Healthcare in Hungary\n\nHospitals (“kórház”), clinics and pharmacies (“patika”) are available throughout the country. If you are paying into the public system, you’ll get a national health card, known as a TAJ card (“TAJ kártya”). Once you have that, you’ll need to register with a general practitioner (GP or “háziorvos”) in your district. Outside of emergencies, all medical treatment in Hungary requires a doctor’s referral to be covered. The GP you select will be your first stop for any non-emergency healthcare needs.\n\nIn case of an emergency, dial 112. Help is available in English 24/7 at this number. Emergency first aid is available to everyone, including tourists. However, you’ll need to pay for the services you receive. Make sure you purchase an International Health Insurance plan to cover any medical expenses.\n\nAdditionally, a global medical plan will cover your costs at a private clinic. Visiting a private hospital or clinic means much shorter waiting times, access to a wider range of specialists, and more comfortable, modern facilities. If you have private insurance, your provider can give you a list of hospitals and facilities that they work with.\n\nHealthcare for Expats in Hungary\n\nExpats who are employed locally and are paying taxes may be eligible for public coverage. The public system may also accept your insurance from your home country — check before you go.\n\nWho is Eligible for Hungarian Healthcare?\n\nRefugees and foreigners who are legally working or studying full-time in Hungary qualify for public health insurance. To enroll, you’ll need to visit your local NEAK office. For your appointment, you’ll need the following documents:\n\nID card or passport\n\nResidency permit\n\nAddress card\n\nProof that you paid the health insurance contribution (via paystub)\n\nOnce you enroll in the public system, you will get a national health insurance card and a health insurance number.\n\nVisitors from the EU and the EEA can use their European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) in Hungary. Note that you must apply for your EHIC before leaving your home country. Additionally, Hungary and the UK have a reciprocal health agreement. As such, British citizens receive free healthcare in Hungary and vice versa.\n\nExpat Insurance for Hungary\n\nInternational citizens should carry their own private global medical policy to cover any possible health-related expenses that come up. While foreigners may be eligible to use the public system, most tend to carry private insurance. Private clinics offer shorter waiting times, a wider range of medical treatments and English-speaking staff.\n\nFor a more in-depth understanding of your options, check out our Insurance in Hungary for Foreigners page.\n\nRecommended Health Insurance in Hungary for US Citizens\n\nGeoBlue sets itself apart by offering 24/7 assistance along with global telehealth no matter where you are in the world.\n\nRecommended Health Insurance in Hungary for Non-US Expats\n\nCigna offers comprehensive care and customizable cost-effective plans.\n\nRelated:"
