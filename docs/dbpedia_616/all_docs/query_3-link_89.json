        "text": "\"I joined AMCS because Sofie, now my Care Advisor, met and spoke with me and my wife, Eleni. Sofie was friendly and patient, taking the time to understand our needs and provided information and prices in a clear and honest manner. This gave us the confidence to choose AMCS. Eleni felt we would be a good match. Everyone is friendly, and AMCS support me to live at home.\"\n\n\"My family and I find AMCS staff and carers friendly, reliable and trustworthy. I’ve always liked baking for my family because it brings everyone together. With my carer's help, I can still cook for them. They are professionals and we are very grateful for their support and care. Special mention to Tabi, Tina P. and Dr Lara Jakica.\"\n\n\"AMCS is the light of hope shining in my life keeping me going strong throw away any hard time that God allowed me to pass through it. God bless you all. My Care Advisor supports me v. kindly. Thank you from the bottom of my heart. Love you all. God bless you all.\"\n\n\"I have arthritis and my eyesight is not good. My support worker is nice and we get along well. She keeps my house clean, changes the bedsheets and helps with transport. I do not know how I would survive without these services.\"\n\n\"At 83, it’s a bit hard to do everything. The worst part is changing the bed sheets. I can’t lift the mattress. My support worker comes every fortnight. I can rely on her for general things and don’t even have to tell her what to do.\"\n\n\"AMCS is a very good company and they see that I have all I need. The service and my support worker are great. My care advisor, Sofie, looks after me well. She rings me and asks how I am going. I am very happy.\"\n\n\"I have been very happy with all the support workers that have come from AMCS to help me at my home. I have never had anyone who was not nice. My gardener, Andrew, is a lovely man who works hard and calls me if he changes the days he works. Sofie has been wonderful, so understanding and easy to talk to. She helps me to stay in my home and meets all my needs. The coordinators are very helpful with changes to the service and the occupational therapist provided me with strategies. The changes have helped me to stay safe in my home. Everything I have said is true from my heart.\"\n\n\"My care advisor is an amazing girl that I can't speak highly enough about. She makes me feel as if she is one of my grandkids. She works with all her heart, looking after me. She remembers my shopping when I forget anything. She really supports me during this hard time, especially when I couldn't see anyone else. She deserves my respect and love. All thanks to you, Anthelia, and AMCS. All the support and services I have received from the package helped me to live independently and safely at home.”\n\n\"We are happy with the service we receive from AMCS as it is always of a high standard.The two carers, Ewa and Natalia, who visit our home on a regular basis, are very good, efficient and friendly. We are happy with them.We are also satisfied with, Faten, our care advisor. Whenever we call her, she always listens and everything is resolved promptly.\"\n\n\"My husband initially joined AMCS after he came back from the hospital. The staff did whatever he asked and were accommodating. When the time came for me to have a Home Care Package, it wasn’t even a question on my preferred provider. Everybody is helpful, always responsive and I like the services very much. I love everything. AMCS not only looks after me, but also, they organise activities, outings and clubs.\"\n\n\"Transferring to AMCS is one of the best decisions I ever had. They’re able to understand and respect my culture and communicate in my language. Whenever I need support from my case manager, she attends to it very promptly. She calls and checks on me regularly which makes me feel like I’m not alone anymore. AMCS is my family now.\"\n\n\"Two of the carers, Aneta and Jacqui are the most dedicated carers I have. When they clean it is perfection and I don’t even have to tell them anything. When I’m depressed they know what to say and do make me feel someone cares.\""
