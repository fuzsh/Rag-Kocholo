Concerns about Libyan destabilising activities in the Pacific region, part of a broader sponsorship by Muammar Gaddafi of such activities around the world, led to the expulsion of the Bureau in Canberra in 1987.[275][276]\n\nAs part of the thawing of relations between Libya and Western nations following Gaddafi's post 9-11 policy u-turns, diplomatic relations were restored in 2002, the Libyan People's Bureau reopened in Canberra and the Australian ambassador in Rome resumed non-resident accreditation. This has remained the case, though with the Bureau's name reverting to embassy following the overthrow of Gaddafi.\n\nAustralia was a major non-military backer of the revolutionaries during the Libyan Civil War, sending more humanitarian aid to Libya than any other single country after the United States.[277][278] It was relatively early to recognise the NTC, doing so on 9 June 2011, months before the capture of Tripoli.[279][280]\n\nIn December 2011, when then Australian Foreign Affairs Minister Kevin Rudd travelled to Libya to meet with Libyan Prime Minister Abdurrahim El-Keib.

Australia maintained relations with the Khmer Republic following the military coup of 1970. The Australian embassy closed in 1975 ahead of the fall of Phnom Penh to the Khmer Rouge on 17 April 1975. That day, Australia recognised the Royal Government of National Union of Kampuchea, soon replaced by the fully Khmer Rouge-controlled government of Democratic Kampuchea, but diplomatic relations were effectively suspended during the entire period of Khmer Rouge rule.\n\nIn solidarity with ASEAN countries, Australia did not recognise the People's Republic of Cambodia following the 1979 Vietnamese invasion, and continued to recognise the Democratic Kampuchea government-in-exile. However, it withdrew recognition on 14 February 1981 in response to information about the atrocities committed by the Khmer Rouge.[447]\n\nAustralia played a leading role in the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia in the early 1990s.

In 2020 Australia accounted for $53.5 billion (2.1%) of China's exports, ranking 13th among its top trade partners.[457] Prior to travel restrictions imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic, Australia was a major destination for Chinese tourists and students.\n\nBeginning in mid-2017, the relationship has significantly deteriorated. Points of friction include Australia's ban on Huawei's participation in the implementation of a 5G network on national security grounds; new Australian foreign investment and anti-espionage laws; Australian criticism of China in relation to its stance on the South China Sea dispute, the treatment of the Uyghurs in Xinjiang and changes in electoral and security laws in Hong Kong; a new defence pact between Australia and Japan and reactivation of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue with the United States, Japan and India; Australia's lead in calling for an independent international investigation into the origins of COVID-19; and the formation of AUKUS in September 2021, under which the US and the UK will help Australia to acquire nuclear-powered submarines.[458] By 2020 China had suspended all high-level diplomatic and trade dialogue channels and halted trade in a number of economically important sectors.[459]\n\nIn July 2019, the UN ambassadors from 22 nations, including Australia, signed a joint letter to the UNHRC condemning China's mistreatment of the Uyghurs as well as its mistreatment of other minority groups, urging the Chinese government to close the Xinjiang re-education camps.[460]\n\nIn November 2020 the Chinese embassy in Australia released to the media a long list of grievances, which were promptly rejected by the Australian Government.[461] Through 2021 and much of 2022, relations between the two countries remained tense.[462] Following the election of the Albanese government in May 2022, leader and ministerial contacts have modestly restarted.[463]\n\nAustralians` trust in China has plunged. The 2021 Lowy Institute Poll, released in June 2021, found only 16 per cent of Australian respondents trusted China \"a great deal\" or \"somewhat\" to act responsibly in the world – a third of the number from 2018.[464]\n\nGeorgia 16 July 1992\n\nAustralia recognised Georgia's independence and established diplomatic relations in 1992.\n\nAustralia's embassy in Turkey is accredited to Georgia. Georgia has an embassy in Canberra and an honorary consulate in Melbourne.\n\nIn 2008 Australia provided $1 million in humanitarian aid to Georgia in the aftermath of the Russo-Georgian War. Australia has supported Georgia's sovereignty and territorial integrity in international fora and does not recognise the breakaway republics of Abkhazia and South Ossetia established with Russian support.\n\nThere is a small community of Georgian-born people in Australia and modest trade relations.[465]\n\nIndia 1941 See Australia–India relations[466]\n\nIndia established diplomatic relations with Australia in 1941, six years before its independence. The Australian Government subsequently supported the independence of India and Pakistan from the British Empire.[467]\n\nIndia and Australia share close historical ties, with both countries being former British colonies and members of the Commonwealth of Nations. They also share close sporting ties, with both countries sharing their passion for cricket.[468] They also compete against each other in field hockey and in the Commonwealth Games.\n\nEconomic relations between the two nations is strong, with India being Australia's fourth largest export partner and the eighth largest trading partner.[469]\n\nIn 1963 Australia provide defence aid to India in the face of Chinese action.[470]\n\nIn 2009, relations were strained between the two nations by attacks on Indian students (termed Curry Bashings) in Melbourne.[471] Police denied any racial motivation, but this was viewed differently by the Government of India leading to high-level meetings with Australian officials.[472]\n\nThe persistent refusal of Australia to sell uranium to India due to the latter not being a signatory to the NPT has also hampered bilateral relations. However, this policy was reversed in 2011.[473]\n\nOn 4 June 2020, India and Australia signed an agreement to provide access to one another's military bases, in order to help facilitate joint military exercises. Known as the Mutual Logistics Support Agreement, it allows each country to use the other's bases for the refuelling and maintenance of aircraft and naval vessels.[474] The agreement was reached over a virtual summit between Prime Ministers Narendra Modi and Scott Morrison due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[475]\n\nPM Albanese attended the 75 Years of Friendship through Cricket Event hosted by PM Modi in March 2023 to celebrate 75 years of strong diplomatic and cricketing ties between the two nations. During this trip, Albanese visited New Delhi to attend the Australia-India Annual Leaders' Summit. During the visit, he also led a trade delegation, which included Trade Minister Don Farrell and Resources Minister Madeleine King, after the implementation of the Economic Cooperation and Trade Agreement (ECTA) between Australia and India on 29 December 2022.\n\nAlbanese attended the 2023 G20 New Delhi summit in India.\n\nIndonesia 17 March 1950 See Australia–Indonesia relations\n\nBilateral relations between the two neighboring countries are among their most important.\n\nAustralia was supportive of Indonesian independence after World War II, particularly after giving de facto recognition to the Republican government of Indonesia on July 9, 1947,[476] and subsequently advocated for it in the United Nations. Australia recognized the United States of Indonesia on December 27, 1949, immediately following the completion that day of transfer of sovereignty by the Netherlands.[477] Diplomatic relations were formally established on 17 March 1950 and the Australian consulate-general in Jakarta was raised to an embassy.[478] An Indonesian embassy was opened in Canberra in April 1950.\n\nAustralia maintains an embassy in Jakarta (see List of ambassadors of Australia to Indonesia) and consulates-general in Bali, Makassar and Surabaya.\n\nIndonesia maintains an embassy in Canberra (see List of ambassadors of Indonesia to Australia), consulates-general in Melbourne, Perth and Sydney and a consulate in Darwin.\n\nThe relationship has gone through some strained periods, despite which both countries sought to avoid ruptures and Australia has maintained a significant development aid program since Indonesian independence.\n\nThroughout the 1950s Australia did not recognize Indonesian claims to Western New Guinea though by the early 1960s it became reconciled to Indonesian administration and recognized the results of the controversial 1969 Act of Free Choice whereby Indonesia assumed full sovereignty over the territory. While in subsequent decades the Australian government has taken care to reassure Indonesia with regard to its full support for Indonesian territorial integrity, there continues to be an important constituency within Australia supporting Western New Guinea self-determination and the switch of Australian policy on East Timor remains a cautionary example for Indonesian politicians.\n\nAustralia vigorously supported Malaysia during the Indonesia-Malaysia confrontation during 1963-1966, contributing to the Commonwealth military forces supporting Malaysia.\n\nAustralia was suspicious of President Sukarno's flirtation with the Communist Party of Indonesia and relations stabilized and grew closer following President Suharto's rise to power in 1966 and adoption of a strong anti-communist stance.\n\nAustralia and Indonesia share the world’s longest maritime boundary and are naturally close maritime partners. In 1971 and 1972, Australia and Indonesia agreed to maritime boundaries establishing the limits of their respective continental shelves.\n\nThe Whitlam government and Fraser government supported Indonesia's seizure of Portuguese Timor in 1975, and Australia granted de facto recognition in January 1978 and de jure recognition effectively by early 1979 when seabed boundary negotiations for the East Timor sector and Australian ministerial visits to the territory commenced. This was not formally confirmed until the mid 1980s under the Hawke government.[479] The Timor Gap Zone of Co-operation Treaty was signed in December 1989. In late 1998, the Howard government advised Indonesia of a change in policy, advocating for a referendum in East Timor in which independence was an option. Public anger in Australia towards the Indonesian military and paramilitary violence in the province during the 1999 East Timorese crisis was followed by an Australian-led international peace-keeping force taking control of the territory in the lead up to formal independence.\n\nSince the early 2000s the bilateral relationship has been on a stronger footing, despite the 2013 Australia–Indonesia spying scandal.\n\nThe 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake prompted a significant humanitarian response from Australia, including a A$1 billion aid package for Indonesia from the Australian federal government supplemented by over A$150 million in aid from state government and private contributions.\n\nAustralia’s development partnership with Indonesia has continued and the annual budget in 2022-23 was $307.3 million. An A$200 million Australia-Indonesia Climate and Infrastructure Partnership was announced by Prime Minister Anthony Albanese following his visit to Jakarta in June 2022.[480]\n\nThe Australia-Indonesia relationship was elevated to a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership in 2018. Regular high level dialogue is maintained through the Indonesia-Australia Annual Leaders' Meeting; Foreign and Defence Ministers' 2+2 Meeting; Ministerial Council on Law and Security; Economic, Trade and Investment Ministers' Meeting; Economic Policy Dialogue and the Ministerial Energy Dialogue. In February 2020 President Joko Widodo addressed the Australian Parliament during a state visit celebrating the 70th anniversary of diplomatic relations.[481]\n\nSecurity cooperation has been defined through a series of Australia–Indonesia Security Agreements, most significantly the Lombok Treaty signed in 2006. Australia and Indonesia work closely together to combat people smuggling and human trafficking, including by co-chairing the Bali Process on People Smuggling, Trafficking in Persons and Related Transnational Crime.\n\nThe Indonesia-Australia Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (IA-CEPA) creates the framework to promote closer economic engagement between the two countries. In 2022 Australia's goods and services exports to Indonesia totaled A$14.6 billion and imports totaled A$8.7 billion including A$2.7 billion in Australian tourism earnings. In 2022 Australian investment in Indonesian stocks totaled just over A$3 billion, and Indonesian investment in Australian stocks totaled over A$800 million.[482]\n\nThere are long-standing family, cultural, sporting education, and tourism connections between the two nations. At the end of June 2021, 89,480 Indonesian-born people were living in Australia (see Indonesian Australians).[483] In 2022 almost 17,000 Indonesians were studying in Australia. The two countries are among the top destinations for tourism for each.[484]\n\nIran 21 September 1968\n\nOn 29 June 1968 Australia announced that it had agreed with Iran to establish diplomatic relations.[485] An Australian embassy was established in Tehran with the first Australian ambassador presenting credentials on 21 September 1968.[486] Iran has had an embassy in Canberra since 1971.\n\nGovernor-General Paul Hasluck attended the Iranian monarchy's 2500th anniversary celebrations in October 1971.[487] The then Shah of Iran Mohammad Reza Pahlavi made a state visit to Australia in September 1974 to promote economic, scientific and political cooperation between the two countries.[488] This was reciprocated in March 1975 by the visit of Australian Governor-General John Kerr.[489]\n\nDiplomatic relations have been maintained without interruption through the Iranian Revolution of 1979 and the replacement of the monarchy with an Islamic republic.\n\nTwo-way trade has diminished in recent years but the value of Australia's two-way goods and services trade with Iran was $319 million in the 2019-20 financial year. Traditionally, Iran has been one of Australia's leading wheat export destinations, and other primary exports include wool and meat.[490]\n\nAustralia, like most Western countries, has expressed concerns about Iran's human-rights record and its nuclear-weapons program.[491] Although not a signatory to"
