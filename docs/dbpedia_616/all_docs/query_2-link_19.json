        "text": "MIGRATION AND ASYLUM IN CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPE\n\nLIBE 104 EN\n\nHUNGARY\n\nMigration Asylum Main Difficulties\n\n1. Migration\n\nThe characteristics of migration in Hungary are related to both its geographical situation and its history, including the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and the strong migration patterns of Hungarians living in neighbouring countries. The relative openness of Hungary's former communist government also explains the peculiarity of the situation.\n\nMany migrants use Hungary as a springboard to further migration, because it is the most 'Western' country of the region. It allows migrants to settle, experiment and prepare for further migration 74. The social status of transit migrants is diverse. Among them are intellectuals, manual workers and small-scale market traders. Over half are under the age of 30 75.\n\nThe legislation regarding residence of foreigners and the rules concerning foreign labour are rather strict in Hungary. At the same time, entering the country as a tourist is possible as a result of visa-free agreements with neighbouring countries and others. These contribute to the high number of foreigners staying illegally in Hungary or trying to migrate further.\n\nThe situation with regard to permanent migration has fluctuated, the number of foreigners holding work permits decreasing from 48,700 in 1990 to 18-20,000 per year in the following years. The largest group is Romanian, although their numbers are going down. There is an increasingly large group of Chinese; many of them run small businesses, some of them to launder money and others to find investment opportunities. The number of Chinese currently resident in Hungary is estimated at 10,000. In addition, Russian and Bulgarian capital is increasingly finding its way into Hungarian banks 76.\n\nIllegal migration and trafficking in human beings\n\nIllegal migration, and international organized crime related to the smuggling of people has rapidly increased. By the end of 1998, the number of illegal immigrants was 40% more than in 1997.\n\nForgery of official documents, for instance, involved 1,321 persons in the first half of 1998, 2,640 persons in 1997. In 1997, 391 persons were arrested for assisting in illegal border crossings, in 1998 (up until June) the number was 252 77. The majority of them were smuggling people, but it was impossible to prove a criminal act. In certain cases, women travelling from the Baltic States or the CIS to the West, obviously for the purpose of prostitution, are observed, but they do not commit offences under Hungarian law because they travel legally.\n\nNationalities of traffickers in human beings\n\nRomanian\n\nHungarian\n\nSlovak\n\nYugoslav\n\nTurk\n\nChinese\n\n1996\n\n20\n\n94\n\n29\n\n18\n\n5\n\n1\n\n1997\n\n16\n\n186\n\n23\n\n13\n\n2\n\n1\n\n1998 (30.6.98)\n\n5\n\n93\n\n10\n\n7\n\n0\n\n0\n\nSource: Ministry of the Interior, Budapest, October 1998\n\nBorder controls\n\nSince the adoption of the new law on border protection in November 1997, border guards are authorized to carry out investigations in the field of organized crime. Already since 1989, border control has changed significantly in order to bring its practice in Hungary into conformity with European standards. Enlisted personnel have been replaced by professional staff. Special organizations like the directorates' investigations groups and the Border Guard Action Service have been set up.\n\nThe most active border section is that of Austria, followed by the Romanian, the Slovenian and the Slovakian sections 78.\n\nStricter rules were introduced in October 1991 to ensure a consistent check upon requirements for entry into the country (validity of travel documents, visa, money required to stay in Hungary, etc.).\n\nThe Act on controlling foreigners, which entered into force on 1 May 1994, reinforced the possibilities for the Hungarian authorities to restrict entry at their borders. Large-scale border traffic, international organized crime and illegal immigration have necessitated a renewal of the system of control which is also necessary to bring it in line with the guidelines of the Schengen Agreement. Hungary has introduced a double screening system which meets the control technology principles of the Schengen Agreement (Article 6, § 2). In the course of preparations for joining the Schengen Agreement, the information system must be completed. On internal borders, efficient control is carried out at permanently operating border check points. The representative of the Republic of Hungary underlined that abolition of the obligation to carry visas for citizens of neighbouring countries is possible if border controls are improved 79.\n\nHungary is participating in the Budapest Group on illegal migration 80.\n\nUnauthorized border crossing\n\n1993\n\n1994\n\n1995\n\n1996\n\n1997\n\n1998 (30.6.98)\n\nTOTAL\n\n15,025\n\n12,988\n\n12,059\n\n10,579\n\n12,432\n\n4,539\n\n67,622\n\nSource: Ministry of the Interior, Budapest, October 1998\n\nNumber of those expelled or returned by country\n\n1993\n\n1994\n\n1995\n\n1996\n\n1997\n\nRomania\n\n592,066\n\n139,706\n\n138,382\n\n101,599\n\n32,258\n\nYugoslavia\n\n33,538\n\n16,764\n\n7,409\n\n7,230\n\n6,520\n\nCIS\n\n39,543\n\n38,672\n\n2,035\n\n-\n\n-\n\nUkraine\n\n-\n\n34,389\n\n154,290\n\n128,831\n\n5,054\n\nBulgaria\n\n16,753\n\n11,021\n\n8,361\n\n11,021\n\n432\n\nSource: Ministry of the Interior, Budapest, October 1998\n\nReadmission agreements\n\nReadmission agreements - number of persons sent back to their country\n\nSource: Ministry of the Interior, Budapest, October 1998\n\nThe Ministry of the Interior considers that asylum seekers' applications can always have priority 81, though NGOs and UNHCR consider that these readmission agreements do not necessarily take into account the special protection needs of asylum seekers, which is a cause of concern 82.\n\n2. Asylum\n\nSince 1989, Hungary has registered more than 54,000 refugees from Romania (the majority of whom were ethnic Hungarians who fled Ceaucescu's policy against minorities) and received more than 75,000 refugees when war broke out in the former Yugoslavia 83. For 1998 (up until 31 July), 2,159 persons applied for asylum, mainly from Kosovo (24%), Afghanistan (19.5%), Iraq (11.4%), Algeria (8.6%) and Sierra Leone (7.2%).\n\nIn the past 10 years, around 4,300 people have been granted refugee status 84, including 116 persons in 1996, 27 in 1997 and 243 in 1998 (up until July).\n\nPercentage of approvals\n\n1989\n\n1990\n\n1991\n\n1992\n\n1993\n\n1994\n\n1995\n\n1996\n\n1997\n\n1998(June)\n\n97.2\n\n72.7\n\n47.1\n\n103*\n\n77.1\n\n115.5*\n\n89.2\n\n50\n\n15.25\n\n12.14\n\nSource: Ministry of the Interior, Budapest, October 1998\n\n* In excess of 100% because of the number of cases started in the preceding year and evaluated in the current year\n\nProcedure and legal basis\n\nHungary was the first of the countries in Central and Eastern Europe to join the Geneva Convention, and its 1967 Protocol, in March 1989. Due to the prevailing political and economic circumstances, a geographical reservation was made for people persecuted as a result of events in Europe only. Non-European refugees could not apply for asylum, though there was a special agreement with the UNHCR Office. This reservation was lifted in March 1998.\n\nNational legislation related to refugees is primarily contained in the new asylum law (March 1998) which represents a 'distinct improvement of the system in place since 1989 (...). The lifting of the geographic limitation, the discontinuation of the 72-hour time-limit for lodging an application, the procedure and status established for beneficiaries of temporary protection and for persons who may not be Convention refugees, but whose expulsions raise compelling human rights issues are major achievements of the new legislation. 85\n\nTasks relating to asylum were transferred from police administration to civil administration in March 1998. A separate organization for the evaluation of asylum requests has been created, the ORMA (Office for Migration and Refugee Affairs). Applications must be submitted to its local organs.This office also decides on appeals against request refusals. Applicants who are rejected may initiate judicial procedures to review the Office's decisions.\n\nORMA makes a decision within 60 days of submission of the claim. The deadline can be extended by 30 days in justified cases. The decision, in Hungarian language, has to be announced in the applicant´s mother tongue or in any other language spoken by the applicant. The decision must be in writing.\n\nThe applicant may request a judicial review of the decision within 5 days. The court has to decide within 15 days.\n\nThe rejection of an asylum request in an EU Member State is not in itself a reason for rejection in Hungary, although it is taken into account.\n\nRole of UNHCR\n\nUNHCR established an office in Budapest in 1989 to help the Hungarian government cope with the influx of tens of thousands of Romanians. It has also assisted in developing national NGOs that can help refugees integrate into Hungarian society.\n\nAccording to the Hungarian Act of Asylum the representative of UNHCR may take part in any stage of the refugee status determination procedure. He may be present at the applicant´s interview, gain access to refugee documents and make copies. A sample of the decision is sent to UNHCR.\n\nConvention refugee status\n\nConvention refugees have almost the same rights as Hungarian citizens. They are entitled to unlimited stay in Hungary, to be employed without obtaining a work permit, to a free Hungarian language course, vocational training, housing service and to apply for Hungarian citizenship in an expedited manner. The only differences with Hungarian citizens are that they are exempt from military service and cannot vote.\n\nPeople with refugee status are entitled to receive a one-off settlement payment and may be given interest- free housing, rent benefit or a contribution to their accommodation expenses. Furthermore, in addition to reimbursement of their Hungarian language tuition fees, they are entitled to free basic medical services, access to nursery schools, education or training, as well as to the cost-free translation into Hungarian of their personal documents.\n\nRecently, a number of asylum seekers have been appearing in Hungary who do not speak Hungarian and do not have any vocational skills. This growing trend has necessitated the organization of free vocational and language courses for refugees 86.\n\nTemporary protection\n\nAccording to the Asylum Act there are two types of non-Convention status. An applicant might be recognized as a temporary protected person or a person authorized to stay 87.\n\nNumber of asylum seekers from former Yugoslavia 88\n\n1991\n\n1992\n\n1993\n\n1994\n\n1995\n\n1996*\n\n1997*\n\n48 485\n\n15 021\n\n4 593\n\n2 386\n\n5 046\n\n65\n\n26\n\nSource: Ministry of the Interior, Budapest, December 1997\n\n* UNHCR Budapest, December 1997 (figures until 30 October 1997)\n\nFollowing the Dayton Agreement, the government stopped admitting refugees from former Yugoslavia from 15 January 1996, except in specific cases such as family reunification.\n\nAs of 15 January 1997, there were 4,469 persons registered under the temporary protection regime; as of 15 September 1997 the number was 3,445 and 1,710 as of 15 October 1998.\n\nSince January 1998, due to an amendment to the Law on Employment, beneficiaries of the temporary protection regime holding a temporary residence permit do not need permission from the competent labour authority to undertake work in Hungary (while other aliens do need such permission).\n\nPersons authorized to stay are foreigners who cannot be returned to their country temporarily because they would be exposed to capital punishment, torture, inhuman or degrading treatment. 30 persons are in this position 89.\n\nMain difficulties\n\nAsylum\n\nThere are some shortcomings in the law on asylum, as well as in practice, but UNHCR considers these will be improved by the Hungarian authorities. The following should be improved: the training of eligibility officers and interpreters, the conditions of border guards' community shelters, the information given to asylum seekers on their rights, the updating of the country of origin database, the integration of recognized refugees.\n\nAs a consequence of mandatory medical screening (tuberculosis, parasites, venereal diseases) in the course of the asylum procedure, a refusal may be based on the grounds of endangering public health, which is in contradiction to the provisions of the 1951 Convention.\n\nDue to a pre-screening procedure which is applied in practice (without any kind of legal basis), 80% of the applicants allowed to enter the first instance procedure are Hungarians from neighbouring countries (mainly from Romania), as well as 80% of refugees recognized.\n\nDue to the recent change of regime, the security police (normally in charge of the investigation of criminal cases) have been authorized to deal with refugees arriving at Budapest airport despite the fact that they have had no proper training in this area.\n\nImmigration\n\n-Several human rights organizations, such as the Hungarian Helsinki committee, the Hungarian Human Rights Centre and the Refugee Association, have criticized provisions dealing with asylum seekers and foreigners in the anti-crime legislative package before Parliament (November 1998) 90 because they do not respect international human rights standards.\n\n-Human rights organizations protest about the treatment of illegal immigrants and claim that Hungary illegally holds immigrants in border guard centres for months in very bad conditions because of the sudden increase in the number of illegal immigrants 91.\n\nNOTES\n\n74.
