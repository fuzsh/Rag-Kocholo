        "text": "In 1788, European settlement began in Australia when the First Fleet arrived from Britain and established a penal colony in what is today the city of Sydney. At least eight Jewish men and women, and maybe as many as 15, were shipped in as prisoners. Most were accused of petty theft, such as 15-year-old Esther Abrahams, who was charged with stealing two lengths of black lace. Sentenced to seven years in Australia, she brought her infant daughter with her.\n\nIn the ensuing years, many more Jews came over as prisoners, middle-class free settlers, and then as part of the Gold Rush influx in the 1850s. By 1861, there were an estimated 3,000 Jews in the country, growing to 15,000 by the turn of the century.\n\nBy the 19th century, there was an established Jewish community, overwhelmingly made up of free settlers. This gave way to a greater concentration of Jews in Australia’s major cities, namely Sydney and Melbourne, as fear of assimilation caused the Australian Jewish community to consolidate their populations at the end of the century.\n\nPrior to World War I, there was a second, greater wave of refugees from the pogroms in Russia and Poland that arrived in Australia in the 1890s and early 1900s. Further Jewish immigration occurred in the 1920s, mainly from eastern Europe.\n\nIn the late 1930s, about 4,500 German and Austrian Jews fled to Australia to escape the rise of Nazism. In addition, 2542 'enemy aliens' deported from Britain disembarked HMT Dunera in Melbourne and Sydney in 1940. Most were Jewish refugees who had fled Nazi persecution in Germany and Austria. They were interned in camps near Hay and Orange in NSW and Tatura in Victoria. Almost all of them remained and settled permanently in Australia after the war, with many achieving great distinction in academia, business, and the arts.\n\nThe late 1980s and ‘90s saw an influx of Jews from the former Soviet Union and consistent immigration from South Africa. Since Jews have been part of Australian society since its colonization and settlement, and many came from Britain and were therefore English-speaking, they quickly integrated and became part and parcel of Australian society without facing the antisemitism and roadblocks limiting Jews in many other countries. As a result, Australian Jews have consistently been involved in every facet of Australian life, holding important positions in the arts, education, philanthropy, politics, science, medicine, the legal system, and the military.\n\nGeneral Sir John Monash, a distinguished general and commander of the Australian Corps during the latter part of World War I, is considered by many to be the most famous military commander in Australian history. Sir Isaac Isaacs was the first Jewish Governor-General of Australia, serving from 1931 to 1936, and Sir Zelman Cowen held the position from 1977 to 1982. Mark Dreyfus is currently Australia’s Attorney General. Josh Frydenberg served as Australia’s Treasurer until 2022. Other noteworthy Jews currently holding high offices are Linda Dessau, Governor of Victoria, and Justice James Edelman, who sits on Australia’s highest court, the High Court of Australia.\n\nIsrael and Australia have maintained diplomatic relations since the Australian government of Ben Chifley recognized Israel on January 28, 1949. The Liberal-Country Party Coalition supported Israel during and after the 1967 Six-Day War. This is manifest in the economic cooperation between the two countries in relation to “work-travel visas” for workers in each respective country.\n\nAustralia has a warm and close relationship with Israel, which is strongly supported by its active Jewish community. The relationship has a strong historical dimension, dating back to the First World War, when Australian forces fought in the Sinai-Palestine campaign alongside their Allied counterparts against the Ottomans, including the iconic charge of two Australian Light Horse regiments during the Battle of Beersheba on October 31, 1917, two days prior to the Balfour Declaration. Australia was the first country to vote in favor of the 1947 UN partition resolution, which ultimately led to the creation of Israel as a nation-state. Australia established diplomatic relations with Israel in 1949 and, in the same year, presided over the vote admitting Israel to the United Nations.\n\nAustralia is committed to a two-state solution in which Israel and a future Palestinian state coexist in peace and security within internationally recognized borders.\n\nAustralia is strongly opposed to the unfair targeting of Israel by the United Nations and other multilateral institutions. However, it makes clear its concerns about Israeli actions that undermine the prospects of a two-state solution and continues to urge Israel and other actors to respect international law.\n\nAustralia continues to broaden its bilateral cooperation with Israel. In recent years, there has been significantly increased engagement across a range of sectors, including innovation, security, and defense.\n\nSince 2017, Australia and Israel have expanded cooperation on national security, defense, and cyber security. Defense officials began annual strategic talks in 2018 and, in early 2019, Australia appointed a resident defense attaché to the Embassy in Tel Aviv. Leveraging Australia and Israel's respective areas of expertise, cooperation on national security continues to develop, including on aviation security, with Home Affairs as the lead Australian agency. In January 2019, following a series of reciprocal visits and dialogue, the two countries signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) on cyber security cooperation.\n\nAustralia’s bilateral economic relationship with Israel continues to grow. In 2021, Israel was Australia's 46th largest two-way trading partner and 54th largest export market. In 2021, two-way goods and services trade amounted to approximately $1.34 billion, of which Australian exports were worth $325 million and imports from Israel were worth $1.02 billion. In 2020, Australian investment in Israel totaled nearly $1.6 billion, and Israeli investment in Australia was $585 million, mostly centered in the innovation sector. Major merchandise exports to Israel include live animals, beef, plastic products, pearls, gems, and aluminum. As of November 2022, 19 Israeli companies were listed on the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX), making Israel the third-largest source of foreign company listings.\n\nSince the Israel-Hamas War:\n\nBipartisanship:\n\nA motion was moved by Australia’s Prime Minister in the House of Representatives on October 16, 2023, and seconded by the Leader of the Opposition. It read:\n\nThat the House—\n\n(1) unequivocally condemns the attacks on Israel by Hamas, which are the heinous acts of terrorists, and have encompassed the targeting and murder of civilians, including women and children, the taking of hostages, and indiscriminate rocket fire;\n\n(2) stands with Israel and recognises its inherent right to defend itself;\n\n(3) condemns antisemitism and recognises that generations of Jewish people have been subjected to this hateful prejudice;\n\n(4) calls for the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages;\n\n(5) recognises that Hamas does not represent the Palestinian people, nor their legitimate needs and aspirations;\n\n(6) acknowledges the devastating loss of Israeli and Palestinian life and that innocent civilians on all sides are suffering as a result of the attacks by Hamas and the subsequent conflict;\n\n(7) supports justice and freedom for Israelis and Palestinians alike;\n\n(8) supports international efforts to establish and maintain humanitarian access into Gaza, including safe passage for civilians;\n\n(9) reiterates Australia's consistent position in all contexts is to call for the protection of civilian lives and the observance of international law;\n\n(10) supports Australia's engagement with countries in the Middle East and beyond, at all levels, in support of the protection of civilians, and the containment of the conflict;\n\n(11) supports the Government's ongoing efforts to provide consular assistance to affected Australians and to facilitate the departure of those who want to leave the region;\n\n(12) acknowledges what has unfolded is deeply distressing for many in the Australian community, close to the heart of many, and it is important that we maintain respect for each other here at home as people express their views;\n\n(13) condemns all forms of hate speech and violent extremist activity, including Antisemitism and Islamophobia;\n\n(14) recognises an attack on any religion is an attack on all religions and that we all share a responsibility to unite, condemn and defeat such an attack on our common values and way of life;\n\n(15) notes that undermining social cohesion and unity by stoking fear and division risks Australia's domestic security; and\n\n(16) affirms in the strongest possible terms that hateful prejudice has no place in Australia.\n\nThe motion was passed by 110 votes to 4; the 4 against were the Greens MPs. The same motion was put forward and overwhelmingly supported in the Senate.\n\nOn the Houthis:\n\nAustralia condemned the Houthi interference with navigational rights and freedoms in the waters around the Arabian Peninsula, particularly the Red Sea. The numerous attacks originating from Houthi-controlled territories in Yemen, including the December 3 attacks against three commercial vessels in the Southern Red Sea connected to 14 nations, threaten international commerce and maritime security. The Houthi-led seizure of the Galaxy Leader on November 19 and the detention of its 25-member international crew, who remain unjustly detained, are appalling. Such behavior also threatens the movement of food, fuel, humanitarian assistance, and other essential commodities to destinations and populations all over the world. The undersigned further encourage all states to refrain from facilitation or encouragement of the Houthis. There is no justification for these attacks, which affect many countries beyond the flags these ships sail under. We again call on the Houthis to release the Galaxy Leader crew and ship immediately and to cease additional attacks on commercial vessels in the region's vital waterways.\n\nOn UNRWA:\n\nAs of March 15, 2024, Australia will lift its temporary pause on funding for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA), following steps to strengthen the integrity of UNRWA operations. The decision to pause an additional $6 million in funding was taken after serious allegations were made, resulting in UNRWA's dismissal of staff alleged to have been involved in the Hamas terrorist attacks of October 7. The nature of the allegations warranted an immediate and appropriate response. The Australian Government has been working with a group of donor countries and with UNRWA on the shared objective of ensuring the integrity of UNRWA's operations, rebuilding confidence, and ensuring aid flows to Gazans in desperate need.\n\nIsraeli Embassy\n\n6 Turrana Street\n\nYarralumla, Canberra, ACT 2600\n\nTelephone: +61 2 6215 4500\n\nFax: +61 2 6215 4555\n\nIsrael Trade Commission in Australia\n\nPO BOX 2626, Bondi Junction, 1355\n\nTelephone: +61 2 9388 0382"
