        "text": "Weekly Briefing, Vol. 67. No. 1 (HU) November 2023\n\nMigration policy in Hungary\n\nIn our previous briefings, we have repeatedly pointed out that the most important feature of Hungarian foreign policy is the preservation of the country’s sovereignty. The concept of sovereignty has many different interpretations and versions, but even in its most diluted and vague version, it implies the ability of the state to control the inflow and outflow of people on the territory of the given country. Without effective border control, a country’s sovereignty is indeed questionable or at least limited. Therefore, it is easy to understand why certain countries try to implement migration policies that allow for strict and clear control of their borders. Of course, the proper implementation of migration policy and its measures is not only about clear sovereignty issues, but it also has profound implications for broader social issues, such as how to preserve the country’s culture, traditions and traditional religions when we are faced with a significant influx of illegal immigrants from very diverse backgrounds. At this point, it should be noted that a clear distinction must be made between the coordination of policies and measures to repel illegal immigrants and well-designed, properly implemented steps to ensure a smooth influx of foreign labor (when the development of the economy so requires). While in the first case illegal immigrants want to stay in the country permanently, the stay of foreign workers is temporary and cannot be used for migration.\n\nProperly implemented migration policy measures can also have a beneficial effect on the development of the economy, the labor market and production in the manufacturing and service sectors. Efficient selection procedures for foreign workers can – as we can see in the case of Australia and Canada – contribute to higher value creation and movement in value chains. This aspect seems to be extremely important in the case of Hungary, as the extensive development of the economy has reached its limits and Hungary needs to move towards a knowledge-intensive economy as it continues its catching-up process.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe sharp difference between the Hungarian approach and the mainstream first became apparent when the migration crisis hit Europe in 2015. The mainstream was forged and led by the welcoming culture of the German Chancellor, best described by her phrase “Wir schaffen das” – in the original “We can do it”. The failure of this migration policy, which is partly based on origin and partly the result of collective guilt for the atrocities committed by Germans during the Second World War.\n\nThe failure of this migration policy only became apparent to the public a few years later, but analysts were aware of how futile these attempts would be. While the Germans’ optimistic – and naïve – approach was cast in a positive light by the liberal and left-leaning mainstream media in Europe, Hungary’s down-to-earth or pragmatic approach was heavily criticized from many quarters. Even if Hungary had not been right on this issue, we believe that migration management encroaches on core areas of sovereignty and it remains the competence of each country to decide on these matters.\n\nWe should add that the EU is not responsible for migration policy. It is not a common policy like agricultural, competition or trade policy, where countries pool their sovereignty at EU level and which is enshrined in the EU Treaty. What the European Commission has undertaken in recent years, on the other hand, has been “secret legislation”. By this term, we mean the process of discreetly or inconspicuously passing laws or regulations that often do not attract much public attention or scrutiny. This can include the introduction and passage of legislation with minimal public debate or attention. That is what happened in this case, as EU members never voted to make migration a common policy.\n\nChanging landscape\n\nIn contrast to the last decades of the twentieth century, recent migration trends can be characterized by two new phenomena. The scale of migration has changed, and in the last two decades the number of migrants has changed significantly. In 2022, the number of irregular border crossings amounted to 331 thousand, a significant increase of 66 percent compared to 2021. According to Eurostat, around a third of illegal migrants came from Syria and 10 percent from Afghanistan. Tunisia (7.6%), Egypt (6.6%) and Bangladesh are important countries of origin for illegal migrants.[1]\n\nThe other phenomenon we need to look at closely is that illegal migrants are highly supported by criminal groups, making this activity one of the fastest growing “business sectors”. At the same time, the likelihood of terrorist groups using the migration routes for their purposes is extremely high. To summarize, we have three reasons why increased border control contributes significantly to Hungary’s security:\n\nThe growing number of illegal immigrants does not serve Hungary’s economic interests. Regular immigration with clearly defined rules is better suited to filling the vacant jobs.\n\nThe possible involvement of terrorist groups poses a long-term threat that leads to growing security problems.\n\nThe influx of illegal immigrants could have a negative impact on the cohesion of Hungarian communities.\n\nWe should make it clear that illegal migration is different from migration, which is an influx of workers under organized conditions, and that it means a shorter period of stay for the workers, after which they normally return to their home country and do not settle.\n\nIt must be emphasized that Hungary, as a landlocked country, is very dependent on its neighboring countries for policing. The Migration Research Institute illustrates this connection with an example from Serbia. They pointed out that Serbia has granted visa-free travel to citizens from Burundi, Cuba, India, Tunisia and Iran until 2022 or 2023, which also has an impact on illegal border crossings to Hungary. This is because most migrants did not want to stay in Serbia, but wanted to enter the Schengen area, where Hungary is the closest entry point. After the European Commission concluded in a report that Serbia’s visa policy was contributing to the growing pressure on the Schengen area, Serbia suspended these agreements with the countries concerned. At this point, it should be noted that Serbia still has an agreement with Russia on visa-free travel and that, according to the Serbian Ministry of the Interior, around 220 thousand Russians entered Serbia last year.[2]\n\nMigration in Hungary – most recent dates and trends\n\nBy September 2023, 125 thousand illegal border crossings were prevented by the Hungarian border policy. It should be noted that this figure is significantly higher than that of 2021, when 122 thousand illegal migrants entered and were stopped at the border in the entire year. The difference in not only 3000 migrants but three month in which the number certainly will increase e further. The year of 2022 was a record in this aspect, since the number of illegal border crossings amounted to 271 thousand for the entire year. The Parliamentary State Secretary of the Ministry of the Interior describes the European Commission’s plans in this area this way: “The European Union wants to establish similar migrant camps in our country as well. (…) This means that the various needs and asylum procedures of 28.3% of all migrants arriving in Europe should be conducted here at the southern border, with the work of Hungarian police and officials, which is unacceptable to us.”[3]\n\nThe Hungarian Prime Minister tried to explain the public and the European audience why the Hungarian government is decisive on this issue. He said that the issue is not whether we will find migrants in Budapest in the next 20-30 years, but that if we let them in, we will not be able to send them back. And in that case, our children, grandchildren and many generations after that will live in a world “what will not be good, what will be uncertain, what will be filled with terrorist acts, crime, and mini ghettos like in Gaza.”[4] He also emphasized that we need a broad national united front on the issue of migration. He added that Western European countries were former colonizers and for this reason they already had migrants and the migration crisis of 2015 has only increased the already existing groups of migrants. The Prime Minister said that this trend is contributing to a permanent and irreversible change in society, as he put it: “And there, they see the end of their own country’s history. (…) There are countries where those living there today might think that when they die, the country will no longer be as it was when they were born . …”[5]\n\nWhy the Prime Minister is deeply concerned about this trend, can also be explained by the increasing brutality and tendency of migrants to behave violently towards the authorities (police and border guards), as well as the increasing organization of criminal groups specializing in supporting illegal migrants. They are not only more aggressive, but also use weapons and damage Hungarian border fences. According to the latest data from the Ministry of Interior, the damage to border fences amounted to around HUF 250 million in the first two quarters of the year. As evidence of the growing violence, the ministry said: “In the Hungarian-Serbian border section, border guards were attacked 18 times this year, police vehicles were attacked 119 times, and the security border fence and the technical equipment placed on it were targeted 39 times. In these attacks, 8 police officers were injured.”[6]\n\nThe Ministry of Interior also emphasized in its communication that human trafficking is not the choice of poor people who want to come to Europe, but the choice of those who want to live illegally in Europe. In this context, it is important to emphasize that the recent EU legislation on migration has met with clear rejection from the Hungarian side.\n\nEU level and country level changes in approach and legislation\n\nIt is worth taking a look at Germany’s stance on this issue, as its opinion on migration in the European Union is crucial and has changed in recent months. While Germany warmly welcomed refugees in 2015 under the leadership of Angela Merkel, today the German government has introduced temporary controls at the borders with Poland, the Czech Republic and Switzerland. It is currently seeking parliamentary approval of laws aimed at facilitating the deportation of rejected asylum seekers, increasing penalties for people smugglers, and allowing asylum seekers to work earlier to reduce dependence on state support. At the same time, Austria, Poland, and the Czech Republic have introduced temporary controls at their borders with Slovakia, which in turn has introduced controls at its border with Hungary. However, the change in Germany’s stance does not appear to be enough to achieve unanimity at EU level.[7]\n\nThe proposal of the European Commission was adopted by a majority vote and for this reason the opposition of Hungary and Poland was not sufficient to prevent the adoption of the proposed law. Two areas of the proposals are particularly noteworthy:\n\nA Member State facing a migration crisis may request the solidarity of other Member States, which may take the form of “relocation of asylum seekers or beneficiaries of international protection from the member state in a crisis situation to contributing member states; responsibility offsets, i.e. the supporting member state would take over the responsibility to examine asylum claims with a view to relief the member state that finds itself in a crisis situation; financial contributions or alternative solidarity measures.”[8]\n\nAt the same time, the proposal allows Member States to apply special procedural rules in a crisis situation.\n\nThe regulation, which deals with crisis situations and force majeure in the area of migration and asylum, is part of the New Pact on Migration and Asylum, which the Commission presented on September 23, 2020.[9]\n\nReactions in the media to Polish-Hungarian positions\n\nEuronews highlighted that this is not the first time Hungary and Poland have tried to derail a European Council communiqué, as they did in June and now in October. Euronews quoted Polish Prime Minister Morawiecki : “We are not afraid of diktats (…) from Berlin and Brussels … “[10] And the Hungarian Prime Minister: “There is no chance to have any kind of compromise and agreement on migration. Politically, it’s impossible. Not today, but generally speaking, for the next years. Because legally we are, how to say it, we are raped …” With this sentence he referred to the fact that rules will be forced on Hungary against the wil of the country and these new rule cut into the sovereignty of the country.\n\nIt is quite obvious that the fundamental difference between the Polish-Hungarian and the EU mainstream approach is how they interpret migration, whether it is a common policy where countries share power or a policy where countries can determine the measures. In summary, we can say that while there are common principles and objectives at EU level, specific aspects of migration policy, such as the admission of third-country nationals and integration measures, are often determined by individual member states.\n\nFox News quoted Orban’s X-post (formerly known Twitter): “We made a tolerance offer to Brussels: every country can deal with #migration the way they want to, but they cannot force #Hungary to copy the failed migration policies of Western Europe …”.\n\nIn light of the terrorist attacks in the Gaza Strip, the way in which the EU manages its migration policy has once again taken center stage. The Washington Post quoted the Hungarian Prime Minister and the author of the article assumed that there is no link between migration and terrorism and criticized the Hungarian Prime Minister for this idea. The article also added that Hungary is not alone in this opinion: “Politicians from Poland to Italy to Germany have stressed that the violence in Israel and Gaza necessitates an ever-greater focus on closed doors. Fear of besieged Palestinians escaping to Egypt seems to have added fresh momentum to a European Commission proposal to pay Egypt to keep migrants away from the E.U.”[11] Later the article also quoted the co-leader of the “Alternative für Deutschland”, the Italian Prime Minister Meloni, and the Greek Migration Minister, Kairidis arguing for better protection of EU borders.\n\nSummary\n\nIn our briefing, we were able to establish that Hungarian foreign policy is primarily characterized by a commitment to preserving the country’s sovereignty, especially when it comes to the control of inflow and outflow of people within its territory, in other words, the country relies on an efficient migration policy. This view is based on the belief and pragmatism that while migration policy deeply affects broader societal issues such as culture, traditions and economy, it basically also affects the core areas of a nation’s sovereignty. Furthermore, we can add that historical traumas of past centuries also contribute to this attitude towards migration.\n\nThe divergence between Hungary’s approach and the European mainstream became very clear during the 2015 migration crisis. Hungary’s pragmatic or down to earth approach was heavily criticized by other EU members and the European Commission, while the optimistic and welcoming culture propagated by Germany was later put to a vey harsh test when its limitations became apparent, as we could see in the analysis. With this clear change in policy Germany is trying to correct its failed migration policy in our opinion. Hungary emphasized several time the importance of retaining control over migration decisions as a matter of national sovereignty, highlighting that migration policy is not a common EU policy like agricultural, competition or trade policy where responsibilities are shared among EU members and EU institutions.\n\nRecent migration trends have also brought new challenges and new topics to the fore. For example, the number of illegal border crossings at Schengen borders has increased significantly due to factors such as the conflicts in Syria and Afghanistan. The briefing also showed that criminal groups play an important role in facilitating illegal migration, pose a real and long-term threat to security and potentially support terrorist activities. For this reason, Hungary is arguing for increased border control based on economic interests, security concerns and the potential impact on social cohesion.\n\nHungary’s own migration statistics point to a proactive border policy, despite proactivity it was a notable increase in prevented illegal border crossings measured this year. The Hungarian government, led by the Prime Minister, strongly opposes the European Commission’s plans to set up migrant camps in the country, stating that such ideas and proposals are unacceptable and would undermine the country’s national security and sovereignty.\n\nThe Hungarian Prime Minister also expressed his deep concern about the long-term consequences of uncontrolled migration and emphasized the need for a common political front to tackle the problem, a common front that all political parties could support. He also pointed out that, as former colonial powers, Western European countries already had an established migrant population before the 2015 crisis, contributing to a permanent and irreversible change in society which Hungary does not want to repeat.\n\nThe increasing violence and aggression of illegal migrants, including the damaging of border fences and attacks on law enforcement agencies, are also adding to Hungary’s security concerns. The rejection of recent EU legislation on migration underlines Hungary’s disagreement with the direction taken at EU level.\n\nOn the wider European stage, Germany’s approach has shifted from a welcoming stance of the migrants in 2015 to implementing temporary controls and legislative changes with the aim of managing migration more effectively. However, it remains difficult to achieve unanimity at EU level, with Hungary and Poland openly rejecting certain proposals to tackle the migration crisis.\n\nIn summary, Hungary’s migration policy is characterized by a commitment to sovereignty, with a focus on border control for economic, security and social cohesion reasons. The country’s stance is at odds with the EU’s mainstream approach and is a source of ongoing tension and disagreement within the European Union.\n\n[1] https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/priorities-2019-2024/promoting-our-european-way-life/statistics-migration-europe_en\n\n[2] https://migraciokutato.hu/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/20231009_HORIZONT_2023_14_tarik_parducz_dobo_az_embercsempesz_maffiak_okozta_kihivasok_a_nyugat_balkanon_es_magyarorszagon.pdf\n\n[3] https://hirado.hu/belfold/cikk/2023/09/19/a-migracios-hullam-tovabbra-sem-csitul-iden-125-ezer-bejutasi-kiserletet-hiusitottak-meg-a-deli-hataron\n\n[4] https://kormany.hu/hirek/a-migransokat-nem-szabad-beengedni\n\n[5] https://kormany.hu/hirek/a-migransokat-nem-szabad-beengedni\n\n[6] https://kormany.hu/hirek/sajtotajekoztato-a-migracio-aktualis-helyzeterol\n\n[7] https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/eu-looks-future-summit-migration-enlargement-2023-10-06/\n\n[8] https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2023/10/04/migration-policy-council-agrees-mandate-on-eu-law-dealing-with-crisis-situations/\n\n[9] The five main pieces of the Pact are: the Screening Regulation; The amended Eurodac Regulation; the amended Asylum Procedures Regulation (APR); the Asylum and Migration Management Regulation (AMMR) and the Crisis and Force Majeure Regulation.\n\n[10] https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2023/10/06/hungary-and-poland-block-again-an-eu-joint-declaration-on-migration"
