        "text": "Nominees must be individuals who have settled in Australia as a refugee.\n\nPlease note: Current employees of SBS and UNHCR and their immediate families are ineligible to apply for the Les Murray Award.\n\nThe Award will be judged by a selection committee. The committee is looking for a refugee living in Australia who has made a significant contribution to the community and who has raised positive awareness about the situation of refugees.\n\nIn 2023, the selection committee consists of: Adrian Edwards, David Hua, Kate Dundas and Ann Odong.\n\nThe Award commemorates Les Murray AM, a much-loved icon of Australian sport and a passionate supporter of refugees and human rights.\n\nLes Murray was an iconic Australian sports broadcaster and a former refugee who embarked on a lifelong mission to unite people through football. Les drew on his own experience of fleeing Hungary in 1956 to reach eventual safety in Australia in his advocacy. His personal account offered Australians a positive view of the refugee journey and experience.\n\nThe Award is supported by Les’ daughters Tania and Natalie Murray.\n\nLes Murray AM (László Ürge) arrived in Australia aged 11 from Hungary as a refugee.\n\nLes became the voice and face of football on SBS. He hosted On The Ball, Toyota World Sports and The World Game; covered eight World Cup events; and established himself as Australia’s 'Mr Football'. To Les, football was the 'World Game', the 'Beautiful Game' and the 'Greatest Show on Earth' – and he understood the power of sport as a pathway for refugees to succeed in Australia.\n\nAs Les explained: \"Refugees, perhaps more than other immigrants, are more likely to make a positive contribution to their new country, driven by a need to give something in return for being given a chance to start again after a terrible experience.\"\n\nIn 2006, Les was made a Member of the Order of Australia for services to football and was also awarded the Australian Sports Commission's Lifetime Achievement Award for Contribution to Sports Journalism.\n\nAustralians learned more about Les in 2011 through Les Murray’s Mission – a SBS Dateline documentary on his return to Hungary to find those who helped his family escape Soviet occupation in 1956.\n\nHis personal account offered Australians a positive view of the refugee journey and experience."
