        "text": "Serbia's prime minister has said he is \"shocked\" by Hungary's plan to erect a border fence to keep out migrants.\n\nAleksandar Vucic said the four-metre (13ft) fence was \"not the solution\" to migrants entering Hungary from Serbia.\n\nHungarian authorities announced the plan on Wednesday, saying the wall would run the length of the 175km (109-mile) border between the countries.\n\nForeign Minister Peter Szijjarto said Hungary could not wait for the EU to find a solution to immigration.\n\nSpeaking on TV during a visit to Oslo, Mr Vucic said: \"I am surprised and shocked. We will discuss this decision with our Hungarian colleagues.\n\n\"Building walls is not the solution. Serbia can't be responsible for the situation created by the migrants, we are just a transit country. Is Serbia responsible for the crisis in Syria?\"\n\nMr Vucic said he intended to discuss the move with Serbia's partners in the EU.\n\nThere was also criticism from the Council of Europe's Human Rights Commissioner Nils Muiznieks, who described the planned fence as \"ill-advised., external\"\n\nThere has been a sharp rise in the number of migrants and asylum seekers entering Hungary in 2015.\n\nThe government said about 54,000 migrants entered the country so far this year, compared to 43,000 people in 2014."
