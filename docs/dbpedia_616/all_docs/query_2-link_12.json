        "text": "Introduction\n\nOver more than two centuries, millions of people have migrated to Australia from countries across the world. Waves of immigration have shaped—and reshaped—the identity of the Australian nation. The reasons for immigration to Australia have varied over time and among different groups. Many migrants have been drawn to the country in the hope of securing a better life, seeking economic opportunity or relief from conflict in their homelands. Other people have come to Australia in forced, or involuntary, migrations—for example, the convicts sent to the colony as punishment in the early years of settlement or many of the South Sea Islanders brought in as laborers in the late 1800s. Regardless of how they arrived, all immigrant groups have contributed significantly to the country’s development. They have helped build the economy and have transformed Australia from a predominantly British country into one of the most multicultural societies in the world.\n\nIt must be remembered that the first migrants to Australia were the Aboriginal peoples. Although they are Indigenous Australians, they too came to the continent from somewhere else—their ancestors arrived from Asia more than 50,000 years ago. Australia’s other Indigenous cultural group—the Torres Strait Islander peoples—lived on the Torres Strait Islands when they came under the control of Queensland in the 1870s. The migration of Europeans to the continent proved very disruptive to Indigenous Australians, forever changing the way of life they had practiced for tens of thousands of years.\n\nFrom the First Fleet Through the 1800s\n\nFrom the first settlement until the 20th century, migration to Australia was dominated by Europeans. The migrants came mostly from the United Kingdom, which at the time included Ireland. The British colonial government strongly encouraged immigration in the 1800s, believing that Australia’s small population had to grow to ensure the economic development and security of the colonies. At the same time, the government sought to preserve Australia’s British heritage with programs that favored immigration from the British Isles. Nevertheless, immigration began to diversify in the 1850s with the discovery of gold, which attracted migrants from China, the United States, and other countries. Later in the 19th century Australia received migrants from Central and South Asia, Japan, and the South Pacific islands. These people came—some voluntarily, others involuntarily—to work in the colonies’ growing industries. The sections below discuss these key sources of migrants to Australia during the 1800s.\n\nThe United Kingdom\n\nThe first Europeans to migrate to Australia were the British settlers who arrived on the First Fleet in 1788. To relieve overcrowding in Britain’s prisons, the government sent the expedition to establish a penal colony on the remote continent. Over the next 80 years the British shipped more than 160,000 convicts to Australia. This system of punishment, called transportation, was an example of forced migration in that the convicts did not freely choose to go to Australia. Most of the convicts were English, though there were also thousands of Irish.\n\nFree settlers—people who willingly migrated to Australia—began arriving in 1793. For decades they were outnumbered by the convict population. The number of free settlers rapidly increased beginning in the 1830s as the British government introduced programs to encourage migration to Australia. The government paid some or all of the cost of travel to Australia and assisted new migrants in setting up farms or businesses. With high unemployment in Britain at the time, many people saw migration to Australia as a chance for a better life.\n\nThe majority of the free settlers from the British Isles came from England, but tens of thousands came from Ireland as well. Large numbers of Irish people came to Australia to flee the Potato Famine. This event, also known as the Great Irish Famine, occurred when a plant disease caused the Irish potato crop to fail each year from 1845 to 1849. At the time almost half the Irish population depended almost exclusively on the potato for their diet. The crop failures caused about a million people to die from starvation or famine-related diseases. As many as two million Irish emigrated during the famine; most went to the United States, but many thousands went to Australia. The number of Ireland-born Australians continued to increase until 1891, when it peaked at more than 228,000.\n\nMany of the migrants who came to Australia from Scotland were victims of the Highland Clearances—a series of forced evictions from the mid-1700s to the mid-1800s. To allow for the introduction of sheep farming, landowners forced thousands of families from their homes in the Highlands and western islands of Scotland. The removals peaked in the 1840s with the collapse of the Highland economy and the failure of the Highland potato crop, which, as in Ireland, led to famine and disease. This devastation brought about mass migrations of Scots to countries across the world, with Australia as a leading destination.\n\nDiscoveries of gold in New South Wales and Victoria in 1851 had an immense effect on migration to Australia. Between 1851 and 1860 more than 600,000 immigrants came to Australia, tripling its population. More than four-fifths of the newcomers were from the United Kingdom, mostly from England. The number of Australians born in the United Kingdom reached its height at about 825,000 in 1891.\n\nChina\n\nA few thousand Chinese arrived in Australia as indentured workers in the 1840s. They were brought in to bolster the labor force as the number of convict workers was dwindling. Chinese immigration rapidly increased following the gold discoveries of the 1850s. By 1861 more than 38,000 Chinese lived in Australia, making up more than 3 percent of the population. The Chinese miners were generally skilled and diligent workers, but their presence stirred racial prejudice among white Australians. Violent anti-Chinese riots broke out in Victoria and New South Wales, and colonial governments passed laws to restrict immigration from China. Eventually, most of the early Chinese immigrants returned to China.\n\nAfter the gold rushes, many of the Chinese who remained in Australia became farmers, growing vegetables to sell at markets in cities and towns. Others ran small businesses in the cities or worked as traders, importing and exporting goods between Australia and Asia.\n\nGermany\n\nGerman immigrants played a significant role in the early European settlement of Australia, particularly South Australia. One of the main reasons for early German immigration was religious persecution at home. The king of Prussia, Frederick William III, was trying to unify the Lutheran and Reformed churches in his kingdom and introduced a new church service. Some Lutheran pastors and parishioners who objected to the new form of worship were imprisoned. In 1834 Lutheran pastor August Kavel began making arrangements for his congregation to escape this persecution by traveling to the new colony of South Australia. This group of more than 500 Lutherans arrived at Port Adelaide in 1838.\n\nMany of the early German settlers were farmers or tradespeople such as blacksmiths or carpenters. They found success in wine production, and they are recognized as the founders of the famed South Australian wine industry. In the 1850s large numbers of German migrants made their way to Victoria to seek their fortunes on the goldfields. By 1861 there were an estimated 10,000 Germans in Victoria.\n\nUnited States\n\nWhen news of the discovery of gold in Australia spread around the world, a few thousand adventurers made the long journey from the United States to try their luck on the goldfields. The Victorian gold rush in particular attracted many miners from the United States in the 1850s. The American settlers made valuable contributions to Victoria’s early rural industries and the development of its rail and tram systems. It was two Americans, Freeman Cobb and George Mowton, who in the 1850s established the stagecoach company Cobb and Co. Its coaches became an important means of transportation in the Australian colonies, particularly for traveling to the goldfields.\n\nCentral and South Asia\n\nIn the mid-1800s, with expeditions to inland Australia at their peak, explorers and settlers found that horses and wagons were no longer a suitable form of transportation. As a solution, camels were introduced for crossing the hot, dry terrain. It was also necessary to recruit cameleers—people who were skilled in handling the animals.\n\nThe first cameleers came to Australia in 1860. Their numbers grew in the following decades as new routes were established through the Outback. Between 1870 and 1900 about 2,000 cameleers and 15,000 camels came to Australia. Although the cameleers were collectively known as “Afghans,” only some of them came from Afghanistan. Others were from British India (modern Pakistan and India), Persia (now Iran), or other parts of Central and South Asia. The camels, known as the “ships of the desert,” carried supplies to remote settlements. In the 1870s the transport of materials by the cameleers was key to the construction of the Overland Telegraph, a line that connected Darwin with Adelaide. They also played an important role in the completion of the Trans-Australian Railway, which provided a rail link between the eastern states and Western Australia in the early 1900s.\n\nSouth Sea Islands\n\nBetween 1863 and 1904 approximately 62,000 South Sea Islander people were transported to Australia as a cheap source of labor for the production of cotton and sugar. They came from dozens of islands in the South Pacific Ocean, predominantly those of Vanuatu (then called the New Hebrides) and the Solomon Islands. At the time the South Sea Islander workers were known as Kanakas, but this is now considered an offensive term. Some of the Islanders migrated to Australia by choice, though in many cases “recruiters” tricked them into making the trip. Other Islanders were forced from their homes and taken to Australia against their will. The practice of deceiving or kidnapping South Sea Islanders into forced labor was called blackbirding.\n\nSouth Sea Islanders began to arrive in Australia on a large scale in the 1860s. At the time, the U.S. cotton industry was in upheaval because of the American Civil War, causing a worldwide cotton shortage. Entrepreneurs in Queensland saw an opportunity to meet the demand. To develop the colony’s cotton industry, they needed cheap labor on a large scale. Cotton growers began importing Islanders to work on their plantations, using false promises or force to get them on their ships. Soon most of the imported workers were employed on sugar plantations. The Islanders experienced appalling treatment, and thousands lost their lives on the plantations. Blackbirding declined only in the 1890s as new technology reduced the need for farm laborers.\n\nJapan\n\nSmall numbers of Japanese began to emigrate to Australia in the late 1800s. They were attracted by the thriving pearling industry of the north. With the introduction of diving suits in the 1880s, pearling companies recruited skilled Japanese divers to replace the Indigenous Australian workers they had previously used. By the early 1900s the Japanese-born population of Australia was about 3,500.\n\nImmigration in the 20th and 21st Centuries\n\nThe arrival of thousands of Chinese in Australia during the 1850s gold rushes, followed by the recruitment of South Sea Islanders to work on Queensland plantations in the late 1800s, sparked fears of labor competition among Australians of European descent. In the 1890s the desire for a coordinated immigration ban against nonwhites was one factor that encouraged the Australian colonies to form a federation. Therefore, shortly after the Commonwealth of Australia was created in 1901, the new federal Parliament introduced the Immigration Restriction Act. It required everyone who wished to settle in Australia to pass a dictation test that was administered in English or another European language. Directed mainly at Asians, the law effectively stopped all non-European immigration into the country. The law was the cornerstone of what became known as the White Australia Policy.\n\nThe Immigration Restriction Act would remain in effect for more than 50 years. It served the goal of keeping Australia’s population almost entirely white. From 1901 until the start of World War I in 1914, almost all immigrants were English, Irish, or Scottish. During the war immigration stopped almost entirely, but it picked up again in the 1920s, when more than 340,000 immigrants arrived. Their numbers were boosted by British government programs that provided financial assistance to many migrants. Although the newcomers were still mostly of British descent, they also included growing numbers from Greece, Italy, and Yugoslavia. Immigration slowed during the Great Depression of the 1930s and almost froze during World War II (1939–45).\n\nPostwar Policy: “Populate or Perish”\n\nThe end of World War II brought significant changes to Australia’s immigration policy. The spread of communism in many parts of the world and the threat of Japanese invasion instilled fear and heightened the need for a larger defense force in Australia. The country also had a severe labor shortage that hindered its efforts to expand the economy. These circumstances led the federal government to introduce a large-scale immigration program to boost the population. In 1945 the government established the Department of Immigration, and the first minister for immigration, Arthur Calwell, urged Australia to “populate or perish.” The government set a goal of 2 percent population growth each year, with half of the growth coming from immigration.\n\nEven under the new program, the government still wanted most of the immigrants to come from Britain. It encouraged British immigration through several assisted-migration programs in the 1940s and ’50s, including the “Bring out a Briton” campaign launched in 1957. However, owing to improved economic conditions in Britain, these programs failed to achieve the planned quotas. The government soon realized the need to expand its immigration efforts.\n\nCalwell first looked to European countries that had suffered upheavals during and in the aftermath of World War II. Millions of people had been forced from their homes by the war, and many of them lived in displaced persons camps. Among the refugees were great numbers of eastern Europeans—from Poland, Yugoslavia, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Ukraine, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, and other places—who had fled when the Soviet Union invaded their countries. In 1947 the Australian government negotiated an agreement with the International Refugee Organisation to resettle at least 12,000 people a year from the camps. By 1954 more than 170,000 European refugees had migrated to Australia under this program. In exchange for their free passage and resettlement in Australia, the migrants had to commit to work for the government for two years. These refugees, even those with skills, were typically assigned to manual labor, such as constructing railways and roads, working in mines, or harvesting sugarcane.\n\nA second wave of immigration in the 1950s and ’60s consisted of people seeking work and a better way of life. The Australian government negotiated immigration agreements with numerous countries, including the Netherlands and Italy in 1951; Austria, Belgium, West Germany, Greece, and Spain in 1952; and Switzerland, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland, and the United States in 1954. The agreements provided eligible migrants with almost free passage to Australia in return for two years of labor. A large number of migrants arrived from southern Europe from the mid-1950s to the mid-’60s. Most of these migrants were young single men who were recruited to provide much-needed labor for manufacturing and large-scale public works. The massive hydroelectric project called the Snowy Mountains Scheme, launched in 1949, employed more than 100,000 migrants from more than 30 countries.\n\nThe postwar immigration boom contributed to major changes in Australia’s economy and society. The work of migrants was key to the country’s rapid economic growth. As manufacturing peaked in the 1950s and ’60s it relied heavily on immigrant labor, with one-third of the workforce born overseas. The influx of immigrants in the postwar years also began to shift Australia’s culture away from the domination of British influence. By 1961 about 10 percent of the population came from places other than the British Isles, up from just 3 percent in 1947. Italians were the largest non-British group, followed by Germans, Dutch, Greeks, and Poles.\n\nImmigration after the White Australia Policy\n\nIn the 1950s the Australian government began to relax its White Australia Policy. Among the first changes was to allow non-European migrants the opportunity to apply for citizenship. This was followed by the abolition of the dictation test under the Migration Act of 1958, which replaced the Immigration Restriction Act of 1901. The Migration Act of 1966, introduced by the Liberal government of Prime Minister Harold Holt, relaxed the White Australia Policy by allowing non-Europeans with certain professional and academic qualifications to apply for entry.\n\nThe White Australia Policy was soon officially abandoned. In 1973 the new Labor government led by Prime Minister Gough Whitlam implemented the Universal Migration Policy. This radical change allowed people from any country to apply to migrate to Australia regardless of race, ethnicity, nationality, gender, or religion. It heralded the beginning of a culturally diverse Australian society. From then on, all potential migrants would be evaluated only on their skills and their ability to contribute to the Australian economy.\n\nAssisted-migration programs ended in 1975, resulting in a dramatic decline in the number of British and European immigrants. Many of the new migrants came from countries closer to Australia, especially in Asia. The Australian government had signed a United Nations agreement to provide resettlement for people fleeing hardship and persecution in other countries. Under this agreement, many refugees came to Australia from Southeast Asia after the end of the Vietnam War. The first of these refugees arrived from Vietnam by boat in 1976. Others came from Cambodia and Laos. By 1985 more than 70,000 refugees from Southeast Asia had arrived in Australia, mostly from Vietnam. The number of migrants from Asia continued to increase into the 21st century, though the leading countries of origin shifted. The numbers of migrants from China and India grew dramatically in the 2000s and 2010s, making these countries the third and fourth largest contributors to Australia’s foreign-born population (trailing only the United Kingdom and New Zealand).\n\nAustralia has also accepted refugees from other regions in times of crisis. Waves of immigrants came from eastern Europe after the Soviet Union put down uprisings in Hungary in 1956 and Czechoslovakia in 1968. A flood of refugees arrived in Australia from the Balkans after the violent breakup of Yugoslavia in the 1990s. Other refugees have come to Australia fleeing civil wars or persecution in the Middle East, Africa, and South and Central America.\n\nPostwar immigration provided an economic boost and achieved its intended purpose by significantly increasing Australia’s population. The population grew from about 7.4 million in 1945 to nearly 13 million in 1970, with immigration accounting for three-fifths of the increase. The 2016 census counted more than 23 million Australians, more than a quarter of them having been born overseas. Not all Australians are happy with these ongoing changes, and some new migrants continue to suffer hostility and discrimination. On the whole, however, Australia is a tolerant country that appreciates the benefits of a multicultural society and the diversity offered by migrants from nearly 200 different countries."
