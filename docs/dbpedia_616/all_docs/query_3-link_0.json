        "text": "Read Kathy Varkonyi Hood’s heartfelt story of her family’s arrival in Australia from Hungary, their struggles, and the transformative support they received from The Joint Australia.\n\nIn this inspiring blog post, we share the remarkable journey of Kathy Varkonyi Hood and her family, who arrived in Australia from Budapest, Hungary, in 1958. Facing immense challenges and starting with almost nothing, they found hope and assistance through The Joint Australia. Join us as we delve into their story of resilience, gratitude, and the lasting impact of The Joint’s support.\n\nA Brave Move Born Out of Desperation\n\nIn September 1958, Kathy’s parents embarked on a courageous journey to Australia, leaving behind their home in Hungary. Armed with only £50 and their determination, the family arrived in Sydney after a long and arduous journey, seeking a new beginning in a foreign land.\n\nHumble Beginnings and Unforeseen Challenges\n\nSettling into a share boarding house with distant relatives they had never met before, Kathy’s family faced difficult living conditions. Sharing limited resources with strangers, they navigated the challenges of cramped spaces, limited food, and unfamiliar surroundings. Their resilience kept them going, but their circumstances remained daunting.\n\nFinding Light in the Darkness\n\nAmidst the struggles, a concerned Jewish friend suggested that Kathy’s family reach out to The Joint for assistance. This pivotal moment turned their lives around. Though Kathy was only 10 years old at the time, she vividly recalls her parents’ immense gratitude and admiration for The Joint. With their help, her family received much-needed support, including financial assistance and clothing, which brought a glimmer of hope to their desperate situation.\n\nA Lifelong Gratitude and Giving Back\n\nThe impact of The Joint’s assistance on Kathy’s family was immeasurable. It provided them with a lifeline when they had almost lost hope. Their deep appreciation for The Joint continued throughout their lives. Even after her parents passed away, Kathy never forgot the kindness they had received. Today, she honors their memory by making donations to The Joint whenever possible, acknowledging the organisation’s role in shaping their lives.\n\nA Testament to Resilience and Success\n\nKathy’s parents, despite starting as cleaners and factory workers, worked tirelessly to build a better future for their family. They eventually climbed the professional ladder, with her father retiring as a Director at the University of NSW and her mother retiring from a managerial role at the Mater Hospital. Their journey serves as a testament to the indomitable spirit of immigrants and the opportunities made possible through resilience and support.\n\nKathy Varkonyi Hood’s story is a testament to the transformative power of compassion and assistance. The Joint Australia’s support enabled her family to overcome tremendous challenges and build a successful life in a new country. Through her words, we are reminded of the profound impact that organisations like The Joint have on individuals and families, leaving a legacy of gratitude and a commitment to giving back.\n\nHungarian Jewish immigration to Australia\n\nIn most cases, the Australian Hungarian community’s origins can be traced to four distinct refugee-migrant waves, each resulting from political and social upheavals in Hungary. The USA and Canada were always the first-choice destinations, with Argentina in third place, and, by comparison, only a trickle came to Australia according to pre-WWI public records.\n\nThe first wave of Hungarian arrivals in Australia followed the 1848-1849 Hungarian war of independence against the Austrian Empire. The loss of that war and the impact of continued repression by the Austrian rulers resulted in the arrival of political refugees seeking freedom and opportunities in a promising new country—the colonies of Australia.\n\nThe Hungarian community has been present in Australia since colonial times. During the pre-WWI period, there were few Hungarians who selected Australia as their destination. Many were Hungarian officers and ex-soldiers who were attracted to Victoria’s goldfields. The collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire after WWI saw a steady flow of Hungarian migrants, but this period was minor compared to the later ones.\n\nA devastating depression in rural Hungary in the 1890s and early 1900s saw over 1.5 million Hungarians emigrate. While the overwhelming majority went to the United States, several hundred came to Australia.\n\nThe collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire after World War I (1918) and the Treaty of Versailles-Trianon (1920) reduced the size of Hungary by 72 percent. This left some 6.6 million ethnic Hungarians living in countries like Austria, Czechoslovakia, Ukraine (USSR), Romania, and the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes.\n\nDiscrimination after 1920 against sizable Hungarian minorities in most countries adjoining Hungary brought a steady migration to Australia. Hungarians sought to free themselves from the injustice and lack of opportunity they faced at home. This movement was not a ‘wave’ but rather a steady stream of Hungarian migration by professionals and their families sponsored from within Australia. The second period of Hungarian migration was also minor compared to the later ones.\n\nUntil the outbreak of World War II, Australia offered a safe haven and accepted around 6,475 new settlers, mainly Central European Jews fleeing Nazi Germany’s discrimination and persecution. The number of Hungarian-Jewish arrivals in Australia during this period is estimated to have been about 800 persons.\n\nThe third wave of Hungarian immigration was directly attributable to World War II and its consequences. The war caused immense devastation, economic collapse, and impoverishment in Europe. Totalitarian communist regimes came to power in Central and Eastern Europe, including Hungary under Soviet rule.\n\nThe fourth wave of Hungarian migration began after November 1956, following the suppression of the Hungarian Revolution against communist tyranny and Soviet hegemony. This wave consisted of tradesmen, university students, factory workers, senior apprentices, and professionals, among others.\n\nThe Hungary-born community in Victoria peaked at 10,654 by 1961. Many Hungarian immigrants in the next two decades came from the Vojvodina province of Yugoslavia, which had been part of the Kingdom of Hungary until the Treaty of Trianon in 1920. The Hungary-born community in Victoria has slowly decreased since the 1960s, with 4,979 people recorded in 2016. The Hungarian community in Australia maintains Hungarian customs and traditions through various organizations and passes down the Hungarian language to younger generations. Hungarian migrants have made significant contributions to various aspects of Australian life, including science and the arts."
