        "text": "The ‘Austrian Club Geelong’ was founded in 1972. Toni Baart, Rudi Hochreiter and Rudi Janda were the driving force behind inauguration, inviting all the Austrians in the Geelong area to the inaugural meeting. Subsequently an enthusiastic and optimistic group of Austrians elected the first management committee with Rudi Hochreiter the first President.\n\nIn the early years, all club functions and activities were held in rented premises. The first club rooms were established in 1974 at 99 Little Malop Street in the city. Five years later these were improved and enlarged. As the club grew, the desire to own a club house also increased.\n\nThen in 1986 the members decided to lease land from the ‘Shire of Corio’ for the purpose of building a club house built. In 1988 the club house was completed and a liquor license was obtained one year later.\n\nThe Austrian Club of Geelong now has 280 members and is proud to be able to hold all club functions in their own premises. It is to the credit of the Austrians of the Geelong region, who have, through their hard work, commitment, enthusiasm and generous contributions, made it all possible.\n\nETHNIC RADIO: Augustin Devatti and Ida Zambelli-Hell 3ZZZ 92.3FM (Melbourne)\n\nFind out more:\n\nContact: Augustin Devatti [email protected]\n\nCommunity Hall: 240 Plantation Rd, Corio\n\nBantu collective incorporated is a newly established organisation that compromises of members from different African countries a which include Zimbabwe, Kenya, Uganda, South Africa, Nigeria , Malawi , Botswana and Zambia.\n\nBantu tribes belong or relate to a group of peoples in central to southern Africa. The languages spoken include Swahili, Xhosa, and Zulu. It is one of the the largest tribes in Africa.\n\nUbuntu is an ancient African word meaning ‘humanity to others’. It is often described as reminding us that ‘I am what I am because of who we all are’. We bring the spirit of Ubuntu to Geelong\n\nOur organisation was formed in 2021, an aftermath of Covid-19 pandemic. We were looking for meaningful ways that our community could engage with each other & the wider Geelong community.\n\nBy creating opportunities and social platforms in Victoria for our community participation and engagement through celebrating Africa and its cultural diversity.\n\nOur event, Bantu Fest provides the Geelong community and visitors a unique cultural celebration experience and help to build social cohesion. It aims to boost cultural pride, social engagement, communication, awareness of our culture, and knowledge for the Geelong community.\n\nIt is a family friendly event. That gives us the opportunity to showcase the positive aspects of our community while breaking down social disconnection\n\nWe hope it supports our community’s cultural identity across generations. And increase our\n\ncapacity to enhance the lives of marginalized or isolated people in our community by trying to make Geelong their new home.\n\nThe Chinese Association of Geelong started from 1996, it has been operating for over 27 years and currently has over 2000 members.\n\nThe early history of Chinese Australians involved significant immigration during mid-19th century due to the gold rush. Since the advent of Multiculturalism as a government policy in the 1970’s, many Chinese from Hong Kong, Mainland China, Taiwan and Southeast Asia (Malaysia, Vietnam, Cambodia, Indonesia and the Philippines) have immigrated to Australia.\n\nAfter the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, the Australian Prime Minister of the day, Bob Hawke, allowed students from mainland China to settle in Australia permanently.
