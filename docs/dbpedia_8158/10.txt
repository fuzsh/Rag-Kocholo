In the early 1900s Swedish painter Isaac Grünewald (1889-1946) both fascinated and outraged people in Sweden and Denmark with his vividly coloured modern paintings, flamboyant lifestyle, and staunch belief in a new style of decorative, expressive painting.

The exhibition is a solo presentation of Grünewald’s works, reflecting the colourful, expressionistic qualities of his mentor Matisse, but also charting his discovery of a direction of his own as a Scandinavian modernist. Isaac Grünewald was one of a kind, and his oeuvre points to a new, Nordic style of decorative expressionism and the independent movement it became.

Grünewald’s works are presented in a dramatically staged exhibition surrounded by the colours of the artist’s rich palette.

The exhibition is a collaboration with Waldemarsudde.

All our exhibitions are accompanied by a programme of inspiring events, exploring and bringing a contemporary perspective to their themes and ideas.
