        "text": "This article aims to explore the challenges the art produced for and under the national socialist regime between 1933 and 1945 poses for the field of art history in Germany. It does so by outlining recent developments in the research on this topic and on the presentation of those artworks in German museums. These developments will be contextualized by a discussion of “Degenerate Art” as a political rather than an aesthetic phenomenon and the construction of the binary opposition of “Degenerate Art” and national socialist art in the history of the field of German art history. Currently a shift in the discipline is taking place, employing a cultural historical approach to deal with the art and art politics of National Socialism which leads to more differentiated research that even enters the institution of the art museum.\n\nCompared to his contemporary Dürer, Mathis Gothart, called Grünewald, remains a remarkably elusive figure. To this day, neither his birthdate (c.1470/80?) nor his birthplace (Würzburg?) have been ascertained, and with contemporary documents amounting to little more than a handful of monograms and the inventory drawn up on his death in 1528, Grünewald’s works have always played a key role in constructing his biography. From a very early stage, this narrative was conveyed by others: while many of Grünewald’s drawings carry inscriptions, such as place references, the vast majority of these were added by successive owners. Knowledge of the master’s oeuvre remained particularly strong in the Rhine-Main region in the century after his death, yet on a biographical level, oral traditions had only transmitted the vague name “Mathis of Aschaffenburg” and his employment as court painter to the elector of Mainz. It was admiration of his artistic brilliance and – ironically - the clue that Grünewald had contributed wings to Dürer’s Heller altarpiece that prompted a search for the historical figure behind the works in Frankfurt city records in the 1630s. This search eventually led to the creation of “Grünewald”, the false name and identity published in the first biography of the artist in Sandrart’s Teutsche Academie (Nuremberg 1675-80). This paper will hence outline a diverging relationship between artist and work to that suggested for Dürer: one in which the work is not a reflection of, but a clue to biography, be it through stylistic interpretation of the object itself, or through its contextualisation through related documents.\n\nThe article sets out to investigate the fundamental problem for the methodology of postwar German art history, namely, the unavoidable fusion of two markedly different perspectives, i.e., those of East and West Germany, into a coherent narrative. The reconstruction of key exhibitions and controversies sparked by East German art, in 1989 and beyond, suggests that the revision of the canon of art history may be faced with greater challenges whenever adopting the perspective of the close Other (political or ideological), rather than that of a remote Other (ethnic or cultural). The incorporation of the close Other into a uniform narrative on art history can be a moot point, most notably in those cases where the western concept of art calls for a necessary restatement, and one's identity needs to be critically redefined in the process. This is best exemplified by what happened in Germany after 1989."
