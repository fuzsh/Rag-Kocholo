        "text": "A program for the Autumn tours has been sent. Please let me know if you didn’t receive it. The first tour takes place on Tuesday October 3rd at 10am and is a walk from The Garden Museum to Battersea Power Station. Hope to see you on one of my tours!\n\nI must be on a lucky streak…. Rian, the gem of a museum in Falkenberg on the Swedish west coast now also stocks my book Wild Strawberries (p.1). Rian means grain dryer (p.3) and is a small design museum located in the old town near the river Ätran, housed in a former granary (p.2) where damp oat was stored, dried and exported to the UK in return for coal. Rian is presently hosting an excellent exhibition called “The Magic of Clay - 100 years of Scandinavian Ceramics” featuring famous ceramicists such as Wilhelm Kåge, Stig Lindberg, Vicke Lindstrand and Lisa Larson (p.4-6). The BIM Collection as it’s called is a donation from a private collector. Falkenberg is not only a hip place for “foodies” but now also for design lovers. Rian’s neighbourhood is charming and includes Hamngatan 27, a nearby, family run hotel in a former warehouse (p.7-8). #rian #leransmagi #bimcollection #wilhelmkåge #stiglindberg #vickelindstrand #lisalarson #hamngatan27 #falkenberg #designmuseum #wildstrawberries #ceramics #scandinavianceramics\n\nI must be on a lucky streak….

Henri Matisse was specifically asked by a Swedish artist to create an academy for about 40 Nordic artists living in Paris. (Apparently he got bored with teaching after a while). Among the students inspired by his Fauvist style were the Swedish artists Isaac Grünewald and Sigurd Hjertén (p.1). Another internationally recognised Swedish artist called Gösta Adrian-Nilsson (GAN) was initially working in Berlin and was exhibited in the iconic Der Sturm gallery (p.2). After WWI he moved to Paris and became the link between Fernand Léger and the Nordic artist community. Many of these artists attended Léger’s academy in Montparnasse. Léger’s idea that art should be for “all people” not an elite and his fascination with the machine appealed to many of his Nordic students including Otto G. Carlsund, whose contribution to the Stockholm 1930 Expo was the mural Rapide (p.3) for the exhibition restaurant Little Paris. These paintings from the Tangen Collection will be part of a new gallery in a grain silo in Kristiansand, Norway opening in 2024. Must go and visit! #tangencollection #tangen #artipelag #isaacgrunewald #sigridhjertén #gostaadriannilsson #ottogcarlsund #stockholmexpo #fernandleger #henrimatisse #leger #matisse #fauvism #machineage #dersturm\n\nWhenever I do a reconnaissance for my Battersea/Nine Elms walk I discover something new. This time the amazing newly opened roof top bar of Spanish art’otel with totally new views of London, in particular of Battersea Power Station, Frank Gehry’s Prospect Place and the tall buildings such as the ”Lipstick” with 50 floors and other - even taller - buildings under construction. Wonder what will happen to the Zaha Hadid Architects £600mm, 53 floor project? Will it get the go ahead? The Vauxhall/Nine Elms area will soon look like “Dubai-on-Thames” as they like to call it. The restaurant called Joia in the art’otel looks very inviting and apparently has a famous Portuguese Michelin star chef. I am sure the rooftop bar will become “the” place to go this summer. #artotel#joia #batterseapowerstation#prospectplace #frankgehry #zahahadid\n\nHead to the V&A if you want a close up of a 1760s model of the The Gold State Coach before the coronation. Charles and Camilla will break with tradition by only using the 260 years old Gold State Coach one way - on their return from the coronation in Westminster Abbey. The coach doesn’t have shock absorbers, heating and air condition like the more comfortable Diamond Jubilee State Coach. Many interesting points about this splendid coach: Used at every coronation since 1831 Not made of solid gold but by a thin layer of gold leaf over wood. Weighs 4 tonnes and needs 8 horses to draw it Queen Elizabeth II used a hot water bottle while in the coach Queen Victoria didn’t like it The coach was designed by Scottish-Swedish architect Sir William Chambers for George III, he was the king’s architectural tutor at the time. You can see the real thing in The Royal Mews after the Coronation. Not to be missed. Absolutely gorgeous. #sirwilliamchambers #coronationcoach #goldstatecoach #royalmews #georgeiii #diamondjubileecoach\n\nYou have probably seen the huge silver gilt wine cooler, that Queen Victoria converted into a punch bowl (p.1) in The Tower of London. It weighs 227 kilos and dates to 1829. Maybe you haven’t noticed the Victorian replica in the amazing V&A silver gallery of an even earlier example in silver made in the 1730s and also weighing 227 kilos. The original was commissioned by a goldsmith/banker - on behalf of a client? - as the largest ever wine cooler to celebrate the pleasures of wine (details in p.2) Apparently the client didn’t pay the bill and the wine cooler ended up as a prize in a lottery to fund the building of Westminster Bridge in the 1750s (3rd bridge over the Thames after London and Putney Bridges). The winner sold it to a Russian Grand Duchess and the original is still in the Hermitage. Interesting that both red and white wine was drunk chilled. Ice was taken from an underground ice-house, an idea that came from France in 1660s. #winecooler #silvergallery #silvergilt #hermitage"
