        "text": "Artist Name: Isaac Grunewald\n\nSwedish, 1889 – 1946\n\nIsaac Grünewald is one of Sweden’s most colorful and famous artists. He had a big role in the modern art movement in Sweden (Albertbonniersforlag, 2015).\n\nArt style: Expressionism, Fauvism & Modernism\n\nInspiration: Henri Matisse, Paul Cézanne & His wife, Sigrid Hjertén\n\nAssociated with: Colorful & flowers\n\nFacts: Isaac Grünewald, was born in Sweden, 1889. He grew up in a extremely poor jewish family and had 12 siblings. He discovered his interest for painting at an early age but he had difficulties getting paint equipment. At the age of 13 he created his first oil-painting. He was 19 years old when he went to Paris to become a student of Henri Matisse. It was here he met his wife, Sigrid Hjertén because she was also a student of Matisse. 2 years after his time in Paris he had an exhibition which did not have any success. The viewers had a hard time accepting his use of colors and innovative art. Grünewald lived in Paris between 1920—31, these years were his most successful years. Grünewald experienced success throughout his life but he also went through a lot of struggles; antisemitism, he had a hard time with his wife (Sigrid Hjerten), prison punishment and an early death. Today he is seen as one Swedens greatest artists of the 20th century (Albertbonniersforlag, 2015).\n\nDo I like his art? YES! I love his art! I would love to have a piece in my future home. I love the color scheme he uses and that he paints a lot of flowers etc."
