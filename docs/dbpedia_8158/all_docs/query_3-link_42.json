        "text": "Department\n\nSwedish modern and contemporary art\n\nThe interest in modern Swedish art has steadily increased over the last decades, resulting in higher prices. The Swedish modern art is mainly associated with the pioneering artists who introduced the modernist art movement in Sweden in the early 1900s. Isaac Grünewald, Sigrid Hjertén and Leander Engström, all students of Matisse, are particularly prominent. They were received as radicals with their groundbreaking paintings and today their early works are strongly requested by the auction clients.\n\nAs the popularity of Modern art and design increased, the interest in Modern sculpture also augmented. Just as with art and prints, we are grateful to the many talented art galleries in Sweden who brought modern international sculpture to our country. There are also several talented Swedish sculptors from the 1900s that are in demand internationally.\n\nThe Swedish art in the 1900s is characterized by different art movements and styles.\n\nOur clients always search art by\n\nIsaac Grünewald, Sigrid Hjertén, Leander Engström, Einar Jolin, Nils Dardel, Maj Bring, Gösta Adrian-Nilsson, Otto G.
