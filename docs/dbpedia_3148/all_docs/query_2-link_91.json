        "text": "The most striking attempt is “Sleeping on My Dreams,” which Collier has called his favorite track on the album. It is, seemingly, a song about a breakup: “Now the time has come for me to admit/I don’t think I could be your line of best fit,” Collier sings, a lyric that doesn’t quite trip off the tongue. But like all his songs, it is also about music itself, a formal exercise that tests how many sounds and ideas one pop recording can bear. There are electronic bleats and snatches of funk guitar. There is pop-soul crooning and weird vocal harmonies that swoop across the stereo spectrum. There is a psychedelic prechorus and a buoyant R.&B. chorus, the sturdiest groove Collier has concocted. He sang and played every note; when he performed the song on “The Late Late Show With James Corden” in January, he raced between instruments, tapping at a vibraphone, playing kick drum and piano simultaneously and fingering the Harmonizer, an instrument designed for him by an M.I.T. grad student. The performance was typical Collier: a kind of epic humblebrag, a casual display of genius.\n\nTo call Collier a genius is not exactly a critical judgment. It’s a statement of the obvious. When Jason King, the chairman of the Clive Davis Institute of Recorded Music at New York University, asked the jazz piano great Herbie Hancock for a point of comparison to Collier, in terms of talent, Hancock replied, “Maybe Stravinsky?” Musicians and musicologists have been floored by Collier’s harmonic explorations, like the brain-bending modulation from the key of E to that of “G½ sharp” in his 2016 rendition of “In the Bleak Midwinter.” He revels in whimsical, high-degree-of-difficulty challenges. On New Year’s Day, he posted an Instagram video of himself playing a raucous keyboard solo designed so that the notes, as they appeared in his recording software, spelled out “HAPPY 2021.”\n\nBut do great gifts necessarily yield good songs? There has always been a tension in music, especially in pop, between technical fluency and the more nebulous qualities — style, wit, magnetism, emotional pull — that make a performer captivating. Some musicians have it all. Some are audibly blessed with more of one gift than another. Then there are those for whom technical prowess seems almost like an impediment to creating music that speaks to large audiences.\n\nCollier is a peculiar case: a wunderkind whose objectively groundbreaking music can strike listeners as unremarkable, even dull. Part of the issue is his voice. He has perfect pitch and astonishing range, but in pop music, technique is far less crucial than personality, expressiveness, “vibe.” For a musician so in-the-pocket, his singing also has surprisingly little rhythmic feel, a deficiency you can hear in the verses of “Sleeping on My Dreams,” where he stumbles over syncopations. The pallor of his tone, and the sheer volume of stuff he attempts to cram into each measure, give the song a lead-footed feeling. It lumbers when it should strut.\n\nAt least that’s the way I hear it. Others, more steeped in theory, may experience an entirely different song. This is the paradox of Jacob Collier. During a 2017 master class in Buenos Aires, he told the audience that hardly any songs on his forthcoming album were “in A440” — that is, in standard pitch. “You can be more emotional if a key is in a different place,” he exulted. This is undoubtedly true if, like Collier, you are among the fraction of people with perfect pitch. For those who can follow along, his moonshot journeys into new realms of pitch, temperament and microtonality are thrilling. But Collier has chosen to work in pop, where communication between artists and audiences takes place on an earthier plane. Some of his greatest feats may not even register with lay listeners, even as a vague intimation or emotion.\n\nFor many of us, the best way to appreciate Collier’s songs is to hear him talk about them. This is no insult: His eloquent, often hilarious musical exegeses are more fun than most people’s music, one of the more intellectually gratifying ways I know to kill time online. In the Logic Session Breakdown for “Sleeping on My Dreams,” he discusses the song’s 331 tracks, highlighting the kick drum “shrugs,” the beats he tapped on a Grammy Award trophy (“Grammys do make good agogo bells”) and the dozens of layers of vocal and instrumental harmonies. Watching and listening as he turns his song inside out, you have an oddly inverted experience of music appreciation: The sum of the parts appears far greater than the whole, and the sturdiness and beauty of the underlying architecture shines through. Someday, Collier’s music may catch up with his musicology.\n\nJody Rosen is a contributing writer for the magazine and the author of the forthcoming book “Two Wheels Good: The Bicycle on Planet Earth and Elsewhere.” Celina Pereira is a Brazilian-American graphic designer and artist based in Los Angeles.\n\nThe amount of time that I could go out and about, as a person who is now 77, is very limited. It’s difficult to travel and be on the road at any age, but especially at my age, most of which has to do with the physical reality that your body starts breaking down. I have a trick knee — I have to travel with crutches. When I do a concert online, the lighting isn’t as spectacular, but it’s more intimate, because I’m able to get up on my audience and talk to them in a way that I cannot when I’m onstage. The stage has wonderful characteristics, but in truth I prefer the intimacy of that connection. For a lot of musicians, they jump around onstage, there’s a lot of large motion happening — but if you’re a more intimate kind of performer, then that’s very difficult to translate.\n\nYou’ve spoken about the “Universal Broadcasting System,” your belief that art is transmitted to us by the universe. Is that how “River Dreams” came to you? I was noodling around the piano one day, and all of a sudden, I realized it wasn’t noodling. There was something going on beyond anything I ever thought about. Out through my hands and out of my mouth came something, and that was it. I hit my iPad, and literally, in one recording, that was “River Dreams.” That was a trance — literally, a transmission. I really appreciate that there were no words attached to it. You can relate to it without having to know a language.\n\nWhat were you feeling as you made it? Mostly it’s awe, because I know I couldn’t have sat down and thought that out. I studied music, yes, yes, and I did the things that you need to do in order to develop your craft, but the best way I can put it is like this: Most of my dearest friends are visual artists, and they all say the same thing. “I’m getting on the canvas, and all of a sudden, there’s a hand that’s molding whatever it is, and when I’m finished, I stand back and go, ‘Oh, that was sent through.’”\n\nYou’ve talked about the challenges of being Black in a white world, transgender in a heteronormative culture, an artist in a business world. I think one reason your music and career have resonated with a young audience is the resilience it suggests. Life is about wonderful things and very difficult things. I just accepted that that was an aspect of the difficulties that I was going to be experiencing — that I had all kinds of other wonderful things in my life.\n\nWe have infinite compassion within each of us. It’s just — How do we tap it? How do we tap into our infinite wisdom, our infinite courage? I’m having to figure out how to be wiser, and more compassionate, and more courageous. If I can share that and share my process of how I am doing that, and many other people can share their processes, we can be wiser, more courageous, more compassionate.\n\nI never have a plan for what I’m going to do. I sit at the piano, and I see what comes out, you know? But I noted that this is a little bit of a pause for me, and I’m curious to find out what will evolve in the pause. What directions will I be sent in, by whatever?\n\nThis interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.\n\nJeremy Gordon is a writer from Chicago whose work appears in The New York Times, Pitchfork, The Nation and other publications. Celina Pereira is a Brazilian-American graphic designer and artist based in Los Angeles.\n\nIn Baltimore, HARMONY closed with a song the group hasn’t recorded but Frisell has played often over the past few years. It’s an uncomplicated tune with a very deep history. Musicologists have traced its origin to an 18th-century hymn, and a version of it was likely sung by enslaved laborers. It was a union song too, sung by striking workers in the ’40s, around the time Pete Seeger first heard it and helped spread it to the folk-festival audiences of the ’60s. The civil rights movement, starting with the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, adopted it as an unofficial anthem, making it famous enough that President Johnson quoted its title in his 1965 call for the Voting Rights Act. In all of these cases — and also in Tiananmen Square, Soweto and the many other sites of protest where it has been heard — “We Shall Overcome” has been more a statement of collective hope than a call to arms. It is a proclamation of faith.\n\nFrisell told me that, musically speaking, he likes the song because of how deeply he has internalized it. “Like when you’re walking and humming or whistling, almost unconscious that you’re doing it — that’s what you want,” he says. “That’s what ‘We Shall Overcome’ is. It’s in us, the melody and the words. When I play it, the song is like a jungle gym you can play around in. The song is there, and you can take off anywhere.”\n\nIn Baltimore, Frisell and his bandmates moved through “We Shall Overcome” with joyful purpose, Frisell improvising while all three vocalists joined together. I didn’t know it then, but this would be my last ticketed concert before venues across the country went dark. The last thing I experienced in a full club was Petra Haden raising her hands high and compelling us all — Frisell now included — to sing together for our deliverance.\n\nHad things gone as planned, Frisell’s next move would have been to focus on a new group, this one nominally a jazz trio, with the bassist Thomas Morgan and the drummer Rudy Royston. Things, of course, did not go as planned. Frisell’s datebook was soon filled with canceled gigs. “It’s been kind of traumatic,” he told me via Zoom, though his ever-present smile never quite wavered. But the new trio’s debut album did eventually come out, in August 2020. It closes with its own version of “We Shall Overcome” — this one instrumental, pastoral in its feeling, a soul ballad at the end of a record spent rambling around the outskirts of high-​lonesome country and spacious modern jazz.\n\nRoyston and Morgan are well established in their own careers, but they’re both younger than Frisell, and each came up in a wide-open jazz world that Frisell helped create. In the early 1980s, Frisell began incorporating digital loops and other effects into his live and recorded playing and wound up crafting an entirely new role for the electric guitar in a jazz setting: creating atmospheres full of sparkling reverb, echoing harmonics, undulating whispers that sneak in from outside the band. As he wove those patches of sound around a trio, with the drummer Paul Motian and the saxophonist Joe Lovano, he brought a new spaciousness and pensiveness to the instrument, completely resetting its dynamic range. His quietest playing was like a distant radio; his loudest was a heavy-metal scream that could sit neatly beside, for instance, the Living Colour guitarist Vernon Reid on a 1985 duet album, “Smash & Scatteration.”\n\nFrisell’s approach to his repertoire was just as innovative. He knew his standards but gained an early reputation for openness to pop music and just about anything else — most famously on his 1992 record “Have a Little Faith,” which features everything from a small-group orchestration of an Aaron Copland ballet score to the same band’s searing instrumental version of Madonna’s “Live to Tell.” There was a similar adventurousness in his originals: Across the ’90s, he composed for violin and horns (on “Quartet”), for bluegrass musicians (on “Nashville”), for film scores and for installation soundtracks.\n\nThis is Frisell’s great accomplishment: He makes a guitar sound so unique that it can fit with anything. This became fully clear around the turn of this century, when his records skipped from improvised bluegrass to “The Intercontinentals” — which featured a band of Greek, Malian, American and Brazilian musicians — and then through to “Unspeakable,” a sample-based record made with the producer Hal Willner, a friend since 1980. Willner also introduced Frisell to artists like Lucinda Williams, Elvis Costello and Allen Ginsberg, three of many legends who have invited Frisell into the studio to add his signature to their recordings. Every year of this century, he has appeared on or led a new record, often several records, and yet it would be impossible for even the most obsessive fan to guess what the next one might sound like.\n\nFrisell has largely swapped his old dynamic range for a stylistic one: He doesn’t play as loud these days, but he plays everything, and with everyone. He is on the young side of jazz-elder-statesman status, but in the past four decades, no one else has taken the collaborative, improvisational spirit of that music to so many places.\n\nAnd now, like so many of us, he’s just at home. “I shouldn’t be complaining,” he told me, from the house in Brooklyn that he shares with his wife. “I’m healthy, I have my guitar. But my whole life has been about interacting musically with somebody else.” At one point he held up a stack of notebooks and staff-paper pads: “What am I gonna do with this stuff?” he asked. “Usually I’ll write enough, and I’ll get a group together and make a record. But that’s after like a week or two of writing. Now it’s a year or more of ideas.”\n\nHe has played a few outdoor shows in front yards with his longtime collaborators Kenny Wollesen on drums and Tony Scherr on bass. He has played similar gigs with Morgan and Royston. He has performed streamed concerts, including a recent Tyshawn Sorey show, at the Village Vanguard, with Lovano. Frisell has mourned too: Hal Willner died from Covid-19 in April, right after the two were discussing their next collaboration. And he has practiced — as if he were back in high school, he says, working through songs from his favorite records in his bedroom. Often they’re the same ones he practiced in the mid-1960s, from Thelonious Monk to “Stardust.”\n\nBut that is the extent of recent musical connection for a guy who describes playing guitar as his preferred method of “speech” — a guy who got a guitar in 1965 and, since joining his first garage band, has rarely gone a day without playing with somebody else.\n\nFrisell says he can’t remember when he first heard “We Shall Overcome,” but it would have been sometime during his school days in Denver. “I grew up in a time with a music program in public schools,” he told me. “I’m in seventh grade, and that song was coming around that time. And my English teacher, Mr. Newcomb, is playing us Bob Dylan records, because he said it was like poetry. This was 1963, ’64. On TV you see ‘Hootenanny’ along with Kennedy’s assassination. January 1964, I saw M.L.K. speak at our church. A couple weeks before that, ‘The Times They Are a-Changin’’ came out. Then a couple weeks after that, the Beatles were on Ed Sullivan. It was in the air.”\n\nThe neighborhood he grew up in, he told me, was very “Leave It to Beaver” and overwhelmingly white. It was Denver East High School, and its band threw him together with a wider group of kids, including the future Earth, Wind & Fire members Andrew Woolfolk, Philip Bailey and Larry Dunn. “When Martin Luther King was killed, our high school concert band was performing and the principal came in and told everyone,” Frisell says. “It was horrible. I was in the band room, with Andrew Woolfolk, with my Japanese-American friend whose parents were in the internment camps, and we were comforting each other.” It gave him the sense that music transcended personal differences and that the camaraderie shared by collaborators was a model for other forms of strife. “From that time, I carry with me this idea that the music community is ahead of its time trying to work things out.”\n\n“We Shall Overcome” became a regular part of his repertoire in 2017. It’s not the first time he has gone through a phase of ruminating on a particular tune, working through it in different settings: Surely no one else has recorded so many versions of “Shenandoah,” and he played “A Change Is Gonna Come” a lot during the George W. Bush presidency. But as we moved through the past four years, he was drawn back to “We Shall Overcome,” this tune from his childhood. “I was just trying to make a small hopeful statement,” he says. He didn’t know that by the time his trio released the song on their debut, it would be the summer of the George Floyd protests and John Lewis’s death. They reminded him, he says, that “We Shall Overcome” is “one of those songs that is always relevant. That song kind of sums it up. Every time I think about giving up, there are these people like John Lewis — we owe it to them to keep going and trying.”\n\nFrisell appeared on at least nine albums in 2020, including his trio’s “Valentine,” records from Elvis Costello and Ron Miles and Laura Veirs, tributes to the music of T. Rex and the poetry of Allen Ginsberg and “Americana,” a collaboration with the Swiss harmonica player Grégoire Maret and the French pianist Romain Collin. “Americana” is the closest to a “typical” Frisell album, meaning it features not just his languid, layered playing but also his heart-tugging sense of emotional drama. The tempos are slow, and the track list includes recognizable pop covers, such as “Wichita Lineman” and Bon Iver’s “Re: Stacks.”\n\nThe album is improvisational, but it’s cozier and more melodic than most contemporary jazz. This is another mode that Frisell pioneered. If you watch solemn documentaries about heartland struggles or are familiar with public radio’s interstitial music, you’ve heard his influence. Younger guitarists in the cosmic-country realm, like William Tyler and Steve Gunn, also have a bit of Frisell’s unassuming lope. He’s one of the quietest guitar heroes in the instrument’s history.\n\nHis only trick, as he explains it, is “trying to stay connected to this sense of wonder and amazement. That’s where it helps to have other people. Even just one other person. If I play by myself or write a melody, it’s one thing. But if I give it to someone else, they’re going to play it slower, faster, suddenly you’re off into the zone. Being off the edge of what you know, that’s the best place.”\n\nThis attitude has earned him a lifetime spent on stages and records with artists that he revered and studied as a boy, jazz players like Ron Carter, Charles Lloyd and Jack DeJohnette. But now that this journey is on pause, for the first time in 55 years, it’s as though Frisell has no choice but to take stock of what he has learned from these artists and his relationship with their legacies. “It’s just overwhelming what we owe to Black people,” he said at one point in our conversation. “Our culture, we would be nothing. Nothing. But personally, too.” He recalled, again, his teenage years: “In Denver, I was always welcomed into it. It didn’t matter that I was white. I remember a great tenor player named Ron Washington. He was in a big band where you just read the charts, and I could do that and get through the gig. An agent set up those gigs, and he called me once, and I showed up, but it wasn’t the big band. It was just Ron, a drummer and me. I didn’t know any tunes at all.” He laughed again, then described something reminiscent of the second verse of “We Shall Overcome,” the one about walking hand in hand: “Ron was so cool. He just said, ‘Let’s play a blues.’ Then another. And another. He led me through.”\n\nJohn Lingan is the author of “Homeplace: A Southern Town, a Country Legend and the Last Days of a Mountaintop Honky-Tonk.” Celina Pereira is a Brazilian-American graphic designer and artist based in Los Angeles.\n\nTo understand what happens next, you must appreciate that “Giant Steps” isn’t merely Coltrane’s masterpiece; it’s among the more difficult jazz standards to perform. The song is a whirling dervish: 26 chord changes in 16 rapid-fire bars, a steady spiral of major-third modulations that can make even the most adept players scramble. The great pianist Tommy Flanagan takes his solo haltingly on the original recording, racing to keep pace, the music careering out ahead of him. “Giant Steps” has been played countless times by countless people, but no version I’d ever encountered came close to the breakneck virtuosity and thrill of that original.\n\nThen I watched this duo do “Giant Steps” — not Bieber and Aguilera, but the drummer J.D. Beck (16 at the time) and the keyboard player DOMi (19) — and I thought, in this exact order: Oh. Oh, my. Wow. What? WHAT? After a few minutes I started emitting short, snorting laughs. Not because the music was funny, but because you have got to be kidding me: Who were these kids?\n\nOver the past year or two, as posts of their shows and rehearsals came online, a lot of people have had similar reactions to DOMi and J.D. Beck. Clips of them in sponsored sessions — for, say, the keyboard maker Nord or the cymbal maker Zildjian — are followed by reaction videos from older musicians who cannot believe their eyes or ears. There’s a whole subsection of YouTube videos just trying to unpack Beck’s drumming. Last summer, when the Roots assembled a virtual concert, Beck and DOMi made a video appearance, and several of the comments beneath had to do with their otherworldliness: The ongoing joke is that these two might be aliens, crash-landed on Earth to teach a new form of music. (That, or robots.) Before it emerged that the rapper MF Doom had died, the duo posted a video that bounced through selections from “Madvillainy,” his beloved 2004 album with Madlib — once again taking what had been revolutionary and pulling it still further.\n\nThen there was the time last November when they performed for the virtual Adult Swim Festival alongside the bassist Thundercat, playing his song “Them Changes” with the pop star Ariana Grande on guest vocals. For a few minutes, near the end, the song devolved into a series of increasingly spicy jazz riffs, leaving Grande bobbing gamely along. It was a weird moment, but somehow it didn’t feel like a stretch for these two to be sharing the stage with a gigantic pop star. Their music, freakishly complex and virtuosic as it may be, is not a “difficult” listen. It’s sparkly, relentlessly melodic, infused with familiar reference points from funk, neo-soul, the left-field hip-hop of J. Dilla and Madlib, the electronic breaks of Aphex Twin and the loading-screen jingles of Nintendo — like playing Mario Kart while your roommate chops up Pharoah Sanders samples on his laptop. It’s just that Beck and DOMi are, at their core, jazz musicians; the thrill is hearing them improvise, listening in on the meeting of two extraordinary musical minds.\n\nDuring another sponsored session, for Nord, the duo again played “Giant Steps” (only now they titled it, hilariously and disrespectfully, “Giant Nuts”). Midway through, as DOMi is working through an idea, she declares, “I hate this,” and the two shift gears, briefly locking eyes as they blast through the remainder of the song. Playing it to that crowd in Los Angeles, she offers a pretty table-setting line before moving her left hand to a second keyboard to play the bass part — all while her right hand covers both the chord changes and Coltrane’s lead sax flourishes. Beck joins on his small drum kit, ludicrously fast and tight. The rhythm of “Giant Steps” is usually swung, but with Beck it feels nearly electronic; the hyperspeed clatter of his playing can sound like the chopped-up beats of drum and bass, sounds that once felt reserved for computers. At first, he leaves open space to showcase DOMi’s genius. Then she begins vamping, turning things over for him to unleash a series of fills that seem to break apart the space-time continuum.\n\nI’ve studied the video from the Los Angeles show, frame by frame, many times, trying to figure out what is even happening with their hands. It all seems vaguely impossible. Beck is slouched, barely moving his wrists, creating an entire soundscape from flurries of drum strikes; DOMi sits straight-backed, each hand working through more overlapping ideas than you’d think one person could have brain space, let alone fingers, to execute. When they finish, the crowd erupts, and DOMi puts her phone up to the mic to amplify a series of fart noises — an introduction to the next song, which is called “Bathroom,” because, Beck explains, that’s where they wrote it.\n\nAt moments, coming from players this virtuosic, all of it can feel like a wry put-on — the fart sounds, the song titles, the way they pick up and toss off ideas, genres, time signatures, memes. Maybe this is exactly the type of music we should have expected from a generation that has grown up with not only the entire history of recorded music fully available to them — on demand, since sentience — but everything around the music, too: how to play it, why it works, what is cliché and what is fresh. Their music is both radically sophisticated and full of jokes, a combination of qualities you find in both the 20th century’s jazz greats and the 21st century’s extremely online teenagers. Just after “Bathroom,” they make an absolutely searing, hip-hop-inflected bop out of the theme song from “The Flintstones,” a standard in its day and now constantly covered by YouTube musicians. Why? Why not.\n\nDOMi is Domitille Degalle, who studied at the National Superior Conservatory of Music and Dance in Paris and the Berklee College of Music in Boston. She met Beck in 2018, when each was invited to play at NAMM, the National Association of Music Merchants’ trade show, by a mutual friend: the drummer Robert Searight, who goes by Sput, of the jazz-and-funk collective Snarky Puppy. Beck had been a drum prodigy since age 8 and gigging since 10, mostly around his home in Dallas — with Erykah Badu’s band, with the bassist MonoNeon and eventually with the experimental soul artist Jon Bap.\n\nApparently, the equipment in the booth where Beck and DOMi first played together was not great. “Everyone sounded bad,” is how DOMi remembers it. “It was so bad. But funny.” Still, they went out to a jam session that night and played together again. DOMi had never heard a drummer quite like Beck before — one “where you know it’s J.D. when he plays,” she has said. “He’s going to change your whole thing when he plays.” When he mentioned that he would be performing at Erykah Badu’s birthday party, “I was like: ‘You know what? I don’t have class. I’m going to come.’” She flew to Dallas for a weekend, joining on keys at the end of the show. When her flight home was canceled, she stayed for another week, playing music with Beck virtually nonstop.\n\nIt wasn’t long after they paired up that they began posting bits of their jam sessions online, causing certain nerd-heavy corners of the music internet to go completely bananas. They caught the attention of Skrillex and will.i.am, who joined the line of established musicians who suddenly badly wanted to work with them. They started performing with Thundercat and became friends with Anderson .Paak, who is producing their debut album.\n\nThat album has been anticipated for nearly as long as DOMi and Beck have been playing together. Over a year ago, DOMi told an interviewer that it was nearly complete, that half was instrumental and half featured “some artists that we really love,” that it would be all originals plus one cover. The interviewer, from WBGO’s “The Checkout: Live at Berklee,” replied that “it’s going to be nothing like what we’re used to seeing,” which is correct: The duo’s output up to this point has been video of them performing live, an electricity that might be difficult to capture on record.\n\nIn the same interview, Beck said that their approach to music was, simply, “Let’s play everything imaginable and try to do something weird.” Within their mini set for that Roots show was an original called “Baby Groot” that serves as a perfect distillation of that impulse. It’s an unbelievably tight, fast groove that keeps pulsing in different directions: mellowing then brightening, turning gentle then nasty. It shouldn’t cohere, but it does, and it genuinely sounds like nothing that has come before it.\n\nThey finished out their Los Angeles set, the one they began with “Giant Steps,” with a version of “Baby Groot” that lasted just over a minute, a brilliant kicker tossed off at the end, the cherry on top. An answer to Coltrane, only named after the tiny anthropomorphic tree-man from “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2.” When the song was over, they stood, DOMi said thanks, Beck threw a thumbs up and with that they left the stage.\n\nRyan Bradley is a writer in Los Angeles.

That seems connected to your lyrical sensibility, which has this striking specificity but also a sense of remove. I’m wondering if you worry about the source of your gift also being what prevents your happiness. You’ve tapped into the thing that I think about every day. I spend hundreds of dollars on therapy a week so that I can fix that problem. I’ve also monetized it by using it to write songs, so it’s a complex thing. I’d love to inch closer to feeling good things and bad things more in the moment, but when I sit down to write, I just can’t be super emotionally activated. It takes me years to write about something.\n\nSo how did you arrive at “Kyoto”? Word vomit. I do this thing when I feel frustrated where I just say what’s on the top of my head or rhyme random stuff. The first couple lyrics of the song came out like that. Then I was like, I can’t just talk about addiction issues. It has to be more interesting than that. I should tell you more context about my relationship with my dad. Marshall Vore wrote the song with me because I was struggling with this thing we call “dumpster dads.” He and I have a lot of shared experiences, whether it’s abandonment or gaslighting. And Marshall was like, everybody’s dumpster dad gets them to drive way too early. I thought: That’s funny. I’ll put that in there. So the truck bit in the song was, I thought, made up. Then I was driving in Pasadena and had a recovered memory of driving my dad’s truck when I was a child — this was after we finished the song. So the emotional distance goes even further than a mind-set that I need to get into to write. It’s natural for me.\n\nThe detail in your lyrics and even your openness on Twitter and in interviews encourages the idea that there’s a one-to-one relationship between you and the persona in your songs. Is there any space between the two? No. I can only really write from my perspective. That was one of the things that was mind-blowing about seeing the way that Conor Oberst wrote when we were working on our record [“Better Oblivion Community Center,” from 2019]. He’d go, What would it be like to be this person? What would you think about and do? I’m not that creative. I only have my experience to go on. But there are little bends in the truth: I wrote a song called “Would You Rather” on my first record [“Stranger in the Alps,” from 2017] about my brother and domestic violence and when my house caught on fire when I was 19. My mother was hurt in the fire, and everyone was psychologically freaked out. One of the cops wondered if my brother had done it, but he had no part in it. In the song I say that he would prefer to drown than go up in flames. Then a couple of years ago my brother said, “I definitely prefer fire, so I don’t know why you said that.” [Laughs.] He’s hilarious.\n\nIt seems like such an emotional minefield to write about your family. Sometimes I think, Why did I open that up? I also have this tendency interpersonally — I’m the anxious-avoidant attachment type. I’ll talk to my therapist or my mom about how upset I am about something somebody did, and the logical conclusion is, Well, you should tell that person. Then I’d have to resolve it, when what I want is to exile them from my life. But it’s common to not have black-and-white feelings about your family, and it’s nice to talk to people who’ve had similar experiences. It makes me feel less alone, and I get more of those experiences from sharing my own. But I don’t like when my family hears it.\n\nI know that the characters in the song are composites, but what did your dad think of “Kyoto”? We started talking again during Covid. I’d forgotten how much we have in common. He’s very political, and it’s rad. I have so many friends who lost contact with family over politics, and with my dad it was the opposite. That was cool. But we didn’t talk about “Kyoto.” Then the Grammy nominations came out, and we talked on the phone, and as a joke he was like, “You’re welcome” — for the song. It was kind of nice. I don’t know. There are some things that I don’t want to talk about with anybody who’s not my therapist or my friends, but on a basic level hearing that was not quite closure, but it was definitely OK.\n\nYour dad’s comment about “Kyoto” aside, what’s been most interesting about the process of being nominated for a handful of Grammys? My mom used to say life isn’t a competition, but it feels good to win. That’s exactly what it is. I made something that I like, and it’s cool that people have shone a light on it. It’s also been nice for my family to realize that I have a real job. They thought I was busking on the street until like two months ago.\n\nI know that your mom has started doing stand-up. Have you seen her perform? Oh, yeah. When she told me she was taking a comedy class — concerning. Then she invited me to go see her — so concerning. I don’t drink that much, but I ordered five drinks and was shwasted by the time she came onstage. And she crushed it. Went to see her the next time, totally dry, she was still funny as [expletive]. It was a relief. Like if you’re dating someone and they start writing poetry, you have to be like, “Oh, cool.” But this was my mom. She’s always been hilarious, but I was nervous.\n\nDid she tell jokes about you? Yeah. There was one involving my sending her a picture when I thought I had an S.T.D. when I was a teenager.\n\nYou got a little of your own medicine. Totally. I gave her permission to joke about me, too. I was like, I’ve definitely subjected you to a weird spotlight.\n\nSpeaking of: There was a Spotify billboard in L.A. featuring you that had a tagline about hitting the road with a guitar — what’d it say? “Hitting the road with six strings and a U.T.I.”\n\nRight. It made me wonder, if that line got approved, what got rejected? They all came from my tweets. But there was one that was, “I was sexually active before I stopped wetting the bed.” Which, if you flip it, sounds like I was assaulted when I was a kid. But the truth is that the last time I wet the bed I was like 20. It runs in my family. What I loved is that the person I was dating at the time — I did it, and I thought, Are you kidding me? I woke them up and was like, “I’m really sorry but I totally wet the bed.” And they were like: “I’m tired. I’m going to just scoot over.” Then I never did it again. It was like a magical fairy-tale solution. All I needed was acceptance and someone who didn’t give a [expletive] and the problem was solved. You look back at what you obsessed about when you were younger, the stuff that made you go, “I would evaporate if anybody ever knew,” and then you turn into an adult and realize no one cares. Your world is biggest to you. Which is good to remember.\n\nHow do you see the interplay between your public profile and your music? Because in certain corners of social media, you’ve become almost the personification of a certain kind of jokey sad-girl aesthetic. I could imagine your not wanting that to detract from your music. I don’t know. There is definitely a millennial sense of humor that I’ve been guilty of that’s, like, “I’m in bed all day because I’m so depressed; Ben and Jerry are my boyfriends.” And I was trying to go back on Instagram and delete all my old VSCO Cam white-border photos. You know, I saw a TikTok the other day that said: “On my way to 2014. Need anything?” and it was black and white and the girl was wearing a hat and skinny jeans and matte-leather jacket and black nail polish. Then I go look at my raccoon makeup from 2014 — that’s the element that is disturbing to me. You don’t want to become dated. But hopefully the way to solve that is to constantly grow and not become a cartoon of myself; be self-aware and surround yourself with people who don’t laugh at everything you say and tell you that you’re a god.\n\nHave you been tempted to do that? No. I mean, yeah, you meet a fan on the street, you say something unfunny and they go, Ha ha ha ha ha ha! Like, I can see how I could be addicted to that.\n\nAfter the allegations of Marilyn Manson’s abuse came out, you tweeted about a weird experience you had with him. Can you fill in that story? How was it that you wound up at his house? He was trying out for a TV show that my friend’s dad was working on, and my friend’s dad was like, “I know you’re a big fan, come with us to meet him.” So I went with two of my best friends. One of them is my guitar player, Harrison. I think I was 18. I am not a victim of his, so I’m not trying to take up space, but I did want to say I witnessed him at his best, and he made tons of rape jokes, used the N-word, joked about swastikas. There was a beanbag chair that he had for me to sit on, and he was like, “I’ve [expletive] so many people in that beanbag chair.” I hated all the comments that were like, “What did you expect from Marilyn Manson?” I expect the world. But yeah, as much as you read about this kind of stuff, somehow it still shocks me.\n\nDo you feel an expectation that you must be active on social media? Well, it’s easy to romanticize people with depression or even romanticize yourself and think, The darkest parts of me are what make me an artist, when you don’t have to be abusive or depressed or addicted to make great art. I like using social media to strip back that idea of the depressed artist. But I do get self-conscious of my whole Twitter being Phoebe Bridgers jokes. I want to have a healthier relationship with social media than [expletive]-posting all day about myself.\n\nWhat you might do differently? I have a fantasy of eventually deleting it.\n\nDon’t we all. Yeah. But my connection with fans — I have a friend, Austin, whom I met because he was a yellow-haired kid in the crowd at my shows. I recognized his face on Twitter: He D.M.’d me asking if I wanted to get lunch at a vegan zombie-themed burger restaurant, and I was like, Absolutely I do. The real thing about social media is the direct contact with fans. That can be scary when someone has no boundaries, but I’ve met so many friends through it.\n\nI apologize in advance for this question, which is going to sound so corny: Did having such a career-validating year in 2020 change your feelings about yourself? Because people have fantasies about external success having a direct positive bearing on internal happiness. Yes, it did. People who want to make that some tagline for life — “Success doesn’t affect your happiness” and “Money isn’t everything” — I think those people were probably raised with money. My first three tours, I was in a Prius that I bought when I was 18, going to Taco Bell every day and feeling kind of [expletive]. Now I get to have a latte whenever I want and make art that people will actually listen to. You know, it’s worked out.\n\nThis interview has been edited and condensed for clarity from two conversations.\n\nDavid Marchese is a staff writer for the magazine and the columnist for Talk. John Edmonds is an artist working in photography who lives and works in Brooklyn.\n\nLike a lot of things with Sumney, this project was partly a cerebral exercise, a way to ask big questions. Can there be a positive version of masculinity? A nontoxic version? “What is the version that is mine?” he asked me, sighing. “What’s the version that can feel positive and generative and good?” He growled theatrically, then laughed. “I wanted that, and I want that still.”\n\nSince Sumney self-released his first EP in 2014, he has seemed like an avatar of everything the culturally sensitive modern musician should be. He can sound like anyone — Aretha Franklin, Can, Kate Bush — and has described his music as “an amalgamation of soul, jazz, folk and experimental indie rock.” By 2017, when he released his debut album and moved from Los Angeles into the mountains outside Asheville, N.C., Sumney had even started to feel shackled by his own Next Big Thing status, exhausted by what he saw as a music world that was “trying to either imprint an identity on me or get me to claim one in order to sell me.” He’d shown that he could do just about anything, but what part of “anything” really belonged to him?\n\nIt was alone in the mountains, in a place where he knew no one and no one knew him, that Sumney discovered he didn’t need to close his eyes and pick an identity out of a hat. He already had one, at least for now: that of a ripped, outré exhibitionist who likes posing naked in mountain waterfalls and making huge, dynamic, aggressively diverse double albums like “græ.”\n\n“As intelligent, sensitive, progressive individuals,” he told me, “we run the risk of getting stuck in the trap of rejecting things just because we’ve learned they’re bad and we’ve been indoctrinated into this heteronormative society” — trying to rid our lives of anything that feels tainted by unequal social structures. But does that mean we can’t enjoy aggressive sounds or luxuriate in looking really good naked? “It’s dishonest to reject pleasure,” Sumney says. “I love rock music! I love grating sounds. I love beautiful sounds. I’m singing all the time, like I’m always doing riffs, always screaming at the top of the range of my lungs when I’m alone in my house. And I’m dancing all the time, and I’m also naked all the time. And it was just like, why can’t I be all of those things in public?”\n\nFor most of his life, Sumney felt both invisible and conspicuous — “the worst of both worlds.” Born in San Bernardino and raised by Ghanaian pastor parents, he was the only Black kid in a Christian elementary school; then, in 2001, his family moved back to Accra, which made him the only American kid in an African high school. (“I didn’t have friends,” he says, “but everyone knew who I was.”) By junior year, he was back in the U.S., this time in the bleached-out Inland Empire outpost of Riverside, Calif. Now he was the weirdo African kid — “very nerdy, very skinny” — a grade ahead of his age group and completely out of touch with the last six years of American culture. “There were so many things,” he says, “that contributed to the loser narrative.”\n\nSumney’s detachment and sense of placelessness — a theme he returns to again and again in his music — is a fairly literal result of growing up like this, but it’s also something he feels he was born into. Even in his own family, he says, he was and remains the outsider. Growing up, he felt distant from his parents, and when I ask about his two siblings, he jokingly pretends our connection has dropped before brushing off the question: “We’re cool, though; we’re good.” His parents worked constantly and had very different hopes about their son’s future. “They wanted something more traditional,” he says, “which is a common immigrant story, I think.” A lawyer or a neurosurgeon would have been nice — “like Ben Carson, but 20-years-ago Ben Carson, not this horrifying version. I remember reading his autobiography when I was, like, 12, because it was forced on me.”\n\nThere is still a lot that Sumney doesn’t understand about the way he grew up, including why the family moved back to Ghana. He once thought it was because of his older sister. “She was getting involved with gangs and stuff,” he says, “and my parents were like: ‘Oh, yeah, no. We’re not doing this. We’re going back to Africa.’” Now he’s not sure. “What I learned at a much later age is that my parents were illegal immigrants,” he says. “There are a lot of weird family secrets.”\n\nFiguring out which pieces of this story belong to him and which don’t has been the animating force of Sumney’s creative life. He has been feeling his way into himself since the moment he thinks of as his first successful reinvention. In the early 2010s, he moved to Los Angeles, enrolled at U.C.L.A., got a cool haircut, figured out how to dress. He’d been writing songs in his bedroom since he was 10, but songwriting was frowned on at home, so his relationship with music had remained private, a secret he kept with himself. On his own in Los Angeles, with his parents and siblings now back in Ghana, he started letting other people hear him sing. His first gig was at a college coffee house in 2013. Within months, he was being wined and dined by labels.\n\nIn a way, everything that has happened since has just been Sumney’s attempt to make sense of that moment, when his private self became public. “People really responding to my voice, and thinking I could really sing, is not something I thought would ever happen,” he says. “I don’t have any musical training. I’m self-taught. I didn’t learn things formally. I didn’t think I was that talented.” Even two EPs and one critically acclaimed album later, he still felt displaced. “You have to be aware of this prepared version of yourself,” he says of his life in Los Angeles, “this avatar you’ve created, every single day. Even just walking down the street, the avatar has got to be ready.”\n\nSo he said goodbye to many longtime friends and moved to Asheville, a place he had always loved but where he knew no one. After being torn between many worlds, the blank slate of the unknown felt, to him, the most like an actual home. It was there, in serene isolation, that Sumney found his “boldness,” he told me. “When I was making the first album, I was really obsessed with minimalism,” he remembers. “The whole idea was: Just because you can doesn’t mean you should. In this second record, I was just like: If you can, then you probably should. I was looking at myself, and I was like, damn, bitch, you can.”\n\nThe most impressive thing about “græ” is how cohesive it manages to feel. It is a sprawling, 20-track, 65-minute record of almost arrogantly varied sound: romantic orchestral rapture on “In Bloom,” piano balladry on “Me in 20 Years,” swagger and rage on “Virile,” classic girl-group swoon on “Cut Me,” a cavernous spoken-word setting on “Before You Go,” which features the voice of the actress Michaela Coel. (Also credited on the record: the writer Taiye Selasi, Jill Scott, James Blake, the Esbjörn Svensson jazz trio and the author Michael Chabon, among a vast profusion of others.) “Græ” unfolds languidly, exploring each mood for as long as it feels like keeping you there. It’s also self-consciously smart, both musically and lyrically — often the kiss of death for an art form that needs to live in your gut. And yet, amid all this potentially discordant, thinky maximalism, there’s something steady, warm, confident. Throughout, you’re steeped in the lushness and abundance that Sumney says animates everything he makes.\n\nFor almost 10 years now, Sumney has been the only member of his family living in the United States. He didn’t go back to Ghana “because I was so traumatized by it,” he says. But a few years ago, he started visiting and soon began incorporating a sense of the country into his work. He shot all his album art there, and the ethereal, imposing nudes in waterfalls on his Instagram were taken in the mountains outside Accra — which, he notes, look a lot like the mountains where he lives in North Carolina. Making art “was a good reason to go and connect,” he says; he always had work to use as a cover.\n\nAt the end of 2020, though, something changed. Maybe it was having been home for most of the year, instead of on the road in support of “græ.” Maybe it had just been a long winter and he needed some sun. He went to Ghana for more than a month, the longest stretch since he’d lived there, for no reason beyond wanting to. “It was the best time,” he told me. “I got my citizenship. I have a passport for the first time. I have a driver’s license for the first time. And I realized, for the first time, like really, actively — oh, this is a place that I can come to. I know what restaurant I’d go to. I know how to drive around. I have papers.”\n\nWhen Sumney and I first spoke, via Zoom, we found ourselves in that initial awkward period known to all who’ve spent the year conducting their business from home — the moment of politely commenting on each other’s camera setups and trying to break the ice. I was stumbling through a question about Asheville, community and what I imagined was his evolving sense of home, and eventually I blurted out an inelegant version of it: “You know, at the end of the day, where do you feel like you’re really from?” It felt like the wrong way to ask. But Sumney raised one eyebrow, then smiled broadly. Here was a topic he’d spent a life digesting. “OK!” he said, grinning and leaning into the camera. “Let’s get into it.”\n\nLizzy Goodman is a journalist and the author of “Meet Me in the Bathroom.” John Edmonds is an artist working in photography who lives and works in Brooklyn."
