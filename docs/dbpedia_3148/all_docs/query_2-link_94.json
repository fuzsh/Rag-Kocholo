(Brian Eno, from the liner notes to Neroli, 1993)\n\nBrian Eno and many other composers work in a style that fans call “dark\n\nambient music.” As a commercial category, it enjoyed widespread recognition\n\nonly in the last few years, but it dates back to 1972 and Eno’s and Robert Fripp’s\n\nNo Pussyfooting, the first self-described ambient album. Contemporaneous with\n\nEno’s experiments with “sonic wallpaper” (his term for ambient music), the\n\nindustrial culture movement in England was underway, experimenting with\n\nnoise, shock, and auto-destructive art, and British progressive rock and\n\npsychedelia were breaking down the traditional rock band format and moving\n\nbeyond the three-minute pop song format. What ties these three movements\n\ntogether is that they all came out of the British art schools of the late 1960’s and\n\nearly 1970s; that they were intellectual and highly planned; and that the artists\n\ninvolved worked in isolation -- from each other and their fans.\n\nDark ambient music, which I will simply call “ambient” or “ambient\n\nmusic” hereafter, thus has a rich twenty five-year history of theory and\n\nphilosophy, a reflection of the varied visual, sonic and written art of the art\n\nschools. Not all of ambient’s developments originated in Britain, however. In\n\n© 1997 Eliot Bates\n\n3\n\nGermany, the U.S. and Canada, the source of key experimental rock groups, the\n\ngenre known as “space music” developed in tandem with ambient. In New York\n\nCity, minimalist composers were integrating concepts from Indian raga,\n\nexperimental intonation systems, and electronic synthesis into long meditative\n\nperformances.\n\nAs the compositional form of ambient music continues to evolve, there\n\nhave been changes in the way fans discuss the music. Debates over what works\n\nare ambient have led many fans to conceive of the genre as a way of listening to\n\nmusic, rather than an established canon of compositions. In describing this,\n\nsome fans mention listening rituals, altered states of consciousness, and firmly\n\nheld theories about the power of the music to communicate visual imagery. In\n\naddition to studying ambient music as a compositional form, I will also present it\n\nas a belief system, and my term “ambient belief system” refers to the rituals,\n\nbeliefs, and sacred history that surround ambient music.\n\nFirst, I attempt to make some sense of the musical origins of ambient\n\nmusic, which are broader than what I described above. Chapter 1 defines six\n\n“trajectories,” which start from a cluster of musicians working in a subcultural\n\nmusic scene and trace their paths and ideas as they are transformed into a\n\ncomponent of the ambient belief system. Here I also trace the history of music\n\nrecording, looking critically at issues such as Walter Benjamin’s concept of\n\nmusical “aura,” the debate over sampling and musical theft in other musical\n\nforms; this sets the stage for ambient composers’ justification for their\n\ncompositional techniques. Chapter 2 profiles six major composers, selected\n\n© 1997 Eliot Bates\n\n4\n\nprimarily because of the significant amount of information on them in print.\n\nThe mystique surrounding their work and personal lives mirrors their\n\ncompositions and creative techniques, and to understand their appeal to fans I\n\nhave suggested how each represents a certain “archetype.” In chapter 3 I look\n\nat the fan base of ambient music, including a basic ethnography and the results\n\nof surveys conducted on the Internet. A detailed profile of one ambient listener\n\nis also included.\n\nA tantalizing mystique surrounds the possibility that ambient music\n\ninduces altered states of consciousness, particularly those thought of as\n\n“waking dreams.” Chapter 4 explores the rituals that listeners engage to attain\n\nthese experiences as well as ambient music’s affinity with fantasy and science\n\nfiction literature and role playing games. As nothing exists in print on the\n\nstructure of ambient music or the studio techniques that are used to create it, in\n\nchapter 5 I propose why it is so difficult to analyze and offer six sample analyses\n\nof important pieces. Much of the production is hush-hush, so I can work only\n\nwith my anecdotes and my own knowledge of the recording studio. Chapter 6 is\n\na case study of my own music, which I believe parallels some of the\n\ncompositional structures of better known ambient composers.\n\nThis thesis is the most recent work in a lineage of subcultural studies of\n\npostmodern popular music genres, although, as I will demonstrate, ambient\n\nmusic relates differently to the mainstream than other better-studied\n\nsubcultures do. The main studies referenced for the construction of this work\n\nare Sarah Thornton’s Club Cultures, a look into the British underground club\n\n© 1997 Eliot Bates\n\n5\n\nscenes of the 1980’s; Simon Frith and Howard Horne’s Art Into Pop, which gives\n\nan excellent history of the British art school scene and the emergence of punk\n\nrock from these roots; and David Toop’s Ocean of Sound: Aether Talk, Ambient\n\nSound and Imaginary Worlds, conceived as an aural history of the twentieth\n\ncentury and which includes a number of interviews with ambient, dub, and jazz\n\nmusicians.1 A major inspiration for my composer profiles were the excellent\n\nexamples of cross-cultural micromusics and the studies of bimusicality in Mark\n\nSlobin’s Subcultural Sounds: Micromusics of the West.\n\nOne way in which this work differs from the works listed above -- and the\n\nmain problem in organizing this thesis -- is that the ambient music scene is not\n\ndead yet. In fact, it probably has not even peaked! Thornton’s work is an\n\ninvaluable study of the trendy club scene of London and how localized\n\nmovements such as acid house come -- and go. The retrospective Art Into Pop\n\nlooks at the already passé British punk rock movement, and many of the\n\ncomposers profiled in Ocean of Sound are no longer alive but live on in print and\n\nCD re-issues. At the point of publication of this thesis, almost all the artists are\n\nstill composing ambient music, and they continue to work (as do their fans) in\n\nan anarchistic and non-deterministic environment. It is still possible to see the\n\nincongruities of the ambient music belief system. For example, there is the\n\ntricky relationship between the purported non-commercialism of the artists and\n\n1\n\nTwo other popular music monographs consulted as sources in subcultural studies were\n\nRobert Walser’s Running With the Devil: Power, Gender, and Madness in Heavy Metal Music and\n\n© 1997 Eliot Bates\n\n6\n\nthe fact that they make their living by selling CD’s; there is also the discrepancy\n\nbetween the living naturalistic experiences that happen in bedrooms around the\n\nworld and the mass-produced disc of binary information that is created in an\n\nartificially inseminated recording studio. I imagine that as ambient music fades\n\ninto memory these discrepancies will be erased. This thesis, in part, delights in\n\nthe chance to witness the unpredictable evolution of a living musical form.\n\nPersonal history with ambient\n\nAs this thesis is in part a personal reflection on the aspects of life that\n\nhave inspired me to compose and listen to ambient music, it is appropriate to\n\ndescribe something of my background in it. My initial musical impulses were\n\nfired by my parents’ passionate interest in Scott Joplin ragtime and Bartok\n\nstring quartets. We went to many ragtime and new music concerts, and at age\n\nnine I remember writing my first piano composition -- a crude piano\n\nrepresentation of a hummingbird sound. The ambient sounds of nature\n\ninterested me intensely from an early age, and living close to a large national\n\nforest and the expansive Pacific Ocean provided an vast array of natural sounds.\n\nI first heard composed ambient music in the late 1980’s, on the college\n\nradio station KCSB. They broadcast several space music shows and also the\n\nsyndicated “Music From the Hearts of Space,” featuring space music, new age,\n\nMartin Stokes’ The Arabesk Debate: Music and Musicians in Modern Turkey, which are about\n\nheavy metal and Turkish pop music, respectively.\n\n© 1997 Eliot Bates\n\n7\n\nand the ambient music of Brian Eno and David Sylvian. By the time I was a\n\nstudent at the University of California at Santa Barbara in 1990, I had heard a\n\ngreat deal of music in this vein and was interested in composing music based on\n\n“natural” structures. A chance roommate assignment in my sophomore year\n\npaired me up with my good friend Alex Donahue, who introduced me to the\n\nmusic of Jon Hassell, Steve Roach, and others. Together, we spent large\n\nportions of our college budgets on new ambient music CD’s and devoted all our\n\nfree time to listening in a dark room, on headphones. We found out about\n\ninteresting CD’s from two sources: tracing the musical lineages of ambient\n\ncomposers to see if they had collaborated on some rare recording with other\n\ninteresting artists, creating complete collections of several artists’ work; or\n\nthrough the miraculous Internet, an oasis for obscure taste cultures such as the\n\nambient music subculture. A simple query on the ambient newsgroup about\n\npeoples’ “favorite ambient albums that sound like Brian Eno” could generate\n\ndozens of eager responses.\n\nAfter much listening and two years of music composition lessons at\n\nU.C.S.B., I gained access to the electronic music labs and began working on\n\nseveral tape pieces. In one, I simulated various atmospheric phenomena,\n\ncreating artificial representations of rain, thunder, hail, and the like. Other\n\npieces, composed with the computer program “cmusic,” explored manipulations\n\nof the timbres of sampled trumpet and ambient sounds. I structured most of the\n\npieces on existing models of Jon Hassell and Robert Fripp but used different\n\ntimbres to construct the pieces. The culmination of my west coast involvement\n\n© 1997 Eliot Bates\n\n8\n\nin the ambient music scene was as a performer in an industrial band with\n\nambient leanings. We performed on KCSB radio shows on several occasions\n\nand produced the soundtracks to two underground films. Our sound sources\n\nwere mostly amplified gamelan instruments and electric guitar feedback,\n\nthough we used distorted vocalization, too. These radio shows broadcast late at\n\nnight and once ran past dawn, attracting a surprising number of listeners, most\n\nin altered states (either music-induced or drug-induced, we don’t know which).\n\nTheir phone messages, quite incoherent in content, became excellent sound\n\nmaterial for the radio show. The producer of the show, Jason Brown, has run an\n\nambient program at KCSB for six years, and I am indebted to him for the\n\ninsight he has provided in interviews, personal conversations, and musical\n\ncollaboration.\n\nSince 1996, I have worked as an ambient DJ for the local radio station,\n\nWESU Middletown. I have also been hard at work in the electronic music\n\nstudio at Wesleyan University, composing a number of pieces with samples of\n\ncommercial recordings. The summer of 1996 in California was productive, as I\n\ndiscovered the music of dozens of obscure ambient groups, many of whom I am\n\nwriting about in this thesis. I also made many recordings of ambient sounds,\n\nboth “natural” (insects and frogs) and “industrial” (hums from factories, road\n\nconstruction noises) that will be incorporated into my next phase of\n\ncompositions. I also began codifying the notions of the musical interest I find in\n\nambient spaces, and I began intellectualizing about the unique nature of\n\nambient music in terms of listenership and the listening “technique.” My\n\n© 1997 Eliot Bates\n\n9\n\ninterest in writing this thesis is largely in refining my personal beliefs about the\n\nability of ambient music to communicate through the subconscious; I also have\n\na keen interest in how people perceive music and in how “nonmusical” sounds\n\ncan become “musical.”\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nFirst I would like to thank Mark Slobin, my advisor, who has made this\n\nthesis happen in more ways than I can possibly recount. The intellectual\n\nquestions he posed, the philosophy, popular music, and sociology texts which\n\nhe introduced, and his tact in steering me away from dead-end issues were my\n\ninspiration to pursue ambient music to the end. I also thank three other\n\nWesleyan professors who have given considerable help: Gage Averill, Peter\n\nHoyt, and Ron Kuivila. Professor Hoyt coached me on romantic theory and\n\ntuned me in to the Memoirs of Berlioz, and Professor Kuivila’s course on\n\nrecording raised some difficult questions of copyright, theft, authenticity, and\n\naura.\n\nI am indebted to my mother, Caroline Bates, for the extensive editing\n\nand questioning she did of my first complete draft. Without her insightful\n\ncritique and help on writing style, the ideas I had would have never gotten\n\nacross. She was also always there to hear about some new “discovery” I had\n\nmade (even when my discovery was really old hat). My father, too, offered\n\n© 1997 Eliot Bates\n\n10\n\nsome excellent suggestions, particularly concerning theft (which concerned\n\nhim greatly from a legal standpoint).\n\nIn Santa Barbara, I wish to thank my U.C.S.B. teachers Scott Marcus and\n\nJoann Kuchera-Morin. Professor Marcus, with his courses in Arab music and\n\ntuning systems, opened my ears to non-equal tempered musics. Professor\n\nKuchera-Morin was my primary composition mentor, and with the courses in\n\nelectronic music began my interest in the timbre of sounds. From her I also\n\nlearned all the basics of the recording studio, the physics of acoustics, and most\n\nimportantly how to organize sounds into a coherent piece of music.\n\nAdditionally, thanks go to Jonathan Kessler and Beth Moscov for their help in\n\nlucid dreaming (studying and practicing).\n\nThe summer of 1996 in Santa Barbara was when I began formulating\n\ntheories about ambient music and the potential of the music to invoke images of\n\nlandscapes; it was also when I pondered the attributes of fans which distinguish\n\nthem from pop music fans. Many of these ideas were worked out in\n\nconversations with Alex Donahue and Jason Brown, both whose ideas appear\n\nlater in this thesis in interview format, but who deserve credit for much more.\n\nAdditionally, I acknowledge the Internet community, whose never-ceasing posts\n\nprovide bountiful food for thought, and who made the ethnographic survey\n\npossible.\n\nFinally, I wish to thank Jim Farrington in the music library of Wesleyan,\n\nwho located a number of essential ambient recordings and helped with my\n\ninitial search for articles and books, and the whole staff of the interlibrary loan\n\n© 1997 Eliot Bates\n\n11\n\ndepartment, who endured one hundred and thirty article requests without\n\nflinching. Last but not least are the charming employees of Klekolo’s World\n\nCoffee, who provided me with the hundreds of Aztec Breakfast Blends that\n\nstimulated my creative flow.\n\n© 1997 Eliot Bates\n\n12\n\nPart 1\n\ntrajectories and composers\n\nAmbient music is the product of such a striking collision of music genres\n\nand ideologies that no one mode of analysis is sufficient. These two chapters\n\nprovide two modes of analysis. The first is the trajectory, tracking the evolution\n\nof genres, artists, and fans. The second is the archetype, distinguishing the\n\nmost important affinities that unite composers and listeners. Though I mention\n\na large number of musicians who might not be familiar to the reader, I hope that\n\nthe writing alone is able to convey a sense of the different backgrounds of\n\ncomposers and listeners. Appendix b is a selective discography, both of\n\nambient music and of major recordings in several of the trajectories, and it is\n\nintended to be used in conjunction with a reading of chapters 1 and 2. In the\n\nsecond part of appendix c, the bibliography, are additional readings on select\n\nartists, which offer the reader more detail on the compositional practices and\n\nideologies than was feasible to reprint here.\n\n© 1997 Eliot Bates\n\n13\n\nChapter 1\n\ntrajectories\n\nTo describe the complex musical background of even one ambient artist\n\nwould be impossible. David Toop’s Oceans of Sound connects developments in\n\nambient music with the changing soundscape of the noisy twentieth century\n\nthat has seen hundreds of musical genres come and go. Walking through a\n\nshopping mall, one hears different soundtracks in each store, along with the\n\nsounds of thousands of man-made machines, and in honor of the cacophony\n\nthat fills our day-to-day lives, ambient composers create soundtracks to\n\nimaginary worlds.\n\nTo make some sense of the sources of ambient music, I will profile six\n\n“trajectories,” that originate in an established music scene or a cluster of related\n\nmusicians and travel through musical spaces to arrive at the site of ambient\n\ncomposing and compositions. They show not only the musical origins of key\n\nambient albums, but also the progress of musical sensibilities and affinities\n\nexperienced by composers and fans alike. The trajectories all start in\n\ncountercultural scenes, and though not in all cases, the pre-ambient works are\n\n“programmatic” (they have a subtext, either of political ideology or narrative\n\n© 1997 Eliot Bates\n\n14\n\nmythology) while the ambient derivatives are like the romantic notion of\n\n“absolute music.”2\n\nThe trajectories I propose in this chapter are by no means an exhaustive\n\nset of influences, musical or philosophical, but guide the reader toward\n\nrecognizing key concepts of the ambient belief system: first, that ambient is\n\nmore than a set of musical compositions or musical roots; second, that it has\n\ninnumerable contradictions built into its philosophy and musical structures; and\n\nthird, that it reflects the fragmentation of society into “bedroom cultures,” with\n\nthe values of the music representing the recent interiorization of America and\n\nEurope.\n\nThe first and most important trajectory comes from British industrial\n\nculture in the early to mid-1970’s. Groups such as Throbbing Gristle, Non, SPK,\n\nand Z’ev, and performance artist Mark Pauline experimented with noise, timbre,\n\nshock, occult imagery, and altered states of consciousness while espousing\n\nattitudes on work and isolationism that form the core of current ambient\n\nphilosophy. These artists grew up in the British art school scene of the 1960’s\n\nand 1970’s, where they were exposed to the writings and art of 1950’s “danger\n\nmusicians,” 1930’s futurists, and 1910’s surrealists. Many of the current artists\n\non the labels distributed by World Serpent (Charrm, Staalplaat, Soleilmoon,\n\n2\n\nThis distinction is described by Lydia Goehr in a passage which references Weber and\n\nDahlhaus: “Composers found another resolution [to the dilemma of individual genius versus\n\nspiritual enlightenment] when they began to describe their music either as absolute or as\n\nprogrammatic. Their descriptions rested heavily on the romantic terms that had given\n\ninstrumental music its autonomy.... In both, meaning was achieved through the unique\n\nqualitites of instrumental sound, though whether the music embodied ‘transcendent’ content of\n\n© 1997 Eliot Bates\n\n15\n\nGrey Area of Mute, Cold Meat Industries) are these industrialists, working in\n\nthe similar milieus of industrial and ambient music, while many others are the\n\ngeneration of artists who grew up listening to industrial music.\n\nThe second trajectory describes two individuals who essentially created\n\n“ambient music,” at least as a label for their work. Brian Eno and Robert Fripp\n\nreleased No Pussyfooting in 1972 and collaborated on several other works with\n\ntheir tape loop compositions. Eno went on to gain fame as a record producer\n\n(for U2 and David Bowie) and for his seminal ambient works Ambient 1-4,\n\nApollo, and Music for Films, which texturally inspired most of the subsequent\n\nambient music. Fripp adapted the ambient music work he created with Eno into\n\na one-man show by keeping the same old Revox tape units but performing live\n\nwith his electric guitar. Eno and Fripp are important not just for their albums\n\nbut as cultural icons and as writers able to articulate the philosophy of ambient\n\nmusic.\n\nNew York minimalism is the focus of the third trajectory. Jon Hassell\n\nand Harold Budd were students of Terry Riley and La Monte Young, and amidst\n\nthis scene we see a clear example of ethnic music appropriation in ambient\n\nmusic. All were students of Pandit Pran Nath, the famous North Indian singer,\n\nand, following these studies, Hassell experimented with innovative\n\ncompositional structures based on raga, African drumming, and Malaysian\n\nmusic. I will show that only certain attributes of these musics are of interest to\n\na spiritual, religious, or even a political sort was believed to make all the difference.” (Goehr\n\n1992: 212)\n\n© 1997 Eliot Bates\n\n16\n\nambient composers; particularly, how modality and pitch are conceived of in\n\nambient compositions.\n\nMany of the fans I have interviewed first heard ambient music on the\n\nsyndicated radio show, “Music From the Hearts of Space,” the starting ground\n\nfor the fourth trajectory. Though much of the set list was what is now termed\n\n“space music” or “space rock,” the idea of exploring artificial landscapes was\n\npresent in all the works from the beginning. Two space musicians, Vangelis\n\nand Tangerine Dream, through their immensely popular stadium shows,\n\nreached out to many musicians, particularly in Southern California, where a\n\nnumber of musicians created a space ambient scene.\n\nMany rock groups from the late 1960’s on experimented with different\n\nways of interacting with their audience, and the result was the breakdown of the\n\nrock band and a new set of sensibilities about timbre and instrumentation. Less\n\nof a scene than a general “way of thinking,” the fifth trajectory looks at bands in\n\nthree countries that inspired a new set of instrumental hierarchies, moving away\n\nfrom traditional melodic or rhythmic patterns. Some of these groups produced\n\nambient albums, too, though their main impact was to change the way people\n\nheard music.\n\nThe final trajectory, and the most contentious among fans with different\n\nmusical preferences, is the club music scene, where the deconstruction of\n\ntechno and acid house became the soundtrack of the chill-out room (an\n\nexclusive listening space for ambient music). Some artists, such as Richard\n\nJames, have crossed the lines between trip-hop and ambient and work\n\n© 1997 Eliot Bates\n\n17\n\ncomfortably as producers and DJ’s in both genres. Some of the first techno\n\nmusicians were also among the first industrial musicians, complicating the web\n\nof connections even more.\n\nAfter the six trajectories I give a brief analysis of ambient in relation to\n\nthe seminal articles of Walter Benjamin (“The Work of Art in the Age of\n\nMechanical Reproduction”) and Theodor Adorno (“On the Fetish Character of\n\nMusic and the Regression of Listening”). Sarah Thornton offers an alternative\n\nview of “authenticity and the recording,” and following this appraisal are\n\nexamples of how the issue has become muddled with the evolution of recording\n\nstudio and artist relationships, the change of the DJ’s role, and characteristics of\n\nambient music listening and consuming. The last two issues, which I only\n\nbriefly touch upon, are the packaging of ambient CD’s (which come wrapped in\n\nmodern art) and the possibility of considering many of ambient music’s unique\n\nfeatures in Deluzian, rather than post-Weberian, terms.\n\n1st Trajectory -- Industrial Culture\n\n“Industrial Culture” spawned probably the most significant trajectory in\n\nthe formation of ambient. The oxymoronic label perfectly captures the mixture\n\nof feelings for and against increased industrialization in England, reflecting the\n\nanxiety many youth felt about the perceived efforts of the government to\n\npromote longer work days, change the focus of schools from a liberal education\n\n© 1997 Eliot Bates\n\n18\n\nto vocational training, and alienate people from each other. These misgivings\n\nwere infused with the philosophical treatises of Nietzsche, Baudrillard, Sartre,\n\nand others. Contrary to much of the pop press coverage of the industrial\n\n“movement,” it was not simply about making music with power tools and\n\ndistorted amplification; rather, it was a highly intellectual, planned, and wideranging movement that embodied performance media of many forms,\n\nprovocative videos, body art and literature. Though warehouses were a popular\n\nvenue for performances, art schools, concert halls, and commercial television\n\nwere also used as spaces for industrial art. This section will focus on the lives of\n\nseveral prominent industrial artists, several of whom went on to be founders of\n\nthe ambient music scene, and show which philosophical tenets of the industrial\n\nmovement were transferred to the ambient movement, and which were not.\n\nAs early as 1969, the group Coum Transmissions were performing their\n\nsonic experiments in British art schools. Along with Rhythm and Noise,\n\nanother art school group, they represented the initial forays into noise\n\nexploration. By 1976, Throbbing Gristle had emerged as the band-structured\n\nincarnation of Coum Transmissions, and the performances had expanded from\n\nthe guitar noise and percussion experiments of the early 1970’s into a highly\n\nprovocative performance art group that would routinely cause physical harm to\n\nthe musicians -- and the audience. It was probably through these performances\n\nthat the underground scenes of bondage, body scarification, body piercing, and\n\nother practices that today are part of the “modern primitive” way of life were\n\n© 1997 Eliot Bates\n\n19\n\nexposed to the world. Although the bands didn’t invent any of these forms of\n\nshock treatment, their extensive research in forensic pathology, the occult\n\ntraditions of cultures past, tomes of mental illnesses, and the psychology of such\n\ndisparate figures as Charles Manson and Adolph Hitler, and their treatment of\n\nsuch subjects in performance art gave fuel to the modern primitives and the\n\nskinheads.\n\nSuch images and performance manners were not completely new to\n\nindustrial music; in fact, much of the imagery and performance mannerisms\n\nresemble events during the futurist art movement (1910-1930) and the beat\n\ngeneration and the danger music scenes of the 1950’s. The reason for the\n\nresurgence of ideas in the early 1970’s is fairly clear: The 1970’s industrialists\n\nwere taking classes with the 1950’s beat artists, who in turn had been inspired\n\nby futurist manifestos such as those of Luigi Russolo, or the canonized works of\n\nLèger and other French surrealists. A common subtext of industrial music is\n\nthe dehumanization of mankind as people begin to emulate the machines and\n\nfactories they create, as depicted in 1928 with the vivid images of the popular\n\ncult film Ballet Mècanique.3 It is likely that such films were shown in art school\n\nclasses. Industrial artist references to cut-up art and non-intentionality can\n\nsurely be traced back at least that far.\n\n3\n\nThe name “industrial” was not an accidental label for this genre. In keeping with the\n\nphilosophy of Lèger, the performance artist Monte Cazzazza coined the term “Industrial Music\n\nfor Industrial People” in 1976, suggesting a group of people who had become aware of their\n\ninteraction with the industrialized world. (Juno and Vale 1983)\n\n© 1997 Eliot Bates\n\n20\n\nThe importance of the art school education on the industrialists has\n\nreceived little attention from the music press, even in such sophisticated\n\nmonographs as the Industrial Culture Handbook. But if the anecdotes Simon\n\nFrith describes in his Art Into Pop about the classes of Gustav Metzger (one\n\nclass on electric bass disassembly during performance; others on autodestructive art) are any indication of what these artists were exposed to, it\n\nseems to be a natural progression from classroom to performance space. The\n\nimage of industrial musicians is different from that of pop musicians because of\n\nthe emphasis on philosophical and intellectual art,and there is evidence of this\n\nin the large amount of space the Industrial Culture Handbook devotes to the\n\nlibraries of artists, and their interpretations of major philisophical tomes.\n\nSeveral of the artists on the Sub Rosa label released a two-CD tribute album to\n\nthe French philosopher Gilles Deleuze, citing his concept of rhizomes (from his\n\nbook Mille Plateaux) as the premise of the recording studio concept of the\n\nremix.4\n\nGenesis P-Orridge, a constant member of Throbbing Gristle and later\n\none of the founders of the acid house and other dance music scenes, is an\n\nexcellent example of the industrial philosopher. Although his bibliography is\n\nfilled with heavy writings of many European anthropologists, fascist scholars,\n\n4\n\nDeleuze’s work Mille Plateaux devotes considerable space to the development of the\n\nrhizome and the desiring machine. For a brief description, I cite the popular Deleuze primer of\n\nAchim Szepanski. “Their movements [streams of desires] - linking, coupling, are defined\n\nthrough forces that repeatedly construct new networks. The rhizome is such a labyrinth, a rich\n\nensemble of relations; diversity, connection and heterogeneity, breaks and unexpected links.\n\nThey show the vision of a life that opens the ways of production of subjectivity to art, and allows\n\n© 1997 Eliot Bates\n\n21\n\nsocial darwinists, and existentialists, his specialty is the occult, and he reserves\n\nhis highest praise for the writings of Alistair Crowley, from whom he gained\n\ninspiration for his work with conspiracy theories and personal spiritual life. In\n\nan interview in the Industrial Culture Handbook,\n\nInterviewer:\n\nYou place extremely high value on work -- don’t you work all the time?\n\nGenesis:\n\nYes. But then you get somebody like Crowley -- who wrote all those\n\nbloody books! And he goes mountaineering, and has lots of sex; he does paintings, he\n\ntravels, he does magazines, he gets books published as well as writing them, he\n\norganizes magickal societies, he has political in-fighting going on, he’s drugging it -how the hell did he do it all? (Juno and Vale 1983: 15)\n\nIn the same interview, Genesis shows pure contempt for the music press, who\n\nuse the word “industrial” merely to mean noisy music, in ignorance of the\n\noriginal basis of the movement. In describing Throbbing Gristle’s departure\n\nfrom the performances of the parent group Coum Transmissions, Genesis says\n\nNow we’re going to try and do that [performance art] with a sort of philosophical,\n\nmystical magick, so non-dogmatic and non-authoritative -- people who’ve been brought\n\nup to despise anything that smacks of “religion” -- maybe we can remind them that\n\nthere are useful structures; that spiritual values aren’t necessarily to be despised or\n\nridiculed. (ibid.., 16)\n\nAnother mistake the music industry makes is to assume that industrial music is\n\nmerely another pop-like tradition. All the interviewees in this excellent book\n\nsay that except for rare collaborative performances, all the artists lived and\n\nworked in complete isolation from other people and particularly from the music\n\nworld. It was not a “fun social activity” in the manner of a garage band, and\n\nthe horizon of resistance to light up.” (Achim Szepanski, quoted from his Gilles Deleuze\n\n© 1997 Eliot Bates\n\n22\n\nthere were no post-concert parties, press functions, or hordes of adoring fans. A\n\ngreat deal of personal risk was involved in the performances and the way of life,\n\nto some degree from the drug use that occasionally accompanied performances\n\n(though most of the artists I am highlighting despised addicts and junkies). But\n\nthere were far greater risks in the way industrial musicians acquired\n\ninstruments (theft of metal parts from factories); in the dangers to themselves\n\nand the audience as they performed with flame-throwers, dart guns, and vile\n\nliquid substances; and in the potential for arrest for the production of videos\n\ncontaining material of an offensive nature. For unknown reasons, Genesis is in\n\nexile in America, unable to return to Britain.\n\nTo summarize the original philosophical motives for the “industrial\n\nmovement,” Genesis writes:\n\nAll of us were working before it became “industrial,’ and discovered each other and\n\nrecognized that kindred spirit, that driving force, and that’s what made us all, if you like,\n\n“industrial culture.” It’s just that we wanted to have some kind of alliance, because we\n\nfelt like we were all a kind of outlaw -- but we all had some basic motivation and drive in\n\ncommon... it didn’t even matter whether we thought each other was good -- that had\n\nnothing to do with it... What was interesting was the people involved.... and that we’d\n\narrived at the same alienated, cynical point, and somehow found a way, a method to\n\nrationalize it and integrate it back. (ibid., 16)\n\nAn American musician, Z’ev, made considerable contributions to\n\nindustrial and ambient philosophies. In the late 1970’s, he gained worldwide\n\nrenown for his fifteen-minute-long performances of intense drumming, that\n\nwere often amplified to the threshold of pain. His interview in the Industrial\n\nCulture Handbook succintly describes many of the main beliefs of the industrial\n\nInternet homepage)\n\n© 1997 Eliot Bates\n\n23\n\nmovement, particularly concerning the noise-producing sound sources, risk,\n\nand the links between industrial music and “primitive” cultures.\n\nI’ve always been very committed to low-tech as opposed to high-tech! In Europe, a lot\n\nof bands are starting to use metals in percussion, to get a richness and variety of texture\n\nand timbre that one would normally go to a synthesizer for. Whereas in America\n\nthere’s still this concept in people’s heads that a $5000 synthesizer is going to make\n\nthem a better musician. (ibid., 109)\n\nZ’ev performs under many stage names and stage personae, though there is a\n\ncommon link between all his performances:\n\nThe real crux of it all is -- it’s all coming from this basis of poetry. Various levels of\n\npoetry and various levels of language. Poetry encompasses all these levels, in terms of\n\nthe occult situation, in terms of the cabalistic situation, in terms of the more ritual\n\naspect of Z’ev, in terms of the language-and-sound aspect of Uns, and in terms of\n\nMagneet Bond -- more celestial, and Element L -- more elemental, having to do with\n\ntape processes. (ibid., 111)\n\nIn talking about the difference between his performances and those of\n\nmainstream rock ’n’ roll,\n\nA general rock ’n’ roll performance is a social structure that is thrust upon people,\n\nwhere the music is only a part, a soundtrack for an experience that the people know\n\neverything about in advance.... whereas the Z’ev performance, at the sound level, deals\n\nwith an evocative, experimental mode in the listener -- the person listens and it gives\n\nhim food for thought -- ideally. There’s a tremendous amount of calligraphic language\n\nin the instruments themselves. If you closed your ears and just watched it, there is a\n\nlanguage almost like puppeteers’ -- whole sagas and dramas get played out... (ibid.)\n\nZ’ev states that he has studied ethnomusicology, particularly African and\n\nHaitian drumming traditions, though his meaning of the study is more in\n\ncontext with acquiring new motives for his performance than with the\n\nanthropological study of a people.\n\n© 1997 Eliot Bates\n\n24\n\nIn the summer of ‘80 I was working with a Haitian man, and learned quite a bit from\n\nhim toward understanding the Caribbean systems of voodoo drumming.... I’ve used it\n\nsubliminally, but I haven’t really dealt with it that much overtly because... it’s difficult to\n\ndo, to keep the concentration. Because if you call an energy down, you have to be able\n\nto deal with it. And if you’re doing shows night after night, for example, you have to be\n\nvery centered, otherwise the energy will not leave. And so I’d walk off stage and I\n\nwould not be me anymore. (ibid., 113)\n\nOther points that come up in the interviews include his interest in the\n\nsoundtracks of movies (particularly horror films), where he points out the\n\nimportance of the sounds in invoking reactions in the viewer. Z’ev, in addition\n\nto continuing his intense drumming performances, composed the soundtracks\n\nto many cult films, consisting of many layers of recorded conversations and\n\nabstract spoken word sound sources.\n\nTo give a fuller sense of the sort of scene in which these artists were\n\nworking, I will describe some of the other industrial performance art traditions\n\nthat surfaced in the late 1970’s. Mark Pauline was seminal to the scene,\n\nbecause his performances with complex destructive robots -- widely televised in\n\nCalifornia -- had ambient soundtracks (made by the group Factrix), and dealt\n\ndirectly with the psychological terror of automation and the progress of the\n\nindustrial era. Through the years his prodigious technological abilities resulted\n\nin robots with a complex range of possible motions, and more lethal weapons\n\n(such as real-life rocket launchers and flame throwers), creating a riskier\n\nspectacle. He also experimented with imbedding these robots in dead animals,\n\nor parts of animals, so that it appeared to the audience as though a robotized\n\n© 1997 Eliot Bates\n\n25\n\nrabbit was breathing a fifteen foot plume of fire. All the performances were onetime-only affairs, as the robots’ sole mission was to destroy one another, and\n\neach was put in some sort of “predicament” guaranteeing their destruction at\n\nthe whim of another robot. All the robots were dead by the end of the\n\nperformance. Pauline was using the welding torch to illuminate his vision of\n\nmodern industrial era mankind -- the robots were a metaphor for people\n\nhellbent on self-destruction.\n\nOther industrial groups included SPK (an acronym for the Socialist\n\nPatients Kollektiv5), an Australian (later British) band that created some\n\ninfamous videos and shocked audiences with revolting performances.6\n\nHowever, they preached a doctrine of non-violence and defended the portrayal\n\nof strange medical images in their films as a documentary exploration of\n\ncommon phenomena to which people have unnatural resistances.\n\nBoyd Rice was the man behind the Non performances, that created a\n\ngreat deal of noise from a small amount of equipment. Apart from the hall\n\nspeakers and P.A. system, Rice could carry all the equipment he needed in a\n\nsmall bucket. He was not interested in having the audience see him, so he\n\nwould walk onstage to create the sound sculptures and then leave the premises\n\nuntil he felt the performance was over. As a recording artist, he did many\n\nexperiments with modified LP’s, producing ones with loop grooves and others\n\n5\n\nThe Socialist Patients Kollektiv was a West German group of mental patients who\n\nmobilized into a terrorist unit, only to blow themselves up while manufacturing bombs.\n\n6\n\nPerformances comprised of bizarre sex acts such as scatology, and ritual laceration and\n\nbody mutilations.\n\n© 1997 Eliot Bates\n\n26\n\nwith two to four holes in the center (so the consumer could get four recordings\n\nout of the same disc).\n\nMark Pauline, Boyd Rice, and the members of SPK echoed much of the\n\nsame ideology as Z’ev and Genesis P-Orridge: They believed they were\n\ncreating sonic poetry with their performances; they shunned press and popular\n\nacceptance and were much more interested in creating sounds and spaces they\n\nliked to be in; they had a strong work ethic and lived their art; and they were\n\nwell read in philosophy and literature and adept at describing exactly what they\n\ndid and why they did it. Risk was one of the main features of their\n\nperformances (all have been quite seriously injured). Each artist had certain\n\n“specialties” of knowledge, ranging from the troop training tactics of the SS and\n\npsychological treatises on Hitler to forensic pathology, mental “illnesses,” or\n\nbeat poetry, which may seem unrelated to their art but that were central to the\n\nmindset of their creative work.\n\nIn the early 1980’s there was no longer a venue for the types of music\n\nand visual arts described above. Changes in popular music scene also helped\n\nalong industial music’s decline. Although industrial was not a “popular music”\n\nper se (it sold very few records and supported only a handful of artists), the\n\nmusicians were aware of other underground scenes and responsed to the\n\nemerging punk scenes in England and California. Punk was, to the industrial\n\nartists, a coyly marketed rock ‘n’ roll, fiercely determined to be commercial and\n\naboveground in every sense. The image of punk was more important than the\n\nmusic itself -- the fashionability of stage performances, the look of the records,\n\n© 1997 Eliot Bates\n\n27\n\nand the look of the audience was the performance.7 Skinhead culture was also\n\ndeveloping, and if it began as a statement about the conditions of life inherited\n\nby intelligent British youth, it evolved quickly into a violent (and fashionable)\n\ngroup. Many of the industrial artists I profile were “skinheads” in the early\n\nsense, but fell out of fashion as they dedicated their life to their art, not their\n\nimage, and shunned the violence that punk music inspired.\n\nIn the early 1980’s, the music industry picked up on the potential market\n\nfor “industrial” music, possibly because of fragmentation among the fan base of\n\nheavy metal music. Groups like Metallica and Iron Maiden had consistently\n\ngood concert returns, but the rising costs of producing the elaborate stage\n\nshows that formed the focal point of groups like Stryper, Def Lepard, and Poison\n\nwere making two-musician units like Ministry and the less visually oriented\n\nSkinny Puppy and Front 242 a more profitable return. This new “industrial”\n\nmusic, though noisy, was not based on the philosophy of the original\n\nmovement; it was Just Another Pop Music Genre distinguished by an album\n\ncover look, specific equipment on stage, and angrier lyrics. Also, with the\n\nsteady increase of volume, anger, and noise in the genres of metal, speed metal,\n\nand the new “industrial” music, the initial shock value that allowed groups like\n\nThrobbing Gristle to get a “message” across was lost, and many of the early\n\n7\n\nSimon Frith relates the fashion cult of punk to the fashion wars between the mods and\n\nthe teds, two British style cults from the 1950’s and 1960’s. (Frith 1987)\n\n© 1997 Eliot Bates\n\n28\n\nindustrial artists moved into studying the potential of subliminal messages in\n\nmusic.8\n\nEx-Throbbing Gristle members Chris Carter and Cosey Fanni Tutti\n\nbecame involved with the discotheque as well, creating noise-based music that\n\nwas danceable. The albums Trance (1982) and Exotica (1989) are two of their\n\nmost famous, and were released during tours of the U.S. and Europe. In\n\naddition, the work of the post-industrial group Psychic TV and Genesis POrridge’s DJ’ing in America anticipated the Detroit techno, house, and acid\n\nhouse music scenes.9 Other artists who are now grouped as ambient\n\ncomposers began their musical careers working with these eclectic DJ’s, and\n\ninclude Stephen Stapleton (the composer of all the music of Nurse With\n\nWound) and John Balance (of Psychic TV), who teamed up with Peter\n\n“Sleazey” Christopherson (of Throbbing Gristle) to form the group Coil. Nurse\n\nWith Wound’s main venue has been the recording and the club, and Stapleton\n\nhas released about thirty recordings. Coil produced most of their music as film\n\nsoundtracks, from short cult films to full features, releasing albums of remixes\n\nof the film scores.10 An interesting community has developed among these\n\n8\n\nThe cult of Modern Primitivism, or the branch of industrial ideology that focused on\n\nbody modification, piercing, S&M, and other things which had been previously associated with\n\n“primitive” as opposed to “developed” society, became pop as well, a considerable\n\ndisappointment to the major players in the underground movement who were specifically trying\n\nnot to be imitated or fashionable.\n\n9\n\nThe same evolution that commercialized the industrial genre beset the club music\n\nscene, which started as a subversive, intellectual medium but was reduced to a sell-out.\n\n10\n\nCoil became widely known in the club music scene for a music video they created\n\nwhich began with the grotesque image of flies getting stuck in a vat of honey, and ended with\n\n© 1997 Eliot Bates\n\n29\n\nmusicians, who had previously worked in isolation creating industrial music, but\n\nwho now collaborate on remixes of each others ambient works. Now we find\n\nNurse With Wound albums remixed by Current 93, Coil songs produced by\n\nStapelton in collaboration with Psychic TV, and so on. The Sub Rosa\n\ncompilation Double Articulation uses the Deleuzian concept of the rhizome to\n\nexplain why all the songs are remixes (and the remixes were done by\n\ncomposers of other songs on the CD), and how this symbolizes an enactment of\n\na lateral system of working (rather than a top-down hierarchy). Whether the\n\ncompositions are tree-like or rhizomatic, it’s become quite hard to determine\n\nthe authorship of pieces or recognize the work of individual ambient composers\n\nwith the interchange that now takes place.\n\nAt this point I will summarize some of the ways in which industrial\n\nmusical metamorphosed into the work of many ambient composers. There is\n\nlittle difference between the sorts of sounds one hears on industrial or ambient\n\nmusic recordings. Both genres explore noise-based timbres and shy away from\n\nthe prepackaged sounds of conventional keyboards and guitars.11 However, the\n\npowerful images of a rock star who was dying of the AIDS virus. This video is now part of the\n\npermanent collection of the Museum Of Modern Art in New York.\n\n11\n\nThe Oxford Dictionary of Music defines “timbre” as “Tone-colour; that which\n\ndistinguishes the quality of tone or voice of one instrument or singer from another.” (Kennedy\n\n1985). This is inadequate for describing industrial sounds which aren’t produced by\n\ninstruments, or that don’t have discernable pitches (tones). I define timbre as the “Spectral\n\ncharacteristic of a sound,” and conceive of it as the aural equivalent of a fingerprint. A\n\nfingerprint is a unique, complex combination of simple lines -- a timbre is a unique, complex\n\ncombination of simple sine waves.\n\n© 1997 Eliot Bates\n\n30\n\nshock component of industrial performances meant that there was a greater\n\nrange of volume than in modern ambient pieces.\n\nTheft was a practiced doctrine of industrial culture. Mark Pauline\n\nrecounts memories of organized raids on IBM and other large multinational\n\nfactories as part of the creative process of his works: The feeling was that the\n\nanti-factory works should somehow exist outside the conventional channels of\n\ncapital flow, that the theft of scrap materials gave more credibility to the\n\nmessage. Z’ev mentioned in one interview:\n\nThe thievery has to do with -- basically, Mercury on one level is the god of learning and\n\ncommunication, and on the other level is the god of thieves! The thievery is more of an\n\noccult situation, even though thievery is a political act on a certain level -- it’s shaped by\n\ncertain socio-economic inequalities. You know, taking from those who have, who can\n\nafford it and don’t give it... the thefts that I did, say in 1980, were done as rituals....\n\nThere’s another level of working with the thievery, which has to do with the very big\n\npremium I put on risk in the production of works. So I feel that at the very basic\n\nbeginning of the process, which means the accumulations of the material which are\n\nthen going to get formed into instruments which are then going to get used in a\n\nperformance -- since the risk is such a big part in the performance aspect, I try to keep it\n\nconsistent throughout the process! (ibid., 109-111)\n\nContrast this with pop genres where bands purchase the fad equipment\n\npromoted by mass-media advertising. I have not read specific accounts of\n\nambient composers and material theft, but the principle of stepping beyond the\n\nnormal channels of capital flow is very much an institutionalized practice in\n\nregards to the appropriation of restricted or commercial recordings. In chapter\n\n5 I will discuss this theft further.\n\nTwo other principles of industrial music are risk and subversion. In the\n\ncontext of 1970’s performances, there were obvious risks to the musicians, who\n\noften practiced extreme realizations of the auto-destructive art preached by\n\n© 1997 Eliot Bates\n\n31\n\nMetzger. Most performances involved some sort of physical injury, accidental\n\nand deliberate, to performers and audience alike; those that didn’t often\n\nsuggested the possibility of such risk. Subversion came in the messages passed\n\nto the audience, particularly at moments immediately following some shock or\n\ntrauma when the psyche is most susceptible to subliminal messages. There\n\nwere many targets of subversion: Some industrial artists in San Francisco tried\n\nto create documentary films for elementary schools that included brief flashes\n\nof images that amounted to a rejection of the values the teachers were\n\nespousing, and some films did briefly circulate.\n\nAs industrial art was performative, many of the risks were physical;\n\nambient music exists in the recording studio, so the only risks to the listener\n\nare psychological. Fans are aware that groups like Coil put subliminal\n\nmessages in their songs. Ambient maintains the power to suggest in its\n\napplication to film scoring. Coil’s music is well suited as a soundtrack to horror\n\nfilms. If the reader doesn’t believe in the suggestible power of the music, they\n\nshould watch Hellraiser II with the sound turned off and compare the level of\n\nfright to the sensations when the volume is on high. Without the soundtrack\n\nthe movie could easily be a comedy. By itself the soundtrack (that can be found\n\nin remixed form on the album Unnatural History vol. II) is stimulating enough\n\nto inspire odd and disturbing emotions.\n\nAlthough I have briefly mentioned lack of intentionality, I want to stress\n\nthat the composers of ambient and industrial music, as well as some avant-garde\n\nmusical forms, strive to remove their egos from their works. Origins of this\n\n© 1997 Eliot Bates\n\n32\n\nidea are generally credited to John Cage, though they appear earlier in the\n\nphilosophy of Dada. Cage also appropriated Zen philosophy, which advocates\n\nstripping away layers of ego in the practice of visual arts. It is likely a derivative\n\nof these influences that inspired Brian Eno to pursue process composition (as\n\nopposed to product composition) and self-generative art in his installations and\n\nalbums. Industrialists describe similar beliefs; this is no surprise as they and\n\nEno were all in art school at about the same time. I talk more in chapter 4 about\n\ntwo issues that arise from the egoless compositions: the lack of intense\n\nidolization and iconography of the composers, and the use of the CD as a useful\n\ncommodity rather than as a recreational product or merely a marker of cultural\n\ncapital.\n\nWhen it comes to hard work and prolificacy, ambient composers are the\n\nequals of the industrialists. Coil, in just five years, released sixteen full-length\n\nand double-length albums, plus compilations and singles; Chris and Cosey put\n\nout twenty-three works, Psychic TV forty-six albums, and Current 93 at least\n\nfifty-nine recordings. All the artists in these groups have collaborated on many\n\ncompilations and albums of other groups, and create in ambient and nonambient contexts. A large school of composers who inhabit the twenty-three\n\nlabel collective distributed by World Serpent (particularly labels such as\n\nSoleilmoon, Staalplaat, and Touch), and who were influenced by the works of\n\nThrobbing Gristle and other early industrial artists, have produced similar\n\nquantities of ambient music. Compare this to the two- and three-album\n\n© 1997 Eliot Bates\n\n33\n\ncontributions of thousands of briefly famous pop musicians, and one sees that\n\nthere is a fundamentally different mindset at work.\n\nTrajectory 2 -- Brian Eno and Robert Fripp\n\nThere is quite a lot in common between the process composition of Brian\n\nEno and the industrial culture movement. Eno received a similar art education\n\nto the industrialists in his years of apprenticeship with Roy Ascott at Ipswitch,\n\nand was exposed to minimalist music, the ideas of Russolo and Cage, and the\n\nmusic of the Velvet Underground while in art school. However, Eno took his\n\nintellectual study into the studio, not the performance space, and became a\n\npioneer of many studio recording techniques.\n\nEno is a contradictory personality in the ambient music community.\n\nThough his music is apparently not about commercialism (the credo of the\n\nindustrialists), he is a financially successful artist. He claims he is not a\n\nmusician, but as a non-musician he composed some famous rock songs and\n\nbegan the entire musical movement of ambient (with the 1972 album No\n\nPussyfooting). Despite his claim that he can’t play any musical instruments, he is\n\none of the best known keyboard players in rock ‘n ‘ roll, from his acclaim with\n\nBrian Ferry and Roxy Music. Many magazines point out the lack of commercial\n\nsuccess of his albums (none have gone gold), but when one compares six-digit\n\nsales of twenty albums to the success of a pop band with one platinum release,\n\nor to prolific ambient artists who never sell more than four thousand copies of\n\n© 1997 Eliot Bates\n\n34\n\nany one, he is one of the most commercially successful artists in any genre.\n\nWhether one considers his album sales or his fame as the producer of U2 and\n\nDavid Bowie (on two of the top ten selling albums of all time), his reputation\n\nwas sufficient to win a commission from Microsoft to write a 3 3/4 second jingle\n\nfor the Windows 95 computer operating system, for the grand sum of $400,000.\n\nEno is credited with inventing ambient music, but the first album\n\ndescribed as such was a collaboration with Robert Fripp, who provided the\n\nprimary harmonic, melodic, rhythmic, and timbral material. On No Pussyfooting,\n\nEno experimented with a tape loop process that is analyzed in detail in chapter\n\n5. The input into the equation was Robert Fripp’s Gibson guitar sound, a sound\n\nfamiliar to fans of his renowned progressive rock act, King Crimson. Though\n\nFripp didn’t bring production techniques or an art school background to the\n\nambient music scene, he did bring the sensibility of a successful virtuoso art\n\nrocker, and from 1972 until the late 1980’s he worked with a highly stylized\n\nguitar sound he called “skysaw guitar.” In the same way that Jimi Hendrix’s\n\nguitar sound was the sound of psychedelia, or Kurt Cobain’s voice the sound of\n\ngrunge and alternative rock angst, in the early 1970’s at least, Fripp’s guitar\n\nsound was the sound of ambient.\n\nThough Fripp is one of the few early British ambient artists who was not\n\nconnected to the art school system, he is an intellectual musician and a prolific\n\nwriter for eclectic music magazines. His writings echo the sentiments of the\n\nambient artists described in this thesis and are the best expression of the\n\nphilosophy of ambient music composing.\n\n© 1997 Eliot Bates\n\n35\n\nMuch can be written about both Fripp and Eno, and much has been in\n\ntheir biographies, magazine articles, interviews, and reviews. In chapter 2 I\n\nprofile both artists in greater depth, and all chapters of the thesis reference to\n\ntheir ideas and compositions. In addition these profiles, the bibliography has a\n\nselected list of articles for readers who want more information on Eno and\n\nFripp.\n\n3rd trajectory -- New York Minimalism\n\nOften when people ask about what ambient music sounds like, they\n\nwonder if the music of Philip Glass or Steve Reich is ambient. There is no\n\nconclusive answer: To some fans it is, and to some it isn’t. Both Glass and\n\nReich, with their colleagues La Monte Young, Terry Riley, Frederic Rzewski,\n\nPauline Oliveros, and Merideth Monk, are generally considered to be\n\n“minimalist” composers. However, when one analyzes the real meaning of\n\nOliveros’ concept of “deep listening,” it is fundamentally similiar to the ambient\n\nlistening practices I discuss in chapter 4.\n\nThe sacred history of the ambient genre places the history of minimalism\n\nin response to the 12-tone and serial academic composition of the 1950’s and\n\n1960’s, citing a marked transformation from music that went somewhere to\n\nmusic that was static. Some early works of anti-academic music were “Come\n\nOut” or “Piano Phase.” However, it is hard to think of Terry Riley’s and La\n\nMonte Young’s years of experimentation with intonation systems as a response\n\n© 1997 Eliot Bates\n\n36\n\nto anything other than the general meek acceptance of equal temperament. In\n\nRiley’s words, “We were both going in this direction -- immersing yourself\n\ninside the tone, so that the tone becomes everything.” (Woodard 1997: 70)\n\nSteve Reich, too, abandoned his original protest motivation when his music\n\ngained popularity on its own terms and moved to writing structured pieces such\n\nas “Different Trains” and “Desert Music,” that have since assumed an important\n\nplace in the canon of western classical music.12\n\nThese two pieces have been cited as favorite “ambient works” by many\n\nfans on the Internet (the Internet fan base of ambient music is discussed in\n\nchapter 3). Drawing lines between the two genres is difficult by purely musical\n\ndistinctions though pieces like these stand apart from ambient in that they\n\nrequire a large number of live performers. But a great deal of minimalist music\n\nis electronic, and Phillip Glass has admitted that many of his works could be\n\nperformed quite well by a computer. Minimalist pieces often have an\n\naccompanying tape track that consists of sounds and synthesis techniques used\n\nevery day in ambient music production. In analysis, the only real empirical\n\ndifference between ambient and minimalism is in the space of representation:\n\nThe performance venues of minimalist music are concert halls, while ambient is\n\na studio-recorded genre. Minimalism, at least to some degree, is about\n\nacceptance as a high-art genre, which is not a concern of most ambient\n\ncomposers.\n\n12\n\nIt is ironic that minimalist compositions, with the pretenses of being anti-academic, are\n\nnow introduced to composition students all over the U.S. as good studies for percussion writing\n\n© 1997 Eliot Bates\n\n37\n\nOnce we get past the issue of differentiation, we can see how minimalism\n\nhas contributed musics and ideas to the ambient belief system, including\n\nelements of Indian music. The history begins with La Monte Young, who was\n\nresponsible for bringing the esteemed Pandit Pran Nath to New York. In the\n\nmany years that Pran Nath lived in New York with Young and Riley, they and\n\nJon Hassell studied his rich North Indian vocal tradition, and each composer\n\napplied the formal Indian music discipline to his own work. Young recently\n\nformed a blues band that performs three hour-long blues songs structured more\n\nlike an Indian raga than a traditional delta blues number. Riley was interested in\n\nthe intonation and the modes and created pastiches of raga on his RCA\n\nsynthesizer. Describing his famous work, “in C,” Riley uses imagery similar to\n\nwhat we would expect from Eno.\n\nIt’s almost like fractals... if you take the same shape and repeat it many times and then\n\nyou stick them together, they create a vibratory space. That was my big fascination -this vibratory body that happened with patterns interacting. It was kind of like what\n\nEscher was introducing in the visual arts or the OP artists were doing in the ‘60s. It was\n\nabout creating a kinetic music. (Woodard 1997: 70)\n\nJon Hassell, too, adapted Indian raga and ornamentation on his jazz\n\ntrumpet. It is through Hassell, Riley, and Young that ambient music\n\n“discovered” Indian music, and if we look at the influence of Indian music on the\n\nopus of ambient works it is apparent that only a few facets of Indian music were\n\nof interest. Hassell’s first ambient album, Vernal Equinox, has a sruti drone on\n\nalmost every song, and he explores the timbre of the drone in later albums\n\nand rhythmic structures.\n\n© 1997 Eliot Bates\n\n38\n\n(Music from the Fourth World Vol. I and II). His trumpet solos, which appear on\n\nmany ambient albums, are loosely based on the pitches of several raga-s\n\n(particularly Darbari), but do not have the same structure or goal; their limited\n\npitch range makes them sound like a alap (unmetered improvisation) with\n\nstunted growth. Tala (rhythmic meter) is not important to ambient music,\n\nwhich shuns beat, and the occasional instance of a tabla will be just as a timbre\n\nor an “ethnic touch.”\n\nAnother minimalist inspired composer, Harold Budd, has collaborated\n\nwith Brian Eno on several well-known albums and released many of his own. A\n\npianist, he took the sedate aesthetic of some of La Monte Young’s piano works\n\nand adapted it to a four-minute song format. His works are the shortest ambient\n\ncompositions, eliciting some criticism for being repackaged new age pieces.\n\nBudd figured in the New York scene before the Indian influence, playing piano\n\noccasionally with Young (at that time a famous saxophonist) and Hassell (a\n\ntrumpeter) in a free jazz group, though his later compositions show few jazz\n\nsensibilities and deal with modal regions like those Eno used on his first\n\nrealization of Discrete Music.\n\n4th trajectory -- space music\n\nFor many a youth growing up near college towns, the first exposure to\n\nambient music came from the syndicated radio show “Music from the Hearts of\n\nSpace.” Here one could tune in and “chill out” once a week: in Santa Barbara,\n\n© 1997 Eliot Bates\n\n39\n\nwhere I lived, it was broadcast at the ideal time of Sunday night, bringing a\n\nsmall refuge of inner calm to the start of another school or work week. Much of\n\nthe music played is now thought of as “space music,” not “ambient,” though\n\nprograms often included works of Brian Eno, Jon Hassell, David Sylvian, and\n\nmany other ambient artists. What this show did was connect the electronic\n\nkeyboard and synthesized sounds of Vangelis, Tangerine Dream, and JeanMichel Jarre to the branch of ambient music by composers like Michael\n\nStearns, Robert Rich, Steve Roach, Michael Shrieve, and Michael Brook.\n\nThe sonic landscapes of early space music13 were centered around a few\n\npopular but expensive synthesizers, most notably the RCA Mark II,14 the Bukla,\n\nand the Moog. The main synthesis engines in these units were amplitude and\n\nfrequency modulation, which meant that banks of oscillators were daisy chained\n\nto create “complex” combinations of “simple” sine waves. In some instances the\n\nsame operations could be applied to an external input, a primitive form of\n\nsampling and sound manipulation. More important than the technical specifics\n\nis how the composers used these units.\n\nVangelis is undoubtedly the most celebrated space musician, though his\n\nmost famous song, “Chariots of Fire,” is much more neo-classical than spacey.\n\nIn all his 1970’s and early 1980’s work he paired up electronic and acoustic\n\nsounds, treating them separately and differently. A pianist, he played piano\n\n13\n\nSee the discography for a larger list of early space music. Three seminal albums are\n\nVangelis’ Heaven and Hell, Tangerine Dream’s Phaedra and Tomita’s The Planets.\n\n14\n\nThe synthesizer also used to create Milton Babbit’s “Philomel,” Luciano Berio’s\n\n“Visage,” and Terry Riley’s “Shri Camel.”\n\n© 1997 Eliot Bates\n\n40\n\n“solos” on every album, though in many songs (c.f. Heaven and Hell, part 1) the\n\npiano was an accompaniment for electronic buzzes and whirs. He also\n\nperformed many Greek percussion instruments and mixed in choral music with\n\nthe electronics. Of his electronic effects, one of the most innovative and\n\ncharacteristic was the portamento sweep, where a large synthesized chord\n\nwould smoothly glissando to a new pitch level. He used the same effect on his\n\nsynthesized clarinet sounds to make it seem as though the “player” was lipping\n\nthe reed.\n\nVangelis, despite his innovations in sound and his fame as a film scorer,15\n\nused traditional classical forms for most of his pieces. In analysis, many are\n\nsonatas, rondos, or theme-and-variations. In contrasting his work with that of\n\nthe other famous synthesizer and stadium concert giant, Tangerine Dream, we\n\nfind that although many of the sounds and synthesis techniques are the same,\n\nTangerine Dream didn’t adopt classical formal structures. They worked more\n\nwith layers of drones and ostinatos, putting less effort into the creation of\n\nelectronic “solo” instruments and melodic passages. Another fundamental\n\ndifference is found in the background of the musicians. In Greece, Vangelis is\n\nknown as the man who brought the first Greek rock ‘n’ roll band (Aphrodite’s\n\nChild) to his country in 1967. He has progressive rock roots, and through the\n\nyears as one of the heaviest promoted artists of Polydor Europe, he delved into\n\nspace music, new age, and music about nature. In recent albums, more of the\n\n© 1997 Eliot Bates\n\n41\n\nrock ‘n’ roll aesthetic has returned, though his new work is completely\n\nsynthesized. Tangerine Dream began as a rock band but interacted with\n\nGerman experimental musicians and, as a group, went through personnel\n\nchanges, different working ideologies, and radical altering of their sounds.\n\nBoth Vangelis and Tangerine Dream pioneered the art of lavish stadium\n\nconcerts, complete with the most advanced keyboards and synths, experimental\n\nlighting systems, and video displays. At Tangerine Dream concerts in\n\nparticular, many in the audience tripped on acid, or took other hallucinogens,\n\nand it’s not a large stretch to assert that these concerts were a prototypical\n\n“rave” scene. Raves were an urban music happening (originally in England),\n\nheld in abandoned warehouses where top DJ’s would broadcast very loud music\n\nall night and into the morning, and it was at raves that the musical genre of acid\n\nhouse was created. In the 1980’s, there was a fairly widespread understanding\n\nof the “proper” sequence of drugs to take through the experience, and the\n\nmusic would change mood from heavy, fast rhythms to slower, spaced out\n\ngrooves in response to the expected psychological needs of the ravers. The\n\nvariance in affect of the musics held true in British clubs, where different rooms\n\nfeatured “industrial,” “acid house,” or “chill out” themes. I will talk more about\n\nthe club-DJ influence on ambient later in this chapter.\n\nA subculture of Californian musicians, who had all been a part of the\n\nstadium concert and proto-rave scene in the 1970’s and 1980’s, helped create\n\n15\n\nHis well known films include Blade Runner and 1492: Conquest of Paradise, and the TV\n\nseries Antarctica and Cosmos.\n\n© 1997 Eliot Bates\n\n42\n\nfirst the space music scene and later “ambient space music.”16 Steve Roach was\n\none of the first, composing space music much in the idiom of Vangelis’ early\n\nelectronic works, but later exploring world music (particularly Indian). He\n\ncollaborated with a number of other artists, initially hiring them as studio\n\nmusicians, but later producing albums with them or playing on their own space\n\nand ambient music recordings. One of the best examples is the recording Dali:\n\nThe Endless Enigma, that is a compilation of the work of Roach, Robert Rich,\n\nMichael Shrieve (the best known “ambient” drummer), Michael Stearns, and\n\nMichael Brook. The work of all these artists comprises the bulk of the playlists\n\nof the Music from the Hearts of Space, still broadcast over the continent at late\n\nnight hours.\n\nRobert Rich is one of the central artists on the Music from the Hearts of\n\nSpace compilation CD’s, and his world music influenced synthesizer and guitar\n\nwashes are a frequent sound on the radio show, too. His personal ideology is\n\nconstructed around the concept of glurp, and two passages help to illustrate his\n\nusage of this term:\n\nFor many years I have struggled with the schizms [sic] between symmetry and\n\nrandomness, rationalism and mysticism, reductionism and wholism, shimmer and\n\nglurp. (from personal correspondence, June 1995)\n\nAs a child, I used to stay up late at night reading art books and Charles Addams\n\ncartoons. A neuronal [sic] connection occurred in my brain, merging my fantasies with\n\n16\n\nThis is a more specific category than “ambient” or “dark ambient,” referring to music\n\nwhich is created by former space music composers. The term is one of many coined by fans on\n\nthe Internet, but is used frequently by people on the space music mailing lists. See chatper 2 for\n\nmore on Internet fans.\n\n© 1997 Eliot Bates\n\n43\n\nMax Ernst’s melting “anti-Pope,” Dali’s Baked Beans and Nuclear Mysticism, the\n\nchirping of frogs outside in the creek, and the dripping of rain upon moss covered\n\nrocks. I could dream living worlds shrouded in clouds, mountains with faces,\n\ngeometric truth coexisting with liquid biomorphic phantasms. Glurp is the noun that\n\ncollects these associations. Dali was glurp, Gaudi was glurp. Fungus is glurp. Terry\n\nGilliam, J.G. Ballard, Gahan Wilson, Robyn Hitchcock... all connected to the archetype\n\nof glurp. (from “The Meaning of Glurp,” 1990)\n\nOne feature that distinguishes the above-mentioned ambient and spacemusic musicians from all the other ambient artists, is that much of their initial\n\nsponsorship came not from fans but from the music industry, particularly the\n\nconsumer electronics market. Roach was interviewed and profiled in just about\n\nevery keyboard magazine. Shrieve is featured yearly in Modern Drummer and\n\nElectronic Drummer, and all the artists were used to help market new keyboards\n\nand electronic drum equipment. Concerts became something of an industry\n\ndisplay of fancy new boxes, though Brook and Roach have shied away from that\n\nin their more recent performances, depending less on the industry for their\n\nbread and butter. Unlike the industrial-influenced artists or Eno and Fripp, for\n\nthat matter, there is no appeal in broken or semi-functional equipment, or in\n\nlow-fidelity sound-sources, which has prompted some Internet criticism as to\n\ntheir “true allegiance” to new age or space music.\n\nDespite disagreements about the ambient nature of various composers,\n\nspace music and ambient fans share a number of other affinities. One is with\n\nspace exploration (as in NASA). The year 1979, when the Cosmos series aired\n\non PBS, was one of the last great times in our nation’s popular history of space\n\nexploration (Vangelis composed much of the soundtrack). The Voyagers I and\n\nII were taking pictures like crazy, discovering new moons around the once-\n\n© 1997 Eliot Bates\n\n44\n\nmysterious outer planets of our solar system. A number of factors shifted the\n\npublic consciousness away from space exploration, particularly the space\n\nshuttle Challenger explosion in 1985. This event showed the world that\n\nmortality was an issue in space exploration, and fear over possible repeat\n\nincidents canned any existing ideas for manned missions to Mars or beyond. In\n\naddition, the Republican administration of Ronald Reagan capitalized on the\n\npublic fear of Russian retalliation with an increase in high-tech arms\n\nmanufacture, which he deployed in situations like Grenada and Libya. His\n\npersonal fantasy, we now know, was the construction of unmanned space\n\nweapons (“Star Wars,”) which would shoot down enemy planes, missles, and\n\nrockets -- this is far from the public myth of the scientific interest in outer space\n\nthat had fueled many of the space missions.\n\nIn chapter 5 I will talk more about one of the main affinities of space\n\nmusic, and ambient music, fans -- science-fiction. Most of the space albums I\n\nsuggest in the discography have cover art which is derivative of the same\n\ngraphical art style that covers sci-fi books, and many (such as Albedo 0,39 by\n\nVangelis) have an entire sci-fi subtext underneath the layers of synthesizers.\n\nRobert Rich and Michael Brook give praise to sci-fi literature as some of their\n\nmain musical inspirations; in turn, several sci-fi journals give space music album\n\nreviews.\n\n5th trajectory -- Breakdown of the rock band\n\n© 1997 Eliot Bates\n\n45\n\nWell I saw uh baby dancin’ in her x-ray gingham dress;\n\nI knew she was under duress, I knew her under her dress\n\nJust keep comin’ Jesus, you’re the best dressed...\n\n-Captain Beefheart, “M’Human Gets Me Blues” (1968)\n\nThe late 1960’s and early 1970’s saw a number of experimental rock\n\ngroups that in many ways broke down the structure and meaning of rock ’n’ roll.\n\nThe above example of lyrics shows Beefheart’s interest in the sound of the\n\nwords more than in the story told or the meaning attributed to them. The way\n\nhe lulled and emphasized the “esses” in each word, placing these syllables off\n\nthe major beats of the music, sounds more like a timbral counterpoint to the\n\nguitars than a synchronized vocal. Also, on this song there is no hierarchy of\n\nmusicians, and all the layers (guitar, bass, drums, saxophone, vocals) are\n\nplaying complicated parts in different meters, with none of the accompaniment /\n\nmelodic roles previously attributed to rock.17\n\nA German group, Can, was flipping instrumental roles upside down at\n\nthe same time. In this four-piece band, the bass and drums were clearly the\n\nmost prominent instruments and the guitar and singer were backgrounded.\n\nCan also broke down the normal accompaniment / melodic roles with use of\n\npolyrhythms, non-rhythmic tape loops, and ambient sounds in the background\n\nof their songs. Their “lead singer,” Dano Suzuki, was something of a deliberate\n\n17\n\nThe Magic Band was also unique at the time for their instrumentation, which included\n\ninstruments like the Mellotron (a primitive sampling keyboard), bass saxophones, and\n\nmarimbas. Many of the drum parts have no cymbals or hi-hat, or only cymbals and hi-hat, and\n\neven the electric guitar, a fairly standard instrument, was played in a very unconventional\n\nfashion by Rockette Morton (who clawed rapid successions of five-note dissonant chords with\n\nhis right hand)\n\n© 1997 Eliot Bates\n\n46\n\nmockery as well, with a very non-virtuousic voice, singing lyrics in broken\n\nEnglish. Bassist Holger Czukay, incidentally, went on to record two solo\n\nambient albums and to collaborate with David Sylvian on the brilliant Plight and\n\nPremonition and Flux + Mutability. In England, the Velvet Underground was\n\nworking toward the same aesthetic, with haunting rock numbers that broke\n\ndown into long arhythmic and unconventional jams. Their music was a great\n\ninspiration for early punk rock and industrial music, which took skewed\n\ninstrument roles as a given and developed from there. Brian Eno collaborated\n\nwith Velvet Underground’s John Cale on a couple of albums, too.\n\nMany underground and cult groups that emerged through the 1970’s and\n\n1980’s, cited one or more of the three above groups as their main inspiration.\n\nThe early recordings of Sonic Youth, one of the first Californian punk bands,\n\ndemonstrate an amazing exploration of guitar feedback.18 In live shows they\n\ninstigated feedback loops or slowly evolving distortions lasting for fifteen or\n\nmore minutes, and the trance-like states they induced in the audience (and\n\nthemselves) are much like the effect of ambient music recordings. Pere Ubu,\n\noriginally a Beefheart-inspired punk band in the midwest, was like Sonic Youth\n\nin some ways, but by 1978 they produced theme albums on subjects such as\n\nbabies learning to walk. The Art of Walking, in the way it uses recurrent motives\n\nand timbres and features the potential of vocal gibberish as a timbre, is very\n\nmuch an ambient-leaning album.\n\n18\n\nThe best examples are Confusion is Sex (1983) and Early Sonics: Sonic Death (1982).\n\n© 1997 Eliot Bates\n\n47\n\nThe Residents were a “commercial anti-group” who pioneered the art of\n\nsynthesizer playing. As a commercial entity, they were known for their\n\nanonymity (no one still is sure exactly who the Residents are) and their stage\n\ncostumes (tuxedos with large eyeball sculptures that covered their whole\n\nheads). Their Commercial Album, a record of forty one-minute pop songs and\n\njingles, is ostensibly about making a pop commodity in a pop context but in a\n\nvery non-pop way, as the effect of listening to forty different songs in the space\n\nof the time of a normal album makes each piece a unique timbral exploration.\n\nThe songs are sparse, and if they have a lyric it is short and incomplete; in one\n\nminute it is hard to make a song about anything. Two to three sounds, no more,\n\nunfold in a given song they but the skill with which the Residents foreground\n\nand background these delicate sounds is unlike the synthesizer use in any other\n\nband I know. However, their best known work, and an album mentioned\n\nfrequently on the Internet ambient list, is Eskimo, an attempt at re-creating a few\n\nEskimo ceremonies and rituals (though they don’t know anything at all about\n\nthe Inuit!) A synthesized “wind” track runs through the entire piece, and there\n\nare various arrangements of solo Eskimo chanting (beginning in a language the\n\nResidents concocted and gradually incorporating English words as the Eskimos\n\nare “corrupted” by developed nations), Eskimo choruses, and strange imprecise\n\ndrumming. There are also many soft and subtle synthesizer parts. As the\n\nwhole album exists in a singular mythical space (a San Franciscan’s impression\n\nof the arctic tundra), it is a major recording in the history of ambient music,\n\n© 1997 Eliot Bates\n\n48\n\nmuch like Jon Hassell’s Aka•Darbari•Java, Rapoon’s Kirghiz Lite, Nurse With\n\nWound’s Soliloquy for Lilith, all portraits of a particular landscape.\n\nThese are just a few of the experimenters of the 1970’s and 1980’s who\n\nchanged the way people listen to rock ’n’ roll, suggesting that the rock group\n\ncould be, first and foremost, about timbral exploration (and landscape\n\nnavigation). Other groups whose work also influenced ambient music concepts\n\ninclude Tuxedo Moon, Wire, Dome, the Birthday Party (in Australia),\n\nEinstürzende Neubauten (in Germany), and British progressive rock groups\n\nPink Floyd, Soft Machine, and King Crimson.19 These groups were pioneers in\n\nsounds, structure, and mood, but as pioneers their music was novel, and unable\n\nto get past being the “first” music to use these concepts. Ambient music was\n\nable to take the new timbres and moods and use them without being novel, and\n\ndo (one could say) “further research” on the subjects possible because of\n\nexperimentation.\n\nThese groups I highlight were also under the constraint of being active\n\nperforming musicians, which is not a time commitment for most ambient artists.\n\nThough they would experiment in the studio, too, the demands of fans meant\n\nthey needed to be able to recreate, without lip-synching, the albums they\n\nproduced. This aesthetic changed in the 1980’s when the groups changed from\n\nalbum-producing live bands to album-producing studio artists. To take the\n\nexample of the group Wire, when they regrouped as Dome, their studio\n\nreleases quite exceeded what they could perform live, made of extensive layers\n\n© 1997 Eliot Bates\n\n49\n\nof electronically treated and distorted sounds. The Dome albums, with long\n\nsongs that are mostly noisy drone (with a background of indistinguishable\n\nlyrics), are ambient music in a rock band format. The Residents shied away\n\nfrom performances, too, as they felt they had a mission to create the most\n\nfascinating sounds for people to listen to. They also believed they had a closer\n\nconncection to their audience if they made really good albums, stating that their\n\nfans weren’t buying just a recording but buying a “friend.” (Search and Destroy\n\n#3, 1981) From experimental rock groups we move to experimental DJ’s, who\n\nalso began in a performative space but moved to the production of ambient\n\nrecordings.\n\n6th Trajectory -- Club Culture\n\nOne night on late night TV, I flipped onto a video of an androgynous person moving in\n\nslow-motion in a world that was moving uncontrollably fast. It would come across a\n\ncrosswalk on the highway, but the car lights were moving at hundreds or thousands of\n\nmiles an hour. On a dank alley way it observed a vine attempting to grow out of a crack\n\non a dirty brick wall, but later in the video the vine died. The protagonist walked by a\n\nstore window in this hectic city, where dozens of black and white televisions were\n\nbroadcasting pictures and messages, messages which lasted only 1/24 of a second,\n\nsubliminal messages about something, until suddenly one of the video screens rested\n\non a message for a few seconds, “MONSTERS EXIST,” which caused a great deal of\n\nfear in the androgynous cyber-person. The credits rolled and I saw this strange video\n\nwas by the techno/ambient group Orbital, part of a new MTV series, AMP, which\n\nfeatures “ambient music” and videos. Is ambient music going the route of every other\n\ncultish music scene? (research notes, 12/28/96)\n\nThe music on MTV’s AMP is by and large not ambient. Artists like\n\nTricky, Ultraworld, Massive Attack, and Orbital are some of the major players in\n\n19\n\nSee the discography for recommended albums by these artists.\n\n© 1997 Eliot Bates\n\n50\n\ntrip-hop and acid-house music, though their most recent albums are less dance\n\noriented, with weaker stated rhythms and more non-rhythmic content.\n\nHowever, the music industry has latched onto these artists as part of the new\n\nhip “ambient” music scene.\n\nIt’s not so easy to dismiss club music as something separate from\n\nambient music. There are some notable cross-over artists and still others who\n\nwork in both experimental, non-dance genres and as dance DJ’s. Also, some of\n\nthe first techno DJ’s who shaped the Detroit house scene and most of the\n\nBritish club scenes -- Chris Carter, Cosey Fanni Tutti, and Genesis P-Orridge (of\n\nThrobbing Gristle), and Richard B. Kirk (of Cabaret Voltaire) -- began as\n\nexperimental industrial musicians but adopted a club DJ mentality. Another\n\nconnection between club music’s origins and ambient’s roots lies in the\n\npopularity of Krautrock acts, such as Kraftwerk, in the club venues later\n\ninhabited by techno DJ’s. Kraftwerk and Can (cited previously), with other\n\nKrautrock groups, gained international popularity in the early to mid-1970’s and\n\nshared a common fan base.\n\nConsiderable information exists on the Internet on hundreds of local\n\nDJ’s, including DJ’s who run chill-out rooms, techno, acid house, and trip hop\n\nDJ’s who have made forays into ambient grooves. As club cultures weren’t a\n\npart of my own musical background and there was already too much\n\ninformation on the artists I was familiar with, I profess ignorance to many of the\n\ndevelopments in the club-inspired ambient music scenes. Sarah Thornton’s\n\n© 1997 Eliot Bates\n\n51\n\nbook Club Cultures would be nicely sequeled by a similar work focusing on such\n\nartists and their fans.\n\nFrom reading many posts on the ambient music Internet mailing list, I\n\nhave ascertained that several artists are quite revered among fans with club\n\nbackgrounds who also listen to ambient music. Such artists as the Future\n\nSound of London (FSOL), the Higher Intelligence Agency, and all the artists on\n\nthe FAX label (the offshoot projects of Pete Namlook) are mentioned frequently,\n\nand experts on them abound on the mailing list. Qualities that are attributed to\n\nthem are their creative use of techno-based timbres in an ambient manner, but\n\nmost of all their ability to transport the listener to virtual spaces (which FSOL\n\ncalls “biospheres”) or conjure up abstract images of digital-age life (called\n\n“lifeforms”).\n\nMany ambient list-posters shun techno- and acid house-inspired ambient\n\nmusic, and the factions of fans have gone through phases of suggesting a\n\nbreakdown of ambient into sub-categories (much like the fragmentation of\n\ntechno into jungle, trance, ambient, acid house, etc.). The titles of the subcategories, such as “ambient house,” are generally chosen for the timbral\n\nallegiances of that canon of works, which is an interesting contrast to other\n\nnomenclature systems of modern music.20 Thus, ambient house would use the\n\n20\n\nCategories of other underground genres seem to have varying motivations. The\n\nsubdivision of the British ska scene in the 1980’s contrived the 2-tone category, named after a\n\nrecord label; psychorockabilly is a combination of the rockabilly instrumentation with a\n\npsychotic mentality, and straight-edge punk is defined by the substance-free pledge of the fans\n\nand musicians.\n\n© 1997 Eliot Bates\n\n52\n\nsame TC-808 drum machine (from which the ambient house group 808 State\n\ngets their name) as regular house, but use it in a different way.\n\nOne important cross-over artist is Richard James, the man behind AFX,\n\nPolygon Window and Aphex Twin, a prolific ambient and dance music artist\n\nwith a distinct philosophy of music, who recently landed a major label deal (with\n\nWarner). James, like Brian Eno, used many unconventional recording and\n\nsound manipulation techniques to create subtle rhythms and ostinatos, and\n\nmore detail on his mysterious compositional practices is in chapter 2. Aphex\n\nTwin has videos on MTV, too. As a club DJ in the 1980’s, he was popular for his\n\nvideos, which would fill TV screens in the chill out rooms of prominent British\n\nclubs.21\n\nIf James is an example of a balance between the club DJ and the studio\n\nambient artist, the chill-out rooms where his videos and music played were the\n\nclub’s antidote to the overbearing heavy rhythms of techno and acid house.\n\nThese rooms, which often had pre-recorded soundtracks, were where people\n\ncoming down off drug trips, too exhausted to move anymore, went to chill out.\n\nJames was one of the first club DJ’s who DJ’ed the chill-out room, though\n\nAutechre and other cross-over artists soon followed-suit. The chill-out room and\n\nthe bedroom or listening room of the domestic ambient fan share a peculiar\n\nsimilarity. People don’t interact in these spaces, and they experience their own\n\ndrug-induced voyages in a darkened setting designed with listening in mind.22\n\n21\n\nSee chapter 2 for a composer profile of Richard James.\n\n© 1997 Eliot Bates\n\n53\n\nAuthenticity and the Recording\n\nThe presence of the original is the prerequisite to the concept of authenticity.\n\n(Benjamin 1968: 220)\n\nOne might subsume the eliminated element in the term “aura” and go on to say: that\n\nwhich withers in the age of mechanical reproduction is the aura of the work of art... the\n\ntechnique of reproduction detaches the reproduced object from the domain of tradition.\n\n(ibid., 221)\n\nEvery fundamentally new, pioneering creation of demands will carry beyond its goal.\n\nDadaism did so to the extent that it sacrificed the market values which are so\n\ncharacteristic of the film in favor of higher ambitions -- though of course it was not\n\nconscious of such intentions. The Dadaists attached much less importance to the sales\n\nvalue of their work than to its uselessness for contemplative immersion. What they\n\nintended and achieved was a relentless destruction of the aura of their creations, which\n\nthey branded as reproductions with the very means of production. (ibid., 237)\n\nWalter Benjamin’s The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical\n\nReproduction, if not the first work to seriously explore the changes in the modes\n\nof art perception after the advent of photography and sound films, is certainly\n\nthe most often cited. However, many of the issues that Benjamin introduces,\n\nshrouding the larger category of “authenticity and art,” need a serious reevaluation in the 1990’s. The playing field has expanded and the rules of the\n\ngame have changed. Benjamin was not writing during a period when entire\n\ngenres were conceived in the recording studio, and commercial recordings\n\nwere the original musical performance. Also, it was not until the early 1980’s\n\nthat digital technology began to dominate the industry.\n\n22\n\nSarah Thornton found, in her research of British club culture, that the chill-out room\n\nwas often a “VIP” room, one to which only a few exclusive people had access, and this correlates\n\nwell with the bedroom ambient listener’s exclusive listening space described in detail in chapter\n\n4.\n\n© 1997 Eliot Bates\n\n54\n\nIt is imperative to understand the fundamental differences between the\n\nLP and the CD, to appreciate not only the heightened concern of illegal\n\nsampling, but moreover to understand the added value of a compact disc of\n\nmusic. Arguments about digital versus analog notwithstanding, the CD is a\n\nvirtually exact replica of the original master. By this, I mean that no\n\ndegradation of sound, or loss of information occurred when the original master\n\nwas transferred to the CD, and subsequent digital copies caused absolutely no\n\nloss in sound quality or increase in noise.23 With the LP, at best the disc is an\n\napproximation of the original, and even with the best turntables there is a\n\nperceivable difference in a copy made from the original master and one made\n\nfrom the LP. In the age of digital, consumers are buying products that are the\n\nequivalent of original masters, not the dubs they purchased before.\n\nHow do we conceive of the aura of a recorded product? Benjamin noted:\n\nEven the most perfect reproduction of a work of art is lacking in one element: its\n\npresence in time and space, its unique existence at the place where it happens to be.\n\n(Benjamin 1968: 220)\n\nWe know that the earliest art works originated in the service of a ritual -- first the\n\nmagical, then the religious kind. (ibid., 223]\n\nThis may be true if one is comparing, for example, a studio recording of a\n\nharpsichord work with the context of the piece in the court of Louis XIV, or a\n\nReal World overproduction of African drumming with the original performance\n\nexperience. But how do we analyze a work, such as Oval’s 94Diskont composed\n\n23\n\nThere is the potential for a slight loss of quality if the digital mastering of the CD is\n\n© 1997 Eliot Bates\n\n55\n\nby an algorithm on a Macintosh computer, the digital output directly copied\n\nonto the CD one purchases? There is no original time and space of this\n\nrecording except in the composer’s head. But there is a sense of ritual, and in\n\nchapter 4 I describe in detail the components of ambient listening rituals. The\n\nwork, in its ability to affect the subconscious, takes on a magical aura of the sort\n\nthat Benjamin couldn’t have imagined writing in 1938.\n\nBenjamin wrote well before the role of the DJ changed from one who\n\nmerely spinned dance records to one who creatively manipulated those\n\nrecordings, and before the emergence of any genres featuring the creative art of\n\nDJ’ing (such as rap, hip-hop, and dub). One book that offers a post-Benjamin\n\ndefinition of “authenticity,” in the context of the recorded artifact, is Club\n\nCultures. Thornton writes:\n\nFirst... authenticity is dependent on the degree to which records are assimilated and\n\nlegitimized by a subculture. Authentication is the ultimate end of enculturation.\n\nSecond, the distance between a record’s production and its consumption is relevant to\n\nthe cultural value bestowed upon it. When original performers are remote in time or\n\nplace, as is the case with foreign imports and revived rarities, records can acquire\n\nprestige and authority. Third, the environment in which a record is produced\n\ncontributes to its authenticity. Records are more likely to be perceived as the primary\n\nmedium of musics whose main site of production is the studio. And finally, the\n\nideological vagaries of music genres like their communication of bodily ‘soul’ or their\n\nrevelation of technology play a main role in whether records come across as genuine.\n\nIn other words, authenticity is ultimately an effect of the discourses which surround\n\npopular music. (Thornton 1996: 66)\n\nAnother writing, and one of the few canonized reception studies, is\n\nTheodor Adorno’s On the Fetish-Character in Music and Regression of Listening.\n\nWhere Benjamin attempted to disallow the possibility of aura in a mechanically\n\npoorly done, but the increasing expertise of studio engineers has made that problem rare.\n\n© 1997 Eliot Bates\n\n56\n\nreproduced medium, Adorno attempts to illustrate how the increasing\n\nfetishization and commodification of music has rendered a “musical experience”\n\nimpossible.\n\nThe consciousness of the mass of listeners is adequate to fetishized music. It listens\n\naccording to formula, and indeed debasement itself would not be possible if resistance\n\nensued, if the listeners still had the capacity to make demands beyond the limits of what\n\nwas supplied.... In music as elsewhere, the discrepancy between essence and\n\nappearance has grown to a point where no appearance is any longer valid, without\n\nmediation, as verification of the essence. (Adorno 1938: 285)\n\nThe counterpart to the fetishism of music is a regression of listening.... Not only do the\n\nlistening subjects lose, along with the freedom of choice and responsibility, the capacity\n\nfor conscious perception of music, but they stubbornly reject the possibility of such\n\nperception. (ibid., 286)\n\nReplacing the previous system, where (albeit only a few) people were able to\n\nspecifically listen to music, is one where large corporations, through\n\nadvertising, dictate the commodities people should purchase. Adorno’s work\n\nborders on pure paranoia, with the author using ideas such as “subversion” and\n\n“betrayal,” and drawing on the images of Aldous Huxley, to contend that “The\n\nliquidation of the individual is the real signature of the new musical situation.”\n\n(ibid., 276) Four quotes illustrate clearly Adorno’s concept of the relationship\n\nbetween listeners and corporations:\n\nThe star principle has become totalitarian. The reactions of the listeners appear to have\n\nno relation to the playing of the music. They have reference, rather, to the cumulative\n\nsuccess which, for its part, cannot be thought of unalienated by the past spontaneities of\n\nlisteners, but instead dates back to the command of publishers, sound film magnates\n\nand rulers of radio. (ibid.)\n\nThe concept of musical fetishism cannot be psychologically derived. That ‘values’ are\n\nconsumed and draw feelings to themselves, without their specific qualities being\n\nreached by the consciousness of the consumer, is a later expression of their commodity\n\ncharacter. For all contemporary musical life is dominated by the commodity form; the\n\nlast pre-capitalist residues have been eliminated. Music, with all the attributes of the\n\n© 1997 Eliot Bates\n\n57\n\nethereal and sublime which are generously accorded it, serves in America today as an\n\nadvertisement for commodities which one must acquire in order to be able to hear\n\nmusic. (ibid., 278)\n\nThe consumer is really worshipping the money that he himself has paid for the ticket to\n\nthe Toscanini concert. (ibid., 278)\n\nRegressive listening is tied to production by the machinery of distribution, and\n\nparticularly by advertising. Regressive listening appears as soon as advertising turns\n\ninto terror, as soon as nothing is left for the consciousness but to capitulate before the\n\nsuperior power of the advertised stuff and purchase spiritual peace by making the\n\nimposed goods literally its own thing. (ibid., 287)\n\nThere are several factors which make Adorno’s arguments difficult to\n\naccept, at least in relation to ambient music listening and consuming. First of\n\nall, ambient is a fan-promoted genre. This means that virtually no advertising\n\nmonies are spent by the record companies. Second of all, ambient is an\n\nunderground, possibly subcultural genre that has a small but dedicated fan\n\nbase. It is decidedly unpopular (in a pop culture sense), and in my interview\n\nwith Jason Brown in chapter 2 he brings up the ostracism he experienced as an\n\nambient music fan. Third, ambient, which has been called by several artists and\n\nmany fans “isolationist” music, is an entirely solitary activity. In the Internet\n\nsurvey I summarize in chapter 3, I found that with only two exceptions all the\n\nfans listened by themselves to this music, and many respondants mentioned\n\nthat they didn’t know anyone else who liked this style of music. Fourth,\n\nambient music, though it could be used otherwise, is generally the center of\n\nattention when fans listen, and fans often give hundreds of listenings to a song\n\nor album. An interview with one fan revealed that although pieces by David\n\nSylvian invoked the same waking dream each time, he discovered many subtle\n\n© 1997 Eliot Bates\n\n58\n\nnuances after years of repeated listening. The intense study of the music, which\n\nisn’t done for academic reasons, is far from “regressive” listening.\n\nThese four points appear throughout the thesis in different contexts.\n\nHowever, there are even more refutations to the arguments of Benjamin and\n\nAdorno, which I will briefly summarize. The limitations I set on the scope of the\n\nthesis mean that I haven’t developed these ideas fully, but introduce them to\n\nstimulate other scholars to consider them.\n\nThe packaging of ambient music is a whole field of research in itself.\n\nThough liner notes on new albums tend to be sparse, sometimes not even\n\nindicating the name of the artists or the album, the presentation is very distinct.\n\nEach record label favors a genre of visual art; one notable example is the label\n\nTable of the Elements, which uses inks with metallic pigments for all their\n\ncovers. They moved beyond the recognizable gold and silver pigments, and use\n\nless common metals such as zinc, chromium, titanium, tungsten, and tin. The\n\ncovers are reminiscent of the paintings of Anselm Keifer. Many of Soleilmoon’s\n\ncovers are designed by Robin Storey, whose art has roots in ancient Mayan\n\ncalendars and Native American cave paintings. These examples, I hope, show\n\nthat the packaging of ambient CD’s is sufficiently different from that of pop CD’s\n\nto warrant a serious analysis as modern art.\n\nI mention briefly that several artists invoke the Deleuzian image of the\n\nrhizome to explain the studio phenomena of the remix. I think that other\n\naspects of ambient music would benefit from a similar comparison, including\n\n© 1997 Eliot Bates\n\n59\n\nthe relationship between audience and composer, the structure of the ambient\n\ncommunity, and the notion of time in ambient music listening.\n\n© 1997 Eliot Bates\n\n60\n\nChapter 2\n\nambient composer personalities\n\nIn chapter 1 the trajectory is used to demonstrate a mode of analysis that\n\nfocuses on the intellectual and musical influences of several important cultural\n\nscenes. This chapter will go into more detail about six important ambient\n\ncomposers. I singled these artists out for a number of reasons. First, there was\n\nsufficient information in print, either in magazine articles or on the Internet,\n\nconcerning the issues I wished to consider about the personalities of the\n\ncomposers.
