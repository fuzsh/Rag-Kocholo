        "text": "DAVID ZIERLER: This is David Zierler, Director of the Caltech Heritage Project. It is Monday, October 25, 2021. It's my great pleasure to be here Professor Amnon Yariv. Amnon, thank you so much for welcoming me into your office.\n\nAMNON YARIV: My pleasure.\n\nZIERLER: To start, just to orient our readers, I'd like to point researchers to two previous oral histories with Amnon. The first was with Joan Bromberg, located here at Caltech. This interview day took place on January 28, 1985. And in this interview, you started with your Berkeley years and brought it right up until that present, 1985. The other oral history you did was with Shirley Cohen, also here at Caltech. That one was more of a full-life oral history, where you talked about your family background and your childhood, and you took that right up to the present at that time, which was 1999. So our first effort today, circa October 2021, is to fill in the years from 1999 all the way to our present, 2021.\n\nAmnon, perhaps to start, let's bring it back to the year 1999, the year 2000. You left off with Shirley Cohen talking about all of the work that you had done with your Japanese colleagues, and you mentioned also a certain pendulum shift in terms of Japanese students staying in Japan versus them coming here. Let's start with that. After 1999, in terms of the education and the best research in the fields that were important to you, were the Japanese staying at home, or were they coming here to the United States?\n\nYARIV: The Japanese stayed at home because Japan, at that point, had advanced in my area, both economically and technologically to the point where Japanese students could get first-rate education in Japan, probably most notably at Tokyo Institute of Technology, the University of Tokyo, and maybe the University of Osaka. There were good universities, and the source of the students was mostly leading Japanese companies like Hitachi, Nikon, companies in optics and semiconductors, Toshiba. And at that point, they were probably technologically ahead of the US in terms of making lasers, advanced electronics. Fewer and fewer Japanese students came over. More Koreans, more Israelis, more Chinese. So yes, to answer your question, there was a shift. Probably very few Japanese students today in this area in the US.\n\nZIERLER: To orient our researchers, what are the industries or the fields of research that were so important to you, but for which the Japanese were leaders at the time?\n\nYARIV: Well, the Japanese were not leaders at the very beginning. we have taught them, for instance, how to make semiconductor distributed feedback lasers that were becoming the main light source for optical fiber communication (they still are). At Caltech in my group we were pursuing a number of problem areas in laser physics and nonlinear optics. The most important of them, in terms of people, resources, were semiconductor lasers and optics. Essentially, a transition, where today, the most daring and exciting experiments in optics are not done with lenses and each component a box on a tabletop, but on crystals. Light is not propagating through air or vacuum, as it does in a camera for instance but in waveguides, which are essentially chemical waveguides on crystals.\n\nAnd the whole device, which used to occupy a tabletop, will now be about, let's say, a millimeter by a millimeter, compressing many, many components. That was one area. Probably the most important of them, in terms of both intellectually and the impact on technology was integrated optoelectronics. The idea that you could make, on a single crystal, by photo lithographic techniques, essentially, everything you need to perform communication functions. For instance, making, as I've just shown you in the reprint, lasers, modulators, detectors, complete optoelectronic transceivers and receivers, both on a single crystal of Galium Arsenide and related semiconductor alloys. That is becoming the most important communication technology of the 21st century. Joyce Poon described the initial proposal from my group at Caltech in Isfhan (Iran) in a conference in 1971and the first ever demonstration of optoelectronic Integrated circuits in 1978 , in my group at Caltech.\n\nBack to top\n\nDefining Optoelectronics\n\nZIERLER: Now, if you can orient yourself back to the year 1999, 2000, what were you working on at that point? The dates are too late. It is important here to get them exact because I find a reluctance on the part of some circles to give Caltech credit for the starting this field. I think it will have major bragging rights and important for Caltech as well as for the people directly involved, including myself.\n\nYARIV: I gave you a bunch of reprints. I haven't done my homework very well over the weekend.\n\nZIERLER: That's OK.\n\nYARIV: We were at the beginning of integrated optoelectronics. The info I gave you just above and the one shown by Joyce Poon is more accurate. I actually I first proposed IOECs in around 1967-8. We probably could find it in the proceedings of the international semiconductor meeting in Japan in the late 1960s. What's the date on that?\n\nZIERLER: This is 1984. Were you still working on optoelectronic circuits?\n\nYARIV: I've actually been working on optoelectronic circuits until a few months ago.\n\nZIERLER: A few months ago.\n\nYARIV: I'm actually still doing it a little bit. The method was bought by industry. And a lot of people are doing it. It's still in the beginning. We'll talk more about it as we go on. And my guess is the next big impact will be on electronics for self-driven automobiles. Although we prefer them starting with the name optoelectronic integrated circuit, the world decided they were photonic integrated circuits, or PICs. We use both names interchangeably.\n\nZIERLER: Scientifically, is one better or more descriptive than the other?\n\nYARIV: Well, optoelectronic probably describes it better because it's optics and electronics in the title. Photonic integrated circuits don't tell you that it is integrated with what. The word photonic is derived from photons. I prefer the first one, but the world has decided to go one way, and we'll not make a fight about that issue. That reminds me of when I was at Bell Labs, when I joined them in 1959, the term optical masers was used then instead of lasers. And I was the one, I think, at Bell Labs that, in writing a significant paper, used the word lasers. And I got a lot of flak from it at Bell Labs. And I made the same argument. [laugh]\n\nZIERLER: You should've called it maser, they were saying?\n\nYARIV: They wanted me to call it optical masers, and I called it lasers.\n\nZIERLER: Did anybody use that term before you?\n\nYARIV: Yes, yes. I did not invent it. But I basically made the point that once the world shows a strong preference, and you are in a small minority, don't make a fight about names.\n\nZIERLER: What was the distinction in your mind? Why was it important to call it a laser?\n\nYARIV: Because it was one word. [laugh] And shorter. But it was not important for me intellectually to call it a laser. It's just that I could see which way the wind blew. More and more of the papers published, a majority, used the word laser.\n\nZIERLER: Who was giving you flack at Bell Labs for this?\n\nYARIV: I don't recall their names, but I got flack. It wasn't serious. Bell Labs was a fairly democratic place.\n\nZIERLER: On the personal side, tell me about the article you wrote in 2000, Catching the Wave. Who asked you to write this autobiographical article?\n\nYARIV: I think the Journal of Quantum Electronics, the leading journal in the field.\n\nZIERLER: And they wanted you to just write about your life experiences?\n\nYARIV: That's it.\n\nZIERLER: Why the title, Catching the Wave? What does that refer to?\n\nYARIV: Probably, if you look at my career, almost everything I've done involves waves, optical waves. Probably no exception. The Shower experiment would be the first exception.\n\nZIERLER: We'll talk about that.\n\nYARIV: And I was a body surfer, which was the main sport activity and I was involved waves… I caught a wave. In Hebrew to surf is translated as wave catching and I was a charter founding member of Agudat Tofsei Hagalim -The Association of Wave Catchers- founded on the beach in Tel Aviv in about 1946. As you'll see from the story, decisions. I went to Bell Labs and I was looking for something to do. Bell gave us nearly complete freedom to do what we wanted as long as we stayed loosely within the field of interest to communication and information technology. The semiconductor laser was invented, demonstrated at IBM and GE Labs. I with my group were the first people at Bell Labs to make a semiconductor laser.\n\nZIERLER: What was Bell's interest in the semiconductor laser? What was exciting about it?\n\nYARIV: Well, they were not really interested. They didn't invent it, were not involved in its invention but they were intelligent and understood communication i, maybe John Pierce or Rudy Kompfner, thought maybe semiconductors were important. They did not know much about semiconductors but they knew that transistors were important. The labs could afford to have a few scientists play around bit in this area. The transistors were invented at Bell Labs. It was a small thing to ask a scientist at Bell Labs to look into it. I was a new kid on the block, really looking for something significant to do. My first duties at Bell Labs were other things. So I was asked, \"Would you be interested?\" And I said yes. I forgot why. I was particularly interested. And I made the first semiconductor laser at Bell Labs. And a year later, in the process of making that laser at Bell, I discovered that the laser depended crucially on the phenomenon of optical wave guiding the confined lossless propagation of light inside a channel of a high index of refraction material which is surrounded by material of a lower index. The first lasers were two polished mirrors which enabled an optical wave to bounce back and forth between the two mirrors and be amplified by the gain medium which occupies the volume between the 2 mirrors. prevent the reflected light from escaping by diffraction away from the semiconductor amplifying (gain) medium between the mirrors. My first challenge was to decide what confined the light in the lasers since their GaAs lasers did not have curved end-reflecting mirrors. Just flat parallel polished surfaces.\n\nIn the semiconductor laser, the confinement of the light, which was essential to any laser, was done by essentially optical guiding. There was an optical waveguide that confined the light like water in a pipe. With Rogerio Leite we showed that the depletion layer of the p-n junction in the semiconductor laser acted as an optical waveguide and without it the laser would have never lased because the optical losses sue to diffraction would have been too high. Modern optics and lasers as well as integrated optics is based on guiding light on the crystal in those dielectric waveguides. Those are the equivalent of wires in electronic circuits carry which optical energy and signals. In my first experiments, I was trying to understand why the semiconductor worked at all. Because light obviously came out of a very small area of the end reflecting surfaces, and using the height of a simple diffraction loss calculation, I found that the losses would be so eliminating the diffraction loses magnitude. Somebody mentioned to me dielectric waveguiding about which I knew very little at the beginning. As it turned out, the electromagnetic understanding of how to design the confinement and the guiding and the modes of the laser field turned out to be as or even more important than the solid-state physics in designing SC (semiconducting) lasers, and that was new. This was something our world-famous solid-state physicists at the labs did not know much about so it became the domain of a group of us electrical engineers at John Pierce's communication department, which was my home at Bell. That was what gave us at Caltech later on a head start.\n\nZIERLER: And there's no diffraction with this laser?\n\nYARIV: It loses energy by other mechanism, mostly scattering but a negligible percentage by diffraction as long as the light in the laser is waveguided. It's like a pipe. If you water your lawn with a hose, the light comes to you from wherever, in a pipe. As soon as it gets out, you have a big shpritz of light in all directions. Same with light. But practically all of optics up to that point had to do with free space propagation, and diffracting propagation of light of optics before that is essentially free space propagation of light. The realization that you can create light; i.e., make lasers in III-V semiconductors, guide the light in the dielectric waveguides produced by doping and composition in a single crystal, was a Eureka moment for me. What also helped was that the resulting device could be combined with transistors in the SAME GaAs crystals. This led to the proposal and demonstration later at Caltech of the new technology of Integrated Opto-Electronic Circuits (IOECs)\n\nZIERLER: What year did you come to Caltech?\n\nYARIV: 1964.\n\nZIERLER: Were you recruited here out of Bell Labs?\n\nYARIV: No. I joined Bell Labs in 1959, and after maybe three or four years, I decided that although I loved it there–I even enjoyed New Jersey [laugh]–that I did not see it as my long-term place to spend my career. For reasons which were not exactly clear.\n\nZIERLER: Did you want to teach? Did you want students?\n\nYARIV: No. I hadn't taught before. I did not have a teaching experience, and I did not have a burning desire to teach. But I felt that having been born in the desert, the Middle East, I needed sun. And it's very difficult to get down to Coast around NYC, if you've ever tried it. [laugh] Only in a few months in the summer, you can do that. Yes, but then the one or two highways, the Garden State Freeway, the New Jersey Turnpike, took hours to make the 30, 40 miles from summit. And eventually, I wound up spending the hot summer weekends in a swim club, many were antisemitic [laugh] and would not accept us as members wound up on weekends swimming, driving over to the Delaware river on the border between Jersey and Pennsylvania, and that was nice.\n\nZIERLER: But you needed more water in your life.\n\nYARIV: So I came back to the dry West Coast. Looking at Bell Labs, there were a whole bunch of very famous people, I decided that it was too confined, maybe intellectually, socially. I didn't see it as a place where I wanted to spend the next 30, 40 years. I didn't go back directly to university. When I left Bell Labs, I had two young children. I resigned from WJ before being offered the summer opportunity at Lockheed.\n\nZIERLER: What was the problem?\n\nYARIV: Needing to spend my time bringing in money, rather than promising to do something. Making the elecro-optic modulator, as an example.\n\nZIERLER: Although, ironically, at Bell, you never had to worry about bringing in money.\n\nYARIV: Never. Yes. I was too proud to go back to Bell Labs, though I could've done it. They told me, \"You can come back any time.\" I did well there, they liked me. But I was too proud. And the basic objection to growing old at Bell Labs, it was not an option for me. I liked the West Coast.\n\nZIERLER: And going back to Israel was out of the question at this point.\n\nYARIV: Out of the question. Don't forget, we're talking about eight years or so after independence. And there was no real research in Israel.\n\nZIERLER: Nothing was happening at Technion yet?\n\nYARIV: Very little. There was an exception, which I'll talk about later. And I wanted to do research. It was clear that was what I wanted to do. And while at Berkeley, my PhD thesis, which eventually was on lasers, started by work on traveling-wave tubes. A microwave device which is an an amplifier. It's used on communication satellites today. Very good, but very large, and an interesting area of research. My master's thesis, first two years, 1954 through '56, I did a project on traveling-wave tubes with John Whinnery, who was one of the leading experts in the field, wonderful professor. Also my thesis advisor. And I decided it was interesting. Anyhow, that got me interested in waves and so on. And the main center for research on traveling-wave tubes was Caltech.\n\nBack to top\n\nThe Centrality of Roy Gould\n\nZIERLER: Who was leading it at Caltech at that point?\n\nYARIV: A young professor called Roy Gould, who retired maybe seven, eight years ago, and died a couple of years ago. Wonderful scientist. Wrote a bunch of very influential and insightful papers, which I had read and admired. I knew him. I met him at a meeting or two. And after two years at Bell Labs, maybe '61, '62, I ran into Roy Gould at a meeting and by that time, had written a number of basic papers was known in the new growing field of lasers. And Roy Gould told me, \"Look, if you are ever interested in an academic career, call me.\" And we probably had dinner together, good friends, and I had no desire at that time to go to a university. I was in the thick of making lasers and other things. But of course, I remembered it. And when I became dissatisfied with my job at Watkins-Johnson, I resigned. Th Lockheed research Lab in Palo Alto agreed to offer me a temporary job till the beginning of the academic year in Sept. 1964 since I had already decided to move to Academe.\n\nZIERLER: Who was your connection at Lockheed? What were they doing that was relevant for you?\n\nYARIV: Lockheed had and has a research lab on Hanover Road in Palo Alto. It's the heart of Silicon Valley, half a mile from Stanford. Lasers were, at that point as important. Not sure why. There were about maybe a dozen people at Lockheed researching them. And I didn't know them before, but they knew of me. I called them, and we agreed to try an idea, a project I wanted to work on. And they agreed to give me a lab and an engineer to work with me. And we did some interesting experiments during that summer. And in the meantime, I had applied to Cornell, Stanford, Berkeley, UC San Diego, and my friend Roy Gould at Caltech.\n\nZIERLER: Was Gould a research island here? Or were there collaborators he had?\n\nYARIV: He was on his own working on traveling-wave tubes and related issues. And he did some first-rate work.\n\nZIERLER: What are traveling-wave tubes, and what do they do?\n\nYARIV: A traveling-wave tube (TWT) is an amplifier of high frequency, microwave, signals. It is very wide band so it can amplify microwave signals which is modulated by a large number of tv channels cable tv programming. Like all amplifiers, a microwave signal carrying information, like tv programming, enters the TWT amplifier from one end, comes out amplified maybe 1,000 times or more from the other. Still used today on satellites because it's the best amplifier velocity and then shot through the center of a metallic helix and are moving inside and along the axis of the helix. The microwave signal is applied to the helix and propagates along the helix. which slows it down so it can stay in step the electron beam. And you have to match the velocities.\n\nYou can change the voltage on the electron beam and change its velocity until the velocity of the wave projected along the horizontal and the electron beam are nearly in sync. And then, the energy is transferred from the electrons to the wave. And the wave grows -amplified. It comes out of the other side. It's a vacuum envelope, a helix electron gram, and the wave comes out of the other side amplified maybe 1,000 or 10,000 times. For communication satellites, you send a signal, let's say a telephone call, from here to a satellite, obviously by the time it comes to the satellite, it's very weak. But you want to bounce it back from, let's say, the US to a satellite into Asia. You need to amplify it, otherwise the noise will overcome it.\n\nZIERLER: Now, was Gould already thinking about applications to satellites? Or that's too early?\n\nYARIV: No, Gould was not, I think, thinking of that. The idea of communications satellites started at Bell Labs by my bosses John Pierce and Rudy Kompfner. And they made the world's first communications satellites. And those were big balloons coated with silver. The next big step in the basics of the communications satellites of today came from a Caltech aeronautical engineer, Rosen, then a scientist at Hughes Aircraft synchronous satellites. The first-generation Bell Labs were low-orbit, so they went around every hour or hour and a half because they were low. And then, the idea of having a synchronous satellite, a satellite that would actually, as it revolves around the earth, would revolve at the same speed as the earth rotations, an angular speed.\n\nSo the satellite would essentially hover over the same spot on the earth, and that was crucial. But you needed to stabilize it. Those two main ideas came from Rosen, that was his name. His older brother was on the board of trustees of Caltech later. Anyhow, that was the basis of the present-day technology of synchronous communications satellites. Roy Gould was not involved in the satellites, but he was, in my mind, probably the leading theoretician in the exchange of energy in the traveling-wave tube and the noise. Always, noise is the most important, as you'll see in my own work later on the laser.\n\nI called Roy. Roy was on sabbatical, I think in Australia. And Roy called a colleague at Caltech, who invited me to give a seminar. I came down, and maybe a month later, I had an offer from Caltech, so I moved to Pasadena from Palo Alto in 1964. I had offers from all the other universities as well. Cornell, I went to interview with them in April. There was half a foot of snow on the ground so that removed cornel from my list.\n\nZIERLER: That's even farther from the ocean than Bell Labs.\n\nYARIV: UC San Diego…\n\nZIERLER: Must've been brand new at that point.\n\nYARIV: Maybe five or six years old. They were too near the ocean. [laugh] Remember, I was a body surfer. You'll read about it in the title of the wave. I was a founding member of Israel's Agudat Tofsei Hagalim (The Wave catchers Association.) There were maybe 20 of us who would go body surfing in the winter, when big waves came.\n\nZIERLER: Oh, a polar bear.\n\nYARIV: Polar bears. Of course, the Mediterranean doesn't get as cold. [laugh] But still, it was probably 60 degrees or so, and no wetsuit.\n\nZIERLER: So San Diego, you wouldn't get any work done. You'd be in the ocean.\n\nYARIV: I probably wouldn't get any work done. [laugh] So I had to pass up San Diego. Berkeley was like going back home. Which some people like, some do not.\n\nZIERLER: You're a kid back home.\n\nYARIV: You're a kid. And so, I passed over Berkeley, although I was very happy at Berkeley as a student but going back seemed like never leaving home. That left Stanford. Stanford offered a position but they already had two laser scientists, good ones, so they wanted me to work on something else.\n\nZIERLER: What were these jobs you were applying for? Was there an applied physics program at any of these places yet?\n\nYARIV: No.\n\nZIERLER: Or were you applying in EE?\n\nYARIV: None. I applied to EE and physics. The offer at UC San Diego was in the Physics Department. Because I had already written a paper on quantum theory of nonlinear optics, which was very significant. It gave people the Hamiltonian. [laugh] How to treat problems involving a change of energy between optical waves taking place in crystals.\n\nZIERLER: So there's no applied physics programs anywhere yet?\n\nYARIV: Departments of applied physics did not exist. There were no faculties or programs anywhere, at least not designated as such. Caltech was the first one to offer it as an academic option. And Roy Gould and I started it.\n\nZIERLER: Where was Roy? Was he in EE or physics?\n\nYARIV: Roy got his PhD in physics but was in EE or maybe in both. Really, an exceedingly sharp and influential fellow. Jumping ahead a little bit, we came to Caltech, and I started a program. And there were plenty of good students who wanted to join the effort because there was great curiosity. There was actually a professor in EE who had done some early work before me, but he was really an EE., he made an helium-neon laser, which was a replica of what Bell Labs had done. But that was not his main interest or main capability. And there was a small effort here. It was based on physics and EE on crystals, up to date.\n\nZIERLER: In choosing Caltech, was JPL a factor for you?\n\nYARIV: No. I don't think I was aware of the connection between Caltech and JPL at that time.\n\nZIERLER: Did you take advantage of that connection later on ever?\n\nYARIV: Not really. What brought me to Caltech was Roy Gould. Roy was so good. I also liked him personally. When I visited here, I became aware of the academic stature of Caltech. Coming here, I realized it was probably a different school from the others that I mentioned. It was small, but with no boundaries. Students worked for which ever professor they wanted to, they didn't have to fill out forms, re-register, or whatever. Also, a center of aerospace, which I realized would be important for me. There was a huge, huge negative factor. Smog. It was the worst period for smog. And you have no idea how bad it was. I almost left Caltech during the first year because of the smog.\n\nZIERLER: Now, were you aware that there was a professor at Caltech hard at work to fix the problem?\n\nYARIV: No.\n\nZIERLER: What about Feynman? Was it attractive to you that he was here?\n\nYARIV: I didn't know who Feynman was. [laugh]\n\nBack to top\n\nThe Maser Revolution\n\nZIERLER: Feynman diagrams though.\n\nYARIV: Yes, I learned that later, even wrote a paper with the words Feynman Diagrams in the title. I actually learned a lot of that in those first few years. I wrote papers. I started teaching a class. Extremely ambitious. But I was young, 34. The physics, the mathematics, the quantum mechanics. At Berkeley, my education was really EE. I arrived at Berkeley in 1951. My plan was to be a power electrical engineer. Transformers, generation, transmission. Work for the power company. After two or three years in Berkeley, my interest shifted slowly but decisively away from power generation to microwaves and radio transmission. And the reason was, basically, a class I'd taken with John Whinnery, the same based on a text that he had written with Si Ramo on radio waves. A beautiful class, rigorous, mathematical. When I graduated in 1954, I joined John Whinnery's research group, that was working on traveling-wave tubes. It was interesting for a year or so, but that field really doesn't have the Maxwell or the Schrödinger equation, the rigorous mathematical foundation. It was more ad hoc.\n\nI became bored with that field, too. And then, in 1956, when I got my master's degree, John Whinnery asked if I would like to join him attending a conference probably because he thought that might help me in finding a new problem to work on for my PhD. The conference was called the Tube Conference, a small, by-invitation-only conference of maybe 30 or 40 people, met every year at a different place. The people who started it, the main movers in that little conference, came from traveling-wave tubes. Caltech, Stanford, and Berkeley. And they were mostly top notch. A wonderful group of people. But they would invite to every meeting annually somebody from a different field. John Whinnery asked me if I would like to join him in going to Boulder, Colorado, the site of that year's Tube Conference–they later changed the name–to The Device Research conference. About the research, which had concluded, looking at electron dynamics and traveling-wave tubes. He thought it would be interesting. John and I drove from Berkeley to Boulder, a two-day drive or so, and there, two scientists from Bell Labs gave a talk about an optical maser. I never heard about it before. And there, he made a maser.\n\nZIERLER: What was so exciting about the maser at that point? What did they want to convey?\n\nYARIV: They made a microwave maser, essentially a laser but operating at lower, microwave, frequency. It was exciting because it was understood to be potentially a very low-noise amplifier. Amplifiers are used to amplify weak signals, signals that have traveled long distances, from outer space. And to amplify a very weak signal, you need to be very careful not to swamp the signal with noise. And every amplifier adds noise. But classes of amplifiers among the masers or parametric amplifiers add the smallest amount of noise allowed by quantum mechanics. And that was understood. Masers was a very interesting area of research at that point. There were no lasers yet. And I did not understand what they did, the physics. But I could tell the area was elegant, and they gave a good talk. The two scientists were Feher and somebody else. Feher was actually an Israeli who got a PhD from Berkeley about four years before me, working for my thesis professor, John Whinnery.\n\nZIERLER: Did you know him?\n\nYARIV: Met him in Boulder.\n\nZIERLER: That was the first time.\n\nYARIV: First time. And I had already decided with John's agreement that for my PhD, I'd do something different. And part of the reason for inviting me to come to the meeting in Boulder was to maybe find another topic, talk to people. And indeed, I did. And of course, there was George Feher. He eventually joined UC San Diego. Very well-known in his own field, which was paramagnetic resonance. And I told him about my problem, and he invited me to come to Bell Labs and work in his lab. And I took him up on his offer, and John Whinnery made it financially possible. Then, I went to Bell Labs and worked with George Feher and learned about his field, the instrumentation, which was quite complicated, mostly microwave. Then, came back to Berkeley and built a system. I didn't have the money to buy the components. Much of it, I had to make myself. That's how I wound up moving from power transmission, generators, which was my aim when I left Israel, to lasers.\n\nZIERLER: Now, to give a sense of your sensibilities at this point, were you interested in the theory or more the applications of masers?\n\nYARIV: Let me go a step back. When I made the decision, remember, my background was two years of machinery and maybe another year or so working with microwaves, electron beams. Almost no physics, except a one-year, three-semester sequence of physics that all engineers have to take. Essentially, very little physics. And here, I was delving into a new area, which required quantum mechanics, solid-state physics. When I decided to work for my PhD on lasers after my master's degree in '56, I needed to learn graduate level physics. And I worked 20 hours a day. For a learning physics took undergraduate physics, nuclear physics, electromagnetic, quantum mechanics, solid-state physics, and advanced quantum mechanics, all in one year. And it was very interesting. The beauty of electromagnetic theory, Maxwell equations, and quantum mechanics and their coming together and that you start with a well-defined differential equations, Maxwell, Schrödinger. And I think that by my temperament, I needed something I could fall back on. And I did not find it in the other fields that I worked in. There was too much information. \"Oh, that's the way it's been done. It works.\" Here, you could always start from the Maxwell equation. And maybe I'm a Yekke.\n\nZIERLER: That's a German Jew, who in Israel have a reputation for being very finnicky for our audience, we should say. Somebody who's very precise.\n\nYARIV: Precise. They were much more satisfying. I think by temperament, I enough in my new field so that some of the professors wanted to recruit me and have me switch majors from EE to physics. I didn't do it, mostly, I think, out of loyalty to John Whinnery. And I saw no reason for doing it. I could take the classes. John promised to help me build an experimental system.\n\nZIERLER: Did you spend any time at the Rad Lab?\n\nYARIV: No. I'm not sure that the Rad Lab was–oh, yes, it was there. It was the only thing that was there. No, I did not. Actually, I've never been there physically. [laugh] A friend of mine ran it for a while. So when you ask me…\n\nZIERLER: About theory and application.\n\nYARIV: Applications were not even on the horizon. It was just interesting. I'm basically a researcher, I'm curious. But because of my background, had I started in physics as an undergrad, I very well might've wound up being a physics researcher. But I went for an engineering background. John Whinnery and his group. What we were doing was related directly to traveling-wave tubes and communications systems. And I found it very satisfying to work on problems that had both a physics background and application. And the appreciation and feel for waves that I acquired in my engineering classes was very important as well. And the rest of my career, the two are intertwined. I wrote a few papers in pure physics, like the quantum theory for nonlinear optic. The National Medal of Science I got was in physics, not in engineering, which is part of it also. And I was a member of the National Academy of Engineering and Sciences. I'm basically both.\n\nZIERLER: When you got here in 1964, what department were you hired into?\n\nYARIV: EE.\n\nZIERLER: Is that when you met Carver Mead?\n\nYARIV: Right away. As a matter of fact, my first work at Caltech was an experiment with Carver Mead, investigating the properties of a crystal, gallium arsenide, to modulate light. To do that, you need to understand the electrooptic effect the physical effect, which is used to modulate light in crystals. It's the change in the optical properties of the crystal when you apply a voltage, a field to it. And you use that to make modulate light. If you're interested, my texts in the laser applications book has maybe two chapters on the topic. That's how you can put information, a Netflix movie for example, to ride piggyback on a laser beam that travel on an optical fiber from new Virginia to LA. For some reason, I don't know how, Carver [Mead] and I met, resonated, became good friends, went to a conference in Europe together. He'll still tell you stories about my talking Yiddish in Denmark, and the waitress understanding my Yiddish. [laugh] And we wound up doing an experiment together. Carver was always curious. We published a paper, the first measurements of the electrooptical coefficient of gallium arsenide. I learned my quantum mechanics in one year from good teachers. Berkeley still had a good fraction of professors who developed the A bomb in Los Alamos. Oppenheimer, Lawrence, Teller, a few others. And it was fascinating to take classes from all of them. Emilio Segré, a whole bunch of Nobel laureates.\n\nZIERLER: With Gould, why the need to create an applied physics program in and of itself?\n\nYARIV: When I came to Caltech and started teaching classes in laser physics, forming a group to work in this field, the students who came to work for me were mostly physics students. Because the prerequisite, you needed quantum mechanics, and you needed electromagnetic theory. And the EEs who came usually had the electromagnetic Maxwell equations part of it, but most of them did not know quantum mechanics. And they came, and they stayed. The physics students got the degree in physics. There was no problem at Caltech. But at some point, it was clear that we needed a different type of student. A student with mostly a physics background, but interested in applications.\n\nLight modulation, light propagation in crystals requires solid-state physics. We needed a new type of student as a graduate student, even undergraduate, but with a strong background in physics, and not in elementary particle physics but solid-state physics and electrical engineering. But electrical engineering, the John Whinnery type, waves, not transformers. And that did not exist. Roy probably had a similar need, not quite as acute as mine. I don't think he needed quantum mechanics. I came to Roy Gould and told him about my problems. And he agreed to join me. And it didn't take too much problem to start a new option. I think we might have been the first applied physics program in a university. It took other schools years to follow, Stanford maybe 20 years. Eventually, every school had it. I think we were the model. We were very successful.\n\nBack to top\n\nJoining Caltech\n\nZIERLER: Did the program grow rapidly?\n\nYARIV: I think there was no time in which professors in applied physics could not get all the students they needed, even today. Yes. And we got some very good students. At some point, we got top students from the Physics Department. There were no boundaries, physics students could work for me without having to change departments.\n\nZIERLER: In terms of the students that you did get, if they were in physics, why would they have not gone to EE? Why would they have come to applied physics?\n\nYARIV: I don't think you'll find many physicists who will introduce themselves as electrical engineers, [laugh] even if they're doing electrical engineering in their career later on. They're physicists. It carries a bigger cachet, I think.\n\nZIERLER: Here, in applied physics…\n\nYARIV: Especially at Caltech. The students came here because of names like Feynman. But I think the thing that attracted the students from physics to my group was the intellectual challenge of quantum electronics, as the field was known at the time. Even today, quantum computing, the building blocks are lasers. There was an intellectual challenge there. Some people are attracted to elementary particles, other people to exchange of energy within light waves in crystals. Which requires quantum mechanics as well.\n\nZIERLER: Were there any computers on campus in 1964?\n\nYARIV: When I came to Caltech, I still have a mental image of people walking around the campus carrying stacks of IBM punch cards. But they came gradually. Maybe not as fast as at other places. Berkeley or University of Illinois.\n\nZIERLER: In setting up your lab, what were your major funding sources?\n\nYARIV: I got an initial grant and was able to buy some basic pieces of equipment. And then, during my half-year at Watkins-Johnson, before coming to Caltech, I obtained a few contracts from sponsoring agencies. And it was not too difficult. There was a great deal of curiosity in the sponsoring agencies on the Office of Naval Research, National Science Foundation. I had a few research grants, two or three. Roy Gould was very generous and shared with me a research grant he had from the Navy. I was able to set up a lab with two or three students. The number grew. We eventually obtained more support. At the height, we had probably over 20 students here, and five or six post-docs.\n\nZIERLER: Did you come in with tenure?\n\nYARIV: I came in as an associate professor without tenure, with the promise that my tenure would be considered two years later. Which it was, and I was promoted to professor. While I had offers of tenure and full professorship from Cornell. I came to Caltech, although it was probably the least attractive offer financially. And here was smog.\n\nZIERLER: When did the smog start getting better?\n\nYARIV: I came here 1964. I know it was more than ten years. Maybe 15, 20 years, when the regulations about not incinerating, unleaded gasoline, eliminating the additive. It was a gradual process, and it took time to see the mountains. You heard the jokes about Caltech, visitors coming here in May and in October when the smog diminished saying, \"We didn't realize there are mountains near Pasadena.\" [laugh]\n\nBack to top\n\nDARPA and Semiconductor Lasers\n\nZIERLER: What were the big questions that you were after when you were setting up your lab in Caltech? What were you most curious and excited about doing?\n\nYARIV: I started working right away on semiconductor lasers. I made a decision that these lasers are important and in time will become the most important. There is whole variety of lasers. Gas lasers that took up literally a tabletop like that based on argon, pumped by all kinds of means. And I decided individually, I probably was not alone, but maybe one of the very first to translate it into a career, that semiconductor lasers are going to be the most important lasers in the world. Why? Because they were electronic. Could be made with the technology as transistors. you could make them small and efficient. At Bell Labs, already, I had switched and there was a need for a superior and concentrated on semiconductor lasers. I had made lasers and thought it was a good topic. And the only topic I really understood fairly well.\n\nZIERLER: And if you can explain the name. There are semiconductors, and there are lasers. This is a semiconductor laser. What does that mean?\n\nYARIV: The lasers are not that different from transistors. Both can be made from layers of semiconductors of different properties. I also realized that you could make lasers, things you need to make a laser, to guide light, to amplify it, in semiconductor crystals. The very same crystals that can make transistors. Semiconductor lasers are driven by current. The idea that you could combine optics and electronics was probably my idea. I proposed it first in a international semiconductor conference in Japan in Japan, maybe 1966, '67, '68 on the feasibility of combining optics and lasers on single semiconductor crystals. A theoretical talk. And an American gentleman, Martin Stickley from DARPA, approached me after my presentation and asked me who supported the work. I said, \"Nobody. What you heard is the basic theoretical idea.\". He said, \"Are you interested in support?\" I said, \"Of course.\" [laugh] He wound up supporting my work for maybe 30, 40 years until he retired from DARPA.\n\nZIERLER: Was he thinking about national security applications?\n\nYARIV: DARPA by definition, the nature of the organization, is research of immediate or potential importance to national security.\n\nZIERLER: What could it have been? Why would this technology give the United States a military edge, theoretically?\n\nYARIV: DARPA has become more of a bookkeeping operation today. You have to tell them what it is that you will invent how much power, what efficiency, at the beginning. At that time, they were more adventurous. At least in the areas with which I was acquainted.\n\nZIERLER: Adventurous.\n\nYARIV: –adventurous. And each program manager–and the fellow who came to me over in Japan was a program manager–handles maybe a few million dollars. There were certain limits. You had to stay within the area of interest, to both DARPA and you. This meeting in Japan is a good example of DARPA in those days. Stickley was able to offer me support. I still had to submit a proposal with a budget etc. But he sensed that the idea of combining optics and electronics monolithically is worth supporting.\n\nZIERLER: Let's go even more fundamental now. Combining optics and electronics, what is optics before electronics? What does the field look like before it's joined with electronics by you?\n\nYARIV: Well, take a camera. In a camera, you have an image. If you take a photo of your daughter, light waves, sunlight, originates by reflection of a light source, sun or a lamp, in her face, reflecting from her face. The image thus formed propagates through the camera to a lens which images it on a film plane. And that was photography. It involves, essentially, propagation of light between optical components, lenses, film plane, light source in vacuum. You don't need air. It's not sound. And here, you're taking all of that and condensing it into a small area of volume. And the need to continue to refocus light if you want to send it from one place to another using lenses, is obviated here because the light is now guided in optical waveguides.\n\nOne of the papers that I gave you, the beginning of integrated optoelectronics, has a reprint or a description of a very early experiment at Bell Labs claiming that you could not have a laser without optical waveguiding. That optical waveguiding in the first generation of semiconductor lasers was not there by design and was due to the nature of the p-n junction. A fortunate accident. appreciating its origin and importance was probably the first step in recognizing the potential of wave guiding in what will emerge as the field of integrated optoelectronic circuits (or Integrated Photonics) there and do We perform an experiment that proves it. That was a key experiment. And semiconductor lasers, by then, nature guide light the difference of the index of refraction. There were a lot of physics in understanding the propagation of light and its manipulation in crystals. And then, nonlinear optics comes on the scene a little later, which is all about on exchange of energy between light waves and crystals and exchanging information. Probably the most interesting batch of laser physics is nonlinear optics.\n\nZIERLER: I'll flip the question. We talked about optics absent electronics. What about electronics absent optics? What did electronics look like before you merged them?\n\nYARIV: Well, electronics are doing fairly well without optics to this day. You hear about the chip shortage nowadays. Well, the chip shortage is a shortage of, essentially, electronic circuits, which do everything. Memory, storage, amplification, switching, logic operations. All using electrons. Electronics was already one of our major industries. No doubt, very important. And supremacy in electronics was considered a key aim of the US. Companies like IBM, GE, Texas Instruments. Electronics was OK. It didn't need optics. But optics needed electronics. I think now, electronics will need optics. It's clear. And what will do it is the ability to manufacture the whole thing, optoelectronics including lasers, lenses, optical components, by the same techniques, photo lithography used to make electronic circuits for mass production. That will happen. It's beginning to happen. And we proposed that in that. Proposed it in Japan, repeated it again in a talk. And, you see all the evidence, and the first demonstrations of that new technology will then appear.\n\nZIERLER: What year was that, the year of the talk in Japan?\n\nYARIV: Around 1968, plus or minus a year.\n\nZIERLER: Why was it important to do this in Japan?\n\nYARIV: Because the venue was that of the annual International Semiconductor Conference, which is mostly basic semiconductor physics and a little bit of transistors, and so on. And I was already working on semiconductor lasers here at Caltech at the time, and it was a natural place to present my ideas. I think the problem at that point was mostly semiconductor technology and physics.\n\nZIERLER: Was this more of a eureka moment for you, a gradual realization that optics and electronics needed to be merged?\n\nYARIV: Probably a eureka moment.\n\nZIERLER: Do you remember it?\n\nYARIV: I couldn't recreate it. I could fake it. [laugh]\n\nZIERLER: But it was sudden?\n\nYARIV: It was sudden. Carver Mead might have had something to do with it, but indirectly. I was working very heavily on semiconductor lasers because they were small. And semiconductor lasers are essentially like a transistor in many ways. And you connect a battery to it. And there comes light. And it was already understood that that process converting electrical energy to light energy could be very, very efficient. Non-laser experiments have shown that, like making light emitter diodes, the process was efficient. You could also convert the full energy of the electron. In a semiconductor laser, an electron is fed into a crystal in a high-energetic state in the conduction band and makes the jump across the energy gap, forbidden gap, to the valence band and gives you off the energy as a phot- light particle. I was already working in semiconductors. And the crystal of choice was gallium arsenide. Transistors were made then, and are still today, on silicon. Carver Mead was one of the few who made a transistor in gallium arsenide.\n\nZIERLER: Why gallium arsenide?\n\nYARIV: People learned how to make gallium arsenide of high quality. It was available up to a point. Not like today. I was working on gallium arsenide and learned that you could make a transistor in semiconductors, and we were already making lasers using them, so the idea of why not put them on the same, GaAs crystal in retrospect, seems an obvious thing to do. But at the time it was a eureka moment.\n\nZIERLER: In putting these two fields together, obviously, there are numerous challenges. Let's start with the theoretical challenges. There's obviously no theory guiding you, so what are you relying on to give you this intuition that this is going to work?\n\nYARIV: We knew how to make lasers on a semiconductor. This is a single crystal of gallium arsenide. It's not that big. And we knew that we could make a laser here, feed a current into it, and light would come out. We knew and we had already shown we could guide the light in GaAs. Well, a transistor can act as a switch. Why not make a transistor here? And feeding the current into the laser, the current can be turned on and off by an electrical signal in the transistor, and in the process, we modulate the light. Here's a way of putting information from an electrical signal, ones and zeroes, let's say, modulating current directly into a replica of light pulses. That's the essence, basically.\n\nThe major building blocks of that whole technology, and I mentioned three of them there, I can add a fourth one. Current comes from the outside. Current comes from electronics. And that will be the way to do it for a long time. Information is carried on a current as modulation of the current, AM or FM or digital and if that current is fed to the laser the information is imposed on the light as light modulation. The major building blocks are the transistor that modulates the current, a laser that emits light as a response to current, and then guiding it, and then maybe one or two others, but those are probably the major building blocks of an optoelectronic technology. And I'd been working on that one for two or three years at that point, and that one, and then I read somewhere that one can make transistors in the same material on which I'd already been working for a few years. That was the moment in which I thought, \"Why not try it together?\" I wrote a paper or two on that subject and got the money from DARPA.\n\nZIERLER: I asked you about the theory, now what about the technology? What were those technological challenges?\n\nYARIV: In traveling wave tubes the high frequency electronic wave to be amplified propagates around the helix and is amplified by the energetic electronics moving close to it. And we were probably with lasers in semiconductors because you have to learn how to grow layers high quality layers of controlled chemical composition. Same technology which was used in silicon. We had to learn how to make it in gallium arsenide, control its properties' dimensions. Forming the waveguides in gallium arsenide is difficult. And we had some ideas of properties of gallium arsenide can be used to make–my three or four years preceding coming to Caltech and deciding that was going to be the center of my research here, we acquired basic but early sufficient information to teach us how to make the lasers, how to make the waveguide. And now, I think, Carver must've had some background in making lasers in gallium arsenide. But people were now making them. We were the first university anywhere to make semiconductor lasers. There were very few industrial labs that could make them. We were very early in the game.\n\nAnd the people who taught us how to make them were Israelis. Of course, we took off from that. In fact, to understand the lasers, we learned how to make them, then understood the importance, and I repeat it all the time, of waveguiding. No waveguiding, no lasers. No nonlinear optics. Light has to be guided. When it's guided, it's also concentrated, so nonlinear effects become large. In one of the papers I gave you, you'll see pictures of those elements, combining a circuit. That's the proof you can guide light. That's Bell Labs, 1961, give or take. And here is the world's first integrated optoelectronic circuit, or photonic. [laugh] Here's the laser. That by itself would've been a good laser of that era. And current would be fed directly into the top. Here, the current comes from a transistor. Here's a transistor, and here's the laser, and everything here's a single crystal. It looks like many. If you look microscopically, the whole thing is a single crystal.\n\nZIERLER: So that's just a representation. It doesn't look like a bunch of rectangles.\n\nYARIV: Yes.\n\nZIERLER: Who were these Israelis? What was the connection?\n\nYARIV: RAFAEL is an acronym. It's the major R&D development of the Israeli Army. It's north of Haifa, about 10 miles or so. A few thousand people.\n\nZIERLER: Were you involved at all with them when you served?\n\nYARIV: No, I was not. I was in my second year at Bell Labs when the announcement of the first laser came out about the ruby laser, demonstrated by Theodore Maiman at the Hughes Research Labs in Malibu. But Bell Labs was very fast in replicating the experiment using a ruby laser. And I got an invitation from the Hebrew University to come and give a talk in Israel on lasers. It was the first lecture in Israel on lasers. I received permission from Bell Labs to carry one of the book-sized ruby lasers to Israel to demonstrate it in my lecture. And there were people there from RAFAEL, of course. It was in an auditorium at the campus of the Hebrew University in Jerusalem. Maybe 1,000 people. Very difficult to get in. They refused to let me in, I looked so young. When I told them I was the lecturer, they didn't believe it. [laugh] Anyhow, my father was there. It was very important. And RAFAEL was there, so they knew about me. But obviously, I couldn't work for them. And then, a couple of years later, they had started an effort to learn how to grow some gallium arsenide lasers, that early, in RAFAEL.\n\nAnd even made some lasers. And two of those scientists were looking for a place to spend a sabbatical, which they earned. And they wrote me, and it was a match made in heaven. Two of them came to Caltech, spent two years, and taught us how to grow the gallium arsenide and make simple lasers. Today, it's done by other technique. But then, it was the only way of doing it. And our lab was the second university in the world, the first was the Technion in Haifa led by Margalit, to make semiconductor lasers, and only three or four industrial labs.\n\nZIERLER: What were DARPA's expectations of you? What did they want to see you do?\n\nYARIV: Not much. Really, this was entrepreneurial at that time. They gave the individual program managers so much leeway, and they never asked for anything. Of course, our work started making waves. [laugh] And they were satisfied by being part of it, getting the credit. There was never any expectation. And the program manager supported us throughout his whole career in DARPA. After he left, of course, we had to deal with other people, and DARPA changed. They became more about being bookkeepers and probably less daring or risk taking than they used to be in terms of great ideas like the internet.\n\nZIERLER: As you say, when your work started to make waves, how so? Who was paying attention? What was interesting?\n\nYARIV: Everybody. At some point, it was clear that lasers would be important for communication. Communication, coast to coast, was still done by means of microwave repeaters, huge parabolic antennas on hilltops spaced some 30 miles apart coast-to-coast, transmitting microwave signals, amplifying them in between using traveling-wave tubes. And that was the first coast-to-coast, long-distance communication. That was the state of affairs in 1960. Then, the first proposal to use lasers, but not semiconductor lasers. They needed a transmission and taking advantage of the shorter wavelength of light. They considered, essentially, long tubes, maybe a few inches in diameter, with lenses, so the light beam would be refocused. These are the tubes, and the conventional lenses, and a light beam will do something like that. Coast to coast. And amplifiers in between.\n\nAnd then, of course, somebody came up with the idea that you could use optical fibers, A newly graduated PhD, Charles Kao at University College London (who later got a Nobel Prize for it in 2009), and Corning demonstrated optical fibers with a loss of 20 decibels per on kilometer, or in plain English, a loss of 99 percent per kilometer in 1 km which was considered a great step. All the other approaches were abandoned and they started working on fiber communication systems. And it was clear now that the semiconductor laser was the light source for the beam carrying the information. Fibers had the minimum losses, the optimal wavelength at which the absorption in the fiber was the lowest, which enabled you to go longer distances. It was about 1.5 microns, which is infrared. The semiconductor lasers were the best source of light for optical fiber communications. All that information is going, and major labs are beginning to do that. At Bell Labs, the semiconductor laser was becoming very important. And we are, at first, the only university that works on the light source.\n\nBut the semiconductor lasers, and we are jumping ahead a bit, emit–if you took the light emitted by a semiconductor laser and passed it through a spectrometer, you'd find five or six different wavelengths. A semiconductor laser is like a piano, where you can hear the first harmonic, second harmonic simultaneously when you strike a chord. Anyhow, you can hear many modes. And at first, that's no problem. you can live with it. But as the transmitted data rate increases from 100 megahertz, to 500, to a gigahertz, the fact that the laser emits simultaneously more than one wavelength rather than a single wavelength puts a limit on how far we can go. Because each one of those wavelengths, propagates at different velocity. Group velocity, the magical word. Remember, you communicate with ones and zeroes each requiring a band of optical frequencies to make it. That's what you are transmitting: groups of frequencies (you will find the basic Fourier math in my texts).\n\nBut each one of those pulses is made up of all the different wavelengths, each propagating with its own velocity. The result is that nice rectangular wave shape widens with distance. Eventually, they begin to overlap, and the distinction between ones and zeroes is lost. That becomes the limit on the data rate. And they also understand that that's due to the multi wavelength. The cry goes out from the engineers at Western Electric, which is the arm of AT&T that makes equipment, makes lasers, to the research lab at Murray Hill, \"We want lasers of one wavelength.\" Of course, there's a major effort to make it. And Bell Labs comes up with a solution involving two big boxes full of optics and electronics to solve this problem, and they called a major press conference in New York. And we saw very same semiconductors that we are making, but with a difference in growing the layers.\n\nThe whole thing is, you need a magnifying glass. One of the interfaces is wavy. And that forces that laser to emit only one wavelength. And what determines the wavelength is the pitch, the distance here, the period. That's all described in detail in the articles. So we win the race. It's a major race. When Bell Labs invented a two-box solution, tabletop size, they announce and hold a press conference in Manhattan, which is advertised as the first press conference since the invention of the transistor. It's that important. When I saw those two boxes, I said, \"That cannot survive.\"\n\nZIERLER: Why not?\n\nYARIV: We're talking about electronics. We already have transistors and so on. But independently of that, in addition to making semiconductor lasers, we have a research effort that is theoretical on how light propagates in periodic structures. And this is a periodic structure. And we analyzed purely theoretically what would happen if you took a fiber as an example and made it wavy. Make some property like the index of refraction. As a result, it begins to act as a filter. It will only allow certain frequencies to propagate and not others. Every laser needs a waveguide, a feedback mechanism and gain (amplification of the light). In a way we knew the basic idea of wave propagation in periodic structures already. The mathematics is similar to the electron wave functions in crystals which are periodic structures, and act as filters to the electron wave function. In crystals you grow the layers, interrupted the growth. It's done in a furnace. And using photo lithography to Corrugate the surface, make it wavy, and then put it back in the furnace and finish the growth of the remaining layers. And you've got a semiconductor distributed feedback laser.\n\nWe made it right here. We had to go over to an electronic company in east Pasadena, who taught us how to do photo lithography. The period (the distance between two peaks is roughly 0.5 microns, very small). We do photo lithography. We take another laser, emitting short wavelengths, which could be a violet or slightly ultraviolet, and shine it on a thin layer of a photosensitive (light sensitive) which I coated a crystalline surface. And when you have two light waves meeting each other, or two microwaves, you get standing waves. And you can control the period by controlling the angle. So we found a UV laser for that purpose and learned how to corrugate the surface and how to control the wavelength. The lasers emitted one wavelength equal to twice the corrugation peak to peak distance. It's a key technology. Used until today to make lasers for optical we didn't know yet how to fit current, so we pump it, we excite it, and out comes one wave. The same without corrugation has many waves.\n\nThat was our solution, and it blew Bell Labs out of the water completely. Got to a point when the researchers know now that you can make a semiconductor laser without mirrors, without boxes. They demanded it. But Bell Labs didn't know how to make it. The team that made it at Caltech was two or three graduate students and a Japanese post-doc. Actually, he was a pre-doc, but a Japanese scientist who was here for a year. And he went back to Japan and convinced his company to make those lasers commercially. The first commercial lasers.\n\nZIERLER: And what year was that?\n\nYARIV: The talk I gave in Japan was 1971. Active integrated optics, active meaning transistors. Nakamura is the Japanese, Garmire, Somekh, Israel Ury, Yariv and Garvin. Optically pumped gallium arsenide waveguide lasers with a fundamental 0.11 corrugation feedback. September 1973, the first demonstration. Probably I can give you photos of the very first experiment, show you that feedback principle.\n\nBack to top\n\nCommunications Potential in Optics\n\nZIERLER: When you said that you recognized the possibilities for communications, what was the infrastructure that was available?\n\nYARIV: People at Bell Labs and others recognized the importance of semiconductor lasers for communication, mostly because of size and efficiency. And maybe this leads to modulator.\n\nZIERLER: My question is, what's the infrastructure? You have the technology, but you need an infrastructure built to support the technology. What was lacking? What needed to be built in terms of infrastructure in society to make this feasible?\n\nYARIV: The ability to grow high-quality, multi-layer semiconductors. And then, using photo lithography, carve out different devices is the key. Even today, the technology is very important, very difficult. To make layered semiconductor structures today, at a university, is a multimillion-dollar effort. And we required special convincing of Caltech to give us the money to do it. The growth of crystals, the optical equipment to measure the properties of the lasers, but I would say the biggest hurdle was semiconductor-controlled crystal growth. Controlled both in dimension and in the properties of the layers, And the ability to then fashion it into devices by photo lithography. Same techniques which are key today to integrated electronics. When you read about the shortages in electronic chips, about one or two bottlenecks, all the advanced electronics in the world, 80% of it is made by a company in Taiwan, and the remaining 20% by Samsung.\n\nAnd they all depend on photo lithography. And for that, you need short wavelengths with at that time probably the wavelengths in the visible part. And that's all done by one Dutch company. And installation. The Dutch company sells a system maybe for $100 million. You are talking about very expensive, probably the most advanced of our technologies. And we are essentially grappling with trying to build those very simple systems at Caltech in the 70s. And we do.\n\nBack to top\n\nScience and Shower Thoughts\n\nZIERLER: We'll return to growing crystals in our next talk. But my last question for today, to bring the conversation into the 21st century, tell me about the epiphany you had in the shower, looking at the way that the water was behaving coming out of your shower head. Tell me about this current research interest of yours.\n\nYARIV: [laugh] Well, it's not a research interest anymore. I think the research is mostly done. Well, at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, I spent a lot of time at home. And it was also a very warm summer in Pasadena. I was taking a lot of showers to stay cool. [laugh] And the shower that I use at home consists of a shower head, a big circular disc at the end of a long, flexible tube. Flexible both in its ability to vibrate left and right like a pendulum, but also in the ability to twist. If you twist it, it snaps back. It's capable of performing two dances, the pendulum dance and a twist. And it can be fixed to the wall, so it acts as a normal shower, or it can hang loose at the end of the fitting tube. And the day in question, the eureka day, I'm taking a shower, and it's hanging down.\n\nI turn the water on, and the thing begins to dance, go all over the place, hitting the wall. Had to restrain it so it doesn't chip the wall. And then, cutting the water down, and finding out that the process is gradual. If I turned the water on, and I tried to excite the motion, nothing happened. It would vibrate, and then it would die down. But at a certain well-defined threshold of water pressure, water force, the things begin to oscillate, twist, and vibrate slightly. And trying to understand what was going on there, I probably have spent hundreds of hours over the last year and a half or so. That probably took place somewhere in May or June of 2020.\n\nZIERLER: What was the shower head telling you?\n\nYARIV: The key thing, when I turned the water on, if you imagine your shower head whose surface hangs next to a wall. The wall is maybe five inches away. It's hanging down next to a wall. When water first comes out, the reaction force, water goes forward toward the wall, which is only a few inches away. The reaction force on the shower head pushes it away from the wall. As much as a foot. But at the same time, it also twists a bit. Because I guess the distribution of holes from which water emerges is not uniform, so more water's coming out of the left side. The result is, there's more force on one side. In addition to being forced back by the reaction force of the water, like jet propulsion, it twists. And it'll stay there, with the water on, away from the wall, steady state and twisted. And you increase the water flow even higher and give it a slight nudge left or right, it goes into the joint tango.\n\nZIERLER: The twist and the pendulum.\n\nYARIV: Exactly. At the time, I was not thinking I'd discovered a new phenomenon, but very early, I learned that the two had to be there together. If I had, with just the touch of a finger, stopped the pendulum oscillation, the twists stopped and vice versa. And I've spent all my scientific life, to a point, learning about waves, resonances, and quantum mechanics. There are two natural modes of vibration here of a system. One is the twisting oscillation, the other is the pendulum. Each one can exist on its own, theoretically. Once you nudge a pendulum, it'll go on for a while. Eventually, the friction or the air resistance will kill it off. Same goes with the twisting. If you had a body at the end of a coiled spring, and you twist it, it will twist back and forth. The mathematics are identical to that of the pendulum, the restoring force.\n\nYou have a system now with two natural modes of vibration that theoretically can exist all by themselves. And here, they obviously exist simultaneously and require co-oscillate to exist. And water. The energy source is obviously the water. And it was also clean [laugh]–that each one of the modes excited the other. Well, it was almost immediately obvious why the twisting generates in the presence of the water reaction force excites the pendulum motion. And you will see it in the differential equations. What is not clear is how the pendulum vibration excites the twist – it is not at all obvious. But my crazy mixed background–you'll see in my text, I have a chapter on parametrics. An English physicist, Lord Rayleigh, maybe 150 years ago or so, proposed that if you can take any vibrating system, like the pendulum, or any electronic RLC circuit, or a twist oscillator, and modulate–so you have a system that can do that without friction a long time, and that requires a force.\n\nYou always need a force, like a mother in a playground, pushing her son. But if you can modulate a parameter of the system, like in this case, its mass–imagine you can modulate the mass. Or modulate gravity. And modulate at twice the natural frequency than the thing can be set into oscillation as well. And that's another way of exciting oscillation. And that's parametric. And that's Lord Rayleigh. I knew that very well. I have a chapter in my textbook. I found it fascinating. The first question I needed to answer was, how does that motion excite that one? Well, maybe parametrically. Parametrics require that that motion will modulate some parameter involved in the twisting. And that's the twisting spring constant. If you have a spring, and you pull it, the force it tries to bring it back is proportionate to a spring constant times the elongation.\n\nIn this situation, there's a torsional spring here. When you turn it, the spring tries to bring it back, and the constant relating the angular displacement to the force is the twist spring constant. The idea is that this oscillator, which depends on the springiness, which returns it back, and that depends on where it is in pendulum cycle. As it oscillates, it does that. But Rayleigh had shown that you needed the modulation to be at twice the frequency. Where's the twice? That is generated by a nonlinearity in the parametric relation, Simple trigonometry. That is the basis of nonlinear optics nonlinear optics. I had already done the quantum analysis of nonlinear optics. Nonlinear, meaning the spring constant depends not only on x but on x squared. And when an optical wave propagates through a crystal with a second optical nonlinear coefficient some of the wave energy is converted to a new wave, which oscillated at twice the frequency. We call this second harmonic generation. The conclusion is that oscillations that cannot be excited on their own can be excited if they are will to collaborate. Like Argentinian tango! If you have a nonlinear element, which responds not only to the first power of an input but to the second power, and if you feed in cosign omega t, you're going to get out a DC term 1 plus cosign 2 omega t. You double the frequency. If the property of this twisting, the decay, depends on displacement, it's a nonlinearity. Usually, the k is a good number. If you do what I've done here, you see that if you now modulate the displacement at omega t, the force will be at twice the frequency. That's the basis of all of nonlinear optics. The twisting oscillation excites the pendulum, and the pendulum excites parametrically the twisting. And the source of the energy, the power, is the water.\n\nZIERLER: And as far as you know, this has never been observed before?\n\nYARIV: It's probably been observed but not understood before. [laugh]\n\nZIERLER: Are you going to write this up?\n\nYARIV: Oh, yes. Oh, of course.\n\nZIERLER: Wonderful.\n\nYARIV: I consider that fundamentally very important. Because nature is full of those frustrated dancers waiting for partners and once they find them go crazy and bring down buildings, bridges, the Tacoma Narrows bridge maybe. It would be too much to ask that the shower head on 480 Madeline in Pasadena is the one I've actually done the theory completely, and I have to write it. I have a big file. [laugh]\n\nZIERLER: And all it took was a hot summer during the pandemic.\n\nYARIV: Exactly.\n\nZIERLER: That's a great place to pick up for next time.\n\nYARIV: OK.\n\n[End of Recording]\n\nZIERLER: OK, this is David Zierler, Director of the Caltech Heritage Project. It's Tuesday, November 2, 2021. It is my great pleasure to be back with Professor Amnon Yariv. Amnon, good to be with you again.\n\nYARIV: Pleasure is mutual.\n\nZIERLER: Today, I want to discuss the intellectual, technological, and engineering origins of semiconductor integrated optoelectronics. And for that, let's go all the way back to Berkeley, perhaps as far as back as undergraduate or graduate. What is your exposure to the origins of what this field would become while you were a student?\n\nYARIV: Well, Berkeley really enters in a fairly minor way. I probably told you the story about halfway through my graduate research, I stayed in Berkeley, which puts it roughly 1958, give or take. In switching over from EE to physics, I took a lot of courses, and among them, solid-state physics, taught by Charles Kittel. Good class. Studied about Bloch's theorem, solid-state physics, energy gaps, my exposure to semiconductors was simply in the classes I took. I simply had to cover the physics curriculum, which I did in about a year.\n\nZIERLER: Did you interact with Marvin Cohen at all at Berkeley?\n\nYARIV: No. Mostly with Kittel. Also, an experimentalist, Professor Irwin Hahn working with Kittel. A bunch of solid-state, magnetic resonance types.\n\nZIERLER: What was Kittel doing at that time?\n\nYARIV: I don't know really because I just took the class from him. I think he was doing maybe his most important achievement. To me, it was known, mostly, to people he wrote a very good book. And the fact that he would come every few years with a new edition, which was worse than the last edition. [laugh] The first one was the best. I was introduced formally to solid-state physics, took the class, but did little or nothing with it for the remainder of my graduate research at Berkeley. What I did was make a maser. And then, a two-level optical laser.\n\nZIERLER: Two-level means what?\n\nYARIV: A laser works on having two levels, charcoal two and one. Those are two energy levels of an atom, electron, among a lot of other levels, and a ground state, the lowest level. And somehow, you've managed to establish populations N1, N2 and of atoms in the three levels. And if N2 is bigger than N1, and you can achieve it by selective pumping into the levels and taking advantage of relaxation times of the electrons in each level, if this difference is big enough, the material can act as an amplifier. Light propagating through the crystal, if it is a crystal, will be amplified. That's a three-level system. Often, there's another level here, and the pumping mechanism the ground state, zero, to level three, and then they relax very quickly.\n\nIt's a way of populating the upper level. two-level. You still have to satisfy the condition N2 bigger than N1. It's called population inversion. That's a condition for gain. I use the word gain and amplification interchangeably. But that's done by a process called adiabatic fast passage. It turns out that if you have a normal state, atoms, electrons, will occupy the lowest available state, ground state. Level zero. But in adiabatic fast passage, for instance, those two levels could be the two split spin states of an electron in a magnetic field. In a magnetic field, and the electrons spin up, spin down, the two states will separate in energy by an amount equal to the magnetron times the magnetic field. You apply a magnetic field, you take a level, which is doubly degenerate, and split it, spin up, spin down, and those become the two laser levels. And of course, the task now is to transfer all the atoms from here to here, and that's done by a process called adiabatic fast passage. Very important process. While keeping the magnetic field down, you vary the microwave field that connects the two quickly, and the result is to exchange population.\n\nZIERLER: Did you understand all of this as a graduate student? Or what you're telling me now is retrospective, what you came to understand?\n\nYARIV: No, that's my thesis. I have a copy of that somewhere. I did not invent adiabatic fast passage. You actually can read about it in a very good textbook, Schiff's quantum mechanics textbook, which was my textbook. That was known. But applying it to obtain inversion in a laser was done by the two scientists, Feher and another scientist, at Bell Labs who gave the talk about Boulder that essentially converted me.\n\nZIERLER: When was this talk?\n\nYARIV: 1956.\n\nZIERLER: Were you there?\n\nYARIV: Yes.\n\nZIERLER: What was the excitement? What did they have to say?\n\nYARIV: I told you about my graduate advisor, Professor Whinnery, and I driving from Berkeley to Boulder. 1956, I had done my master's thesis on an area related to John Whinnery's research, traveling-wave tubes. I decided that I did not want to continue doing my PhD in that field. It was understood I would do a PhD with John Whinnery, but that was his field. And he suggested that I come with him to an annual meeting, called the Tube Conference at that time, because the people there who started it were the leading experts in traveling-wave tubes. But the meeting was more eclectic. It hardly dealt with traveling wave tubes. All kinds of interesting people, like from Bell Labs, came and gave talks.\n\nZIERLER: And why Boulder? Was NIST there already?\n\nYARIV: No, they moved around, every year in a different place. NIST wasn't there yet. It was still the Bureau of Standards in Washington. That's where I heard George Feher, the Israeli who got a PhD from Berkeley then went to Bell Labs, and then invited me. I spent a couple of weeks with Feher showing me how to do the basic equipment and experimentation is that of paramagnetic resonance, energy levels of spins, nuclear or electron spins, in magnetic fields. And now, you can do spectroscopy. MRI is based on that process and the laser, which they described. But it was a pulsed laser. You inverted a population, you observed lasing, and had to do it again. But it established the principle.\n\nZIERLER: Was Norman Ramsey already in on his NMR work at this point?\n\nYARIV: Yes. That was a microwave maser, not a laser. But the principles were the same. The theory of lasers is very much that of microwave resonance.\n\nZIERLER: Let's focus on that a little bit right now, the mid-1950s. What are the theories that are guiding laser research at this point? What are the big hypotheses or theories?\n\nYARIV: The maser is around already. Meaning like a laser, but oscillating, emitting at microwave frequencies, not optical, which are about a factor of 10,000 smaller than optical frequencies. And the main interest in the maser is low-noise amplification. Amplifiers that add as little noise power as possible to the weak signals which they amplify. In 1968, possibly, there's a paper by Townes and Schawlow about the possibility of obtaining maser action at optical frequencies. Before that, there is no work, really–maybe some in Russia–on the laser, the optical version. The talk I heard was about the maser, the two-level. And the principles were essentially the same as of magnetic resonance, same theory about the difference of N2 is bigger than N1, ordinary resonance, magnetic resonance. MRI, N2 is smaller than N1. So I went to Berkeley and essentially built a system.\n\nZIERLER: You loved this, this was what you wanted to work on.\n\nYARIV: Well, I made a decision. Yes, I liked it because it used physics. EE as a major didn't satisfy me because I don't have a good memory. Never did. Also, the way you learn, even in high school, was in systems, the principles. And physics was simple. There are the Maxwell Equations for wave propagation and confinement [laugh], the Schrödinger equation for the atoms and that's it. You didn't have to remember too many things. In elementary school, I almost flunked math because I did not get the principle. [laugh] I don't think I'd ever run into anything as elegant as the Maxwell equations, quantum mechanics. It's all a few equations. So yes, I decided to then do my PhD in that field.\n\nBack to top\n\nBell Labs and Returning to Berkeley\n\nZIERLER: Now, the talk, with them coming from Bell Labs, were they thinking about applications at that point? Or this was all basic science?\n\nYARIV: They were in the basic research department. George Feher was in the solid-state research department, working actually on semiconductors. No, they were not thinking about applications, not at all. Oh, yes, the second person was Harold Seidel. A good solid-state guy. And he was more of the engineer of the two. George had graduated from high school in Haifa, Israel, born in Hungary, and when he graduated from high school, he wanted to study at Technion. They wouldn't accept him because his Hebrew wasn't good enough. He flunked it. [laugh] He went to Berkeley. Became world-famous.\n\nZIERLER: So you come back to Berkeley. What's the plan? First of all, what instruments are off the shelf, and what do you need to build yourself to make this work?\n\nYARIV: There's hardly anything off the shelf. And what's more, things which I could've bought, like a magnet made by Varian Associates in Palo Alto. I think it cost $10,000 even then. Big magnet. We didn't have the money, so I made it.\n\nZIERLER: What were your funding sources? Who funded the research?\n\nYARIV: John Whinnery.\n\nZIERLER: He had an NSF grant?\n\nYARIV: I wasn't familiar with his economics or finances, but he had a group of maybe seven, eight graduate students, and that supported the research. He was also very well-connected. He was really prominent in the field of microwave traveling wave tube amplifiers, which was important. John Pierce was deeply interested, and a bunch of other very good people. And they were so prestigious that the annual tube conference attracted some very, very good people. He supported me. I didn't ask him where the money came from. But it meant that a lot of stuff that could've been bought, I built. The sample was in a microwave cavity inside a small metallic box was at liquid helium temperature. I actually built the transfer system. I remember looking up tables of tubes with below thermal conductivity [laugh]. But I had some good support.\n\nZIERLER: Tell me about building the transfer system. How do you go about doing that?\n\nYARIV: You get the helium. The Physics Department, which was a building away from my building–I was in Cory Hall, which is the western edge of the campus at Berkeley–and they had a setup for making liquid helium. But they did not deliver it. I bought a big one on wheels. They come on wheels because they have to be pushed all around the building. And I had it filled maybe once every two or three weeks in the Physics Department, had to pay for it. And they pushed it, for the space, maybe 200 or 300 yards between the buildings to my lab. It was made by the glass blowers in our building had liquid nitrogen outside as an outer jacket around the liquid helium, and then there was essentially a bottle within the bottle. And the inner bottle had the helium in it.\n\nZIERLER: Why did you need the outer jacket?\n\nYARIV: To simply keep the liquid helium. If you just poured liquid helium, the heat conductivity through the glass for the top, the air, whatever, will make it evaporate in a few minutes. Natural liquid helium at atmospheric pressure has a boiling point of 4.2 degrees kelvin. The room temperature difference in degrees kelvin was about 300 degrees. And it's expensive. And liquid nitrogen is about 78 or 80 degrees. It pre-cools it. Liquid nitrogen is relatively inexpensive. You pre-cool it, and then it can last maybe a few days. But of course, you have to transfer it from the storage tank on wheels into the inner tube. While the helium is being transferred under pressure, it can also boil off. I had to look up a list of metals or alloys with very low thermal conductivity so that while the helium is transferred, it doesn't get warm. Became an engineer learning about heat transfer, how long helium will last, and so on.\n\nZIERLER: Were there safety precautions you needed to consider for this research?\n\nYARIV: No, because neither nitrogen nor helium are dangerous. Nitrogen is in the atmosphere, and helium is inert. So no. But there were some experiments later where I used liquid oxygen, and at Caltech when I first arrived, I used liquid oxygen, and that was tricky. Because that's explosive. Out of the two years, 1956 to '58, I probably spent much of it building equipment with help. John Whinnery's group, fortunately, was big enough, and his finances were good enough, that there were two people in the group, one was a microwave engineer type, and the other was a mechanic who could make anything work. He was very crucial. And they helped. It took about a year, year and a half to build the equipment.\n\nZIERLER: We didn't finish on the helium and the transfer system. What's the next step? You get the helium…\n\nYARIV: Well, I will actually show you my PhD thesis at some point, and you'll see photos I took myself of my equipment. It is essentially two evacuated dewars inside each other the outer containing liquid nitrogen and the inner one liquid helium. The whole contraption rested on wheels which I wheeled every few days to here, you have liquid nitrogen, and in here, liquid helium. And here's the tank with the wheels with liquid helium, which I obtained in the Physics Department. They filled it for me, and I wheeled it over to our building. And the transfer system, simply a transfer tube made of low thermal conductivity metal. Apply pressure on the helium, and helium as liquid will be transferred. Into the inner volume bathing the crystal the laser This was already pre-filled with nitrogen. The liquid helium is contained in a big thermos bottle, a dewar, which as been pumped out (evacuated) glass jacket and is filled with liquid nitrogen, a similar but smaller dewar is placed inside the bigger dewar and the liquid helium is transferred and stored in this second, smaller dewar. It evaporates quickly, in a couple of days, so the experiments have to be performed quickly. That's the cryogenic part of the system. Let's zero in on this part right here. Here, you had essentially a metallic can, and the crystal was here.\n\nZIERLER: What's the crystal?\n\nYARIVL: The \"defect\" i.e., the change locally crystal structure in the crystal in that it is s an interruption of the perfectly periodic, repeating structure of the crystal. The defect acts as an atom with a little magnetic dipole which can point up. Or down. I had to buy the crystal, send it to the nuclear facility in Washington state to be irradiated. All the details are in my articles of that period and the thesis, which I'll lend you a copy. Here, there was a whole rack of electronics and other things. The result is, from that box, you got microwave radiation coming out into the metallic waveguide. And this box acted as a microwave oscillator. And in particular, we used a pound-stabilized microwave oscillator. This was a resonator, essentially a metallic can, like a soup can. And it had resonance at the frequency that we were investigating. Like a piano string vibrating in resonance when struck so that there is exactly an integer number of half wavelengths along its length and that determines the frequency of vibration. So the defects are in the Mgo crystal inside the resonator, (can) cooled down to 4.2 degrees Kelvin in a magnetic field. Each defect is like a little magnet pointing against the magnetic field of the big magnet. We used the microwave and extra electronics to perform an adiabatic fast passage which flips the direction of the defect magnets which in the process gains a fixed amount of energy and because they are situated inside the high Q r(low loss) metallic can (resonator) they flip to their original position and in the process give back the excess energy as a pulse of microwave radiation. That what the Maser does. The threshold, the number of defects that you need to invert to get oscillation–the crystal was here, and I told you that we had obtained this condition called population inversion because N2 is bigger than N1. Normally, it'd be the opposite. That's an abnormal condition. To obtain it, we had another box generating, at times, a very magnetic field.\n\nZIERLER: Why is that an abnormal condition?\n\nYARIV: At thermal equilibrium, low level–t's a Boltzmann distribution. Thermodynamics. In equilibrium, N2 of N1 is equal to E. You have two levels separated by N energy. Delta E. Energy separation. In our case, the separation is brought about by a magnetic field. And it's proportionate to magnetic field. You have two levels, meaning they have the same energy but different function. There are two different energy levels. And they separate in energy when you apply a magnetic field. And that separation is proportional to the magnetic field. And you subject them to a microwave field, the frequency omega. Resonance is when delta E is equal to E2. Those are the energy two levels. E2 minus E1 is equal to H bar omega, where H bar the Planck constant. This is the microwave resonance condition.\n\nYou turn on the magnetic field, and then this microwave tube, the high Q, is designed to resonate at a given frequency. And you tune the big box here to emit a frequency equal to that frequency, which resonates. And then, you turn the magnetic field on until this condition is met. Then, you are in resonance. Meaning that the magnetic field separation of the two levels from here to here is equal to H bar omega. Or the microwave photon energy is equal to H bar omega. MRI was called initially nuclear magnetic resonance. People didn't like the way nuclear sounded. It's basically the exact same principle, except that the two levels here are not electronic spin levels but nuclear magnetic normal. But it's the same thing, same theory.\n\nZIERLER: Was Whinnery involved closely in what you were doing?\n\nYARIV: Essentially, not at all.\n\nZIERLER: It was beyond his area of expertise in any regard?\n\nYARIV: It was not his area, and he was a pure electrical engineer. He spent the War years in Schenectady at the GE Research Lab with Si Ramo, and he wrote this very famous and good book on microwave engineering. And they were involved in microwave engineering. And then, he came to Berkeley and worked on traveling-wave tubes, which, again, were microwaves. He had basically no experience in this area.\n\nZIERLER: And were you all by yourself with this? Did you have any graduate students who were helping you?\n\nYARIV: I was in the building called Cory Hall, the main building then, of Electrical Engineering at Berkeley. No one there understood what I was doing. But what's worse, the physics professors didn't know what I was talking about. Lasers, masers, you can amplify light–they were just involved in putting in a magnetic field.\n\nZIERLER: So you were all by yourself.\n\nYARIV: I was all by myself.\n\nZIERLER: I'm not sure if you know, but Tom Rosenbaum, for his graduate work at Princeton, he spent nearly all of his time at Bell Labs, even though he was a graduate student at Princeton. Bell Labs was the spot for him. That's where he hung out most of the time.\n\nYARIV: It's only 10 or 20 miles away.\n\nZIERLER: Of course. That made it easy. My question for you is, did you ever want to just be among people who knew what you were doing, which obviously could not be accomplished at Berkeley? Or was it good for you intellectually to do all of this by yourself?\n\nYARIV: I didn't have a choice. [laugh] So I never considered the alternative. There was a professor at Berkeley, Alan Portis, who actually was also in magnetic resonance who closest by his main interests were elsewhere. It is fair to say that nobody in Berkley understood what I was doing or even the fact that resonance is infinitely narrow. John Whinnery really felt bad for me that I was alone. In retrospect I do not think it was a bad thing, I did not have to \"educate\" a professor about laser physics which as a discipline did not exist yet. It also made the approval of my thesis easier and faster.\n\nZIERLER: How long did it take you before you realized you had something that was working?\n\nYARIV: I probably spent a year and a half building equipment and learning how to use it. Every aspect of this problem. I needed to build a magnet. This microwave cavity inside the dewar with the sample is placed between the pole faces in a magnetic field of 10,000 gauss, I designed and built the microwave equipment with the help of George Becker and Fred Clap, (the microwave expert), the microwave system I was a major experimental setup. Far more difficult than anything any of my students ever did. I came from an academic high school with very little experimental background, hands on. Building this system was an experience I will never forget it.\n\nBack to top\n\nLaser Breakthrough\n\nZIERLER: What were the goals? Not only at what point did you know that this system was working, but what goals did you have in mind to test if it was success, the research was worth it?\n\nYARIV: I think I got a feeling that if I could just get lasing–lasers and masers were so new, and there was essentially almost zero work at universities all anywhere. One exception was Columbia, where Charlie Townes invented the laser, and a superb student of his, eventually my boss at Bell Labs, Jim Gordon, succeeded in making an ammonia maser, again, at low frequencies. With that exception, making anything of that sort, getting laser action at a university–that's basically what I did.\n\nZIERLER: So just getting it to work was your goal. How do you know when it works? What does it do?\n\nYARIV: When the populations are inverted, when N2, the population of the centers with their spins pointing up was sufficiently bigger than N1 (spin down population), inside the resonator then an incident microwave radiation is reflected from the resonator bigger than the incident wave .You have made a maser microwave low noise amplifier. The crystals are sitting in a field inside a can. The can is high Q. The microwave field from the oscillator builds up a very strong field inside. The magnetic field is swept through resonance. And that flips the populations N1 and N2 . And that's done on the that basis. You apply a magnetic field, and if your things are right, and that's a big, big if, you succeed in inverting the little defect magnets so that more of the N2 point against the big magnetic field than along it N1 – a crystal in which N2 is bigger than N1. And if that happens inside a high Q resonator that was that applying the pulse at the population [level]. All of a sudden, you get a burst of microwave coming out of the can, which I detected and displayed on an oscilloscope. That was it.\n\nZIERLER: Was that a eureka moment? Did that happen quickly? Or this was a gradual series of experiment and verification?\n\nYARIV: Everything in that experiment required suppressing the ever-present noise. And you had to verify what you saw. There was not a eureka moment, but there was a moment in which I thought that we probably had it. But you couldn't go and make a statement. You couldn't claim success yet.\n\nZIERLER: What's the mechanism? What are you looking for to know if you have it or not?\n\nYARIV: You invert the population. Microwave theory. Now, this is the resonator. Let's give it a number. This is three. That's an enlarged version of this can right here. And it's inside the liquid helium in the magnetic field. And you now invert the population by the adiabatic fast passage. You wind up in the sample here, magnesium oxide, irradiated with neutron, I think. That was done in a nuclear facility. You have level two and level one. And the inversion means that you wind up in thermal equilibrium, N1 is bigger than N2. If you apply a microwave field to this sample, because N1 is bigger than N2, the microwave field causes a transition from here to here, which absorbs energy, and from here to here, which emits.\n\nAnd because N1 is bigger than N2, you absorb more than you emit, and the sample is absorbing. If you can invert the population so that when the microwave comes in, N2 is bigger than N1, more energy is emitted by the sample than is absorbed which is a necessary condition for amplification. And if the Q is high enough, it will oscillate. This box will now emit microwave radiation. And it's that radiation which is the sign. Because this experiment is done on the pulse basis, you invert it transiently because eventually, it relaxes back to N1 bigger than N2, and it absorbs again. There's a distinct microwave there, emission of microwave radiation.\n\nZIERLER: You said you're building the equipment for a year and a half. What's the timeframe to get to this point here?\n\nYARIV: After that, maybe half a year or so, doing experiments, writing it up. I came to John Whinnery one day and I said, \"John, I think I've done enough for a thesis.\" He said, \"If you say so.\" [laugh]\n\nZIERLER: Were you writing at all at this point? Did you publish?\n\nYARIV: Probably started writing during the last six months. At some point, I was convinced that I had observed maser oscillation.\n\nZIERLER: Were you in contact with people at Bell Labs?\n\nYARIV: Yes, George Feher and I. Although he was about four years older, we'd become good friends.\n\nZIERLER: Did you spend summers at Bell Labs at all?\n\nYARIV: No. I was married. I needed to do the experiment. At some point, John had a new graduate student join me. He was a good \"electronic-er\" and a good experimentalist. He eventually became a professor at the University of Oregon. And he helped me in the last stages of the experiment, taking data and so on. Good fellow.\n\nZIERLER: On the personal side, in Berkeley, is there a Jewish community, an Israeli community that you're part of?\n\nYARIV: There were roughly, I would say, 70, 80 Israelis, mostly graduate students. A good Hillel at Berkeley.\n\nZIERLER: Where were you for chagim [Jewish holidays]?\n\nYARIV: Probably at Hillel. Also, married, and my wife was an American, and her family was in San Francisco. They were not religious but celebrated major holidays. Mostly Hillel.\n\nZIERLER: That was enough for you.\n\nYARIV: I was not more religious to begin with, but yes. It was more of a social occasion. Lots of Israelis.\n\nZIERLER: Besides Whinnery, who else was on your thesis committee?\n\nYARIV: Singer, [laugh]. And Allen Portis. It probably says so in the introduction to my thesis.\n\nZIERLER: Was John Clarke there yet? Was he working on SQUIDs yet?\n\nYARIV: No. That was before John. Because my friends in Berkeley at "
