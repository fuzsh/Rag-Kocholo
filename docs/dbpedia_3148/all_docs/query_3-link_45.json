Join us as we celebrate its 10th anniversary with an anniversary edition carillon concert featuring Dennis Curry, Oakland University carillonneur.\n\nBring your lawn chairs and picnic blankets and enjoy the evening filled with music, food, prizes and more!\n\nWe'd love to hear what you love most about the Tower!\n\nShare your favorite Elliott Tower photos, memories or events.\n\nAbout The Tower\n\nSituated on a landscaped plaza which includes a water feature with programmable jets capable of sending water 60 feet upward, Elliott Tower stands as an icon on Oakland University’s campus.\n\nThe limestone-and-brick arched Tower soars 151 feet above Oakland University. The playing cabin is situated at 67 feet.\n\nTo be considered a “carillon”, the instrument must contain at least 23 cast bronze bells. Elliott Tower features a fully chromatic 49-bell carillon, each made of bronze and has the capability to play any musical compositions from arrangements of popular and classical music to original compositions created just for the carillon. The largest bell is a low C, weighing around 5,000 pounds and measuring 5 feet in diameter, while the smallest bell is a high C, weighing in at only 24 pounds. The total weight of all bells is more than 30,000 pounds – which totals over 15 tons.\n\nA Legacy of Philanthropy\n\nDonated by longtime supporters Hugh and Nancy Elliott, Elliott Tower is a rallying point for student activities and creates a stunning visual centerpiece for Oakland’s campus.\n\nThe Elliott Tower realizes Hugh and Nancy Elliott’s dream for a central place where students can gather, study and relax on campus. The Elliott family’s deepest belief about philanthropy resounds from a quote cast into the Tower’s largest bell:\n\n“The true net worth of a person is what he does for others.”\n\nThis philosophy is visible at Oakland University through Hugh and Nancy’s generous support of academics, athletics, capital projects, scholarships and endowments. Envisioned as a beacon welcoming all to campus, Nancy’s hope for the Tower was to create a new OU tradition with students saying, “Meet me at the Tower!”"
