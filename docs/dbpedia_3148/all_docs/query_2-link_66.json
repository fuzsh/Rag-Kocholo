        "text": "With the recent publication of the edited collection Brian Eno: Oblique Music (Albiez & Pattie, 2016) and the distribution of Brian Eno’s 26th solo studio album Reflection in 2017 on vinyl, CD and as an innovative software application, the time is ripe for a reconsideration of the way in which software has been used by the musician, composer, record producer and visual artist Brian Eno. This paper explores how Eno has used simple but innovative ideas and processes to inform his music over the course of his career, and considers how his work with collaborators – specifically the musician and software designer Peter Chilvers – has converged with the emergence of touchscreen technologies and modes of distribution. We will demonstrate how Apple’s App Store global distribution platform has further disseminated Eno’s ideas of ‘generative music’ to a wider audience through he and Chilvers’ Bloom (2008), Trope (2009/2015), Scape (2012) and Reflection (2017a) software applications for Apple’s iPhone and iPad, and the impact on the distribution and reception of Eno’s own music. Echoing Eno’s own processes of appropriation, remix and collaboration the authors wrote the paper through exchanges dictated by the turn of a card selected from the third edition of the Oblique Strategies deck, issued by Eno and Peter Schmidt in 1979.\n\nIn September 1978, Brian Eno coined the term “Ambient music” to describe a type of audio recording designed to create atmosphere. Ambient music, he proposed, should foster calm while registering doubt, and accommodate various different levels of listening attention. Since Eno’s proposal, Ambient music has become a genre of drone- and loop-based electronic music within the popular music market. This dissertation examines several key recordings in the formation of the Ambient genre of popular music, with focus on releases from the U.S. and England between the late 1960s and early 1990s. Through music analyses of these recordings, as well as media analyses of their promotional rhetoric, this dissertation traces the sonic tropes and social practices discursively organized by the “Ambient” label. It describes how Ambient music serves users as a means of relaxing, regulating mood, and fostering an atmosphere or sense of place. Unlike most extant accounts of the genre, it also explores how Ambient recordings reflect aesthetically upon their instrumentality through musical techniques, metaphors, and moods. A survey of approximately one-hundred Ambient listeners rounds out the study, illuminating from a present-day perspective how reception practices relate to the production and interpretation of Ambient recordings. Chapters 1 and 3 examine two proto-Ambient recordings from the Environments series of nature sound LPs (Atlantic, 1969–78), released by Syntonic Research, Inc. These analyses elucidate the aesthetics and technological uses that since consolidated Ambient music as a genre, and describe shifting attitudes toward consumer technology in the Western environmental and countercultural movements. Chapter 2 compares and contrasts Environments with recordings from the concurrently emerging Acoustic Ecology movement. Chapters 4 and 5 investigate various artistic and conceptual practices that informed Brian Eno’s conception of Ambient music. Chapter 4 identifies precedents for Eno’s concept in the experimental avant-garde music of Erik Satie, John Cage, La Monte Young, and Steve Reich. Chapter 5 analyzes the title recording on Eno’s Discreet Music album (Obscure, 1975), placing its production in the context of 1960s and ‘70s English minimalism, as well as the research field of cybernetics. It concludes with a media analysis of the record as a consumer product, illustrating how the elimination of authorial intention in experimental composition and cybernetics translates into popular art. Chapters 6 and 7 outline Ambient music’s explicit emergence as a term in the popular music market. Chapter 6 examines Brian Eno’s Music for Airports (Editions E.G., 1978) through a comparative analysis with The Black Dog’s Music for Real Airports (Soma Quality Recordings, 2010), illuminating the relevance of Ambient music’s contexts of consumption to interpretation. It concludes with a brief reading of Eno’s On Land (Editions E.G., 1982), which cemented Ambient music’s significance within private, individualized reception. Chapter 7 concludes the study with an overview of various recordings by The Orb, KLF, Mixmaster Morris, and Pete Namlook in the “ambient house” subgenre of electronic dance music, illustrating their connections with the aesthetic themes and promotional discourses of earlier Ambient recordings.

Ambient music’s historians and critics have often followed Eno by describing Ambient music as an alternative to conventional ‘background’ or ‘programmed’ music for commercial spaces. Such descriptions can be misleading, however, given that Ambient music’s dominant mode of reception is selective personal consumption, not public administration. This article investigates the aesthetics of Eno’s Airports, and elucidates the organizing role of the Ambient genre, within their primary reception context of personal recorded music listening. A comparison with The Black Dog’s Music for Real Airports (2010) shows how Ambient music then and now reflexively affords atmospheric use by translating a sense of physical dwelling and passage into mixed musical moods. By expressing ambivalence about the reality of airports and air travel, these Ambient records characteristically convey apprehension about the technological administration of human experience – a phenomenon that includes personal recorded music listening.\n\nWith the rise of haptic interfaces for mobile computing, the techniques and practices of digital audio production have undergone significant changes. Most noticeably, the shift from traditional recording studio environments to “ubiquitous computing” has allowed for the technical convergence of various media practices, from sound design to video games and multimedia art. The proliferation of “apps,” video games, and other forms of multimodal engagement with music production has introduced ludic structures into the creative process. In turn, this logic of non-linearity and play has influenced both the design of digital audio software, as well as the use of hardware “controllers” for manipulating this software. In the age of what many have called “digital maximalism,” how do producers, designers, and consumers of sound navigate the increasingly thin lines between media formats, creative practices, and technological engagement within global capitalism? Moreover, how might these “interface aesthetics” reflect broader concerns about the place of the body and technology in increasingly shifting media ecologies? In this dissertation, I detail the increasingly networked environment through which digital audio producers work, from record production to sound in mobile media and video games. I use the concrete and conceptual lens of the interface—defined as the relational, experimental, and interactive processes that are constantly being negotiated between and among both technological platforms and devices, and social and cultural communities—as an analytical tool. This allows me to examine trends in software and hardware design, shifts in both studio and stage performance, and connections between creative practices across media, including digital audio workstations (DAWs), MIDI and USB “controllers,” mobile apps for music production, and music video games. Additionally, I employ the term “ecology” to describe both a sociological phenomenon (to highlight the interconnected web of practices and techniques between various people and media), and a biological metaphor (to emphasize the anxieties about digital (un)sustainability that often form a basis of contemporary media design and practice). As a result, my theoretical framework brings together various threads of new media theory, from the digital humanities (including science and technology studies, human-computer interaction, information theory, UX-design, and software studies) to musicology and sound studies. Furthermore, I combine my experience as an electronic music producer with ethnographic data from product specialists at Native Instruments and Ableton, game designers at Sony Santa Monica Studios, and digital musicians working across media. A multimodal approach traversing theory, practice, and discourse allows me to integrate formal readings of technological interfaces within grounded musicological analyses of production techniques and practices.\n\nVoices from academia and beyond have declared ‘postmodernism is dead’, that a new age of realism and objectivity is upon us and that practice rather than theory or concept now carry the cultural baton, but do these speculations reflect the reality of contemporary popular culture? The turn of the past two centuries have invoked a spirit of change, a desire to reimagine the cultural landscape. The end of the Victorian era ushered in an age of modernism inspired cultural and technological changes that sought to sweep aside the old ways in a radical quest for the ‘new’. In turn, the 21st century has seen its own revolution in the arts and society as a whole, led by a tidal wave of digital technology who’s impact came almost hand in hand with the millennial dawn. Our reliance on digital technology is now ubiquitous. We rarely leave home without a computer of some kind, becoming overwhelmed by an irrational insecurity if we do that we need to access one as soon as possible to let people k..."
