David Byrne explained:\n\n\"I know, I know, we promised that the deluxe Everything That Happens package would be in everyone's hands who pre ordered it by Thanksgiving - as that's such a family oriented event. But we had to have the little house on the top of the container painted better - in China - and you know how it is with house construction - you can get quality, speed or affordable price - but not all three. So speed was sacrificed. We PROMISE they will be in everyone's hands by Christmas, Channukah, Kwanza.\n\nI did see a preview of the tin the other day and the audio chip hidden inside works beautifully, especially the squeaky door.\"\n\nDaniel Lanois has a new 3-CD release, The Omni Series.

To have to queue to be ripped off really would be a tad irksome.\n\nSexbomarolhoo: Rather, bring the exclusive Vegas ambiance at your home.\n\nTom: Ah, Eno's much-rumoured Ambient 5: Vegas Blackjack album...\n\nDoctor Fishpaw writes: People will respect your more for wearing a respectful watch.\n\nTom: Absolutely. My last watch was extremely uncivil to me on numerous occasions when we were out together, so I understand exactly the point you are making.\n\nDoctor Fishpaw: Every hot woman will ask you about the time.\n\nTom: What, every hot woman in the world? Looks like I'm going to be busy.\n\nHot woman: Hi, I'm a hot woman. Hey Tom, what is Time?\n\nTom: Guess you spotted the respectful watch on my wrist, huh? I regret that as a gifted procrastinator I am not qualified to explain what Time is. I just spend it answering Spam e-mails.\n\nTom's watch: Yeah, shove off. You're too good for him anyway.\n\nMustard: Can you keep the noise down please? Some of us are trying to have a kip here.\n\nThat wraps it up for this year.

Afterwards the programme will be available for viewing on the BBC's site for a week for UK residents. (Thanks to Richard Mills).\n\nQuestion Time\n\nRory Walsh writes: I ventured up to the big smoke to visit the Manifesto Marathon and having sat freezing in Frank Gehry Smoking Shelter for 5 hours I eagerly awaited sitting at the feet of the master. Eno was scheduled to appear at 6:40 but as the time approached and then passed it was announced that owing to an \"emergency\" he would not be appearing. Hans Ulrich Obrist read extracts from his manifesto for \"The Thank You Party\". One idea was Tax Payers being allowed to decide where their money goes and that progressively, in blocks of say 2%, it would come under their control up to say 30% of what they pay.\n\nDazed Digital has a report\n\nFrancesco Lo Forte e-mails: Twenty Systems, the new album by Benge aka Ben Edwards, is described by Brian Eno as \"A brilliant contribution to the archaeology of electronic music\".\n\nTwenty Systems at MySpace\n\nExpanding Records\n\nMarc Greuther says: Here's an interview with Tim Booth from James with a couple of mentions of Eno.\n\nFilter\n\nThe Tech had a feature on Brian in 1990.

What better way to celebrate 35 years of Here Come The Warm Jets and 60 years of Eno?\n\nPlease click the button below that you agree with and it will fire up an e-mail to EnoWeb. Then click send. Clicking \"Yes\" wouldn't commit you to anything; it's just a way for EnoWeb to gauge how much enthusiasm there might be for this project. But if you're not 100% sure then please choose \"Possibly\". And if you hate the idea, click \"No\" as that's still useful feedback. E-mail addresses will be used for the sole purpose of letting the Yes & Possibly people know any updates there might be on the project, and then deleted.\n\nColdplay's site has a track listing for the band's EP Prospekt's March, which is apparently due out in November and features more songs from the Eno/Dravs produced Vida la Vida sessions which have only just been completed. As it has a version of \"Lost!\" with Jay-Z on it, maybe this is the record previously reported as the \"Lost!\" EP? [Update: no, that's a separate EP with 4 versions of the song]. Vida La Vida was declared Best Album of 2008 in the Q Awards on 6th October, and the band Best Act In The World Today.\n\nProspekt's March at Coldplay and updated track listing\n\nQ Awards\n\nRadiocitizen writes: Apparently Jason Donovan has a new album out on 10th November, and the iTunes version will include a track called \"Nobody But Me\" co-written with Brian Eno.\n\nElectric Roulette\n\nRoger Eno has mentioned Brian in a couple of recent news items.\n\nRoger Eno (\"Naples\" & \"Plague Songs Continued\" entries)\n\nThe Los Angeles Times has an interview with David Byrne about Everything That Happens.\n\nLA Times\n\nAlan Knight e-mails: There is an interview with Brian & David Byrne in the new edition of Word magazine (subscribers' copies delivered early Oct, in the shops second week of Oct).

It's the one that appeared at last year's Serpentine Gallery Experiment Marathon.\n\nFormulas For Now - Brian's equation\n\nIndependent Article\n\nOur previous update was on 2nd October when we wrote:\n\nMichael Flaherty e-mails: Robert Fripp discusses Eno in a recent diary entry.\n\nRobert Fripp's Diary\n\nThe Jazzlander has a round-up of the 2008 Punkt Festival.\n\nJazzland Recordings\n\nThe BBC4 Roxy Music Story documentary included some brief early footage of Brian.\n\nThere was also a short sequence from the day in 2005 when Roxy Music got back in the studio. Who'd've thought that would be caught on camera?\n\nBrian recalled: \"It was only one afternoon, I think. It was so peculiar, because it was atomically identical to thirty-five years ago. It was as if not an atom had been moved -- in any direction. Everybody seemed to have exactly the same roles in the dynamic of the whole situation; the chemistry was precisely the same. It was funny actually.\"\n\nDave Knight writes:\n\nI was Googling around trying to find some reference to this film [ENO], and about the only mention I found was on EnoWeb - I think there's some date confusion, British Film Institute's website database lists it as 'ENO (1973)'.\n\nI have seen it a couple of times - back in about 1975(-ish) - they used to show it on a regular basis at The Essential Cinema, just off Wardour Street in London's Soho, along with a revolving programme of films such as Easy Rider, Woodstock, Monterey Pop and films by Herzog and Fassbinder etc.\n\nIt's a complete gem of a film - I remember the Paw Paw footage - the film is centred around the recording of Warm Jets. There's also a section where we see Eno coming out of a music shop clutching a Play Clarinet In A Day book, and heading straight over to a Portsmouth Sinfonia session! The footage of him with his Revox's in his home studio which was recently used in the BBC4 Roxy Music Story also comes from this film.\n\nLobby for a DVD release now! I wonder why it's disappeared without trace?\n\nPublicity is gearing up for the release of Dido's new album Safe Trip Home in November. There is a 3-part studio film on Dido's web-site; right at the end of Part 1 and at the start of Part 2 you can hear some of \"Grafton Street\", which Brian co-wrote.\n\nDido (video player starts automatically with Part 3)\n\nThe release of Daniel Lanois' signed Acadie Goldtop Edition has been slightly delayed because \"Daniel had to go to New York to finish the mix of U2's new album\". Pah! What sort of excuse is that???\n\nAcadie (plays audio automatically)\n\nPostbag time.\n\nJane Evans writes: about enoweb - and contacting brian eno (how to): your website contains some useful information but it is replete with slanderous trash. he's a person, brian eno - he was born in 1946. think about it.\n\nMustard responds: As a fierce wild tortoise, I have given this a great deal of thought, and I concur that it might be considered slanderous (or more accurately, libellous) trash to suggest that Brian is two years older than he actually is. He was born in 1948. I'm beginning to think that sending an e-mail in all lower case is the Internet equivalent of writing letters in green ink.\n\nTyler writes: Sax life can be improved by giving her more ecstasy.\n\nMustard responds: EnoWeb always recommends Andy Mackay for an unparalleled sax life.\n\nNatalya C. writes: I’m someone else!\n\nMustard responds: How can you tell?\n\nNatalya: Aloha, my gentleman!\n\nMustard: Ah, if I'm not mistaken that is a traditional Russian greeting!\n\nNatalya: What can I tell about myself?\n\nMustard: Not a great deal if you think you're someone else.\n\nNatalya: I don't like winter and cold.\n\nMustard: Try hibernation. I can wholeheartedly recommend it.\n\nNatalya: I hate loneliness which is associated with cold winter into my mind. I have not yet met a person who will have place into his heart for me.\n\nMustard: Do you always talk in crossword clues? \"Place into his heart for me\" is obviously an anagram for \"I am a coherent shoplifter\".\n\nNatalya: People say that I am beautiful and clever, why I can't find my soul mate?\n\nMustard: Because you are someone else, their description does not apply to you -- and nor does the soul mate. Simple.\n\nNatalya: I don't like parties where are a lot of people,\n\nMustard: No, the parties where nobody turns up are the best.\n\nNatalya: I don't like discos.\n\nMustard: But Discos is one of the loveliest Greek Islands! I frequently dream of retiring there.\n\nNatalya: I like quite rest, for example, theatre, cinema, coziness of sweet home where I feel in protection.\n\nMustard: That last bit sounds a little like prison.\n\nNatalya: I feel that you are calm and kind-hearted and you want to create family too. Am I not mistaken?\n\nMustard: That's not fair. How can one reply to \"am I not mistaken\"? \"No, you are not mistaken\" and \"Yes, you are not mistaken\" both mean \"you are correct\". I am calm, true, but I leave it to others to decide if I'm kind-hearted or not. As for family, it's pretty much a case of laying eggs and legging it, hoping they stay safe until they hatch, with my progeny's gender being determined by incubation temperature. But all that was a long time ago and in another country, before I was kidnapped in the early 1970s and brought here: cut off from my homeland, remote from my kinsmen.\n\nNatalya: I want to create my native home, to take care of someone who will love me.\n\nMustard: I must caution you that the keeping of Natives is nowadays frowned upon as excessively Colonial. It's political correctness gone mad!\n\nNatalya: I want to hear from somebody \"my Darling wife, my Beloved Woman\" and to feel the happiest in the world.\n\nMustard: I'm sure I heard Tom trying that as a chat-up line once... Didn't go well...\n\nNatalya: If you have some place for me in your heart, write me please and you will see that in my heart you will take all free space.\n\nMustard: Great! Parking round here is a nightmare.\n\nOur previous update was on 29th September when we wrote:\n\nJohn Walliser writes: Very quietly, dgmlive.com has added the remasters of No Pussyfooting and Evening Star to its online shop. EnoWeb adds: No Pussyfooting got subjected to a variety of unorthodox playing methods on its first release, whether it was John Peel accidentally broadcasting the tapes backwards or eager Frippnenophiles playing it at 16rpm. You couldn't do that with a compact disc. Or rather, now you can, as the album includes reversed versions of \"The Heavenly Music Corporation\" and \"Swastika Girls\"plus a half-speed \"The Heavenly Music Corporation\". No extras on Evening Star though.\n\ndgmlive\n\nColdplay will be releasing a four-track, digital-only Lost! EP on November 10th.

The last two who tried that found themselves stuffed into whiskey barrels on a one-way railroad journey down to Foolsgold Canyon. Think for a moment. Might phrases on the discography page like \"The EnoWeb Politburo\", \"highly subjective grading system\" and \"the most rabid completists\" indicate that EnoWeb does not take ratings (or its own Eno-fandom) entirely seriously, and hopes that visitors will have a similarly questioning attitude about what they read here? I think the answer is self-evident. As for your choice of verbiage, was it not Geoffrey Chaucer who said \"For if a preest be foul, on whom we truste, No wonder is a lewed man to ruste; And shame it is, if a prest take keep, A shiten shepherde and a clene sheep\"? GC, as I knew him, was a great enthusiast when it came to modern technology and I remember him showing me one of the techie gifts he had just bought from Ye Innovationnes Cattaloggue back in 1393 -- a quill pen with a built-in Shift Key (Create Illuminated Manuscripts In Half The Time!!!).

Very simple but extremely effective (less is more?). In the back room, there is a companion piece \"for Esmee\".\n\nBest for me was the showcase of late-60s programmes for mixed media events by Peter Schmidt and his collaborators. One was an evening of celebration of \"bodily fluids and functions\" in which mucus, pus, blood, sperm, etc are used visually and in sound. Thankfully, only the programme for this event is on show.\n\nBut to my mind, the greatest prize in the exhibition (which explores the connections between sound and visual material) must be the six short pieces of stereo audio by Peter Schmidt from 1969 (OK - one from 1978). They may now sound like humdrum feedback noises and tape loops but at the time they were being recorded (and these appear/claim to be among the very earliest of British audio experimental tapes in existence), they were genuinely ground-breaking. They seem quite self-conscious in places, but the naivete and assurance are quite a breath-taking combination.\n\nAlso on show are a set of 10 \"scores\" by John Cage and a colour piece which provides instructions to musicians by Karl-Heinz Stockhausen. The whole exhibition is small but perfectly-formed. The rooms are not exactly welcoming or comfortable, but the curator who is on hand (and was happy to stay open later than the 6pm closing time) is extremely friendly.\n\nWonder if Peter ever had any idea that these tapes (that were allegedly found in a bag in Norfolk) would re-surface in the 21st Century and be a point of interest, if only for the next few weeks, to a London audience?\n\nRichard also e-mails:\n\nA quite excellent handling of that particular enquiry. However, I might just posit the theory that, while Brian claims he does not know the exact value of his associational projects, methinks he might just have enough nous to know that the new Coldplay or U2 album might profit him more greatly than working with/on say, Get Cape Wear Cape Fly or indeed a solo album? But who cares? I vote in favour of BE being as aristocratic and hyocritical (sic) as he wishes...\n\nAh, but Richard, don't you think Brian might have taken pity on Coldplay and offered them discounted \"Mates' Rates\"?\n\nDaniel Patrick Quinn requested a right of reply. We said no. Oh all right, we said yes. Here he is again. Mouse scrolling finger at the ready?\n\nDear Tom\n\nThank you for your reply.\n\nThe point you raise suggesting that Eno only ever finds out the wage he is being paid after he has completed a particular project is, without question, only applicable when he can reasonably assume that it isn't less than a small fortune. It is obviously not the case that he'll reach the end of any project to be told his salary 'meets national minimum wage' or that he ought to be glad of the experience for his cv. I agree that people should be paid for their work but I also feel that Eno does his best to remain in a position where he is above criticism and can do as he pleases regardless of the cultural consequences. Many, many people will consider his contemporary credibility to be in need of debate after the Coldplay project. I genuinely cannot believe that there could be an artistic motivation behind the Coldplay work. If it is indeed the case then it is saddening that he is unable to discriminate between worthy projects and vacant corporate nonsense like this.\n\nOn the ever-tricky subject of class, you ask whether 'people care about that sort of thing?' I think those in the upper half of social privilege don't (because they don't need to) but those in the lower half probably do see a problem with the fact that they are exempt from the most influential and affluent social circles due to their location or upbringing and in spite of their comparable abilities with those few who are lucky enough to be born into the 'establishment families'. Given Eno's \"I'm not interested in hearing the music by people who enjoy my work\" brick wall attitude and the wider current music industry climate, the likelihood of any normal (yet extraordinarily talented) person being in a position to be considered to work with Eno, or any of the very few other people with the rare combination of intellect and influence, must be minuscule.\n\nThat is why I describe the Coldplay project as 'disgusting' – because it's a wholly self-serving insular project managed and executed by people who have a seeming disregard for, and perhaps ignorance of, their wider cultural backdrop.\n\nPerhaps he just can't be bothered to look where the more vibrant, less bloated, work is currently happening. It must be said that Eno has done more than his fair share of that in the past.\n\nAdmittedly, I used the word 'hy(p)ocritical' perhaps unwisely! I think what I was trying to encapsulate in the briefest manner possible is the fact that the vast majority of Eno's principles have, for decades, been to do with innovation, inquisitiveness, progression, excitement, unexpected outcomes etc.... This recent suggestion of his that 'Coldplay are living on the edge' (be it artistically, physically or mentally) is offensive to say the least to ordinary people and, as Andy Gill remarked in the Independent recently, it is blindingly obvious that out of all the projects Eno could choose to get involved with if he so desired, Coldplay would not be high on the list for purely aesthetic considerations!\n\nIf I were in Eno's position I would see the huge importance of actively seeking out and aiding, within reason, the innovative music, because that's part of the tradition of craft – like the father to son relationship in industry. By working with acts like Coldplay he is doing the very opposite, and I find it hard to believe he desperately needs the cash. The cultural figures of quality and endurance ought to do their bit to justify their position and help the next generation. Eno is failing, at present, to give much of cultural value back to the system that enabled him to reach his potential and have the often wonderful life that he has led, in order that others may have a similar chance. The next generation are not being allowed a foot on the ladder unless they create bland, turgid, one-size-fits-all 'music' like Coldplay, Snow Patrol, Keane, Travis et al and also happen to be part of an impenetrable social set.\n\nI do have a personal reason for feeling aggrieved, having recorded a great deal of innovative, characterful work, on a budget of zero, for several years now. It has been widely critically-acclaimed, from experimental mags like The Wire to the muppets of Radio One and NME. Despite all my work and all the praise and soundbites I have never once broken even on a project and the door into something approaching a music career has never once been left ajar.\n\nThe industry is very different now to when Mr E shot to prominence, but even so there are people out there, Mr E included, who could make an enormous difference for people attempting something culturally comparable. I'm sure he'd be the first to acknowledge that ability and success do not always go hand-in-hand, but Eno is in an incredibly privileged position and can make a difference. The people who most need his help in gaining a foothold in the music world are exactly the same people who would provide him with some of the most original, vibrant, colourful and vital music collaborations of his career. They are not those who you will come across at elite parties in Kensington or at awards ceremonies, and given the present industry climate they will be working on a budget of zero. I care about these people – and I am myself one of them – because at present their voices are largely lost in the seas of permanent MySpace anonymity. At the moment they are writing and recording into the abyss.\n\nYours sincerely\n\nDaniel Patrick Quinn\n\nEnoWeb has no wish to antagonise you further by responding to every word, but there are a few comments that deserve a response.\n\nEno's remuneration: his management know how much he will be paid, so there wouldn't be any unpleasant surprises (though it might be amusing to picture his face in the scenarios you mention). We originally raised the point to dispute your suggestion that money must be the sole reason for him choosing to work with Coldplay.\n\nColdplay, Coldplay, Coldplay: we are puzzled as to why you keep banging on about them. You clearly don't like them, so why are you allowing so much of your mind to be taken up by them? Why do you give them such power over your thoughts?\n\nBrian Eno is not Coldplay's dad. He did not create the band. Yet you appear to want to blame their existing profile and influence on the World Of Pop And Rock on him (you don't indict Markus Dravs, Brian's co-producer, as his co-accused). In his career he has worked with members of Coldplay, what, on just three occasions -- Viva la Vida, one track on X+Y and the Artists Against AIDS What's Goin' On single. They would keep making records whether he was involved or not. At least with Brian involved their songs are shorter, surely that must make you happy? You don't raise objections to his work with Paul Simon, Robert Wyatt, Harold Budd, Michel Faber, Emergency Broadcast Network, Nokia, Michael Stipe (admittedly unreleased), Laurie Anderson, Joseph Arthur, Bryan Ferry, Geoffrey Oryema, Rick Holland, Cluster, Microsoft, Robert Fripp, Russell Mills, the Metropole Orkest, Fovea Hex, Laraaji, B.R.K., Swarowski, BMW, Unkle, Michael Brook and so on. We argue that it is important to see his work for Coldplay in the context of a man who likes working with a wide range of artists and musicians, and has done so throughout the near-forty years of his career. But the way you present it, Brian had an unblemished career until he suddenly became Baron Lord Eno of Enoshire and decided to produce Coldplay in between dinner parties with his trendy London chums.\n\nThere is much to be discovered from the wisdom of the tortoises. Watch and learn. Mustard doesn't like blackcurants, so he doesn't eat them. Not only that, he doesn't even think about them.\n\nQuote: You say \"This recent suggestion of his that 'Coldplay are living on the edge' (be it artistically, physically or mentally) is offensive to say the least to ordinary people\". At EnoWeb we strive to report quotations accurately so as not to mislead our visitors, so for the record what Q reporter Sylvia Patterson quoted Brian saying was: \"The only thing I care about in music, now, is life... it's life that lasts. When you sense somebody living at the edge of their possibilities. And that's something I think you get with this band sometimes. I think you get it a lot on this record\". So he never said that Coldplay are \"living on the edge\": he said that he can sense when musicians reach that cusp of their potential where it all comes together -- something you will have experienced yourself as a musician. Rejoice! For you, Brian's statement doesn't have to mean anything, as you don't think Coldplay have any personal possibilities to be at the edge of. That's fine, but other people's opinions (including Brian's) may well differ.\n\nClass: Our point was that we didn't think people were interested in Eno's class, if he has any. Class divisions certainly exist in our great nation.\n\nMentoring: We don't agree there should be an obligation on Eno to do anything, just because his combination of luck, judgement, being a chancer, ducking and diving, dodging and weaving, bish-bosh-bash, tortoise-style opportunism etc have given him a reasonably comfortable life.\n\nIt may be worth considering that he may be involved in activities that deliberately don't get publicity. Yes, we're talking about Black Projects bankrolled by the CIA, in which Brian teams up with Jack Bauer from 24 to take the fight to the terrorists!!!* Or not, actually; it's just that occasional nuggets come to light about him visiting Mostar or South Africa and working with musicians and artists here and there. Rick Holland, the Re-TROS and B.R.K. don't have the Hit Parade status of that band we won't mention, and Brian's involvement with those individuals may have been small, but it diligent research showed that it happened, it simply didn't get widely reported (and there's no reason why it should have been). Just because you don't hear about it, don't assume it doesn't happen. Or do, if you prefer.\n\n*N.B. this is not a request for Eno fanfic.\n\nWe think you are overstating Eno's abilities as an opinion-maker. He has championed bands who have gone on to nothing much. Travis didn't find his production techniques were conducive to achieving what they wanted. His political campaigning has not had much impact: Tony Blair still walks the streets and the military presence continues in Iraq; we await his work with The Youth Of Today for the Liberal Democrats with interest. Art-wise, EnoWeb is surprised that no British or American gallery has a permanent installation of his work.\n\nAnd of course, there's MUDDA. Four years ago Peter Gabriel and Eno announced the formation of the Magnificent Union of Digitally Downloading Artists, which was intended to offer musicians (established and just starting out) a new, democratic and fair route to market. We all looked forward to the development of this exciting platform. But very little happened. The mudda.org web-site doesn't even work these days. Maybe they couldn't raise the finance; maybe there was little support for it within the music industry. If Brian and Peter couldn't make it happen, they may have concluded that they should devote their interests elsewhere where there's more scope for success.\n\nNot interested in fans' music: We believe the vast numbers of demos he received made listening to them an unsurmountable task. How many tapes or CDs could you listen to in a day? Let's say one an hour, or 24 in Jack Bauer parlance, though there are probably more than that arriving each day. No, that won't work, it doesn't give you any time off to eat or sleep. Okay, 12, then, though that will lead to a bit of a backlog building up after a coupla days. Better add 2 hours for making notes, writing them up, and sending them to the musicians. And the same thing tomorrow. And the same thing the day after that. For the rest of your life. What time would that leave you for your day job at the Gallery, for the music you want to make, for the other things you enjoy doing? And how do you choose which CDs you are going to listen to? How can you tell that this one is going to have the one really striking track, rather than that CD over there, or the one at the bottom of the pile in the next room? EnoWeb wouldn't wish that on anybody, even if we do sometimes hear music that we think Brian might enjoy. So we respect this Boundary Condition.\n\nEno failing to give good culture: As chief apologists for the vile, despotic Eno regime and its baleful influence, we'll have to disagree on this. We like his installations, 77 Million Paintings, lectures and music.\n\nYour situation: In all creative markets over the last few decades, increasing globalisation and takeovers of smaller players has led to real homogenisation, conservatism and aversion to risk everywhere -- in your musical area, fiction, art, film-making. We are sad that merit alone is not enough and that potential sales are the only yardstick used when a company decides to sign an artist. Also sad that you could not break even on a budget of zero (we find negative numbers rather scary). But this is the world you were born into. The number of musicians, artists, writers and film-makers who actually make it to the Big Time -- or are even able to make their living by their creativity -- is minuscule compared with the number who want to. Most people compromise out of necessity, keeping a day job and making music/ writing/ painting etc out of hours. EnoWeb is sadly aware that nobody owes any of us a living. The situation probably always has been this way, and we don't have any realistic answer for how this state of affairs could be improved.\n\nDaniel Patrick Quinn on MySpace -- no musical examples, as...\n\nMay 2008: No going back as Daniel Patrick Quinn quits the world of music forever\n\n2005 interview with Daniel Patrick Quinn -- complete with Coldplay mention\n\nOur previous update was on 22nd July when we wrote:\n\nSeems that Brian is headed off to the watery wastes of the Arctic.\n\nSFGate interview with Leslie Feist (we're not sure who \"Lori Anderson\" is -- possibly a cousin of Taurie Amos?)\n\nTore Pettersen says: Brian will be appearing at this year's Punkt Festival in Kristiansand, Norway, showing 77 Million Paintings for Punkt and giving a lecture on 5th September.\n\nPunkt Festival\n\nBillboard has some information on David Byrne's touring plans (thanks to Jim).\n\nBillboard\n\nMatt Verba e-mails: Just spotted this over at the Toothpaste for Dinner website.\n\nCartoon\n\nMichael C.

Legions of perusers of David Sheppard's magisterial magnum opus On Some Faraway Beach will have been excited to read:\n\nSo what's the story behind this spooky brief appearance and almost immediate disappearance? Step forward Mustard The Tortoise with his personal recollection of the incident. \"I was out searching for dandelions outside a record shop one day when looking through an open window I saw a puzzled-looking shopkeeper seated in his chair, with gaze abstracted, furrowed forehead, unkempt hair, as Graves put it in somewhat different circumstances (a poem, rather than real life). Ting-a-ling went the bell as I entered the shop. 'What's the matter?' I asked the shopkeeper. 'Any idea what this is? It's fair got me jiggered, and no mistake,' he said, bending down and showing me a bootleg CD called Dali's Car. I was shaken to my very core. The Reptilian Plan For World Domination clearly specified that the first commercial CDs were not meant to be released until the early 1980s, so what was this CD doing here in the mid-70s, a time when there were not even any CD players in existence? It was immediately clear to me that Dark Forces were attempting to shatter the Time Continuum and meddle with humankind's very destiny. If I did not act quickly, the world would be submerged in a flow of unplayable Dire Straits Brothers In Arms CDs, reflecting the warmth of the sun's rays and triggering a new Ice Age. Thinking on my clawed feet, I explained to the shop worker that the CD was in fact a novelty coaster and he should probably chuck it away. This he did -- I had saved the day and set the future of the human race back on track once again.\" (N.B. Future is malleable and in constant flux. Other destinies are available.)\n\nPick of the Postbag. Daniel Patrick Quinn writes:\n\nHi Tom\n\nFirst I'd like to express my admiration and support of your work on the Eno site, and the promotion of his activities. However, I have to ask if you would happily continue supporting BE whatever he did? I know his back catalogue is one of the finest of the 20th century but I feel that many people will consider his work with Coldplay to be quite a disgusting hyocritical aristocratic move and I just wondered if your aim is always to be utterly impartial, or whether you feel that some form of debate about the quality and or reasons behind the sort of activities Mr E is getting involved with (for whatever dubious financial reason) might be rather healthy, instead of blindly supporting whatever he does.\n\nPerhaps it is indeed time for one of those deep \"Why Are We Here?\" conversations. In its original incarnation EnoWeb was intended to be a hypertext-linked web of information about Brian Eno. Oh, you should have seen the Internet back then! So full of promise! EnoWeb's current form caters to the most pressing interests of its visitors: news and lyrics. As a trade-off for us posting those, most visitors are willing to put up with EnoWeb's occasional forays into quirky humour.\n\nWhether visitors to the site are fans or just have a vague wish to find out more about Brian, they big enough to know their own views and don't need EnoWeb's opinions about Brian Eno. They just want the facts. There are aspects of Brian's career that don't hold a great deal of interest for EnoWeb, but they will interest somebody, so we post them.\n\nOver the years we have encountered some people on the Internet who have a sense of \"personal entitlement\" or a belief that they should be able to influence the actions of some celebrity or other. While we don't believe Brian is above criticism (no-one is, apart from Mustard The Tortoise), EnoWeb prefers simply to observe, to enjoy the things we like and not fret too much about the things that don't interest us. Have you ever visited one of those sites where people are negative or abusive about something? They are truly dispiriting. We wouldn't want to be like that.\n\nThat said, we are a little puzzled by your words: \"I feel that many people will consider his work with Coldplay to be quite a disgusting hyocritical aristocratic move\". Why would you feel this? Not everybody likes Coldplay, certainly, but clearly Brian Eno does.\n\nWhy \"disgusting\"? It's just a record.\n\nWhy \"Hy[p]ocritical\"? Has he said \"I wouldn't work with Coldplay\"? If you look at it in the context of his career, why is working with Coldplay any different from working with Travis, U2, J. Peter Schwalm, Jon Hopkins, the Re-TROS, Simian, Suede, Carmel, John Cale, Talking Heads, David Bowie, Leo Abrahams, Derek Jarman, Devo, Jon Hassell, the New Composers, Genesis, James, David Byrne, Belinda Carlisle, Tony Allen, The Grid, Massive Attack, Damien Dempsey, Daniel Lanois, Phil Manzanera, Grace Jones, Herbie Hancock and so on? Surely this comment cannot be driven by some antipathy towards Coldplay and not these other artists -- after all, that would be no basis for a rational argument.\n\nWhy \"Aristocratic\"? Brian came from working-class roots and would probably qualify as upper-middle-class now... do people care about that kind of thing?\n\n\"whether you feel that some form of debate about the quality and or reasons behind the sort of activities Mr E is getting involved with\"\n\nFor debate, EnoWeb always directs vistors to the Nerve Net mailing list where discussions on Brian and his works frequently take place (it goes through phases and is currently a bit quiet). Your reference to \"the sort of activities Mr E is getting involved with\" sounds rather sinister...\n\n(for whatever dubious financial reason)\n\nAh, we think we recognise this as the \"he must be doing it for the money, there can be no other reason\" argument. Here's the thing: Brian does not know what the payment will be for the jobs he takes on. He gets his management to keep that under wraps until the job is completed. That way, he can choose projects on whether he thinks they will interest him, whether he will enjoy them, whether they will stretch him intellectually, whether he can bring something constructive to the table, whether they'll be fun, challenging or whatever criteria pique his interest for five minutes. Fact is, Brian's been a friend of Chris Martin for years. He likes the Coldplay band members. So his decision to work with Coldplay would have been because he wanted to, not because pound signs suddenly appeared in his eyes.\n\nAnyway, for the EnoWeb team, financial reasons are never dubious. We work for a living: there are mortgages to pay and the T-Lady's special Tortoise Seed Mix to buy. There is no shame in fair payment for work performed.\n\ninstead of blindly supporting whatever he does.\n\nYou may be confusing our attempted impartiality with blind support. We will continue to report on Brian's activities, leaving it to our visitors to make their own judgements -- freely and without bias.\n\nHope this explains why things are the way they are.\n\nNerve Net\n\nDrowned In Sound -- this has comments amazingly similar to those of Daniel Patrick Quinn above, plus the C-word... ah, the thrust and parry of philosophical debate!\n\nUseful cartoon for application to some Drowned In Sound postings\n\nUPDATE: Daniel Patrick Quinn requested a right of reply.

So now he's presenting Surrender Lounge Proposal: 77 Million Paintings in the Museum -- which along with the usual screens includes new light cones and birch trunks -- and another Bells piece that is called either Aurelia or Audelia out in the courtyard. \"I found that the music I'd written for Lydian Bells wasn't suitable,\" he told Corriere del Mezzogiorno's Biagio Coscia. \"it was not a very good recording and I made an error of mathematics,\" he told La Repubblica Napoli; back to CdM, \"...

Wonderful stone walls providing fantastic natural reverb to all of the pieces played.\n\n\"Discreet Music\" was the finale of the concert. Similar instrumentation as mentioned in the NYC performance. 2 Flutes, Soprano Sax, Violin, Grand Piano, Trombone, Electric Guitar, Bowed Double Bass and Vibraphone/Gongs. Performed totally live with each instrument taking \"turns\" simulating the various short melodic snippets of the piece and then repeating the parts at progressively lower volumes, emulating the tape delay decay characteristics of the original piece. This translated very beautifully to these instruments.\n\nInteresting how your attention would float from one instrument to another as no single instrument was the main focus. A tribute to the performers' treatment of the piece. Also notable was that the soprano sax (not the flutes as you would suspect) most closely resembled the synthesizer sound Eno originally used.\n\nHopefully an official recording of this will become available shortly. Perhaps someday they can attempt something else from these same tape delay experiments, like Fripp & Eno's \"The Heavenly Music Corporation\" from No Pussyfooting. However I spoke to Jerry Pergolesi of the group and he mentioned they are currently working on performing the \"Three Variations of Pachelbel's Canon\" as well (Fullness of Wind, French Catalogues, Brutal Ardour), which should also be interesting to hear with this instrumentation.

Brian got a mention and the new single was played.\n\nAudio interview\n\nNews item with edited extracts\n\nAbsolutely nothing to do with Brian, but fans of electronic music might enjoy this trip to the BBC Radiophonic Workshop -- you can see a suitcase synth like the one Brian used to perform with.\n\nBBC\n\nOur previous update was on 28th April when we wrote:\n\nOver at Nerve Net, Richard \"Total Recall\" Mills gives a blow-by-blow account of the Royal Academy event.\n\nNerve Net\n\nColdplay will be providing their first single \"Violet Hill\" as a free download on their site for a week from April 29th. It will also be included on a free 7\" vinyl single with the NME on 7th May, together with a track unavailable elsewhere, \"A Spell A Rebel Yell\".\n\nBBC Entertainment\n\nColdplay (with new Favicon)\n\nNME\n\nMagda e-mails: hi! I'm wondering if Brian Eno is involved in any way in Peter Jackson's upcoming The Lovely Bones movie. I know a few of his songs have been listed in the script of the movie, but I have also found a little piece of info that refers to Jon Hopkins working with him on the soundtrack.\n\nThink Sync Films (Scroll down to Just Music)\n\nPeter Jackson Fan Club (scroll down to Reply #47 for a list including old Eno songs)\n\nKelvin L Smith says: Harold Budd has a new album coming out. Long wait though!\n\nA Song For Lost Blossoms\n\nOur previous update was on 24th April when we wrote:\n\nEchoes will be running a series of features in May to celebrate Brian's 60th birthday (thanks to John Diliberto).\n\nMonday 12th May -- AN INTERVIEW WITH BRIAN ENO: ZELIG IN THE MACHINE\n\nLook in any corner of contemporary music, and Brian Eno is there. Brian Eno celebrates his 60th birthday this week. Rarely has an artist made such a monumental impact on modern music with such subtlety. As part of a week long celebration of Eno's music, we look back at his career with interviews from Eno, Roxy Music guitarist Phil Manzanera, and members of Bang on A Can.\n\nTuesday 13th May -- AN INTERVIEW WITH BRIAN ENO: ON AN AMBIENT JOURNEY\n\nThe avatar of ambient music tells us the joys of quiet. Ambient music is all around us. Mark Prendergast even wrote a book called The Ambient Century. All of that comes down to Brian Eno, who coined the term \"ambient music\" in the 1970s, and released his sonic manifesto, Music for Airports. Eno talks about his concepts for ambient music.\n\nWednesday 14th May -- THE WIT & WISDOM OF BRIAN ENO\n\nWe hear thoughts and musings from the thinking person's musician. Brian Eno is one of the most profound minds of modern music. He's a conceptualist who applies avant-garde principles to pop music by U2 and Paul Simon, and pop principles to the avant-garde. In this wide-ranging meditation, one of the provocateurs of electronic music talks about the virtues of live performance as well as Abba and heavy metal.\n\nThursday 15th May -- TOUCHED BY ENO\n\nFor some musicians, being touched by Eno is like being touched by God. Musicians who weren't even born when Brian Eno recorded his seminal albums have been touched by his music. Artists from across genres, from pop to avant-garde, African to Asian, have found their music shaped by Eno, sometimes directly, often as a life-changing influence. On Brian Eno's 60th birthday, we hear from some of them including Harold Budd, Loop Guru's Dave Muddyman, David Toop, BT and Bluetech.\n\nFriday 16th May -- THE WORLD OF BRIAN ENO\n\nA two-hour soundscape of Brian Eno's music. In this special edition of Echoes, we hear an Echoes soundscape of Brian Eno's music, from his ambient works, pop songs, collaborations and productions.\n\nEchoes\n\nAccording to Opal, Brian will not be touring with David Byrne, so it looks like wires getting crossed at Daily Swarm's source.\n\nThe first single from Coldplay's new album -- produced by Brian -- will be premiered on BBC 6 Music on 29th April.\n\n\"Violet Hill\"\n\nBob Pearce e-mails: Not sure if this has been shared before -- it's a video to accompany the Eno-Byrne track \"Moonlight In Glory\".\n\nTed\n\nOur previous update was on 18th April when we wrote:\n\nThere are some updates further to last December's news item about Brian and David Byrne working together. David describes the type of music and there's a suggestion of a tour -- though who knows if this would include Brian (Paul Simon's Surprise tour line-up didn't feature Brian, after all). (Thanks to Richard Mills, Gerard Devine, Michael Flaherty, Steve Wilson & Jeff Baena).\n\nThe original NME.com story is picked up by Drowned In Sound, which in turn is picked up by Stereogum and The Daily Swarm which mentions the William Morris Agency talking to promoters about a US tour and also links to the NY Daily News' description\n\nLeo Abrahams' April Webdiary says he's been putting in some more work on the album\n\nColdplay have announced a track listing and release date for their new album, Viva La Vida (thanks to Richard Mills).\n\nColdplay\n\nOn YouTube now: the 1.Outside EPK, made up of behind-the-scenes studio footage. This was originally Real video format circa 1995, so the video quality is somewhere between Tetris and Brian's Ambient videos. Rather than straightforwardly promoting the album, the EPK includes extracts from various recording and discussion sessions, with some music that didn't make it to the released album. You can see Brian dancing too.\n\nPart 1\n\nPart 2\n\nOur previous update was on 7th April when we wrote:\n\nEclectic \"quarterly\" music publication Unknown Public sends word that having looked for alternatives to its hardback-book-and-CD format (formerly cardboard-box-and-CD-format), it has joined forces with a \"technology partner\" -- seemingly wanting to become a musical social network and store. One of its first wares is \"The Unknown Zone\", a previously unreleased track by Phil Manzanera with Brian, Robert Wyatt and Yaron Stavi.\n\nMVine / Unknown Public: Phil Manzanera (click on Playlists and you can hear a slightly tinny stream)\n\nBuying page (if you want to buy the track, you need to register first; you can get it in gutsier MP3 and Ogg Vorbis formats after purchase)\n\nJ. Peter Schwalm recently wrote a bit about recording Music for Onmyo-ji.\n\nJPS at MySpace\n\nOver on Nerve Net, Bernd Kretzschmar describes the Swarowski Krystallwelten exhibition.\n\nNerve Net\n\nNot much new or notable Eno-wise on YouTube, but these might while away a coupla minutes for you...\n\nJeff Yarborough talks to Roedelius\n\n77 Million Paintings\n\nRemix of \"An Ending (Ascent)\" by Michael Dow\n\nOver 10 years ago Brian spoke of wanting to write a big theory of culture (here & here). Since then we have wondered when that space on our bookshelves next to the Rev. Casaubon's The Key To All Mythologies would be filled. It seems that moves are afoot, though not a release date or anything.\n\nPublisher's Weekly mentions 44 Minutes: A Big Theory about Culture\n\nThe Franciscan Sisters of Christian Charity have chosen Daniel Lanois' song 'The Maker' as their song for April.\n\nFSCC\n\nAward nominee Rachid Taha is due to perform at the 2008 Awards for World Music on Thursday 10th April (broadcast on BBC Radio 3 on 11th April at 19:00 BST)\n\nPerformance On 3\n\nThe Long Now Foundation has a box in a Self Storage exhibition at 300 Treat Avenue in San Francisco, Wednesday to Sunday, 18th April - 18th May. Not to be confused with the 1995 Eno-Anderson Artangel event of the same name.\n\nCuratorial Industries\n\nMustard, The Tortoise Who Came In From the Cold, has just got time for a look in the postbag...\n\nTor writes: brianeno.com says \"experiment appearing shortly\". Is this his own site?\n\nMustard replies: We're getting this question a lot at the moment. The domain was registered in 1997 by an Eno fan who we understand was so horrified by the thought that somebody might cyber-squat on Brian Eno's domain that he altruistically decided to safeguard and protect it for evermore. For several years he had a still from Mistaken Memories on the site rather than this new message.\n\nubeh ben writes: Dear Friend, I'm happy to inform you about my success in getting those funds transferred under the cooperation of a new partner from paraguay. Presently i'm in Paraguay for investment projects with my own share of the total sum. meanwhile,i didn't forget your past efforts and attempts to assist me in transferring those funds despite that it failed us some how. Now contact my secretary in Nigeria his name is Mr Chinedu Obi on [deleted] ask him to send you the total of $2.5.\n\nMustard replies: How tragic! Nigerian 419 spammers have fallen on such hard times that they can only afford to scam us with a measly two-and-a-half bucks!\n\nNannie Bourgeois e-mails: Re: the secret to bedding her... She let out a silent scream when I told her that I can go 9 times a night.\n\nMustard quibbles: As a fierce wild tortoise, I have excellent hearing -- but even I would find it impossible to hear what you describe as a \"silent scream\". Without noise, how could you tell she was screaming? I think you'll find that she was in fact yawning. For the second part of your question, I would advise that in future you no longer drink 6 litres of water before going to bed in the evening. That will help you avoid having to nip to the loo on quite such a regular basis. Good night!\n\nOur previous update was on 26th March when we wrote:\n\nScanner samples: Just thought I'd draw your attention to a fine event that I'll be chairing at the Royal Academy in London on 21st April. It includes a performance of 4' 33\" and discussions with Brian, Tom Phillips and Vesna Petresin Robert. Looks to be a very entertaining night...\n\nArchitecture and Music 2 - Performance, Silence and Space\n\nWould you like to sit on Brian Eno? We hope that nobody would dream of suggesting such a thing. However if you're keen, it appears that Brian has named a seat at The South Bank Centre. (Yes, we know somebody's decided to try rebranding it \"Southbank Centre\" without a \"The\", but those renamings seldom work: Reading's natives still refer to The Butts Centre rather than The Broad Street Mall, and that was changed years ago.) Perhaps Brian's action is a reference to his suggestion in A Year With Swollen Appendices: \"I mean, you should be able to advertise 'Man seeks position as sofa for large lady' and get lots of sensible replies, for example.\"\n\nSouth Bench (scroll horizontally a bit)\n\nBrian is listed as a participant in the Experiment Marathon Reykjavík on 16th May, probably in the Reykjavík Art Museum's Hafnarhús.\n\nReykyavík Arts Festival (if this page displays in Icelandic, click on the UK flag in the top right-hand corner, then on Visual Arts 2008 in the left-hand menu bar, then The Reykjavik Art Museum - Hafnarhusid / Experiment Marathon Reykjavik in the middle of the page)\n\nJeffrey Morgan enthuses about Taking Tiger Mountain (By Strategy).\n\nMetroTimes\n\nFrancesco Lo Forte e-mails: Daniel Lanois is taking part in a Q&A for GearSlutz until 31st March. He answered a question on Apollo.\n\nGearSlutz Q&A\n\nApollo question\n\nEdmonton Sun has quotes from Bono & Daniel Lanois on Brian\n\nOur previous update was on 25th March when we wrote:\n\nRichard Mills opines:\n\nGood times to be had last Monday night (March 17 2008) as Brian Eno, the \"brains behind Roxy Music\" - OK, OK, my quote, not actually said by anyone other than me - gave another of his unfathomable talks, together with New Yorker professor and chief lecturer Clay Shirky. I must be getting the hang of these as it made much more obvious sense than some of the previous events where subjects matter has included things from... well, what HASN'T it included? They seem to ramble aimlessly on enjoying the view while nerdily recording the rise and rise of technology in modern worlds (real and virtual) and the power networks that inevitably spring from their loins.\n\nStill with me?\n\nBrian started grumpily enough and totally in keeping with his public face-to-face persona by criticising the hosts ICA for using too small a room and therefore \"for the 19th time\" selling out weeks in advance. \"Would someone from the ICA please take note and hire a larger space next time?\" he bleated. He had a point - the Nash Room seems like a destination for people who enjoy the longest route to a long-forgotten loft in the rafters of an old mansion-house.\n\nBut warming to what is potentially a very cold sterile subject in the wrong hands, Brian softened up and talked about the origins of the Internet, the WELL project, how dentists co-ordinating their diaries were responsible for online bulletin boards, how the Internet \"became established as this huge masturbation machine... sorry, I mean marketing tool\", flash-mobbing, the formation of the 2006 passenger charter created in USA by the revolt by users of airlines who incarcerate them when flights are grounded using the Web to network and exert their commercial influence, etc etc... we could have talked long into the night but the talk was curtailed after 70 minutes because naturally Brian and Clay have products to sell and sign in the bookstore downstairs - Brian's 2nd edition of 77 Million Paintings DVD and Clay's Here Comes Everybody book.\n\nWhat was mesmerising between snatches of information was the physical similarity of the two speakers. There may be decades between them in age but both are dome-headed beshaven bespectacled intellects on human legs...and almost interchangeable but for the evident characteristics embued in each by upbringing in Woodbridge, Suffolk and New York respectively. Magic (as Paul Daniels might say).\n\nScratchy MP3 bootleg (Mark A.M. Kramer proves the power of networks)\n\nVideo clips (more proof)\n\nFabio Anile e-mails: Thanks for hosting this huge web site about Mr. Eno.
