        "text": "Check out the Definitive Techno History playlist on Beatport.\n\nLATE 1970s\n\nIn the decaying post-industrial Midwestern city of Detroit, a young Black man by the name of Juan Atkins manifested an escape hatch into the future with the aid of his Korg MS10 synth. Inspired by the work of futurist Alvin Toffler, whose book Future Shock he studied at school, Atkins, still only in his teens, set about creating music that could transport listeners to an imagined future. Crumbling Motor City became glistening Techno City, as Atkins channeled elements of funk and soul through automated beats into innovative electronic compositions that migrated over the Atlantic to Europe as part of an ongoing cultural exchange. 40 years later, the music he christened “techno” has branched off into numerous styles and sub-genres, but the ethos remains the same: futurism, optimism, escape, catharsis and people dancing in unity to the electronic beats.\n\nThe history of Detroit techno is populated by the influence of Black electronic music, but also determined by European electronic pioneers and ignited by the socio-economic and cultural circumstances of Motor City itself. Going all the way back to Berry Gordy’s Motown, there’s a distinct attitude and rhythm that exists only in Detroit. From Martha and the Vandellas’ hit “Dancing in the Street” to “The Tracks Of My Tears” by Smokey Robinson, Gordy’s label was a hit factory, pushing out one big song after another, modeled on the production lines at the car factories that dominated industry in Detroit.\n\nDisco DJs and funk bands preceded the birth of Detroit techno, both integral to the city’s Black club culture in the years before techno arrived. Legendary DJs such as Ken Collier primed the city for its first wave of techno, with the 4×4 heartbeat of disco pumping away on the dance floors of clubs such as Pink Poodle, Millie’s and Flamingo. The disco influence was especially pertinent for techno pioneer Kevin Saunderson, who lived in New York when he was a kid. After moving to Detroit when he was nine, Kevin would still visit New York every summer as his brothers were still living there. During those trips he made it to the Paradise Garage, where Larry Levan kept the dance floor ignited with disco and proto-house cuts all night long. Tracks like First Choice “Love Thang” and Cerrone “Supernature” inspiring young Kevin.\n\nLater, it was the Electrifying Mojo who became Detroit’s foremost influence with his show on WGPR-FM. As Captain of the mothership he would take listeners on a four-hour long odyssey of music and themed segments, presenting his audience with a broad selection; from Prince b-sides and rarities, to Kraftwerk’s “Numbers”, Parliament’s “Flashlight” and much much more. His shows were pivotal to the birth of techno, introducing pioneers like Juan Atkins and Carl Craig to programmed electronic beats, and new wave innovators like Gary Numan and Depeche Mode. Numan’s “Cars” a fitting anthem for the city’s automotive pulse. New wave, industrial and eighties electronic acts were highly influential at the time as well as bands like the B-52s, whose “Mesopotamia” was a favourite of Mojo’s.\n\nKraftwerk are considered the godfathers of techno, and contemporary electronic music. Interestingly, Detroit groups The Stooges and MC5 were among Kraftwerk’s early influences, as was Motown Records, according to the group’s later member Karl Bartos. Tracks like “Numbers and “Trans-Europe Express” inspired Arthur Baker and Afrika Bambaataa to produce “Planet Rock”, giving birth to electro, a precursor to techno. “Clear” by Cybotron, (AKA Juan Atkins and Rik Davis) is another pivotal track in the electro world, which we’ll come back to later.\n\nMeanwhile in Manchester, a club once known locally as stronghold for jazz funk began putting on acid house nights, as The Haçienda set the stage for the Madchester era that would follow for many years and give birth to acts like A Guy Called Gerald and 808 State. Gerald’s classic “Voodoo Ray” was an instant acid house anthem, while his 1989 track “Emotions Electric” epitomised the hedonism and hazy outdoor euphoria of the various raves that took place all over the UK. Similarly, 808 State’s “Pacific State” captured the emotion of the era.\n\nThough one of the era’s biggest turning points came in 1988, when UK journalist Neil Rushton compiled Techno! (The New Dance Sound Of Detroit). The compilation was signed by Virgin Records, and helped establish Detroit techno in Britain. Rushton’s compilation, the first official release of its kind, landed in ‘88, but it wasn’t until the following year when its impact was fully felt. Music fans who were already familiar with early Atkins releases were formally introduced to the Detroit sound with a release that brought together a crew of pioneers on one record for the first time. It was part of a burgeoning connection between techno’s birthplace and the continent where it was truly thriving. And soon, UK artists like Kirk DeGiorgio, Mark Archer (Altern8), the late Matt Cogger (who worked for Transmat in the late eighties), Frankie Foncett, Lee “In Sync” Purkiss (who went on to launch Fat Cat Records) and more began visiting Detroit in order to connect with the pioneers. They worked in the studios of Atkins and May, forming bonds that led to the creation of music that was more authentic than many of the early British attempts to emulate Motor City; acts like B12 and The Black Dog initially taken direct influence from The D, whileCogger’s ‘Artemis’ (as Neuropolitique) was recorded at Metroplex Studios, for example. Pirate station Kiss FM hired Colin Dale and Colin Faver to host shows, both using their slots to showcase early techno. Both Dale and Faver were essential to the proliferation of techno in London.\n\nDetroit’s pioneers also visited the UK, playing live shows and DJ sets to varying degrees of success — some parts of the country weren’t quite ready for the music. Darren Mohammed of Adrenalin M.O.D. went on to record “Heychild’s Theme” as Heychild in 1989, an early UK techno classic. The Black Dog (Ken Downie, Ed Handley and Andy Turner) emerged with their first release “Age Of Slack” the same year, followed by “Virtual”.\n\nBack in Detroit, another radio personality was becoming an anonymous phenomenon. The Wizard, a faceless DJ whose dynamic precision, quick mixing and live re-edits won him a loyal fanbase on local radio station WJLB. Real name Jeff Mills, The Wizard was initially a member of the industrial group Final Cut. While things didn’t quite work out, the project ended up connecting him with “Mad” Mike Banks. Together they set up Underground Resistance, inspired by the success of independent Detroit outfits Metroplex, KMS and Transmat.\n\nUR had a clear objective and ethos, conceived to oppose the powerful entities that controlled the music industry. Mills and Banks (later joined by Robert Hood) brought a strong purposeful, empowering edge to the music. Put simply, Underground Resistance was a game changer. The incendiary performances of Jeff Mills, Mike Banks and Robert Hood, along with their militant dress code, ethos and mission statements etched into their records, added a whole new dimension to the music. Initially centred on their own often diverse, uncompromising, sometimes soulful, sound, with cuts like “Transition”, “Planet X”, “Jupiter Jazz” and the confrontational “Fuck The Majors,” which features the words, “Message to all the murderers on the the Detroit Police Force — we’ll see you in hell!”, with a dedication to Malice Green, who was beaten to death by Detroit police officers in 1992. UR also released Blake Baxter’s mesmerising “When a Thought Becomes U”, DJ Rolando’s timeless 1999 track “Knights Of The Jaguar,” and some of Drexciya’s early material, from “Aqua Worm Hole” and “Wavejumper” to “You Don’t Know”.\n\nDrexciya defined their own sound, taking the majority of their influence from electro and developing the genre into what became a unique representation of their ethos and the world they had created. Though they would never have pigeonholed themselves as such, or even claimed to be part of Detroit’s techno scene per se, Drexciya played an important role in the growth of the music, their mystique and insular approach creating a unique, aquatic strand of techno DNA.\n\nParallel to UR’s arrival, Jeff Mills was also producing his own solo material, which elevated him to almost God-like status for fans across Europe. His seminal anthem “The Bells” was one of many underground club hits he produced during a prolific period in the early nineties, and in 1991 he founded his own label Axis, and he also launched a sub-label named Purpose Maker, with productions mostly under his name but also using the alias Millsart. Cuts such as “Black Is The Number”, “The Dancer”, “In The Bush”, “Step To Enchantment (Stringent)” and many many more proving Mills to be a visionary without equal in the techno world.\n\nIn Belgium — a country with a history rich in music and dancing — a slowed down sound called new beat was exploding parallel to the development of techno. Discovered as a “happy accident” when “Flesh” by A Split Second was played at the wrong speed by DJ Dikke Ronny, new beat became the sound of a generation. Though it was short-lived, fizzling out in just a few years as imitators watered down the original sound, new beat opened the country up to electronic sounds, spawning Electronic Body Music (EBM) and ushering in a wave of techno innovation, led by acts like Joey Beltram.\n\nBy the time Beltram released his seminal techno track “Energy Flash” on R&S Records, the label was already seven years old. Launched in 1983 by Renaat Vandepapeliere* and Sabine Maes, the label (christened with the couple’s initials) embraced the new beat/EBM boom, and was perfectly positioned for the wave of gechno that would follow. There were all-time classics such as “Plastic Dreams” by Jaydee, “Mentasm” and the aforementioned “Energy Flash” by Joey Beltram, a glut of early Aphex Twin releases (Selected Ambient Works 88 – 92 among them) and C.J. Bolland’s incendiary “Horsepower.” So influential was the label in the UK that they set up a London office, with the aid of drum & bass DJ Bryan Gee. In fact, D&B pioneers Fabio & Grooverider cite R&S as one of the key influences in the conception of jungle at legendary club night Rage.\n\nElsewhere in Belgium, Frank De Wulf rose to prominence as one of the country’s most prolific and revered electronic music artists. He broke through with his classic track “Acid Rock” before cementing his place in the history books with the ‘B-Sides series on Music Man Records (another seminal Belgian label) with cuts like “Magic Orchestra”, “The Tape” “Traffic” and “Moral Soundabuse”. Music Man launched in 1989 and hit the rave wave with a series of releases that were immediately on the money — “Just A Techno Groove” by Sounds In Order (De Wulf and Gaetan Bouvie) and the acid/new beat hybrid “Danger Zone” by Fatal Attraction, for instance. Other Belgian tracks that epitomize the era include T99’s “Anasthasia” and the high-octane acid delirium that is “Gravity” by Trax-x.\n\nIf techno was still a new, far-out concept in the UK and Holland toward the late ‘80s, in Kraftwerk’s home country of Germany, it had been brewing for a few years. As early as 1984, DJ Talla 2XLC launched the legendary Technoclub night in Frankfurt. This predates the techno scene that appeared in Berlin by at least five years. And in 1985, Talla 2XLC recorded the hugely influential electronic cuts “Techno Talk” under the Moskwa TV moniker with Alexander Henninger, Ralf Henrich and Kurt Ader.\n\nBerlin’s pioneers include DJ Chris, who was resident at Metropol, one of the city’s forward-thinking gay spots. He liked to focus on the beats and basslines, keeping it minimal and hypnotic, rather than full-on vocal. Sylvester’s “Dance Disco Heat” by Sylvester, along with “The Break” by Kat Mandu and “Hot Shot” by Karen Young were among the favourites during the late seventies disco era, before the transition into HI-NRG with acts like Lime and Bobby O on regular rotation during the early eighties.\n\nMovements like Neue Deutsche Welle, which DAF were part of, krautrock and various experimentations with electronic synthesisers — Fad Gadget, Nitzer Ebb, The Normal etc — along with disco and funk, set the scene for what occurred in the late eighties when acid house exploded out of the UK and spread across Europe.\n\nOver to the west in Frankfurt, Sven Väth was making a name for himself. He went to Ibiza in 1980, decided he wanted to become a DJ and began playing records at his parents’ pub. Two years after the Ibiza trip, Sven landed a residency at Dorian Gray, where he met Michael Münzing and Luca Anziloti. The three men teamed up as OFF (Organisation for Fun) in 1985. In that time they achieved huge commercial success, with “Electrica Salsa”, a 1986 single which sold over a million copies. And then, in 1989, the Berlin Wall came crashing down. The impact was instant. East Berliners, who’d been living under a Soviet regime, finally had a taste of freedom and the future.\n\nMark Ernestus, founder of record shop Hard Wax, was also instrumental in bringing the Detroit sound to the German capital. The shop was and still is one of the most respected outlets for techno in Europe, if not the world. As Basic Channel, Ernestus and Moritz von Oswald pioneered the dub techno sound. Cuts like “Phylyps Trak” and “Quadrant Dub II”, along with their exploits as Maurizio, including “M04A”, “M06A,” and “Domina,” rank amongst some of the most influential and enduring techno to come from Germany.\n\nThe duo also launched offshoot labels, including Chain Reaction and Main Street, which released seminal records from artists like Vladislav Delay (“Huone”), Porter Ricks (‘Port Gentil”), and Monolake (“Cyan”) — the latter a project of Robert Henke, who went on to create Ableton.\n\nBy 1990, European techno had started to formalise and step into adolescence, while in America, a second wave of Detroit producers was hitting their stride. These included names like Kenny Larkin, Stacey Pullen, the late Mike Huckaby, Moodymann, Marcellus Pittman, Omar S, Brett Dancer, Scott Grooves, K-Hand, Claude Young, Daniel Bell and Carl Craig.\n\nBefore branching out on his own, Craig played drum machine and synthesisers in Derrick May’s live band. But his idiosyncratic approach to techno immediately set him apart, and he quickly became a respected member of the global techno fraternity, signing early tracks like “Crack Down” and “Elements” to May’s Transmat label. Later, Craig became synonymous with the jazzy, cerebral side of techno with cuts like “At Les”, “Sandstorms” and drum & bass instigator “Bug In The Bass Bin” under the Innerzone Orchestra alias. He also set up Planet E Communications, a label that he used to express himself freely while supporting friends and newcomers to the electronic music world.\n\nAcross the water in Windsor, Canada, Richie Hawtin was beginning to find his feet as a DJ and producer. Among his early releases was the showstopping 1991 collaboration with Joey Beltram and Mundo Musique as Final Exposure entitled “Vortex.” With fellow Canadian John Acquaviva he launched Plus 8 Records and began to carve out his own niche, splicing acid, harder edged techno and minimalist experimentations with his propensity for technical wizardry.\n\nOriginally using the pseudonyms States of Mind (with Aquaviva) and F.U.S.E., Hawtin really hit his stride with the Plastikman alias, which he conceived in 1993. His first release, “Spastik,” was an instant smash, becoming and remaining a ubiquitous peak-time club weapon. Other cuts that cemented Hawtin’s place among the greats include “Call It What You Want!,” “Minus / Orange 2,” ‘Technarchy,” “Bang the Box” (as Jack Master) and “F.U.” as F.U.S.E..\n\nIn 1998 he launched the M_nus label, which marked another step forward as an artist and label owner; curating a core family of artists around the label and expanding his exploration of the minimal sound. 2001’s DE9 | Closer To The Edit was a thrilling showcase of Hawtin’s technical skills, blending various components of existing tracks into entirely new ones, in a “first-of-its-kind” commercial DJ mix. Hawtin’s innovative outlook also extends into his performances, which have incorporated a wide range of technological developments over the past 20 years, his almost obsessive fascination with technology resulting in a setup that is light years of most other electronic music artists.\n\nAll of the aforementioned artists plus Jeff Mills, Carl Craig, Hawtin and Mathew Jonson and many others became part of the transatlantic exchange between the US, Canada and Europe, as their music flowed across the Atlantic Ocean to European shores and beyond. Eventually, they all spent time living in Europe too, where techno flourished much more than it did on home soil.\n\nTechno had strongholds in other parts of North America, with brothers Frankie Bones and Adam X near-singlehandedly launching the early ‘90s New York City rave scene, while Josh Wink in Philadelphia helped triangulate the nascent yet growing East Coast rave community. With trax-influenced tunes like 1992’s “Percolator,” Chicago’s Cajmere (and his Green Velvet alias) was central to the story; plus the Relief and Dance Mania crew, who formed strong bonds with Miss Djax in Holland. And DJ Rush emigrated from his native Chicago to Berlin, where he established himself a potent force, pumping parties full of energy with his entertaining persona and high-octane selections.\n\nIt was around the beginning of the nineties when the music began to split into various styles. Holland witnessed the extremes of gabber; London had jungle; France found French Touch, and people formed distinct tribes around trance, house, techno, hardcore and more.\n\nHolland’s Speedy J signed his first release to Richie Hawtin’s seminal Plus 8, while Orlando Voorn landed on Lower East Side Recordings with ‘Hey, Hey, Hey’ under his Frequency Moniker. 1991 saw the arrival of Hithouse Records, launched by the late Peter Slaghuis. The label was one of a few early Dutch labels that released homegrown house and techno. Bunker Records also launched in the early nineties, introducing the pioneering outfit Unit Moebius (Menno van Os, Guy Tavares, and Jan Duivenvoorden). Groundbreaking Dutch label Eevo Lute Muzique, founded by Wladimir M. and Stefan Robbers (AKA Florence/Terrace) arrived in 1991 and Clone Records was launched by Serge in 1992. Three years later Serge opened his first record store, and Clone entered the annals of Dutch electronic music history, becoming one of the country’s best-known and most influential brands. The ‘90s also gave birth to Rush Hour, which was opened in 1997 and has been at the heart of Amsterdam’s electronic music scene ever since.\n\nArtists including 2000 and One, Major Malfunctions, Steve Rachmad and Terrace appeared on the scene, pushing the music forward, while clubs such as Nighttown, Parkzicht, Mazzo and Roxy offered Dutch customers a glimpse into the future via the new techno sound.\n\nCheck out the Detroit Dub Techno soundpack on Loopcloud.\n\nIn 1990, Sven Väth’s pop group OFF split up. But Sven was running the Omen club, a techno boiler room in Frankfurt. He also launched labels Eye Q in 1990 and Harthouse in 1992, both of which were prolific throughout the decade. But it’s his decision to launch Cocoon in 1996 that would mark Sven’s longest lasting (and arguably largest) achievements in techno. Starting as a club night in Frankfurt, Cocoon first Ibiza party took place in 1999 at Amnesia, and remains one of the island’s longest running techno nights, spawning a booking agency and record label. The Cocoon Recroding’s earliest releases include outings from Frank Lorber with “Jailhouse Rocker”, Glove with “Drogenkontrolle”, Legowelt “Disco Rout” and Sven’s own classic “Face It”.\n\nOther artists that came out of Frankfurt’s fertile scene include Alter Ego/Roman Flügel and the Klang label; Ricardo Villalobos; and Chris Liebing, who co-established a harder style of techno known as Schranz. In Cologne, Kompakt was launched by Mike Ink/Wolfgang Voigt, Reinhard Voigt, Jörg Burger and Jürgen Paape, who were later joined by Michael Mayer. The label grew out of a record store called Delirium and arrived on the German scene in 1998.\n\nIn 1996 Munich’s DJ Hell launched International Deejay Gigolo Records, a label that rose became central to the electroclash movement of the early 2000s, but initially signed US acts l Jeff Mills and Anthony “Shake” Shakir; UK legends like DJ Naughty, Dave Clarke and DMX Crew; and Terrence Fixmer, Miss Kittin and The Hacker from France. Their fellow Frenchman, Vitalic, also released his seminal Poney EP with Hell’s label, which is said to be Germany’s most successful electronic music imprints.\n\nIn the UK in 1990, B12 Recordings was founded by Mike Golding and Steve Rutter, launching with “Musicology” by Musicology (Golding and Rutter). The EP included “Telefone 529,” which was later licensed to Warp. This was a precursor to what was later dubbed IDM or Intelligent Dance Music. The following year Steve Bicknell started up Lost with Sheree Rashit. Witnessing the explosion of rave culture and its subsequent division, Steve gravitated towards the deeper, darker sound of techno. Widely regarded as one of London’s premier techno parties, Lost set the bar high, bringing over people like Richie Hawtin for his earliest appearance in the capital.\n\nSeveral other techno parties popped up, including The Brain, Final Frontier at Wandsworth superclub Club UK, The Drum Club, Strutt and Best of British which became Open All Hours at Ministry of Sound, plus Vapourspace at the Fridge in Brixton. But Lost held the most allure, thanks to its mouthwatering lineups and focus on the immersive power of the dance floor, presenting techno music in spaces that complemented and often amplified its ominous power. They cultivated a close bond with Jeff Mills, whose track “The Bells” was a Lost anthem.\n\nFat Cat Records became one of the key techno hubs in London around this time, after relocating to Covent Garden from Crawley, West Sussex. Outside London, the Sheffield scene was making an impact. In the pre-Warp era, a number of pioneering acts formed in the northern city and eventually became the first wave to be signed to the electronic powerhouse. “LFO (The Leeds Warehouse Mix)” by LFO one of their earliest and most revered releases. The West Country had its own scene, with Aphex Twin emerging as one of the most innovative sound technicians. His track “Didgeridoo” one of many early examples of his near-limitless talent. In Birmingham, two of the most influential artists of the nineties arrived on the scene with Surgeon and Regis. The latter also launched a label, Downwards, and duo eventually teamed up as British Murder Boys. Together they were pivotal in creating a dark, industrial, typically grey British sound that continues to inspire techno artists around the world today.\n\nFrance caught the wave a little later with Guillaume La Tortue forming the core of the burgeoning underground scene in Paris. Along with Laurent Garnier and David Guetta, he was one of the main faces at Jean-Claude Lagrèze’s French Touch parties at The Palace. La Tortue went into production, landing on labels such as Music Man (“Salinas”), Chronobrain, and Chris Carrier’s Adult Only.\n\nEventually, a hardcore techno scene formed in France, with Manu Le Malin leading the charge. In the mid-nineties he appeared on Lenny Dee’s Industrial Strength label and began his production career. Manu straddled the worlds of techno and hardcore for a while, using the alias The Driver for his techno work. On that first release he worked with Thomas Bangalter, who went on to become one of the most famous and influential French electronic music artists in history as one half of Daft Punk. Manu set up in Montpellier and the city became one of the key outposts for techno in France. The aptly-named Jack de Marseille was at the forefront of his city’s small but dedicated scene, both hosting a night called Atomix at La Luna and opening a record store called Wax Records. Among the many weapons in his artillery were cuts like D-Shake’s “Techno Trance,” “Chime” by Orbital and Master Techno with “My Noise.”\n\nAlso in the south, La Tribu des Pingouins (Penguin Tribe) came to the fore as an influential collective that covered all the bases — they organised raves and set up a record label and record store called Pingouins. Their party Boréalis, launched in August 1993, brought in thousands of people at every event. One of the group’s members, Josselin Hirsch, founded Technopol, an activist/lobbying group that works to support and defend rave culture, and which organised France’s first techno parade, inspired by the Love Parade in Berlin. By 1996 the crowds at Boréalis had grown from 2,000 to 25,000, and they were hosting summer parties under the name Polaris. Though Boréalis came to an end in 1999, Technopol is still going strong today.\n\nThe Batofar held a special place in many Parisian hearts, as did Rex Club, which became the city’s key electronic music club after Garnier planted the seed. In more recent years Possession, Concrete, Djoon, Badaboum, La Machine Du Moulin Rouge, La Petit Bain and Zig Zag were among the clubs that catered for techno, along with plenty of clandestine warehouse raves across the city. Artists like Bambounou, Francois X, Scan X, Shlømo, DJ Deep, Traumer, Leo Pol, NDOS, Polar Inertia and Antigone representing the sounds of today.\n\nBy 1996, Beyer had launched his own label based on the simple premise of releasing DJ tools created strictly for the dance floor. The first EP did exactly that, with Beyer and Dahlbäck teaming up as Beyer & Lenk to produce four untitled dancefloor-focused techno cuts. Since those early days, Drumcode has become one of the world’s most popular and recognisable techno brands, with a global radio broadcast and legions of diehard fans, who travel to Drumcode events all over the world. Beyer himself has achieved superstar status, but has always been eager to share the love, with a career-making roster that’s signed some of today’s best-known techno purveyors, including Alan Fitzpatrick, Reset Robot, Ida Engberg, ANNA, Sam Paganini, Victor Calderone, Enrico Sangiuliano and many more.\n\nBut Sweden’s impact on techno hasn’t all been the DJ tool variety: Sweden’s Eric Prydz also hit the world stage, using the alias Cirez D for his techno experiments. Prydz achieved major commercial success, but maintains an underground presence through his pseudonym and is one of Sweden’s most famous electronic music stars.\n\nIn Spain, the early nineties belonged to Oscar Mulero, who earned his stripes at the New World Club before going to open his own club The Omen (not to be confused with Väth’s club) with some friends. He eventually caught the attention of international observers when he was booked to play at the third Sonar Festival, after it launched in 1994. His label Polegroup is one of the foremost Spanish techno labels and Oscar became a global icon in the years that followed that first Sonar performance. Other key Spanish DJs during this time were Reeko, Exium (Valentín Corujo and Héctor Sandoval) and Christian Wünsch, all of whom turned to production towards the end of the decade. Wünsch started his own label Tsunami, while Reeko also launched his own label, Mental Disorder, which he uses as a platform for his prolific output under different personalities."
