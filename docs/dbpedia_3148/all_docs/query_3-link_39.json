        "text": "For much of the last four years, Big Ben has been silent. But that all changed on New Year’s Eve 2021, when the great clock was struck 12 times.\n\nFirst things first, did you know that Big Ben is the nickname for a bell inside the famous clock tower?\n\nThe tower itself was simply called the Clock Tower until 2012 when it was renamed Elizabeth Tower to mark the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee.\n\nWhat tune does Big Ben play?\n\nThe tune that Big Ben plays contains only four notes – G sharp, F sharp, E and B – and different parts of the tune are played at quarter past, half past and quarter to the hour in Westminster.\n\nThe tune is called Westminster Quarters, but its original name was the Cambridge Quarters, because it actually comes from Cambridge and was first played in Great St Mary's Church in the centre of Cambridge.\n\nRead more: Ancient church bells ring out Motörhead’s ‘Ace of Spades’ to an unsuspecting crowd\n\nIt was written in 1793 for a new clock in St Mary the Great in Cambridge but it’s not clear exactly who composed it.\n\nThe job was given to one Dr Joseph Jowett but he may have been helped by Dr John Randall, a Professor of Music, or one of his pupils, William Crotch (a composer and organist).\n\nThe tune was adopted by Westminster in the mid-19th century.\n\nWhen does Big Ben chime?\n\nThe longest version of the tune is only heard every hour when it is followed by the strikes for the hour.\n\nBut that version isn’t actually complete – the chime that’s heard at quarter past isn’t heard in this long version (seen here at the bottom):\n\nImage: bellhistorians.org.uk\n\nAnd here's an epic fantasy on the famous tune, Vierne's Carillon de Westminster, played on the organ of Winchester Cathedral by Richard McVeigh:\n\nWhy did Big Ben ‘bong’ on New Year’s Day?\n\nWith the clock face recently emerging from the tower’s scaffolding which has encased the famous landmark for the last few years, Londoners were excited to hear Big Ben’s bell chime again as a new year began in 2022.\n\nAt midnight on New Year's Day, the bell was struck 12 times using a temporary drive mechanism, which replicates the chime created by the original Victorian mechanism which drops a hammer on the bell ever 4.5 seconds.\n\nBig Ben and the four quarter bells are set to resume sounding the famous daily ‘Westminster Quarters’ melody and resonant bongs using the original mechanism in Spring 2022.\n\nWhere else can you hear the Westminster chimes?\n\nThe Westminster Quarters is now the most popular tune for church bells and can be heard all over the country.\n\nSo if you’re missing the famous sound of Big Ben while its tower is being renovated, here are just a few of the places you can hear the tune:"
