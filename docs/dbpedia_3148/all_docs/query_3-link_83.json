Rather than waiting for the lockdown to end, I decided to publish this essay realizing that it is still a work in progress. To the extent my goal with this website is to make public domain ragtime era sheet music more easily available, I think I have achieved that even though this essay lacks detailed analysis of some of the composers and their scores and I lack the expertise in classical music to put all of the classical music composers discussed below into their proper historical context. Instead, my approach to the topic is to provide a broad overview or appreciation of the topic rather than any attempt at serious music scholarship. Where appropriate, I indicate below those areas requiring additional research and commentary. I welcome comments and suggestion by email to \"owner\" at \"ragtimepiano.ca\". Major changes to this essay will be summarized on the What's New page.\n\n1) Introduction\n\n2) Ragtime era composers who \"ragged\" the classics\n\n3) Ragtime era composers who \"classicized\" ragtime\n\n4) Jazz and modern era composers who \"jazzed\" the classics\n\n5) Ragtime and jazz motifs in classical music\n\n6) Recordings and performances\n\n7) Bibliography\n\n1) Introduction [toc] [top]\n\nThis essay discusses classical music in ragtime and jazz and the influence of ragtime and jazz on classical music composers. The technique of \"ragging the classics\" involves the composer or performer using the melody from a piece well-known classical music and syncopating the tune with ragtime syncopation. Just as as ragtime composers would syncopate the melodies of classic music compositions, classical music composers were also influenced by the melodies and rhythms of ragtime music. Although I usually view classic ragtime piano narrowly, as covering a roughly 20-year period from 1899 to 1919, this essay also touches up \"jazzing the classics\" and jazz motifs in classical music that followed the ragtime era through to to ragtime revival era to present. As a result, this essay includes a fairly broad array of composers and performers beyond the usual suspects.\n\nIn Rags and Ragtime: A Musical History, in speaking of the advanced era of ragtime from 1913 to 1917, the authors note that \"[o]ne of the oldest show business devices is to take a classical composition and syncopate it\" and the \"[t]he ragging of the classics suddenly blossomed forth in this era with great skill and cleverness\" (Jasen & Tichenor: 172). Berlin notes in similar terms that \"'[r]agging the classics' was an especially popular exercise\" and documents the following description of Ben Harney \"ragging the classics\" in 1899:\n\nHis performances including the \"ragging\" of such popular classic's as Mendelssohn's Spring Song, Rubenstein's Melody in F, and the Intermezzo from Mascagni's \"Cavalleria Rusticana,\" which he would first play in their orthodox form. The effect was startling [Berlin: 67].\n\nLikewise, author John Edward Hasse in \"Ragtime: From the Top\" in Ragtime: Its History, Composers, and Music, notes that the \"ragging\" of the classics predates the publication of ragtime sheet music and that many of these performances were never transcribed:\n\n[Another] type of ragtime was \"ragging\" of classics or other preexisting music. Mendelssohn's \"Spring Song\" and \"Wedding March\" and Rubenstein's \"Melody in F\" were among the favorite classics for \"ragging.\" To \"rag\" is to syncopate the melody of nonsyncopated work. This technique, which predates the first publication of rags by several decades, was a common performance practice of pianists. Most of this type of ragtime, like most modern jazz improvisations on existing popular songs, was probably never written down or recorded (Hasse: 6).\n\nAnother view regarding ragtime and classic music is that some \"classic\" ragtime piano approaches being \"classical music\" in its own right. Gunther Schuller, for example, in \"Rags, the Classics, and Jazz\" in Hasse, Ragtime: Its History, Composers, and Music, argues that some of the more sophisticated instrumental rags, such as Lamb's Ragtime Nightingale, could be considered as having the same complexity and expressiveness as some classical music compositions:\n\nClassical yearnings in ragtime may take another form of expression: in the overall mood or stance of a piece, as in the many rags of Joseph Lamb (1887-1960). Take his moving, poignant Ragtime Nightingale (1915), an extensive \"mood poem,\" albeit within the standard duration and multithematic form of the piano rag. Unhurried, contemplative, at once simple and grand, haunting, and at times vigorously swinging, Ragtime Nightingale embodies the full spectrum of ragtime's expressions. From the almost Tchaikovskian moodiness of the opening C-minor section with its graceful descending sixths in the middle measures, through the more energetic E-flat second theme to the scintillating Trio in A flat, the piece is a pure joy to hear [Hasse: 86].\n\nA 1925 article from Melody magazine also argues that American ragtime and jazz music was its own form of American classical music:\n\nOur highbrows for years have talked much of the need of declaring our independence of old world forms and inspirations. Well here we have it, in musical forms which are as intensely and significantly American as Verdi's are Italian, or Schumann and Wagner, German. It is as racy as our soil as an Irish folk song is of Ireland. It is the rush of our racing streets. It has all the bright contrasts of our racial conglomerate. It has our moods and our spirit, our impudence and irreverence, our joy in speed and force. American musical genius has in ragtime and jazz contributed something of great vitality to the art of music, in its rhythms and new colorings. [Rackett: 3]\n\nIn fact, John Stark, the main publisher of Scott Joplin, James Scott, and Joseph Lamb, was known for his hyperbolic marketing of the \"classic\" ragtime sheet music published by his company, and in the following statement puts Stark-published rags on par with the \"genius\" and \"psychic advance thought\" of compositions by Chopin and Bach:\n\nSince we forced the conviction on this country that what is called a rag may possibly contain more genius and psychic advance thought than a Chopin nocturne or Bach fugue, writers of diluted and attenuated imitations have sprung up from Maine's frozen hills to the boiling bogs of Louisiana (Blesh: 118).\n\nClassical musical composer Darius Milhaud (discussed below) also argued at the time that the elements of tone and rhythm in the orchestrated jazz music played by Paul Whiteman's orchestra (including compositions by Gershwin) were a form of (American) classical music that puts to shame the need to \"rag the classics\":\n\nThey have brought us absolutely new elements of tone and rhythm of which they are perfect masters. But these jazz bands have hitherto been used only for dancing, and the music written for them has not got beyond ragtime, the foxtrot, and the shimmy. It was a mistake to adapt pieces of music already famous  ranging from Tosca's prayer to 'Peer Gynt' or Grechaninov's Berceuse  making use of their melodic elements as dance themes. This is an error of taste, as bad in its way as the employment of motor-sirens with percussion instruments. [Milhaud: 171]\n\nHowever, musician Frederick Hodges in his essay \"Is Ragtime 'Classical Music'?\" points out the differences between ragtime and classical music, arguing that ragtime as \"popular\" music arose due to different purposes and motivations (including the sale of sheet music) whereas composers of classical music had different motivations:\n\nRagtime is not classical music. Ragtime is popular music. Classical music and popular music serve entirely different purposes and have diametrically opposed motivations behind their creation. In general, a classical composer uses music to express his deepest emotions and experiences. Classical music arouses the intellect and the passions. It addresses the deepest questions of human existence. Classical music is sophisticated and intelligent. The impression is that it cannot be appreciated by the uninititated and the uneducated. Of course, classical composers were traditionally supported and constrained by the patronage system. Poverty may have obliged Mozart to accept commissions for works he might not otherwise of written, but his patrons probably never asked him to \"dumb it down.\" The point of sale was a single event  the check from the patron rather than multiple points from a sheet-music buying public.\n\nHodges does acknowledge the intrinsic qualities of certain ragtime compositions (and I don't think he would necessarily disagree with Schuller's appreciation of Lamb's Ragtime Nightingale) and that the relation between ragtime and classical music may be quite fluid:\n\nWhile it would be a grave mistake to equate the rags of Scott Joplin or the popular songs of Cole Porter or George Gershwin with classical music, the musical output of these and many other popular composers was nevertheless of such excellent quality that it may (and should) endure for centuries as the pinnacle of American musical achievement in the twentieth century. Indeed, as Rifkin's recordings and as Gershwin's successful forays into classical music proved, the border between popular and classical music could be quite fluid. In fact, many composers of popular music, such as Gershwin and Ferde Grofé, easily transitioned back and forth between between popular and classical music. Nevertheless, Joplin and Gershwin are among the exceptions. Few would argue that the George Botsford's \"Black and White Rag\" belongs in the same category as Igor Stravinsky's \"The Rite of Spring.\"\n\nThis essay addresses the relationship between ragtime, jazz and classical music by first looking at compositions from the ragtime and jazz era that use classical motifs and by then looking at classical music composers who were influenced by ragtime and jazz.\n\nAs such, section 2 below sets out sheet music, when available, for ragtime era compositions where composers  including those by Felix Arndt, Irving Berlin, Alex Christensen, Edward Claypoole, George Cobb, Artie Matthews, and Paul Pratt  employed classical motifs or ragged the compositions of classical music composers. Section 3 below instead discusses ragtime era composers who \"classicized\" ragtime with their more sophisticated ragtime compositions. Section 4 below then moves to the jazz and modern era by discussing and modern era composers and performers who \"ragged\" and \"jazzed\" the classics, such as George Gershwin and Alec Templeton. Section 5 below then discusses ragtime and jazz motifs in classical music, including compositions by Claude Debussy and Erik Satie. Section 6 below sets out links to commercial and online recordings of \"ragging\" and \"jazzing\" the classics followed in section 7 below with a bibliography of resources.\n\n2) Ragtime era composers who \"ragged\" the classics[toc] [top]\n\nThere were a number of ragtime era composers who published compositions on classical music themes or who were influenced by classical music, the most well known of which in this genre include Felix Arndt, Irving Berlin, Alex Christensen, Edward Claypoole, George Cobb, Artie Matthews, and Paul Pratt. The sheet music to compositions by these and other ragtime era composers is set out below by composer, as follows:\n\na)\n\nHarry Alford\n\nb)\n\nFelix Arndt c)\n\nIrving Berlin\n\nd)\n\nAlex Christensen e)\n\nEdward Claypoole\n\nf)\n\nGeorge Cobb g)\n\nCarleton Colby\n\nh)\n\nZez Confrey\n\ni)\n\nGeorge Fairman\n\nj)\n\nBert Grant\n\nk)\n\nArthur Gutman\n\nl)\n\nE.

Within a few years, just about everyone in the entertainment business wanted their music scored by him. Business boomed, and between 1904 and 1924, his studio turned out over 34,000 separate arrangements!\n\nBenjamin notes that some of Alford's most famous arrangements include \"Some of These Days\" (1910), \"Melancholy Baby\" (1912), \"Let Me Call You Sweetheart\" (1910), \"I Ain't Got Nobody\" (1916), \"The Darktown Strutter's Ball\" (1916), \"It Had to be You\" (1924) and \"Down by the Old Mill Stream\" (1910). The following of his compositions are available online: Glad Days: Novelette (1920) and Soul of the Violet: Romance (1922).\n\nIn the following piece, Alford has given orchestral ragtime treatment to \"Chi me Frena in Tal Momento\" from Gaetano Donizetti's opera Lucia de Lammermoor:\n\nb) Felix Arndt [toc] [top]\n\nFelix Arndt (20 May 1889  15 October 1918) was an American composer and prolific maker of piano rolls.\n\nTwo of his more famous rag/novelty compositions are Nola: A Silhouette for Piano (1914) and Marionette (1914) (for a 1917 Victor recording of Felix Arndt playing Marionette, click here).\n\nArndt's most famous example of syncopating classical music is his Desecration Rag from 1914 setting out ragtime versions of the following classical compositions:\n\nAntonín Dvořák: Humoresques [listen to classical version]\n\nFranz Liszt: Hungarian Rhapsody no. 2 for Piano [listen to performance of Liszt's version by Valentina Lisitsa]\n\nChristian Sinding: Rustle of Spring [listen to classical version]\n\nFrederic Chopin: Impromptu [listen to classical version]\n\nFrederic Chopin: Militaire Polonaise [listen to classical version]\n\nFrederic Chopin: Funeral March [listen to classical version]\n\nFelix Arndt, Desecration: Rag Humoresque (New York: G.

Smith) (1914), which features his Syncopated Walk (1914) [listen to 1915 recording], the composer also rags opera tunes in the Act II Finale in \"Opera in Modern Time\" in which, as noted in the Wikipedia article for this musical, melodies from famous operas were turned into popular dances of the time, with the ghost of Verdi appearing to protest the ragging of his Rigoletto, to no avail (the operas parodied include Verdi's Rigoletto and Aida, Gounods Faust, Bizets Carmen, Puccinis La Bohème, and Leoncavallos Pagliacci) (note: the sheet music below has the title Ragtime Opera Medley):\n\nFor a large online collection of Irving Berlin sheet music, see the online holdings of Irving Berlin songs from the Lester S.

Christensen, 1909)at 25 shows his typical, simplified and formulaic approach to syncopating melodies:\n\nThe first example below by Christensen of \"ragging the classics\" is his ragtime version of Mendelssohn's Wedding March:\n\nAxel Christensen, Ragtime Wedding March (Apologies to Mendelssohn) (Chicago: Christensen School, 1908).\n\n[view sheet music] [listen to ragtime version]\n\nSource: Library of Congress, Music Division [top]\n\nAnother example is Christensen ragging Gustav Lange's Flower Song (Blumenlied):\n\nIn the following piece, Christensen does his ragtime versions of the following classical compositions: Franz Liszt's Liebestraum, Anton Rubinstein's Melody in F, and My Heart at Thy Sweet Voice from Camille Saint-Saëns's Samson and Delilah:\n\nAxel Christensen, Teasing the Klassics (Chicago: Forster Music, 1923).

He is also known for his Reuben Fox Trot (1914) and American Jubilee (1916). Despite working most of his life as a court clerk, Claypoole is credited with over 500 compositions, including a number of novelty rags, such as Jazzapation (1920), Skidding  Novelty Solo (1923), Dusting the Keys (A Dusty Rag Fox Trot) (1923), and Bouncing on the Keys (1924): Jasen and Tichenor (1978): 172-73.\n\nIn Ragging the Scale (below), Claypoole does a clever riff on traditional piano scale exercises, selling over 2 million copies (for a modern homage to this piece, see Bill Edward's Hanon Rag, discussed below).\n\nHowever, according to Jasen and Tichenor, Claypoole saw no royalties for Ragging the Scale since Claypoole sold the piece outright to the publisher for $25 (Jasen and Tichenor (1978): 172-73.\n\nFor Claypoole to have been denied royalties is perhaps appropriate because, according to Al Rose's humorous re-telling of Eubie Blake's account of this piece in Eubie Blake [Rose: 40-41], Eubie Blake had in fact perfected ragging the scale in five keys in playful competitions with Hughie Wolford in 1905 or 1906 in Baltimore, well prior to Claypoole publishing \"his\" version in 1915.\n\nEdward Claypoole, Ragging the Scale (New York: Broadway Music Corporation, 1915).\n\n[view sheet music] [listen to transcribed piano roll played by Charley Straight]\n\nSource: Digital Commons@Connecticut College [top]\n\nf) George Cobb [toc] [top]\n\nIn my separate essay on George Cobb I set out links to all of his 215 known ragtime-related compositions, including some of his more famous pieces, such as Rubber Plant Rag: A Stretcherette (1909), Aggravation Rag (1910), Rabbit's Foot (1915), The Midnight Trot (1916), Cracked Ice Rag (1918), Irish Confetti: Fox Trot (1918), Feeding the Kitty: A Ragtime One-Step (1919), and Piano Salad (1923).\n\nKnown as a clever and prolific tune-smith, Cobb also dabbled in \"ragging the classics.\"\n\nIn the first example, Cobb rags the main melodies from \"In the Hall of the Mountain King\" from Edvard Grieg's Peer Gynt, Suite No. 1, Op. 46:\n\nThe next example, the Russian Rag, was likely one of Cobb's most famous of all of his many compositions, being his ragtime version of Rachmaninoff's Prelude in C-sharp minor, Op.3, No.2, a piece that was so popular that he did a \"new\" version of the rag in 1923, listed below.\n\nCobb returned to Edvard Grieg's Peer Gynt, Suite No. 1, Op. 46 by ragging the second song in that suite, \"Aase's Death\" in the following piece:\n\nGeorge Cobb, Asa's Toddy: One Step (with Apologies to Mr Grieg) (New York: Jerome H Remick, 1920).\n\n[view sheet music] [listen to MIDI file of Cobb's rag version] [listen to original classical version]\n\nSource: Photocopy from the Center for Popular Music, Middle Tennessee State University [top]\n\nCobb also arranged a ragtime version of the \"Anvil Chorus\" from Giuseppe Verdi's Il Trovatore with the Blacksmith Rag by Rednip (an alias for Harold Pinder) with words by Will Garton and Leo Wood:\n\nGeorge Cobb (arranger), Blacksmith Rag (with the \"Anvil Chorus\") (words by Will Garton and Leo Wood) (composed by Rednip) (Boston: Ted Garton Music Co, 1920).\n\n[view sheet music] [listen to MIDI file of Cobb's arranged version] [listen to classical version by Royal Opera House]\n\nSource: Indiana University Sheet Music Collections [top]\n\nIn the following piece, as noted by Hodges, Cobb syncopated several themes from the music of Anto nín Dvořák:\n\nIn the following piece, as also noted by Hodges, Cobb syncopated several themes from the music of Franz Schuberts \"Ave Maria\" and themes by Moritz Moszkowski:\n\nIn Torrid Dora (Toreador), a piece listed in That American Rag [ Jasen and Jones (2000):374], Cobb does his ragtime take on the \"Toreador's Song\" from Carmen by Georges Bizet:\n\nGeorge Cobb, Torrid Dora (Toreador) (Chicago: Will Rossiter, 1921).

Both pianists could spontaneously weave snippets of melody from popular songs and classical masterpieces into an engaging and often humourous musical commentary on the events silently unfolding on the theatre screen (Gilmore 1988: 17).\n\nIn the fall of 1916, Harry Thomas went to Chicago to record piano rolls for QRS Company and then on to New York to record Delirious Rag and Perpetual Rag for Metro-Art and Universal (Gilmore 1988: 17). Later that year, he returned to New York to record for Victor Talking Machine a 78 rpm with Delirious Rag on one side and A Classical Spasm on the other side, also manufactured in Montreal by the Berliner Gramophone Company (see above for his recording of A Classical Spasm). These recordings, according to Gilmore (1989:281) made Thomas the first musician resident in Canada to record ragtime.\n\nHarry Thomas is included here for the following recording even though no sheet music for the composition is known to exist:\n\nHarry Thomas, A Classical Spasm (Camden, NJ: Victor, 1917): .mp3 (from Library and Archives Canada) (other Harry Thomas recordings (not ragtime) are available here).\n\nFor an incredible performance by Mimi Blais of her take on fellow Canadian Willie Eckstein's Musical Massacre (a parody of Chopin), see her online performance listed below.\n\nv) Edward Winn [toc] [top]\n\nEdward Winn, who began his School of Popular Music in Newark, N.J., in 1901 (Jason and Jones, TAR: 124), was the author of various ragtime instruction manuals, including Winn's Practical Method of Popular Music: Rag and Jazz Piano Playing (circa 1920), listed in my separate essay on Alex Christensen and the ragtime instruction manuals of Christensen and others.\n\nIn addition, from 1918 to 1919, Winn also authored a column in Melody magazine called 'Ragging the Popular Song Hits\" that, in addition to the popular song hits of the time, included the following \"silent movie music\" based on themes by classical music composers (and even though the following compositions are not heavily syncopated and many were arranged by in-house arrangers, it would not be difficult for the serious student to \"rag\" these classical compositions):\n\nSeries A: Excerpts from Schubert (Sonata in A Minor, Death and the Maiden, The Erlking) in (December 1918) 2:12 Melody 10.\n\nSeries B: Excerpts from Beethoven (Sonata Pathètique, Adelaide, On the Death of a Hero) in (January 1919) 3:1 Melody 9.\n\nSeries C: Excerpts from Schumann (Sonata in D Minor, Why?, Santa Clause) in (February 1919) 3:2 Melody 9.\n\nSeries D: Excerpts from Grieg (A Ride at Night, At Thy Feet, Watchman's Song) in (March 1919) 3:3 Melody 9.\n\nSeries E: Excerpts from Tchaikowsky (Harvest Song, Autumn Song, Hunter's Song) in (April 1919) 3:4 Melody 9.\n\nSeries F: Excerpts from Mendelssohn (Scherzo in B Minor, Song Without Words No. 27, Capricio in A Minor) in (May 1919) 3:5 Melody 10.\n\nSeries G: Excerpts from Verdi (Aida) (The Fatal Question, Pity, Kind Heaven, Nile's Sacred River) in (June 1919) 3:6 Melody 10.\n\nSee also:\n\n\"Melody in F: A Little Stunt for Left Hand Only\" (arranged by Edwrd Winn) (March 1920) 4:3 Melody 13.\n\n\"Flower Song\" (Ragtime Waltz) in HJ Beckerman, The American School of Ragtime Piano Playing (Chicago: SM Mautner, 1918) at 40.\n\nSimilar to the various ragtime instruction manuals discussed in my essay on Alex Christensen, there were a number of ragtime era \"film music\" folios published, aimed at pianists and organists who played the keyboards during silent films. Two examples from the Silent Film Sound & Music Archive, are the following folios that provide the piano music for various pieces of classical music, appropriately identified for different types of movie scenes (car chase, romantic scene, and so on).

Simply put, whether you agree or not with Schuller's characterization, these are composers of \"classic\" ragtime whose works usually transcend the crassness of some Tin Pan Alley or honky-tonk ragtime music.\n\na)\n\nEubie Blake\n\nb)\n\nWill Marion Cook\n\nc)\n\nScott Joplin\n\nd)\n\nJoseph Lamb\n\ne)\n\nArtie Matthews\n\na) Eubie Blake [toc] [top]James Herbert \"Eubie\" Blake (7 February 1887  12 February 1983) was a legendary ragtime composer and performer, famous for a number of unique ragtime instrumentals and his partnership with Noble Sissle and their production of the Broadway Music Shuffle Along.\n\nIn my separate essay on Ragtime in Canada, I discuss Eubie Blake's influence, along with John Arpin and other Canadians, of promoting the ragtime revival in Canada with Blake's many visits to Toronto in the 1969's and 1970's to perform.\n\nIn Eubie Blake, author Al Rose describes Blake as having been \"deeply affected by the music of Mozart, Chopin, Tchaikowsky, and George Gershwin\" [Rose: 156] and describes the \"classical\" nature of Eubie's compositions in the following terms:\n\nIt is as a composer of classics and semiclassics that Eubie has done sóme of his most exciting, though least known, work. \"Dictys on Seventh Avenue,\" his \"graduation piece\" for his New York University degree, is in the Reginald Forsythe-David Rose mold but is nevertheless pure Eubie, as is his Gershwinesque \"Capricious Harlem.\" Most surprising and most difficult to identify with Eubie are the two exotic etudes \"Rain Drops\" and \"Butterfly.\" These delicate little tone poems are clearly in the genre of Debussy, with a hint of Richard Strauss. They are in no way imitative, though. It's just that these earlier composers established forms in which Eubie is supremely at ease. \"Rain Drops\" is built on a single note set ingeniously, like a diamond, in a ring of complex chords. It is slow in tempo, a \"mood\" piece, yet it is exciting. Excruciatingly restrained and suspenseful, it may ultimately go farthest in establishing Eubie's credentials in the ranks of formal classical composers. \"Butterfly\" has a more programmatic character. Eubie captures flutters and silences in a gossamer of taste and sensitivity. [Rose: 157-58]\n\nSome of Eubie Blake's more famous piano compositions include the following pieces:\n\nNovelty Rag (1910)\n\nTickle the Ivories (1911)\n\nThe Chevy Chase (1914) [view sheet music]\n\nFizz Water (1914) [view sheet music]\n\nBugle Call Rag (1916 [view full orchestral score from Library of Congress]\n\nCharleston Rag (1917) [listen to a recording by Eubie Blake]\n\nI'm Just Wild About Harry (1921) [view sheet music]\n\nBaltimore Buzz (1921) [listen to recording by Shuffle Along orchestra]\n\nRain Drops (1924)\n\nMemories of You (1930) [listen to recording by Eubie Blake]\n\nCapricious Harlem (1930) [purchase sheet music arranged by William Bolcom] [listen to recording by Eubie Blake]\n\nTricky Fingers (1959) [listen to performance by Morten Gunnar Larsen]\n\nButterfly (1960)\n\nDicty's on Seventh Avenue (1962) [listen to performance by Martin Spitznagel]\n\nTroublesome Ivories (1911, 1971) [listen to performance by Stephanie Trick]\n\nMelodic Rag (1972) [listen to a recording by Eubie Blake]\n\nNovelty Rag (1972)\n\nRandi's Rag (1974)\n\nBetty Washboard's Rag (1975)\n\nThe transcriptions by Terry Waldo of the following Eubie Blake compositions are available in Sincerely Eubie Blake (Brooklyn, NY: Eubie Blake Music, 1975) (publisher's website):\n\nThe Baltimore Todolo (1962) [listen to performance by Mimi Blais]\n\nBrittwood Rag (1962) [listen to recording by Eubie Blake]\n\nThe Charleston Rag (1917) [listen to recording by Eubie Blake]\n\nEubie Dubie (with John Guarinieri) (1972) [listen to recording]\n\nEubie's Classical Rag (1972) [listen to performance by Max Morath]\n\nKitchen Tom (1962) [listen to recording by Eubie Blake]\n\nPoor Jimmy Green (1969) [listen to recording by Eubie Blake]\n\nPoor Katie Red (Eubie's Slow Drag) (1960)\n\nRhapsody in Ragtime (1975) [listen to performance by Richard Dowlings]\n\nFor a folio of waltzes by Eubie Blake, see Eubie Blake: Original Classic Waltzes for the Piano (New York: Edwards B.

Chords might strike me first, or a melody, or a conjunction of chord and melody. I kept it working it over until I got something. With my Ragtime Nightingale, it was the name that struck me first. You may have noticed that in the beginning of the trio I use a little part of Ethelbert Nevin's Nightingale Song. I saw it in an Etude magazine of my sisters'. I usually got one complete strain finished and the others would follow, but the strains have to fit with each other.\n\n[Blesh and Janis: 238]\n\nThe opening arpeggiated chord from Ragtime Nightingale is said to have also been based on Chopin's Etude in C Minor, Opus 10, no 12 (\"Revolutionary Etude\").\n\ne) Artie Matthews [toc] [top]\n\nArtie Matthews (15 November 1888  25 October 1958) was a ragtime composer most famous for his \"Pastime\" rags (below) and Weary Blues (1915). Matthews also arranged Baby Seals Blues (by Baby F. Seals) (1912) and Birmingham Blues (with Charles McCord) (1922), among other things.\n\nLike Nathaniel Dett, Artie Matthews focused on classical music after the ragtime era ended by establishing with his wife Anna in 1921 the Cosmopolitan School of Music, a music school for African Americans, where Matthews taught until his death.\n\nIn Ragtime: An Encyclopedia, Discography, and Sheetography, David Jasen says this about Artie Matthews in describing the \"Pastime\" rags:\n\nThe five \"Pastimes\" reveal his milieu in theatre work; they are bold and dramatic, extraordinarily pianistic, and reflect the vaudeville side of ragtime, but within the polished Classic rag format. From the perspective of early Classic ragtime, these works are innovations in the idiom [Jasen: 142-43].\n\nArtie Matthews, Pastime Rag No. 1 (St. Louis, MO: Stark Music Co., 1913).\n\n[view sheet music]\n\nSource: Library of Congress [top]\n\nArtie Matthews, Pastime Rag No. 2 (St. Louis, MO: Stark Music Co., 1913).\n\n[view sheet music]\n\nSource: Charles H Templeton Sheet Music Collection (MSU) [top]\n\nArtie Matthews, Pastime Rag No. 3 (St. Louis, MO: Stark Music Co., 1916).\n\n[view sheet music]\n\nSource: International Music Score Library Project (IMSLP) [top]\n\n4) Jazz and modern era composers who \"jazzed\" the classics [toc] [top]\n\nThe ragtime era, traditionally viewed as being from 1899 to 1919, was gradually eclipsed by the growth and popularity of jazz music, a phenomena that also saw classic music being \"jazzed\" in the same way that it had been \"ragged\" in the past. This section discusses the following jazz era composers and performers who \"jazzed\" the classics in one way or another along with those ragtime and jazz composers from the ragtime revival era to present who have ragged or jazzed the classics:\n\na)\n\nGeorge Gershwin b)\n\nAlec Templeton c)\n\nFats Waller d)\n\nModern examples of ragging and jazzing the classics\n\na) George Gershwin [toc] [top]\n\nGeorge Gershwin (26 September 1898  11 July 1937) was a prolific composer whose short career spanned ragtime, jazz, Broadway musicals, classical music and Hollywood film scores.\n\nSome of Gershwin's more well-known compositions include Swanee (1919), Rhapsody in Blue (1924), Fascinating Rhythm (1924), Concerto in F (1925), An American in Paris (1928), I Got Rhythm (1930), and Porgy and Bess (1935).\n\nHe has not yet been widely discussed on this website since my focus is on instrumental ragtime piano from the era of classical ragtime piano (circa 1899 to 1917). Gershwin is included here despite not having published music that ragged the classics because he, like Nathaniel Dett, Scott Joplin and Artie Matthews, gained experience composing traditional ragtime but \"evolved\" to compose or focus on classical music (and, in Gershwin's case, orchestrated jazz music) and otherwise is someone whose compositions would fall into Schuller's notion above that classical yearnings in ragtime ear compositions may be expressed in the overall mood or stance of a piece.\n\nIn That American Rag [Jason and Jones (2000): 289], the authors describe Gershwin's work as a teenager as a song-plugger for Joseph Remick in New York:\n\nFor 3 years in the mid-teens Remick's star demonstrator was George Gershwin, who pounded out the firm's tunes in a piano cubicle for $15 a week. Gershwin was not able to place his own songs with his employer during his tenure, but in June 1917, three months after he left, Remick published his only rag, Rialto Ripples (co-composed with Will Donaldson).\n\nDuring that time, Gershwin is said to have recorded hundreds of piano rolls, sometimes under aliases such as Fred Murtha and Bert Wynn, including his Perfection #86738 piano roll (as Fred Murtha) of Artie Matthews' Pastime Rag No. 3. For a video performance of Rialto Ripples by Jeffrey Biegel, click here. For commentary on Rialto Ripples, click here.\n\nGershwin is also included here for the rag version he wrote as a teenager on Robert Schumman's \"Traumerei\" from Kinderszenen, Op. 15, in the following composition, available now only as a recording:\n\nFor commentary on the foregoing composition, see:\n\n\"Ragging the Traumerei\" (Blog post) (Gershwin 100 Blog) (19 October 2006).

Berkeley, CA: California University Press, 2006 [publisher's website].\n\nb) Alec Templeton [toc] [top]\n\nAs noted in his Wikipedia entry, Alec Templeton (4 July 1909/10  28 March 1963) was a Welsh composer, pianist and satirist. Blind from birth and gifted with absolute pitch, Templeton wrote and performed a number of novelty songs.\n\nMuch of Templeton's output has been recorded on piano rolls even though not many of his piano compositions appear in print.\n\nFor examples of some of Templeton's entertaining recordings that touch upon \"jazzing the classics,\" see:\n\nMendelssohn Mows 'Em Down (1921) (Victor 26440)\n\nBach Goes to Town (1938) (Victor 26130)\n\nThe Shortest Wagnerian Opera Ever Written (1938)\n\nAlec Templeton's Musical Portraits:\n\nAs Brunnhilde's Battle Cry Might Be Sung y an American Crooner (1940) (Victor 26492)\n\nMozart Matriculates (1940) (Victor 26492)\n\nBach Tours Radio City (1940) (Victor 26493)\n\nSousa and Strauss in Reverse (1940) (Victor 26493)\n\nOpera Presentation of \"South of the Border\" (1940) (Victor 26493)\n\nA Sultry Day in New York (1940) (Victor 26493)\n\nThe Music That Goes 'Round and 'Round (Templeton playing in the styles of Mozart, Strauss and Handel) (no date)\n\nLinks to the sheet music to the following pieces are available here and here:\n\nBach Goes to Town: Prelude and Fugue in Swing (1938) [listen to recording]\n\nGrieg is in the Groove (1940) [listen to recording]\n\nHaydn Takes to Ridin (1940)\n\nMendelssohn Mows 'Em Down (1921, 1940) [listen to recording]\n\nMozart a la Mode (1950) [listen to recording]\n\nWilliam Do Tell (1950)\n\nFor an interesting analysis of the score for Bach Goes to Town, see Bjarne Pagh Byrnak, \"Suspected Manuscript Error in the 1938 Edition of the Fugue of Alec Templetons 'Bach Goes to Town'\" (2013).\n\nThe following commercial recordings of Alec Templeton are likely difficult to source:\n\nImprovisations On Operatic Themes by Offenbach and J. Strauss II. (Naxos 1953)\n\nAlec Templeton And His Music Boxes (Flicker 1955)\n\nSmart Alec (ABC-Paramount 1956)\n\nc) Fats Waller [toc] [top]\n\nFats Waller (21 May 1904  15 December 1943) was a legendary stride piano composer and performer. Some of his more popular keyboard compositions include African Ripples (1934) [listen to recording], Alligator Crawl (1934) [listen to recording], and Viper's Drag (1934) [listen to recording].\n\nIn 1978, a successful Broadway musical featured his music in Ain't Misbehavin'.\n\nHe is included here primarily for the following composition, being a \"swing piano\" take on the music of Bach:\n\nFats Waller. \"Bach\" Up To Me: Swingopation (1938)\n\nFor a great performance of this piece by Stephanie Trick, see here.\n\nSince much of Fats Waller's music may be covered by copyright, depending on your jurisdiction, the sheet music to the foregoing piece, along with many of his other compositions, is available for purchase here (a different folio without the foregoing piece is also here).\n\nd) Modern examples of ragging and jazzing the classics [toc] [top]\n\nIn this section, I briefly set out information on contemporary ragtime musicians and composers who have \"ragged\" or \"jazzed\" the classics or who otherwise fall within my broad definition as composers or performers of \"classical\" ragtime (set out below roughly by age of composer or performer):\n\nRobert \"Ragtime Bob\" Darch: Robert \"Ragtime Bob\" Darch (31 March 1920  20 October 2002) was a well-known ragtime performer and raconteur credited with keeping ragtime alive as part of the ragtime revival, including his many appearances in Toronto as described in here in my separate essay on Ragtime in Canada.\n\nHe is included here for the following ragtime song that I purchased years ago, I believe through the Scott Joplin International Ragtime Foundation (but it no longer appears to be for sale in their online store). Music and lyrics are by Darch and he dedicates the piece \"to my Esteemed Friend Professor Don Burns\". The lyrics contain the following passage regarding Professor Burns:\n\nHis fingers waggle to and fro, with syncopated tremolo\n\nBut he is so fantastic, when playin' all the classics\n\nHe plays Debussy in D with just one finger\n\nMozart in B with ne'er a clinker, Brahms and Ravel,\n\nOh how he makes them sound swell\n\nStrauss and Stravinsky he plays equally well.\n\nHe plays Beethoven and Bach on all the black keys\n\nChopin and Gluck and L. Godowsky\n\nMelody in F, he always plays it in C,\n\nProfessor Burn's Classic Repertoiree ....\n\nRobert \"Ragtime Bob\" Darch, Professor Burns' Classic Repertoiree (n.p.: Big River Music Publishing, 1994).\n\nSource: Personal copy [top]\n\nAlthough the following composition by Darch is not an example of \"ragging the classics\" (but instead his tribute to Piper's Opera House in Virginia City, Nevada), it may still be of interest to some readers (and was purportedly arranged by Joseph Lamb):\n\nRobert \"Ragtime Bob\" Darch (arranged by Joseph F. Lamb). Opera House Rag: A Sterling Collection (Virginia City, NV: The Ragtime Music Publishing Company, 1960) (held in print by York University from the John Arpin Collection) (listen to performance by Squeek Steele and Tom Brier).\n\nClaude Bolling: Claude Bolling (10 April 1930  29 December 2020) was a well-known French jazz pianist and composer. Arguably, he is well outside the scope of this essay but I include mention of him here for his 1967 recording Original Ragtime, being not a take on \"ragging the classics\" but instead a \"jazzing of ragtime\":\n\nOriginal Ragtime (Philips, 1967)\n\nJohn Arpin: John Arpin (3 December 1936  8 November 2007) and his influence on the popularity of ragtime in Canada is discussed here in my separate essay on ragtime in Canada. As noted above, none other than Eubie Blake called Arpin the \"Chopin of Ragtime\" for his complex and melodic arrangements of ragtime compositions. Set out below is information on Arpin's recordings of opera tunes, Beatles songs and Latin American tangos.\n\nWilliam Bolcom: As noted on his Wikipedia page, William Bolcom (26 May 1938) is an American pianist and composer, a recipient of the Pulitzer Prize, and married to mezzo-soprano Joan Morris. He has written a number of piano rag compositions (listed below) infused with classical musical mood and style. The NPR radio documentary on \"The Ragtime Music of William Bolcom\" (19 January 2006) includes performances of Bolcom's Graceful Ghost Rag and Incinerator Rag. For an interview with William Bolcom, see \"William Bolcom Discusses Graceful Ghost Rag with Mark Clague.\"\n\nSince Bolcom's compositions are still protected by copyright, you will not find them online. However, the following folio is highly recommended for purchase from your preferred bookseller:\n\nWilliam Bolcom: Complete Rags for Piano (Rev. ed). New York: Edward B. Marks Music Company, 2000)\n\nThe foregoing folio contains the following compositions, all of them reflecting Bolcom's interweaving of ragtime and classical music melodies and techniques:\n\nThree Classical Rags (1967): Glad Rag, Epitaph for Louis Chauvin, Incinerator Rag\n\nCalifornia Porcupine Rag (1968)\n\nThe Garden of Eden (1969): Old Adam, The Eternal Feminine, The Serpent's Kiss, Through Eden's Gate\n\nThree Popular Rags: Seabiscuts Rag (1967), Tabby Cat Walk (1968), Last Rag (1968)\n\nLost Lady Rag (1969)\n\nThe Gardenia (1970)\n\nThree Ghost Rags: Graceful Ghost Rag (1970), The Poltergeist (1971), Dream Shadows (1971)\n\nRag Tango (1971)\n\nKnight Hubert (1971)\n\nThe Brooklyn Dodge (1972)\n\nRaggin' Rudi (1974)\n\nFields of Flowers (1977)\n\nEpithalamium (1993)\n\nKnockout: A Rag (2008)\n\nEstela: Rag Latino (2010)\n\nContentment: A Rag\n\nFor an analysis of Bolcom's Ghost Rags, see Vera Zholondz, \"Ghost Rags by William Bolcom: A Descriptive Analysis and Performance Guide\" (2017). LSU Doctoral Dissertations 4387.\n\nRandy Newman: Randy Newman (28 November 1943) is a well known American composer and Academy Award winner for music for If I Didn't Have You (from Monsters, Inc.) and We Belong Together (from Toy Story 3) as well as being known for such hits as Short People (1977) and You've Got a Friend in Me (1995). He is arguably outside the scope of this essay but I include him here for his compositions in and arrangement of the music for the 1981 Milos-Forman-directed film, Ragtime, including the following two compositions:\n\nMain Title [listen to recording]\n\nCoalhouse and Sarah (a ragtime version of Chopin' A Major Prelude, Op. 28, no. 7) [listen to recording]\n\nHal Isbitz: Hal Isbitz is a classically trained musician who has composed a number of rags and tangos. He is included here primarily for his Blue Gardenia folio of Latin-American tangos, evocative in part of the music of Ernesto Nazareth, discussed below.\n\nThe folio for Blue Gardenia contains the following tangos by Hal Isbitz and is available for purchase from the composer [hal \"at\" silcom.com]: At Midnight, Blue Gardenia, Caterina, Copacabana, Dolores, The Flirt, Margarita, La Mariposa, Meditation, Miranda, Morelia, and Pierre.\n\nI can highly recommend John Arpin's recording of the foregoing pieces: John Arpin, Blue Gardenia (Classical 1998).\n\nWilliam Albright: William Albright (20 October 1944  17 September 1998) was a classically-trained American composer who, in addition to writing classical music, published the following \"classically-tinged\" rags:\n\nWilliam Albright, Grand Sonata in Rag (Scott Joplin's Victor, Ragtime Turtle Dove, Behemoth Two Step) (1968) [listen to performance by Ruben Reyes] [view sheet music] [view Albright's handwritten score].\n\nWilliam Albright, Nightmare Fantasy Rag  A Night On Rag Mountain (from The Dream Rags) [view sheet music] [listen to performance by Eunbi Kim].\n\nGlenn Jenks: Glenn Jenks (9 February 1947  21 January 2016) was a prolific ragtime composer, teacher and performer from Maine who fused traditional ragtime with classical music themes. His online obituary describes his love of gardening and birds. Composer Aaron Robinson has undertaken a project to catalog and digitize Jenks' compositions, as described here, which I assume culminated in the availability for purchase of Glenn Jenks, The Complete Ragtime Works for Piano as a digital download (my favorite pieces from this collection are The Elegiac Rag and Sosua).\n\nThe foregoing folio also includes Jenks' \"desecration\" of a number of classical music compositions, as follows:\n\nGlenn Jenks, Stolen Moments: A New Desecration (2003) [listen to a performance by Glenn Jenks]\n\nGlenn Jenks, The Exemplar (1976) [listen to a performance by Glen Jenks]\n\nGlenn Jenks also composed a String Quartet in Ragtime (the sheet music for which I do not yet see as being easily available for purchase). For a performance of this piece by the Vanadium String Quartet, see:\n\nFirst movement (\"Ante Primam Lecum\") (Before First Light) (Molto lento e expressivo)\n\nSecond movement (\"Papilio\") (Butterfly) (Allegretto)\n\nThird movement (\"In Extremis\") (In Death) (Adagio sentito)\n\nFourth movement (\"Felix in Horto\") (The Cat in the Garden) (Allegro giocoso)\n\nA number of performances by Glenn Jenks of his various rags are otherwise also available on the Glenn Jenks YouTube channel.\n\nWilliam \"Perfessor Bill\" Edwards: William \"Perfessor Bill\" Edwards is a ragtime composer and performer with an extensive website with information on all aspects of ragtime. The following ragtime compositions by Edwards are his take on ragging the classics:\n\nBill Edwards, Hanon Rag (1985) [purchase sheet music] [listen to performance by the composer]\n\nBill Edwards, A Nocturne in Ragtime (1989) [purchase sheet music] [listen to performance by the composer]\n\nEthan Uslan: As noted on his website, Ethan is a ragtime performer and composer from Charlotte, North Carolina, whose entertaining podcast  The Carolina Shout  covers \"themed\" episodes on various aspects of ragtime and swing music (see below for a list of his podcast episodes on the theme of \"ragging the classics\"). Ethan also has published a number of his \"ragging the classics\" sheet music compositions, including the following titles available for purchase on his website (that I can highly recommend, although they are for advanced players):\n\nFur Elise in Ragtime [listen to Ethan Uslan performing this piece]\n\nFur Elise in Ragtime (for 4 Hands)\n\nChopin's Prelude in A in Ragtime\n\nChopin's Waltz in C# Minor (in the style of Fats Waller) [listen to Ethan Uslan performing this piece]\n\nMozart's \"Rondo all Turca\"[listen to Ethan Uslan performing this piece]\n\nBeethoven's Moonlight Sonata in Boogie Woogie[listen to Ethan Uslan performing this piece]\n\nBach's Minuet in G[listen to Ethan Uslan performing this piece]\n\nRamona Rhapsody Español [listen to Ethan Uslan performing this piece]\n\nSilent Night in Ragtime and Stride[listen to Ethan Uslan performing this piece]\n\nVincent Johnson: Ragtime pianist Vincent Johnson composed Charleston Claude, a ragtime version of Clair de Lune, performed here by Richard Dowling.\n\nMore generally, unrelated to the foregoing list of \"modern\" ragtime composers or performers, there are the following two folios from 1998 of beginner-to-intermediate-level ragtime arrangements of classical music, see:\n\nRepertoire and Ragtime, Book 1 (arranged by Kenon Renfrow)\n\nRepertoire and Ragtime, Book 1I (arranged by Kenon Renfrow)\n\n5) Ragtime and jazz motifs in classical music[toc] [top]\n\nIt was not only ragtime or jazz composers or performers were influenced by classical music. There were in fact a number of classical music composers who were influenced by ragtime and jazz rhythms and themes. Set out below is a list of some of these classical music composers  such as Debussy, Ravel and Satie  along with other ragtime era composers of classical music who have some ties to ragtime music. Arguably, it may be that John Philip Sousa  associated more with traditional march music for orchestras  falls on the periphery of this group but is included due to his incorporation of ragtime in his orchestra's performances and the fact that many ragtime piano performers would in fact \"rag\" his traditional march compositions. Likewise, it could be argued that Louis Moreau Gottschalk and Ernesto Nazareth are also on the periphery of this group but are included due to their works having some thematic ties to ragtime music. Since I lack the expertise and resources to draw proper lines between the works of the composers below to each other and to analyze their scores in depth for specific examples of the ragtime influence in their music, my treatment of the composers and their works below is relatively superficial for now but is something I may try to expand upon in future updates to this essay when I have more time and can access resources at the University music library when the pandemic lockdown restrictions have ended.\n\na)\n\nWilliam Levi Dawson\n\nb)\n\nClaude Debussy c)\n\nNathaniel Dett d)\n\nLouis Moreau Gottschalk e)\n\nPercy Grainger\n\nf)\n\nArthur Honegger g)\n\nCharles Ives\n\nh)\n\nDarius Milhaud i)\n\nErnesto Nazareth j)\n\nEthelbert Nevin\n\nk)\n\nMaurice Ravel\n\nl)\n\nErik Satie\n\nm)\n\nJohn Philip Sousa\n\nn)\n\nWilliam Grant Still\n\no)\n\nIgor Stravinsky\n\na) William Levi Dawson [toc] [top]\n\nWilliam Levi Dawson (September 26, 1899  May 2, 1990) was an African-American composer, born at the start of the ragtime era, whose career and music focused on orchestral compositions and arrangements for choirs, including those based on African spirituals. In 1934, the Philadelphia Orchestra, led by conductor Leopold Stokowski, debuted Dawson's Negro Folk Symphony (audio recording available here), which, according to the Wikipedia entry for Dawson, he later revised in 1952 with added African rhythms inspired by the composer's trip to West Africa.\n\nAdditional resources:\n\nTom Huizenga, \"Someone Finally Remembered William Dawson's 'Negro Folk Symphony\" (NPR Radio) (26 June 2020)\n\nAlabama Music Hall of Fame, \"William Levi Dawso\n\nJoshua Weilerstein, Sticky Notes: The Classical Music Podcast, \"William Levi Dawson, Negro Folk Symphony\"\n\nb) Claude Debussy [toc] [top]\n\nClaude Debussy (22 August 1862  25 March 1918) was a French composer known for such pieces as Clair de Lune (1890) ([view sheet music] [listen to Debussy playing his own composition] [listen to Jonny May's ragtime version]) and 2 Arabesques (1890) ([view sheet music] [listen to Debussy's version]).\n\nLike his contemporaries Erik Satie (below), Maurice Ravel (below), and Igor Stravinsky (below), Claude Debussy explored ragtime and jazz music in his own compositions, the most famous example of which is Golliwog's Cakewalk from his six-movement suite, Children's Corner:\n\nClaude Debussy, Golliwog's Cakewalk (1908).\n\n[view sheet music] [listen to Debussy playing his own composition]\n\nSource: Personal copy [top]\n\nThe Wikipedia entry for the following cakewalk notes Debussy's allusions to banjo chords and drums heard from ministrel shows:\n\nClaude Debussy, Le petite nègre: cakewalk (1909).\n\n[view sheet music] [listen to performance by Ichiro Kaneko] [top]\n\nDebussy continued to explore ragtime themes in the following composition:\n\nClaude Debussy, Minstrels (in Préludes, Livre 1) (1909-10).\n\n[view sheet music] [listen to Debussy playing his own composition] [top]\n\nAccording to the Wikipedia entry for the following waltz, Debussy debuted it at the New Carlton Hotel in Paris, where it was transcribed for strings and performed by the popular 'gypsy' violinist, Léoni, for whom Debussy wrote it (and who was given the manuscript by the composer):\n\nThe following piece was apparently written about the American clown, Edward Lavine, whose costume was part soldier, part clown:\n\nc) Nathaniel Dett [toc] [top]\n\nR Nathaniel Dett, born in Canada, was a composer who wrote in the ragtime idiom early in his career, despite being known primarily for his compositions of classical music and spirituals.\n\nHis three earliest known compositions were in the ragtime mode, being After the Cake Walk, Cave of the Winds, and Inspiration Waltzes:\n\nIn After the Cake Walk (1900), Dett has written what he described as a \"March Cake Walk\" in the key of G major with the Trio and final sections in the key of C major. It is an energetic, lightly syncopated and rhythmic piece in the ragtime march tradition:\n\nNathaniel Dett, After the Cake Walk (Toronto, ON: Whaley, Royce & Co, 1900).\n\n[view sheet music]\n\nSource: Copy obtained from the Toronto Reference Library [top]\n\nIn Cave of the Winds (1902), also in the keys of G and C major, Dett has written what is described by McBrier (Lerma and McBrier 1973:ix) as a vigourous march using simple traditional harmony. The title refers to the \"Cave of the Winds\" found at Niagara Falls, the city where Dett was living at the time he composed this piece:\n\nNathaniel Dett, Cave of the Winds (Niagara Falls, NY: SC Fagard, 1902).\n\n[view sheet music]\n\nSource: Library and Archives Canada [top]\n\nIn the typical fashion of a romantic, Dett describes the \"inspiration\" for Inspiration Waltzes (1903) in the introduction to this piece as follows: \"I awoke one night at midnight and heard, as in a dream, the melodies of this Waltz played over and over, until I again fell asleep. Next morning I found it was still fresh in my memory. I created the Introduction and some other parts to give the whole completeness, but the main themes were truly 'Inspirations' or, to put it more poetically were truly 'dictated' by the Muse.\"\n\nNathaniel Dett, Inspiration Waltzes, S. 3, for piano (London: Richard A.

During the time he composed the three ragtime-related pieces above, Dett was an organist at a church in Niagara Falls. He later studied at the Oliver Willis Halstead Conservatory in Lockport, New York from 1901 to 1903 and then at Oberlin College (Ohio) from 1903 to 1908, where he was the first African-American to earn a Bachelor of Music degree with a major in composition and the piano. He later obtained a Master of Music degree in 1938 from the Eastman School of Music in Rochester, New York.\n\nAfter the publication of his early more ragtime-influenced pieces listed above, and after attending music school, Dett's compositions took on a much more classical tone, incorporating Negro spirituals and other ethnic elements. Dett's music falls with the sphere of romanticism, with highly lyrical and thematic moods. In addition to composing, Dett spent most of his working life teaching at various music faculties in the United States and touring and performing his music (including tours to Canada and to Europe).\n\nHis other major works include Enchantment: A Romantic Suite on an Original Program (1922), Cinnamon Grove: A Suite for the Piano (1928), Tropic Winter: Suite for the Piano (1938) and Eight Bible Vignettes (1941 ~ 1943).\n\nDuring the latter part of his life, Dett struck up a friendship with musician Percy Grainger (discussed below), composer of, among other pieces, In Dahomey: Cakewalk Smasher).\n\nThe Sibley Music Library at the Eastman School of Music at the University of Rochester has an extensive R. Nathaniel Dett collection.\n\nIt remains unclear whether the ragtime music of Scott Joplin influenced Dett or whether Joplin himself knew of Dett, especially given Joplin's proclivity to be taken seriously as a composer. Much of the literature is silent on this point, with there being no mention of Dett in either They All Played Ragtime (Blesh and Janish 1966) and That American Rag (Jasen and Jones 2000). Edward Berlin does mention Dett in Ragtime: A Musical and Cultural History (Berlin 1980:107) in the context of musical rhythms found in musical sources of early ragtime.\n\nGiven that Dett was driven in the early 1900's to write ragtime-related pieces, it is reasonable to assume that he knew of Scott Joplin during his career, given the general popularity of ragtime music that spread throughout the North East at that time. Dett himself, in moving towards more classical compositions, was perhaps trying to avoid stereotyped ragtime sounds. In a note to In the Bottoms, Dett refers to the common rhythmic figure found in ragtime music as being a \"frequent occurrence in the music of the ante-bellum folk-dances\" with \"its marked individuality\" causing \"it to be much misused for purposes of caricature.\"\n\nSimpson (1993:11) describes Dett's \"shame\" when being exposed to Antonín Dvořák's incorporation of Negro and Indian musical heritages into his music when \"the naive young Dett revealed embarrassment that musically his race was identified only with the current and frivolous ragtime style.\" Simpson later notes, however, that later on, \"while a student at Oberlin College, Dett fortunately developed a broader, more cheerful perspective of the larger Negro idiom\" but even as late as 1918 Simpson notes (1993:12) that Dett commented on the attitude of a majority of the black race in an interview carried by Musical America:\n\nThe Negro people as a whole cannot be looked to as a very great aid in the work of conserving their folk music. At the present time they are inclined to regard it as a vestige of the slavery they are trying to put behind them and to be ashamed of it. Moreover, the prevailing manner of presenting Negro music to the public  the \"coon\" song of vaudeville or the minstrel show  has not tended to increase appreciation of it, either among the Negro or white races.\n\nHowever, it is less certain whether Joplin knew of Dett and his music. The possibility exists that perhaps he did not, given the regional differences that \"served as barriers to a shared culture\" and that affirmed \"the existence of diverse experiences within the African American community in the United States\" at that time (Curtis 1994:188). Since Dett's classical compositions came towards the end of Joplin's life, and given the state of communications in those days, it is entirely possible that Joplin died, dreaming of his own classical ambitions with the publication of his opera Treemonisha without knowing of the classical publications of R. Nathaniel Dett.\n\nA more detailed analysis of Dett's life and his (classical) music is provided by Simpson (1993).\n\nDett died of a heart attack on October 2, 1943, but his legacy lives on in Canada through The Nathaniel Dett Chorale, described on their website as \"Canada's first professional choral group dedicated to Afrocentric music of all styles including classical, spiritual, gospel, jazz, folk and blues.\"\n\nFor a good recording of Dett's music, see the following CD: Denver Oldham: R. Nathaniel Dett: Piano Works (1988).\n\nd) Louis Moreau Gottschalk [toc] [top]\n\nLouis Moreau Gottschalk (8 May 1829  18 December 1869) was a New Orleans composer and performer who spent most of his professional career outside of the United States but whose music was infused with African and Caribbean motifs and rhythms.\n\nIn They All Played Ragtime, authors Blesh and Janis describe Gottschalk's work as an early precursor to ragtime with Gottschalk's incorporation of African and Caribbean drumbeats in La Bamboula  Danse des Nègres (below):\n\nIt was in 1847, a half century before the first ragtime composition was published, that eighteen-year old Louis Moreau Gottschalk, son of an English cotton broker and a highborn French Creole lady, wrote the long, vastly difficult piano fantaisie La Bamboula  Danse des Nègres. A prodigy at fifteen, Gottschalk had already established himself in concert at the Salle Pleyel in Paris with huge public success and the praise of the great Chopin. La Bamboula is the composer's Opus 2; La Moree (Gottschalk was playing this \"Ode to Death\" at Rio de Janeiro when fatally stricken in 1869) is his Opus 60, but the earlier work with its strong Negroid inspiration is considered his masterpiece [Blesh and Janis: 82].\n\nThe compositions by Gottschalk that reflect his melding of African and Caribbean melodies and rhythms and of the most likely interest to ragtime piano performers include but are not limited to the following pieces:\n\nLouis Moreau Gottschalk, Polka de Salon, Op. 1 [listen to recording]\n\nLouis Moreau Gottschalk, La Bamboula  Danse des Nègres, Op. 2 (1844) [listen to recording]\n\nLouis Moreau Gottschalk, La Savane: Ballade Créole, Op. 3 (1845) [listen to recording]\n\nLouis Moreau Gottschalk, Le Bananier, Op. 5 (\"The Banana Tree\") (1845) [listen to recording]\n\nLouis Moreau Gottschalk, Tournament: Galop (1859) [listen to recording]\n\nLouis Moreau Gottschalk, La Gallina (Danse Cubane), Op. 53 (\"The Hen\") (1859) [listen to recording]\n\nLouis Moreau Gottschalk, Ballade No. 6"
