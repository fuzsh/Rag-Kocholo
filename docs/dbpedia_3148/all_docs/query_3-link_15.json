        "text": "I thought I knew the answer to this - but a bit of research showed me I was only half right.\n\nI'd have said that the clock tower of the Palace of Westminster, the UK's Parliamentary building, was the origin. However, it appears I'm wrong - it was the trigger for its popularity but not its origin.\n\nThe set of tunes is, though, known as the Westminster Quarters.\n\nWikipedia helped me out -\n\nThis chime is traditionally, though without substantiation, believed to be a set of variations on the four notes that make up the fifth and sixth measures of \"I know that my Redeemer liveth\" from Handel's Messiah.[2] This is why the chime is also played by the bells of the so-called 'Red Tower' in Halle, the native town of Handel. It was written in 1793 for a new clock in St Mary the Great, the University Church in Cambridge. There is some doubt over exactly who composed it: Revd Dr Joseph Jowett, Regius Professor of Civil Law, was given the job, but he was probably assisted by either Dr John Randall (1715â€“99), who was the Professor of Music from 1755, or his brilliant undergraduate pupil, William Crotch (1775-1847).\n\nIn the mid-19th century the chime was adopted by the clock tower at the Palace of Westminster (where Big Ben hangs), whence its fame spread. It is now possibly the most commonly used chime for striking clocks.\n\nIncidental information - the clock is not called Big Ben, the bell that chimes the hours is Big Ben, the clock is just the clock of the Palace of Westminster & actually doesn't really have a name."
