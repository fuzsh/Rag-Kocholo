        "text": "1 Introduction\n\n‘Do you get more done when music is playing?’\n\nIn 1970, the City of Helsinki decided to conduct an experiment at three of its premises aimed at studying the effects of using Muzak products. The experiment focused on employee satisfaction, self-perceived work performance, measured productivity, and customer impressions. The endeavour was inspired by a proposition from Finnestrad, the local Muzak franchisee. A project report (City of Helsinki 1970) was archived in the personal files of Mr Eero Vallila, the owner and chief executive of the company, and found decades later by background music researchers.\n\nThe music system was installed on the shop floor where employees worked in the city’s central laundry department and the car repair shop of their building office. For assessment in customer service premises, the city chose its child welfare office. A survey was conducted charting the views of the employees and measuring the efficiency of their work. Interestingly, the question the survey asked regarding choosing an option other than Muzak offered only one alternative, the Finnish public radio music programme Sävelradio (see subsection 4.2).\n\nFrom the point of view of Finnestrad, the results were disappointing. Contentedness was deemed ‘fairly good’ in the employee sample and ‘good’ in the child welfare customer sample. No increase in either efficiency or productivity was detected. The outcome was precisely opposite to the marketing message Muzak was attempting to convince potential clients of at the time: that any music could entertain people, but it took scientifically tested Muzak to make organisations and businesses churn out more profit and productivity. In the end, the report did not recommend making Muzak a part of the city employees’ workdays; it did, however, recommend that a subscription to the Muzak system be procured for the customer service space of the child welfare offices.\n\nThis episode touches on at least three points relevant to this Element. Firstly, the power of music – however ingeniously tailored – to bring about intended results is and always has been limited and subject to a multitude of variables. Secondly, the historical changes in music cultures have significantly affected the market trends for functional music products: the idea of entertaining child welfare customers with background music products using taxpayer money would probably sound alien in any decade other than the 1960s and 1970s. Thirdly, the prevailing music culture of the time invariably affects the discussion and circumstances surrounding background music: employees given one alternative to Muzak – Sävelradio – might reveal a preference for it in their responses, which they did. The result, however, says more about the music listening culture in Finland in 1970 than any universal boost in work capacity, atmosphere, or general productivity as a result of either alternative.\n\nBackground Music Cultures in Finnish Urban Life is inspired by these kinds of observations of the past and present cultural conditions of using functional music in everyday life. It is the first concise ethnomusicological, sensory ethnography-oriented, and fieldwork-based analysis of music in urban environments, drawing from our research project ACMESOCS: Auditory Cultures, Mediated Sounds and Constructed Spaces (2019–22). This Academy of Finland funded research takes auditory culture and the materiality of background music practices seriously and analyses them as part of sonic environments and their socio-spatial contingencies. The project’s three research strands scrutinised (1) the development of the commercial sonic environment and its implied human object, the listener-consumer, referring to the target group of the background music industry – at whom its message has been and is currently aimed; (2) economic, technological, legislative, organisational, and cultural factors transforming urban acoustic environments in the context of ubiquitous music, including novel products like the generative software used in creating branded musical ambience; and (3) experienced and reclaimed acoustic environments to understand people’s experiences, perceptions, and actions in urban and commercial environments, especially regarding ubiquitous musics.\n\nResearching urban auditory cultures, ACMESOCS focused on how these are experienced, articulated, and reclaimed. We are interested in shedding light on social, legal, economic, and technological factors that have an effect on the historical development of the background and foreground of the music industry, on the construction of contemporary sonic environments, and on the use of individual meaning-making in various public and commercial environments. The aim is to include a diversity of listening and experiencing and to give room to a range of approaches by introducing the added precision of crowdsourced and field materials.\n\nAlthough the relationship between music, place, and listening has been extensively studied (see e.g. Reference Stockfelt and JärviluomaStockfelt 1994; Reference BornBorn 2013; Section 2 in this Element), interest in background music specifically has been somewhat limited. This Element analyses a combination of the agency of the groups that are designing and experiencing background music: producers, people working in environments filled with background music, and city dwellers, who are often cast in the role of consumers. This approach sheds light on the functionality of background music beyond more general notions of sales promotion and customer persuasion. Background music has also frequently been portrayed in research as a uniform phenomenon, or even as an identifiable musical genre. In our view, the state of play is rather a plurality of background music cultures: certain shared global marketing logics and functions with considerable differences in local emphasis.\n\nCompared to the often sleek and smooth design of playlists, the experience of music among the urban din is often more rudimentary. Urban dwellers participate in and pass through living acoustic environments where they encounter lo-fi technology in playback systems: muffled and compressed music, barely audible between layers of hums, voices, and sounds. The most common situation in which one encounters background music is moving past loudspeakers in hallways and stores. This causes the music to be heard in dynamic glides, waves of intensifying and weakening sounds, momentary and random, presenting us with methodological questions: which parts of the ‘music not being listened to’ are actually audible to start with, and to whom – how is it relevant, and how can this relevance be studied? How can the diversity of the listeners and their listening abilities be considered as a relevant aspect with regard to the urban experience of music?\n\nWe explore background music as a central dimension of modern and postmodern urbanity. Music has a long history as a part of commerce, marketing, and consumption, as well as a fundamental part of urban culture. We propose that background music as a phenomenon is, by definition, tied to the figure of the listener-consumer, the modern urbanite who is, on one hand, a creation of the advertising industry and, on the other, an individual within a mediatised music culture who is able to dishearken (borthöra, Reference Stockfelt and JärviluomaStockfelt 1994: 20), or pay no attention to music. Referencing the formulations of mediated urbanity and urban media studies (Reference Tosoni and RidellTosoni & Ridell 2016), where urban space is seen as a networked and bodily context of media consumption, this Element brings forth the densely mediated and overlapping acoustic realities that are embedded in the urban fabric, woven into the very infrastructure and material conditions of urban space. Background music makes urban spaces recognisable, negotiable, and distinctive. Playing background music is a mediatised place-making process through which urbanity can be listened to.\n\nOur point of departure is to study background music as culture. Studying music as culture may identify how societal values such as hierarchy or individualism are reflected in musical conceptualisation, behaviour, and sound (Reference NettlNettl 1983/2005: 217–18). Researching music as humanly organised sound in given circumstances refers to not only the end product but also process and activity. This includes the interactions between human beings, motivations behind their behaviours, and the significance they attach to them. These intellectual, physical, cultural, and social dynamics and processes generate musical products. Music is made perceptually, conceptually, and emotionally. This process, termed as musicking, refers to how music is not just made but also responded and assigned meaning to. (See Reference BlackingBlacking 1973; Reference SmallSmall 1998; Reference RiceRice 2014: 5–6, 9.)\n\nTia DeNora’s seminal Music in Everyday Life (Reference DeNora2000), based on fieldwork carried out in the 1990s, provided a wide-ranging account of people and music in everyday life in Britain. In our Finnish research setting, we focus on one phenomenon within everyday musical experience: the use of background music. We go further in contextualising it in its ‘unsolicited’ form, holding on to the experiential approach while also including the structures of the contemporary digital background of the music industry and its spatial and cultural manifestations. As an enhancement of a culture-specific analysis of the Finnish case, this Element provides a methodological tool applicable to understanding ‘background music in culture X’. This model will enable taking into account specific features of each local culture – for example, those related to music, sound, the service sector, urban architecture, public and commercial broadcasting, and the mediascape as a whole.\n\nContrary to popular media discourse that treats background music as one-dimensional or manipulative, this Element offers a broader understanding of music culture as an historical and spatiotemporally bound phenomenon for the non-expert in the field. Based on extensive ethnographic data gathered through interviews, surveys, and fieldwork (such as listening walks and participatory observation), and supported by archival research, it will also present a novel data-gathering method, suitable for collecting information on everyday experiential phenomena as ephemeral as background music. This approach, combining walking methods, mapping, sound diaries, crowdsourcing, and use of music recognition apps and instant messaging, can be applied to educational projects, for example. We tap into examples like the use of music during the Christmas season, in shopping malls or sex shops, and historical cases like background music in primary schools, and so on. The sections delve into the profession of the background music designer/producer as well as the working environment of the cashier and the restaurant patron, among others. Finland, with its particularities in urban and environmental structures, along with its economic and music industry history, is our research context. Despite its cultural focus, the methodology and theoretical considerations in this Element are applicable to other countries and contexts.\n\nAn essential part of the cultural study of background music is the examination of the materiality of sound – aspects such as the spaces and systems that reproduce sound and how they function. Technology plays an essential role in the quality of the sound of music and how that sound carries to different parts of a given space. Among the factors influencing the outcome are the type of loudspeaker system and its age, how the system is built, the number of speakers, and the extent of the infrastructure on which the system depends for its functionality (Wi-Fi, power grid, system design, installation, maintenance, and repair). Integrated sound systems with dozens of loudspeakers can be almost invisible and thus accentuate the idea of the control of the system as being remote and disconnected.\n\nThis Element helps in building the reader’s awareness and skills that create ‘functional music literacy’ (cf. ‘media literacy’). This means an understanding of, for example, the agencies, spatial factors, and cultural conventions at play in urban commercial spaces with music. Background music processes are viewed as music cultures, taking form from ideologies, institutions, infrastructures, and material objects. The background music industry caters to culturally diverse ears, and the circumstances in which it is consumed vary likewise. Due to the Finnish context and the ethnomusicological approach, the study is culture-sensitive and specific, providing a fresh perspective on a phenomenon generally understood as industry-led, behavioural, and global.\n\nThe structure of this Element follows the lines of background music production – ‘from the factory to the consumer’, so to speak. In this section, we map out the concept of background music along its contingencies and present some relevant scholarly discussion from recent years. A contextualising section follows, explaining how we understand the Finnish context of the study and how different cultural, societal, and infrastructural characteristics shape the culture of background music locally. This section demonstrates the historical formation (from the 1960s until today) of the listener-consumer, that is, the model audience member for sonic advertising, and also deals with the early years of the background music industry in Finland. In the third section, based on extensive interviews, we elaborate how companies providing background music services operate and how they see themselves as actors in the fields of music and advertising. Publicly funded and commercial radio stations will also be presented as providers of background music. The following section moves from the production of background music services to the commercial space and to the service sector, consisting of people listening to background music several hours a day. This section, based on a large survey, interviews, and fieldwork observations, examines how people work with ‘music not chosen’ and how they understand it as affecting their well-being. The fifth section focuses on the so-called end users of background music, the urban dwellers, and their everyday encounters with it. A case analysis demonstrating a seasonal disruption (Christmas) in the everyday implementation of background music aims to develop a toolkit of ethnographic methods suitable for a dense urban environment. In the last section, we discuss some current changes in the field and present a methodological checklist for studying background music that we hope will inspire students and researchers interested in the urban, music, and auditory culture.\n\n2 Mapping Background Music as a Phenomenon\n\nBackground music as a phenomenon is multifaceted, and there are various perspectives from which to view it. Working towards a definition for this research, we start from the following: by background music, we mean mediated music played non-stop in commercial and public spaces, supporting/assisting/accompanying other activities of a target group/city dwellers, with a function related to commercial profitability or work productivity. It is also usually created for temporary enjoyment and selected by someone (at the ‘factory’) not expecting the listener (the ‘consumer’) to stay and focus on the music.\n\nTo elaborate further on this historically and locally changing use of music, some analytical questions focusing on its infrastructural, social, economic, and ideological aspects can be helpful. The entanglement of these diverse topics is outlined in what follows (see Figure 1).\n\nThough not to be read as too hierarchical or definitive but rather as dismantling the phenomenon of background music to gain analytical insight, Figure 1 specifies seven approaches in the form of questions: Where is it played? What is the playback medium? Who is the music collated by? Who regulates it? For whom is it played and how is it perceived? And, finally, for what ends is it played? The questions mentioned here are related to the concept of agency in background music, which is crucial in any study of music or sound in an ethnomusicological or anthropological context. In this study, the concept of agency refers to individual and collective capacities for action in music-related settings (Reference Karlsen and Sturman.Karlsen 2019; Section 5). The diverse agencies are manifested sonically in specific contexts of time, place, and listener.\n\nThe city, a dense geographic concentration of people and things, can be understood as a form of music as well. The density of the soundscape (perceived as the increasing number of loudspeakers) has stirred up a critique of ‘piped music’, a discussion similar to the environmental concern of urban habitats in the 1960s: mechanised music and PA systems were discussed as a form of pollution and excess detrimental to a healthy environment. This discourse on noise pollution is still very much present in discussions about the use of city space and urban community life. The uninterrupted sonic presence of background music is characteristic of media technologies that help in urban spatial organisation and navigation. Our ‘factory-to-consumer’ point of departure resonates with urban studies in its interest in the planning and designing of space and how it is re-made through practical use, incorporating communication technologies as necessary equipment (see Reference Krajina, Stevenson, Krajina and StevensonKrajina & Stevenson 2020: 2).\n\nBackground music – like work uniforms – is a material practice that has emerged with modernity in the service industries. Whereas uniforms are more generally the result of an ‘extreme rationalisation of appearance’ (Reference Tynan and GodsonTynan & Godson 2019: 2, 4), background music can be characterised as a sonic and spatial manifestation of a similar rational approach. Both are related to a fundamental transformation of the experience of time and space in the everyday life of Western capitalist societies in the first half of the twentieth century. The work uniform enables clients to identify members of staff and also marks service employees as working in and belonging to the business premises. In the case of background music, the identifying and orienting effect is less clear, and the relationship of both the workers and the customers to the sound material can be ambiguous, sometimes subject to negotiation and reflection.\n\nThe different notions of background music itself are somewhat contradictory. Anahid Kassabian states that there is no commonly agreed name for music not chosen by the listener. ‘Background music’ is sometimes in the foreground; ‘business music’ refers to the economic role of the music; ‘environmental music’ refers to its role in forming contexts; and ‘programmed music’ refers to its production and distribution, leaving out its consumption. Kassabian prefers the concept of ‘ubiquitous musics’ being always present but beyond our control, ‘slipping under our thresholds of consciousness’ (Reference Kassabian, Horner and SwissKassabian 1999/2006: 117). Affects such as bodily responses to background music or any other stimuli take place before conscious understanding. These responses pass into thoughts and feelings, leaving behind a residue that becomes ‘the stuff of future affective responses’ (Reference KassabianKassabian 2013: xiii–xv).\n\nThe term ‘ubiquitous music’ covers multiple listening experiences, starting from radio, which has historically provided a wide range of musics for ubiquitous listening. With the advent of digital listening technologies, people have unprecedented control over what they listen to in their everyday life. There is no link between specific listening approaches and specific music styles, nor can ubiquitous or background music be identified as a particular genre. ‘Shopping, sleeping, and secretarial work take place in such radically different contexts and across such radically diverse demographic or identity groups that there is no reasonable way of labeling ubiquitous musics and genre in any ways in which the term is generally used’ (Reference Boschi, Kassabian, Quiñones, Quiñones, Kassabian and BoschiBoschi et al. 2013: 6–7). Instead of a specific style of music, we need to concentrate on the alleged function of music, since almost any music genre can be selected for use as ubiquitous or background music. Apart from listening, we also study other ways of interacting with music, such as dancing and singing.\n\nUbiquitous musics can be defined by their relationships to listening and attention and by their description as ‘musical events that take place alongside other activities’ (Reference Boschi, Kassabian, Quiñones, Quiñones, Kassabian and BoschiBoschi et al. 2013: 6–7). The significance of the act of listening stands out, for example in the background music companies’ attempts at catering to diverse ears. In 1981, a former Muzak representative in Finland wrote in an opinion piece that, unlike the content he described as ‘distracting’ background music, their content was ‘not meant to be listened to but heard’ (Helsingin Sanomat 1981). As an illustrative example of the shift in background music culture, many current businesses in the trade have a reverse marketing strategy: instead of inquiring about their clients’ own preferences for and conceptions of music, companies provide them with diverse music compilations, encouraging them to base their procurement decisions on listening.\n\nIn spite of undeniable similarities with ubiquitous music, we decided to use the concept of background music in this Element. Ubiquitous music and ubiquitous listening were coined for scholarly use – as tools for academic work. Background music is a concept used in the communication between representatives of the background music industry and their customers, as well as in the media, when music used in public spaces is commented on and discussed. This is also the concept we used while interacting with the participants of our research.\n\nConceptually, this Element draws from soundscapes and sonic environments, often used synonymously (Reference SchaferSchafer 1977: 274), although soundscapes emphasise how individuals and society understand an acoustic environment through listening (Reference TruaxTruax 2001: xviii). In given contexts, background music can be characterised as a form of a sonic environment, referring to sound’s immersive qualities since the word ‘environ’ connotes ‘surrounding’ and ‘enclosing’. Our auditory field encompasses 360 degrees, whereas the concept of soundscape has visual connotations, thus referring to panoramic perception (Reference UimonenUimonen 2020b: 58). Drawing from Reference Pinch and BijsterveldPinch and Bijsterveld (2004) and Reference KassabianKassabian (2013), the concept of a ‘sound environment’ was coined to describe a relationship between music, audiences, and everyday life. It includes variables such as space, time, body, and choice of the technology needed for the diffusion and consumption of music. This approach not only should include issues such as gender, race, and ethnicity (Reference Nowak and BennettNowak & Bennett 2014: 442) but also should be refined to take culture-specific, historical, or language-related aspects of music consumption into consideration – especially in the context of background music.\n\nIn this Element, we do not aim to propose an overarching concept in understanding background music and its diverse contexts. Its strength lies in understanding how the whole from-the-factory-to-the-consumer chain operates in everyday life – a concept often used in vague articulations of musical significance in different contexts and spaces (Reference Nowak and BennettNowak & Bennett 2014). Music and the everyday are connected to time, and therefore to routines and repetitions: ‘events that happen every night or every week, even every month and every year are part of mundane, ordinary living’ (Reference Hesmondhalgh, Hesmondhalgh and NegusHesmondhalgh 2002: 125–6). In this respect, background music can be viewed as one subcategory of staple music (Reference Uimonen, Heikkinen, Kilpiö and MantereUimonen 2014). In the latter half of the twentieth century, sound-reproducing technologies became widely available and commonplace and, more importantly, part of everyday practices. Unlike gramophone records, which could only be purchased from specialised shops, compact cassettes were available from Finnish grocery stores, supermarkets, and service stations, like other staple products, from the 1970s. Music consumption changed because of music’s availability and new dissemination channels. (Reference Kilpiö, Kurkela and UimonenKilpiö et al. 2015: 31.)\n\nCommenting on the history of recorded music and its social effects in Performing Rites (Reference Frith1998: 236), Simon Frith concluded music was everywhere and no longer in need of framing via a special place or time: ‘there is less and less sense of music being “appropriate” to certain times and places’. Recording and transmission enabled new uses of music, especially when used to accompany everyday life at work and during leisure time in diverse environments – a phenomenon characterised as ‘transphonia’ (Reference UimonenUimonen 2005). Technologically mediated listening situations demanded new or ‘adequate’ modes of listening: the ‘situation in which one encounters music conditions music itself’, and a listener needs competence not only to listen but also to dishearken music (Reference Stockfelt and JärviluomaStockfelt 1994: 20; Reference Stockfelt, Schwarz and Siegel1997) – or not to interact with music in any other sensorial way. Music has also become mobile and follows its users practically everywhere (Reference FrithFrith 1998: 236; see also Reference TaggTagg 1984). Frith’s comment on music and place holds true thirty years later, with augmented dimensions. With ubiquitous mobile phone networks and Wi-Fi connections, users of digital services are online continuously, even when asleep. This lays the foundation for contemporary 24/7 uses of music.\n\nContemporary staple music is a phenomenon with lots of potential scholarly interest. It is undoubtedly connected to urbanism but not inherently urban in itself: rather, with staple music, urbanity can be brought into almost any environment. Its uses are diverse, and they have manifested in birdsong in public lavatories (like in the Helsinki-Vantaa airport), music used in museums and installations – or, recently, a Spotify playlist compiled by the Finnish state-owned railway company, advertised on cardboard coffee cups used in the trains’ restaurant cars and accessible through a QR-code and the passengers’ own mobile devices as a ‘gift’ from the train company.\n\n3 Scholarly Approaches to Background Music\n\nAs a modern and ubiquitous phenomenon, background music has been approached by different academic disciplines with different research interests. These have included psychology of music, historical research, sociology of music, musicology, ethnomusicology, and sound studies. Case studies have scrutinised topics such as music and violence (Reference Johnson and CloonanJohnson & Cloonan 2009), the relationship of music, youths, and everyday life (Reference Nowak and BennettNowak & Bennett 2014), annoying music (Reference TrottaTrotta 2020), the philosophy of ambient sound (Reference SchmidtSchmidt 2023), the influence of background music in wine selection (Reference North, Hargreaves and McKendrickNorth et al. 1999), and whether romantic music influences consumer behaviour in a florist shop (Reference Jacob, Guéguen, Boulbry and SamiJacob et al. 2009).\n\nThere is an extensive body of research on how stores use music to evoke reactions in customers and, further, to influence customers’ decision-making. This has been studied, for example, from the viewpoint of premises playing loud music to increase activity or fast music to pace the in-door traffic flow (Reference Smith and CurnowSmith & Curnow 1966; Reference MillimanMilliman 1982), and the interactive effect on music tempo and mode (minor key) on in-door sales (Reference Knöferle, Spangenberg, Herrmann and LandwehrKnöferle et al. 2011). It has also been suggested that music modifies people’s first impressions of products (Reference ZanderZander 2006) and influences their choices when deciding between two competing foods (Reference Yeoh and NorthYeoh & North 2010); and that background and foreground music shapes emotional responses in the mall (Reference Kang and YiKang & Yi 2019 – carried out in a laboratory setting). The majority of these studies represent disciplines differing from a culturally sensitive research paradigm and are interested in consumer behaviour rather than diverse agencies changing, experiencing, and affecting background music.\n\nCommercial environments are being built with a thorough understanding as well as exploitation of the use of several stimuli simultaneously, such as lights, scents, visuals, and sound, to create desired atmospheres and to influence the consumer’s purchasing intentions (Reference Spence, Puccinelli, Grewal and RoggeveenSpence et al. 2014). The formal and practical knowledge of responses and a wide range of new technologies have led to a situation in which affective responses ‘can be designed into spaces, often out of what seems like very little at all’ (Reference ThriftThrift 2004: 67–8). At a Starbucks coffee shop, this can mean ‘everything from the obvious, like sofas and fabrics and wood and color schemes, to the subtle, like how few CDs to have available or font choices for signs, is carefully selected to create a particular affective response’ (Reference KassabianKassabian 2013: 91).\n\nContemporary circumstances of experiencing background music are thus somewhat different from the musicking settings that had been of academic interest until the 1980s. New questions and approaches became necessary. As one of the first scholars to take an interest in the area, and specifically Muzak, Ronald Radano considered the shift in aesthetic experience produced by what he called ‘consensus music’, urging for a new approach recognising ‘both levels of musical awareness, one reflective and the other nonreflective’ (Reference RadanoRadano 1989: 458). Especially in urban spaces designed for consumption, background music is usually omnipresent, sometimes also overlapping with other music and sound sources: several pieces of music can be heard in a given place at the same time.\n\nEmily Thompson explains in The Soundscape of Modernity: Architectural Acoustics and the Culture of Listening in America 1900–1933 how scientists and engineers manipulated material and architectural constructions to control sound in urban space. The environments converted can be characterised as modern. Firstly, they were efficient and stripped down of sounds considered unnecessary. Secondly, they advanced efficient behaviour in those who heard or listened to them by minimising noise and maximising productivity. Thirdly, they were also modern by becoming products and commodities in a culture defined by the act of consumption and evaluated by the listeners. Moreover, ‘man’s technical mastery over his physical environment’ and nature transformed traditional relationships between sound, space, and time. (Reference ThompsonThompson 2002: 2–4.) Although Thompson’s book deals predominantly with architectural acoustics, the phenomena observed also set the stage for the use of background music. Furthermore, technologically mediated musical sounds and reorganised sonic environments resulted in emerging new trends of listening.\n\nPre-industrialisation manual work was often accompanied by singing to coordinate and pace work and to provide aesthetic pleasure and stimulation. Music was related directly to work through its rhythms, the sounds of the tools, and physical movement. Mechanisation and regulation of work during the industrial period diminished this need and function, and noisy machines made singing impractical. During the Fordist industrialisation in the twentieth century, broadcast music was introduced in British and US workplaces from the top down, following the theories by Frederick Taylor and aimed at controlling the labour process. In contemporary contexts, with professionals engaged in mental work, music is often listened to individually by workers or broadcast in service settings. (Reference Dibben, Haake and BornDibben & Haake 2013: 151–2.)\n\nPre- and post-industrial uses of music can be characterised as two separate phases or ages using unmediated and mediated music, respectively. Unmediated music refers predominantly to acoustically transmitted, oral, and thus unique music, whereas mediated music means widely available, printed, recorded, and electronically and digitally mediated music (Reference Kurkela, Lahti, Uimonen and HeikkinenKurkela et al. 2009: 3). Sensed environments are not only interpreted but actively produced within the triangular relationship among the sensing individual, the environment, and sensorial information, as suggested by Steven Reference Feld, Feld and BassoFeld (1996: 91): ‘As place is sensed, senses are placed; as places make sense, senses make place.’ The notion resonates with Georgina Born’s ideas of music, sound, and space intertwining in complex ways. Music and sounds are mediated by subjectivity, corporeity, and movement through location. In addition, social multiplicity of the same space of subjects constitutes new social relations. Also, temporal mediation transforms the constellation of sound and space in a given acoustic environment. (Reference BornBorn 2013: 19.) Lived experience involves constant shifts in sensory figures and potentials for multisensory interactions.\n\nLike any other music, background music can be interpreted as constructing self-identity – ‘as a device for reflexive process of remembering/constructing who one is’ (Reference DeNoraDeNora 2000: 63). It may not be selected by the person who happens to hear it, but it still affords an opportunity for active listening and memory retrieval. Ethnomusicology and anthropology of sound both approach music and sounds as human culture, looking past music’s stimulus or influence on its listeners, or the assumption that listeners could be reduced to simply passive receivers of music. This approach is in line with contemporary ideas of the power of music as constructed by the listener interacting with the music.\n\nScholarly interests have also reflected the changes in the background music industry and their manifestations in urban space, as well as reactions to mediated music in public places. In their promotion of acoustic design and improvement of sonic environments, early soundscape scholars and pedagogists took a critical stance towards background music and considered it inherently dubious. Part of this can be explained by Muzak Corporation’s widespread presence in the 1960s and 1970s, criticised by soundscape scholars oriented towards Western classical music and related listening practices. The time was ripe for criticism: in 1969, the General Assembly of the International Music Council of UNESCO passed a resolution on ‘abusive use, in private and public places, of recorded or broadcast music’ (see Reference SchaferSchafer 1977: 97–8).\n\nComposer and pedagogue R. Murray Schafer rightly concluded that ‘for the first time in history an international organisation involved primarily with the production of sounds suddenly turned its attention to their reduction’ (Reference SchaferSchafer 1977: 97–8; italics in original). The statement aimed at reducing music was motivated by surprising and in some cases unwanted encounters with background music, indicating an increase of its use. Violinist Yehudi Menuhin, who served on the Council’s Executive Committee, rebelled against having to be a ‘captive audience’ in an airplane playing background music (Reference LanzaLanza 1995: 153). Background music was equally disliked by the younger generation of popular music listeners. When the rock and folk music of the 1960s began to tackle issues related to culture, politics, and sexuality, the easy-listening arrangements of ‘Muzak’s bowdlerized hits seemed more and more like an affront’ (New Yorker 2006). Already in the late 1960s, a small company called Yesco challenged Muzak by selling what it called foreground music (Reference BaumgartenBaumgarten 2012). This change of business logic – replacing background music with foreground music – is described by Jonathan Sterne as follows: ‘Why listen to cheesy remakes when you can hear the original?’ Muzak jumped on the foreground bandwagon in 1983 (Reference Sterne, Quiñones, Kassabian and BoschiSterne 2013: 124) and launched its Foreground Music One channel in 1985. Foreground music’s momentum coincided with lifestyle research trends in their attempt to study particularly ‘the post-hippie hyper-individuals’ and their preferences, including music (Reference Lanza, Richardson, Gorbman and VernallisLanza 2013: 623).\n\nMichael Reference Bull, Richardson, Gorbman and VernallisBull (2013: 630–1) analyses sonic mediation through the filter of technologies that afford responses among city dwellers as Fordist, post-Fordist and hyper-post-Fordist. The first one refers to collectively experienced technologies colonising social spaces, for example shopping centres; post-Fordist refers to niche marketing, for example music played in specific shops to provide the correct ambience for shopping; and hyper-post-Fordist refers to mobile technologies and their users creating individualised soundscapes for themselves. It is essential to understand that all three sound experiences exist simultaneously.\n\nIn his 1997 article on music in shopping centres, Jonathan Sterne finds similarities between foreground music and radio content and clarifies the programming logic called quantum modulation. Unlike background music’s attempt at gradual mood changes, foreground music aims for an unchanging mood. Quantum modulation maintains flow with the help of numerical values based on diverse criteria such as rhythm, tempo, artist, and genre. With the use of cross-fading, the transitions from song to song are seamless. It is assumed that listeners will hear music for a short duration, for example when visiting a shop (Reference SterneSterne 1997: 32). In essence, quantum modulation appears to be an elaborately named trademark developed by Muzak for categorising and selecting foreground music for different purposes as well as making their content stand out from parity products by competitors.\n\nReference Sterne, Quiñones, Kassabian and BoschiSterne (2013: 123) calls programmed music services a ‘second-order media economy’: they utilise music already circulated as a commodity and familiar to listeners. ‘Programmed music requires an earlier, “first” moment of circulation, prior to its own’. Second-order economy programmed music has also challenged scholars to rethink schemes of ‘production’ and ‘consumption’. This applies not only to programmed music: the same principles of second-media economy hold true with radio foreground music playlists, compiled of familiar songs and tunes targeted to given audiences for everyday listening in different environments.\n\nFinnish scholarly literature emphasises the culture-specific nature of background music. Despite being a part of the transnational music industry, background music practices in Finland are framed by conditions such as language issues or national legislation. Contributions include publications from ethnomusicologists, social historians, and soundscape researchers, with interests in practices transforming sonic environments. These include Muzak, use of radio in the workplace, and on-hold music, as well as music at department stores and shopping malls. (See e.g. Reference KilpiöKilpiö 2005 & Reference Kilpiö2011; Reference Ranta, Ampuja and KilpiöRanta 2005; Reference KokkoKokko 2016; Reference Kontukoski and UimonenKontukoski & Uimonen 2019.)\n\nBackground music providers and their clients want listeners and consumers to feel a certain way in stores or in other premises. The transnational challenge they face is that they ‘can no more guarantee listener’s responses to the music than the producer of any cultural text can guarantee its meaning in advance’ (Reference Sterne, Quiñones, Kassabian and BoschiSterne 2013: 126). As a result, they rely on existing recordings while aiming to increase production or consumption. Programmed music’s ability to elicit responses in listeners is constantly underlined in both background music promoters’ behavioural psychological explanations and ideological criticisms of (mis)use of music. However, like any other product ‘its purchasers buy it on its promise’ (Reference Sterne, Quiñones, Kassabian and BoschiSterne 2013: 126). Music does not act upon an individual as a stimulus. Its effect is the result of how individuals orient to it and how they interpret it, not to mention how they ‘place it within their personal musical maps’ of extra-musical associations (Reference DeNoraDeNora 2000: 61). Although not commonly admitted among background music entrepreneurs, this is precisely what the CEO of one of the major companies pointed out to us in an interview quite straightforwardly. When asked if research of music was a matter of importance in their line of business, he stated how customer behaviour is affected by ‘current weather’ or issues such as ‘what Trump just said and what is going on in the South China Sea … whatever happens in an individual’s environment will have a strong effect on his/her consumer behaviour. It is difficult to say whether it was this specific music that we played that caused the collapse or increase of sales’. (ACMEi 2020c.)\n\nWhat has remained largely unanswered and marginal in research is culture-sensitive contextualisation. Background music has often been viewed as a generic, global phenomenon, depleted of cultural characteristics. The conception has never been fully comprehensive, and accuracy has crumbled with each decade and development towards the end of the twentieth century. Specific culture-historical environments restrict, enable, and frame matters such as language used in song lyrics, national and regional transformation of technological environments, and possible differences and similarities in background music selection practices. This holds true especially in non-English-speaking countries (not to say that specific and diverse background music cultures would not exist in English-speaking cultures). Since this Element has taken the question of cultural dependence as one of the themes we wish to explore, we will next present the central socio-historical and cultural developments that form the backdrop to distinctive features in background music cultures in Finland. We hope to present, by first concentrating on a case of a small northern European country, an itemisation and a set of questions that will help with producing a framework for creating workable methods in various background music cultures.\n\n4 Historical Context: Cultural, Societal, and Infrastructural Characteristics\n\nIn this section, we present a concise overview of the circumstances and developments in Finland, for the reader to better grasp the locally conditioned background music cultures. The country went through exceptionally rapid structural changes during the 1950s and 1960s. Urbanisation picked up steam: in 1950, the majority of the population lived in rural areas, but by the early 1980s, the tables had turned, and some 60 per cent of Finns resided in urban areas (in Germany, for instance, the same percentage had been registered in the 1910s).\n\nOne of the most dramatic changes took place in the balance within the Finnish economic structure. The primary sector shrunk to a fraction of its share of employees, while the service sector expanded swiftly from a minor sector of employment into the most important one from the beginning of the 1960s (Reference Haapala, Peltola and HaapalaHaapala & Peltola 2018: 205–6). The Finnish service culture, on the other hand, has been relatively slow in evolving from matter-of-fact conduct of affairs towards hospitality and ‘giving people more than they expect’, sometimes referred to in Finnish colloquial language as ‘continental service culture’.\n\nPrivate consumption also soared. The Finnish consumer society advanced considerably thanks to several developments: the edging away of post-war rationing, favourable circumstances in the world economy, structural changes in the local economy, and migration of the population to the cities (Reference Valkonen, Valkonen, Alapuro, Alestalo, Jallinoja and SandlundValkonen 1985: 211). In the early 1960s, living standards in Finland began to rise rapidly, and people had more money at their disposal. The supply of consumer goods expanded considerably. Paid annual leave increased from 9–12 days to 18–24 days, enabling more spending on leisure and culture. Promises of progress and well-being were associated with an ‘American lifestyle’ and consumer culture, with central local players in trade and industry constantly reporting about their study trips to the United States. (Reference Heinonen, Pantzar, Kipping and TiratsooHeinonen & Pantzar 2002: 44.) Background music systems were among the strategic solutions embraced widely in businesses with the aim of fulfilling these promises and ‘boarding the train of progress’. The ideological and structural forces behind background music adoption are thus particularly distinguishable in Finland.\n\nFace-to-face vocal advertising on the streets, markets, and village roads had faded in the early twentieth century. The Finnish urban soundscape was becoming more noise-laden, and forms of commerce were changing. Itinerant traders and service providers who advertised by shouting and singing in urban spaces gave way to electronically transmitted audio-visual advertising (Reference KilpiöKilpiö 2001: 72–73), which gradually took off. An important aspect of consumerism for both the Finnish soundscape and city structure was motorisation, which happened ‘late and swiftly’ in Finland compared to the other Nordic countries (Reference Bergholm and ToiskallioBergholm 2001: 79–80). Between 1960 and 1973, the number of cars on Finnish roads and streets increased from around 255,000 to over 1 million, and continued to rise rapidly: by 1990, some 2.2 million cars had been registered for road use (ICRT 2022). The trend continued and strengthened, up to the point where Finland has become significantly more motorised than the rest of the Nordic countries (Reference RamseyRamsey 2022). From the point of view of soundscapes inherent to everyday life, this meant at least two developments: noise levels rose in street spaces, and hypermarkets became serious contenders for shopping and running errands in city centres. The insulated interiors of Finnish cars remained out of the advertisers’ reach in Finland for several decades, however, since car radios only played the public broadcasting channels until the deregulation – or more precisely, re-regulation – of radio broadcasting in 1985. On the whole, the 1970s saw major changes in the Finns’ outlooks on life. Emphasis on individuality and the pursuit of personal pleasure increased.\n\nIn restaurant premises, performing live music and playing recordings were closely supervised in Finland, mainly due to the strong position of local copyright organisations (Reference MäkeläMäkelä 2017). For most Finns, dining out was not common before the 1980s. The educated upper classes had warned people against restaurants in the late nineteenth century as ‘places where alcohol was served’. For decades, dining out was an elite custom, while many Finns kept shunning restaurants, on one hand assuming drunken depravity was going on inside, and on the other fearing they themselves would not master the intricate etiquette of restaurant culture. Finns who came of age in and after the 1980s showed a much more positive attitude towards dining and drinking out than the previous generations, and the range of different restaurants widened in Finnish cities. The somewhat negative image of Finnish restaurants also contributed to the 1960s and 1970s popularity of foreign concepts such as pizzerias, pubs, and Chinese restaurants. (Reference SillanpääSillanpää 2002: 215.)\n\nIn terms of sonic environment, and background music in particular, frequenting so-called ethnic restaurants is an interesting development. Before the arrival of restaurant chains, individual restaurant owners usually played whatever music they thought culturally suitable and accurate atmosphere-wise, meaning that patrons of ‘ethnic’ restaurants possibly heard quite diverse sounds and rhythms. The precise musical content could be subject to negotiations, as a former sales representative recalls:\n\nWe got records directly from somewhere in Italy … Italian music; put together a compilation of it, and sent it on its way [to the customer] … and got lambasted. It wasn’t supposed to be Italian music – it was supposed to be Italo-pop, which isn’t really typical Italian music at all, but Euro-pop from Italy.\n\nSelecting songs was a time-consuming process, since one four-hour tape required one hundred songs to be hand-picked (Reference HietanoroHietanoro 2006). In the 1980s, the use of office and workplace music decreased, while the use of music in restaurants and the retail sector increased (Reference PaukkuPaukku 2006). The supply of background music evolved in line with changes in the Finnish restaurant culture. The earlier division into bars, dance restaurants, and food restaurants was challenged, and the restaurant chains and pizzerias introduced in the 1980s democratised eating out into a family event.\n\nToday, the Finnish retail sector is exceptionally concentrated – a state of affairs recognised as a problem by the European Commission Directorate-General for Competition (Reference HukariHukari 2021: 13). Many reasons have been put forward to explain the situation. Among these are the cold climate, forcing consumers to limit their shopping to as few stores as possible; the passion for cars among Finns, sustaining the hypermarkets and driving urban design towards favouring and investing in them; the penny-pinching nature of the Finnish people, driving people to cheaper and larger stores; and the tradition of Finnish women as naturally belonging in the workforce and thus having limited time available for daily shopping. Chiefly, however, the concentration trend for the Finnish grocery trade was dictated by a strong takeover of cooperative groups already in the 1930s. By the end of the 1960s, the plight of small shops had accelerated: groups already accounted for 75 per cent of the grocery market, and over the next ten years, the share rose to over 90 per cent. (Reference KomulainenKomulainen 2018: 9–10: 237.)\n\nThe consequences for background music use are not clear-cut, partly since our background music company interviewees did not comment on the effects of the duopoly on contracts. Cooperative retail companies are managed regionally, and unlike visual uniformity, the background music solutions seem to vary slightly between regions. Unlike the cooperatives’ visual appearance, their background music is not uniform but is instead individually ordered from different music providers by regional cooperatives (ACMEi 2022a). At the individual level, some employees reflected on the state of play in our field material: ‘We think someone’s making a load of money by selling [our employer] that copyright-free music that’s ever so horrible and features the same pieces month after month’. (ACMEs/PAM 2021a.)\n\nThe cooperative retailing conglomerates had a significant role in expanding the size of individual retailing units in the country as well. Several cooperative groups made a purposeful effort in the 1960s to plan and promote a transformation in how daily consumer goods would be acquired in Finland (Reference HankonenHankonen 1994: 226–35). The vision was inextricably interlaced with the idea of suburb living and proceeded from small service outlets to shopping centres and further on to hypermarkets; from service to self-service; from popping over to various shops for different items, wrapped by the shop assistant, to collecting packaged goods, wheeling them to the checkout and on to the family car. Online shopping has further changed the soundscape of consumption to a more private event from a situation that formerly required interaction with other people and, namely, background music in public (see Reference Uimonen, Kytö and RuohonenUimonen et al. 2017: 11).\n\n4.1 Listener-Consumer: Who Were ‘The Audience’?\n\nAs the production of background music and the sound design of consumer spaces has developed towards a unifying, branding, and holistic experience, the spectrum of background music has broadened. Central to this change is the figure of the listener-consumer, determined over the decades through increasingly profiled target groups. The ways of describing and analysing the ‘audience’ vary according to the available technology, music trends, and the level of privacy in spaces accessible for the use of functional music. Finnish texts written by advertising and background music professionals provide an interesting example of this development (see Reference Kilpiö, Järviluoma and PielaKilpiö 2016). In the 1940s and 1950s, Finnish listener-consumers were mostly defined in the texts as passers-by in public or semi-public spaces, easily alienated by mistakes such as excess volume, distortion in sound reproduction, or political content. The local urban soundscape carried considerably less musical content than in later decades, which meant that evading functional music was relatively effortless.\n\n(Photo: Juhani Riekkola, Source: Vapriikki Museum Centre Photo Archives)\n\nFor advertising music-makers, television provided access to the listener-consumers’ homes – a dramatic change resulting in the professionals considering less the possible alienation and more the music’s memorability and general effectiveness. The 1960s listener-consumers appear in the texts as television viewers on one hand and as psychologically susceptible shoppers on the other. Due to the rising standards of living in the country at the time, the 1960s and 1970s writers devoted much attention to the diversifying tastes and musical preferences of listener-consumers. The term ‘target group’ (kohderyhmä in Finnish) was first used in the 1970s. In the later texts, spatial elements of making and experiencing advertising or background music receive less and less attention. They almost disappear, rendering background music as something that is directly communicated from the music content (sound recordings) to the listener-consumer’s mind while it was busy making purchasing decisions.\n\n4.2 Muzak and Competitors in Finland: Building a ‘Consumers’ Republic’ with Sound\n\nThis section provides a historical timeline of the sonic environment created for listener-consumers with background music in Finnish urban spaces from the 1960s until today. We discuss the characteristics of the background music business in the urban framework. In Finland, business-scale marketing of background music products started in the 1960s, with the increasing importance and contribution of the service sector in the country’s economic structure. West-minded men – both individuals and small groups – played an important role in the country’s 1950s and 1960s efforts to remain economically open and find ways to prosper in spite of its small size and population (Ojala et al. 2006). Selling music as a production/consumption enhancement tool to the Finnish business administration suited this receptive environment: marketing and publicising was relatively easy. A salesperson for the Finnish Muzak franchising company remembers:\n\n[S]ome magazines and newspapers got excited, or interested in the idea itself, and wrote articles about it. Then we referred to them and asked, just like a good salesman does nowadays, for an opportunity to come and present this and then they [clients] had one or more people listening to our story.\n\nThe idea of a subliminal, pleasant way to persuade citizens to produce and consume more fit nicely in the U.S.-derived paradigm of a ‘consumer republic’. Combining economic abundance and democratic political freedom – as opposed to the ‘impoverishment’ of the Soviet system (Reference CohenCohen 2003: 125–7), the paradigm created trust and faith in mass consumption as a weapon in the Cold War struggles.\n\nIn 1960, a Finnish company called Finnestrad acquired the Muzak franchising deal. This was by no means the first instance of background music in city space or in workplaces. For example, an extensive open-air sound system was used for Christmas marketing in 1950 along Aleksanterinkatu, a central shopping street in Helsinki. Next year, the country’s oldest and most luxurious department store Stockmann introduced its own centrally operated music system for certain sequences within the workday, collaboratively established by the workers’ board. Muzak marketing, however, claimed to introduce something new: a package solution of content and technology, curated with ‘scientific expertise’ (Helsingin Sanomat 1961; Uusi Suomi 1961). It emphasised the difference between tested, researched background music and ‘music as art’. The product was claimed to be essentially different from the ‘surrounding music culture’, that is, other ways in which people were involved with music. The Muzak selling proposition (the unique benefit offered) was the Stimulus Progression Method, aimed at externally influencing the state of alertness of the employees by changing tempos during the progression of the work day (Reference LanzaLanza 1995: 49).\n\nThe franchisee started small but got ample media coverage and growing interest during the 1960s. Finnish businesses were eager to find ways to increase productivity and cost-effectiveness, and subliminal manipulation of human behaviour was promised to deliver results. This created favourable opportunities for Muzak. The company was also active in attempts to widen the vocal possibilities and uses of the PA systems in public spaces, for example an experiment carried out in 1971 in a school in Helsinki, playing background music through the PA system during school days. No positive effects were observed, and teachers’ reactions were mainly negative, although pupils were in favour of the music .\n\nFinnish listening conventions were also in flux in the 1960s: proponents for contemplative listening and ‘serious music’ were gradually losing the battle against non-attentive listening and the spreading use of popular music in shared spaces. The triumph of ‘scientifically created background tunes’, however, soon proved to be temporary as well. In 1981, arguments on Muzak were polarised in the national newspaper Helsingin Sanomat. It was questioned whether it was beneficial for the employer to let Muzak reduce the employees’ social interaction and chatting. A psychologist interviewed asserted that Muzak had an unfavourable effect on the brain and the central nervous system, a claim denied by Muzak’s Finnish sales manager. Allowing the effect might apply regarding [radio] ‘programme music’, the sales manager argued that Muzak’s effect is actually inverted: it is meant to be heard but not listened to in the first place. He also propounded there was a ‘surprisingly vast amount of silence sold by Muzak dealers’, since their music sequences were followed by a pause of almost equal length. (Reference Kytö, Krajina and StevensonUimonen & Kytö 2020.)\n\nSerious rivals for Muzak appeared in the next decade. Musiikki-Fazer, historically the most prominent music publishing company in Finland, established a background music department in 1973. In four years, the company’s customer base grew to well over a thousand clients, as the business developed, resulting in a market share of around 60–70 per cent. Musiikki-Fazer represented Philips and its background music system, based on eight-hour-long continuous cassettes (Reference MiettinenMiettinen 2006). The tapes contained stylistically uniform instrumental and orchestral or choral music, and were based in part on Polygram’s catalogue. According to a sticker on one such cassette, the ALLEGRO 747 tape contains ‘lively and joyful tunes performed by large orchestras’ (ACMEp 2020).\n\nLike Muzak, Musiikki-Fazer relied on the concept of centrally driven music to influence. In public discourse however, the company’s representatives had to assure their clients that they did not represent ‘muzak’ (cf. Reference Kytö, Krajina and StevensonUimonen & Kytö 2020) – a generalised concept whose image had begun to appear contaminated. Still, the companies competed for the same customers, using partly the same arguments. Musiikki-Fazer’s ‘alertness music’ (viremusiikki) was produced by Philips and aimed at affecting the listener’s degree of activity. The company stood out from its competitors with its wide selection of music and emphasised the superior sound quality of its products compared to those of its competitors. The system used by Muzak was easy to install, but its sound quality was inferior to magnetic tape, because the music was transmitted via telephone lines. Musiikki-Fazer delivered their cassettes to customers via their own distribution or by mail. The music packages they contained were tailored to each customer’s needs and target group. Retail outlets were offered systems that allowed them to record their announcements and combine them with other tape content. (Reference RiikonenRiikonen 1981: 42; Reference MiettinenMiettinen 2006.)\n\nThe business of background music solutions using separately-tailored musical contents was stifled in the 1970s via new awareness of subliminal control and consumer manipulation, combined with increasing access to music and listening technology via compact cassettes (Reference Kilpiö, Kurkela and UimonenKilpiö et al. 2015: 10, 60). Also, instead of employees, background music content began to be aimed increasingly at customers in shops, hotels, and restaurants (Reference HietanoroHietanoro 2006). Since the 1980s, subliminal background music was replaced in most commercial environments with foreground music, recognisable music repertoire with a more audible character and volume. Today, according to our field work, an overwhelming amount of music encounters in Finnish public city spaces entail music for branding purposes, intended for listening while performing other actions – mostly, consuming. This is particularly true for spaces like large shopping malls, termed ‘indoor cities’ (Reference HopkinsHopkins 1994).\n\nA long-standing source of background and foreground music in restaurants, pubs, bars, and cafés has been the jukebox. This creates an interesting reversion of antecedent technology, since early Muzak had been presented as a contender to the jukebox (Reference SterneSterne 2003: 189). In Finland, the locations of jukeboxes were medium strength beer licensed establishments, of which a total of 2,716 were founded after the liberalisation of beer sales in 1969. The number of jukeboxes owned by RAY (Finland’s Slot Machine Association) peaked in 1977 at almost 3000, at a time when the domestic recording industry was at its strongest. Towards the end of the 1980s, their number fell by two thirds due to the proliferation of cable and satellite television channels and the growth of radio music. (Alko 2022; Reference MuikkuMuikku 2001: 172.) Music content of the jukeboxes parallels the general transformation of Finnish popular music culture, from the 1970s iskelmä (Finnish schlager) and Finnish-language rock called suomirock to a widening spectrum of genres including English-language lyrics and media-influenced trends (Reference NymanNyman 2005). Jukeboxes also helped to disseminate music considered unsuitable, or even banned, by the publicly funded Yleisradio (Finnish Broadcasting Company) due to, for example, allegedly sexual, political, or otherwise dubious lyrics. For their part, jukeboxes thus disrupted and challenged Yleisradio’s monopoly. The accessibility of mediated music was further accelerated by the 1980s re-regulation of media.\n\n4.3 Radio Broadcasting and the Digitised Background Music\n\nTerrestrial radio has been by far the most common source of background music in Finland for decades (Reference Partanen, Ahomäki and LevolaPartanen et al. 2020). Its popularity at home and in open offices can be explained partly by easy-to-use radio receivers. This competitive edge was consolidated especially after the 1985 media re-regulation, when the first local and commercial stations rearticulated music dissemination but also increased the use of broadcast music in novel contexts. The somewhat conservative Yleisradio was forced to react in fear of losing their audiences. Since its establishment in 1926, Yleisradio (YLE, Finnish Broadcasting Company) had maintained a somewhat paternalistic ethos and enlightening programme policy with a highbrow profile similar to other public broadcasting companies in Europe. The music content consisted predominantly of classical music. Yleisradio’s first commercial contender was launched in 1961 when Radio Nord, an offshore station, began broadcasting from the international waters off Stockholm, Sweden. As a consequence, Yleisradio introduced a music programme Sävelradio (Melody Radio) in 1963. The reactive music policy continued twenty years later: in fear of losing their young listeners, Yleisradio launched Rockradio in 1980. (Reference KemppainenKemppainen 2001; Reference Kurkela and UimonenKurkela & Uimonen 2009: 138.)\n\nRadio music contents are intertwined with the transformation of music distribution channels, related global trends of the media industry, as well as re-regulation of the media (see Reference Hujanen, Nordenstreng and WiioHujanen 2001: 94). The last-mentioned includes changes in radio ownership and music supply within the regulatory framework of the media landscape extending the research scope to technological-economic, historical, socio-cultural and sometimes ideological articulations, discourses, and interactions. When the first commercial and local radios were founded in Finland, the recurring themes in public discussion were radio liberation, breaking of monopolies, media democracy, and how the new radio entrepreneurs would herald this transformation. (Reference UimonenUimonen 2011: 12.)\n\nYleisradio’s radio channels were reorganised in 1990, when the initial enthusiasm in commercial radio stations started to wane. The economic recession of the early 1990s also challenged the future prospects of commercial radio stations. When profiling the channels, Yleisradio paid particular attention to music, since it was considered a suitable strategic tool. Music enabled the broadcaster to reach the desired audience segments and to profile different channels and their programmes’ internal structures. (Reference KemppainenKemppainen 2001: 148, 152–154, 226–7.)\n\nBy the time commercial radio stations were introduced, unobtrusive background music arrangements were replaced in numerous business premises with recordings by original artists intended for listening (Reference KilpiöKilpiö 2011: 15). This change was and continues to be influenced by new media technologies and shifts in the ownership of radio stations. Since the early 1990s, the Finnish radio business has become increasingly concentrated in the hands of individual broadcasters and international media houses redefining the target groups and music contents of the radio and also the listeners’ relationship with ubiquitous music. (Reference Ala-FossiAla-Fossi 2005; Reference UimonenUimonen 2011.)\n\nIn the early 1990s, commercial radio stations and related industries developed computer programs that, combined with multiple CD players, enabled the use of recorded announcements of the studio hosts, and thus the use of unmanned studios and round-the-clock, automated broadcasting. The new software applied in managing background music reflected the digitalisation and emerging automation of music dissemination in general. The background music industry made its first attempts to classify music and programme CD players digitally, too. Furthermore, CD jukeboxes changed later music listening practices profoundly, since they enabled the non-stop playing of music. Jukeboxes provided a continuous stream of less popular performances for the listener, but the hits of the day were available only for a fee. (ACMEi 2021d; Reference UimonenUimonen 2011.)\n\nNew innovations in music dissemination were not always considered blessings by background music entrepreneurs. The limited storage capacity of 1990s computer hard drives allowed a practical music quality of compressed mp3-files. After installing a music system to the client’s premises, a background music entrepreneur of that time recalls being appalled by its inferior sound quality compared to sound standards set by CDs (ACMEi 2021d).\n\nThe post-millennial period in the background music industry can be characterised as an era of changing platforms, with different technologies and background music applications being used in intertwined ways. In the early 2000s, multi-disc CD players were used to provide music for business premises; in the mid-2000s, first attempts were made to control music through computer programming and to transmit music over the internet. (ACMEi 2020a; ACMEi 2022a.) The decision by Finnish telecom operators to sell unlimited 3G packages proved financially disadvantageous to them, however, was not retracted in the transition to 4G and 5G networks. Unlimited data transfer covered most urban areas at the time and the entire country by the 2020s, enabling cheap and accessible mobile streaming and accelerating the ubiquitous use of online music. Companies with a new business logic entered the market, such as Spotify’s Soundtrack Your Brand (ex-Spotify Business) with algorithm-based music selection, and Epidemic Sound, which offers ‘copyright-free’ music to its customers. Background music fees are determined by customer seats or surface area of business premises. Thus, it makes sense, for example, for malls to play music familiar to the end users in their commercial premises, but copyright-free, previously unknown music in their parking garages (ACMEi 2020a).\n\nThe public use of radio music or practically any background music is subject to licensing and remuneration. In Finland, background music licences are granted and the collected license fees distributed by Teosto (the copyright society for composers, lyricists, arrangers, and music publishers) and Gramex (the collective management organisation for recorded music). They have been represented since 2016 by their joint venture GT Musiikkiluvat (2022) in handling the sales, marketing, and billing of background music licences. The joint venture underlines that using copyrighted music publicly as agreed ensures that music-makers are remunerated. With radio broadcasting, copyright revenues can be allocated in more detail based on the radio music reports, whereas those of the background music companies are distributed on an estimated basis (GT Musiikkiluvat 2022, ACMEi 2021c). Background music is indeed a lucrative business: in 2019, Teosto received revenues from background music totalling €9.5 million, comparable in size to revenues from concerts and events. Gramex (IFPI Finland) received a total of €9 million from background music.\n\nIn promoting background music, GT Musiikkiluvat uses rhetoric that to some extent parallels that of 1970s Muzak, including increasing efficiency and improving atmosphere at workplaces. Unlike Muzak, however, their public discourse explicitly promotes foreground music and underlines individual and collective meanings attached to music by its listeners. Also, instead of using quasi-scientific arguments on music’s effects on listeners, GT Musiikkiluvat Oy’s website refers to assorted peer-reviewed scholarly literature. Yet another distinction in marketing rhetoric is made by citing interviews of background music clients who characterise royalty-free music somewhat pejoratively as ‘elevator music’.\n\nThis line of argumentation is also relevant historically: Teosto and the other copyright societies have been active in lobbying for the music-makers’ interests and supervising them. In 1962, Teosto had a dispute over revenues with the Finnish Muzak franchisee. The following year, the organisation supervised the use of radio for background music purposes in the Finnish capital, Helsinki, in collaboration with law enforcement (Teosto 2022). Copyright disputes have affected the organisation’s public image and been a frequent topic of headlines in the media.\n\n4.4 Finland: A Summary\n\nIn what follows, we have summarised central cultural, societal and infrastructural characteristics shaping local background music practices in Finland. Traits described previously are condensed here, with added mentions of smaller but relevant factors.\n\n(1) Cultural:\n\nhigh overall level of education; relative openness to new technologies and solutions (such as ‘Taylorist’ use of background music) within the general population\n\nsonic practices in public spaces: extensive motorisation (however, sounding car horns infrequent)\n\nradio as a part of the sonic practices – with a significant turning point in 1985, when commercial stations emerged as strong contenders for listeners against the centrally planned, enlightening radio policy of the publicly funded Yleisradio; in a few years independent stations were conglomerated and their music contents streamlined\n\nextensive use of the Finnish language within the idiosyncratic and extremely popular music genres iskelmä (Finnish schlager/pop hit song) and suomirock (Anglo-American rock with Finnish lyrics), leading to negotiations in selection for background music playlists\n\nsocial communication code with a relatively high tolerance of silence (absence of talk) and quietude\n\nservice culture: a gradual shift in emphasis from errand-running and matter-of-fact behaviour towards nuanced customer service, resulting in increasing demands by employees regarding emotional and sensory labour\n\ndelayed democratisation of restaurant culture; preference of pizzerias and other ‘ethnic’ restaurants over Finnish ones in the 1960s and 1970s\n\n(2) Societal:\n\nthe influential and proactive position of copyright organisations for composers and musicians\n\nmedia re-regulation from the mid-1980s (especially regarding commercial radio – see the previous ‘Cultural’ section)\n\nrelaxing the restrictions and regulations of restaurants and sales of alcoholic beverages, especially in the 1960s and 1970s – for example, decontrolling the locations where medium strength beer was allowed to be sold and served in 1969\n\n(3) Infrastructural:\n\nlate but swift urbanisation, change of economic structure (towards increased importance of the service sector), and consumer society\n\nprolonged bias in favour of shopping malls and car-centric urban development\n\nexceptionally centralised grocery trade\n\nswift adoption of compact cassettes as mainstream listening and prosuming technology in the 1970s\n\nunlimited mobile data packages as a norm from the early 2000s\n\nIn the final discussion of this Element, we shall return to these points and characteristics and draft a checklist of questions for future research. In the following three sections, we introduce our empirical approach and results on the aspects of Finnish background music cultures. We proceed from ‘factory’ (the line of business where background music is produced and compiled) via ‘subjects’ (service sector employees) and their tactics in the interspace, to the ‘consumer’ (the end users of city spaces and services in them).\n\n5 Around the Drawing Board: Providing Background Music\n\nThis section studies the analysts and designers of the background music industry by considering and contextualising their agency. In any environment where music is used, the concept of agency concerns individuals’ capacities for action in relation to music or music-related settings. It refers to not only how we do things with music but also how music does something to/for us. Collective music agency can be detected where music is used for structuring social encounters, coordinating bodily action, affirming and exploring collective identity, and knowing the world. (Reference Karlsen and Sturman.Karlsen 2019: 2–3.)\n\nEmbedded in the study of music in culture, agency can be considered to be a socio-musicological and ethnomusicological topic. It can be detected in the various ways in which a society musically defines itself: its taxonomy of music, its ideas of what music does, and in the way it changes its music, relates to, absorbs, and influences other music (Reference NettlNettl 1983/2005: 12–13). Although music is a ‘resource for modulating and structuring the parameters of aesthetic agency’ such as feeling, motivation, and desire (Reference DeNoraDeNora 2000: 53), its use is enabled, restricted, and shaped by social and cultural contexts. A scholarly approach to any contemporary background music company’s actions and the agencies of its individual employees should consider the context where music is allegedly being experienced. This is related to the notion that music does not contain any inherent meanings transferrable to its listeners, although it carries an ‘immediate threat of history’ (Reference KassabianKassabian 2001: 3). For companies providing background music, the contextual reliance is both a blessing and a curse, since it means that music can be controlled to some extent, but total control cannot be achieved.\n\nAgency is related to present-day music culture activities, but also to those aspects of the past that have helped the contemporary music culture to become what it is. Focusing solely on background music companies’ current professional environments may not sufficiently explain the existing practices of these companies. They need to be contextualised by charting the employees’ previous experience and networks. The contemporary background music industry in Finland is rooted in competence acquired in various sectors of commercial music media, including musicianship, local and commercial radios, disc jockeying, the live music industry, recording studios, and audio engineering. This means that prior to establishing careers in the background music industry, the CEOs and employees already have established networks and experience in retail sales, media, or Finnish music culture in general at their disposal.\n\nBy analysing musicking (the processes, discourses, and activities related to music) of four diverse Finnish background music companies, it is possible to see how agency is manifest in designing the sonic environments of commercial premises. These conscious choices in sonic environments are constructed with diverse motives by different actors to employ music ‘as an ordering material in social life’ (Reference DeNoraDeNora 2000: x). Different background music companies operate in the same field of business, such as in shopping environments or offering music branding services for individual shops and enterprises. Still, there are differences that help to flesh out the multifaceted nature of the industry and the specific areas or fields of expertise that warrant investigation. In one of our recent publications (Reference UimonenUimonen 2022a), agencies of background music companies turned out to be framed quite diversely in contexts of ownership, clients, music content, overall music profiles, music acquisition, music selection and governing, music evaluation, music platform, and client infrastructure. In what follows, we present examples of how these contexts affect the agencies observable in the companies.\n\n5.1 Background Music Companies\n\nThe four background music companies covered in this section operate in the same field of business, but their business environments, clientele, and agencies differ to some extent. Mall Voice plays a key role in building the soundscapes of shopping centres; DjOnline is an experienced developer of music management software; Mood Media operates in Finland, but as a part of an international background music company, which both enables and limits its music selection processes. Bauer Media, unlike other players in the industry, sells generative music to its clients alongside more conventional background music. We interviewed eleven people, ten of whom attended group interview settings at the companies’ premises in 2019 and 2020 (ACMEi 2019a; ACMEi 2019b; ACMEi 2020a; ACMEi 2020b). Open-ended questions relating to aforementioned themes were posed to participants, who also brought up topics of their interests such as research and development of music software and client infrastructure.\n\nThe Finnish-owned Mall Voice has predominantly shopping malls as clients, and the audible content it provides is composed of voice advertisements and background music used in the hallways. Profiling sonic environments of individual shops or premises is considered more straightforward compared to profiling an entire shopping mall, due to the need to please all end users visiting the premises. According to the company’s business philosophy, music should not interfere with shopping, condensed by the interviewee as ‘You are not supposed to concentrate on sing-along but to find the nearest optician’. A compilation of 600 to 800 songs characterised as ‘non-disturbing’ is updated by Mall Voice at least once a month. The principle guiding the company’s music selection process is to make potential customers stay longer in the mall. This is partly explained by the fact that the number of out-of-town customers has dropped due to increased online shopping. As a rule of thumb, daily rhythms and language used in song lyrics are taken into consideration in music selection: during daytime, non-Finnish language music content helps Finnish language voice advertisements to stand out. Mall Voice has subcontracted music acquisition to five companies. A suitable subcontractor is selected by Mall Voice personnel and music evaluated from the supplier’s ready-made or customised playlists in collaboration with the client, usually represented by shopping mall management. (ACMEi 2019b.)\n\nThe principles of quantum modulation are applied to music selection, although the company primarily uses subcontracted and ready-made playlists. Mall Voice strives to distinguish itself from its competitors via its main product – voice advertising supported by background music. This explains why in Finnish shopping mall environments, speech content overrides and interrupts music content. The process of voice advertisement production in Mall Voice is standardised: a two-minute production time includes the copy reading and audio processing (compression and limiting), resulting in 150 to 250 ads produced per week. According to the studio manager, production time is limited due to the relatively large number of completed ads, which are then updated on the client’s sound system. The amount of audio advertising included in Mall Voice contracts means voice advertisements are not only played between music tracks. Background music is faded out before a voice advertisement is played, and after the ad, the overall sound level is automatically restored. (ACMEi 2019b.)\n\nDjOnline (ACMEi 2020a), a locally owned background music company, operates with a different clientele and business logic compared to Mall Voice. It provides music for various enterprises and actively researches and develops software for music selection applications. The company’s personnel characterised their line of work as providing music for ‘public premises’ where different products or services are offered. Instead of music genres, specific artists are used as reference points, especially when clients may be uncertain what they are looking for. Individual playlists are evaluated by client feedback and customised accordingly. Unlike background music targeted to a wider audience (e.g. in a shopping mall environment), DjOnline’s tailored music selection takes advantage of the alleged personal and collective meanings attached to songs and music genres. DjOnline personnel outline music profiles for smaller enterprises such as bars and restaurants in accordance with their customers’ music tastes. Music, including record companies’ new releases and the occasional hand-picked songs from company employees’ personal analogue record collections, is acquired by uploading it to the company’s server. (ACMEi 2020a.) For selecting, controlling, and evaluating music, DjOnline’s personnel use the company’s own categorisation and evaluation system, with parameters such as tempo, year of publication, language, length, and whether the music is considered suitable for background or foreground use. The parameters supersede a time-consuming song-by-song compiling of the playlists.\n\nThe nature of the background music business and its end product has also transformed from the era of functionally arranged music. The business logic of contemporary background music companies is based on the dissemination of music and on the background music companies’ professional skills in selecting and categorising music. It is more akin to the business logic of a commercial radio station or a gig promoter than of producers of music content.\n\nA recurring topic in the interviews was technological and infrastructural constraints restricting professional sound design and how these issues should be solved when designing and constructing malls. The DjOnline personnel strongly criticised shopping mall infrastructure and its design, especially the use of outdated or inferior quality loudspeakers.\n\nThose highly paid interior designers with huge salaries … they think about colours and they think about furniture and then comes this Excel guy, who decides to save ten euros from each loudspeaker of the emergency audio system. After that it is practically impossible to make good sound design.\n\nThe emergency audio systems’ mid-range loudspeakers are considered suitable for announcements, but they are poorly suited to some music genres. The audio system dramatically emphasises the frequency of brass instruments. The personnel recounted a case where, because of this feature, their client’s hopes of specific up-tempo music for specific parts of the mall remained unfulfilled: when volume was adjusted in accordance with the horn section, the speech content, such as announcements and advertisements, was practically inaudible. On the other hand, in some premises, the audibility of background music was poor due to loud sound levels of refrigerators and digital slot machines (ACMEs/Kk 2020).\n\nThus, musicking in the background music context expands to questions of listening and understanding not only music content but also the material surroundings of where (and how) music is distributed and experienced. A representative of a major background music distributor reminisced on these challenges already in the 1980s, a time when business was expanding from workplaces to public premises. Music was intended to mask, for example, the sound sources of restaurants, which required an education process: new clientele were deliberately advised not to pay attention to the music. (Reference HietanoroHietanoro 2006.) The interaction of music, listener, and place was intentionally transformed when clients were encouraged to dishearken background music.\n\nThe multinational company Mood Media (ACMEi 2020b) also follows the logic of quantum modulation practices. The personnel have vast resources at their disposal, and they follow the general outlines of their international music selection policies. An overall music profile is tailored to the clients’ needs – a process that often includes mapping the business premises and target groups depending on the brand’s image or customer traffic flow. As pointed out by one research participant, by selling a product with jazz or classical music, ‘you can probably ask for a higher price than you can ask with basic pop music’ that’s available on commercial radio ‘to anyone who wishes to listen to it’. The company’s international music resources and music expertise of various genres and languages are available for employees in Finland. In practice, this means that music acquisition, selection, and control are carried out to a large extent in collaboration with the conglomerate’s international personnel ‘tagging’ songs (categorising music with different parameters). Use of algorithms in music selection in their line of business was not considered proper: ‘It takes between ten and fifteen minutes for a client to visit a shop … This equals about five songs, and there is no chance to do it well if you let some machine randomly select music with similar rhythm’ (ACMEi 2020b).\n\nAt Mood Media (ACMEi 2020b), the company’s music designer evaluates artists, lyrics, and even solitary words in the context of client needs, labelling a song with lyrics deemed dubious or negative as improper in the company’s software. The practice underlines the nature of selecting background music for public premises: a song suitable for a nostalgic rock radio channel is considered improper for a waiting room ‘if you are about to see an oncologist’. Algorithm-based playlists used by online music services were criticised due to their unpredictability: Sting’s ‘Englishman in New York’ is a ‘classic’ and could be categorised as popular music of a certain decade for a certain demographic, but the song’s dynamic arrangement makes it unsuitable for background music compilations for public premises. Selecting music is framed by cultural norms and language aspects. Some artists are banned from Mood Media playlists – they simply cannot be selected by the personnel even if requested by clients. The company’s software is equipped with specific colour codes for categorising music. No four-letter words are allowed, nor songs containing lyrics that might remotely sound like these in a noisy environment. On the other hand, Finnish Mood Media employees code domestic releases in accordance with company policies, which allows selecting some English-language songs from Finnish releases that might be considered inappropriate in English-speaking countries. This freedom of agency was described by an employee as follows: ‘I am able to retrieve songs … with lyrics including where you’re “high” referring to that you’re stoned or in a good mood. Some U.S. brands are sensitive even to that’ (ACMEi 2020b).\n\nBauer Media offers generative music (produced by software using parameters to generate ambient-like sonic streams, with a logic similar to videogame music). An overall music profile for generative music is delivered for them by Sound Agency in London, UK. According to Sound Agency (2014), ‘generative soundscapes are relatively association-free’, ever-changing, and capable of emulating natural or urban soundscapes or musical styles. They are typically played at an ambient level, ‘operating at the subconscious level rather than being foreground sound’. Potential environments suitable for generative music can be any public space with unpleasant sounds or noise, such as train and metro stations, airports, and shopping malls, that are not suitable for background music. Bauer Media considers that generative music can be used for making a place more sonically pleasant, to make people more peaceful, or to quicken their pace. Clothing stores with young employees, who may ‘need to be activated’ with music, are not necessarily among the product’s end users. (ACMEi 2019a.)\n\nResembling Muzak marketing rhetoric halfway through the twentieth century, Bauer Media interviewee characterised generative music by juxtaposing it with background music – or any music, for that matter. The definitions relate to a general understanding that generative music is distinctively something Western popular music is not, supported by the argument that generative music lacks structures such as repetition and choruses: ‘We produce soundscapes – or our device produces soundscapes … You never know what is going to happen next’ (ACMEi 2019a). This definition of soundscape bears little resemblance to the concept’s scholarly use (Reference SchaferSchafer 1977). Instead, it is used discursively for advertising and product differentiation from the company’s other products, such as audio branding and radio advertising, of which the latter is predominantly framed by meticulously compiled playlists of well-known popular music (see next section).\n\nGenerative music is evaluated by feedback from clients, whose employees have sometimes described it as ‘boring’ – especially where it has replaced the foreground music used earlier (ACMEi 2019a). When evaluated in the context of individual and collective meanings attached to music, the comment of ‘boring music’ holds true. It also makes yet another explanation plausible. Since ‘music refers to other music’ and ‘music in the mainstream uses musical codes to convey a mood or idea’ (Reference KassabianKassabian 2001: 51), it seems that generative music runs the risk of not being able to refer to something even vaguely familiar to the listeners or their expectations.\n\nYeah, this has variation – the stuff that gets played on radios and so on. We had an experiment where every other day a sort of tinkling was played and then again ordinary music. It was just awful [the interviewee made a weary gesture] and the customers were like [here, the interviewee glowered]. That was terminated, and we gave feedback.\n\nAnother analogy between generative music and music provided by Muzak is the absence of lyrics. The social content of music represented by lyrics and familiar melodies transfers the past to the present (Reference HuschHusch 1984; 131–2; Reference Kilpiö, Heinonen and PeltonenKilpiö 2013: 237), which enables workers to manage their time and use music as a ‘mental outlet’ from monotonous work. This function of music seems to be missing from generative ‘soundscapes’: they continue the ‘intentional decentering and distribution of subjectivity by musical means’ (Reference AndersonAnderson 2015: 819) inherent in Muzak and other mood music content. Generative music challenged background music by stripping cultural meanings attached to music content listened to in public places. It remains to be seen whether its parameters are capable of conveying subtle, culturally specific meanings to music by combining melodic fragments, keys, modes, intervals, and so on – familiar to its listeners but not so obvious as to be actualised at the level of the personal meanings attached to existing songs or instrumental music.\n\nBauer Media stated that they have installed microphones in ‘public premises to listen to noise levels’ in order to help to adjust the volume of background music. This automatic adjustment of the sonic environment is planned to be carried out in the future with the help of external data such as weather, cash register receipts, number of customers in premises, or even facial recognition to provide information for the system on parameters such as age and gender of customers. (ACMEi 2019a.)\n\nLegal and ethical questions may yet induce stumbling blocks for the use of data collected from various sources by digital technology in service of the background music industry. The idea itself parallels larger trends of utilising external data in music selection processes. The digital music streaming service Spotify patented a technology that will allow the analysis of users’ voices and then suggest songs based on their ‘emotional state, gender, age, or accent’. This would allow observing not only users’ emotions but also their environment using machine listening technology. (Reference SavageSavage 2021.) The General Data Protection Regulation sets out requirements for companies and organisations on collecting and managing personal data, applying it to organisations in the European Union and organisations outside the EU that target people living in the EU (2021). This may suggest that music’s public use is becoming the subject of data protection, which is monitored and regulated at both the national and European levels.\n\nWhen music affects social or commercial agency, the control over music is a source of social and/or commercial negotiation of power. This is manifested in affordances constructed in various commercial spaces, supporting various agencies available to customers. Music or any other sounds can also be used to signify explicitly non-democratic issues, or to help maintain social inequality – a policy that would be hard to accept in any other form of city planning (Reference Sterne, Quiñones, Kassabian and BoschiSterne 2013: 135).\n\n5.2 Radio Content as Background Music\n\nIn this section, we focus on the background uses and features of radio content by analysing the operating principles and programming logic behind the audible outcome. In public urban space, radio programming content competes with other media content. Commercial and publicly funded radio music can be characterised as ubiquitous. Whether intended or not, radio music returns the listeners’ affects and past experiences to everyday listening situations. This is complemented by the present-day topics selected and commented on by radio hosts.\n\nTerrestrial radio stations provide most of the background music in Finland. A 2020 report by the copyright organisation Teosto (Reference Partanen, Ahomäki and LevolaPartanen et al. 2020: 4–7, 25) found that background music derived from terrestrial radio is most often listened to in shops, barbershops, restaurants, taxis, and sports facilities. Radio’s share as background music had increased since 2019 (from 66 per cent to 68 per cent), whereas background music services were used by only 12 per cent of the companies. Finnish Broadcasting Company YLE’s radio channels are most common in taxis (55 per cent) and restaurants (34 per cent), while commercial radio channels are most listened to in fitness centres (96 per cent).\n\nRadio channels and background music companies can be approached as cultural industries referring to producers and distributors of different forms of culture, competing with each other for the same resources. These include limited pools of disposable consumer income, advertising revenue, consumption time, and skilled creative and technical labour (Reference HesmondhalghHesmondhalgh 2019: 16). Drawing from available research on the culture industry, the music industry and its products can be interpreted as a means of organising consumers’ leisure time and thus facilitating reproductive labour for the sake of profit (cf. Reference Horkheimer and AdornoHorkheimer & Adorno 2008). Radio programming pursues this through music selection that aims to regulate not only the listeners’ leisure time but also time spent at work. Assumption of music and speech content as mood regulators of workers can be detected in the advertising discourses of radio stations. The choice of music and the nature of the radio hosts’ parlance have features similar to the Taylorist understanding of workplace well-being (‘Every weekday from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. on N"
