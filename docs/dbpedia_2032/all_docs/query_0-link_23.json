and\n\nWhereas, Lipedema is characterized by bilateral, excess symmetrical fatty tissue that bruises easily, mainly in the hip region, upper and lower leg areas, or upper arms, combined with a tendency for leg swelling that worsens when standing; and\n\nWhereas, The etiology of lipedema and other types of fatty tissue enlargement is still unknown, although a genetic cause is suspected; and\n\nWhereas, Individuals who suffer from this disease are further impacted by the absence of diagnostic tools, the lack of pubic and medical awareness of lipedema, and the stigma associated with weight gain; and\n\nWhereas, Patients suffering from lipedema cannot simply shed the additional weight and size through typical or extreme weight loss measures; and\n\nWhereas, The disease is progressive through four stages, which means that the condition gradually worsens and is degenerative, painful, disfiguring, and can lead to permanent disability; and\n\nWhereas, Certain types of liposuction are the only treatments that can reverse the pain, disfigurement, and immobility caused by lipedema; and\n\nWhereas, Most lipedema patients cannot access this surgery due to its classification as a cosmetic procedure and the costs associated with paying out-of-pocket, which can be tens of thousands of dollars, and many require numerous surgeries to treat their condition; now, therefore, be it\n\nResolved by the Senate, That the members of this legislative body recognize June 2019 as Lipedema Awareness Month; and be it further\n\nResolved, That we urge the medical community to expand both education and research of this painful disease and to spread awareness of lipedema while advocating for Michiganders who may be suffering in silence.\n\nThe question being on the adoption of the resolution,\n\nThe resolution was adopted.\n\nSenators Alexander, Brinks, Bullock, Johnson, Lucido, McCann, McMorrow and VanderWall were named co-sponsors of the resolution.\n\nSenators Bumstead, Lucido, Bizon, Wojno, Outman, Bayer, Victory, VanderWall and Hollier offered the following resolution:\n\nSenate Resolution No. 64.\n\nA resolution to recognize July 2019 as Michigan Wildlife Conservation Month.\n\nWhereas, Michigans natural beauty, abundant wildlife, and plentiful waters are enjoyed from Belle Isle to Baraga by millions of residents and visitors, and should be preserved and protected for future generations; and\n\nWhereas, Hunters and fishermen were among the first conservationists, pushing for active wildlife management and conservation to ensure wildlife would flourish forever; and\n\nWhereas, Science-based wildlife management and conservation decisions such as actively enhancing habitat, monitoring wildlife populations, preventing the spread of disease, and regulating hunting and fishing seasons help balance our use of natural resources with the needs of Michigans wildlife; and\n\nWhereas, As a result of these protections, regulations, and extensive conservation efforts, Michigan populations of elk, wild turkey, white-tailed deer, lake sturgeon, and many other species have rebounded from near extinction; 11,000 inland lakes and 36,000 miles of rivers and streams are safeguarded from invasive species; abundant wildlife habitat and wildfire risk are improved by forest management; and\n\nWhereas, July 1, 2019, marks the eighty-first anniversary of the effective date for the Pittman-Robertson Federal Aid in Wildlife Restoration Act, which provides funding for wildlife management projects across the nation through the purchase of hunting equipment; and\n\nWhereas, Hunting and fishing licenses, not state taxes, provide tens of millions of dollars each year for wildlife conservation; and\n\nWhereas, Annually, hunters and anglers contribute $11.2 billion to Michigans economy and create 171,000 jobs, making those combined activities one of the states top 10 job-creating industries, according to a recent study by the Michigan United Conservation Clubs; and\n\nWhereas, This resolution coincides with the fifth anniversary of the creation of the Michigan Wildlife Council, a bipartisan-approved panel entrusted with educating the public about the importance of wildlife management in preserving Michigans outdoor heritage for future generations; and\n\nWhereas, In large part because of the councils activities, more Michiganders than ever before are aware of the essential role hunting and fishing play in conserving, managing, and protecting Michigans wildlife; now, therefore, be it\n\nResolved by the Senate, That the members of this legislative body recognize July 2019 as Michigan Wildlife Conservation Month; and be it further\n\nResolved, That a copy of this resolution be transmitted to the Michigan Wildlife Council.\n\nThe question being on the adoption of the resolution,\n\nThe resolution was adopted.\n\nSenators Alexander, Ananich, Brinks, Bullock, Johnson, MacDonald, McBroom, McCann, McMorrow and Santana were named co-sponsors of the resolution.\n\nSenator Barrett offered the following resolution:\n\nSenate Resolution No. 65.\n\nA resolution to commemorate June 27, 2019, as Post Traumatic Stress Injury Awareness Day.\n\nWhereas, The brave men and women of the United States (U.S.) Armed Forces, who proudly serve the United States, risk their lives to protect the freedom of the United States and deserve the investment of every possible resource to ensure their lasting physical, mental, and emotional wellbeing; and\n\nWhereas, More than 2,000,000 U.S. service members have deployed as part of overseas contingency operations since the events of September 11, 2001; and\n\nWhereas, The military has sustained an operational tempo for a period of time unprecedented in the history of the United States, with many service members deploying multiple times to combat zones, placing them at high risk of post traumatic stress injury (PTSI); and\n\nWhereas, It is expected that ten thousand veterans will return to the state of Michigan every year for the next three to five years after spending a significant amount of time in combat environments, exposing thousands of soldiers to traumatic life threatening events; and\n\nWhereas, The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs reports that in fiscal year 2012, more than 500,000 veterans from all wars who sought care at a Department of Veterans Affairs medical center received treatment for PTSI; and\n\nWhereas, PTSI significantly increases the risk of depression, suicide, and drug or alcohol-related disorders and deaths; and\n\nWhereas, Thousands of Michigan corrections professionals who perform a critical and dangerous job protecting the public suffer health detriments due to high stress and potentially traumatic occupational experiences. Recent studies have shown that nearly 33.7 percent of surveyed corrections officers are estimated to be PTSI positive in this state; and\n\nWhereas, The U.S. Department of Defense and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs have made significant advances in the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of PTSI and the symptoms of PTSI. However, many challenges remain; and\n\nWhereas, The establishment of a Post Traumatic Stress Injury Awareness Day in Michigan will raise public awareness about issues related to PTSI; now, therefore, be it\n\nResolved by the Senate, That the members of this legislative body commemorate June 27, 2019, as Post Traumatic Stress Injury Awareness Day; and be it further\n\nResolved, That we urge the Michigan Veterans Affairs Agency and the Adjutant General to continue working to educate service members, veterans, the families of service members and veterans, and the public about the causes, symptoms, and treatment of post traumatic stress injury; and be it further\n\nResolved, That a copy of this resolution be transmitted to the Governor of the state of Michigan.\n\nThe question being on the adoption of the resolution,\n\nThe resolution was adopted.\n\nSenators Alexander, Ananich, Brinks, Bullock, Geiss, Hollier, Johnson, Lucido, MacDonald, McCann, McMorrow, Moss, Santana, VanderWall and Wojno were named co-sponsors of the resolution.\n\nSenator MacDonald offered the following resolution:\n\nSenate Resolution No. 66.\n\nA resolution to commemorate July 20, 2019, as Filipino-American Friendship Day.\n\nWhereas, July 2019 marks the 73rd anniversary of the Treaty of Manila which granted Philippine independence from the United States in 1946; and\n\nWhereas, During World War II, the Empire of Japan occupied the islands until a United States campaign led by General Douglas MacArthur and Philippine Vice President Sergio Osmeña successfully regained control of the country. Finally, in 1946, the Philippines became an independent nation; and\n\nWhereas, One of the earliest examples of the shared history of these two nations involves Filipinos, living in New Orleans, who joined the war effort against the British during the War of 1812; and\n\nWhereas, Since that time, Filipino-Americans have contributed greatly to the United States with great accomplishments in the fields of education, entrepreneurship, medicine, arts, culinary, sports, government, business, and more; and\n\nWhereas, According to the last census in 2010, there were 3.4 million Americans of Filipino descent. An estimated 1.08 percent of the residents of Sterling Heights, Michigan are Filipino-Americans, more than any other Michigan city; and\n\nWhereas, All Americans can be proud of the historic friendship between the Philippines and the United States; and\n\nWhereas, It is important that we teach our children and future generations important lessons learned through this long lasting relationship and the benefits to be gained from cooperation with all cultures; now, therefore, be it\n\nResolved by the Senate, That the members of this legislative body commemorate July 20, 2019, as Filipino-American Friendship Day; and be it further\n\nResolved, That we recognize this as a special time for Michiganians to celebrate the valuable contributions and longstanding relationship between the Philippines and the United States and express our desire for continued friendship.\n\nThe question being on the adoption of the resolution,\n\nThe resolution was adopted.\n\nSenators Alexander, Ananich, Brinks, Bullock, Hollier, Johnson, Lucido, McCann, McMorrow, Santana, VanderWall and Wojno were named co-sponsors of the resolution.\n\nSenator VanderWall offered the following resolution:\n\nSenate Resolution No. 67.\n\nA resolution to recognize June 30-July 7, 2019, as Aquatic Invasive Species Awareness Week.\n\nWhereas, Michigan and its economy are defined by the Great Lakes and depend on its great abundance of fresh water for manufacturing, tourism, fishing, public water supplies, agriculture, as well as its numerous other uses; and\n\nWhereas, Preventing the introduction of aquatic invasive species ultimately benefits Michigan, and stopping the introduction of these species would eliminate the need for the state, its businesses, industries, and citizens from employing costly methods to control and manage them; and\n\nWhereas, Michigan is protecting the Great Lakes from aquatic invasive species from a number of pathways including ballast water, canals and waterways, organisms in trade, and recreational activities such as boating and angling; and\n\nWhereas, Over 180 nonindigenous aquatic species are established in the Great Lakes basin, many of which are displacing native species, disrupting habitats, and degrading natural, managed, and agricultural landscapes, resulting in millions of dollars for control efforts each year; and\n\nWhereas, Michigan has over 900,000 registered boaters and many other recreational, commercial, and industrial users of over 11,000 inland lakes and over 36,000 miles of rivers and streams in the state, many of which are impacted by aquatic invasive species; and\n\nWhereas, Aquatic invasive species awareness is an important first step toward behavior change, which prevents the introduction and spread of aquatic invasive species; and\n\nWhereas, Spring marks the beginning of water-related recreational activities in Michigan; and\n\nWhereas, Aquatic Invasive Species Awareness Week is an opportunity for our state government to join forces with businesses, industries, environmental groups, community organizations, citizens, and the other Great Lakes states and provinces to take action against the introduction and spread of aquatic invasive species; now, therefore, be it\n\nResolved by the Senate, That the members of this legislative body recognize June 30-July 7, 2019, as Aquatic Invasive Species Awareness Week; and be it further\n\nResolved, That all citizens must increase their understanding and awareness of aquatic invasive species, their environmental and economic impacts, and take preventative measures to stop the spread and introduction of aquatic invasive species; and be it further\n\nResolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy, Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development, Michigan Department of Natural Resources, Michigan Department of Transportation, Great Lakes Fishery Commission, Council of Great Lakes Governors, Michigan Congressional Delegation, and Great Lakes Commission.\n\nThe question being on the adoption of the resolution,\n\nThe resolution was adopted.\n\nSenators Alexander, Ananich, Brinks, Bullock, Geiss, Hollier, Johnson, Lucido, MacDonald, McCann, McMorrow, Polehanki, Santana and Wojno were named co-sponsors of the resolution.\n\nSenator Hertel offered the following resolution:\n\nSenate Resolution No. 68.\n\nA resolution to recognize July 26-28, 2019, as the Michigan Professional Fire Fighters Union and Muscular Dystrophy Associations Fill the Boot Weekend.\n\nWhereas, Members of the Michigan Professional Fire Fighters Union risk their lives every day to serve and protect communities and have become a symbol of pride, honor, and strength throughout Michigan;

They were hoping to speak on the legislation that came out of General Orders today but werent able to speak in committee, so I have testimony from her that Id like to read. Its Lisa Marshke, a proud Air Force mom of a son, Zachary Latoski, who has been serving nine years in the United States Air Force and is currently stationed in Misawa, Japan.\n\nShe would like to thank us for allowing her to come today and support Senate Bill No. 118, which includes the Blue Star Family license plate. This bill would allow for Armed Forces personnel who are currently serving and immediate family members of active military personnel to qualify for the Blue Star Family license plate. Currently, only family members of service men and women who have given their lives for their country are eligible for a Gold Star license plate. The Blue Star Family License Plate would raise awareness and provide visible support for active duty family members who are serving at home or abroad.\n\nAs a strong supporter of our military and our veterans, shes asking that people encourage the movement of this bill forward as a supportive means for active military personnel and their family members. And she thanks us for being able to speak. And I just ask all my colleagues to consider how important Blue Star Families are and how important this recognition this is for them, as too often we only recognize the families of soldiers that are fallen as we did during Memorial Day.\n\nSenator MacDonalds statement is as follows:\n\nToday I rise to speak about my resolution to mark July 20 as Filipino-American Friendship Day. July 2019 marks the 73rd anniversary of the Treaty of Manila which granted the Philippines independence from the United States in 1946 for having worked together to drive Japan out of the country.\n\nPer the last Census in 2010, there were 3.4 million Americans of Filipino descent living in the United States. An estimated 1.08 percent of the residents of Sterling Heights, which is my district, are Filipino-Americans, more than any other Michigan city.\n\nI believe that all Americans should be proud of the historic friendship between the Philippines and the United States. Further, it is important that we teach our children and future generations the important lessons learned through this long and lasting relationship and the benefits that can be gained from cooperation with all cultures.\n\nI ask that we recognize this as a special time for Michiganders to celebrate the valuable contributions and longstanding relationship between the Philippines and the United States of America. I would like to express our gratitude and our desire for a continued friendship for many years to come.\n\nSenator Geiss statement is as follows:\n\nThis morning I rise to address my resolution, which was to recognize June 2019 as Lipedema Awareness Month. Many are unaware that lipedema is a chronic and painful lymphatic disease that occurs almost exclusively in women, and is thought to affect between 10 and 17 million people in our country. Its characterized by bilateral excess asymmetrical fatty tissue that bruises easily, mainly in the hip region, upper and lower leg areas, or upper arms, and its combined with a tendency for leg swelling that worsens when standing.\n\nThe etiology of lipedema and other types of fatty tissue enlargement is still unknown, however, a genetic cause is suspected. Individuals who suffer from lipedema are further impacted by the absence of diagnostic tools, a lack of public and medical awareness of it, and the stigma associated with its physical characteristics. Patients suffering from lipedema cannot simply just shed the additional weight and size through typical extreme weight loss measures, and it is progressive through four stages, meaning that the condition gradually worsens, is degenerative, incredibly painful, disfiguring, and can lead to permanent disability. Certain types of liposuction are the only treatments that can reverse the pain, its disfigurement, and the inability caused by lipedema. Most lipedema patients cannot access this surgery because of its classification as a cosmetic procedure and the costs associated to treat the condition.\n\nSo we want to raise awareness about lipedema, the many people that it affects, and how we can work to expand the education and research of it by the medical community and to spread awareness of it and advocating for the Michiganders who might be suffering in silence.\n\nBy unanimous consent the Senate returned to the order of\n\nMotions and Communications\n\nThe following communications were received and read:\n\nOffice of the Senate Majority Leader\n\nJune 20, 2019\n\nPursuant to Joint Rule 3, the House of Representatives having non-concurred in the Senate substitute (S‑1) to House Bill 4229, I appoint the following members to sit on the conference committee:\n\nSenator Victory\n\nSenator Stamas\n\nSenator McCann\n\nIf you have any questions regarding this matter, please do not hesitate to contact me.\n\nJune 20, 2019\n\nPursuant to Joint Rule 3, the House of Representatives having non-concurred in the Senate substitute (S‑1) to House Bill 4231, I appoint the following members to sit on the conference committee:\n\nSenator Barrett\n\nSenator Stamas\n\nSenator Hollier\n\nIf you have any questions regarding this matter, please do not hesitate to contact me.\n\nJune 20, 2019\n\nPursuant to Joint Rule 3, the House of Representatives having non-concurred in the Senate substitute (S‑1) to House Bill 4232, I appoint the following members to sit on the conference committee:\n\nSenator Schmidt\n\nSenator Stamas\n\nSenator Bayer\n\nIf you have any questions regarding this matter, please do not hesitate to contact me.\n\nJune 20, 2019\n\nPursuant to Joint Rule 3, the House of Representatives having non-concurred in the Senate substitute (S‑1) to House Bill 4236, I appoint the following members to sit on the conference committee:\n\nSenator LaSata\n\nSenator Stamas\n\nSenator Irwin\n\nIf you have any questions regarding this matter, please do not hesitate to contact me.\n\nJune 20, 2019\n\nPursuant to Joint Rule 3, the House of Representatives having non-concurred in the Senate substitute (S‑1) to House Bill 4238, I appoint the following members to sit on the conference committee:\n\nSenator Barrett\n\nSenator Stamas\n\nSenator Hollier\n\nIf you have any questions regarding this matter, please do not hesitate to contact me.\n\nJune 20, 2019\n\nPursuant to Joint Rule 3, the House of Representatives having non-concurred in the Senate substitute (S‑1) to House Bill 4239, I appoint the following members to sit on the conference committee:\n\nSenator Nesbitt\n\nSenator Stamas\n\nSenator Santana\n\nIf you have any questions regarding this matter, please do not hesitate to contact me.\n\nJune 20, 2019\n\nPursuant to Joint Rule 3, the House of Representatives having non-concurred in the Senate substitute (S‑1) to House Bill 4241, I appoint the following members to sit on the conference committee:\n\nSenator Bumstead\n\nSenator Stamas\n\nSenator McCann\n\nIf you have any questions regarding this matter, please do not hesitate to contact me.\n\nJune 20, 2019\n\nPursuant to Joint Rule 3, the House of Representatives having non-concurred in the Senate substitute (S‑1) to House Bill 4242, I appoint the following members to sit on the conference committee:\n\nSenator Schmidt\n\nSenator Stamas\n\nSenator Bayer\n\nIf you have any questions regarding this matter, please do not hesitate to contact me.\n\nSincerely,\n\nMike Shirkey\n\n16th Senate District\n\nSenate Majority Leader\n\nThe communications were referred to the Secretary for record.\n\nSenator MacGregor moved that rule 3.902(a) be suspended to allow the Senate to meet in a space other than the Senate Chamber.\n\nThe motion prevailed, a majority of the members serving voting therefor.\n\nSenator MacGregor moved that when the Senate adjourns today, it stand adjourned until Tuesday, June 25, 2019, at 10:00 a.m.;
