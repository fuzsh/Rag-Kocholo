        "text": "Senator Sergio R. Osmeña III\n\nSenate Office:\n\nRm. 527 & 3 GSIS Bldg., Financial Center, Roxas Blvd., Pasay City\n\nTrunk Lines: (632) 552-6601 to 70 loc. 8526\n\nDirect Line: (632) 551-9999\n\nTelefax No.: (632) 551-9888\n\nEmail: osmena111@yahoo.com, serge_osmena@yahoo.com\n\nWebsite:\n\nEarly life and career\n\nOsmeña was born in Manila to Sergio “Serging” Osmeña, Jr. of Cebu and Lourdes de la Rama of Negros Occidental. He finished his elementary studies at De La Salle College. He studied his secondary studies at the St. Clement’s College in Iloilo, Ateneo de Manila and Beaumont College in Berkshire, England. Although he has never obtained a university degree, he studied in various educational institutions which include University of San Carlos, University of the Philippines, Los Baños, Harvard University, and Georgetown University.\n\nOsmeña held business positions including:\n\nAssistant to President, Essel Incorporated, from 1967 to 1972\n\nAssistant to President, Cebu Autobus Company, from 1967 to 1972\n\nAssistant to President, De La Rama Steamship Co., Inc., from 1966 to 1972\n\nGeneral Manager, LRO (Lourdes de la Rama Osmeña) Farms/ Hacienda Doña Pepang, from 1968 to 1972\n\nChairman,Cebu Contracting Company, from 1968 to 1972\n\nAs a son of Marcos’ political rival, Osmeña was imprisoned in 1972. In November 1974, he embarked on a hunger strike along with his cellmate — ABS-CBN‘s Eugenio “Geny” Lopez, Jr. — to protest the unjust detention of thousands of innocent Filipinos. This resulted in the release of 1,022 political prisoners in December 1974. Defiant to the very end, Osmeña and Lopez escaped from their maximum security prison cell in Fort Bonifacio in 1977. This exploit was enacted in the 1995 movie, Eskapo.\n\nWhile in exile at the United States, Sergio Osmeña served as the Director for Movement for a Free Philippines. He was also the Founding Director of the Justice for Aquino Justice for All (JAJA) Movement.\n\nAfter the removal of Marcos, Osmeña returned to the Philippines and held positions in business and government corporations in the 1990s. These include:\n\nDirector, Pacific CATV, Incorporated, from 1994 to 1995\n\nDirector, Telecommunications Holdings Corporation, from 1994 to 1995\n\nChairman, Intervest Group, from 1994 to 1995\n\nDirector, Micrologic Systems, Incorporated, from 1994 to 1995\n\nDirector, Philippine National Bank from 1992 to 1995\n\nDirector, San Miguel Corporation, from 1993 to 1995\n\nPolitical career\n\nHe served as Secretary General of the Progressive Party cluster NUCD-UMDP from 1991–1992. When it merged with Lakas Tao in 1992, he served as the member of the National Directorate.\n\nIn 1992, Osmena ran for Congressman in Cebu’s Sixth District but lost.\n\nIn 1995, Osmeña was invited by President Fidel Ramos to join in the senatorial race under the Lakas–Laban ticket. He won in the elections and served his term as senator from 1995-2001. During that term he was asked to look for a new site of the Senate after the old Executive Building will be renovated for the National Museum. The Senate offices and session hall were transferred to the GSIS Building at the Financial Center in Pasay City.\n\nIn 1997, Osmeña bolted Lakas NUCD to be an independent senator. In 1998, he joined the Liberal Party. Osmeña succeeded Senator Edgardo J. Angara as Chair of the powerful Committee on Agriculture and Food and the Congressional Oversight Committee on Agricultural and Fisheries Modernization (COCAFM). As Chair, Osmeña tried to block the approval of the construction of the Casecnan and the San Roque dams having discovered gross discrepancies in the costs and benefits of the projects. It was Osmeña who pointed out that the government would be investing a ridiculous amount of more than P385,000 to irrigate an additional hectare of rice paddy. The expose led to the cancellation of the proposed Balog-Balog irrigation project.\n\nIn 2001, Osmeña was one of the senators who voted in favor of opening the second bank envelope for the impeachment case filed against Joseph Estrada. The motion was outnumbered, and it led to the second EDSA People Power Revolution. He ran as independent for the position of Senator under the People Power Coalition. He won in the elections and served his second term as senator from 2001-2007. Right after Senator Aquilino Pimentel Jr. was replaced by Senator Franklin Drilon as Senate President, he joined Pimentel’s party PDP-Laban. His mandate as senator for the second term expired in 2007.\n\nRunning independent again in 2010 (although adopted by the Liberal Party[2] and the Partido ng Masang Pilipino), Osmeña refused to participate in the sorties of his adoptive parties and opted instead to campaign all by himself. He graced radio programs and television interviews. Running on a shoe-string budget, Osmeña did not have the volume of posters and billboards of his opponents. He had television advertisements that to him would be more effective and more prudent to reach the electorate. Osmeña placed tenth and became a senator again for the third time.\n\nAdmiration and criticisms\n\nOsmeña campaigned for justice for victims of toxic wastes at the former U.S. bases in Clark Air Base and Subic Bay. He has extended assistance to victims in the form of hospitalization and financial support. He has earned the respect of many for his exposes on graft and corruption, among others the anomalous IMPSA-CBK, PIATCO, Tiwi-Makban, Marconi and Casecnan contracts, saving billions of pesos for the Filipino people. During his first year in the Philippine Senate in 1995, he was already recognized by the Free Press magazine as “Most Outstanding Freshman Senator” for these exposes.\n\nOsmeña was criticized for being close to the Lopez group. He is less vocal when issues are involved to its line of business which includes MERALCO, Maynilad Water Services, SkyCable, Manila North Tollways, andABS-CBN.\n\nHe was also criticized being a political turncoat. He was initially part of Lakas-NUCD-UMDP in the early 1990s then transferred to the Liberal Party. He then joined the People Power Coalition in early 2001 and transferred to PDP-Laban in late 2001. His grandfather, Sergio Osmeña belongs to the Nacionalista Party while his father Sergio Osmeña Jr. was once a member of the Nacionalista Party but transferred to Liberal Party when he challenged Ferdinand Marcos in the 1969 presidential election.\n\nAligning himself with Benigno “Noynoy” Aquino III, the leading presidential candidate in the 2010 election, he refused to stand beside Ralph Recto whose advocacy on the EVat runs counter to his own.\n\nPersonal life\n\nSerge, as many people call him, is a farmer and businessman by training and was educated at Harvard, Georgetown, and the University of the Philippines. He is married to Isabel “Bettina” Mejia Lopez. He has six children.\n\nSerge came from a family of senators. His grandfather Sergio Sr. served during the American colonial period. His father Sergio Jr. served in the 1960s. His cousin, John Henry served in the Senate from 1971–1972, 1987–1992, 1992–1995 and 1998-2004. His maternal grandfather, Esteban de la Rama of Negros Occidental was also a senator.\n\nHis nephew John Gregory served as Provincial Vice Governor of Cebu and his younger brother Tomas III is the Congressman of Cebu City‘s south district. Tommy was a close ally of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.\n\nHe speaks languages and dialects which include English, Tagalog, Cebuano, and Hiligaynon. He was bestowed Doctor of Laws – Honoris Causa, by the Benguet State University in 2000.\n\nHe is the Chairman of the Aquaworld Corporation, which he held since 1992. While serving his initial term as senator he held a concurrent position as Director of San Miguel Brewery (HK), Ltd.\n\nHe was a member of the Philippine Jaycees, where he served as a senator in 1994. He founded Pundok Sugbuanon while he lived in Los Angeles from 1990 to 1992. He is one of the Directors of the ABS-CBN Bayan Microfinance Foundation, held since 1999, and the Lorenzo Tañada Foundation, held since 1998.\n\nBiography\n\n“Helping the poor escape from poverty.”\n\nOf Cebuano-Negrense-llonggo ancestry, Sen. Serge Osmeña takes pride that his family has had the honor to have contributed three generations of direct ascendants to the Philippine Senate. Both his grandfathers — Sergio Osmeña Sr. and Esteban dela Rama — and his father, Sergio Osmeña Jr., served as senators.\n\nThe senator was elected in 1995 and re-elected in 2001 and 2010. He currently chairs the Committee on Banks, Financial Institutions and Currencies and the Committee on Energy.\n\nSenator Osmeña’s legislative efforts have been focused on measures that would transform Philippine society into one that would be kinder and gentler to all Filipinos, especially those who have less in life. To promote inclusive economic growth and help the poor escape from poverty, more jobs must be created by the economy. To create jobs, his efforts have consistently been focused on lowering the costs of doing business in the Philippines and reducing the bureaucratic logjam.\n\nSenator Osmeña has authored and/or sponsored numerous economic reform measures, such as the new Insurance Code, the new NEA charter, the new Rural Banks Act which allows foreign capital infusion in rural banks, the Anti-Money Laundering law, the Retail Trade Liberalization Act, Government Procurement Act, Securities Regulations Code, and the Electric Power Industry Reform Act.\n\nSenator Osmeña has also earned the reputation of being the Senate’s “fearless fiscalizer.” Known to be fiercely independent, his constituents have witnessed his numerous exposes of graft and corruption, among others the P112 billion spent for imported overpriced steel bridges under the President’s Bridges Program (PBP), the many behest loans granted by the Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP), underpriced SSS-Equitable Bank deal, the PNCC-Radstock scam, IMPSA-CBK, PIATCO-Frapport Terminal 3 scam, Marconi Radar and Casecnan power contracts, saving tens of billions of pesos for the Filipino people.\n\nSen. Serge R. Osmeña III is a farmer and businessman by training and was educated at Harvard College Georgetown University, and the University of the Philippines.\n\nDoubting the Court\n\nMANILA, Philippines – Despite numerous political affiliations, Osmeña takes pride in his independence. But by his own admission, the former Aquino campaign manager sides with the administration on its belief that Corona is partial toward former President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo.\n\nThe longtime senator at one point believed the Chief Justice would resign. He told the Inquirer, “I expect the Chief Justice would probably find himself an excuse and resign, rather than go through the rigors, embarrassment and pain of a public trial.”\n\nHe added, “You cannot win if it’s a political trial. All the stink will come out. Whether true or not, a girl can come forward and say, ‘You raped me.'”\n\nOsmeña also said party lines will not matter in the impeachment trial. With the mix of parties in the Senate, he said it will be difficult to get the numbers to convict Corona. He told the Philippine Star, “Nobody will be able to get the two-thirds vote. Only Manny Pacquiao can get that two-thirds vote.”\n\nYet he added, “Even if [Corona] wins with the other side not getting a two-thirds [vote], he is damaged. How can he continue to serve as Chief Justice?”\n\nAge: 68\n\nEducation: Osmeña does not have a college degree but studied in schools like Harvard University, Georgetown University and the University of the Philippines. He is a farmer and businessman by training. He finished his high school from Beaumont College in England.\n\nSenate work: Chairperson, Committee on Banks, Financial Institutions and Currencies\n\nCurrent term : 2010 to 2016\n\nEligible for reelection? Not in 2013. He may vie for reelection in 2016. He is currently serving the first of a new 2-term cycle. He first served in the Senate in 1995. When his term ended in 2001, he got reelected to another 6-year term which ended in 2007.\n\nPolitical Party: Independent\n\nOsmeña comes from a family of politicians hailing from Cebu. His paternal grandfather, Sergio Sr. was president of the Philippines and former senator. His maternal grandfather, Esteban de la Rama, was also senator. Other senators in the family include his father, Sergio Jr., and cousin, John Henry.\n\nOsmeña’s brother, Tomas, is representative of the second district of Cebu. Rep. Osmeña is a friend of former President Arroyo. He did not sign the impeachment complaint against Chief Justice Renato Corona.\n\nDuring martial law, Osmeña was imprisoned for 5 years. Along with fellow detainee Eugenio “Geny” Lopez Jr, he escaped from a maximum security jail in Fort Bonifacio.\n\nSenate bloc:\n\nOsmeña has been independent at the Senate, even grilling Aquino appointees at the Commission on Appointments. Still, some observers think the senator may side with the LP bloc consisting of Senators Franklin Drilon, Francis Pangilinan, Ralph Recto and Teofisto Guingona III.\n\nRole in the Estrada impeachment trial:\n\nOsmeña was among the senator-judges who voted to open the controversial second envelope allegedly containing incriminating evidence against Estrada. They were overruled, though, in an 11-10 vote. This led to a walkout of prosecutors and the People Power uprising that toppled Estrada.\n\nIn December 2011, he told ABS-CBN News, “Remember, in the impeachment trial of Joseph Estrada, we lost the vote but it was the public who said he was guilty.”\n\nPosition published or aired on Corona or on topics related to the Articles of Impeachment:\n\nEven before Corona’s impeachment, Osmeña defended President Aquino’s criticism of the Supreme Court. While not mentioning Corona, the senator told ABS-CBN News that most justices in the High Court are openly partisan toward Arroyo.\n\nHe said, “You cannot continue tolerating a court until they’re 70 and they’ve been appointed by Gloria. They have been so partial to Gloria that who’s going to stand up for the Filipino people?”\n\nOsmeña said he supports the Aquino administration’s “overall goal to throw out crooks and corrupt people in government.”\n\nHe told the Inquirer, “Gloria Arroyo really abused her power. So, to cover up for all her corruption, she set up a lot of land mines. She put Merceditas Gutierrez in the Office of the Ombudsman, and Renato Corona and some funny guys in the Supreme Court. All of them.”\n\nSources:\n\nhttps://www.senate.gov.ph/senators/sen_bio/osmena_bio.asp\n\nhttp://www.rappler.com/nation/special-coverage/corona-trial/87-cast-of-characters/1194-sen-sergio-serge-r-osme&Atilde;&plusmn;a-iii\n\nPress statements of Sen.
