        "text": "Manuel L. Quezon (born Manuel Luís Quezon y Molina; August 19, 1878 – August 1, 1944) was a Filipino statesman, soldier, and politician who served as president of the Commonwealth of the Philippines from 1935 to 1944. He was the first Filipino to head a government of the entire Philippines (as opposed to the government of previous Philippine states), and is considered to have been the second president of the Philippines, after Emilio Aguinaldo (1899–1901).\n\nDuring his presidency, Quezon tackled the problem of landless peasants in the countryside. His other major decisions include the reorganization of the islands’ military defense, approval of a recommendation for government reorganization, the promotion of settlement and development in Mindanao, dealing with the foreign stranglehold on Philippine trade and commerce, proposals for land reform, and opposing graft and corruption within the government. He established a government-in-exile in the U.S. with the outbreak of the war and the threat of Japanese invasion.\n\nIt was during his exile in the U.S. that he died of tuberculosis at Saranac Lake, New York. He was buried in the Arlington National Cemetery until the end of World War II, when his remains were moved to Manila. His final resting place is the Quezon Memorial Circle.\n\nIn 2015, the Board of the International Raoul Wallenberg Foundation approved a posthumously bestowal of the Wallenberg Medal upon President Quezon and to the people of the Philippines for having reached-out, between 1937 and 1941, to the victims of the Holocaust. President Benigno Aquino III, and María Zeneida Quezon Avanceña, who is 94 years old and the daughter of the former President, were duly informed about this recognition.\n\nIn 1907, he was elected to the first Philippine Assembly – later became the House of Representatives – where he served as majority floor leader and chairman of the committee on rules as well as the chairman also of the committee on appropriations. From 1909 to 1916, he served as one of the Philippines’ two resident commissioners to the U.S. House of Representatives, lobbying for the passage of the Philippine Autonomy Act or Jones Law.\n\nSenate\n\nQuezon returned to Manila in 1916 to be elected into the Philippine Senate as Senator and later elected by his peers as Senate President, serving continuously until 1935 (19 years), becoming the longest serving. He headed the first Independent Mission to the U.S. Congress in 1919 and secured the passage of the Tydings–McDuffie Act in 1934. In 1922, Quezon became the leader of the Nacionalista Party alliance.[5]\n\nPersonal life\n\nPresident Quezon initiated women’s suffrage in the Philippines during the Commonwealth Era.[10] As a result of the prolonged debate between the proponents of women’s suffrage and their opponents, the Constitution finally provided that the issue be resolved by the women themselves in a plebiscite. If no less than 300,000 of them were to affirmatively vote in favor of the grant within two years, it would be deemed granted the country’s women. Complying with this mandate, the government ordered a plebiscite to be held for the purpose on April 3, 1937.\n\nFollowing a rather vigorous campaign, on the day of the plebiscite, the turnout of female voters was impressive. The affirmative votes numbered 447,725, as against 44,307 who opposed the grant.[10]\n\nNational language[edit]\n\nAnother constitutional provision to be implemented by President Quezon’s administration dealt with the question of The Philippines’ national language. Following a year’s study, the Institute of the National Language – established in 1936 – recommended that Tagalog be adopted as the basis for the national language. The proposal was well received, considering that the Director – the first to be appointed – at the time, Jaime C. de Veyra, was an ethnic Visayan.\n\nOn December 1937, Quezon issued a proclamation approving the constitution made by the Institute and declaring that the adoption of the national language would take place two years hence. With the presidential approval, the Institute of National Language started to work on a grammar and dictionary of the language.[10]\n\nCouncil of State[edit]\n\nIn 1938, President Quezon enlarged the composition of the Council of State through Executive Order No. 44.[10] This highest of advisory bodies to the President was henceforth to be composed of the President, the Vice-President, Senate President, House Speaker, Senate President pro tempore, House Speaker pro tempore, Majority Floor leader of both chambers of Congress, former Presidents of the Philippines, and some three to five prominent citizens.[10]\n\n1938 midterm election[edit]\n\nMain article: Philippine legislative election, 1938\n\nThe Elections for the Second National Assembly were held on November 8, 1938, under a new law that allowed block voting[11] which favored the governing Nacionalista Party. As expected, all the 98 seats of the National Assembly went to the Nacionalistas. José Yulo who was Quezon’s Secretary of Justice from 1934 to 1938 was elected Speaker.\n\nThe Second National Assembly embarked on passing legislation strengthening the economy. Unfortunately the cloud of the Second World War loomed over the horizon. Certain laws passed by the First National Assembly were modified or repealed to meet existing realities.[12] A controversial immigration law that set an annual limit of 50 immigrants per country which[13]affected mostly Chinese and Japanese nationals escaping the Sino-Japanese War was passed in 1940. Since the law bordered on foreign relations it required the approval of the U.S. President which was nevertheless obtained. When the result of the 1939 census was published, the National Assembly updated the apportionment of legislative districts, which became the basis for the 1941 elections.\n\n1939 plebiscite[edit]\n\nOn August 7, 1939, the United States Congress enacted a law embodying the recommendations submitted by the Joint Preparatory Commission on Philippine Affairs. Because the new law required an amendment of the Ordinance appended to the Constitution, a plebiscite was held on August 24, 1939. The amendment was carried by 1,339,453 votes against 49,633.[10]\n\nThird official language[edit]\n\nOn April 1, 1940, President Quezon officially authorized the printing and publication of the grammar and dictionary prepared by the Institute of the National Language. Likewise, the Chief Executive decreed that the national language was to be compulsorily taught in all the schools during the forthcoming academic term. For its part, the National Assembly enacted Law No. 570 raising the national language elaborated by the institute to the status of official language of the Philippines, at par with English and Spanish, effective July 4, 1946, upon the establishment of the Philippine Republic.[10]\n\n1940 plebiscite\n\nMain article: Philippine constitutional plebiscites, 1940\n\nCoincident with the local elections for the 1940, another plebiscite was held this time to ratify the proposed amendments to the Constitution regarding the restoration of the bicameral legislature, the presidential term, which was to be fixed at four years with one re-election; and the establishment of an independent Commission on Elections. With the Nacionalista Party, which had proposed said amendment in their convention, working hard under the leadership of its party president, SpeakerJose Yulo, the amendments were overwhelmingly ratified by the electorate. Speaker Yulo and Assemblyman Dominador Tan traveled to the United States to obtain President Franklin D. Roosevelt‘s approval, which was given on December 2, 1940. Two days later President Quezon proclaimed the amendments.\n\n1941 presidential election\n\nMain article: Philippine presidential election, 1941\n\nQuezon had originally been barred by the Philippine constitution from seeking re-election. However, in 1940, constitutional amendments were ratified allowing him to seek re-election for a fresh term ending in 1943. In the 1941 presidential elections, Quezon was re-elected over former Senator Juan Sumulong with nearly 82% of the vote.\n\nSecond term (1941–1944)[edit]\n\nWar Cabinet 1941–1944[edit]\n\nThe outbreak of World War II and the Japanese invasion resulted in periodic and drastic changes to the government structure. Executive Order 390, December 22, 1941 abolished the Department of the Interior and established a new line of succession. Executive Order 396, December 24, 1941 further reorganized and grouped the cabinet, with the functions of Secretary of Justice assigned to the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the Philippines.\n\nOffice Name Term President Manuel L. Quezon 1941–1944 (extended, 1943) Vice President Sergio Osmeña 1941–1944 (extended, 1943) Secretary of Finance José Abad Santos December 30, 1941 – March 26, 1942 Secretary of Justice José Abad Santos March 26, 1942– May 2, 1942 Secretary of Finance, Agriculture, and Commerce Andrés Soriano March 26, 1942 – July 31, 1944 Secretary of National Defense, Public Works, Communications and Labor Basilio Valdes December 23, 1941 – August 1, 1944 Secretary of Public Instruction, Health, and Public Welfare Sergio Osmeña December 24, 1941 – August 1, 1944 Secretary to the President Manuel Roxas December 24, 1941– March 26, 1942 Arturo Rotor June 13, 1942– August 1, 1944 Secretary to the Cabinet Manuel Nieto May 19, 1944 – August 1, 1944 Secretary without Portfolio Andrés Soriano March 2–26, 1942 Treasurer of the Philippines Andrés Soriano February 19, 1942 – March 26, 1942 Manuel Roxas March 26, 1942 – May 8, 1942 Auditor-General Jaime Hernández December 30, 1941 – August 1, 1944 Resident Commissioner of the Philippines to the United States Congress Joaquín Miguel Elizalde December 30, 1941 – August 1, 1944 (given cabinet rank, May, 1942) Secretary of Information and Public Relations Carlos P. Rómulo 1943–1944\n\nSources:\n\nThe Sixth Annual Report of the United States High Commission to the Philippine Island to the President and Congress of the United States, Covering the Fiscal Year July 1, 1941 to June 30, 1942 Washington D.C. October 20, 1942\n\nExecutive Orders of the Commonwealth of the Philippines, Manila, Bureau of Printing 1945\n\nJewish refugees[edit]\n\nIn a notable humanitarian act, Quezon, in cooperation with United States High Commissioner Paul V. McNutt, facilitated the entry into the Philippines of Jewish refugees fleeing fascist regimes in Europe. Quezon was also instrumental in promoting a project to resettle the refugees in Mindanao while taking on critics who were convinced by fascist propaganda that Jewish settlement is a threat to the country.[14]\n\nGovernment-in-exile[edit]\n\nAfter the Japanese invasion of the Philippines during World War II,[15] he evacuated to Corregidor, where he was formally inaugurated for his second term, then theVisayas and Mindanao, and upon the invitation of the US government,[16] was further evacuated to Australia and then to the United States, where he established the Commonwealth government in exile with headquarters in Washington, D.C.. There, he served as a member of the Pacific War Council, signed the declaration of the United Nations against the Axis Powers, and wrote his autobiography (The Good Fight, 1946).[10]\n\nTo carry on the government duties in exile, President Quezon hired the entire floor of one of the wing of the Shoreham Hotel to accommodate his family and his office. On the other hand, the offices of the government were established at the quarters of the Philippine Resident Commissioner, Joaquin Elizalde. The latter was made a member of President’s wartime Cabinet. Others likewise appointed were Brigadier-General Carlos P. Romulo, as Secretary of the Department of Information and Public Relations, and Jaime Hernandez as Auditor General.[10]\n\nOn June 2, 1942, President Quezon addressed the United States House of Representatives, impressing upon them the vital necessity of relieving the Philippine front. Before the Senate, later, the Philippine President reiterated the same message and urged the senators to adopt the slogan “Remember Bataan“. Despite his precarious state of health, President Quezon roamed the States to deliver timely and rousing speeches calculated to keep the Philippine war uppermost in the minds of the American nation.[10]\n\nTalks of post-war Philippines[edit]\n\nOn the occasion of his first birthday celebration in the United States, Manuel Quezon broadcast a radio message to the Philippine residents in Hawaii, who contributed to the celebration by purchasing four million pesos worth of World War IIbonds.[10] Further showing the Philippine government’s cooperation with the war effort, Quezon officially offered the U.S Army a Philippine infantry regiment, which was authorized by the U.S. Department of War to train in California. He also had the Philippine government acquire Elizalde’s yacht, which, renamed Bataan and totally manned by the Philippine officers and crew, was donated to the United States for use in the war.[10]\n\nEarly in November 1942, Quezon held conferences with President Roosevelt to work out a plan for the creation of a joint commission to study the economic conditions of post-war Philippines. Eighteen months later, the United States Congress would pass an Act creating the Philippine Rehabilitation Commission as an outcome of such talks between the two Presidents.[10]\n\nQuezon-Osmeña Impasse[edit]\n\nBy 1943, the Philippine Government-in-exile was faced with a serious crisis.[10]According to the 1935 Constitution, the official term of President Quezon was to expire on December 30, 1943 and Vice-President Sergio Osmeña would automatically succeed him in the Presidency. This eventuality was brought to the attention of President Quezon by Osmeña himself, who wrote the former to this effect. Aside from replying to this letter informing Vice-President Osmeña that it would not be wise and prudent to effect any such change under the circumstances, President Quezon issued a press release along the same line. Osmeña then requested the opinion of U.S. Attorney General Homer Cummings, who upheld Osmeña’s view as more in keeping with the law. Quezon, however, remained adamant. He accordingly sought President Roosevelt’s decision. The latter choose to remain aloof from the controversy, suggesting instead that the Philippine officials themselves solve the impasse.[10]\n\nA cabinet meeting was then convened by President Quezon. Aside from Quezon and Osmeña, others present in this momentous meeting were the resident Commissioner Joaquin Elizalde, Brig. Gen. Carlos P. Romulo, and his cabinet secretaries, Andres Soriano and Jaime Hernandez. Following a spirited discussion, the Cabinet supported Elizalde’s opinion favoring the decision, and announced his plan to retire in California.[10]\n\nAfter the meeting, however, Vice-President Osmeña approached the President and broached his plan to ask the American Congress to suspend the constitutional provisions for presidential succession until after the Philippines should have been liberated. This legal way out was agreeable to President Quezon and the members of his Cabinet. Proper steps were taken to carry out the proposal. Sponsored by Senator Tydings and Congressman Bell, the pertinent Resolution was unanimously approved by the Senate on a voice vote and passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 181 to 107 on November 10, 1943.[10]\n\nDeath[edit]\n\nQuezon suffered from tuberculosis and spent his last years in hospitals, such as at a Miami Beach Army hospital in April, 1944.[17] That summer, he was at a “cure cottage” in Saranac Lake, New York, where he died on August 1, 1944. He was initially buried in Arlington National Cemetery. His body was later carried by the USS Princeton and re-interred in Manila at the Manila North Cemetery on July 17, 1946 before being moved to Quezon City within the monument at the Quezon Memorial Circle on August 19, 1979.[18]\n\nElectoral history[edit]\n\nSummary of the September 16, 1935 Philippine presidential election results Candidates Parties Votes % Manuel L.
