        "text": "The nation owes a great debt of gratitude to the Osmena family for being there, every step of the way, from the conception of our nationhood to its full realization.\n\nThus Senate President Vicente C. Sotto III eulogized former Senator John Henry ‘Sonny’’ R. Osmena who died last month at the age of 86.\n\nOsmena’s urn was placed on a flower-bedecked table at Senate session hall this morning. Senate Minority Leader Franklin M. Drilon and former Senator Nikki Coseteng also delivered their eulogies.\n\nFormer Senate President Manuel ‘’Manny’’ Villar was present during the rites.\n\nA copy of Senate resolution expressing its sorrow and condolence over the demise of Senator Osmena was presented to the Osmena family, led by the late senator’s son, John John.\n\nIn his speech, Sotto said that ‘’there’s always an Osmena casting his lot with the Filipino people along the important chapters of our nation’s history --from the end times of colonialism, to being a U.S. territory, a Commonwealth, up to the birth of the Republic of the Philippines and beyond.’’\n\n‘’And when the going got rough, be it the Japanese Occupation, a presidential election, Martial Law, an assassination or People Power Revolution, an Osmena would be there always for freedom and democracy, suffering the confines of prison or fighting from exile,’’ he stressed.\n\n‘’The Osmeña brand of public service – humility with courage -- began with their patriarch President Sergio Osmeña Sr. of Cebu.\n\nIt was Don Sergio’s humility and patriotism that kept the country united through the Commonwealth period up to the Japanese Occupation and the dawn of our republic. With Gen. Douglas MacArthur and statesman Carlos P. Romulo, he too walked on the waters of Tacloban, Leyte to reclaim the Philippines from the Japanese on October 20, 1944.\n\nAn Osmeña may pass on and physically leave this earthly world, but their significant contributions in building our nation will forever remain,’’ Sotto said.\n\nThe Senate chief said that Senator Sonny Osmeña served as a senator with distinction.\n\n‘’Your legacy will live on in the hearts and minds of the people, and your name will forever be etched in our country’s rich history,’’ he added.\n\nSotto said he had the good fortune of being in the Senate when Senator Sonny Osmeña was also serving as a member thereof, that was in the 9th, 11th and 12th Congresses, the years from 1992 to 1995, and 1998 to 2004.\n\n‘’Coming from a well-known political family, being the grandson of the late President Sergio Osmeña Sr. and a nephew of former Senator Sergio Osmeña Jr., it could be surmised that a lot of pressure were put on him to be able to follow the footsteps of his grandfather, or leave a lasting legacy, like his ancestors did.\n\nBut certainly, that was not the case for Senator Sonny Osmeña.\n\nHe made a name for himself.\n\nHe was a great leader in his own right. A City Councilor, Vice-Mayor, Mayor, Congressman, and a Senator – he became all of these and more,’’ he said.\n\nAccording to Sotto, Senator Sonny Osmeña is famous for development-oriented bills like the Municipal Telephone Act (Republic Act 6849) whereby each municipality will a get a telephone system; the Mini-Hydroelectric Program (RA 7156), which will provide non-conventional electricity in the countryside; the Public Telecommunications Act of 1995 (RA 7925), which revolutionized the country’s information and communications technology, and the creation of the Philippine Postal Corporation (RA 7354).\n\nHe likewise authored the Amended Build-Operate-and-Transfer Law (RA 7718), which is a landmark measure.\n\nHis name is also attached to energy-related laws, such as the Electric Power Crisis Act (RA 7648) and the Electric Power Industry Reform Act of 2000, or EPIRA."
