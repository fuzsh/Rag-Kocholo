Mr. Eyre, who was the author of about a dozen articles in the Naval Institute Proceedings, made a long study of naval and maritime affairs, particularly in the region of the Pacific. Written during the Korean War, this book reveals the history-making conflict between MacArthur and President Franklin Roosevelt during the early days of World War II to Roosevelt's death in 1945. The author stated he was an advisor to President Osmena. Sergio Osmeña Sr. CCLH (9 September 1878 - 19 October 1961) was a Filipino politician who served as the fourth president of the Philippines from 1944 to 1946. He was Vice President under Manuel L. Quezon. Upon Quezon's sudden death in 1944, Osmeña succeeded him at age 65. A founder of the Nacionalista Party, Osmeña was also the first Visayan to become president. Prior to his accession in 1944, Osmeña served as Governor of Cebu from 1906 to 1907, Member and first Speaker of the Philippine House of Representatives from 1907 to 1922, and Senator from the 10th Senatorial District for thirteen years, in which capacity he served as Senate President pro tempore. In 1935, he was nominated to be the running-mate of Senate President Manuel L. Quezon for the presidential election that year. The duo were overwhelmingly re-elected in 1941. Osmeña accompanied U.S. General Douglas MacArthur during the landing of U.S. forces in Leyte on 20 October 1944, starting the liberation of the Philippines during the Second World War. Upon establishing the beachhead, MacArthur immediately transferred authority to Osmeña, the successor of Manuel Quezon, as Philippine Commonwealth president. - The Roosevelt-MacArthur Conflict",
