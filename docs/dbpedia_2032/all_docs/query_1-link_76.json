        "text": "These days, Quezon City’s Matalino Street is a mixed use road, which is quite known for the many restaurants along the 600 meter long road. Matalino Street is part of Barangay Central, named after the area as the center of government of Quezon City; with the development of the Diliman Quadrangle in the 1941, the building of the national government agencies along the Elliptical Road in the 1950s to the 1980s, and the completion of the Quezon City Hall in 1972. However, before all these government developments, the area was first called Barrio Cupang, after the many cupang trees (Tree Bean or Parkia javanica) that grew in the area during the American Occupation of the Philippines.\n\nAfter World War II, the southeast area of Barrio Cupang, and the nearby Barrio Pinyahan, was developed as part of the Homesite residential relocation projects for people displaced by the war. But it was only in the 1960s to the 1970s did the development of residential block begin, with the establishment of Teachers Village, Sikatuna Village, Pinyahan, Central, and UP Village. One of the oldest eating establishments in the area was the Little Quiapo Restaurant, which opened in 1949 along Pres. José Paciano Garcia Laurel Avenue at the nearby University of the Philippines. However the restaurant was moved to the Retiro District, when the Parish of the Holy Sacrifice was constructed and completed in its lot in 1955. It was only by the early 1960s did the Little Quiapo open at the corner of Matalino (intelligent) and Matatag (hardy) streets. The old structure of the Little Quiapo was shaped like a dome, in honor of the iconic Parish of the Holy Sacrifice by National Artist, Leandro Locsin. The newest incarnation of the Little Quiapo Restaurant has been moved to Malakas (strong) Street, around 600 meters away.\n\nThe next oldest establishment along Matalino Street is the Sulô Hotel, which opened in 1967 and is probably the first hotel of Quezon City. The Sulô Hotel served as the billeting facility notable guests of the government who were visiting the Quezon City Hall and other nearby government institutions. In 2009, Ambassador Felimon Roxas Cuevas purchased the hotel and renovated the whole structure and renamed it the Sulô Riviera Hotel.\n\nThe original Sulô Hotel was designed by National Artist Arch. Leandro Valencia Locsin (1928-1994), who drew inspiration from the Moro culture and architecture of southern Philippines, specifically the Tausūg people of the Sulu archipelago.\n\nIn 2000, the owners of the Sulô Hotel wanted to re-emphasize the Moro theme of the hotel, and commissioned me to create nine paintings for their function rooms, to depict Tausūg culture and history, of which I have some familiarity. These are the works I created for the hotel:\n\nAng Sultan ng Sulu\n\nThe Sultan of Sulu\n\nThe Islamic Sultanate of Sulu was founded by Sayyid wal Shareef Abu Bakr ibn Abirin Al Hashmi in 1457, and has grown to cover the Sulu and Tawi-Tawi archipelagos, the island of Basilan, parts of the Zamboanga Peninsula, southern Palawan, and the northern area of Borneo called Sabah during the height of its power. The Sultanate of Sulu rules over the ethnic groups of Jama Mapun, Sama-Badjao, and Yakan, with the Tausūg as the dominant ethnic group. In this artwork, the 29th Sultan of Sulu, Mahomet Jemalal Alam (reigned 1862–1881) is presented wearing a highly ornate badjuh lapih (shirt) with tambuku (gold buttons), a red pis siyabit headdress, and a green kupat (pants).\n\nBai Tausug\n\nA Tausug Woman\n\nThis painting presents a Tausūg maiden wearing her badju biyatawi (blouse) with tambuku (gold buttons), and a bamboo and nipa saruk (hat), as she holds a feathered aper (fan). She stands behind a bamboo jālī screen, with an ukkil floral motif. The Tausūg derive their name from the word Tau (man) and Sūg (current), which means people of the current/ocean.\n\nIgal sa Kasal\n\nThe Wedding Dance\n\nThis painting presents a Tausūg bride and groom dancing (igal) the traditional Pangalay. The bride is wearing a golden filigree tusuk crown and pins, along with the her ornate white biyatawi with golden tambuku buttons, over golden sawal (trousers) and golden weaving patadjung (skirt). The male is wearing a blue lapih (shirt), with a barong (short sword) tucked into his pis siyabbit (belt) and purple kanti (pants). Both dancers wear the white rice-power makeup patterns, called tanyák- tanyák by the neighboring Yakan. Also depicted is a manligay (decorated dowry chest) and a gador (brass ware).\n\nLakbay sa Lupang Hinirang: Ang Sampung Datu\n\nThe Voyage to the Promised Land: The Ten Datus\n\nThe Maragtas tells of the legend of the ten Bornean datus (chieftains) who fled their homeland from the tyrannical Sultan Makatunaw or the Sri-Vijaya Hindu-Malay Empire. The ten were led by Datu Puti and his wife Piangpangan; followed by Datu Sumakwel and his wife Kapinangan, Datu Bangkaya and his wife, Katurong, Datu Paiborong and his wife Pabilaan, Datu Paduhinogan and his wife Tibongsapay, Datu Dumangsol, Datu Libay, Datu Dumangsil, Datu Domalogdog, Datu Balensuela, and their families and people. The ten “tribes” landed in the island of Panay in 1250, where they met the Agta settlers of Sinugbuhan, and made a pact to purchase the lowlands for the king Marikudo and his wife Maniwantiwan. This mythic tale tells of how the Austronesian/Malayan people settled in the Philippine archipelago and made peace with its earlier inhabitants. In the painting, Datu Puti is portrayed on the bow of the balangay (house boat), which is decorated with the floral ukkil carvings, and a colored sail that is reminiscent of the sails of the small vinta (outrigger boats) used by the Sama-Badjao, Tausug and Yakan people.\n\nMga Mandirigma sa Kuta: Ang Huling Laban\n\nThe Warriors at the Fortress: The Last Battle\n\nThe Tausūg have been known as a warrior people, and have known to build kuta (fortresses) wood and stone. In the painting the warriors are depicted in their preparation for the final battle. They wave their war banners, and brandish their weapons such as the lantaka (brass cannon), kampilan (fish-tailed sword), barong (willow leaf sword), kris (wave shaped sword), sangkil (spear) and taming (shields). Should this be the warriors’ last stand, they expect to be called shahid (martyrs), and taken to heaven by the kura sambaleni (winged horses of Allah).\n\nPangako sa Libingan ng mga Bayani: Ang mga Ligtas\n\nA Promise at the Heroes’ Grave: The Survivors\n\nThis painting is based on the after events of March 1906 massacre of Bud Dajó (Mount Dajó) in the island Jolo. During that period, the Americans troops the sprayed the area with machine gun fire and bombed the villages in the extinct volcanic crater, and killed every man, woman and child within the area. Of the 800 to 1,000 inhabitants in the mountain, there were only six male survivors, including one child. Here, the survivors swear to continue the fight against the invaders at the sunduk (grave markers) of their fallen comrades.\n\nPang-Alay: Ang Igal para sa mga Jinn ng Dagat\n\nPang-Alay: The Dance for the Spirits of the Sea\n\nThe Tausūg people are very much bound to the water, whether is it for food, transport, trade, and warfare. As their name signifies that connection to water, so is their most known dance, the pangalay. The pangalay derives its basic movements as if a person is wading through water, and it also shows the influences of the Hindu apsara temple dances. The ritual roots of the pangalay also are seen in the name, pang (for) alay (giving/sacrifice). In the painting, the dancing of the pangalay is portrayed as an offering to the sea and its jinn (spirits). The pangalay is often performed with the dancers wearing metal “claws” called janggay, to extend and exaggerate the movements of the dancers. The pangalay is danced to the rhythmic music of the kulantang (mounted gong set), gabbang (bamboo xylophone), and agung (gong). Also seen on the left hand corner is a luhol (decorated cloth canopy).\n\nSining ng Maranao\n\nThe Arts of the Maranao\n\nThe Maranao are an indigenous Islamic people, found mostly around the shores of the mountain lake, Lake Lanao, in Lanao, Mindanao. Thus their name means “people of the lake”. Their chief city is Marawi City. The art of the Maranao is characterized highly decorated with the “masculine” floral type motif and “feminine” geometric patterns called okir. The floral okir is used to portray the mythical sarimanok, as well as the naga (serpent) motif of the the panolong (wooden house beams) of the torogan (house of nobility). The brassware of the gador (jar) and agong (gong) show the geometric patterns, which can be also seen on langkit and landap weaving patterns of a malong cloth. In the foreground is a Maranao warrior in traditional clothes, carrying a kampilan (sword) and banner.\n\nTaguri\n\nThe Kite\n\nThe taguri is the generic term for kite among the Tausūg people. However, there are different types of taguri based on the size, shape and use of the kites: awak-awak, janggayan, lapak-lapak, mandal, pindun, and tallung. Just like the Malaysian wau kites, the traditional taguri are highly decorated and can be toys for the children and adults to pass the time, a means to settle disputes through kite battles, or used as signals by political and military groups to relay coded messages in the sky.\n\nI am not sure that the new owners of the Sulô Riviera Hotel have kept my artworks on display in the hotel; however it is an honor to have continued with the inspiration of Leandro Locsin and create a new set of works that celebrated the culture of our Moro brethren.\n\nAbout the Architect of the Sulô Hotel:"
