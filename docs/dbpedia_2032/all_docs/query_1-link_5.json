In the Senate, five Nacionalistas, two Liberals, and Senator Lorenzo Tañada of the Nationalist-Citizens Party (NCP) win. Overall, the Senate is split between 11 Nacionalistas and 10 Liberals with the two Progressives and one NCP member in caucus with the opposition. The House is won by the Liberals but will soon thereafter be under the Nacionalistas.\n\nClick here to view a map of the Philippines showing the provincial breakdown of votes. 1/17/1966 0:00:006/17/1969 0:00:006th Congress of the Philippines 1/24/1966 0:00:00Ferdinand E. Marcos' First State of the Nation AddressWe must, for too long have we procrastinated as a people, be never daring to forsake, in the phrase of Rizal, “a humble present for a brilliant future.” But our people cannot wait and they ask us to act and I hear them say, there is no margin for pettiness. There are no reserves for partisan strifes. Our people look to Congress and to the Executive for effective, dedicated leadership for the attainment of greater freedom for all. I therefore call upon you and the rest of the nation join with me in a massive and unrelenting effort to translate these – and expectations into action and accomplishment. For our sur­vival, and beyond it, our progress is in our hands. We cannot look to anybody else. We can expect no help from any other sector. We must look to ourselves alone. Our nation can be great only according to the scale of our own labors, our self-abnegation.\n\nClick here to read President Marcos' First State of the Nation Address 1/23/1967 0:00:00Ferdinand E. Marcos' Second State of the Nation AddressThe year just past shows that our people have this capacity for making the harder choice – which in the end is synonymous with the capacity for great­ness. As for me, I choose to put my faith and trust in our people’s genius to overcome. At the roots of this genius is the gift of courage. Victory seeks not the crave-hearted but the man of burning purpose and indomitable will; as with men, so with nations; as with war, so with the task of peace.\n\nToday, the great epic of national development is working itself out in terms of a thousand acts of courage and faith day after day among our countrymen, and the whole society is the theater of action. Everyone sustains this great effort with his own acts of initiative and courage, which convert latent resources into opportunities for development. The whole nation thus, is involved; and every one is involved according to the measure of his commitment to the future of his country.\n\nClick here to read President Marcos' Second State of the Nation Address. 5/21/1967 0:00:00Massacre of Lapiang Malaya rallyistsThe Lapiang Malaya, composed mostly of Southern Luzon farmers, marches from Taft Avenue to Malacañan Palace to overthrow President Marcos. 33 men die during the confrontation with the police, while the rest are charged with sedition and imprisoned. 11/14/1967 0:00:001967 Midterm ElectionsPresident Marcos’s Nacionalista Party wins the Senate by landslide with six of its bets winning as opposed to only one Liberal, Senator Benigno \"Ninoy\" S.

The challenge of nation-building is first of all a call to character-building.\n\nIt is the business of a free people to develop habits proper to freedom to be purposeful, active, energetic and strong.

His running mate under the Nacionalista banner, Fernando Lopez, wins as Vice President.\n\nAccording to Primitivo Mijares, confidential pressman of President Marcos who will later switch sides and expose the Marcoses, President Marcos overspent public and privately supplied funds for his “win at all costs” reelection campaign. The overspending will result in inflation in 1970, when the exchange rate drops from P3.90 - $1.00, to P6.85 - $1.00.\n\nSource: Primitivo Mijares, The Conjugal Dictatorship of Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos (San Francisco: Union Square Publications, 1976), p. 134. 1/1/1970 0:00:00Enrile calls Efren Plana and Minerva Gonzaga for a feasibility study on martial lawJustice Secretary Juan Ponce Enrile calls Efren Plana, a magna cum laude of the College of Law of the University of the Philippines and member of Enrile’s legal staff in the Department of Justice (DOJ), to help him with the feasibility study on martial law, as instructed by President Marcos.

They are still sore for my veto of their franchise to operate a telephone company anywhere in the Philippines and the [illegible] cable television company that would select programs from any of the television companies to be [illegible] to their subscribers by cable. Both were illegal and unconstitutional but they took offense at the veto. They are the worst oligarchs in the country. I must stop them from using the government for their own purposes.\n\nThis means that just four days after his reelection, President Marcos was already plotting against his running mate. 1970-01-05 00:00:00President Marcos plans to depose House Speaker Jose B.

Laurel Jr.:\n\nBut we will keep him after we have clarified the position they [Laurel and the Congressional Economic Planning Office] have taken on the apparently socialist and communist policies they are favouring under the guise of nationalism.\n\nLaurel is President Marcos’ partymate under the Nacionalista banner. Originally belonging to the Liberal Party, President Marcos switched to the Nacionalista Party and won his first term as president in 1965. The rationale for Laurel’s deposition is that the House Speaker is in a position to oppose the plans of Marcos as Chief Executive.\n\nSource: Amado Doronila, The State, Economic Transformation, and Political Change in the Philippines, 1946-1972 (Singapore: Oxford University Press, 1992), p.129. 1970-01-23 00:00:00President Marcos suspects leader of the Hunters ROTC of planning a coupPresident Marcos writes in his diary that Joe Maristela told him that the Eleuterio Adevoso group is planning a coup d’etat.

As the President and First Lady rush towards their car, the demonstrators throw a cardboard coffin that hits President Marcos in the back. The crowd of protesters (who are trapping Cabinet members, Supreme Court Justices, and foreign ambassadors inside the Legislative Building) is dispersed by Presidential Security, police, and military.\n\nThat night, President Marcos writes in his diary:\n\nAfter the State of the Nation address, which was perhaps my best so far, and we were going down the front stairs, the bottles, placard handles, stones and other missiles started dropping all around us on the driveway to the tune of a “Marcos, Puppet” chant… Some advisors are quietly recommending sterner measures against the Kabataang Makabayan.

According to Marcos, the ambassador assured him that they won’t get in Marcos’ way.\n\nByroade, however, has a different opinion.

Journalist Jose Lacaba reports that this is “so far the most violent night in the city’s postwar history,” as rallyists start fires and destroy property, and a fire truck is rammed into the Palace gate. It is followed by the so called “Battle of Mendiola,” where student protesters face armalite-wielding troops from the Presidential Guard Battalion. The incident leaves two dead and 106 injured. Journalist Kerima Polotan, writes: “‘This is no longer a riot,’ said a police officer. ‘This is an insurrection.’ And the President called it a revolt—‘a revolt by local Maoist Communists.’”\n\nA week after the riot, journalist Jose F.

Marcos Foundation, Inc., through which he pledges to give “all” his material possessions to the Filipino people.\n\nPresident Marcos gives a glimpse of this move in a diary entry dated January 3, 1970:\n\nSome people have asked me why I have given away my earthly possession I [illegible] answered that I did not need them but that the people did. But I have been asking myself why has the world become so vile, so materialistic, so dirty. All is pragmatism, selfish and unedifying. Why is there no more tenderness--all sex? Why is there no more charity--all malice? …Now after the 1965 elections I kept asking myself this--until I decided that giving my properties to the people was the answer.\n\nIn the same editorial, Free Press further comments:\n\nWhy did the President say he would give ALL his worldly possessions to the Filipino people? If he had said he would give some, nobody could have made an issue or a joke of it. Now, no matter how much he gives, it will not be enough.\n\n“Is that all?” the question will be asked by those who do not give or hardly give anything at all.\n\nYet, something is better than nothing, indeed.

Fabian Ver. He writes:\n\n…Today (this morning 11:00 am up to lunch at 2:00 pm) in a conference with Sec. Juan Ponce Enrile, Sec. Alex Melchor and Gen. Yan, I ordered the setting up of a Special War Center, an Internal Security Agency, a Psy-War Branch all under the DND as well as the creation of a new command, the Metropolitan Command, that will cover the provinces of Cavite, Rizal, Bulacan, Bataan, the Pasig Task Force and the PGB under Col. Ver.\n\nI ordered the transfer of Gen. Fidel Ramos from the 3rd Brigade to the 2nd PC Zone Vice Gen. Zosimo Paredes whom I am retiring. Col. Palacios the CO of the 1st Brigade goes to the 3rd Brigade Vice Gen. Ramos.\n\nThe Special War Center personnel may also be placed as a component unit of the command of Col. Ver’s, as Metropolitan Command CO. It integrates all the special forces of the major services, the special forces and rangers of the Army and Constabulary, the air commanders of the Air Force and the Navy’s marines and other teams. They will be retrained under chosen officers for special missions.\n\nAs I plan it, in the event of violence in the city, the Metrocom under Gen. Ordonez will seek to hold back the mass of rioters with his 1,400 men. If they are unequal to the task or special task forces are necessary, the Metropolitan Command comes in. If still unable to contain the violence, then the entire Internal Security Forces under Maj. Gen. Romeo Espino, Vice-Chief of Staff under whom both Gen. Ordonez and Col. Ver will be subordinated comes into the metropolitan area.\n\nIn the meantime outside of the NBI-Metrocom teams that will be fielded, Col. Ver will have special teams to arrest target personnel or take target areas. This will assure performance in the event that NBI and Metrocom are committed prematurely to the routine of maintaining order.\n\nI have ordered the PC and 1st Infantry Division at Fort Magsaysay as well as the 51st Engineer Brigade brought up to full strength.\n\nThe P3 million needed for the procurement of 3,000 Armalites for the PC, I have ordered to be released and the guns delivered not later than the end of February.\n\nThe engineers should be ready to take over the public utilities like Nawasa, Meralco, PLDT, Butel, PNR, PAL, Air Manila, Fairways, land transport as well as shipping.\n\nBut the media which according to Sec. Melchor Ambassador Byroade calls a serious threat to security, calls for a separate operation. We have to take them over immediately.\n\nThe Psy-War Branch should use them for the purposes of the military administration.\n\nThe framework of government and present officials should be kept and all laws except those I suspend kept in force unless changed by edict by me. But a new plan of government and society must be worked out… While private property will be recognized and respected, they should be run for the state. Their profits should go to a fund for investment and development… All able-bodied men must be put to work. There must be total exploitation of natural resources.\n\nThis must be a complete revolution.\n\nSource: William C.

Must 38 million Filipinos be placed—by declaring martial law—under a military dictatorship headed by Ferdinand Marcos?\n\nThe demonstrations held so far in the Philippines against the government and the violence that has marked some of them are nothing compared with the violent expressions of protest in the United States. President Nixon has yet to speak of the possibility of suspending the writ of habeas corpus or imposing martial law on the America people. If he were to do so, is there any doubt he would be impeached and ousted from office? Why does President Marcos keep talking of the possibility of suspending the writ or imposing martial law on us? The solution for the problem of social unrest in the Philippines is not suspension of the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus or the imposition of a military dictatorship on the Filipino people but reform. Regain the confidence of the people. Stop corruption and the waste of the nation’s resources in senseless extravagance. Set a moral example. Be a true President of the Filipino people. Is that too difficult to do?\n\nMust the writ be suspended?\n\nMust there be martial law? 1971-01-25 00:00:00Ferdinand E.

President Marcos insisted that fighting communism is the country's most serious problem. The Liberal Party, however, siezed the moment and charged the Marcos administration of its inability to address key issues of lawlessness, unemployment, and high prices. Despite the electoral rout by the Liberal Party, this translates to modest gains in the 24-seat upper chamber for the opposition, with only nine Liberals as opposed to 15 Nacionalistas.\n\nFor a more detailed account, read the entry for the 1971 Legislative Elections in PCDPSO’s Electoral Alamanac. 1971-12-11 00:00:00President Marcos warns newly elected officials of “communist takeover”President Marcos gives 1,000 newly elected officials a lecture on alleged Communist plans for the rural areas.\n\nThe President explains that subversives have established “rural sanctuaries in the provinces in a move to expand their influence and pave the way for a Communist takeover of the country.”\n\nSource: Primitivo Mijares, The Conjugal Dictatorship of Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos (San Francisco: Union Square Publications, 1976), p. 164. 1971-12-30 00:00:00Defense Secretary Juan Ponce Enrile submits “final draft” of martial law documents to President MarcosBefore he leaves for Hong Kong, Defense Secretary Juan Ponce Enrile visits President Marcos and delivers a large brown envelope to him.\n\nThe brown envelope contains 16 documents for review:\n\n1.

Vice President Fernando Lopez and this report is made in sincere interest to [illegible] maneuver and shape or form to breed distrust between the President and Vice President of the RP. But in fairness to the truth, and facts statements must be made accordingly.\n\nI spoke to him [Angara] on at least 7 telephone calls and he said he had gone down to meet the Vice President Lopez in his home province.\n\nThis is not the first time that the Lopezes have conspired against my life.

Rebeck [Espiritu, Caesar’s brother] tipped me off on a rumor that the Convention would be bombed. He said this could not be mentioned in the Convention Hall because the delegates might panic.

Ramos, PC, Gen. Zagala, PA, Romando, PAF and Commodore Ruiz, PN) Gen. Ver and Gen. Paranis that I intend to declare martial law to liquidate the communist apparatus, reform our government and society, then have the Concon ratify our acts and the people can confirm it by plebiscite and return to constitutional processes; but that I needed at least one year and two months; that this would be a legitimate exercise of my emergency powers under the constitution as clarified by the Habeas Corpus case by the Supreme Court last January; that we need to cure the ills of our society by radical means (I mentioned corruption, tax evasion, criminality, smuggling, lack of discipline, unequal opportunities) so we must keep our moves clean and submerge self-interest.\n\nI asked for any objection to the plan and there was none except for the observation of Gen. Ramos that the closing of the media should be done by a civilian minister supported by the military, and Gen. Gen. Romando who wanted missions definitely assigned to each branch of the service.\n\n1972-09-15 00:00:00Senator Aquino: Oplan Sagittarius was only completed on September 8Senator Ninoy Aquino reports to the media that the planning for Oplan Sagittarius was only completed on September 8.\n\nJovito Salonga, A Journey of Struggle and Hope: The Memoir of Jovito R.

My own interpretation is that he is not about to do it. Perhaps he is fishing for reaction. He's getting all kinds of reactions. The more serious portion of the Aquino diatribe was to reveal that Manila would be placed under PC control. When you come to think of it, Mayor Ramon Bagatsin is almost asking for it. PC control is not the same as martial law. So many cities and provinces are under PC control right now [...] There's no point in denying that the President is ready with a plan on the imposition of martial law if that should become necessary. But that's not the same as saying he will impose martial law tomorrow or the next day or when. Or if at all. To have a plan and to do as planned are "
