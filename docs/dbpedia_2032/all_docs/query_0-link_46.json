Emilio Aguinaldo was a Filipino general and politician who played an instrumental role in the Philippine Revolution against Spain and the subsequent Philippine-American War resisting American occupation. He became the first President of the Philippines at age 29, making him the youngest and longest-lived president. After Spain ceded the Philippines to the US, Aguinaldo established a revolutionary government and declared Philippine independence on June 12, 1898. He later died at age 94 and was honored on the 5-peso bill.",
