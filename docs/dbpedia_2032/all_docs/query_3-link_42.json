        "text": "José P. Laurel (born March 9, 1891, Tanauan, Luzon, Philippines—died November 6, 1959, Manila) was a Filipino lawyer, politician, and jurist, who served as president of the Philippines (1943–45) during the Japanese occupation during World War II.\n\nLaurel was born and raised in a town south of Manila. His father served in the cabinet of Emilio Aguinaldo in the late 1890s. The younger Laurel received a law degree from the University of the Philippines in 1915 and an advanced jurisprudence degree in 1919 before earning a doctorate in civil law from Yale University in the United States in 1920. He entered politics and was elected to the Philippine Senate in 1925, serving there until he was appointed an associate justice of the Supreme Court in 1936.\n\nFollowing the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, Hawaii (December 1941), and the subsequent Japanese assault on the Philippines, Laurel stayed in Manila; President Manuel Quezon had escaped, first to the Bataan Peninsula and then to the United States. Laurel offered his services to the Japanese, and, because of his criticism of U.S. rule of the Philippines, he held a series of high posts in 1942–43, climaxing in his selection as president in 1943. Twice in that year he was shot by Philippine guerrillas, but each time he recovered. In July 1946 he was charged with dozens of counts of treason, but he never stood trial; he shared in a general amnesty declared by President Manuel Roxas in April 1948."
