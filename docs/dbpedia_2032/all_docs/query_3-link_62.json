Not long after the signing of the Treaty of Paris (December 1898), which established the transfer of sovereignty over the Philippines from Spain to the United States, president William McKinley declared that American presence in the archipelago would be temporary. In keeping with this, the United States installed a democratic framework in its territories and laid the foundation...",

        "text": "3Notwithstanding the fact that he is remembered only as a nationalist hero, Manuel Quezon was a shrewd politician. To become president of the Commonwealth in 1935, Quezon had to defeat his political rivals, Sergio Osmeña in particular. At the same time that the Filipino community in the United States was taking shape, Quezon’s relationship with his countrymen on American soil changed. If the young politician sought their support at the beginning of his career, he rapidly learned how to use it for personal, and later political, purposes. But for over three decades, Quezon’s ties to the overseas Filipino community remained strong, because the connection was not simply one between an official representative and his countrymen ‘abroad.’\n\nQuezon Meets the American Filipinos\n\n4At the beginning of the twentieth century, the United States was a power that remained an attractive destination for migrants. Consequently, it absorbed—which is not to say that it welcomed—manpower from its colonies even before the First World War. In the Philippines, the establishment of the American administration coincided with the election of a Congress in 1907. Among the politicians favored by the new colonizer, two young men, Sergio Osmeña of Cebu and Manuel Quezon of Tayabas, stood out. Both were born in 1878 and both were elected to Congress. But the Americans gave Osmeña an advantage, and he was elected Speaker of the House. His rival was elected Majority Floor Leader. As Osmeña had become president of the Nacionalista Party, the main political party, in the previous year, his challenger seemed doomed to remain the eternal number two. But Quezon could not stand to take a back seat. Osmeña, the second highest-ranking official after the governor-general, strengthened his position after the appointment of Cameron Forbes in February 1909, because of their friendship and mutual respect. Aware of his situation, the challenger risked leaving the Philippines to go to the source of power and to reverse the battle of wills, by accepting the position of Resident Commissioner, representative of the Philippine people before the United States Congress, for nearly seven years.\n\nA Special Relationship\n\n5We still know little on the Philippine emigration to the United States, which occurred at about the same time as Quezon’s appointment as Resident Commissioner. The Statistics Office of the Immigration Bureau in the United States Department of Labor provides reliable data on migrants to the mainland. For Hawaii, the Immigration Service and the Bureau of Insular Affairs published reports annually.\n\nFilipinos, Second-Class Citizens\n\n8Quezon’s archives are exceptional in the history of modern colonization in that they present the problems encountered by Filipinos on American soil. So far, there are no similar sources from the French or the British empires. While they were not representative of all American Filipinos—those who wrote to Quezon did so under exceptional conditions—their letters nevertheless give some insights into the Filipino experience of colonization. This source allows the historian to focus on the personal situations of people who were victims of racism, and felt themselves to be second-class citizens.\n\n10At the same time, events turned in Quezon’s favor. When he arrived in the United States, he was not new to politics and quickly learned the intricacies of the American system. He became the perfect lobbyist for the Philippine cause… and his own. The Democrats gained the Lower House in 1911, and the White House in 1913. Shortly after their victory in the House of Representatives, they again launched the debate about the status of the Philippines. Representative William A. Jones submitted a liberal bill, which in reality had been written by Quezon. It made provision to create a Senate and stated that independence would be granted when a “stable government” had been established. It was therefore time for Quezon to return to Manila, to head the new Senate and to appear as the only person capable of running a ‘stable government.’\n\nA Careful Eye on the Community\n\n11Even from the Philippines, the president of the Senate (from 1916 to 1935) kept a close eye on the overseas community. Quezon’s continuing relationship with American Filipinos deserves attention on two points: the institution of the pensionado and the ‘exceptional’ cases that were still brought to his attention.\n\nStudents and Pensionados\n\n17Quezon certainly had ulterior motives when he attempted to help these students. Once in the United States, the brightest and poorest students could find work, but if they decided to settle there, they were a “loss” to the country. American officials were also keenly aware that the Philippines needed competent staff to join the Philippine administration. The BIA was therefore always reluctant to extend stays. But Quezon did intervene from time to time to help students stay on in the United States. In May 1921, he did not hesitate to support Ambrosio Torres, a Philippine pensionado, who asked to stay one more year to continue his studies in engineering. “If in your opinion,” he wrote the head of the BIA, “he is worthy of such privilege, I shall be pleased to suggest that his request be complied with.” One month later, Ambrosio Torres got his extension. Where these sources were concerned, Quezon ran with the hare and hunted with the hounds. On the one hand, he had to please his political and social network. Wealthy families never hesitated to ask him for favors for their sons (the records do not show any requests on behalf of daughters). But, on the other hand, Quezon never forgot that he did not come from this elite. When the former “poor boy of Tayabas” could help an underprivileged or a deserving student, he did. He realized that he would ultimately benefit from these favors, as the deserving young men would be in his debt, and that they would either send money back to their families or later work in the Philippines.\n\nThe Ultimate Appeal\n\n20All things considered, such cases remained exceptional but demonstrate a personal attachment to Quezon, even though the institution of the Resident Commissioner as a welfare agency, which lasted after the implementation of the Commonwealth in 1935, and the establishment of many Filipino clubs seemed to have served as channels for such personal requests.\n\nSo Close and Yet so Far\n\n21In spite of suffering from tuberculosis, Quezon defeated Sergio Osmeña at the beginning of the 1930s. All at once, in the context of the Great Depression, the American administration hastened the process of independence. Both parties, the Philippine elite and the United States, had an interest in coming to an agreement. The Philippines was relatively mildly affected by the Depression. In the mid-1930s, the prospect of independence increased the likelihood of finding a good job in Manila. The Archipelago therefore held some attraction for the American Filipinos. The office of the president of the Senate and of the Commonwealth received letters inquiring about the opportunities back in the Archipelago.\n\n23Marginalized workers wanted to go back as well. In February 1937, M.J. Arciaga affirmed that most of the 20,000 Filipinos on the Pacific Coast had expressed the desire to return to their native land and that 75 percent of this number would have liked to “have vocational training before returning.” While the president of the Salinas community applied for funds to open such a school, it is doubtful whether the Filipinos in question really expected any training. But what is almost certain is that most of them did not want to remain in the United States. The motivations of this segment of the community are difficult to understand, because even if the workers did have the means to return, they might not have returned, because it would have meant a loss of face.\n\nConclusion\n\n26On a different level, this community was an essential component of Philippine nationalism. The experience of living ‘abroad’ enhanced the consciousness of ‘otherness.’ Alone or together, Filipinos became aware of their identity and gave their strong support to Quezon, their patron and nationalist champion."
