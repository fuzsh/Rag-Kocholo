        "text": "My Article in line with Osmeña day 2017 (Pres. Sergio Osmeña Birthday & Commemoration)\n\nSince its Osmeña day today (the birthday of Cebuano President, Sergio Suico Osmeña Sr) I’m writing an article about him but instead of focusing solely on his life, I’m going to write about his similarities with his political tandem and at a point political rival, President Manuel Quezon.\n\nSergio Suico Osmeña and Manuel Quezon were 2 of the most prominent elected statesmen of their time. They’re probably the most similar President and Vice President tandem in our history in terms of achievements, so I’m going to write as many similarities I could remember and know. They may have different personalities or attitudes but they were almost equally brilliant.\n\n18 SIMILARITIES BETWEEN PRES. SERGIO OSMEÑA AND PRES. MANUEL QUEZON\n\nSAME BIRTH YEAR – 1878\n\nOkay let start with the basics, both of them were born on 1878. Sergio Suico Osmeña was born on September 9, 1878 at Cebu City. He is the son of Juana Suico Osmeña and an unknown father, Sergio’s mother was only 14 years old when she gave birth to him. Manuel Quezon was born on August 19, 1878 at Baler, Aurora. He is the son of Spanish mestizo Lucio Quezon and Spanish mestiza Maria Dolores Molina.\n\n2. NOT BORN IN METRO MANILA\n\nEven though both of them would eventually rule the whole country as President in the capital City of Manila, both Sergio and Manuel were born outside Metro Manila. Sergio was born in the city center of Cebu city near the Spanish Period city hall and San Agustin Church which is presently named Basilica Minore del Santo Niño while Manuel was born in Baler in the district of El Príncipe (now Baler, Aurora) which is outside Metro Manila but within Luzon. Being both from the Provinces, this is the main reason why Sergio and Manuel created the Nacionalista Party to counter the Partido Federalista that was headed by Manila-based politicians.\n\n3. MESTIZOS\n\nSergio was a Chinese mestizo with ancestral roots in Parian Cebu, a Chinese mestizo and genteel community in the City of Cebu. Sergio’s Suico and Osmeña ancestor were both Chinese mestizos and were from Parian. Manuel’s father Lucio Quezon and mother Maria Dolores Molina both had Spanish blood, making Manuel a Spanish Mestizo. When you look at Sergio and Manuel’s pictures, their mestizo looks are very evident.\n\n4. BELONGED TO UPPER CLASS FAMILIES\n\nSergio’s family (The Suicos & Osmeñas) belonged to the local Principalia (Local Aristocracy) his grandfather Don Severino Osmeña was a Gobernadorcillo (mayor) of Parian, Cebu and the Gremio de Mestizos (Guild of mestizos). The Osmeña clan of Parian Cebu was among the most prominent and wealthiest clans of Cebu even before Sergio became President.\n\nWhile Manuel belonged to a Spanish mestizo family since both of his parents (as mentioned earlier) were Spanish mestizos, which automatically puts his family at a higher social stratum than the usual native Filipino with no foreign blood (indios) because the people of the Philippines were socially stratified according to their ethnicity during the Spanish colonial era. Manuel’s father, Lucio Quezon was a Sergeant of the Spanish Colonial Army. But the Osmeña clan of Cebu was a far more prominent clan than the Quezons being one of the top families of Visayas and Mindanao combined even before Sergio’s political career.\n\n5. PARTICIPATED IN THE REVOLUTION OF EMILIO AGUINALDO\n\nSergio served Emilio Aguinaldo during the revolution against America as a war courier and journalist because he was studying law at the University of Santo Tomas but I’m not sure whether he was still studying in UST or have graduated already when he covertly joined the revolution at the sidelines. Manuel joined in the front lines of the revolution as an ayudante de campo (aide-de-camp) of General Emilio Aguinaldo. Manuel subsequently got promoted to Major.\n\nJust a brief history trivia in connection with this, Sergio’s lawyer uncle Don Guillermo Osmeña (the half brother of his mother) was a teacher of Andres Bonifacio because Don Guillermo owned a school in Manila. Unknown to many, Andres belonged to a well-off family because his father was a high ranking employee of company but unfortunately both of his parents died of illness when he was only 14, forcing him to work at an early age to support his younger siblings. Andres was one of the few Filipinos of his time to speak English because he had worked in an English company.\n\n6 & 7. STUDIED IN THE SAME COLLEGE AND LAW SCHOOL\n\nCoincidentally, Sergio and Manuel were classmates during college at the Colegio de San Juan de Letran Manila and also went to the same law school at the University of Santo Tomas. That’s 2 more similarities to add in the list.\n\n8,9 & 10. LAWYERS, BAR TOPNOTCHERS AND TOOK THE BAR EXAM AT THE SAME YEAR\n\nBoth Sergio and Manuel took the bar exams in 1903. Sergio placed 2nd with an average score 95.66 while Manuel placed 4th in the bar exams. That’s 3 more similarities to add in the list.\n\n11 & 12. SUCCESSFUL LOCAL POLITICIANS – GOVERNORS – LEADERS OF THE ASSEMBLY ETC.\n\nSergio started his political career in April 23, 1904 when he was appointed acting Governor of Cebu when Governor Juan Climaco (one of Sergio’s political mentors) was sent as a member of the Board of Commissioners of the St. Louis Purchase Expedition in the U.S. After Sergio’s stint as acting Governor, he was appointed Provincial Fiscal of Cebu on July 25, 1904. On February 5, 1906 he was elected Governor of Cebu and subsequently became the Chairman of the first convention of Provincial Governors held in Manila.\n\nHe was also elected as member of the First Philippine Assembly (Present day Congress) on July 30, 1907 and was eventually elected as Speaker of the Philippine Assembly on October 16, 1907 making him the highest Filipino official of our nation during that time, second only to the American Governor General and he was only 29 years old during that time.\n\nAnother history trivia, according to the book Life in the old Parian (By Concepcion Gantuangco Briones) Sergio’s wealthy Uncle Don Tomas Osmeña (the half brother of his mother) played an important role in his career as life coach and mentor and treated him like a son since all his children were girls who eventually became nuns. Don Tomas was one of the wealthiest business owners in Cebu during that time. The present Mayor of Cebu and grandson of Sergio, Tomas Osmeña was probably named after Don Tomas.\n\nManuel Quezon on the other hand started his political career when he was appointed fiscal/treasurer for Mindoro and subsequently Tayabas. He later became a town councilor and was elected Governor of Tayabas (presently Quezon Province) on 1906; the same year Sergio became Governor of Cebu. On 1907 he became an elected member of the First assembly (Present day Congress) still on the same year that Sergio became a member of the Assembly. Manuel subsequently became Majority floor leader of the Assembly.\n\n13. MEMBERS AND LEADERS OF THE NACIONALISTA PARTY\n\nAs stated in an earlier paragraph, these two prominent politicians from the provinces decided to create the Nacionalista party to counter the manila-based party Partido Federalista despite their rivalry of ideas in the Philippine Assembly since they were both leaders of the Assembly with Sergio as the Speaker, the highest position of the Assembly and Manuel was the Majority Floor leader; there were many times when they would argue in a since both of them were brimming with great ideas but sometimes Sergio would just give way to Manuel to pacify the situation and avoid complications.\n\nThere was a time that the Nacionalista party was split into two factions, one faction that supports Sergio Osmeña’s push for the Hare–Hawes–Cutting Independence Bill, the other faction was against it which was headed by Quezon but regardless of this difference in opinions, they reunited again in the 1935 Presidential elections as a candidate President-Vice President tandem which won by a landslide against Emilio Aguinaldo and Bishop Gregorio Aglipay, the founder of the Iglesia Filipina Independiente (Aglipay Church).\n\n14. SENATORS\n\nOn 1922 Sergio was elected Senator representing the 10th Senatorial district of Cebu while Quezon was elected as Senator earlier on 1916 which elections was made possible when the Jones law was passed which replaced the Philippine Commission with a Philippine Senate. Manuel eventually became the Senate President on the same year and Sergio continued to be the speaker of the Assembly until 1922. They were now the 2 highest leaders of the 2 chambers/houses of the Legislative branch of Government with Sergio heading the Assembly chamber or Congress as Speaker of the Assembly (equivalent to House Speaker today) and Manuel heading the Senate chamber as Senate President.\n\n15. WORKED TO MAKE OUR INDEPENDENCE POSSIBLE\n\nOn 1933, then Senator Sergio and House Speaker Manuel Roxas supported the passage of the Hare–Hawes–Cutting Independence Bill through their OsRox (Osmeña-Roxas) mission in the USA. The group of Senators under the influence of Manuel Quezon (which composed majority of the Senate) rejected the Hare–Hawes–Cutting Independence Bill and instead supported the Tydings-McDuffie Act which was an almost verbatim copy Hare–Hawes–Cutting Bill.\n\nAccording to the opinion of some historians, Quezon was not really against the Hare-Hawes bill deep inside but had to oppose it to pave the way to a new and similar bill which was this time, personally overseen by him for publicity purposes to gain more political capital, to outshine Sergio and Manuel Roxas in the process. Nevertheless, Sergio swallowed his pride and supported this endeavor for unity and the achievement of a common goal.\n\n16. HEADS OF THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT\n\nAs mentioned earlier, Sergio was the head of the Assembly chamber as Speaker of the Assembly on 1907, making him the highest Filipino official of our nation during that time, second only to the American Governor General and he was only 29 years old during that time; while Quezon was the Majority Floor leader of the assembly on the same year and subsequently headed the Senate chamber on 1916 as Senate President until 1935.\n\nWhen Sergio was elected Senator on 1922, he was eventually elected Senate President Pro Tempore on the same year which made him the 2nd highest official of the Senate chamber after Senate President Quezon.\n\n17. PRESIDENTS IN THE COMMONWEALTH PERIOD\n\nThis is the most apparent distinction that they have in common, both of them served as the highest official of the Nation as President of the Philippines. On September 18, 1935, Sergio and Manuel was elected Vice President and President of the Philippine Commonwealth respectively and then reelected on November 11, 1941.\n\nDue to the untimely death of Manuel Quezon on August 1, 1944, Sergio rose to the Presidency and took his oath of office as President before the U.S Supreme court associate Justice Robert H. Jackson in Washington D.C because he was in exile due to World War 2.\n\nThe Commonwealth government of the Philippines was restored with proper ceremonies on February 27, 1945 at the Malacañang Palace still with Sergio Osmeña as President of the Philippine Commonwealth which was also attended by General Douglas MacArthur.\n\n18. FACES ON PHILIPPINE PESO BILLS\n\nPres. Sergio is on our 50 peso bill while Pres. Manuel is on the 20 peso bill. Being both very important leaders in Philippine history since they were part of our pioneering Presidents, they will be remembered forever and etched in the annals of our History and in our currency!\n\nEpilogue\n\nThey may have a lot of similarities but their personalities were very different since Sergio was a more humble and selfless person while Quezon had a very cocky personality and at times a selfish attitude. You could read about this in the paragraph that focused on their contributions to our independence. Manuel didn’t support the very first bill on our independence so that he could oversee his own version of the bill which was an almost verbatim copy of the first bill that was developed by Sergio and Manuel Roxas, he made this move for his own selfish interest of gaining Political mileage or capital and to outshine Sergio and Manuel Roxas. Sergio gave way to Manuel for the sake of unity because they had the same objective. And when Manuel was still President, he almost didn’t delegate any powers and responsibilities to his then Vice President Sergio. And even way before Quezon’s death, he already commissioned people to work on his monument and laid out his plans for this in advance, a very egotistical move.\n\nSergio also made a very noble resolve on focusing on the rebuilding of his country rather than his Presidential campaign despite the upcoming 1946 Presidential elections in which he barely campaigned at all.\n\nBut nobody could argue that both of them were brilliant minded Filipinos who contributed much to our country and had the fervor to be very successful in life. Achieving something that only a few Filipinos in history could accomplish, being the highest official/chief executive of a country.\n\nI’m very sure, In spite of Quezon’s competitive traits, he respected Sergio Osmeña a lot even if at times he was his rival in ideas and viewed him as his equal. The same thing can be said of Pres. Sergio, who also mutually respected Pres. Manuel.\n\nCOINCIDENCE IN OUR FAMILY\n\nCoincidentally Sergio and Manuel is the namesake of my great grandfather and grandfather respectively. Not only that, my great grandpa & grandpa had personal ties with father and son Sergio Osmeña Senior and his junior nicknamed Serhing respectively.\n\nThe President and my great grandpa Sergio del Mar (A Clerk of Court) who was only 4 years older than him went to the same school here in Cebu at the Seminario Colegio de San Carlos. Pres. Osmeña studied there from 1889 to 1892 while my great grandpa studied there from 1890 to 1897. They were said to be friends.\n\nWhile my grandpa, Atty. Manuel del mar was also a friend of the President’s son, Sergio Chiong Veloso Osmeña Jr. aka Serhing who was only a year older than him. Serhing probably met my grandpa because of my grandpa’s profession as a lawyer or because of their familial affinity since Serhing’s 1st cousin, Rosario Chiong Veloso married Jose Maria del Mar, a 2nd cousin of my grandpa. Then Governor Serhing Osmeña personally visited the wake of my grandpa at our ancestral house since my grandpa died earlier than Serhing Jr.\n\nThis article is close to my heart because President Sergio Suico Osmeña is a great and noble man that I highly admire being the first Cebuano President of the Philippines. As mentioned earlier, even before becoming President, he was already the highest elected Filipino official of our country when he became the Speaker of the assembly on 1907, second only to the American Governor General of the Philippines, making history as the first elected Filipino National government official of our nation, not only that, he was one of the pioneering Presidents of our country. I’m also fascinated with his ancestral roots in Parian, Cebu because my del Mar and Cui ancestors were also from Parian.\n\nToday (June 17, 2017) is the 100th Birth Anniversary of my grandfather, Atty. Manuel B. del Mar. As the grandson who resembles him the most in terms of looks and being fond of history, it’s only fitting for me to write an blog article about him and his ancestral roots. I don’t always get to greet you but Happy 100th Birthday Grandpa Manuel!\n\nI never met my grandpa because he died a long time ago, even my own dad couldn’t remember him since he died when he was only 5 years old but I would hear interesting stories about him from our old kin. From what I heard, he was an intelligent person who had an unhealthy addiction to the mahjong game. I also heard that he passed the bar exam with flying colors and was said to be one of the top 20 bar passers despite barely studying because he kept playing mahjong. I surmise that he had great memorization skills basing on the testimonies that I heard.\n\nI use to have an obscure knowledge about his life, so I did some research to fill the void of knowledge and I discovered a lot of interesting info which I will discuss in the detailed article below.\n\nWHO IS ATTY. MANUEL B. DEL MAR?\n\nThe son of Sergio Ruiz del Mar, a Clerk of court genealogically rooted from Parian district of Cebu. Atty. Manuel Bascon del Mar was fondly called “Maning” by his kin and was apparently a lawyer and a World War 2 veteran with the rank of Sergeant of the E company 43rd Inf. who was born on June 17, 1917. He fought the war in the mountains of Toledo at Camp no. 11 where he was captured and tortured by the Japanese forces; fortunately he survived the ordeal by convincing the enemy troops that he should be spared with the help of his persuasion skills which will be useful in his law practice. Maning finished his law studies at the University of Visayas (Main Branch in Colon) which was near his home in Brgy. Tinago and passed the bar exams on March 28, 1949 and was said to be part of the Top 20 bar passers. During his studies, he was said to be a consistent honor student and excelled in writing and speaking.\n\nWhen he was a practicing lawyer, he frequently assisted jeepney operators in acquiring franchises from government offices in Manila because our local LTFRB offices didn’t existed in the 50’s. He would procure their documents and do the legal processes involved, making it possible for more Jeepneys to roam Cebu and for more people to access this affordable means of transportation. He also occasionally goes to Mindanao to represent his clients there and was said to have won most of the cases that he handled. Aside from being a private lawyer, he was also the resident lawyer of the family, assisting his siblings, aunt and uncles with their legal concerns, some of them concerning their land properties.\n\nManing was also an active and respected community leader in their neighborhood in Bagumbayan, Brgy. Tinago, Cebu City. He organized important events and activities in their neighborhood with the help of his witty 1st cousin, Jose Bascon Delfin CPA, a successful accountant.\n\nIn June 1, 1946 at the age of 28, Maning married my grandma Milagros N. Cui who was also his neighbor. Milagros is a scion of the prominent Cui clan of Parian. She is the daughter of businessman Don Mamerto Almario Cui Sr. and Spanish-Chinese mestiza Doña Dolores Sindiong Natividad, who was also a business owner and a descendant of the Duterte clan and cousin of Atty. Vicente Duterte, the father of Pres. Duterte.\n\nAt one basketball league in 1936 Maning’s father-in-law, Don Mamerto sponsored a team participated by the athletic brothers of Maning: Restituto, Isidro and Emigdio, all of them are known Basketball players in Cebu. The basketball team was named Botika Asia (Asia Pharmacy) named after the Pharmacy owned by Don Mamerto which was also co-owned by Don Go Lam (founder of IPI) and Dr. Jose Castillo. The Pharmacy was one of the best and most famous Pharmacy of its time which was located in Magallanes street, Cebu City, the old business hub of Cebu.\n\nPolitical ambition and untimely death\n\nAccording to the accounts of his surviving sister-in-law who is almost a 100 years old, he had plans to pursue politics as a city councilor of Cebu City to follow in the footsteps of his much older 2nd cousins Filomeno, Graciano and Jose Maria del Mar who were former councilors of Cebu City but this ambition never happened because of his untimely death in March 12, 1955 due to a complication of a stomach ulcer (Peritonitis due to ruptured duodena) despite a successful surgical operation at Southern Islands hospital (present day Vicente Sotto hospital). He was only alive for a couple of days (4 – 7 days), leaving behind 5 young children: Fortunato aka Porting, Antonio aka Tony, Lilia, Mario and Estrella aka Inday Estrella. The complication was said to occur when he drank water at his residence in house no. 6 in corner Mabini and Sikatuna Street. The doctor prohibited him from drinking water but he did not follow. He was only allowed to wet his lips with damp cotton whenever he was thirsty and I theorize that he was also not allowed to eat solid food.\n\nHe contracted his severe ulcers from regularly playing mahjong until dawn without eating. His prominent friend Governor Sergio “Serging” Osmeña Jr., Who would later become Senator was among his high profile visitors in his wake at our ancestral house in Barangay Tinago. The Governor was said to bring with him a family tree chart that showed the familial connections of the Osmeña clan to the del Mar clan. Serging’s father, President Sergio Suico Osmeña Sr. was a schoolmate and friend of Maning’s own father, his namesake Sergio Ruiz del Mar at the Seminario-Colegio de San Carlos. Sergio del Mar’s much older 1st cousin, Don Santos Rosales del Mar was also a family friend of Pres. Osmeña and a relative of his 1st wife Doña Estefania Rosales Chiong Veloso.\n\nATTY.

Manuel B. del Mar’s (aka Maning) ancestry can be traced to the genteel district of Parian which in the old times was a small town and community of Chinese mestizo clans who were the influential, affluent leaders and business owners of Cebu in the 1800’s who enjoyed the Honorary Hidalgo titles of Don and Doña. The most prominent Parian clan up to this day is the Osmeña clan which has produced a Philippine President, President Sergio Suico Osmeña Sr. Sergio, the grandson of the influential Parian Gobernadorcillo (Mayor) Don Severino Agaton Osmeña. The 2nd most prominent Parian clan is the Veloso Clan. President Rodrigo Duterte is a scion of both the Veloso and Duterte Clan of Parian. An intermarriage between the 2 most prominent Parian Clans, the Osmeña and Veloso happened with the marriage of Edilberto Osmeña (The son of Pres. Osmeña) and Guadalupe Veloso, the daughter of Don Mariano Veloso who was one of the richest persons in Cebu. The Parian town or government district used to span from the present day Parian barangay to present day barangays Day-as, Zapatera, and Tinago.\n\nI will discuss in comprehensive detail the interesting family tree and prominent relatives of my grandpa below.\n\nThe prominent relatives of Atty. Manuel del Mar\n\nManing is the son of Sergio Ruiz del Mar (1874-1961), a Clerk of court of the Court of First Instance (Presently the Regional Trial Court) and Carlota Bascon (1885-1935) a tailor who probably had ancestral roots in Talisay. Not long ago I found out from American Historian Dr. Michael Cullinane Ph.D that Maning’s grandparents and parents of Sergio were prominent people of the Parian town. Maning’s grandpa, Cabeza de Barangay Don Francisco Sarmiento del Mar (1833-1889)and grandma Doña Brigida Codilla Ruiz. Don Francisco was a Barangay chief and a Principal or member of Cebu’s Aristocracy.\n\nSergio’s much older brother, Isaac del Mar was the only sibling who was able to inherit the occupation of their father for he briefly became a Cabeza de Barangay in 1892. Isaac was somehow linked to the famed revolution General Arcadio Maxilom because he attended a political meeting headed by him in May 1899.\n\nDon Francisco’s father Don Fabian del Mar was also a principal like him but not an ordinary one for he is among the most prominent and wealthiest Cebuano of his time. Don Francisco’s mother Doña Celina Leoncia Sarmiento is also as affluent as his husband Don Fabian being part of the prominent Sarmiento Clan of Parian and Carcar, Celina Leoncia’s family owned very large hacienda estates in Carcar which made them the richest family in Carcar and one of the richest in Cebu City and Cebu Province in the 1840’s. Doña Leoncia’s brother, Don Roman Sarmiento was a former mayor of Carcar.\n\nManing’s grandma was just like her husband because Doña Brigida was also a scion of 2 esteemed families, the Ruiz and Codilla clans of Parian. She is the niece & heir of Padre Don Patricio Codilla who was a very influential priest from Parian in the 1830s.\n\nThe Prominent Sarmiento relatives.\n\nJust like the del Mar, Ruiz and Codilla Chinese mestizo clans, the Sarmientos also originated in the Chinese mestizo community of Parian and were also classified as Chinese mestizos.\n\nDon Francisco’s uncle (brother of his mother) Don Roman Sarmiento was the first non-native Mayor (Gobernadorcillo) of Carcar in the 1840s since he was from Parian. Another of the clan’s distinguished members were Padre Don Mariano Pono Sarmiento, a high ranking priest and the much younger 1st cousin of Don Francisco who was born on 1851. Padre Don Mariano was an award winning priest and Vicar Foraneo of the old Southern 3rd district of Cebu.\n\nThe other brothers of Padre Don Mariano were also influential figures in their careers: Don Isabelo P. Sarmiento was a high ranking official (principales) of the gremio de mestizos (Chinese mestizo tax group) and another sibling and priest, Padre Don Ruperto P. Sarmiento was a celebrated and beloved parish priest of Dalaguete town who created the roads that link Dalaguete to the vegetable basket of Cebu and mountain barangay of Mantalongon which is a very important achievement because it made the selling and exporting of vegetables to the rest of Cebu easier, contributing to the economy and food security of Cebu. They are sons of Ciriaco Sarmiento and Martina Pono who is also of respected pedigree. Ciriaco is another brother of Don Francisco del Mar’s mother.\n\nWho is Don Roque Rosales del Mar?\n\nAnother prominent relative was Don Roque Rosales del Mar who was a politician, businessman and the much older first cousin of Maning’s father Sergio. Don Roque was a high ranking government official of Cebu City and the most politically successful del mar in the Spanish period who held the positions Regidores (City Council) in charge of district no. 2, then got promoted to Segundo Teniente (2nd Lieutenant) the 2nd highest post available to a Filipino in the City.\n\nDon Roque was also a former Gobernadorcillo (Mayor) of the Parian town and the gremio de mestizos (Chinese mestizos tax group). He also started as a Cabeza in his political career.\n\nHe served the city government with other renowned personalities like Don Victoriano Osmeña who is the uncle of Pres. Sergio Suico Osmeña, Don Pedro Cui who is the wealthiest Cebuano at that time, Don Arsenio Climaco who would later become Governor of Cebu and other members of the prominent families like the Velez, Veloso and Sanson-Camara.\n\nWhen the Spaniards left Cebu in December 1898, the management of Cebu City was temporarily & briefly turned over to Don Roque and his illustrious colleagues Don Miguel Logarta (one of the Teachers of Pres. Sergio Osmeña) and Don Pablo Mejia since they were part of the top government officials of their time, until the Americans took over.\n\nDon Roque was born on ca. 1851 and is the son of Cabeza de Barangay & Principal Don Jacinto Sarmiento del Mar who is the older brother of Don Francisco.\n\nAnother brother of Don Francisco by the name of Don Claros del Mar and Don Roque’s brother, Don Santos del Mar were also part of the Principales and important officials of the mestizos tax group, gremio mestizos. It is interesting to note that our first President, Emilio Aguinaldo started also as a Cabeza de Barangay like Don Fabian, Francisco, Jacinto, Claros, Roque and Santos. An incumbent Mandanue City Councilor by the name of Jun Cortes del Mar is a great great grandson of Don Roque.\n\nDon Roque’s kind gesture to his uncle Don Francisco.\n\nDon Roque was very kind to assist in the legal processes of the last will testament of his uncle Don Francisco even if he wasn’t an heir; making it possible for his much younger cousin Sergio, Sergio’s siblings, Francisco’s wife Doña Brigida and other relatives to inherit properties (in Parian, Banilad and Mandanue), money and other possessions after Don Francisco’s death in September 22, 1889 caused by beri beri at the age of 57.\n\nIt was found out on the death bed of Don Francisco that he had a son out of wedlock in Opon (Lapu Lapu) to a woman name Gregoria. This means that my great grandpa Sergio had a half brother in Lapu Lapu. This unnamed son was included in his heirs but had a way smaller financial share than his legitimate siblings.\n\nOne of the last acts of kindness of Don Francisco as a public servant in the same year before being stricken with illness was organizing an effort to stop cholera and hunger of the residents of the Likod district of Parian with the help of an organization of kind hearted and prominent Cebuanos where he was a board member. Truly, it was in his heart to serve the public. His grandson, Atty. Manuel del Mar was coincidentally trying to follow in his footsteps, and the footsteps of his uncle Don Roque who died in 1913, a couple of years earlier than Manuel’s birth in 1917.\n\nAtty. Manuel’s Marriage (A slightly different paragraph from the upper article)\n\nIn June 1, 1946 at the age of 28, Maning married his neighbor and grandma Milagros N. Cui who was a scion of the prominent Cui clan of Parian. Milagros is the daughter of businessman Don Mamerto Almario Cui Sr. and Spanish-Chinese mestiza Doña Dolores Sindiong Natividad, who was also a business owner and a descendant of the Duterte clan and cousin of Atty. Vicente Duterte, the father of Pres. Duterte.\n\nDon Mamerto was one of the owners of Botika Asia, the best Pharmacy in Cebu during that time which was also owned by his business partners Don Go Lam (founder of IPI) and Dr. Jose Castillo. Doña Dolores was in charge of their apartments and houses for rent business.\n\nManing was not the only del Mar descendant to marry a Cui, his 2nd cousin Rafael Kabalikan, a successful businessman married Modesta Cui. Rafael is the son of Don Roque del Mar out of wedlock.\n\nAt present, Atty. Manuel’s children and grandchildren are successful professionals here and abroad in different fields of expertise which encompasses the fields of Advertising, Education, Accounting, Aviation, Banking, Events and Fashion, Public service, Information Technology, Management, Media, Medicine, Catholicism.\n\nThe del Mars of the present might be a far cry from the almost forgotten prestige and prominence that they use to enjoy in the very old times (Spanish Colonial period) but some clan members of the present still continue the legacy of their forefathers long ago in the present local & national government and other international & local professional fields so that the torch of the clan may continue burning bright through the years and generations to come.\n\nThis is the direct ancestral line of Atty. Manuel B. del Mar\n\nChinese mestizo Don Juan Bruno del Mar (ca. 1780’s – 1866) – Maria de los Santos\n\nDon Fabian Antonio del Mar (ca. 1803 – 1866) – Doña Celina Leoncia Sarmiento (Daughter of Antonio Sarmiento & Dorotea Santa Maria)\n\nDon Francisco Fausto S. del Mar (ca. 1833-1889) – Doña Brigida Codilla Ruiz (Daughter of Maximo Ruiz & Fulgencia Codilla)\n\nSergio R. del Mar (1873-1961) – Carlota Bascon (1889 – 1935).\n\nAtty. Manuel B. del Mar (1917-1955) – Milagros N. Cui (1925-2010) (Daughter of Don Mamerto Cui & Doña Dolores Sindiong Natividad)\n\nEpilogue\n\nA new life after 100 years\n\nJust days ago my nephew, Herb S. del Mar (the son of my 1st cousin Alex del Mar) celebrated his 1st birthday on June 11, the day before Independence Day. The children’s party had an Independence Day theme. The coincidental closeness with the birthday of my grandpa made me think that my nephew is somewhat a 4th generation reincarnate of my grandfather.\n\nWe may lose our beloved ancestors but their genes and lives lives on through us, the descendants. When a life ends, a new one is made which passes on the genes to the next generation and continues the hopes and ambitions of the ones that came before them which in a way continue their life. Who we are and what we are, are shaped by the morals and values passed on by the many generations before us. We might have traits similar to an ancestor 7 generations back if this trait was successfully passed on through the generations.\n\nBeing fond of history, it would have been nice having long conversations with my grandpa Maning about politics and history (since he was born in a way earlier time) if he was still alive. People may have forgotten you, but one grandson still remembers you.\n\nI neither met my paternal or maternal grandpa because both of my parents grew without them. By the way, whether you believe it or not, my maternal grandpa was an American WW2 soldier making me 25% American or ¼ American but it doesn’t show in my looks because my Chinese roots are more evident.\n\nMAIN PHOTO CAPTION\n\nUpper left photo: 1945 cropped photo of Atty. Manuel B. del Mar from a family portrait of Sergio and children taken in a reunion in Tejero public school after the end of World War 2; was probably an evacuation area during WW2. Atty. Manuel’s younger sister, Josefina del Mar was teacher in the said school. She got promoted to principal years later.\n\nLower left photo: 1951 cropped photo of Atty. Manuel B. del Mar from a family portrait of the Cuis shot at Silver Studio located somewhere in the downtown area of Cebu City. Manuel was the only in-law in the family portrait since his wife Milagros Cui was one of the first to get married of the siblings.\n\nYoung photos of me at the right side: Choose these younger photos because I was skinnier back then and it made look more like my grandpa Manuel.\n\nSOURCES\n\nAtty.
