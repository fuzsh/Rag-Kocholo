        "text": "DAR OPINION NO. 12-00\n\nHONORABLE SERGIO OSMEÃ‘A III\n\nSenator, Philippine Senate\n\nGSIS Building, Roxas Boulevard\n\nPasay City\n\nS i r :\n\nThis refers to the letter of Mr. Henry Avila dated 10 February 2000, which purports to have been addressed to your, honorable Office, regarding paragraph II.A of DAR Administrative Order No. 11, series of 1990 (Rules and Procedures Governing the Exercise of Retention Rights by Landowners and Award to Children Under Section 6 of R.A. No. 6657).\n\nIn this letter, Mr. Avila stated that \"the agrarian people interprets paragraph II.A to mean that the child to be entitled to the award of three (3) hectares must be actually tilling the land\", which would only mean that the child is not awarded as sibling of the landowner but as tenant. In reaction thereto, Mr. Avila has the following proposals, quote:\n\n\"1. A landowner may retain an area of not more than five (5) hectares.\n\n2. In addition, each child be awarded an area of not more than three (3) hectares.\n\n3. Should the area retained by the landowner and/or awarded to each child is tenanted same shall be covered by a leasehold contract.\"\n\nThe provision in Section 6 of R.A. No. 6657 on the award to children was intended to give preference to children of landowners who are qualified beneficiaries as can be deduced from the pertinent minutes of the meeting of the Joint Conference Committee on CARP dated 13 May 1988, quoted as follows:\n\n\"THE CHAIRMAN. (Sen. Alvarez). Can we restate this range, which is being taken into consideration now? If I may, from the gist of the discussion, there are two parts of this range. First, there is a retention limit for landowners, which we have not yet reached. Then we will take into account the heirs as tillers-beneficiaries. But the question was raised by Senator Enrile are they going to be preferred beneficiaries or ordinary beneficiaries in the course of distribution?\n\nSEN. ENRILE. I will narrow down, Mr. Chairman, my definition.\n\nTHE CHAIRMAN (Sen. Alvarez). Okay.\n\nSEN. ENRILE. Are we going to limit them as beneficiaries/heirs to the land of their parent and nothing more?\n\nVOICES. That's fair enough, fair enough.\n\nTHE CHAIRMAN. (Sen. Alvarez). Are you making categorical suggestion or you are just raising the issue, Mr. Senator?\n\nSENATOR ENRILE. I would suggest that we limit them to the . . .\n\nTHE CHAIRMAN. ( Sen. Alvarez). As heir-beneficiaries-tillers . . .\n\nSEN. ENRILE. . . . of the property of their parents.\n\nTHE CHAIRMAN (Sen. Alvarez). Preferred only in the properties of their parents.\n\nSEN. ENRILE. Yes.\n\nTHE CHAIRMAN. (Sen. Alvarez). Okay.\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\nSEN. GONZALES. I mean, linawin lamang natin iyong heir-beneficiary, ano, because the way I understand it, from the viewpoint of the House, an Heir would be qualified beneficiary. First, when he is actually tilling the land; second, when although he is not actually tilling the land, he has an intention to do so; and, thirdly he is not actually tilling the land but may do so by means of labor administration.\n\nNow, I don't think that this concept is acceptable to the Senate. From my point of view, I am personally opposed to that. I would limit it to the heir who is actually cultivating or tilling the land. . . .\n\nREP. CHAVES. . . . when I voted for the amendment of Congressman Antonio of giving three (3) hectares for every heir, one of my reasons for voting for that amendment is because the original proposal of the House under House Bill 400 was that to give seven (7) hectares as retention and another seven (7) hectares for one heir who is of legal age.\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\nSEN. GONZALES. Sa Land Reform, ang basis nito ay hindi 'yong property right. Actually, this is a social justice measure ang intention ko kaya nga natin ina-accept 'yong heir, because I don't want them to be discriminated against for the simple reason that he is an heir because to me, that is a reverse discrimination if he is actually cultivating the land.\"\n\nWithin the context of the foregoing and by express provision of law (1st paragraph, Section 6, R.A. No. 6657), it is clear that in order for the landowner's child to be awarded an area of not more than three (3) hectares, the child must be at least fifteen (15) years of age, and (2) that he is actually tilling the land or directly managing the farm.\n\nAs regards the third proposal, an award to a qualified child may not be the subject of a leasehold contract considering that R.A. No. 6657 requires that said child-awardee should either be actually tilling the land or directly managing the farm.\n\nWe are only implementing what the law has prescribed that any departure therefrom will in effect be legislating, a matter that is beyond our competence.\n\nThank you.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(SGD.) FEDERICO A. POBLETE\n\nUndersecretary for Legal Affairs and Policy and Planning"
