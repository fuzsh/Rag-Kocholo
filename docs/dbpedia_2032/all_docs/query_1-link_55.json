        "text": "In this page, I've listed all the presidents of the Philippines from the first to the present time (2013) and compiled some of their notable achievements. This list starts from the ratification of the Philippine Constitution in the First Republic – after the independence of the country in 1898. Thus, this list starts from the ratification of 1899 constitution where Emilio Aguinaldo was the president of the Republic of the Philippines. The dates followed by their names are the dates of their terms.\n\nThis paper will explore the political terrain leading to the 2010 presidential election. It seeks to understand the nature of presidential campaigns in post-authoritarian Philippines. Utilizing survey data, it will trace trends that reflect continuity and change in Filipino voting behavior. Moreover, it will apply the analytical tools of political marketing, such as market segmentation and candidate positioning, in identifying the key elements that contributed to a successful presidential campaign in the three most recent electoral cycles. The paper notes that electoral campaigns in the post-authoritarian period have been waged with competing narratives of reformism, populism and clientelism. The tradition of Filipino-style reformist politics has been revived in the issue-based anti-corruption and good governance campaigns. Meanwhile, continued clientelism and money politics have manifested themselves in the machine-based campaigns that have eroded the gains of reformism. The failure of reform politics to address the problem of poverty, coupled by the ascendancy of the mass media, has fueled the image-based populist campaigns. Ultimately, the rise of media and public opinion polling as influential conduits between national candidates and the electorate underscores the need to find the right mix and astute use of image, issues and machinery.\n\nThe elections tested and consolidated Duterte’s political strength as the country’s populist strongman president: most of the national and local candidates endorsed by Duterte won their contests for the 18,066 national and local positions up for grabs. Initial election results point to a victory for the administration’s nine senatorial candidates (out of 12 seats) and a majority of its governors, mayors, and local legislators."
