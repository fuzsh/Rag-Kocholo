        "text": "(UPDATE) THE Senate and the House of Representatives begin canvassing the votes for president and vice president today, May 24, and the winners are expected to be proclaimed tomorrow.\n\nOn the cusp of being proclaimed as the country's 17th president is former senator Ferdinand \"Bongbong\" Marcos Jr., who will assume the position his father and namesake was elected to in 1965.\n\nExpected to be proclaimed as vice president is Marcos' running mate, Davao City Mayor Sara Duterte-Carpio.\n\nConvening as the National Board of Canvassers (NBOC), the Senate and House are assigned the task of tallying the votes and proclaiming the winners.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Juan Miguel \"Migz\" Zubiri said in a press briefing on Monday the canvassing starts at 10 a.m. If the NBOC does not finish the count by 10 p.m., it will resume at 10 a.m. the following day until all certificates of canvass (COCs) are tallied.\n\n\"We are looking at two days. We don't really see too many problems that may arise [during the canvassing],\" Zubiri said.\n\nHe said the canvassers might spend no more than 5 minutes on a COC, so he expects the process to be quick.\n\n\"But we will entertain all objections. We will answer them. [However,] if we can finish it in two days, I will be very appreciative of that,\" Zubiri said.\n\nHe said the canvassing has to be finished as soon as possible because there are other important matters the Senate has to attend to before it adjourns sine die on June 3.\n\nHe said Marcos and Duterte-Carpio have been advised to attend the canvassing so they could be proclaimed promptly.\n\nThe Senate contingent to the NBOC is made up of Senate President Pro Tempore Ralph Recto, Senate Minority Leader Franklin Drilon and senators are Maria Lourdes Nancy Binay, Pilar Juliana \"Pia\" Cayetano, Maria Imelda Josefa \"Imee\" Marcos, Mary Grace Poe and Zubiri.\n\nOn Monday, the Senate adopted Senate Concurrent Resolution 18 which directs Congress to hold a joint session for the canvassing and the proclamation of the new president and vice president.\n\nThe COCs and accompanying election returns, which by law have to be transmitted first to the Senate, were transferred on Sunday night to the House's plenary hall at Batasang Pambansa, Quezon City, in 11 military armored trucks escorted by two armored personnel carriers.\n\nThe Senate has received 156 or 90.17 percent of the total 173 COCs.\n\nThe remaining certificates will be brought to the Batasan before the counting starts.\n\nThe canvassing will proceed despite unresolved petitions before the Supreme Court challenging the legality of Marcos' candidacy.\n\nDrilon, however, believes the Supreme Court will respect the Congress as a co-equal branch and will not issue a restraining order to stop Congress from performing its constitutional duty.\n\nThe court \"will not create that kind of situation where the Congress will defy them,\" he said.\n\nOnce the winners are proclaimed, the petitions will become moot and academic, he said.\n\nThe House on Monday adopted its own resolution to hold a joint session with the Senate for the canvassing.\n\nSpeaker Lord Allan Velasco and Senate President Vicente \"Tito\" Sotto 3rd will serve as the presiding officers during the joint session.\n\nHouse Secretary General Mark Llandro Mendoza said the rules for the canvassing will be adopted on Tuesday.\n\nSecurity at the House has been tightened, with about 150 police officers assigned to the Batasan.\n\nPhilippine National Police officer in charge Lt. Gen. Vicente Danao Jr. said that additional police personnel have been deployed to guard the House.\n\nHe told reporters on Monday he is not ruling out the possibility of rallies outside Batasan organized by groups who have yet to accept the results of the elections.\n\nDanao said the officers have been reminded to be tolerant when dealing with demonstrators.\n\n\"Alam niyo (You know) everyone has his own right to express their own grievances. Karapatan po natin lahat 'yan pero nakikiusap ako let us do it in a proper forum. (It is their right but I ask them to do it in a proper forum),\" Danao said.\n\nTHE fanatics among their ranks — cultists would be a more accurate term — will of course never get out of their delusion that Leni Robredo has started a \"Pink movement,\" or as the craziest among them has claimed, a \"New Pink Army,\" a play on the once-dreaded communist-led New People's Army.\n\nBut Robredo is history. She'll vanish in a few months, just as a more formidable but losing candidate, Mar Roxas, did.\n\nThe only \"tsunami\" of volunteers was in Facebook posts claiming there was. Former super-yellow senator Sergio Osmeña 3rd revealed what most people suspected as he couldn't help boasting, and told the New York Times that he \"paid for 10,000 volunteers.\"\n\nOsmeña and the likes of him certainly wouldn't pay for \"volunteers\" for the vaguest of objectives as Robredo's \"Angat Buhay\" NGO, unless she packages it in a way that would interest the CIA-linked National Endowment for Democracy (Rappler and VERA Files funders) enough to fund it.\n\nIn the first place, Robredo, with her Alfred Neuman smile (of Mad magazine fame) was completely out of her league. She never had the qualifications — both the intellectual qualities and political savvy — to be president, as her stint as House representative and vice president obviously had shown. The Yellows though could not get anybody else to be their presidential candidate.\n\nThe Pinks remind me of the Progressive Party of the Philippines, led by Raul Manglapus, which, as in the case of Robredo, the Jesuits especially and the Catholic Church pushed for, and the \"disente\" elites, which I rooted for when I was in high school.\n\nI bet you haven't heard of it. The presidential bid in 1965 of Manglapus — who was a hundred times more eloquent and intelligent than Robredo — failed miserably. It got only 5 percent of the vote, with Ferdinand Marcos getting 52 percent and Gerardo Roxas getting 43 percent. It disappeared just a few months after, as the Pinks will.\n\n31 million\n\nFerdinand \"Bongbong\" Marcos Jr. (BBM) got 31 million, or 59 percent of the votes, certainly a landslide victory. Data in a survey undertaken by Laylo Research show that 55 percent of BBM voters are \"hard voters,\" i.e., those who would not change their minds in choosing him — i.e., his hardcore followers. This means a solid base of 17 million potential cadres.\n\nBy comparison and using the same methodology, Robredo would have only 2 million — but who I think at most are the types whose political participation does not go beyond electoral episodes.\n\nMost Filipinos aren't really partisans, in contrast to Americans who would identify themselves as members either of the Democratic Party or Republican Party. Most of those who voted for Leni will be patriots, who would now be hoping that the BBM presidency succeeds which success after all means the upliftment of Filipinos' well-being. This doesn't of course include the Reds, who have since the 1960s opposed all administrations, and tried to bring them down, in the hope that they could grab power.\n\nBut after all, the number of people who voted for the Reds' candidate Leody de Guzman is just 94,000 — which I think is a liberal estimation of the Communist Party's active members and activists. The Reds fared very poorly in the party-list elections. Only Gabriela — which is known more as a women's movement rather than a \"national-democratic\" (i.e., Red) organization — will be winning a seat. The people have rejected its once mighty Bayan Muna and Anakpawis.\n\nSenate\n\nNow look at the Senate. All except Risa Hontiveros were either endorsed by BBM, President Duterte or both. Hontiveros has become a political orphan, as her party Akbayan couldn't even run as a party-list.\n\nIncluding Hontiveros, there are now only four among the 24 senators who are not under the Marcos-Duterte wing: Koko Pimentel, Grace Poe and Nancy Binay, the latter two not even known to be anti-Marcos persons.\n\nWhile I am unable still to make a count, I was told that only a tenth — at most — of the winning Congress representatives are from the opposition — and the lower House of course is populated mostly by politicians who would kowtow immediately to the incumbent president.\n\nWith his appointment to the Supreme Court of Court of Appeals judge Maria Filomena Singh, Duterte has appointed 13 of the 15 high tribunal justices, the biggest number of sitting justices ever appointed by a single president. While they of course are not beholden to BBM, their political beliefs are certainly not that of the Yellows or the Pinks, or else the politically astute Duterte would not have appointed them.\n\nHegemon\n\nIn short, with a feeble an outfit as the really ephemeral \"Pinks\" and the tiny CPP, the BBM-Sara Duterte tandem is the most powerful political hegemon in this country now.\n\nWith its formidable power, I would think its main, immediate task — to strike while the iron is still hot, as the cliché goes — should be the total destruction of the Reds, a task BBM's father set out to do, but failed, ironically because he wasn't as ruthless as other heads of countries were.\n\nHowever, while reduced to a tiny group now, the Communist Party controls key institutions positioned to broadcast its views way beyond its actual strength, such as media, a major faction of the Catholic Church and the universities, especially UP, the Ateneo and La Salle.\n\nOther countries — Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia, South Korea and Indonesia — decades ago wiped out their communist scourges. What his father failed to do, BBM must accomplish: to destroy the CPP completely and grind it to fine dust. If he accomplishes only that, he will be viewed as one of our best presidents ever.\n\nFacebook: Rigoberto Tiglao\n\nTwitter: @bobitiglao\n\nArchives: www.rigobertotiglao.com\n\nBook orders: www.rigobertotiglao.com/shop\n\nSURVEY firms Pulse Asia, OCTA Research and PUBLiCUS maintained that pre-election survey results are reliable in predicting public sentiment as can be shown by the results of the unofficial tally of votes.\n\nAs of writing, 98.27 percent of election returns were reflected in the Comelec Transparency Server with presumptive president Ferdinand \"Bongbong\" Marcos Jr. leading the race after receiving more than 31 million votes, or around 58 percent of the total votes. Presumptive vice president Sara Duterte-Carpio received 31.5 million votes, or 61 percent of the total votes.\n\nIn the latest survey by Pulse Asia conducted from April 16 to 22, Marcos was supported by 56 percent of respondents while Duterte-Carpio received 55 percent, with a ±2 percent margin of error.\n\nThe former senator also got 58 percent in OCTA Research's April 22 to 25 survey and 54 percent in the PUBLiCUS May 2 to 5 survey. The Davao City mayor received support from 56 percent of OCTA Research respondents and 59 percent in PUBLiCUS.\n\nBoth surveys had a ±3 percent margin of error for national results.\n\nWith the pre-election survey results and the partial unofficial votes reflected in the Comelec Transparency Server, Pulse Asia Research Director Ana Maria Tabunda said that its survey results reflected the sentiments of the people.\n\n\"[T]he fact that our results mirror the Comelec count shows that surveys are reliable. The pre-election survey results are just one source of information for the public to consider in choosing their candidates, so surveys cannot be regarded as mind-conditioning tools,\" she added in a message to The Manila Times.\n\nSimilarly, PUBLiCUS Executive Director Aureli Sinsuat said that the results transmitted through the transparency server appear to have validated the consistent findings of the survey firm throughout the election season.\n\n\"[Our findings were consistent that] Bongbong Marcos and Sara Duterte-Carpio would win by large margins on Election Day. This is a vindication of the scientifically-sound polling methods employed by legitimate survey firms,\" he said.\n\nOCTA Research fellow Ranjit Rye said in an interview with The Manila Times that the elections validated the reliability of surveys, specifically those that use scientific methods in gathering data and have transparent and accountable process in releasing their methodologies and results.\n\n\"Surveying, for a first-timer like us, it is very important to get it right. Surveys are scientific, they are reliable. There were a lot of criticisms in the past, but the surveys have again been proven to be reliable,\" he added.\n\nHowever, Rye noted that there could still be some discrepancies in a pre-election survey, as observed with the percentage of support garnered by Vice President Maria Leonor \"Leni\" Robredo. He said that they expected her to receive 10 million to 12 million votes. But instead, she was supported by more than 14 million voters as shown by the Comelec Transparency Server.\n\nThe OCTA fellow added that their results were similar to the results for senators, but in jumbled positions — especially for actor Robin Padilla being the top senatorial bet.\n\nOverall, survey firms Pulse Asia, OCTA Research and PUBLICUS affirmed that results of the pre-election surveys mirrored the partial unofficial election results from the Comelec Transparency Server and maintained that survey results remained reliable in reflecting public sentiment on Election Day.\n\nFORMER senator Ferdinand \"Bongbong\" Marcos Jr. won the presidential election on Monday as he posted an unassailable lead over his nearest rival, Vice President Maria Leonor \"Leni\" Robredo.\n\nWith more than 97.97 percent of ballots processed, Marcos, the standard-bearer of the Partido Federal ng Pilipinas, received 31,002,650 votes as of 4:47 p.m. Tuesday, based on the partial and unofficial figures.\n\nWith this, Marcos surpassed the record 16 million votes that President Rodrigo Duterte got in 2016.\n\nRobredo, Marcos' closest rival, is in second place, getting 14,780,371 votes so far.\n\nShe was followed by Sen. Emmanuel \"Manny\" Pacquiao who got 3,622,305 votes; Manila Mayor Francisco \"Isko Moreno\" Domagoso, 1,883,252; Sen. Panfilo Lacson, 880,206; Faisal Mangondato, 254,496; Ernesto Abella, 112,977; Leodegario \"Ka Leody\" de Guzman, 91,863; Norberto Gonzales, 88,806; and Jose Montemayor, 59,802.\n\nMarcos' running mate for vice president is Davao City Mayor Sara Duterte-Carpio, the daughter of outgoing president Rodrigo Duterte.\n\nMany of their supporters voted to see a continuation of Duterte's policies, including his controversial war on drugs.\n\nPartial and unofficial results show Duterte-Carpio is also leading the race for the vice presidency.\n\nDuterte-Carpio had 31,446,502 votes; Sen. Francis Pangilinan, 9,205,516; Senate President Vicente Sotto 3rd, 8,168,034; Dr. Willie Ong, 1,840,540; and Deputy Speaker Jose \"Lito\" Atienza, 266,619.\n\nMeanwhile, the Marcos camp urged Filipinos to support the president-elect regardless of their political colors.\n\n\"We should rally behind our president-elect, kung sino man siya, at sa pagkakataong ito lumilinaw na tila ito ay si presidential frontrunner Bongbong Marcos (We should rally behind the president-elect, whoever it will be, and right now, it looks like that it is presidential frontrunner Bongbong Marcos),\" Victor Rodriguez, spokesman of Marcos, said.\n\n\"Kailangan suportahan natin (We need to support him) regardless of our political color, race, or belief because he is now the president of the country. He will be the president of the country, he will be the leader, we only have one country and that is the Philippines,\" he added.\n\nRodriguez said Marcos will continue his \"unifying brand of leadership.\"\n\n\"Kung saka-sakaling magpatuloy ito sa pagbubukas muli ng sesyon ng Kongreso at kung saka-sakaling malinaw na at siya ang maiproklama as president of the country, hinihingi niya ang tulong ng bawat Pilipino and going back to the way he announced his candidacy, what he is offering will be his unifying brand of leadership (If this continues until the resumption of the session of Congress and he will be proclaimed as president, he is asking the help of every Filipino, and going back to the way he announced his candidacy what he is offering is his unifying brand of leadership),\" he said.\n\nThroughout their campaign, Marcos and Duterte-Carpio have consistently appealed to all Filipinos to join in their call for national unity.\n\nAs part of its Covid-19 pandemic recovery plan, the UniTeam tandem has pledged to revive the agriculture sector and continue President Duterte's Build, Build, Build infrastructure program to generate jobs and jumpstart the economy.\n\nIt believes that creating a unified front amid the problems created by the Covid-19 pandemic is the best hope for the country to recover swiftly.\n\nFor Duterte-Carpio's camp, the results of Monday's elections is a significant step in unifying the Philippines.\n\n\"Siyempre masaya talaga si Mayor Inday Sara (Mayor Inday Sara is very happy). Punung-puno po siya ng pasasalamat sa lahat ng ating taumbayan (She is full of gratitude for the public), volunteers, parallel groups, local leaders who came out to support Mayor Inday Sara and our next president, Bongbong Marcos. She's filled with hope that this is the first big step toward unifying our country,\" Liloan Mayor Christina Frasco, Duterte-Carpio's spokesman, said.\n\n\"The results of the election demonstrate that the first step has been taken. Overwhelmingly 'yung ating mga kababayang Pilipino mas lumahok at nagpakita ng kanilang suporta sa mensahe ng pagkakaisa (Our countrymen have joined in showing support to the call for unity). Over and above our political differences is our common love for our country demonstrated by an overwhelming number of Filipinos who came out to exercise their democratic right to vote,\" she added.\n\nFrasco said Duterte-Carpio is thankful to her supporters who voted for her and acknowledged their tandem's call for unity.\n\n\"Unang una po nagpapasalamat si Mayor Inday Sara Duterte sa lahat ng ating kababayang Pilipino na bumoto at lumahok sa mensahe ng pagkakaisa ng UniTeam (First of all, Mayor Inday Sara Duterte is thankful to all the Filipinos who voted for her and joined her call for unity),\" she said.\n\nAsked if Duterte-Carpio is willing to reach out to her opponents in the recent polls, Frasco said that the President's daughter has always been a \"unifier.\"\n\n\"Mayor Inday Sara has always been a unifier and that has been her message all along, together with our next president Bongbong Marcos, and so I have no doubt that the move of the next administration will be anchored on unity, no matter the political divisions this past elections,\" she added.\n\n(UPDATED) WITH the campaign period winding down, the UniTeam partnership of Ferdinand \"Bongbong\" Marcos Jr. and Sara Duterte-Carpio maintained its lead in the final PUBLiCUS survey.\n\nMarcos racked up 54 percent to lead all presidential bets in the May 2 to 5 poll. Duterte-Carpio was also the runaway leader in the vice presidential race with 59 percent.\n\nIn the seven surveys that PUBLiCUS conducted beginning October 2021, Marcos consistently posted wide winning margins, ranging from 49 percent to 57 percent.\n\n\"While the preference share of Marcos Jr. dipped from a peak of 57 percent during the third week of April to 54 percent in the first week of May, it is of note that his current mark is in line with his longer-term average,\" PUBLiCUS said.\n\nMarcos' closest rival, Vice President Maria Leonor \"Leni\" Robredo, notched 22 percent in the latest survey, with her voter preference share from October 2021 swinging between 20 percent and 23 percent.\n\nManila Mayor Francisco \"Isko Moreno\" Domagoso had 8 percent in the recent survey, Sen. Panfilo \"Ping\" Lacson 4 percent, Sen. Emmanuel \"Manny\" Pacquaio 2 percent, and former Malacañang spokesman Ernesto Abella 1 percent.\n\nSix percent of the respondents were still undecided who to vote for on Monday.\n\nMarcos was the top pick in Northern and Central Luzon (NCL) with 63 percent. He had 43 percent in Southern Luzon (SL), 49 percent in the Visayas, and 69 percent in Mindanao.\n\nRobredo and Marcos were statistically tied in the National Region (NCR) at 42 and 37 percent, respectively.\n\nAcross socioeconomic classes, Marcos was also the top pick in classes ABC, D, and E at 47, 58, and 65 percent, respectively.\n\nThe survey showed that 90 percent of those who expressed support for Marcos also said they were \"not likely\" or \"definitely not\" going to change their choice.\n\nDuterte-Carpio has also been leading in the PUBLiCUS surveys since December 2021, with her voter share preference ranging from 54 to 59 percent.\n\nShe was not part of the initial survey in October since she registered as a substitute candidate for the Lakas ng Tao-Christian Muslim Democrats (Lakas-CMD) party.\n\nSen. Francis \"Kiko\" Pangilinan was in second place with 16 percent, with his overall preference ranging from 10 to 16 percent.\n\nSenate President Vicente \"Tito\" Sotto 3rd and Dr. Willie Ong are in a tie at 9 percent, and Buhay party-list Rep. Jose \"Lito\" Atienza had 1 percent.\n\nFour percent of the respondents said they were still undecided who to vote for as vice president.\n\nDuterte-Carpio led in the subnational areas of NCL at 63 percent, 45 percent in Southern Luzon, 55 percent in the Visayas, and 79 percent in Mindanao.\n\nShe statistically tied with Pangilinan in NCR, rating 42 percent to Pangilinan's 30 percent.\n\nDuterte-Carpio also dominated across socioeconomic classes ABC at 51 percent, D at 63 percent, and E at 69 percent.\n\nPUBLiCUS said 94 percent of those who are for Duterte-Carpio said that they were \"not likely\" or \"definitely not\" going to change their choice.\n\nIn the senatorial race, PUBLiCUS noted that the 1st to 7th places are considered \"safe spots,\" with the candidates occupying the slots getting around 35 percent preference share.\n\nThey are Sorsogon Gov. Francis \"Chiz\" Escudero (46.20 percent), Sen. Sherwin \"Win\" Gatchalian (42.20 percent), Antique Rep, Loren Legarda (42.40 percent), Taguig Rep. Alan Peter Cayetano (40.20 percent), broadcaster Raffy Tulfo (38.80 percent), former Public Works and Highways secretary Mark Villar (35.47 percent), and actor Robin Padilla (34.67 percent).\n\nIn the so-called competitive zone are Sen. Ana Theresia \"Risa\" Hontiveros (31.07 percent), Sen. Juan Miguel \"Migz\" Zubiri (30.87 percent), former Quezon City mayor Herbert \"Bistek\" Bautista (29.53 percent), former Defense chief Gilbert Teodoro Jr. (28.53 percent), lawyer Jose Manuel \"Chel\" Diokno (27.33 percent), former senator Joseph Victor \"JV\" Ejercito (25.93 percent), Sen. Emmanuel Joel Villanueva (25.73 percent), lawyer Lorenzo \"Larry\" Gadon (25.33 percent), and former Palace spokesman Herminio \"Harry\" Roque Jr. (25.33 percent).\n\n\"Given the demographic statistics of the sample, a strong argument can be made that [former vice president Jejomar 'Jojo'] Binay and [former senator Jose 'Jinggoy'] Estrada are within the competitive zone given that they are expected to poll well among those in classes D and E on May 9,\" PUBLiCUS said.\n\nSeven party-lists were able to get at least 2 percent of support from respondents, which is the threshold to secure at least one House seat.\n\nThe groups are ACT-CIS (6 percent), Kabayan (3 percent), Ako Bicol (2.7 percent), United Senior Citizen (2.4 percent), Duterte Youth (2.3 percent), Gabriela (2.2 percent), and Ako OFW (2 percent).\n\nPUBLiCUS surveyed 1,500 respondents randomly drawn from the market research panel of PureSpectrum of over 200,000 Filipinos. The final survey panel was restricted to registered voters.\n\nThe survey has a ±3 percent margin of error for nationwide results.\n\nThe Manila Times is the media partner of PUBLiCUS.\n\nBY Monday, May 9, millions of Filipinos will troop to the polls to cast their votes in the very first elections where our country is just recovering from the coronavirus disease of 2019 pandemic. This is an election that has seen the full deployment of new media technologies, even as it is also one where the survey rankings of candidates have been pretty much consistent, and where the margin of the frontrunner has always been double-digits.\n\nIt is almost obligatory for political commentators to issue our endorsements and publicly declare who we are voting for. I will not live up to this expectation, but instead remind everyone to just vote for the candidates whom they feel best represent their aspirations. Since we are voting for our representatives, the key is actually us and what exactly are the things we want for our country and the direction it should take. It should not be about personalities. And more importantly, it should not be about endorsements by other people, or about who is ahead in surveys. We should vote for the candidate who can speak for and bear the burdens of our visions of our future.\n\nWe are voting for the highest position in our country, and there are 10 candidates offering themselves to us. Each of them have their own unique qualifications and potentials. Ismael Mangondato is the only Muslim candidate and carries with him the gift of being a voice of the Indigenous peoples. Jose Montemayor Jr. is a medical doctor by profession, while Ernesto Abella is a former Cabinet official of President Duterte, and both would bring their personal experiences in their areas of concern as their take-off points. Norberto Gonzales brings with him a rich array of experience in national security and in international affairs, something that would be needed as we navigate a world facing the continuing threats of war and of a pandemic. And then we have Leodegario de Guzman, a leftist progressive labor leader who offers novelty and a radically different take on how we have to transform our political structures and processes.\n\nPanfilo Lacson is the coolest candidate in this batch, with his business-like calmness and very professional demeanor that gives the impression of a steady hand that would navigate the ship of state as it travels the rough seas of an unstable and uncertain world. Emmanuel Pacquiao's sincerity to serve despite the odds is his best asset. Francisco Domagoso brings in youthful exuberance and energy, and a kind of determination to act quickly. Maria Leonor Robredo, as the only female candidate, brings in the power of the feminine into her style of focusing on consultation and dialogue. Finally, Ferdinand Marcos Jr. is the candidate who is committed to a legacy of a brand, and is the one who ensures the continuity of the policies and direction of the incumbent president.\n\nThese candidates have their own individual potentials, but in the end are also weighed down by their own handicaps and baggage. Mangondato, Montemayor, Abella, Gonzales and de Guzman suffer from low awareness and popularity as they languish at the bottom of surveys with some of them even having a preference of less than one percentage points. Lacson is saddled by his lack of charisma and his right-wing tendencies. Pacquiao is hampered by the perception that he is terribly unprepared to run the ship of state. Domagoso's burden lies on the other side of his over-eagerness, as he is perceived as a young man in a hurry and thus is prone to make wrong moves. Robredo is injured by being negatively associated with a political party, a loyal base and a campaign that has become synonymous with self-righteous elitism and inauthenticity that offended a wide swath of the population. And Marcos remains pulled down and back by the dark past of the tenure of his father as he deals with the curse of a surname which he proudly wears but is hated by many.\n\nRunning with them are their vice presidential candidates, the most notable of whom are Sara Duterte-Carpio running with Marcos, Vicente Sotto 3rd running with Lacson, Francis Pangilinan who is Robredo's running mate, Willie Ong who is running with Domagoso, and Lito Atienza as Pacquiao's running mate. Others who are running for vice president are Walden Bello and Rizalito Yap David. With a system where vice presidents are elected separately on the ballot, these candidates will have their own constituencies distinct from the presidential candidates, although it also likely that some of them would benefit from the coat-tail effect of their presidential running mates.\n\nThe position of vice president has never been consequential in the past during the early stages of a term. However, with the pending electoral protests against frontrunner Marcos still unresolved, there is a possibility that in the strong likelihood that he wins, a petition to hold his proclamation in abeyance would be filed until the Supreme Court rules with finality. Should this happen, and if the issue remains unsettled by June 30, then the vice president-elect who by that time would be duly sworn into office would most likely serve as Acting President.\n\nTo be chosen on Monday by each voter will be at most 12 senators, one party-list, one district representative to the House, a governor and vice governor, and as many provincial board members, a mayor and vice mayor and as many councilors. While there are many hotly contested local races, many of these are also uncontested seats with incumbents running virtually unopposed. The race for the Senate is more interesting, particularly in the last four to six slots.\n\nAt the end of the day, elections are important rituals in a representative democracy. It is that rare moment where the sovereign power that is bestowed by the Constitution to the people is realized and actually exercised. It is a moment that should not be wasted on the past but spent on the future.\n\nPRESIDENTIAL candidate Ferdinand \"Bongbong\" Marcos Jr. and his running mate, Sara Duterte-Carpio, maintained their steady lead in the OCTA Research pre-election survey conducted from April 22 to 25.\n\nMarcos received support from 58 percent of the respondents, posting a 33 percent lead against his closest opponent Vice President Maria Leonor \"Leni\" Robredo who garnered 25 percent of voter share in the survey results.\n\nSupport for the former senator was highest in the Visayas at 62 percent, followed by Balance Luzon at 59 percent, Mindanao at 56 percent, and the National Capital Region (NCR) at 46 percent. He was also the preferred candidate across socioeconomic classes with 60 percent among those in D, 54 percent in E, and 53 percent among those from ABC.\n\nHe was also the top bet across age groups at 61 percent for 18 to 24 years old, 25 to 34 years old, and 55 to 64 years old; 58 percent for the 45 to 54 years old; 55 percent for the 35 to 44 years old; 54 percent for the 65 to 74 years old; and 53 percent for the 75 years old and above.\n\nMeanwhile, support for Robredo was at 28 percent each from Balance Luzon and the Visayas, followed by NCR with 19 percent and Mindanao with 12 percent. Support for her ranges from 21 percent to 30 percent across all age groups, while her voter preference share for socioeconomic classes ABC was at 32 percent, 28 percent for E, and 23 percent for D.\n\nManila Mayor Francisco \"Isko Moreno\" Domagoso got 8 percent, followed by Sen. Emmanuel \"Manny\" Pacquiao at 5 percent, Sen. Panfilo \"Ping\" Lacson at 2 percent, former Palace spokesman Ernesto Abella at 1 percent, Faisal Mangondato at 0.2 percent, and labor leader Leodegario \"Ka Leody\" de Guzman with 0.2 percent.\n\nOnly 0.4 percent of the respondents refused to give an answer on who they will likely vote for, don't know who they will vote for, or will not support any of the presidential bets.\n\nThe survey results also showed that Domagoso and Robredo were in a statistical tie at 12 and 11 percent, respectively, for the second choice presidential candidate if the respondent's initial bet will not continue their candidacy.\n\n'Black swan'\n\nA political analyst said that survey frontrunner Marcos is unbeatable even if some presidential candidates will consider withdrawing or endorsing his closest rival.\n\nIn a television interview, political analyst Edmund Tayao said that the basis of support can be seen in surveys and not in the political rallies of the candidate.\n\n\"All the tailenders, even if you put their numbers together, will not be enough to unseat or to overcome the lead of the frontrunner,\" Tayao said.\n\n\"Many of those attending the rallies are also the ones attending previous rallies. So, it's difficult to determine whether the massive attendance represents the support of a particular candidate in the particular area where the rally is being held,\" he added.\n\nBased on the result of the surveys, Tayo said that Marcos who is number 7 in Comelec official ballot, and his running mate Davao City Mayor Sara Duterte-Carpio, are the sure winners in the presidential and vice presidential elections.\n\n\"I was asked several times on what could be the reason [to change the outcome of elections], the answer there is a \"black swan.\" I mean something that is unexpected. I can just hope and pray that if there will be a black swan, it will not be as disturbing,\" Tayao said.\n\nBlack swan is a metaphor based on an ancient saying that presumed black swans \"did not exist.\"\n\nJust like other political experts, Tayao believed that Marcos would win by a huge margin against his closest rival, Robredo.\n\n\"If our reference, and the only reference we have is the survey, it seems that the vice president will really have to settle in second place,\" the political analyst noted.\n\nOn Monday, Marcos scored 56 percent voter preference in the last Pulse Asia survey conducted with 2, 400 respondents in April 16- 21.\n\nMarcos also obtained 56 percent voter preference in the March survey of Pulse Asia and stayed the huge leader in the presidential derby with 33 percentage lead against Robredo who only scored 23 percent, a drop of one percent compared to her 24 percent voter preference last March.\n\nPacquiao is in distant third with 7 percent, while Domagoso, dropped to number four position with 4 percent, and Lacson in fifth with 2 percent.\n\n\"This has been the trend all along since the filing of candidacy. I don't remember any instance, not any other candidate, not VP Leni, Not Mayor Isko, Not Manny Pacquaio led in the surveys,\" Tayao said.\n\n\"It's quite unprecedented because it's difficult to just compare the current survey to all previous elections considering that it's the first time that a frontrunner would net more than 50 percent of all the respondents,\" he added.\n\nTayao also debunked the statement of some camps discrediting the credibility of the survey firms in the country.\n\n\"In all the elections that we had, I don't remember any other reference that we used to determine who may have an edge or who has an advantage in a particular area or region, other than the surveys,\" he said.\n\n\"If we go back to all the previous elections, the results of the election have always been consistent with the numbers in the survey,\" Tayao added.\n\nMeanwhile, Duterte-Carpio was supported by 56 percent of the respondents, leading the vice presidential survey by 34 percent against Senate President Vicente \"Tito\" Sotto 3rd who was in second place with 22 percent.\n\nSupport for the Davao City mayor was highest in Mindanao at 82 percent, followed by the Visayas at 61 percent, Balance Luzon at 49 percent, and 48 percent in NCR. She was also the top vice presidential bet across socioeconomic classes with 58 percent among D, 53 percent among E, and 47 percent among ABC.\n\nSotto, on the other hand, received a 23 percent voter preference share among respondents in NCR, 25 percent in Balance Luzon, 21 percent in the Visayas, and 10 percent in Mindanao. Across socioeconomic classes, he received support from 25 percent of respondents in E, 22 percent in D, and 20 percent in ABC.\n\nSen. Francis \"Kiko\" Pangilinan received support from 16 percent of respondents, Dr. Willie Ong got 4 percent, Buhay party-list Rep. Jose \"Lito\" Atienza 1 percent, Manny Lopez 0.1 percent, former Akbayan Party-list Rep. Walden Bello 0.03 percent, and Carlos Serapio 0.001 percent.\n\nMeanwhile 1.3 percent of the respondents refused to give an answer on who they will likely vote for, don't know who they will vote for, or will not support any of the vice presidential bets.\n\nAccording to OCTA Research, voter preference share for both frontrunners barely moved compared to the April 2 to 5 survey of the pollster.\n\nBroadcaster Raffy Tulfo was the top Senate candidate in the survey with 63 percent voter preference, followed by former Public Works and Highways secretary Mark Villar with 55 percent, Antique Rep. Loren Legarda, 51 percent, Sen. Juan Miguel \"Migz\" Zubiri, 49 percent, Sorsogon Governor Francis \"Chiz\" Escudero, 46 percent, and actor Robin Padilla with 44 percent.\n\nThose who received at least 30 percent voter preference in the senatorial survey were Taguig Rep. Alan Peter Cayetano (40 percent) Sen. Sherwin \"Win\" Gatchalian (39 percent), Sen. Emmanuel Joel Villanueva (36 percent), former senator Jose \"Jinggoy\" Estrada (33 percent), Joseph Victor \"JV\" Ejercito (31 percent), Sen. Ana Theresia \"Risa\" Hontiveros (31 percent), and former vice president Jejomar \"Jojo\" Binay (31 percent).\n\nFor party-lists, the pollster reported seven groups that were able to garner support from at least 2 percent of respondents, which is the threshold for at least a seat in the House of Representatives.\n\nThese are ACT-CIS (13.58 percent), Tingog (5.89 percent), AKO Bicol (5.20 percent), Probinsyano Ako (4.17 percent), PBA (3.22 percent), 4PS (2.93 percent), and Uswag Ilonggo (2.85 percent).\n\nOCTA Research surveyed 2,400 respondents nationwide, with respondents being 18 years old and above who are registered voters and are likely to vote in the upcoming May 9 polls. The results of the survey have a ±2 percent margin of error.\n\nOCTA Research Senior Fellow Ranjit Rye reminded the public to exercise their right to vote on May 9 and to vote based on their personal preference and not based on survey results.\n\n\"Kapag lumabas tayo kasama ng ating pamilya, lagi tayong mag-iingat — ang pagsunod sa minimum public health standards — at lagi nating isipin na ang boto natin ay hindi para sa kandidato kung 'di para sa ating bayan. Kapag bumoto tayo, importanteng tingnan natin hindi lang ang ating interes pero interes ng buong bansa...at huwag na huwag nating gawing basehan ang survey results para sa ating boto (When we go out with our families [to vote], we must always be careful — following minimum public health standards — and we must always think that our vote is not for the candidate but for our country. When we vote, it is important that we look at not only our interests but the interests of the whole country... and never use survey results as the basis for our vote),\" he added.\n\nDr. Guido David, another senior fellow at OCTA Research also urged the voting public to cast their vote on Monday.\n\nGUIMBAL, Iloilo: Vice presidential candidate and Davao City Mayor Sara Duterte-Carpio said that her running mate, Ferdinand \"Bongbong\" Marcos Jr., will never sleep with the enemies of the State just to win the presidential race.\n\nDuring the UniTeam's Visayas \"miting de avance\" on Tuesday, Duterte-Carpio vouched for Marcos' character as she assured their supporters that Marcos will never strike deals with the country's enemies.\n\n\"Sa kampanyang ito, hindi si Bongbong Marcos, hindi nakipag-usap sa mga grupo na gustong pabagsakin ang gobyerno. Sa kampanyang ito, hindi siya nakipagkasundo sa mga tao o mga grupo na sumusuporta sa mga grupo na gustong pabagsakin ang gobyerno (In this campaign, Bongbong Marcos didn't talk to groups that want to bring down the government. During this campaign, he didn't talk to people or groups that support groups that want to bring down the government),\" Duterte-Carpio said.\n\n\"Bongbong Marcos will never sleep with the enemies of the state. Never,\" she added.\n\nThe mayor urged their supporters in Iloilo province to vote for Marcos. \"Yan si Bongbong Marcos. Hindi niya 'yan ginawa para lang manalo siya (That's Bongbong Marcos. He didn't do that just to ensure his victory),\" she said.\n\nBefore this, Duterte-Carpio told the story of \"Larry,\" a fish porter in Davao City who died from a bomb attack by \"a group that wants to bring our government down.\"\n\n\"As a mayor, 'pag ikaw namamatayan nang ganyan, hindi mo 'yan makakalimutan (when somebody dies on you like that, you don't forget it),\" she said.\n\nThe President's daughter said the Davao City explosion took place on April 28, 2017, less than two months after she gave birth to her youngest child, Stone Fish.\n\n\"Every time na tumitingin ako sa mga anak ko, nakikita ko ang anak ni Larry — mga bata na nawalan ng tatay dahil sa mga grupo, sa mga tao, na gustong pabagsakin ang gobyerno (Every time I look at my children, I see Larry's children — children who lost their father because of groups, because of people, who want to bring down the government),\" she added.\n\nHer statement came amid allegations made against Marcos' closest rival, Vice President Maria Leonor \"Leni\" Robredo. The National Task Force to End Local Communist Armed Conflict has accused her of having made \"a pact with the devil, with the communist terrorists\" for the May 9 polls.\n\nFellow presidential candidate, Sen. Panfilo Lacson, also claimed a possible \"communist infiltration\" in Robredo's campaign and urged her team \"to take appropriate action\" against it.\n\nThis alleged coalition has supposedly helped bring in the crowds to Robredo's rallies. The opposition leader has belied the claims.\n\nIn the same speech on Tuesday, Duterte-Carpio admitted that she may not be the \"best, brightest and most brilliant\" contender for the position, but she said no one can beat her fortitude.\n\nShe vowed to push for job generation, quality education, and peace and order.\n\nDuterte-Carpio said that she will continue the projects of her father, President Rodrigo Duterte, including the Build, Build, Build infrastructure project and the fight against criminality.\n\n\"Nangangampanya kami para sa kapayapaan (We advocate for peace). Sinasabi namin na itutuloy namin ang mga Build, Build, Build projects ni Pangulong Duterte tulad ng mga infrastructure projects na nagdadala ng peace and development sa mga lugar kung saan sila ginagawa. Itutuloy ko rin ang programa kontra kriminalidad ng administrasyon ni Pangulong Duterte (We will sustain President Duterte's Build, Build, Build that brings peace and development and anti-criminality programs),\" she said.\n\nLESS than a week before the elections, independent pollster Pulse Asia on Tuesday said it was impossible for Vice President Maria Leonor \"Leni\" Robredo to stage an upset against former senator Ferdinand \"Bongbong\" Marcos Jr. or BBM who got 56 percent in the firm's latest and last presidential election survey.\n\nAna Maria Tabunda, research director of Pulse Asia, said the majority of the 65 million registered voters have already decided at this time and no amount of convincing could make them change their minds about their preferred bets.\n\nTabunda also said she believes that the result of the survey could also be the result in the May 9, 2022 elections.\n\n\"Magbago man kaunti lang hindi na magkakaroon ng upset. Mahihirapan na talaga 'yung ibang contenders na makahabol (If ever there will be a slight change, there won't be an upset. It will be hard for other contenders to catch up),\" she said during an interview with radio DZRH.\n\nWhen asked if the voting population has already decided, Tabunda said, \"Parang ganun na nga po (Yes, it seems like that).\"\n\nResults of the poll conducted from April 16 to 21 released on Monday, May 2, showed no movement in their figures compared to last month's.\n\nThe survey covered 2,400 respondents nationwide.\n\nMarcos, running mate of Davao City Mayor Sara Duterte-Carpio, maintained a 56 percent voter preference score against his closest rival, Robredo, who got 23 percent.\n\nThe former senator dominated in all geographic areas, including Metro Manila where he scored 57 percent, Balance Luzon with 54 percent, the Visayas with 47 percent and Mindanao where he scored highest with 67 percent.\n\nRobredo came in second with 26 percent in Metro Manila, 24 percent for Balance Luzon, 34 percent in the Visayas and 11 percent in Mindanao.\n\nTabunda said of the 56 percent voter preference for Marcos, majority of them claimed that they will not change their decision until the May 9 elections.\n\n\"Eighty percent ang nagsasabi na hindi na magpapalit ang boto nila para kay BBM. Sa tingin ko hindi (na lilipat). That's why 'yun pa rin ang number niya,\" she explained, referring to the no movement of survey numbers of the candidates for President.\n\nTabunda earlier revealed that converting the 56 percent of Marcos into votes is equivalent to about 36.5 million of the total 65 million registered voters in the country.\n\nShe said Marcos' consistently high numbers are historic since it was the first time since they started conducting pre-election surveys that a candidate for president has been able to maintain his 50-plus percentage voter preference for the duration of the race.\n\n\"Marcos was leading by 33 percent margin points and if it is converted into votes, it could be around 19.5 million, which was even higher than the more than 16 million votes President Rodrigo Duterte obtained in the 2016 presidential polls,\" Tabunda said.\n\nWhile \"confident\" of victory, Victor Rodriguez, spokesman for Marcos, said their camp is taking the latest Pulse Asia survey with \"guarded optimism.\"\n\n\"We are optimistic. We are confident, but we are never complacent. We are always on a guarded optimism,\" Rodriguez said in a television interview.\n\nIn a statement issued following the release of the survey, he also said the strong showing of Marcos and Duterte-Carpio only proved that the tandem's message of unity reverberated among a great majority of Filipinos.\n\n\"The message and call for unity have reverberated all over the land among a great majority of Filipinos who responded by continuously embracing the tandem of BBM-Sara,\" Rodriguez added.\n\nHe urged supporters of the tandem to vote and remain vigilant on Election Day.\n\n\"For all of us in the UniTeam, the most important survey is Election Day itself, thus, we call upon our countrymen to be vigilant and let us make sure that the true and genuine will of the people shall be heard, be counted and prevail,\" Rodriguez said.\n\n\"These elections are all about our future, as Filipinos of one race and as one nation. Please go out and vote on May 9,\" he added.\n\nMeanwhile, the last Kalye Survey summaries indicated a super majority victory for Marcos and Duterte-Carpio.\n\nBased on the data gathered by Splat Communications from Kalye Surveys conducted nationwide from April 11 to 30, Marcos and Duterte-Carpio will be runaway winners, garnering voter preference shares of 68.3 percent and 68.2 percent, respectively.\n\nMarcos was followed by Robredo, who was far second with her preference shares of 14 percent.\n\nAspirant for vice president Senate President Vicente \"Tito\" Sotto 3rd, on the other hand, has preference shares of 15.6 percent, which is way off from frontrunner Duterte-Carpio's.\n\nFor third place in the race to the Palace, Sen. Emmanuel \"Manny\" Pacquiao outpaced Manila Mayor Francisco \"Isko Moreno\" Domagoso, with 5.8 percent preference shares as against the latter's 4.6 percent.\n\nThere were 10,091 respondents for the presidential survey with the undecided pegged at 6 percent; while there were 6,881 respondents for the vice presidential survey, with 7.9 percent undecided.\n\n\"The data show a tandem super majority victory for the UniTeam of Mayor Inday Sara Duterte and former senator Ferdinand 'Bongbong' Marcos Jr. This is already inevitable at this point... It's just a matter of time before these formalities are realized,\" Splat Communications said.\n\nThe information and data provider also pointed out that no challenges for debate will ever change the outcome.\n\n\"That opportunity has sailed long ago,\" Splat said.\n\nSplat reminded voters to go out and vote to give worth to the data gathered.\n\n\"All of these numbers are worthless if everyone will not vote on Election Day. So make sure your lists are ready and that you will vote,\" it said.\n\nSplat also pointed out that the most successful tandem among all the aspirants is the one that complements one another.\n\n\"Indeed, the future of the Philippines looks bright. Unity is a positive force that paves the way for success. A nation united can never be conquered,\" it said.\n\nINC endorsement\n\nIn Guimbal, Iloilo, the UniTeam welcomed the endorsement of religious group Iglesia ni Cristo (INC), saying it \"seals what we expect to be the landslide victory\" of Bongbong and Sara.\n\nIn a statement, House Majority Leader and Lakas-CMD party president Martin Romualdez thanked the INC for deciding to support Marcos and Duterte-Carpio.\n\n\"On behalf of Lakas-CMD, under which Mayor Sara is running for vice president, let me express our sincerest gratitude to the INC and its millions of members for supporting our candidates. There are no words to describe our appreciation for their decision, and we cannot thank them enough,\" Romualdez said.\n\n\"The INC is one of the biggest religious groups in the country. It is known to vote as a bloc. Its announcement today (Tuesday), together with the expressions of support for the BBM-Sara tandem of other religious and sectoral organizations and local officials, seals what we expect to be the landslide victory on Monday of our candidates,\" he added.\n\nRomualdez, one of the campaign managers of Duterte, said Marcos and Duterte-Carpio spread and shared their message of hope, healing, unity and patriotism during the entire length of the election campaign.\n\n\"With broad support from our people, including INC members, it will be easier for our candidates, should they win the vote, to deliver on their promise of uniting the nation behind its new leaders and the difficult challenges it will face ahead,\" he also said.\n\nThe INC, known for its bloc-voting practice, is purportedly able to deliver over 2 million voters, which could be a factor in Monday's tightly contested electoral races.\n\nINC members are expected to follow the church leaders' choice of candidates when they vote.\n\nThe UniTeam in February had its proclamation rally at the INC-owned Philippine Arena in Bulacan.\n\nIn 2016, the INC endorsed the candidacies of President Rodrigo Duterte and Marcos, who was then running for the vice presidency.\n\nSince its establishment in 1914, the religious group has been active in national and local politics.\n\nReliable information from a source in the know, on Tuesday said Bongbong, Sara and other national candidates allied with the Marcos-Duterte-Carpio camp had been invited to a meeting with top church officials at the religious group's Quezon City Central Office to receive their respective \"blessings\" for their aspirations for higher office.\n\nMeanwhile, local candidates had been requested to go to the INC's provincial or regional offices in the ecclesiastical districts.\n\nThe source said some local and national candidates had been told of their \"selection\" via video conference also last week.\n\nThe insider said \"official announcement\" of all the INC's picks will be made at worship services on Thursday, May 4.\n\nCandidates for senator to be supposedly disclosed by the INC are No. 11 Jojo Binay, No. 14 Alan Peter Cayetano, No. 22 retired Gen. Guillermo Eleazar, No. 25 Francis \"Chiz\" Escudero, No. 27 Jinggoy Estrada, No. 30 Sherwin Gatchalian, No. 40 Loren Legarda, No. 49, Robin Padilla, No. 61 Joel Villanueva, No. 62 Mark Villar and No. 64 Miguel Zubiri.\n\nIn Nueva Ecija, incumbent Gov. Aurelio Umali and his brother Vice Gov. Anthony Umali had been called by the religious group, but the governor's wife Czarina Umali, who is eyeing the congressional seat in the third district, was supposedly not on the list of the INC.\n\nCzarina's opponent, incumbent Third District Rep. Ria Vergara, was summoned by the church last week along with reelectionist provincial board member Eduardo \"EJ\" Joson and Jojo Matias (District 3).\n\nProminent political leaders the Vergaras in Cabanatuan City headed by Mayor Myca Vergara and her father, Vice Mayor Jay Vergara, and their whole ticket were called by the INC over the weekend.\n\nIn Talavera town, mayoral candidate Nerito \"Jay R\" Santos Jr. and his sister, Mayor Nerivi Santos Martinez who is targeting the vice mayor's seat, also last week were personally called by the district minister in the Cabanatuan District locale, while eight others aspiring for the municipal council were informed via videoconference also last week.\n\nSummoned, too, were former mayor Ricardo Padilla (Bongabon town) and incumbents Imee de Guzman (Sto. Domingo), Eufemia Domingo (Licab), Gelo Vargas (Aliaga), Mario Salvador (San Jose City) and Myca Vergara (Cabanatuan City).\n\nWITH REPORTS FROM FRANCO JOSE C. BAROÑA AND CELSO M. CAJUCOM\n\nSEN. Panfilo \"Ping\" Lacson pledged to provide climate-resilient housing units for families relocated from coastal towns if he is elected president.\n\nThe senator said the government \"bears the responsibility of moving people away from disaster-prone coastal municipalities.\"\n\nLacson said that if he wins, \"no family shall be left to fend for itself whenever natural calamities strike — such as super typhoons and massive earthquakes — in accordance with our existing laws.\"\n\nHe discussed the topic when it was brought to his attention by a resident living near a coastal area during a town hall forum with Senate aspirant Dr. Minguita Padilla on Friday at the Peñaranda Park in Legazpi City, Albay.\n\n\"Did you know why we are moving our citizens away from coastal areas? Because these are disaster-prone. When a storm surge occurs, there would be a number of casualties, that's why we have an easement,\" Lacson said in Filipino and English.\n\nHe noted that based on the Global Climate Risk Index 2021 by Germanwatch, the Philippines ranks fourth among nations most vulnerable to the effects of climate change such as violent storms and extreme flooding.\n\n\"Do not blame the government whenever it asks you to leave a coastal area, but a relocation site for you must be prepared, that's a must. It is the obligation of the state to keep our countrymen safe, especially here in Bicol, where you are frequently visited by storms, right?\" he said.\n\nPadilla agreed. She said the government must consider building climate-resilient houses for families who will be asked to relocate elsewhere.\n\nShe said this could be incorporated in plans to seek climate justice from nations identified as the biggest contributors of greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n\"If you are going to be relocated in different places that are safe, I think the government must carefully think about the style of houses it will be building. It should go for housing units that will not be blown away by storms. So, that is what we call climate change resiliency,\" she said.\n\n\"We really need to find suitable relocation sites for our citizens who are in the coastal areas so that, once they are resettled, they will feel safe, and the government should provide that kind of assistance for them,\" Lacson said.\n\nSEN. Panfilo \"Ping\" Lacson asked the Philippine National Police (PNP) to look into serious allegations of vote-buying and \"voter terrorism\" or acts of intimidation with 12 days to go before election day.\n\nThe presidential candidate on Tuesday said he received incident reports about vote-buying and voter terrorism which he brought to the attention of a top PNP official.\n\nLacson made the revelation during a town hall meeting in Bangued, Abra where local government officials and residents voiced their concerns about the possible escalation of violence in the province prior to the May 9 elections.\n\n\"I was in a telephone conversation with the top police official not only in Abra, not only in CAR (Cordillera Administrative Region), but 'yung tinatawag nating (what we call) DIPO,\" Lacson said, referring to the PNP Directorates for Integrated Police Operations. \"And I asked him to please come over and see for himself the situation here because I already have been told ng problema tungkol sa (about the problems on) vote buying, tungkol sa (about the) terrorism ng mga botante (of voters) just what you have shared with us this afternoon.\"\n\nLacson said he has been assured by the unidentified PNP official that they will look into these concerns. He also reiterated his appeal to the electorate of Abra to avoid electing politicians with a history of corruption, deceit and other traits unworthy of a leader.\n\n\"When we go to the polling places, consider this thought right away: Am I going to vote for a politician or a public servant? It's about time we choose a public servant, not a politician, because a politician already has a negative connotation that will only be taking advantage of us,\" he said in Filipino and English.\n\nHe stressed this message, especially to the members of the youth sector as he advised them to educate other voters to be more discerning in choosing their next sets of leaders.\n\n\"You are what [Jose] Rizal described as the hope of the motherland, of the fatherland, so act like one. And, you know, let us also educate even those who are older than us,\" Lacson said.\n\n\"Educate them that this is for us, this is not about you anymore, this is about us. And please choose our next leaders, choose our next leaders properly, let us be more discerning,\" he added."
