        "text": "THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH\n\nThe legislative power is vested in a bicameral body, the Congress of the Philippines, which is composed of two houses -- the Senate and the House Representatives. The Congress of the Philippines is the country's highest lawmaking body.\n\nThe Senate, headed by the Senate president and often referred toa s the \"Upper House\", is composed of 24 senators elected at-large (nationwide) by qualified voters for a period of six years. A senator cannot serve for more than two consecutive terms; but he may run for reelection after a break or interval. The senators term of office begins on December 30th following their election. The qualifications for becoming a senator are as follows:\n\na natural-born citizen of the Philippines;\n\na least 35 years of age;\n\nable to read and write;\n\na registered voter; and\n\na resident of the Philippines for at least two years prior to his election.\n\nThe House of Representatives, on the other hand, shall be composed of not more than 250 members, with the Speaker as its chief officer. These seats are apportioned among the provinces, cities, and Metro Manila, according to population. Thus, heavily populated provinces are given as many as six or seven representatives or congressmen. However, the Philippine Constitution provides that each province -- no matter how sparsely provinces of the Philippines are represented in the Lower House of Congress. The congressmen are elected for a term of three years, but they cannot serve for more than three consecutive terms. To become a representative, a person must be:\n\na natural-born citizrn of the Philippines;\n\nat least 25 years old;\n\nable to read and write;\n\na registered voter, and\n\na resident of the province where he is running for at least one year immediately prior to the election.\n\nThe lawmaking function of Congress is very important. It passes laws that regulate the conduct of and relations between the private citizens and the government. It defines and punishes crimes against the state and against persons and their property. It determines the taxes people should pay for the maintenance of the government. It appropriates the money to be spent for public purposes. It can reorganize, create, or abolish offices under the civil service. And it can create and abolish courts, except the Supreme Court. Finally, it is only Congress which was given by the Philippine Constitution the sole power to declare war and to authorize the President - in case of national emergency or war - to issue executive orders embodying rules and regulations intended to carry out the natioal policy.\n\nThe congress convenes in a regular session once a year, starting on the fourth Monday of July. This session may not exceed the prescribed 100 days, exclusive of Sundays. Special sessions may be called by the President to consider general legislations or any subjects which he may want to designate. However, these sessions may not exceed 30 days.\n\nHere are the various steps in the passage of a bill:\n\n1. First Reading - Any member of either house may present a proposed bill, signed by him, for First Reading and reference to the proper committee. During the First Reading, the principal author of the bill may propose the inclusion of additional authors thereof.\n\n2. Referral to Appropriate Committee - Immediately after the First Reading, the bill is referred to the proper committee or committees for study and consideration. If disapproved in the committee, the bill dies a natural death unless the House decides other wise, following the submission of the report.\n\n3. Second Reading - If the committee reports the bill favorably, the bills is forwarded to the Committee on Rules so that it may be calendared for deliberation on Second Reading. At this stage, the bill is read for the second time in its entirely, together with the amendments, if any, proposed by the committee, unless the reading is dispensed with by a majority vote of the House.\n\n4. Debates - A general debate is then opened after the Second Reading and amendments may be proposed by any member of Congress. The insertion of changes or amendments shall be done in accordance with the rules of either House. The House may either \"kill\" or pass the bill.\n\n5. Printing and Distribution - After approval of the bill on Second Reading, the bills is then ordered printed in its final form and copies of it are distributed among the members of the House three days before its passage, except when the bill was certified by the President. A bill approved on Second Reading shall be included in the calendar of bills for Third Reading.\n\n6. Third Reading - At this stage, only the title of the bill is read. Upon the last reading of a bill, no amendment thereto is allowed and the vote thereon is taken immediately thereafter, and yeas and nays entered in the journal. A member may abstain. As a rule, a majority of the members constituting a quorum is sufficient to pass a bill.\n\n7. Referral to the Other House - If approved, the bill is then referred to the other House where substantially the same procedure takes place.\n\n8. Submission to Joint Bicameral Committee - Differences, if any, between the House's bill and the Senate's amended version, and vice versa are submitted to a conference committee of members of both Houses for compromise. If either House accepts the changes made by the other, no compromise is necessary.\n\n9. Submission to the President - A bill approved on Third Reading by both Houses shall be printed and forthwith transmitted to the President for his action - approval or disapproval. If the President does not communicate his veto of any bill to the House where it originated within 30 days from receipt thereof, it shall become a law as if he signed it. Bill repassed by Congress over the veto of the President automatically becomes a law.\n\nExcept in cases of treason, breaches of the peace, or felony, the members if both chambers of Congress are exempt from arrest during their attendance at the sessions and in going to and returning from the same. They may not be questioned in any other place for any speech they deliver in the hall of Congress.\n\nThe Philippine Constitution provides for the election of a Senate President and a Speaker of the House, who are both elected by a viva voce majority vote of all the members of their respective houses, at the beginning of the regular session. The two preside over the sessions in their houses, they also considered as legislative leaders; and they are often called to Malacanang Palace to discuss important legislative measures with the President.\n\nIn addition, the two houses may also appoint their respective secretaries and sergeants-at-arms. The most important function of a secretary is to keep the records of the proceedins, while the sergeant-at-arms is the peace officer of each house. Both officers are not members of Congress.\n\nOther officers of Congress are the pro-tempore and floor leaders. The Pro-tempore Officers are elected in the same manner as the Senate President and the House Speaker. They usually belong to the same political party as the heads of the Senate and the House. They preside over sessions in the absence of the Senate President and House Speaker. On the other hand, the Floor Leaders (majority and minority) are the spokespersons of their respective parties. They usually lead the members of their parties in the discussions of bills or resolutions. They also decide the priority of bills to be discussed on the floor since the majority floor leader usually given the chairmanship of the Committee on Rules. They steer the discussions and debates on the floor with an endview of promoting the legislative agenda of their parties in both Houses.\n\nThe Commission on Appointments consists of 12 Senators and 12 Congressmen.\n\nThe Senate, The Commission on Appointments, The Senate Electoral Tribunal, The House of Representatives.\n\nTHE SENATE 4th Floor, Executive House, P.
