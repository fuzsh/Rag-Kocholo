        "text": "James Madison, the fourth President of the United States, is the most influential founding father, playing an intrinsic role in the development of the United States. Madison graduated College of New Jersey, later called Princeton, in two years at a time when one out of every a thousand people of the population studying subjects like Latin, Greek, science, and philosophy also showing great interest in government and law. James Madison did countless things politically for Virginia. He was a delegate for the Virginia convention, served in Virginia House of Delegates three times, was on the Council of State in Virginia, and wrote the Virginia Constitution. Not only did he have many contributions to Virginia, although he also had much to offer\n\nImagine this, the year is 1777 and possibly one of the biggest mistakes in government was made, now imagine having the chance to change all of that. Well, one man did and his name was James Madison. James Madison was a very politically active man, he was a founding father and the fourth U.S. president. He was nicknamed “Father of the constitution” among many other things all relating to an accomplishment he has made. James Madison was a man who loved to do research and document things as they happened for this he has become very famous for multiple things one being his documents especially of his time as a political member. He was at first a Federalist who thought that a strong federal government would not be good for the nation and opposed to many things such as the Bill of Rights. James Madison was a very big influence with his writings in today's politics and in our government as a whole such as the Constitution, Bill of Rights, and the documents of his time as a political member himself.\n\n“Born in 1751, Madison was brought up in Orange County, Virginia, and attended Princeton (then called the College of New Jersey). A student of history and government, well-read in law, he participated in the framing of the Virginia Constitution in 1776, served in the Continental Congress, and was a leader in the Virginia Assembly.” Before he was serving as Jefferson’s secretary he assembled the first drafts of the Bill of Rights and the U.S Constitution, this making him known as the “Father of the Constitution”. “In 1792, Madison and Thomas Jefferson (1743-1826) founded the Democratic-Republican Party, which has been called America’s first opposition political party.” James Madison beat his opponent Charles Cotesworth Pinckney, who was\n\nIt has been known that James Madison had worried about a tyranny forming in the United States while creating a new constitution. The Constitution produced from the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania of 1787, was constructed to improve and fix the weaknesses of the previous rulebook, the Articles of Confederation. Fifty-five delegates, a few from each state excluding Rhode Island, supported this concern and devotion to creating a more stable government. As stated in the background essay, James Madison and the delegates at the convention were challenged to write a Constitution that was “strong enough to hold the states and the people together without letting one person, or group, or branch, or level of government gain too\n\nThirteen months later, Ben served on the committee that drafted the declaration of independence. He contributed to the Government by serving as a postmaster general, and took over the duties as a president of the Pennsylvania Constitutional Convention. James Madison was known as the Father of the United States Constitution, no other delegate was prepared for the Federal Convention in 1787 like he was. Alexander Hamilton served in the legislature in 1787, which got him chosen as one of the delegates to the Convention. He was at a disadvantage against the other delegates because of how small of a role he played in the debates. He did however end up as one of the three delegates from New York that signed the finished document. George Washington always had concerns for the country’s future, so he was never a fan of the convention because of humanity’s common failings, and he realized that many citizens suspected the convention would be merely a seizure of power from the states by an all powerful central government and he didn’t want to attend because he didn’t want to appear as the power grasping type of person.The U.S. Constitution called \"a living document.\" Though it may seem like a dry piece of paper to you, it really is designed to live and grow as the nation\n\nJames Madison Was a Democratic Republican, who was from Virginia. He was born in 1809 and passed away in 1817. James Madison was one of the authors of the Constitution. He also took on the role of the Secretary of State, before he became the president in 1812. After Madison's inauguration, British ships began pressing U.S.Sailors and also merchants sea men. This is one of the conflicts that gave Madison a reason for war.\n\nIn February 1787, Congress decided that this convention should be focused on revising the Article of Confederation. Debates were about the Virginia plan, how to over slavery, new executive branch, representation in Congress, giving power to President. Most delegates came to the Constitutional Convention clearly knew what was wrong about the Article of Confederation but not know how to fix it. The most outstanding delegate was James Madison. When he arrived at the convention, he brought a detailed proposal for new form of government. It is called “The Virginia Plan”, with some of new significant changes, it became the basic foundation for the Constitution’s final product. That is why so many people call him “The Father of Constitution.” What\n\nI want to give some back ground history on James Madison family. You might ask yourself how did James Madison get here in America or in Virginia? Was he born here? Well, “His great great grandfather John Madison had departed England in the middle of the seventeenth century with the rich soil of Virginia in mind. He sailed between cape Charles and Cape Hennery, entering the Chesapeake Bay with eleven men whose passages he had paid so that he might get “headrights” grants of fifty acres for each of them, as well as one for himself.” (James Madison by Lynne Cheney page 11) So this is how James Madison was born here was due to his great great grandfather. I am so glad that his great great grandfather decides to pick our beautiful state to live i.e. thought that you would like to know that “in 1751 James Madison senior Owned 2,850 acres making him the wealthiest landowner in the county. The great house at Montpelier that would be his son’s home for the\n\nOn a warm July morning, President James Madison was sitting in his office thinking about the current conflict between America and Britain. President Madison had a long history in government. He overcame losing his bid in the Virginia Assemble, but later he became apart of the Governor’s Council, when his career in government all started. Later he went to Philadelphia to be a delegate for the Continental Congress. He also helped to pass Virginia’s Statute of Religious Freedom before playing a major role in creating the U.S. Constitution. Madison then served as a congressman before he was elected president in 1808. He would use the political knowledge he gained to make a very important decision that morning.\n\nJames Madison, also known as the “Father of the Constitution” was born on March 16, 1751 and died on June 28, 1836. Madison is a man who did a lot for his country and had a very big impact at an early age. He fought in the American Revolutionary War, which he served as the colonel for the Orange County Militia. After being second in command to his father, he was elected as a delegate to the Fifth Virginia Convention.\n\nThe Federalist Papers were 85 essays that were published in 1787 and 1788. They were anonymous and always signed by “Publius.” Publius was actually 3 men, Alexander Hamilton, James Madison and John Jay. They wrote the papers to convince the people of New York to vote to ratify the Constitution. These essays were published in newspapers throughout the state of New York. Federalist 10 was written by James Madison and was titled The Utility of the Union as a Safeguard Against Domestic Faction and Insurrection (continued). This essay was a continuation of Federalist 9. Federalists like James Madison and Alexander Hamilton thought that if the states continued to maintain complete control, each state would become its own nation, which would leave the U.S. bankrupt. They believe that a strong central government would have the ability to stop this from occurring. Factions were James Madison’s worst fear. Madison believed that factions were what were going to keep states divided and more likely to turn to individual nations. James Madison’s opinions are correct.\n\nJames Madison, also known as “The Father on the Constitution”, contributed to quite a few intellectual events in the United States. Madison was an intelligent man with bright ideas that helped this country become the one it is today. With all his appearances to debates, committee meetings, and being elected in conventions, he was able to present us the federal government we have today and some of our basic rights. James Madison’s life and times, before, during, and after presidency is now becoming more well known and interpreted."
