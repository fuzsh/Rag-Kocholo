        "text": "In 1776 Madison helped to write Virginia’s constitution. In 1779 he was elected to the Continental Congress, where he served until the end of the American Revolution.\n\nIn 1784 Madison entered the Virginia legislature. He then helped bring about the U.S. Constitutional Convention. In 1787 the convention met in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to create a system of government for the United States. Many of Madison’s ideas, including his support of a strong central government, went into the new U.S. Constitution.\n\nIn 1789 Madison was elected to the new House of Representatives. There he helped pass the Bill of Rights, the first 10 amendments to the Constitution. During his time in Congress Madison came to believe that the federal government should not have more power than the states. He shared that opinion with his friend Thomas Jefferson.\n\nIn 1794 Madison married Dolley Payne Todd. They had no children together."
