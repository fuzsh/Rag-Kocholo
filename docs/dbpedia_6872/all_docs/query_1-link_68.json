        "text": "Lynne Cheney, a historian and the wife of former Vice President Dick Cheney, believes it is time to “clear away misconceptions” about the founder and fourth president, James Madison; to “brush off cobwebs that have accumulated around his achievements” and recover his “fine reputation,” which somehow has gotten lost over the past two centuries. “He is popularly regarded today — when remembered at all — less as a bold thinker and superb politician than as a shy and sickly scholar, someone hardly suited for the demands of daily life, much less the rough-and-tumble world of politicking.”\n\nSince the past decade has seen a spate of books on Madison, some of them emphasizing just what a tough-minded politician he actually was, this seems an exaggeration. But no matter. If it justifies another book on Madison so much the better. We can’t know too much about a man who, Cheney says in “James Madison: A Life Reconsidered,” “did more than any other to conceive and establish the nation we know.”\n\nMadison was the rarest of American politicians: He understood the nitty-gritty of democratic government and was skillful in engineering legislation through the most difficult circumstances, yet always tried to make sense of what he was doing; he wrote some of the most incisive essays on politics that we have. Not only was he the major architect of the Constitution, but he was also one of the strongest proponents in American history of the rights of conscience and religious liberty, as well as the co-author of “The Federalist Papers,” surely the most significant work of political theory in American history. He may not have been quite the “creative genius” that Cheney claims he was — the political equivalent, she says, of Mozart and Einstein — but no one can deny his importance.\n\nMadison was born in Virginia in 1751, and like most of the founding fathers he became the first of his family to attend college. Rather than enrolling, like many Virginian gentry, in the Anglican College of William and Mary, he went to the Presbyterian College of New Jersey (later Prince­ton), where he was introduced, through the president, John Witherspoon, to the ideas of the 18th-century Scottish Enlightenment. In college Madison revealed an intellectual intensity and earnestness he never lost.\n\nIn 1772 he returned to his father’s plantation, depressed and worried about his health, with no plans for a career. He seems to have been afflicted with what he later described as a “constitutional liability to sudden attacks, somewhat resembling epilepsy, and suspending the intellectual functions.” These attacks frightened him and affected his behavior throughout his life. He refused to travel to Europe, for example, for fear that he might have an attack and fall into the sea. Realizing the strong prejudice against epilepsy, he referred to his moderate seizures as an “experience.”\n\nThe Revolution brought him out of his doldrums and started his political career, a career that his father’s slave-based plantation wealth supported. In 1776, at age 25, Madison was elected to attend Virginia’s provincial convention, the body that brought about the Revolution in Virginia and wrote its state constitution, and in 1777 he was elected to the eight-man Council of State that shared executive authority with the governor. He worked with Gov. Thomas Jefferson for several months in 1779, and, Madison said, “an intimacy took place” that began a lifelong friendship between the two Virginians. It became the most important political friendship in American history.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
