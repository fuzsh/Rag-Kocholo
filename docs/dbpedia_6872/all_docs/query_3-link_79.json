Parties develop and implement rules governing elections. They help organize government leadership. Political parties have been likened to public utilities, such as water and power companies, because they provide vital services for a democracy.\n\nThe endurance and adaptability of American political parties is best understood by examining their colorful historical development. Parties evolved from factions in the eighteenth century to political machines in the nineteenth century. In the twentieth century, parties underwent waves of reform that some argue initiated a period of decline. The renewed parties of today are service-oriented organizations dispensing assistance and resources to candidates and politicians."
