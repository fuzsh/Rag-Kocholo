        "text": "James Madison Randolph (1806-1834) was the eighth child and second son of Martha Jefferson Randolph and Thomas Mann Randolph. Grandson of Thomas Jefferson, James was born at the President's House, now known as the White House, during Martha's second visit to her father in Washington, D.C.[1]\n\nRandolph was educated at home and in schools in Albemarle County, like most of his brothers, at Jefferson's expense. In 1825, he attended the first session of classes held at the University of Virginia.[2] Of a gentle and quiet nature, Randolph never married and lived alone, running one of the smaller family farms until the property had to be sold. He died after a brief illness at Tufton, his older brother's estate, at the age of 28.[3]\n\nFurther Sources"
