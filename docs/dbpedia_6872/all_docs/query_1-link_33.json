        "text": "WHEREAS, James Madison, Jr., was born on March 16, 1751 at Port Conway in King George County, Virginia, to James Madison, Sr., and Eleanor Conway at the Conway home. He was brought up in and remained a lifetime resident of Orange County at his home, “Montpelier”; and,\n\nWHEREAS, he attended the College of New Jersey, now Princeton University, studying with The Reverend John Witherspoon, signer of the Declaration of Independence, honing a lifelong commitment to freedom of faith and conscience for all people; and,\n\nWHEREAS, he was a devoted student of history and government, and well-read in the law, participating in the framing of Virginia’s original Statute of Religious Freedom, the Virginia Constitution in 1776, and was a leader in the Virginia General Assembly; and,\n\nWHEREAS, the Constitution of the United States, adopted in 1787, was largely designed under the guidance of the 36-year-old Madison through his work on the Virginia Plan. He later made major contributions to the ratification process of the United States Constitution by co-authoring the Federalist Papers with Alexander Hamilton and John Jay. Madison sponsored and wrote the “Bill of Rights” in 1789, protecting and guaranteeing the rights and freedoms of individual citizens; and,\n\nWHEREAS, James Madison served as Secretary of State in President Thomas Jefferson’s Cabinet, was twice elected to serve as President of the United States, and led the War of 1812. For his contributions, acknowledged by his contemporary compatriots, and a grateful nation since, he has been named the \"Father of the Constitution\", which remains the supreme law of our land;\n\nNOW, THEREFORE, I, Glenn Youngkin, do hereby recognize March 16, 2022, as JAMES MADISON APPRECIATION DAY in our COMMONWEALTH OF VIRGINIA, and I call on all of our citizens to honor and remember James Madison for his significant contributions to our great nation, as well as his outstanding representation of the Commonwealth.\n\nWhat is Google Translate?\n\nGoogle Translate is a third-party service provided by Google that performs all translations directly and dynamically. By detecting patterns in documents that have already been translated by human translators, Google Translate can make intelligent guesses as to what an appropriate translation should be. This process of seeking patterns in large amounts of text is called “statistical machine translation”. Since the translations are generated by machines, not all translation will be perfect. The more human-translated documents that Google Translate can analyze in a specific language, the better the translation quality will be. This is why translation accuracy will vary across languages.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThe Virginia Information Technologies Agency (VITA) website is providing the “Google Translate” option to assist you in reading the website in languages other than English. For these translations, reasonable efforts have been made to provide an accurate translation, however, no automated translation is perfect nor is it intended to replace human translators. These translations are provided as a service to users of the VITA website, and are provided \"as is.\" No warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied, is made as to the accuracy, reliability, or correctness of any of these translations made from English into any other language. Some content (such as images, videos, Flash, etc.) may not be accurately translated due to the limitations of the translation software.\n\nAny discrepancies or differences created in translating this content from English into another language are not binding and have no legal effect for compliance, enforcement, or any other purpose. If any questions arise related to the accuracy of the information contained in these translations, please refer to the English version of the website.\n\nIf you have any questions about Google Translate, please visit the Google Translate website.\n\nIf you have any issues with Google Translate, please visit http://translate.google.com/support/."
