        "text": "HOLLYWOOD -- Once in a while an actress wins a fluke Academy Award and is not heard from thereafter, which could happen to Julie Walters, the star of 'Educating Rita' this year.\n\nJulie is a redhead from England's Midlands with an accent that would etch glass.\n\nOff-screen, her Birmingham dialect falls on alien ears like fingernails on a blackboard. Julie is vocally bearable only because Rita's atrocious Liverpudlian patois is even more horrendous.\n\nJulie looks less like a movie star than a serving wench in a Putney pub.\n\nShe is diminutive, somewhat short of shank and squinty of eye. She is also marvelously energetic, blessed with a keen sense of humor and altogether different from any leading lady you have seen.\n\nJulie, playing a working class, low-brow hairdresser bent on improving her lot by attaining a university education, is positively brilliant.\n\nJust how much is acting and how much is Julie is moot.\n\nShe herself is the product of working class parents, not the sort one would find at a Mayfair high tea. England's caste system would find Julie unsuitable as a regular at the Court of St. James.\n\nAll the same, her director, Lewis Gilbert says, 'I thought she was absolutely superb as Rita in the original play and I think she surpasses that performance in the film.\n\n'I think some actors are born to play at least one part so brilliantly that it will always live in memory.'\n\nSimone Signoret, who won the Oscar for her blowsy jade in 'Room At The Top,' exemplifies one-shot Academy Award winners. Melina Mercouri was another as the mercurial Greek in 'Never On Sunday,' although she was only nominated.\n\nThe same may be said for nominee Ida Kaminska in 'The Shop On Main Street.'\n\nThey all fired and fell back, probably because, like Julie, they were Europeans with limited opportunities to play leading ladies in Hollywood based movies.\n\nJulie, an elfin 33-year-old, enjoys the Oscar speculation and would like to think she is more than a one-shot wonder.\n\n'I could play American women,' she said in a voice straight from Ellis Island. 'I can do 20 different English dialects, y' know. There's a diff'rent accent at 'ome every 30 miles.'\n\nAsked to demonstrate an American accent, Julie cheerfully refused.\n\nPressed to imitate, at least, an upper clawse English accent of the Julie Andrews variety, Julie demurred once again.\n\n'F' God's sake, I'm not performin' now,' she cried. 'I don't audition 'cept when I'm lookin' f' work. It's not me living now, y' know.'\n\nAlthough this is her first movie, Julie is no off-the-street, walk-on sensation. She is a beautifully trained actress, having appeared in stage productions at the Everyman Theatre in Liverpool, the Bristol Old Vic and the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield.\n\nShe has, moreover, appeared in London's top West End theaters and in several English TV shows, some of which she wrote.\n\nJulie won rave reviews for her stage portrayal of Rita but very nearly missed doing the movie.\n\nProducer-director Gilbert acquired the film rights and asked Columbia Pictures for financing.\n\nThe intellectual giants at Columbia agreed to back 'Educating Rita' if the setting were changed to an American university with Dolly Parton in the title role.\n\nGilbert, fighting nausea, returned to London to raise money from the English Coal Board, insurance companies and a couple of pension funds.\n\nHe signed Michael Caine for the Pygmalian-like professor role and, of course, cast Julie in the part which fits her as snugly as the cheap skirt and punk hairdo in which she first appears on screen.\n\nColumbia had the grace, on seeing 'Educating Rita,' to acknowledge its short-sightedness, bought the film after all, and is releasing it this month.\n\n'I wanted the film,' Julie said. 'Me background is diff'rent from Rita's but we're both workin' class girls. She's close to 'ome, if you get me drift.\n\n'I knew I did right by 'er at the first showin' in London. I sat behind the Duke of Windsor, Prince Philip y' know. Afterwards he turns and gives me thumbs up. You don't catch royalty doin' that too often.'"
