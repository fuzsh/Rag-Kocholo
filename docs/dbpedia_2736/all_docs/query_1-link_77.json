        "text": "WILLY RUSSELL’S CLASSIC COMEDY, EDUCATING RITA:\n\nNOW ON STAGE AT THEATRE ON THE BAY UNTIL 15 JULY!\n\nTally Ho! Productions is proud to present a new production of Willy Russell’s classic comedy, EDUCATING RITA.\n\nRita White, a young Liverpudlian hairdresser enrols in an Open University course to study literature to better herself and escape from her drab and dreary working-class world. Along the way, she meets her tutor, Frank Bryant, a jaded professor who quickly becomes fascinated by Rita’s offbeat take on the world of academia.\n\nEDUCATING RITA was originally commissioned by the Royal Shakespeare company and opened to great acclaim in 1980.\n\nThe play was adapted in 1983 to a multi-award-winning film starring Michael Caine and Julie Waters, which would go on to become a cult-classic.\n\nFeatured in the titular role of Rita is Fleur du Cap and Naledi Theatre Award nominee, Zoë McLaughlin, last seen at Theatre On The Bay in the THE LAST FIVE YEARS as Cathy Hiatt.\n\nPlaying opposite her as Professor Frank Bryant is multi-award-winning actor Jason K. Ralph, last seen as Lord Wessex in the Fugard Theatre production of SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE.\n\nThis production of EDUCATING RITA features a brand-new score by internationally recognised composer Jonathan M. Blair and is directed Paul Griffiths.\n\nWith dialogue radiant with the wit and charm of 1980s England, EDUCATING RITA is an intimate, funny, and moving classic about two people trapped in their lives, who in meeting, offer one another an unexpected breath of fresh air.\n\nEDUCATING RITA runs at Theatre On The Bay from 5 to 15 July, 2023.\n\nTickets range from R150 to R 250 at webtickets.co.za, at any P’nP, or by calling the Theatre On The Bay box-office on (021) 438 3300/1.\n\nBooking link: https://www.webtickets.co.za/v2/Event.aspx?itemid=1528565315\n\nDuration: Approximately 120-minutes with a 20-minute interval.\n\nAge-restriction of PG (mild-language usage).\n\nZoë McLaughlin as Rita White (Production images by Andrew Gorman).\n\nJason K. Ralph as Frank Bryant (Production images by Andrew Gorman).\n\nZoë McLaughlin (L) and Jason K. Ralph (R) (Production images by Andrew Gorman).\n\nJason K. Ralph (L) and Zoë McLaughlin (R) (Production images by Andrew Gorman)."
