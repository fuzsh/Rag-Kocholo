        "text": "April 3, 2023\n\nThis is a great British play. It was nice and easy to read and understand while also entertaining.\n\nRead\n\nMarch 18, 2023\n\nFRANK Can I offer you a drink?\n\nRITA What of?\n\nFRANK Scotch?\n\nRITA (going to the bookcase) Y' wanna be careful with that stuff, it kills y' brain cells.\n\nFRANK But you'll have one? (He gets up and goes to the small table)\n\nRITA All right. It'll probably have a job findin' my brain.\n\nRita chega aos 26 anos, casada e empregada num salão de cabeleireiro, sob pressão constante dos pares, e desapontada com toda uma cultura em que a busca do conhecimento é tida como uma excentricidade absolutamente desnecessária e pouco recomendada. Para uma classe trabalhadora como aquela a que pertence, e já agora para uma classe erudita também (espero eu que não tanto em 2023 como em 1980), é conveniente manter limites bem definidos em relação a quem pode o quê...\n\nRITA (...)studyin' was just for the whimps, wasn't it? See, if I'd started takin' school seriously I would have had to become different from me mates, an' that's not allowed.(...)Not that I went along with it so reluctantly. I mean, there was always somethin' in me head, tappin' away, tellin' me I might have got it all wrong. But I'd just play another record or buy another dress an' stop worryin'. There's always somethin' to make you forget about it. So y' do, y' keep goin', tellin' yourself life's great. There's always another club to go to, a new feller to be chasin', a laugh an' a joke with the girls. Till, one day, y' own up to yourself an' y' say, is this it? Is this the absolute maximum I can expect from this livin' lark?\n\nAn' that's the big moment that one, that's the point when y' have to decide whether it's gonna be another change of dress or a change in yourself. An' it's really temptin' to go out an' get another dress y' know, it is. Cos it's easy, it doesn't cost anythin', it doesn't upset anyone around y'. Like cos they don't want y' to change.\n\nMas, apesar disso, pelo menos uma vez em cada geração, é comum ver nascer nesta classe \"ordinária\" uma alma extraordinária que procura, através do percurso académico, realizar uma jornada de autoconhecimento. Rita é essa ave rara que, contra todas as expectativas, chega um dia à porta da universidade para um \"curso livre\". O seu tutor será Frank, um professor snob, problemático e alcoólico.\n\nA ligação que criam é rápida, mas nociva: Rita é uma simplória com aspirações de grandiosidade; Frank é um professor destituído de paixão pela causa...\n\nRITA I'm a freak. I can't talk to the people I live with anymore. An' I can't talk to the likes of them on Saturday, or them out there, because I can't learn the language. I'm a half-caste.\n\nSó que, afinal, Rita é muito mais do que se esperava: as suas aspirações são intelectuais sim, mas subjacente a elas reside um desejo mais profundo do que aquele que Frank imaginava. Aquilo que a sua nova aluna procura descobrir é a liberdade mais completa. A liberdade que apenas o conhecimento compra.\n\nE o seu processo de amadurecimento é algo fantástico de acompanhar; a sua inteligência, a sua perspicácia, a sua forma de olhar o mundo são contagiantes e certeiras...\n\nRITA They'll tell y' they've got culture as they sit there drinkin' their keg beer out of plastic glasses.\n\nFRANK Yes, but there's nothing wrong with that, if they're content with it.\n\n(...)\n\nRITA But they're not. Cos there's no meanin'!(...)An' like the worst thing is that y' know the people who are supposed to like represent the people on our estate, y' know the Daily Mirror an' the Sun, an' ITV an' the Unions, what are they tellin' people to do? They just tell them to go out an' get more money, don't they?\n\nRita chega tarde à universidade, mas tarde é a altura certa - a sua maturidade será uma ferramenta poderosa na sua jornada:\n\nRITA ...if you want to change y' have to do it from the inside, don't y? Know like I'm doin'.\n\nApesar disso, Rita ainda não sabe aquilo que o meio académico é; Frank não é um professor de meia idade frustrado e cronicamente alcoólico à toa. Na realidade, Rita busca o Graal de ouro que Frank já descobriu ser de latão; Rita procura a liberdade sem consequência, enquanto Frank já pagou o seu preço...\n\nFRANK (...)When I was at university there was a student taking his final theology exam. He walked into the examination hall, took out his pen and wrote 'God knows all the answers', then he handed in his paper and left.\n\nRITA (impressed) Did he?\n\nFRANK When his paper was returned to him, his professor had written on it, 'And God gives out the marks'.\n\nRITA Did he fail?\n\nFRANK (breaking away slightly) Of course he failed. You see, a clever answer is not necessarily the correct answer.\n\nO que torna esta peça, e a sua protagonista, tão interessantes é precisamente o facto de a ilusão estilhaçada não representar o fim do sonho, mas tão somente outro obstáculo a ultrapassar para chegar ao destino. E não faltam obstáculos na vida de Rita - a sua resiliência e a sua paixão são marcas que não escapam a quem se dedica ao meio académico apesar de tantos desgostos:\n\nRITA He hates me comin' here. It's like drug addicts, isn't it? They hate it when one of them tries to break away. It makes me stronger comin' here. That's what Denny's frightened of.\n\nA educação de Rita é, pois, tanto uma educação formal, como uma educação emocional que culmina na descoberta do ego.\n\nI don't want anyone else. I've begun to find me-an' it's great y' know.\n\nE essa descoberta revela muito não só sobre a sua pessoa, como sobre todos aqueles que a rodeiam.\n\nFRANK I don't think I can bear it any longer. RITA Can't bear what, Frank?\n\nFRANK You, my dear-you...\n\nRITA I'll tell you what you can't bear, Mr Self-Pitying Piss Artist; what you can't bear is that I am educated now. What's up, Frank, don't y' like me now that the little girl's grown up, now that y' can no longer bounce me on daddy's knee an' watch me stare back in wide-eyed wonder at everything he has to say? I'm educated, I've got what you have an' y' don't like it because you'd rather see me as the peasant I once was; you're like the rest of them-you like to keep your natives thick, because that way they still look charming and delightful. I don't need you. (She gets up and picking up her bag moves away from the desk in the direction of the door) I've got a room full of books. I know what clothes to wear, what wine to buy, what plays to see, what papers and books to read. I can do without you.\n\n(...)\n\nFRANK Found a culture have you, Rita? Found a better song to sing have you? No-you've found a different song, that's all-and on your lips it's shrill and hollow and tuneless. Oh, Rita, Rita...\n\nQuando Willy Russell escolhe trabalhar nesta peça, não lhe é estranho o mundo em que Rita habita: também ele desistiu da escola, também ele sofreu a pressão dos pares, andou perdido (e até arruinou cabelos desprevenidos em salões de cabeleireiro pela Inglaterra fora), e depois decidiu regressar à academia - onde se [re]encontrou.\n\nRITA (...)I had a choice. I did the exam. FRANK I know. A good pass as well.\n\nRITA Yeh. An' it might be worthless in the end. But I had a choice. I chose, me. Because of what you'd given me I had a\n\nchoice. I wanted to come back an' tell y' that. That y' a good teacher.\n\nA Educação de Rita é um hino fruto dessa relação conturbada do autor com a universidade, com o mundo e consigo mesmo. E se a sua peça tem uma moral, ela fica bem resumida nas palavras da sua incrível heroína:\n\nFRANK What are you going to do?\n\nRITA I dunno. I might go to France. I might go to me mother's. I might even have a baby. I dunno. I'll make decision, I'll chose.\n\nOctober 17, 2017\n\nکم پیش میاد بعد خوندن یک متن دچار نئشگی حاکی از داستان بشم اما امروز واقعاً این حس بهم دست داد... امروز تو مترو داشتم این نمایشنامه رو می‌خوندم و وقتی به ایستگاه رسیدم به قدری مجذوب متن بودم که رو نیمکت‌های ایستگاه نشستم و تا آخر نمایشنامه رو خوندم... چقدر می‌شه یه نمایشنامه خوب باشه! انقدر این نمایشنامه به دلم نشسته که دوست ندارم از لحاظ فنی بهش نگاه کنم اما به خاطر پروژه دانشگاه مجبور به این کار هستم.\n\nدو روز پیش که شروع به خوندن نمایشنامه کردم شخصیت ریتا به شدت به دلم نشست... یه دختر خاکی، شیطون، شیفته‌ی این‌که کسی بشه واسه خودش و تقریباً عامه! از اون طرف فرانک یه استاد بدعنق الکلی و بی‌حوصله بود... اما به جرأت می‌تونم بگم از پرده‌ی دوم فرانک تبدیل به شخصیت محبوب من شد... بعد از خوندن این نمایشنامه خوشحالم که به دور و بر خودم نگاه می‌کنم و یه فرانک و یه ریتا تو زندگی‌م پیدا می‌کنم.\n\nMarch 11, 2019\n\n3.5***\n\nFrom the book jacket: Hairdresser Rita feels that life has passed her by. She wants an education. But does Frank have anything to teach her?\n\nMy reactions:\n\nYes, Frank does have something to teach Rita, but she also teaches him. I love watching Rita grow and change throughout this play. I’ve never seen the play performed, nor did I watch the movie, though I remember it being quite popular back in the early 1980s. I knew the basic premise, however and was still delighted to watch it unfold.\n\nRita is a marvelous character. Witty, and forthright. She does not suffer fools gladly, though at the outset she lacks confidence. She feel “less than” due to a lack of education, and envies the students on the university campus their lifestyle. Rita is not sure what she wants out of life, but she knows she wants more, and she sees education as a means to give her more options.\n\nFrank is a perfect foe: a professor and has-been poet, who has more interest in the contents of the whiskey bottles than the contents of the books that line his office shelves, and behind which he stashes the drink. He’s cynical and has taken this special student only for the money.\n\nBut Frank sees something in Rita that sparks his interest. She’s so eager to learn, and he is forced to examine his own thoughts on books and literature and poetry and life based on her questions (and answers). He recognizes in her the spark of desire, and she kindles that spark in him. No, I don’t mean sexual desire - I mean that desire to live, to experience life fully, to learn new things, not because we need them for a job or a career, but because we simply want to live more fully. Rita isn’t certain what path she will choose, but she knows that, thanks to Frank, she now has more choices.\n\nMay 20, 2017\n\nRead: May 2017\n\nRating: 5/5 stars, best of 2017\n\nI have seen the film version of Educating Rita about three times and now I've finally read the original play. I really enjoyed reading it, and Russell's astute comments about what it means to go back into education as an adult and the impact it can have on not only yourself but on your family - particularly as a member of the British working class - still remain as relevant in 2017 as they were in 1980. Rita is a wonderful character and I loved the way the dynamics in the relationship between Rita and Frank slowly change over the course of the play as she becomes more confident and educated. Frank's character was a lot more likeable in the film in my opinion. In the play he came across as someone who was happy to indulge Rita in her quest for education when she wasn't a threat to his intelligence and authority, but as soon is it became clear she was actually blossoming into a literary thinker, he tried to tell her not to change so much; just like all her friends and family he too was secretly happier when the class and education lines drawn between them were clear and separate.\n\nA brilliant timeless play - and I highly recommend the film as well.\n\nMay 2, 2024\n\nIt mentioned a bunch of poets and writers I now can pretend to have read 👍\n\nMay 10, 2018\n\n\"I don't wanna spend the night takin' the piss, comin' on with the funnies because that's the only way I can get into conversation. I didn't want to come to your house just to play the court jester.\"\n\n*4.5 stars*\n\nIn today's episode of Trini Hates Required Reading, I actually liked the book I had to read for uni, yay!\n\nEducating Rita is such a funny, yet thought-provoking read about a Liverpool working class woman in pursuit of her education. The play is basically just dialogue between two characters: Frank and Rita. It is a very fast read and Russell's sense of humor made it really enjoyable.\n\nMy favorite thing about the whole play is, by far, the character of Rita. She is so loveable and endearing, and by the end I felt truly proud of her and her character development. She is determined, unapologetic, self-aware, and she almost never falls prey to the idea of settling for the life she is expected to lead. It never fails to amaze me how playwrights manage to create such well-rounded characters just through the use of dialogue.\n\n\"To pass examinations, you're going to have to suppress, perhaps even abandon your uniqueness.\"\n\nFrank is also a very interesting character and I liked how Russell showed that not only did Rita learn from Frank, but also Frank learned from Rita. She was quick to figure him out and unafraid to call him out on his feelings of superiority and patronising ways.\n\nThe plot is not particularly riveting, but it is not meant to be. It is meant to be a funny, but real reflection of the education system with some great insight into herd mentality in the working class. Thoroughly enjoyable.\n\n\"We could sing better songs than those.\"\n\nJuly 21, 2021\n\nThis is a fantastic play, which anyone who has studied English in further education can appreciate. The passion of Rita and the disenchantment of Frank is well done; believable as well as comical. The set up is simplistic, taking place in one room (Frank's office) and Russell demonstrates real understanding for both of the characters and their backgrounds. A short, sweet, funny read.\n\nI will always have a soft spot for this story as an English teacher I had at college, who very much reminded me of Frank, showed our class the film adaptation with Michael Caine and Julie Walters. Both film and play are great so if you've read/watched one of them, I highly recommend you try the other.\n\nSeptember 5, 2017\n\nThis is actually the second time I'm reading this play, though last time was some three years ago and I also saw the movie recently before rereading. With that said, I can't help but feel giddy over this work. I love a story which can present flawed yet genuine characters realistically, which this truly has.\n\nThen there's also the questions about society being raised, and the dilemma of whether education really does help everyone or if it threatens the individuality of an \"untouched\" mind. An important discussion that needs to be had and considered.\n\nDecember 14, 2016\n\nRead it for school. Loved it. Rita is such an interesting woman and I loved witnessing her evolution.\n\nJanuary 8, 2020\n\n2020: 2/50\n\nThis was a lovely book that I read in about one hour. It filled me with joy and sympathy for the characters, and I truly enjoyed the short time I had with it!\n\nI enjoyed the first act and was going to rate the book a 5/5 but something about the second act made me hesitate and turn to a 4/5... this is because I only rate books 5/5 that I would happily say ‘this is one of my favourite books’ about.\n\nMy favourite character was definitely Rita, as I found that Frank had ran into a mid-life crisis and was using Rita to pick him back up again, which I didn’t like. I feel like a lot of people flunk school and don’t realise how much it affects their lives, so I would love someone who didn’t realise, like Rita, to have the opportunity she had...\n\nThe screenplay format of the book made me so happy, as I love screenplays! I know that plays are meant to be watched, not read, but I couldn’t help it, and absolutely loved it!\n\nI am studying this in class, and started it today in English. I feel like I’m going to get told off by my teacher for finishing it on the first day of picking it up, but oh well, it was worth it! I am truly happy to study this for a full term in school; analysing and delving deeper into the characters, and might change the rating back to a 5/5 later.\n\nThanks W. Russell for this lovely short play (also studying Blood Brothers in drama) and I can’t wait to read your other works :)\n\nApril 11, 2016\n\nWow. That would be the only word that could describe this masterful piece of work. The continuation of this review would be ironic, yet I shall continue as one word is not nearly enough to describe the beauty of this play. The characters wit and charming facades were entrancing. Especially from the fact that if I, a 17 year old girl can relate to a 50 year old English lecturer, it is clearly evident that the authors ability to create wholesome and timeless characters is marvellous and unequivocal. The most interesting aspect of this play is Russell's ability to portray serious matters and yearnings of the average being through humour. The two characters, Rita a twenty six year old hair dresser who is dissatisfied by her working class life and a 50year old lecturer whose only thoughts are to throw his students out the window; The way Russell demonstrates the similarity of their issues really opens up the understating that however different we many be on the outside. however different we may be in culture, we are all somewhat of equals in our needs.\n\nIt was most enjoyable to see a young woman, deprived of education, feed her hunger for knowledge and come to truly understand whether the 'other side of the fence' was truly greener, as you will learn through your reading of this play.\n\nJuly 15, 2022\n\n\"i'm busy findin' meself, let alone findin' someone else. i don't want anyone else. i've begun to find me - an' it's great y'know, it is frank. it might sound selfish but all i want for the time bein' is inside of me. i certainly don't wanna be rushin' off with some feller, cos the first thing i'll have to do is forget about meself for the sake of him.\"\n\ni read this play for school and didn't expect too much from it, but it really surprised me!\n\n\"educating rita\" features a strong, opinionated female character eager for knowledge and a failed poet who took a job at open university out of desperation. even though it is fairly short, it provoked so many interesting ideas and thoughts. what i loved most was how flawed the characters were. they each had their own problems and issues and evolved into different versions of themselves throughout the play. not only that, but also their dynamic changed. rita and frank felt very real and fleshed out which i really enjoyed. i can't wait to discuss it in class!\n\nJuly 6, 2011\n\nI wasn't expecting to like this... how wrong was I?! I adored this play, and would love to see it performed. I love watching the relationship develop between these two - the direction the characters take and the emotions they draw out of the reader. This is a HSC text that I would have avoided like the plague in the past, but after being forced to read it, it has become a first choice!\n\nDecember 11, 2014\n\nEducating Rita - another dreaded essay read, another lame old generation journey? But boy I was wrong, Educating Rita shows true meaning of life, the focus in being yourself no matter what path you take - working-class , middle-class what is the difference? Nothing, nothing at all. This book gets across the message with its unique approach.\n\nNovember 4, 2017\n\nRead it for my English class. Brilliant, and so funny!\n\nOctober 15, 2019\n\nBrilliant. Rita, you go girl!\n\n'On ya Frank.\n\nInspirational stuff. I love it. Funny, moving, empowering.\n\nJune 9, 2022\n\nanother school book i read in almost just one sitting -- and thoroughly enjoyed. it's not a long book; barely anything at all, really, especially since it's a play. the version we got could almost fit into the palm of my hand, and my hands are small; its font size was also quite large. nevertheless, the author managed to fit in a story about change into those scarce pages, somehow showing us as readers the passing of seasons through almost exclusive dialogue. though the main topic of the book is change and abandonment of old ways, some things, small but notable, at least for me, stayed just how they were all the way through. an example of this would be the swivel chair. every time it was mentioned, i would underline it because it was truly something that popped up every ten pages; i must have it underlined about a dozen times throughout the entire piece. it is something that might seem insignificant to some, but to me it showed me the contrast of just how much had really changed by the end. it's funny how the one thing that stayed fully consistent was also the thing that sparked recognition of the amount of change in the book. by the end, rita's character is almost unrecognisable and frank, who was starting to get better during the first half of the book, ended up being the same wreck he was at the beginning. throughout the play, we only encounter these two characters and really no one else, and all of it is set in a singular room. it gives the reader a sense of intimacy, a sense of secrecy, a sense that they're some permanent spectator of that one room that only two people ever enter, able to witness this situation that changed both of these peoples' lives. a room that meant different things to each of them; for frank the room was a stuffy hellhole but the only place he could be left in peace - it became fresh for him whenever rita entered the room; for rita it was place of learning and of acceptance. and the existence of this room could change not only the lives but the entire thought processes of both these people; and you, the reader, were here to see that, as a permanent spectator of the room.\n\nApril 1, 2018\n\nRead it for my uni course. Never read a play before so it was interesting, comical.\n\nMarch 29, 2021\n\nRita or Susan (she decides to change her name to Rita) White, is a northern girl of 26 who wants to be clever, well read and intellectual. She is married to Denny who wants a baby with her but she doesn’t feel ready as she wants to discover herself.\n\nRita decides to enrole on the open university were she meets Frank, a middle aged alcoholic who has been working at the university for years. This forms this unlikely due.\n\nOver time, Rita begins to discover who she is and what she wants from life and the play itself deals with the class system and what is education? Is it to do with formal training or is it just reading books and having intellectual opinions?\n\nIt also deals with how society not only treats the working class but in particular, working class women. Rita feels she has to choose between an education and a baby, which is a choice no woman should ever make. Rita lives in a society that says higher education is for the higher ups and she feels she will never be taken seriously but with her resilience she is ready to fight for what she wants.\n\nThere’s a real soft spot in my heart for this play so I am bias by giving it four out of five, however it is a little dated now but I suppose you could call it a period piece. I have also seen this performed on stage so I can say that it is a fantastic production but probably a little more fun to watch than read.\n\nApril 15, 2022\n\nIt was cute, looking forward to analysing it further for Uni 🙃\n\nNovember 2, 2017\n\nI don't think I can do this play justice with regards to writing a review. It's just bloody brilliant and now easily one of my favourite reads of all time. One thing I will add is I find it astounding how Russell can really get into the minds of women in the late 70s and early 80s. He depicts them as working class heroes, the matriarchs of their families and more than just housewives. Most of his female characters have big dreams and I'm so impressed with him for giving working class women a voice during that time. Shirley Valentine, Rita, Sandra... they're all strong independent women. Good job Russell was a women's hairdresser earlier in life, you can really hear the authentic voices in his characters. Educating Rita is no exception.\n\nSee, told you this review couldn't do it justice!\n\nJuly 28, 2018\n\nWhen I started reading this book i really didn't like it, but had to keep on reading because i needed to finish the book for an assignment in school. Somewhere at page 60 i couldn't put it down anymore. It is a very interesting play with good character development.\n\nUpdate: I'm giving this book three and a half stars. Upon rereading it, the story only gets more interesting. You notice a lot of things in the story that you hadn't seen before and a lot of things start to make sense (I know, i know, i am vague). I really enjoy analysing this story (though that is also because we have a great English teacher. Thank you miss Erve!)\n\nJuly 11, 2012\n\nRead this for a class. Probably the best play I've ever read. I loved it. It's a lot like Pygmalion (if you're familiar with that play). I love stories about students that improve and better their lives and circumstances through education, and this play definitely offers that in a very touching way."
