        "text": "Academy Award-winner Michael Caine along with Julie Walters earned well-deserved 1983 Oscar nominations (Best Actor and Best Actress, respectively) for their outstanding performances in this brilliant, bittersweet comedy. Walters is Rita, a working-class woman seeking the path to self-discovery. Bored with her life as a hairdresser, and under pressure from her husband to start a family, she enrolls in literature tutorials at a British university determined to better herself. Caine is Frank Bryant, the disillusioned English professor who is assigned to teach her. While Frank watches Rita embark on a radical transformation, his own life takes on a different kind of transformation as he finds himself falling in love with Rita while sinking into the depths of his alcoholism. Earning a third Oscar nomination for its screenplay by William Russell (based on his play), Educating Rita is a very funny, very charming and thoroughly entertaining film."
