        "text": "“Educating Rita,” which opened at Little Fish Theatre in San Pedro on Wednesday night, is the kind of play that restores your faith in people and in the power of theater itself, even a small theater like Little Fish, to make a difference in the world.\n\nThe play, written by Willy Russell more than 30 years ago and expanded into a movie by that writer, is a two-person comedy that explores everything from literature to friendship, from human striving to human defeat and depression, with a sightly ironic and finally victorious reaffirmation of the human spirit that leaves the audience, after standing and cheering the actors, with more than a little to think about afterward.\n\nThe two actors Little Fish director James Rice chose for the roles of Frank, the grizzled and alcoholic college professor who is slowly drinking his life away, and Rita, the 25-year-old would-be student who wants to learn everything to get out of her uncultured life, couldn’t be better.\n\nDavid Graham is Frank, a slightly paunchy, slightly graying man in sweater vests who keeps bottles of alcohol hidden behind the books in his extensive library. His British accent is perfect, his defeated life is evident from the alcohol and the fact, slowly revealed in the play, that he is a very minor poet who has resigned himself to academic suicide of a sort. He grades papers and gives lectures and tutorials, lives with a woman who took him in after his wife left him, and pretty much has given up on life, though his mind is still sharp and his tongue witty, even occasionally biting.\n\nInto his office comes Rita — the astonishing Rebecca Reaney — a young woman who loves a book by Rita Mae Brown, “Rubyfruit Jungle,” and has decided she wants more from her life than working as a hairdresser and spending nights at the pub. Reaney is dynamic, exceptionally attractive, and she has no trouble with the British accent: She is British. But it is more than just the accent that keeps your attention, more than just her slow climb out of her limited life to academic success that captivates. Reaney dominates the stage with her personality from the moment she arrives in Frank’s bookish office trying to change her life while all her friends and family, even her husband, want no more for her or themselves than a few pints and a familiar song.\n\nReaney’s delightful Rita might well have overpowered a lesser Frank, an actor unwilling or unable to handle her power in the role, but Graham has no trouble with Rita. She has tremendous energy and enthusiasm, he is a bit burned out, but when it comes to talking about life, about literature, he is every bit as articulate as she.\n\nThe play takes place in London, in a college setting that may be unfamiliar to some: British universities were (and still are) for the elite, unlike American universities, which were (and ostensibly still are) for everyone. Rita has come to Frank because he is part of a free university, where students who just want to learn can have a chance at education.\n\nRita changes as she studies: She starts out dressed in tights and off-the-shoulder tops, and by the time she has spent a couple of years learning, she wears conservative clothes and a sense of the freedom that education has given her. Frank, still drinking, still in knit vests, is hardly changed on the outside, but knows, at least, that he has changed Rita, now Susan (her real name), and that is enough.\n\nRice directs the simple, one-set play with a sure hand and allows his actors the freedom to create these delightful characters in front of your eyes. You’ll love “Educating Rita” and will learn something along the way.\n\nJohn Farrell is a Los Angeles-based freelance writer."
