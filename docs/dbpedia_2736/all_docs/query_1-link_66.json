        "text": "A true classic, one of the finest films of the â€™80s, a high point for Caine, Walters and Gilbert\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 3.5/4 | Nov 1, 2022\n\nInspired by Pygmalion and other works about mentor-pupil troubled/rewarding interaction, Lewis Gilbert's film is too theatrical, betraying its origins, but it's elevated by sparkling performances from Michael Caine and paricularly newcomer Julie Walters\n\nFull Review | Original Score: C+ | Nov 6, 2007\n\n...a thoughtful thematic treatise on cultivation and learning and a charming character study of two lost souls from different worlds finding a common need in one another.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 8/10 | Jan 21, 2006\n\nLewis Gilbert has taken a two-person play from stage to screen and cracked it open\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 3/5 | Dec 3, 2005\n\nIf only I'd been able to believe they were actually reading the books, then everything else would have fallen into place. But I didn't believe it.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 2/4 | Oct 23, 2004"
