        "text": "“Educating Rita” is the funny and poignant story of a young hairdresser from Liverpool, who decides to better her station in life and is tutored in English by Professor Frank Bryant. Initially, Frank bristles at taking Rita on as a student, however, Rita soon wins him over with her unique perspective on life. Things become more complicated, however, when Rita attempts to “educate” Frank to realize his own potentials.\n\nThe play has adult themes and mature language and is not suited for children. Jim McKeny will Direct and Hen Lagesse will Stage Manage the 40+ Stage Company production to open Dec 1 and run through Sunday Dec 10 at the Mountcastle Forum in Winston-Salem.\n\nThis is a profoundly moving, hilarious and challenging play that will be a delight for the actors as well as audiences and it offers a counterpoint to the seasonal family fare that’s prevalent during the holidays. “Educating Rita” gained wide popularity as the 1983 film starring Michael Caine and Julie Walters.\n\nThe characters are Rita (presents as Female, late 20s-early 30s) and Frank (presents as Male, 40s-early 60s). Actors will audition using British dialects and there will be some vocal dialect coaching available during rehearsals. The First Round of Auditions will be via Zoom on Monday August 28th and Tuesday August 29th and will be individually scheduled.\n\nIf interested, or would like additional information, please notify the director via email: jmckeny@msn.com or jimmckeny@gmail.com.\n\nScripts and Audition Sides will be made available prior to auditions. Auditioners will have a unique Zoom audition link and scheduled time. In-person Callbacks will be scheduled as needed.\n\nThe deadline to submit audition requests is Saturday August 25th. Rehearsals will begin late October with a brief Thanksgiving break prior to load in and Tech & Dress Rehearsals."
