        "text": "Educating Rita is a delightful movie to watch, and I like it for various reasons. First of all, it raises a question about what a good education is. Besides, it questions the value of traditional in-classroom education — although the film’s focus is literature. I remember some dialogues about the definition of assonance vividly. First Rita overhears a group of students laugh at someone who doesn’t know anything about it. Later, as she enters Professor Frank Bryant’s office, she asks him what assonance is. Frank gives his explanation, only to be rebutted by Rita claiming it is just a wrong rhyme. Comparing those two scenes (dialogues), I find Rita particularly dear to me as I firmly believe education is not supposed to cram students with all kinds of different concepts so that they can memorize them and pass the exams. Education should focus on methods or strategies that can help students become better persons. When they graduate, they should have been cultivated to be genuine, sincere, brave, and caring souls who can further contribute to society. But please don’t get me wrong, I am not saying it is of no use to understand those terms (concepts); but then again, what I want to emphasize is that knowledge is only a small part of education. Compared with a know-it-all who only cares about money and power after leaving campus — that’s what most people do, unfortunately — a warm-hearted plumber is far more useful to our world.\n\nRita’s change after receiving ‘education’ is huge. Before entering the education program, she is a coarse hairdresser who is extremely blunt, giving direct remarks. And she also uses vulgar words since she has never touched beautiful novels and poems. During the latter period of the program, it dawns on her that she is quite uncultured, inferior to those people who can drone on and on and on about a character depicted in a novel or a particular phrase chosen by the writer. However, I wonder whether this change is positive. In my opinion, she just jumps out of one frame and into another. Yes, she is able to read some great works of some great writers, and she knows how to use ‘correct’ words to analyze them. But so what? Do those skills have any practical application, or can they make this world a better place? Or let’s be pragmatic — do they guarantee her a better future? Maybe thirty years ago, the answer to this question was yes, but what about now? This is the second time I have tried university, and I don’t expect to get a good job after I graduate. It is only something I want to do — if I get a bad grade (in any exam), I am happy to accept it since it will help me to evaluate my periodical progress. I believe Rita has experienced a lot as a hairdresser and a waitress — maybe she has accumulated more insights from the university of life than the ‘real’ university (knowing how to do different hairstyles is not inferior to analyzing a poem by Yeats). Yes, Rita’s change is obvious, but is it for the better or for the worse? I don’t know. All I can say she is a different person at the end of the story. According to my own experience, ‘cultured’ people are usually more hypocritical as they tend to tell more lies (or, at least they always hide their real feelings). The reason? They have such a large vocabulary that they can work out phrases and sentences that carry no real meaning. Listen to the speech of those well-educated Oxford/Harvard graduate politicians, and you will easily understand what I mean.\n\nP.S.\n\nMichael Caine is one of my favorite actors."
