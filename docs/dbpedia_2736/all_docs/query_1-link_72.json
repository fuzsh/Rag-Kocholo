        "text": "The actor who starred in the title role of Educating Rita 22 years ago is directing the same venue’s latest version of the play from tomorrow night (Saturday 24 February).\n\nBirmingham teacher Fi Cotton played the part of Rita in Willy Russell’s famous play at the Crescent Theatre back in 2002. She is now directing the Crescent’s newest Rita, Vicky Youster, another teacher, in the same role from 24 February to 2 March.\n\nEducating Rita, made famous by Julie Walters in the hit film, is a classic of British theatre. Rita, a married hair stylist in her 20s, is hungry for more than her humdrum routine.\n\nShe enrols on a literature course offered by the Open University, and is assigned to Frank, a cynical middle-aged professor, as her tutor. Despite his personal problems, Frank (played by William Hayes) helps Rita to realise her academic potential.\n\nHowever, when Rita’s blue-collar spouse learns that his wife is more interested in education than homemaking, he becomes frustrated by her newfound independence. Will Rita’s new lease of life be threatened?\n\nFi says she is thrilled to revisit the play as the director: “I love Vicky’s energy and honesty. She is such a talent, with natural comic timing.\n\n“Seeing her play the role I played myself makes me wish I could go back to 2002 and play it better, with all the things I have learned from Vicky’s performance.”\n\nMeanwhile, actor Vicky says she sees a lot of herself in Rita: “I relate to Rita in many aspects, and I was interested in playing the role of a woman who has nothing but wants everything.\n\n“Fi is fantastic! She is so passionate about the project, has such good insight and really pushes me to think about all the little details in the script.”\n\nThe Crescent Company presents Educating Rita in the Ron Barber Studio from Saturday 24 February to Saturday 2 March.\n\nThe curtain rises at 7.45pm every day except Sunday 25 February, with matinee performances from 2.45pm on that Sunday and on Saturday 2 March.\n\nThere will also be an After Dark session following the performance on Friday 1 March when members of the cast and creative team will discuss the production.\n\nTickets are priced from £12.00, with a student discount available on Tuesday and Wednesday.\n\nAddress: Crescent Theatre, 20 Sheepcote Street, Brindleyplace, Birmingham, B16 8AE.\n\nTicket link: https://bit.ly/3QAMPqj\n\nWebsite: https://www.crescent-theatre.co.uk/\n\nTwitter/ Instagram: @crescenttheatre\n\nBox Office: 0121 643 5858 Email: boxoffice@crescent-theatre.co.uk\n\nENDS"
