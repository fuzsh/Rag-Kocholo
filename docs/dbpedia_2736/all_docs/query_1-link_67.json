        "text": "Educating Rita\n\nby Willy Russell\n\nDirected by Jan Meyer\n\nWest End Players Guild\n\nFebruary 18, 2016\n\nI was told many years ago, when I was in college, that I had to see Educating Rita. My friend and fellow English major was referring to the 1983 film, which I still haven’t seen. I kept meaning to see it, but for some reason I never got around to it. West End Players Guild is currently presenting Willy Russell’s play, and I’ve had a chance to see it. Now, I don’t know why I waited so long.\n\nThis is a story that anyone who has studied English literature needs to see, and there’s a lot to like for general audiences, as well. It’s a well-constructed play with two strongly defined characters who both learn valuable lessons as a result of their interactions. The setting is a university in Northern England, where Frank (Tom Kopp) is a professor. He’s middle-aged, tired, not a little jaded, and fond of booze. He’s started tutoring as part of the school’s Open University program not because he really wants to, but because he needs the money. His first student is a bright, brassy 26-year-old hairdresser who calls herself Rita (Maggie Wininger)–after author Rita Mae Brown–although her given name is Susan. Rita isn’t the kind of student Frank was expecting. She doesn’t just want to get by. She wants to learn, and she wants to learn everything she can. Through the course of the play, we see Rita’s progression from a determined beginner to a more accomplished student, and we see Frank’s struggle to be a real teacher again, and to encourage Rita to find her own voice and make her own choices rather than being a crowd-follower, either in the working-class circles in which she initially runs, or with the more “cultured” academics to whom she is increasingly drawn.\n\nThe play presents a realistic journey of discovery and identity for both Rita and Frank. Rita’s desire to learn and to pass her exams and write the way she’s expected to write competes with Frank’s increasing fascination with her, and his desire for her to not lose her own distinctive voice in the effort to improve herself. The actors both do a wonderful job portraying these richly drawn characters. Wininger’s Rita is bold, clearly intelligent even though she lacks in formal education, and deeply determined to succeed. Wininger portrays Rita’s outgoing personality as well as her sense of self-doubt and shame about her background with convincing energy. Kopp’s Frank gains energy from his interactions with Wininger, and their tutoring sessions sparkle with wit and a real sense of affection. One thing that I especially liked about this play was that the relationship between Frank and Rita isn’t romantic. Although Frank is clearly attracted to Rita, their relationship is more complex precisely because it remains platonic. These are two characters who are at turns likable and difficult, although the sense of hope is what prevails throughout. Both Wininger and Kopp manage reasonably convincing English accents that aren’t flawless, but are consistent enough as to not be distracting. It’s their genuine sense of affection that shines through, especially.\n\nAll the literary references from authors ranging from E.M. Forster, to Shakespeare, to William Blake and more help to make the play’s academic setting convincing. The conflicts present in this play–and particularly the quest to really learn and not just parrot ideas–are real for many at various levels of academia, from those who `only took a few classes to those who hold a bachelor’s degree, master’s, or PhD. Rita’s joy of learning, and Frank’s conflict between apathy and a desire to really teach are what give this play its impact. Russell’s script is funny, smart, and engaging, and its well staged on West End’s little stage in the basement at Union Avenue Christian Church.\n\nIt’s rare that a WEPG only uses the stage, and not also the floor in front of the stage. That choice works well here, as Destiny Graham’s marvelously detailed set convincingly re-creates a university professor’s bookshelf-lined office. Tracey Newcomb-Margrave designed the costumes that not only suit the characters well, but actually help to tell the story. Rita’s transition from hairdresser to academic is reflected in her progressively more sophisticated–and less bold–style of dress. Renee Sevier-Monsey’s lighting, Mary Beth Winslow’s sound design, and Anna Blair’s props also contribute to the convincing academic atmosphere of the play.\n\nEducating Rita is an education in itself. This thoroughly engrossing and entertaining play teaches valuable lessons about life as well as academia. At West End Players Guild, these lessons are taught with charm and clarity. I’m glad I finally got to see this play."
