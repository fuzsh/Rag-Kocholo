        "text": "\"Educating Rita\" by Willy Russell is a play based on one working class\n\nwomen's struggle to become educated. The play has just two characters,\n\nRita, the women seeking an education and Frank, her designated tutor.\n\nOne of the play's main themes is the emotional and social changes that\n\noccur as the play, and Rita's education, progresses.\n\nIn this essay I will write from a director's viewpoint how I think\n\ncertain scenes of the play should be performed. I have selected act\n\none scenes one and three and act two scene four as I think these\n\nscenes represent the changes in the two characters throughout the\n\nplay.\n\nAct 1 Scene 1\n\n=============\n\nI chose this scene as I think it shows the contrasts between the two\n\ncharacters when they first meet. The whole play is performed inside\n\nFrank's office with only two characters, Frank and Rita ever\n\ninteracting on stage. I think though, that it would help the audience\n\nvisually, when either character is describing a past memory or event,\n\nif the characters from this situation came onto the stage and act out\n\nthese mentioned experiences (with no sound) as they are told.\n\nThe layout of the office should be very simple, there are three walls,\n\nthe fourth is taken out so that the audience has a \"fly on the wall\"\n\nviewpoint. The door is stage right and leads straight off stage.\n\nFrank's desk is in the far corner of the room with a large window\n\nbehind it. At the start of this scene Frank moves around his office\n\nwith a dim spotlight on him. Bookcases are laced across each wall. The\n\ndoor leads off stage this is to add an element curiosity and surprise\n\nwhen Rita first knocks on the door. When this incident occurs another\n\nlight should be concentrated straight at the door. Rita then proceeds\n\nto bang on the door to try to open it; Frank simply says, \"come in\"\n\nrepeatedly. This sequence is critical in representing the play's main"
