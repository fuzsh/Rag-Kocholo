        "text": "- Afternoon, sir.\n\n- Good afternoon.\n\nIn dealing with this, Dr Bryant,\n\ndo you think it's wise to pursue the\n\nmetaphysical nature of Blake's poetry?\n\nDr Bryant!\n\nMm?\n\nI was asking, Doctor,\n\nif you think that in approaching Blake\n\nwe should pursue\n\nthe metaphysical aspect of his poetry.\n\nMost definitely.\n\nBlake. They all get\n\nso worked up about him.\n\nBlake. Do you know what he is?\n\nHe is a dead poet. That's all.\n\nI'm sorry, Dr Bryant, but I can't agree.\n\nTo dismiss William Blake\n\nas a dead poet is \"faseel\".\n\nFacile.\n\nI've studied Blake extremely closely\n\nover a number of years\n\nand I absolutely disagree\n\nwith your appraisal of his genius.\n\nDr Bryant,\n\nI don't think you're listening to me.\n\nMr Collins, I don't think\n\nyou're saying anything to me.\n\n- Doctor, are you drunk?\n\n- Drunk?\n\nOf course I'm drunk.\n\nYou don't really expect me\n\nto teach this when I'm sober?\n\nWell, then you won't mind...\n\nif I leave your tutorial.\n\nWhy should I mind? What do you want\n\nto be stuck in here for anyway?\n\nBecause we want to study literature.\n\nLiterature?\n\nLook - the sun is shining!\n\nYou're all young!\n\nWhat are you doing in here?\n\nWhy don't you all go and do something?\n\nGo out and make love or something.\n\nFrank.\n\n- Julia.\n\n- Darling, can I have the car keys?\n\nYeah. Has your class finished?\n\nAges ago. Don't forget -\n\nBrian and Elaine for supper.\n\n- Now, you do know I'm gonna be late.\n\n- No.\n\nDarling, I told you,\n\nI've got a new student coming.\n\n- What time?\n\n- Open University, very late.\n\nThough why a grown adult\n\nshould want to come to this place\n\nafter putting in a hard day's labour\n\nis beyond me.\n\nDr Bryant?\n\nHe actually said, \"What is assonance?\"\n\nReally?\n\nHe didn't have a clue\n\nwhat assonance was!\n\nEr, come in.\n\nCome in!\n\nFor God's sake, come in!\n\nI'm comin' in, aren't I? You wanna get\n\nthat bleedin' handle fixed.\n\nEr, yes, yes, I meant to.\n\nNo good meaning to,\n\nyou wanna get on with it.\n\nOne day you'll be shouting, \"Come in,\"\n\nand it'll go on forever\n\ncos the poor sod won't be able to get in\n\nand you won't be able to get out.\n\n- And you are...?\n\n- I'm a what?\n\n- Pardon?\n\n- What?\n\nAnd you are...?\n\nWhat is your name?\n\nMe first name?\n\nWell, that would constitute\n\nsome sort of start.\n\n- Rita.\n\n- Rita. Ah.\n\nHere we are.\n\nRita? It says here Mrs S White.\n\nOh, yes, that's S for Susan.\n\nThat's just me real name.\n\nBut I'm not a Susan any more,\n\nI've changed me name to Rita.\n\n- You know, after Rita Mae Brown?\n\n- No.\n\nRita Mae Brown\n\nwho wrote Rubyfruit Jungle.\n\nHaven't you read it?\n\nIt's a fantastic book, you know.\n\nDo you wanna lend it?\n\nYes, yes. Well, thank you very much.\n\nOK.\n\nAnd what do they call you round here?\n\nSir.\n\nBut you may call me Frank.\n\nOK. Frank.\n\nThat's a nice picture, isn't it, Frank?\n\n- Er, yes, I suppose it is.\n\n- It's very erotic.\n\nI don't think I've looked at that picture\n\nin ten years.\n\nBut yes, it is, I suppose so.\n\nThere's no suppose about it,\n\nlook at those tits.\n\nDo you mind me using words like that?\n\n- Like what?\n\n- Tits.\n\n- No.\n\n- No, you wouldn't.\n\nIt's only the masses\n\nwho don't understand.\n\nIt's not their fault\n\nbut sometimes I hate them.\n\nI do it to shock them sometimes.\n\nYou know, like, when I'm\n\nin the hairdresser's, where I work,\n\nI'll say something like,\n\n\"I'm really f***ed,\" dead loud\n\nand it doesn't half cause a fuss.\n\nBut educated people\n\ndon't worry, do they?\n\nIt's the aristocracy that swears most.\n\nIt's all \"Pass me the f***ing pheasant,\"\n\nwith them.\n\nBut you couldn't tell them that\n\nround our way.\n\n- Aren't you interviewing me?\n\n- Do I need to?\n\nOh, I talk too much, don't I?\n\nYeah, I know I talk a lot.\n\nI don't at home but I don't often get\n\nthe chance to talk to someone like you.\n\nWould you like to sit down?\n\n- No. Can I smoke?\n\n- Tobacco?\n\nWhat? Yeah!\n\n- Was that a joke?\n\n- Yes.\n\n- 'Ere y'are, do you want one?\n\n- I'd like one...\n\n- but I promised not to smoke.\n\n- I won't tell anyone.\n\nPromise?\n\nI hate smokin' on me own. Everyone\n\nseems to have packed up these days.\n\nAll afraid of getting cancer.\n\nBloody cowards.\n\n- Would you like a drink?\n\n- What of?\n\n- Whisky.\n\n- Oh, yeah.\n\nMy mate's got a drinks cabinet like that.\n\nTell me, what made you\n\nsuddenly decide to do this?\n\nIt's not sudden. I've been realising\n\nfor ages that I'm out of step.\n\nI'm 26, I should've had a baby by now.\n\nEveryone expects it.\n\nBut I mean, I don't want a baby yet. No.\n\nI wanna discover meself first.\n\nDo you understand that?\n\n- Yes.\n\n- Yeah.\n\nI've, you know, I've tried to explain it\n\nto me husband, you know,\n\nbut, between you and me,\n\nI think he's thick.\n\nWell, he doesn't want to see, yeah.\n\n- What's this like?\n\n- Howards End?\n\nHowards End! Sounds filthy, doesn't it?\n\nEM Foster.\n\n- Forster.\n\n- Oh, yeah.\n\n- What's it like?\n\n- Read it. Would you like to borrow it?\n\nYeah, all right. I'll look after it for you.\n\nIf I pack the course in, I'll post it back.\n\nYou haven't even started yet.\n\nWhy would you pack it in?\n\nWell, I just might, you know.\n\nMight think it was a soft idea.\n\n- What does assonance mean?\n\n- What?\n\n- Don't laugh at me.\n\n- Er, no.\n\nErm, assonance, it's a form of rhyme.\n\nErm, what's an example?\n\nDo you know Yeats?\n\n- The wine lodge?\n\n- No, WB Yeats, the poet.\n\nNo.\n\nWell, in his poem\n\nThe Wild Swans At Coole,\n\nYeats rhymes the word \"swan\"\n\nwith the word \"stone\".\n\nYou see?\n\nThat's an example of assonance.\n\nOoh, yeah,\n\nmeans getting the rhyme wrong.\n\nI've never thought of it like that\n\nbut I suppose it does mean\n\ngetting the rhyme wrong.\n\nI love this room.\n\nI love the view from this window.\n\nDo you like it?\n\nI don't often consider it.\n\nI sometimes get the urge\n\nto throw something through it.\n\n- What?\n\n- A student, usually.\n\nYou're bleedin' mad, aren't ya?\n\nProbably.\n\nWhat are you lookin' at?\n\nAre you a good ladies' hairdresser, Rita?\n\nYeah, I am. But they expect\n\ntoo much, you know.\n\nLike, women come in the hairdresser's\n\nand half an hour later\n\nthey wanna walk out a different person.\n\nYou know, but I mean,\n\nif you wanna change,\n\nyou've got to do it from the inside,\n\nhaven't you, like I'm trying to do.\n\nDo you think I'll be able to learn?\n\nAre you sure you're serious\n\nabout wanting to learn?\n\nI'm dead serious, yeah.\n\nI know I take the piss\n\nbut that's only because\n\nI'm not, well, confident, like.\n\nBut I want to be. Honest.\n\nWhen, you know, when do you actually\n\nstart teaching me, like?\n\nWhat can I teach you?\n\nEverything.\n\nYou want a lot.\n\nAnd I can't give it.\n\nBetween you and me and the walls,\n\nactually I am an appalling teacher.\n\nThat's all right most of the time -\n\nappalling teaching is quite in order\n\nfor my appalling students\n\nbut it is not good enough for you,\n\nyoung woman.\n\nAll I know is -\n\nand you must listen to this -\n\nall I know is that I know\n\nabsolutely nothing.\n\nAnd besides, I don't like the hours\n\nof this Open University business.\n\nThey expect me to teach\n\nwhen the pubs are open.\n\nIt's all right.\n\nThere are other tutors, good ones.\n\nI will arrange one for you.\n\nAre you saying you want me to go?\n\nGoodbye, Rita.\n\nWait a minute. Listen to me.\n\nI'm on this course, you are my tutor"
