        "text": "About four months after exploring student-teacher relationships with David Mamet’s “Oleanna,” Third Avenue Playhouse revisits the idea from a different angle, and with a lighter touch, when its in-house Stage Door Theater Co. presents “Educating Rita” from July 9 to 25.\n\nWhile “Oleanna” was an issue-driven drama focused on a power struggle between an imperious male professor and a female student who may not have been as naive as seemed, “Educating Rita” is a comedy about a young hairdresser who seeks to improve her life by returning to college, where she develops a passion for literature and exerts an influence on her disillusioned, alcoholic professor.\n\nWritten by English playwright Willy Russell on a commission from the Royal Shakespeare Company, “... Rita” premiered in London in 1980. Russell also adapted it for the screen, and the 1983 movie starring Michael Caine and Julia Walters (who was reprising her role from the stage production) earned Academy Award nominations for the two actors, as well as Russell for Best Adapted Screenplay. Caine and Walters did win Golden Globe and BAFTA (British film industry) awards or Best Actor/Actress for their roles.\n\nTAP co-artistic director Robert Boles will direct Katherine Duffy and Drew Brhel in this two-person comedy.\n\nDuffy was last seen as Sybil in “Private Lives” last fall at TAP and returns as this summer’s artist-in-residence. She made her professional debut as Crissy in Skylight Music Theater’s production of “Hair” in Milwaukee and spent this season at Milwaukee Repertory Theatre appearing in “A Christmas Carol” in addition to understudying roles in “Harvey,” “Good People” and all the roles in the one-woman show “The Amish Project.” Duffy will be in “Steel Magnolias,” “Sylvia” and “Irving Berlin’s I Love A Piano” later this season at TAP.\n\nBrhel returns to the TAP stage for a third time after appearing in “Talley’s Folly” and “The Fantasticks” last summer. In his 30-year career Brhel has been a regular member of several Milwaukee theater companies, with favorite roles including and Emil in “Three Viewings” at Next Act Theatre, Bobchinsky in “The Government Inspector” and Fezziwig/Topper in “A Christmas Carol” at Milwaukee Rep, Richard Greatham in “Hay Fever” at Milwaukee Chamber Theatre, and Herr Schultz in “Cabaret” at Skylight. Brhel is also an eight-season veteran of American Players Theatre in Spring Green and has appeared in Shakespeare festivals from coast to coast.\n\n“Educating Rita” runs from July 9 to 25 in the Studio Theater at Third Avenue Playhouse, 239 N. Third Ave., Sturgeon Bay. Show times are at 7:30 p.m. Wednesdays through Saturdays and 2 p.m. Sundays, along with a special Tuesday show at 7:30 p.m. July 21. General admission tickets are $25 for adults, $10 students. For tickets or more information, visit the TAP box office, 234 N. Third Ave. (across the street from the theater), call (920) 743-1760 or go to www.thirdavenueplayhouse.com.\n\nChristopher Clough is the editor of Your Key to the Door Weekly.
