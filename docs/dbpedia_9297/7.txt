Irving Gordon, a composer who wrote the Grammy-winning Unforgettable and the recently revived Prelude to a Kiss, has died at age 81.

Mr. Gordon, who also wrote the classic comedy routine Who's on First? made famous by Abbott and Costello, died Sunday.

He earned the song-of-the-year Grammy in 1992 after Natalie Cole included Unforgettable in her album of duets with original recordings by her late father, Nat "King" Cole.

Mr. Gordon conceded he didn't think too much of his song when he wrote it in 1951. He quickly changed his mind when Cole made it one of his signature hits.

"It's nice to have a song come out that doesn't scream, yell and have a nervous breakdown while it talks about tenderness," he told a New York audience when he received the Grammy. "People . . . want a melody. They want to be able to sing a song."

Mr. Gordon wrote Prelude to a Kiss, giving title and lyrics to a tune by Duke Ellington, while riding a New York subway in the late 1930s. Half a century later, the song enjoyed renewed popularity in connection with the play and motion picture of the same title.

Clever with titles, Mr. Gordon wrote the song Throw Momma From the Train, which was recorded by Patti Page in 1956. In recent years, the title headed a Danny DeVito film.
