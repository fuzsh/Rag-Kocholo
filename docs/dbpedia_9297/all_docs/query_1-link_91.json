        "text": "Films of the 1940s\n\nGordon attended Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, and then Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut. In 1935 he joined the Group Theatre in New York City and became its stage manager. He was also involved with the leftist film groups Nykino and its successor Frontier Films. He began in Hollywood in 1940 as a film editor and dialogue coach at Columbia Pictures. His first directing credits were such B-film series entries as Boston Blackie Goes Hollywood and Underground Agent (both 1942), followed by One Dangerous Night and Crime Doctor (both 1943).\n\nThose films were capable if undistinguished, and Gordon returned to directing theatre in New York. However, when he moved to Universal-International Pictures after World War II, he found a more-respectable class of assignments awaiting him. The first was The Web (1947), a film noir starring such genre icons as Edmond O’Brien, Vincent Price, Ella Raines, and William Bendix; Gordon handled its convoluted plot with facility. But instead of continuing in that vein, he was handed the prestige project Another Part of the Forest (1948), playwright Lillian Hellman’s prequel to The Little Foxes (1941), with the impressive cast of O’Brien, Fredric March, and Dan Duryea.\n\nAn Act of Murder (1948), a drama about euthanasia, used March and O’Brien again, and The Lady Gambles (1949) was a showcase for Barbara Stanwyck, who played a compulsive gambler. The thriller Woman in Hiding (1950) was a critical disappointment, but Cyrano de Bergerac (1950) was a distinguished production that should have vaulted Gordon to the top rank of directors—particularly after José Ferrer won an Academy Award for his performance as Cyrano. But after making two films for Twentieth Century-Fox in 1951—the garment industry drama I Can Get It for You Wholesale with Susan Hayward and The Secret of Convict Lake, a western suspense film with Gene Tierney—Gordon was named as a former Communist Party member by directors Edward Dmytryk and Frank W. Tuttle in HUAC testimony. Gordon invoked the Fifth Amendment when called before the HUAC, and he was blacklisted from the film industry until he testified cooperatively before the committee in 1958. During his exile from Hollywood, he directed plays on Broadway.\n\nAfter the blacklist\n\nWhen Hollywood invited Gordon back, he was fortunate enough to be given the sprightly romantic comedy Pillow Talk (1959), considered the best of the enormously popular Rock Hudson–Doris Day films. Portrait in Black (1960) was a melodrama starring Lana Turner, whereas Boys’ Night Out (1962) was a farce with a deft cast (James Garner, Kim Novak, and Tony Randall). For Love or Money (1963) showcased a rare comic turn by Kirk Douglas, and Move Over, Darling (1963) was a remake of the 1940 screwball comedy My Favorite Wife.\n\nTexas Across the River (1966) was a comic western with Rat Pack members Dean Martin and Joey Bishop, and The Impossible Years (1968), based on the Broadway play, placed David Niven in a comedy about a psychologist in conflict with his headstrong teenage daughter. How Do I Love Thee? (1970), a generation-gap drama starring Jackie Gleason and Maureen O’Hara, was unsuccessful. It brought to an end Gordon’s film career, which had taut drama in the first half, light comedy in the second.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

In 1971 he became a professor in the theatre department at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), from which he retired in 1990.\n\nMichael Barson"
