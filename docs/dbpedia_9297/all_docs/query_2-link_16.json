WHILE HE'S WATCHING WHEEL! OF! FORTUNE! Am I done stating my point?! DOM! I'M GONNA NEED VERBAL CONFIRMATION THAT YOU'RE GRASPING THE DETAILS OF THIS AGREEMENT! ”\n\n— Otto Irving killing Ernesto Santiago and threatening Dominique into becoming an FBI mole for the Dark Army.\n\nOtto Irving is a high-level Dark Army operative.\n\nHe was portrayed by Bobby Cannavale.\n\nHistory[]\n\nIrving owns a car dealership in addition to being a high-ranking member of the Dark Army based in New York. He appears to be a fan of the NY Mets, watching Big Brother, and is working on a novel. He claims to have had a wife and sons, but this was a lie.\n\nIrving was a former consigliere for the Whiterose and her former right-hand man. The Whiterose gave Irving many privileges compared to other Dark Army members such as letting him kill their law enforcement mole Ernesto Santiago without good reason or permission and letting him take \"overdue sabbatical\" that he had kept talking about and leave to Barbados in the middle of important project. He was also able directly disobey the Whiterose current right-hand man Grant's order to stay and instead he told Grant that he was in Grant's position years ago and he has done his time.\n\nSeason 3[]\n\nOutside the arcade on 5/9, Irving arrives where two Dark Army soldiers are waiting, one of whom he sold a car. He looks at the Wellick SUV as they inform him Tyrell Wellick and Elliot Alderson arrived shortly after 9PM. Irving reminds them of the drill: he monologues and they hold off on the guns. The DA men put on their masks. Inside, Mr. Robot is explaining the paper records recovery program when Irving arrives, identifying Tyrell. Mr. Robot asks who they are. Tyrell glances at the gun on the table, prompting the Dark Army to pull out theirs. Irving asks Tyrell if anyone saw him here or knows about it. He asks for his keys and phone. Irving gives Mr. Robot an address and tells him to drop off the SUV and go home. As Mr. Robot objects, Irving says if they’re seeing him, they must’ve fucked up. Tyrell’s honeypot contact James contacted Gideon Goddard to spill the beans. Irving says Tyrell will be the FBI's most wanted and offers to keep him out of jail. Mr. Robot urges him to go with them.\n\nThey drive to a cabin in the middle of a heavily wooded area. Tyrell asks how long he must stay, but Irving isn't sure. Irving says there can be ways arranged to contact his wife, but Tyrell rejects it, wanting to keep them both safe. Irving is leaving, promising to check on him in a couple days, to which Tyrell protests in need of working with Elliot. That’s be worked on. Tyrell asks for the gun back. Irving assures him the 37 acres of surrounding land is guarded by sensors and cameras.\n\nOn June 16th, Tyrell receives a call from prison. Elliot is on the other line, to Tyrell’s relief. Irving is in the other room listening to an audio book as Tyrell freaks out. Irving enters and notes his frustration. Tyrell says Elliot was acting strange. Irving brings Tyrell outside and shows him how to chop wood. Tyrell wants to get back to work, but Irving warns him he may lose his mind up here alone. Tyrell is proficient at using the ax, having done it as a child, although he hated it. Over the next days, Tyrell devises Stage 2 while also watching his son on a baby camera. He continues to chop wood.\n\nOn July 3, Cisco gets in a car with Gao Xun and Irving after being given the femtocell by Darlene Alderson. He warns Cisco that Darlene has always been a job and that she is protected and he isn't. Stop caring about her, trust me. Cisco hands over the backpack and get out. At the cabin, Tyrell is coding the femtocell. Irving urges him that it has to go back to the city. Tyrell notices that there is code not for Stage 2, but to hack the FBI's phones. Tyrell says he should be working with Elliot and gives the backpack to Irving.\n\nAfter retrieving Tyrell from the back of a cop car when he went into town, Santiago rants at Irving after having to solve a \"math problem\" to find the cabin. They were lucky he combed the area and made sure all calls went to him, but he wasn't planning on killing a cop. There's already heat on him at work, having dodged the China shootout and Operation Berenstein blowing up in the FBI's face. Santiago calls Irving's boss a maniac and that no one cares about him. As he leaves, he tells Tyrell not to let this happen again. He leaves. Irving comes in and hands Tyrell an icepack for his thumb. He dismisses Santiago as a snake and sits down. He wonders what the incident was about and notes that he and Tyrell are alike: married to their jobs. Irving recounts that his boys were everything, but his wife left him and took them. He had been lost and after chopping a whole lot of wood, he realized he needed them. He wants to be a good provider so that he can go home, be greeted by his kids at the door, and watch Big Brother. He tells Tyrell he can be greeted by his family after a long day. Tyrell wants to appear as someone strong and capable to Joanna, and by working with Elliot and completing the mission can he achieve that. Irving asks for a few more weeks before he sees him.\n\nIrving arrives at his car dealership and talks to a salesman about losing a sale. He shows him his coffee thermos, #1 dad, as something to relate to the customer. The salesman notes that Irving doesn't have kids. Irving gives him the mug just as a prop. As home, Irving has many mugs with different slogans. He watches Big Brother alone and works on his novel, Beach Towel, chuckling at his own work. At prison, Irving meets with Leon, who takes joy in killing Neo nazis. He says Elliot got his papers and is bound to be released. Leon advises Elliot get laid to unwind him. At the cabin, Irving tells Tyrell to get packed as Elliot is being released. Tyrell smiles and gets his stuff, taking one last look at his room.\n\nThey arrive at the warehouse outside the E-Corp tower. Tyrell says it’s perfect and Elliot will love it. Irving gives Tyrell the gun back, noting that it was jammed with a squib and the next shot would've blown a hand off, but he took care of it. That night, Irving brings Tyrell to the Fukan Hotel, a Dark Army controlled building. Irving says they reached out to Elliot and are waiting for him to respond. Tyrell will wait in the hotel room, away from the windows, until it’s time to meet at the rendezvous and give the taxi the address. (“eps3.2_legacy.so”)\n\nOn August 8th, Irving is at a Red Wheelbarrow BBQ and has his punch card completed at the register. He debates with the cashier after she refuses to give him a free milkshake until his next visit, arguing the semantics of the issue. Irving receives a call on his bluetooth, calming the screaming man on the other end and promising to be there in 15 minutes. Irving leaves the restaurant, telling the cashier that without principles, there is only chaos.\n\nIrving soon arrives at a warehouse near Chambers and Church, where Tyrell is attending to Elliot's gunshot wound. Irving takes pictures, later sent to Minister Zhang, and assures the frantic Tyrell that the doctors are coming and pushing down on the wound doesn't help. Afterwards, Irving puts his dealership card under the wiper of another car before getting into his own. On a phone call, he is given the name of Angela Moss.\n\nSix days later, August 14th, Irving picks up Elliot and Darlene in a taxi cab after they are apprehended by Dark Army soldiers at a hacker gathering during a city wide blackout. Irving notices am FBI tail following them and, impersonating a Detective Robert Abernathy, uses On Star to disable the pursuing vehicle with the assistance of the Aldersons. He takes them to a Red Wheelbarrow BBQ and asks Darlene to buy them food and punch his ticket card. She refuses, but acquiesces to Elliot to leave them alone. Irving notes that Elliot should be resting, only to be met with Elliot boasting that he shut down the backdoor to be used in Stage 2. Irving says their boss will be disappointed, but she believes a plan lives and dies with its creator. Irving wants to go home and work on his book. Elliot wants confirmation that Stage 2 is off, to which Irving says they can put the bullet back in Elliot.\n\nIn the middle of the that night, Angela brings Mr. Robot to a cellar where Irving is waiting. He wonders how she changed Elliot's mind and notes that he didn't seem to recognize him earlier. Angela says recovering from his wound messed with Elliot's head and that she was brought in to manage him. Irving reminds her of Whiterose's punctuality and asks if Mr. Robot is ready. He brings the two of them into another room where Tyrell is sitting on a bed. Tyrell tries to explain himself to Mr. Robot, but is forgiven regardless. Mr. Robot goes to work on a computer to re-establish access into E-Corp's network. (“eps3.0_power-saver-mode.h”)\n\nAfter the Dark Army simultaneously destroys 71 E-Corp facilities across the country, Mr. Robot arrives at Irving's auto shop, demanding an explanation. Instead, Irving orders his men to knock him out. By the time Mr. Robot comes to, Irving is escorting him uptown in his car. Once they stop, Mr. Robot once more demands to know why the Dark Army twisted his revolution. Irving simply points to a party at a nearby penthouse, explaining that the wealthy \"1%\" are the real founders of fsociety. He then heads across the street, explaining he has to cover up the death of a mistress.\n\nA few days later, Elliot approaches Irving in the middle of a car deal and asks him to set up a meeting with the Whiterose.\n\nEventually, as Elliot investigates Santiago's apartment to find Darlene, Irving arrives, advising Elliot to come with him. Irving escorts Elliot to a barn outside the city, where Santiago, his informant in the FBI, has already captured Darlene and Agent Dominique DiPierro. Santiago explains that DiPierro had discovered his role as a mole and threatened to turn him in. Unhappy with this, Irving escorts Santiago and DiPierro outside. Santiago pleads with Irving to spare his agent. Instead, Irving brutally axes him to death and threatens DiPierro into taking his place.\n\nSeason 4[]\n\nIrving makes a brief cameo in the fourth season. He happens to meet Dominique at a book shop. He tells her that he is happy to see her and reveals that he has written a book titled Beach Towel. At first, Dominique is scared, but she calms down later when Irving tells her that the Dark Army holds no grudge against her for killing the Dark Army agent Janice. He tells her that he's happy that Dominique murdered Janice because she was insane and a disgrace to the organization. He gives Dominique a signed copy of Beach Towel, only to tell a worker in the shop that she \"still needs to pay\". He then leaves and tells Dom to take care of herself.\n\nPersonality[]\n\nIrving is an enigma. However, his actions show that his loyalties lie first and foremost with the Dark Army, from helping save Elliot's life to harboring the fugitive Tyrell Wellick. He seems to have a fondness for barbecue ribs, particularly from the Red Wheelbarrow restaurant, and frequents the establishment often.\n\nDespite his loyalty, he has no problems with lying to Tyrell about having past children and manipulating him into revealing information to the Dark Army, so it is unknown how much of his loyalty is true loyalty.\n\nQuotes[]\n\n“ Cashier: Looks like you're gonna get a free milkshake, you lucky dog!\n\nOtto Irving: I'll take chocolate please.\n\nCashier: Oh, sorry sir. That offer is only valid on your next visit.\n\nOtto Irving: I don't understand. Didn't you just say I could have a free milkshake?\n\nCashier: Yes, and you can redeem it on your next visit.\n\nOtto Irving: But what's the difference between then and now?\n\nCashier: I'm sorry sir, that's just not the way it works.\n\nOtto Irving: Ok. Should I just get outta line then get back in?\n\nCashier: No you can redeem it on your next visit here.\n\nOtto Irving: Ok, what qualifies as a visit? Do I have to leave only to come back? Or do I have to go home? Is it time based... You see the faulty logic here don't you?\n\nCashier: Sir, those are the rules. You can speak to the manager or I'll be happy to add a milkshake to your order for 12 dollars and 95 cents.\n\nOtto Irving: It's not about the money. It's about the principle.\n\nCashier: Sir, there's nothing I can do.\n\n[Irving gets call from Tyrell]\n\nOtto Irving: Aha.\n\nOtto Irving: Well, screaming isn't gonna help the situation is it. Aha. Yeah well, I agree. It's not good. Is he dead?! Aha. Alright. Be there in 15 minutes.\n\n[The call ends]\n\nOtto Irving: When we lose our principles, we invite chaos. ”\n\n— Otto Irving expecting a milkshake\n\n“ Just 'cause we lit the fuse, doesn't mean we control the explosion. ”\n\n— Otto Irving\n\n“ A story could have a mediocre beginning and middle, and oftentimes it does. But always gotta have a wow ending. Otherwise, what's the point?! ”\n\n— Otto Irving\n\nTrivia[]\n\nIrving's first name is revealed to be \"Otto\" in Sam Esmail's latest film Leave the World Behind.\n\nDespite being a prominent fixer for the Dark Army, Irving also sells used cars for a living. It is completely unknown how many people buy his cars as well as how much he earns for it.\n\nIrving claims that the character in his novel \"strangles his mother to death in chapter twelve\", which the novels contents draw from Irving's real life experiences, meaning that Irving may have murdered his own mother.\n\nWhile his house isn't very explicitly shown, it can be presumed to be a villa.\n\nGallery[]\n\nSee also[]"
