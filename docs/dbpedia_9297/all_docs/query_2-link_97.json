        "text": "Irving Eugene Gordon died Saturday January 1st, 2022, peacefully at his home surrounded by his wife, Charlotte Jeanette Gaston -Gordon, sister Joyse Marshall, sister Mariah Nelson, sister Mary L Jones, and Elise Napier.\n\nGene was born in Brooklyn New York, August 2, 1930. His parents were, Jeanette E. Wattley-Gordon and George Gordon. He was the oldest of five children. He is survived by his sister, Ms. Camille Holmes of Bronx, New York and many nieces and nephews. He was a loving husband and father to his children. He retired from the Metropolitan Transit Authority in Brooklyn New York. He was a bus driver and enjoyed his job. He also was a Veteran in the United States Army.\n\nOn May 25, 1975 he dedicated his life to Jehovah and was baptized as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses. He loved going out in field service and talked to anyone who would listen about Jehovah and His promises for mankind. Gene and Charlotte remarried on June 30, 2006. Brother Washington Drayton performed the marriage ceremony. We celebrated fourteen years of marriage on June 30, 2021.\n\nGene loved to dance and was a very dapper and a stylish dresser. His family nickname was, “Sonny” but he was also known as “Gene Gene the Dancing Machine”. One of his favorite Kingdom melodies was “How Does it Make You Feel”, and he would start dancing.\n\nThe Gordon Family would like to thank all those who helped Gene in his time of need. They also were a source of strength for me. I am truly grateful for all everyone has done, all brothers and sisters for the love, prayers, and help, for family members, and neighbors. Ms. Latriese Davis and her aunt Ms. Brenda Price and all her staff at Compassinate Home Health Care. Compassius Hospice, all the nurses, CNA’s and staff.\n\nGene will be missed by many. I truly miss him. I pray to Jehovah that I will see him again."
