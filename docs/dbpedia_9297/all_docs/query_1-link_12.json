        "text": "Irving Gordon papers consist primarily of correspondence, printed and scrapbook material dealing with social and business affairs of both the national and local Workmen's Circle (1960-1970). The bulk of the papers describe the collection of books and sports equipment by the Atlanta and Miami Beach branches (1960-1965) for distribution abroad by the U. S. Information Agency as part of its \"People-To-People\" Program. Correspondents include U.S.I.A. Director Benjamin R. Stickney and Local Workmen's Circle Chairman Harold Bauman. A brief correspondence outlines business arrangements of Gordon Opticians with trade unions (1970). Included also are correspondence, reports, minutes and budgets concerning financial and membership matters of the Jewish Labor Committee (1966-1968).\n\nGeorgia State University is the owner of the physical collection and makes reproductions available for research, subject to the copyright law of the United States and item condition.
