        "text": "BOSTON -- Roughly 40 minutes north of where the New England Patriots got their season back on track on Sunday, the Boston Celtics played a preseason game against the Charlotte Hornets.\n\nThe game itself was inconsequential. Despite a close score, both teams played third units in the fourth quarter. Save for the end-of-the-bench guys and two-way players who shined in the closing minutes -- most notably rookie Robert Williams, who showed up early at the Garden to beat Patriots traffic he didn't realize was miles away -- nobody cared much who won (the Celtics beat Charlotte 115-112). And nobody was particularly concerned even though Gordon Hayward finished 1-for-7 from the floor, scoring just four points.\n\nBut for the Celtics, in their healthy encore to an injury decimated season, simply having players on the court mattered. Hayward and Kyrie Irving both returned to the TD Garden on Sunday, both to thunderous ovations even from stands that were half-full.\n\nHayward's struggles continued. They are expected and no cause for concern, but he appeared visibly frustrated as shots he is used to hitting clanked off the rim.\n\nIrving was asked what he says to encourage Hayward, who by his own admission has been struggling with the standard rust a player experiences returning from a year-long injury absence. Irving trailed off briefly, searching for the right words. He began a platitude about not overthinking things when he pulled up short.\n\n\"I just don't really say much to him,\" Irving said, smiling. \"I think Gordon is going to be Gordon. I'm going to continue to say it. He's a consummate professional. Obviously he's coming off the injury, but I think he's doing a great job of working himself back and figuring out the level of play that he needs to play at with our team and where he fits with that.\"\n\nHayward was as level-headed as usual.\n\n\"I did feel a little more comfortable out there,\" Hayward said. \"I think it was great being in front of our own fans for the first time. That was a special feeling for me. Obviously still have a lot of improve on. I think rust is there, for sure, for me, but it was Game 2 after not playing for a year, so it'll come back.\"\n\nCeltics fans were appropriately supportive, waiting with baited breath to cheer for his first field goal throughout the first quarter. But they were forced to wait and wait, and keeping waiting. Hayward did good things -- rebounding, setting solid screens and defending -- but he didn't make his first field goal until the beginning of the second half.\n\nThe Celtics expected rust, and Hayward has exhibited it -- he nearly fouled out in the first half, prompting Brad Stevens to quip that a small part of him was hoping Hayward would because \"I thought that would have been funny.\" No reasonable person -- fan or staffer -- expected Hayward would come out of the gate shooting 40-percent from three or getting to the rim with ease.\n\n\"It's definitely tough, coming back from injury, from anything,\" Irving said. \"Especially being a year off. But like I said, you just try not to overthink it and it's great when you have other good teammates.\"\n\nBut much of what the Celtics hope to accomplish this season hinges on Hayward, and his role on the team is beginning to come into focus a bit. He will almost be a combination of Irving and Al Horford. Like Irving, he can get his own basket and create for others -- burying pull-up 3-pointers and collapsing the defense for kick-outs and drop-offs. Like Horford, he can do a little bit of everything, and he is happy playing a role that makes others better -- screening, rebounding, and cutting off the ball even if it doesn't directly lead to a basket.\n\n\"It's my job as one of the leaders of the team to continue to give him that confidence,\" Irving said. \"Throwing him some plays here and there just to get him back used to the way he's used to playing -- in the middle of the floor, in pick-and-roll, making decisions, smart basketball player that's able to play off the ball, but when he has the ball in his hands, he's able to make plays for others and himself.\"\n\nThe adjustment for Irving has been easier, in part because the time spent on the bench was so much shorter. Irving posted 20 points in 29 minutes, dishing out four assists. He danced around defenders and finished acrobatically at the rim, looking for all the world like the All-NBA candidate who went down in March last year.\n\n\"I'm just grateful to be back out there with my teammates and the fans and just playing again, just having fun,\" Irving said.\n\nPrior to the game, Brad Stevens said he didn't expect anyone to play more than 20 minutes, but he warned reporters not to hold him to that estimation. Sure enough, after Irving hit the 20-minute mark, he told his coach he wanted to remain in the game.\n\nNow the TD Garden shouldn't expect to see him any time soon.\n\n\"I definitely played a better 27 tonight. It felt good. You won't be seeing me on Tuesday,\" Irving said, laughing. \"I got myself going, and you'll see me again in Cleveland.\"\n\nThese games, after all, are inconsequential."
