Prove it. Can you name the top 10 postseason points leaders from the 90s? Give it a shot in NBA Play: Expert Mode.\n\nCircle It: The NBA Finals presented by YouTube TV tip off Thursday at 8:30 ET on ABC.\n\n1. WHAT HAPPENS WHEN 2 STOPPERS AND A (SO FAR) UNSTOPPABLE FORCE MEET?\n\nWasting No Time: In their first year together, Boston‚Äôs Derrick White and Jrue Holiday put up the NBA‚Äôs second-best +/- rating among qualified backcourts.\n\nWho Was First? The guys they‚Äôre playing up against in the NBA Finals, in Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving.\n\nOn Thursday, one of the league‚Äôs premier two-way duos ‚Äî with a penchant for shutting down offenses ‚Äî take on a tandem that‚Äôs shredded everything defenses have thrown their way this postseason.\n\nWhite and Holiday both earned spots on the All-Defensive Second Team this year\n\nThey‚Äôve also put up the best DefRtg and NetRtg among any backcourt with 200 minutes on the court together this postseason\n\nMeanwhile, Kyrie and Luka rank second in NetRtg and OffRtg in that same stretch to play 400+ minutes these Playoffs\n\nSaid White: ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the fun thing about being a guard in the NBA, every night it‚Äôs somebody different and obviously Kyrie and Luka are at the top of that list.‚Äù\n\nMatchups This Year: Dallas‚Äô backcourt held a big edge in two regular-season matchups, putting up 112 combined points to Holiday and White‚Äôs 47.\n\nLuka averaged a triple-double across both games\n\nAcross those games, Doncic went 9-for-11 when matched up with White, and 5-for-8 when matched up with Holiday ‚Äì and added 6 assists\n\nKyrie went 5-for-11 vs. D-White, and 4-for-9 vs. Holiday\n\nThe X Factor: How could having White and Holiday ‚Äì and the adjustments they have coming ‚Äì free up the Celtics‚Äô leading scorers of Tatum and Brown to do what they do on the offensive end?\n\nOver the first three series, the Clippers threw James Harden at Luka and Kyrie for more than 50 combined minutes, SGA for 20, Ant Edwards for 16 and Paul George for 14\n\nWithout needing to chase around two of the game‚Äôs elite scorers, can Tatum and Brown (45% of Boston‚Äôs offense these Playoffs) keep their combined 51ppg pace?\n\nAnd if Holiday & White need to exert more ‚Ä¶ who will pick up their 30 ppg and 27% of Boston‚Äôs offense?\n\nSaid Boston coach Joe Mazzulla about Doncic and Irving: ‚ÄúThere is no ‚Äòstopping‚Äô them. There is defending them at a high level, and there‚Äôs playing a complete game because every part of the game is connected.‚Äù\n\n2. FINALS IN GIFS: THE TWO BACKCOURTS IN ACTION\n\nAs we count down the days to the NBA Finals, peep some of the best defensive work from Boston‚Äôs backcourt duo ‚Ä¶ and Kyrie & Luka giving defenses fits together.\n\n3. 17 YEARS APART, IT‚ÄôS HORFORD & LIVELY‚ÄôS TIME\n\nWhen Al Horford was drafted, bursting out of Florida to become the only unanimous First Team All-Rookie selection in 2007-08, Dereck Lively II was three years old.\n\nThree.\n\nBut going into Thursday‚Äôs NBA Finals Game 1, the 38-year-old Celtics vet ‚Äî who literally turns 38 today ‚Äî and 20-year-old rook have played crucial roles for their teams in their title runs.\n\nHorford‚Äôs set to become the sixth player 38 or older to play in the Finals after averaging 20 mpg or more in the postseason ‚Äì and became the oldest player to hit 7 treys in a Conference Finals game\n\nFor context, Horford‚Äôs more than two years older than his coach, Joe Mazzulla\n\nSaid Horford: ‚ÄúI just feel very grateful to be in this opportunity‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs not easy getting to this position‚Äù\n\nLively, meanwhile, has the highest +/- for a rookie in playoff history ‚Äì behind only Manu Ginobili in 2003\n\nSaid Lively to Mavs.com: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think any of us expected this. I didn‚Äôt expect this. My mama didn‚Äôt expect this. Tyson (Chandler) didn‚Äôt expect this. Jason Kidd didn‚Äôt expect this. They expected me to come to the Dallas Mavericks and learn. And that‚Äôs what I did.‚Äù\n\nMore Than Just Influence: Horford‚Äôs provided a constant, steadying presence for a team looking to write a new chapter in Celtics history. But he‚Äôs also just been really, really good this postseason.\n\nTops On The Team: With Horford on the floor, the Celtics have been 12.7 pts better per 100 possessions than with him off ‚Äì the largest margin of anybody on Boston with 100+ mins\n\nHorford and Holiday rank 3rd in NetRtg among 2-man lineups with 200+ minutes this postseason ‚Ä¶ while Horford and Tatum rank 4th\n\nSaid Horford: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve tried to embody what being a Celtic is about.‚Äù\n\nWhat‚Äôs In A Name: On a team that went from 22nd in DefRtg before the Trade Deadline to 7th after, Lively has provided a constant stream of energy and tenacity to a core of players that‚Äôs been, well, lively.\n\nTops In DefRtg: While P.J. Washington and Daniel Gafford played a huge role in sparking the turnaround, Lively has the best Def. Rating for a player in the Finals (min. 20min)\n\nThat DefRtg ranks him third among all players who reached the Conf Semis or beyond this year, behind only Chet and SGA\n\nThe rook also has the third-best rim protection mark this postseason (49.3 FG%) among players who‚Äôve defended at least 50 shots at the rim\n\nSaid Kidd: ‚ÄúI think one of the things that was caught on camera was [Luka] giving the Western Conference MVP (trophy) to D-Live. And I think that message ‚Äì he understands how important D-Live is to this team.‚Äù\n\n4. JOE MAZZULLA‚ÄôS PATH TO HISTORY\n\nJune 16, 2022: Celtics assistant Joe Mazzulla looks on as the Warriors beat Boston in Game 6 at TD Garden to win the NBA Finals.\n\nMay 27, 2024: Mazzulla, 35, becomes the youngest head coach to make the NBA Finals since Bill Russell did so as a player/coach in 1969 ‚Äî putting the Cs four games away from avenging their 2022 defeat.\n\nSurprise Start: Unlike Russell, Mazzulla ‚Äî who began as a Boston assistant in 2019 under Brad Stevens ‚Äî won‚Äôt be playing in the Finals, but his journey as a Celtics head coach is also unique.\n\nSeptember 22, 2022: Just days before the beginning of training camp, the Celtics name Mazzulla interim head coach after suspending Ime Udoka for the 2022-23 season\n\nFebruary 16, 2023: The Celtics drop the interim tag from Mazzulla and officially name him the team‚Äôs head coach after leading the team to an NBA-best 42-17 record entering the All-Star break\n\nMay 29, 2023: After guiding the Celtics to a 57-25 regular-season record to earn the No. 2 seed, Mazzulla and the Cs lose to the No. 8 Heat in Game 7 of the East Finals\n\n3 Is The Magic Number: Despite falling short of the Finals, Mazzulla stuck to his offensive approach this season, and the 2023-24 Celtics turned out numbers few teams have ever seen.\n\nAttempts: Since Mazzulla took over as coach, 40.9% of Boston‚Äôs points have come on 3s, and the Celtics have taken the third-most (3,492 | 2022-23) and fourth-most (3,482 | 2023-24) 3PA in a regular season since 1997-98\n\nMakes: 47.2% of Boston‚Äôs FGAs this season were 3s, and they made 1,351 shots from beyond the arc ‚Äî leading the NBA in both categories\n\nSecond-Year Strides: Boston improved its offensive rating from 117.3 in 2022-23 to 122.2 this season ‚Äî the highest by any team in the play-by-play era (since 1997-98)\n\nThe Results: After winning 57 games in 2022-23, the Celtics secured the league‚Äôs best record this season with 64 wins, their most since winning the title in 2007-08\n\nüó£Ô∏è Mazzulla: ‚ÄúI love 3-pointers. I like math ‚Ä¶ I think it‚Äôs a huge strength of our team.‚Äù\n\nLocker Room Love: Mazzulla‚Äôs impact isn‚Äôt just noticeable in the box score ‚Äî his players also credit him for the strides they‚Äôve made this season.\n\nüó£Ô∏è Jaylen Brown: ‚ÄúIt starts from the top ‚Ä¶ Joe sets the tone. He‚Äôs diligent, and he allows us to be who we are ‚Äî we‚Äôve been very well coached.‚Äù\n\nüó£Ô∏è Derrick White: ‚ÄúIt starts with Joe. Ever since he took over he‚Äôs just given me the most confidence.‚Äù\n\nüó£Ô∏è Al Horford: ‚ÄúJoe has been key for our success ‚Ä¶ He‚Äôs been great tactically and just as a leader. We follow him.‚Äù\n\n5. KIDD BRINGING DALLAS TO NEW HEIGHTS, AGAIN\n\nFull Circle: The last time the Mavericks won the Larry O‚ÄôBrien Trophy, head coach Jason Kidd was there ‚Äî as a player.\n\nThe year was 2011, and Kidd ‚Äî playing in his 21st NBA season ‚Äî averaged 7.7 points, 6.3 assists and 4.5 rebounds in the Finals to help the Mavs stun the Heat in six games.\n\nIt was both Dallas‚Äô and Kidd‚Äôs first ring, and neither party returned to the Finals until this season. But that isn‚Äôt the only reason why Kidd draws similarities to this year‚Äôs Mavs squad and his 2011 title team.\n\n‚ÄúI think just the resilience,‚Äù said Kidd when asked about what he sees in both teams. ‚ÄúUnderstanding that this group believes in each other. The connection offensively and defensively but off the floor too ‚Äî this is a special group.‚Äù\n\nGrooming Guards: Kidd ‚Äî a 10x All-Star, 6x All-NBA First Team member, 5x Assists Champ, and 75th NBA Anniversary Team member ‚Äî plays a part in that connectivity, especially when it comes to Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving‚Äôs chemistry and camaraderie.\n\nüó£Ô∏è Luka On Kidd: ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs doing an amazing job with me and Kai. He was in those situations before as a player, so he understands us. And the way he sees the game ‚Äî it‚Äôs perfect.‚Äù\n\nüó£Ô∏è Kyrie On Kidd: ‚ÄúHe makes our job a lot easier. He just has that point guard‚Äôs mentality, where he wants us to stay poised and continue to make the right decisions but also stay aggressive.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúHe shows us a lot of love, keeps us positive, and he‚Äôs a straight shooter.‚Äù\n\nShowing Respect: Under Kidd ‚Äî who has led Dallas to two 50+ win seasons and a pair of trips to the West Finals since taking over in 2021-22 ‚Äî the Mavs offense has taken a considerable jump and the team excels in late-game situations, which has drawn the attention of Mazzulla.\n\nOffense: From 2021-22 to 2023-24, Dallas has improved its field goal percentage (46.1 to 48.1), 3-point percentage (35.0 to 36.9), effective field goal percentage (53.8 to 56.2) and 2nd-chance points (9.0 to 13.4)\n\nThe Results? The Mavs climbed from the 24th ranked offense in 2021-22 (108.0 ppg) to the 7th ranked offense this season (117.9 ppg)\n\nThe Clutch: Dallas had the 2nd-highest winning percentage in the clutch this regular season with a 23-9 record (71.9%) and is tied with the Knicks for the most Playoff clutch wins (6-3 record)\n\nüó£Ô∏èMazzulla on Kidd: ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a great coach. They‚Äôre one of the teams that we study a lot in late game situations and the concepts that they do. His ability to create buy-in on his role guys and then put his best players in position to be successful ‚Ä¶ he‚Äôs done a great job.‚Äù"
