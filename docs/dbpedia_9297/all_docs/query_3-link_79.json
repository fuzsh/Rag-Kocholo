        "text": "WALTHAM — Celtics president of basketball operations Danny Ainge admits he was puzzled by the reaction he received during the team’s deep playoff run without Kyrie Irving and Gordon Hayward that ended with a loss Sunday in Game 7 of the Eastern Conference Finals.\n\n“I get a kick out of the fact that everybody,” Ainge said, “I mean everywhere I go people don’t think that we need Kyrie or need Gordon Hayward. I have a much stronger memory and remember how great those guys were and what an effort it took us to get them. I also remember how great they are and how young they are still. So we need Gordon and Kyrie absolutely. If this playoff run and all the series of the playoffs didn’t show that then I don’t know what does. We were able to win some games and we were able to fight through some tough battles, but we’re much, much better with Kyrie and Gordon.”\n\nHayward suffered an ankle injury in the season opener and Ainge said he just recently returned to the court for one-on-one drills and should begin playing basketball in the next couple of months. A knee injury has sidelined Irving since March 11. Hayward attended the Celtics’ 87-79 loss to the Cavs in Game 7, but much was made of the fact that Irving did not. Ainge said Irving wasn’t there because he underwent surgery to repair a deviated septum.\n\nIrving and Hayward must have wondered how much they could have helped if they had remained healthy.\n\n“I think it was really hard,” Ainge said. “I don’t think any of us can really understand. That never really happened to me as a player so I’m not sure I understand, but you could see it in their eyes all year when Gordon was out. It hurts to not be able to play, especially when a team’s doing so well. And same thing with Kyrie. Those guys would give anything to be out there and play. I’m really excited about their motivation.”\n\nAinge met with the Celtics players Monday morning and their Game 7 loss was still fresh on their minds. Despite missing Irving and Hayward, the Celtics won 55 games, three more than last season, and came within one victory of reaching the NBA Finals for the first time since 2010. LeBron James excelled in Game 7 with 35 points, 15 rebounds and 9 assists while playing the entire game, but the Celtics still could have won if they hadn’t shot only 34.1 percent and just 17.9 percent from threeland (7 of 39).\n\n“It was a very disappointing loss,” Ainge said. “I think that the further you go in the playoffs, the harder it is to lose. What was interesting about yesterday’s game was I felt like it was one of the playoff games that we lost that we should have won. So that’s going to eat at all of us for a while and hopefully, like Brad (Stevens) said, that that pain that you feel of losing is part growth that we need to take.”\n\nWith Irving and Hayward scheduled to return, Ainge doesn’t anticipate making as many roster moves as he did last summer.\n\n“At this time last year,” he said, “I couldn’t have said that we were going to have 11 new players off the team that just won 52 games and won a playoff round (actually two), but you just don’t know what opportunities present themselves. But I like this group of guys. We’re not looking to make changes other than just small tweaks here and there to our roster.”\n\nAinge said rookie Jayson Tatum, who led the Celtics with 18.5 points per game in the playoffs, was projected to play only 20-25 minutes off the bench at the start of the season to not put too much pressure on him.\n\n“He obviously exceeded everyone’s expectations,” Ainge said, “with the opportunities with Gordon’s injury, but I think he’s just scratching the surface. I think that he’s got to get a lot better at both ends of the court. What I like about Jayson is that he knows that and he will work to get better.”\n\nJaylen Brown and Terry Rozier did not shoot well in Game 7, but for the most part they all with Tatum all produced when the team needed more from them after Hayward and Irving got hurt.\n\n“Those guys got an opportunity,” Ainge said. “They didn’t just walk through that door, they ran through that door and proved that they’re fantastic players.”\n\nDue to injuries to Irving, Hayward, Daniel Theis and Shane Larkin, as well as the ineffectiveness of Greg Monroe, Stevens stuck mostly with only seven players as the conference finals progressed.\n\n“You need a deep bench as we found out this year,” Ainge said. “We really needed some more bodies.”\n\nMonroe, Aron Baynes and Shane Larkin will be unrestricted free agents this summer and Marcus Smart will be a restricted free agent.\n\n“Our ownership has been fantastic,” Ainge said, “and they’ve been very willing to pay for teams that have a chance and I think the way that our team played this year, the hope that there is, I think that will make it easier for them to step forward and realize the potential of this team and be willing to pay the money that we need to to be as good as we can.”\n\n—Contact Bill Doyle at william.doyle@telegram.com.
