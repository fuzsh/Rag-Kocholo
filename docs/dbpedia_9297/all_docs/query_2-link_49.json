        "text": "ALERT: The Twin Peaks Tunnel will be closed for repairs Thursday, August 22 through Thursday, August 29. During the tunnel repairs, Forest Hill and West Portal stations will be closed. Please use K, L or M Buses for service between Balboa Park or Zoo and Church station. S Shuttle trains will serve all Metro stations between Castro and Embarcadero. Transfer between Muni Metro trains and K, L and M buses at Church or Castro. Learn more at the Twin Peaks Tunnel Upgrades webpage.\n\nSan Francisco students are returning to classrooms August 2024, and Muni will be there to serve them. Every public school in the San Francisco Unified School District is served by at least one Muni route.\n\nThis page reflects the Muni service riders can expect on the first day of school in August. Because Muni vehicles often become crowded during morning peak hours and sometimes pass up stops when there is not enough room for extra riders, families are encouraged to plan their trips ahead of time and hop on Muni early to make sure students get to school on time.\n\nMuni’s \"school trippers\" service will also provide service throughout the school year. These are extra afternoon buses on existing lines that begin their route at a school site, pick up students at the end of the school day (except on early dismissal days), then continue along the route as normal. These provide capacity for the additional demand certain schools place on routes, leading to a less crowded trip for everyone.\n\nFind your school on the list below to explore the nearest routes available!\n\nHigh Schools\n\nMiddle Schools\n\nElementary Schools\n\nFares\n\nThe Free Muni for Youth Program provides San Francisco youth ages 5-18 with free Muni service, regardless of household income level. A Clipper Card is not required for buses and trains, however, it is needed to receive a free fare on cable cars. For those who ride cable cars regularly, a cable car pass is available for youth 5 18 years old; youth 4 and under always ride for free.\n\nWhile proof of payment is not required from youth, those 16 and older are encouraged to carry a student ID or other form of ID for age verification.\n\nMuni fares for regular service will also be waived for students enrolled in the SFUSD’s English Learner and Special Education Services programs through the age of 22.\n\nIn addition, low-income parents, guardians or other caregivers may benefit from other free and discount programs:\n\nLifeline (50% off for low-income adults)\n\nFree Muni for Seniors\n\nFree Muni for People with Disabilities\n\nSMART\n\nSafety\n\nSafety for all on transit is our top priority. The Muni Transit Assistance Program (MTAP) works with and trains members of the community in conflict resolution who then ride Muni with the purpose of diffusing and deterring any conflicts and acts of vandalism and assist the operators as needed.\n\nIn addition, the SFMTA deploys school crossing guards at dozens of intersections throughout San Francisco, and works with our Vision Zero city partners to help improve safety near schools.\n\nWalking & Rolling to School\n\nActive transportation – like walking and biking – are also great options on our Safe Routes to Schools page. Our Vision Zero partners at the San Francisco Department of Public Health share additional safety reminders each year.\n\nTravel to school safely by walking on sidewalks and obeying traffic signs and crossing guards. If you ride a bike, remember to always wear a helmet.
