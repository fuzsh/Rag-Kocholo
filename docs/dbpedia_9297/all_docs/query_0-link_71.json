        "text": "Retired teacher Irv Gordon of long Island, New York is the proud owner of a 1966 Volvo P1800S. To date, Gordon’s red Volvo coupe has almost 3 million miles on the odometer (the equivalent of nearly 1,176 times across the globe). He has held the Guinness World Record for High Mileage Vehicle since 2002 and was the first person to hold this record.\n\nThe 72-year-old drives his Volvo everywhere and he hopes to reach the 3 million mile mark by the end of the calendar year. It took him 21 years to reach the first million miles and 15 more years to reach 2 million. However, he only has 34,000 miles to go and with trips to Montreal, Texas and Michigan in just the last month, the last leg of his trip should not be too hard to complete as Gordon averages 85,000 to 100,000 miles per year.\n\nMost of his trips nowadays are primarily for auto shows, but he has been known to take trips across the country just for a good cup of coffee. In addition, Volvo has sent Gordon on trips around the country and the world to represent Volvo in auto shows.\n\n“I don’t think (just) any car could do it,” said John Maloney, president and CEO of Volvo Cars of North America. “It is a combination of a car beloved by his owner that has gotten Irv to this mileage.”\n\nGordon bought his beloved car on June 30, 1966, for $4,150 at the age of 25. At the time of the purchase it was a whole year’s salary and he originally wanted the convertible model with air conditioning, but it was too expensive so he settled for the hardtop model with an AM/FM radio.\n\nRedlineNorth loves these type of stories about people who love their cars and we wish him all the best with his goal of hitting the 3 million mile mark!"
