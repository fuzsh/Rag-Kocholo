        "text": "For the Boston Celtics, Friday's preseason opener against the Charlotte Hornets has an outsized importance.\n\nA quick rundown of the necessary disclaimers: The game doesn't count in the standings, neither team will be playing its best players heavy minutes, and both teams have had minimal time to prepare.\n\n\"I've always kind of laughed at the notion of training camp,\" Brad Stevens said on Tuesday. \"I think that's probably an old term, but it's two days for us. So we're going to treat it as we're going to do our system and put our system in for 10 days, and then we'll add our tweaks and the things that we like to do specifically offensively and defensively maybe outside of that, after that time. So we've got basically two 10-day periods here as we get ready for the season the way we're looking at it.\"\n\nHere's the thing that truly matters for Friday's game: Both Gordon Hayward and Kyrie Irving should be available. In other words, the Celtics -- who were a patchwork quilt during last year's playoffs -- should be at full strength for the first time since Irving threw an ill-fated lob for Hayward six minutes into last season.\n\n\"I'm excited about it,\" Hayward said. \"It is kind of weird. It seems like football just started and we're doing preseason already. I'm excited ot be back on the court just to get a run in. I know there's going to be some rust and stuff but I'll be happy to be back out there.\"\n\nIn the brief stretches of scrimmage witnessed by the media, Irving looked very healthy and extremely sharp -- weaving through traffic and pulling up behind pick-and-roll screens.\n\nHayward has been running with the starting unit as well -- an indication that the Celtics plan to start the Big Five unit of Irving, Hayward, Al Horford, Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum.\n\nFor Irving, simply playing with Hayward is something to be excited about.\n\n\"I think about how life has come full circle for me and Gordon,\" Irving said on Tuesday. \"In 2014, I was his host in Cleveland when he was a restricted free agent. I met him and Robyn (Hayward, Gordon's wife) then, and I think we are able to play together now, one year taken away from us. We're just making up for lost time. He's so talented, I'm a big fan. I was watching his highlights yesterday so I can't wait to see him play. I'm so happy for him. I've been waiting to play with a two guard like Gordon. He's even-keeled the whole game. You are able to throw it to him and he's able to get you a bucket, but he's smart too.\"\n\nFrom what we've gleaned at training camp, here are three other things to watch.\n\n- Brad Stevens has been hammering the importance of defense (he often includes it when he talks about \"skipping steps). It's not entirely clear whether he is actually genuinely concerned about the team's defense, or whether he just wants to make extra sure that a loaded offensive squad doesn't forget about the other end.\n\n\"We don't play hard the right way together, we'll get beat and the game will be honest with us,\" Stevens said on Tuesday. \"Then we have to go back to square one. We embrace all of that stuff then we have a chance to have a really good year.\"\n\nInternally, the Celtics are thrilled with the character of the group of players they have, so it's hard to imagine Stevens has major concerns. But defense may decide exactly how good the Celtics can be this season.\n\n- How good will Jayson Tatum be? That's one of the more intriguing questions of the season, and we should at least get a glimpse in the preseason. It's not impossible that he takes an enormous step forward, given that he has a ton of confidence and essentially no holes in his game.\n\nIt's also not impossible that he flounders a bit at the start as he tries to balance his newfound stardom within a system that also includes other stars.\n\nAfter all, he's only\n\n20.\n\n- How good will Jaylen Brown be?\n\n\"I'm excited to get back because I worked really hard on certain aspects of my game,\" Brown said at media day on Monday. \"Free throws, ball handling, playmaking for others. So many things that people critiqued me on in the past, it will be interesting to see if they critique me this year.\"\n\nIf Brown has really improved those aspects of his game, there really isn't any way to slow what could be an absurdly potent Celtics offense.\n\nCeltics vs. Hornets tips off at 7:30 p.m. on NBA TV and NBC Sports Boston."
