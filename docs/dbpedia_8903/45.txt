Empire of the Ants on Blu-ray

Perhaps "Antie Maim" may have been a better title for director Bert I. Gordon's (sort of) adaptation of H.G. Wells' short story. The one and only Joan Collins stars as an unscrupulous real estate developer who leads a group of would-be buyers/marks to a deserted island-which turns out to be inhabited by giant ants that don't take kindly to intruders. Robert Lansing, John David Carson, Albert Salmi, Jacqueline Scott co-star. 89 min. Widescreen (Enhanced); Soundtrack: English DTS Lossless stereo; Subtitles: English; audio commentary by Gordon, others; theatrical trailer.
