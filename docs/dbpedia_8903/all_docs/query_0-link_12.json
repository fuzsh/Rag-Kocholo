S I R S : I have the honor to report to you on the finances of the Federal Government for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1956. A balanced Federal budgetâ€”a major goalof the Eisenhower Administrationâ€”is now a reality. The Government not only lived within its income in fiscal 1956 but there was better than a $ 1 ^ billion budget surplus for debt reduction. Another balanced budget and further surplus are in prospect for the current fiscal year and again for fiscal 1958. Their attainment will mean three surpluses in a rowâ€”for the first time in more than 20 years. This accomplishment was matched by monetary policies designed and executed to help keep credit expansion within sustainable limits. Americans are enjoying high peacetime prosperity. We have record high employment, high wages, and high productipn. I t represents true prosperityâ€”for there has been little change in the cost of living during the past four years. The exceptional vigor of our economy, however, points to the need for continuing self discipline and national restraint. With the economy operating at a very high rate and with shortages of materials and manpower in many areas, we cannot do all the things we would hke to do as fast as we would like to do them without running the risk of serious price inflation. On the fiscal front, we must continue to try to reduce Federal spending and keep the budget in balance. Modest surpluses are appropriately used for debt reduction. Important as further tax reduction is, it should wait until the time when we can look ahead and see a sufficient surplus of Government income over spending to pay for a tax cut fairly spread among all our people. In this way we can best maintain the fiscal integrity of our country and help assure the continued soundness of our currency. A full report on the Treasury's operations during the 1956 fiscal year follows. G. M. HUMPHREY, Secretary oj the Treasury. To To THE THE PRESIDENT OF THE SENATE. SPEAKER OF THE H O U S E OF REPRESENTATIVES. 1 399346â€”57 2 REVIEW OF FISCAL OPERATIONS Summary of Fiscal Operations A balanced budget, with a surplus of $1.6 billion, was achieved in the fiscal year 1956. Both net budget receipts of $68.2 billion and expenditures of $66.5 billion were somewhat higher than first anticipated, as was the surplus. The surplus, combined with a rise in the balance in the accouht of the Treasurer of the United States and an excess of receipts in trust account and other transactions, resulted in a decrease in the public debt pf $1.6 billion. The Treasurer's balance on June 30, 1956, amounted to $6.5 billion, The public debt outstanding stood at $272.8 billion compared with $274.4 billion a year earlier. Net receipts in 1956 were $7.8 billion larger than in 1955 and $3.3 billion above those in 1953, the highest previous record. Expenditures were $2.0 billion higher than in 1955, but $7.7 billion below those in fiscal 1953, the largest previous expenditures in the postwar period. Budget results and the change in the public debt are summarized for the fiscal years 1955^ and 1956 in the following table. Budget results: / Net receipts. _. Expenditures.. Budget deficit, or surplus (â€”)licss: Account of the Treasurer of the United States, increase In balance, or decrease (â€”) _._ _ _ Trust account and other transactions, excess of receipts (-)i Equals: Public debt increase, or decrease (â€”). *Less than $50 million. 1 Includes net trust account transactions, etc.; net investment by Government agencies in public debt securities; net sales or redemptions of obligations of Government agencies in the market; changes in clearing and other accounts necessary to reconcile to Treasury cash; and changes in amount of cash held outside the Treasury. Balanced budgets for the fiscal years 1957 and 1958 also are estimated. In the 1958 budget, net budget receipts are estimated at $70.6 billion for 1957 and $73.6 billion for 1958; expenditures in 1957 and 1958 are estimated at $68.9 billion and $71.8 billion. A summary of receipts and expenditures for the fiscal years 1956, 1957, and 1958 5 6 1956 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY is contained in the following section. Table 8 shows budget receipts and expenditures, actual for the fiscal year 1956 and estimated for the fiscal years 1957 and 1958 on the basis of existing and proposed legislation, and table 10 shows the effect of financial operations on the public debt. THE BUDGET. C H A R T 2. In his message dated January 16, 1956, transmitting the 1957 budget, the President stated that it continued ^'the policy of the two previous budgets I sent to the Congress, in which I emphasized the importance of actions to eliminate excessive accumulations of unexpended balances, which so frequently invite comiriitihehts leading to unnecessary future expenditures.^' Unexpended balances include not only the appropriations by the Congress permitting Government agencies to incur financial obligations, but also authorizations to enter into contracts prior to enactment of appropriations, and authorizations to make expenditures from borrowed money. The progress in reducing these balances is REVIEW OF FISCAL OPERATIONS 7 evident from the following table. It shows a decline in unexpended balances of appropriations from $80.2 billion on June 30, 1953, to $50.6 billion on June 30, 1956. Total unexpended balances, including all types of authorizations, declined from $102.8 billion on June 30, 1953, to $72.9 billion on June 30, 1956. Unexpended balances brought forward From appro.Total, priated funds, including including other revolving authorizations funds JuneSOâ€” In billions of dollars 1953--.â€” 1954 1955 1956 - _- - - ---â€” 80.2 70.6 57.6 50.6 102:8 94 2 79.6 72 9 As in the fiscal year 1955, there was in 1956 a wn:de disparity between receipts in the first half of the year and in the second. There were, however, substantial differences in amounts of the deficits in the first half and. the surpluses in the second, as is shown in the table which follows. The first half-year deficits in both years necessitated the usual Treasury borrowing program. In each year, only 37 percent of receipts came in during July- \\ December and 63 percent during January-June. The disparity is still due in part to the completion in 1955 of the 5-year schedule initiated by the llevenue Act of 1950 to speed up the timing of corporate tax payments to relate them more closely to receipts of income. Under this arrangement, calendar year corporations had paid all of their 1954 tax liabilities in the January-June period of 1955. Beginning with; the fiscal year 1956, a new 5-year schedule provided by the 1954 Code progressively redistributes within each fiscal year substantial amounts of corporate tax payments. C Thus the calendar year corporations to which the schedule applies were required to pay 5 percent of the estimated tax on 1955 tax liabilities in September 1955, 5 percent iin December 1955, and 45 percent each in March and June 1956. While this redistribution as it proceeds wiir tend to initigate the seasonal borrowing problem of the Treasury, there still remain larger receipts from individual income taxpayers and other sources during January-June than during July-December. â€¢ 8 1956 EEPORT OF THE SECRETARY OF THE TEEASURY 1955 Net budget receipts Period 1966 Net budget expenditures Budget surplus, or deficit ( - ) Net budget receipts Net budget expenditures Budget surplus, or deficit ( - ) In billions of dollars July-September October-December . .

Previously the fiscal year 1953 total of $64.8 billion had been the largest amount collected. The 1956 receipts were $7.8 billion greater than receipts in the previous fiscal year. A comparison of receipts, by major sources, in the two years is shown in the following table.

All major revenue sources showed substantial increases for 1956, reflecting a general rise in incomes, production, and business activity. REVIEV^ OF FISCAL OPERATIONS 9 Individual income taxes.â€”Receipts from individual income taxes amounted to $35,334 miUion in 1956. This is an increase of $3,684 million over 1955 receipts of $31,650 million. A substantial rise in personal incomes was responsible for the rise in receipts. Corporation income taxes.â€”Corporation profits in the calendar year 1955 were much greater than 1954 profits. The rise in receipts in the fiscal year 1956 of $3,034 million reflected this increase but not completely. Receipts in 1956 did not benefit from the year-to-year acceleration of corporation installment payments under the Revenue Act of 1950 which increased receipts in the 1951-55 period. ^A continued advance in installment payments occurred in 1956 through the declaration and payments of estimated tax required under the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 but the net increase in fiscal year receipts is small since the payments of most corporations are merely advanced to an earlier part of the fiscal year. A second factor reducing the rise in 1956 receipts was the virtual absence of any coUections from the excess profits tax of 1950 which was terminated on December 31, 1953. Some revenue from this source was received in 1955. Excise taxes.â€”Receipts from this source, by major groups, are listed in the table which follows. [In millions of dollars] Source 1955 1956 Increase, or decrease (â€”) Amount Alcohol taxes . Tobacco taxes.. __ Taxes on documents, other instruments, and playing cards Manufacturers' excise taxes.

All major excise tax categories contributed to the increase of $794 million in excise tax receipts in 1956 but more than half of the rise was accounted for by the manufacturers^ excise tax group. Every tax in this group with one minor exception showed an increase in 1956 For some taxes the relative increases were very large, but more than half of the absolute increase was provided by the tax on passenger automobUes which rose $329 mUlion, 10 1956 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY Receipts from alcohol taxes increased $178 mUlion. Collections of all principal taxes, those on distilled spirits, wines, and beer, were larger in 1956. The increase in tobacco taxes is attributable to higher receipts from the tax on small cigarettes since collections from cigars and manufactured tobacco dropped by small amounts. The increase in collections from smaU cigarettes resumed the year-toyear rise characteristic of this tax which had been interrupted in 1954 and 1955. The increase in the miscellaneous excise tax group was principally attributable to larger collections from communication taxes and the tax on transportation of property. Employment taxes.â€”Receipts from the various employment taxes are shown in the following table.

In addition the first two were augmented by an increase in coverage and an increase in the maximum amounts taxable from $3,600 to $4,200 a year. Most of the increase in receipts from the Unemployment Tax Act resulted from the elimination of quarterly installment payments and a consequent bunching of receipts in 1956. Estate and gift taxes.â€”Receipts from estate and gift taxes were $1,171 mUlion in 1956. This was the first year in which receipts from these taxes exceeded one bUlion dollars. The percentage increase in 1956, 25.1 percent, was the largest for any major tax classification. The substantial rise in 1956 reflected a sharp rise in property values. REVIEW 0$\" fISCAL Of>ERATION^ 11 Customs.â€”Customs duties receipts rose from $606 million in 1955 to $705 million in 1956 as a result of the increase in general business activity. The collections were the largest in history, exceeding the^ previous record in 1951. Miscellaneous receipts.â€”Receipts from miscellaneous sources of income in the fiscal year 1956 totaled $3,006 million, $447 million more than in the previous year. The largest increase occurred in receipts from sales of Government property and products. Refunds of receipts.â€”Refunds of receipts amounted to $3,684 million in 1956, an increase of $258 mUlion over 1955. Refunds of overprepayments of individual income taxes was the only tax refund source showing a significant increase. ESTIMATES OF RECEIPTS IN 1957 AND 1958 The Secretary of the Treasury is required each year to prepare and submit in his annual report to Congress estimates of the public revenue for the current fiscal year and for the fiscal year next ensuing (act of February 26, 1907 (34 Stat. 949)). The estimates of receipts from taxes and customs for the current and ensuing fiscal years are prepared in December of each year by the Treasury Department. In general, the estimates of miscellaneous receipts are prepared by the agencies depositing the receipts in the Treasury. The receipts estimates reflect the high levels of business activity, personal income, and corporate profits attained in the calendar year 1956. They assume continued gains in the level of personal income and a moderate increase in corporate profits. The estimates for the fiscal years 1957 and 1958 are based on the assumption that legislation wUl be enacted extending tax rates at their current levels for another year beyond AprU 1, 1957, as recommended by the President. Net budget receipts in the fiscal year 1957 are estimated to amount to $70,628 million, an increase of $2,463 mUlion over actual receipts in 1956. A further rise of $2,992 million to $73,620 mUlion is estunated for 1958. The amounts to be reported as budget receipts in 1957 and 1958 are reduced by the Highway Revenue Act of 1956. Receipts from certain previously existing excise taxes which were included as budget receipts in 1956 and previous years are, in 1957 and 1958, treated as trust fund receipts. 12 19 56 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY Fiscal year 1957 Actual receipts in 1956 and estimated receipts in 1957 are compared by major sources in the following table.

Other receipt categories also increase, in some cases significantly in relative terms but not in absolute amounts. Only about one-half of the increase in gross receipts is carried through to net budget receipts. The deduction for the transfer of certain excise tax receipts to the highway trust fund is much larger than the increase in gross excise tax receipts and the increase in employment taxes is eliminated by the deduction for transfers to trust accounts. Individual income tax.â€”Receipts from the individual income tax are estimated to be $38,500 million in 1957, an increase of $3,166 million over actual receipts of $35,334 mUlion in 1956. The increase results from the rise in incomes which has taken place in the calendar year 1956 and the expected continuation of rising personal incomes in the first half of the calendar year 1957. Corporation income tax.â€”Corporation income tax receipts in 1957 are estimated to amount to $21,400 mUlion, as compared with receipts of $21,299 mUlion in 1956. The rise of $101 mUlion reflects a modest increase in corporate profits as estimated for the calendar year 1956, the profit level which primarily determines receipts in 1957. Other factors of a technical nature which affect the 1956-57 comparison of receipts are largely offsetting. 13 REVIEW .

Important exceptions are the tax on passenger automobiles, the admissions tax, and the tax on transportation of persons. A decrease is anticipated in the tax on passenger automobUes because of the decline of automobile production which occurred in the calendar year 1956. I t is expected that automobile production will increase in 1957 but will not achieve the very high levels of the calendar year 1955. The relatively large decline in receipts estimated for the admissions tax is attributable to the increase in the admissions exemption from 50 cents to 90 cents. The yield of the tax on transportation of persons is adversely aft'ected by the exemption of certain travel. Large relative increases in receipts are estimated only for those taxes affected by the Highway Revenue Act. This act increased the tax on gasoline used for highway purposes from 2 cents to 3 cents a gallon; mcreased the tax on diesel fuel from 2 cents to 3 cents a gallon; increased the tax on tires for highway-type vehicles from 5 cents a pound to 8 cents; increased the tax on trucks and buses from 8 percent to 10 percent of manufacturers' price; imposed a new tax oh rubber for retreading tires for highway-type vehicles of 3 cents a pound, and imposed a new tax of $1.50 a thousand pounds on the total weight of highway vehicles over 26,000 pounds of gross vehicle weight. These taxes were effective July 1, 1956, but, because of the lag in collections, a full 12 months of receipts will not be collected in 1957. The increased revenue from these higher tax rates and new taxes is responsibile for most of the increase in gross excise tax receipts in 1957. However, the revenues from all of the taxes affected by the Highway Revenue Act are transferred to the highway trust fund. The net effect of the act is to reduce excise tax receipts remaining 14 1956 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY in budget receipts so that net excise taxes in 1957 are estimated to be $852 million less than in 1956.

The increase in receipts resulting from the higher rates are to be transferred to the Federal disability insurance trust fund. Receipts from the Federal Unemployment Tax Act are estimated to be lower in 1957 than in 1956 because of the bunching of receipts in 1956 as a result of the elimination of installment payments. . Estate and gift taxes.â€”Receipts from estate and gift taxes are estimated to be $1,380 million in 1957, a rise of $209 million reflecting recent increases in estate values. Customs.â€”Customs receipts are estimated to amount to $775 mUlion in 1957. This increase of $70 million reflects a higher level of business activity. Miscellaneous receipts.â€”Receipts from miscellaneous sources are estimated to be $2,986 million in 1957 as compared with $3,006 million in 1956. Eefunds of receipts.â€”Refunds of receipts are estimated to be $3,880 million in 1957 as compared with actual refunds of $3,684 millionin 1956.

Net budget receipts in 1958 are estimated to amount to $73,620 mUlion. This is an increase of $2,992 million over estimated receipts in 1957. All sources of receipts are expected to increase in 1958, with the largest absolute rises affecting net budget receipts occurring in individual and corporation income tax collections. The gain in individual income tax receipts is smaller than in 1957 b u t is augmented by a rise of $600 million in corporation income tax receipts in 1958. Miscellaneous receipts are also expected to rise in 1958. Individual income tax.â€”Reflecting continuing gains in personal incomes, receipts from the individual income tax are expected to increase from $38,500 mUlion in 1957 to $41,000 million in 1958. Corporation income ^ax.---Receipts from the corporation income tax are estimated to amount to $22,000 million in 1958. This is $600 million above estimated receipts in 1957, reflecting an estimated rise in profits from the calendar year 1956 to the calendar year 1957.

The increased receipts resulting from the higher tax rates are to be transferred to the Federal disabiUty insurance trust fund. Estate and gift taxes.â€”Receipts from estate and gift taxes are estimated to increase to $1,475 million in 1958, a rise of $95 inillion. Customs.â€”^A continued high level of business activity is expected to increase customs receipts in 1958. Miscellaneous receipts.â€”M.ost sources of miscellaneous receipts are estimated to show some increase in 1958. Tbe total is estimated at $3,278 milhon, up $292 million from the 1957 estimate. Refunds of receipts.â€”Refunds of receipts are estimated to be $4,156 million in 1958, an increase of $276 million over the estimated refunds of $3,880 million in 1957. BUDGET EXPENDITURES Net budget expenditures of $66.5 bUlion in the fiscal year 1956 were $2.0 billion more than in 1955, but $1.2 bUlion less than in 1954 and $7.7 billion less than the post-World War I I peak in 1953. Costs of major national security were held imchanged from 1955 at $40.6 17 REVIEW OF FISCAL OPERATIONS billion, nearly $10 bUlion less than in 1953.

Atomic Energy Commission, acquisition of strategic and critical materials under the General Services Administration, and defense production expansion. Not only w^as the magnitude of defense outlays virtuaUy unchanged from 1955, but also there were relatively small changes in the distribution of the components. The three decreases were $356 million for stockpiling and defense production expansion, $206 million for the development and control of atomic energy, and $197 million for Army defense. The largest increases were $342 million for Air Force defense and $319 inillion for military assistance. A decrease for international affairs and finance from $2.2 billion to $1.8 billion was due mainly to a reduction of $344 million for economic and technical development. The overall increase in expenditures for other programs was distributed throughout the various categories, except natural resources, which declined. Continuing the rise in 1955, veterans' services and benefits increased $0.3 billion. Interest expenditures, all of which related to public debt obligations except $60 million, rose $0.4 billion from those in 1955, with the increase reflecting both the general rise in money rates and the somewhat higher average of interest-bearing debt outstanding throughout most of the year. 399346â€”57- 18 1956 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY The rise of $1.6 bUlion for major domestic programs and the regular operating expenses of the Government included an increase of $0.5 billion each for agricultural purposes and for commerce and housing. The first was mainly for stabilization of farm prices and farm income, with the 1956 total for this purpose amounting to $3.9 billion. For the Commodity Credit Corporation alone gross expenditures were $5.6 bUlion and net expenditures $3.6 billion. For commerce and housing, net recoveries from aids to business other than housing decreased more than $0.3 bUlion, although partly offset by a decrease of $0.1 billion in expenditures for housing programs. There were increases of more than $0.1 bUlion each in expenditures for highways and for the postal service. Of the increase of $0.4 billion for general government, one-half consisted of the Federal payment to the civU service retirement, and disabUity fund as the Government's share of the benefit payments from the fund in 1956. No Federal payment had been made to the fund in 1955 except $30 mUlion for increases in annuities pursuant to the act of August 31, 1954.

TRUST ACCOUNT AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS Financial transactions of. Federal agencies which do not affect budget receipts and expenditures but do affect balances both in the account of the Treasurer of the United States and those held outside the Treasurer's account are reported in three classifications. These are trust and deposit fund transactions, net investment by Government agencies in public debt securities, and net redemption or sale of obligations of the agencies in the market. Monthly data for each of these classifications for the fiscal year 1956 and comparative totals for the fiscal years 1955 and 1956 are shown in table 5. Annual transactions for the fiscal years 1948 through 1956, together with the combined net total of receipts or expenditures for each year, will be found in table 7, and table 9 shows the estimates for 1957 and 1958. The relation of these transactions to the budget surplus or deficit and changes in the public debt, cash balances, and intransit items is indicated in table 1. For the fiscal year 1956, the aggregate of these transactions resulted in an excess of expenditures amounting to $194 million, as compared with an excess of receipts of $231 million in the preceding fiscal year. Trust and deposit fund accounts,â€”^Trust funds are established to 20 19 56 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY account for moneys which are held in trust by the Government for use in carrying out sjDecific purposes and programs in accordance with :a statute or a trust agreement. Deposit funds are used to account for moneys held b}^ the Government as banker or agent for others, or to account for collections held in suspense temporarily and later refunded or paid into some other account of the Government. For a further explanation of these nonbudget accounts, see page 315. The major trust funds consist of those for social secmTty and insurance, retirement, and veterans' life insurance. Detail by funds appears in table 5. Receipts and expenditures in most of the trust fund accounts are reported on a gross basis, although certain accounts which operate as revolving funds or working funds are reported net. Payments from general fund appropriations to certain trust accounts are included as receipts in those accounts. Investment transactions in public debt securities are shown sepaxately, since they ure not part of the operating programs of the trust funds but represent an exchange of assets. Deposit fund transactions also are reported net. For Government-sponsored enterprises they include net investment transactions. This method of classification became effective at the beginning of the fiscal year 1956 but data for the preceding fiscal year have been revised accordingly. During the fiscal year 1956 trust and deposit fund transactions in the aggregate resulted in an excess of credits, or net receipts, in the amount of $2,250 mUlion, as coinpared with $991 million during 1955. Investment hy Government agencies in IJnited States securities {net)}â€” These transactions are in the nature of financing operations in that the temporary investment of excess balances or the sale of securities to acquire operating cash does not affect the budget program of the agency, or the operating program in the case of trust accouats. Detail by agencies appears in table 5, with Government-sponsored enterprises carried as memorandum items. During the fiscal year 1956 net purchases of public debt and guaranteed securities excluding the net purchases by Government-sponsored enterprises amounted to $2,617 million, as compared with $1,362 million during 1955. Redemption or sale of obligations of Government agencies in the market (net).^â€”These transactions represent financing operations between the agencies and the public. The securities are reported at face amount, with separate classifications for those guaranteed and those not guaranteed by the United States. The bulk of the transactions are in nonguaranteed securities. Except for debentures issued by the Federal Housing Administration in exchange for defaulted mortgages, activity in guaranteed obligations currently consists only of redemptions of nominal amounts of matured securities. Detail b}^ 1 The figures shown here differ from those in thc daily Treasury statement because of differences in the reporting bases (see \"Bases of Tables\"). REVIEW OF FISCAL OPERATIONS 21 agencies appears in table 5, with Government-sponsored enterprises carried as memorandum items. During the fiscal year 1956, net sales of these agency obligations excluding the net sales by Governmentsponsored enterprises amounted to $173 million, as compared with net sales of $602 million during 1955. ACCOUNT OF THE TREASURER OF THE UNITED STATES The cash assets held in the account of the Treasurer of the United States consist of gold, silver, paper currency, coin, unclassified collection items, and balances in Federal Reserve Banks and other depositary banks. The liabilities consist of Treasurer's checks outstanding, balances to the credit of the Board of Trustees of the Postal Savings Systein, and uncollected items, exchanges, etc. The dift'erence between the cash assets and liabilities constitutes the balance in the account of the Treasurer of the United States. Items in this balance represent (1) available operating funds, consisting of the gold balance, available funds on deposit in the Federal Reserve Banks, and the balances in Treasury tax and loan accounts in commercial banks; and (2) funds not immediately available for operating purposes, consisting of the silver balance, other silver bullion, coin and currency, checks in process of collection, and deposits in general and other depositaries. Details of assets and liabilities are shown under the caption ^'Account of Treasurer of the United States\" in the Daily Statement of the United States Treasury. The balance in the Treasurer's account at the close of the fiscal year 1956 amounted to $6,546 million, an increase of $331 million during the fiscal year. The net change in the balance in the account of the Treasurer of the United States during the fiscal year, on the basis of the Daily Statement of ihe United States Treasury, is accounted for as follows: {In millions of dollars) Balance J u n e 30, 1955 Add: N e t deposits . 77, 079 Certain public d e b t redemptions included as cash withdrawals below ^ 1,086 .

The balance in the Treasurer's account during the fiscal year ranged from a low of $2,615 million on January 17, 1956, to a high of $7,522 million on March 21, 1956. PUBLIC DEBT OPERATIONS AND OWNERSHIP OF FEDERAL SECURITIES A net decrease of $1.6 billion in the public debt and guaranteed obligations during the fiscal year brought the total Federal debt outstanding to $272.8 billion on June 30, 1956. This is the first decline in the amount of the public debt for a fiscal year since 1951. The public issues in the interest-bearing debt showed an even greater dechne during fiscal 1956. Nonmarketable public issues decreased by $3.5 billion and the marketable pubhc issues by $0.3 billion. However, there was a net increase of $1.9 billion in special issues to Government investment accounts (principally the result of increased issues to the Federal old-age and survivors insurance trust fund). This increase, together with a rise in matured debt and debt bearing no interest, brought the net decline in the total public debt outstanding down to $1.6 bilhon.

Since January 1953 considerable progress has been made in improving the maturity structure of the debt as well as in distributing the ownership of the debt as widely as possible among the various investor groups, particularly among nonbank investors. Readjustment of debt maturities has reduced the volume and frequency of Treasury financings. Except for seasonal borrowing in anticipation of taxes, the Treasury went to the market only four times during the fiscal year 1956 for major borrowings. In contrast, during earlier postwar years when heavier reliance was placed on short-term borrowing, the Treasury engaged in major market financing as often as twelve times a year. With Treasury financing operations less of a factor in the market, the Federal Reserve System had more free time during the fiscal year 1956 in which to exercise an independent monetary and credit policy. Also, the capital markets have been freer to absorb a record-breaking volume of new corporate and State and local government securities and mortgages. Market conditions have not been favorable for any further extension of the Federal debt into the long-term area since the additional cash offering in July 1955 of around $% bUlion of the 3 percent bonds of 1995. Nevertheless, this issue, plus optional offerings of intermediate term notes in connection with the December and March refundings, helped to offset partially the effect of the passage of time which is 24 19 56 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY always operating to shorten the average length of the marketable debt. The average maturity of the marketable debt (callable bonds to first call date) stood at 4 years and 2 months at the close of .fiscal 1956. WhUe this was five months shorter than at the close of the previous fiscal year, it is still four mohths longer than it was in December 1952. On June 30, 1956, the amount of marketable under-oneyear debt was $65 bUlion, representing 42 percent of the total marketable debt, as compared with $80 billion, or 52 percent of the total marketable debt and savings notes at the end of December 1952. The structure of the debt a t the end of the 1956 fiscal year is shown in chart 4. STRUCTURE OF THE PUBLIC DEBT JUNE 30,1956 Total Nonmarketable Marketable $Bil.

A significant feature of debt ownership changes during the year was the liquidation of a large amount of Government securities by the commercial banking system. Under the impact of heavy demands for private credit, commercial banks reduced their holdings of Governments by around $6K billion, and by the close of the fiscal year their holdings were down to about $57 bUlion, the lowest year-end figure since June 1943. Insurance companies and savings banks also continued to liquidate Government securities to help meet the heavy demands of mortgage and corporate financing. Some of this liquida- REVIEW OF FISCAL OPERATIONS 25 tion represented debt retirement by the Treasury. The remainder represented securities which were purchased in the market by other types of investors. State and local governments and foreign and international accounts, for example, increased their Federal debt holdings by around $2 bUlion. The $2 billion increase in investment in Governments by individuals during the year, added further to the widespread distribution of the debt. Their holdings of almost $67 bUlion in Federal securities make them the largest single investor group in the public debt ownership structure. Sales of Series E and H savings bonds set another alltime postwar record in fiscal 1956, with sales running well ahead of redemptions. An account of the operations in the public debt and changes in the ownership of Federal securities during the year is given in the pages immediately following. Further detaU on the debt and its ownership is given in the exhibits and tables sections of the report. PUBLIC DEBT OPERATIONS The unprecedented demand for mortgage, corporate, and municipal credit that has accompanied our prevailing prosperity has been exerting a heavy pressure on the supply of savings avaUable for long-term investment. As a result, the demand for long-term Government bonds since the additional cash oftering in July 1955 of the 3 percent bond maturing in 1995 has not been sufficient to warrant further long-term offerings. In the August 1955 refunding the I'reasury oft'ered only securities in the one-year range to holders of the maturing issue. In the December 1955 and March 1956 refundings, however, holders of maturing securities were offered a choice between a one-year certificate and a note due in June 1958, with holders of $4K billion of the maturing issues preferring the longer security. Optional exchange offerings into a one-year or a longer-term security have characterized Treasury refundings since the beginning of 1953. In addition to the major financings (exclusive of Treasury bills) there was seasonal borrowing through the issuance of tax anticipation certificates in the Jul\\-December deficit period. This borrowing was repaid out of heavy tax receipts the following spring. As a result of this seasonal borrowing, the public debt reached a high point in December and was within $1 biUion of the statutory debt limit of $281 billion. In June 1955 the Congress extended, for an additional year, a temporary increase in the limit from $275 billion to $281 billion to permit the Treasury to meet its seasonal borrowing needs during the fiscal year 1956. (For further information on the statutory hmitation on the public debt and guaranteed obligations as of June 30, 1956, see table 26, and for earlier years, see table 27.) 26 1956 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY The following tables summarize the financing operations during the fiscal year and show the results of the public offerings ofmarketable bonds, notes, and certificates of indebtedness.

For the balance of the year each weekly bUl issue was for $1.6 bUlion, the equivalent of the issue maturing. The 13 issues outstanding at the close of the fiscal year 1956 thus totaled $20.8 bUlion, as compared wdth $19.5 bUlion at the beginning of the year. The Treasury also issued 99-day tax anticipation bUls in December 1955 amounting to $1.5 billion, maturing March 23, 1956 and acceptable at par in payment of taxes on March 15. (For additional infermation on all bUl issues see exhibit 5.) During June 1956, $159 miUion of the 2 percent Treas'ury notes maturing August 15, 1956, were purchased for the account of the sinking fund and retired. In addition, $604 million of the regular cash payments on the unexchanged portions of the December 1955 and March 1956 Treasury note maturities was charged against the sinking fund. (Tables 33 and 34 give further information on sinking fund operations.) The heavy demand for credit during the year in excess of the supply of savings, together with the Federal Reserve credit restraint policy, was reflected in rising borrowing costs for the Treasury. The average rate on Treasury bUls, for example, moved up from around IK percent at the beginning of the year to a peak of around 2% percent in April 1956. The weeldy average rates on new biU offerings throughout the year are shown in exhibit 5. The average annual interest rate as computed on the total interest-bearing public debt was 2.576 percent on June 30, 1956, as compared with 2.351 percent a year earlier. (For further detaU on the computed annual interest charge and computed annual interest rate by security classes, see table 43.) The decline of $3.5 bUlion in nonmarketable debt during the year was the largest in history, with more than half of the reduction accounted for by the decrease of $1.9 billion in savings notes. The sale of these notes was discpntinued in October 1953 and by the close of the fiscal year 1956 all outstanding savings notes had matured. (Sales, redemptions, and amounts outstanding of Treasury savings notes of aU series from August 1941 through June 30, 1956, are shown in table 41.) 28 1956 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY The amount of investment bonds outstanding declined by $0.6 billion, principaUy because of the exchange of the 2% percent convertible Series B-1975-80 bonds (mostly issued at the time of the Federal Reserve-Treasury accord in 1951) for marketable 5-year, Iji percent Treasury notes. Changes in the nonmarketable interestbearing debt during the year, by type of security, are shown in the following table.

The underlying purpose of the savings bond program since its inception has been to provide small savers with a safe, liquid, and attractive investment, and at the same time broaden the ownership of the Federal debt. The primary intention of the program has been to encourage thrift as well as to interest citizens through their participation as bondholders in the fiscal affairs of their Government. As alread}^ noted, sales of Series E and H bonds set a new peacetime record in the fiscal year 1956. These bonds continue to be the best vehicle the Treasuiy has for achieving a widespread distribution of the public debt and they are the heart of the Government's effort to promote nationwide thrift. B}^ the end of the fiscal year the amount of Series E and H bonds outstanding (including accrued interest) amounted to $40.9 billionâ€”an alltime high record and an increase of $1.6 billion during the 37'ear. Approximately $15 bUlion of this amount, more than a third of the total outstanding, represent E bonds which have now passed their tenth anniversary and are being held under the Treasuiy's E bond extension program for periods up to another 10 years. REVIEW OF FISCAL OPERATIONS 29 E AND H BONDS, FISCAL YEARS l95l-'56 CHART 5 Since May 1953 savings bond redemptions have been dominated by. the large maturities of Series F and G savings bonds. The peak wartime sales of F and G bonds matured during^ the fiscal year, and as a result the $3.0 billion decline in the amount of these bonds outstanding more than offset the increase in all other series. The total of all series of interest-bearing savings bonds outstanding at the close of the year was $57K biUion. The redemptions of savings bonds as a percentage of the total sold, by 3^early series, are summarized in the accompanying table.

State and local governments, and nonprofit associations. Commercial banks and Federal Eeserve Banks together held $80.8 billion or 30 percent of the debt. The remaining one-fifth of the debt, $53.5 billion, was held by Government investment accounts, primarily social security funds, veterans' insurance funds, and retiremeat funds. Private nonbank investors continued to increase their holdings during this fiscal year, as in 1955, but there was a substantial liquidation of holdings by commercial banks. Holdings by private nonbank investors were up $1.8 billion. Commercial bank portfolios were down $6.5 billion, while the Federal Reserve Banks increased their holdings by less than $0.2 bUlion.
