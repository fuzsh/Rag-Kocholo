This follows upon the large advance in the opening quarter which is measured and reviewed in the summary of the national income and product later in this issue. Demands are rising briskly in most markets. In fact, the only broad area of demand which is still lagging is the foreign market. Exports in recent months have tended lower. With imports rising, and despite a decline in the outflow of capital, the adverse balance in our foreign transactions has continued high. In recent weeks, the gold outflow has resumed after a temporary halt earlier this year. Billion Dollars 400 Persona/ Income ^- 300 200 V -' ..,- .

S. Dep artment of Commerce, Office of Business Economics 59- 5-' Size of income rise The strong current performance of the economy is evidenced clearly by the rise in personal income. Figures for April place the overall total at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $372y2 billion—up more than $3 billion from March and about $7y2 billion from February. Increases in the preceding half year had averaged around $1 billion per month. April personal income was $23 billion, or 6^ percent, larger than in the same month of 1958. The current upsurge in the flow of income to individuals has reflected wholly an enlarged volume of disbursements from productive activity. Transfer payments have changed little as the continuing decline in unemployment insurance benefits has approximately counterbalanced the general uptrend in other types of social insurance benefits. The income expansion has centered primarily in wages and salaries. At annual rates, aggregate payrolls in the economy advanced about $3 billion in both March and April, reaching a record high of $253 billion. Employment up The advance in payrolls, in turn, has derived principally from higher employment, although further increases in hourly earnings and hours worked also have contributed. The employment reports for April indicate an extension of the significant improvement which had been noted for March—sizable gains in number of jobs and an accompanying reduction in unemployment. Seasonally adjusted employment in nonagricultural establishments in April, totaling 51.8 million, was up more than 600,000 from February. Increases in March and April were of roughly similar magnitude, with about half of the total rise reported in manufacturing where it was concentrated in the durable goods industries. Improvement was especially marked in the broad metals group. Employment has also picked up considerably in the con- SURVEY OF CUEEENT BUSINESS struction industry, where more-than-seasonal expansion has occurred in a number of types of projects. Employment increases this spring have been registered by most other broad industrial divisions of the economy—as, for example, trade, services, and finance. Government fiscal position improved The rise in corporate profits and personal incomes in the past year has been a primary factor in the improvement of the Federal Government's fiscal position. As shown in the following section, the $10 billion deficit on national income and product account recorded in the second quarter a year ago had declined to a rate on the order of $2 billion by the opening quarter of this year. For the current quarter, little change in Federal outlays and a further increase in taxes are expected. It seems likely that by midyear the Federal budget as measured in the national income accounts will be approximately in balance on a seasonally adjusted basis. The conventional administrative and cash budgets, on the other hand, will continue to register sizable deficits in the spring quarter. The main reason for this difference is that in these budgets corporate profits taxes are recorded on a receipt basis—rather than on an accrual basis as in the national income accounts—and hence do not yet reflect the recent upturn of corporate profits. Rise in retail sales The steady advance in personal income has been reflected in expanding retail sales. Preliminary figures for April indicate sales for the first 4 months of the year at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $213 billion, 8 percent above the recession period a year ago. Most of this advance was in physical volume. Sales at durable good stores registered another marked I'ise this spring following the large gains made in the closing months of last year. This has been especially true for auto- May 195D motive dealers, which experienced a 10-percent increase in their total sales in the first quarter of this year compared to the fourth quarter of 1958, seasonally adjusted. Sales by building materials and hardware dealers have registered a sharp advance so far this year. Seasonally adjusted, sales in the first quarter were more than 3 percent above the fourth quarter. Furniture and appliance sales have been tending slowly upward for a year. In both of these groups the strength in home buying has been a stimulating factor. Eetail sales of nondurable goods stores were up 5 percent for the first 4 months of the current year from the corresponding period of a year ago; practically all of the rise was in physical volume. Sales of all major groups of nondurables are higher— increases ranging up to 2 percent—than in the closing months of last year. Compared to a year ago, the most marked advances have been registered by general merchandise and drug stores. Sales of food stores have been rising slowly over the past year and in the first quarter of this year were 3 percent above a year ago. These sales were well maintained during the 1957-58 recession. Eetail food prices averaged somewhat lower this year than a year ago so that the dollar sales advance reflects a somewhat larger increase in volume. Little change in overall prices Prices have shown little net change in recent months and now average a little higher than a year ago. Both at retail and wholesale, products of farm origin have shown appreciable declines, and nonagricultural prices have tended upward. For the wholesale group, industrial prices turned up in mid-1958 and since then have risen a little more than 2 percent—about the equivalent of the rate of rise for the 2 years preceding the recent recession, i.e., mid-1955 to mid1957. During that period farm and food prices were also rising most of the time, and the average of all prices showed a rather steady increase. National Income and Product in the First Quarter of 1959 1 HE BUSINESS upswing which began a year ago is continuing to dominate the economic scene, the first-quarter GNP figures show. At a $467 billion annual rate, the Nation's output was up $14 billion from the quarter before and $40 billion above its early 1958 low. These increases are primarily the reflection of gains in the physical volume of production; the overall price advance has been limited during the past year. The expansion of markets since 1959 opened has followed the basic pattern set in the latter part of 1958. Consumer buying and the swing to inventory accumulation each contributed around $5 billion to the latest GNP rise. Housing construction registered another $1V2 billion increase, as did State and local purchases. Net exports declined somewhat further. The rise of Federal Government purchases was checked after the turn of the year, and a limited pickup occurred in business fixed investment. The continued improvement in most of the Nation's markets has affected the national income since mid-1958 chiefly through recovery in the compensation of employees and in corporate profits. The characteristically volatile profits share, which during the business downswing fell $12 billion—or 27 percent—at annual rates has since registered an advance of even larger proportions. This advance and an expansion of $7% billion in employee compensation accounted for most of the $20 billion rise of national income during the second half of last year, to a rate of $373-1/> billion in the final quarter. The further substantial increase which is clear from incomplete data for the opening quarter of 1959 also centered in these components. Personal income has shown a lesser rise in this period. SUKVEY OF CURKENT BUSINESS May 1959 the impact of higher earnings having been cushioned—like the effect of the previous decline—by the contracyclical swing in transfer payments and the short-run insensitivity of corporate dividends to changes in profits. The first year of recovery The first quarter marks the completion of a full year since the 1958 low point of GNP. It is of some interest to compare the expansion of output and employment in this period with the gains recorded during the first four quarters of recovery following the low of 1949 and that of 1954. No two cyclical movements are ever more than broadly alike, of course, and the market readjustment of 1957-59 Percent Changes in Real GNP in Three Postwar Cycles The Drop From previous peak to low qtr. of— differed in many important respects from those recorded in earlier postwar years. The current upswing, for example, owes part of its strength to an inventory buildup which reflects special as well as cyclical factors; on the other hand, the recent decline in net exports has also involved various special circumstances. Conditions in these and most other major markets were appreciably different in early 1955, and of course had been still different in early 1950. Notwithstanding such variations in detail, however, the new quarterly measure of real GNP shows that the advance of close to 8 percent during the past year's recovery was substantially the same as those recorded for the initial year of recovery following the lows of 1949 and 1954. The downward phase, however, was somewhat more severe in the third postwar recession than in its predecessors. This difference is reflected in the lesser extent to which a year of recovery has carried the economy above its previous peak. Real output in the most recent quarter was 2 percent above the highs of early 1957. As the adjacent chart shows, the corresponding gains recorded during the two previous cycles had been somewhat larger than this. Besides these movements in real output the rising value of the GNP has also reflected some advance in average prices, particularly during the business downswing. A comparable rise in the index occurred during the four quarters of business contraction which ended in the spring of 1954, it may be noted. 1949 CONSUMER INCOME AND BUYING 1954 1958 The Fi'rsf Year of Recovery \\ From fhe, recession low to— 2nd qtr. 1950 2nd qtr. 1955 1st qtr. 1959 The Net Movement From previous peak through first year of recovery -10 -5 0 5 10 Percent Change U. S. Department of Commerce, Office of Business Economics 59-5-2 Disposable personal income in the opening quarter of 1959 was at an annual rate of $321 billion, up $5 billion from the previous quarter. The bulk of this advance was reflected in personal consumption expenditures, which reached a first quarter rate above $300 billion. In the absence of significant price changes overall, the 5-percent rise in personal consumption expenditures since early 1958 has been almost matched by an increase in the physical volume of consumption. A recovery in auto buying has accounted for one-fourth of the advance in personal consumption expenditures from year-ago rates. After having reached a seasonally adjusted low of slightly more than $13 billion at the close of the 1958 model year, auto purchases have moved up 30 percent since the introduction of the new models last autumn. Most of the rise was registered early and was followed by a lull. A further moderate gain came late in the first quarter and was extended in April. Thus, late data indicate that a spring upturn in sales may be emerging for the first time since 1955. Consumer purchases of other durables maintained the $23 billion annual rate to which they had returned after mid1958. Contributing to the strong demand for major kitchen goods in particular has been the advance in residential construction. During the recession total consumer purchases of durables other than autos fell only briefly below the plateau which had been maintained through 1956 and 1957. Prices having been stable since late 1957, real sales are also back to the prerecession rate. With purchases of clothing rising above their 1956-57 level and the expansion in food outlays continuing, personal expenditures for nondurable goods reached $145 billion in the first quarter of 1959. In contrast to the experience of last year, the recent gain in dollar outlays for food was accompanied by near-stable prices and involved an increase in real consumption. Since the first quarter of last year food expenditures have grown by about 2^ percent while prices have moved fractionally lower as abnormal supply stringencies eased. SURVEY OF CURRENT BUSINESS 4 Consumer spending on services has continued to increase in each recent quarter as the number of households grew. The slow but steady rise of prices in this area has also continued; during the past year the price advance has contributed nearly as much to total expenditure as has the expansion of real demand. INVESTMENT DEMAND Business inventories and residential construction contintinued as major elements of demand strength; in addition, the opening quarter of the year was marked by some firming of plant and equipment purchases. Advance in inventories Nonfarm inventories rose by $5 billion, at seasonally adjusted annual rates. Anticipated supply shortages contributed to this advance. The move toward restocking was quite pervasive in character, however, and seems to have followed the course of current operating needs, which rose with the continuing upswing in general business activity. ^ Recent inventory changes have been consistent with experience in the comparable stage of the two preceding postwar business cycles. After the upturn in national output in the spring of 1958—as in early 1950 and in the autumn of 1954— inventories continued to be reduced, although the rate of liquidation tapered sharply. The ratio of the physical volume of nonf arm stocks to real GNP dropped well below the postwar average. This ratio declined further in the first quarter, as the rise in production outstripped that in total stocks. A major share of the increase in nonf arm holdings centered in the durable goods manufacturing industries, in which earlier reductions had been particularly heavy. The inventory swing in these lines has been associated with large movements in sales and new orders. Recent developments in this area have been influenced also by anticipations of possible interruption in steel supplies. The advance in the primary and fabricated metals industries carried the holdings of these producers to about the same levels which had been maintained for some time prior to the recession. In the machinery and transportation equipment industries, equally heavy absolute increases left inventories almost one-sixth below the prerecession aggregates. For durable goods manufacturing as a whole the major part of the first-quarter increase was in purchased materials, with more moderate rises recorded in goods in process and in finished goods. Changes in other nonf arm inventories were on the whole much more moderate, though in the aggregate they represented roughly one-third of the total increase. In general these stocks had been subject to far less liquidation than had those of durables manufacturers, and some of them had already begun to show increases in the second half of last year. In nondurable goods manufacturing the principal increases during the first quarter occurred in the food and beverage group and in rubber. In the latter industry strikes materialized in April. The movement of trade stocks reflected mainly the course of auto dealers' holdings. As in the final quarter of 1958, a greater than seasonal expansion in these accompanied improved sales. Residential construction strong Outlays for residential construction during the winter rose $l1/£ billion to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of May 1959 / billion. This was the highest figure on record, being nearly $3 billion above the peak quarters of 1955. The 1955 peak, like the present high, was reached a year after a trough in general business activity. In each case the Federal Government had taken a number of specific steps to help release potential demand for new^ dwelling construction. The administrative and legislative actions of early 1958—lowering downpayment requirements, raising interest rate ceilings, extending the VA programs, and supporting the secondary market—interacted with the general monetary policy and prevailing market forces to make the lending of money on mortgages relatively attractive. As can be seen from the accompanying chart, lenders last year showed rising interest in conventional as well as Government-backed mortgages. This was in contrast to the 1954 experience, when the increases had been heavily concentrated in the FHA-VA segment. The financial aspects of these developments are reviewed in the debt article which appears elsewhere in this issue. Seasonally adjusted housing starts in the first quarter of 1959 wrere more than two-fifths above the low of a year ago. In line with the experience of early 1955, little chang-e in the number of starts has been noted on a monthly basis since the mid-autumn of 1958. As the third panel of the chart shows, the increase in applications for Government-backed mortgages has apparently leveled off also. Business fixed investment firms Business expenditures for fixed investment—producers' durable equipment and construction—registered a modest advance in the opening quarter of the year to an annual rate of $43 billion. This was $5 billion below the prerecession peak, and $2 billion above the low point of last year. In the 1953-55 cycle, business outlays for fixed investment had shown greater strength both in the recession phase and during the recovery. The cyclical swing in plant and equipment spending has centered as usual in manufacturing; the cutback and subsequent expansion in other industries have been less pronounced overall. Among the manufacturing industries the fourth-to-first quarter rise was about equally divided between durable and nondurable goods producers. Outside of manufacturing, the outstanding development of the first quarter was the rise in spending for transportation equipment. Air carriers' outlays increased as the conversion to jet aircraft was stepped up, and the railroads also scored advances. GOVERNMENT DEMAND Total government purchases of GNP rose $1% billion in the first quarter, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $96% billion. The increase centered in State and local governments, and reflected growth in the number of both school and nonschool employees as well as in highway outlays. First-quarter highway spending, at a $6% billion annual rate, was up about 10 percent from a year ago, the increase having accompanied a rise in activity under the Federal -aid highwray programs. The expansion in Federal purchases of goods and services which began a year ago tapered in the opening months of 4 1959 after having carried the total $5 billion above the low recorded in late 1957. The leveling off since the turn of the year reflected primarily the course of nondefense expenditures. Having accounted for over two-thirds of the expansion during 1958 — largely because of a spurt in CCC SUEVEY OF CUEEENT BUSINESS May 1959 price support outlays—nondefense buying dipped in the opening months of 1959. Federal deficit shrinks The first-quarter Federal deficit on income and product account appears to have been around $2 billion, at seasonally adjusted annual rates. The substantial decline from the $7^ billion of the previous quarter and the peak $10 billion reached in mid-1958 has reflected mainly the recovery in corporate tax accruals and a rise in social security contributions. Higher ^ yields from other taxes have also contributed to the improvement, the individual income tax accounting for the bulk of the rise in these. On the expenditure side, a decline in total payments for unemployment compensation has helped considerably to improve the budgetary position. Residential Construction Spending at new high . . . 20 Corporate profits taxes in the national income accounts, being measured on an accrual basis, have reflected immediately the vigorous rebound since last summer in corporate profits. The conventional administrative and cash budgets count taxes on a when-collected basis, and accordingly do not yet show the effects of the current improvement in the tax base. Social security legislation which went into effect January 1 increased the scale of benefits as well as that of contributions. The growth of payrolls with general business recovery was reflected in the course of social security fund receipts; the $2 billion rise in the annual rate of such receipts in the first quarter was due mainly, however, to changes in the tax provisions for the support of the Old Age and Survivors Insurance program. Employer and employee contributions were increased from 2*4 to 21/^ percent of covered earnings, rates for self-employed workers were also advanced, and the maximum amount of taxable earnings for any individual was raised from $4,200 to $4,800. At the same time1 benefits went up by an average of 7 percent, resulting in a $ /2 billion rise in the annual rate of payments. Net exports off VALUE PUT IN PLACE The recent downward movement in net exports continued in the opening months of 1959. Merchandise exports, which during 1958 had been approximately stable from quarter to quarter at an annual rate of a little over $16 billion, dipped after the turn of the year. Merchandise imports extended the strong upward movement which has been apparent since the second half of 1958. In part, this uptrend has been associated with the economic recovery here. There has been some growth in the demand for industrial materials and certain types of equipment, and purchases of a variety of consumer goods have continued to increase, reflecting a mixture of cyclical and special circumstances. Petroleum imports expanded at the end of 1958 and rose further early in 1959. A factor in the movement was the prospect of mandatory import quotas; these went into effect early in March, after having been under discussion for some time. 10 0 I i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i t i i i i i i i after upswing in starts 2.0 PRIVATE STARTS 2 'c e .o S THE FLOW OF INCOME 1.0 ii Rise checked in applications for FHA-VA commitments 2.0 APPLICATIONS 1.0 1952 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 Quarterly Totals, Seasonally Adjusted, at Annual Rates B a s i c d a t a ; BLS, BDSA, FHA,and VA U. S. Department of Commerce, Office of Business Economics 59-5-3 Reflecting the upturn in market demand, national income advanced strongly during the second half of last year. The annual rate of $373% billion reached in the closing quarter was $22 billion above the low level of early 1958 and $5 billion above the mid-1957 peak. The rate of increase during the latter half of 1958 was about $10 billion per quarter. Although data are as yet incomplete, present indications are that a further increase at least as large took place in the initial quarter of 1959. Corporate profits accounted for about three-fifths of the rise in national income which occurred from the opening to the closing quarter of last year. Most of the remaining upswing was in employee compensation and in earnings of nonf arm proprietors, although property income shares also edged up during 1958. Farm income reached a high in the spring quarter and, though tending somewhat downward since then, remained substantially above its 1957 level. Employee compensation at new peak Having fallen sharply after mid-1957 and leveled off in the first half of last year, total employee compensation advanced in each succeeding quarter.

Since the spring of 1958 payrolls have also reflected an upturn in average weekly hours of work and a recovery in employment. Employment has moved up more slowly than the other factors affecting the wage-salary total, and as recently as last March was about 2 percent less than in the third quarter of 1957. At a comparable point in the 1954-55 cyclical upswing, it may be noted, employment was about 1 percent above the preceding peak. This difference reflected mainly the lesser advance reported for nonmanufacturing employment this time than last. For manufacturing as a whole, employment in March of this year was about 5 percent less than in mid-1957; this was about the same relative shortfall as the one found at a comparable stage of the preceding cyclical upswing. Employment in nonmanufacturing industries is reported about even with the prerecession high; after a year of business recovery from the 1954 recession, it was 3 percent above the previous peak. The current statistics on employment outside of manufacturing are preliminary, however, and revisions in them may affect this comparison somewhat. (Continued on page 26} b John A. Gorman Public and Private Debt in 1958-59 1 HE CHARACTER and volume of debt formation were markedly affected by the business recession that terminated early last year, and by the subsequent recovery. The business recession centered in the production of durable goods, with sharp cutbacks in durables inventories, business fixed investment, and consumer durable purchases. During the downswing, corporate and consumer borrowing, which are closely associated with these outlays, fell off. As the economy recovered in the latter part of 1958, outlays on durable goods stabilized or advanced, as did the associated forms of debt. With continued strong recovery so far this year, such debt has risen further. Government borrowing advanced sharply last year with the rise in expenditures and decline in tax receipts; and a spurt in residential construction activity was. accompanied by a considerable expansion in residential mortgage debt. Debt changes in 1958 Net public and private debt outstanding at the end of 1958 amounted to over $770 billion, an increase of $34 billion having taken place during the year. In 1957, the total outstanding had risen $29 billion. The step-up last year in the rate of debt formation is traceable chiefly to an $8 billion advance in Federal net debt, which had been reduced in the preceding 2 years. The rise in State and local debt about maintained its 1957 pace, amounting to around $4 billion for the year. Corporations reduced their current liabilities sharply in the aggregate and their total net debt rose only $3 billion, after having expanded $12 billion the year before. Persons and unincorporated enterprises borrowed a net total of close to $19 billion, $5 billion more than in 1957. Nonfarm mortgage debt increased almost $13 billion, the second largest rise in such debt in the postwar period. Farm debt also expanded, as did financial and commercial obligations; little change was reported in the outstanding total of consumer credit. Rise in 1959 Debt developments so far this year have continued to reflect the progress of the business recovery. As detailed elsewhere in the SURVEY, nearly all major categories of demand have moved up in this period. Particularly important for the current debt situation have been the recovery of consumer auto buying, the record value of housing activity, and the higher spending by business for inventories and fixed facilities. With these developments, nearly all major categories of private borrowers have stepped up their demands on the NOTE.—MR.

Public debt formation has remained high. State and local issues have continued to appear in near-record volume. Expenditures exceeded receipts for the Federal Government also in the early months of the year; most of the rise in tax accruals had not yet been reflected in collections. SAVING AND INVESTMENT The recession phase of last year's cyclical swing in business was marked by a sharp reduction in private investment. For the year as a whole, such investment was down substantially from 1957, the rise in residential construction having only partially offset the decline in business outlays for capital investment. Gross private saving was almost unchanged from the 1957 total. The rate of saving was off slightly in the early months of the recession, as the drop in gross undistributed earnings of corporations exceeded the rise in personal saving. With the improvement in business, however, both components were higher in the second half. For all governments combined, the recession brought a substantial swing in budgetary position, from a modest surplus to a substantial deficit, The change was most marked in the case of the Federal Government, but was also apparent for State and local governments, which as a group recorded a somewhat larger deficit on income and product account last year than the year before. With demands for private funds off and governmental requirements up, there was a corresponding shift in the pattern of borrowing. Total private debt formation of $22 billion last year was down from 1957. Government borrowing, totaling over $12 billion, showed a sharp rise from 1957. Corporations and persons alike moved in the direction of increased liquidity last year. With corporate saving high and tangible investment down, nonfinancial corporations added to their holdings of cash and U.S. Government obligations; their outstanding indebtedness rose only about 1 percent, and there was considerable refinancing of short-term into long-term obligations. Personal investment outlays rose somewhat last year, as increased purchases of houses and a buildup of farm inventories offset decreases in other categories. The rise in investment purchases was financed mainly by borrowing. With saving unchanged, persons acquired about the same total of financial assets in 1958 as in the previous year, but showed a marked preference for fixed-value claims. In particular, deposits with banks and other financial institutions increased sharply. With the help of these funds, the institutions in turn financed a record expansion in their assets. SURVEY OF CUEKENT BUSINESS y 1059 Monetary and credit policy An increase in the volume of liquid assets was facilitated by Federal Reserve operations as the recession deepened in early 1958. The monetary authorities utilized all the major instruments at their disposal to ease credit conditions and to expand the lending capacity of the banking system. Discount rates, which already had been reduced in late 1957, were cut further in the first half of last year. Eeserve requirements against demand deposits were reduced, while the effects of a gold outflow were approximately offset by open market purchases of securities. These actions provided the basis for a record peacetime expansion in the money supply. Demand deposits (adjusted) were up $5*4 billion over the year. Time deposits in commercial banks rose $7^ billion. The bulk of the monetary expansion in 1958 occurred during the first half. After the business upturn the monetary authorities limited the expansion in bank credit to seasonal demands, and the discount rate was raised twice. With business demand for loan funds being slack during most of the year, commercial banks used their expanded lending capacity to purchase Government securities in an amount about equal to net Treasury borrowing. The banks also acquired a record volume of municipals and w^ere active in the mortgage market. With the supply of funds up and loan demand off, interest rates fell during the business recession. This movement was reversed after midyear as the economy recovered and the pace of borrowing increased. The fall which occured was steeper in short- than in longer-term rates; the subsequent rise has not yet brought complete recovery in the case of short-term issues. Bond yields had moved above their previous peaks by the turn of the year. While the movement in interest rates generally conformed to supply and demand conditions, the timing and extent of the changes, partly reflected market anticipation of the shifts in these conditions. Thus the steepest drop in yields came in the early months of the recession, and before there had been any substantial increase in the money supply; and the rise in yields was sharpest just at the outset of the business recovery. The abrupt turnaround in interest rates early last summer, in particular, was preceded and accompanied by speculative activity in the bond markets, involving substantial buying on margin. With the economic outlook improving and the prospect of a marked increase in the supply of Federal obligations, there followed substantial liquidation of margined and other holdings. This switch intensified the rise in interest rates during the summer, when bond prices underwent the sharpest break in many years.

ISTet Federal Government and agency debt1 rose 3% percent during calendar 1958, to reach a total of $232 /£ billion. This was the largest increase in the postwar period. Gross debt amounted to $310% billion at yearend, after an expansion a little greater than that in net debt. While intra-governmental holdings of Treasury obligations were off $1 billion, Treasury advances to other Government agencies rose bv $li/2 billion. Last year's increase in Federal debt matched the substan- 10 SURVEY OF CURRENT BUSINESS tial Federal deficit on income and product account. Government outlays rose with the increases in personal transfer payments, agricultural price support activity, and grants-inaid under the highway program. At the same time Federal receipts fell off. Corporate tax accruals shrank with the tax base, arid yields from various other levies tapered. With expenditures up $71/2 billion and taxes down $3i/> billion, the $3 billion surplus in national income and product account realized in 1957 was replaced in 1958 by an $8 billion deficit. (The Administrative Budget showed a similar movement, but on a somewhat lesser scale since itmeasures taxes in terms of collections rather than accruals and shows expenditures exclusive of trust account transactions.) The rise in public holdings of Treasury obligations amounted to $9 billion. Close to $1 billion of this involved no change in net debt, however, since it replaced Federal agency securities in the hands of the public. Underlying the decline in the latter was a shift in the method of financing the activities of the Federal National Mortgage Association. During 1957, this agency had issued about $2 billion of debentures to the public, using more than half the proceeds to repay previous Treasury advances. Last year this procedure was reversed, nearly a billion dollars of publicly held debt being paid off as the Association increased its borrowing from the Treasury. Commercial banks acquired $8 billion of Federal Govern11lent securities during the calendar year. (See chart.) The Federal Reserve System purchased $2 billion in implementing its policy of monetary ease, and holdings by nonfinancial corporations rose about $1 billion, providing an outlet for the companies' liquid funds. Individuals, in contrast, reduced their holdings of Federal securities by about $2% billion last year. A half-billion dollars of this reduction represented a continued decline in savings bonds—which, however, was substantially less than the $2 billion net redemption of 1957 and was concentrated among the issues of larger denomination. Persons acquired a net total of almost $1 billion in Series E and H savings bonds, as sales rose above 1957 and redemptions prior to maturity fell off. Although such redemptions were down for the Nation as a whole from the exceptionally heavy 1957 volume, there was some indication of increased redemptions in geographic areas where the recession was especially severe. Individuals reduced their holdings of marketable Federal obligations by about $2 billion, reversing the 1956-57 buildup. These securities are available only in large denominations, so that their ownership is restricted for the most part to higher income groups in the population. The 1958 reduction in individuals' holdings involved some taking of capital gains on such bonds during the first half; the attractiveness of such securities was also reduced by the upward movement in the stock market as business improved. With calls on life insurance companies' loan funds down, a small net increase in Federal securities held by the carriers (included in other institutions in the chart) reversed an 11year decline. The business downswing was in similar fashion reflected in the portfolios of mutual savings banks, fire and casualty insurance companies, and trusteed pension plans, as all these groups reported a slowing in the rate of Federal security liquidation. Savings and loan associations have been steady purchasers of government securities in recent years, since their liquidity requirements have increased in line with the advance in their share capital. They continued to build up their holdings last year. State and local governments took a substantially smaller Mav 1050 volume of Federal obligations for their investment funds than in any other recent period. The increasing stringency of State and local finances generally may have been a factor in this slowdown. Foreign holdings, including those of central banks, were about the same at the end of 1958 as at the beginning. In the first half of the year, however, foreign central banks and other official institutions reduced their holdings of short-term Federal securities by about $1 billion, investing the proceeds in time deposits at commercial banks, which afforded a higher yield. As interest returns rose in the latter half of the year, foreign central banks reacquired about $1 billion of these short-term Governments. Although Treasury borrowing amounted to $9 billion on a net basis, the marketable portion rose by $11^ billion last year, as $2*4 billion of nonmarketable securities matured or were redeemed prior to maturity. The rise in marketable Federal debt extended to all major instrument classes. During the period of relatively low interest rates in the first half, the Treasury issued bonds with maturities of 27 and 32 years, carrying coupon rates of 314 and 3^ percent respectively—in contrast with the o% Commercial Banks Acquired Bulk of Federal Debt Increase in 1958 DEBT INCREASE Changes in Holdings: Commercial Banks Federal Reser Banks Nonfinancial Corporations Other Institutions -2-3 » Individuals Data.

Substantial amounts of bonds maturing in 6 to 8 years were floated in this period, and the Treasury also issued a number of medium term notes carrying substantially lower interest rates than previously. After the advance in interest rates which began around the middle of the year, the Treasury relied more on certificates and other short-term obligations. So far in 1959, the Treasury has continued to depend mainly on short-term offerings, although bond issues of limited size were floated in January and March. A recent innovation in Treasury financing1 is the issue of 6- and 9-month bills, to complement the 3- and 12-month issues previously available by providing a wider ranire of short-term maturities for investors. SUEVEY OF CUKKENT BUSINESS May 1959 State and local government debt The net debt of State and local governments to other economic units amounted to $51 billion on June 30, 1958, about $4 billion more than a year earlier. (These comprehensive statistics of State and local government debt outstanding, unlike other figures presented in this report, are not prepared on a calendar-year basis.) The pace of new borrowing was stepped up during calendar 1958 as State and local governments expanded construction of schools and highways. As indicated elsewhere in the SURVEY, this rise in construction activity helped to sustain business during the recession and has been one of the factors in the recovery. It was financed in part through higher Federal grants-in-aid, particularly for highways. In addition current revenues played their usual important role as a source of funds for these purposes. Two and a half billion dollars of the increased lending capacity of commercial banks was applied to the acquisition of State and local government obligations—the largest annual volume of such purchases on record. Other important sources of loan funds included nonlife insurance companies and individual investors. CORPORATE FINANCING Last year's recession was clearly apparent in the pattern of corporate fund uses and sources. While liquid asset holdings were increased, physical investment fell 12^ billion, as inventories were liquidated and plant and equipment spending was cut back. Internal fund sources were off moderately, a sharp fall in retained earnings being partly offset by a continued advance in depreciation allowances. Demand for new external funds declined steeply. Short-term liabilities of nonfinancial corporations were reduced $6 billion after having held about even during 1957, and long-term borrowing slowed. Need for funds down Nonfinancial corporations reduced their inventories $5 billion last year. The decline reached a peak in the second quarter. It was checked toward yearend, and inventory accumulation was resumed around the turn of the current Plant and equipment spending was also reduced in 1958. Such outlays by nonfinancial corporations amounted to 8261/2 billion last year, 20 percent less than in 1957. The fall ceased after midyear, and by early 1959 a moderate rise was reported. Internal fund sources showed the effect of the business cycle in a $3^ billion decline in retained earnings, which totaled $5 billion last year. Profits fell sharply in the manufacturing, mining, and transportation industries in particular. With the continued rise in depreciation allowances, however, the total decline in the flow of internal funds amounted to only about $2 billion, as compared with the $12^ billion drop in physical investment. Reflecting these changes the purchase of tangible assets absorbed only about 80 percent of the internal funds which became available, leaving $5 billion for acquisition of financial assets and retirement of debt. Cash and bank deposits of nonfinancial corporations rose $'2y2 billion. Part of this advance reflected a sharp increase in corporate ownership of time deposits in commercial banks. Corporations also increased their holdings of U.S. Govern- 11 ment securities. The bulk of these purchases were made late in the year, as internal fund sources mounted with the business recovery while physical investment remained low. Borrowing of capital The net debt of all corporations amounted to $247 billion at the end of 1958. This measure is shown in table 1. It covers not only nonfinancial corporations but certain obligations of banks and insurance companies as well. These obligations rose $1 billion during 1958, in line with recentyear growth trends. The other changes in corporate debt indicated for last year by the table reflect primarily the experience of nonfinancial corporations. Although the increase in long-term corporate debt was substantial, net new borrowing was about $3 billion less than in 1957. The decline in plant and equipment spending was a principal factor in this slowdown, which would have been greater but for the extensive refinancing of short-term bank debt into longer maturities during the period of low interest rates early in the year. This pattern of developments was especially marked in the manufacturing, mining, and transportation industry groups. Also helping to sustain the pace of long-term borrowing was the high level of investment activity maintained in the public utility industries, which were relatively unaffected by the recession. These industry groups rely heavily on borrowing to finance their capital improvement programs. Short-term liabilities of nonfinancial corporations fell $6 billion last year. This decline involved a sharp contraction in notes and accounts payable, together with a lesser total of accrued income tax liabilities outstanding at yearend than at the end of 1957. The fall in notes and accounts payable, which centered in debt to banks, was associated with the liquidation of inventories. In each of the three postwar business cycles, such liabilities fell sharply during the recession phase and then increased during the recovery period as inventories were rebuilt. The reduction in short-term bank loans accounted for about two-thirds of the drop in notes and accounts payable. Such loans had risen sharply during the 1955-57 expansion. The balance of the decrease in corporate short-term liabilities stemmed from a reduction in outstanding trade credit. The drop from 1957 to 1958 in the yearend total of accrued Federal income tax liabilities which is reflected in the \"other liabilities\" of corporate business in Table 1, accompanied the decline in taxable corporate profits during the business recession. A speedup in the schedule of tax payments also helped lower the level of these obligations. The advance in the liabilities of banks and insurance companies (exclusive of deposits and life insurance company policy reserves) continued at approximately the recent year rate. Unearned premiums of fire and casualty insurance companies, the principal components of these obligations, have grown with the rising value of insured properties and with recent rate increases. PERSONAL SAVING AND INVESTMENT Personal saving last year totaled $21 billion, about the same as in the previous year. Investment in physical assets rose slightly, an increase in residential and institutional construction and a buildup in farm inventories offsetting a fail in the plant, equipment, and inventory investment in unincorporated businesses.

JMav 1059 SURVEY OF CURRENT BUSINESS The notion of saving as an internal fund source is much less useful here than in the case of corporate business, because of the extent to which personal saving and investing are done by different individuals. If the individuals who invest in tangible assets in any given year were considered as a separate group, their investment funds would probably be seen to come predominantly from external sources. Home buyers, for example, generally rely only to a very limited extent on their own current-period savings. A substantial part of individuals' tangible investment, however, is financed by the savings of other individuals. Part of this financing is direct, through interpersonal loans. A much larger part is accomplished through savings institutions as intermediaries. Because of this latter circumstance, the 1958 shift of financial investment toward the more liquid forms which these institutions provide seems to have helped increase the availability of mortgage loan funds. Time deposits at commercial and mutual banks rose nearly $8 billion. Shares held in savings and loan associations and credit unions increased $6% billion. Demand deposits were also reported higher. Although total holdings of U.S. Government securities declined, it is noteworthy that series E and PI savings bonds showed a net increase of almost $1 billion; such a shift toward fixed-value claims has been a feature of the downward phase of each postwar recession. At the same time that savings accounts were rising, individuals apparently took a smaller share not only of Federal marketable securities but also of new municipal and corporate issues than in 1957. As business recovered there was an increase in stock market activity. The bulk of such activity represents sales from one person to another and does not appear in the standard statistics on personal asset acquisition. The importance of the rise in stock prices for interest rates and the bond market has already been noted. The debt of individuals and unincorporated enterprises rose by nearly $19 billion, $5 billion more than during 1957. Mortagage debt was up to $13 billion. Farm, financial, and commercial debt also expanded, while consumer credit showed little change over the year. Mortgage debt spurts Mortgage debt owed by individuals and unincorporated enterprises rose 10 percent last year to a total of $145 billion. This increase was second only to the 15 percent expansion reported for 1955. As residential construction activity increased and a marked upsurge developed in the sales of existing homes, mortgage debt on housing rose $10^ billion. The increase in residential construction last year was one of the sharpest on record. It came after two years of declining activity, and provided a stimulus to the upward movement of the entire economy in the recovery phase of the business cycle. There has been a general shift from tenancy to home ownership in the years since the end of World War II. At the end of that conflict about two-fifths of the Nation's families owned their own dwellings. Today, the proportion of owner-occupancy has reached three-fifths. The impressive advance in home ownership and an associated upgrading of housing standards, combined with the substantial growth in population, have involved a heavy construction of new homes. This has tended to add strength to overall market demand, and particularly to cyclical advances, during the entire postwar period. Fluctuations in housing demand during this period have reflected to a very large extent variations in the supply of mortgage money. Stringencies in this supply have tended to affect most strongly the availability of FHA and VA loans; fixed yields, 13 the uncertainty of discounts, and a relatively low equity ratio have reduced the attractiveness of these instruments to lenders in tight-money periods. The changes in Government-backed mortgage lending are shown in the accompanying chart. Several conditions contributed to an expansion in the supply of mortgage credit last year: reduced corporate demands on the money and capital markets; the freeing of bank reserves by the cut in reserve requirements; the record volume of savings deposits in financial institutions; and the commitment by the Federal National Mortgage Association of $1 billion for the purchase of Government-backed mortgages.

Department of Commerce, Office of Business Economics 59-5-7 These conditions were reflected in a sharp expansion in conventional mortgage lending, which has been stable in other recent years, as well as in FHA-insured loans. In addition to the factors affecting the supply of mortgage money in general, certain specific Government actions helped to stimulate the volume of lending covered by FHA insurance. The allowable FHA interest rate had been raised to 5*4 percent in August 1957, and in April 1958 minimum downpayment requirements were reduced. The new rate on FHA-insured mortgages represented an attractive yield, and discounts practically disappeared during the period of capital market ease. Though moderate discounts reappeared on such instruments with the return of tighter conditions in the second half, a large volume of loan funds was forthcoming. Over the year as a whole the 1958 increase in FHA loans outstanding was greater than in any other two postwar years combined. (New VA-guaranteed mortgage lending fell short of repayments on previous loans, though the volume of such lending rose toward yearend.) SUKVEY OF CURRENT BUSINESS 14 The Federal National Mortgage Association was authorized to acquire $1 billion in new mortgages, and a substantial number of houses were started under this program late in the year. Because of the time lag between starts and sales, very little of this money was disbursed by the FNMA during the year, but the commitments made facilitated the borrowing of construction money. Home mortgage lending by commercial banks amounted to $iy2 billion last year; in 1957 such institutions reported little net change in such loans. Over half the increase went into conventional loans, while FHA-iiisured loans accounted for the balance. Mutual savings banks also acquired about $iy2 billion of home mortgages; this compares with $1 billion in 1957. Last year's mortgage lending was concentrated in FHAand VA-backed loans; mutual banks were the only financial institutions which reported substantial acquisitions of the latter. Savings and loan associations acquired almost half of the net total of all home mortgage debt incurred last year, and accounted for two-thirds of the growth in conventional mortgages, as a record inflow of savings provided ample funds. Life insurance company lending was down somewhat for last year as a whole. Toward the end of the year, however, mortgage activity by the companies rose, and increased commitments were made to purchase mortgages during 1959. Life companies' acquisition of home mortgages tends to lag somewhat behind increases in building activity, since such institutions do not normally finance home construction. The volume of home mortgage loans acquired by individuals and other investors increased somewhat last year over the 1957 rate. Mortgages on multifamily residential and commercial properties rose $2i/2 billion to a yearend total of $32 billion. The increase last year was substantially greater than in 1957. There has been a sharp pickup in apartment-house building activity in the last 2 years, the number of dwelling units started in multifamily structures having increased 40 perTable 2.—Individual and Unincorporated Enterprise Debt, End of Calendar Year, 1954-58 [Billions of dollars] 1954 1955 1956 1957 Total individual and noncorpo165.4 190.2 207.3 221.0 ate debt 1958 239.7 17. 6 18. 8 19. 5 20. 3 23. 3 8. 3 9. 3 9 1 9. 7 9. 9 9. 6 10. 5 9. 8 11. 2 12. 1 147. 8 171. 4 187. 8 200. 8 216. 5 Nonfarm mortgage 1—4 family residential Multifamily residential and commercial 94. 7 108. 8 121. 2 131. 6 71. 9 83. 8 94. 1 102. 2 144. 4 112. 1 22. 8 24. 9 27. 2 29. 4 32. 2 Other nonfarm Commercial Financial 3 Consumer 53. 1 10. 4 10. 4 32. 3 62. 6 12. 4 11. 6 38. 7 66. 5 13. 3 11. 1 42. 1 69. 2 13. 3 11. 1 44. 8 72. 1 14. 2 12. 8 45. 1 Farm, total _ l Farm mortgage _ Farm production loans 2 Nonfarm, total 1.

The accompanying rise in mortgage debt was financed principally by commercial banks, mutual savings banks, and life insurance companies. Consumer borrowing Consumer credit outstanding at the end of last year amounted to a little over $45 billion, practically unchanged from the end of 1957. While automobile loans were down $11/2 billion for the year, increases were reported in personal installment loans and most other categories of consumer credit. Xew extensions of automobile credit during 1958 were $21/2 billion less than in 1957, as personal consumption expenditures for automobiles and parts fell $3 billion. The drop in auto credit extensions, like that in purchases, came early in the year. Both purchases and new borrowing remained steady at the lower levels until the introduction of the new models in the final quarter, when they moved sharply upward. With improvement in auto sales so far this year, automobile credit has continued to expand. The increase in personal loans, w^hile substantial, was somewhat less than had been recorded during 1957, as net new lending slowed in the recession months. With the business recovery such loans resumed their recent-year rate of advance, and at the beginning of 1959 totaled $% billion more than a year earlier. Consumer credit held by commercial banks showed practically no change last year, a decline in auto and other durable goods paper offsetting expansion in personal in(Continued on page 23) b Betty C. Churchill Rise in the Business Population c _ ONCEENS operating in the United States numbered 4.6 mill ion at the end of 1958, up 55,000 firms or iy± percent from a year earlier. This continues the small net gains that have been characteristic of recent years. The average annual rise over the past decade has been 60,000, with the highest years being 1955 and 1956. Among the major groups, the number of firms in the service and finance divisions—each up about 2^ percent—showed the largest relative gains in 1958. Wholesale trade and contract construction each increased roughly 2 percent, and the transportation division about 1 percent. Retail trade gained one-half of 1 percent last year; continued advances in filling stations and the automotive groups tended to balance further declines among general merchandise and food firms. The number of firms in manufacturing and in mining and quarrying declined slightly during 1958. new businesses have been quite steady since 1949 and discontinuances since 1944. On a seasonally adjusted basis, new and discontinued businesses since 1950 have more often than not moved in the same direction quarter by quarter so that the net increments by which the business population changes (lower panel of the chart below) show more stability than either of its components. The business population has gained an average of about 16,000 firms per quarter from 1950 to date, The slowing down of business activity during 1953-54 and 1957-58 resulted in a much smaller rise while greater than average net changes occurred during all of 1955 and 1956. Growth in the business population began to slacken during 1956 although not declining appreciably below the average for recent years until late 1957. New quarterly series Business Turnover This article presents, for 1951 and later years, a general revision of the business population estimates regularly prepared by the Office of Business Economics (tables 2 and 3). Introduced for the first time in the adjacent chart and in table 1 are seasonally adjusted quarterly estimates of the business population. Previously all business population estimates were available with a time lag of 6 months, and starting in 1953 these series were prepared only semiannually. In the new seasonally adjusted series for the business population as a whole, the time lag has been reduced to about 1 month and the overall estimates have been restored to a quarterly basis, although the method used does not yield industry or other breakdowns. Quarterly movements within years and estimates for the two most current quarters are based on tabulations obtained from the Bureau of Old-Age and Survivors Insurance and from information on changes in the number of telephones. Thousand Firms (ratio scale) Steady rise in concerns Most conspicuous in the chart on turnover in the business population is the reconversion period following World War II during which a marked \"deficit/' in the number of operating concerns was made up. The number of new businesses exceeds the number discontinued in each quarter of the period shown except the third of 1949. That brief interruption in the quarterly increase in seasonally adjusted operating concerns is probably as much a reaction from the marked growth during the reconversion period as a reflection of the recessionary influences of that year. The chart suggests an upward trend in both new and discontinued businesses starting in 1949 and continuing to date. On a rate basis, however, as shown in the chart on page IT NOTE.—MISS CHURCHILL IS A MEMBER OF THE BUSINESS STRUCTURE DIVISION, OFFICE OF BUSINESS ECONOMICS. 200 100 80 60 Discontinued Businesses 40 Thousand Firms 150 Net Change in Business Population 100 - 50 1945 55 Quarterly, Seasonally Adjusted U.

Department of Commerce, Office of Business Economics 60 16 SURVEY OF CURRENT BUSINESS Distribution of firms Business population statistics relate to the entire private economy of the United States 1 but do not include activities classified in agriculture and the professional services. Each .legal entity is counted only once and is classified by industry according to the major activity of the firm as a whole. There is no cutoff based on size of firm except that a selfemployed person is not considered a business firm unless he has either at least one paid employee or an established place of business. Firms in the business population as definecl account for 85 percent of the income originating in the private economy and provide employment to a similar percentage of all nongovernmental wage and salaried workers. The comparable proportions inclusive of Government are 75 and 70 percent, respectively. Small concerns comprise the bulk of the business population; about two-fifths of all firms have no employees, threefourths have fewer than four, and only one firm in twenty employs twenty or more. Retail trade and the service industries, the two major industry divisions directly serving the ultimate consumer, together account for three-fifths of all operating concerns. The proportion of all businesses found in the remaining broad industry divisions ranges from 10 percent in construction to about 1 percent in mining and quarrying. Long- and short-term changes This article is primarily concerned with changes in the business population since 1951. A brief review of longterm trends and cyclical movements in number of operating concerns is provided to furnish perspective for recent periods. Over the long-term, growth in the business population has been primarily affected by the underlying growth of real demand and output, combined with the increase in the human population. In 1900 there were roughly 1.6 million noiifarm businesses in the United States—or about 21 firms for each 1,000 persons; currently there are about 26% firms per 1,000 persons. In other words, over the long-term relative growth in number of businesses has exceeded that in number of persons. Although the business population is relatively more stable than many other economic series, it is responsive to changes in economic conditions. Thus the number of firms per 1,0000 persons, which had reached 25 by 1929, fell during the depression to 22 in 1933, and did not regain the 25 until 1939. During World War II the number of firms per 1,000 persons again dropped to 22 in 1943 and 1944. In 1948 toward the end of the reconversion period, per capita firms in operation reached 27, and then declined slightly to 26.5 where it has remained for the past 5 years. The response of the business population to changes in business conditions is brought out in another way in the chart on page 17, which shows the actual number of firms in operation as well as the number \"expected\" on the basis of a relationship with real gross national product and time.2 During the thirties, and since 1947, the expected and actual numbers of firms in operation are quite close, while the 1. Data for Alaska and Hawaii are not at present included. 2. The equation for this relationship is: Yr=2250 + 5.5i5x-f 13.9t where Y=: firms in thousands, x —private nonfarin gross national product in billions of 1954 dollars and t = year—1929. The 'equation was derived from the 1929-40 period; R-' = .984. An equation fitted to the years 1929-40 plus 1950-^58 yields calculated values differing from those obtained from the equation above by no more than plus or minus .4 percent in any year. The equation based on the longer term is Y=:2267-f-5.35x4-15.4t; R-—'.998. May 1059 large \"deficit\" which developed during the war was quickly made up after hostilities ceased. Variations since 1951 Table 2 presents revised annual estimates of the business population and its turnover from 1951 to date, while table 3 provides additional industry detail for the combined 5year period from 1951 through 1955. Comparable business population estimates by major industry divisions for the years 1929-50 and by detailed industry for 1945-50 can be found in the January 1954 issue of the SURVEY. The revision is primarily based on complete tabulations of employers filing social security tax returns for the first quarters of 1951 and 1956. It should be noted that for periods following the first quarter of 1956 the estimates are essentially extrapolations which are subject to revision when later benchmark data become available. The revision removes a downward bias of 3 percent in the number of operating concerns between the 1951 and 1956 benchmarks; the extrapolation of the higher level brought the revision to 5 percent in 1958, with generally little effect upon inter-industry relationships. From 1951 to 1958 the business population increased by about half a million firms or 13 percent. In these 8 years, contract construction and the finance division gained relatively the most with the service industries, wholesale trade, and the transportation division also showing better than average relative gains. Retail trade also showed a gain, with large relative increases among motor vehicle and accessory dealers and firms operating filling stations more than offsetting declines in the number of general merchandise and food firms. Manufacturing among the major industry divisions shows the smallest relative growth in number of concerns for the 8 years 1951 through 1958.

The general merchandise group contains not only department and variety stores but the '\"general stores'' characteristic of rural areas. Decreases in the number of general stores are probably responsible for the decline of the group as a whole with the tendency toward suburban shopping centers acting as a brake on expansion. Suburban shopping centers are more likely to include branches of centrally located stores than independent retailers. During the 1951-55 period, business services and miscellaneous repair shops and hotels and other lodging places were the service groups expanding most rapidly, (Changes within the remaining service groups ranged between a gahi Patterns of BUSINESS TURNOVER RATES -__ _ 4,557 4 570 4 586 4 6(13 4, 621 4, 149 4 167 4, 184 4 201 Source: U.S. Department of Commerce, Office of Business Economics. goods manufacturers dropped slightly during 1951. regained the loss the following year and has shown steady though small declines each year since 1958. During the two recessionary periods 1958-54 and 1957-58, growth in the business population as a whole was slowed. Manufacturing, mining, and the transportation divisions were most responsive to the slowdowns while the service industries and wholesale trade were little affected. The most industry detail in which business population estimates are prepared is that shown in table 3; such data are not now available beyond the end of 1955. Although each of the major industry devisions shared in the increase in number of operating concerns over the 5 years 1951-55. this pattern does not extend to more closely-defined industry groups within the three divisions for which more industry detail is available. Manufacturing, for example, shows the smallest of the relative increases among the major industry divisions. Six of the nineteen manufacturing groups declined between January 1, 1951 and the beginning of 1956, with the largest relative decreases occurring among textile, leather, and apparel manufacturers. Six industries increased more than 15 percent in the 5-year period: rubber and petroleum refining in the nondurables, while the remainder were metalfabricating industries. Among retail trade firms, filling stations increased relatively the most. The growth in number of discount houses may explain in part the large relative increase among firms dealing in appliances and radios, The continuing trend toward supermarkets is reflected in the steady declines among food firms. Each of the three categories of food firms declined from 1951 to 1956, and these three are the only detailed industry groups shown in 503956—59——3 17 RETAIL TRADE 200 100 0 CONSTRUCTION 500 400 300 200 100 0 300 MANUFACTURING 200 100 0 1940 45 50 55 U.

Turnover in business concerns < During 1958, there were 411,000 new and 356,000 discontinued businesses; in addition, 372,000 going concerns were sold, reorganized, or otherwise acquired by new owners. A slight rise from the previous year occurred in the number of both new and discontinued businesses while the number of business transfers declined slightly. New businesses refer to firms newly established while discontinuances include all liquidations regardless of the reason for going out of business. Only about half of all discontinued businesses are liquidated in order to prevent or minimize a loss while the number of bankruptcies, or firms going out of business with known loss to creditors, represent less than 5 percent of the total. (Data on \"Commercial and Industrial Failures^ are compiled by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc.) May 1959 As has been noted above the upward trend in number of new and discontinued businesses since 1949 is largely a reflection of growth in the business population. To facilitate comparisons among industries, entry and discontinuance rates per 1,000 firms in operation are shown in table 3 and, for selected broad industry divisions, in the chart on page 17. Although the rates of growth differ, entry rates in each of the divisions charted tend to follow the same pattern year by year, as do discontinuance rates. Entry rates seem to be more responsive to changes in business conditions and, as would be expected, the conditions associated with a rise in entry rates also tend to be associated with a dip in discontinuance rates. These generalizations hold quite well not only for the major divisions charted, but also for the divisions omitted from the chart and for the industry groups as well. Although turnover rates are similar by industry in broad movements, considerable variation in the level of these rates is apparent from the chart and from the 5-year averages shown in table 3.
