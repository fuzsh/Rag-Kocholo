        "text": "Talking Screens, A Week In Chicago Film, March 1-7, 2024\n\nOpeners this week, “Dune: Part Two,” duh; Nuri Bilge Ceylan’s great, novelistic “About Dry Grasses“; and “They Shot The Piano Player.” Belgium is the focus of the Siskel’s annual European Union Film Festival. Oscar shorts continue at the Music Box. Revivals & Repertory at Doc, Drafthouse and Facets include “Dream Scenario,” “Michael Clayton” and “The Piano Teacher” in 35mm.\n\nAlso below: Chicago International sees it’s sixty and Ebertfest sets the opener of its twenty-fifth outing as passes go on sale. Plus: Governor Pritzker announces funding for local film studio infrastructure projects through the Illinois Soundstage Program.\n\nCall it “Two: A Spice Odyssey”: Denis Villeneuve’s gorgeous, brute parable of generational rage, interplanetary revenge and exploitation of masses for the production of magical fuel that extends dynastic rule, “Dune: Part Two” is freed from the garrulous exposition of the first half of the five-hour-twenty-one-minute opus to make pictures of width and depth, to mass figures across vast, sandy landscapes on one planet and on another, masses march in black-and-white, fascist finery of black and gray on palest white skin, shaming milk itself. They move amid Brutalist architecture and celebratory fireworks that blot the sky with splatters of black and white.\n\nThe most striking setting is a cavern-cum-ampitheater where hundreds worship at a space like the sacred Kaaba, the shrine located near the center of the Great Mosque in Mecca. (Unholy declaration of power surfaces.) Dialogue is minimized, but words like “propaganda,” “messiah” and “false prophet” resound rather than clatter: elemental historical conflict down to today and tomorrow in this world, not just onscreen, is sharply indicated. “Signs point to war” with “southern fundamentalist tribes,” we are told.\n\nThere are emblems and incantations, and spectacle is narrative. Gestures may be inscrutable at first sight, but hardly incomprehensible, unlike the yardage about lineage and such in “Dune.” The script is wise in turning epochal gibberish to occasional stern, stony lyric. More room could have been made for weird weirdness—the shot of a milky corpse with black ants coursing its cheek and ear, à la David Lynch’s “Blue Velvet,” is at least a smart-ass rejoinder to Villeneuve’s predecessor, who could well have penned the words, “What is left but to return your water to the well?” (“This is the water and this is the well,” to recall “Twin Peaks: The Return.”)\n\nAlso weird: the pumping of fluids from vanquished adversaries, laid on sand, to not waste a drop of precious water. It’s an auteur’s instant: Villeneuve used a similar image of fluid rushing through clear plastic tubing during the clinic abortion that opens his debut feature, “Maelström” (2000). After a pre-studio presentation credit burst of static subtitled as “Power over spice is power over all!” Christopher Walken opens the picture, ruing “Madness!” But as for quantity of acting, the great Javier Bardem remains undefeated, and for quality of curl, Timothée Chalamet is champ. Among the faces aptly captured: Florence Pugh’s still, stolid sculpture as in “Oppenheimer” and Zendaya, whose febrile reactions are often as subtle yet forceful as the rumble of approaching sandworms from many kilometers away. And: the final shot is beautiful. (Reviewed in IMAX.)\n\nREPERTORY & REVIVAL\n\nAll three categories of Oscar-nominated short films—live action, animated and documentary—continue at the Music Box, as does Wim Wenders’ “Perfect Days.” (The Oscar-nominated “Perfect Days” is also at River East, Newcity 14, Wilmette and Evanston theaters.)\n\nDrafthouse attractions include multiple evening and daytime shows of Wong Kar-wai’s “Chungking Express,” Wim Wenders’ “Perfect Days” and Friday, Tuesday and Wednesday evening showings of Tony Gilroy’s “Michael Clayton,” highlighting Tilda Swinton.\n\nDoc Films attractions include a pair of 35mm showings of Haneke’s “The Piano Teacher” (Friday, Sunday). Facets features the Nic Cage I’m-in-your-dreams freakout, “Dream Scenario,” Friday-Sunday. “Shot with a subdued 16mm palette, with concise, sometimes elegant editing, ‘Dream Scenario’ offers lovely images, some of simmering alarm, and some as serenely surreal as can be: figures float to the sky in the opening scene, and a set of keys—keys!—fall from the sky into a leaf-strewn pool.” (Our review here.)\n\nCHICAGO SEEN\n\nCelebrating sixty years in 2024, the Chicago International Film Festival is accepting entries for feature-length, documentary, and short films. (The anniversary logo was released, too.) Last year, the festival screened 161 short and feature-length films from fifty-three countries. CIFF is an Academy Award-qualifying festival for the winners of their Short Film Competitions. Festival selection “Nai Nai & Wài Pó” by Sean Wang was nominated for Best Documentary Short Oscar. Submission deadlines are early bird, April 8; regular deadline, June 10; and late deadline, July 1. Guidelines here.\n\nEbertFest celebrates a quarter-century: Roger Ebert’s Film Festival will run April 17-20, at the Virginia Theatre in downtown Champaign, opening with Bob Fosse’s controversial “Star 80” with Eric Roberts and Mariel Hemingway in attendance. Individual festival passes to see all films cost $200, which includes reserved seating. New this year are four-film passes for $70: choose between an Evening Pass or a Saturday Pass. Ebertfest passes are available here."
