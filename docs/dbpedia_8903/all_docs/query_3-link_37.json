A man working in an underground laboratory learns to speak with ants using a pheromone translator. The ants tell him the story of Princess Ant 56 and her battle to found an ant empire. The book, the first in Werber’s was a global best-seller. Weber’s books have sold more than 18 million copies worldwide. Writer Kim Se Jung, whose credits include the Vanguard Animation title Everyone Knows What a Dragon Looks LIke, will adopt the novel for the screen."
