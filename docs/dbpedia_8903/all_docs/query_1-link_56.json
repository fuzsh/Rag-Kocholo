After 3\n\nferocious minutes of ‘Dog Eat Dog’, on the weekly music show, Top of the Pops, the\n\nphenomenon rapidly began, and they would go on to dominate the charts with\n\nextraordinary success.\n\nIn May 1981, ‘Stand and Deliver’ hit the number 1 spot and stayed there for 5 weeks, and\n\nbecame his most successful single, winning him the prestigious Ivor Novello Award For\n\nSongwriting. On it’s release, the follow up album and single ‘Prince Charming’ went\n\nstraight to number one and a further 12 singles went top 30, at one point, Adam had 8\n\nsingles in the top 40. . . in one week!"
