        "text": "Aside from following the latest CDC guidelines, there's really no right or wrong way to self-quarantine. People across the world have been implementing creative tactics to help stay entertained and keep from going too stir crazy while isolating and social distancing.\n\nSome have chosen to pass the time by taking “virtual vacations” and tuning into beach webcams or digitally exploring their favorite museums (like this 3D tour offered by House of Refuge Museum here in Martin County). Others are looking to their local libraries and taking advantage of online resources and databases, like tracing their genealogy; downloading eBooks and audiobooks; or brushing up on their foreign language skills with the help of programs like Rosetta Stone. But many of us are turning to streaming services and binge-watching our favorite movies.\n\nFrom old fashioned classics to the latest blockbuster releases, movies never fail to provide an entertaining escape. So to help you figure out what flick to watch next, we've pulled together a list of various movies that were filmed in right here in Martin County or feature actors and creators from our area.

Now grab some popcorn and prepare for a Martin County-themed movie marathon!\n\nA scene from the 1916 movie “Robinson Crusoe” shot in Stuart.\n\nRobinson Crusoe (1916)\n\nYearning for a sense of nostalgia? Then consider streaming this black and white silent film from 1916! Based on the revered novel written by Daniel Defoe, the plot follows a man's struggle to survive after being shipwrecked on a deserted island. To bring the setting to life, the 75-person film crew came down to Stuart to shoot the full-length feature movie. Stuart was selected as an ideal candidate, thanks to the beautiful inlet, favorable climate, tropical vegetation, and excellent lighting conditions. Read more about the production in this article from the TCPalm archives.\n\nYankee Doodle Dandy (1942)\n\nFrances Langford is undoubtedly one of Martin County's most famous former residents. Born in 1913, she rose to fame during the Golden Age of Radio. She eventually brought her vocal talents to the silver screen, appearing in 28 films during her illustrious career. Many consider her appearance in Yankee Doodle Dandy (focused on the life of the renowned musical composer, playwright, actor, dancer, and singer George M. Cohan) to be her break out role. Although she passed away in Jensen Beach in 2005, her legacy lives on as one of Martin County's most philanthropic residents, with many attractions dedicated in her honor.\n\nClint Howard as “Mark Wedloe” with Bruno the Bear as “Ben” in 1967\n\nGentle Giant (1967)\n\nAnother throwback, Gentle Giant was released in 1967 and based on Walt Morey's beloved novel “Gentle Ben.” The story follows a young boy who befriends an orphaned brown bear (named Ben) and raises him as his cub. While the original book is set in a small fishing town in Alaska, the movie was adapted to a take place in the Florida Everglades. They also changed Ben from a brown bear (a species not native to Florida) to a large American black bear (commonly found in Florida). To recreate the fishing village vibe, the crew shot key scenes in Port Salerno, Martin County's very own historic fishing village.\n\nEmpire of the Ants (1977)\n\nIf science fiction is more your style, then you won't want to miss Empire of the Ants. This kitschy, outlandish flick was loosely based on H.G. Wells' short story of the same name. The movie stars iconic actress Joan Collins who plays Marilyn Fryser, a shady scam artist trying to sell phony real estate deals in South Florida to unsuspecting buyers. The catch? The land is being overtaken by giant mutant ants. Keep your eyes peeled you'll be able to spot local destinations featured including Jensen Beach and Sailfish Point.\n\nHogsqueal (left, with the voice of Seth Rogen) helps Jared Grace (Freddie Highmore) spy on wicked creatures trying to get their hands on a rare book in “The Spiderwick Chronicles.”\n\nThe Spiderwick Chronicles (2008)"
