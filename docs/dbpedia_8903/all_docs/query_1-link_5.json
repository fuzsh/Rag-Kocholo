        "text": "BERT I. GORDON seems to be fascinated by the Animal Kingdom. Last year he conjured up a menagerie of mammoth voracious rats, chickens and bees for \"Food of the Gods,\" a film inspired by an H. G. Wells story. Now Mr. Gordon has come up with a man-hungry colony of giant insects in \"Empire of the Ants,\" also derived from a work by H. G. Wells. The movie swarmed into local theaters yesterday; unfortunately, the insects and the people in this m√©lange of ersatz science-fiction and dull adventure deserve one another.There are some \"15,000 different species of ants,\" an off-screen narrator tells us, whose industry and intelligence are astounding. But these king-sized insects don't appear to get much competition, intellectual or otherwise, from the covey of humans who figure in this picture. The humans are a group of prospeceive buyers conned to undeveloped acres apparently in the vicinity of the Everglades, where some of the film was shot.In any case, salesmanship soon gives way to special effects as the ants, keening and racketing like helicopters, start stalking and decimating the group as the humans try to escape via a river and the swampy, jungle-like terrain. If credulity isn't strained at this point, it certainly is when the humans finally make it to a village and sugar refinery controlled by, you guessed it, sugar-loving ants.As a laconic charter boat skipper, Robert Lansing seems to be more level-headed than the rest as he leads this largely ill-fated party out of a frightening mess. But the human's fright is seen as play acting, and the account of their progress over a gory trail is slow and repetitive. And, aside from some multifaceted ant's-eye views of humans, the special effects are artificial and unexciting.This \"Empire of the Ants,\" as Albert Salmi, in the small role of the village sheriff, puts it, is \"hard to believe.\"This film is rated PG (\"Parental Guidance Suggested\") probably for its occasional bloody scenes and its ant attacks, but these simulated terrors are not likely to shock viewers past the age of, say, 10.\n\nIt's No PicnicEMPIRE OF THE ANTS; produced, directed and story by Bert I. Gordon; screenplay by Jack Turley; based on a story by H. G. Wells; photography directed by Reg Morris; edited by Michael Luciano; special effects by Roy Downey; a Cinema 77 Film released by American International Pictures. At local theaters.
