The timeline suggested here embraces the inconsistencies to avoid assumptions.\n\n13th Hunter Chairman Election arc[]\n\nKillua's travel time is inconsistent: according to the timeline, it took him several more days to reach his home than to do the return journey, despite Illumi's interference. Even if the Zodiacs' meeting was retconned to have taken place on the day of the Selection and the day right before the election, and Ging's meeting with Beans in Chapter 320 two days before then, the travel time of Cluck's pigeons and of the voters or the Zodiacs going off-site would remain inconsistent (excluding Nen abilities). Furthermore, despite the first round of the election supposedly lasting 24 hours, the events of Chapter 329 and Chapter 330 clarify that the rounds could not have lasted more than a few hours each. A possible solution to the contradiction would be that the requirement of strict punctuality mentioned in Chapter 320 implied that the polls would close as soon as the Hunters present all voted, without waiting until 23:59.\n\nThe alternative timeline that renders Killua's travel time consistent (the one indicated by \"possibly\") would posit the Zodiac meeting as well as the Selection Day to have taken place on August 7th, 2000, and Ging to have visited the Hunter Association's headquarters on August 5th, the Zodiacs having been sent a preview of Netero's last will days before the other Hunters.\n\nPossibly August 5th, 2000[]\n\nGing meets with Beans at the Hunter Association's Headquarters[283] in Swardani City.[282]\n\nPossibly August 7th, 2000[]\n\nTwo days later:[283] the Zodiacs meet to decide the format of the upcoming election.[56]\n\nAugust 8th and 9th, 2000[]\n\nAt midnight: the first round of the 13th Hunter Chairman Election begins.[283]\n\nIllumi enlists Hisoka's help to kill Alluka.[283]\n\nKillua arrives home and talks to Silva.[284]\n\nThe results of the first round are announced. The second round begins and ends. The results are announced.[284]\n\nThe Zodiacs take provisions against invalid votes. The third round begins.[284]\n\nIllumi tells Hisoka about Nanika's powers.[285]\n\nKillua is allowed to meet with Alluka.[286][285]\n\nThe results of the third round are announced. The Zodiacs agree to make a speech before the gathered Hunters to address abstentions.[285]\n\nAfter sunrise: Nanika kisses Killua on the cheek after leaving Kukuroo Mountain.[287]\n\nKillua and Alluka, escorted by Canary, Gotoh, and Amane, leave the Zoldyck mansion by car.[288]\n\nLeorio punches Ging during the Zodiacs' speech. The fourth round begins and ends. The results are announced[288] and the fifth round begins.[289]\n\nIllumi opens hostilities with Killua.[289]\n\nHisoka kills Gotoh.[290]\n\nKillua runs away from Tsubone, Amane, and Canary.[282]\n\nTsubone, Amane, and Canary reach Parasta's airport.[282]\n\nLess than 10 minutes after escaping the three butlers: Killua reaches Parasta's airport.[282]\n\nKillua, Canary, and Amane arrange for eight blimps to fly towards Swardani City.[282]\n\nRoughly 10 minutes after Killua reaches Parasta's airport: Illumi and Hisoka reach Parasta's airport.[282]\n\nThrough Morel, Killua enlists Teradein Neutral, Bushidora Ambitious, and Loupe Highland's help in opposing Illumi and his Needle People.[282]\n\nThe results of the fifth round are announced, the sixth round begins.[291]\n\nAfter sunset: Hisoka and Illumi make short work of Points C and A.[291]\n\nTsubone transforms into a glider. She and her granddaughter follow Killua's blimp.[291]\n\nThe results of the sixth round are announced, the seventh round begins.[291]\n\nHisoka kills Bushidora.[291]\n\nIllumi confronts Killua.[291][292]\n\nHisoka kills Teradein.[292]\n\nAfter sunrise: the results of the seventh round are announced.[292] The Hunters gather at HQ.[280]\n\nKillua arrives at Gon's hospital.[280]\n\nThe four candidates speak.[293][294]\n\nThe eighth round begins.[294]\n\nNanika restores Gon.[294]\n\nGon arrives at the Hunter Association's HQ[295] and speaks with Ging.[296]\n\nThe ninth round begins and ends. Pariston is elected 13th Chairman of the Hunter Association and resigns shortly after.[296]\n\nKillua and Illumi have a showdown at the hospital. Killua's restrictions are lifted.[296][297]\n\nGon speaks to Kite.[298]\n\nGon and Killua part ways.[32]\n\nGon talks to Ging atop the World Tree.[32][299]\n\nDark Continent Expedition arc[]\n\nThe Zodiac meeting with Cheadle Yorkshire as Chairman in Chapter 340 seems to take place right after the day of the election, as the Zodiacs forgot that Pariston was no longer Vice Chairman and Cheadle had yet to choose hers. This would mean that the expedition to the Dark Continent announced by Nasubi Hui Guo Rou also took place on the day after the end of the election, possibly explaining why, contrary to Ging's predictions in Chapter 331, Pariston did not delay the end of the election. Another implication is that Steiner, the IPA's Deputy Secretary, was tasked with studying Journey to the New World one month before then, which would require the V5 to have been aware of Kakin's project for at least that amount of time before it was announced. However, they did not seem to know about Beyond Netero's involvement, as supported by the timing of the request to the Hunter Association.\n\nFrom this it can already be inferred that events occurring in one same chapter are not necessarily synchronous, another example being Leorio and Kurapika's invitation to join the Zodiacs. Mizaistom Nana visited Beyond 35 days before the Black Whale's departure, scheduled for August 8th Mizaistom's conversation with Kurapika about moles then ought to have taken place right after the 289th Hunter Exam, whose schedule is known to have been modified to gather the necessary resources for the voyage.
