And when it comes to monster movies, I really feel a twinge of ‘if only’ regret when I see preproduction concept artwork, test footage or maquette models that show beasts that might have featured in these productions but failed to find their way onto the silver screen.\n\nHere’s a whole menagerie of marvellous monsters that didn’t make it into a movie…\n\nTHE CURSE OF THE SPONGEMAN\n\nTHE CURSE OF THE SPONGEMAN would have been a full length film about a humanoid creature named Spongeman. The creature’s origin would’ve occurred during the hurricanes of the 1920s, when the wind and currents stirred up local spongebeds and formed an elusive being that has been mysteriously living in the waters off the Florida Keys ever since.\n\nQuincy Perkins, a director of a bunch of short films like THE TRACKS (and who was a location assistant on THE CURIOUS CASE OF BENJAMIN BUTTON), had dreamt of making a Spongeman movie since he was a child, when he grew up in Key West and was obsessed with the old Spongeman statue in the centre of town. This original Spongeman figure was created by an artist in the 1920s as a monument to the sponge fishermen of Key West.\n\nThe idea of this magical sponge creature captured Quincy’s imagination and, many years later, he eventually shot an 8-minute film – then he decided to expand the project into a feature length movie. Quincy wanted to make a film that was true to the spirit of the creature feature films of the 1950s, but was consciously adapted to the present day, creating a modern fairy tale of sorts.\n\nQuincy tried to raise funds via a Kickstarter campaign, promising a movie that would’ve starred Herschell Gordon Lewis, Oscar Torre, Tom Frank and Jessica Miano Kruel. Quincy hoped to raise £15,466 to make this small, independent film, but only £4,625 was pledged and the project was canceled in 2015. This is a shame, because I would’ve loved to see the Spongeman stomping around the Florida Keys!\n\nVincenzo Natali’s IT\n\nHere are some Pennywise designs from director Vincenzo (SPLICE) Natali’s pitch for a version of Stephen King’s IT.\n\nThe drawings of Pennywise below are by concept artist Amro Attia…\n\nThese drawings are by Vincenzo Natali himself…\n\nAs this article is all about unmade films, you won’t be too surprised to find out that Vincenzo Natali’s IT movie failed to get produced.\n\nClive Barker’s THE MUMMY\n\nBack in the 1980s Universal was planning to use its Mummy monster character to relaunch its horror franchise. Universal hired George A. Romero initially, and he was attached to write and direct the revival of the 1932 Universal monster movie, but he was limited to a budget of $10 million. The project just seemed to lose momentum, Romero left, and then Clive (HELLRAISER) Barker came onboard.\n\nBarker, along with Mick Garris (who wrote several drafts of the script), pitched their Mummy movie idea to Universal in 1989, and it would’ve included the Mummy becoming a transgender character: starting off as a little boy, the character would become an ‘exquisite woman’. Barker was also going to make his Mummy flick more sexual and dark, focusing on the owner of a museum, who is attempting to revive the mummies.\n\nSpecial effects expert Steve Johnson offered to help Barker create a visual proof-of-concept for his Mummy idea, to be shown to the Universal producers. Johnson financed the production of concept drawings and models entirely out of his own pocket, to help Barker sell the project to Universal, but Barker’s pitch was rejected outright by the studio, and THE MUMMY (1999), directed by Stephen Sommers, was eventually made instead.\n\nNeill Blomkamp’s ALIEN 5\n\nThis film project from Blomkamp was set to be another ALIEN sequel and it was going to explore the Xenomorph genome. The plot would’ve involved experiments being performed on captive Aliens. All types of genetically-altered Xenomorphs would have been created by meddling Weyland-Yutani scientists!\n\nSee below for lots of concept art visuals produced for this unmade ALIEN sequel…\n\nHere’s a sculpture of the four-armed genetically modified Xenomorph that would have featured in Neill Blomkamp’s ALIEN 5…\n\nVincenzo Natali’s PREDATORS\n\nVincenzo Natali, the writer and director of sci-fi horror films SPLICE (2009) and CUBE (1997), did a pitch at 20th Century Fox for PREDATORS. This was some time before Robert Rodriguez produced his own version of PREDATORS (2010), which, of course, starred Adrien Brody, Topher Grace and Laurence Fishburne.\n\nVincenzo Natali said that, at the time of his pitch, there was no script, just a logline, so he was free to do whatever he wanted. Natali himself produced some storyboards for the pitch, and he also had concept art created by Dan Milligan and Amro Attia.\n\nNatali’s version of PREDATORS did not go into production, but, by the look of Amro Attia’s concept drawing, it seems that if the film had been made… the Predators would have looked sleek, metallic and angular!\n\nTHE TOURIST\n\nScreenwriter Clair Noto’s THE TOURIST, which she wrote for Universal studio executive Sean Daniels, was a hot script back in the early 80s, focusing on a group of exiled aliens living among us humans. The plot included the Manhattan Grief Clinic, which was actually a front for the extraterrestrials’ hideaway, otherwise known as the Corridor: here various aliens lurked in cubicles, living out their useless lives.\n\nProducer Renee Missell and director Brian Gibson became attached, and soon Clair Noto was booted from the project, which became a bigger and bigger mess, until it faltered and Universal pulled the plug. After that Noto took her script to United Artists and then to Francis Ford Coppola’s Zoetrope Studio. But events always went against her, and although Dino DeLaurentis and other folks tried to get THE TOURIST produced, it never ultimately got made, even after the script found its way back to Universal.\n\nWhat is interesting is that H.R. Giger was brought onto the project for a while, and he conceptualised lots of very evocative, memorable alien designs for the Corridor sequences.\n\nTHE NATURAL HISTORY PROJECT\n\nThis unmade dinosaur-focused feature film was conceived by Jim Henson in the mid-80s and would have featured special effects by the Jim Henson Creature Shop.\n\nThe super-talented William Stout wrote the screenplay (he actually wrote two versions of the script, one with a narration and one with no voice-overs whatsoever: a totally visual telling of the story). This serious muppet dino movie, which was given the generic title THE NATURAL HISTORY PROJECT so that (hopefully) nobody would make a similar film, was to be directed by Henson.\n\nWarner Brothers committed to a budget of 25 million dollars for production, plus 5 million dollars for character research and development. Stout began designing the characters and painting key scenes from his script. However… the project was scrapped when Warners discovered that George Lucas and Steven Spielberg were making a similar project called THE LAND BEFORE TIME.\n\nAll I can say is that the cancellation of this Henson project was a damn, damn shame!\n\nBABY KONG\n\nThis is an ad for the Mario Bava project BABY KONG, which was announced in 1976 but was never made…\n\nThis film was obviously planned as a cash-in to ride on the coattails of the ’76 version of KING KONG. Did this movie have any chance of being any good? Who knows, but it was going to be directed by the great Mario Bava, so I, for one, would definitely have watched it! Maybe it would’ve been chimp-tastic!\n\nDRACULA – character designs by Frank Frazetta\n\nDominic Orsatti, president of Orsatti Productions Inc., announced in April 1976 that he would begin production on a feature‐length animated version of DRACULA.\n\nAn original screenplay, supposedly based very closely on the original Bram Stoker novel, was written by George Greer.\n\nThe film, which was budgeted at around $3 million, was going to base the look of the characters on designs by illustrator supreme Frank Frazetta.\n\nOrsatti was going to serve as executive producer on the production, with Emil Carle producing the film and acting as technical director. Andrew Chiaramonte and George Greer were slated to be the joint directors of animation. Damn it! Why wasn’t this film made?!!\n\nFrazetta heard that the film got postponed almost immediately after he started work on it, so he didn’t send any of his art off, which is why it is still around for us to look at…\n\nILSA MEETS BRUCE LEE IN THE DEVIL’S TRIANGLE\n\nYes, somebody planned to have Dyanne Thorne’s infamous antiheroine Ilsa meet up with Bruce Lee!\n\nIn a 2011 interview Thorne confirmed that the project was actually discussed, but a script wasn’t written. Thorne was told to study martial arts, which she did, and she got herself into good physical shape. Thorne said that money was going to be raised for it, but, shortly after, Bruce Lee died. So the filmmakers were then going to use top Bruceploitation actor Bruce Li. There was a conflict in their schedules, unfortunately, and the script was still not ready, so the project faded away. The Washington Post did publish a full page article with pictures publicising the possibility of the film, making the unmade flick look pretty legitimate.\n\nNow, there’s no way that Bruce Lee, had he lived, would’ve chosen to make this movie. But I definitely think a movie starring Dyanne Thorne and Bruce Li could’ve been produced and it would have been great, exploitative fun. But it didn’t happen, though a promotional ad was created… and it featured Ilsa, Bruce Lee, a shark and what looks like a gill-man or a zombie! Wow!\n\nDOCTOR WHO’S GREATEST ADVENTURE\n\nDuring a special event held at London’s British Film Institute (where the two 1960s Peter Cushing Doctor Who films were screened), there was a Q&A session. One of the people on stage was Sergei Subotsky, the son of Milton Subotsky, who was the original Doctor Who movie screenwriter. Sergei revealed that, in the 1970s, his dad Milton wrote a script for a third Doctor Who movie… DR. WHO’S GREATEST ADVENTURE.\n\nNow, this 3rd cinematic outing for the Doctor was not going to feature the Daleks again as the antagonists. Oh no, forget your usual Doctor Who foes… instead… the plot would have involved giant crabs!!!\n\nAccording to Sergie, the screenplay for this planned 70s movie was actually a redrafting of a script that already existed. What happened was that Milton inserted Doctor Who into the existing script… and the original script was called KING CRAB. And, before it was called that, the script was titled NIGHT OF THE CRABS. Yes, you read that correctly! It seems that the original script was an adaptation of Guy N Smith’s creature-horror novel ‘Night of the Crabs’!!! And now Doctor Who was part of the tale, battling the killer crustaceans!\n\nThere’s no way that DR. WHO’S GREATEST ADVENTURE would have featured the kind of gory, visceral killings depicted in Guy N Smith’s original novel, but, hell, I would’ve loved to have seen the Doctor take on these pincered monsters with his sonic screwdriver! The film, of course, never got made, but the script was written. No concept drawings were produced, unfortunately, but here’s a faux poster that was created by Andydrewz (Andrew-Mark Thompson) for an article on this unmade film that was published in the Telegraph newspaper…\n\nAXA\n\nIn the early 80s Steven Archer, the stop-motion animator who worked on CLASH OF THE TITANS and KRULL, did a couple of concept drawings to show Milton Subotsky, the producer who was thinking of making a movie based on a UK newspaper fantasy-sci-fi comic strip called AXA.\n\nSteve kept in contact with Subotsky, who had a script for AXA, but it never got made.\n\nGODZILLA VS GHOST GODZILLA\n\nYes, you read that title right! This film would have seen a 90s-era Godzilla facing off against the spirit of the original 50s Godzilla!\n\nAlso known as GODZILLA VS GODZILLA, Toho toyed with variations on a story that would’ve had the modern Godzilla threatened by an incarnation of the first Big G.\n\nOne idea had Godzilla Junior going back to 1954 to fight against the original Godzilla, then later story versions dealt with the conflict between Godzilla and the restless spirit of the first Godzilla, set in the present.\n\nConcept art for the Ghost Godzilla character was created by Shinji Nishikawa. Conceptual art was also produced that showed a newer version of the kaiju Anguirus. The whole ‘spirit Godzilla’ idea was eventually dropped and, after several other unmade concepts were considered, GODZILLA VS DESTOROYAH was made instead, in 1995.\n\n(The concept of the ‘soul’ of the original Godzilla being reawakened was finally used in GODZILLA AGAINST MECHAGODZILLA in 2002)\n\nRob Zombie’s THE BLOB\n\nRob (THE DEVIL’S REJECTS) Zombie planned to direct a new version of THE BLOB. The abandoned project would have starred Rob’s wife Sheri Moon Zombie (surprise!)\n\nAs you can see from the concept art drawn by the talented Alex Horley, Rob’s take on the plot moved away from the idea of just one large, gelatinous blob and focused on swarms of victims becoming purple blobby-zombies…\n\nTHE GOLEM\n\nProducers at Cannon in the 1980s took out an advertisement in Variety announcing pre-production on a movie called THE GOLEM… which would have seen the supernatural clay being coming up against… Charles Bronson!!!\n\nUnfortunately, the proposed budget was high compared to the company’s usual output, so the film was put on hold until finances improved, but box office flops like MASTERS OF THE UNIVERSE and LIFEFORCE left the company rather skint, and so the film was never made. What a shame!\n\nWAR EAGLES\n\nBoy, this is definitely a movie I wish had got produced!\n\nWillis O’Brien’s unmade project involved a hidden world of dinosaurs and members of a lost Viking tribe that ride giant eagles! The finale would have seen these raptor-riders fighting Nazi zeppelins over New York City! Just let that description sink in: Vikings on giant prehistoric eagles fighting Nazi airships over modern day Manhatten!!!\n\nKING KONG producer Merian C. Cooper planned this as an epic Technicolor production in the late 1930s. Storyboards and illustrations were produced, as were multiple versions of the script, including a final draft written by Cyril (FORBIDDEN PLANET) Hume. Detailed models and sets were built and Technicolor test footage featuring stop-motion animation by O’Brien and Marcel Delgado was shot… but the harsh reality of an impending world war put a stop to the production in 1940. Jeez, I would’ve loved to have seen this flick!\n\nHere’s some exquisite WAR EAGLES art…\n\nB&W test footage stills…\n\nTechnicolor frames from the animation test footage…\n\nHere’s the cover for a novel, published in 2008, that was based on the WAR EAGLES screenplay…\n\nFinally, here’s the cover of the book ‘WAR EAGLES – The Unmaking of an Epic – An Alternate History for Classic Film Monsters’, written by David Conover and Philip J. Riley, which takes an in-depth look at this unmade fantasy epic…\n\nJan de Bont’s GODZILLA\n\nIn November, 1993, Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio, successful scriptwriters responsible for the likes of THE MASK OF ZORRO and PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN, submitted the first draft of their GODZILLA screenplay to TriStar. In their story Godzilla would be pitted against a monster known as the Gryphon: a huge beast with the body of a cougar, the wings of a bat and a tongue of snakes. There were also creatures called Probe Bats in the plot. Interestingly, Elliott & Rossio had originally wanted to feature King Ghidorah in their screenplay, but Toho’s three-headed space dragon was, at that time, off-limits.\n\n(Later, after various drafts, Elliott & Rossio’s script would be rewritten by Don Macpherson)\n\nDirectors who were considered for this Godzilla project included Tim Burton, Joe Dante and Joe Johnston. Eventually Jan De Bont became attached. De Bont, the director of SPEED, was a big Toho fan, so he certainly was a good fit.\n\nJan De Bont saw GODZILLA as a world famous movie monster icon primed for an update with modern Hollywood special effects technology. But there were movie executives who saw Big G as a campy, overly-kitschy character that would not appeal to an international audience without a complete overhaul. This attitude was what eventually forced De Bont off the project. De Bont also said that the studio just wanted the film to be made cheaper and faster. De Bont signed on for the disaster flick TWISTER instead, which became a big financial hit.\n\nRoland Emmerich and Dean Devlin then came on board the GODZILLA project, but they were only willing to take on the film if they were allowed to completely reinvent Godzilla into something wholly their own, including a design for the great reptile that included a distinctive underbite and a lither physique. They also did not want any other giant monsters in the story for Godzilla to fight. And so this was how the divisive 1998 GODZILLA came into being.\n\nAnyway, back to the De Bont version: lots of concept art, storyboards, sculpts, etc, were produced before this iteration of the GODZILLA project withered and died.\n\nThese are shots of the (unfinished) maquette of Godzilla designed by Stan Winston Studio, under the direction of Jan De Bont…\n\nHere’s a pic of a finished Godzilla maquette…\n\nStoryboard panels by David Russell…\n\nSome Big G concept art…\n\nTalented artist Carlos Huante’s concepts for the Gryphon…\n\nSome Mark ‘Crash’ McCreery concept art for the Gryphon…\n\nStan Winston Studio’s large Gryphon maquette…\n\nDesigns for the Probe Bats by Carlos Huante…\n\nYet more marvellous Probe Bat concept work, this time by Bruce Fuller…\n\nHere’s an industry trade ad announcing TriStar`s GODZILLA for 1994…\n\nLastly, here’s a close-up of the Godzilla maquette’s well-detailed face…\n\nTHE LEGEND OF KING KONG\n\nIn 1975 Universal approached RKO Pictures and offered them $200,000 (plus five percent of the film’s net profits) for the rights to make a new King Kong movie. There was no written contract, but Universal was confident that they received verbal approval from RKO, but… they would soon learn that RKO had actually signed a deal with Dino De Laurentiis and Paramount Pictures to produce a remake of the film. Universal hired Joseph Sargent to direct their film and Jim Danforth offered to produce the effects for the film using stop-motion animation. Eventually, however, a federal judge ruled that Paramount did have the rights to produce a KING KONG remake, and that RKO had exclusive rights to the 1933 film, which forced Universal to drop its plans for THE LEGEND OF KING KONG. It got shelved forever. Such a shame!\n\nAlong with the titular great ape, the film would have featured an Arsinoitherium, a Baluchitherium, a centipede creature, a giant amphibian, a huge vulture, a Parasaurolophus, a reptilian eel, a fictional dinosaur called a Triclonius and pit scorpions.\n\nHere are some of Jim Danforth’s preproduction concepts…\n\nDINO-RIDERS\n\nThe (now-defunct) animation company Vanguard Animation boasted an interesting slate of upcoming projects before the outfit folded. John Stevenson (co-director of KUNG FU PANDA) was attached to either produce and/or direct six of these projects… and one of them was… DINO-RIDERS.\n\nThis animated movie would have been based on the Mattel/Tyco toy property from the late 80s. The story focused on the Valorians, a future race of humans who are at war with the humanoid-frog-ish Rulons. To escape the assault on their home, the Valorians use a Space Time Energy Projector machine, but this zaps them (and the pursuing Rulons) all the way back to prehistoric Earth during the age of the dinosaurs. The heroic Valorians find that they are able to telepathically communicate with the dinosaurs, which means they befriend the great reptiles and start riding them! But Vanguard Animation folded before this fine-sounding animation flick could be made, their collapse aided, no doubt, by the poor reception Vanguard received for the films they had just released (such as HAPPILY N’EVER AFTER). Oh well.\n\nHere are some of the (pretty awesome) concept artworks for the animation project…\n\nSUPERMAN LIVES\n\nOn paper this Superman movie project looked kinda promising: it had a light, fun, action-packed script written by comic book fan-boy Kevin Smith, it was going to be directed by Tim Burton and it was set to star the Oscar-winning Nicolas Cage as Supes. But it all started to go wrong…\n\nFirst Burton removed Kevin Smith from the project. There was not much in Smith’s script that could be described as typically ‘Burtonesque’ and it didn’t really contain the themes that the director wanted to address, like Superman’s outsider angst, etc, so Burton brought in Wesley Strick to write a new draft. Dan Gilroy also did another draft of the script. And yet more drafts were to follow. Expensive preproduction progressed but, in late 1997, Warner Bros decided to cancel the film, partly because BATMAN AND ROBIN had become a commercial and critical disaster, which made the studio very, very nervous about SUPERMAN LIVES. Warners Bros had had several flops in the mid-90s and they just couldn’t afford to take such a big risk. Burton made his SLEEPY HOLLOW project instead.\n\nSUPERMAN LIVES would certainly have been a quirky big budget movie if it’d got produced, with some strange creatures and character-designs added to the mix.\n\nHere are some colour concept drawings, by Jacques Rey, that he created for Tim Burton’s unmade superhero film…\n\nTwo creature studies by Jacques Rey…\n\nAnd here are concepts for the villain Doomsday…\n\nSome more concept art for SUPERMAN LIVES…\n\nJohn Carpenter’s CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON\n\nJohn Carpenter was approached to remake CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON in 1992, with Rick Baker creating designs for the new look of the Creature. In the script for this project, which I read many years ago, the Creature dwelt in a submerged pyramid-temple and could transform itself so that it could resemble a human. I presume this idea was included to provide the FX crew with an excuse to do some prosthetic transformation scenes, but, for me, it was a concept that I didn’t really like.\n\nAnyway, this project, which was going to be pretty violent and gory, was cancelled due to the failure of Carpenter’s MEMOIRS OF AN INVISIBLE MAN at the box office the same year.\n\nNIGHT SKIES\n\nThis unmade movie would have been produced by Steven Spielberg, written by John Sayles and directed by Ron Cobb. The project was shelved and eventually evolved into E.T.\n\nHere are some of Ron Cobb’s alien concept drawings…\n\nJohn Carpenter’s DARKCHYLDE\n\nWriter/artist Randy Queen, the creator of ‘Darkchylde’, a comic book which focused on Ariel Chylde, a heroine who could transform into the creatures of her nightmares, teamed-up with Weta Workshop to produce some digital test footage of Ariel transforming into her winged, demonic side and fighting a monster. John Carpenter then came onboard to help bring the nightmarish tale to the silver screen. At one point a producer mentioned that Chloë Grace Moretz, Elizabeth Olson and Elle Fanning were ‘being thought of,’ though there was never any indication that any of the actresses had actually been approached regarding this project. Finally, as is often the way, DARKCHYLDE simply stalled and died.\n\nShots from the DARKCHYLDE test footage…\n\nHOSTS\n\nA sci-fi-horror script called HOSTS was written back in the 90s and, for a short time, an executive from a film company was interested in the development of the project. Concept designs were created for the aliens, which were referred to as Swarmers: these eel-like critters could group together with a central Queen body to become a Colony Creature.\n\nBrett Piper (director, FX man & stop-motion animator of A NYMPHOID BARBARIAN IN DINOSAUR HELL, TRICLOPS, QUEEN CRAB and many other films) built a posable model of a Swarmer, to help sell-in the project.\n\nIn the end, HOSTS never happened, but these drawings and photos of Brett’s model creature are worth checking out…\n\nMOTHRA VS. BAGAN\n\nThis 1990 Toho movie concept would have seen Mothra appearing on-screen for the first time since DESTROY ALL MONSTERS. The plot involved a monster called Bagan for Mothra to battle.\n\nHowever, due to the poor box office performance of GODZILLA VS. BIOLLANTE, the film was cancelled. The great moth would eventually return in 1992’s GODZILLA VS. MOTHRA.\n\nLOST PATROL\n\nThis is the uber-talented Charlie Chiodo’s concept illustration for an unmade lost world movie called LOST PATROL, which the Chiodo brothers were hoping to make…\n\nWAR OF THE WORLDS\n\nStop-motion king Ray Harryhausen produced evocative B&W concept drawings and made a 16mm test reel in order to sell-in his version of H.G. Wells’ alien invasion story THE WAR OF THE WORLDS , which would have boasted stop-motion tentacled extraterrestrials and Martian tripods.\n\nHarryhausen took his project all around Hollywood, but, back in the 1940s, nobody was interested.\n\nHere’s a bunch of his fine drawings…\n\nHere is Ray Harryhausen’s stop-motion Martian puppet, as seen in his 16mm test reel…\n\nArtist Graham Humphreys painted this wonderful illustration to accompany the book ‘Harryhausen: The Lost Movies’, published by Titan Books…\n\nGRANDMA LUCY\n\nKen Barthelmey created some concept designs for this unproduced film project in early 2011. It was planned to be a post-apocalyptic horror movie featuring an old creepy female creature as the main antagonist…\n\nNESSIE\n\nHammer Films planned to collaborate with Toho to make a giant creature feature about the Loch Ness Monster! Yay! But it didn’t get made. Boo!\n\nConcept drawings were done and ads were released, claiming the movie would be ready for world release in 1977. That, obviously, never came to pass (sob).\n\nHere’s concept artwork of Nessie…\n\nHere’s a two-page advertisement that Hammer put out…\n\nThis is a commissioned piece from artist Lenny Romero, showing Nessie wrecking Gibraltar…\n\nThis is another Greg Noneman commission, titled ‘Terror at Tower Bridge’, which was created by Matt Frank for the G-Fest panel ‘Nessie: The Kaiju that Hammer Loched Away’. This illustration was inspired by a piece of concept art from the unmade Toho/Hammer Nessie film…\n\nGuillermo del Toro’s CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON\n\nGuillermo del Toro, who was a huge fan of the original version of CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON, planned a remake. A conceptual Creature maquette was designed by Mark ‘Crash’ McCreery and sculpted & painted by David Grasso, for Mike Elizalde’s creature effects studio Spectral Motion.\n\nGuillermo del Toro’s vision involved the story being seen from the Creature’s point of view, and the film would have ended with the gill-man and his human love interest getting together. Universal, however, was not open to these ideas and the film was eventually scrapped. Guillermo, of course, would go on to make his own distinctive gill-man tale, THE SHAPE OF WATER (2017), which became an Oscar-winner.\n\nWHEN THE EARTH CRACKED OPEN\n\nThis is another unmade Hammer film! It would have been a Ray Harryhausen/Hammer Films collaboration, akin to ONE MILLION YEARS BC.\n\nHarryhausen created some concept art featuring dinosaur-type reptilian beasts emerging from the ground. The movie would have contained swamp creatures, giant stag beetles, a giant armadillo and giant soldier ants.\n\nRegular Hammer poster artist Tom Chantrell did some promotional artwork for this project, which remained a rather unfocused affair, resulting in some imagery looking futuristic whilst other images looked prehistoric…\n\nGODZILLA – KING OF THE MONSTERS in 3-D\n\nBack in the 1980s an American Godzilla project, with a script written by Fred Dekker, looked set to go into production, with Dave Allen lined up to do the stop-motion animation to bring the great reptile to life . Steve Miner was attached as director and William Stout produced lots of concept art and storyboards. The movie, which was set to feature a more dinosaur-like Godzilla, never got made, maybe because it was obviously going to be full of special effects and would be very costly. Stout has said that he also thought that Steve Miner might have been an issue. Miner had directed a couple of high-grossing FRIDAY THE 13TH movies, but perhaps the Hollywood studios wondered if he had the directing chops to do this big scale film justice. Whatever the reasons were, this 3-D take on Big G stalled.\n\nThese are some of the many storyboard panels created by William Stout, which were done so that Steve Miner could come up with a realistic effects budget…\n\nIn the script Godzilla attacks San Francisco and ends up dying on Alcatraz. Here’s William Stout’s illustration of Godzilla at Alcatraz…\n\nThis is the preliminary charcoal drawing William Stout made prior to creating a presentation painting…\n\nStephen Czerkas sculpted the fully articulated foam rubber animation maquette, based on Stout’s Godzilla design, which Dave Allen would’ve animated…\n\nFORCE OF THE TROJANS\n\nWith a script by writer Beverly (JASON AND THE ARGONAUTS) Cross and a studio deal set up by producer Charles H. Schneer, Ray Harryhausen’s fantasy adventure project looked like it was going to get made, but it was never, sadly, given the green light by MGM.\n\nThe plot would have involved a plethora of mythical characters. Here are some of Ray Harryhausen’s concept drawings…\n\nHere’s a sculpture Ray Harryhausen did of the head of the creature known as Scylla…\n\nTIMEGATE\n\nStop-motion animator and ace matte artist Jim Danforth’s famous unmade film, TIMEGATE, was going to be a time travel tale that owed some of its plot ideas to Ray Bradbury’s short story ‘A Sound of Thunder’.\n\nDanforth would have been the writer, co-designer, director and co-producer of this sci-fi-adventure film.\n\nHere’s some artwork created by Danforth…\n\nPhil Tippet built this Triassic therapsid resin maquette. It was hand-painted in shades of green…\n\nPhil Tippett’s maquette of a Wolf-Lizard…\n\nELEPHANT RUSTLERS\n\nLegendary special effects pioneer Willis (KING KONG) O’Brien had the idea to make an adventure feature film concerning an exotic hunt for elephant thieves in Burma, where the expedition is threatened… by giant lizards that resemble Komodo Dragons! As with many of O’Brien’s concepts, the project, from 1960, was unfortunately left unmade…\n\nHAG\n\nAlso going by the name SHUT-EYE, this horror-creature-feature would have been about a night hag intent on killing everyone at a sleep disorder clinic. The supernatural she-thing would have been able to contort itself to slither through pipes and vents, and enlarge its mouth to give its victims a ‘kiss of death’ to suck away their breath. The script was optioned, special effects master Steve Wang came onboard to direct the film, but the project ultimately ground to a halt.\n\nHere are some visuals produced by Steve Wang…\n\nA detailed full-body maquette of the Hag was sculpted by Steve Wang, showing the unsettling mix of scrawniness and loose, drooping flesh…\n\nSome later Hag visuals…\n\nMONSTERS OF SHADOW LAKE\n\nWilliam R. Stromberg, who directed THE CRATER LAKE MONSTER, planned to make another movie about aquatic beasts, called MONSTERS OF SHADOW LAKE.\n\nJim Danforth produced a concept painting to help promote the project, but the flick didn’t get made…\n\nCENTAURI III\n\nThis is another unmade movie by Jim Danforth, that would’ve, of course, featured stop-motion creatures. Here’s Danforth’s concept art showing a tentacled alien critter…\n\nTHONGOR IN THE VALLEY OF DEMONS\n\nBack in the 1970s producer Milton Subotsky considered making a Conan the Barbarian movie, then decided to try and bring sword and sorcery hero Thongor to the screen instead. The film’s highlights would have included giant flying spiders, huge serpents, magical swords, a flying metal boat, princesses and Lizard-Hawks.\n\nUnited Artists was allegedly going to foot the bill, but pulled out and Subotsky’s production stalled permanently. This is a real shame, because this could’ve been a fun sword and sorcery yarn with sci-fi elements and stop-motion monsters!\n\nModeler Tony McVey, who’d worked on SINBAD AND THE EYE OF THE TIGER, built a stop-motion model of a Lizard-Hawk. The animation of the film’s creatures would have been handled by Barry Leith, an animator of British kids shows like THE WOMBLES (1975).\n\nHere are some shots of the Lizard-Hawk model…\n\nKRANGOA\n\nJim Danforth tried to get a giant ape movie made in the 90s, called KRANGOA, but, as so often happens, the project failed to get traction, despite the fact Danforth painted this wonderful concept artwork…\n\nTHE BUBBLES\n\nThis unrealized early 1960s Willis O’Brien project would have been about massive, tentacled jellyfish-type creatures appearing in Baja, California, where they start eating up everything in their path.\n\nHere’s some concept artwork O’Brien produced to illustrate his ideas…\n\nKING KONG VS. FRANKENSTEIN\n\nThis was yet another unmade Willis O’Brien flick (and there were many more, such as WAR EAGLES, etc). This project, also known as KING KONG VS. PROMETHEUS, was conceived by O’Brien as a sequel to KING KONG (1933), with the big ape coming face to face with an equally enormous Frankenstein Monster.\n\nO’Brien’s story idea was stolen by producer John Beck, who sold it to Toho, who ultimately made KING KONG VS. GODZILLA instead, in 1962. O’Brien contemplated suing Beck for intent to defraud, but he did not have enough money for a protracted legal battle. On November 10th, 1962, Willis O’Brien died of a heart attack in his home. His widow, Darlyne, would later cite “the frustration of the King Kong Vs. Frankenstein deal” as a contributing factor to his death.\n\nHere are some of the pencil, pen & ink and gouache illustrations that Willis O’Brien created for the project that was stolen from him…\n\nHere Willis O’Brien’s detailed sketch depicts six panels with different concepts for Frankenstein’s Monster, with human figures drawn in-between the panels for scale comparison…\n\nI AM LEGEND\n\nRidley Scott planned to make his version of I AM LEGEND in the late 90s. This take on the Richard Matheson story would have starred Arnold Schwarzenegger. It was going to be a sophisticated, dark, artsy and psychological film with minimal dialogue but, unfortunately, the $100 million budget kept climbing and the studio, Warner Brothers, shut it down and Scott went off to direct his hit film GLADIATOR instead.\n\nOne of the artists Scott worked with on I AM LEGEND, to help visualise the film, was Sylvain Despretz. Here are some of his concepts for the Hemocytes: humanoid creatures that resembled zombies…\n\nHIERO’S JOURNEY\n\nYes – this is another never-made Jim Danforth project! This would have been a Columbia film, based on a post-apocalyptic science fiction novel written by American writer Sterling Lanier, but it was not put into production.\n\nHere we see a beautifully-painted piece of concept art depicting a lizard-riding huntress…\n\nOkay, let’s finish this article with two more examples of concept artwork from Ray Harryhausen.\n\nThis is his drawing for an unmade adaptation of H.G. Wells’ FOOD OF THE GODS…\n\nAnd here’s Ray Harryhausen’s concept drawing for the unproduced lost world movie VALLEY OF THE MIST, from 1950…"
