        "text": "I really enjoyed the War World books, Mote in God's Eye, Lucifer's Hammer, and pretty much all Science Fiction written by the collaborative minds of Niven & Pournelle.\n\nI like human-focused Science Fiction with a military undercurrent, somewhat gritty. What other authors out there write similar Sci-Fi...I don't like the highly intellectual, rambling Sci-Fi stories--I like a good fast paced action yarn, sci-fi mystery (Mote In God's Eye had a lot of mystery tension building up).\n\nI have not thought about \"The Mote in God's Eye\" for many years.I read it about 18 or 19 years ago.\n\n(pause now to contemplate my age...sigh)\n\nIt's fun to look back now and imagine a world dominated by a triumphant Soviet Union. Today this is more of a stretch than flying into a star, depending on your Langston Field to protect you.\n\nThanks for bringing up a fond memory. I will have to find that book again and see how it reads now.\n\n\"War of the Worlds\" is another favorite. I re-read it every year or two.\n\nWhat other authors out there write like this? The only recent Sci-Fi books I really enjoyed were the Dune pre-quels written by Herbert's son, which fit the above mold pretty well.\n\nAny recommendations would be appreciated....thanks in advance."
