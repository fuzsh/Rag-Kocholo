        "meta_description": "Jerry Pournelle discusses the novel he co-wrote with Larry Niven, “The Gripping Hand.” He begins by explaining that the book is a sequel to their best-selling science fiction novel, “The Mote in God’s Eye.” He talks about previous books he has written which take place in the future, and why he decided to include extraterrestrial life. He describes the isolation of living in a space colony. He discusses his career working for N.A.S.A and how that has helped him write about space. Pournelle describes how he incorporated computers into his previous novels, and talks about how technology has advanced since then. He ends the interview by discussing how he writes with Niven, and how they share plotting and writing responsibilities.",
