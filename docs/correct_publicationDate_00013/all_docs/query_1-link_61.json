        "text": "\"Inferno\" by Niven & Pournelle\n\nI found this great book secondhand recently, and I see that it was nominated for Hugo & Nebula awards in 1976. Anybody here read it? I'm enjoying it very much.\n\nHigh Justice, by Jerry Pournelle\n\nJerry Pournelle is best known these days as the long-time collaborator of Larry Niven. Together Niven and Pournelle in the 70's and 80's wrote some of the biggest, block-buster SF novels of all time, many of which can be found in this list that I am creating. Pournelle was also well known as...\n\nThe Legacy of Heorot, by Niven, Pournelle & Barnes\n\nI can clearly remember that at one particular point in my life when I decided that I loved SF and that I would do my damndest to read as much of it as possible.

From this starting point...\n\nFallen Angels by Niven, Pournelle, and Flynn\n\nSo, if you’re like me, sitting there feeling bitter and nostalgic about the fact that humans aren’t yet living on the moon or Mars or mining the asteroids, what do you do if you’re not a rocket scientist or wealthy enough to pay your way into space? One thing I do is read (and reread) Fallen...\n\nPournelle, Niven and Barnes:- Legacy of Heorot\n\nPournelle, Nivern and Barnes:- Legacy of Heorot Ok, I know its three different authors but they have to fit in somewhere. The book? Its a fantastic story. 200 humans and a ship full of frozen animal embryo's arrive at a planet called Tau Ceti four and set up a base on a small island next to a..."
