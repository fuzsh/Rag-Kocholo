        "text": "Pournelle's Future History: Reading Order\n\nWhile the Timeline describes the events that happen in the stories and their exact timing, this page tells you what order the stories should be read in.\n\nJerry Pournelle’s Future History series is divided into three sequences. Each of these sequences can be read independently of the others. But within each sequence, it’s best to read the stories in chronological order.\n\nThis page gives the order of the stories in each of the three sequences:\n\nThe CoDominium Stories  Humanity in the 2100’s, and the tales of Falkenberg’s Mercenary Legion.\n\nThe Second Empire Stories  The Mote in God’s Eye, its sequels, and related tales.\n\nThe War World Stories  Tales of the planet Haven, the Sauron invasion, and its aftermath. (Also includes a full reading order containing every story!)\n\nJerry Pournelle is the author of many of these stories. The later Falkenberg stories are by Pournelle and S.M. Stirling. The Mote in God’s Eye and The Gripping Hand are by Larry Niven and Pournelle (and are usually filed under \"N\", not \"P\", in bookstores); Outies is by Jennifer R. Pournelle. The War World stories are written by a variety of authors, with Pournelle and John Carr as overseers  these are filed under \"P\" in bookstores, unless you’re lucky enough to live in a city with a dedicated science fiction bookstore, in which case they may be under \"Anthologies\" or \"Shared Universes\". To determine the author of a specific story, see the complete Bibliography.\n\nThe CoDominium Stories\n\nThese are the stories of the CoDominium, the mega-state formed by the American-Soviet alliance which dominates Earth during the twenty-first century.\n\nYou can acquire these stories in one of two ways. (1) Four paperback books (Falkenberg’s Legion, Prince of Mercenaries, Go Tell the Spartans, Prince of Sparta) plus the short story “He Fell Into a Dark Hole.” (2) One hardcover book (The Prince) plus the short story “He Fell Into a Dark Hole.” The Prince combines the contents of the paperbacks, plus four pages of new material. Completists will want to get The Prince for those extra four pages, but they can be skipped with little loss for those who prefer the paperbacks. As you can see from the following sequence, The Prince was not assembled in the correct chronological order.\n\nThe chronological reading order of these stories is as follows:\n\nFALKENBERG’S LEGION, Prologue. (Same as THE PRINCE, pp. 8-17.)\n\nFALKENBERG’S LEGION, Part One. (Same as THE PRINCE, pp. 18-173; the map on p. 6 is useful here.)\n\nTHE PRINCE, pages 174-176.\n\n“He Fell Into a Dark Hole.” This short story is a bit hard to find. It originally appeared in Analog, March 1973. It was reprinted in Black Holes and Other Marvels (1978, ed. Pournelle), in There Will Be War, vol. 5: Warrior (1986, ed. Pournelle), and in The Best of Jerry Pournelle (2019, ed. Carr). If you can’t find it, it isn’t essential to the remaining stories, but it gives a more personal view of Admiral Lermontov and Senator Grant than the other books do.\n\nFALKENBERG’S LEGION, Part Two: prologue and chapters 1–11. (Same as THE PRINCE, pp. 177-286.)\n\nPRINCE OF MERCENARIES: chapters 12, 13, and most of 14 (pages 134-171, ending with the words “the cheering began”). (Same as THE PRINCE, pp. 388-414.)\n\nPRINCE OF MERCENARIES: chapters 1–11. (Same as THE PRINCE, pp. 293-387.)\n\nPRINCE OF MERCENARIES: remainder of chapter 14, and then chapters 15–27. (Same as THE PRINCE, pp. 414-529; the map on p. 292 is useful here.)\n\nFALKENBERG’S LEGION, Part Two: chapter 12. (Same as THE PRINCE, pp. 287-290.)\n\nGO TELL THE SPARTANS. (Same as THE PRINCE, pp. 611-857; the map on p. 860 is quite useful.)\n\nTHE PRINCE, p. 533.\n\nFALKENBERG’S LEGION, Part Two: chapters 13–22. (Same as THE PRINCE, pp. 534-610; the map on pp. 4-5 is useful here!)\n\nPRINCE OF SPARTA. (Same as THE PRINCE, pp. 859-1151.)\n\nNote that the books West of Honor and The Mercenary are not listed in this reading order, because these books were completely incorporated into Falkenberg’s Legion (and subsequently, into The Prince). If you are interested in the publication history of these books, see the Bibliography.\n\nThe Second Empire Stories\n\nThese stories are set during the Second Empire of Man, in the thirty-first century. Most of them deal with humanity's first contact with an alien species.\n\nThe best chronological reading order of these stories is as follows:\n\n\"First Patrol\". The first story Pournelle wrote of the Empire, unpublished until after his death. It is not essential to read this before the others, but it gives a good introduction to New Scotland. It appears in The Best of Jerry Pournelle (2019, ed. Carr).\n\n\"Motelight\". This was originally intended to be the prologue to The Mote in God’s Eye, but it was cut to shorten the final book. It was later published as part of the article \"Building the Mote In God’s Eye\" (printed in Galaxy, January 1976; reprinted in A Step Farther Out [1979, Pournelle], and reprinted again in N-Space [1990, Niven]). \"Motelight\" appears near the beginning of the article \"Building the Mote in God’s Eye\". Within this article, the story \"Motelight\" is printed in italics, and ends with the words \"for one hundred and fifteen years.\" The rest of the article is an essay that should not be read until after you have read The Mote in God’s Eye!\n\n\"In Memoriam: Howard Grote Littlemead\". This is Larry Niven’s rewrite of \"Motelight\", in verse! It was published in the hard-to-find Niven’s Laws (1984, Niven). Very optional.\n\n\"Reflex\". This was originally intended to be the first chapter of The Mote in God’s Eye, but it was cut to make the novel shorter. It eventually appeared in There Will Be War vol. I (1983, ed. Pournelle) and in The Best of Jerry Pournelle (2019, ed. Carr).\n\nTHE MOTE IN GOD’S EYE.\n\nOptionally, you can now read the remainder of the article \"Building the Mote In God’s Eye\".\n\nKING DAVID’S SPACESHIP. This novel takes place at the exact same time as The Mote in God's Eye, but should be read after it to avoid spoilers.\n\nTHE GRIPPING HAND.\n\nOUTIES.\n\nThe three introductory pieces (\"Motelight\", \"In Memoriam: Howard Grote Littlemead\", and \"Reflex\") may be hard to find. If you can't track them down, just skip them. (Remember, the authors deleted these stories from the book, so they aren't essential!) The Mote in God’s Eye is one of the greatest science-fiction novels ever written, and is highly recommended  with or without these prequels.\n\nThe War World Stories\n\nAs I mentioned above, the tales in the War World books are in a complicated order.\n\nThe first War World books were short-story collections, published in paperback format (one of which was later issued in a second edition). These books, and the abbreviations used for them, are:\n\nWWI  War World, volume I: The Burning Eye\n\nWWI(1st) is the first edition: 1988 paperback\n\nWWI(2nd) is the second edition: 2015 hardcover and 2016 ebook\n\nWWII  War World, volume II: Death’s Head Rebellion\n\nWWIII  War World, volume III: Sauron Dominion\n\nWWIV  War World, volume IV: Invasion\n\nWWCD  CoDominium: Revolt on War World\n\nNext, several novels were published. Most of them were expanded versions of some of the previously-published short stories:\n\nBlood Feuds: A Novel of War World\n\nBlood Vengeance: A Novel of War World\n\nThe Battle of Sauron: A Novel of War World\n\nFirst edition: 2007 hardcover\n\nSecond edition: 2013 ebook\n\nWar World: The Lidless Eye\n\nWar World: Cyborg Revolt\n\nNext, a new batch of short-story collections, published as hardcovers and ebooks, were released. These included many new stories, as well as reprints of some of the stories from the paperback collections. Unlike the paperback collections, these were mostly arranged chronologically:\n\nWWD  War World: Discovery\n\nWWTO  War World: Takeover\n\nWWJ  War World: Jihad!\n\nWWPW  War World: The Patriotic Wars\n\nWWFCD  War World: The Fall of the CoDominium\n\nWWRW  War World: Road Warriors\n\nFinally, a Falkenberg novel was released that incorporated the existing stories of Falkenberg on Haven, plus new material:\n\nWar World: Falkenberg’s Regiment\n\nSimple reading order option\n\nThe simplest reading order takes advantage of the fact that the latest short-story collections are mostly chronological. It also avoids purchasing books that duplicate stories in other books.\n\nFirst, read these short-story collections: War World: Discovery, War World: Takeover, War World: Jihad!, War World: The Patriotic Wars, War World: The Fall of the CoDominium, and War World: Road Warriors. These stories relate the story of Haven from 1990 until 2110.\n\nNext, read these novels: The Battle of Sauron (2nd edition), War World: The Lidless Eye, and War World: Cyborg Revolt. These novels tell of the Secession Wars and the arrival of the last remaining Saurons to the planet Haven in the twenty-seventh century.\n\nFinally, read these novels: Blood Feuds and Blood Vengeance. These novels tell a dark story (inspired by classic Greek tragedies) that takes place on Haven from 2940 to 2993.\n\nThe upside of this reading order is that it allows you to read the vast majority of the stories without having to buy books that contain duplicate stories or to skip back and forth between the books you have. The downside is that some stories are omitted, and in a few cases the stories are not read in chronological order (although they are close enough that you won’t notice the difference).\n\nComplete reading order option\n\nTo read all the Haven stories in chronological order, you will have to acquire every War World book except for the first edition of The Battle of Sauron. (Each of the other War World books contains at least one story that isn't duplicated elsewhere. In particular, this means you will need the second edition of The Battle of Sauron, and both editions of War World: The Burning Eye.) Once you have these books, the following list of stories shows you the correct reading order to follow.\n\nIn this reading order, each short story or passage is followed by an indication of which book it is in. If it appears in multiple books, they are all listed, separated by equal signs. For example, the very first item (“The Lost and the Founder”) appears in three books  CoDominium: Revolt on War World, War World, Volume I: The Burning Eye (2nd edition only), and War World: Discovery  each of which is listed by its abbreviation, with the page numbers of the story indicated. Of course, if you purchase the ebook editions you won't see any page numbers, but the stories can be found in the table of contents.\n\nIn addition to stories, these collections contain some short texts that are often untitled. In this reading order, I have described such items and their locations in the books so that they will be easy to locate.\n\nNovels are listed in all-capital letters.\n\nWhen stories overlap, I have put them in the best reading order rather than try to intertwine them. However, there are a few times that there was no way to avoid breaking a story up into pieces due to other intervening stories. See the Timeline for full details of the dates of each story.\n\nThis whole list is chronological, but I have broken it down into separate \"sagas\" to give it more structure. If you read all the stories in order you will end up with the best and broadest sense of Haven’s history. But if you’d rather jump into some other point, it is best to at least keep each of these \"sagas\" intact!\n\nThe War World stories are listed in black font. The CoDominium and Second Empire stories are listed in in green font: include these stories if you want to read the complete Future History!\n\nThe Founding of Haven  1990’s to 2040’s\n\n“The Lost and the Founder”: WWCD 1-6 = WWI(2nd) 29-32 = WWD 13-16.\n\n“Almost a Believer” prologue (Steinhopf’s entry on Levant): WWRW 19-20.\n\n“Almost a Believer”: WWRW 21-70.\n\n“Discovery”: WWI(1st) 1-8 (entitled “Prolog: Discovery”) = WWI(2nd) 34-40 = WWD 17-27.\n\n“The Garden Spot” prologue (Overton at Luna Base): WWD 24-27.\n\n“The Garden Spot”: WWCD 7-48 = WWD 28-63.\n\n“Haven’s Day-Night Cycles”: WWI(1st) 279.\n\nCrofton’s entry for Bureau of Corrections: WWD 64-66 (before “In Concert”).\n\nCrofton’s entry for Church of New Universal Harmony: WWCD 49-54.\n\n“In Concert”: WWCD 55-109 = WWD 67-114.\n\n“The Shimmer Stone Scam”: WWD 115-124.\n\n“To Win the Peace” prologue (Ulrich’s on 26th CD Regiment): WWTO 11-14.\n\n“Nothing In Common”: WWD 125-163.\n\n“Hell’s-a-Comin’”: WWD 164-180.\n\n“Counterpoint”: WWD 181-225.\n\n“Astronomy Lesson”: WWD 226-228.\n\n“On Jordan’s Stormy Banks”: WWD 229-262.\n\nDeportees and Corporate Rivalries  2050’s\n\n“Janesfort War” prologue (Cole at Luna Base): WWCD 110-113 = WWI(2nd) 74-771 = WWD 263-265.\n\n“Janesfort War”: WWCD 114-182 = WWI(2nd) 78-141 = WWD 266-325.\n\n“To Win the Peace”: WWTO 15-89.\n\nHaven Atlas entry on steppes: WWIII 80-81.\n\n“Steppe Stone”: WWD 347-369.\n\n“Last Chance”: WWD 326-346.\n\nPart of “Down the Rabid Hole”: WWD 370-383 only (everything except epilogue).\n\n“The Raid on Purity”: WWTO 90-115.\n\n“Marching on Poland”: WWTO 116-125.\n\n“Enough Rope” prologue (Maxwell Cole in orbit): WWTO 126-128.\n\n“Enough Rope”: WWTO 129-210.\n\nFALKENBERG'S REGIMENT, Part One.\n\nFALKENBERG’S LEGION, Prologue.

The first story Pournelle wrote of the Empire, unpublished until after his death. It appears in The Best of Jerry Pournelle (2019, ed. Carr).\n\n\"Motelight\". This was originally intended to be the prologue to The Mote in God’s Eye, but it was cut to shorten the final book. It was later published as part of the article \"Building the Mote In God’s Eye\" (printed in Galaxy, January 1976; reprinted in A Step Farther Out [1979, Pournelle], and reprinted again in N-Space [1990, Niven]). \"Motelight\" appears near the beginning of the article \"Building the Mote in God’s Eye\". Within this article, the story \"Motelight\" is printed in italics, and ends with the words \"for one hundred and fifteen years.\" The rest of the article is an essay that should not be read until after you have read The Mote in God’s Eye!\n\n\"In Memoriam: Howard Grote Littlemead\". This is Larry Niven’s rewrite of \"Motelight\", in verse! It was published in the hard-to-find Niven’s Laws (1984, Niven).

This was originally intended to be the first chapter of The Mote in God’s Eye, but it was cut to make the novel shorter. It eventually appeared in There Will Be War vol. I (1983, ed. Pournelle) and in The Best of Jerry Pournelle (2019, ed. Carr).\n\nTHE MOTE IN GOD’S EYE.\n\nOptionally, you can now read the remainder of the article \"Building the Mote In God’s Eye\".\n\nKING DAVID’S SPACESHIP. This novel takes place at the exact same time as The Mote in God's Eye, but should be read after it to avoid spoilers.\n\n“Haven’s Hell”: WWI(2nd) 526-555.\n\n“A Lion to the Sea” prologue (Chronicle of the Norskuna): WWI(1st) 310-313 = WWI(2nd) 474-476.\n\n“A Lion to the Sea”: WWI(1st) 314-360 = WWI(2nd) 477-518.\n\nTHE GRIPPING HAND.\n\nOUTIES.\n\nNote that the stories “The Field of Double Sowing”, “Far Above Rubies”, “Juchi the Accursed”, and “Seven Against Nûrnen” are not listed in this reading order, because these stories were incorporated (in an expanded form) into the novel Blood Feuds. The story “Sons of Hawaii” is not listed, because it was revised and expanded as “Sons of the Northern Plains”. The stories “Rate of Exchange”, “The Face of the Enemy”, “The Coming of the Eye”, “A Better Kind of War”, and “Death’s Head Patrol” are not listed, because they were incorporated (and expanded) into the novels The Battle of Sauron, The Lidless Eye, and Cyborg Revolt. The stories “High Jingo” and “Peace At Any Price” are not listed, because they were incorporated into the novel Falkenberg’s Regiment. Finally, the first edition of The Battle of Sauron is not listed here, because part of its text were reprinted in the second edition (chapters 1 to 31 are identical in both editions), and the remaining portions were reprinted in The Lidless Eye and Cyborg Revolt. So even though these items are not included explicitly in the reading order above, they appear under alternate names.\n\nJerry Pournelle's Future History . . . . .
