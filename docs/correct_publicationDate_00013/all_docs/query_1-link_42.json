Former library book.\n\nCover art: Stephen Hickman\n\nBlurb: “THE GRAND MASTER OF HUGE IDEAS AND STAR-SPANNING WONDER:\n\nFor half a century, Jerry Pournelle's name has been synonymous with hard-hitting, idea-driven, wonder-inducing science fiction. His Falkenberg's Legion stories and Janissaries series helped define the military SF genre, his CoDominium universe is an SF standard for worldbuilding and future history, and his novels with frequent collaborator Larry Niven are some of the most important works science fiction has ever seen—and the best-selling and most read.\n\nNow, for the first time, Pournelle's best short work is collected together in a single volume. Here are over a dozen short stories, each with a new introduction by editor and long-time Pournelle assistant John F. Carr. There is also a cornucopia of Pournelle's rampantly imaginative and compelling essays as well as great remembrances by Pournelle collaborators Larry Niven, S.M. Stirling, and more!”\n\nISBN: 978-1-9821-2417-5"
