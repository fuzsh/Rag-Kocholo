In almost all cases, the first book was originally stand-alone, and the sequel came out years later.\n\nThe Moties\n\nThe Mote in God’s Eye (1974)\n\nThe Gripping Hand (1993)\n\nThe Burning City\n\nThe Burning City (2000)\n\nBurning Tower (2005)\n\nHeorot\n\nThe Legacy of Heorot (1987)\n\nBeowulf’s Children (1995)\n\nInferno\n\nInferno (1976)\n\nEscape from Hell (2009)\n\nUnrelated Works (no particular order)\n\nFallen Angels (1992)\n\nFootfall (1985)\n\nLucifer’s Hammer (1977)\n\nOath of Fealty (1981)\n\nJerry also wrote a number of works leading up to Mote in his CoDominium/Empire of Man universe. Most of them are part of the Falkenberg’s Legion saga, which is set roughly 900 years before Mote:\n\nWest of Honor\n\nThe Mercenary\n\nPrince of Mercenaries\n\nGo Tell the Spartans\n\nPrince of Sparta\n\nNote: The book Falkenberg’s Legion is a compilation of West of Honor and The Mercenary. The book The Prince is a compilation of the entire saga."
