In the 1960s and early 1970s he worked in the aerospace industry, but eventually focused on his writing career. Pournelle was particularly known as a writer of hard science fiction for which he received multiple awards. In addition to his solo writing, he wrote several novels with collaborators, most notably Larry Niven. Pournelle was active in the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America and served a term as its president."
