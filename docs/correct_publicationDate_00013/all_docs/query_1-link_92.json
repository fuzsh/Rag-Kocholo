Without it, they will establish their own. But what type of governance? In Volume 2 of the Imperial Stars series, bestselling author Jerry Pournelle explores this question.\n\nHis reluctant conclusion suggests that throughout history, regardless of their original form, all governments either evolve into empires or succumb to them. From Babylon to Persia, Rome to the USSR, despite lofty beginnings, tyranny ultimately prevails.\n\nYet, is there a form of government that can resist the corruption of power while also standing firm against imperial ambitions?\n\nVernor Vinge won five Hugo Awards.
