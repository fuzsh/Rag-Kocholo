And since no life was possible on Saturn or its moons, the ship had to be a visitor from another star.\n\nThe aliens were coming!\n\nMankind's frantic efforts to signal the invader went unanswered. First contact came when the aliens blasted the Soviet space station and seized the survivors, following that by destroying every dam and major installation on Earth by a rain of asteroids from space. Then the Snouts descended on Kansas, demanding servile sur-render or death for all humans.\n\nThus begins a war of indescribable violence and incredible destruction, with the outcome in doubt until the final page.\n\nCaught up in the conflict of this magnificently conceived and detailed novel are dozens of truly memorable characters: Harry, who crossed half a ruined continent to save another man's wife; Harpanet, the alien who gave his allegiance to humanity; Jenny, who brought the news of the invader and was caught up in the President's councils; Congressman Wes Dawson, who, captured by aliens, tried to serve both sides; and a host of others—both human and alien.\n\nThis is how it could happen— in a novel never to be forgotten!\n\nMen first saw the invader as a series of dots on astronomical plates.
