        "text": "That's sad to hear. I used to read a lot of his books\n\nMy favorite as a kid was probably the hard scifi novel Footfall.\n\nBaby elephant aliens show up from Alpha Centauri and drop a bunch of asteroids on us.\n\nAfter getting our ass kicked we respond with this thing:\n\nIt was propelled by nuclear bombs detonated under that hemispherical plate.\n\nThe aliens evolved from herd animals and when losing a fight for dominance it was expected the losing herd would surrender and join the winner as the lowest members.\n\nWhen that thing launched the leader asked some captured humans if it was to increase our standing in the herd when we surrendered. The humans said, no it was likely coming to wipe all of the aliens out.\n\nThe leader thought that was insane they hadn't tried to wipe all of the humans out. The humans replied that they should have figured out what humans were before attacking us.\n\nThat's sad to hear.

The humans replied that they should have figured out what humans were before attacking us.\n\nI really enjoyed Footfall, The Mote in God's Eye and Lucifer's Hammer. Niven and Pournelle were the first hard sci-fi I read way back when.\n\ndang, it's been a long time since i read a computer shopper\n\nthose things were massive\n\nLoDaPC was two people named Alice and Bill. The good old days when Computer Shopper was the size of a NYC phone book.\n\nCurrent digital versions of Computer Shopper are about 140 pages vs. 300+ pages for the print versions which ceased mid 2009. Yes those were the days, and they were free too.\n\nArchives - July 1991 to April 2009.\n\nhttps://www.highbeam.com/publications/computer-shopper-p408135\n\nJan 2001 - https://ia601700.us.archive.org/18/items/computer_shopper_2001-01/ComputerShopper_January_2001.pdf\n\nAug 2017 - https://psv4.userapi.com/c812221/u4.../Computer_Shopper__Issue_354__August_2017.pdf\n\nCurrent digital versions of Computer Shopper are about 140 pages vs. 300+ pages for the print versions which ceased mid 2009. Yes those were the days, and they were free too.\n\nThat 300 page edition was the 2nd generation after the magazine had been pared way down. That happened in the late 90's or early 00s as so many people were online and already buying their PC parts that way. The REAL Computer Shopper from the early to mid 1990s was 800 pages minimum for a small issue and regularly topped out over 1000."
