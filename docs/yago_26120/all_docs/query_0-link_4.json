With best buddy Maz (Ralph Macchio), Artie plays on a team for Ed's Bar and Swill -- until their brawling behavior threatens to get them kicked out of the league. In order to maintain their place, they'll have to defeat the champions at Manganelli Fitness -- no easy task when their blood-alcohol levels exceed their batting averages.",
