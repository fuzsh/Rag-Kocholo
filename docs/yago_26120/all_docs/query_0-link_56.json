        "text": "Artie Lange — a comedian whose celebrity is skyrocketing and whose life is a tumultuous script of peaks and valleys.\n\nLange (pronounced \"Lang\") sits in one of the most coveted seats in showbiz as comedic sidekick to radio legend Howard Stern. That he's featured on the most-listened-to satellite radio show makes him noteworthy. But it's his troubled life, down-to-earth personality and ranging talent that make him a downright interesting character.\n\nHere's everything you need to know before you Go!\n\nLange recalls, somewhat lovingly, that he first heard \"The Howard Stern Show\" while working on the docks of New Jersey as a longshoreman. Reminiscing, Lange still marvels at his rise from taking orange juice off ships to working for a radio show known for innovation and controversy.\n\nHis journey as a performer began as a sketch and stand-up comedian in New York City, where his talent eventually landed him on the cast of \"Mad TV,\" a sketch comedy show. In a recurring skit called \"That's My White Momma,\" Lange played the muu-muu-wearing, tuna-fish-craving white mother of a black family, whose signature line was, \"Don't make me break my foot off in yo' ass!\" This kind of humorous racial commentary is still sprinkled through Lange's comedy.\n\nLange has been featured in movies such as \"Dirty Work,\" and had bit parts in \"Elf\" and \"Old School.\" He recently wrote and produced the film \"Artie Lange's Beer League,\" about a boozy group of softball players, which had little success at the box office but gained a cult \"Artie\" following. On television, Lange has recently been featured in the HBO hit \"Entourage\" and had a recurring role on the FX series \"Rescue Me.\"\n\nStill, he's best-known for his irreverent, profane and belly-aching antics on \"The Howard Stern Show\" on Sirius Satellite Radio, where the real Artie — the beloved and tragic guy — is revealed. Riding his radio popularity, he has sold out the likes of Carnegie Hall (in a single day) and the Tower Theater in Philadelphia.\n\nLange left \"Mad TV\" in 1997 after he was arrested and jailed for possession of cocaine in Los Angeles.\n\n\"The anal cavity search wasn't on my to-do list,\" he recently joked about his booking.\n\nHis arrest was the low point in a series of struggles with addiction. He's fought cocaine, heroin, alcohol and gambling addictions, all of which have become fodder for his comedy routine.\n\nBy his own admission, he continues to drink too much. Jack Daniel's and water is his favorite. Fans throw sample bottles of Jack onto the stage and Artie, being the fan pleaser he is, drinks them.\n\nHe's also had a stint with \"Lady Heroin,\" as he calls it, causing him to call in sick to the Stern show several times.\n\n\"I'm not going to be able to make it in today,\" a classic Artie sick call goes. Then fake coughs. \"I'm sick as a dog.\"\n\nWith the help of medication and self-discipline, most of Artie's bad addictions are behind him — except one. He eats nonstop, and in the past year he's gained 100 pounds, now spinning the numbers at about 300 pounds.\n\nFor Artie, a typical breakfast on the radio includes a heavily buttered bagel, a caramel mochiatta, a cupcake, cookies, other sugar-loaded treats, and several bottles of Hawaiian Punch. For dinner one night, he admits, he ate four slices of pizza and a chicken parm sandwich.\n\nAfter discovering his bingeing may have led to type 2 diabetes, Artie has begun dieting, or at least trying to diet, which he says makes him \"grumpy.\" Part of his strategy is to smoke more cigarettes and drink water until dinner arrives, rather than his usual \"seven Cokes.\"\n\nThe New York Post recently did a story on Lange, who didn't like the accompanying photos.\n\n\"It's the worst picture in the history of show business,\" he said on the radio. \"I look like the pig from 'Charlotte's Web.' They say a camera adds 10 pounds; well, they must have had 16 cameras.\"\n\nA fellow comedian, Joe Matarese, joked, \"Artie's as big as Elvis and he's as BIG as Elvis.\"\n\nPerhaps it's all of these foibles that make Lange lovable, or better, relatable. In a recent fan ranking of stand-up comedians, Lange was in the upper echelon with names like Pryor and Carlin. He admits he might not be quite that funny, but his fans are just that loyal.\n\nHe has become an adored personality. He talks to fans as though they're old friends from Jersey, he dresses as if he's sitting on the couch at home rather than on stage in a concert hall, and he shares the stories of his life even when they're ugly or embarrassing.\n\nHe's the kind of celebrity America cheers for — a lovable, hilarious guy with serious flaws.\n\nThe whole funny package will be on display tomorrow in Poughkeepsie.\n\nWhat: Artie Lange\n\nWhere: Mid-Hudson Civic Center, 14 Civic Center Plaza, Poughkeepsie\n\nWhen: 8 p.m. Nov. 17\n\nTickets: $41.50-$46.50\n\nCall: 454-3388"
