        "text": "DATE September 14, 2006 ACCOUNT NUMBER N/A\n\nTIME 12:00 Noon-1:00 PM AUDIENCE N/A\n\nNETWORK NPR\n\nPROGRAM Fresh Air\n\nInterview: Artie Lange discusses his new movie \"Beer League,\"\n\nbecoming a radio celebrity, some of the bizarre bits on \"Howard\n\nStern Show,\" and his dark family history\n\nTERRY GROSS, host:\n\nThis is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross.\n\nA lot of us at FRESH AIR are fans of the \"Howard Stern Show,\" and we know many\n\nof our listeners are, too. We think that he uses the medium of radio\n\nbrilliantly, with the help of his regular cast of characters. One of them is\n\nmy guest, Artie Lange. Lange is a comic and actor. Since joining the \"Howard\n\nStern Show\" in 2001, he's become famous for his hilarious stories, which are\n\nusually about his biggest problems, like drinking, overeating, gambling, and\n\nhis on-again/off-again relationship with his girlfriend, who now seems to be\n\nhis ex-girlfriend. Artie was an original cast member of the sketch comedy\n\nshow \"MADtv,\" and was on the ABC sitcom \"Norm.\" He's appeared in the films\n\n\"Dirty Work,\" \"The Bachelor,\" \"Old School,\" and \"Elf.\" Artie Lange co-wrote\n\nand stars in the new movie comedy \"Beer League.\" The film is about a group of\n\nguys in New Jersey whose softball team is in the league playoffs. For them,\n\nsoftball is more about drinking beer and goofing off than playing ball.\n\nHow close is the character you play in \"Beer League\" to you?\n\nMr. ARTIE LANGE: Too close. This would be me if I didn't get lucky and get\n\ninto show business. I would be exactly this guy, unfortunately. I'd be, you\n\nknow, by the time I was this age, probably, a raging alcoholic playing in a\n\nsoftball league that I took way too seriously and probably living with my\n\nmother. That sounds like an accurate description.\n\nGROSS: Tell me a story from the movie that actually comes from your real\n\nlife.\n\nMr. LANGE: You know, these leagues are all--they call them \"beer leagues,\"\n\nthey should really call them `hard liquor leagues.' Drinking is just such a\n\npart of the softball culture before, sometimes during, and after a game. I\n\nplayed in a league where every base was a quarter keg of beer, and you had a\n\ncup in your back pocket. If you got on base, you filled up. And I don't know\n\nwho in the town committee allowed this to happen, but within two weeks they\n\nhad to, you know, get rid of the league because people were just drunk by the\n\nsecond inning, throwing bats, and it was violent.\n\nAnd the fight in the film, in particular the old guy on our team, played by\n\nSeymour Cassel--he has a line in the movie where he tells the one kid to hold\n\nanother guy's head while he tries to kick him--that really happened. I played\n\nin a league where a guy who was about 78 years old, who was our pitcher, and a\n\nbrawl busted out and he told my friend on our team to hold the kid's head\n\nwhile he tried to kick him. And he went to kick him and he, you know, he\n\ngrabbed his gut and he fell down. We thought he had a heart attack. So it's\n\nbasically--the fight in the movie is based on several different fights that\n\nactually happened.\n\nGROSS: You're the lead in your new movie.\n\nMr. LANGE: Right.\n\nGROSS: You co-wrote it, you star in it. You have a girlfriend in it. It's\n\nabout you. You're not, like the friend of the lead?\n\nMr. LANGE: Right, right, right. I play the best friend a lot.\n\nGROSS: So are there things you were able to write for yourself that other\n\npeople haven't written for you? In terms of having situations that you want\n\nto play.\n\nMr. LANGE: Yeah. Well, it's funny. Like, I got a--the parts I played in\n\nother movies, I would just get to come in and do funny stuff. Well, I was in\n\na movie called \"The Bachelor\" with Renee Zellweger and Chris O'Donnell. That\n\nwas probably the biggest studio film that I had ever been in that I had a big\n\npart in. And I was a little more than just the guy to come in for comic\n\nrelief, like I was in \"Dirty Work\" or this other thing I did, \"Lost and\n\nFound.\" So I did--I had a wife in that movie. And that was a different thing\n\nfor me, having a romantic interest that you had to sort of, you know, have a\n\nreal moment with that's not about comedy, you know? Like, it's hard for me in\n\nreal life, and playing it onscreen with a total stranger was totally foreign\n\nto me.\n\nBut, as the lead--see, I just like doing jokes. I don't care about the other\n\nstuff that isn't funny. But you need the other stuff to make a complete\n\nmovie. So as the lead, you have to--you have to handle all of the exposition\n\nin the film. Not just the jokes, the storyline, and some of the romantic\n\nstuff and the more sappy stuff that sets up the comedy, the stuff that's sappy\n\nthat makes you a more sympathetic character and a more likeable guy to get\n\naway with the funny stuff. So I never really had to do any of that in a\n\nmovie. A lot of my dialogue in this movie is exposition to move the story\n\nalong, because I'm the guy it's about. And I have a serious girlfriend in the\n\nfilm, and that's really covered. And, you know, I gave myself a hot chick. I\n\nalways said, you know, once people see the girl in the movie that plays my\n\ngirlfriend that I get, they're going to think it's in the science fiction\n\nsection, not the comedy section. But, you know, I gave myself a hot chick and\n\nthere's scenes where, you know, I have to have dinner with her. And it's not\n\njokes, it's really like, OK, these two guys getting to know each other and,\n\nyou know, trying to be sentimental. And that all helps you get away with the\n\ncomedy. It sets up the comedy.\n\nI hated doing that. The director had to really keep me focused to get through\n\nthe serious, sappy stuff. But watching how he put it together, he was--he was\n\nso right. It really makes you like the two characters and feel for them and\n\ncare about them, and it makes every other part of the movie work.\n\nGROSS: If you're just joining us, my guest is comic and actor Artie Lange,\n\nfrom the \"Howard Stern Show.\" He's got a new movie that he co-wrote and stars\n\nin. It's called \"Beer League.\"\n\nNow, the first time you were on \"Howard Stern Show\" was as a guest with Norm\n\nMacDonald...(network audio difficulties).\n\nMr. LANGE: Right.\n\nGROSS: You were really funny on it. How did you go from being a guest to\n\nbeing part of the regular cast of characters?\n\nMr. LANGE: Well, that appearance was to promote a film called \"Dirty Work.\"\n\nAnd Norm knew how big of a fan of the Stern show I was. He was going in to\n\npromote the film. He said, `Hey, why don't you come with me and maybe, you\n\nknow, Howard'll have you on?' And Norm at the time was going through kind of a\n\ncrazy separation sort of divorce, and he didn't want to deal with that. And\n\nHoward, you know, always asks those personal questions. So Norm said, `Hey,\n\nif that happens, I'll bring you in and we'll talk about the movie.' So sure\n\nenough, a minute into Norm's interview, that happened. And they bring me in,\n\nand as they're putting the headset on me, Norm says to Howard, on the air--and\n\nI did not he was going to do this--he said, `Howard, you'll love Artie. He\n\ngot kicked off of \"MADtv\" because of cocaine. And I was--on the air, I looked\n\nat him like, `What the hell did you just say?' and Howard, of course, darted\n\nhis eyes right to me. And I told this whole story about getting arrested and\n\nalmost getting fired and going to rehab, and of course Howard loved that. He\n\nloves stories like that. So he said to Norm, `Bring Artie back when you come\n\nback and we'll hear more stories like that.'\n\nWe went back in three more times to promote a sitcom we were doing together\n\ncalled \"Norm.\" And every time I went in, I would tell another crazy story and\n\nHoward always loved it. And when the \"Norm\" show got cancelled, it was again\n\none of those things in life, perfect timing. It was a coincidence. Jackie\n\nMartling, the comedian who was on the show for years, left the show, and they\n\nwere looking for another guy. So Howard remembered me from going in with Norm\n\nseveral times, and two months later they whittled it down to a couple of guys,\n\nand then eventually I got offered the job.\n\nGROSS: Now you know how you're saying Norm MacDonald brought you on because\n\nhe didn't want to answer the personal questions that he knew Howard would\n\nask...\n\nMr. LANGE: Right.\n\nGROSS: You're asked those questions all the time.\n\nMr. LANGE: Yeah.\n\nGROSS: I mean, it's just anything about, you know, drugs, sex, your\n\ngirlfriend...\n\nMr. LANGE: Right.\n\nGROSS: ...or your ex-girlfriend, depending on what day it is.\n\nMr. LANGE: Yeah, exactly.\n\nGROSS: So, Art, were you ready for that? Are you comfortable with that? Are\n\nthere ever kind of consequences?\n\nMr. LANGE: Yes, absolutely. I--and again, it's my fault. Before anybody\n\ntakes the blame for that, I would have to. I offered it up. From the very\n\nbeginning, I was always sort of honest about my life and the bad parts as well\n\nas the good parts. And now, you know, I'm just known for being so honest that\n\nit's almost expected of me to just come clean and say everything.\n\nThere are lines I won't cross. Dating someone, that's a fine sort of--that's\n\na difficult road to go down. And I found the boundaries as we went along.\n\nThere's a story about a hooker that ripped me off in Las Vegas for $500 that I\n\ntold him off the air. And on the air, he just brought it up, and he said,\n\n`Come on, tell the story, tell the story.' And he ended up getting it out of\n\nme. It happened before I was dating my girlfriend, but we were dating at the\n\ntime he got me to tell the story, so it was a very sensitive thing. She was\n\nlike, `I can't believe you told that story,' and I said, `Well, it was before\n\nyou.' And she goes, `Yeah, but it's still embarrassing and..' So, stuff like\n\nthat has happened.\n\nGROSS: Now, listeners know that your girlfriend--or now ex-girlfriend?\n\nMr. LANGE: Right now, unfortunately, it's ex-girlfriend, yes.\n\nGROSS: Yeah, well she had always wanted you to go into therapy. You got a\n\nlot of issues...\n\nMr. LANGE: Right. Definitely.\n\nGROSS: ...with gambling, drugs, alcohol, food, other things.\n\nMr. LANGE: Every self-destructive thing, yeah.\n\nGROSS: Commitment. Yeah. So she wanted you to go into therapy. You've\n\nalways avoided therapy. Now my producer Amy pointed out that being on \"Howard\n\nStern Show\" is almost like therapy in the sense that you're always talking\n\nabout yourself, telling stories about yourself.\n\nMr. LANGE: Yes.\n\nGROSS: And Howard's always, like, forcing you to go deeper and deeper. Then\n\nmy producer Phyllis pointed out, though--although the talk part might sound\n\nlike therapy, therapy expects you to change. But on Howard's show, it's kind\n\nof like you're rewarded for that kind of behavior...\n\nMr. LANGE: Oh, absolutely.\n\nGROSS: ...because if you can get a good story out of it, that's all anybody\n\nwants.\n\nMr. LANGE: Yeah. No. That's very perceptive of both of them, actually.\n\nYeah, you know, it's weird. A lot of comics--actually, Andrew Dice Clay, who\n\nI met through the show and worked with once, would say, `What do you want to\n\ngo through therapy for? The fact that you're so screwed up in the head is why\n\nyou're funny. You know, why would you want to fix that?'\n\nAnd in a way, it makes sense. I guess all comics--at least most of them that\n\nI know--could probably use a good dose of therapy. And a lot of them are\n\nreluctant because they feel some way maybe it'll lose their edge and their\n\ncrazy view of life and why they're funny. And that sounds a little ridiculous\n\nto me, but maybe deep down I really do feel that way.\n\nGROSS: Howard's been in therapy for--very intensive therapy--for a long time.\n\nMr. LANGE: Absolutely. But he says on the air he goes, yeah, four times a\n\nweek. That's a lot.\n\nGROSS: Yeah, and, you know, I think about that. I think, OK, he spends most\n\nof the day talking about himself on the show and then he goes to therapy and\n\ntalks about himself off the air.\n\nMr. LANGE: Yes, yes. He's interested in himself, absolutely.\n\nGROSS: But have you seen the therapy change him? I mean, when do you look at\n\nhim, do you think, well, `Therapy takes the edge out of comedy'?\n\nMr. LANGE: Well, personally, I can't comment on that because I didn't know\n\nHoward...\n\nGROSS: Yeah, before the therapy, yeah.\n\nMr. LANGE: ...personally, before the therapy. As a fan of the show, it's a\n\nmuch different show from years ago when he was a married guy, sort of\n\nmiserable, not in therapy, but it's just as good, but in a different way. And\n\nI think it proves that he's just an amazing broadcaster. He could sort of get\n\nthe life he has now, you know, of a multi-multimillionaire who's an icon,\n\ndating a gorgeous model, and living the lifestyle he lives--you know, limos\n\nall over the place. But he's still able to relate to everybody because, you\n\nknow, he's just a brilliant communicator. It's just from a different angle\n\nnow, you know. He's saying, `Guess what guys? I used to be that guys you\n\ncould relate to, but now I'm a guy who was that guy and got all these things\n\nthat a lot of people dream of, and I'm telling you what it's like, you know\n\nwhen you get it,' and...\n\nGROSS: But in a way, it's your job now to be that guy that everybody can\n\nrelate to.\n\nMr. LANGE: I think--I think a lot of people think that, and that was not an\n\nintentional thing. It's amazing. People have so many theories about the\n\nshow, like, `Oh, Howard hired you so you could be the regular guy on the show,\n\nto relate to the regular blue-collar regular guy' and it's not that\n\ncalculated. It just turns out that I happen to be a guy who is a bit of a\n\nblue-collar slob. And I inherited that role on the show. It's definitely,\n\nthe regular-guy sort of viewpoint is definitely what seems to be my role on\n\nthe show, but that's not an intentional thing.\n\nGROSS: My guest is Artie Lange. We'll talk more after a break. This is\n\nFRESH AIR.\n\n(Announcements)\n\nGROSS: My guest is Artie Lange. He's a cast member of the \"Howard Stern\n\nShow.\"\n\nOne of your most famous stories from the \"Howard Stern Show\" is when--back\n\nwhen you were a regular on \"MADtv,\" the sketch comedy TV show...\n\nMr. LANGE: Right.\n\nGROSS: ...and you were doing a lot of cocaine at the time and you were very\n\nhigh and totally lacking in sleep--I think it'd been, like, four days without\n\nsleep at this point.\n\nMr. LANGE: Yes.\n\nGROSS: So the story, it's a really long and very funny kind of tragic\n\nstory...\n\nMr. LANGE: Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\nGROSS: ...about how you ended up punching one of the producers and then\n\nfleeing from the cops, because they had called the cops on you.\n\nMr. LANGE: Right.\n\nGROSS: Fleeing from the cops and then you end up punching one of the cops,\n\nand he finds cocaine on you.\n\nMr. LANGE: Yes.\n\nGROSS: So you're arrested for assaulting an officer and possessing cocaine.\n\nOK, great story, people on \"Howard Stern\" really loved it. What's it like,\n\nwhen you're working with Howard and Robin and, say you don't show up? Say\n\nyou--I don't know if you're still getting high, whatever. Say something not\n\nquite as out of control like that happens in the context of their show, do\n\nthey think it's so funny?\n\nMr. LANGE: Well, first of all, I stopped doing cocaine. I had to. The last\n\ntime I did coke--and from going to rehab, everybody remembers dates. June the\n\n14th, 1997, is the last hit of blow I did, thank God, because I was just\n\nkilling me. I still drink, and a lot of people say, `Well how can you do one\n\nwithout the other?' I've been able to do it, thank God. And, look, I've had\n\ncoke put in my hand on the road at gigs, and I'm able to just throw it away.\n\nI just look at it like death, the devil.\n\nBut last year, I had a lot of stress. I was traveling to promote a DVD of my\n\nstand-up comedy, and I did six months on the road while I was doing the show\n\nat the same time, weekend gigs. And then I was going in to shooting this film\n\n\"Beer League,\" and I was really, really stressed. And I was drinking a lot on\n\nthe road. And when I got back from Chicago, last June, the week after the\n\ngig, in between the road and shooting the movie, I sort of had a breakdown to\n\nwhere I couldn't get to work. And I've suffered through depressions, and I\n\nthink it all stems from addictions. I think my depression was caused by the\n\ndrugs I was using way back when, and I think the alcohol that I was consuming\n\non the road and, just the stress of traveling and the strain caused me to go\n\ninto this depression. I couldn't--when I go into these depressions, it's\n\ninsane. Like, people, `I get depressed sometimes, too,' but it's a different\n\nkind of thing, and anyone who suffered from this will know what I'm talking\n\nabout.\n\nIt like, it just stays on you like a wet blanket. You physically can't move,\n\nyou're so out of it. You can't function, you can't shave, and like I went\n\nthrough one of these episodes, you know, last year, and I couldn't make it to\n\nthe show for four days. Now, it was way more amplified publicly at this point\n\nbecause I'm more famous now, and the Stern show is, obviously, a high-profile\n\nthing. And in the context of the show, he just made a joke about it, you\n\nknow. It's just, it's a tragic thing, I guess, but, you know, it's a comedy\n\nshow and a lot of the material's dark and it's based on our real life, so when\n\nI got back after missing four days, I got teased and reamed and everything\n\nelse by the callers, by him, and I never stopped it. I just took it. Because\n\nif you take it, you're able to also dish it out. And I wanted to prove to\n\nmyself I had a thick, thick skin and could deal with it. So I dealt with it,\n\nand after a few days it went away.\n\nIf I had told him, `Look, this is a serious issue and we shouldn't really\n\nhandle it this way on the air,' believe me, he would respect that; that's how\n\nhe is. But I never did that. I said, `To hell with it, I'm going to go in\n\nand fess up to what happened and just deal with it,' and that's what I did,\n\nand eventually it went away, you know?\n\nGROSS: Well, getting back to that similarity between being on the show and\n\nbeing on the therapy, although you're not in therapy, when you go through a\n\nreally bad depression like that and then you come on the show...\n\nMr. LANGE: Right.\n\nGROSS: ...and everybody's kind of ribbing you for it, and you're talking\n\nabout it and they're talking about it and the callers are talking about it...\n\nMr. LANGE: Yeah. Yeah.\n\nGROSS: ...what does--does it help or hurt, in terms of your own emotional\n\ninner life?\n\nMr. LANGE: I don't know. You see, I created a sort of a monster on the show\n\nwith this bit that I do where I go like this with--if somebody's complaining\n\nabout something, I'll say, `Wanh!' I do this thing with, you know, the whining\n\n`Wanh' thing, and that became a bit that I did for like a year on the show.\n\nAnd then, of course, as soon as I got back, the first caller hits me with,\n\n`Wanh, I'm depressed, wanh. Wanh, I got to make a movie and I'm stressed out!\n\nWanh! So, and I--I mean I have created--God forbid, if I ever died, some of\n\nthese crazy fans would show up to my wake and go up to my mother and go,\n\n`Wanh! My fat son died! Wanh!' I mean, they're--I mean, they're that nuts.\n\nSo, look, I sat there and I said to myself, `I dish it out and I got to take\n\nthis.' And I'm doing OK now. Maybe it helped, but I don't know. I've never\n\nreally figured out, in a really deep sort of thorough way what causes that in\n\nmy head. I mean, obviously, therapy would...\n\nGROSS: I was going to point that out.\n\nMr. LANGE: Therapy would help that. But I'm still reluctant to go, and the\n\nonly therapy I get is on national radio, so--maybe I'm a human experiment.\n\nWe'll see if it's working or not.\n\nGROSS: Do you ever want to say to your fans, when you're really depressed or\n\nunhappy, if like you meet a fan on the street or something, like, `This is not\n\nfunny right now, just, like, go away'?\n\nMr. LANGE: Yeah, there's times I want to, but again, radio fame is such a\n\ndifferent kind of fame than anything else. I've been lucky enough to have\n\nsuccess in a lot of different areas, like movies and television. But when\n\nyou're yourself on the radio, being honest, people really feel, when they see\n\nyou, that you're their friend. You know, `This is the guy that I drive to\n\nwork with every morning, and who tells me all these crazy stories about\n\nhimself.'\n\nGROSS: Mm-hmm.\n\nMr. LANGE: And I love that relationship. I love it. I think it's so\n\nspecial. So I treat them like a friend. If they come up to me on the street\n\nand I'm in a little bit of a bad mood, I'll suck it up and try to be nice and\n\nfriendly and say hi the same way I would a friend. And it's weird. They know\n\nabout my life, and they ask, and a lot of times, again, they're right on the\n\nmoney. They're very perceptive. And that's touching to me. It's very, it's\n\na unique thing. So there's times where I feel like saying something but I\n\ndon't.\n\nGROSS: Artie Lange will be back in the second half of the show. He's a cast\n\nmember of the \"Howard Stern Show\" and the star of the new movie \"Beer League.\"\n\nI'm Terry Gross and this is FRESH AIR.\n\n(Announcements)\n\n(Soundbite of from \"Howard Stern Show\")\n\nMr. LANGE: (Singing) Yeah, you...\n\nMr. HOWARD STERN: Come on, Artie!\n\nMr. LANGE: (Singing) ...shook me all night long!\n\n(End soundbite)\n\nGROSS: That's Artie Lange showing off one of his lesser talents. Coming up,\n\nwe talk more about his life on and off \"Howard Stern Show.\" And Maureen\n\nCorrigan reviews Alice McDermott's new novel.\n\n(Announcements)\n\nGROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross, back with Artie Lange. He's a\n\ncomic and actor, best known as a cast member of the \"Howard Stern Show.\" He\n\nco-wrote and stars in the new movie comedy \"Beer League.\" Let's pick up where\n\nwe left off.\n\nYou know how you were saying that you fear, like, if you were--if you died,\n\nsomeone--a fan would come to your funeral and say to your mother, `Wanh! My\n\nfat son died!' You know...\n\nMr. LANGE: Right, right.\n\nGROSS: So there's actually a Web site, I know you know about this, it's\n\ncalled Artie Lange death watch.\n\nMr. LANGE: Yes.\n\nGROSS: And it's headlined, \"We are very concerned about the health and\n\nwell-being of comedian, actor, and `Howard Stern Show' regular Artie Lange.\n\nThis site will be dedicated to monitoring changes in Artie's health, eating\n\nhabits, and general sloth.\" And the Web site explains that they love you.\n\nMr. LANGE: Right.\n\nGROSS: They're not wishing you ill, they're just monitoring you.\n\nMr. LANGE: They love me, yeah.\n\nGROSS: So what's your reaction to seeing that? Is it creepy?\n\nMr. LANGE: Yeah, it's a little creepy. It's a little bit of a wake-up call,\n\ntoo. My mother hates it. You know, we're living in a time where, you know,\n\nthis Google thing, you meet somebody out at a bar and they immediately google\n\nyour name. And, with me, I'm thinking, like, now I might be going into the\n\nsingle life again, if I meet a girl at a bar doesn't really know who I am and\n\ngoogles my name, one of the first things she's going to see is a Web site\n\npredicting my early death, the other one with a pool about when I'll die. And\n\nthat's got to freak a person out. It would freak me out. It--actually, I got\n\nlife insurance cancelled because of that Web site.\n\nGROSS: No, really?\n\nMr. LANGE: Yeah, absolutely. The guy, the insurance agent, you know, did a\n\nsearch for me on the Internet and saw--that's one of several Web sites that\n\nactually...\n\nGROSS: Oh, gosh.\n\nMr. LANGE: ...predict maybe an early death for me. I outlived them. I\n\nthink the earliest they had me going was 36 when I started on the show, so I'm\n\n38 now. But what they'll do is, like, they'll come to my stand-up show and\n\ncount the drinks I had and try to see what I ate, like they'll--and like\n\nthey'll put it on the Web site. They'll say, `Look, you know, Artie had, you\n\nknow, 10 jack-and-waters at the show the other night. He had two chicken\n\nParmesan sandwiches and so I think, you know, this week he really put a couple\n\nof nails in the coffin.' They'll listen to the show and hear what I ate that\n\nmorning. Sometimes Howard'll make me go over what I ate; my menu's a big\n\nfeature on the show. And they'll list it on that Web site. They'll update\n\nit, day to day, what I ate, which is very creepy.\n\nAnd, you know, what am I--we're living in the age of the Internet. Again, I\n\njust got to deal with it. If it really bugged me, I guess I would get into\n\nanother profession, but I don't know. I guess I'm fine with it.\n\nGROSS: Well, my theory is, when you meet women who know you that there's,\n\nlike, two main categories...\n\nMr. LANGE: Right.\n\nGROSS: ...one would be, `You're a pig, I hate you,' and the other would be,\n\n`You're really funny, I love you and I'm going to heal you, I'm going to\n\nchange you.'\n\nMr. LANGE: Yes.\n\nGROSS: `No other woman could, but I will.'\n\nMr. LANGE: Right, I think I'm definitely, I'm a project for some women.\n\nAnd, yeah, there's a lot of women out there who feel like it's a challenge,\n\nalmost, and they almost get that motherly thing where, `I can take care of\n\nthis guy and change him' and I don't know. I thought I met that woman four\n\nyears ago, but I screwed that up, I guess.\n\nIt would be...\n\nGROSS: You're going through a break-up live on the air.\n\nMr. LANGE: Yes. Yes, I know. And it's very--it does, like, actually, the\n\nlast couple of days, it was really made sort of official that this is, it\n\nlooks like it's not going to--not going to continue. And I'm very sad.\n\nDefinitely hurting inside about it. And at the same time, you got to be funny\n\nfor five hours. But it's--what makes me really depressed about it is I'm\n\nrealizing that, like, if I was a better man, I think we would still be\n\ntogether, maybe even married now. And I also genuinely wish her happiness.\n\nLike, I don't think I could ever truly be happy knowing Dana was sad. So I\n\nreally do love her, but I also realize that I would just be wrong for her.\n\nI'm not--I don't think I'm capable of changing the way she would need me to\n\nchange. And that's depressing, you know?\n\nGROSS: My guest is Artie Lange. He's a regular on \"Howard Stern Show.\" He's\n\na comic and actor, and he has a new movie that he stars in and co-wrote and\n\nit's called \"Beer League.\"\n\nWhat are the preparations like for the show?\n\nMr. LANGE: The lack of preparation, early in the morning. I always thought\n\nthat, you know, Howard got there at like a quarter to 5 and got bits together\n\nand, you know, every newspaper article he wanted to talk about was out. And\n\nhe gets a lot of that done at home through the use of a computer now with\n\neverybody. And like the first time I showed up, I got there at 20 to 6, and\n\nI'm sitting there, I wanted to make sure I'm early, I'm like, `Where's Howard?\n\nWhere's Howard?' He walked in at, like, three minutes to 6, said hi to me.\n\nGary went over a couple of minor things with him, and he went right on the\n\nair. So I got used to that.\n\nThe preparation for me is, I mean, I have the dream job. I have no\n\npreparation. Like, all my work is what you hear me say on the air. I'll try\n\nto read the New York Post, page six, because that's probably the part of a\n\nnewspaper that he'll refer to the most, so I'll try to get familiar with that\n\nreal quick in the morning over a cup of coffee. And then, I--and I like it\n\nthis way, because it sounds more conversational--I genuinely have no idea what\n\nhe's going to bring up. And my job is just to roll with the punches, whatever\n\nthe subject is, and try to add humor to it. And it's been working so far. I\n\nlike the spontaneity. I don't like to be overprepared for anything.\n\nGROSS: Let me ask you something about the show that, I just want your\n\nimpression on this. Sometimes I think that some of the more, like, homophobic\n\nhumor on the show...\n\nMr. LANGE: Mm-hmm.\n\nGROSS: ...and misogynist humor on the show, it's like when you're doing it on\n\nthe show, I can see you guys are really funny. And even when things rub me\n\nthe wrong way...\n\nMr. LANGE: Right.\n\nGROSS: ...you're pros, you're good at what you do. You're all brilliant at\n\nwhat you do. But then I wonder about the people listening who, you know, if\n\nthey think like, `Hey, it's really cool to be homophobic' or `It's like really\n\ncool to just have girls who are strippers and to think of all girls as\n\nstrippers.' Do you worry about that at all?\n\nMr. LANGE: Yes, to a certain extent. I'd be lying if I said I don't worry\n\nabout it. But to me, the people you're describing are dumb people, you know.\n\nThe \"Howard Stern Show\" is a big hit because it entertains dumb and smart\n\npeople at the same time for the different reasons. And there's a couple shows\n\nlike that. \"The Simpsons\" is another one. Smart people and stupid people\n\nlove \"The Simpsons\" for totally different reasons. That's why it's a big hit.\n\nEverybody's either smart or stupid. So a lot of people watch it.\n\nGROSS: Yeah.\n\nMr. LANGE: Our show, smart people and stupid people love it for different\n\nreasons. And early on in my career, I sort of just made a commitment to\n\nmyself, I refuse to cater to stupid people. What we do on the air is just try\n\nto be funny and hope that the smart people listen more than the dumb people.\n\nGROSS: How do you feel about the part of the show where people become\n\nregulars because of a physical deformity, like a mental problem.\n\nMr. LANGE: Right.\n\nGROSS: You're comfortable with that part?\n\nMr. LANGE: You know, again, there's times where it's heartbreaking to see\n\nsome of the people come in and get on the air and speak about their lives.\n\nAnd this is a very difficult subject, because the one argument is, you're\n\ngiving some sort of wonderful gift to these people that they're becoming sort\n\nof mini-celebrities, like Beetlejuice is an example...\n\nGROSS: Right.\n\nMr. LANGE: ...of a guy. He's a retarded black midget who, you know, drinks\n\nall the time and he's got bad teeth and he--I mean, the guy's a rock star. He\n\nmakes over six figures a year doing appearances because the show made him\n\nfamous. And I really think he's having a good time with it. You know, I\n\nreally--he seems happy, he seems to like the attention and all the partying\n\nand everything, whereas without that, his life would be, you know, lonely and\n\npathetic and everything.\n\nNow that's me sort of justifying what we do, you know, that's the positive\n\nargument. He could go home and have really, really dark, dark times thinking\n\nabout, `Oh, they're laughing at me and I'm being exploited,' and, you know, he\n\ngets paid a lot of money and there's people that handle him. They seem to be\n\ngood, honest people, and I hope that they take care of him. But look, we\n\ndon't see him 24 hours a day. He seems to be fine with it. But if I knew\n\nthat one of these people that comes on our show all the time's really hurting\n\nabout it and felt exploited and was sad, to be honest with you, that would\n\nreally make me upset. And I would question having them on again, if that were\n\nthe case. I genuinely think that the people that come on our show enjoy it,\n\nenjoy the attention, and I think it enriches their lives that would've been,\n\nyou know, really, really, maybe boring, mundane, and, you know, for lack of a\n\nbetter word, horrible without all this love. They get a lot of love.\n\nYou know, Beetlejuice, again, is a guy who was born with this deformity, but\n\nwhen he walks onstage, he gets all that affection. They love him. It's like\n\nElvis. And I genuinely think he digs it. If I thought he didn't, it would\n\nbug me. It really would. And I'd have to, like, I'd have to be honest about\n\nthat. I go, `look, this kid's miserable doing this. We shouldn't, you know,\n\nhave him on anymore.'\n\nGROSS: My guest is Artie Lange. We'll talk more after a break. This is\n\nFRESH AIR.\n\n(Announcements)\n\nGROSS: My guest is Artie Lange. He's a cast member of the \"Howard Stern\n\nShow\" and he co-wrote and stars in the new movie \"Beer League.\" If you're just\n\njoining us, my guest is Artie Lange. He's a regular on the \"Howard Stern\n\nShow.\" He's a comic and actor and he's co-written and stars in a new movie\n\ncalled \"Beer League.\"\n\nWhen you were--I forget what year it was, but your father was a contractor and\n\nhe had an accident...\n\nMr. LANGE: He installed television antennas, yeah.\n\nGROSS: He had an accident, he fell off the roof.\n\nMr. LANGE: Yes.\n\nGROSS: And be--you know, had quadriplegia after that.\n\nMr. LANGE: Right.\n\nGROSS: How did that change your life?\n\nMr. LANGE: Oh, God. Well, he--I mean, he was my best friend. It was the\n\nquintessential father/son sort of American relationship. We played baseball\n\ntogether and he, you know, he was everything to me and I sort of looked at him\n\nlike Superman. I mean, almost literally. I would go to him to work, and I\n\nwould go to work with him, and he would be on the roof and I thought he could\n\nfly when I was, like, seven years old. Literally. And he fell a week after\n\nmy 18th birthday, and it was like `Here's adulthood.' Like throwing cold water\n\nin your face.\n\nAnd it changed my life in the sense that, I was a horrible student, I was\n\nnever going to go to college. I just used that as an extra reason not to go.\n\nBut I was definitely a lost soul. I knew I wanted to be a comedian, but that\n\nseemed like a huge mountain. How was I going to make that happen? And when\n\nhe fell and we went broke, my mother, you know, he--he fell off a ladder that\n\nhe had stolen and he wasn't even using it properly, and he fell off a house\n\nthat had no homeowner's insurance, so there's always somebody to sue usually,\n\nso at least you get a settlement. There was nobody to sue.\n\nSo we, you know, had no money saved anyway, and there were doctor bills and my\n\nmother had to go on welfare. I remember driving my mother to the welfare\n\noffice at 18, and she was a very proud Italian woman and she hated going\n\nthrough that. And my father was sitting there, he couldn't move, and I used\n\nit as an excuse to just go into an insane downward spiral. I mean, every\n\nself-destructive thing you can imagine. Drinking, drugs, gambling, you know,\n\novereating, bar fights--getting into fights with guys I knew could kick my\n\nass, bouncers--just because I just wanted to just get in my own dark world and\n\njust, you know, sort of wallow in it and just escape. And that was my excuse,\n\nthat was my `wanh,' you know. It was, `My old man's a quadriplegic, so I\n\ndeserve to get drunk.' And that's when all my addictions really kicked in.\n\nSo before he fell, I really didn't have those issues. I might've been on the\n\nroad to them. After he fell, they all kicked in and I just went--it was the\n\nfour years that he lived after the accident, was--it's all a blur to me. I\n\ncan barely remember it.\n\nGROSS: Did you take any responsibility for taking care of him?\n\nMr. LANGE: Well, yeah. What happened was, because we couldn't afford\n\n24-hour nurses, Medicaid allowed for a nurse eight hours a day, and my mother\n\ngot a secretarial job. So he had to be turned every could of hours, otherwise\n\nhe'd get bad bedsores. So if I was home, hungover or something, I would turn\n\nhim and talk to him.\n\nAnd we had these crazy just like one-on-one conversations when my mother was\n\nat her job as a secretary, my sister was bartending to put herself through\n\ncollege and it was just me and him in the house and he's like looking at me\n\nlike `How did I do this? What happened?' And it was just really dark,\n\ndepressing conversations. And more than once he asked me to kill him, and\n\nthat had to be, like, such a hard, you know, task, as son. He would even say\n\nstuff like, you know, he had all these crazy pills, painkillers, which I stole\n\nevery once in a while to get high. And he would say, `Look, just leave them\n\non the table, I'll somehow get them in my mouth, you know, you don't have to\n\nshoot me in the head or anything.' And that's literally what the conversations\n\nwere like for four years.\n\nAnd I just stayed self-medicated and I would try to turn him when my mother\n\ncouldn't. And then I would go out at night and get drunk or whatever, and my\n\nmother would literally have to set her alarm for every two hours to get up and\n\nturn him, and then get up and go to work all day. So I took over some of his\n\naccounts, installing antennas, climbing roofs, just because we needed the\n\nmoney so desperately. My mother hated that. But I was capable of doing it, I\n\nhad learned how to do it through him. So I started installing antennas in the\n\nfirst couple of years after he fell, just to get some immediate money. But of\n\ncourse my mother was freaked out. Now I'm climbing a roof, you know.\n\nGROSS: Right, right, right.\n\nMr. LANGE: So that's how I tried to help, by doing some work. But I was\n\nbasically, in those four years, no help at all. That's probably why I'm so\n\nguilty now and I try to--I lavish my mother with everything I possibly can,\n\nyou know.\n\nGROSS: Your father died four years after the accident.\n\nMr. LANGE: Yeah.\n\nGROSS: And it was after that that you started trying out comedy?\n\nMr. LANGE: Yeah, the first time I ever tried it, I was 19 years old.\n\nGROSS: So that's when he was still alive, then?\n\nMr. LANGE: Yes, July 12th, 1987. I'll never forget that day, because it was\n\nthe first--I had been saying to myself `I got to try this' and I officially,\n\ngot up one day, I read in the paper that the old Improv on 9th Avenue and 44th\n\nStreet was having a lottery. Like, 200 people show up, they put 10 pieces of\n\npaper--they put a bunch of pieces of paper in a hat. If you get a piece of\n\npaper that has a number on it, that's your number that night. So, first try,\n\nsure enough, on my first time going--people would go constantly and never get\n\na number and have to come back. My first try, I get the number 10. I was\n\n10th in a line-up of 12 guys. I had to go back that night. And I had just\n\ntold my mother and father that I was going to try to do it. I took my\n\nfather's handicap van into New York, I parked it on 9th Avenue. I was afraid\n\nit was going to get towed. I went into Milford Plaza and tried out five\n\nminutes of stuff that I had prepared in my head and I went up and bombed\n\nmiserably.\n\nBut I was proud of myself that I actually did it, you know. So I went home\n\nand told them about it, but I had bombed so bad it intimidated me and I didn't\n\ntry it again for another four years, until after he died. So I tried it once\n\nwhile he was still alive and it was a bad experience. Then I went back into\n\nthe booze, wallowing, I was like, `God, this dream of mine didn't work out.\n\nNow what am I going to do?' I did it once and I thought I just would always\n\nsuck, when everybody sucks the first time.\n\nAnd it took him dying for me to really go, `I'm going to try this again. I'll\n\ngive it one more shot.' So, almost in honor of his memory, `I'm going to give\n\nit another shot.' And it felt better that time. And at a lack of anything\n\nelse to do, I just kept going back.\n\nGROSS: Do you think your mother's surprised at how you turned out? I mean,\n\nhow successful you are.\n\nMr. LANGE: I think my mother, in a lot of ways, is surprised I'm alive, much\n\nless successful. She always had confidence in me. She was never this\n\nold-fashioned sort of Italian mother, who would say, `No, that's too much of a\n\nrisk; get some sort of steady work.' Because I worked as--my friend got me a\n\njob as a longshoreman right after my father had passed away, unloading ships\n\nat the port in Newark. And that's a great job if you didn't go to college.\n\nYou can make, you know, 80 grand a year with overtime. And I quit. I saved\n\nup a few grand and I quit to try comedy. Now, a lot of mothers would've\n\nwent--especially old-school Italian mothers--be like, `Don't quit this job!\n\nIt's such a great job!' She was never like that. She was like, `This is your\n\ndream. I believe in you. Go try it.' So I think she always knew I had it in\n\nme, but the level of success I've had, maybe she didn't, you know, sort of\n\npredict that, because I've been very luck, you know.\n\nGROSS: Well, Artie, it's been great to talk with you. Thanks so much.\n\nMr. LANGE: Thanks. I hope this was all right. I feel like--in this\n\natmosphere, you really do, you even pour your heart out more than on Stern,\n\nbecause there's just two people. It's like a one-on-one. It really does feel\n\nlike a shrink session. But this was...\n\nGROSS: Is that a good thing or a bad thing?\n\nMr. LANGE: So this--no, it's good.\n\nGROSS: So you going to go into therapy now?\n\nMr. LANGE: Maybe. Maybe I'll just keep coming here every day. We can do\n\nthis. Thank you very much, Terry. This was...\n\nGROSS: Thank you very much.\n\nMr. LANGE: ...a lot of fun. Thank you.\n\nGROSS: Artie Lange is a cast member of the \"Howard Stern Show.\" He co-wrote\n\nand stars in the new movie \"Beer League.\"\n\nComing up, Maureen Corrigan reviews Alice McDermott's new novel. This is\n\nFRESH AIR.\n\n(Announcements)\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *\n\nReview: Maureen Corrigan on the new book \"After This\" by Alice\n\nMcDermott\n\nTERRY GROSS, host:\n\nWriter Alice McDermott won the National Book Award in 1998 for her novel\n\n\"Charming Billy.\" McDermott has just brought a new novel called \"After This,\"\n\nand book critic Maureen Corrigan says that it's a stunner.\n\nMAUREEN CORRIGAN reporting:\n\nCritics have genuflected before Alice McDermott by likening her to James\n\nJoyce. Both writers take up Irish-Catholics as their subjects, even if\n\nMcDermott's are a generation or two removed from the old sod. And both\n\nwriters are poets who share a particular genius for evoking mood and worldview\n\nin a few quick strokes.\n\nApt as that comparison is, however, there are ones closer to home that make\n\njust as much sense--to American masters of people and place, like William\n\nFaulkner and Philip Roth. McDermott's latest novel, called \"After This,\"\n\nparticularly brings to mind an Irish-Catholic version of Roth's epic of the\n\n1960s, \"American Pastoral\"--the self-deprecating humor, the guilt, the earnest\n\nstruggle to stake out their peaceful slice of suburbia on the edges of a\n\nroiling New York City. Roth's New Jersey Jews and McDermott's Long Island\n\nIrish-Catholics have a lot in common.\n\nBut enough with comparisons to the big boys of literature, for in \"After\n\nThis,\" an astonishing novel, McDermott takes off the ladylike white gloves and\n\ndemonstrates that she's no longer acting like a nice, Irish-Catholic girl\n\nwho's going to be flattered by inclusion with the towering likes of Joyce,\n\nFaulkner, or Roth. Instead, she's giving these guys a real run for their\n\nmoney. The difference between \"After This\" and McDermott's earlier books is\n\nnot a matter of literary quality--McDermott has always been a breathtaking,\n\nlyrical writer--but of ambition.\n\nIn this novel, McDermott tackles recent American history and indirectly gives\n\npronouncements on sweeping social changes that rip through even small lives.\n\nThe small lives under scrutiny here are those of the Keane family, John and\n\nMary and their four children, who live in a tightly-knit Catholic neighborhood\n\non Long Island. Without melodrama, McDermott depicts the ruptures in the\n\nKeane's coherent lives caused first by the memories of the Depression and\n\nWorld War II, and then in dizzying succession, Vatican Council II, the Vietnam\n\nWar, the second women's movement, and the legalization of abortion, urban\n\ndecay, and even globalization.\n\nMcDermott doesn't plod through these events. Rather, she invokes them in\n\nchapters that could almost stand as individual short stories because of their\n\nintensity and quick, dramatic turns. With wry humor, McDermott plants a\n\nmetaphor for the ultimate transformation these historical events and social\n\nchanges will wreak on the Keane family. Midway through the book, she\n\ndescribes a fund-raising effort to build a new church for St. Gabriel's\n\nParish. Replacing the dark, incense-filled church will be a futuristic\n\nstructure, informed by the democratic impulses of Vatican II, a church in the\n\nround like a spaceship. For better and for worse, that's what the '60s do to\n\nthe Keane family and their friends: loosen the ties to their faith-bound\n\nlives, send them hurtling, weightless, into space.\n\nWhat keeps us readers tethered to the story is McDermott's great gift for\n\nevoking ordinary working people, whose reticent demeanors cloak\n\nthoughtful--and sometimes tortured--inner lives. Mary Keane, a single woman\n\nof 30 when the novel begins a few years after World War II, has a girlfriend\n\nin her office typing pool named Pauline. Pauline is fated to be the spinster\n\nhonorary aunt to the family Mary goes on to have. And in a phrase, McDermott\n\ncaptures a whole personality type, when she remarks about Pauline that \"she\n\nwas self-effacing, but that she also wanted the attention such generous\n\nself-effacement surely earned her.\"\n\nSimilarly, McDermott summons up a lost world of manners when she depicts how\n\nMary, gasping in the throes of premature childbirth on her living room couch,\n\nturns her head to greet an unexpected visitor stepping through the front door.\n\n\"It was simply what you did,\" writes McDermott. \"You made conversation in\n\nelevators, complimented small children in strollers, looked up from your\n\nmagazine to greet the stranger who took the seat beside you on a bus. You\n\nsaid with simple friendliness, `That's a lovely hat,' or, `Isn't it cold?'\n\nbecause it was another way of saying, `Here we are, all of us, more or less in\n\nthe same boat.' It was the habit of friendliness, a lifetime of it.\"\n\nI wish I could quote this whole novel, to have the pleasure of immediately\n\nrereading it again, especially to catch the foreshadowing remarks and images I\n\nsurely missed the first time around. \"After This\" begins with a doozy of such\n\na foreshadowing scene: the 30-year-old Mary Keane in church on her lunch\n\nhour, despairing of finding a husband, praying to God to at least grant her\n\ncontentment. That seems at first like a humble prayer a good Catholic would\n\nutter, but by the end of this splendid novel about the world turned upside\n\ndown, it seems like way too much to ever have asked for.\n\nGROSS: Maureen Corrigan teaches literature at Georgetown University. She\n\nreviewed \"After This\" by Alice McDermott.\n\n(Credits)"
