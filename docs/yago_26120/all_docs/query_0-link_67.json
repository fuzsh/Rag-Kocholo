This figure is a stark contrast to the peak of his career, where he boasted a net worth of $6 million. Lange’s financial journey has been a rollercoaster, marked by highs of success and lows of personal struggles.\n\nComparatively, Jackie Martling, a fellow comedian and former colleague on The Howard Stern Show, has a net worth of $5 million. Andrew Dice Clay, another contemporary, outstrips both with a net worth of $10 million.\n\nThese comparisons highlight the impact of personal challenges on a celebrity’s financial status.

In 1997, he co-starred in the comedy film Dirty Work alongside Norm Macdonald, which opened up more acting opportunities for him. This period also marked his involvement in The Norm Show, where he played a recurring role.\n\nDespite these successes, Lange’s personal demons continued to shadow his professional achievements.\n\nThe Howard Stern Show Era\n\nIn 2001, Lange’s career trajectory took another major leap when he joined The Howard Stern Show. His tenure on the show not only amplified his fame but also enriched his experience in the entertainment industry.\n\nDuring this period, Lange released two comedy albums and ventured into filmmaking with Artie Lange’s Beer League in 2006. He also authored the book Too Fat to Fish in 2008, which became a bestseller.\n\nTurbulent Times and Recovery\n\nDespite his professional success, Lange’s personal life was fraught with challenges. His struggle with substance abuse led to a suicide attempt in 2010, after which he underwent rehabilitation.\n\nPost-recovery, he hosted The Nick & Artie Show with Nick Di Paolo from 2011 to 2013 and The Artie Lange Show until 2014. During this time, he released his second book, Crash and Burn.\n\nRecent Endeavors\n\nFrom 2015 to 2017, Lange hosted The Artie Quitter Podcast and took on a recurring role in the HBO series Crashing. He also co-hosted The Artie and Anthony Show with Anthony Cumia until 2018.\n\nThat year, he released his third book, Wanna Bet? and subsequently took a hiatus from his career following a series of arrests and drug rehabilitation.\n\nAfter a period of sobriety, Lange resumed stand-up and launched Artie Lange’s Halfway House podcast before entering another hiatus in February 2022.\n\nPersonal life\n\nFrom 2002 to 2006, he was in a relationship with Dana Cironi. In 2009, Lange’s personal life took a significant turn when he met Adrienne Ockrymiek at a tanning salon. This encounter led to a deeper relationship, and the couple eventually got engaged.
