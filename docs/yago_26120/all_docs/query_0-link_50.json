        "text": "Actor, comic, and Howard Stern Show cast member Artie Lange stars in the film Artie Lange's Beer League, which makes its network TV premiere tonight on Comedy Central.\n\nLange was a regular on the Fox network's sketch-comedy show Mad TV, and he's appeared in a number of comedy films, including Old School and Elf.\n\nLange's personal life — namely his binge drinking and eating — is often fodder for Howard Stern and the rest of the cast on the daily Sirius Radio program. He'll host Comedy Central's Friday Night Stand-Up this evening, just before the Beer League premiere.\n\nThis interview first aired on Sept. 14, 2006."
