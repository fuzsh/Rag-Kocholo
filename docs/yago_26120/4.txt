Quotes from the Film

Johnny Trinno: [giving the toast at Maz's wedding] So to recap, throughout it all, there's been a lot of laughter, and a few tears. But in the end the clouds parted, and the good Lord himself decided it was meant to be. And that's how I finished the regular season batting .706.

+++

Dirt: Hey! I don't wanna see any a you Italians drinking from my water bottle! Damned wops!

+++

Johnny Trinno: It's unfair, it's like pitching to a healthy Lou Gehrig.

+++

Gina: Okay, you know what? I'm not being a bitch here. You're missing Marie's recital tonight, and I said we could wait 'til after the softball season to go on our honeymoon. I even let you pick your scumbag friend Artie as best man!

Maz: Sweetheart, listen, huh? It's the first game of the season. I just don't wanna be late, alright? I'm with you on the cakes, I'll look at 'em later.

Gina: You know, I was gonna surprise you by making your little plastic man on the cake a Derek Jeter action figure. But now? No. I'm making you one of those Puerto Ricans from the fucking Mets!

Maz: Don't even joke like that, Gina!

+++

Maz: I'll have an egg-white omelet made with very little oil, dry wheat toast, and grapefruit juice.

Johnny Trinno: Oh my god, that's the gayest order I've ever heard.

Artie DeVanzo: You know, in Massachusetts, that order could legally marry a dude.

Maz: Alright, here it comes.

Johnny Trinno: You know, just placing an order like that would get you kicked out of the army.

Artie DeVanzo: You know, if you put a construction helmet on that order, it could join the Village People.

Rhonda: Would you guys knock it off so I can do my job?

Maz: Thank you.

Rhonda: Alright, Maz, that's an egg-white omelet, dry wheat toast, grapefruit juice.

Maz: That's right.

Rhonda: Do you want a side order of cock with that?

+++

Linda Salvo: I'm so embarrassed right now.

Artie DeVanzo: You're embarrassed? I just got cock-blocked by my mom!

+++

Dirt: You look like a bunch of Monkeys trying fuck a football!

+++

Artie DeVanzo: [imitating Yankees PA Announcer Bob Sheppard] Your attention please, now pitching for Mangenelli: Number 1, Needle Dick,

[Artie's team laughs]

Artie DeVanzo: Number 1

Dennis Mangenelli: Yeah, all right!

Artie DeVanzo: Needle Dick.

Dirt: You're a fat fucking disgrace!

+++

Maz: [responding to Artie about un-inviting Mangenelli to the wedding] He's Gina's cousin, he's going to be there, and don't start any trouble.

Artie DeVanzo: Hey, I'm not one to start trouble.

Johnny Trinno: Oh my God you fat fuckin' liar.

+++

Maz: Alright, Dirt. Just throw it in there, baby. Come on!

Artie DeVanzo: [punches glove] Whatta you say now Dirt, you character.

+++

Artie DeVanzo: If you put a construction hat on that order, it could be one of the village people.

+++

Alfonse: Check it out, my new italiano mit.

Maz: That's cool, Alfonse.

Johnny Trinno: How much of a guido could you possibly be?

+++

Artie DeVanzo: Ohh! Alright, listen up. Anybody that doesn't do a pregame shot with me is a fuckin' pussy.

Dennis Mangenelli: Jerk off!

Artie DeVanzo: Hey, did this jerk off just call me a jerk off?

+++

Johnny Trinno: [speaking in an announcer-type voice] Now coming to bat is Artie DeVanzo. Last season was a fine one for DeVanzo, we all know that. He batted 420 with 45 RBIs. He enters today's game with a Blood Alcohol Content of .16. If you kids scoring at home, that is an impressive *twice* the legal limit.

+++

Artie DeVanzo: Come on let's get this guy! Let's get this punk! He's nothin'! He's a loser! He's an asshole! A cock sucker! He's a total piece a shit!

Dennis Mangenelli: You shut up fatso!

Artie DeVanzo: Hey, watch the name-calling!
