        "text": "(Linked Also: Jennifer Worth)\n\nJennifer Annabelle \"Jenny\" Worth (née Lee) was a midwife at Nonnatus House (and the principal character of the show) from Series 1-3. The character departs at the conclusion of Series 3 after the death of boyfriend Alec Jesmond, nursing her friend Chummy’s dying mother, and meeting future husband Philip Worth.\n\nAppearance[]\n\nBased on the real Jenny Lee, the character is medium height and slender. Jenny has shoulder-length hair, maintained in a \"bob\" style. She has arched eyebrows, the fashion of the time, and large lips.\n\nPersonality[]\n\nNurse Lee is an excellent professional, although she had her restrains at the beginning to get use to the Poplar way of living, she likes to get involved with the patients and admire the Mothers and Nuns beyond words, however she has a soft spot for the older people and as she describes, her passion is to help them until their last moments. She is heartbroken for a forbidden relationship and since then struggles to open up, even with very old friendships like Jimmy, whom she ended up pushing away because of it. Jenny Lee is a loyal friend, and every now and then she allows her self to break some rules, like trespassing and break into a mansions pool or allowing her friend Jimmy to sleep at Nonnatus House.\n\nBiography[]\n\nJenny is introduced as the main protagonist for seasons 1-3. We initially see Jenny arrive at Nonnatus House as a young midwife ready to take on Poplar's challenges. As the series progresses, Jenny finds herself tackling different difficult issues both in midwifery and nursing.\n\nJenny trained and worked as a nurse before working as a midwife at Nonnatus House. She fell deeply in love with a married man and fled to Poplar to escape her feelings. In series 1, she still struggles with her feelings, but later reveals to Cynthia that there's a man that she loves but \"I can't have him.\"\n\nShe meets Jimmy again; he becomes a love interest for Jenny later in the series.\n\nJenny deals with many challenges; including trying to help a mother with an abusive husband; having to work at a short-staffed hospital with a surgeon on the highest of horses; and delivering a baby with spina bifida.\n\nAfter taking care of Chummy's dying mother, Jenny decides to change careers and work with those who are at the end of life. She announces that she will be leaving Nonnatus House and midwifery to work as a nurse at the Marie Curie Hampstead Hospital. It is around this time that she meets Philip Worth, her future husband, who accompanies her as she leaves Nonnatus House for the last time, Jenny and Philip then marry.\n\nRelationships[]\n\nFamily[]\n\nJenny mentions that her parents are proud of her, if not a little shocked that she chose to live in Poplar. They never make an appearance and are rarely mentioned, if at all.\n\nFriends[]\n\nJenny's friends include fellow midwives Trixie, Cynthia, Chummy, and Patsy, as well as colleagues Patrick Turner and Shelagh Turner, auxiliary nurse Jane Sutton and caretaker Fred. She also works with the Nuns of Nonnatus House, including Sister Evangelina, Sister Julienne, Sister Monica Joan, and Sister Winifred.\n\nLove Interests[]\n\nShe had a close friendship with her old friend and former love interest, Jimmy.\n\nShe had a relationship with Jimmy's friend, Alec Jesmond before he died after falling through an old staircase at his workplace.\n\nShe marries a Scottish man called Philip Worth. Philip was staying with his pregnant cousin Jeanette who was a patient of Jenny’s. He was an artist. They would leave Poplar together and marry. They have two daughters together, Susannah and Juliette. Philip suggests Jenny should write a memoir about her experiences.\n\nPatients[]\n\nSome of her patients include Mary and Pearl Winston. She has also nursed Joe Collet, Doris Aston, Monique Hyde and even her friend Jimmy when she was seconded. However the patient that shaped her the most was Lady Browne, Chummy's mother who inspired her to shift careers and work with the dying.\n\nTrivia[]\n\nJennifer Lee is based on Jennifer Worth, the author of the Call the Midwife memoirs.\n\nQuotes[]\n\n\"I must have been mad. I could have been an air hostess. I could have been a model. I could have moved to Paris, or been a concert pianist. I could have seen the world, been brave, followed my heart. But I didn't. I sidestepped love and set off for the East End of London because I thought it would be easier. Madness was the only explanation.\"\n\n- Mature Jenny ruminating on her decision to become a midwife.\n\nGallery[]\n\nReferences[]"
