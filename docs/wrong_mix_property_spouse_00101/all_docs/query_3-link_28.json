        "text": "published on 2021-07-28T19:45:20Z\n\nListen to this ODNB podcast to learn about the life of Jennie Lee, Baroness Lee of Asheridge, radical politician and Labour Party grandee(1904-1988). Jennie Lee was a Labour Member of Parliament and the youngest woman MP ever elected. For thirteen years she marked time, in politics but out of parliament, lecturing, broadcasting, dabbling in the law, campaigning for international revolutionary socialism, writing for the \"\"New Leader\"\", helping Nye Bevan, Stafford Cripps, William Mellor, and the young Michael Foot to launch \"\"Tribune\"\" and the Unity campaign (which became the British expression of the Popular Front) in 1937 to fight fascism; until the Spanish Civil War and then the Second World War weaned her from the pacifism of the ILP and brought her back into mainstream Labour. This biography of Jennie Lee, written by Patricia Hollis, is taken from the âOxford Dictionary of National Biographyâ. Take a look at the ODNB Website to discover more about the people who shaped the history of the British Isles and beyond. #ODNBPodcast Image Credit: Â© Jorge Lewinski; collection National Portrait Gallery, London\n\nGenre\n\nLearning"
