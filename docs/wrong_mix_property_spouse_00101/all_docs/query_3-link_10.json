        "text": "Lee would become a prominent member of the ILP, often speaking at their events across Scotland. Her skills as an orator were remarkable and she was able to captivate an audience with ease. She was also a hit with the media due to her young age, good looks, and evident passion for politics. Lee was selected by the ILP to run as their candidate for North Lanark in the 1929 by-election. Then still herself unable to vote, her campaign drew a lot of attention and became a headline story. Lee won the election, becoming the youngest MP of her time at the age of just 24. She made a strong impression during her maiden speech, accusing Winston Churchill (then Chancellor of the Exchequer) of ‘cant, corruption, and incompetence’. Lee was also set apart from many of her fellow women MPs in her broad dismissal of feminism. Lee viewed the battle of the sexes as inferior to the concept of class struggle. Lee’s time in parliament was however, short-lived and she lost her seat in the 1931 election.\n\nIn the years before the Second World War, Lee turned to political journalism, and continued to lecture, broadcast, and campaign. She helped Nye Bevan (who she married in 1934), Stafford Cripps, William Mellor, and Michael Foot to launch Tribune and the Unity campaign, which sought to unite left-wing political forces in anti-fascism. During the war Lee served in the Ministry of Aircraft Production and as a political correspondent before being re-elected in 1945 as the Labour MP for Cannock.\n\nDuring Harold Wilson’s Government, Lee became the Minister for the Arts in 1964. During this time she was able to obtain further funds for the arts, strengthen the film industry and abolish theatre censorship. Her 1965 white paper, A Policy for the Arts: the First Steps, called for arts to be accessible, and widely available, recognising their life-enhancing significance. Lee was also a driving force in establishing the Open University, battling significant opposition from all sides to achieve a genuinely inclusive, accessible, and high quality distance learning institution. Harold Wilson subsequently acknowledged the OU as his government’s greatest achievement.\n\nIn 1966 Lee became a member of the Privy Council, and was elected Chairman of the Labour Party the following year. Lee was unseated in the 1970 election, but was given a peerage, becoming Baroness Lee of Asheridge. Baroness Lee spent her last years writing, publishing two books before her death on 16 November 1988 in London."
