        "text": "“It was a blast,” John Enos III, THE YOUNG AND THE RESTLESS’ former Bobby, says of his July wedding to longtime girlfriend Jennie Lee. “We wanted to get married again the next month!”\n\nThe black-tie affair was made even more special with the help of Enos’ pals with everything from planning to cake-cutting. “Everyone pitched in,” Enos recalls. “We were at Cabana Club with my friend Chris Reed, who is one of the owners there and did Roxbury with me, and we were trying to think of where to have [the wedding]. A lot of places are just so much money! Chris finally said, ‘Why don’t you have it here?’ I started thinking about it. We figured we could have an outdoor wedding.”\n\nThat was back in February, which left just enough time to send out invitations, find the perfect wedding dress and rings, and track down a decorator. “I talked to Lou Trabbe, the set designer over at THE YOUNG AND THE RESTLESS, and asked him for help [with] flowers, decorating and setting it up,” Enos relates. “I worked the whole day [with him] and all my best men chipped in while Jennie was in the hotel getting ready. Saturday we had to have an early night, because we were there at 10 a.m. setting up for everyone to show up at 6 p.m.”\n\nAt go time, Enos awaited his bride on the Cabana patio bridge and the two exchanged vows in front of 150 guests, including his Y&R on-screen wife Lauren Woodland (ex-Brittany), on-screen flirtation Melody Thomas Scott (Nikki) and co-stars Thad Luckinbill (J.T.), Greg Rikaart (Kevin) and Christian LeBlanc (Michael)."
