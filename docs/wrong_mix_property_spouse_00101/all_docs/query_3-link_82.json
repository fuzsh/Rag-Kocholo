        "text": "What is the Algorian Way?\n\nThe Algorian Way is paved with excellence, hard work, and limitless innovation. In this series of candid interviews, we get up close and personal with the people working tirelessly behind the scenes to deliver you topnotch monetization and outstanding ROIs. Through this, we hope to showcase our passion and vision for the future of ad tech.\n\nNew Employee Spotlight: Jenny Lee\n\nFirst up in the series, we welcome Jenny Lee, AlgoriX’s new Senior Partnerships Manager. A true global citizen who has lived in several of the world’s most progressive cities, she now lends her rich expertise to help more AlgoriX clients in the Asia-Pacific region and worldwide achieve advertising success.\n\nName 3 things you’d like us to know about you\n\nI recently moved back to my home country, South Korea, after spending 20 years overseas. I went to school in New Zealand, Beijing, and Singapore. Wherever I go, I am able to adapt really quickly and get localized into the culture, language, and lifestyle.\n\nI am an active sports player. I was the soccer captain in High School. I started playing golf two years back, and I am in love with it now. I also enjoy playing table tennis, snow-boarding, and many more.\n\nI began learning to play the drums. I wish I would be able to play the song “Believer” by Imagine Dragons one day!\n\nTell us a little about your work experience and how it contributes to your current role at AlgoriX\n\nI first joined the Ad Tech industry in 2017 by joining Smaato, working on Demand Partnerships across the APAC market. I also worked as a Sales Analyst at Dataxu (now part of Roku), developing effective sales strategies for the business.\n\nThen I moved to Grab, one of Southeast Asia’s leading tech companies, where I was part of GrabAds Strategy and Partnerships team. I managed strategic projects to accelerate profitability and monetization of the GrabAds business, sourcing for new opportunities for revenue growth through internal and external partnerships.\n\nWith my experiences with different ad tech companies, I aim to bring greater business insights to further expand AlgoriX’s presence in the Programmatic landscape. I will take the lead in defining partner segments to target according to our business needs and drive deals end to end.\n\nWhat’s your first impression of the company and your teammates? What’s one thing you enjoy about your job?\n\nMy first impression of the company was that the culture was engaging and collaborative. Despite having to start work remotely due to the pandemic, all the teammates here shared knowledge and ideas actively, providing a sense of belonging from day one!\n\nI enjoy the fact that people from all around the globe are collaborating in such a professional manner, achieving great things by sharing the same vision.\n\nWhat are the things you’d like to accomplish this year?\n\nMy goal is to build a stronger market presence for AlgoriX, expanding its market share in South Korea and other regions.\n\nDescribe AlgoriX using only three words!\n\nGlobal, Tech-savvy, Connected\n\nAny last thoughts?\n\nI look forward to making a positive impact on clients’ businesses as well as ours. I hope to connect with partners who don’t work with us yet, and explore possible ways to maximize their ad revenue through our platform.\n\nI hope to stay up-to-date in this dynamic ad-tech industry and identify the incredible opportunity we could explore as it constantly evolves."
