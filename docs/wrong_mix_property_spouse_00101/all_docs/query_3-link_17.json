        "text": "If you’re in the UK, or even if you’re not, you may have noticed that the Open University has been hitting the headlines recently (to find out more about why, click here). However, something LOVELY has come out of the conversations currently happening about the OU (read the heartwarming stories under the hashtag #reclaimtheou and the comments to Professor Brian Cox’s tweet)\n\nI’m an OU student, studying for my PhD in the Faculty of Business and Law. When I first saw the application for the PhD I’m currently studying (over a year ago), I jumped at the chance to study at this institution.\n\nGrowing up, my brilliantly smart mother, who was told throughout her childhood that she wasn’t clever enough for education, studied relentlessly for her BA in Early Childhood Education. In doing so, she inspired me with her hard work, dedication, and passion for a subject. Here’s the Noakes’ looking predictably dishevelled at her graduation:\n\nSo you could say that we are pretty big fans of this fantastic, important, institution. And in order to celebrate this wonderful university, today on my blog I’m going to chat about Jennie Lee, who played an integral role in the founding of the OU.\n\nJENNIE FROM THE BLOCK (sorry, I had to)\n\nJennie was born into a socialist leaning family in Fife, Scotland. Labour founder Keir Hardie was a family friend, and Jennie followed in those footsteps, joining the Labour Party.\n\nShe was only able to go to university because the Carnegie Trust paid half her fees. She studied Law and Education at Edinburgh University, and played an active part of the university community–she was a member of the Labour Club, joined the Edinburgh University Women’s Union and campaigned for philosopher Bertrand Russell to become Rector. After graduating, she went into teaching.\n\nTAKE THAT CHURCHILL!\n\nJennie became the youngest member of the House of Commons AND one of the earliest women MPs in 1929 when she won a seat for the Labour Party. Her maiden speech was a corker. Typically, the first speech made by a newly elected MP was an uncontroversial affair, but Jenny knew that rules were made to be broken.\n\nIn her first speech, she attacked Winston Churchill (YES, that Winston Churchill), and his budget proposals. She accused him of “cant, corruption, and incompetence”.\n\nReportedly, Winston was pretty impressed by this! Jennie lost her seat in the 1931 election, and remained politically active until she was reelected in 1945.\n\nTHE UNIVERSITY OF THE AIR\n\nWithout Jennie, the OU we have now would be very different–in fact, it may not exist at all. In 1964, Jennie was appointed as the very first Minister for the Arts in Harold Wilson’s Labour Government. Her main achievement in this role was the creation of the ‘University of the Air’, AKA the Open University.\n\nThe aim was to create a inclusive learning institution for those who might have previously not had access to university education. Although she was supported by the Prime Minister in this endeavour, she encountered SERIOUS opposition to the project, from within and outside her political party.\n\nIt was only with Jennie’s determination that the OU was founded. Fundamental to the university was the principle of open access, established by the Advisory Committee in 1965: “Enrolment as a student of the University should be open to everyone … irrespective of educational qualifications, and no formal entrance requirement should be imposed”.\n\nThe OU received it’s royal charter on April 23rd 1969, and the first students began studying in 1971.\n\nJennie Lee’s extraordinary work throughout her life has left a lasting legacy, both for the OU and for women in politics. She passed away in 1988, and today several OU buildings bear her name. Go Jennie, and #SavetheOU"
