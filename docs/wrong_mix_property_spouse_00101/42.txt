Jennie Lee was born in Seoul but grew up in the States. She became one of the top amateur golfers in the country as a teen, playing on two Curtis Cups and advancing to the quarterfinals of the US Women's Amateur several times. She also played the US Women's Open several times; her best finish was a tie for 39th in 2007, which also won her the honor of the low amateur in the field.

Lee attended Duke University, where she was on two NCAA Championship teams (2006 and 2007). After graduating, she turned pro and joined the Futures Tour. In 2009, she only made $14,000 there, which left her well short of the total she needed to earn a tour card. She did much better in 2010, earning $25,000, but that still left her in 18th place on the money list.

In the Fall, however, Jennie went to LPGA Q-School and finished tied for 14th. This was good enough to earn full membership on that tour for 2011. She struggled in her rookie season, however, only finishing 118th on the money list. Still, she kept category 11 status for another season.

Lee had a much better 2012. She had her best ever Major when she finished just outside the top 20 at the US Women's Open. But her best result came at the Jamie Farr Toledo Classic, where she shot two 67s, her career best scores, to post her first ever top five, a tie for fifth.

Thanks to her strong play in those events, she earned over $100,000 for the year and received her first category 1 status tour card for 2013.
