Platform Architecture

The Station is a terminating stop for the KL Monorail line. The Station uses the Spanish solution, having one rail line with a platform on each side, for passengers embarking and disembarking the train separately.

KL Sentral Monorail Station's layout is different from other KL Monorail Line stations. The Station has three levels: The access points at street level, and the ticket area and adjoining platforms on two elevated levels. All levels are linked via stairways, escalators and elevators designated for disabled passengers.

The Station's side platform is used by trains travelling at either direction of the line, and is entirely sheltered by roofs. There are 2 sets of faregates, one in NU Sentral Entrance / Exit and another one is in street level near Entrance / Exit A.
