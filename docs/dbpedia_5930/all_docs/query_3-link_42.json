        "text": "Airport Name\n\nKuala Lumpur International Airport\n\nAirport Location\n\nThe airport is located 35 miles south of Kuala Lumpur.\n\nTerminals\n\n2\n\nIATA Code\n\nKUL\n\nTelephone\n\n+60 (0)3 8776 2000\n\nAirport Overview\n\nKuala Lumpur International Airport (KUL) is situated approximately 31 miles (50km) south of Kuala Lumpur. It is one of southeast Asia’s largest airports and is ranked as the 13th busiest airport in the world with around 35 million passengers per year.\n\nThe airport is a veritable city, spanning an enormous 100 km2 (38 m2) and employing a 25,000-strong workforce, which results in efficient service throughout all operations.\n\nThe passenger terminal complex consists of three buildings – the Satellite Building, Contact Pier and the main terminal building (Terminal 1). The Satellite building, in addition to housing a vast array of restaurants, cafes and shops, serves international flights departing from and arriving at Kuala Lumpur International. The Contact Pier is reserved for passengers of Malaysia Airlines, while Terminal 1 caters to the needs of all passengers arriving, departing or in transit.\n\nAlthough not as extravagant as Singapore and Seoul Incheon, Kuala Lumpur International is modern, clean and easy to navigate. With a host of excellent retail outlets and dining establishments, you won’t have any trouble killing time. Better yet, an advanced railway system gets you to Kuala Lumpur Sentral in less than 30 minutes.\n\nTake note that carrying alcohol into Kuala Lumpur is generally prohibited. Alcoholic beverages are sealed in special bags and are only allowed to be opened once you have departed.\n\nTerminal Transfer\n\nA complimentary service (the Aerotrain) shuttles passengers between Terminal 1 and the Satellite Building, via a tunnel underneath the airport taxiway. The shuttle departs every three to five minutes with the journey taking less than two minutes.\n\nGetting into Town\n\nTrain: Express Rail Link operates the KLIA Express and Transit lines, both of which link the airport to the city center. Children pay just under half price. It is the best way to travel to the city from the airport as the journey is non-stop and takes 28 minutes.\n\nBus: The bus station is on the ground floor of the car park, accessed from level 2 of Terminal 1. Airport Liner, City Liner, Sepang Omnibus and Star Shuttle run between Kuala Lumpur International and areas in and around Kuala Lumpur.\n\nTaxi: Airport Limo provides four taxi services – Budget Taxi, Family Service, Premier Limo and super Luxury – from Kuala Lumpur International to areas in Kuala Lumpur and Selangor. Coupons for either service may be acquired at the Airport Limo counters.\n\nCar Parking\n\nTwo main car parks, consisting of 11,442 parking bays, offer both short- and long-term stays.\n\nInformation Desks\n\nInformation desks and friendly personnel are positioned throughout the building; they handle all inquiries concerning travel details, PA broadcasts and lost items. You can also make use of a variety of self-service kiosks that allow you to access the Internet and a selection of travel guides.\n\nAirport Facilities\n\nMoney and communications: ATMs, currency exchange and post office services.\n\nLuggage: There is a lost-and-found office at the airport, and a left-luggage facility. Baggage wrapping services are offered at two counters at the departure hall in Terminal 1.\n\nConference and business: The Plaza Premium Lounge – located in the satellite building – offers basic facilities such as Internet access and free telephone usage (local calls only), and is accessible to all passengers at a small cost. Alternatively, executives may use the Business Center or book private conference rooms in Terminal 1. Services and facilities include Internet, computers, telephones, printers, photocopiers, fax, packaging and courier services.\n\nShopping: Retail outlets are located throughout the airport. From boutique fashion and cosmetic stores to electronics, sports and toy shops, outlets such as Hugo Boss, Versace, Harrods, Godiva and The Body Shop offer an attractive assortment of products for all your shopping needs.\n\nFood and drink: Kuala Lumpur International features a plethora of restaurants, cafes and fast food outlets for food lovers of all tastes. Grab a quick bite at KFC, McDonald’s or Burger King, sit down for a cup of coffee and Panini at Cafe Ritazza, or tuck into a succulent steak at the Satay Club Grill and Bar.\n\nOther facilities: The Satellite Building contains most of the airport’s amenities as well as several lounges, (serving complimentary snacks, drinks, magazines and newspapers). The building also has nurseries, a children’s play area, a reflexology and massage center, disabled facilities and a pharmacy and clinic.\n\nWi-Fi: Kuala Lumpur International offers free Wi-Fi access throughout all main areas of the airport, specifically the arrival and departure halls, Satellite Building and Contact Pier."
