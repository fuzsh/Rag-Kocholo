I've loved learning from the experts about how effective parking management is fundamental to great urban design, enhancing public spaces, prosperous and safe town centres, and a transport system that works for everyone. I was a champion for removing parking minimums from Auckland's Unitary Plan and organised \"Good for Business\" parking seminars for business associations when I was on the local board. I've been in the trenches over the introduction of residents parking schemes since the first one in St Mary's Bay over a decade ago and backed many upgrade projects that have been transformed by replacing car parks with people space. So unsurprisingly I am super excited about the development of the Downtown car park site and realising the vision of the City Centre Centre Masterplan. I’m glad I played a part in making sure Council’s agreed strategic outcomes for the site didn’t include a requirement to retain 400-600 public car parking as originally proposed by AT based on AT’s own admission that they didn’t understand council’s goals. (The original decision report in April 2021 was deferred to June 2021 for a re-write after I pointed out to Chair Darby that AT’s numbers didn’t stack up and would make any development unviable). Precinct Properties recently leaked plans show a remarkable legacy project rising on a prime waterfront site especially if the development includes the removal of the Hobson St flyover (a remnant of the planned Eastern motorway that fortunately never went ahead). The development is future-focused, fit for a city centre where most people don’t own a car and the majority will travel in by public transport. In 2 hours the CRL can bring into the city and take home again, the same amount of people as 30 Downtown carparks (thanks to Kent Lundberg for that CRL factoid). It makes no sense for ratepayers to continue subsidising car parking in an earthquake risk building that needs millions of dollars of investment. In any case, much of the space is taken up for leasehold parking and what is available for short term use is rarely full (if I recall a workshop briefing correctly the majority of those who do use it come from a catchment well served by public transport). There are over 50,000 car parks in the city centre for those who want to drive. Free and subsidised parking is an extremely emotive issue that politicians (and the NZ Herald) love to exploit data-free. If the save the Downtown car park campaign is successful it will be all Aucklanders who end up paying. The looming final decision by council on the development needs to be made on what’s best for the future of the city. #parking #citycentremasterplan #shoupista #Auckland\n\n🅿️ **Parking United - Elevating Your Parking Experience** 🅿️ Are you tired of the endless search for parking spaces?

As a housing architect of Vietnamese descent, an avid sport cyclist, and a former Portland Bicycle Advisory Committee (BAC) member, Victor’s multifaceted background offers a fresh and informed perspective on the challenges and opportunities surrounding urban planning and transportation. [Forbes Article: https://lnkd.in/dHhED6ba] The piece highlighted the paradox of bike parking mandates in cities like Portland. While there’s a growing trend to reduce or eliminate car parking requirements, bike parking regulations seem to be on the rise. Such mandates, though well-intentioned, can inadvertently inflate housing costs. The logic is simple: when housing developers are compelled to allocate space for bike storage, it can lead to larger unit sizes, which in turn can push up rents. In his professional capacity as a Project Manager at Leeb Architects, Victor has witnessed firsthand the implications of these regulations. He notes, “The previous revision of the bike parking code removed approximately 1-2 units for every 200 units; the current bike parking code now removes approximately 1 out of 15 units.” Such reductions come at a time when housing efficiency is paramount. The crux of the matter isn’t about diminishing the importance of bikes or undermining their role in sustainable urban mobility. It’s about striking a balance. As Victor aptly puts it, “We are crafting a city for people, not just buildings and bikes.” At a public hearing on October 24th before the Portland Planning Commission, Victor brought his unwavering commitment to fostering a safe, equitable, and sustainable transportation system, promoting a conversation and vision that harmoniously integrates the needs of all Portlanders. (Full video of the meeting available on YouTube.) He followed up his terstimony with a think piece in Strongtowns, where he emphasized, “Our regulatory priorities are backwards… bike parking is important, but not more important than housing, not even close. Resources should first go to housing, then figure out bike parking from there.” [Stongtowns Op Ed: https://lnkd.in/dm5rP76f] You can read more on The Street Trust website: https://lnkd.in/daYcnNuZ\n\nParkIt Greece: Revolutionizing Urban Parking with a Click Parking in urban areas can be a challenge.

Generally, climate-controlled units attract a 10-30% premium over non-climate controlled, though that number can vary widely. However, in the RV/boat storage world, there are three distinct product types: uncovered, covered, and enclosed. While enclosed may get a 20-30% premium over covered, in many markets, uncovered spaces rent for a fraction of covered/enclosed spaces. I've seen multiple markets where a typical 35' covered space rents for $150+/mo and an uncovered space rents for $45/mo. [Insert typical disclaimer that all markets are different]. So... if you're building an RV/boat parking facility, know that uncovered spaces can greatly decrease your earning potential. In most cases, it’s worth finding some more money to at least offer covered parking. Why are uncovered parking spaces so cheap? Building off the last 'thing', uncovered parking spaces are cheap for a few reasons. The first is that uncovered spaces are often seen as an ancillary use—either for self-storage or some other business that has excess land. It's not the main business and it's treated as such. A lot of times, the business owner will set a flat price at $50/mo for uncovered spaces, fill it up, and then won't think about it again. They are not shopping competition and adjusting rates accordingly. Secondly, barriers to entry for uncovered parking are extremely low. Assuming your zoning is ok (or that your local code enforcement is lazy), you can basically start an RV/boat parking business with uncovered spaces for nothing. So if you do stumble upon a market with decent rates for uncovered parking, just beware that it won't take much for additional competition to flood the market. All that said, uncovered RV/boat parking is a great interim use for your land if you have bigger future plans in the works. COVID-19 killed seasonality in RV/boat parking - Another recurring theme we're discovering as we talk to more and more RV/boat parking facilities across the country: seasonality is dead. Before Covid, RV/boat parking facilities could count on summer (or winter in hot climates) being slow because that's when tenants took their toys out. When Covid came, along with the explosion of RV/boat sales, demand for RV/boat storage soared. Now, it's commonplace for tenants to continue paying rent on their empty units just to hold their space until they get back from their summer adventures.
