        "text": "Kuala Lumpur – General Information about the Destination\n\nKuala Lumpur is the capital and largest city of Malaysia. Located along the Klang and Gombak rivers, it is the cultural, financial, and economic center of the country. Kuala Lumpur boasts a striking mix of architectural styles reflecting its history as a mining town that blossomed into a modern metropolis.\n\nMajor landmarks include the iconic Petronas Twin Towers, once the world’s tallest buildings, as well as the Kuala Lumpur Tower and the old Railway Station building. Kuala Lumpur is a shopping paradise with massive malls like Suria KLCC, Pavilion, and Berjaya Times Square. Hawker stalls and restaurants serve up mouthwatering local specialties like nasi lemak, satay, and Laksa. Kuala Lumpur is the gateway for exploring Malaysia’s attractions such as Malacca and Penang.\n\nInformation about the Route (Mid Valley to KL Sentral)\n\nTrains from Mid Valley to KL Sentral run on the Batu Caves – Pulau Sebang rail line. There is one station between the departure and arrival points. The journey takes about 5 minutes on both weekdays and weekends. Tickets can be purchased directly at the stations because advance ticket purchases are not available for the KTM Komuter service.\n\nSee also: Komuter Train from KL Sentral to Mid Valley\n\nSchedule of KTM Komuter Mid Valley – KL Sentral\n\n(Jadual Komuter Mid Valley ke Kuala Lumpur)\n\nrains from Mid Valley to KL Sentral operate frequently for passengers’ convenience.

Completed in August 2004, it cost RM12.2 million to build. The station improved its connectivity on November 14, 2019, by opening a pedestrian bridge to KL Eco City, linking it to the Abdullah Hukum station on the Port Klang Line and Kelana Jaya Line. In 2021, some parts of the station were closed for upgrading, leaving only the side heading southwards to Kajang and Seremban open.\n\nThe station has two levels: the upper level is for ticketing, and the lower level has covered platforms, accessible via stairs or elevators for handicapped passengers. The design includes high-arched canopies and steel frames.\n\nLocated 200 meters from Mid Valley City, home to the Mid Valley Megamall and The Gardens, the station offers easy access to these shopping locations. It was built to reduce traffic congestion by providing an alternative to road travel to these areas. There is no parking available at the station itself because it mainly serves the Mid Valley City area, but parking is available within Mid Valley City. Buses also service the station via nearby Jalan Syed Putra.\n\nSee also: Komuter train from Seremban to Mid Valley\n\nArrival Point – KL Sentral\n\nKL Sentral, located in the Brickfields area of southwestern Kuala Lumpur about 3 km from the city center, is a major transportation hub in Kuala Lumpur.
