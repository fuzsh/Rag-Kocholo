        "text": "Kuala Lumpur’s public transportation network is almost entirely accessible to wheelchair users. Public transit is one of the best aspects of accessibility in the city. Take advantage of the tips I’ve outlined below, as they’ll make your journey in, through and around KL hassle- and stress-free.\n\nLRT Light Rail System\n\nI used the LRT light rail trains more than any other transportation service during my time in Kuala Lumpur. All 48 stations on the LRT’s Ampang and Kelana Jaya lines are wheelchair accessible by way of ramps and elevators. The trains and station platforms are level with one another, with a minimal gap between the two. This allows for easy boarding with a wheelchair. All of my experiences on the LRT were barrier-free.\n\nLRT fares are based on distance traveled, and start at 1 MYR (~$0.25 USD) for one stop. Payment can be made at the electronic ticket machines, or with a reloadable MyRapid transit card. Prasarana Malaysia Berhad (RapidKL) provided me with a complimentary MyRapid card with 50 MYR of pre-loaded value to support my visit. I rode the LRT countless times, and did not exhaust the card’s value.\n\nOnce you have paid your fare, you’ll tap the provided token (or your MyRapid card) on the automated fare collection gate, and proceed to the train platform. The bank of gates/turnstiles always includes one or more with an extended width to accommodate wheelchairs, baby strollers and luggage.\n\nThere are several models of train operating on the LRT system. New models feature spaces reserved for wheelchairs (pictured above). These spaces include a seatbelt which can be used by wheelchair users. For power wheelchair users, it may not be safe to use this seatbelt because there are no other securement points. Use of the seatbelt is not required – I never used it personally.\n\nKTM Komuter Train\n\nThe KTM Komuter is another train that runs through central Kuala Lumpur, and will be useful in many cases. The trains are modern and air-conditioned. The Komuter routes extend farther outside of Kuala Lumpur, because it is a commuter rail service. Most stops offer park & ride parking lots.\n\nI used the KTM Komuter once only, departing from the KL Sentral Station. Like the LRT, the transit experience was barrier-free. The entire network consists of 68 stations, with two lines serving the City of Kuala Lumpur. These are the Seremban and Port Klang lines.\n\nFares are based on distance traveled, and can be purchased at the ticket window. For travel within KL, I recommend sticking with the LRT and city bus, as the trains run at a much higher frequency.\n\nKLIA ekspres\n\nThe KLIA ekspres is an express service train between Kuala Lumpur International Airport and the KL Sentral Train Station, which is at the heart of the city. The train also serves the KLIA2 terminal, which is used by low-cost airlines like AirAsia.\n\nThe cost of a one-way adult ticket on the KLIA Ekspres is 55 MYR (~$14 USD). A slightly discounted rate of 100 MYR is available on the purchase of a round trip ticket, with the return ticket good for one month from the date of purchase.\n\nThe KLIA Ekspres is wheelchair accessible, with level-entry boarding between the platform and train at all stations. The trip between Sentral Station and the airport takes about 30 minutes. Connections are available at Sentral station to the LRT, KTM Kommuter and city bus services, together with intercity and regional trains.\n\nKL Hop-on/Hop-off Bus\n\nThe KL HOP-ON HOP-OFF bus is perfect for tourists exploring the city. The buses serve 23 different stops, which provide access to more than 70 of the city’s top attractions. I used the service many times to scoot around the city. Among the attractions served by the route are the PETRONAS Twin Towers, Merdeka Square, the Palace of Culture, KL Tower, National Palace, Jamek Mosque, Little India and the KL Sentral train station.\n\nThe bus has an accessible ramp and an onboard space reserved for wheelchairs. Depending on the stop, the ramp angle may be steep, but my power wheelchair handled it without issue. The bus driver also backed me up, just in case there were issues. The buses were all air conditioned and comfortable, even though the outside temperature was high."
