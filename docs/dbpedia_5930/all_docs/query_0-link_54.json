        "text": "After an incredible 10 days in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, it was time to say goodbye to the city. For my last night in town, I wanted to book a hotel in or near KL Sentral, as I had a flight out of Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KUL) the next morning, and the airport buses depart from there.\n\nI chose the Aloft Kuala Lumpur Sentral because of its prime locationâright next to KL Sentral stationâand Iâm a huge fan of Aloft Hotels because of its âdifferent by designâ philosophy.\n\nAccording to Marriott, Aloft hotels are âurban-inspired spaces and vibrant social scenes for the next-gen travelerâ and âa vision of W Hotels.â Aloft hotels feature modern art and designs mixed with a lively social scene, creating a unique atmosphere.\n\nRead on for my full review of the property and why you should consider staying here the next time youâre in Kuala Lumpur.\n\nBooking the Aloft Kuala Lumpur Sentral\n\nI knew I wanted a hotel near KL Sentral station, as I planned to catch an airport bus directly from KL Sentral to Kuala Lumpur International Airport on the morning of my flight. The SkyBus provides a convenient and inexpensive way to get to the airport.\n\nI began by looking at the options from my usual suspects â Hilton, Hyatt, and Marriott. I narrowed down several properties based on 2 factors: cost and location. After looking at a few options, I opted for the Aloft Kuala Lumpur Sentral, which had the best cash rates.\n\nA 1-night stay at the hotel was 333 Malaysian ringgit, or about $71, before taxes and fees.\n\nPaying Cash vs. Using Points\n\nWhile the cash price was reasonable, I was curious to see how many Marriott Bonvoy points it would cost as a comparison. A standard room at the hotel could be booked for 11,000 points for the 1-night stay.Â\n\nAccording to our valuations, Marriott Bonvoy points are worth 0.7 cents apiece, making 11,000 points worth $77. Since the cash price closely matched the value of the points, using Marriott Bonvoy points for this redemption would have been a good value. Ultimately, I decided to book this night by paying cash instead of redeeming Marriott Bonvoy points.\n\nAlthough it would have been a good value to use points, I typically spend my Marriott Bonvoy points on longer stays to take advantage of Marriottâs fifth-night-free perk. With this benefit, Marriott automatically gives the lowest point-value night for free when Marriott Bonvoy members redeem points for 5 consecutive nights under 1 reservation.\n\nI booked the cheapest room available, a 1 King Bed Guest Room. I was confident I would get upgraded as a Marriott Bonvoy Platinum Elite member.\n\nThe total amounted to RM369, approximately $79, including taxes and fees.\n\nI opted to use the Marriott Bonvoy BrilliantÂ® American ExpressÂ® Card for payment since it earns 6x Marriott Bonvoy points per dollar on eligible purchases at participating Marriott Bonvoy properties, which allowed me to maximize my rewards for this booking.\n\nHot Tip:\n\nLearn the best ways to earn tons of Marriott Bonvoy points in our detailed guide!\n\nAloft Kuala Lumpur Sentral Location\n\nThe Aloft Kuala Lumpur Sentral is located in downtown Kuala Lumpur right next to the cityâs main transportation hub, KL Sentral station. From its prime location, the rest of Kuala Lumpur is easily accessible via public transportation.\n\nNearby attractions include Brickfields, Thean Hou Temple, the National Mosque of Malaysia, Perdana Botanical Garden, Sri Maha Mariamman Temple, Petaling Street Market, and Merdeka Square.\n\nGetting There\n\nIf you arrive at Kuala Lumpur International Airport, the journey to the hotel typically takes around 45 minutes by car.\n\nAlternatively, the KLIA Ekspres airport rail link takes about 30 minutes to reach KL Sentral station. From there, itâs a 10-minute walk to the hotel via a bridgeÂ through the adjacent Nu Sentral Mall.\n\nCheck-In\n\nI reached the property just before 8 a.m. and headed directly to the check-in counter, conveniently located in the center of the expansive lobby.\n\nUpon arrival, the front desk manager warmly greeted me and requested some identification to locate my reservation. After providing my passport, we engaged in brief small talk. He quickly located my reservation and thanked me for being a Marriott Bonvoy Platinum Elite member.\n\nHe upgraded me to a Breezy Suite on the 27th floor and briefed me about the hotelâs amenities and operating hours. He also extended me a 4 p.m. late checkout, a perk of Marriott Bonvoy Platinum Elite status.\n\nHe also inquired about my preference for the Marriott Bonvoy Platinum Elite welcome amenity: 1,000 Marriott Bonvoy points or complimentary breakfast. I chose the latter since I was not planning on leaving the hotel until it was time to check out.\n\nLastly, he mentioned that the room was ready, which is always a great thing. Although the hotelâs standard check-in time was 3 p.m., I could head to my room around 8 a.m.\n\nThe front desk manager handed me the room keys, and I was on my way.\n\nElite Benefits\n\nComplimentary Marriott Bonvoy Platinum Elite status is a benefit of my Marriott Bonvoy Brilliant card. With this status, I received several enhanced benefits during my stay, including:\n\nFree daily breakfast\n\n4 p.m. late checkout\n\nUpgrade to the best room, up to standard suites (in this case, the Breezy Suite)\n\nI would have also received club lounge access had there been one.\n\nHot Tip:\n\nAdditional benefits of the Marriott Bonvoy Brilliant card include an annualÂ free hotel night certificateÂ worth up to 85,000 points, Priority Pass lounge membership, Global EntryÂ orÂ TSA PreCheckÂ application/renewal fee statement credit, and a monthly dining statement credit of up to $25. Some benefits require enrollment.\n\nLobby\n\nBefore heading to my room, I walked around the hotel lobby to explore its offerings. The concierge desk was located directly to the left of the check-in desk. Elevators for the parking garage were located right next to the concierge desk.\n\nTo the far left end of the hotel lobby, I spotted an elite check-in counter, which I hadnât noticed upon entering the hotel. It felt to me like this was a poorly chosen location.\n\nIn front of the elite check-in desk was an incredible piece of art depicting a âSnakes and Laddersâ board.\n\nTo the left was an escalator, which led to the first floor where the Nook restaurant and bridge connecting the hotel to the Nu Sentral mall were\n\nBehind the escalators was a cozy seating area furnished with comfortable armchairs and wooden desks.\n\nLarge lamps strategically placed throughout the space illuminated and divided the seating section.\n\nAn Aloft-branded bookshelf was stocked with an assortment of items. I particularly liked the illuminated Aloft signage.\n\nTo the right of the display was an entertainment unit featuring a surprising inclusion: an Xbox 360. This nostalgic sight brought back many memories of the countless hours I spent gaming on my own console over the years.\n\nThe guest room elevators were located right across from the media unit. There were 4 elevators available, which proved necessary considering how much they were being used.\n\nAmenities\n\nThe Aloft Kuala Lumpur Sentral provided hotel guests with several amenities. Hereâs a look at what was on offer.\n\nWi-Fi\n\nThe hotel provided complimentary Wi-Fi to all guests. The Wi-Fi speeds were good enough for me to get some work done, and I had a stable connection throughout the hotel.\n\nParking\n\nFor hotel guests, parking cost RM10 (~$2) per entry. Valet Parking was also available at RM25 (~$5) per car for 24 hours.\n\nSPLASH Outdoor Pool\n\nThe Aloft Kuala Lumpur Sentral boasts an outdoor rooftop infinity pool open daily between 6 a.m. and 11 p.m.\n\nI was in awe of the magnificentÂ city views right from the pool. It was nice to see how much greenery Kuala Lumpur offers throughout the bustling city center.\n\nLounge chairs lined the sun deck alongside the pool, offering a spot to soak up the sun. The presence of palm trees added a real tropical vibe to the area.\n\nRe:charge Fitness Center\n\nThe hotel also features a fully equipped fitness center on the fourth floor. Itâs open 24 hours a day and is accessible with a guest room key card.\n\nSeveral cardio machines were available, including 2 ellipticals and 3 treadmills.\n\nA bench and free weights were available for those wanting to incorporate strength training in their workout.\n\nRe:Mix Lounge\n\nRe:Mix Lounge was located in the hotel lobby between the check-in desk and the W XYZ bar.\n\nThe setting frequently hosts live music shows on weekends, creating a vibrant atmosphere perfect for lounging and enjoying a drink from the W XYZ bar.\n\nThe lounge also boasted a pool table at its center. While I may not be a very skilled pool player, I joined some other hotel guests for a game or 2.\n\nBreezy Suite\n\nAs I stepped off the elevator onto the 27th floor, my attention was immediately drawn to the expansive window on the right. It had incredible views overlooking the Brickfields neighborhood â I loved the combination of low- and mid-rise apartment buildings and towering high-rise buildings.\n\nThe hallway walls featured an array of unique and eye-catching art pieces and colorful overhead light fixtures, which added vibrancy to the space.\n\nLiving Room\n\nStepping into my room, I was instantly amazed by how much space was in the suite.\n\nThe entrance led to a vast open-concept living room area with a large dining table and seating for 4 people. The seats were surprisingly comfortable despite not having armrests.\n\nBehind the dining table and against the back wall was a small kitchen area with a countertop and several storage compartments underneath.\n\nOn the countertop was a coffee station with glassware, coffee packets, tea bags, sugar packets, coffee capsules, and a capsule machine. An electric kettle was also provided for added convenience.\n\nThe hotel also provided 4 complimentary water bottles.\n\nNext to the water bottles were some snacks, including roasted peanuts, mixed nuts, strawberry cookies, and prawn crackers. I wasnât sure if these were complimentary since I couldnât find their prices. I called the front desk to inquire and was told they were complimentary!\n\nA minibar was in one of the storage cabinets beneath the countertop. It had a minimal selection of beverages, including soft drinks, orange juice, and sparkling water.\n\nOn the far right of the countertop was a small sink. Although it was nice to have, I didnât use it once during my stay.\n\nAfter exploring the dining section of the living room, I moved on to the main seating area. There were 2 sofas positioned perpendicular to each other. An incredibly large coffee table was directly in the center of the room.\n\nA large TV was mounted on the wall across from the left sofa.\n\nBedroom\n\nThe bedroomâs focal point was the king-size bed, positioned squarely in the center against the back wall.\n\nThe bed was adorned with 4 plush pillows and 2 bolster pillows, which were incredibly comfortable. The headboard above the bed had some interesting art depicting gluttony.\n\nEach side of the bed had a wall-mounted nightstand. The room alarm clock and switches for the light fixtures were on the right nightstand.\n\nThe roomâs telephone was on the nightstand to the left of the bed.\n\nAn armchair and a standing lamp were to the far left of the room.\n\nThe roomâs workstation was in the corner against the windows, which offered a ton of natural light. A small desk lamp provided extra illumination.\n\nAn ergonomic mesh-backed office chair was also provided. While the armrests lacked padding and werenât particularly comfortable, the chair provided a ton of back support.\n\nThe windows stretched across the roomâs length and provided a panoramic view of downtown Kuala Lumpur.\n\nBathrooms\n\nThe roomâs spacious main bathroom featured 2 individual sinks on the vanity.\n\nThe shower was located directly across the hall from the entrance. It had an interesting tile backsplash with a myriad of colors, which added a vibrant and lively touch to the space.\n\nThe shower featured both a handheld and a waterfall showerhead.\n\nOn the wall were reusable bottles of Drybar-branded shampoo, conditioner, and shower gel. I love it when hotels take this eco-friendly approach to shower amenities.\n\nOpposite the shower and to the right of the bathroom entrance was a spacious vanity area boasting 2 sinks, which provided plenty of space.\n\nThe hotel provided 2 more complementary water bottles.\n\nThe hotel also supplied a variety of toiletries, including toothbrush kits, mouthwash, and Drybar body lotion. It also provided a shower cap and a sanitary bag.\n\nThe bathroomâs toilet was across from the right sink and next to the shower and featured a bidet hose. More of the vibrant tile backsplash was on the wall behind the toilet.\n\nA sliding door separated the shower and toilet areas, offering privacy for each, but only 1 area could be closed off at a time.\n\nA massive storage unit was on the wall near the bathroomâs entrance; it could probably have held all my clothes.\n\nAgainst the left wall was a small bench and a full-length mirror. I found the mirror poorly placed as there wasnât much space in the corner.\n\nThe hotel provided several extra towels and 2 pairs of complimentary slippers.\n\nThe room safe was also located in the storage unit.\n\nLastly, the roomâs iron and ironing board were located in the closet.\n\nThe suite also boasted a half bathroom, conveniently situated near the entrance to the guestroom.\n\nThis bathroom also had the same colored tile-backsplash.\n\nBottom Line:\n\nOverall, I was thoroughly impressed with the suite. I loved the selected furniture pieces, and the vibrant and colorful design aesthetic of the room truly stood out.\n\nFood and Beverage\n\nThe Aloft Kuala Lumpur Sentral boasted several on-site dining options. Hereâs a look at what the property had to offer.\n\nNook\n\nThe hotelâs main restaurant, Nook, is located on the first floor and is easily accessible from the lobby. The futuristic-themed restaurant features an international buffet; however, an Ã la carte menu is also available.\n\nNook was open:\n\nFor breakfast: between 6 and 10:30 a.m. daily\n\nFor lunch: between 12 and 3 p.m. daily\n\nFor dinner: between 6 and 10 p.m. on Friday and Saturday\n\nThe restaurant featured a diverse international menu. However, it also emphasized âAround Townâ food, offering traditional Malaysian cuisine.\n\nThe restaurant was quite large, with seating for at least 100 people.\n\nWhile I didnât dine at the restaurant for lunch or dinner, I did have my breakfast here.\n\nAfter settling my belongings at a table, I went to the breakfast area to explore the offerings.\n\nFirst was a cereal bar featuring a wide array of options, including granola, Coco Puffs, Fruit Loops, Honey Stars, Cornflakes, and Bran Flakes.\n\nThe pastry selection boasted a variety of options, including croissants, pain au chocolat, and Danish pastries. The pain au chocolat and Danishes were excellent.\n\nOther pastries included assorted muffins and sliced cakes, which added to the variety of options.\n\nA display board had fresh donuts.\n\nThe breakfast offerings also included a noodle bar where a chef would prepare noodles with your choice of toppings.\n\nNumerous toppings were available, ranging from vegetables and meats to seafood. For my noodles, I opted for shrimp, chicken, and mushrooms.\n\nA salad bar featured an abundance of toppings and dressings.\n\nA dedicated beverage station offered infused water and a variety of juice options, including orange, pineapple, pink guava, and green guava juice.\n\nAdditionally, 3 coffee machines were available.\n\nA dedicated tea station featured a variety of options such as masala chai, teh tarik, and Nescafe tarik. The masala chai was outstanding, among the best chai Iâve ever tasted.\n\nAfter collecting several breakfast plates, I returned to my table, eagerly anticipating the meal.\n\nBottom Line:\n\nOverall, breakfast was fantastic. The wide selection of food available was impressive, and the noodle bar and tea station, in particular, stood out. I think I enjoyed breakfast a little more than usual, as I arrived right at 6 a.m. when everything was fresh.\n\nMai Bar\n\nThe property also has a rooftop poolside bar, Mai Bar. The tiki-themed bar, which had an open layout, featured Polynesian art and electrifying music and was open daily from 2 p.m. to midnight.\n\nMai Bar offered an extensive menu, emphasizing specially crafted cocktails and gourmet bar snacks.\n\nThe bar had some intriguing design elements with lots of red touches.\n\nW XYZ Bar\n\nW XYZ Bar is situated on the ground level adjacent to the check-in desk and is open daily from 9 a.m. until midnight.\n\nThe W XYZ bar has an extensive alcohol selection and a cocktail happy hour every day between 5 and 7 p.m. It also hosts a live music show every Friday evening.\n\nW XYZ bar offered several seating options in a spacious dining area. It was relatively empty throughout the day but got busy around dinner time.\n\nFood-wise, the menu had many international and Malaysian options.\n\nRe:Fuel By Aloft\n\nAs with many Aloft hotels worldwide, the Aloft Kuala Lumpur Sentral also boasted Re:Fuel By Aloft, a 24-hour self-serve gourmet pantry. Here, you can find mix-and-match meals and make your own cappuccinos.\n\nAn extensive selection of beverages was available, ranging from soda and fruit juices to Malaysian beer. Instant noodles and various flavors of chips were also available.\n\nThere was a great selection of freshly brewed coffee and tea. Iced drinks were also available on request.\n\nService\n\nI didnât have too many interactions with the hotel staff during my stay. However, during the brief times I did, I found them to be incredibly welcoming. The staff seemed to enjoy their jobs and worked hard to ensure guests had a positive experience at the hotel.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nThe Aloft Kuala Lumpur Sentral is a fantastic Marriott property in a prime location worth considering when visiting Kuala Lumpur.\n\nThe Breezy Suite was truly remarkable, boasting ample space and intriguing art and decor. The rooftop pool and bar provided a wonderful way to relax 30 floors above the hustle and bustle of the city center.\n\nBreakfast was truly fantastic, offering a wide array of options and a diverse food selection. Everything was remarkably fresh and tasted delicious. I can honestly say it was among the best breakfasts I have ever had at a hotel.\n\nThe Aloft Kuala Lumpur Sentral offers plenty of value without the hefty price tag of other upscale hotels in the area. I would definitely stay at the Aloft Kuala Lumpur Sentral again the next time I find myself in Kuala Lumpur."
