        "text": "Located in Malaysia, Pulau Redang (Redang Island) is one of the most popular island getaways. It’s known for its marine park, beautiful beaches, and pristine waters, which are perfect for diving enthusiasts. Getting here will involve the combination of travelling via air, road, and the sea. The following steps will guide you on how to reach this tropical paradise!\n\nGetting to Pulau Redang by Flight\n\nPulau Redang’s nearest airport with domestic connections is Sultan Mahmud Shah Airport in Kuala Terengganu. From Kuala Terengganu Airport, take public transport (bus or taxi) to one of the jetties from which public ferries regularly depart for Redang Island.\n\nFrom the Shahbandar Jetty (5 minutes from Kuala Terengganu Bus Terminal), you can take the 2 hours ferry ride to Redang. Alternatively, you can take a taxi to Merang Jetty, 30 km away from Kuala Terengganu. The boat ride from Merang to Redang Island takes only 45 minutes.\n\nFlying into Kota Bahru in Kelantan is a less common option. However, the trip to the jetties can add another 3 hours to your travel time. The good news is that there are frequent daily flights from Kuala Lumpur to Kuala Terengganu and Kota Bahru.\n\nBerjaya Air offers a limited number of direct flights to Redang Airport from Subang’s Sultan Abdul Aziz Shah Airport. The flight time is approximately 30 minutes. However, the schedule is subject to change, and the number of flights can change at any time.\n\nRead the Redang by air guide for the latest updates and schedules.\n\nFerry To Pulau Redang\n\nMerang Jetty and Shahbandar Jetty serve as the main spots for ferry transfers to Pulau Redang.\n\nThe boat service to Redang Island departs from Merang Jetty more frequently. You are likely to have purchased a vacation package that includes private resort ferry transfers departing from Merang. While it only takes 45 minutes to reach Redang Island, the jetty is 30km away from Kuala Terengganu.\n\nAlternatively, the Shahbandar Jetty is only a short walk from the Kuala Terengganu bus terminal. To get to Redang Island, there is a public ferry service that takes about two hours. The public ferry operator is Sejahtera Ferry Services Sdn Bhd.\n\n-> Check the latest schedule and ferry ticket prices\n\nNote that there is no direct public boat service to Redang Island from the Perhentian Islands. You would need to charter a boat, which can cost upwards of RM1000 each way.\n\nGetting To Pulau Redang By Car\n\nThose new to Malaysia and who own a car or prefer to drive themselves will find driving in Malaysia straightforward. To navigate on the road, you can use the Waze app or Google Map GPS. The road signs are readable.\n\nFirst, you must drive to Merang Jetty or Shahbandar Jetty in Terengganu. Parking is available at both jetty areas, and most charge around RM10 per day. The car park area is secure, and there is a warden to watch over your vehicle. Nevertheless, it is advisable not to leave any valuables in the car. Shahbandar Jetty has limited parking spaces.\n\nHowever, since this is in the heart of the city, there are many nearby parking lots within walking distance.\n\nDriving From Kuala Lumpur to Kuala Terengganu\n\nKuala Terengganu is 451km away from Kuala Lumpur, and it will take approximately 5 hours to drive there. You can leave KL by exiting into the E8 highway in the direction of Kuantan. Drive along the Karak Expressway and then follow the East Coast Expressway/ECE ( Lebuhraya Pantai Timur/LPT) all the way to Kuala Terengganu.\n\nDriving From Penang to Kuala Terengganu\n\nFrom Penang, head towards Kota Bharu via the East-West Highway Route 4 . You will drive through Gerik and Jerteh, then head south on the highway towards Merang Highway. The total distance is about 454km and will take you approximately 7 hours 30mins.\n\nYou’ll experience spectacular views along the East-West Highway, and it’s one of a kind. You won’t find plantations or development on this route like you would on any other major highway. You may even see wildlife crossing the road at night if you’re lucky. Due to this, drive carefully near Grik, especially when you see the ”Elephant Crossing” signs.\n\nDriving from Singapore to Kuala Terengganu\n\nFrom Singapore or Johor Bahru, take the North-South Plus Highway (Lebuhraya Utara Selatan) and exit Yong Peng 242. Drive along highway Route 1 to Segamat and then Route 12 towards Kuantan via Muadzam Shah and Gambang. Following this route, you will reach route E8 (East Coast Expressway/LPT), where you can continue straight to Kuala Terengganu. The total distance is about 602km, and the journey takes about 7 hours 30 minutes.\n\nAs a second option, one can exit the Johor Causeway by staying on the left and exiting Route 3 (Lebuh Persekutuan 3) towards Mersing. Continue driving and exit at Route E8 of the East Coast Expressway. The trip takes 7 hours and 30 minutes and covers 565 km.\n\nThirdly, you can drive along scenic coastal highway route 3, but it will take longer. Along the way, you see many unspoiled kampongs and beaches. Do not drive this route during the monsoon season, as heavy rain may cause flooding on the highway and road closures.\n\nGetting To Pulau Redang By Bus\n\nA bus/coach ride is one of the most convenient and effective ways to reach Kuala Terengganu. You will not get tired of driving and will have plenty of energy to enjoy the island. You can easily find your way around Kuala Terengganu once you arrive. Typically, express buses and luxury coaches will make one or two stops along the way for refreshments and restroom breaks. The bus journey is convenient and comfortable.\n\nMost travellers prefer to take the night coach from KL and get there early enough to go downtown for breakfast before boarding their first boat at 9 am. Buses from interstate destinations will arrive at Kuala Terengganu Bus Station (MPKT Hentian) downtown. The Shahbandar Jetty, from which regular public ferries depart for Redang Island, is about five minutes walk from the main bus station.\n\nHowever, if you’re heading to Merang Jetty, you’ll have to take the SP Bumi Bus or the MyBas T102, which operates every hour from 6 pm to 730 pm. Tickets can be purchased at the KT bus station counter for approximately RM5 to RM10. You can also take a taxi/grab from KT to Merang for about RM60. Travel time to Merang Jetty is about 45 minutes.\n\nBus from Kuala Lumpur to Kuala Terengganu\n\nKuala Lumpur (KL) is well connected to Kuala Terengganu by buses and coaches. The bus journey takes 7 hours and covers 450 kilometers, and One-way tickets cost between Rm43 and Rm50.\n\nIf you are coming from KL city center, you will need to go to Terminal Bersepadu Selatan (TBS) Bus Terminal, the main hub for long-distance buses. There are several ways to get to TBS from KL city:\n\na) LRT Sri Petaling Line to bandar tasik selatan ( BTS) station\n\nb) KTM Komuter Train to Bandar Tasik Selatan ( BTS)\n\nc) KLIA Transit Train to BTS Station\n\nd) RapidKL Bus Route 690 -Pudu Sentral – TBS – Hang Tuah Station\n\ne) Taxi or E-hailing rides like GrabCar.\n\nOnce you arrive at the TBS station via LRT, KTM, or KLIA transit, you must walk across a pedestrian bridge about 5 minutes to reach the main building of Terminal Bersepadu Selatan (TBS). Level 3 is the main lobby, where you will find the ticket counter.\n\nTips: Plan your return journey by getting your return ticket in advance.\n\nCheck online tickets: KL – Kuala Terengganu Bus Schedule\n\nBus from Penang to Kuala Terengganu\n\nBuses and coaches from Penang to Kuala Terengganu depart from either Sungai Nibong Bus Terminal or Komtar Penang.

One-way tickets can cost between Rm48 and Rm60.\n\nCheck online tickets: JB – Kuala Terengganu Bus Schedule\n\nBus from Singapore to Kuala Terengganu\n\nAlternatively, you can book coaches (usually 27 seater buses/VIP coaches) that offer a direct journey from the city centre to Kuala Terengganu, and the pick-up point is at Golden Mile Complex, Beach Road.

If you are adventurous and have a lot of time, you can take KTM Intercity Rail, which KTMB operates. It runs from Gemas in Negeri Sembilan to Tumpat in Kelantan.\n\nOnce the train arrives at Tanah Merah, you must travel overland to Merang Jetty, about 110km away, and takes about 1 hour 45 minutes. You can also stop at Wakaf Bharu ( Kota Bharu) Station or Kuala Prai and travel overland for 2 hours to Merang.\n\nKuala Lumpur to Tanah Merah/ Kuala Prai/ Wakaf Bharu\n\nIf you are from KL, take the train from KL Sentral to Gemas then to Tanah Merah/Kuala Prai/Wakaf Bharu. The train ride from Gemas to Tanah Merah takes about 11.5 hours.\n\nPenang to Tanah Merah/Kuala Prai/ Wakaf Bharu\n\nUnfortunately, there is no direct rail link between Penang and East Malaysia. Trains are not a very good option if you’re from North Malaysia. Alternatively, you can take the ETS KTM train from Butterworth, Penang to Gemas via KL, which takes approximately 6 hours 35 minutes. You can then take the train for 11.5 hours to Tanah Merah.\n\nJohor/Singapore to Tanah Merah/ Kuala Prai/ Wakaf Bharu\n\nFrom Southern Malaysia, you can take KTM Intercity, which departs from Johor Bharu Sentral, at Bukit Chagar.
