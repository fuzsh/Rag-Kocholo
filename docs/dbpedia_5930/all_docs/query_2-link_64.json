        "text": "Sunway Lagoon is a huge theme park located in Subang Jaya, Selangor, Malaysia. The park consists of 5 interesting adventure zones which are the Amusement Park, Water Park, Extreme park, Scream Park and Wildlife Park. In total, Sunway Lagoon houses more than 80 exciting attractions.\n\nSunway Lagoon operates daily. The admission ticket pricing are as follows;\n\nAdult (12 years old >) RM150\n\nChild (11 years old <) RM120\n\nSenior Citizen (60 years old >) RM120\n\nHowever, with the presentation of MyKad (Malaysian Identification Card) and the Sunway Pals card/mobile app; the prices will be discounted to RM96 for an adult ticket, RM69 for a child ticket, while Senior Citizens could play for free with 1 paying admission ticket. Sunway Pals mobile app could be downloaded for free on both Apple Store and Google Play while Sunway Pals card could be applied for free at the ticket counter. For more information on the pricing of necessities at Sunway Lagoon, click here.\n\nFood-wise, it is never a problem at Sunway Lagoon. Local delights and Western cuisines are all available. Foods catered for vegetarians and seafood-eaters are also accessible. People looking for some hot fried chickens, burgers or sandwiches could head on to fast food restaurants such as Subway, Burger King and Marybrown. There are also stalls that sell mini delights such as crispy spring rolls and hot dogs. You may also get ice cream!\n\nNow, to the main point;\n\nWays to go to Sunway Lagoon from KL Sentral\n\nKL SentralからSunway Lagoonに行く方法\n\n1. Taxi from KL Sentral to Sunway Lagoon/Sunway Pyramid\n\nThe easiest and least complicated way to go to Sunway Lagoon would of course be by taxi. This is because there are no direct LRT/KTM Komuter train connection from KL Sentral to Bandar Sunway. However, this method of transportation would be the most expensive in this list.\n\nTaxis are conveniently available at the main entrance of KL Sentral\n\nTaxis are conveniently available at the main entrance of KL Sentral (opposite to Hilton Hotel). Nonetheless, it is recommended for you to download the GrabTaxi app on your gadget before you depart KL Sentral. This app will allow you to get taxi around -not just Malaysia but also Singapore, Phillipines, Thailand, Vietnam and Indonesia easily. It will also show you the indication of how much your taxi fare will be based on the distance of your journey.\n\nThe distance between KL Sentral to Sunway Lagoon is approx. 15km. The fare for a budget taxi (regularly red-white/red-blue in colour) ranges from RM23 to RM35 while the fare for an executive taxi (commonly blue/black in colour) ranges from RM38 to RM53. Do note that taxi fares depend on the traffic condition and also the time of day. The heavier the traffic, the more expensive the fare gets as duration of journey increases. Taxi rides after 12AM midnight will have a 100% increase in fare, which means double the regular fare.\n\nHowever, despite the regulation of taxi services must be fared based on the taxi meter system, taxi services at some hot spots around Kuala Lumpur do not follow this law. This includes taxi services at KL Sentral. Which means, the fare indication based on meter provided by the GrabTaxi app is useless at KL Sentral (and some other hot spots) UNLESS- you strictly state to the taxi driver that you want to pay your taxi fare based on the taxi meter system -But if things don’t go your way and you couldn’t get a taxi that uses the taxi meter system at KL Sentral, you will need to get your taxi coupon from the taxi coupon counter at the main entrance, nearby the taxi stand in order to book a taxi. Taxi coupon for a budget taxi ride from KL Sentral to Sunway Lagoon/Sunway Pyramid costs RM29.\n\n2. KTM Komuter Train + Taxi from KL Sentral to Sunway Lagoon/Sunway Pyramid\n\nSunway Lagoon can also be reached by 2 methods of transportation; KTM Komuter train and Taxi combined together. Firstly, take the Port Klang (Pelabuhan Klang) Line KTM Komuter train from KL Sentral Station (KD01) to KTM Setia Jaya Station (KD08). The KTM Komuter train departs about every 15-30 minutes and operates from 6.00AM to 11.00PM daily. Setia Jaya Station is 7 stations away from KL Sentral Station and the journey will take about ±20 minutes.\n\nThe KTM Komuter train fare from KL Sentral Station to Setia Jaya Station is RM2.60 per person. KTM Komuter train tickets could be purchased at the KTM Komuter train ticket counter beside the entrance of the KTM Komuter train platform.\n\nUpon arriving KTM Setia Jaya Station, take a taxi to Sunway Lagoon/Sunway Pyramid. Taxis are accessible at Setia Jaya Station. The distance between Setia Jaya Station and Sunway Lagoon is approx. 6.5km. The taxi fare from KTM Setia Jaya Station to Sunway Lagoon for budget taxis ranges from RM10 to RM15 while the taxi fare for executive taxis ranges from RM16 to RM23.\n\nThis is fairly more economical compared to a direct taxi ride to Sunway Lagoon from KL Sentral but on contrary, it consumes more time.\n\n3. LRT Train + Taxi from KL Sentral to Sunway Lagoon/Sunway Pyramid\n\nAnother alternative to Sunway Lagoon is by taking LRT train and then followed by a taxi ride. Firstly, take the Kelana Jaya Line LRT train from KL Sentral Station (KJ15) to Kelana Jaya LRT Station (KJ24). Kelana Jaya Station is 9 stations away from KL Sentral Station and the journey would take about ±18 minutes (LRT trains are faster than KTM Komuter trains).\n\nThe LRT train fare from KL Sentral Station to Kelana Jaya Station is RM3.40 per person. LRT train tickets (chips) could be purchased at the ticket machine provided, as well as the Monorail train and BRT bus tickets.\n\nUpon reaching Kelana Jaya LRT Station, take a taxi directly to Sunway Lagoon/Sunway Pyramid. Taxis are available at the Kelana Jaya Station or you could simply get a taxi using the GrabTaxi app. The distance between Kelana Jaya Station and Sunway Lagoon is approx. 10km. The taxi fare from Kelana Jaya Station to Sunway Lagoon for a budget taxi ranges from RM14 to RM21 while the taxi fare for an executive taxi ranges from RM22 to RM31.\n\nThis alternative is rather similar to the earlier method of taking the KTM Komuter train and taxi. However, the differences are as follows; LRT trains are easier to access compared to KTM Komuter trains as LRT trains are easily available every 5-10 minutes while KTM Komuter trains are only available every 15-30 minutes. Moreover, The distance between KTM Setia Jaya Station to Sunway Lagoon is approx. 6.5km while the distance between LRT Kelana Jaya Station to Sunway Lagoon is approx. 10km. Hence, the taxi fare to Sunway Lagoon from KTM Setia Jaya Station is relatively cheaper compared to from LRT Kelana Jaya Station.\n\n4. LRT Train + Rapid KL Bus from KL Sentral to Sunway Lagoon/Sunway Pyramid\n\nYou may also go to Sunway Lagoon/Sunway Pyramid by taking the LRT train and then the Rapid KL bus. Firstly, take the Kelana Jaya Line LRT train from KL Sentral Station (KJ15) to Pasar Seni LRT Station (KJ14). Pasar Seni Station is only 1 stop from KL Sentral Station and costs only RM1.20.\n\nUpon reaching Pasar Seni LRT Station, head down to the Bus Platform by using the stairs or the elevator.\n\nBuses that head to Sunway Pyramid (Subang Jaya/Subang Mewah) are Rapid KL Bus 641, 770, 771 and BET3. The buses are available at the platform every ±20 minutes and the journey takes about an hour.\n\nThe fare of the buses are RM3 per person and the payment should be made to the driver on board the bus itself. Touch&Go and Rapid KL cards are also accepted. For more information on these buses and their routes, click here and proceed to ‘Lebuhraya Persekutuan’.\n\nAs it suggests, this mean of transportation to Sunway Lagoon/Sunway Pyramid is considerably cheap but consumes a whole lot of time. Hence, it is recommended for watarimonos to use other methods available that are more convenient and less complicated.\n\n5. KTM Komuter Train + BRT Bus from KL Sentral to Sunway Lagoon/Sunway Pyramid\n\nThe last alternative to Sunway Lagoon would be by taking KTM Komuter train and the BRT Bus. Firstly, take the Port Klang (Pelabuhan Klang) Line KTM Komuter train from KL Sentral Station (KD01) to KTM Setia Jaya Station (KD08).\n\nUpon arriving KTM Setia Jaya Station, simply climb up the stairs and head to the walkway on your right which leads you to BRT Sunway-Setia Jaya Station.\n\nGet your BRT ticket to BRT Sunway Lagoon Station from the ticket machine provided. The ticket to BRT Sunway Lagoon Station costs RM2.30 per person. Leisurely wait at the platform and hop on board as the bus arrives every 4-8 minutes. BRT Sunway Lagoon Station is 2 stops from BRT Sunway-Setia Jaya Station and would take about only ±5 minutes.\n\nWhen you have arrived BRT Sunway Lagoon Station, simply make your way directly to Sunway Lagoon/Sunway Pyramid using the provided walkway.\n\nIn my opinion, this method is the most convenient. This is because it is one of the most economical among all other alternatives. The total fare for the KTM Komuter train ride and the BRT Bus ride is only RM 4.90 per person. Moreover, it is also the most comfortable. BRT Buses are very clean and perfectly air-conditioned while the KTM Komuter train is also decent. Taxis on the other hand might not be as perfectly air-conditioned and may also be stuffy and not comfortable (particularly budget taxis). Lastly, BRT Buses has its own special route excluded from the traffic. This would ensure that you will reach your destination comfortably, in a very short time."
