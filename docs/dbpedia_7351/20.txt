As name implies, American Football is an American game of football. It is also called Gridiron outside of the US, while itâs commonly called just football in the US. American Football is different from the popular world sport generally known as football or soccer (Association Football). The sport evolved from the sport of rugby football. A game of American football was first played on November 6, 1869 between Princeton and Rutgers.

American football is a full-contact sport, and is all about running, with either team holding or passing the ball and trying to reach into opponent's goal area to score points.

Two teams with 11 players per side play on a rectangular field. This field is 110 m long and 48.76 m wide with goalposts at each end.

The ball shape is a prolate spheroid ("oval"), unlike the round ball of some other football sports.

The game is played over 60 minutes, which is further divided into two halves of 30 minutes in professional games. For the safety of players, the minimum requirement is to wear a football helmet and shoulder pads.

American Football is played throughout the world, but significantly in North America, Europe and Japan.
