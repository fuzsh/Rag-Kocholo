        "text": "Linguistically speaking, Football is an ambiguous term.\n\nConsider it this way: when you ask who is the most important player in football, Americans will answer ‘the Quarterback’ and Europeans will answer ‘the Striker or Forward.’\n\nConfusing, right?\n\nThere is no Forward in America’s version of football and there is no Quarterback in Football that is played in the European nations. So, the term soccer is more apt at times to refer to Association Football.\n\nThis is why it is important to learn and understand the difference between American Football and Soccer, which also goes by the name football, or you might get caught up in the constant linguistic tug-of-war on the usage of the two terms.\n\nIn case you are wondering, here is the reason why football is called soccer.\n\nSo, let’s begin.\n\nDifference between American Football and Soccer.\n\nFootball or Soccer is the most watched and well-liked sport in the world, drawing in over a billion spectators worldwide.\n\nAll You Need To Know About The History Of Football (Soccer).\n\nHowever, in America, there is another which takes the crown of the most popular sport. Yes, you guessed it right. It is American football.\n\nThis is getting confusing now, let’s dive straight into the differences between the two sports."
