I know that each team is given a certain number of game balls to prepare for each game, so I am guessing they rub them up or something... however their quarterback likes. But even if they put something on them, I can't get over how much darker they are than the NFL \"game ball\" they sell in stores. And it is EVERY team. When you watch on TV, some of the balls they use seem to be so dark you can barely read the \"Wilson\" and \"Duke\" marks on them. And I know it isnt just TV lighting or anything... I bought a game used football from the Packers and it is way darker than any other NFL football I have seen in person.\n\nDoes anyone know what product teams use on these balls to get them game ready that makes them so dark? Or is there another reason they are so dark?\n\nFrom a NY Times article:\n\nWhen Eli Manning drops back to throw his first pass Sunday against the Dallas Cowboys, the football in his hands will be as familiar as an old friend.\n\nThat is because the ball has been scoured, scrubbed, soaked and seasoned, a breaking-in process that takes months and ensures that every ball used by the Giants in a game will meet Mannings exact preferences. The leather will have been softened, the grip enhanced and the overall feel painstakingly assessed.\n\nThere are no new balls thrown around in an N.F.L. game. A new ball, despised for its sheen and waxy gloss, is as popular as a late hit.\n\nFor every N.F.L. game, each team has 12 to 20 balls that it has meticulously groomed and prepared according to the needs of its starting quarterback. The balls, brushed and primed using various obvious and semisecret techniques, bear the team logo and are switched out from sideline to sideline depending on which team is on offense.\n\nIn the case of the Giants, preparing the game balls used from September to December begins in summer training camp.\n\nThe Giants will start with six to seven dozen new footballs. Sorting through them, Skiba and his brother, Ed, the assistant equipment director, will give each ball a once-over.\n\nIll know as soon as I pick up a ball whether it could be a ball that Eli might like some day or whether its a ball hell never like, Ed Skiba said.\n\nThe Skibas, who grew up in Paramus, N.J., have been with the Giants since the 1990s, serving myriad quarterbacks. Manning, like most, knows what he wants in a football.\n\nI want a brand new ball that feels like its 10 years old, Manning said Wednesday. You want it to feel like its been in your house for 10 years, where youve been playing Saturday afternoon games with it for a long time.\n\nI want it broken in but it should still have nubs on it. The process has gotten better as weve changed some schemes and techniques. Weve honed in what works.\n\nThe Skibas explained the Giants procedure.\n\n■ The new ball is rubbed vigorously for 45 minutes with a dark brush, which removes the wax and darkens the leather.\n\n■ Next, a wet towel is used to scour the ball until the balls outer surface is soaked through.\n\nYoure not done until the ball is waterlogged and water will no longer bead on it, Ed Skiba said.\n\n■ While the ball is wet, it is brushed again.\n\n■ Then the ball is taken over to an electric spin wheel, where it undergoes another high-speed scrubbing.\n\nAt this point, the ball is put aside overnight. Then the process is repeated twice over the next couple of days.\n\nAbout five days after it was removed from its box, the ball might go into the rotation of footballs used in a Giants practice. The goal is to get the new balls banged around, thrown and dropped in the grass and dirt. The players rough up the ball and sweat on it, which helps the aging.\n\nIn practice, various balls are in varying stages of being broken in  curing like a pigskin  and all the while, the Skibas are feeling the footballs, waiting to see if one might qualify for Mannings special bag of footballs.\n\nYoure always looking for pearls, chasing after the perfect one, Joe Skiba said. Meanwhile, every ball Eli is practicing with feels very much like the game balls. So theyre candidates, too. Sometimes hell turn around and flip one to me and say, Thats a good one. Sometimes, he wants me to throw a ball away, too.\n\nAnd we never let him throw a ball in a game that he hasnt already thrown in practice and liked."
