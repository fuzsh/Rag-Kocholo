        "text": "The goal of football? It’s pretty simple: to outscore the opposing team. Players score points in football by getting the ball across the goal line into the end zone, either by throwing and catching the ball, running it in or kicking it through the field goal posts for a field goal.\n\nA standard football field is 120 yards long, rectangular in shape, and can be made of grass or turf. The field of play is a little more than 50 yards wide and exactly 100 yards long, with two 10-yard end zones on either end. These end zones are the scoring areas on the field — each team attempts to score by carrying the ball into the end zone (either by running or catching).\n\nJust beyond each end zone are field goal posts, through which the team can kick field goals (more on this below). The goal line is the line on the field that separates the end zone from the field of play.\n\n“When the football crosses the goal line, by a throw or run, that is worth six points and is known as a touchdown,” said Colton Korn, director of player personnel at Liberty University, a Division I National Collegiate Athletics Association (NCAA) program in Lynchburg, Virginia. For context, Division I is the top level of intercollegiate sports, as defined by the NCAA.\n\n“Following [a touchdown], you can kick an extra point, worth one point, or you can go for a two-point conversion, where you basically have to score a touchdown again but from the 3-yard line,” Korn said.\n\nNote: In the National Football League, two-point conversions are taken from the 2-yard line, and extra points are kicked from the 15-yard line.\n\nIf a team is unable to score a touchdown in four downs (more on that below), on the fourth down, they can kick a field goal through the goal posts, which is worth three points. “Any kick must go through the uprights to count for points,” Korn said.\n\nAnother way a team can score points (while on defense) is by tackling a player of the opposing team in their end zone. If the offense is in possession of the ball and gets tackled in their own end zone, this is known as a safety, and it’s worth two points for the team on defense.\n\nFootball begins with a kickoff, with special teams lines from both teams on the field. The team that kicks the ball off will be playing defense, while the receiving team plays offense. The receiving team catches the ball at kickoff and tries to run it down the field as far as they can before being stopped (either tackled or run out of bounds) by the kicking team. After the kickoff play, the respective offensive and defensive lines come onto the field for both teams.\n\nNote: The receiving team may also get a touchback, which is when they catch the ball in the end zone and take a knee, or when the ball is kicked beyond the end zone. When this happens, the offense automatically starts their drive down the field at the 25-yard line.\n\n“The offensive team has four chances or plays, known as ‘downs,’ to gain 10 yards,” Korn said. “As soon as 10 yards are gained, even if it’s on second down, it resets the downs so the offense again has four chances to gain another 10 yards.”\n\nAt the beginning of each play, the teams line up on opposite sides of the line of scrimmage, the imaginary line that separates the offense from the defense. The play starts when the center snaps the ball to the quarterback. The quarterback can then hand off the ball for a running play to gain yards or throw it to a teammate to catch it and run downfield to the end zone.\n\nThe goal of the defense is to stop the offense from getting 10 yards in four downs by tackling ball carriers, breaking up passes, or intercepting passes. The defense can also cause the offense to “fumble” or drop the ball, and then the defense can pick up the ball themselves and play an offensive role by running it toward their end zone for a change in possession and — if they’re lucky — a touchdown.\n\n“If the defense succeeds and the offense is unable to get the 10 yards, the offense can punt the ball away on fourth down to the other team, or they can decide to go for it and try to get the remaining yardage in a passing or running play,” Korn said. “However, if the offense goes for the remaining yardage on fourth down and doesn’t get it, the other team will start with the ball where it is.”\n\nAnother option on fourth down is for the offense to try to kick a field goal if they’re close enough to the end zone for three points (versus the six they would score for a touchdown). The ball changes possession after the offensive team:\n\nAttempts a field goal\n\nFails to convert (aka earn a first down or score) on the fourth down\n\nScores a touchdown (and attempts the extra point or two-point conversion)\n\nThe winner of the game is the team with more points when time runs out.\n\nIf the score is tied at the end of the fourth quarter, overtime will typically begin. The specific rules of overtime vary at different levels of play and in different leagues."
