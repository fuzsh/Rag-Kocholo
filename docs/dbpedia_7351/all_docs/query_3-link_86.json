        "text": "How big is an American football ball?\n\nOfficial NFL guidelines dictate that balls should be 11 to 11.25 inches (27.94cm - 28.58cm) long and have a weight of 14-15 ounces (396.89-425.24g). A regulation NFL ball should also have a long circumference (circumference along the length of the ball from side to side) of 28 to 28.5 inches and a short circumference (measured vertically around the middle of the ball) of 21 to 21.25 inches.\n\nWhat shape is an American football?\n\nAn American football is a prolate spheroid. Balls are designed using a prolate spheroid shape as it makes them easier to tuck under the armpit and run with.\n\nWhy is an American football shaped the way that it is?\n\nEarly American football balls were made from inflated pig's bladders, often wrapped in a leather skin casing. These early balls were rounder than the balls used in the NFL today and more like a plum shape than a prolate spheroid. Accounts from the time do not make it completely clear why the ball became narrower at the ends, although many people believe that, as the game of American football is based on a combination of Association Football and rugby, the shape was inspired by the oval rugby ball.\n\nThe rugby ball got its oval shape accidentally in 1870 when the manufacturers switched from pig's bladder innertubes to rubber ones which were significantly more pliable. As the rules of American football moved away from the rules of rugby, the balls were designed to be narrower at the ends to allow for longer throws - giving the ball the shape we know today.\n\nWhat pressure should an American football be?\n\nThe NFL guidelines stipulate that balls need a pressure of 12.5-13.5 psi (86.2-93.1 kPa). The best way to measure this is with a ball pump with a pressure gauge.\n\nWhere can I buy American football balls?"
