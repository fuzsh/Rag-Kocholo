        "text": "Was just watching some Barry Sanders highlights, often times Sanders would carry the ball in his right arm even when streaking up the left sideline. I know lots of RBs will switch the ball to their outside arm when they have an opportunity, but it looks like Barry frequently chose to just carry the ball in his right arm.\n\nIs switching the ball something coaches want you to do, or is it just something some RBs prefer? I always assumed it was the former, for several very apparent reasons... but maybe that was an incorrect assumption. Did Barry get away with it cause he's Barry Sanders and it didn't matter what arm he carried the ball in, or is it not as common as I thought?\n\nWhen i coached, i would coach kids to carry it in the outside arm on the sidelines. Middle of the field, use the arm you're more comfortable with.\n\nBut generally i didn't harp on it too much. Mostly it's instinctual to keep the ball away from the defender.\n\nIt's correct to carry from the outside arm when running along the sideline for two main reasons.\n\n1. If you fumble, there's a much higher chance of it going out of bounds and you not losing the football.\n\n2. You can't stiff arm someone with your arm that's basically hovering out of bounds since no defender is coming from that direction.\n\nBasically there's no reason not to do rather than lack of discipline.\n\nTake Barkley, go to the play at 3:20\n\nIf he's carrying that in his left arm, he can stiff arm the defender, but Barkley always carries in his right arm.\n\n2 hours ago, Chiefer said:\n\nI can hear my granpa yelling at the TV now.\n\n\"Dont carry it like a loaf of bread you idiot!\" Haha\n\nYears ago I sent this guy, Peyton? Clayton?- a fan letter telling him he would never make it carrying the ball like a loaf of bread. He ended up doing okay, I guess, but I always think back to \"what might have been\"!\n\nI always carried it in my right arm when I played. I never felt like I had it secured in my non-dominant hand. It's not an issue to me. If you have a good squeeze, it doesn't matter what arm you have the ball in. My left arm was my stiff arm, my right arm/shoulder was my truck shoulder.\n\nGenerally speaking, you carry it in your outside arm, but it comes with a feel for the game and football smarts. If you are in traffic or surrounded by guys, don't go switching hands. If you are breaking away, switch hands so you can stiff arm and create broken tackles. Running in the middle of the field requires both hands on the ball when in a crowd.\n\nArian Foster was always a smart runner when it came to which hand to carry it in. He put a lot of work into ball protection after early fumble issues\n\nTo switch arms, you have to be 100% positive that someone isn't going to be able to close on you quickly while you are switching hands. Obviously the ball is more susceptible when being switched.\n\nThe thing that I never really got is why don't any RBs cover the ball with both arms when running at the goal line (mostly for power backs that are just looking to plow forward)."
