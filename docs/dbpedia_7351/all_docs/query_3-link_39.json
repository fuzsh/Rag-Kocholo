        "text": "Football season is only a few months away. Although NFL is far from popular overseas, it is an essential institution in the United States. Despite passing concerns about game violence and rowdy fans, American football has remained a much-loved sport that is growing in fandom every year. Most people do not need a reason to love the NFL. But for those who do, here are ten.\n\n1. NFL is a piece of popular culture\n\nNFL is so engrained in our country that it is all over our popular culture. From “The Longest Yard” to “Remember the Titans”, scores of movies have been centered around football. Most of these films are stories about triumph over adversity—a beloved theme in the American narrative. In addition, some of the most memorable commercials of all time such as the Bud Light “Superstition” ads were designed to run during the football season.\n\n2. NFL is part of American tradition\n\nOn Sundays, we watch football. And on Mondays at work or school, we talk about the game. Sunday Night Football is a weekend tradition. Every Sunday during football season, fans across the country will gather to watch a game regardless of who is playing. It is the same with Thanksgiving. For most Americans, Thanksgiving will not be complete without playing a game of football or watching the holiday games with your family.\n\n3. NFL fosters relationships\n\nRelationships are built through the love of the NFL. Parents and children stay in on a Sunday to watch a game together and friends can find a reason in their busy schedules to meet up. From jeering at a bad referee decision to throwing your hands in the air after an exceptional field goal in fourth down, watching a game with others offers the full camaraderie experience. Football can help you to meet new people too, as fans will strike up a conversation with others sporting their team memorabilia.\n\n4. Tailgating is fun\n\nWho does not love tailgating? Tailgating is where football lovers fire up the grill and share food and drinks with other fans in stadium parking lots before a game. At stadiums such as Arrowhead, the barbecue haze is an essential part of the pre-game experience. Gates to sports stadiums often open more than four hours before the main game to allow fans and tailgaters to pick their favorite spots and set up camp for the day.\n\n5. People love watching talented athletes\n\nTalented athletes are a joy to witness in any sport and the NFL has an exceptional amount of talent in every game. While many sports have one or two famous players in a team, NFL teams feature a wide variety of players who use their diverse abilities to perform incredible athletic feats. Players can run down the field carrying twice their body weight or throw a football eighty yards to win the game at the last minute.\n\n6. League parity keeps things interesting\n\nThe NFL has one of the strictest salary limits of all the major leagues and subsequently one of the most competitive parities. Unlike other sports where certain teams can pay astronomical salaries to ‘buy’ a team of big-name players, NFL teams are more balanced. The league parity of the NFL is designed to enable any team to win based on skill. This keeps the game fair and interesting and gives fans of any team a real hope for the trophy.\n\n7. NFL hits hard\n\nFootball is a fast-paced game that pulls no punches. Players do not roll around on the floor grabbing their ankles and calling for penalties every ten minutes. Few sports are as action-packed and exciting as the NFL. From a linebacker in ferocious pursuit to the star quarterback driving his team down the field, NFL games are full of drama and athletic prowess that keep fans on the edge of their seats.\n\n8. NFL has the best sporting final\n\nEven people who do not watch sports watch the Super Bowl. It is undoubtedly one of the biggest sporting events in the world. The Super Bowl has been known to draw over a hundred million viewers from across the globe and has practically reached national holiday status in the US. In addition to the game, the Super Bowl Halftime Show adds to the enormity of the sporting spectacle.\n\n9. There is a chance to win big\n\nWhile not all football fans gamble on the games, the comprehensive structure of the NFL makes it extremely easy to place bets. The abundance of information and sites offering an online sportsbook help punters accurately gauge the odds and make predictions. Watching a game that you have a stake in can make it all the more exhilarating. You will be cheering the loudest on the grandstands when you and your team win big.\n\n10. Fantasy Football has real stakes\n\nFantasy Football is a competition where fans create imaginary teams of league players and accumulate points based on these players’ real-life performances. This keeps fans engaged and invested in the entire league and not just a single team. Fantasy Football has become a massive industry with millions of fans following players from various teams through the football season, adding another entertaining aspect to the game."
