        "text": "In each NFL game in the regular season and up to the Super Bowl, each team is supplied 108 balls per week. 54 of these balls are practice footballs and 54 are game footballs (Wilson.com). While this number seems incredibly high it makes more sense when broken down. Of the 54 balls 12 are designated kicker balls. While 54 are designated “game balls” only 24-36 are actually selected for use in games including kicking balls (Wilson.com).\n\nAfter the week of play if the ball is lightly used or in good condition it is kept by the team and used as a practice ball. If the ball has significant wear from either the game or week of practice than it is usually either disposed of, donated, or auctioned off.\n\nThe Super Bowl is the marquee sporting event of the USA. For this event it is a little different. 120 balls are used for the Super Bowl Instead of 54 (Wilson.com). This is because these balls sell for incredibly high value after the game.\n\nThis disposal process keeps the commodity running because there is constantly a need for more footballs for the NFL. Because of the very quick use and disposal rate of the NFL, the supply chain is kept in a high demand which allows Wilson to make a large profit and keep the 120 employees well paid. While it seems like a waste of materials to have such a short turn around of use and disposal, it is this turn around that keeps the business flowing. In addition to this the balls do not go to total waste.\n\nPhoto: Press Association"
