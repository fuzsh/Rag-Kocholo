        "text": "Materials: Football, Tissue\n\nYou watch football, you play football, but have you ever wondered why a football looks the way it does in the first place? The truth is that American football’s shape is the result of evolution (change over time) more than DESIGN (plan to make something). This PROLATE SPHEROID (egg-shaped) ball did not look like it does now in the early years of the game. American football has a rich history, and like its rules and the organization of the game, the shape of the ball has been MODIFIED several times over many DECADES.\n\nWhat’s the topic of today’s lesson? FOOTBALL\n\nWhen something changes over time, we say it ________________. EVOLVES\n\nThis PROLATE SPHEROID are the words used to describe the football’s ____________ SHAPE\n\nThe truth is that the American football’s shape is the result of evolution more than ____________ DESIGN\n\nName something about football – other than the shape of the ball – that has changed over time. ______________ RULES/ORGANIZATION\n\nThe shape of the ball has been _____________ several times over the years. MODIFIED\n\nWhat do you call a ten-year period? DECADE\n\nThe sport came about in the 19th-century (1800s) COLLEGIATE system in North America by combining rugby and soccer. The first American footballs that northeast colleges used were made out of inflated pig BLADDERS due to their semi-round shape, DURABILITY (strong), and easy ACCESSIBILITY (easy to get.) In order to increase the lifespan of the ball, the pig bladder was ENCASED (covered) in CALFSKIN, sewn together, and laced tightly through eyelets to seal them up. These were also known as PIGSKIN balls, even though they were made with the bladder, not the skin of a pig.\n\nDuring what century did football begin? 19TH CENTURY/ 1800s\n\nName one of the two sports that were combined to make American football. RUGBY/SOCCER\n\nThe first American footballs were made out of pig ______________ BLADDERS\n\nName one of the qualities that made pig bladders a good choice for footballs in the 19th century. SEMI-ROUND SHAPE/ DURABILITY/ ACCESSIBILITY\n\nTo make a football, what were the pig bladders encased in? CALFSKIN\n\nWhat is a calf? BABY COW\n\nWhat were the first footballs called? PIGSKINS\n\nWhen pig bladders were first used, the balls were mostly round, similar in shape to traditional balls. It is said that the shape changed from round to OVAL as the result of an inter-collegiate football game between RUTGERS and PRINCETON in 1869. These two teams had to stop their game several times just to REINFLATE the football. This required reopening the leather encasing, reinflating the pig bladder, and sewing the encasing up again. The players got so WEARY (tired/Impatient) of this effort that they decided to continue playing with the semi-DEFLATED ball, which resembled more of an oval.\n\nThe shape of the football changed from round to _______________ OVAL\n\nName one of the college football teams in the game the text discusses. RUTGERS/PRINCETON\n\nIn what year was the football game the text refers to? 1869\n\nThe two teams had to stop their game several times just to __________ the football. REINFLATE\n\nThe players grew ______ of this effort. WEARY\n\nThey decided to continue playing with the __________________ ball. SEMI-DEFLATED\n\nIn 1905, the FORWARD PASS was added to the rules of football. The number of FATALITIES and injuries throughout collegiate football games was increasing, and organizers hoped that adding forward throws to the game would make playing football less DANGEROUS. This new rule which added the throwing of the ball, forced football creators to make the ball more AERODyNAMIC so it could be passed easily. When the changes were made, and the ball took on its prolate spheroid shape, it was much easier for the players to grip the ball with one hand and throw a perfect SPIRAL (spinning around a center point).\n\nWhat was added to the game of football in 1905? FORWARD PASS/FORWARD THROW\n\nThe number of ____________ throughout collegiate games was increasing. INJURIES/FATALITIES\n\nOrganizers hoped that adding forward throws to the game would make playing football less _______________ DANGEROUS\n\nFootball creators needed to make the ball more _________________ AERODyNAMIC\n\nName something that is usually designed to be aerodynamic. AIRPLANE, HELICOPTER, DRONE, CAR\n\nIt was easier for players to grip the ball with one ___________. HAND\n\nIt was also easier for the players to throw a perfect _________ SPIRAL\n\nVAKT: Show how the ball moves in a spiral\n\nVAKT: Try to throw a tissue and then throw a ball. Which is more aerodynamic?\n\nLook at the picture below. This is what players in the 1800s would wear to play football. What piece of equipment designed to protect players from serious injuries is missing? HELMET\n\nConcussions among football players are still very common. What changes could be made so they occur less often? Do you think people will support making changes in football so that it is safer? Why or why not?\n\nPlayers and organizers also found that the size and shapes of these original footballs were INCONSISTENT because every inflated bladder was different. So the inner pig bladder was replaced with vulcanized (chemical process) RUBBER, but its LEATHER encasing remained the same. The laces which were used to sew up the exterior encasing are still part of footballs today, but now they are there to help the players grip the ball. Overall, they kept the AESTHETICS (looks/appearance) of the ball the same, but they STANDARDIZED the ball’s shape and size.\n\nPlayers and organizers also were finding that the size and shapes of these original footballs were _________________ INCONSISTENT.\n\nThe pig bladder was replaced with vulcanized _____________RUBBER\n\nWhat do you call the material made out of animal skin? LEATHER\n\nThe stitching used to be to seal the encasing, but now it is there to help the players ____________ the ball. GRIP\n\nOverall they kept the _____________ of the football the same. AESTHETICS/APPEARANCE/LOOKS\n\nThe football makers ______________ (made it the same) the size and shape of the football. STANDARDIZED\n\nUp until the 1950s, all the balls that were used in the night games were white or had white stripes because there wasn’t much stadium lighting back then, and white game balls increased VISIBILITY. As stadium lighting improved, the NFL chose to use the stripe-less ball to DISTINGUISH itself from the business of college football. White stripes are still on footballs in college sports and other minor LEAGUES. Many people find the stripes helpful when they are learning proper hand placement to grip, throw and catch the ball.\n\nThey used white game balls at night because they increased _____________VISIBILITY\n\nThe NFL now uses a stripe-less ball to _______________ itself from college football. DISTINGUISH\n\nWhite stripes are still on footballs in college sports and other minor ______________ LEAGUES.\n\nMany people find that the stripes are helpful when they are learning proper hand placement to ______________ the ball. GRIP/ THROW/ CATCH\n\nVAKT: Point to the picture below that would be used in professional (NFL) football.\n\nThe official football of NFL is made by the WILSON football factory in Ada, Ohio. The factory isn’t AUTOMATED – as all the official game balls are HANDMADE by about 120 employees. The leather used to make the ball is sourced from cowhides from Nebraska, Iowa, and Kansas – it is then tanned with the company’s “Top Secret” football tanning procedure. The ball is made up of four pieces of stamped leather and a SYNTHETIC bladder. The ball has a PEBBLE GRAIN texture for enhanced grip and increased friction. The encasing is also hand-laced with a single piece of vinyl without any knots. The Wilson Sporting Goods factory produces about 4,000 footballs each day.\n\nWhat is the name of the company that makes the official football of the NFL? WILSON\n\nWhat state is the Wilson factory in? Ohio\n\nWhat do they call the process of turning animal skin into leather? TANNING\n\nThe footballs are not made with robots and computers; they are _____________ by people. HANDMADE\n\nFrom what state is the cowhide used in making Wilson footballs? NEBRASKA, IOWA, KANSAS\n\nThe Wilson factory refers to its tanning procedure as __________ TOP SECRET.\n\nThe Wilson football is made up of four pieces of stamped leather and a _____________bladder. SYNTHETIC\n\nHow does the text describe the texture of a football? PEBBLE GRAIN\n\nName one purpose for the pebble grain texture. ENHANCED GRIP/INCREASED FRICTION\n\nHow many footballs does the Wilson Sporting Goods Company produce per day? 4000/ FOUR THOUSAND\n\nCreative Writing\n\nWhy do you think people value handmade items over things that are made through automation? Is there anything you think should always be handmade?\n\nLike football, almost everything around us evolves over time. What kind of changes do you imagine you may see in sports in the year 2050?\n\nSource:\n\nhttps://mentalitch.com/the-history-of-the-football-the-actual-ball/\n\nhttps://www.sportsnhobbies.org/were-footballs-ever-made-of-pig-skin.htm"
