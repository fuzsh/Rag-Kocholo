        "text": "Touchdown\n\nA touchdown is worth six points and is the most common way to score in football. A touchdown is scored when a team either carries the ball into the opposing team’s end zone, catches a pass in the end zone, or kicks the ball through the opponent’s goalposts.\n\nThe team in possession of the ball needs to move the ball forward by at least 10 yards while they are on the offense. They have 4 chances, or downs, to do so. If they manage, the count resets and now they get another four downs to push the ball another 10 yards.\n\nIf the offensive team didn’t manage to move the ball after 4 downs, a turnover, or a change in possession of the will happen, and the team which previously defended will now be on the offense and vice-versa.\n\nExtra point\n\nAfter a touchdown, the scoring team has an opportunity to score one or two more points. They do this by kicking the ball through the goalposts from anywhere on the field. The extra point is worth 1 point, referred to extra point.\n\nFor this extra point after the touchdown, the offensive team might attempt to advance the ball again into the end zone, similar to a touchdown. This would be worth 2 points.\n\nSafety\n\nA safety is worth two points and is scored when the opposing team commits a foul in their own end zone or when the ball carrier is tackled in their own end zone.\n\nNow that you know how American football works, tune in to your favorite team’s next game and enjoy! Understanding the game will make it even more enjoyable. And who knows, maybe you’ll be inspired to become a player yourself!"
