        "text": "A rugby ball and American football are really popular all around the world. More and more people enjoy playing these games. However, do you know there are some differences between a rugby ball and American football? We would like to share the differences with you.\n\nOrigin of rugby and American football\n\nThe origin of rugby in England traced back to the 19th century or even earlier. In the 1800s, formalities were introduced to football rules in the seven major public schools of England. Handling the ball was permitted in football in the early 1800s when players were allowed to take a mark and then a free kick.\n\nHowever, American football originated from various early \"football\" sports popular in public schools in England in the mid-19th century and is a direct evolution of rugby. Walter Camp, the father of American football, proposed in 1880 at the National Conference on College Football Rules to turn Skran into a \"line of scrimmage\" - an offensive and defensive line, which made there no scramble before the ball, and since then, American football has embarked on a different development road than its origins.\n\nGameplay of rugby and American football\n\nRugby is best described as a blend of the contact of American football, the running of soccer, and the transition of basketball. It is a game played between two teams with 15 players in each, played on a rectangular field, with the object being to run with an oval ball across the opponent’s goal line or kick it through the upper portion of the goalposts.\n\nAmerican football is a game played between two teams and consists of 11 players in each of the two teams, with unlimited substitutions. American football is a game of intense physical play with a complex strategy to score points by advancing the ball to the opponent team’s end zone.\n\nBall of rugby and American football\n\nRugby is a prolate spheroid-shaped ball. The accepted international size is called the \"size 5\" and is approximately 27 cm long and 60 cm in circumference at its widest point and weighs around 1lb.\n\nAmerican football is about 11 inches (28 cm) long and about 22 inches (56 cm) in circumference at the center and weighs around 0.875 lbs. Besides, American football can be made of neoprene material which is suitable to play on the beach.\n\nCostume of rugby and American football\n\nTo prevent injury, American football players usually have steel helmets, shoulder armor, breastplates, shoulder pads, elbow pads, hip pads, knee pads, strand pads, hand guards, shin pads, etc., and a pair of wireless headphones must be added to the helmet.\n\nHowever, a Rugby player’s costume is simple. They don't need to be covered in shoulder armor, just wear their usual shirts and stuff braces in their mouths. Therefore, the actions of rugby players will be more convenient.\n\nThere are two ways to score rugby, touchdowns, and shots.\n\nTouching the goal line with the ball, called a touchdown which scores 5 points. After the touchdown, the scoring team can also set a shot on the imaginary line perpendicular to the goal line at the touchdown point scoring 2 points. In addition, 3 points are awarded for a kick shot for a foul on one side and a drop kick shot during the game.\n\nThe American football score is divided into three types, touchdown score, shooting score, and safety score.\n\n6 points for touching the touchdown with the ball, and 1 point for hitting the goal after the touchdown. 3 points for shooting in progress.\n\nIn the opponent's scoring area, forcing the opponent into a dead ball is counted as a safety score and 2 points are awarded.\n\nAverage contact per game\n\nAbout American football, average tackles per game per player: 16. Average hit impact: 1600lbs of force (recorded from members of the LA rugby team by sports science) About rugby, average tackles per game per player: 4 with highest recorded at 4600lbs (by sports science), consistent contact away from the ball with downfield blocking with contact as severe as a tackle."
