        "text": "In North America, “football\" is called soccer in order to avoid confusion with American and Canadian football.\n\nIn ancient Greece people played episkyros, a game that consisted of kicking and throwing a ball on a defined field. A variation of the Greek game, harpastum was a ball game played in the Roman Empire. This version was much less structured than today’s soccer game and had somewhat unclear rules.\n\nInspired by cuju, kemari was introduced in Japan in the early 7th century. The objective was to keep a buckskin ball in the air as long as possible using only your feet.\n\nIn the French Middle Ages, soule, a combination of soccer and rugby with the objective of putting a ball into the opponent's cage, was a very brutal sport where almost any blow was allowed.\n\nAt the end of the 15th century, calcio fiorentino emerged in Italy. The object of the game was to carry a round ball into the opponent's net. Because there were almost no rules, matches were often stopped because of a burst ball or serious injuries.\n\nDuring medieval times, soccer balls were usually made from the bladder of a pig or other animal, and filled with straw or inflated with air."
