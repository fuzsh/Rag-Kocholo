        "text": "Flag football is one of the five additional sports proposed by the LA28 Organising Committee for inclusion at the Olympic Games Los Angeles 2028, pending approval from the International Olympic Committee (IOC) at their session in Mumbai (October 2023).\n\nThe final event programme and number of athlete quotas in the additional sports will be finalised in the future.\n\nA variant of American football or gridiron, flag football has never previously appeared at an Olympic Games. It was a demonstration sport at the 2022 World Games in Birmingham, Alabama where the United States won men’s gold and Mexico defeated the hosts in the women’s final.\n\nSeven-time Super Bowl-winning quarterback Tom Brady played flag football from elementary school through to his first year at high school.\n\nWhat is Flag Football and how is it being played?\n\nAs in American football, the aim of flag football is to advance up the field via a series of offensive plays into the opposition’s defensive endzone.\n\nIt is a non-contact sport with 'tackles' made by removing one of two vinyl 'flags' attached to the ball-carrier’s waist - one on each side.\n\nPlay starts at a team’s own five-yard line with the centre snapping the ball back to the quarterback who either passes the ball forward to try and find a receiver, or hands off to a running back.\n\nThe play is over when either a flag is removed, the ball-carrier goes out of bounds, or a forward pass hits the ground.\n\nEach team has four attempts - known as downs - to reach the halfway line. If successful, they have another four downs to reach the endzone and score a touchdown. If unsuccessful on either count, the ball is turned over to the opposition who start on their own five-yard line.\n\nTurnovers also occur due to interceptions - when a defender catches a ball intended for a receiver - and fumbles, when the ball-carrier drops the ball and a defender collects.\n\nIn flag football, no running plays are permitted when the offensive team is five yards or less from the endzone.\n\nAfter a touchdown, which is worth six points, teams go for an extra point - by running or passing - from the five-yard line, or two extra points from the 10-yard line.\n\nA flag football field measures 70 x 25 yards (45.7m x 22.86m) including 10 yards (9.1m) allotted to each of the two endzones."
