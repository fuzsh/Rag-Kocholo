        "text": "The offensive line\n\nThe role of the offensive unit is to advance the football down the field, either by running with the ball or throwing it to another player in the offensive line, with the ultimate goal of scoring a touchdown. The offensive line consists of several players whose primary function is to block members from the defensive line from tackling the ball carrier. With good technique and the understanding of how to block members from the defensive line, the offensive line will be able to make enough room for the ball carrier to run, catch or throw the ball.\n\nThe defensive line\n\nThe role of the defense is to prevent the offense from scoring by tackling the ball carrier. The defensive line can stop an attack from the offence by pushing the ball carrier off the field, tackle him to the ground or steal the ball. A successfull defensive team is good at both tackling and stealing the ball from the opponent, as well as following the strategy and tactics chosen by their coaches.\n\nA well-oiled machine\n\nAmerican football is often referred to as the most complicated of all team sports. Each part of the game rely on careful planning of strategy and tactics, and although itâ€™s the athletes who perform the plays, the coaching staff is highly involved during the game. Unlike other sports where the coach has somewhat limited impact during a match, the coaches in American football are important pieces on the sideline with different roles specialized for the different players on the field."
