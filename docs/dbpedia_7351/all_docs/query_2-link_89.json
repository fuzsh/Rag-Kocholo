        "text": "On the Sunday night of the AFC and NFC championships, hours after the Broncos beat the Patriots and the Cardinals shut down the Packers, the lights were burning at 217 Liberty Street in Ada, Ohio. Located at that address is the factory where Wilson Sporting Goods makes regulation NFL footballsâ€”4,000 a day, 700,000 a year. But on that Sunday night, a core group of Wilson's craftspeople were working on the year's most important batch: the 200 balls (100 per squad) that would be sent to the teams bound for the Super Bowl."
