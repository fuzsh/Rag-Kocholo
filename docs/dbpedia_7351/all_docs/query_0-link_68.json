        "text": "This game is flat out fun pick up and just play while not being overly complicated and without being super realistic. Is has that older feel to it where the game is fun to play and doesnât feel like a simulation like how madden has gotten. Also their are no stupid card system which is amazing Iâm so sick of having player card packs shoved down my throat.\n\nThis game isnât a cash grab either which I also enjoy and your actually able to play it on the phone. Thank you for making a game and I wish the dev team the best in the future this game has the fun feel to it which games are missing in my opinion in todayâs gaming industry. Keep up the good work and donât sell out to the casino type slot machines most other games have.\n\nMy one suggestion and yeah I know everyone has a million ideas they think are brilliant but in the future if you make another version of this game or update this one you should put in a career mode for your created team of some sort and heck even a created player. Itâs hard to be like invested when your playing bowl games into your team. Like I personally enjoy upgrading my team and playing an actual season mode and progressing as long as you donât combine that with the cash grab you guys have an amazing game your formula is on point. Thank you for this game I needed something like this.\n\nA lot of people are mad at this game for passing and running challenges and stuff but I think this game is great! (TBH they probably just arenât that good at the game).Anyway although I donât have difficulty with passing the teams without training or making a pass I do have a few problems I hope you can solve. The first most annoying problem is if the ball goes out on kickoff,All of the players crowd the ball against your will and the only way out Even if YOU are the one receiving is a force out whistle which gives the other team the ball. Another annoying thing is that you canât change certain things like your helmet or socks individually or add a logo to the helmet. This next one is not a complaint but a suggestion. I think it would be cool to have a multiplayer mode where you could play with friends or play a random player online.(this would be a good chance to try to put in a collaboration with social media to add friends).My last and final complaint is that you show the bowls we canât play and when you finish all levels you basically have no choice but to redo everything, This might be where\n\nMy multiplayer suggestion would come in to make things more interesting.\n\nThese are all suggestionâs but this game is already amazing and an easy 5 stars Thank you for listening! ð¤©ð\n\nThis is what everyone wants madden mobile to be. This game is like axis football but more polished in gameplay. The developments are very smart. While many games have good graphics and are buggy and bad, this game is the opposite. The graphics are ok, and it is very fun. Easy to use. And you can even create a team (not choose players just a logo and colors and jerseys and stuff). This is what I wish axis football was like, and I believe axis football and this developer should make a game together because then it would be incredible. Good gameplay + good graphics = masterpiece. For now this is the best we got, and it is great. Definitely buy this, and understand that the graphics may be a bit strange. Just donât judge it on that. Very fun. A must buy for football fans and mobile gamers. EDIT : One note for devs, it is really easy to run by. I would try to make the AI smarter so that they can lead you and not just chase you. And you should be able to throw away ( AI and player ). Right now it is still great, just a bit easy to score on punts and even kickoffs."
