U.S. Census Bureau.\n\nAmerican football is a distinct type of football that developed in the United States in the 19th century from soccer and rugby. It requires teams to run, throw and kick an oval ball across a 100-yard field (91.4 meters), is unrelated to the game most of the world knows by that name, and which Americans call soccer. And even the American game has variants, as there are slightly different rules for the versions played by college teams, professional teams and Canadian Football League teams.\n\nFootball is played by school, college and professional teams and is one of the most popular American sports, attracting thousands of participants and millions of spectators annually. American football was made popular by teams representing colleges and universities.\n\nFor some of its history, professional American football was played within a single National Football League (NFL), although rival leagues did spring up as the game grew in popularity and the lure of television dollars emboldened competitors. In 1960, one such rival league, the American Football League (AFL) competed for premier talent. As the leagues contemplated a merger, they agreed to a single game each year between their respective champions. Because many collegiate football championships were known as \"bowls\" for the bowl-shaped stadiums that hosted them, one AFL owner referred to the new game as a \"super\" bowl. The name proved popular with the public."
