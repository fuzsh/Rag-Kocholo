        "text": "FIBO: What characterizes a professional football player?\n\nChristian Mohr: American Football players need athletic ability. They have to develop a lot of power in a very short time, but they also have to be able to deal with the explosive power of their opponents. Unlike many other team sports, the requirement profiles vary greatly depending on the position. Players who play in the center of the field are taller and heavier than players in the outside playing positions. But even the heaviest players need to be able to move quickly. American Football players require a lot of muscle and body mass, including protection. There are many changes of direction and unpredictable actions. A game lasts more than three hours in total, which means that players require a good and long ability to concentrate. But above all, they need explosive power and a good body feeling. I call this balance of movement. Despite all the changes of direction and the opponent's influence, they have to keep control and, in the best case, react with a powerful movement. That's not so easy.\n\nFIBO: How do players train for such high intensity and explosiveness?\n\nJim Tomsula: We train three times during the season, between two and a half and three hours. Each position group works through their tasks and later we bring them together and train as a whole. Tackles, physical collisions, are also trained. Not with the helmet, but with the shoulders. Even in a forceful collision, the players have to learn to stay up. We train the whole process up to the tackle to ensure player safety. And that's just the physical work on the field. The players probably spend two hours a night watching film of the recorded practice and talking to the coaches and their teammates.\n\nChristian Mohr: The basis of the training is strength training with general exercises such as squats, all types of jumps, throws, deadlifts and bench presses, etc. The training sessions are divided into heavy and dynamic sessions for the lower body and upper body. We use contrasts in training, that is, we combine a high use of force with an explosive movement. In American Football, it's all about the time factor. It's not about how long players can unleash a force if they have six seconds, for example, but how much force they can convert within a few milliseconds.\n\nWide receivers have to be able to run fast, but they have less physical contact with heavy opponents than running backs. The most demanding profile, however, is certainly the quarterback â€“ not because of the style of play and athleticism, but rather because of the mental component.\n\nFIBO: How do players create a healthy balance between training and regeneration?\n\nJim Tomsula: We have a physiotherapist who is also present at the training sessions and checks up on the players and treats them if necessary. Besides chiropractic, the players also use leg massagers and whirlpools for regeneration.\n\nChristian Mohr: I quite like to work with so-called 3-week wave periodization. This means that we increase the intensity for three weeks and then reduce the intensity and volume in the fourth week. In this way, we try to limit the effect of overtraining in advance. The off-season gives players enough time to recover. But players don't get through a football season without aches and pains. The length of the muscle also determines how long it takes to recover. If you're doing heavy, very deep squats, that's a different load than if the exercise is done with a smaller range of motion. Furthermore, we adjust the training if the intensity becomes too high.\n\nFIBO: Are there special nutrition plans for the players?\n\nJim Tomsula: Definitely, that's also related to regeneration, which we just talked about. The players know: They only get out what they put in. Therefore, players pay attention to what they eat and how much alcohol they consume. Most don't drink alcohol during the season. High protein and carbohydrate intake are elemental.\n\nChristian Mohr: The players receive nutrition plans from me via an app in which meals are suggested to them. They can also enter weight goals here and I can communicate with them directly via messages. They then track their diet for three to five days and we look at where there are still difficulties or what we can improve.\n\nFIBO: How do you motivate the team after a defeat?\n\nJim Tomsula: Motivation in the team depends on the composition of the team. The most important thing when choosing players for American Football is the mentality of the person, the appearance. Who is this person? Positive people with a special mentality, with a life energy, also reflect their actions. We all need to look at what happened on the field: what were the mistakes, how can we fix them? The players have to be able to deal with criticism and pull themselves together to attack the next opponent. But even with coaches, there are differences between yelling, screaming and teaching. So we want to teach and correct instead of yelling or screaming. That's my approach. And with good people, it's not as hard as you think."
