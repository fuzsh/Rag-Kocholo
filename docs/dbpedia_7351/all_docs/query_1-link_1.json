        "text": "Football for AllÂ®\n\nThere are lots of ways to play this great game. Some athletes are ready to jump in and stick with tackle or flag the rest of their life, while others need a step-by-step approach that bridges one way to play to another.\n\nThe Football Development Model makes it easier to get started. No matter your athlete's age, skill level or way they want to play, there's an option for them that meets them where they're comfortable.\n\nThese options are called Game Types and Game Categories. These give organizations and athletes new entry-points to the game along with a gradual progression of added complexity and competition. This approach offers many paths to play, many ways to develop and many reasons to stick with the game.\n\nMORE ENTRY POINTS\n\nFootball is America's favorite sport, but it's played in a lot of different ways.\n\nOrganizations that implement the model and these Game Types are offering more options for the athletes in their community and are providing athletes with more reasons to stick with the game.\n\nSKILL PROGRESSION\n\nBy taking a step-by-step approach to development for every football skill, proper fundamentals become easier to teach and learn.\n\nThrough our Game Types and resources, skills can be taught and learned in a way that is developmentally appropriate for the athlete, improving their understanding.\n\nUSA FLAGTM\n\nNON-CONTACT\n\nAthletes can experience many of the positions and skills of football in Non-Contact, often on smaller and shorter fields with fewer athletes. Our resources help coaches teach proper tracking skills to help athletes excel while preparing for versions of the game with more contact later in life.\n\nLEARN MORE"
