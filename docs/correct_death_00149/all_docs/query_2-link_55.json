        "text": "MY NEW SALON COMPANION I first learned about salons while reading Marcel Proust's and Honoré de Balzac's best known works. Salons must have been delightful ways to pass the time for the intelligentsia of old. Until recently, I wished there were salons like the ones Proust and Balzac wrote about where I live. (For all I know, there are several of them, and I've just never been invited.) After spending a few weeks doing some elevated chatting with ChatGPT-4o, asking it curveball questions that I would only pose to other people who've read all the books I've read, I find myself longing for salons less. ChatGPT-4o would be a star contributor at most salons. This morning, I asked my new salon companion to tell me which three people influenced William Shakespeare's understanding of human psychology most. ChatGPT-4o, seemingly extemporaneously, gave me an answer that I would expect to get at the finest salons. \"Literary critic scholars often point to several key influences on William Shakespeare's understanding of human psychology. Three figures frequently highlighted are: 1. Seneca Seneca, the Roman Stoic philosopher and playwright, had a significant influence on Shakespeare's depiction of human emotions and psychological states. Seneca's tragedies, known for their intense emotions, moral dilemmas, and exploration of the darker aspects of human nature, provided a framework for Shakespeare to explore complex psychological themes. The influence of Senecan drama is particularly evident in Shakespeare's tragedies, such as \"Hamlet\" and \"Macbeth,\" where themes of revenge, madness, and inner turmoil are prominent. 2. Geoffrey Chaucer Geoffrey Chaucer, often referred to as the father of English literature, profoundly impacted Shakespeare’s understanding of human psychology through his detailed character studies in \"The Canterbury Tales.\" Chaucer’s ability to capture a wide range of human behaviors, motivations, and social interactions provided Shakespeare with a rich source of psychological insight. Shakespeare’s characters often reflect the same depth and variety found in Chaucer’s work, showcasing a nuanced understanding of human nature. 3. Michel de Montaigne Michel de Montaigne, the French Renaissance philosopher, and essayist, influenced Shakespeare’s exploration of the human condition through his introspective and skeptical approach. Montaigne’s essays delve into personal reflection, the complexity of human behavior, and the relativity of truth and morality. Shakespeare’s characters, such as Hamlet, often engage in profound soliloquies and introspective monologues that echo Montaigne’s philosophical inquiries into the nature of humanity and self-awareness. These three figures provided Shakespeare with a diverse and rich foundation for exploring human psychology, enabling him to create characters and narratives that continue to resonate deeply with audiences.\" I couldn't have given a better answer as fast as ChatGPT-4o gave me its answer.\n\nUSING WEALTH, POWER, AND PRESTIGE TO INCREASE DIVERSITY I've discussed the moral argument Julie Herzog makes in the post below dozens of times with dozens of people who have good intentions. Like many successful diverse professionals, I've tried to help several institutions diversify their membership, diversify their leadership, diversify their workforce, diversify their suppliers, or diversify their panelists or speakers at their conferences or training events. I'll share two secrets that I've shared with other pro-diversity colleagues who have worked with me on various committees and task forces that were assembled to help diversify the institutions to which we lent our time and talents after those institutions, for years or generations, made it clear that they didn't consider increasing their diversity to be a moral or business imperative. 1) Institutions compete for wealth, power, and prestige. 2) They'll only act as though increasing their diversity is a moral imperative if doing so will significantly increase their wealth, power, or prestige or if failing to do so will significantly decrease their wealth, power, or prestige. It's easier to make millions of extra dollars than it is to persuade most large institutions to act as though increasing their diversity is a moral imperative. It's easier to persuade most institutions to increase their diversity in exchange for receiving a million of your dollars than it is to persuade them to do it because it's the right thing to do. The easiest way to increase diversity in any institution that has refused to do it so far is to follow two steps. 1) Accumulate a lot of wealth, power, or prestige. 2) Demand that every institution that wants to leverage your wealth, power, or prestige to increase its wealth, power, or prestige increase its diversity. When institutions ask you what will happen if they don't increase their diversity, you can respond: \"I'll boycott you and encourage everyone who wants to leverage my wealth, power, or prestige to do the same.\" Large amounts of wealth, power, and prestige are the only assets that most institutions are willing to change their behavior for. The hard way to inspire institutions to change their ways is to repeatedly make moral appeals. That doesn't work. The institutions that still lack diversity have shown you they don't value it as much as you do and they don't care about what you think about it. Institutions trade in wealth, power, and prestige. If you have enough of one of these assets, you can persuade some institutions to invite more diverse professionals to speak at their conferences or panels, to serve on their corporate boards, or to serve in their c-suite offices. If the institutions you've asked to diversify haven't done it despite your pleas, it's probably because they've decided they're willing to lose your business to maintain their status quo. And they might be wondering why you haven't gotten their message and started your boycott.\n\nSIDING WITH MARSHALL I enjoy studying Thurgood (his mother named him Thoroughgood) Marshall's pre U.S. Supreme Court Justice years more than I enjoy studying what he did after 1967. His rise to the Supreme Court has a fascinating political backstory. To summarize, President Lyndon B. Johnson handpicked and groomed Marshall for the job. No one, not even the most powerful Southern segregationists, could stop Johnson from making Marshall the first of three. Marshall knew Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. very well. They had many legal, philosophical, political, strategic, and tactical conversations about the civil rights movement to which they dedicated and for which they risked their lives. They agreed on the big picture goals. They disagreed over strategy and tactics. \"Despite common beliefs in American democracy and integrationist goals, King and Marshall disagreed over tactics. Rather than civil disobedience and demonstrations, Marshall favored legal remedies as more efficient and effective. “I used to have a lot of fights with Martin about his theory about disobeying the law. I didn’t believe in that.” Marshall recalled. “I thought you did have a right to disobey a law, and you also had a right to go to jail for it. He kept talking about Thoreau, and I told him … ‘If I understand it, Thoreau wrote his book in jail. If you want to write a book, you go to jail and write it’.\" Marshall did acknowledge King as “a great speaker,” and conceded that the protests “achieved much. If you put them in the scale, they would weigh very heavy, because it reached people’s consciousness.\"' Marshall did not agree that disobeying the law was an effective way to change it. While Marshall believed the lawful, peaceful marches and protests that King spearheaded were very important to the civil rights movement, he also believed the work that would help African Americans most, the work that would endure, would be done through America's courts. Marshall believed in the power of lawsuits, jury trials, jury verdicts, appeals, oral arguments, and appellate decisions. He believed the U.S. Constitution, when interpreted correctly, proved the practices of bigoted segregationists, such as their Jim Crow laws and their \"Whites Only\" rules, were unconstitutional. To Marshall, marches and protests could be effective only if they influenced the political and moral consciousness of American voters. He had more faith in the tools of law and logic than he did in the tools of protest. If I could mediate a conversation with Marshall and King, I would ask them which one of the two did work without which the Civil Rights Act of 1964 would have never existed. Both men would argue that their work contributed to the law's passage. But I'd like to hear them debate whether one of them did work that made the law possible rather than merely more probable. At the beginning of their debate, I'd be biased in Marshall's favor. But I wouldn't make up my mind until after hearing King's argument.\n\nELEMENTARY, MY DEAR WATSON If you have called me your mentor, advisor, or counselor during the past decade, I recommend that you read this article about how Carlos Watson's Icarian flight ended. This predictable consequence is one of the reasons why I discuss ethics, your ethics and the ethics of those with whom you choose to do business, so often during our private conversations. Watson holds an MBA from Harvard and a JD from Stanford. Like many aspiring masters of capital, he did his time at Goldman Sachs before he went on to more ambitious pursuits. If you ever find yourself in a room with a boss or higher-ranking colleague who chooses to impersonate another executive to get an eight-figure deal across the finish line, you will know two things instantly. You made a mistake when you chose to work for that employer, no matter how much you're getting paid. If you stay there and continue to lend your talents to that employer, you are no better, ethically, than the person who committed the crime in your presence.\n\nON THE PROVERBIAL HAPPY LIFE If you study or strive to practice Christian ethics, you might recall the wisdom in Proverbs 6:16 through 6:19. It explains there are a few things God hates to see us do. \"There are six things the Lord hates, seven that are detestable to him: haughty eyes, a lying tongue, hands that shed innocent blood, a heart that devises wicked schemes, feet that are quick to rush into evil, a false witness who pours out lies and a man who stirs up dissension among brothers.\" People who frequently engage in some of these forms of misconduct are more likely to harm or limit themselves, their families, their communities, and their societies than people who don't. Their unethical conduct often makes happiness more elusive for the other people they influence. Unless I believe I can aid them by serving as one of their good examples, I steer clear of these kinds of unethical harmdoers when I can. I don't do it because I detest them. I do it because I don't want to help them profit from their misconduct. When I find someone whose morality is clearly more mature than mine, I'll often strive to spend more time around him or her. I learn from good examples. I always have. Seneca the Younger is my favorite Stoic philosopher. His old writings taught me a lot about how living a virtuous life and pursuing one's happiness are linked pursuits. In his essay \"De Vita Beata,\" which is Latin for \"On the Happy Life,\" Seneca explains what he thinks happiness is and how to achieve it. He argues that it is important to have an ethical role model—someone who exemplifies moral virtue—to guide one’s own ethical development. We are not born virtuous or with ethical maturity. It is a developed trait, cultivated through years of consistent effort and reflection. Without good examples to model our ethics after, we will be misled by false virtues or superficial markers of success. Seneca argues that our ethical role models help us cultivate a sense of humility and self-awareness. When we compare ourselves to people of higher moral standing, we are more likely to recognize our own shortcomings and areas for ethical improvement. This recognition creates a dynamic of continuous striving, where we look to refine our character and actions to align more closely with those of our ethical exemplars. Seneca also underscores the social dimension of ethical development. By aligning ourselves with virtuous role models, people in large groups or societies are more likely to form relationships and communities based on shared values and principles. This type of social environment reinforces ethical behavior and provides support and encouragement for it. It creates a network of accountability, where individuals will hold each other to high moral standards and collectively strive towards ethical maturity. My moral exemplars were and are essential to my pursuit of happiness. Grateful for their instruction by good example, I strive to be a good student and example.\n\nHOW COLORADO'S ENHANCE LAW ENFORCEMENT INTEGRITY ACT WORKS AFTER A BAD APPLE IS CONVICTED Colorado passed the Enhance Law Enforcement Integrity Act (ELEIA) in 2020. Many refer to the law by the number of the Senate Bill, SB-217. \"The Enhance Law Enforcement Integrity Act permits you to sue law enforcement officers directly when they violate your state constitutional rights and forbids officers from raising a defense of qualified immunity, but it does indemnify them from personal liability if they were acting in good faith.\" When Colorado law enforcement officers use deadly force to kill or severely injure community members, investigations ensue. Almost always, these investigations find that the law enforcement officers used deadly force justifiably, reasonably, and while acting in good faith. When the investigations find the officers used deadly force while acting in good faith, the officers are not charged or indicted for committing violent crimes. In Colorado, law enforcement officers who are found to have used deadly force while acting in good faith will not be indicted for committing criminal assault, murder, manslaughter, or negligent homicide. Under the ELEIA, if a law enforcement officer is indicted, prosecuted, and convicted for a violent crime after using deadly force to harm or kill a community member, that means a jury, after a criminal trial, determined that the officer was not acting in good faith while engaging in the conduct. Under the ELEIA, Colorado municipal law enforcement agencies have no legal duty to indemnify their law enforcement officers for their misconduct (or pay for civil claims or damages arising from that misconduct) after juries convict them. Generally, to hold municipal law enforcement agencies liable for their law enforcement officers' criminal acts, plaintiffs must prove the elements of a Monell claim. Monell claims are based on the decisions and holdings for a United States Supreme Court case named \"Monell v. Department of Social Services of the City of New York.\" See https://lnkd.in/gZYv-RRK. Monell claims that are brought against municipal law enforcement agencies seek to prove that their law enforcement officers committed their unlawful acts or crimes due to the customs, patterns, or practices of their employers. The ELEIA shields Colorado's municipal law enforcement agencies from being held liable in civil lawsuits if a rare bad apple commits a crime while wearing a badge and a jury convicts that bad apple. However, Section 1983 claims (see https://lnkd.in/gpMx7bTG) may still offer a civil plaintiff a mechanism by which to hold a bad apple's municipal government employer liable, despite the criminal conviction, if the plaintiff can prove the bad apple committed a crime as the fruit of a bad apple tree.\n\nCNN'S DECISION TO DISBAND ITS RACE AND EQUITY TEAM CNN's Race and Equity team was formed soon after George Floyd's murder, based on credible news reports. On July 10, 2024, CNN decided to disband the team and reorganize things internally. The team's mission will be absorbed by other parts of CNN. This sort of downsizing and reorganizing signals a change of focus. It signals CNN will be doing less of some things and more of other things. I expect to see fewer reports about the most severe civil rights deprivations in America, such as officer-involved shootings of unarmed Americans that deprive the victims of their lives, to make it to CNN's national news platform from here on. I expect to see fewer stories about efforts to meritocratically increase the percentages of highly qualified non-white males in high-ranking leadership positions for America's wealthiest and most powerful institutions. And I expect to see fewer reports addressing America's ongoing challenges with race-based institutional biases and bigotry. That's all more than unfortunate for the most recent victims and future victims of unjustified deadly force used under the color of law. It's also unfortunate for all the Black-American professionals who got great grades while getting their degrees and have excelled in their professions but won't be getting all the social capital-driven hook ups that their equally talented but better connected and better liked White-American peers will get. News media reveal more about their ethics by what they don't emphasize than they reveal about their profits motives by what they do emphasize. As the great and prescient American poet and singer, Bob Dylan, sang, \"the times, they are a-changing,\" (https://lnkd.in/gJTFq-dg) in America. They always seem to be changing, to me.\n\nINVARIANT BE Two decades ago, I completed a dozen or so linguistics courses, for grades. At the time, I was exploring my intellectual interests, trying to find out what I enjoyed and excelled at most, academically. I learned I was better at linguistics and philosophy than all the other subjects I studied for grades. Better than I was at management. Better than I was at military science. Better than I was at law. I grew up around a bunch of different dialects. Depending on which side of town I was in, and depending on the codes I needed to know or use, I would have to use between three and five dialects every day. I didn't appreciate the sophistication of the dialects I learned natively growing up in several cities in Los Angeles County. Until I studied linguistics. I completed all the core linguistics courses: morphology, phonetics, phonology, pragmatics, semantics, and syntax. I added courses in Latin, philosophy and language, philosophy of mind, and sociolinguistics to round things out. The course in sociolinguistics helped me understand how and why societies rank the prestige levels of languages and dialects. But the technical courses, the ones in semantics, syntax, phonetics, phonology, and morphology, made me prouder of my native dialects than any of my less linguistically savvy school teachers led me to believe I should be. I know how amazing the invariant be be. I know how much more effective speaking in what some linguists call African American English can be than limiting oneself to Standard American English's tense, aspect, and mood. The dialects I learned growing up gave me more tools to express emotion, more tools to build rapport, more tools to speak in code around folks who don't speak all the dialects I do. If you are interested in languages and dialects, this video is a great introduction to arguments that linguistics students learn while completing our core courses. It's also a great argument that explains why the dialects of African American English are more sophisticated, not less, when it comes to how effectively they can transmit tense, aspect, and mood between their native speakers.\n\nNOT LIKE US America's military attracts many more people who want to defend Americans against violent extremist groups than it attracts people who want to join them. American veterans swore and trained to defend our compatriots against violent groups, foreign or domestic, who would use force for political purposes. I know hundreds of veterans. Most of them are African Americans. More than a third aren't. Politically, they are all over the map. But independents are overrepresented compared with America's civilian population. Veterans are more likely to be loyal to America's institutions than loyal to one of America's political parties. Many of us dislike divisive American politics more than the average American. Most of us give politicians extra credit if they're veterans. Before I read this article, I presumed, correctly, that America's veterans are less likely to lend our talents to extremist groups that use the politics of force or fear than Americans who never served their nation as professional soldiers. I also presumed, correctly, that veterans are less likely to support extremist groups that want some Americans to have less liberty or happiness than others, like the extremist groups who hate some races, ethnic groups, or religious groups enough to want to physically harm them or deprive them of their civil rights. I was very disappointed when I learned some military veterans entered and defaced the U.S Capital on 6 January 2021 after law enforcement officers told them to stand down. Before they did that, I would have called those veterans my brothers and sisters. None of them should call me brother anymore. No veterans I know would try to stop America from doing its business using fear or force. When I talked with my fellow veterans about what we saw, none of us expressed fear. We don't fear America's extremist groups. We did express concern. We know what our military training equipped us to do better than the average American can. The thought of our fellow veterans, people who swore to defend America against all enemies foreign and domestic, threatening to use violence against our nation's elected representatives while they were doing the people's business concerned us. Not some of us. All of us. Neither I nor the veterans I know fear that any extremist group will ever take over America's institutions by force. Those extremist groups, if they want to make significant changes to America's institutions, are going to have to do it the hard way. They are going to have to persuade the majority of Americans to hate what they hate as much as they do using our nation's peaceful, democratic political processes. Veterans who join extremist groups and use force offensively against our fellow Americans are not like the rest of us. Those veterans are criminals, not patriots."
