        "text": "Why am I curious about Spinoza?\n\nI started to learn philosophy in the summer of 2020. Yes, the whole world was threatened by the COVID pandemic and lockdown regulation, international flights, and face-to-face social events were decreased dramatically. Some people began to think about the meaning of life or why do we live? I am one of them. By that time, I started to practice philosophical dialogue and to read articles written by western philosophers.\n\nI love to visit museums, but I did not have the knowledge and no interest to learn from the stories behind each nice object in the well-framed collections, I was in a psychological paradigm and only appreciated the beauty of art. Since I started to practice thinking, I slightly switched myself to the pragmatic paradigm to ask questions while visiting museums, and I have been curious about the philosopher’s life story and about the collections which are related to these thinkers.\n\nSpinoza is a well-known philosopher, and his museum is not far away from me, so I will have a small museum trip to learn about him better.\n\nWhat was he thinking about?\n\nBased on the information on the wiki, Baruch (de) Spinoza (24 November 1632–21 February 1677) was a Dutch philosopher of Portuguese Sephardic Jewish origin. One of the foremost exponents of 17th-century Rationalism and one of the early and seminal thinkers of the Enlightenment and modern biblical criticism including modern conceptions of the self and the universe, he came to be considered “one of the most important philosophers — and certainly the most radical — of the early modern period.”\n\nYou also can read more about the Philosophy of Spinoza on the wiki if you are interested.\n\nBenedictus de Spinoza’s philosophy encompasses nearly every area of philosophical discourse, including metaphysics, epistemology, political philosophy, ethics, philosophy of mind, and philosophy of science. It earned Spinoza an enduring reputation as one of the most important and original thinkers of the seventeenth century.\n\nSpinoza’s philosophy is largely contained in two books: the Theologico-Political Treatise, and the Ethics.\n\nWhere did he live and how can I visit these places?\n\nEarly life-\n\nBaruch Espinosa was born on 24 November 1632 in the Jodenbuurt in Amsterdam, Netherlands.\n\nSpinoza lived where the Moses and Aaron Church is located now, and there is strong evidence that he may have been born there.\n\nSpinoza was eventually able to relinquish responsibility for the business and its debts to his younger brother, Gabriel, and devote himself chiefly to the study of philosophy, especially the system expounded by Descartes, and to optics.\n\n*Micropia in Amsterdam\n\nLater life and career-\n\nSpinoza’s house in Rijnsburg from 1661 to 1663, now a museum (Vereniging Het Spinozahuis).\n\nSpinoza spent his remaining 21 years writing and studying as a private scholar.\n\nHe spent a brief time in or near the village of Ouderkerk aan de Amstel, but returned soon afterward to Amsterdam and lived there quietly for several years, giving private philosophy lessons and grinding lenses, before leaving the city in 1660 or 1661.\n\nIn Voorburg, Spinoza continued work on Ethics and corresponded with scientists, philosophers, and theologians throughout Europe.\n\nLens-grinding and optics- Spinoza earned a modest living from lens-grinding and instrument making, yet he was involved in important optical investigations of the day while living in Voorburg, through correspondence and friendships with scientist Christiaan Huygens and mathematician Johannes Hudde, including the debate over microscope design with Huygens, favoring small objectives and collaborating on calculations for a prospective 40-foot (12 m) focal length telescope which would have been one of the largest in Europe at the time.\n\nIn 1670, Spinoza moved to The Hague where he lived on a small pension from Jan de Witt and a small annuity from the brother of his dead friend, Simon de Vries. He worked on the Ethics, wrote an unfinished Hebrew grammar, began his Political Treatise.(Spinoza House in The Hague, where Spinoza lived from 1670 until his death in 1677)\n\nDeath-\n\nSpinoza’s health began to fail in 1676, and he died on 21 February 1677 at the age of 44. His premature death was said to be due to lung illness, possibly silicosis as a result of breathing in glass dust from the lenses that he ground. Burial monument of Spinoza at the churchyard of the Nieuwe Kerk (The Hague).\n\nIf you are not able to visit all places in person, you also can experience this journey via virtual walk."
