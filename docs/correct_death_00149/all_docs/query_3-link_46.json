        "text": "Baruch Spinoza was one of the most hated and reviled people of his time. Yet he was an unassuming, homely, polite, gentle, shy young man who earned a meager living as a lens grinder and lived a relatively short life. Bertrand Russell describes him as the “most noble and most lovable” of history’s philosophers.\n\nSpinoza lived in The Netherlands in the 1700s, and died at age forty-four, probably from cancer induced by prolonged inhalation of glass powder. During his lifetime only one of his two major works was published. Nevertheless, while alive he was in constant contact with many of the intellectual leaders of Europe, and was well known to the European intelligentsia. Through them he exerted an outsized influence on the new historical movement known as the Enlightenment.\n\nSpinoza was a Jew and grew up in the Amsterdam Jewish community. He was well grounded in Jewish scripture and received a thorough education in the liberal arts and science. He never hesitated to express his views which often went contrary to the doctrines that he was taught. When he was twenty four, the Jewish community in Amsterdam expelled him and formally anathemized him. That meant that the members of his synagogue, including his family, rose one-by-one, formally cursed him, pledged themselves never to speak to him again or even go near him. It was the classic hate and bigotry of those who can’t bear to see their views questioned, of those who can’t handle divergent perspectives, and will go to great lengths to prevent others from expressing them.\n\nFortunately for Spinoza, the government of the Netherlands in those days was the most tolerant in Europe, and left him alone to ply his humble trade as a lens grinder. Nevertheless, near the end of his short life the Dutch government under pressure from various religious groups, was becoming less and less accommodating. After Spinoza died, the government banned all his works. It was forbidden for anyone to own them, or to read them, or even to comment on them.\n\nWhy So Hated?\n\nIt is not surprising that European religious and governing authorities would despise Spinoza. Consider, for example, his “Theological-Political Treatise,” published during his lifetime. In it, Spinoza employed systematic reasoning to deny utterly the concept of supernatural phenomena or “miracles.”\n\nSpinoza’s argument is rather long, detailed, and intellectually rigorous, but to many people it was very compelling. In a nutshell, Spinoza saw everything that occurs as “natural” by definition, and always in conformity with almighty God’s laws of science and nature. So to Spinoza, the idea of “supernatural” is inherently contradictory, and really an affront to God. A miracle, according to Spinoza, is merely a natural phenomenon which at a given moment might still be unexplained. Spinoza interpreted the human tendency to attribute so many events to “supernatural causes” as merely an emotional fabrication to give emphasis and significance to the events being described.\n\nIn his “Treatise,” Spinoza also tackled the question of scriptural interpretation. He subjected Jewish and Christian scriptures to very rigorous analysis whereby he exposed what he thought were inconsistencies, untenable utterances, and unlikely assertions. He concluded that whenever scripture is taken literally and seems to go against logic and common sense, then the reader must consider such scripture only metaphorically and symbolically. It is a view that many hold today, but was a novel perspective in Spinoza’s day.\n\nSpinoza also believed that when studying scripture, one must take into account the era and cultural environment in which it was written, analyze the language of those times with all its subtleties and imperfections, and consider the intent and character of the author. In fact, Spinoza wrote at length about the deficiencies of different human languages and difficulties in translating them from one to the other. For example, using the most tightly-reasoned analysis, Spinoza was one of the first to conclude that it was impossible for Moses to have written the first five books of the Old Testament, although it was widely asserted to be true in Spinoza’s time. Spinoza also cast similar doubts on other scriptural narratives. We can say that Spinoza is the founder of the field of Biblical Criticism, in which many theologians and scholars engage today.\n\nYet, Spinoza believed that even when some literal portions of scripture are debunked as untenable, scripture can still convey a valid spiritual message. It is within the power of every person, Spinoza thought, to uncover such a message according to his own abilities, attitudes, reasoning and insights. Given Spinoza’s emphasis on different scriptural interpretations and his support of individual analysis, it is not surprising that he also supported free thought and free opinion. At the same time, Spinoza thought that that when humans moved from a free state of nature into social organization, there was a legitimate need for government, even if a given government might be faulty. For that reason, he opposed the idea of rebellion, even against defective government.\n\nIn fact, as a practical matter, Spinoza upheld the need for the state to be superior to any church, but he also denied that humans must subordinate all their rights to government. Spinoza saw democracy as the most obvious and most natural form of government, despite imperfections that might come from it. It is not hard to see how Spinoza’s views on scripture, on the supernatural, and on individual rights did not generally go over well in the Europe of the 1700s, even if his opinions did have a profound effect on the emerging intelligentsia who spearheaded the Enlightenment.\n\nSpinoza’s ‘Ethics’\n\nIf Spinoza’s “Theological Political Treatise” caused a major uproar, it was dwarfed by his second major work, “Ethics,” published after his death. Since Spinoza, was (as seen from his “Treatise”) a firm believer in logical deduction, he wrote his Ethics in much the same format that Euclid had used in antiquity in his Elements of Geometry, that is, by arriving at conclusions by means of theorems that he reasoned from initial propositions. By such rigorous deduction, Spinoza concluded that everything has to be the way it is, and that includes God himself. Such being the case, Spinoza denied the existence of any morality that has absolute concepts of “right” or “wrong.” In Spinoza’s view such attitudes are prejudices of the human mind. One particularly controversial consequence of Spinoza’s view is his rejection of prayer as a means of appealing to God, since everything that happens is a manifestation of God and simply must be the way it is.\n\nSpinoza explained that everything and everyone has a “mind,” whose goal is to continue its existence, and that individuals determine “right” and “wrong” in terms of their personal desires in that regard. In his treatment of both “substance” and “mind,” Spinoza seemed to endorse the ancient Platonic idea that all matter is composed of substance and essence (the latter being Spinoza’s “mind”), but Spinoza differed from conventional wisdom by denying that essence (or mind) can exist as a separate entity. In the 1700s, Spinoza’s rejection of Plato’s dualism went over like a lead balloon. Not only did it seem to attack the established religious belief of the immortality of the soul as separate from the body, but it was also seen as an attack on the whole academic community of Europe, which based much of its philosophy on Plato.\n\nCritics in Spinoza’s day dismissed him as essentially an atheist, but others saw him as a “God-intoxicated man (to quote an 18th-century poet) who happily saw God in everything). Spinoza’s view that nature and nature’s laws are an expression of God have often been described as “pantheism,” but that is inaccurate because pantheism means that everything actually IS God, which is not quite what Spinoza asserted. Still, many people insist that Spinoza was in effect an atheist since his view of the immutability of God seems to render God irrelevant to humans. On the other hand, one might view Spinoza’s writings as to God’s immutability as a very rigorous and thorough justification of the philosophy that God expressed in the Bible; that one should accept things and events, whether apparently good or bad, without any reproach whatsoever to God himself.\n\nSpinoza’s Influence\n\nDespite all efforts to discredit Spinoza, he is one of history’s most profound and influential philosophers. Spinoza’s views, and his very rigorous method of reasoning, greatly influenced some of the greatest European thinkers of Europe down to the present day, such as Leibniz, Hegel, Schopenhauer, Kant, Berkeley, Santayana, and even Albert Einstein who said that it was Spinoza who most influenced his own worldview.\n\nWhether one agrees or disagrees with Spinoza’s philosophy, it is safe to say that today many western attitudes regarding spiritual, ethical, and political matters can be traced to him. Right or wrong, he deserves his reputation as an early inspirer of humanity’s modern but still incomplete foray into rigorous and rational thought."
