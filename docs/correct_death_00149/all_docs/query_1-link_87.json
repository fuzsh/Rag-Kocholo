        "text": "Link from Part I: https://aurora-israel.co.il/baruch-spinoza-filosofo-neerlandes-de-origen-sefardi-hispano-portugues-parte-i/\n\nIn 1660 he moved to a house in Rijnsburg, a coastal town near Leyden, which is currently a museum dedicated to the philosopher and where he wrote his exposition of Cartesian philosophy, entitled Renati des Cartes Principia Philosophias (Descartes' principles of philosophy, PPC), with the appendix of the Cogitata Metaphysica (Metaphysical Thoughts), CM), published in the summer of 1663 (Latin ed.; the immediate Dutch version appeared in 1664); These were the only two works published under his name during his lifetime. Its impact was so great that it made its author famous, whose home began to be frequented by all kinds of figures from the Dutch Golden Age, including Huygens and Jan de Witt. It is also believed that it was then that he composed his Brief treatise on God, man and their happinessThere he began an abundant correspondence with intellectuals from all over Europe, especially one for fifteen years with Henry Oldenburg, a German diplomat who was in London and was one of the secretaries of the Royal Society. In the early 1660s, he also began working on his Tractatus de Emendatione Intellectus (Understanding Reform Treaty, TIE) ​ and in the most famous of his works: the Ethics (E), completed in 1675.\n\nIn 1663 he moved to Voorburg, near The Hague, where he frequented liberal circles and became close friends with the physicist Christiaan Huygens and with the mathematician and then head of government (raadspensionaris) Jan or Johan de Witt, who offered his help regarding the anonymous publication of his Theological-political treatise (TTP) in 1670, a work that caused a great stir for its criticism of religion. These diatribes against the TTP, and also the barbaric murder (they even ate part of his corpse) of his protector and friend De Witt in 1672 after the defeat of the Dutch army by the English, which was taken as a divine punishment because of the statesman's tolerance towards the unbelievers - a crime condemned by Spinoza with the pasquín Ultimi barbarorum, they convinced him not to publish new books as long as he lived; The works would circulate in copies without printing permission and in manuscript among his admirers. In the following years his isolation increased and, given the fear for his own life, at the beginning of 1673 he would negotiate “asylum in Livorno” with the Grand Duke of Tuscany through the mediation of the philosopher Lorenzo Magalotti.\n\nLast years\n\nFrom 1670 until his death he lived in The Hague. In 1673, Johann Ludwig Fabricius (JL Fabritius), professor of Theology, offered him a chair of Philosophy at his University (Heidelberg) at the request of the Elector of the Palatinate; Spinoza did not accept it, because, although he was guaranteed “freedom to philosophize,” he was required “not to disturb the publicly established religion.” The court of justice of the regime that emerged after the murder of Johan de Witt also prohibited, on July 19, 1674, the Theological-political treatise (TTP). An attempt by you to publish your Ethics in Amsterdam it was derailed by an unfavorable report submitted to the authority. He then conceived the project of making a Hebrew grammar, before undertaking a translation of the Old Testament into Dutch, although not even the attempts of that intention have reached the present day, frustrated by death. A year before his death he was visited by Leibniz, but he denied the meeting.\n\nDestroyed by tuberculosis, he died on February 21, 1677 at 44 years of age. He did not finish his Political treatise (TP). An inventory of his possessions made after his death included a bed, a small oak table, a three-legged corner table, and two small tables, his lens-polishing equipment, about one hundred and fifty books, and a chess board. November of that same year, his friends simultaneously published in Latin (posthumous opera, OP) ​ and in Dutch (Nagelate schriften, NS) ​ all the unpublished works they found, including their correspondence. The book was included in the Index librorum prohibitorum of the Vatican from the year 1679.\n\nThought\n\nEpistemology\n\nUnderstanding and imagination\n\nIn Spinoza, it is worth saying from the beginning, there is no dualism. That is to say: soul and body are not separate entities, but rather they are one and the same thing, but seen from different perspectives (E, III, p2, esc.). By hypothesis: if the soul could not think, the body would be inert and vice versa (idem). Soul and body are then the same, only that in the first term it is understood from the attribute of thought and in the second from extension (idem). That said, another issue to highlight immediately is that each organism as persevere in your being (E, III, p6), may or may not harm itself. In other words: it can decrease or increase its power to continue existing and to act (E, IV, p8). What favors you and is useful to you is good. What affects you and hurts you is bad (idem). It is implicit, but it is worth highlighting, that this good and this evil are relative for man, since it is he who judges which things are favorable to him and which are not, and may prefer between them (E, III, p9, esc. ): either wanting some or hating others (E, IV, p19, dem.).\n\nWith these considerations in mind, it can be said that the problem to be seriously considered is that of the possibility of true knowledge. Indeed - in a very superficial and concise way - it is assumed or presupposed that both fantasy and intellection (to speak with synonyms from time to time) determine what concerns them, that is, they establish their own limits. Without being excessively rigorous, imagination can be understood as anything different from understanding, and that keeps the soul in a passive or contemplative character (TIE, §84). On the contrary, understanding leads the soul to be able to act, which is why it gives it a character of activity (E, III, p3, dem.). To this extent, what is useful to us increases our power, which translates into elevating us and liberating us in a certain way - leaving aside the finite, for the moment - since it makes us watch over the eternal rather than the perishable ( TIE, §9).\n\nImagination is referred solely and exclusively to the body (TIE, §84), and it drags us to it with all its passions, which is why it leads us to suffer. And for this reason also, the love that it promotes towards real and singular things brings us closer to death, since they are insecure and uncertain goods by nature (Ibid., §9). Furthermore, its fictions are not produced by the subject as such, but rather arise from external causes that affect the body (Ibid., §84 and §82). Emphasizing, then, that imagination is the opposite of understanding, and that the common thread is the possibility and realization of an epistemology, some clarifications are necessary:\n\nImagination involves having confusing ideas, that is, partially knowing things that are a whole (TIE, §63). In other words, if we are wrong, if we are deceived about something, it is because we conceive it abstractly (Ibid., §75), that is, in a partial, mutilated way.\n\nAlthough Spinoza does in Treaty of the reform of understanding (TIE) the distinction between three products of the imagination and vague experience (fictitious, false and dubious ideas), in the Ethics (E) speaks only of inadequate ideas.\n\nThe more something is conceived in a more general way, the more it is imagined - it is shown confusingly -. And the more this same thing is conceived in a more concrete way, the more it is understood - it is revealed clearly - (TIE, §55). General is synonymous with abstract, isolated and even universal, one might say. At least in the specific context in which the issues have been presented.\n\nFrom the above it also follows that the less one understands, the more one can pretend, and vice versa (Ibid., §58).\n\nFrom abstract (universal) notions singular and real things cannot be deduced (Ibid., §80). So the imagination cannot properly account for existing things. The only thing it engenders is confusion, deception and doubt, and that is why not distinguishing it from understanding leads to terrible errors (Ibid., §87).\n\nThe abstract and universal interrupts the progress of understanding (Ibid., §99). This does not mean, by any means, that imagination is dispensable or that we should discard it. Fictions or fantasies are also knowledge, but confused, disordered, partial and isolated from their concrete reality. It is the first way of knowing (Ibid., §19), but, if we were left with our imagination solely and exclusively, we would not know anything thoroughly.\n\nUnderstanding, on its own, can be defined negatively. That is, remembering that its opposite is imagination, which we have just detailed. In this way, it should be immediately clarified that, with your effort, you achieve clear and distinct ideas - the opposite of confusing or inadequate - that are formed by the soul - instead of arising from the movements of the body (TIE , §91)-. Doubt has no place in understanding, it should be noted, because it arises from investigating things without order (Ibid., §80). And this would be another vital difference between imagination and intellection: the first knows partially (as we already explained), but the second knows concretely, clearly and truly, that is, it knows things by their first causes (Ibid., §70) . And, thus, Spinoza can say that the order of understanding must be in accordance with that of Nature (Ibid., §95 and §99), or, in his words: “The order and connection of ideas is the same as the order and connection of things” (E, II, p7). But if it is still not explicit why they should be differentiated, let the author himself clarify the relevance of the matter:\n\nWhen we do not distinguish between imagination and intellection, we think that what we imagine more easily is clearer to us, so we believe we understand what we imagine. Hence we put first what must be postponed, and thus the true order of advancing in knowledge is disrupted and no correct conclusion is reached.\n\nTreaty of the Reform of Understanding (TIE), §90\n\nSource: Wikipedia"
