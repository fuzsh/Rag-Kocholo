        "text": "Part one of a series.\n\nIntroduction\n\nWhere do socialist ideas come from and how were ruling ideas challenged in the first place? Marx and Engels began in the early 1840s, emerging from a European socialist milieu, itself only a few decades old. These pioneer socialists of all stripes recognised that they stood on the shoulders of earlier thinkers and writers, stretching back at least to the seventeenth century (1600s), to the period known as the Enlightenment.\n\nSeventeenth century Europe was not especially advanced by global standards. Some Europeans had begun colonising parts of Latin America, Asia and Africa, connecting international commerce with the abominable slave trade. Wage labour relations were only beginning to take off, and only in a limited number of European states, notably England. However the scientific revolution, associated with Copernicus, Galileo, Kepler and Newton began to transform the way human beings understood the universe and fuelled the technological changes that drove the industrial revolution. The dominant ideas of religion began to fracture through the various Protestant schisms from the Catholic church. Monarchical states also faced assault and in certain cases, overthrow, most spectacularly in the English civil war.\n\nThe Enlightenment began with reflections on science, philosophy and politics by Bacon and Descartes, followed by Hobbes, Grotius, Locke, Leibniz and other writers. In the eighteenth century came Voltaire, Montesquieu, Rousseau, Hume, Smith and Kant. Although in recent years, many of these thinkers have been challenged for their views on class, gender, race, sexuality, as well as colonialism, democracy and for retaining religion, there is little doubt that they produced a range of critical ideas necessary to challenge the established order.\n\nThe radical Enlightenment strand more closely resonates with modern socialist ideas. Philosophers such as Diderot, Holbach, Helvétius, Morelly, Raynal and Mably among others blazed the trail for atheism, materialism, democracy and republicanism. All however, were preceded by and owed a debt to the great innovator, Bento Spinoza.\n\nSpinoza’s life\n\nBento Spinoza was born on 24 November 1632 in Amsterdam, part of the United Provinces of the Netherlands. The Dutch Republic was established in 1588. Spinoza was the son of a prominent merchant in Amsterdam’s Portuguese-Jewish community. In the two centuries before Spinoza’s birth, the Spanish state forced Jewish people to convert to Christianity. Many were driven into exile to Portugal and then the Netherlands, despite conversion to Catholicism. Some Christians referred to conversos they suspected of still following Judaism as Marranos, or “swine”.\n\nSpinoza’s young life, although not especially poor for the time, was beset with strife. In 1638, when he was five, his mother died. In 1639, when Spinoza was seven, he was sent to the Talmud Torah Society school, remaining there until he was fourteen. It was once assumed that the young Bento (in Hebrew, Baruch) trained to be a rabbi, but documents discovered in the Amsterdam Jewish archives in the 1930s show he did not attend the highest class, or medras. Instead he went to work for the family firm. However by 1654, aged 21, Spinoza had lost his father, stepmother and sister in the space of three years. The business Spinoza inherited from his father was heavily in debt.\n\nAround 1654 or 1655, Spinoza began taking instruction in Latin from Franciscus van den Enden, a radical thinker who probably introduced him to Machiavelli, Hobbes, Grotius and Descartes. In mid-1655, Spinoza was still at least nominally an active member of the Jewish congregation in Amsterdam. Yet on 27 July 1656, the Portuguese-Jewish synagogue denounced “the evil opinions and acts of Baruch de Spinoza” and decreed that he “should be banned and separated from the Nation of Israel”. The herem vehemently railed against Spinoza. It concluded that “no one should communicate with him orally or in writing, nor provide him any favour, nor be with him under the same roof, nor be within four cubits of him, nor read any paper composed or written by him”. Spinoza, at 24 years old, was excommunicated from the Amsterdam synagogue.\n\nSpinoza remained in Amsterdam for five years, although he never reconciled with Judaism, nor Christianity or any other religion. He earned a living grinding lenses, an occupation that combined immediate financial needs with scientific interest. In 1661, Spinoza left Amsterdam for nearby Rijnsburg, where he began writing his book, Ethics. It is a myth about Spinoza that he was a recluse, a loner living in seclusion and working in a solitary manner on his philosophy. From what we know about his life, it appears he had several close and devoted friends, with many acquaintances and a lively, philosophically fruitful group of correspondents. In 1662, he completed his Tractatus de intellectus emendatione.\n\nIn 1663, Spinoza moves to Voorburg, outside The Hague. There Spinoza published his first work Renati Des Cartes principiorum philosophiae along with Cogitata metaphysica. The book was more than a summary of Descartes’s opinions. Rather it was a systematic rendering of Descartes’s ideas. By June 1665, Spinoza had nearly completed the draft of his Ethics. However by the autumn, Spinoza put aside the Ethics manuscript to work on his Tractatus theologico-politicus [Theological-Political Treatise], a task that would occupy the next three years of his life.\n\nThe first edition of the Theological-Political Treatise, though it was published in Amsterdam by Jan Rieuwertsz sometime in late 1669 or early 1670, bore on its title page a false publisher and place of publication: “at Hamburg, by Heinrich [Henricum] Künraht”. The author’s name did not appear at all. Spinoza left Voorburg sometime at the end of 1669 or early in 1670, moving to The Hague. The Theological-Political Treatise was regarded by Spinoza’s contemporaries as the most dangerous book ever published. The book laid the groundwork for subsequent liberal, secular, democratic and socialist thinking.\n\nAt some point in the early 1670s, Spinoza returned to his Ethics book. We do not know exactly how far Spinoza got before he put the Ethics aside in 1665, although it was a substantial draft. Consequently, we do not know how much of the completed work stems only from the 1670s.\n\nIn 1673, Spinoza was invited by Karl Ludwig, the Elector Palatine to accept a Professorship of Philosophy at the University of Heidelberg. He declined the offer. In 1674, the Theological-Political Treatise – along with various “other blasphemous books” was officially banned by the secular authorities in Holland. In 1675, Spinoza completed his Ethics, but after rumours of its atheistic content, held back the presses. He began working on his (unfinished) Political Treatise.\n\nIn the Ethics (Part IV, 67), Spinoza wrote that “a free person thinks of nothing less than of death, and their wisdom is a meditation on life, not on death”. However his health was deteriorating. On 21 February 1677, Spinoza died. His friends claimed that the cause of death was pulmonary tuberculosis, perhaps brought on by the silica in glass dust. Spinoza’s writing desk and its contents were spirited away to Amsterdam, where his friends laboured to publish his Opera Posthuma in Latin and then the Nagelate Schriften in Dutch. The title pages contained neither the publisher’s name nor the place of publication.\n\nHostile environment\n\nSpinoza was a very careful man – his signet ring was inscribed with the motto Caute, “Caution!” As his biographer Steven Nadler rightly argues, Spinoza was “hesitant about revealing the more profound and potentially troublesome aspects of his doctrines and their theological implications to people outside of the immediate circle of friends who had been reading the manuscript drafts all along”. Spinoza wrote his major works in Latin, hence “Benedictus”, the Latin version of his first name.\n\nSpinoza’s caution was warranted. Adriaen Koerbagh was another philosophical radical who published two books in his own name in Dutch. Koerbagh had visited Spinoza in Voorburg and had also been in contact with Van den Enden. In 1668, Koerbagh was arrested and tried. One member of the commission proposed that his right thumb was cut off, his tongue to have a hole bored through it with a red-hot iron, imprisonment for thirty years, with all of his possessions confiscated and all his books burned. After pleas from influential friends, Koerbagh was sentenced to ten years in prison, followed by ten years in exile and charged a fine of 4,000 guilders. He was conveyed to the harsh confines of the Amsterdam prison, usually reserved for violent offenders condemned to hard labour. Koerbagh’s health worsened rapidly during his confinement and in October 1669 – just over a year after being sentenced – he was dead.\n\nSpinoza’s anonymous Theological-Political Treatise was immediately denounced when published in 1670. Some of Spinoza’s one-time correspondents swiftly joined the fray. Willem van Blijenbergh wrote that “it is a book full of studious abominations and an accumulation of opinions which have been forged in hell”, while Lambert van Velthuysen argued that “his teaching destroys and completely subverts all worship and religion, secretly introduces atheism”. Mainstream Enlightenment philosophers were also unhappy. Hobbes claimed that the Theological-Political Treatise “cut through him a bar’s length, for he durst not write so boldly”. Leibniz called it an “intolerably impudent book”.\n\nReligious authorities were vehement. Jacob Thomasius, professor of theology in Leipzig wrote that it “ought to be buried forever in an eternal oblivion”, while Johan Georg Graevius, Professor of Rhetoric at the University of Utrecht, described it as “a most pestilential book”. The Synod of South Holland concluded that the was “as vile and blasphemous a book as the world has ever seen”. The Vatican’s censors placed the Theological-Political Treatise on its Index of Prohibited Books, as they did with his other writings.\n\nSpinozists\n\nSpinoza emerged as the supreme philosophical bogeyman of early Enlightenment Europe. Historian Jonathan Israel has exhaustively documented the importance of Spinozism and Spinosistes in Enlightenment discourse and its diffusion across Europe (Spinosisme in France, Spinozisterey in the German states). Spinozism was the prime adversary of received authority, tradition, privilege and Christianity. A Spinozist was demonised, an outcast, public enemy and fugitive.\n\nAlthough the radical Enlightenment remained largely a clandestine movement in the century after Spinoza’s death, his texts and philosophy were nevertheless circulated, read, discussed and disseminated. Thinkers such as Bayle, Diderot, d’Alembert, Helvétius and d’Holbach picked up and developed Spinoza’s themes.\n\nBayle’s article on Spinoza in his Dictionnaire historique et critique (1697) appeared to elevate Spinoza’s character, while ridiculing his metaphysics. Historians now take Bayle’s depiction as surreptitiously advancing a veiled Spinosisme while pretending to refute the miscreant. Similarly, Diderot’s entries on Spinoza and Spinozism in the Encyclopedia (1765) did much to spread the doctrine and challenge conventional wisdom, going beyond the mainstream Enlightenment.\n\nThe radical Enlightenment inspired by Spinoza made reason the only and exclusive criterion of truth. These writers rejected all supernatural agency, demanded equality for all humanity, freedom of thought, personal liberty, freedom of expression and a democratic republican politics. They inspired the best of the French revolution and the radicals that came in their wake. These are the forerunners of the socialist and our own Marxist tradition.\n\nPart II will summarise Spinoza’s revolutionary ideas.\n\nReferences"
