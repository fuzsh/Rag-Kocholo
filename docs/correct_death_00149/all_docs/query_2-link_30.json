        "text": "(1632–77). When asked about the value of his life’s work, Baruch, or Benedict, Spinoza replied, “I do not presume that I have found the best philosophy, I know that I understand the true philosophy.” The Dutch-Jewish philosopher met with tremendous resistance among many groups in his day, but his work provided one of the bases for 17th-century rationalism. He was strongly influenced by René Descartes, the founder of rationalism; and late in life he befriended Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, the other great rationalist of the time.\n\nSpinoza was born on Nov. 24, 1632, to a Portuguese family living in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. His parents were crypto-Jews—people forced by the Spanish Inquisition to embrace Christianity, but who secretly held on to their Jewish faith. In Amsterdam they became members of the Jewish community, and young Spinoza probably attended the local school for Jewish boys. After school he had lessons in Latin, several European languages, and other secular subjects.\n\nSpinoza began to discuss with his fellow students his skepticism about such religious doctrines as the authorship of the Pentateuch, or the first five books of the Bible, and the existence of God. The Jewish religious leaders in the city were worried that his heretical ideas might harm the Jewish community, since Jews were not yet accepted as citizens. Because Spinoza was unwilling to recant his statements, he was excommunicated in July 1656, and the civil authorities banished him from Amsterdam for a short time.\n\nBaruch Spinoza changed his first name to its Latin equivalent, Benedictus, and earned his living grinding lenses for eyeglasses and microscopes. In 1660 he moved to Rijnsburg, a small village on the Rhine River to practice his trade and read. Three years later he settled in Voorburg, near The Hague, where he worked on his Tractatus Theologico-Politicus. In May 1670 Spinoza settled permanently in The Hague. He continued to study and write, insisting on reasoned approaches to religion in his philosophy. He believed in one God, and that everything depended on God, but his view of a deity was so far removed from the philosophy that preceded him that some philosophers branded him an atheist."
