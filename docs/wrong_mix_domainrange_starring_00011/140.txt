Will Ferrell has been in two 0% movies, the first being 1999's "The Suburbans."

Rotten Tomatoes score: 0%

Ferrell has a small part as a homeless person in "Drunk Parents," which stars Salma Hayek and Alec Baldwin as a married couple on the verge of losing their house — so they decide to rent out their neighbor's house, which they're house-sitting, to make some quick cash.

After he's fired from his job on TV giving relationship and romantic advice, he's forced to backtrack through his romantic relationships.

Rotten Tomatoes score: 21%

In "Daddy's Home 2," Ferrell and Wahlberg return as Brad and Dusty, former rivals and current co-parents whose bond is put to the test when their fathers enter their lives at Christmas, with John Lithgow playing Brad's dad Don and Mel Gibson playing Dusty's dad Kurt.

"Gibson could scarcely hope to play a character more like himself if he landed the lead in The Mel Gibson Story," wrote Ryan Gilbey for The New Statesman.

Ferrell appeared in 2016 sequel "Zoolander 2," reprising his role as Mugatu.

Rotten Tomatoes score: 22%

Models Derek Zoolander (Ben Stiller) and Hansel McDonald (Owen Wilson) are thrust back into the limelight after a string of superstars are murdered. Ferrell returns as Zoolander's nemesis from the first film, Mugatu.

But when an upcoming merger with the NBA threatens to dissolve the Tropics, Jackie pulls out all the stops to bring in fans — and win some games.

David Ansen of Newsweek wrote, "The semi-funny 'Semi-Pro' is amiable enough, but you never feel there's much at stake."

Rotten Tomatoes score: 23%

"Zeroville" follows Vikar (James Franco) on his journey across '70s Hollywood, as he becomes more and more involved in the film industry. Ferrell has a small role as a big-time Hollywood producer, Rondell.

Rotten Tomatoes score: 24%

In a meta remake of the TV series, Ferrell stars as actor Jack Wyatt who wants to star in a revival of "Bewitched" as Darrin Stephens, and is looking for the perfect costar — enter Isabel Bigelow (Kidman), who is actually a witch, making her the perfect actress to play Samantha Stephens.

"Ms. Kidman and Mr. Ferrell are not an intuitive match, and the romantic side of the story is both half-hearted and half-baked," wrote Manohla Dargis for The New York Times.

Rotten Tomatoes score: 26%

One of the biggest flops of Ferrell's career is "Land of the Lost," in which he stars as "quantum paleontologist" Rick Marshall.

Kevin Hart trained Ferrell to "Get Hard" in 2015.

Rotten Tomatoes score: 28%

When James King (Ferrell) is arrested and sentenced to 10 years in prison, he asks his acquaintance Darnell (Hart) to train him for prison, assuming that, as Darnell is Black, he's been to prison — even though Darnell has no relevant experience. Seeing a chance to make some money for his family, Darnell agrees.

"For a movie that wants to send a message about privilege and prejudice, it displays a clumsiness and exemplifies a lot of the ignorance and thoughtlessness it wants to rage against," wrote Alex Abad-Santos for Vox.

Ferrell played a funeral director in the 2000 comedy "Drowning Mona."

Rotten Tomatoes score: 29%

"Who killed Mona?" is the leading question of "Drowning Mona." As Chief Wyatt Rash (Danny DeVito) learns more about Mona (Bette Midler) and her friends and family, the suspects keep piling up.

Ferrell has a small role as Cubby, the funeral director of the funeral home Mona's family uses.

"My problem was that I didn't care who killed Mona Dearly, or why, and didn't want to know anyone in town except for Chief Rash and his daughter," wrote Roger Ebert.

Until "Barbie," the highest-grossing live-action film of Ferrell's career was 2015's "Daddy's Home."

Rotten Tomatoes score: 30%

"It's predictable and often drearily formulaic fare, stretching what is essentially a single sketch joke to feature film length, with the specter of inevitable emotional resolution always lurking in the background," wrote Mark Kermode for The Observer.

Ferrell had a double role as Jesus and a popular high school student named Sky in 1999's "Superstar," also based on an "SNL" sketch.

Rotten Tomatoes score: 32%

"Superstar" is based on the popular "SNL" sketch starring Molly Shannon as Mary Katherine Gallagher, an unpopular if delusionally over-confident student at Catholic school. In the film, Ferrell plays the object of Mary Katherine's affection, Sky, and also appears to Mary Katherine in a vision as Jesus.

"I'm not in favor of protesting films on the basis of theology, but to picket them because they're boring could be an act of mercy," wrote Roger Ebert.

"The Internship," released in 2013, features yet another uncredited Ferrell cameo.

Rotten Tomatoes score: 35%

But the most surprising Ferrell cameo is in the 2020 "Impractical Jokers" movie, in which he's just a patron at a restaurant credited as Miami Restaurant Guy #4.

Rotten Tomatoes score: 35%

"Impractical Jokers: The Movie" is essentially an extended episode of the long-running truTV series which follows a group of comedians playing pranks on each other and unsuspecting civilians.

"An undistinguished and unnecessary extension of a brand whose primary attributes are likability, authenticity and relative modesty," wrote Variety's Mark Keizer.

Ferrell and Julia Louis-Dreyfus costarred in the 2020 American remake of "Force Majeure," called "Downhill."

Rotten Tomatoes score: 36%

A remake of the Swedish film "Force Majeure," "Downhill" stars Ferrell and Julia Louis-Dreyfus as married couple Pete and Billie Stanton, who are forced to confront some unpleasant truths about their relationship after they're convinced they're about to die in an avalanche on a skiing trip.

"Inexplicably, Ferrell is the weakest link, downplaying his character's blooming sense of insecurity despite a celebrated propensity for aria-like tantrums. Why wasn't he allowed to go full 'Step Brothers'?" wrote Joshua Rothkopf for Sight & Sound.

He played an owner of a mall in the 2012 absurdist comedy "Tim & Eric's Billion Dollar Movie."

Rotten Tomatoes score: 38%

This film, starring Tim Heidecker and Eric Wareheim as fictionalized versions of themselves, follows the two as they're given $1 billion to make a movie starring Johnny Depp — but when they squander the budget on a 3-minute film, they're on the hook to repay the studio $1 billion.

That's where Ferrell comes in — he plays the owner of a mall for sale who promises the new owners that they'll make $1 billion in profit.

"More-or-less abhorrent swill; vapid, painful and moronic in the way it treats its audience," wrote CineVue's Jamie Neish.

He played a supermarket clerk in "The Wendell Baker Story."

Rotten Tomatoes score: 40%

This film focuses on Wendell Baker (Luke Wilson), who goes to jail after his illegal ID business is busted by the authorities — and then his girlfriend Doreen (Eva Mendes) dumps him when he seems like he's too well-adjusted to jail.

Ferrell has a small role as Dave, Doreen's new boyfriend who Wendell encounters after he's released from jail.

"Given Luke Wilson's affability, it's also irresistibly charming. You may not buy the film's plot, but you'll invest in him as a man whose heart is always in the right place," wrote the Houston Chronicle's Bruce Westbrook.

In "Kicking & Screaming," released in 2005, he played a mild-mannered dad who, after getting introduced to coffee, becomes an ultra-competitive soccer coach for his son.

"Casa de mi padre," or "House of My Father," stars Ferrell as Armando Álvarez, the heir to a Mexican ranch, who is dragged into a drug war after his little brother Raúl (Diego Luna) gets himself in over his head.

Ferrell had a small role in "Melinda and Melinda," released in 2004.

Rotten Tomatoes score: 51%

Directed by Woody Allen, "Melinda and Melinda" is an interesting little movie, in which the same story is told twice — but one telling is a comedy and one is a tragedy. Ferrell, playing Hobie, appears in the comedic version of the film.

"Great premise, but talky dramedy doesn't deliver," wrote Nell Minow for Common Sense Media.

Ferrell took on the role of Franz Liebkind in the 2005 film adaptation of the musical "The Producers."

Rotten Tomatoes score: 53%

Mustafa returns in the 1999 sequel to "International Man of Mystery," with Ferrell once again donning brown face and a fez to play the seemingly indestructible henchman. Unfortunately, the jokes don't land the same way in "The Spy Who Shagged Me."

"In the context of the past few years, Austin Powers is essentially a walking, talking, hip-thrusting #MeToo lawsuit. The opening sequence in which he parades through a hotel lobby naked is literally just one long sex crime," wrote Alyssa Bereznak for The Ringer.

The lowest-rated true classic Ferrell has starred in is 2008's "Step Brothers."

Rotten Tomatoes score: 55%

Ferrell and John C. Reilly play Brennan and Dale, adult men living at home, who are forced to move in together when Brennan's mom (Mary Steenburgen) marries Dale's dad (Richard Jenkins), even though they hate each other.

However, they start to bond over common interests and decide to get their act together in time for the Catalina Wine Mixer.

"Make no mistake, 'Step Brothers' is a funny movie. It isn't a great movie. In fact, it's a pretty stupid movie. But it's a good stupid, and the chemistry between John C. Reilly and Will Ferrell makes it a fun one as well," wrote MTV's Dre Rivas.

He played the villainous Mugatu in 2001's "Zoolander."

Rotten Tomatoes score: 64%

"Zoolander" stars Ben Stiller as Derek Zoolander, a dimwitted model who becomes entangled in a plot to assassinate a political leader after he's brainwashed by the evil designer Mugatu (Ferrell).

Rotten Tomatoes score: 66%

Ferrell's most iconic role of all time is Ron Burgundy, the news anchor of a San Diego local channel in the '70s. The film focuses on Ron and his colleagues, field reporter Brian Fantana (Paul Rudd), weatherman Brick Tamland (Steve Carell), and sportscaster Champ King (David Koechner), as they deal with a new hire at their channel, Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate).

That's really it — the enduring appeal of this movie rests on Ferrell's memorable performance and his infinitely quotable lines.

After George follows Ted home from a trip to Africa, the unlikely duo get into all sorts of hijinks beloved by kids everywhere.

In 2007, he played the disgraced figure skater Chazz Michael Michaels in "Blades of Glory."

Rotten Tomatoes score: 70%

Ferrell and Jon Heder play Chazz Michael Michaels and Jimmy MacElroy, two figure skaters who team up as an ice-skating duo after they are each banned from singles skating — even though they hate each other.

"One of Ferrell's greatest gifts as a comic is the perfectly timed spontaneous gesture, facial expression or random action," wrote Richard Propes for The Independent Critic.

Rotten Tomatoes score: 71%

Ricky Bobby (Ferrell) becomes a hugely successful NASCAR driver, but when a crash shakes his confidence, he loses his best friend Cal (John C. Reilly), his wife Carley (Leslie Bibb), and his career. It takes reuniting with his absentee father Reese (Gary Cole) to help Ricky reclaim his rightful spot at the top of the NASCAR rankings.

"Playing to his strengths, star and co-writer Will Ferrell reaps many good comic moments early on in Adam McKay's feature to compensate for a sluggish second half," wrote Tim Grierson for Screen Daily.

Rotten Tomatoes score: 71%

In an alternate take on "A Christmas Carol," Ferrell plays the Ghost of Christmas Present who makes it his mission to show Clint (Ryan Reynolds) the error of his Scrooge-like ways before it's too late.

He starred in "Dick" in 1999 as Bob Woodward, one of the journalists responsible for breaking the Watergate scandal.

Rotten Tomatoes score: 72%

Twenty-three years after "All the President's Men" showed audiences how Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein broke the story of Watergate came "Dick," a satirical comedy that posited, what if Deep Throat was actually two 15-year-old girls?

Ferrell played Woodward, Bruce McCulloch played Carl Bernstein, Dan Hedaya played Nixon, and Michelle Williams and Kirsten Dunst steal the show as Arlene and Betsy, the two teens who bring down Nixon.

"It's Watergate as seen through the eyes of two teenage girls, played with implacable good cheer by Kirsten Dunst and Michelle Williams," wrote Joe Morgenstern for the Wall Street Journal.

He voiced the supervillain Megamind in the 2010 animated film "Megamind."

Rotten Tomatoes score: 72%

Ferrell voices Megamind, an alien who landed on Earth and grows up to become a supervillain. The other baby alien who fell to Earth at the same time grew up to become superhero Metro Man (Brad Pitt).

In a performance that would not fly today, Ferrell plays henchman Mustafa in 1997's "Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery."

Rotten Tomatoes score: 73%

The first "Austin Powers" film, "International Man of Mystery," introduced audiences to Austin Powers (Mike Myers), a clear parody of '60s-era James Bond and other spy films. Ferrell — in brown face — plays henchman Mustafa, a stereotypical Arab wearing a fez who is seemingly impossible to kill.

"Hugely influential at the time — but getting old relatively quickly — 'Austin Powers'-mania was a major force in the late 90s and early 2000s, especially when the sequels arrived in 1999 and 2002," wrote Stephen Silver of Tilt.

Except the team is broken up, Ron's relationship has fallen apart, and he's quit his all-star job in New York City. But you can't keep Ron Burgundy down for long.

"There's no question that, despite all the low-brow anarchy, the film is driven by anger at what happened to TV news during the 1980s," wrote Donald Clark for The Irish Times.

But when two of the NYPD's most high-profile cops jump to their deaths, it's up to Terry and Allen to crack the case.

"This is the fourth feature that Will Ferrell and writer-director Adam McKay have collaborated on, and once again they deliver laugh-out-loud if ultimately disposable comedy with mixed messages about arrested male development," wrote Joshua Keaton for Chicago Reader.

Rotten Tomatoes score: 90%

"The Lego Movie" is about Emmet (Chris Pratt), a seemingly average resident of Bricksburg who is called to join the fight against Lord Business (Ferrell), the tyrannical leader of their entire world.
