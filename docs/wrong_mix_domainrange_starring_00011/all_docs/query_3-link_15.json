a member of the deadly vipers and the woman who at the scene of mother's killers hit was the pin point dispatch.\n\nBeatrix learns her location to be in a large villa like fortress in Santa Barbara, California where has a collective of Loving Male Bodyguards known as the Armada 41.\n\nAfter making her way through of all the armada with her Flaming Fury Samurai Sword Beatrix finally engages the woman: Ness Codename Rock-Hopper in a swashbuckling sword fight which doesn't last overrall long before Ness cut's off Beatrix and begs for a re-schedule.\n\nBeatrix agrees when does she want to die as it was what her mother would always ask her jokingly when she was mad with her for misbehaving.\n\nShe asks it to be tommorow night at Pacific Grand Delfino Motel.\n\nIn that time after Beatrix leaves Ness calls fellow vipers Nox Janette, Jeanine Epper and Chingo Martinez telling them that Bill has found himself someone the potential first of one four that will ultimatley replace them.\n\nThe others in a four way call demand she set an ambush for her at the motel outnumber and kill her.\n\nNess however not being injured from their brief fight on the roof becomes cocky and believes that only five men will suffice to accompany her and that she can eliminate Beatrix herself.\n\nBeatrix then comes to the motel the following night and enters the room she instructed to meet at.\n\nNess sends her five bodyguard at Beatrix but one of which cowers out and is killed by Ness.\n\nBeatrix then quickly wipes out the four attacking ones and comes towards Ness.\n\nNess engages her quickly after the sparing of a couple of words believing she can easily take Beatrix.\n\nThe two engage and at first are equally matched.\n\nHowever Beatrix then begins to fight dirty and the two spar in a dirty catfight.\n\nThe fight ends when Beatrix is launched at by Ness who spirals them both out the smashed up hotel room window.\n\nBeatrix is able to seize hold of Ness in free fall and cause her to land on the ground.\n\nBeatrix then crosses Ness her first target from her death list.\n\nShe then takes aim at the second on her list: Jeanine Epper Codename Asp.\n\nJeanine Epper apart from being a deadly viper is an A-list Actress Celebrity.\n\nBeatrix comes for her at the red carpet premiere of her latest film Bride and Gloom.\n\nThe two engage in a dirty catfight with knifes until Beatrix in the end overpowers her by pulling up the red carpet she is running away on and flinging her into the neon lit billboard of her overlooking the Magenta Theater which causes her (wrapped up in the carpet) to explode to pieces in flames which is then flung into the fountain of which they had been formely fighting in.\n\nBeatrix then goes for the third on her list: Nox Janette a long blonde haired wife of crime boss Fat Tony who is secretly a lover of Bill's and a member of the deadly vipers her codename being Cobra and her role in the prevention of Beatrix killing her mother's murderer being she was the caucasian woman who pried her way along with the large bald African American Man.\n\nBeatrix is forced to take out most of Fat Tony's Mafia Men in her search for Nox and in the end tells him of her unfaithfulness which leads Fat Tony to follow her to Nox's apartment to join Beatrix in battle.\n\nHe is however killed by Nox who first lands a bullet clean in his throat and then engages him on a couch with a Blak Mamba shotgun which she uses to blow his head off.\n\nBeatrix who had been knocked to the floot severley injured froma shotgun blow to the side emerges and seizes hold of her bringing them both back to the kitchen area.\n\nThe fight ends as Beatrix drives the Black Mamba shotgun deep into her chest and keaves.\n\nAs Nox begins to bleed to death she aims herself directly at the gas bomb Fat Tony had to placed to eliminate the apartment and all it's evidence of her murder.\n\nShe fires the shotgun causing her die upon impact and the the whole ninth floor of the motel building to blow taking her body up in flames.\n\nIn the time it took to find Nox Beatrix's mentor trainer was also murdered by her. (Her reaction upon finding him was directly similiar to the one she possessed in Vol. 2 when Elle Driver confessed to killing her later and last Epstein Pai Mei).\n\nBeatrix then takes aim at the fourth and second last on her list: Chingo Martinez who alongside Nox Janette prevented her from leaving the building she was perched on so that Bill could kill her mother's murderer.\n\nBeatrix then comes for Chingo who is out in Mexico raising an army of crime of his own.\n\nIt is revealed that the the other deadly vipers apart from Bill are planning a mutiny.\n\nThe mutiny idea was started by Nox Bill's lover who found that he had an attraction for Beatrix.\n\nBill however has caught wave of their mutiny and has a plan of his own involving Falconio Crime family connected hitman brother Budd.\n\nBill plans to replace the current Deadly Vipers and Beatrix is to be along with brother Budd the first two members.\n\nBill also however has an attraction towards Beatrix purposelly awaiting her to kill the current Deadly Vipers which was the point of his hit on her mother's murderer.\n\nBeatrix arrives in Mexico and with the help of two Mexican Slaves (portrayed by Gordon Parks and Michael Parks respectively) finds the current location of Chingo Codename Anaconda.\n\nChingo is however prepared upon learning of the other vipers deaths and unaware of Bill's plan calls on Bill to assist.\n\nBeatrix storms his Marvlo Village and is told to meet at the Main Street Marketplace at noon for their fight.\n\nThey meet and Bill arrives through the process of the fight.\n\nChingo however with his large muscular build overpowers and seriously injures Beatrix.\n\nBill however right beside Chingo stabs him in the back of his neck his one week vital point on his body.\n\nFrom there Beatrix whom is too weak to go on fighting falls unconsious and is carried away to a helicopter in Bill's arms.\n\nWhen she awakes she is in his home and then heads outside prepared to face him.\n\nHe however reveals his attraction and seduces her.\n\nThe film ends with Beatrix pulling out the death list she had made and throwing away the paper but keeping the red marker to cross of the names with.\n\nThe final moments show Bill pulling out files containing pictures of the new viper members: O-Ren Ishii, Vernita Green and Budd.\n\nA woman then enters who reveals to be a new Deadly Viper and a rich Californian woman whom met Bill on a rock climbing expedition.\n\nThe woman reveals her name as Elle Driver.\n\nThe closing scene comes back to Beatrix in the Dunkleman home finishing the beginning story to B.B and foster mother Charlotte.\n\nThe young teenage guy from next door whom was mowing the lawn is shot down as in a direct instant is Charlotte.\n\nThe dramatic music which played in Vol.2 as Beatrix came across B.B at Bill's house for the first time is played as Beatrix pulls the same face she did upon coming across B.B for the first time.\n\nThe film then ends.\n\nThe Director's Concern- A Mother's Love[]\n\nThe film ties up alot of behavioural stuff executed by the character Beatrix Kiddo in the first two Kill Bill Instalments such as her use of the Death Lists (all three of which so funnily happen to comprise of five indivivuals.) The Death List comes as Bethany Kiddo is bleeding to death before her daughter Beatrix she has an emergency letter stashed in jacket which she would give to her should anything happen.\n\nThe letter tells of a secret hiding place in her room and that she is indeed a killer for money and a person who tried to change to make sure what was left of their family would get off with a clean slate.\n\nA Quote used in Kill Bill Vol. 2 by David Carradine which goes \"Some things can never be undone\" is taken from Beatrix's mother as Beatrix upon being his woman for a longtime and an assassin of his told him of this quotation her mother used which was used in the letter she parted her with.\n\nFollowing from as the police began to rush to the house she went upstairs and found her mother's secret weapon place containing upon which a list of five names with the title of the list being: Death List Five.\n\nHer mother's parting letter also read that in the secret room is a list of names of people she was to get back at and finish.\n\nBeatrix assumes the list and hides it within her clothing before leaving the room sealing it up and joining her dead mother downstairs to meet with the arriving police.\n\nYou and I Have Unfinished Business[]\n\nThe classical trademark death threat statement \"You and I Have Unfinished Business\" is given actual origin in the film explaining the original deadly viper members utter it to her as a statement which fuels them on before battle with a foe. Beatrix used the statement classically in Volumes 1 and 2 to certain Viper members.\n\nDeath List Five[]\n\nNess Codename: Rock-Hopper\n\nJeanine Epper Codename: Asp\n\nNox Janette Codename: Cobra\n\nChingo Martinez Codename: Anaconda\n\nBill Codename: Snake-Charmer\n\n\"Pirate Swords.. Nice House\"[]\n\nThe Deadly Viper Ness whom is the first on Beatrix's death list in Vol.3 possesses a large Las Vegas Mansion and a sordid collection of pirate swords as her father was a collector of them and her grandmother was part of a mordern pirate gang which she passed down to her father and then her father passed down to her.\n\nNess however is also skilled in hand to hand combat as her mother was a boxer.\n\n\"and Ninja Batons.. The Nastiest Nasty besides that of the @#$%head that dealt the bullet\"[]\n\nThe Deadly Viper Nox whom is like the original Elle Driver portrayed by popular Hollywood A-List Actress Cameron Diaz whom is third on Beatrix Kiddo's original death list is the wife to a old Ninja Epstein and part of a low key Ninja Gang which once were a prominent organization and the rivals of the pirate gang the Demeanors (the pirate gang to which Ness, her father and grandmother were leaders which made them rivals).\n\nNox is skilled in the use of all Ninja weaponry and fights swift and somewhat dirty like a ninja.\n\n\"Imperfection is a Perfect Girl,You Know What They Say: Madness is Hollywood and I Am Nothing Less then Beyond Furious, Twenty-Two and Unsuspecting She's Gonna Get It, Taking Under Consideration Of Course.. That She Is.. The Vicious Kick\"[]\n\nThe Deadly Viper Jeanine Epper Codename: Asp is the second on Beatrix's original death list.\n\nShe apart from being a girl of Bill's and member of the Deadly Viper's is a well established actress.\n\nHer principal moves consist of basic boxing though with the exception Jeanine as a child was raised by two parents whom were overtly good overtly established gymnasts.\n\nThey were believed to have died when was eleven years old from a trapezium accident but actually were murdered as Jeanine botched the stunt and her parents were killed horribly.\n\nJeanine as a child was born with a set of skinny powerful and durable legs which could almost oversee her lift her legs to her shoulders.\n\nShe also with her helpful gymnastics training developed the talent of executing a powerful straight-forward kick which was found after training when wearing certain attire to even shatter that of a cinderblock.\n\nShe was praised as a girl wondered but's adored talents were distinguished in high school when she got the offer to be the lead performer in a travelling circus troupe. Even though she declined a group of not so nice fellow schoolgirls caught wift of this offer and brought on the many insults which has to do with someone of unnatural talents.\n\nShe eventually got into a fight with the headgirl of the group of girls making her life extremely hard and knocked her into acoma instantly with one powerful kick to the head.\n\nThe kick she delivered regained it's popularity in the not so freakish circus status but rather as a talented extraordinary fighter.\n\nThe move she delivered was made one of it's own and the move was called: \"The Vicious Kick.\"\n\nFrom there Jeanine was offered a film role playing a powerful female boxer.\n\nShe made her way to Hell Hollywood with playing strong female protagonists in a variety of films.\n\nBill Killed- David's Death[]\n\nAs of 2009 great actor David Carradine whom portrays the titular antagonist Bill in the Kill Bill films passed away.\n\nHis reprisal of his role in the third instalment was only because prior to his death his scenes were already filmed.\n\nThe Raid[]\n\nEpstein in the film portrayed by Benicio Del Toro named Jeffery Epstein possesses a Mansion in El, Passo Texas which is why Beatrix following the events of falling pregnant with B.B Kiddo fakes her death and takes off to El, Passo to start a normal life for her baby.\n\nIn the film the El Passo Mansion residence of Jeffery Epstein and his wife is raided by the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad and Jeffery Epstein, his wife, liasion and two students other then Beatrix are killed by remaining Vipers Bill, Nox and Chingo (Ness and Jeanine having been already killed by Beatrix).\n\nThe killing of her Epstein and the innocent people she has become acquainted with enrages her furthermore and then heads straight for the lesbian lover of third death list marked viper Nox and horribly attacks and beats her and then forces her to tell her where Nox is.\n\nThe sequence involving the beating of Nox's lesbian lover Elizabeth Hamilton is executed in a Brian De Palma style.\n\nGallery[]\n\nReferences[]\n\nProceeds[]\n\nKill Bill Vol.1\n\nKill Bill Vol.2\n\nSucceded by[]\n\nKill Bill: Vol.4\n\nStandard References[]\n\nRed Beard (1965)\n\nThrone Of Blood (1957)\n\nSamurai Rebellion (1967)\n\nIkiru (1952)\n\nHarakiri (1962)\n\nSansho the Bailiff (1954)\n\nThe Doll Squad (1973)\n\nThe Pirates of Dark Water (1991)\n\nOstrov sokrovishch.
