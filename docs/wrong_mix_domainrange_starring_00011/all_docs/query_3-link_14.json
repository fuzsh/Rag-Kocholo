For shows that have sold out online, in-person ticket purchases are limited to 2 tickets per person.\n\nHer child is gone. Her team of assassins has betrayed her. Now snatch your Pussy Wagon keychains off the hook and join us as Uma Thurman’s The Bride sets out in her search of vengeance to Kill Bill.\n\n“4 Stars. Kill Bill: Vol. 1 shows Quentin Tarantino so effortlessly and brilliantly in command of his technique that he reminds me of a virtuoso violinist racing through Flight of the Bumble Bee…” – Roger Ebert\n\nKim Morgan discusses Kill Bill: Volume 1 on the New Beverly blog."
