        "text": "Quentin Tarantino has famously claimed that he will be calling it quits after the release of his tenth film, and fans are anxiously awaiting any news on what could be the director’s last big-screen movie. Quentin Tarantino was recently at the Rome Film Festival where he received a lifetime achievement award from Dario Argento, and he spoke with talk show host Fabio Fazio about his next project, which could very well be Kill Bill 3.\n\nRelated\n\nQuentin Tarantino teams with Jay Glennie for books about Once Upon a Time in Hollywood and Inglourious Basterds\n\nQuentin Tarantino told Fabio Fazio that he has “no idea” what his next film will be, but when asked whether it could be Kill Bill 3, the director responded with, “Why not?” Tarantino has talked about making Kill Bill 3 for years, even recently saying that Uma Thurman’s daughter, Maya Hawke, should play the Bride’s daughter. Who knows whether it will actually happen, but the director has plenty of other projects in the works as well, including a comedy with a spaghetti western element.\n\nBut first I want to make a comedy. It’s not like my next movie. It’s a piece of something else that I’m thinking about doing — and I’m not going to describe what it is. But part of this thing, there is supposed to be a Spaghetti Western in it. I’m looking forward to shooting that [thing] because it’s going to be really fun. Because I want to shoot it in the Spaghetti Western style where everybody’s speaking a different language.\n\nQuentin Tarantino continued, “The Mexican Bandido is an Italian; the hero is an American; the bad sheriff is a German; the Mexican saloon girl is Israeli. And everybody is speaking a different language. And you [the actors] just know: OK, when he’s finished talking then I can talk.” Although Tarantino may want to leave fans wanting more with just ten movies, it sounds like he has no shortage of other projects to keep him occupied after his “retirement.” Would you like Quentin Tarantino to end his film-making career with Kill Bill 3 or something different?"
