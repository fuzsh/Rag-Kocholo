        "text": "As excited as we are about all of the great new movies coming to Netflix this June, we’re sad to report that there are quite a few gems leaving the streaming service as well. With fewer licensed movies on the service in recent years, the list of departures has dwindled each month, but some months are worse than others, as is the case for June 2024.\n\nSeveral movies that have seemingly been on the streamer forever are finally getting removed in June, including Bullet Train, which is one of the most fun action movies of the past few years and features a great Brad Pitt performance. Speaking of action, we’re also losing Meg 2: The Trench, Inside Man, and both of Tarantino’s masterful Kill Bill movies from Netflix.\n\nBest Netflix movies leaving in June 2024\n\nBullet Train (June 2)\n\nOver the past decade, David Leitch has established himself as one of the best action directors in the industry. He followed up his 2021 Bob Odenkirk action thriller Nobody with Bullet Train, which stars Brad Pitt as an anxious former assassin tasked with retrieving a briefcase full of cash from a bullet train in Japan. Once aboard, he finds himself at odds with a host of other dangerous criminals. It’s a riot and a perfect lazy weekday movie.\n\nThe Imitation Game (June 25)\n\nYears before Christopher Nolan turned a biopic into a near-billion-dollar box office behemoth, director Morten Tyldum and screenwriter Graham Moore adapted Andrew Hodges’s biography Alan Turing: The Enigma into a movie starring Benedict Cumberbatch. The movie explores how Turnig decrypted German intelligence messages for the British government during World War II, but it was dinged by critics for some historical inaccuracies.\n\nMeg 2: The Trench (June 28)\n\nI could share choice quotes from the reviews of Meg 2: The Trench here, but do you really need to know anything other than that Jonas Taylor (Jason Statham) once again runs away from and occasionally battles giant sharks? I didn’t think so.\n\nInside Man (June 30)\n\nSpike Lee’s legendary 2006 crime thriller Inside Man follows Denzel Washington as Detective Keith Frazier, the NYPD hostage negotiator, attempts to defuse a hostage situation on Wall Street. Clive Owen plays the ringleader of the bank heist, Dalton Russell, Jodie Foster plays Manhattan power broker Madeleine White, and they’re joined by Christopher Plummer, Willem Dafoe, and Chiwetel Ejiofor. To this day, it’s Lee’s most successful theatrical release.\n\nKill Bill: Vol. 1 & Vol. 2 (June 30)\n\nI’m among the fans who believe Quentin Tarantino still hasn’t topped the Kill Bill duology twenty years later. These beloved movies are such a perfect mix of sweet, silly, and serious, with Uma Thurman keeping an otherwise unbelievable story of bloody revenge grounded so as not to let us forget that the Bride’s life is constantly in danger.\n\nTalladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby (June 30)"
