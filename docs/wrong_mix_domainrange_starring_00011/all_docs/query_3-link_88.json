        "text": "Quentin Tarantino says that Kill Bill Volume 3 is \"in the cards.\"\n\nHe's also said that he's only making one more film following Once Upon a Time...In Hollywood.\n\nTarantino says he had dinner with Kill Bill star Uma Thurman recently to discuss the project.\n\nQuentin Tarantino has been adamant with a certain claim over the past few years: that he'll retire after making his 10th movie. On the heels of Once Upon a Time...In Hollywood, which has been earmarked as his 9th movie, Tarantino is hinting that that 10th movie might just be going down a familiar well, and one that he's technically gone down twice before: he says Kill Bill Volume 3 is in the works, and he just met with Uma Thurman to discuss it.\n\nAccording to Collider (h/t AV Club), the director went on Andy Cohen Live and said that a third volume of Kill Bill was definitely \"in the cards,\" though it probably wouldn't be for a while; Tarantino has discussed a number of other projects that seem to be higher in his pecking order as of now. That includes a play and a 5-episode TV series (both of which he mentioned in the interview with Cohen), in addition to a novel and a Star Trek movie that he's talked about quite a bit. This Star Trek movie, presumably, wouldn't \"count\" toward the 10-movie count he frequently refers to (maybe because it's not his own original franchise?).\n\nNonetheless, the idea of a Kill Bill Vol. 3 fits with what he's described as an \"Epilogue-y\" final film. For a long time, rumors have hung around that Tarantino's idea for a much-later Kill Bill sequel would basically turn the original on it's head, and find someone else going after Uma Thurman's character, The Bride (and given his discussion of their dinner together, she'd clearly be involved). That main character, then, would be a grown up and vengeful version of the Vivica A. Fox character's (Vernita Green) daughterâ€”you may recall that she witnessed the epic fight scene between her mother and The Bride.\n\nMaybe this could be a version of that idea. Maybe not. Tarantino has thrown ideas out into the ether only to abandon them before, too (who can forget his Vega Brothers idea for a team-up film between John Travolta's Pulp Fiction character and Michael Madsen's Reservoir Dogs character; that one isn't happening)."
