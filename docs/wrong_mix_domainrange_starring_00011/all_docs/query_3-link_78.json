        "text": "For a film that is 99.9% unlikely ever to be made, there is always a lot of talk about “Kill Bill 3.” And most of that discussion seems to come from none other than Quentin Tarantino. This time, however, he’s talking about who he would like to cast in the film…if he were to make the sequel, of course.\n\nTarantino started by explaining the appeal of a potential “Kill Bill” sequel by speaking on the Joe Rogan podcast.\n\nREAD MORE: “Kill Bill Vol. 3” Vivica A. Fox Wants Zendaya To Play Her Daughter And Fight Uma Thurman\n\n“I think it’s just revisiting the characters twenty years later and just imagining the Bride and her daughter, Bebe, having 20 years of peace, and then that peace is shattered,” he explained. “And not the Bride and Bebe are on the run, and just the idea of being able to cast Uma [Thurman] and cast her daughter Maya [Hawke] in the thing would be fucking exciting.’\n\nObviously, the casting of Maya Hawke as Uma Thurman’s daughter isn’t out of the blue, as the young actress is indeed the real-life daughter of the ‘Kill Bill’ star. However, with recent scene-stealing appearances in “Stranger Things” and Tarantino’s own “Once Upon a Time in Hollywood,” no one would complain about a bit of nepotism.\n\nREAD MORE: Quentin Tarantino Has An Idea For ‘Kill Bill Vol. 3’ & Says Film Is “In The Cards” But Still Years Away\n\nAs for what the story might look like, Tarantino discussed some possibilities.\n\n“Elle Driver is still out there, Sophie Fatale got her arm cut off, but she’s still out there,” he said. “They all got Bill’s money. Actually, Gogo had a twin sister Shiaki, and so her twin sister could show up.”\n\nAgain, it doesn’t sound like Tarantino will actually make “Kill Bill 3” as his final film. (Remember, he’s retiring after his next feature, supposedly.) He says “if” he wanted to go out with a big bang, he could do something epic like “Kill Bill 3, but as he’s said in the past, and he reiterates in this podcast, he believes his final film will be something more of “an epilogue.”\n\n“The only one where I can imagine, where it would be another epic, where I’d need to outdo everything is if I did a ‘Kill Bill 3,'” he explained, as his one caveat, but it still doesn’t sound like it will be the final one.\n\nREAD MORE: Quentin Tarantino Talks About Nearly Casting Mickey Rourke As The ‘Death Proof’ Lead & Making Stage Play Versions Of His Films\n\nTarantino thinks “Once Upon A Time In Hollywood” is his epic big statement, and for his final effort, he’d write something that feels like a quieter post-script effort. But Tarantino suggests in this conversation, he still doesn’t know what that is, nor is he in any rush to figure that out or make it now that he’s a father and enjoying parenthood. Listen to the full podcast conversation below."
