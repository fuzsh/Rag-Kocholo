        "text": "Even though Kill Bill Volume 2 was released almost 20 years ago, fans have not kept quiet about their desire to see Kill Bill Volume 3 and have since been on the lookout for news on whether it was coming out. Quentin Tarantino’s Kill Bill films have received great positive reception from fans thanks to their stylized action sequences and brilliantly written story.\n\nHere’s all we know about Kill Bill Volume 3 and whether or not it’s coming out.\n\nThere is no Kill Bill Volume 3 release date as Quentin Tarantino confirmed that it is not happening.\n\nIn a July 2023 interview with Dutch news outlet DeMorgen, Quentin Tarantino when asked about the rumors of a Kill Bill Volume 3 with Uma Thurman and her daughter Maya Hawke in the lead roles simply shot down the rumors and said “I don’t see that. My last film is about a film critic, a male critic. He played in the 70s.”\n\nHowever, Quentin Tarantino did have several positive news about Kill Bill Volume 3. Back in 2019, he revealed in a Happy Sad Confused podcast interview (via Bloody Disgusting) that he spoke with Uma Thurman about the threequel and claimed that if any movies were to spring from any of his other movies, it would be Kill Bill Volume 3. Then in a 2021 IndieWire interview, he claimed that a third movie could take place 20 years after the events of the second one and feature Maya Hawke as the daughter of Uma Thurman’s The Bride.\n\nSince Kill Bill Volume 3 is confirmed not to be happening, there is no confirmed cast for the movie. Uma Thurman will also not return as her character The Bride from the first two Kill Bill movies.\n\nWhy Kill Bill Volume 3 isn’t happening anytime soon\n\nKill Bill Volume 3 isn’t coming out because as mentioned above, it is not confirmed to be happening by Quentin Tarantino.\n\nWith the rumors that were going for Kill Bill Volume 3 until Quentin Tarantino squashed them, it would have been interesting to see how the film would have ultimately panned out had it been made, especially with the rumored mother-daughter duo leading cast of Uma Thurman and Maya Hawke."
