I'm Terry Gross.\n\nMy guest is one of the funniest actors working today, Will Ferrell. He spent\n\nseven seasons on \"Saturday Night Live\" where he did characters ranging from\n\nGeorge W. Bush to James Lipton and Robert Goulet. He starred in the films\n\n\"Old School,\" \"Elf,\" \"Kicking & Screaming,\" \"Bewitched,\" \"The Producers,\"\n\n\"Anchorman\" and \"Talladega Nights.\" His new film, \"Stranger Than Fiction,\" has\n\na surreal premise. He plays a tax auditor with the IRS who leads a very\n\nroutinized life. One morning he wakes up and hears a voice in his head,\n\nnarrating his every movement and thought. Eventually, he figures out that the\n\nvoice he's hearing is the famous novelist, Karen Eiffel, reading from her work\n\nin progress, and he is a character in her novel. Disturbed that this writer\n\nis controlling his destiny, he tries to track her down. In this scene, he\n\nvisits the office of her publisher and tries to get some information from the\n\nreceptionist in the lobby.\n\n(Soundbite from \"Stranger Than Fiction\")\n\nMr. WILL FERRELL: (As Harold Crick) I need to speak to Karen Eiffel.\n\nUnidentified Actress #1: (As receptionist) I'm sorry?\n\nMr. FERRELL: (As Harold Crick) Karen Eiffel. She's one of your authors. I\n\nneed to talk to her. It's urgent.\n\nActress #1: (As receptionist) Well, she's not here.\n\nMr. FERRELL: (As Harold Crick) No, no, I know. I need to find her. I need\n\nto know where she is.\n\nActress #1: (As receptionist) We're just the publishers.\n\nMr. FERRELL: (As Harold Crick) Right. Of course, but there must be a way\n\nthat I can contact her.\n\nActress #1: (As receptionist) We have the address where her fan mail is sent.\n\nMr. FERRELL: (As Harold Crick) No, I can't send mail. It's urgent.\n\nActress #1: (As receptionist) How do you know her?\n\nMr. FERRELL: (as Harold Crick) I'm her brother.\n\nActress #1: (As receptionist) Her brother?\n\nMr. FERRELL: (As Harold Crick) Her brother-in-law.\n\nActress #1: (As receptionist) She has a sister?\n\nMr. FERRELL: (As Harold Crick) No, I'm married to her brother. Not in this\n\nstate. The one over...\n\nActress #1: (As receptionist) Sir, I'm going to have to ask you to leave.\n\nMr. FERRELL: (As Harold Crick) No, OK, listen. I'm one of her characters.\n\nI'm new. I'm in her new book, and she's going to kill me. Not actually, but\n\nin the book. But I think it will actually kill me so I just--I need to talk\n\nto her and ask her to stop.\n\n(End of soundbite)\n\nGROSS: Welcome to FRESH AIR. How do you get into a character to play a\n\ncharacter who has come to learn that he's actually a character in a novel and\n\nhe hears the writer narrating his...\n\nMr. FERRELL: Yeah.\n\nGROSS: ..story as he lives his life in his head. I mean, there's nobody in\n\nreal life who you could study who would give you a sense of what it's like to\n\nhave a writer's voice in your head who's writing this story.\n\nMr. FERRELL: No. Yeah. Obviously, there's no way to emulate that so I just\n\napproached it, you know, I just--I wanted to kind of figure out how this guy\n\nlived his life, you know, to begin with, which he's kind of a very quiet, you\n\nknow, mundane existence working at the IRS and literally planning things to\n\nthe second the way this guy kind of exists, and then we were--Mark actually\n\ncame up with a really ingenuous idea where I would actually have--we used a\n\nlittle earpiece where I had Emma Thompson's narration prerecorded so I could\n\nliterally listen to this voice in my head and no one else could hear it, you\n\nknow, in the scenes where I worked with other actors. So that's kind of how\n\nwe were able to--you know, I was actually able to live that in a way.\n\nGROSS: Usually, you know, you play somebody--well, often you play somebody\n\nwho's very kind of uninhibited and kind of extreme and extroverted...\n\nMr. FERRELL: Right.\n\nGROSS: ...in a lot of ways...\n\nMr. FERRELL: Right.\n\nGROSS: ...and in this, you're somebody who lives a very regimented kind of\n\nlife. You count your toothbrush strokes.\n\nMr. FERRELL: Yes.\n\nGROSS: You count your steps to the bus and you arrive at the bus at the exact\n\ntime every day. Could you relate to that kind of character at all? It's so\n\ndifferent from what you usually do.\n\nMr. FERRELL: Yeah, it was--well, that was kind of what appealed to me to\n\nbegin with was I'm usually playing characters that are so over the top so kind\n\nof, you know, I guess, fantastical in a way, and this--I loved the thought of\n\nplaying someone just really real and kind of muted and yet it's still a\n\ncomedic role so, you know, I still kind of have to be funny, but, you know, at\n\nthe same time, I enjoyed it too because I kind of identified with the way this\n\nguy lived his life because I've often had conversations with my wife about the\n\nfact if I wasn't doing what I was doing as an actor or comedian, that I do\n\nhave some aspects of my personality where I could kind of live somewhat a\n\nsolitary existence. I don't know what that says about me but I--you know, I\n\ndon't need a lot of things. You know, if I just had some books to read and,\n\nyou know, a source of income and could go to the movies every once in a while,\n\nlike that would be OK too. So I kind of tapped into that, and also, you know,\n\nI had a period of time, kind of post-college, when I moved back home for three\n\nyears, a long three years, and I worked as a bank teller.\n\nGROSS: Oh, really?\n\nMr. FERRELL: Yeah. And I was kind of Harold Crick in that way. I kind of\n\njust--you know, I was just starting to explore, you know, taking theater\n\nclasses and standup and those sorts of things, but for the most part I was\n\nkind of back at home, driving from point A to point B and counting money, and\n\nI didn't have much of a social life because a lot of my friends had gone on to\n\nreal jobs and things like that. So I was able to kind of draw on that period\n\nof time as well.\n\nGROSS: Did you do shtick when you were a bank teller? Did you like\n\nimpersonate your version of what a bank teller would be?\n\nMr. FERRELL: No, in fact, I was so--I found the job so nervewracking that I\n\ngot so quiet because I had to focus with every aspect I would make one\n\ntransaction and then shut my window down for 15 minutes to make sure\n\neverything was still there. And one day it slipped out that I did standup\n\ncomedy, and one of the managers came up to me and just stared at me. It was\n\nlike, `You're funny? I don't believe it.' And I said, `Well, yeah, I can be.'\n\nBut I go, `You'll have to come see a show.' And so it was kind of my alter ego\n\nthat outside of work I had this place to kind of, you know, go crazy up on\n\nstage.\n\nGROSS: Now, in \"Stranger Than Fiction,\" your character's dream is to play\n\nguitar and as the movie goes on, he becomes a little more uninhibited. He\n\ngets a guitar, and there's a scene where he--where you sing and accompany\n\nyourself on guitar, and it's really--it's kind of nice. Usually, you sing in\n\nyour movies. There's usually a point where you sing.\n\nMr. FERRELL: Right. You're right.\n\nGROSS: You did a lot of that on \"Saturday Night Live,\" and it's almost always\n\na parody of some sort.\n\nMr. FERRELL: Right. Right.\n\nGROSS: But in this, you're kind of singing for real...\n\nMr. FERRELL: Yeah.\n\nGROSS: ...as a very inhibited person who's opening up for the first time...\n\nMr. FERRELL: Right.\n\nGROSS: ...and is very tentative about singing. Do you love to sing?\n\nMr. FERRELL: You know, I--yeah, I do. I mean, I come from kind of a musical\n\nfamily. My father is a musician so we--my brothers and I--kind of grew up\n\naround music a lot. I mean, I don't love to sing in the sense of `I'm such a\n\ngood singer, listen to me sing,' or you know, I'm not--I don't brag about it\n\nbut, yeah, there's something--you know, it's nice, I sing, you know--we have a\n\ntwo-and-a-half-year-old son now, and we're playing music with him all the\n\ntime, and--in fact, he tells me a lot of times in his two-and-a-half-year-old\n\nway to stop singing, so he doesn't like it so much. But I love--yeah, I think\n\nmusic is such an important part of kind of family life.\n\nGROSS: Do you think having a father who was a performer made you any more or\n\nless inhibited or uninhibited?\n\nMr. FERRELL: I would say definitely more uninhibited, only because he--you\n\nknow, when I kind of decided--when I was taking classes at the Groundlings\n\nTheater in Los Angeles, which is an improv and sketch comedy group, and I kind\n\nof sat down with him and said, `Hey, Dad, I think I want to give this a shot,\n\nyou know, and try to make a living at this. Do you have any words of advice?'\n\nAnd he said, `You know, if it was based on talent, I wouldn't worry about you,\n\nand you have a lot of talent, but there's a lot of luck involved and just know\n\nthat.'\n\nNow that may come off as kind of weird advice, but for some reason, I found it\n\nreally comforting that it was such a crapshoot that I might as well go for it,\n\nyou know. I might as well be completely uninhibited and have a great time\n\nbecause it's a little bit like playing the lottery and you don't know. So for\n\nsome reason, those were words of great comfort that I wasn't totally in\n\ncontrol in a way, and so that allowed me to just have a great time with it,\n\nand he always said, `You know, if it gets too hard at a certain point, you\n\nknow, don't be afraid to change and do something different.'\n\nGROSS: Well, you said, you know, for you to be completely uninhibited, and\n\nyou really seem to be completely uninhibited as an actor and even just like\n\nthe thing that most people are inhibited about their body.\n\nMr. FERRELL: Right.\n\nGROSS: You've done such funny things, you know, like streaking nude in \"Old\n\nSchool,\" and back on \"Saturday Night Live,\" there were a couple of shows, a\n\nfew shows, you know, where you'd be like naked except for like a--sometimes\n\nlike a patriotic...\n\nMr. FERRELL: Jockstrap.\n\nGROSS: ...American flag jockstrap.\n\nMr. FERRELL: Yes, exactly, right.\n\nGROSS: And...\n\nMr. FERRELL: One of my finer moments.\n\nGROSS: ...and this was all about inviting the audience to laugh at how you\n\nlooked. It was not about...\n\nMr. FERRELL: Yeah.\n\nGROSS: ...showing off your body. It's about...\n\nMr. FERRELL: No.\n\nGROSS: ...being laughed at.\n\nMr. FERRELL: Yeah, it was--I mean, it's also too about just, you know, if\n\nyou're going to do comedy, especially on a show like \"Saturday Night Live,\"\n\nwhy not commit to being as extreme as possible when it's appropriate, when it\n\ncalls for it. You know, I've now kind of worked myself into a cor--well, not\n\na corner, but I now get the question, `Oh, well, you know, is it a\n\nprerequisite for you to strip down to your underwear in a movie?' or this and\n\nthat, and it really isn't. I'm not such an exhibitionist that I'm working on\n\nsomething and I'm like, `Guys, page 32, I haven't gotten in my underwear yet.'\n\nGROSS: You act without vanity. You're willing to do anything to commit to\n\nthe part and get a laugh, but you often play people who are very vain.\n\nMr. FERRELL: Right.\n\nGROSS: And that was certainly the case, like in \"Anchorman,\" where you\n\nplay...\n\nMr. FERRELL: Yeah.\n\nGROSS: ... a local anchor who really thinks he's, you know, Edward R.\n\nMurrow or something.\n\nMr. FERRELL: Yes. Exactly.\n\nGROSS: He's usually covering, you know, the zoo story or the latest\n\ndevelopment at the zoo.\n\nMr. FERRELL: Right.\n\nGROSS: And there's a great scene where the new female anchor, you have a\n\ncrush on her. She's played by Christina Applegate.\n\nMr. FERRELL: Right.\n\nGROSS: And you invite her to your office and what you really want to do is\n\nlike show off, like your great body, so you've taken off your shirt and you're\n\nsitting on a stool...\n\nMr. FERRELL: Mm-hmm. And I...\n\nGROSS: ...with handweights.\n\nMr. FERRELL: Lifting weights.\n\nGROSS: And you're lifting weights...\n\nMr. FERRELL: Yes.\n\nGROSS: ...to show off, like your great, like chest and arm muscles...\n\nMr. FERRELL: Show off the guns. Yeah.\n\nGROSS: You show off the guns, exactly.\n\nMr. FERRELL: Yes.\n\nGROSS: And she comes in thinking she's going to have a meeting with you. Let\n\nme play that scene.\n\n(Soundbite from \"Anchorman\")\n\n(Soundbite of music)\n\nMr. FERRELL: (As Ron Burgundy) One thousand one, one thousand two, ahhhhh!\n\nMs. CHRISTINA APPLEGATE: (As Veronica Corningstone) Mr. Burgundy...\n\nMr. FERRELL: (As Ron Burgundy) One thousand three...\n\nMs. APPLEGATE: (As Veronica Corningstone) Helen said that you needed to see\n\nme.\n\nMr. FERRELL: (As Ron Burgundy) Ahhhh! Oh, Ms. Corningstone. I wasn't\n\nexpecting company. Ahhhh! Ohhh! Mmmm. Just doing my workout. Tuesday's\n\narms and back.\n\nMs. APPLEGATE: (As Veronica Corningstone) Well, you asked me to come by,\n\nsir.\n\nMr. FERRELL: (As Ron Burgundy) Oh, did I? Ohhh!\n\nMs. APPLEGATE: (As Veronica Corningstone) Yeah.\n\nMr. FERRELL: (As Ron Burgundy) Ohhhhh! Ohhhh! It's a deep burn. Ohhh! So\n\ndeep. Ah! Oh, I can barely lift my right arm because I did so many. I don't\n\nknow if you heard me counting. I did over a thousand.\n\nMs. APPLEGATE: (As Veronica Corningstone) Ohh.\n\nMr. FERRELL: (As Ron Burgundy) You have your uvulus muscle connects to the\n\nupper dorsimus. It's boring, but it's part of my life. I'm just going to\n\ngrab this shirt if you don't mind. Just watch out for the guns. They'll get\n\nyou.\n\n(End of soundbite)\n\nGROSS: That's really funny. You know, it's--and, of course, you don't have\n\nlike those rippling muscles in the movie.\n\nMr. FERRELL: No, not quite. Yeah.\n\nGROSS: But the funny thing is, you know, like you were an athlete when you\n\nwere in college. You were...\n\nMr. FERRELL: Yeah.\n\nGROSS: ...a varsity football...\n\nMr. FERRELL: High school, yeah.\n\nGROSS: OK, yeah. Football player. But a lot of actors who probably never\n\nwere athletes like work out to have those like rippling abs, and you know...\n\nMr. FERRELL: Right.\n\nGROSS: ...like big muscles. They look great but--so I'm just kind of\n\ninterested in how, you know, as somebody who was an athlete when you were\n\nyounger...\n\nMr. FERRELL: Right.\n\nGROSS: ...how you dealt with the whole like working-out-muscle thing.\n\nMr. FERRELL: Well, you know what's funny is I'm still fairly athletic. I\n\nmean, I kind of have to work out just to look fat.\n\nGROSS: Would you stick out your stomach so that, like in certain scenes,\n\nyou'll look out of shape, just a little bit?\n\nMr. FERRELL: No, that just kind of happens that way. Yeah, I mean, I still\n\nam a pretty adamant, you know, runner and...\n\nGROSS: Mm-hmm.\n\nMr. FERRELL: ...you know, I still--I love kind of exercising and this and\n\nthat, but there is--yeah, there's something about my physique that no matter\n\nhow much in shape I'm in, it doesn't quite photograph that way but, yeah, you\n\nknow, it is, it's funny. I don't know, it's kind of my protest to this whole,\n\nyou know, kind of cultural thing now where we have to work out, we have to\n\nstay--you know, it's all about body image and this and that, especially in Los\n\nAngeles, and you know, I don't know, it's kind of, I guess, for me, my kind of\n\ncelebration of the average guy and that that can be...\n\nGROSS: Oh, yeah, right.\n\nMr. FERRELL: ...you know, funny, and that sort of thing. But you know, it's\n\nalso funny from a character standpoint that a guy like Ron Burgundy can be so\n\nvain and he still looks like that, you know, with his shirt off, so...\n\nGROSS: Is that how you see a lot of what you do, as a celebration of the\n\naverage guy?\n\nMr. FERRELL: Yeah, that and, you know, we love--you know, my writing\n\npartner, Adam McKay, we wrote--he wrote and directed \"Anchorman,\" and we did\n\n\"Talladega Nights\" together. We're endlessly fascinating with kind of the\n\naverage guy but also kind of this character we like to call this man, someone\n\nwith unearned confidence.\n\nGROSS: Yeah, yeah.\n\nMr. FERRELL: Which, you know, I always feel like you run into these people\n\nwho are--want to have conversations about what they do and who they are, and\n\nyou start listening and you realize, you know, you're not really helping the\n\nworld in any way. You're not helping figure out world peace or a cure for\n\ncancer. It's really kind of lame stuff you're doing but you think it's the\n\nbest stuff in the world. So we kind of love those characters.\n\nGROSS: My guest is Will Ferrell. He's starting in the new film \"Stranger\n\nThan Fiction.\"\n\nWe'll talk more after a break. This is FRESH AIR.\n\n(Announcements)\n\nGROSS: If you're just joining us, my guest is Will Ferrell, and he's starring\n\nin the new movie, \"Stranger Than Fiction.\"\n\nSo, when you went to like, audition for \"Saturday Night Live,\" the story goes\n\nthat you took a trunk, like a suitcase, of Monopoly money with you, so that\n\nyou could do what?\n\nMr. FERRELL: Well, I had read somewhere that Adam Sandler had gone and had a\n\nmeeting with Loren Michaels and had gone into this meeting kind of sight\n\nunseen and had done this really funny bit where he, I don't know, mimicked\n\nhaving sex with a chair or something and was hired on the spot. And I\n\nthought, well, I'm going to follow that, like be funny in the room, and kind\n\nof take advantage, you know, of the moment, kind of seize the day type of\n\nattitude. So I thought what would be really funny is that I walk in with a\n\nbriefcase full of toy money and just start piling it on his desk and say,\n\n`Loren, look, we can talk, you know, until the cows come home but we really\n\nknow what talks, and that's money, and I'm going to walk out of this room, and\n\nyou can either take this money or leave it on your desk, I'll never know the\n\ndifference,' and then hopefully he'd think it was funny that I stacked all\n\nthis fake counterfeit money, but when I got in the atmosphere was so intense\n\nthat I never got to my big joke, and I just sat there with my briefcase in my\n\nlap, which when I left, it felt insane because I was thinking, `Well, he must\n\nbe thinking, \"What comedian walks in with a briefcase and just sits there,\n\nnervously,\"' and so I never--and then we had another meeting where I tried to\n\ndo it again, and the assistant said, `Oh, leave your briefcase, you don't need\n\nthat,' and then, lo and behold, that was the meeting where he told me I had\n\nthe job, and then as I left, I gave a handful of the fake money to the\n\nassistant. It was like, `Can you please give this to him? It's kind of\n\nsymbolic and I tried to do this twice but I could never do it, so can you give\n\nhim this fake money?' And in hindsight, he thought it was really funny that\n\nI'd tried twice to do this gag, and it never, never kind of came to fruition.\n\nGROSS: So what did you do during the audition?\n\nMr. FERRELL: When I was out, they were really kind of looking for eight or\n\nnine brand-new members of the cast, so the first round was five to eight\n\nminutes--you had to do a character of your choice, a political impersonation\n\nif you had one, and a celebrity impersonation. So I did Harry Caray as my\n\ncelebrity and I did Ted Kennedy doing standup as my political impersonation,\n\nwhich was terrible and...\n\nGROSS: Mm-hmm.\n\nMr. FERRELL: ...then I just did this character that--it ended up actually\n\nbeing on my first episode, which was this--it ended up being called the `get\n\noff the shed' guy, who was this kind of dad, you know, having a barbecue in\n\nhis backyard who was yelling at his children to get off this shed, which it's\n\nhard to explain, but Loren says it got me the job, so it was good that I did\n\nit.\n\nGROSS: So, in your early days of \"Saturday Night Live,\" did you have to be\n\nvery assertive to get material on the show?\n\nMr. FERRELL: Well, you know, once again, I was fortunate in that it was a\n\nbrand-new group of people, who all came in at once so, you know, the pie\n\nreally hadn't been divvied up at that point. So everyone was really kind of\n\nfreely writing for each other, even though you really do kind of have to be a\n\nself-starter there. You have to be able to write for yourself because a lot\n\nof the writers won't--they don't really give you any of the character pieces.\n\nThose are usually generated by the cast themselves, and a lot of the more\n\nconceptual pieces are created by the writers, so, yeah, I kind of--like I\n\nsaid, the Groundlings was great. I knew kind of how to write for myself, and\n\nthen as I kind of got momentum on the show, then the writers kind of--the next\n\nthing you know, the writers are coming to you as they view you as someone who\n\ncan kind of deliver the material. So it just kind of starts snowballing in\n\nthat way. So at a certain point I was, you know, I was fortunate in that I\n\nwas always cast, you know, a fair amount of times, you know, from the writers.\n\nBut there's really no structure. That's why you can--you watch the show and\n\nyou'll see someone--an actor had a really big show one week and then the next\n\nshow, they're maybe in one thing because it just ebbs and flows that way.\n\nGROSS: Will Ferrell will be back in the second half of the show. He's\n\nstarring in the new film, \"Stranger Than Fiction.\" Here he is in \"Anchorman,\"\n\nsitting in with the band in a bar playing flute to impress his ladyfriend.\n\nI'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR.\n\n(Soundbite from \"Anchorman\")\n\n(Soundbite of applause and cheers)\n\nMr. FERRELL: (As Ron Burgundy) This is a surprise, I'll tell you. Guys,\n\n\"East Harlem Shakedown,\" E flat. Keep it simple splashy, and, Jerry, let's\n\ntake the baseline for a walk.\n\n(Soundbite of wind instrument)\n\nMr. FERRELL: (As Ron Burgundy) I'm not hearing it right.\n\n(Soundbite of flute)\n\n(Soundbite of bass guitar)\n\nMr. FERRELL: (as Ron Burgundy) We got it now. It's all right.\n\nUnidentified Actress #2: Fire it up, Ronnie.\n\n(Soundbite of flute)\n\nMr. FERRELL: (As Ron Burgundy) A little ham and eggs coming at you. Hold\n\non, people. Hope you got your griddles.\n\n(Soundbite of flute)\n\nMr. FERRELL: (As Ron Burgundy) Uhh.\n\n(Soundbite of flute)\n\nMr. FERRELL: (As Ron Burgundy) Uhh.\n\n(Soundbite of flute)\n\nMr. FERRELL: (As Ron Burgundy) That's babymaking music, that's what that is.\n\nUnhh.\n\n(Soundbite of flute)\n\n(End of soundbite)\n\n(Announcements)\n\nGROSS: This is FRESH AIR.\n\nI'm Terry Gross, back with Will Ferrell. He's starring in the new film,\n\n\"Stranger Than Fiction,\" and his film \"Talladega Nights\" comes out on DVD next\n\nmonth. Ferrell was a cast member of \"Saturday Night Live\" for seven seasons,\n\nfrom 1995 to 2002.\n\nOne of the things you became famous for on \"Saturday Night Live\" was your\n\nimpersonation of George W. Bush, and, of course, in 2000 the debates that you\n\ndid...\n\nMr. FERRELL: Yeah.\n\nGROSS: ...that you did with Darrell Hammond as ...\n\nMr. FERRELL: Yeah.\n\nGROSS: ...Al Gore, I mean, became, like, really quite famous.\n\nMr. FERRELL: Yeah.\n\nGROSS: Do you think that they influenced how people who watched the show\n\nactually thought of the candidates?\n\nMr. FERRELL: I've been told as much, that we actually--I mean, well, it\n\nwas--you know, we had found out later that the Gore people showed the sketch,\n\nthe first one we did, to the candidate and to the vice president to say,\n\n`Look, this is how you're perceived.' And so I guess, in that regard, you\n\nknow, Darrell kind of influenced their--and someone--a few people have said to\n\nme that you made the then governor at that time come off as very likable, even\n\nthough, you know, we were kind of playing up, you know, all the things he was\n\nknown for kind of sticking his, you know, foot in his mouth for. So I--yeah,\n\nI guess we did. It was kind of a crazy time to have all eyes on us, you know,\n\nin that moment.\n\nGROSS: Let's hear a short clip of you doing George W. Bush, and this is from\n\n\"Saturday Night Live.\" My guest is Will Ferrell.\n\n(Soundbite from \"Saturday Night Live\")\n\nUnidentified Actor: The following is an address from the president of the\n\nUnited States.\n\nMr. FERRELL: (As President George W. Bush) Good evening, America. I'm very\n\nhappy to be back in this country after my very successful trip in the Pacific\n\nRim. I'm heartened to hear that, for the most part, the people of this\n\ncountry show strong support for my agenda. However, lately, there's some who\n\nare beginning to criticize this administration. Maybe these people don't\n\nunderstand. America is presently at war, not just the war on terrorism, but\n\nwe are engaged in a deadly standoff with an axis of evil. You know who I'm\n\ntalking about. Iran, Iraq and one of the Koreas.\n\n(Soundbite of laughter)\n\nMr. FERRELL: (As President George W. Bush): But my axis of evil doesn't\n\nseem to interest some people out there. Some people just want to talk about\n\nthe economy and budgets and Enron. I'll bet most of you out there don't even\n\nunderstand Enron. I sure as heck don't.\n\n(Soundbite of laughter)\n\nMr. FERRELL: (As President George W. Bush) It hurts my head to think about\n\nit.\n\n(Soundbite of laughter)\n\nMr. FERRELL: (As President George W. Bush) So from now on, Enron will be\n\npart of my axis of evil.\n\n(Soundbite of laughter)\n\n(End of soundbite)\n\nGROSS: That's Will Ferrell as George W. Bush.\n\nDid you ever get any feedback from President Bush about his thoughts on your\n\nimpression of him?\n\nMr. FERRELL: No, I never got any direct feedback as far as I--as far as I\n\nknew. I'm trying, I think he--you know, I--we might have talked about this\n\nbefore but I did--I met him once when he came to the show and he didn't\n\nrealize that I was the guy who played him, even though it was put to me that\n\nhe was a huge fan, and so it was this very awkward situation where--and this\n\nwas during the campaign of 2000, and so it was this whole thing of `Hurry,\n\nrush down to the studio, the governor really wants to meet you.' And I'm like,\n\n`OK, OK,' and then they forced me into this--you know, all these\n\nphotographers--and they're like `Go, go, go. Say hi.' And I could tell he had\n\nno idea that I was the guy. And so we just kind of stood there, and you know,\n\nhad this awkward like--he's like, `Pleased to meet you' and just kind of look\n\nat me. And then it kind of dawned on him that `Oh, I think--oh, I know who\n\nyou are,' and then I had to go somewhere or something. So it was kind of\n\napropos, I think, in a way.\n\nGROSS: In one of the impressions that you did on \"Saturday Night Live,\" one\n\nof the characters you did was James Lipton from the \"Actors Studio\" broadcast.\n\nMr. FERRELL: Yes.\n\nGROSS: That as always so much fun. What made you decide to do him?\n\nMr. FERRELL: Well, you know, it was funny. I'd actually been a huge fan of\n\nthe show and had always--you know, kind of had been watching it, and then one\n\nday I was running around at the show, and there was a message at the page\n\ndesk, and one of the pages grabbed me and said, `Bill Murray called for you.'\n\nAnd I said, `Really?' And so I thought, `Oh, if Bill Murray calls you, you\n\nshould probably return the call right away.' And we'd met briefly. I think\n\nhe'd hosted the show the week before. So I called him, and he said, `Hey, you\n\nknow who would be good for you to do? I've been watching this James Lipton\n\nguy.' And I'm like, `That's so funny you brought that up. I was kind of\n\npondering that myself.' So I thought, boy, I'd better--because a lot of times\n\nyou have ideas where you don't--you get lazy and you don't act on it, and so\n\nit was really a phone call from Bill Murray kind of forced me to kind of act\n\non that, and then, you know, it was kind of amazing how much James Lipton\n\nloved the impression so much so that he had me come on his 100th episode as\n\nhim, and we did an interview back and forth where he asked me questions, which\n\nwas very surreal as he stood over my shoulder watching me get into makeup,\n\nsaying, `Yes! The transformation has begun. I'm watching you becoming me.'\n\nAnd very--it was very--and he watched the whole 30 minutes it takes me to get\n\ninto that makeup, and I was like, `It's--you can go get a sandwich if you want\n\nat some point, you know.' And he's like, `No, this is fascinating.' But one of\n\nthe many interesting things that has happened to me thus far.\n\nGROSS: Did you notice things sitting across the table from him that you\n\nhadn't noticed watching on TV?\n\nMr. FERRELL: Not really. I don't know. I think if anything I noticed was I\n\nfelt like, `God, I feel like I slightly underplay him. I could go even\n\nbigger.'\n\nGROSS: Let's hear you actually doing James Lipton on \"Saturday Night Live.\"\n\nSo this is Will Ferrell.\n\n(Soundbite from \"Saturday Night Live\")\n\n(Soundbite of laughter)\n\nMr. FERRELL: (As James Lipton) On the 13th of January 1931, right here in\n\nNew York City, magic happened. An artist was born that would rival Leonardo\n\nda Vinci or Michelangelo. But his tools would not be pen nor brush nor chisel\n\nnor palette. His tools would be his comically oversized glasses and his soul.\n\nSo, please, welcome the greatest performer ever to have graced this earth,\n\nCharles Nelson Riley.\n\n(Soundbite of applause)\n\n(End of soundbite)\n\nGROSS: That's Will Ferrell doing James Lipton. And later in the sketch,\n\nCharles Nelson Riley is played by Alec Baldwin.\n\nSo how do you study somebody like Lipton when you're doing an impersonation of\n\nhim. Like, what is your process of watching somebody, whether it's Lipton or\n\nPresident Bush?\n\nMr. FERRELL: I usually have to just pick one key thing and then emphasize\n\nthat again and again and again and then hope that the rest kind of fills in,\n\nbut with, you know, with Bush, as I tried to work on him vocally, I really\n\njust worked on it more from the way he kind of scrunched up his face and kind\n\nof squinted his eyes and almost started from that approach, and with Lipton, I\n\njust tried to overenunciate and so I usually try to key in on one thing where,\n\nyou know, when you speak to someone like Darrell Hammond, who's still on\n\n\"Saturday Night Live,\" he is such a kind of a scientist about it. He can tell\n\nyou that a person has had, you know, dental work because of the way they pop\n\ntheir T's and this and that. He can listen to every single thing, and I'm not\n\nable to do that, so I would just kind of find one key thing to hone in on.\n\nGROSS: My guest is Will Ferrell. He's starring in the new film \"Stranger\n\nThan Fiction.\"\n\nWe'll talk more after a break. This is FRESH AIR.\n\n(Announcements)\n\nGROSS: My guest is Will Ferrell. He's starring in the new film \"Stranger\n\nThan Fiction.\" His film \"Talladega Nights\" about NASCAR drivers comes out on\n\nDVD next month. Here's a scene from \"Talladega Nights\" in which he's saying\n\ngrace at the dinner table with his family and best friend.\n\n(Soundbite from \"Talladega Nights\")\n\nMr. FERRELL: (As Ricky Bobby) Dear Lord baby Jesus, we thank you so much for\n\nthis bountiful harvest of Dominoes, KFC and the always delicious Taco Bell. I\n\njust want to take time to say thank you for my family, my two beautiful,\n\nbeautiful, handsome, striking sons, Walker and Texas Ranger or TR, as we call\n\nhim, and, of course, my red-hot-smoking wife, Carley, who's a stone-cold fox.\n\nMmmmm! Dear tiny infant Jesus...\n\nUnidentified Actress #3: Hey, uh, you know, sweetie, Jesus did grow up. You\n\ndon't always have to call him baby. It's a bit odd and off-putting to pray to\n\na baby.\n\nMr. FERRELL: (As Ricky Bobby) Well, look, I like the Christmas Jesus best\n\nand I'm saying grace. When you say grace, you can say it to grown-up Jesus or\n\nteenage Jesus or bearded Jesus or whoever you want.\n\n(End of soundbite)\n\nGROSS: I'm wondering if some screenplays are given to you by people who\n\nthink, `Well, this needs work but he's so funny, and he's such a great\n\nimprovisor, he'll fix it.'\n\nMr. FERRELL: Right. Exactly. Yeah. You do get a--you do get a list of\n\nthings where it's--you can totally rewrite it, which usually means it's\n\nprobably not that good. And, yeah, there is--and sometimes you can on the day\n\ncome up with a lot of stuff, but you usually have to have, you know, much more\n\nof a backbone, much more of a game plan going in. So even though I love\n\nimprovising during a movie, I still try to have as decent a script as you can\n\ngoing in. I think people think it's a magic spell, like, `Go ahead, you know,\n\nit's OK if it's not on the page. You'll fix it on the day...'\n\nGROSS: Work your magic.\n\nMr. FERRELL: Yeah, yeah, and, you know, that's hard sometime.\n\nGROSS: Well, take a movie like your recent film \"Talladega Nights,\" which you\n\nco-wrote and starred in. You wrote it with yourself in mind...\n\nMr. FERRELL: Right.\n\nGROSS: ...but, at the same time, did you leave things open for improvisation\n\nwithin that?\n\nMr. FERRELL: You know we--no, we had a pretty--it was a fully realized\n\nscript, but just in the way we work, we know that we're going to at least take\n\na pass at the scene where we pretty much throw the dialogue out. You know, we\n\nkind of just have a motto that funny is funny and the best idea wins\n\nregardless of who it came from, and we just try to kind of foster an\n\natmosphere where everyone feels safe enough to fail and to try something as\n\ncrazy as they want to and--'cause we always say, `You know, we don't have to\n\nuse it if it doesn't work.' So we completely write the script but a lot of\n\ntimes we'll tape our rehearsal periods and kind of jot down some of the better\n\nad-libs and recycle those when we start filming again.\n\nGROSS: You know on the--let's see, it's at the end of \"Anchorman\" over the\n\nclose credits, there's a lot of outtakes...\n\nMr. FERRELL: Yeah.\n\nGROSS: ...and in some of those outtakes, you or another actor is doing the\n\nscene like seven different ways...\n\nMr. FERRELL: Yeah.\n\nGROSS: ...or doing like seven different versions of the punchline.\n\nMr. FERRELL: Right.\n\nGROSS: Is that the way it typically works with you, that you'll test out a\n\nlot of things and use one?\n\nMr. FERRELL: Yeah, well--I mean, you know, especially in the couple of\n\nmovies that I've made with Adam McKay, there's so many times where we've just\n\nrun out of film. We never even yell `Cut' because we just keep it rolling,\n\nand you know, `Let's take it back and start again' or `Let me just do,' you\n\nknow, if it's one certain line, `Let me just do 10 in a row and try to think\n\nof one,' or he'll--Adam will yell out suggestions, and you know, we--with\n\n\"Talladega Nights,\" it was so fun because we'd wanted to work with John C.\n\nRiley for such a long time, and John got so kind of fired up by the way we\n\nworked that the next thing you know, John was hanging out on the set with\n\nideas for not even his character, for other characters, and so it kind feeds\n\nitself in a way that, you know, the next thing you know you've got 20 extra\n\njokes that were never there on the script and which is such a luxury to get to\n\nchoose from.\n\nGROSS: You made \"Talladega Nights\" and \"Anchorman\" with the writer and\n\ndirector Adam McKay. How did you first start working together?\n\nMr. FERRELL: We were hired at the same time at \"Saturday Night Live\" and\n\nAdam was--I think he became--he was like head writer by his second season and\n\nwas definitely one of the stars of the writing staff and someone who wrote\n\njust great, interesting sketches, was kind of adept at political writing as\n\nwell, and we just kind of hit it off and we enjoyed working together because,\n\nobviously, we shared the same sense of humor, but we worked really fast. We\n\nwould--there's a tendency at the show to kind of write something and go over\n\nit again and again and again, and we just have this thing of it should never\n\ntake longer than an hour to write a sketch and just kind of spit it out and\n\nhave fun with it and maybe look back at it, you know, later, you know, at the\n\nend of the night type of thing but--and we found out that we kind of had just\n\nas high a success ratio doing that than people who went over and over and over\n\nstuff so--and then we just kind of transitioned to writing features that way,\n\nand he's become--we've now started a production company, and he's one of the\n\nguys I really admire artistically. I think he might be arguably the funniest\n\nperson that I know, performer or otherwise, and he's one of my best friends on\n\ntop of it. So I feel pretty lucky that I got to meet Adam McKay.\n\nGROSS: Do you ever have anxiety dreams about your work?\n\nMr. FERRELL: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm always, you know--I think anyone who\n\nhas--you know, is in any sort of artistic pursuit kind of goes up and down\n\nwith the way they feel about their work, and I for the most part am a pretty\n\nhappy person but, yeah, I go through definite periods of time where I'm not\n\nfunny, I'm not good, I don't feel original, and so that--I'm always joking\n\nwith my wife that, you know, when I get kicked out of show business, I'm\n\nalways trying to think of alternate careers, and so far I've come up with...\n\nGROSS: Bank teller.\n\nMr. FERRELL: ...cab driver. I can go back to bank teller. Maybe UPS, too.\n\nUPS is high on the list. But, yeah, I definitely have anxiety, and yet I...\n\nGROSS: So can you share an anxiety dream, like a--the kind of dream that you\n\nhave about comedy and something going terribly wrong.\n\nMr. FERRELL: I'm trying--yeah, if I have a specific example. Well, I'll\n\nstill have like \"Saturday Night Live\" stress dreams where the show has started\n\nand I'm making a quick change backstage, and no one--the microphone in my\n\ndressing room wasn't on, so I didn't hear that the show started, or the\n\nspeaker, I mean, and I have to run out in the middle of a sketch and figure\n\nout where I am and things like that. I guess that's more of a different type\n\nof stress dream. But, yeah, I don't know if I have a specific example but,\n\nyeah, you know, I go through it.\n\nGROSS: What's the worst thing that actually did happen to you live on the air\n\non \"Saturday Night Live\"?\n\nMr. FERRELL: The worst thing? I--you know what? I was doing an update\n\nfeature where on \"Weekend Update\" on the fake news section, you know,\n\ncharacters will sometimes come out, and I was--I started--my glasses started\n\nfogging up to where I couldn't read the cue cards, and then I started\n\nlaughing, and it was this kind of this wonderful kind of crazy situation of I\n\nwas having this laughing attack, and I can't see anything, and I literally\n\nkind of had to stop and wipe off my glasses and then get back to reading the\n\ncue cards. So it was actually kind of really fun. Free fall of like, `Oh,\n\nwell, there's no way to rescue this,' but the audience kind of loves it in a\n\nway when they're watching that happen.\n\nGROSS: So, did you stay in character while you were wiping off your glasses?\n\nMr. FERRELL: Yeah, I did. It was--I was--I did this character who suffered\n\nfrom voice immodulation, which was someone who--I only could speak like this.\n\nI had no control of the volume of my voice, so whether I was speaking\n\nintimately or shouting, it was the same voice level so I would have asides to\n\nmyself, like `Boy, I don't think'--you know, `she doesn't smell very good,'\n\nyou know. So I could never have a private moment in that I was afflicted with\n\nthis disease, and people didn't think it was a real disease, and I was the\n\nchampion of this thing. It was very--it's bizarre.\n\nGROSS: Well, Will Ferrell, it's just been great to talk with you. Thank you\n\nso much.\n\nMr. FERRELL: You, too, Terry. Thanks. It's been my pleasure.\n\nGROSS: Will Ferrell is starring in the new movie, \"Stranger Than Fiction.\"\n\nComing up, TV critic David Bianculli reviews the final episodes of the series\n\n\"Prime Suspect.\"\n\nThis is FRESH AIR.\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *\n\nReview: TV critic David Bianculli reviews \"Prime Suspect: The\n\nFinal Act\"\n\nTERRY GROSS, host:\n\nHelen Mirren introduced the character of British police inspector Jane\n\nTennison in the first \"Prime Suspect\" miniseries imported by PBS 14 years ago.\n\nSince then, Mirren has reprised the character in five other \"Prime Suspect\"\n\ndramas, most recently two years ago. This weekend and next, the PBS anthology\n\nseries \"Masterpiece Theater\" presents the last entry in the series. It's\n\ncalled \"Prime Suspect: The Final Act,\" and TV critic David Bianculli has a\n\nreview.\n\nMr. DAVID BIANCULLI: The last place I expected to encounter a sly little\n\nin-joke was buried deep within a \"Prime Suspect\" miniseries, with all its\n\nserious examinations of human nature and inhuman violence. Yet, there it is.\n\nAt one point in \"Prime Suspect: The Final Act,\" someone deferentially refers\n\nto Helen Mirren's Jane Tennison as `Mum.' `Don't call me Mum,' she shoots\n\nback. `I'm not the queen, you know.' The joke, of course, is that Dame Helen\n\nMirren has played two queens this year, both of them earning great reviews.\n\nShe won an Emmy for her terrific portrayal of Queen Elizabeth in the HBO\n\nminiseries called \"Elizabeth,\" and she may soon be nominated for an Oscar for\n\nher portrayal of Queen Elizabeth II in the new movie, \"The Queen\" about the\n\nroyal reaction to the death of Princess Diana.\n\nNo one even passably familiar with Mirren's work and talent should be\n\nsurprised by that royal double play. She's been fearless in \"The Cook, the\n\nThief, His Wife & Her Lover,\" sexy in \"Caligola,\" sinister in \"Excalibur,\" and\n\nprim and proper in \"Gosford Park.\" Onscreen, she first bowled me over more\n\nthan 30 years ago playing opposite Malcolm McDowell in the 1973 cult film, \"O\n\nLucky Man!\" But nothing she's done over her long and impressive career has\n\noutshone her amazingly subtle and stirring work as Jane Tennison in \"Prime\n\nSuspect.\" When that series began, Jane was a woman trying to make it in an\n\nalmost exclusively male environment. When she got promoted to run the\n\ndetective unit at New Scotland Yard, Jane had to crack not only her cases, but\n\nmany levels of resentment and distrust among her coworkers. Some thought she\n\ngot the job by sleeping around, and at times she did sleep around, sometimes\n\nself-destructively, but that wasn't why she got the job.\n\nJane Tennison was an early prototype of a now very familiar TV character, the\n\nbest one in the squad at getting into the head of a suspect and extracting a\n\nconfession. \"Cracker,\" \"Homicide: Life on the Street,\" \"Law & Order:\n\nCriminal Intent,\" \"The Closer,\" \"Criminal Minds\"--they all have protagonists\n\nwith similar traits. But \"Prime Suspect\" came before them all, and both the\n\nscripts and Mirren's acting skills made sure to show us Jane's weaknesses as\n\nwell as her strengths.\n\nIn \"Prime Suspect: The Final Act,\" Jane has risen all the way to detective\n\nsuperintendent, but that's as far as she's going to go. She's almost 60, and\n\nretirement is imminent. But instead of going willingly and with grace, she's\n\nfighting the prospect. She's drinking so much, she has blackouts, and her\n\nfather, played by Frank Findlay, is dying, which is just one more reason to\n\ndrink. What she wants, what she needs, is one more case to wrap her head\n\naround before turning in her badge. And she gets it when a 14-year-old girl\n\nnamed Sally goes missing and is found dead. She's not wrapped in plastic, but\n\notherwise, it's very much like Laura Palmer in \"Twin Peaks.\" The victim comes\n\nalive to us in home movies shot before her death, and we learn, quite quickly,\n\nthat her seemingly perfect life as a suburban teenager had a very dark side.\n\nInitially, Jane suspects Sally's father, played by Gary Lewis. While Jane's\n\ncolleagues watch from behind one-way glass in the interrogation room, she asks\n\nthe father about his alibi and about the whereabouts of Sally's missing\n\nbackpack, what the British call a kitbag. But this time her questioning\n\ntechniques aren't all that sharp, and there's a reason.\n\n(Soundbite from \"Prime Suspect: The Final Act\")\n\nMs. HELEN MIRREN: (As Jane Tennison) OK. So you're sitting in your car with\n\nSally, drinking.\n\nMr. GARY LEWIS: (As Sally's father) Wait a minute. I was sitting alone. I\n\ntold you. I was--what, what is this? I was alone in the car with one can of\n\nbeer. Just me.\n\nMs. MIRREN: (As Jane Tennison) But Mrs. Sturdy says that Sally left home\n\nwith her kitbag. Did she?\n\nMr. LEWIS: (As Sally's father) I don't know. Kitbag, I don't know.\n\nMs. MIRREN: (As Jane Tennison) So are you saying she didn't have a kitbag?\n\nMr. LEWIS: (As Sally's father) I'm telling you I wasn't there. I wasn't\n\nthere. How would I know if she had a kitbag with her? I, really, really--I\n\nmean, for Christ's sake. I mean, that's the point. I'm telling you, I should\n\nhave been there, but I wasn't. I wasn't home. Christ. You never made a\n\nmistake? You've never been ashamed?\n\nMs. MIRREN: (As Jane Tennison) What were you ashamed of, Tony, hmm? Because\n\nyou like a drink? Is that what is it? You had more than one beer in that\n\ncar, didn't you? I mean, I can tell that you like a drink because you smell\n\nof alcohol right now.\n\nMr. LEWIS: (As Sally's father) That's not me. That's you.\n\n(Soundbite of music)\n\n(End of soundbite)\n\nMr. BIANCULLI: Jane's coworkers see all this and don't know how to react.\n\nThrough her years on the force, and in all these other \"Prime Suspect\" movies,\n\nshe's earned the respect she once so desperately sought. She even gets a\n\nchance at closure with an old squadroom adversary, Bill Otley, once again\n\nplayed by Tom Bell, from the first and third \"Prime Suspect\" dramas. But\n\nwhenever she takes a step forward, she seems to slip back. Fighting\n\nalcoholism is bad enough, watching her dad die is worse. And as she pursues\n\nthis latest murder case, she gets blindsided from yet another direction. The\n\nvictim's best friend, a vulnerable girl played by Laura Greenwood from \"V for\n\nVendetta,\" awakens Jane's maternal instincts. Greenwood is magnificent here.\n\nShe seems to take Mirren's lead and acts with a naturalness and a\n\nvulnerability that makes you feel more like a voyeur than a viewer.\n\nWriter Frank Deasy and director Philip Martin have given Helen Mirren, in Jane\n\nTennison, a fabulously appropriate send-off. Down to the very last frame,\n\nthis \"Prime Suspect\" isn't just the final act. It's a class act, too, fit for\n\na queen or in this case, a dame.\n\nGROSS: David Bianculli is TV critic for the New York Daily News.\n\n(Soundbite of music)\n\n(Credits)"
