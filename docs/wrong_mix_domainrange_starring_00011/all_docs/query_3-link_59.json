        "text": "The box office has been anything but surprising the last several weeks. After Easter Sunday, The Passion of the Christ\n\nreclaimed the top box office position, with the top seven movies all showing a strong presence.\n\nThis week is strange because two vendetta movies are being\n\nreleased this week: Kill Bill Vol. 2 and The Punisher. The streak of vengeance-focused plotlines culminates next week\n\nwith Man on Fire.\n\nKill Bill Vol. 2\n\nThe Premise: Continuing where Vol. 1 left off, The Bride\n\n(played by the lovely Uma Thurman, sans the yellow biker suit\n\nfrom the original) continues her quest to kill off the remaining parties who killed her family. David Carradine (as Bill) and Daryl Hannah (Elle Driver) have more pronounced roles in this version, and the critical acclaim is nearly Return of the King high (91% positive, according to rottentomatoes.com).\n\nThe Buzz: When the theatrical release of Vol. 2 was postponed for two months, I admit I was a little scared that audiences\n\nwould lose touch with the plot line, but with the intense amount of\n\npromotion, the additional two months seemed to do nothing but\n\nbuild anticipation for the film.\n\nBottom Line: If you haven't seen Vol. 1, grab it on\n\nDVD -- it just came out Tuesday. This edition is guaranteed to be\n\nmore fun and campier than the first volume (and that includes the soundtrack), and you'll regret not catching this bad boy in the theater if you don't hustle on down to see it. But leave your samurai sword at home. You don't need any more indictments on your record after the\n\ncow-pushing debacle.\n\nThe Punisher\n\nThe Premise: Based on the Marvel comic, Thomas\n\nJane stars as Frank Castle, a special agent who loses his\n\nfamily at the hands of a criminal. After the justice system\n\nfails to punish (or even find) the assailant, Castle\n\ntakes matters into his own hands. He has a personal vendetta,\n\nand will execute his vengeance with his own particular flair.\n\nThe Buzz: Rookie director Jonathan Hensliegh, who\n\nwrote the screenplay, also wrote the screenplay for mega-hit\n\nArmageddon.\n\nBottom Line: The bottomline premise echoes of A Man Apart and next week's Man on Fire, among others. However, with movie adaptations of comic books becoming better (think X-Men 2 and Hellboy - not Daredevil), it's possible Punisher might not be a punitive experience, but rather an enjoyable one.\n\nJohn Travolta, Rebecca Romijn-Stamos and Roy Scheider co-star.\n\nConnie and Carla\n\nThe Premise: In order to hide from the Mafia after seeing something not meant for them to see, friends Connie and Carla (Nia Vardalos and Toni Collette, respectively) hide out in the least obvious place (in their minds) -- Las Vegas. In order to thwart detection, they take jobs as drag queens, even though they are straight females. Subsequently, finding Mr. Right becomes much more difficult. Hilarity ensues.\n\nThe Buzz: Two highly adored indie-gold actresses from two of the most acclaimed indie-crossover hits (My Big Fat Greek Wedding and Muriel's Wedding) and David Duchovny's return to feature films. What's not to love?\n\nBottom Line: I'm going out on a limb here: C & C has the makings of one of the funniest films of the year.\n\nTrailers\n\nKill Bill Vol. 2: http://www.apple.com/trailers/miramax/kill_bill/volume_II/trailer/\n\nConnie and Carla: http://www.apple.com/trailers/universal/connie_and_carla/\n\nThe Punisher: http://www.apple.com/trailers/lions_gate/the_punisher/trailer2/"
