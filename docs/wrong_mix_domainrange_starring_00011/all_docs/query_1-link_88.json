        "text": "“Love & Basketball” (Streaming now)\n\nGina Prince-Bythewood’s directorial debut remains both one of the best romances and one of the best sports movies of the 21st century. Starring Omar Epps and Sanaa Lathan as two rising basketball stars who fall for each other while pursuing their own careers in Los Angeles, the film captures the age-old equation of balancing love and ambition with honesty, elegance, and humor. Utilizing a unique narrative structure that portrays their romance over the course of four quarters as if it’s a basketball game, the film is a winning mix of format and subject matter that established Prince-Bythewood as a filmmaker to watch.\n\n“Out of Africa” (Streaming now)\n\n“Out of Africa” is a true throwback to a time when the presence of movie stars and lush cinematography were enough to draw crowds despite lethargic pacing and a melodramatic story. But the very factors that would make such a film unlikely to be made today are what makes this 1985 splashy studio epic fascinating to rewatch. Meryl Streep and Redford, both at the height of their fame, star as a wealthy heiress and a big game hunter who fall in love against the backdrop of British colonialism in Africa. Even if the story isn’t quite your thing, the elegantly shot Sydney Pollack film is a reminder of a time when movie stars felt truly larger than life.\n\n“Bonnie & Clyde” (Streaming now)\n\nArthur Penn’s 1967 “Bonnie and Clyde” is as significant for the industry changes it ushered in as part of the New Hollywood movement as its actual subject matter. But the film is far from a homework assignment and remains a wildly entertaining rewatch for seasoned cinephiles and newbies alike.\n\nWarren Beatty and Faye Dunaway star as the eponymous outlaw lovers in a bloody, sexy, morally ambiguous film about life on the run. Flanked by a stellar supporting cast that includes Gene Hackman, Michael J. Pollard, and Gene Wilder, the film is a timeless portrait of the changes that shook Hollywood between the late ’60s and early ’70s.\n\n“Step Brothers” (Streaming now)\n\nPerhaps the last truly great movie Adam McKay made before his pivot to heavy-handed satire, “Step Brothers” is one of the quintessential works of the 2000s studio comedy era that so many of us now revere. Will Ferrell’s brand of sweet manchild stupidity has never fit more seamlessly into a movie, and John C. Reilly provides a perfect foil for him as his adult step brother and partner in bedroom activities. No matter how many times you’ve rewatched it, it’s always time for another viewing.\n\n“Mister America” (Streaming March 15)\n\nThe sprawling universe of Tim Heidecker and Gregg Turkington’s “On Cinema At the Cinema” has produced 14 seasons of their fictional talk show, 10 sprawling Oscar Specials, and a four-hour simulated murder trial. But so far, the series that spends so much time debating the value of “keeping it about the movies” has only produced one film.\n\n“Mister America” is a feature-length mockumentary that takes the gruesome events of the “On Cinema” universe out of their often cartoonish context and into the real world. The movie follows the fictionalized version of Heidecker as he launches a campaign for District Attorney of San Bernardino County after a mistrial in his Electric Sun 19 murder case keeps him out of jail.\n\nWhile it’s not the strongest piece of “On Cinema” lore, its mere existence is a testament to Heidecker and Turkington’s endless ability to keep imposing their will on different forms of media. It’s a must-see for any “On Cinema” completionist as we gear up for the 11th annual Oscar Special at AmatoCon next week.\n\n“Bodies Bodies Bodies” (Streaming March 20)\n\nOne of the breakout indie horror hits of 2022, Halina Reijin’s “Bodies Bodies Bodies” succeeded as both a biting satire of 2020s wealth discourse and a launch pad for several rising stars. When a group of influencers gather in a remote mansion for a weekend getaway, they play a dark party game called “Bodies Bodies Bodies” that quickly turns far bloodier than anyone expected. The witty script allowed up-and-comers like Rachel Sennott and Chase Sui Wonders to lampoon the performative virtue signaling and faux concern that masks so much vitriol on social media platforms in one of that year’s cleverest movies.\n\n“Kill Bill” (Streaming March 31)\n\nWith the possible exception of his Westerns, “Kill Bill” is the most overtly referential movie in Quentin Tarantino’s filmography. The sprawling martial arts revenge saga loosely adapts the plot of Francois Truffaut’s “The Bride Wore Black,” placing Uma Thurman in the role of The Bride, an assassin who methodically hunts down the many former accomplices who betrayed her.\n\nThe film is filled with stylized homages to the countless martial arts movies that have inspired Tarantino over the years, from exploitation films that played on the grindhouse circuit to contemporary anime. Released in two parts after Harvey Weinstein deemed it too long, Tarantino still counts the film as one entry in his 10-film career. When viewed as one film, “Kill Bill” remains a remarkable testament to Tarantino’s action chops and depth of movie knowledge."
