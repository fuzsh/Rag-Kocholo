        "text": "If there is one thing Quentin Tarantino might enjoy more than making films is actually just talking about films. It’s clear, from any interview with the filmmaker, his passion for talking about movies is unmatched. And it’s not just previously made films that he loves to discuss. Tarantino is also a huge fan of speculating about films that haven’t been made, even if it means giving false hope to fans about the possibility of sequels to his previous work. Of his previous films, the potential sequel that he teases most often is “Kill Bill Vol. 3.” However, as his feature film directing career seemingly comes to an end after his upcoming “The Movie Critic,” it appears a new ‘Kill Bill’ film is just a distant fantasy.\n\nREAD MORE: Quentin Tarantino Compares ‘The Movie Critic’ Lead Character To Travis Bickle From ‘Taxi Driver’\n\nSpeaking to DeMorgen, Quentin Tarantino talked about the possibility of directing “Kill Bill Vol. 3.” Though saying there’s a possibility is a bit of a misnomer, as the filmmaker clearly states that another ‘Kill Bill’ film isn’t happening.\n\n“I don’t see that happening. My last film is about a film critic, a male critic,” said Tarantino. “And he plays in the ‘70s.”\n\nREAD MORE: Quentin Tarantino Doesn’t Rule Out ‘Kill Bill 3’ As His Next Film But Says He’s Ready “To Make A Comedy” First\n\nOf course, the film Tarantino is teasing is “The Movie Critic,” which he has already talked about quite a bit and has named his final film. That said, it’s not crazy to ask about “Kill Bill Vol. 3.” As mentioned, Tarantino loves to tease sequels, prequels, and other projects that could potentially spinoff from his previous works. He’s talked about how he wanted to do another film in the “Pulp Fiction” universe, as well as a new story inspired by “Reservoir Dogs.” And yes, he’s talked quite a bit about maybe making another ‘Kill Bill.’ Hell, as recently as 2021, he even said that a possible “Kill Bill Vol. 3” would star Maya Hawke as Uma Thurman’s daughter. So, fans aren’t crazy for thinking it might happen.\n\nAlas, it appears Tarantino’s threat to end his career after his 10th film, “The Movie Critic,” is actually the plan. That means the possibility of “Kill Bill Vol. 3,” as a feature film, at least, isn’t happening. Perhaps the filmmaker will revisit the idea as a novel or maybe even a TV series. But as a film, it appears that’s just not in the cards."
