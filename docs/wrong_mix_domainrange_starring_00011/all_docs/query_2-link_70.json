        "text": "We’re officially RSVP’ing yes to You’re Cordially Invited, the new Will Ferrell–Reese Witherspoon movie about two weddings on a collision course.\n\nBased on every bride’s worst nightmare, the movie follows the mishaps that ensue after a remote wedding venue accidentally double-books itself one weekend, leading to a clash between the two parties. Since the chaos of weddings is go-to rom-com fodder, we can already tell where this is heading.… disaster and fun. Read on for everything we know about You’re Cordially Invited.\n\nWhat is You’re Cordially Invited about?\n\nYou’re Cordially Invited is about two weddings at one venue at an island resort off the coast of Georgia. Witherspoon plays the sister of one bride, Ferrell the father of the other.\n\nThe film was written and directed by Nicholas Stoller, who also wrote Bros, Night School, Sex Tape, Zoolander 2, The Muppets, Muppets Most Wanted, The Five-Year Engagement, and Neighbors 2: Sorority Rising.\n\nWho’s in the cast?\n\nWitherspoon and Ferrell top-line, naturally, with Jack McBrayer as the hapless hotelier responsible for the miscommunication. The ensemble cast also includes Geraldine Viswanathan, Meredith Hagner, Jimmy Tatro, Stony Blyden, Leanne Morgan, Rory Scovel, Keyla Monterroso Mejia, Ramona Young, and Celia Weston.\n\nWitherspoon’s last rom-com outing, the Netflix movie Your Place or Mine, costarring Ashton Kutcher, was…not too sharp, despite Witherspoon’s many charms. But with a comedy heavyweight like Ferrell to play against and a veteran writer-director at the helm, we’re optimistic that this could be actually funny, cute, and fun. Like Anyone but You, but for grown-ups! If nothing else, a Will Ferrell–Reese Witherspoon movie is safe to watch with your parents.\n\nIs there a trailer?\n\nThe first look dropped Tuesday, May 14! It doesn’t seem to tease any chemistry between Will Ferrell and Reese Witherspoon’s characters, but it also doesn’t give either one of them a partner, so we’re going to place our bets that these two end up, at the very least, flirty friends.\n\nRelease date\n\nYou’re Cordially Invited lands on Prime Video on January 30, 2025."
