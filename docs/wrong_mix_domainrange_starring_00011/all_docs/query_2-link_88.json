        "text": "From Ron Burgundy to Buddy the Elf, to his varied SNL impressions and characters, Will Ferrell has clearly established himself as one of the all-time comedy greats, but did you know the actor has his name behind tons of heavy-hitting shows and movies behind the camera and co-founded one of the best-known comedy websites as well? An infamous improviser, Ferrell has a knack for making audiences laugh and coming up with quotable lines as a writer or spontaneously on set. In honor of his 56th birthday, and the recent 20th anniversary of his classic comedy Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy, here are 20 trivia questions to prove your Will Ferrell superfan status.\n\nQ: What Was Ferrell's Major at USC?\n\nA California native, Ferrell was born and raised in Irvine, and later attended the University of Southern California. He graduated in 1990 with a Bachelor of Arts in Sports Information and is still a huge sports fan to this day even if he didn't pursue a broadcasting career.\n\nQ: How Many Times Has Ferrell hosted Saturday Night Live\n\nThe actor famously had his major breakout on SNL after he was discovered by the show's producer alongside Chris Kattan and Cheri Oteri at the Groundlings Comedy Theatre in Los Angeles. He was on the show from 1995-2002 and has since returned to host five times.\n\nQ: Which Austin Powers Movies Did Ferrell Appear In?\n\nFerrell had a small role as Mustafa, a henchman of Dr. Evil, in both the first and second Austin Powers movies, which lampooned James Bond to a T and are still pretty hilarious today.\n\nQ: What Silly Siblings did Ferrel Play with Chris Kattan on SNL\n\nFirst creating the characters at the Groundlings and later debuting them for the sketch \"The Roxbury Guys\" on SNL, Ferrell and Kattan were great together as The Butabi Brothers, who are pretty much always found at nightclubs trying and failing to pick up women.\n\nQ: Who played Al Gore on SNL Opposite Ferrell's George W. Bush?\n\nPresident George W. Bush was one of Ferrell's most legendary impressions, but Darrell Hammond was Just as funny as former Vice President Al Gore in some hilarious debate sketches.\n\nQ: Where Did the Name Mugatu Come From?\n\nFerrell played Jacobim Mugatu, the villainous mogul of the fashion industry satire film Zoolander. According to the film's director, star, and co-writer Ben Stiller, the name Mugatu came from his vast knowledge of Star Trek, which was a play on the monster called a Mugato.\n\nQ: Who was Considered for Buddy the Elf before Ferrell?\n\nFerrell actually wasn't the first choice for this hit Christmas comedy, which was written in 1993 with Jim Carrey in talks to star. Years later it went forward with Ferrell as the lead, and the rest was history. Here's another Christmas Ferrell fun fact: the actor worked as a mall Santa while making ends meet before his big break with Chris Kattan playing his elf.\n\nQ: What's the Fictional TV Network Ron Burgundy Anchors?\n\nAnchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy was a great showcase of Ferrell and his co-star's abilities to look like absolute buffoons to the most hilarious degree. Ron Burgundy is the anchor of KVWN channel 4 in San Diego, with his childhood friends as other reporters, and balks when he finds out they are hiring a female co-anchor: Veronica Corningstone. Anchorman just hit its 20th anniversary on July 9th.\n\nQ: How Many Stars did Roger Ebert Give Kicking & Screaming\n\nFerrell was all over the sports comedy genre in his early career, with this kid's movie co-starring Robert Duvall and Josh Hutcherson coming out in 2005. It got mostly mediocre reviews but noted critic Roger Ebert admitted it was formulaic but was charmed by Ferrell's performance and ended up giving it a solid three-star rating out of four.\n\nQ: What's the Name of Ferrell's Comedy Website?\n\nIn 2007, Ferrell co-founded a website with Adam McKay, Chris Henchy, and Mark Kvamme called Funny or Die which hosted some hilarious video sketches and shows like the perfectly awkward Between Two Ferns with Zach Galifianakis.\n\nQ: Who Were the NASCAR Cameos in Talladega Nights?\n\nFerrell and John C. Reilly were hilarious in their first movie together as immature NASCAR racers and best friends since childhood.
