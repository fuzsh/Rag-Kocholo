        "text": "If your name is Will Ferrell, today is a (relatively) good day. The star of The Land of the Lost and The Other Guys can no longer be tarnished with the mantle of Hollywood's least profitable star following the publication of the Forbes magazine list of the top 10 most overpaid actors.\n\nDrew Barrymore is the new queen of excess after Forbes noted that her recent films pulled in a meagre 40 cents per $1 spent. By comparison Ferrell, who has famously topped the list for the last two years running, is now worth $3.50 per $1.\n\nThe Saturday Night Live alumnus still finds himself in third place on the list largely thanks to the box-office failure of The Land of the Lost ($70m return on a $100m budget) in 2009. Last year's The Other Guys helped to improve his profitability with a healthy $170m gross.\n\nBarrymore's own fortunes have not been helped by dismal box-office returns for 2010 romantic comedy Going the Distance, which made just $17.8m. Her 2009 films Everybody's Fine and Whip It did even worse.\n\nIn second place is next year's Oscars host, Eddie Murphy. The comic appears to be attempting to return to the edgier style of humour that made his name with Brett Ratner's new film Tower Heist, and financial returns for his recent films may indicate why. For every $1 he was paid for family friendly comedies such as Meet Dave and Imagine That, Murphy returned just $2.70 per dollar.\n\nTwo Oscar-winners, Reese Witherspoon and Denzel Washington, land in fourth and fifth spots on the list respectively. Witherspoon returned $3.55 for every $1 and Washington managed $4.25. Further down are Nicolas Cage in sixth ($4.40 per $1), Adam Sandler and Vince Vaughn in joint seventh ($5.20 per $1), Tom Cruise in ninth ($6.35) per $1 and his former wife Nicole Kidman in tenth with $6.70 per $1."
