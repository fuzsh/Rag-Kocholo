Ferrell plays Gil, the Suburbans' bass player.\n\n\"Unlike 'That Thing You Do,' 'The Suburbans,' lacks innocence and a personable storyline, causing insufficient interest in the characters,\" according to MovieGuide.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe next came 30 years later, with 2019's \"Drunk Parents.\"\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 0%\n\nFerrell has a small part as a homeless person in \"Drunk Parents,\" which stars Salma Hayek and Alec Baldwin as a married couple on the verge of losing their house — so they decide to rent out their neighbor's house, which they're house-sitting, to make some quick cash.

There are no teenagers actually in it, just grown men who ought to know better,\" wrote Peter Bradshaw for The Guardian.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFerrell teamed up with John C. Reilly in 2018 for the buddy comedy \"Holmes & Watson,\" in which they play the famous detective duo.\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 10%\n\nFerrell and Reilly became the latest pair of actors to take on the iconic duo of Sherlock Holmes and John Watson — but their version was much less revered than Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman or Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law.\n\nRichard Propes of The Independent Critic called it \"one of the worst films of 2018.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne of the lowest-rated \"SNL\" sketch turned movies Ferrell starred in is the 1998 comedy \"A Night at the Roxbury.\"\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 11%\n\nFerrell and his \"SNL\" costar Chris Kattan reunited as the Butabi brothers in \"A Night at the Roxbury.\" Their only objective is to get into Los Angeles' hottest club, the Roxbury — and they'll stop at nothing to do it.\n\n\"The lame-o aspects of the whole campy setup are still lame-o,\" wrote Entertainment Weekly's Lisa Schwarzbaum.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"The Ladies Man,\" released in 2000, is also based on an \"SNL\" sketch, and it has the same score from critics.\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 11%\n\n\"The Ladies Man\" is based on a popular \"SNL\" sketch starring Tim Meadows as Leon Phelps, the titular Ladies Man. After he's fired from his job on TV giving relationship and romantic advice, he's forced to backtrack through his romantic relationships. Ferrell plays one of the many men whose significant others cheated on them with Leon.\n\n\"When Meadows's three-minute sketch persona is stretched out to cover a whole movie, the cracks soon start to show,\" wrote Peter Bradshaw for The Guardian.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFerrell teamed up with Amy Poehler to open an illegal casino in \"The House,\" released in 2017.\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 20%\n\nIn \"The House,\" Ferrell and Poehler play a married couple who, after their town's community scholarship is dissolved, are unable to pay their daughter's college tuition. To make ends meet, they start an underground casino in their basement with the help of their friend Frank (Jason Mantzoukas).\n\n\"A dark, startlingly bloody journey into the bitter, empty, broken heart of the American middle class, a blend of farce and satire built on a foundation of social despair,\" wrote AO Scott for The New York Times.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMark Wahlberg and Ferrell returned for the 2017 sequel \"Daddy's Home 2.\"\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 21%\n\nIn \"Daddy's Home 2,\" Ferrell and Wahlberg return as Brad and Dusty, former rivals and current co-parents whose bond is put to the test when their fathers enter their lives at Christmas, with John Lithgow playing Brad's dad Don and Mel Gibson playing Dusty's dad Kurt.\n\n\"Gibson could scarcely hope to play a character more like himself if he landed the lead in The Mel Gibson Story,\" wrote Ryan Gilbey for The New Statesman.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFerrell appeared in 2016 sequel \"Zoolander 2,\" reprising his role as Mugatu.\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 22%\n\nModels Derek Zoolander (Ben Stiller) and Hansel McDonald (Owen Wilson) are thrust back into the limelight after a string of superstars are murdered.

But when an upcoming merger with the NBA threatens to dissolve the Tropics, Jackie pulls out all the stops to bring in fans — and win some games.\n\nDavid Ansen of Newsweek wrote, \"The semi-funny 'Semi-Pro' is amiable enough, but you never feel there's much at stake.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe made an uncredited cameo in the 2019 film \"Zeroville,\" based on the 2007 novel of the same name.\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 23%\n\n\"Zeroville\" follows Vikar (James Franco) on his journey across '70s Hollywood, as he becomes more and more involved in the film industry. Ferrell has a small role as a big-time Hollywood producer, Rondell.\n\n\"This filth grates all the more because the film is so unbearably smug,\" wrote Little White Lies' Lillian Crawford.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFerrell costarred with Nicole Kidman in the 2005 remake of the '60s sitcom \"Bewitched.\"\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 24%\n\nIn a meta remake of the TV series, Ferrell stars as actor Jack Wyatt who wants to star in a revival of \"Bewitched\" as Darrin Stephens, and is looking for the perfect costar — enter Isabel Bigelow (Kidman), who is actually a witch, making her the perfect actress to play Samantha Stephens.\n\n\"Ms. Kidman and Mr. Ferrell are not an intuitive match, and the romantic side of the story is both half-hearted and half-baked,\" wrote Manohla Dargis for The New York Times.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2009, Ferrell starred in a remake of the '70s TV show \"Land of the Lost.\"\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 26%\n\nOne of the biggest flops of Ferrell's career is \"Land of the Lost,\" in which he stars as \"quantum paleontologist\" Rick Marshall. After getting humiliated by Matt Lauer on air, Rick's career is in the dumps until he's convinced by a fan to continue his work, leading him on a time-travel adventure back to the dinosaurs.\n\nJR Jones of Chicago Reader called the film a \"gigantic chunk of scat.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFerrell was also uncredited in the 2009 comedy \"The Goods: Live Hard, Sell Hard.\"\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 27%\n\nJeremy Piven stars as mercenary turned car salesman Don Ready, who is tasked with saving a failing dealership by any means necessary.

Seeing a chance to make some money for his family, Darnell agrees.\n\n\"For a movie that wants to send a message about privilege and prejudice, it displays a clumsiness and exemplifies a lot of the ignorance and thoughtlessness it wants to rage against,\" wrote Alex Abad-Santos for Vox.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFerrell played a funeral director in the 2000 comedy \"Drowning Mona.\"\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 29%\n\n\"Who killed Mona?\" is the leading question of \"Drowning Mona.\" As Chief Wyatt Rash (Danny DeVito) learns more about Mona (Bette Midler) and her friends and family, the suspects keep piling up.\n\nFerrell has a small role as Cubby, the funeral director of the funeral home Mona's family uses.\n\n\"My problem was that I didn't care who killed Mona Dearly, or why, and didn't want to know anyone in town except for Chief Rash and his daughter,\" wrote Roger Ebert.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUntil \"Barbie,\" the highest-grossing live-action film of Ferrell's career was 2015's \"Daddy's Home.\"\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 30%\n\nWhen Brad Whitaker (Ferrell) meets the biological father of his two stepkids, Dusty (Mark Wahlberg), he learns that Dusty's intentions are less than pure — he plans on getting his ex-wife Sara (Linda Cardellini) back and reuniting their family. This turns into a battle of the dads.\n\n\"It's predictable and often drearily formulaic fare, stretching what is essentially a single sketch joke to feature film length, with the specter of inevitable emotional resolution always lurking in the background,\" wrote Mark Kermode for The Observer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFerrell had a double role as Jesus and a popular high school student named Sky in 1999's \"Superstar,\" also based on an \"SNL\" sketch.\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 32%\n\n\"Superstar\" is based on the popular \"SNL\" sketch starring Molly Shannon as Mary Katherine Gallagher, an unpopular if delusionally over-confident student at Catholic school. In the film, Ferrell plays the object of Mary Katherine's affection, Sky, and also appears to Mary Katherine in a vision as Jesus.\n\n\"I'm not in favor of protesting films on the basis of theology, but to picket them because they're boring could be an act of mercy,\" wrote Roger Ebert.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"The Internship,\" released in 2013, features yet another uncredited Ferrell cameo.\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 35%\n\nEight years after \"Wedding Crashers,\" Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn reunited in 2013's \"The Internship,\" in which they play middle-aged men who, after getting laid off from their jobs, somehow land highly coveted internships at Google.\n\nFerrell plays Kevin, the manager of a mattress store that Nick (Wilson) works at before scoring the internship, in a one-scene role.\n\n\"You don't need a heart to like this movie. You need an MBA,\" wrote Grantland's Wesley Morris.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut the most surprising Ferrell cameo is in the 2020 \"Impractical Jokers\" movie, in which he's just a patron at a restaurant credited as Miami Restaurant Guy #4.\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 35%\n\n\"Impractical Jokers: The Movie\" is essentially an extended episode of the long-running truTV series which follows a group of comedians playing pranks on each other and unsuspecting civilians.\n\n\"An undistinguished and unnecessary extension of a brand whose primary attributes are likability, authenticity and relative modesty,\" wrote Variety's Mark Keizer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFerrell and Julia Louis-Dreyfus costarred in the 2020 American remake of \"Force Majeure,\" called \"Downhill.\"\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 36%\n\nA remake of the Swedish film \"Force Majeure,\" \"Downhill\" stars Ferrell and Julia Louis-Dreyfus as married couple Pete and Billie Stanton, who are forced to confront some unpleasant truths about their relationship after they're convinced they're about to die in an avalanche on a skiing trip.\n\n\"Inexplicably, Ferrell is the weakest link, downplaying his character's blooming sense of insecurity despite a celebrated propensity for aria-like tantrums. Why wasn't he allowed to go full 'Step Brothers'?\" wrote Joshua Rothkopf for Sight & Sound.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe played an owner of a mall in the 2012 absurdist comedy \"Tim & Eric's Billion Dollar Movie.\"\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 38%\n\nThis film, starring Tim Heidecker and Eric Wareheim as fictionalized versions of themselves, follows the two as they're given $1 billion to make a movie starring Johnny Depp — but when they squander the budget on a 3-minute film, they're on the hook to repay the studio $1 billion.\n\nThat's where Ferrell comes in — he plays the owner of a mall for sale who promises the new owners that they'll make $1 billion in profit.\n\n\"More-or-less abhorrent swill; vapid, painful and moronic in the way it treats its audience,\" wrote CineVue's Jamie Neish.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe played a supermarket clerk in \"The Wendell Baker Story.\"\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 40%\n\nThis film focuses on Wendell Baker (Luke Wilson), who goes to jail after his illegal ID business is busted by the authorities — and then his girlfriend Doreen (Eva Mendes) dumps him when he seems like he's too well-adjusted to jail.\n\nFerrell has a small role as Dave, Doreen's new boyfriend who Wendell encounters after he's released from jail.\n\n\"Given Luke Wilson's affability, it's also irresistibly charming. You may not buy the film's plot, but you'll invest in him as a man whose heart is always in the right place,\" wrote the Houston Chronicle's Bruce Westbrook.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn \"Kicking & Screaming,\" released in 2005, he played a mild-mannered dad who, after getting introduced to coffee, becomes an ultra-competitive soccer coach for his son.\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 41%\n\nPhil Weston (Ferrell) is a typical middle-aged man, married with a son, who has an estranged relationship with his ultra-competitive father (Robert Duvall). When father and son make a bet about who can coach the better soccer team, all hell breaks loose.\n\n\"There is a bit of heart in 'Kicking and Screaming,' with Ferrell and Duvall both giving nice performances,\" wrote Micheal Compton for Bowling Green Daily News.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFerrell reunited with Zooey Deschanel for the 2005 indie \"Winter Passing.\"\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 42%\n\nJust a few years after Ferrell and Deschanel played an unlikely couple in \"Elf,\" they reunited in \"Winter Passing,\" which stars Deschanel as Reese, a down-on-her-luck bartender who returns home to retrieve letters from her father (a reclusive, well-known author) and her late mother. Ferrell plays Corbit, a struggling musician living in her hometown who she bonds with.\n\n\"'Winter Passing' is one dull, extended encounter session among hackneyed characters,\" wrote Desson Thomson for the Washington Post.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2012's \"Casa de mi padre,\" Ferrell played an over-the-top telenovela hero.\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 42%\n\n\"Casa de mi padre,\" or \"House of My Father,\" stars Ferrell as Armando Álvarez, the heir to a Mexican ranch, who is dragged into a drug war after his little brother Raúl (Diego Luna) gets himself in over his head.\n\n\"It's all a little undercooked, playing more like an extended version of a very funny trailer than an actual, full-bodied comedy,\" wrote The Guardian's Phelim O'Neill.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFerrell had a small role in \"Melinda and Melinda,\" released in 2004.\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 51%\n\nDirected by Woody Allen, \"Melinda and Melinda\" is an interesting little movie, in which the same story is told twice — but one telling is a comedy and one is a tragedy. Ferrell, playing Hobie, appears in the comedic version of the film.\n\n\"Great premise, but talky dramedy doesn't deliver,\" wrote Nell Minow for Common Sense Media.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFerrell took on the role of Franz Liebkind in the 2005 film adaptation of the musical \"The Producers.\"\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 51%\n\nBased on the 2001 Broadway musical, which is in turn based on the 1967 Mel Brooks black comedy, \"The Producers\" stars Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick as two producers who attempt to scam the system by embezzling money from an intentionally horrible Broadway musical written by a former Nazi, Franz Liebkind (Ferrell).\n\n\"'The Producers' is a wonderful elegy for a certain kind of comic sensibility,\" wrote The Spectator's Mark Steyn.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFerrell played a federal marshal in \"Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back\" in 2001.\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 52%\n\nJay and Silent Bob (Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith) find out that the popular comic \"Bluntman and Chronic,\" based on them, is being turned into a movie without their permission or any royalties from Miramax.\n\nFerrell has a bit part of a federal wildlife marshal who interrupts a jewel heist.\n\nAlonso Duralde of The Advocate called the film \"gut-bustingly hilarious from start to finish.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFerrell returned as Mustafa in the 1999 sequel \"Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me.\"\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 53%\n\nMustafa returns in the 1999 sequel to \"International Man of Mystery,\" with Ferrell once again donning brown face and a fez to play the seemingly indestructible henchman. Unfortunately, the jokes don't land the same way in \"The Spy Who Shagged Me.\"\n\n\"In the context of the past few years, Austin Powers is essentially a walking, talking, hip-thrusting #MeToo lawsuit. The opening sequence in which he parades through a hotel lobby naked is literally just one long sex crime,\" wrote Alyssa Bereznak for The Ringer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe lowest-rated true classic Ferrell has starred in is 2008's \"Step Brothers.\"\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 55%\n\nFerrell and John C. Reilly play Brennan and Dale, adult men living at home, who are forced to move in together when Brennan's mom (Mary Steenburgen) marries Dale's dad (Richard Jenkins), even though they hate each other.\n\nHowever, they start to bond over common interests and decide to get their act together in time for the Catalina Wine Mixer.\n\n\"Make no mistake, 'Step Brothers' is a funny movie. It isn't a great movie. In fact, it's a pretty stupid movie. But it's a good stupid, and the chemistry between John C. Reilly and Will Ferrell makes it a fun one as well,\" wrote MTV's Dre Rivas.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe 2003 comedy \"Old School\" didn't fare much better with critics, though audiences loved it.\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 60%\n\nOld college friends Mitch (Luke Wilson), Frank (Ferrell), and Bernard (Vince Vaughn), team up to recapture their glory days by starting a fraternity after Mitch breaks up with his unfaithful girlfriend Heidi (Juliette Lewis).\n\n\"[Ferrell] knows how to make the most of the worst. God bless his little idiot-savant smile and vanity-free bared buttocks,\" wrote the Austin Chronicle's Kimberley Jones.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFerrell made yet another uncredited cameo in the 2004 film \"Starsky & Hutch,\" based on the '70s TV show of the same name.\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 63%\n\n\"Starsky & Hutch\" stars Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson as Starsky and Hutch, respectively. In the film, the two are partners at the Bay City Police Department. Over the course of the film, they try to solve a case, which leads them to Big Earl (Ferrell), the owner of a motorcycle bar who is in jail.\n\n\"Stiller and Wilson are still hilarious as the super-cool detectives — there hasn't been a comedy duo this good since John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd,\" wrote Chicago Reader's JR Jones.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFerrell and Rachel McAdams took on the role of Icelandic musicians in \"Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga\" in 2020.\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 63%\n\nFerrell and Rachel McAdams star as Lars Erickssong and Sigrit Ericksdóttir, two Icelandic best friends who decide to represent their country at the global singing competition Eurovision, putting them up against powerhouses like the Russian entrant Alexander Lemtov (Dan Stevens).\n\n\"It's exactly as silly and outlandish as it needs to be, while still paying sincere respect to one of Europe's great cultural quirks,\" wrote Clarisse Loughrey for The Independent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe played the villainous Mugatu in 2001's \"Zoolander.\"\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 64%\n\n\"Zoolander\" stars Ben Stiller as Derek Zoolander, a dimwitted model who becomes entangled in a plot to assassinate a political leader after he's brainwashed by the evil designer Mugatu (Ferrell).\n\n\"This light silly and fluffy satire of the fashion industry targets for a change not the female but male models,\" wrote Emanuel Levy for Variety.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHis most enduring character is easily newscaster Ron Burgundy from 2004's \"Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy.\"\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 66%\n\nFerrell's most iconic role of all time is Ron Burgundy, the news anchor of a San Diego local channel in the '70s. The film focuses on Ron and his colleagues, field reporter Brian Fantana (Paul Rudd), weatherman Brick Tamland (Steve Carell), and sportscaster Champ King (David Koechner), as they deal with a new hire at their channel, Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate).\n\nThat's really it — the enduring appeal of this movie rests on Ferrell's memorable performance and his infinitely quotable lines.\n\n\"'Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy' is one of the best comedies of this century,\" wrote Danielle Solzman for Solzy at the Movies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFerrell starred in the 2012 comedy \"The Campaign\" as an embattled congressman up for reelection.\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 66%\n\nFerrell stars as Representative Camden Brady, a congressman who is embroiled in a cheating scandal — and when his enemies get wind of this, they decide to prop up tour guide Marty (Zach Galifianakis) as his opponent in the race. The two quickly engage in a bitter race that surprises both of them.\n\nAndrew O'Hehir of Salon wrote, \"Simply taken as a broad character comedy, 'The Campaign' definitely has its moments.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe voiced the famed Man in the Yellow Hat in 2006's \"Curious George.\"\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 70%\n\nBased on the book series written by H. A. Rey and Margret Rey, \"Curious George\" stars Ferrell as Curious George's (Frank Welker) human friend, The Man in the Yellow Hat, given the name Ted in the film. After George follows Ted home from a trip to Africa, the unlikely duo get into all sorts of hijinks beloved by kids everywhere.\n\n\"It's a gentle, unhurried, largely hand-drawn children's cartoon with a nice simple storyline and no nods and winks to the grown-ups,\" wrote The Guardian's Steve Rose.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2007, he played the disgraced figure skater Chazz Michael Michaels in \"Blades of Glory.\"\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 70%\n\nFerrell and Jon Heder play Chazz Michael Michaels and Jimmy MacElroy, two figure skaters who team up as an ice-skating duo after they are each banned from singles skating — even though they hate each other.\n\n\"One of Ferrell's greatest gifts as a comic is the perfectly timed spontaneous gesture, facial expression or random action,\" wrote Richard Propes for The Independent Critic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFerrell played the titular Ricky Bobby in 2006's \"Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby.\"\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 71%\n\nRicky Bobby (Ferrell) becomes a hugely successful NASCAR driver, but when a crash shakes his confidence, he loses his best friend Cal (John C.
