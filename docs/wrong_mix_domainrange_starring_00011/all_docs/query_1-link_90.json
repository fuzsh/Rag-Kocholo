        "text": "A recently-opened bar in Williamsburg just might be the new hangout for fans of Quentin Tarantino movies.\n\nThe Tarantino-themed bar is owned by Michael Galkovich, who previously ran a Will Ferrell-themed bar in the Lower East Side.\n\nKill Bar had its big debut on Jan. 31, but the establishment ran a soft opening for most of last month.\n\nAs a big fan of Tarantino’s work, Galkovich enjoyed bringing together the theme of Kill Bar. From the food and drinks to the bar set-up inspired by the film “Inglorious Bastards,” Galkovich is proud of what he and his team put together.\n\n“I just wanted to pay homage to him, his body of work and all the amazing characters in his films,” he said.\n\nGalkovich commissioned local artist Amar Stewart to create and curate the main pieces of art at the bar, including an oil painting of The Bride from “Kill Bill.”\n\nIn addition to the art on the walls, the bar is decorated with Tarantino memorabilia and movie scenes are projected onto the blank side wall.\n\nThe bar also hosts weekly activities for its patrons. On Mondays, Kill Bar screens two different Tarantino films between the hours of 8 p.m. and midnight. These are the only nights that the movie projections have volume, giving visitors the opportunity to follow the plot.\n\nAdditionally, the bar hosts trivia nights on Tuesdays, where customers can show off their Tarantino knowledge.\n\n“For those fans who are into Tarantino, they feel like they’re at home, they feel like they couldn’t be at a better place to suit their soul or get their Tarantino fix,” Galkovich said."
