        "text": "Even better, if you watch the two movies together.\n\nI was singing the opening song for weeks. It had little to do with the film but I liked it. The carnage was laughable but there were long fights. I liked the fighting and cotton mouth was my favorate villain. She was so three-D that I believed that she would have some dumb fallowers. I felt sorry for her. Then, I realized that this was no normal slasher film, this film was trying to actually establish a great villain. The only problem with this villain is that I did not know much of her relationship to the main charecter. Where they friends? Did they even talk? Or, did they just go on missions together? That is why this is just a good movie. The other villian if you could call her that did not have very much background as the first. Her charector had a lot going on but there was no time to take all this information in. Maybe, she is a Mary Sue charecter put in just to test the main charecters basic fighting skill. Who know why she is in this film but she does not belong. She could be a reflection of the main charecters inablity to tell much about herself. Unlike the main charecter this villain has moved on. This might have been what would have happened to the main charecter. The film made me think, if there was no attempt on her life, would the main charecter have her own group? Or, would she be a housewife who has so much going on that she can barely keep up?Read full review\n\nNOT 4 ME\n\nI have a friend name Bill, whom I often want to kill, so finally watching this flick seemed like a reasonable alternative (as well as a possible source for some verbal ammunition to confront his ongoing contentiousness)! The trailer seemed interesting, featuring a brand of humor that is obviously on the macabre side, but outrageous and not to be taken too seriously. Unfortunately, the first fifteen minutes of the movie itself were enough to convince me that this is not the sort of thing I want to feed my brain. (This may seem a little prudish, but shouldn't be considered any more ridiculous than passing up a sweet appealing slice of chocolate cake in order to exercise the wisdom and discipline necessary to avoid the excess calories and ugly weight gain). That being said, I'm pretty sure there was more bad than good that ended up in my trash can! I don't find blood and gore entertaining, nor do I enjoy a constant onslaught of foul language. I hear enough of that at work! I'm also a little creeped out by that fact that the actor who played Bill did a pretty good job of killing his own self.Read full review\n\nVerified purchase: Yes | Condition: Pre-owned\n\nONE OF THE BEST MOVIES! INSTANT CLASSIC! HIGHLY RECOM'D\n\nThis is considered to be one the best movie directed by Mr Quentin Tarantino as well as best performance by Uma Thurman in a starting role. I would say the originality of the movie along with the screenplay is breathtaking enough. A must have for anyone that a portable DVD player or laptop w. DVD player because When your on the go on a subway, airplane or long road trip this is a great film to watch. Quentin Tarantino does a great job with this movie. The style and flow of the movie is great and leaves the audience wanting more. There is nothing i do not like about the movie. I have seen this movie in the theatre twice, and own this DVD because it is a must have. I highly recommend this movie, because this movie has been reviewed by many critics and they all agree it is a &quot;A\" quality movie. Every time you see the movie again, you will see it from a new light or angle. You can never see it too many times, because each time you get a more \"aesthetic\" appreciation for the movie, unlike other movies where you see it once and toss it to your collection, this one you can watch it several times a year and see new meaning. This is also a must have for anyone who is in the movie business, whether you are an aspiring actor/director writer, you can learn new things each time you watch it. Overall the movie is an A+ good directing, script, and acting and the lines are very original along with some of the costumes and techniques by the director. Good camera angles and sharp movement. Great music as well. Be sure to get your copy today. The movie has many extras too. which I have seen many times! It is worth your time.Read full review\n\noff the wal\n\nTarantino was the main reason for the purchase.His movies are totally off the wall.This was no evception.But i was almost ready to hit eject before it started.The opening song almost drove me nuts.It got on my nerves.As with any of Tarantino's movies you do not start at the beginning.There is a lot of flashback so as to keep you on your toes.The japanese spoken then the white translation underneathe made it difficult to stay on track sometimes.I figured it was important so I hit rewind a couple of times.As his norm he mixed violence with comedy.You don't stop a vicious knife fight between 2 \"hot\" looking chicks because the young daughter comes home for school.You are hiding the knives behind your backs,the living room is in shambles and glass all over the place,and blood and cuts are on both the women.Then they ask the little girl how her day was at school.There are certain chapters for this plan of revenge.Certain people must die.You ask how all this started 9 people \"the bride'UMA THURMAN\" are killed in a small town.They even kill the piano player.Then total shock the the characters are cartoon like.Animated people with excessive blood coming from the limbs.back to the real people a sword fight.One against 300 ninjas.you guessed it she kills them all.She says \"her fight is not with them so everydody that can walk or crawl can leave.But leave your limbs on the floor.\"When a limb was cut off the blood would spray so much other warriors would be slipping on the blood.Oh yes this is a bloody,gory,legs severed,heads rolling around,arms used for battle scenerio.At one point you hope you die before the dvd blunged you to death or worse.The songs in the back ground will destroy what ever your taste for music you possess.The profanity is expected in Tarantinos movies.It si not as frequent as \"Dog Day Afternoon\" but when you drive around in a bright yellow truck wagon with the words in red\"PUSSY WAGON\" across the tailgate,well you get my drift.Then the most horrifying event happens you must rent or buy a volume 2 to see how she \"KILLS BILL.\"Call me a mascosist but I have the 2nd one ready to put in.The only social redeeming value I can bring to this great world after watching this dvd is that I have watched another Tarantino movie.First it is not for the squeamish.It uses cartoon figures.Uses subtitles.It uses flashback.It uses profanity.Tons of kung fu fighting.Insane plots and sayings.Then pure white driven snow when you least expect it.Then if none of this strikes a cord of out of the ordinary in your brain than this is the most wonderful movie for you.Any one that watches a Tarantino movie knows what they are in for rather the script be good,bad or Tarantino.On a scale from 1-10 where 10 i would highly recommend and zero get your money back even if it was free.I would give it a 7.Step lightly and carry a mop bucket to just clean up the blood spewing from the eyeball socket she yanks durning one of the fight scenes.Did I mention at one point she convinces her big toe to wiggle that it was in a coma state.Read full review"
