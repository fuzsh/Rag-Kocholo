        "text": "Will Ferrell (born July 16, 1967, Irvine, California, U.S.) is an American comedy actor, writer, and producer known for his impersonations and for his portrayal of dim-witted but endearing characters.\n\nFerrell grew up in suburban Irvine, California, where he played varsity football and drew laughs for reading the high school’s morning announcements in a variety of voices. He later studied sports journalism at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles. After graduating in 1990, he worked as a sports broadcaster on local cable before studying acting and comedy. After a year of training with the Los Angeles improv comedy group the Groundlings, he became a member of the company, and in 1995 he was invited to join the television sketch show Saturday Night Live (SNL).\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nWill Ferrell Quiz\n\nWith his manic energy, outlandish gags, and energetic commitment even to a failing joke, Ferrell became a fixture on SNL. He was well known for his impersonations, notably of game show host Alex Trebek, sportscaster Harry Caray, and U.S. Pres. George W. Bush. While on SNL, Ferrell also appeared in such feature films as the James Bond parody Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery (1997); Dick (1999), a satire of the Watergate scandal; and Zoolander (2001; he later appeared in its 2016 sequel as well), a fashion-industry send-up.\n\nIn 2002 Ferrell left SNL to focus on a film career, often collaborating with Adam McKay, a writer and director he had met on SNL. The following year Ferrell was one of the stars in Old School, and he took the lead role in Elf (2003), playing a charmingly naive human raised in Santa’s village who ventures to New York City. Both films were box office successes. He then starred in a string of hit comedies, notably Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy (2004) and the NASCAR spoof Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby (2006), both of which he cowrote with McKay. In 2005 Ferrell portrayed a Nazi playwright in the musical comedy The Producers, and he played equally outlandish characters in the sports comedies Blades of Glory (2007) and Semi-Pro (2008).\n\nHis subsequent film roles included a bumbling scientist in the adventure comedy Land of the Lost (2009) and an alien supervillain in the animated Megamind (2010). Although most of Ferrell’s film work was broadly comic in tone, he occasionally took on more serious roles, including a methodical Internal Revenue Service agent in Stranger than Fiction (2006) and an alcoholic selling his possessions in Everything Must Go (2010), an adaptation of a Raymond Carver short story.\n\nIn 2006 Ferrell and McKay launched Gary Sanchez Productions. Through that company they produced several other movies in which Ferrell starred, including the farcical Step Brothers (2008), which they cowrote; the buddy-movie parody The Other Guys (2010); Casa de mi padre (2012; “My Father’s House”), a Spanish-language send-up of Mexican telenovelas; the political satire The Campaign (2012); and Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues (2013). The production company was also behind Funny or Die (funnyordie.com), a Web site that first garnered notice with a short video of Ferrell being intimidated by his landlady, a beer-swigging potty-mouthed toddler.\n\nFerrell voiced a tyrannical businessman in The LEGO Movie (2014), a computer-animated film that used renderings of plastic LEGO toys as the characters and set pieces. He also lent his voice to the sequel, The LEGO Movie 2: The Second Part (2019). In the racially charged satire Get Hard (2015), Ferrell played a hedge-fund manager who, after being framed for insider trading, looks to a black employee (Kevin Hart) for assistance on learning how to survive in prison. He played a hapless stepfather whose relationship with his stepchildren is challenged by the arrival of their father (Mark Wahlberg) in Daddy’s Home (2015). In 2017 he reprised the role in Daddy’s Home 2 and also starred with Amy Poehler in The House, about a suburban couple who run an illegal casino in order to pay for their daughter’s college tuition. In Holmes & Watson (2018), Ferrell assumed the role of Sherlock Holmes for the comedic take on Arthur Conan Doyle’s classic tales. His film credits from 2020 included Downhill, a dramedy about a struggling couple on a family vacation, and Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga, in which he starred as an aspiring Icelandic musician. He later appeared with Ryan Reynolds in Spirited (2022), a musical comedy inspired by Charles Dickens’s A Christmas Carol. He then played the head of the toy company Mattel in Greta Gerwig’s Barbie (2023).\n\nIn 2009 Ferrell made his Broadway debut in the one-man play You’re Welcome America. A Final Night with George W. Bush, which he wrote. The play featured Ferrell’s Bush giving some imaginative reminiscences and defenses of his administration. It earned a Tony Award nomination for special theatrical event and was broadcast on the cable channel HBO at the end of the stage production’s run in March 2009. Ferrell periodically returned to the small screen for guest appearances, notably on several episodes of the sitcoms 30 Rock (in 2010 and 2012) and The Office (in 2011). He was also featured in the comic miniseries The Spoils of Babylon (2014) and The Spoils Before Dying (2015) as a bloviating author and director. In The Shrink Next Door (2021), a miniseries based on a podcast, Ferrell played an insecure man who becomes a patient of a manipulative psychiatrist (Paul Rudd)."
