        "text": "When you think about it, Will Ferrell is an unlikely movie star. Once upon a time, during his Saturday Night Live days, he was a classic scene-stealer: He'd show up in someone else's film, playing an incompetent henchman, or a dumb jock, or Jesus — and methodically make off with the picture. Then, almost overnight, he became a superstar in his own right, going from comic-relief sidekicks and wild-card cameos to headlining a number of comedies that became monumental blockbusters. His talents, of course, are considerable: With his beefy presence and his seemingly supernatural ability to randomly switch between mousy and blowhard, he is an intrepid, unpredictable screen presence.\n\nThat has served Ferrell well; occasionally, however, it's allowed him to coast, too. He's made his share of classics, but he's also racked up an unfortunate number of films where the biggest joke is merely the sight of him in a goofy wig or weird outfit. Regardless, he is one of the biggest comic actors of our time, and, as this ranked list of his big-screen role s proves, is one of the most prolific as well. On the eve of his latest movie Get Hard, we present the good, the bad and the fugly of Will Ferrell's big-screen career — ranked for your pleasure."
