        "text": "Share this Article:\n\nSeveral Quentin Tarantino films are set to get cinema re-releases, as he reveals more details of his next film, The Movie Critic.\n\nQuentin Tarantino is gearing up to shoot what he has long claimed will be his last film, The Movie Critic. Set in Los Angeles in 1977, early reports suggested that the film would be based upon legendary film critic Pauline Kael, but Tarantino dismissed them as being wide of the mark. In typical Tarantino fashion, The Film Critic will draw its influence from a more off-brand film writer and the filmmaker has been discussing the particulars of his lead character ahead of a reported autumn shoot, although that date hasn’t been confirmed by Tarantino himself.\n\nSpeaking about the unnamed critic in question, Tarantino said that “he wrote about mainstream movies and he was the second-string critic. I think he was a very good critic. He was as cynical as hell. His reviews were a cross between early Howard Stern and what Travis Bickle [Robert DeNiro’s character in Taxi Driver] might be if he were a film critic. Think about Travis’s diary entries. But the porno rag critic was very, very funny. He was very rude, you know. He cursed. He used racial slurs. But his s— was really funny. He was as rude as hell.”\n\nIn the Deadline interview, Tarantino also mentions that both Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio are too old for the role and he goes into some details about why he won’t cast a UK actor for the part. On that topic, he states “nothing against the Brits, but we’re living in a really weird time now. I think when people look back on this era of cinema and it’s just all these British actors pretending to be Americans and all these Australian actors pretending to be Americans, it’s like phantoms. Nobody is acting in their own voice.”\n\nTarantino goes into more detail on that topic and his thoughts are worth checking out.\n\nMeanwhile, according to The Hollywood Reporter, Lionsgate has just picked up the rights to both Kill Bill films and Jackie Brown. The studio has already announced that we will see theatrical rereleases of the films, including a 4K remaster of Kill Bill. That means that the studio now has the rights to eight of Tarantino’s films, meaning we could be on for a seriously hardcore cinematic marathon at some point, maybe to celebrate the release of his supposed final film?\n\nImage: BigStock\n\n—\n\nThank you for visiting!
