Fox, and their leader “Bill” (David Carradine) - The Bride's former lover who shot her in the head, thinking he killed her and her unborn child. The Bride - aka Beatrix Kiddo - journeys to many places, including to Tokyo where she battles the yakuza. The Bride, formelry know as Black Mamba in the Deadly Viper Assasination Squad, will stop at nothing until she gets to Kill Bill.\n\nTarantino was inspired by Shaw Brothers Studio and included an anime sequence by Production I.G.
