        "text": "Step Brothers fans, your time has come: Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly are reportedly doing another movie together.\n\nThe duo will star in Holmes & Watson, adding yet another entry to Hollywood’s illustrious list of Sherlock Holmes adaptations. But don’t expect them to slip on monocles and brush up their British accents just yet. The film is inspired by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s tale, but has a comedic, PG-13 twist, Deadline reports. Etan Cohen, who recently directed Ferrell’s Get Hard, will helm the project.\n\nFerrell will play Holmes and Reilly will play Watson. Their adaptation will join a number of modern Sherlockian projects, including BBC’s Sherlock with Benedict Cumberbatch, CBS’s Elementary starring Jonny Lee Miller and Lucy Liu, and rumblings of a long-gestating Sherlock 3 with Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law. But if there’s anyone who can bring, at the very least, a unique approach to the famous detective story, it’s the jubilant tag team of Reilly and Ferrell, whose brand of deviant comedy will almost certainly spice up a property that’s been told on-screen again and again and again. Audiences don’t really need another Sherlock story, after all, but they’ve shown that they like this duo very, very much.\n\nBut what took so long for Reilly and Ferrell to get back in theaters together in the first place? Step Brothers, released in 2008, was a financial and pop-cultural success, with lines from the movie slipping into everyday conversation (“Did we just become best friends?” “Yup!”). Director and co-writer Adam McKay told Collider that he was ready back then to do a Step follow-up, but then Paramount showed interest in green-lighting an Anchorman sequel instead. After making Anchorman 2, he cooled off on the idea of more sequels—saying he might be open to revisiting Step Brothers, but it would have to wait a few years.\n\nAfter the success of that film, Ferrell and Reilly busied themselves with myriad projects, only briefly appearing together in things like Tim and Eric’s Billion Dollar Movie. There were reports in 2014 that the pair would finally join forces again for a border-patrol comedy about two friends who “give purpose to their lives by protecting America’s borders from illegal immigrants.” Which, you know, doesn’t sound great, considering the Trumpified nature of politics today. However, McKay mentioned the film again earlier this year, adding that the script would be drafted by Jesse Armstrong, who wrote the critically acclaimed political satire In the Loop.\n\nBut now there’s Holmes and Watson, which, incidentally, almost didn’t happen. The adaptation was in talks as early as 2008, with Talladega Nights star Sacha Baron Cohen originally slated to co-star alongside Ferrell. However, Downey Jr.’s Sherlock was slated for a 2009 release, so the project never really came to fruition. Now that Reilly’s available, Sony decided to set the wheels in motion again, with Deadline reporting that plans came together “very quickly” over the last few weeks. So . . . perhaps audiences will get this and a border-patrol comedy (if McKay has his way)? At the very least, it looks like the Ferrell-Reilly drought is really, truly coming to an end.\n\nWhere There Isn't A Will\n\nFollowing Expected Backlash, Will Ferrell Distances Self from Ronald Reagan Comedy\n\nThe actor’s camp states that Ferrell had never made any sort of commitment to the controversial project.\n\nExclusives\n\nIf John C. Reilly Can’t Find Love, He Wants to Become a Parrot\n\nWatch a funny, deeply weird clip from the new film The Lobster.\n\nBush League\n\nWill Ferrell’s George W.
