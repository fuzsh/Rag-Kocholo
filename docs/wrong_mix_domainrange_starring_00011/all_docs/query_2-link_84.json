        "text": "Save the date.\n\nThe trailer for a new comedy starring Reese Witherspoon and Will Ferrell released on Tuesday, and features the pair waging wedding war at a remote resort off the Carolina coast. You’re Cordially Invited captures the chaos that ensues when Witherspoon’s character discovers that the venue booked for her sister (played by Meredith Hagner) has been double-booked by another bride (Geraldine Viswanathan) and her father (Ferrell).\n\n“Let’s get something straight,” Ferrell threatens Witherspoon in the clip. “If I look out on that dock, and that bride’s not my baby girl, that bride’s going in the fucking lake. Splish, splash, bitch. Taking a bath.”\n\nWitherspoon shoots back: “I’m gonna kick your ass, and it’s going to be embarrassing because you’re big, and I’m little.”\n\nTrending\n\nElsewhere in the trailer, Ferrell is seen wrestling a live alligator in bed and running down a hall from what seems to be enraged wedding guests. Nicholas Stoller — who directed Forgetting Sarah Marshall, Get Him to the Greek, and Neighbors (a film with a similar not-my-turf theme) — will helm the film, which is slated for release via Amazon Prime Video on Jan. 30, 2025."
