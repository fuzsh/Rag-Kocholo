        "text": "Ideas Competition (2003)\n\nTo build excitement for the High Line’s potential as a public space, Friends of the High Line launched an open, international ideas competition, soliciting innovative proposals for the High Line’s reuse. Entries did not have to be practical or realistic. Entrants were encouraged to be bold and forward-thinking—to create visions as unique and unexpected as the High Line itself.\n\nWe received ideas from 720 individuals and teams, representing 36 countries, and including ideas as wild as a giant roller coaster and a mile-long lap pool. A panel of jurors awarded four principal winners, three special award winners, ten honorable mentions, and more than 150 other noteworthy proposals, which were displayed at Grand Central Terminal that summer.\n\nDesign Competition (2004)\n\nIn 2004, Friends of the High Line and the City of New York partnered to select the High Line’s design team through an invited design competition. Our original Request for Qualifications received responses from 52 teams, each of which included experts from the fields of architecture, landscape architecture, engineering, art, urban planning, and horticulture. Four finalist teams proposed their design approach to the High Line—not intended to be final plans, but rather framework plans and strategies of the direction each team would take if selected. Those four submissions were exhibited for the public at New York City’s The Center for Architecture in summer 2004, and can be viewed below.\n\nField Operations, Diller Scofidio + Renfro, and Piet Oudolf\n\nZaha Hadid Architects with Balmori Associates, Skidmore, Owings & Merrill LLP, and studio MDA\n\nSteven Holl Architects with Hargreaves Associates and HNTB\n\nTerraGRAM: Michael Van Valkenburgh Associates with D.I.R.T. Studio and Beyer Blinder Belle\n\nIn October 2004, a Steering Committee made up of representatives from the City of New York and Friends of the High Line selected the team of Field Operations (Project Lead), Diller Scofidio + Renfro, and Piet Oudolf to begin design work on the High Line.\n\nConstruction\n\nConverting each section of the High Line from an abandoned rail line to a public landscape entailed not only years of planning, community input, and design work, but also more than two years of construction for each section.\n\nRemoval & site preparation\n\nConstruction began with removing everything on the structure, including rail tracks, gravel ballast, soil and plantings, debris, and a thin layer of concrete. As each section of rail track was removed, it was tagged, surveyed, and stored—many of the rails and other artifacts were returned to their original locations and integrated into the landscape design.\n\nAfter removals, the steel elements of the High Line were sandblasted to remove the original lead paint. A containment tent was used to envelope one 25-foot section of the High Line at a time. After the sandblasting operation was complete, the steel was then repainted to match the original color of the High Line. Finally, concrete repairs and waterproofing work was completed. The High Line structure itself is structurally sound—it was built to carry two fully-loaded freight trains—but repurposing it required these minor repairs.\n\nLandscape construction\n\nIn the final phase of construction, the High Line pathways, access points, plantings, furnishings, and lighting were installed. The pathways, created from precast concrete pavers—or planks—were laid into place onto a series of pedestal supports, and irrigation and electrical infrastructure elements were run in the void beneath them. In some locations where stairs were installed, steel girders were removed—allowing the stairs to pass through the structure of the High Line itself, and providing an opportunity for visitors to see the massive steel girders supporting the entire structure. Additionally, energy-efficient LED lighting elements were installed to illuminate the park’s pathways at night without conflicting with the ambient light of the surrounding city sky."
