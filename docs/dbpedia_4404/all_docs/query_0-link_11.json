        "text": "At this time\n\nIn a period when James Watt perfected the steam engine and American independence was recognised, social change dominated the 19th Century. The first telephone call, the first light bulb and the abolishment of slavery soon followed, sweeping in a second industrial revolution that saw William Bass open his first brewery. As the railways opened, mobility and urbanisation exploded, enabling Bass to take his beer worldwide and become the world’s largest brewer by the end of the century.\n\n1875\n\nBass registers the UK’s first trademark\n\nA pioneer in international brand marketing, Bass registers its Red Triangle under the UK's Trade Marks Registration Act 1875 – the first trademark in the UK.\n\nThe Act came into effect on 1 January 1876 and legend has it that a Bass employee queued overnight outside the registrar's office on New Year's Eve in order to be the first in line to register. As a result, Bass received the first two registrations, the Bass Red Triangle for their pale ale and a Bass Red Diamond for their strong ale.\n\nAt this time\n\nThe 20th-century began without cars, planes, TVs and computers, but that was all to change. Breakthrough inventions transformed lives, including the first flight by the Wright brothers, Henry Ford's first Model-T, and Albert Einstein's Theory of Relativity. Propelled by the continuing popularity of rail, the emergence of the automobile, and the first jet air flights, travel grew and sparked innovation in hospitality.\n\nAt this time\n\nThe 1950s are remembered as a prosperous time of recovery from the Great Depression and the war years. A time of looking forward and optimism, of new heroes like Elvis Presley, Marilyn Monroe and Grace Kelly. The first commercial air flights from London to Johannesburg and Colombo signaled the dawn of the jet age, heralding the start of the modern tourism industry. Holiday club destinations arrived on the scene, a precursor for today’s all-inclusive resorts.\n\n1952\n\nHoliday Inn opens its doors in Memphis, Tennessee\n\nOn a family trip to Washington DC, businessman Kemmons Wilson has the idea of providing travelling families with comfortable and affordable accommodation they could trust.\n\nStarting in Memphis, his vision would become a reality in a big way.\n\nAt this time\n\nThe 1970s was defined as a \"pivot of change\". Economic upheavals and recession end the postwar economic boom and modern computing is born, with the world's first microprocessor and email. Social progressive values such as increasing political awareness and the economic liberty of women grew, and technology was brought to life through microwave ovens, VCRs, and cell phones.\n\nAt this time\n\nProsperity reigned, with steady economic growth for much of the decade characterised by the rise of multiculturalism and alternative media. Movements such as grunge, rave and hip hop spread around the world, influenced by Generation X, Generation Y and the Millennials. Youth culture embraced environmentalism and entrepreneurship with increased individuality. By now, Internet access was available in more than 50% of some Western countries, its use revolutionising travel services and transforming tourism and hospitality into big business.\n\n1990\n\nBass takes full control of Holiday Inn; Holiday Inn Express joins the party\n\nBass buys the remaining North American part of the Holiday Inn business and, owning the world-famous brand entirely, sets its sights on expansion.\n\nIts first move is to launch Holiday Inn Express® , aimed at smart travellers with a new service style.\n\n1997\n\nBass sells its leased pubs and smaller businesses\n\nBass renews its focus on hotels and pubs after the British Government blocks its attempt to acquire half of the Carlsberg-Tetley brewing business.\n\nThe business splits into separate brewing and retailing divisions, and sells off its leased pubs and other businesses, including Gala bingo and Coral bookmakers.\n\nBass launches Staybridge Suites\n\nBass launches Staybridge Suites® by Holiday Inn across North America, looking after travellers spending long periods away from home.\n\nAt the same time, Bass sells its North American midscale hotel buildings but retains control of their branding through innovative franchise agreements.\n\nAt this time\n\nThe new millennium was met with confidence and optimism around the world, and marked by a new focus. Following long term growth, energy resources started diminishing and global warming properly hits the world agenda. The Internet became a mainstay, driving faster communications through mobile phones, e-mail and social networking sites. The decade ends with a crisis in housing credit in the US, which sparks a major global financial recession.\n\nAt this time\n\nThe 2010s began amidst a global financial crisis, and the decade is characterised by economic and political upheaval. China replaced the US as the world's largest trading nation, and politics increasingly polarises as governments grapple with a far wider range of social, economic and environmental issues. In the home, the baby boomers generation approached retirement, increasing the ageing population, and rapidly developing technology changes how we all work and live.\n\nIHG launches True Hospitality for Good\n\nIHG’s programme for communities and charitable giving works with partners to help change lives for the better through building skills and education in hospitality, and supporting communities when disasters strike. Giving for Good month, which is a part of True Hospitality for Good, provides thousands of IHG colleagues worldwide with a chance to give back to others.\n\nMore on True Hospitality for Good\n\n2020\n\nIHG focuses on providing True Hospitality for Good\n\nUnderlining a commitment to doing the right thing, IHG evolves its purpose from True Hospitality for Everyone to True Hospitality for Good, focused on making a positive difference every day to our people, guests, owners and communities, and to protect the world around us.\n\n2021\n\nIHG becomes IHG Hotels & Resorts\n\nTo showcase a rapidly growing family of trusted brands to a new generation, IHG becomes IHG Hotels & Resorts, with bold new branding and logo and its broad portfolio grouped into four easy-to-navigate collections – Luxury & Lifestyle, Premium, Essentials and Suites – while IHG Rewards Club becomes IHG Rewards.\n\nIHG embarks on a Journey to Tomorrow\n\nIHG launches Journey to Tomorrow, an ambitious 10-year responsible business action plan with science-led targets tied to the UN Sustainable Development Goals.
