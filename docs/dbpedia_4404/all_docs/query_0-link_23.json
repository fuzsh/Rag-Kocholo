        "text": "This is the article to give to your boss or anyone else who doesn't have much time, but needs to know the basic usability facts.\n\nWhat — Definition of Usability\n\nUsability is a quality attribute that assesses how easy user interfaces are to use. The word \"usability\" also refers to methods for improving ease-of-use during the design process.\n\nUsability is defined by 5 quality components:\n\nLearnability: How easy is it for users to accomplish basic tasks the first time they encounter the design?\n\nEfficiency: Once users have learned the design, how quickly can they perform tasks?\n\nMemorability: When users return to the design after a period of not using it, how easily can they reestablish proficiency?\n\nErrors: How many errors do users make, how severe are these errors, and how easily can they recover from the errors?\n\nSatisfaction: How pleasant is it to use the design?\n\nThere are many other important quality attributes. A key one is utility, which refers to the design's functionality: Does it do what users need?\n\nUsability and utility are equally important and together determine whether something is useful: It matters little that something is easy if it's not what you want. It's also no good if the system can hypothetically do what you want, but you can't make it happen because the user interface is too difficult. To study a design's utility, you can use the same user research methods that improve usability.\n\nDefinition of Utility = whether it provides the features you need.\n\nDefinition of Usability = how easy & pleasant these features are to use.\n\nDefinition of Useful = usability + utility.\n\nWhy Usability Is Important\n\nOn the Web, usability is a necessary condition for survival. If a website is difficult to use, people leave. If the homepage fails to clearly state what a company offers and what users can do on the site, people leave. If users get lost on a website, they leave. If a website's information is hard to read or doesn't answer users' key questions, they leave. Note a pattern here? There's no such thing as a user reading a website manual or otherwise spending much time trying to figure out an interface. There are plenty of other websites available; leaving is the first line of defense when users encounter a difficulty.\n\nThe first law of ecommerce is that if users cannot find the product, they cannot buy it either.\n\nFor intranets, usability is a matter of employee productivity. Time users waste being lost on your intranet or pondering difficult instructions is money you waste by paying them to be at work without getting work done.\n\nCurrent best practices call for spending about 10% of a design project's budget on usability. On average, this will more than double a website's desired quality metrics (yielding an improvement score of 2.6) and slightly less than double an intranet's quality metrics. For software and physical products, the improvements are typically smaller — but still substantial — when you emphasize usability in the design process.\n\nFor internal design projects, think of doubling usability as cutting training budgets in half and doubling the number of transactions employees perform per hour. For external designs, think of doubling sales, doubling the number of registered users or customer leads, or doubling whatever other KPI (key performance indicator) motivated your design project.\n\nHow to Improve Usability\n\nThere are many methods for studying usability, but the most basic and useful is user testing, which has 3 components:\n\nGet hold of some representative users, such as customers for an ecommerce site or employees for an intranet (in the latter case, they should work outside your department).\n\nAsk the users to perform representative tasks with the design.\n\nObserve what the users do, where they succeed, and where they have difficulties with the user interface. Shut up and let the users do the talking.\n\nIt's important to test users individually and let them solve any problems on their own. If you help them or direct their attention to any particular part of the screen, you have contaminated the test results.\n\nTo identify a design's most important usability problems, testing 5 users is typically enough. Rather than run a big, expensive study, it's a better use of resources to run many small tests and revise the design between each one so you can fix the usability flaws as you identify them. Iterative design is the best way to increase the quality of user experience. The more versions and interface ideas you test with users, the better.\n\nUser testing is different from focus groups, which are a poor way of evaluating design usability. Focus groups have a place in market research, but to evaluate interaction designs you must closely observe individual users as they perform tasks with the user interface. Listening to what people say is misleading; you have to watch what they actually do.\n\nWhen to Work on Usability\n\nUsability plays a role in each stage of the design process. The resulting need for multiple studies is one reason I recommend making individual studies fast and cheap. Here are the main steps:\n\nBefore starting the new design, test the old design to identify the good parts that you should keep or emphasize, and the bad parts that give users trouble.\n\nUnless you're working on an intranet, test your competitors' designs to get cheap data on a range of alternative interfaces that have similar features to your own. (If you work on an intranet, read the intranet design annual to learn from other designs.)\n\nConduct a field study to see how users behave in their natural habitat.\n\nMake paper prototypes of one or more new design ideas and test them. The less time you invest in these design ideas the better, because you'll need to change them all based on the test results.\n\nRefine the design ideas that test best through multiple iterations, gradually moving from low-fidelity prototyping to high-fidelity representations that run on the computer. Test each iteration.\n\nInspect the design relative to established usability guidelines whether from your own earlier studies or published research.\n\nOnce you decide on and implement the final design, test it again. Subtle usability problems always creep in during implementation.\n\nDon't defer user testing until you have a fully implemented design. If you do, it will be impossible to fix the vast majority of the critical usability problems that the test uncovers. Many of these problems are likely to be structural, and fixing them would require major rearchitecting.\n\nThe only way to a high-quality user experience is to start user testing early in the design process and to keep testing every step of the way.\n\nWhere to Test"
