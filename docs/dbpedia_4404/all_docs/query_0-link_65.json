        "text": "The Prosci ADKAR® Model is one of the two foundational models of the Prosci Methodology, in addition to the PCT Model. The word “ADKAR” is an acronym for the five outcomes an individual needs to achieve for a change to be successful: Awareness, Desire, Knowledge, Ability and Reinforcement.\n\nThe model was developed nearly two decades ago by Prosci founder Jeff Hiatt after studying the change patterns of more than 700 organizations. The ADKAR Model is used by thousands of change leaders around the world.\n\nThis powerful model is based on the understanding that organizational change can only happen when individuals change. Whereas the Prosci 3-Phase Process is a framework for organizational change, the ADKAR Model focuses on individual change—guiding individuals through a particular change and addressing any roadblocks or barrier points along the way.\n\nOrganizational changes often fail because employees don’t understand the importance of getting on board the change or how to successfully make the change. They simply understand that a change is happening. And leaders are often not equipped to engage individuals effectively during the change and to manage any potential resistance.\n\nThe ADKAR Model addresses these challenges by equipping leaders with the right strategies and tools, and individuals with the right information, motivation and ability to successfully move through changes in the organization.\n\nBy outlining the goals and outcomes of successful change, the ADKAR Model enables leaders and change management teams to focus their activities on what will drive individual change and therefore achieve organizational results.\n\nActivities for moving individuals through ADKAR transitions happen during Phase 2 – Manage Change of the Prosci 3-Phase Process, and are scalable to fit your needs. You apply the ADKAR Model using Proxima, an innovative online tool you access via the Prosci Hub Solution Suite in the Prosci Portal.\n\nIn Proxima, you use tools such as the ADKAR Blueprint—the backbone of Prosci change management—to identify milestones, target dates and anticipated gaps. You also use the ADKAR Blueprint to help in developing your change management plans, such as the Sponsor Plan and People Manager Plan.\n\nThe ADKAR Assessment helps to identify any barrier points to change for individual roles so you can support these individuals in progressing through the change. ADKAR status checks along the way are key to project success. Practitioners use both the Prosci ADKAR Model and the Prosci 3-Phase Process to achieve sustainable change.\n\nStep into the transformative world of change with The ADKAR Advantage. This new book casts a spotlight on the ADKAR Models powerful simplicity, offering rich guidance and practical resources for facilitating change. With ADKAR as your new lens, you can achieve the outcomes you seek from change and sustain them over time.\n\nThe book provides a thorough exploration of the model, shares first-hand ADKAR stories, and provides helpful resources grounded in Prosci’s benchmarking research.\n\nUse this book to:\n\nAdopt a new mindset around change.\n\nUncover the essential actions that will guide, shape, and encourage sustainable change\n\nCreate a better experience through change with improved outcomes for you and for others. That’s The ADKAR Advantage!"
