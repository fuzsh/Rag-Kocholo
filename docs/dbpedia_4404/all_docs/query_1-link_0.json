        "text": "Looking for some LLC examples from popular companies? We've compiled a list of some notable US companies that originally formed as an LLC. Check it out!\n\nAre you an aspiring entrepreneur who wants to start your own company? Perhaps you’re ready to transform your side hustle into a legitimate enterprise.\n\nA limited liability company (LLC) is a convenient business structure that allows business owners to grow their company without exposing them to personal debt or liability.\n\nThere are different types of LLC structures that best suit a business owner’s needs, and the most appropriate option for you will depend on a few details. Stay with us as we explore the different LLC types and real-life examples of their operation.\n\nBenefits of forming an LLC\n\nThere’s a reason so many businesses register as an LLC when starting (and growing) their company. The following benefits of forming an LLC shed much light on the strategic decision.\n\nSimplicity — forming an LLC is an easy process with limited paperwork\n\nControl over business decisions — depending on the management structure, LLC owners have complete control over business decisions\n\nLimited personal liability — the owner is separated from the business, and their assets are protected\n\nTax advantages — as a “pass-through” entity, incomes pass through the business to the owners for income tax purposes to avoid double taxation\n\nProfit-sharing flexibility — LLC operating agreements and profit-sharing plans are determined by the owners\n\nCredibility — LLCs are viewed as established companies and have more credibility with customers and vendors\n\nWhat are the different types of LLCs?\n\nThe concept of an LLC suggests that the business structure goes beyond “sole-proprietorship and partnership associations” to protect the business owner and their assets.\n\nDifferent types of LLCs exist, and they are suitable in varied instances. Despite their nuanced differences, the IRS recognizes an LLC as a pass-through entity for tax benefits — while providing liability protection.\n\nSingle-member LLC — single owner without any legal partners\n\nGeneral partnership — forming an LLC with multiple members\n\nMulti-member LLC – two or more partners with a percentage share based on their investment\n\nManager-managed LLC — members select a manager (either internal or third-party external)\n\nMember-managed LLC — members manage the LLC themselves\n\nSeries LLC — an umbrella or parent LLC has several smaller LLCs within its control\n\nL3C (low-profit LLC) — for-profit institutions with a philanthropic purpose\n\nFamily limited partnerships — similar to limited partnerships, with family members as owners\n\nAnonymous LLC — LLC legal structure that withholds the identity of owners, managers, and members\n\nRestricted LLC — only available in Nevada, restricted LLC offers lower tax rates when transferring assets to family members\n\nPLLC — a professional limited liability company for licensed occupations such as medicine and law\n\nTax rates and local business laws are impacted by the state where the business is formed. Businesses can also choose to register their business as a foreign or a domestic LLC. A domestic LLC is formed within its home state, while a foreign LLC is a legal entity that performs business outside of its home jurisdiction or state.\n\n7 well-known companies that started as LLCs\n\nAn LLC is one of the most popular business entities in the United States, with various iconic businesses blazing the trail of success. Consider the following LLC names from successful US companies that have chosen to structure their organization as an LLC.\n\n1. Google LLC\n\nGoogle LLC was initially founded in 1998 by Sergey Brin and Larry Page and is a subsidiary of the holding company Alphabet Inc.\n\nToday, the global search giant has expanded its offerings to include various services in search, advertising, and operating systems. As the world’s most popular search engine, Google helps guide people on where to get a haircut, helps people buy flights, and provides recipes for chicken curry — and much more!\n\nSince its inception as an LLC, Google has expanded its portfolio to include the following products and services:\n\nGoogle Search\n\nGoogle Chrome\n\nGoogle Docs\n\nGoogle Calendar\n\nGoogle Photos\n\nGoogle Meet\n\nGoogle Drive\n\nGoogle Ad Manager\n\nGoogle Play Books\n\nGoogle Maps\n\nAlthough headquartered in California and the United States, Google has a powerful presence worldwide, from Europe and Africa to the Middle East and Asia-Pacific. As a multi-national technology company, Google specializes in online advertising technologies, search engines, cloud computing, and software.\n\nGoogle had humble beginnings but has grown in popularity and influence. Alphabet, Google’s parent company, holds a $1.7 trillion market cap and has used Google’s success to acquire more prominent companies — such as YouTube, Nest, and Waze.\n\n2. June\n\nJune is an actionable product analysis tool for B2B SaaS companies. The LLC was formed with doola and has continued to grow from strength to strength.\n\nIt’s no secret that the number of SaaS companies is rising, and competition to succeed is getting more intense. Keeping a close eye on data and analytics helps B2B SaaS companies stay ahead of the competition — and June helps these brands activate signups, retain a user base, and protect data.\n\nWhile Enzo Avigo, founder of June, has software expertise, he needed help to structure the formation of his company. That’s where doola came in to save the day.\n\nEnzo explains his decision to form the LLC with doola, saying, “We wanted a little bit of support… No way we’d get instant feedback from [alternative] if something goes wrong… We wanted hands-on support… We started to look for ideal solutions and didn’t see any, the closest thing we found were some very expensive lawyers.”\n\nJune’s team was based in France and planned to operate in the United States to meet their target audience needs. As international business owners, June required a little bit more support and guidance in forming their LLC, and doola could offer hands-on support for processes through the start-pack service.\n\nContact us today if you are a non-US resident wanting to open an LLC in the United States.\n\n3. Blockbuster LLC\n\nFormerly known as Blockbuster Video, Blockbuster LLC was an American-based movie and video game rental service provider.\n\nFounded in 1985, Blockbuster LLC disrupted the video rental game by expanding rapidly. They became an entertainment giant during a time when most video stores were small-scale operations. By forming an LLC, the founder’s liabilities were limited, which was a positive move considering how the entertainment landscape shifted in the following years.\n\nIn 1994, Blockbuster was acquired by Viacom Inc., joining brands such as MTV and Nickelodeon. In the following years, DVDs took the world by storm, and Blockbuster adapted by renting films on DVD.\n\nHowever, entertainment formats continued to evolve, and eventually, online streaming made video rentals obsolete. By 2014, the last of the company-owned stores had closed, and the only Blockbuster that exists today is an independent branch in Bend, Oregon. As an enterprise, Blockbuster LLC has become a subsidiary of Dish Network.\n\nToday, Blockbuster’s reputation is a nostalgic enterprise providing endless entertainment hours. Forming as an LLC allowed the movie rental business to grow and expand the number of franchises nationwide while reducing the owner’s risk.\n\n4. Ranked\n\nRanked is a modern SEO company helping big and small businesses achieve desired SEO results. The LLC was formed with doola, offering quick and straightforward U.S. business formation services.\n\nWith so many businesses investing in an online presence, a streamlined SEO strategy is essential to rank on Google search results. Rather than waste time (and money) on expensive, spam-motivated SEO solutions, Ranked offers transparent and affordable SEO services to help businesses boost their brand organically.\n\nRanked offers a range of relevant and effective services. For example, the company offers informative and engaging blog content, top-to-bottom on-page optimization, and high-quality backlinks gained from custom outreach rather than spam networks. Ranked also offers Google My Business services, helping to optimize local business listings.\n\nAs an SEO agency, Ranked has helped over 2,000 clients, including small startups and established Fortune 500 companies. The LLC also boasts over 60,000 active ranking keywords and has over 250 agencies using its White Label solution.\n\nRanked founders operate confidently, knowing they have complete control over the business, benefit from tax benefits, and have limited personal liability.\n\n5. IBM Credit LLC\n\nIBM Credit LLC is a subsidiary of IBM that provides financial services, including asset management strategies. IBM Credit serves clients worldwide and is registered as an LLC.\n\nIBM Credit LLC is the vessel for IBM Financing, which leases money and offers financial services to clients in the United States and beyond. Operating in the consumer lending industry, IBM Credit LLC was incorporated in 1981 in Delaware as IBM Credit Corporation. Subsequently, it became a limited liability company and was renamed IBM Credit LLC in 2003.\n\nSince then, it has endured as an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of IBM. IBM GF International Holdings LLC owns all of the LLC interests.\n\nAs a lending company, IBM Credit must be cautious in protecting its owners and founders, ensuring that their assets are not at risk. As an LLC, the member owns the company interests, and the company has no other class of equity securities issued and outstanding.\n\n6. RAIZE Bakery\n\nRAIZE bakery is an innovative bakery that has reinvented the traditional cookie to meet modern demands. Operating as an LLC, RAIZE Bakery used doola to form its business easily and efficiently.\n\nWhen your skills lie in blending ingredients and tickling tastebuds, you may have a different passion for administration and legal filings. Not to mention, there are many different paths to consider when choosing how to form your company.\n\nZach Ranen, Founder of RAIZE, was ready to take the first legal steps in making his entrepreneurial dream a reality, but he needed a trustworthy partner to guide him through the process.\n\nZach says, “The things that you probably think less about wanting to do are making legal filings or registering your company. Having someone like doola take care of that saves you time and allows you to focus on the higher value pieces that can drive your business going forward.”\n\ndoola connected with Zach and walked him through the different options for his business, ultimately deciding to register the LLC in Delaware and qualify for the LLC in New York state. Within a couple of days, all of Zach’s information was submitted to the state, and a week later, he received confirmation of business formation.\n\n7.
