        "text": "Some companies become household names, but a high profile is no guarantee of longevity. Brands that experience huge initial success, such as Toys R Us, Sunny Delight and Club 18-30, have each suffered falls from grace every bit as spectacular as their meteoric rise.\n\nIn the latest series of BBC Radio 4's Toast, host Sean Farrington and self-made millionaire and serial entrepreneur Sam White discuss more brands that hit hard times and speak to a range of experts to find out why even once-popular business behemoths can fail.\n\nHere are five big business ideas that started strongly but eventually went awry and the main reasons why they ended up as toast.\n\nSunny Delight\n\nMade largely with water, 10% sugar, various additives and 5% juice, Sunny Delight launched in the UK in 1998. Within 12 months it had reached sales of £160 million and was the UK's third best-selling soft drink behind the giants of Coca Cola and Pepsi.\n\nThe Sunny Delight juice juggernaut was halted in 1999 when news broke of a toddler whose skin had turned yellow after drinking an excessive amount.\n\nDespite the high sugar content, its place in the chiller cabinet with fresh fruit juices and milk and its added vitamin content initially made busy parents feel good about buying Sunny Delight for their kids.\n\nThis juice juggernaut was, however, halted by a very unhappy Christmas in 1999 when news broke of a toddler whose skin had turned yellow after drinking an excessive amount. The reaction was down to the ingredient beta carotene (Vitamin A). Despite not being harmful long-term, alarm was raised. Then an unfortunate coincidence raised the stakes even higher – Sunny Delight's Christmas TV advert that year showed snowmen turning yellow after drinking it!\n\nThis double-whammy, coupled with growing concerns about the sugar content, saw sales plummet to £38 million in 2003. A year later, Sunny Delight's makers Proctor & Gamble sold the business. The drink is still available in some UK supermarkets but has a different recipe and is nowhere near as popular as it was in the late 1990s.\n\nFor Sam, the demise of Sunny Delight was down to the company not making sure that their customers “are purchasing what they think that they're purchasing.” Sam also believes that Sunny Delight was “the scapegoat for parental guilt and shame” over what they provided for their kids.\n\nHear more about why the juice ran out for Sunny Delight and what lessons were learned by listening to the episode in full on BBC Sounds.\n\nBritish holiday-makers enjoying a Club 18-30 pool party in Ibiza in 2001.\n\nClub 18-30\n\nSun, sea and partying was the holy trinity for the iconic holiday company Club 18-30. The venture started out in the mid 1960s as a way to fill up empty seats on night flights, attracting young singles and couples without kids. Flourishing despite two changes of ownership in the 1970s and 1980s, Club 18-30 became the byword for cheap and cheerful youth holidays.\n\nEntertainment – from sangria and singing competitions onwards – was one of the main ways Club 18-30 made its money.\n\nTheir market share was relatively small, but they had a better rep to guest ratio than their competitors, and entertainment – from sangria and singing competitions onwards – was one of the main ways the company made its money.\n\n“Deliberately cheesy and not trendy,” as rep-turned-exec Andy Tidy puts it, Club 18-30 enjoyed exposure – for better or for worse – through its suggestive adverts and, in the 2000s, a reality show and a documentary.\n\nThe firm didn't get chance to pivot to the experiential holiday needs of Insta-led millennials, as Thomas Cook, who bought it in 1998, started Cook's Trips for this. This venture was sold off separately when Thomas Cook closed in 2019, less than two years after they closed Club 18-30.\n\n“You have to deliver what people want,” says Sam “but Thomas Cook kind of left it [Club 18-30] in the corner, so I think it would have been killed off no matter what.”\n\nFind out more about why the sun set on Club 18-30 despite its best efforts by listening to the episode in full.\n\nCommodore Computers\n\nThe iconic Commodore 64 personal computer burst onto the market in 1982. It was sold on the strength of exciting videogame adaptations of big-name Hollywood blockbusters like Top Gun and Rambo and was lapped up by the younger generation.\n\nFounder Jack Tramiel, who had started out selling typewriters and then calculators, actually left the business in 1984. An earlier deal he did with financier Irving Gould meant Gould was left in charge of the company. There were lax financial controls and “no external auditing” of accounts, according to David Pleasance, a former Commodore international executive and later joint managing director of its UK subsidiary.\n\nCommodore's fortunes were made harder by its failure to keep pace with the development of Windows software. Meanwhile, an attempt to update its Amiga PC range ended up undermining the previous model and proved more costly than anticipated.\n\nJamie Oliver pictured in 2008.\n\nCommodore declared voluntary bankruptcy and liquidation in 1994.\n\nFor Sam, the lack of financial direction was key to its demise. “Businesses, no matter how big they are, have to be able to know exactly how much money is coming in and how much money's going out,” she says.\n\nTo find out more about why Commodore had to press Ctrl-Alt-Delete, listen to the episode on BBC Sounds.\n\nJamie's Italian\n\nAn instant hit when it opened in Oxford in 2008, Jamie's Italian aimed to disrupt mid-market dining in the UK with “great value and much higher quality ingredients and best in class animal welfare standards”.\n\nThe business recipe whipped up by talismanic celebrity chef Jamie Oliver really caught the public's imagination, with more than 40 restaurants opening up in seven years.\n\nBy 2016 things had turned sour because of massive expansion by competitors, the scramble for sites driving up rents. Two years later Jamie's Italian entered into a CVA, a Company Voluntary Arrangement, to pay creditors.\n\nTwelve restaurants closed, and, a year later, the company collapsed into administration.\n\n“I didn't have any levers left to pull,” Jamie told Kirsty Young in an episode of her BBC Radio 4 series Young Again last year: “I wasn't going to pull the lever of poor quality produce. I'd die before that happens.”\n\nSam feels that customers were only prepared to go so far to match Jamie's enthusiasm and “did not care enough about the things that he cared about to bridge the gap when the market was under pressure.”\n\nFind out more about why Jamie's Italian felt the heat and the efforts to keep it afloat by listening to the full episode.\n\nA Toys R Us store in Brent Cross, London, in 2003.\n\nToys R Us\n\nToys R Us launched in the US in 1957, complete with backwards R (to make it look like a child had written it) and later with a mascot, Geoffrey the Giraffe. The stores, which peaked at just under 2,000 outlets worldwide, were big and brash but still maintained an air of innocent wonder.\n\nThe Toys R Us logo came complete with a backwards R, to make it look like a child had written it.\n\nThough the business pivoted to selling online in the 1990s, the competition from Amazon and others was, as Simon Cartey from the company admits to Sean, “severe”. The nature of business was further changed in 2005 when three investment companies bought it by leveraging the debt.\n\nBy 2018 all its UK stores had closed. Though the brand is coming back on a franchise basis and through concession stores in the US and UK, the experience is very different.\n\nFor Sam, the diagnosis of failure is clear – “bad capital”.\n\n“They got the wrong backers,” she says, “and that destroyed the flow of energy and probably destroyed the team dynamic for a period of time.”\n\nTo find out more about the ups and downs of Toys R Us, and to hear what lessons can be learned from its story, listen to the full episode.\n\nAnd to hear about more stories of business calamity, listen to the latest series of Toast on BBC Sounds now.\n\nThe information contained in this article was correct at the time of broadcast on 11 January, 2024.\n\nFailed inventions that changed the world\n\nBBC Ideas tells the stories of four amazing innovations that had rather inauspicious beginnings.\n\nFailed inventions that changed the world\n\nMore articles from BBC Radio 4\n\nFive more business ideas that went wrong\n\nThe stories behind other businesses that failed from the first series of Toast.\n\nFive more business ideas that went wrong\n\nSeven things we learned when Jamie Oliver spoke to Kirsty Young\n\nHighlights from the TV chef's revealing Young Again chat.\n\nSeven things we learned when Jamie Oliver spoke to Kirsty Young\n\nIs vaping harmful to your health?\n\nSliced Bread looks at the dangers of the habit that's exploded in popularity.\n\nIs vaping harmful to your health?\n\nAre these 'must-have' gadgets worth buying?\n\nGreg Foot has the lowdown on air fryers, massage guns and other wonder products.\n\nAre these 'must-have' gadgets worth buying?"
