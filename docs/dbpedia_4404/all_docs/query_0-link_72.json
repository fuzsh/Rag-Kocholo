        "text": "Unveiling the journey from academic expertise to entrepreneurial ventures: a deep dive into the unique roles and contributions of scholars in the startup ecosystem\n\nWith all the hoopla we’ve been seeing around startup-incubated technology innovation in the last few years, it’s no wonder that I am increasingly asked about my experience as a startup founder. Even though there are telling admissions of the challenges of a startup — e.g., NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang’s recent soliloquy — the attraction, or perhaps the potential, of a startup keeps finding newcomers ready for the leap. Given my experiences as an academic who started a VC-backed tech startup, Voxel51, and have worked as an operator in it for multiple years leading it as CEO through seed and series A rounds, I thought I’d share some observations.\n\nThe abstractness of the day-to-day in the ivory tower may ultimately be what pushes many faculty to try out a startup.\n\nWhy do academics start companies?\n\nBeing an academic is a dream job. You get to challenge yourself and your peers on the frontier of knowledge and understanding. You build a serious international and lifelong community of colleagues, of friends. You mentor the next generation of scholars and teach the next-next-generation. It’s amazing. It’s hard work. But, it’s amazing.\n\nYet, faculty start companies. And they do it frequently. In fact, one study by Roche, Conti and Rothaermal in the Journal of Research Policy noted 30% of startups in their cohort were founded by at least one professor.\n\nWhy? I think it is a combination of interest in making a bigger impact, ambition, and probably the potential for riches. Perhaps these elements are not unique to faculty members; considering these carrots and the work behind them — cutting-edge innovation, mostly independent and autonomous work, passion, etc. — are common to most startup founders, but I think there is also a draw toward the tangible. The abstractness of the day-to-day in the ivory tower may ultimately be what pushes many faculty to try out a startup. Furthermore, given the work a faculty member has already done, I think there is a gross underestimate of the new work required to build a successful startup, which enables the faculty member to misestimate the risk versus reward.\n\nExploring the three distinct startup models championed by academic founders\n\nConsulting startups\n\nAcademics are especially in-tune with providing high-level topical advice on their expertise. In the end, they teach it; they do scholarly work on it; they write about it. This type of startup has the academic doing mostly the same type of work they do in their “day-job.”\n\nIf the project is more tangible, then the typical output for this type of work is at best a minimally functional prototype. Even more common is a report of some form. This is bread-and-butter work for the typical academic.\n\nHence, these consulting startups are super popular. They generally help offset the abysmal salaries that faculty get paid relative to their non-academic-and-still-researching peers at top tech firms. In fact, they play a key role in the US federal research enterprise to the point that there are grant programs almost specifically designed for this type of academic-backed startup. These programs, called Small Business Innovation Research or SBIRs, are offered by many federal funding agencies, like the National Science Foundation, Department of Defense, and National Institutes of Health. It’s pretty difficult to get these grants without at least one reputable academic on the team in some form or another (and even with them, it is still difficult).\n\nOperator startups\n\nOperators drive the startup. They set the agenda. They do the work, often myriad types of work in a single day. They must be able to set the North Star, render it to strategy, manage it in tactics, and stick to them all while instilling passion in their team to do the same.\n\nThe operator literally needs to be willing and able to step into most roles in the company at any point (at least in the 0-to-1 phase).\n\nTo an academic, this may seem like running a lab, status quo. But, in reality it’s completely different. Assuming we’re talking about VC-backed startups here, there really are two key novelties. First, there are your investors. These are your partners. Your mentors. They have the experience where you don’t, at least if they are past operators. You need to find the best ones: those who are willing to trust you to do what you say you will do while challenging you at every key decision point. Investors are exceptionally different from program managers. Program managers win primarily when you produce output on what the proposal was independent of whether the work continues to actually be needed (that’s research after all); investors win when you adapt to the evolving landscape of the market and produce something actually valuable.\n\nSecond, it’s all about product-market fit. As an academic, you have a strong sense of your product-market fit: what type of research you do, how you distribute it, how your peers interact with it and so on. The value is directly in the work. Furthermore, if you choose to work on a new problem — i.e., broaden or change your research portfolio — you are taking a risk. If unsuccessful, it is mostly only opportunity cost. Your lab does not wind down. You do not lay off employees who joined you in your vision. You do not go looking for a new gig.\n\nInstead, as an operator at a VC-backed startup, you may have some ideas about your future product-market fit based on your understanding of the market or early prototypes. However, this understanding is going to be impacted by new data on a super-daily basis. If you are stubborn and flat-footed, you likely will fail. Things change rapidly. Adapting to new data as you find product-market fit is something that academic life just does not see too much, and, if it does, its time scale is quite different.\n\nAs an operator myself, I can say this is both invigorating and exhausting. These two key challenges are very difficult. And, they are rewarding when you solve them. It doesn’t stop there. Once you have some notion of product-market fit, you need to plan a go-to-market strategy and take on new roles; usually at this point, it is with the help of more lieutenants.\n\nThere is also a third element here that greatly differentiates the academic and the operator. The operator literally needs to be willing and able to step into most roles in the company at any point (at least in the 0-to-1 phase). At the university, no one expects a faculty member, for example, to go work on the grant submission team at the office of sponsored projects. At the startup, yes. Furthermore, the operator needs to have a constant eye on the structure and evolution of their rapidly changing and hopefully growing team, which is different from running a lab of students and postdocs who all have their own futures riding on their roles in the experience in a different way than a startup.\n\nAdvisor startups\n\nThis is a curious one and likely more common than you think. These may be one of the other two types, but the key distinguishing factor is the role the academic plays. In other words, the academic is a founder of the company mostly in name only and the occasional “what do you think about this” angle. I was once told by a faculty colleague that they had started six companies. I was floored. Six companies. Wow. And you’re still standing, I said. Then I realized. Oh wait, he wasn’t actually doing much in the company. Just advising. That’s different. I’m all for innovation, but this one isn’t really an academic founder. Yes, I’m calling you out here.\n\nThe fact that you are an academic is mostly irrelevant to your value as an operator\n\nIt’s true. Academics work hard. Jump through many hoops. Generally build a strong sense of accomplishment. It’s good and all, but…\n\nAlthough they may help get a foot in the door here and there, those hoops are largely irrelevant to life as an operator. Instead, there seems to be a need for a general willingness to roll up your sleeves on just about any aspect of the company — hiring, marketing, development, sales, fundraising, etc. — on a regular basis. And this is not putting out fires. This is core life in a startup. An adaptability to solve the immediate problems at hand while understanding the bigger picture to weigh choices concurrently. It’s exciting. So, I’d exercise caution if you’re considering a startup with an academic background, especially as an operator. You can dip your toes into the water, but watch out because the tide will pull you in.\n\nThere is a lot more one can say about starting a company as an academic. The exit strategy is something that an academic is not trained on beforehand. However, I think it is important to make a decision as early as possible: seek to develop a technology that is attractive for an acquisition within the first two years, perhaps even pre-VC. Or, seek to build a business and commit in the long run. There is no middle road here. One or the other.\n\nClosing\n\nThese reflections are not recommendations of any kind. This interlude sought to lay out a minimalistic taxonomy of the types of startups I have either been a part of or have learned about, from an academic seat. I’ve learned a huge amount as an operator in a VC-backed tech startup. Most of the learnings, however, are quite distinct from those I needed for academia. Even fundraising: I mean, it is one thing to pitch a 10-year-out idea to a DARPA program manager based on perceived utility and technical innovation potential — which I have done many times — and a whole different beast to pitch a functional go-to-market strategy to a fishbowl of past operators who all know that people don’t spend any money on something unless they actually need it (most of the time!).\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nI want to thank my colleagues who helped iterate on early versions of this article, especially Jacob Marks, Ph.D. and Dave Mekelburg.\n\nBiography\n\nJason Corso is Professor of Robotics, Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the University of Michigan and Co-Founder / Chief Science Officer of the AI startup Voxel51.
