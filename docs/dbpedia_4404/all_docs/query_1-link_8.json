        "text": "It may seem that all the existing industries in the market are well-researched and limited. Lots of companies struggle for their share, whereas the competition is fierce.Â\n\nOne of the solutions for leaving this loop is to migrate to a \"blue ocean.\" This term refers to a previously undiscovered (or poorly covered) market with low competition or obstacles. Youâll need a comprehensive blue ocean strategy to succeed with this approach.\n\nHere in Arounda, a leading Ukrainian Product Design Agency, we offer top-notch expertise for startups and companies from the Fortune 500 list. We aim to build magnificent products that hit the markets with a long-lasting wow effect.\n\nIn this article, weâve summed up our five-year experience in product design and development. Read further about the blue ocean strategy examples and practices to implement in your business\n\nWhat is the Blue Ocean?\n\nThis concept originated in 2006 from the Blue Ocean Strategy book by W. Chan Kim and RenÃ©e Mauborgne. According to the authors, the blue ocean symbolizes a market without competitors, whereas the red ocean is overcrowded and limited. Think of competitors as sharks. Thatâs why the red ocean is redâitâs full of blood because of the intense competition.Â\n\nItâs all about a zero-sum game in the red ocean. The gain of one company means the loss of another. In the red ocean, companies sell comparable goods and commonly compete with pricing. On the contrary, blue ocean enterprises generate extra demand.Â\n\nMoreover, other advantages of blue ocean strategy include:\n\nBlue oceans provide users with a new, previously unrealized value\n\nBlue oceans imply little or no competition\n\nBlue oceans allow enterpreneurs to become a pioneer in a new market or field.\n\nIf you pursue the blue ocean, the question is not to eliminate all competitors but to carve out a new market niche with no competitors.\n\nTips On Applying the Blue Ocean Strategy\n\nThe nuclear execution principle in blue ocean strategy focuses on applying the iconic Eliminate-Reduce-Raise-Create (ERRC) framework.Â\n\nThe ERRC framework helps companies keep in focus two sides of a new blue ocean: eliminating and reducing and raising and creating.Â\n\nRead further some tips and tricks for robust blue ocean strategy development.\n\nAnalyze Industries\n\nTo find a new trend or demand, you should first do a thorough examination of the market. Analyze the product and the pains of the customers. Check if clients are happy with the existing services.\n\nDefine a Problem\n\nInstead of fighting for the existing options, aim to solve other customer problems. As soon as you discover something that isn't as wonderful as it could be, consider how to ease this consumer's pains with your offer. Think about not what your rivals have done wrong but how you can make your customers' lives easier.\n\nFollow the ERRC framework\n\nThe main work is to develop a plan comprising four main concepts. Answering these questions will be the basis for the action plan.\n\nEliminate. Which factors that the industry has long completed should be eliminated?\n\nRaise. Which aspects ought to be elevated significantly over the norms for the sector?\n\nReduce. Which factors should be mitigated well below the industry's standard?\n\nCreate. Which factors should be created that the industry has never offered?\n\nImplement\n\nOnce you have a blue ocean strategy summary, It's time to implement it. Kim and Mauborgne advise the following steps:\n\nEstablish a launch date for your new products, and hire personnel to develop your team and brand identity.\n\nIdentify the strengths and shortcomings of your current team and work to strengthen them.\n\nDetermine any potential pain areas for your existing and potential new clients.\n\nCreate goods and services that address these problems in ways that no other company has ever thought of.\n\nMake a formal shift plan in writing and test your new goods and services (as well as the steps you'll need to get there).\n\nYou are ready to enter a new market when you've covered the scheme above. Nevertheless, a blue ocean strategy is not a holy grail but will lead to success in skilled hands.\n\n10 Examples of Blue Ocean Strategy\n\nEven considering that every company is unique, there is always something in common with why they succeed. We described these renowned brands' blue ocean strategy business examples to show the advantages and disadvantages of blue ocean strategy offer.\n\nCirque du Soleil\n\nUnquestionably, Cirque du Soleil is one of the most well-known cases of the blue ocean strategy. Cirque du Soleil revolutionized the circus industry by aiming at low cost and differentiation.
