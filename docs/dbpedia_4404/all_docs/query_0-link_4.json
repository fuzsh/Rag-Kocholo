        "text": "1982-1999: The early years\n\nIt all started in 1982. In a small jeweller’s shop in modest surroundings in Copenhagen, Denmark, Danish goldsmith Per Enevoldsen and his wife Winnie began the journey of what would one day become Pandora.\n\nFrom the beginning, they often travelled to Thailand in search of jewellery for importing. As the demand for their products increased, their focus gradually shifted towards wholesale to clients in Denmark.\n\nIn 1987, after several successful years as wholesalers, the retail activities were discontinued and the company moved to larger premises. Meanwhile, the first in-house designer joined the company and Pandora began to focus on creating its own unique jewellery. In 1989, the company decided to start manufacturing its jewellery in Thailand.\n\n2000-2011: Building an international presence\n\nIn 2000, Pandora’s charm bracelet concept was first launched in the Danish market. Consumers embraced the concept, and in the following years, driven by growing demand, the company began to expand internationally, entering new markets such as the United States in 2003 – today the company’s largest market – and Germany and Australia in 2004.\n\nOver the following years, Pandora rapidly expanded its market presence from a Scandinavian platform to an international marketing and sales platform driven mainly by third party distributors and strong production capabilities in Thailand.\n\nIn 2005, Pandora opened a large scale crafting facility in Gemopolis, a jewellery industry zone outside Bangkok. Since then, we have expanded our operations, most recently in 2017 where we opened a crafting facility in Lamphun near Chiang Mai in Northern Thailand and in 2018 when we opened the Triple A facility in Gemopolis.\n\nIn 2008, Axcel acquired 60% of Pandora, and two years later, in 2010, Pandora was listed on the NASDAQ OMX Copenhagen Stock Exchange."
