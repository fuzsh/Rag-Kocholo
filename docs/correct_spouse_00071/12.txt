Who is Alki David?

Alkiviades David, known as Alki David, is a man of many hats. Born on May 23, 1968, in Lagos, Nigeria, Alki hails from a trading and shipping family of Greek-Cypriot descent. He probably had a globe instead of a teddy bear as a kid, considering how much he traveled. From a Coca-Cola bottling empire run by his family to a diverse career in business and entertainment, Alki has quite the resume.

Alki David’s Acting Career

While many know him as a businessman, Alki David also dipped his toes into the world of acting. It all started in 2004 with the British film The Freediver, which he wrote directed and starred in. The man doesn’t believe in half-measures. He went on to appear in films like Opa! and Flight of Fury, and he even managed to squeeze in some TV time with appearances in The Grid and Spooks. If you think juggling a business empire and an acting career is tough, wait till you hear about his other ventures.

Alki David’s Net Worth

Alki David’s net worth is currently estimated to be around $50 million. But hold on to your hats because this figure has been quite the rollercoaster. At one point, he was flaunted as a billionaire with a net worth of $4 billion (which would be over $10 billion today) according to The Sunday Times in 2007. But Alki, being the showman he is, later admitted that his billionaire status was more fiction than fact, crafted with the help of a PR stunt. This little embellishment led many to believe he was rolling in cash, even planning to buy an English soccer team. Fast forward to 2021, Alki revealed he was flat-out broke, dealing with $80 million in legal judgments. Talk about a plot twist!

Alki David Age

If life were a race, Alki would be the guy who’s simultaneously running, juggling, and occasionally tripping over his own feet, but always getting back up with flair. Born under the Gemini sign, it’s no wonder he’s got a bit of a dual nature, balancing business acumen with a flair for the dramatic.
