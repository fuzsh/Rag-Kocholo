        "text": "Alkiviades ‘Alki’ David is a Greek billionaire heir who is a member of the Leventis family. Although he has a Greek-Cypriot heritage, David was born in Lagos in Nigeria, in May 1968. His family holdings include bottling plants, manufacturing companies, shipping, and properties. One of the major elements of the business is the 28 bottling plants for Coca-Cola Hellenic. David is currently the major shareholder of the Leventis-David Group. Despite being an heir to a large company and a huge fortune, Alki David is an entrepreneur who also owns many other companies. These include Independent Models modeling agency, BattleCam.com video-streaming site, a home shopping service, a theater on Hollywood Boulevard, and a video-on-demand site and mobile service. Furthermore, he has earned money as an actor and film producer. According to The Richest, Alki David’s net worth is around $1.9 billion.\n\nIn his personal life, Alki David has been married three times. He has two sons, Andrew and Alexander, from his first marriage. He met his second wife, Emma McAllister, in 2004. The couple married in 2007 but separated two years later. Now, the billionaire is married to a swimsuit designer and former model, Jennifer Stano. They married in 2011 and live together in Beverley Hills. Following a series of lawsuits against him that have racked up $60 million in money owed to the courts, the billionaire is now selling his beachfront Malibu home. The asking price for his luxurious pad is on the market for $28.5 million.\n\nAn Overview of the Beachfront Malibu Property\n\nAccording to Dirt.com, Alki David owns various properties in different locations around the world. These include properties in London and Greece. In 2017, Alki David sold his Mediterranean-style mansion in Beverley Hills for $20.4 million, although he had only paid $16.5 million for the property in 2010. He then bought his beachfront Malibu home for $19.1 million. He purchased the property from heiress Elizabeth Luster, cosmetics pioneer Max Factors granddaughter. The significant increase in the value of the house is justified, as he made significant renovations, improvements, and modernizations to the property. The house was built in 1974, and it sits on a plot of 0.24-acres. It measures 4,200-square-feet internally and boasts four bedrooms and 4.5-bathrooms.\n\nInside Alki David’s Pad\n\nOne half of the foyer has a single-height ceiling, while the other half has a double-height ceiling with a skylight. Below the skylight, there is a curved wooden staircase leading to the second story, which has wood-paneled walls. The ground floor of the Malibu beach house is open plan, with the kitchen leading through to the dining area that is currently used as a sitting room and then through to the lounge at the back of the house. Wood flooring runs throughout the lower story of the property. There is fitted white cabinetry to one side of the kitchen, which is also where the built-in oven and the sink are located. A second wall has further cabinetry and a fridge freezer. There is a huge island in the center of the room, and this also has white cabinetry, the hob, a second sink, and onyx countertops. To one side of the kitchen is a light wood-beamed ceiling, while the other side has a skylight running the length of the room. There is also backlighting and spotlights to light the kitchen in the evenings.\n\nCurrently, the dining area that connects to the kitchen is used as an informal sitting room, and the room is well-lit thanks to the skylights running along either side of the wood-paneled ceiling. It has wood paneling as a feature on one wall and a window and white cabinetry on the opposite wall. Wooden steps lead down from the dining room into the lounge, which also has wooden paneling on the walls. There is brightly colored, contemporary artwork on the walls of this cozy room. Sliding glass doors lead from the lounge to the outdoor decking area. Between the main house and the guest house, there are four bedrooms and 4.5-bathrooms. One of the best features of the master suite is the private deck, which is accessed via frameless sliding glass doors. The private deck has glass walls, so the beach and Pacific Ocean views are uninterrupted, and it is the ideal spot for sitting and watching the sunset. Another impressive feature of the master suite is the ensuite bathroom, which has a tiled floor, gold-toned fixtures, a rose-colored quartz vanity, a double shower, white cabinetry, and a gold-mosaic claw-footed bathtub.\n\nThe Grounds of the Property\n\nThe grounds of Alki David’s house are fairly small, at just 0.24-acres. However, its beachfront position more than makes up for the lack of gardens, as there is direct access to the beach. Therefore, not only can the new homeowner enjoy Pacific Ocean views, but they can also step out of their house and straight onto the golden sands of Malibu Beach or go for a paddle in the water. At the front of the main house are a garage and guest house. Between this structure and the main house is a paved courtyard that has an unusual water feature. Running along one side of the garden are wooden plant boxes with shrubs, while the other side of the garden has concrete plant boxes. There is a garage and guest house at the end of the courtyard. Beyond the guest house is a further decked area set up for outdoor entertainment. The decking leads all the way from the rear of the property to the beach, so the new homeowner can enjoy sitting in the sunshine while enjoying the beach and ocean views. Steps lead down from the decking directly onto the sand. David commissioned street artist Alec Monopoly to create some unique pieces of art for the decking area, so there is graffiti-style art on the walls, and some brightly colored sculptures, so there is an element of fun to the outdoor space. One of the best external features of the house is a sunken spa area on the decking with wooden steps leading into the water."
