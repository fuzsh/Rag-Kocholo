Mike hung his violin-shaped bass strapped to the head of his amp during a break and someone got behind the amp and tipped it over, the amp head landing directly on the guitar. Mike seemed calm as he came out of the band's dressing room to find no damage to his axe. That was a defining moment. Mike was \"cool\" in my book.\n\nSaturday 11/24/2007 6:56:29pm\n\nName: Janey\n\nE-Mail: sweetbabyjane2006@yahoo.com\n\nThis Message is for: donnie/ thx for the Link/// awesome looking band you all have there.. thanks for sharing. smiles looks like yall be jammin........\n\nReferred By: Friend\n\nWhere Are You?

Mike was the nicest person I ever knew and I will always be grateful to him for the loving memories we share. We met on June 16, 1967 at Sunset West in Spokane where he performed with City Zu; that night he changed my life forever. Mike was a great bass player and absolutely loved playing his bass guitar. Unfortunately, it has been 12 years since he left us to be in a more loving and safe environment. I will miss him forever.

They passed thru Petersburg, Alaska, c. 1981?2? and I bought and listened to this record many times. I'll Be Seeing You has always been a fantastic tune. As a drumming veteran of many bands, and with the internet now at hand, I went looking for Bobbie Millage, simply curious as to her musical path. I am very saddened to learn of her passing and send my regrets to those who shared more closely in her life and musical gift. It's an amazing connection we have, as musicians, and, with so many nights gone by, one we perhaps don't even realize has occured. 25 years go by and somebody in California wonders what happened to that wonderful sax player that came to that remote rainy town to bring entertainment and joy... She left a mark on me and I'm sure many others\n\nTuesday 11/06/2007 10:54:36am\n\nName: Jeff Keith\n\nE-Mail: jeffkeith98133@yahoo.com\n\nThis Message is for: Bobby Speer and Jeff Santerra\n\nReferred By: Just Dumb Luck\n\nWhere Are You?

Bill passed away 2 years ago and I would like to get some memories, pictures or even recordings (should I be so lucky) to pass on to his daughters. He loved being a musician more than anything and hopefully he is playing his drums in heaven now..\n\nSunday 09/16/2007 7:53:36pm\n\nName: rob geary\n\nE-Mail: werdoner@Hotmail.com\n\nYour Homepage www.myspace.com/werdoner\n\nThis Message is for: jayson hoover\n\nReferred By: Just Dumb Luck\n\nWhere Are You? eastvan\n\nComments: gotta love seeing my fam in the lights!\n\nSunday 09/16/2007 0:49:32am\n\nName: Susie Motschenbacher/Corbett\n\nE-Mail: whiterocksusie@hotmail.com\n\nThis Message is for: Bill and Ron of \"The Wanderer's\",\n\nReferred By: E-Mail\n\nWhere Are You?

The picture with the triangles on the side is the bowling alley and was not the target ballroom. It was right next door. Pat O'Day held dances at the Spanish Castle on Pacific Hwy now know as International Blvd. I will submit the pictures I acquired from my Dad to be posted on this site as they are great reminders of the great talent that my grandparents were able to bring to Burien.

Something about that older B&W photo caught my interest with its scratches age marks and all. I read Roger's tribute and came away thinking pretty decent to have friends like that. I used hang around Long & McQuade in Vancouver as a teen drooling over all the fine instruments I couldn't afford. I'm in Kitimat now trying to organize an R&B band. Great story! If you send me a high Q photo file of the \"Gerry, Roger & Al\" photo I will restore it and send it back all cleaned up. I was invited to play bass last summer 2006 for a bluegrass band in Terrace and had the pleasure of exploring that music with a great bunch. One of them was banjo player extradinare named Jason Homey of Yale BC. I normally play blues and Rock but his playing certainly laid those boundary's to rest.\n\nregards, Donald.\n\nSunday 07/29/2007 10:28:52am\n\nName: Jenny Durke\n\nE-Mail: lady_jen56@hotmail.com\n\nReferred By: Search Engine\n\nWhere Are You?

The event sponsor and Ticketmaster did no one any justice by not supplying any concert information but the Name Wailers and the concert date then said get your tickets thry Ticketmaster. Funny thing Ticketmasted didn't have any group or event information either. We as I thought the group was you guys I bought the tickets and that's whom I wanted to see. None-the-less I can't get my money back and who wants to listen to Raggae? I just found out that is was the wrong groud last Saturday from Gregory Ann Ormsby Buck's daughter and I was steamed. They were going to go to the concert at Tulalip with us. These people suck and I would continue to take them to task for using your name and such. They even are using the same script on their logo? I want to see the orginal group in action so will continue to surf your website and find a gig that we can attend. Thenks for hangin' together!\n\nMonday 06/18/2007 8:03:32pm\n\nName: Joe Manlove\n\nE-Mail: jwm0425@earthlink.net\n\nReferred By: Search Engine\n\nWhere Are You? lost in kansas\n\nDid You Have A 1954-1979 NW Band?: No\n\nComments: in my previous comment I may not have made it clear what band I was working with.

Anacortes, WA\n\nDid You Have A 1954-1979 NW Band?: No\n\nComments: Looking for Jimmy Hanna and Donny Rizzo who played saxophone in Jimmy's Big Band. Was it Jimmy Hanna and the Dynamics? Used to go to dances during the mid-sixties when Jimmy Hanna and his band would play. Donny was a member of the band and we took music lessons together at Blackstone Music Studio in Seattle and were in a 1950's band called the Corvettes. Thinking about the Rizzo brothers and Jimmy Hanna - and Larry Evans in our band, the bass player, who we lost to a car accident after he played a gig in eastern Washington in 1966 - the music was so good and I want to know where Hanna and the Rizzo brothers are. I know Donny played with Jimmy Hanna as I last saw him at a dance in the big band. Ricky played trumpet in the Corvettes. It was at a Seattle Catholic Church dance where I last saw Donny. We used to attend all the time and my dad never knew how hot these dances were. Somebody, have you got any information on these guys? Donny would be 58 and Ricky 59. And where might be Jimmy Hanna?\n\nThank you,\n\nMargaret Grondal Delourme\n\nWednesday 05/30/2007 1:27:27am\n\nName: Mark Gage\n\nE-Mail: tinanmark@msn.com\n\nYour Homepage myspace.com/tuffenuff1\n\nReferred By: The Devil made me do it\n\nWhere Are You?
