        "text": "Who is Alki David?\n\nAlkiviades David, known as Alki David, is a man of many hats. Born on May 23, 1968, in Lagos, Nigeria, Alki hails from a trading and shipping family of Greek-Cypriot descent. He probably had a globe instead of a teddy bear as a kid, considering how much he traveled. From a Coca-Cola bottling empire run by his family to a diverse career in business and entertainment, Alki has quite the resume.\n\nAlki David’s Acting Career\n\nWhile many know him as a businessman, Alki David also dipped his toes into the world of acting. It all started in 2004 with the British film The Freediver, which he wrote directed and starred in. The man doesn’t believe in half-measures. He went on to appear in films like Opa! and Flight of Fury, and he even managed to squeeze in some TV time with appearances in The Grid and Spooks. If you think juggling a business empire and an acting career is tough, wait till you hear about his other ventures.\n\nAlki David’s Net Worth\n\nAlki David’s net worth is currently estimated to be around $50 million. But hold on to your hats because this figure has been quite the rollercoaster. At one point, he was flaunted as a billionaire with a net worth of $4 billion (which would be over $10 billion today) according to The Sunday Times in 2007. But Alki, being the showman he is, later admitted that his billionaire status was more fiction than fact, crafted with the help of a PR stunt. This little embellishment led many to believe he was rolling in cash, even planning to buy an English soccer team. Fast forward to 2021, Alki revealed he was flat-out broke, dealing with $80 million in legal judgments. Talk about a plot twist!\n\nAlki David Age\n\nAs of 2024, Alki David is 56 years old. If life were a race, Alki would be the guy who’s simultaneously running, juggling, and occasionally tripping over his own feet, but always getting back up with flair. Born under the Gemini sign, it’s no wonder he’s got a bit of a dual nature, balancing business acumen with a flair for the dramatic.\n\nAlki David Family: Wife and Children\n\nAlki David’s personal life is as eventful as his career. He has been married three times and has four children. From his first marriage, he has two sons, Andrew and Alexander. His second marriage to Emma McAllister lasted from 2007 to 2009, which in celebrity time is almost a decade. In 2011, he married his third wife, Jennifer Stano, a swimsuit designer and former model. Together, they have two sons, Niko and Constantine. If this sounds like a plot from a soap opera, you’re not alone in thinking that.\n\nAlki David Height and Weight\n\nAlki David stands at a respectable height of 5 feet 10 inches. As for his weight, it’s not exactly listed, but let’s just say he’s managed to carry the weight of multiple lawsuits and a few million dollars (at different times, of course) quite gracefully."
