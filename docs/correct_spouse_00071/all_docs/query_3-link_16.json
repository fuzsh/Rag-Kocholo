PREFACE. The volume herewith presented speaks for itself, and extended preface is unneces- sary. It is fitting, however, that special thanks be given here by the author of the historical portion of the work to those who have so kindly assisted, by information, suggestion, and encouragement, in its preparation. Among these may be named the committee of endorsement, Messrs. Frank Paine, Lewis McMorris, and W. S. Gilliam, to whose patient attention and invaluable corrections the author is especially indebted. Particular mention should be made of the assistance given by Prof. J. A. Keener, of Waitsburg Academy, in the elaborate account of that institution. Prof. O. A. Hauerbach, of Whitman College, should be credited with the author- ship of the greater part of chapter twenty-three, and Mr. W. M. Proctor with that of chapter twenty-two. Many citizens of Walla Walla have given important information and have evinced an interest in the work, and a spirit of local patriotism which is one of the best auguries for a noble future in the historic county of Walla Walla. To these and all the hearty thanks of both publisher and author are due and are hereby most cordially tendered. AN ENDORSEMENT.

The opening of a new century is a fitting time to cast a backward glance in our local history, reconstruct to the eye of the present the interesting and heroic events of the past, and by comparison between past and present forecast something of the future. Old Oregon Territory, of which this coun- ty and this state were once parts, with its isola- tion, its pathos, its hospitality, has passed away. It had a strange history. It was the ignis fatinis of successive generations of explorers, luring them on with that indescribable fascina- tion which seems always to have drawn men tc the ever-receding circle of the \"Westmost West,\" and yet for years and years veiling itself in the mists of uncertainty and misap- prehension. We do not usually realize how soon after the time of Columbus there began to be at- tempts to reach the western ocean and to solve the mystery of the various passages, north- west, southwest, and west, which were sup- posed to lead through the Americas to Asia. The old navigators had little conception of the breadth of this continent. They thought it to be but a few leagues across, and took for granted that some of the many arms of the sea would lead them through to another ocean that would wash the Asiatic shores. In 1500, only eight years after Columbus, Gasper Cortereal, the Portuguese, conceived the idea of entering what afterwards became known as Hudson's Bay and proceeding thence westward through what he called the Strait of Anian. That mythical Strait of Anian seems to have had a strange charm for the old navigators. One of them, Maldonado, a good many years later, gave a very con- nected and apparently veracious account of his journey through that strait, averring that through it he reached another ocean in lati- tude 75. But by means of Magellan's Straits and the doubling of stormy Cape Horn, a connection between the two oceans was actu- ally discovered in 15 19. In 1543 Ferrelo, a Spaniard, coasted along the shores of California, and was doubtless the first white man to gaze on the coast of Oregon, probaljly somewhere in the vicinity of the mouth of the Umpqua river. In 1577 that boldest and most picturesque of all English sailors and freebooters, Francis Drake, started on the marvellous voyage by which he plundered the treasures of the Span- HISTORY OF WALLA WALLA COUNTY. ish Main, cut the golden girdle of Manila, queen of the treasuries of the Spanish orient, skirted the coast of California, Oregon and Washington, and at last circumnavigated the globe. But in 1592, just one hundred years after 'Coluinbus. comes the most picturesque of all those misty stories which enwrap the early liistory of Oregon. This is the story of Juan de Fuca, whose name is now preserved in our northwest boundary strait. According to this romantic tale of the seas, Juan de Fuca was a Greek of Cephalonia, whose real name was Apostolos Valerianos, and under commission of the king of Spain, he sailed to find that Strait of Anian. whose entrance the Spaniards wanted to fortify and guard so as to prevent ingress or egress by the English freebooters who were preying on their commerce. Ac- <:ording to the account given by Michael Lock, \"he followed his course in that voyage, west .and northwest in the South Sea. all along the <:oast of Nova Spania, and California and the Indies, now called North America (all which Toyage he signified to me in a great map, and a sea-card of my own. which I laid before him), until he came to the latitude of 47 de- grees; and that, there finding that the land trended north and northwest, with a broad inlet of sea, between 47 and 48 degrees of latitude, he entered thereinto, sailing more than twenty days, and found that land still trending northwest, and northeast, and north, and also ■east and southeastward, and very much broader sea than was at the said entrance, and that he passed by divers islands in that sailing ; and that, at the entrance of the said strait, there is. on the northwest coast thereof, a great headland or island, with an exceedingly high pinnacle or spired rock, like a pillar, thereupon. Also he said that he went on land in divers places, and that he saw some people on the land clad in beasts' skins;, and that the land was very fruitful and rich of gold, silver and pearls, and other things, like Nova Spania. Also he said that he being entered thus far into the said strait, and being come into the North Sea already, and finding the sea wide enough everywhere, and to be about thirty or forty leagues wide in the mouth of the straits where he entered, he thought he had now well discharged his office : and that, not being armed to resist the force of savage people that might happen, he therefore set sail and turned home- ward again toward Nova Spania, where he ar- rived at Acapulco, Anno 1593, hoping to be re- warded by the Mceroy for this service done in the said voyage.\" This curious bit of past record has been interpreted by some as pure myth, and by others as veritable history. It is at any rate a generally accurate outline description of the Straits of Fuca, the Gulf of Georgia and the shores of Vancouver Island and the mainland adjoining. And whether or not the eld Greek pilot did actually exist and first look on our '■^Mediterranean of the Pacific,\" it is pleasant to imagine that he did, and that his name fittingly preserves the memory of the grand old myth of Anian and the northwest passage. There is one other more obviously myth- ical tale concerning our northwest coast. It is said that in the year 1640 Admiral Pedro de Fonte. of the Spanish marine, made the journey from the Atlantic to the Pacific and return, through a system of rivers and straits, entering the coast at about latitude 53. Coming from Callao in April. 1640, and after having sailed for a long distance through an archipelago, he entered the mouth of a vast river, which he named Rio de Los Reyes. Ascending this for a Ions: distance northeast- HISTORY OF WALLA WALLA COUNTY. >erly, he reached an immense lake, on whose shores he found a weahhy and civihzed nation, who had a capital city of great splendor called Conasset, and who welcomed the strangers with lavish hospitality. From this lake flowed another river easterly, and down this Fonte descended until he reached another great lake, from which a narrow strait led into the At^ lantic ocean. There is one curious thing about these leg- endary voyages, and that is the general accu- racy of their descriptions of the coast. Al- though these accounts are unquestionably mythical, it is not impossible that their authors had actually visited the coast or had seen those who had, and thus gathered the material from which they fabricated, with such an appear- ance of plausibility, their Munchausen tales. We are briefly referring to these fascinat- ing old legends, not for the purpose of discuss- ing them here at any length, but rather to re- mind the reader of the long period of romance and myth which enveloped the early history of our state. Many years passed after the age of myth before there were authentic voyages. During the seventeenth centurj' practically nothing was done in the way of Pacific coast exploration. But in the eighteenth, as by common consent, all the nations of Europe became suddenly infatuated again with the thought that on the western shores of Amer- ica might be found the gold and silver and gems and furs and precious woods, for which they had been striving so desperately upon the eastern coast. English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Dutch, Russian and American, er^tered their bold and hardy sailors into the race for the possession of the land of the Oc- cident. The Russians were the first in the field. That gigantic power, which the genius of Peter the Great had suddenl}- transformed. like one of the fabled genii, from the propor- tions of a grain of sand to a figure overtop- ping the whole earth, had stretched its arms from the Baltic to the Aleutian Archipelago, and had looked southward across the frozen seas of Siberia to the open Pacific as offering them another opportunity of expansion. Many years passed, however, before Peter's designs could be executed. It was 1728 when Vitus Behring entered upon his marvellous life of exploration. Not until 1741, however, did he thread the thousand islands of Alaska and gaze upon the glaciated summit of Mt. St. Elias. And it was not until thirty years later that it was known that the Bay of Avatscha, in Siberia, was connected by open sea with China. In 1771 the first cargo of furs was taken directly from Avatscha, the chief port of eastern Siberia, to Canton. Then first Europe realized the vastness of the Pacific ocean. Then it understood that the same waters which frowned against the frozen bul- warks of Kamtchatka washed the tropic isl- ands of the South Seas and foamed against the storm-swept rocks of Cape Horn. Mean- time, while Russia was thus becoming estab- lished upon the shores of Alaska, Spain was getting entire possession of California. These two great nations began to overlap each other. Russians became established near San Fran- cisco. To offset this movement of Russia, a group of Spanish explorers, Perez, Martinez, Heceta, Bodega, and Maurelle, swarmed up the coast beyond the present site of Sitka. England, in alarm at the progress made by Spain and Russia, sent out the Columbus of the eighteenth century, in the person of Captain James Cook, and he sailed up and down the coast of Alaska and of \\\\'ashington, but failed to discover either the Columbia river or the Straits of Fuca. HISTORY OF \\\\'ALLA \\\\'ALLA COUNTY. Nevertheless his labors did more to estab- lish true geographical notions than had the combined efforts of all the Spanish navigators who had preceded him. His voyages mate- rially strengthened England's claim to Oregon, and added greatly to the luster of her name. The great captain, while temporarily on shore, ■was killed by Indians in 1778, and the com- mand devolved upon Captain Clerke, who sailed northward, passing through Behring Strait to the Arctic ocean. The new com- mander died before the expedition had pro- ceeded far on its return journey. Lieutenant Gore, a Virginian, assumed control and sailed to Canton, China, arriving late in the year. The main purpose of this expedition had been the discovery of a northern waterway be- tween the two oceans aiid the extending of British territory, but, as is so often the case in human affairs, one of the most important re- sults of the voyage was entirely unsuspected by the navigators and practically the outcome of an accident. It so happened that the two vessels of the expedition, the Resolution and the Dis- covery, took with them to China a small col- lection of furs from the northwest coast of America. These were purchased by the Chin- ese with great avidity, the people exhibiting a Avillingness to barter commodities of much value for them and endea\\'oring to secure them at almost any sacritice. The sailors were not backward in communicating their discovery of a new and promising market for peltries, and the impetus imparted to the fur trade was al- most immeasurable in its ultimate effects. An entirely new regime was inaugurated in Chi- nese and East India commerce. The north- west coast of America assumed a new import- ance in the eyes of Em-opeans and especially of the British. The \"struggle for possession\" soon began to be foreshadowed. One of the principal harbors resorted to by fur-trading vessels was Nootka, used as a rendezvous and principal port of departure. This port became the scene of a clash between Spanish authorities and certain British vessels which greatly strained the friendly relations existing between the two governments repre- sented. In 1779, the viceroy of ^lexico sent two ships, the Princesa and San Carlos, to convey ^lartinez and De Haro to the vicinity for the purpose of anticipating and preventing the occupancy of Nootka sound by fur-traders of other nations and that the Spanish title to the territory might be maintained and con- firmed. r^Iartinez was to base his claim upon the discovery by Perez in 1774. Courtesy was to be extended to foreign vessels, but the establishment of any claim prejudicial to the rights of the Spanish crown was to be vigor- ously resisted. Upon the arrival of Martinez in the harbor, it was discovered that the American vessel Columbia, and the Iphigenia, a British ship, under a Portuguese flag, were lying in the har- bor. Martinez at once demanded the papers of both vessels and an explanation of their presence, vigorously asserting the claim of Spain that the port and contiguous territory were hers. The captain of the Iphigenia pleaded stress of weather. On finding that the •/essers papers commanded the capture, under certain conditions, of Russian, Spanish or English vessels, JMartinez seized the ship, but on being advised that the orders relating to captures were intended only to apply to the defense of the vessel, the Spaniard released the Iphigenia and her cargo. The Northwest America, another vessel of the same expedition, was, however, seized by Martinez a little later. It should be remembered that these British vessels had in the inception of the enterprise HISTORY OF WALLA WALLA COUNTY. 5 divested themselves of their true national char- acter and donned the insignia of Portugal, their reasons being: first, to defraud the Chi- nese government, which made special harbor rates to the Portuguese, and second, to defraud the East Lidia Company, to whom had been granted the right of trading in furs in north- west America to the exclusion of all other British subjects, except such as should obtain the permission of the company. To maintain their Portuguese nationality, they had placed the expedition nominally under the control of Juan Cavalho, a Portuguese trader. Prior to the time of the trouble in Nootka, however, Cavalho had become a bankrupt and new ar- rangements had become necessary. The Eng- lish traders were compelled to unite their in- terests with those of King George's Sound Company, a mercantile association operating under license from the South Sea and East India Companies, the Portuguese colors had been laid aside and the true national character of the expedition assumed. Captain Colnutt was placed in command of the enterprise as constituted under the new regime with instruc- tions among other things \"to establish a fac- tory to be called Fort Pitt, for the purpose of permanent settlement, and as a center of trade around which other stations may be estab- lished.\" One vessel of the expedition, the Princess Royal, entered Nootka harbor without mo- lestation, but when the Argonaut, under com- niand of Captain Colnutt, arri\\-ed, it was thought best by the master not to attempt an entrance to the bay lest his vessel should meet the same fate which had befallen the Iphige- nia and the Northwest America. Later, Col- nutt called on Martinez and informed the Span- ish governor of his intention to take pos- session of the country in the name of Great Britain and to erect a fort. The governor re- plied that possession had already been taken in the name of his Catholic majesty and that such acts as he (Colnutt) contemplated could not be allowed. An altercation followed and the next day the Argonaut was seized and her captain and crew placed under arrest. The Princess Royal .was also seized, though the American vessels in the harbor were in no way molested. After an extended and at times heated con- troversy between Spain and Great Britain touching these seizures, the former govern- ment consented to make reparation and offered a suitable apology for the indignity to the honor of the flag. The feature of this corre- spondence of greatest import in the future his- tory of the territory affected is that through- out the entire controversy and in all the royal messages and the debates of parliament, no word was spoken asserting a claim of Great Britain to any territorial rights or denying the claim of sovereignty so positively and persist- ently avowed by Spain, neither was Spanish sovereignty denied or in any way alienated by the treaty which followed. Certain real prop- erty was restored to British subjects, but a transfer of realty is not a transfer of sover- eignty. We pass over the voyage of the illustrious French navigator, La Perouse, as of more im- portance from a scientific than from a political standpoint, neither can we dwell upon the ex- plorations of Captain Berkley, to whom be- longs the honor of having ascertained the ex- istence of the strait afterward denominated Juan de Fuca. Of somewhat greater moment in the later history of the northwest are the A'oyages of Meares, who entered and described the above mentioned strait, and who, in 1788, explored the coast at the point where the great HISTORY OF WALLA WALLA COUNTY. Columbia mingles its crystal current with the waters of the sea. In the diplomatic battle of later days, it was even claimed by some that he was the discoverer of that great \"River ot the West.\" Howbeit, nothing can be surer than that the existence of such a river was ut- terly unknown to him at the time. Indeed his conviction of its non-existence was thus started in his own account of the voyage : \"We can now with safety assert that there is no such river as St. Roc (of the Spaniard, Heceta) exists, as laid down in the Spanish charts,\" and he gave a further unequivocal expression of his opinion by naming the bay in that vicinity Deception Bay and the promontory north of it Cape Disappointment. \"Disap- pointed and deceived,\" remarks Evans face- tiously, \"he continued his cruise southward to latitude forty-five degrees north.\" It is not without sentiments of patriotic pride, that we now turn our attention to a period of discovery in which the vessels of our own nation played a prominent part. The northern mystery, which had been partially resolved by the Spanish, English, French and Portuguese explorations, was new to be com- pletely robbed of its mystic charm, speculation and myth must now give place to exact knowl- edge, the game of discovery must hereafter be played principally between the two branches of the Anglo-Saxon race, and Anglo-Saxon energy, thoroughness and zeal are henceforth to characterize operations on ths shores of the Pacific northwest. The L^nited States had but recently won their independence from the British Crown and their energies were find- ing a fit field of activity in the titanic task of national organization. Before the constitu- tion had become the supreme law of the land, however, the alert mind of the American had begun projecting voyages of discovery and trade to the northwest, and in September. 1788,. two vessels with the stars and stripes at their mastheads arrived at Nootka sound. Their presence in the harbor while the events culmi- nating in the Nootka treaty were transpiring has already been alluded to. The vessels were the ship Columbia, Captain John Ken- drick, and the sloop Washington, Captain Robert Gray, and the honor of having sent them to our shores belongs to one Joseph Bar- rel, a prominent merchant of Boston, and a man of high social standing and great influ- ence. While one of the impelling motives of this enterprise had been the desire of commer- cial profit, the element of patriotism was not wholly lacking, and the vessels were instructed t'l make what explorations and discoveries they might. After remaining a time on the coast. Cap' tain Kendrick transferred his ship's property to the Washington, with the intention of taking a cruise in that vessel. He placed Captain Gray in command of the Columbia, with instruc- tions to return to Boston by way of the Sand- wich Islands and China. This commission was successfully carried out. The vessel ar- rived in Boston in September, 1790. was re- ceived with great eclat, refitted by her owners and again dispatched to the shores of the Pacific, with Captain Gray in command. In July, 1 79 1, the Columbia from Boston and the Washington from China met not far from the spot wliere they had separated nearly two years before. They were not to remain long in company, however, for Captain Gray soon started on a cruise southward. On April 29, 1792, Gray met A^ancouver just below Cape Flattery and an interesting colloquy took place. Vancouver communicated to the American skipper the fact that he had not yet made any important discoveries, and Gray, with equal HISTORY OF WALLA WALLA COUNTY. frankness, gave the eminent British explorer an account of his past discoveries, \"inchiding,\" says Bancroft, \"the fact that he had not sailed through Fuca Strait in the Lady Washington, as had been supposed from Meares' narrative and map.\" He also informed Captain Van- couver that he had been \"off the mouth of a river in latitude forty-six degrees, ten minutes, where the outset, or reflux, was so strong as to prevent his entering for nine days.\" The important information conveyed by Gray seems to have greatly disturbed the ec|ui- poise of Vancouver's mind. The entries in his log show that he did not entirely credit the statement of the American, but that he was considerably perturbed is evidenced by the fact that he tried to convince himself by argument that Gray's statement could not have been correct. The latitude assigned by the American was that of Cape Disappointment, and the existence of a river mouth there, though affirmed by Heceta, had been deniecl by Meares ; Captain Cook also had failed to find it, besides had he not himself passed that point two days before and had he not observed that \"if any inlet or river should be found it must be a very intricate one, and inaccessible to vessels of our burden, owing to the reefs and broken water which then appeared in its neighborhood.\" With such reasoning, he dis- missed the matter from his mind for the time being. He continued his journey northward, passed through the strait of Fuca, and engaged in a tliorough and minute exploration of that mighty inland sea, to a portion of which he gave the name of Puget Sound. Meanwhile Gray was proceeding south- ward \"in the track of destiny and glory.\" On May /th he entered the harbor which now bears his name and four days later he passed through the breakers over the bar, and his ves- sel's prow plowed the waters of that famous \"River of the West.\" whose existence had been so long suspected. The storied \"Oregon\" for the first time heard other sound than \"its own dashing.\" Shortly afterward Vancouver came to Cape Disappointment to explore the Colum- bia, of which he had heard indirectly from Captain Gray. Lieutenant Broughton of Van- couver's expedition sailed over the bar, as- cended the river a distance of more than one hundred miles to the site of the present Van- couver, and with a modesty truly remarkable, \"takes possession of the river and the country in its vicinity in his Britannic Majesty's name, having every reason to believe that the sub- jects of no other civilized nation or state had ever entered it before.\" This, too, though he had received a salute of one gun from an American vessel, the Jennie, on his entrance to the bay. The lieutenant's claim was not to remain fore\\-er unchallenged, as will appear presently. With the exploration of Puget sound and the discovery of the Columbia, history-making maritime adventure practically ceased. But as the fabled Strait of Anian had drawn explorers to the Pacific shores in cjuest of the mythical passage to the treasures of the Ind, so likewise did the faii'y tales of La Hontan and others stimulate inland exploration. Furthermore the mystic charm always possessed by a terra in- cognita was becoming irresistible to aih'cntur- ous spirits, and the possibilities of discovering untold wealth in the vaults of its \"Shining mountains\" and in the sands of its crystal rivers were exceedingly fascinating to the lover of gain. The honor of pioneership in o\\-erland ex- ploration belongs to Verendrye, who under authority of the governor-general of New 8 HISTORY OF WALLA WALLA COUNTY. France. In 1773, set out on an expedition to the Rocky mountains from Canada. This explorer and his brother and sons made many important explorations, but as they failed to find a pass th.rough the Rocky mountains by which they could come to the Pacific side, their adventures do not fall within the purview of our volume. They are said to have reached the present vicin- ity of Helena. If, as seems highly probable, the events chronicled by La Page in his charming \"His- toire de la Louisiane,\" published in 1758, should be taken as authentic, the first man to scale the Rocky mountains from the east and to make his way overland to the shores of the Pacific was a Yazoo Indian, Moncacht-ape or Montcachabe by name. But \"the first traveler to lead a party of cl\\'ilized men through the territorv of the Stony mountains to the South Sea\" was Alexander Mackenzie, who, in 1793, reached the coast at fifty-two degrees, twenty- four minutes, forty-eight seconds north, leav- ing as a memorial of his visit, inscribed on a rock with vermilion and grease the words. \"Alexander Mackenzie, from Canada by land. July 22, 1793.\" His field of discovery was also without the scope of our purpose, being too far north to figure prominently in the in- ternational complications of later years. Western exploration by land, had, how- ever,- elicited the interest of one whose energy and force were sufificient to bring to a success- ful issue almost any undertaking worth the eft'ort. ^^'hile the other statesmen and legis- lators of his time were fully engaged with the problems of the moment, the great mind of Thomas Jefferson, endowed as it was with a wider range of vision and more comprehensive grasp of the true situation, was projecting ex- ploring expeditions into the northwest. In 1786, while serving as minister to Paris, he had fallen in with the ardent Ledyard, who was on fire with the idea of opening a large and profitable fur-trade in the north Pacific region. To this young man, he had suggested the idea of journeying to Kamchatka, then in a Russian vessel to Nootka sound, from which, as a starting point, he should make an explor- ir.g expedition easterly to the United States. Ledyard acted on the suggestion, but was ar- rested as a spy in the spring of 1787, by Rus- sian officials, and so severely treated as to cause a failure of his health, and a consequent fail- ure of his enterprise. The next eft'ort of Jefiferson was made in 1792, when he proposed to the American Phil- osophical Society that it should engage a com- petent scientist \"to explore northwest America from the eastward by ascending the Missouri, crossing the Rocky mountains, and descending the nearest river to the Pacific ocean.\" The idea was favorably received. Captain Meri- wether Lewis, who afterwards distinguished himself as one of the leaders of the Lewis and Clark expedition, offered his services, but for some reason Andre Michaux. a French botanist, was given the preference. Michaux proceeded as far as Kentucky, but there re- ceived an order from the French minister, to whom, it seems, he also owed obedience, that he should relinquish his appointment and en- gage upon the duties of another commission. It was not until after the opening of the new century that another opportunity for fur- thering his favorite project presented itself. An act of congress, under which trading- houses had been established for facilitating commerce with the Indians, was about to ex- pire by limitation, and President Jefferson, in recommending its continuance, seized the op- portunity to urge upon congress the advisabil- ity of fitting out an expedition the object of HISTORY OF WALLA WALLA COUNTY. wliich sliould be \"to explore the ^Missouri river and such principal streams of it as, by its course of communication with the waters of the Pacific ocean, whether the Columbia, Oregon, Colo- rado, or an}- other river, may offer the most direct and practical water communication across the continent, for the purposes of com- merce.\" Congress voted an appropriation for the purpose, and the expedition was placed in charge of Captains Meriwether Lewis and William Clark (or Clarke). President Jeffer- son gave the explorers minute and particular instructions as to investigations to be made by them. They were to inform themselves should they reach the Pacific ocean, \"of the circum- siances which may decide whether the furs of thnse parts may be collected as advantage- ously at the head of the Missouri (convenient as is supposed to the Colorado and Oregon or Columbia) as at Nootka sound or any other part of that coast; and the trade be constantly conducted through the Missouri and United States more beneficially than b)- the circum- navigation now practiced.\" Li addition to the instructions already cjuoted, these explorers were directed to ascertain if possible on arriv- ing at the seaboard if there were any ports within their reach frecjuented by the sea-vessels of any nation and to send, if practicable, two of their most trusted people back by sea with copies of their notes. They were also, if they deemed a return by the way they had come imminently hazardous, to ship the entire party and return via Good Hope or Cape Horn as they might be able. A few days before the initial steps were taken in discharge of the instructions of Presi- dent Jefferson, news reached the seat of gov- ernment of a transaction which added materi- ally to the significance of the enterprise. Nego- tiations had been successfully consummated for the purchase of Louisiana on April 30, 1803, but the authorities at Washington did not hear of the important transfer until the ist of July. Of such transcendent import to the future of our country was this transaction and of such vital moment to the section with which our volume is primarily concerned, that we must here interrupt the trend of our narrative to give the reader an idea of the extent of terri- tory involved and if possible, to enable him to appreciate the influence of the purchase. France, by her land explorations and the estab- lishment of trading posts and forts, first ac- quired title to the territory west of the Miss- issippi and east of the Rocky mountains, though Great Britain claimed the territory in accord- ance with her doctrine of continuity and con- tiguity, most of her colonial grants extending i:i express terms to the Pacific ocean. Spain also claimed the country by grant of Pope Alexander VI. A constant warfare had been waged between France and Great Britain for supremacy in America. The latter was the winner in the contest, and, in 1762, France, apparently discouraged, ceded to Spain the province of Louisiana. By the treaty of Feb- ruary 10, 1763, which gave Great Britain the Canadas, it was agreed that the western boun- dary between English and Spanish possessions in America should be the Mississippi river. Great Britain renouncing all claim to the terri- tory west of that boundary. In 1800, Spain retroceded Louisiana to France \"with the same extent it has now in the hands of Spain, and which it had when France possessed it, and such as it should be according to the treaties subsec[u'ently made between Spain and other states.\" The order for the formal delivery of the province to France was issued by the Spanish HISTORY OF WALLA WALLA COUNTY. had not been established at that time, but some king on October 15, 1802, and, as above stated, the United States succeeded to the title by treaty of April 30, 1803. Exact boundaries idea of the extent of this purchase may be had when we remember that it extended from the present British line to the Gulf of Mexico and included what are now the states of Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Arkansas and Louisiana, the territory of Oklahoma, Indian Territory, more than three-fourths of Montana and Wyoming, also parts of Colorado and New Mexico. Thus an enterprise which had its inception for its chief object to advance tlie commerical interests of the United States acquired a new purpose, namely, the extending of the geo- graphical and scientific knowledge concerning our ozi'ii domain. Upon Lewis and Clark a further duty devolved, that of informing the natives that obedience was now due to a new great father. The world-old wizard of \"Out West\" stretched his wand over them, and under its magic sway they began, by mountain trail and river and open highway of -the prairie, to follow it into the wilderness. That same impulse led them which drew the camel-drivers of Syria to the shores of the Mediterranean, which filled the sails of Roman galleys, which beckoned the Norse Viking to the desolate grandeur of Greenland, and which lit a signal fire in the tropic verdure of the Bahamas for the far- reaching vision of Columbus. So our great- grandfathers were chasing toward the sunset the shadow of their own coming greatness, a shadow gigantic but always growing, crossing the great plains with seven-league boots and stepping across the ridge-pole of the continent like a Colossus. It is not surprising that to minds just ad- mitted to this atmosphere of boundless expecta- tion, even this plain and common-place narra- tive of Lewis and Clark should have had the fascination of a novel. This historic expedition had been pro- jected and even partially fitted out by Jefferson before the purchase of Louisiana. But imme- diately upon the completion of that most saga- cious investment, the lingering preparations were hastened, and on the 14th of May, 1804, the party left St. Louis by boat, upon the muddy current of the Missouri, to search for the un- known mountains and rivers between there and the Pacific. Their plan was to ascend the Mis- souri to its source, cross the divide, strike the headwaters of the Columljia, and, descending it, reach the sea. And what manner of men were undertak- ing this voyage, fraught with both interest and peril ? Meriwether Lewis, the leader of the party, was a captain in the United States army, and in Jefferson's judgment was, by reason of endurance, boldness, and energy, the fittest man within his knowledge for the responsible duties of commander. His whole life had been one of reckless adventure. It appears that at the tender age of eight he was already illustrious for successful mid- night forays vipon the festive coon ani the meditative possum. He was lacking in scienti- fic knowledge, but. when appointed captain of the expedition, had, with characteristic pluck, spent a few spare weeks in study of some of the branches most essential to his new work. Will- iam Clark, second in command, was also a L^nited States officer, and seems to have been equally fitted with Lewis for his work. The party consisted of fourteen United States regu- lars, nine Kentucky volunteers, two French voyageurs, a hunter, an interpreter, and a ne- gn^. To each of the common soldiers the gov- HISTORY OF WALLA WALLA COUNTY. ernment offered the munificent reward of retire- ment upon full pay with a recommendation for a soldier's grant of land. Special pains were taken to encourage the party to keep complete records of all they saw and heard and did. This was done with a vengeance, insomuch that seven journals besides those of the leaders were carefully kept, and in them was recorded nearly every event from the most important discov- eries down to the ingredients of their meals and doses of medicine. They were abundantly provided with beads, mirrors, knives, etc., etc., wherewith to woo the savage hearts of the natives. After an interesting and easy journey of five months they reached the country of the Mandans, and here they determined to winter. The winter having been profitably spent in making the acquaintance of the Indians and in collecting specimens of the natural history of the plains — which they now sent back to the president with great care — they again embarked in a squadron of six canoes and two pirogues. On June 13th they reached the great falls of the Missouri. A month was spent within sound of the thunder and in sight of the perpetual mist- cloud rising from the abyss, before they could accomplish the difficult portage of eighteen miles, make new canoes, mend their clothes, and lay in a new stock of provisions. Of material for this last there was no end. The air was filled with migratory birds, and the party was almost in danger of being overrun by the enor- mous herds of buffalo. The long, bright days, the tingling air of the mountains, the pleasant swish of the water as their canoes breasted the swift current — the vast camp fires and the nightly buffalo roasts — all these must have made this the pleasantest section of their long journey. The party seems to have pretty nearly ex- hausted its supply of names, and after having made heavy draughts en their own with various permutatory combinations, they were reduced to the extremity of loading innocent creeks with tlie ponderous names of Wisdom, Philosophy, and Philanthropy. Succeeding generations have relieved the unjust pressure in two of these cases with the sounding appellations of Big Hole and Stinking Water. On the 1 2th of August the explorers crossed the great divide, the birthplace of mighty rivers, and descending the sunset slope found them- selves in the land of the Shoshones. They had brought with them a Shoshone woman, rejoicing in the pleasant name of Sacajawea, for the express purpose of becoming acquainted with this tribe, through whom they hoped tO' get horses and valuable information as to their proper route to the ocean. But four days were consumed in enticing the suspicious savages near enough to hear the words of their own tongue proceeding from the camp of the strang- ers. When, however, the fair interpretress had been granted a hearing, she speedily won for the party the faithful allegiance of her kinsmen. They innocently accepted the rather general in- timation of the explorers that this journey had for its primary object the happiness and pros- perity of the Shoshone nation, and to these evidences of benevolence on the part of their newly adopted great father at Washington, they quickly responded by bringing plenty of horses and all the information in their poor power. It appears that the expedition was at that time on the headwaters of the Salmon river, near where Fort Lemhi afterward stood. With twenty-nine horses to carry their abundant bur- dens they bade farewell to the friendly Sho- shones on the last day of August, and com- HISTORY OF WALLA WALLA COUNTY. mitted themselves to tlie dreaiy and desolate solitudes to the westward. They soon became entangled in the savage ridges and defiles, al- read}^ spotted with snow, of the Bitter Root mountains. Having crossed several branches of the great river named in honor of Captain Clark, and becoming distressed at the increasing dangers and delays, they turned to the left, and, having punished a brawling creek for its in- hospitalit}^ by inflicting on it the name of Colt- killed, commemorative of their extremity for food, they came upon a wild and beautiful stream, inquiring the name of which from the Indians the\\' received the answer, \"Kooskons- kie.\" This in reality meant simply that this was not the stream for which they were search- ing. But not understanding, they named the river Kooskooskie. This Avas afterwards called the Clearwater, and is the most beautiful tribu- tary of the Snake. The country still frowned on them with the same forbiddmg rocky heights and blinding snow storms as before. It began to seem as though famine would ere long stare them in the face, and the shaggy precipices were marked with almost daily accidents to men and beasts. Their only meat was the flesh of their precious horses. Under these circumstances Clark decided to take six of the most active men and push ■ ahead in search of game and a more hospit- able country. A hard march of twenty miles rewarded him with a view of a vast open plain in front of the broken mountain chain across W'hich they had been struggling. It was three days, however, before they fairly cleared the edge of the mountains and emerged on the great prairie north and east of where Lewis- ton now is. They found no game except a stray horse, which they speedily dispatched. Here the ad\\-ance guard waited for the main body to come up, and then all together they went down to the Clearwater where a large number of Nez Perce Indians gathered to see and trade with them. Receiving from these Indians, who, like all that they had met, seemed \\-ery amicably disposed, the cheering news that the great river was not very distant, and seeing the Clearwater to be a fine, navigable stream, they determined to abandon the weary land march and make canoes. Five of these having been constructed, they laid in a stock of dog meat, and then committed themselves to the sweeping current with which all the tributaries of the Columbia hasten to their destined place. They left their horses with the Nez Perces, and it is worthy of special notice that these were remarkably faithful to their trust. In- deed, it may be safely asserted that the first explorers of this country almost uniformly met with the kindest reception. The cruelty and deceit afterward characteristic of the Indians were learned partly of the whites. On the loth of October, having traveled sixty miles on the Clearwater, its pellucid waters delivered them to the turbid, angry, sullen, and lava-banked Snake. This great stream they called the Kimooenim. its Indian name. It was in its low season, and it seems fiom their account that it, as well as all the other streams, must have been uncommonly low that year. Thus they say that on October 13th they descended a very bad rapid fovu' miles in length, at the lower part of which the whole river was compressed into a channel only twen- five yards wide. Immediately below the}^ passed a large stream on the right, which they called Drew\\'er's river, from one of their men. This must have been the Palouse river and rapid, and certainly it is very rare that the HISTORY OF WALLA WALLA COUNTY. 13 mighty Snake becomes attenuated at that point to a width of twenty-five yards. The next day, descending the w'orst rapids they had yet seen (probably the Monumental rapid) it re- pelled their affrontery by upsetting\" one of the boats. No lives were lost, but the cargo of the boat was badly wetted. For the purpose of drying it they stopped a day, and finding no other timber, they were compelled to use a very appropriate pile which some Indians had very carefully stored away and cov- ered with stone. This trifling circumstance is noticed because of the explorers speaking in connection with it of their customary scrupu- lousness in never taking any property of the Indians, and of their determination to repay the owner if they could find him, on their re- turn. If all explorers had been as particular, m.uch is the distress and loss that would have been avoided. They found almost continuous rapids from this point to the mouth of the Snake, which they reached on October i6th. Here they were met by a regular procession of nearly two hundred Indians. They had a grand pow- wow and both parties displayed great affec- tion for each other, the whites bestowing medals, shirts, trinkets, etc., in accordance with the rank of the recipient, and the Indians re- paying the kindness with abundant and pro- longed visits and accompanying gifts of wood and fish. On the next day they measured the rivers, finding the Columbia to be 960 yards wide, and the Snake 575. They indulge in no poetic reveries as they stand by the river which had been one principal object of their search, but they seem to have seen pretty much every- thing of practical value. In the glimmering haze of the pleasant October morning they no- tice tlie \\-ast bare prairie stretching southward until broken by the rounded summits of the Blue mountains. They find the Sohulks, who lived at the junction of the rivers, a mild and happy people, the men being content with one wife, whom they actually assist in the family work. Captain Clark ascended the Columbia to the mouth of a large river coming from the west, which the Indians called the Tapteal. This was, of course, the Yakima. The people living at its mouth rejoiced in the liquid name of Chimnapum. Here Captain Clark shot what he called a prairie cock, the first he had seen, li: was the sage hen, no doubt, a handsome bird nearly as large as a turkey and very common along the river at the present time. After two days' rest, being well supplied with fish, dog, roots, etc., and at peace with their own consciences and all the world, with satisfaction at the prospect of soon completing their journey, they re-embarked. Sixteen miles below the mouth of the Kimooenim, which they now began to call the Lewis river, they described, cut clear against the dim hor- izon line of the southwest, a pyramidal moun- tain, covered with snow — their first view of Mount Hood. The next day, being in the vicinity of Umatilla, they saw another snowy peak at a conjectured distance of one hundred and fifty miles. This they supposed to be Mount St. Helens, but it was, in reality. Mount Adams. Near here Captain Clark, having landed, shot a crane and a duck. Some Indians near were almost paralyzed with terror. At last they re- covered enough to make the best possible use of their legs. Following them Captain Clark found a little cluster of huts. Pushing aside the mat door of one of them, he entered, and in the brioht light of the unroofed hut discov- M HISTORY OF WALLA WALLA COUNTY. -ered thirty-two persons, all of whom were in the greatest terror, some wailing and wringing their hands. Having by kind looks and gestures soothed their grief, he held up his burning glass to •catch a stray sunbeam with which to light his pipe. Thereat the consternation of the In- dians revived, and they refused to be com- forted. But when the rest of the party arrived with the two Indian guides w'ho had come with them from the Clearwater, terror gave way to curiosity and pleasure. These Pishquitpaws — such was their name — explained to the guides their fear of Captain Clark by saying that he ■came from the sky accompanied by a terrible noise, and they knew that there was a bad medicine in it. Being convinced now that he was a mortal after all, they became very affectionate, and having heard the music of two violins they be- came so enamoured of the strangers that they stayed up all night with them and collected to the number of two hundred to bid them good bye in the morning. The principal busi- ness of these Indians seemed to be catching and ■curing salmon, which, in the clear water of the Columbia, the explorers could see swimming .about in incredible numbers. Continuing with no extraordinary occurrence, they passed the river now called the John Day, to which they applied the name Lapage. Mt. Hood w^as now almost constantly in view, and since the In- dians told them it was near the great falls of the Columbia, they called it the Timm (this seems to be the Indian word for falls) moun- tain. On the next day they reached a large river on the left, which came thundering through a narrow channel into the equally turbulent Co- lumbia. This river, which Captain Lewis judged to contain one-fourth as much water as the Columbia (an enormous over estimate) answered to the Indian name of Towahna- hiooks. It afterwards received from the French the name now used — Des Chutes. They now perceived that they were near the place hinted at by nearly every Indian that they had talked with since crossing the divide — the great falls. And a weird, savage place it proved to be. Here the clenched hands of trachyte and basalt, thrust through the soil from the buried realm of the volcanoes, almost clutch the rushing river. Only here and there between the parted fingers can he make his escape. After making several portages they reached tb.at extraordinary place (now called The Dalles) Avhere all the waters gathered from half a million square miles of earth are squeezed into a crack forty-five yards wide. The desola- tion on either side of this frightful chasm is a fitting margin. As one crawls to the edge and peeps over he sees the water to be of inky blackness. Streaks of foam gridiron the blackness. There is little noise compared with the shallow rapids above, but rather a dismal sough, as though the rocks below were rub- bing their black sides together in the \\-ain eft\"ort to close over the escaping river. The river is here \"turned on edge.\" In fact, its depth has not been found to this day. Some suppose that there was once a natural tunnel here through which the river flowed, and that in consequence of a volcanic convulsion the top of the tunnel fell in. If there be any truth in this, the width of the channel is no doubt much greater at the bottom than at the top. Lewis and Clark, finding that the roughness of the shore made it almost impossible to carry their boats over, and seeing no evidence of rocks in the channel, boldly steered right throu2-h this Witches' Cauldron, Though no HISTORY OF WALLA WALLA COUNTY. 15 doubt whirled along with frightful rapidity and flung like foam flakes on the crests of the boiling surges, they reached the end of the \"chute\" without accident, to the amazement of the Indians who had collected on the bluff to witness the daring experiment. After two more portages the party safely entered the broad, still flood beginning where the town of The Dalles now stands. Here they paused for two days to hunt and caulk their boats. They here began to see evidences of the white traders below, in blankets, axes, brass kettles, and other articles of civilized manufacture. The Indians, too, were more inclined to be saucy and suspicious. The dalles seemed to be a dividing line be- tween the Indian tribes. Those living at the falls, where Celilo now is, called the Enee- shurs, understood and \"fellowshipped\" with all the up-river tribes. But at the narrows and thence to the dalles was a tribe called the Es- cheloots. These were entirely alien to the Indians above, but on intimate terms with those below to the cascades. Among the Esche- loots the explorers first noticed the peculiar \"cluck\" in speech common to all down-river tribes. The flattening of the head, which above belonged to the females only, was now the common thing. The place where Lewis and Clark camped while at the dalles was just below Mill creek (called by the natives Ouenett), on a point of rocks near the present location of the car shops. The next Indian tril^e, extending appar- ently from the \\-icinity of Crate's point to the cascades, capped the climax of tongue-twist- ing names b}^ calling themselves Chilluckitte- quaws. Xothing of an extraordinary character seems to have been encountered between the dalles and the cascades. But the explorers had their eyes wide open, and the calm majesty of the river and the savage grandeur of its shores received due notice. They observed and named most of the streams on the route, the first of importance being the Cataract river (now the Klickitat), then Labieshe's river (Hood river), Canoe creek (White Salmon) and Crusatte's river. This last must have been the Little \\Vhite Salmon, though they were greatly de- ceived as to its size, stating it to be sixty yards wide. In this vicinity they were much struck with the sunken forest, which at that low stage of the water was very conspicuous. They correctly inferred that this indicated a dam- ming up of the river at a very recent time. In deed they judged that it must have occurred within twenty years. It is well known, how- ever, that submerged trees or piles, as indicated by remains of the old Roman wharfs in Britain, may remain intact for hundreds of years. It is, nevertheless, evident that the closing of the ri\\-er at the cascades was a \\-ery recent event. It is also evident from the sliding, sinking, and grinding constantly seen there now that a sim- ilar event is liable to happen at any time. The cascades having been reached more portages were required. Slow and tedious though the}- were, the explorers seem to have endured them with unfailing patience. They were cheered by the prospect of soon putting all the rapids behind and launching their ca- noes on the unobstructed vastness of the lower river. This was successfully accomplished on the 2d of Xovember. They were greatly delight- ed with the verdure which now robed the gaunt nakedness of the rocks. The island formed at the lower cascades by Columbia slough also pleased them great]}- by its fertility and its dense growth of grass and strawberrv vines. i6 HISTORY OF WALLA W^-VLLA COUNTY. From this last circumstance they named it Strawberry island. At the lower part of that cluster of islands, that spired and turreted relic of the old feudal age of the river, when the volcano kings stormed each other's castles with earthquakes and spouts of lava, riveted their attention. They named it Beacon rock, but it is now called Castle rock. They esti- mated its height at eight hundred feet and its circumference at four hundred yards, the lat- ter being only a fourth of the reality. The tides were now noticeable. This fact must have struck a new chord of reflection in the minds of these hardy adventurers; this first-felt pulse beat of the dim vast of waters which grasps half the circumference of the earth. And so, as this mighty heart-throb of the ocean, rising and falling in harmony with all *nature, celestial and terrestrial, pulsated through a hundred and eighty miles of river, it might have seemed one of the ocean's mul- tiplied fingers outstretched to welcome them, the first organized expedition of the new re- public to this westmost west. It might have betokened to them the harmony and unity of future nations, as exemplified in the vast ex- tent, the liberty, the human sympathies, the diversified interests, industries and purposes of that republic, whose motto yet remains, one from many. The rest of their journey was a calm float- ing between, meadows and islands from whose shallow' ponds they obtained ducks and geese in great numbers. They thought the \"quick-sand river\" — Sandy — to be a large and important stream. They noticed the \\\\'ashougal creek, which from the great number of seals around its mouth they called Seal river. But strange to say they missed the Willamette entirely on their down trip. The Indians in this part of the river called themselves Skilloots. Drop- ping rapidly down the calm but misty stream, past a large river called by the Indians the Cowaliske — Cowlitz — through the country of the Wahkiacums, at last, on the 7th of No- vember, the dense fog with which the morn- ing had enshrouded all objects, suddenly broke away, and they saw the bold mountainous shores on either side to vanish away in front, and through the parted headlands they looked into the infinite expanse of the ocean. Overjoyed at the successful termination of their journey, they sought the first pleas- ant camping ground and made haste to land. The rain, which is sometimes even now ob- served to characterize that part of our fair state, greatly marred the joy of their first night's rest within sound of the Pacific's billows. Six days passed in mouldy and dripping- inactivity at a point a little above the present Chinook. They then spent nine much pleas- anter days at Chinook Point. This, however, not proving what they wanted for a perma- nent camp, they devoted themselves to explo- rations with a view to discovering a more suitable location. After many adventures of which lack of space forbids us to speak, they became settled. The party wintered in a log building at a point named by them Fort Clatsop, on the Lewis and Clark river, south side of the Columbia. On the 23d of ]\\Iarch, 1806, they turned their faces homeward, first, however, having given to the chiefs of the Clatsops and Chinooks certificates of hospitable treatment, and posted on the fort the following notice: \"The object of this last is. that, through the medium of some ci\\-ilized person who may see the same, it may be made known to the world, that the party consisting of the persons whose names HISTORY OF WALLA WALLA COUNTY. 17 are hereunto annexed and who were sent out by the go\\-ernment of the United States to ex- plore the interior of the continent of North America, did penetrate the same by way of the Missouri and Columbia rivers, to the discharge of the latter into the Pacific ocean, at which they arrived on the 14th day of November, 1805, and departed on their return to the United States by the same route by which they had come.\" Of this notice several copies were left among the Lidians, one of which fell into the hands of Captain Hall of the brig Lydia and was conveyed to the United States. The expedition made its way with no little difficulty up the Columbia river. They dis- covered on their return a large tributary of tb.at river (the Willamette) which had escaped their notice on their downward journey, and made careful inquiries of the Indians concern- ing it, the results of which were embodied in their map of the expedition. At the mouth of the John Day river their canoes were abandoned, their baggage was packed on the backs of a few horses they had purchased from the Indians, and traveling in tliis manner, they continued their homeward march, arriving at the mouth of the Walla \\\\'alla river on April 27th. The great chief \\ellept was then the leader of the Walla Walla nation, and by him the explorers were received with such generous hospitality that they yield- ed to the temptation to linger a couple of days before undertaking further journeyings among the mountain fastnesses. Such was the treat- ment given them by these Indians, that the journal of the expedition makes this apprecia- . tive notation concerning them : \"We may in- deed justly affirm that of all the Indians that we have seen since leaving the United States, the Walla Wallas were the most hospitable, honest and sincere.\" Of the return journey for the next hun- dred and fifty miles, that venerable pioneer missionary. Dr. H. K. Hines, writes as fol- lows : \"Leaving these hospitable people on the 29tli of April, the party passed eastward on the great 'Nez Perce trail.' This trail was the great highway of the Walla Wallas, Cayuses and Nez Perces eastward to the buffalo ranges, to which they annually resorted for game sup- plies. It passed up the \\-alley of the Touchet, called by Lewis and Clark the AVlfite Stal- lion,' thence over the high prairie ridges and down the Alpowa to the crossing of the Snake ri\\-er, then up the north bank of Clearwater to the village of Twisted Hair, where the ex- ploring party had left their horses on the way down the previous autumn. It was worn deep and broad, and On many stretches on the open plains and over the smooth hills twenty horse- men could ride abreast in parallel paths worn by the constant rush of the Indian generations from time immemorial. The writer has often passed over it when it lay exactly as it did when the tribes of Yellept and Twisted Hair traced its sinuous courses, or when Lewis and Clark and their companions first marked it \\vith the heel of civilization. But the plow has long since obliterated it, and where the monotonous song of the Indian march was droningly chanted for so many barbaric ages the song of the reaper thrills the clear air as he comes to his garner bringing in the sheaves. A more delightful ride of a hundred and fifty miles than this that the company of Lewis and Clark made over the swelling prairie upland and along the crystal streams between Walla Walla and the village of Twisted Hair, in the soft ]\\Iay days i8 HISTORY OF WALLA WALLA COUXTY. of 1806, can scarcely be found anywhere on earth. To trace the explorations of these trav- elers further is not within the province of this work, but in order to convey a general idea of the labors and extent of the voyage we quote the brief summary made by Captain Lewis himself : \"The road by which we went out by the ^^■ay of the I^Iissouri to its head is 3,096 miles; thence by land by wa)- of Lewis river over to Clark's river and down that to the entrance of Traveler's Rest creek, where all the roads from different routes meet ; thence across the rugged jjart of the Rocky mountains to the navigable Avaters of the Columbia 398 miles, thence down the ri\\'er 640 miles to the Pacific ocean — making a total distance of 4,134 miles. On our return in 1806 we came from Traveler's Rest directly to the falls of the [Missouri river, v.hich shortens the distance about 579 miles, antl is a much better route, reducing the dis- tance from the INIississippi to the Pacific ocean to 3.555 miles. Of this distance 2.575 miles is up the ]\\Iissouri to the falls of that river; thence passing through the plains and across the Rocky mountains to the navigable waters of the Kooskooskie river, a branch of the Co- lumbia. 340 miles, 200 of which is good road, 140 miles over a tremendous mountain, steep and broken, sixty miles of which is covered several feet deep with snow, on which we passed on the last of June ; from the navigable part of the Kooskooskie we descended that rapid river seventy-three miles to its entrance into the Lewis river, and down that river 154 miles to the Columbia, and thence 413 miles to its entrance into the Pacific ocean. About 180 miles of this distance is tide water. We passed several bad rapids and narrows, and one considerable fall, 268 miles above the en- trance of this river, thirty-seven feet, eight inches; the total distance descending the Co- lumbia Avaters 640 miles — making a total of 3,55s miles, on the most direct route from the [Mississippi, at the mouth of the [Missouri, to the Pacific ocean.\" The safe return of the explorers to their homes in the United States naturally created a sensation throughout this country and the world. Leaders and men were suitably re- warded, and the fame of the former will live while the rivers to which their names have been given continue to pour their waters into the sea. President Jefferson, the great patron of the expedition, paying a tribute to Captain Lewis in 1813. said: \"Xever did a similar event excite more joy throughout the United States. The humblest of its citizens have taken a lively interest in the issue of this journe}-, and looked with impatience for the information it would furnish. Nothing short of the of- ficial journals of this extraordinary and in- teresting journey will exhibit the importance of the service, tlie courage, devotion, zeal and perseverance under circumstances calculated to discourage, which animated this little band of heroes, throughout the long, dangerous and tedious travel.\" Among many journeys of discovery by land which followed that of Lewis and Clark we select as the most interesting and typical tl:at of the Hunt party, which was the land division of the great Astor movement to estab- lish the Pacific Fur Company. That com- pany was established by John Jacob Astor for the purpose of making a bold and far-reach- ing attempt to control the vast fur trade of the Pacific coast in the interest of the L'nited States. The sea division set sail from X^ew York in 18 10 in the ship Tonquin. In the meantime ^^'ilson Price Hunt, the second part- HISTORY OF \\\\'ALLA WALLA COUNTY. 19 Tier in the concern, was at St. Louis organizing a land party, which was to cross the plains and co-operate with the division by sea. Hunt had \"been merchandising for some j'cars at St. Louis. His principal trade being with trappers and Indians, he had become very familiar with the recjuirements of the business. In addition to this primary requisite he possessed a character, native and acquired, worthy of more frequent mention in our early annals and of more fre- quent emulation by his associates and suc- cessors. Brave, humane, patient, cheerful and resolute, he rises from the mists of history and reminiscence as the highest type of the Jasons who vied with those of ancient story in their search for the fleeces (this time of seal and beaver instead of gold) of the far west. To a powerful physique and iron nerve Hunt added a refinement and culture rare indeed among the bold, free spirits of the frontier. In company with Hunt from the outset was another partner, Donald McKenzie by name. He was a man insensible of fear, inured by years of hardship to the ups and downs of the trapper's life, and renowned even on the border for his marvelous accuracy with the rifle. The first thing for them was to get their men. To do this all the tact and patience of Hunt were brought into full play. For a proper under- standing of his position it will be necessary to describe briefly the classes from whom he was obliged to fill his ranks. There were at this time two great classes ol trappers. The first and most numerous were the Canadian voyageurs. These men were mainly of French descent. IMany of them were half-breeds. They were the legacj- of the old French domination over Canada. Cradled in the canoe or batteau, their earliest remem- brance being the cold blue lake or foaming river, almost amphibious by nature and train- ing, gay and amiable in disposition, with true French vivacity and ingenuity, gilding every harsh and bitter experience with laugh and song, with their quick sympathies and humane instincts easily getting on the best side of the sa\\-ages, not broad in designing but not the less patient, courageous and indomitable in executing, these French voyageurs were the n:ain dependence of traffic in the wilderness. The second class were free trappers; Eooshaways they were sometimes called. These men were mainly Americans. Virginia and Kentucky were the original homes of many of them. They were the perfect antipodes of the voyageurs. Often with gigantic frames built up on prairie dew and mountain breeze, with bufi^alo steak and wild birds' flesh wrought into their iron sinews ; with nerves of steel, on which it seemed might harmlessly play even the lightnings of Missouri storms, the drift- ing snows of winter but a downy coverlid to them, and the furnace blasts of summer but balmy zephyrs ; gorging themselves in the midst of plenty, but mocking the power of hunger and thirst when in want ; mighty braggarts, 3'et quick as lightning to make good their boasts; patient and indefatigable in their work of trap- ping, but when on their annual trips to the towns given to wild dissipations and savage rcvelings, \"sudden and rash in quarrel,\" care- less of each other's sympathy or company; harsh and cruel to the Indians wlien in power over them, but bold and recklessly defiant when weaker than they ; seizing without compunction the prettiest Indian women and the best horses as their rightful booty; with blood always in th.eir eyes, thunder in their voices, and pistols in. their hands, yet underneath it all many of thicm having hearts as big as buffaloes, could they but be reached, — this now vanished race of Eooshaways has gone to a place in histor}- be- HISTORY OF WALLA WALLA COUNTY. side the old Spartans, whose greatest boast u was that the city had no walls, their army being the wall and every man therein a brick, or beside the Spanish conquerors of Mexico and Peru, like Orellana, who descended the Amazon on a raft and then put to sea with such a climax of audacity that even the stormy Atlantic was frightened into acquiescence and let him pass in safety. This old streak of brutality and tyranny, originally cast into the Anglo-Saxon nature and manifested in its best form in the savage grandeur of the Norse Valhalla, and in the overpowering energy of the Vikings, and at every emergency breaking with volcanic fury tlirough the thin crust of modern culture, has shown itself in no way more notably than in the whole Lidian management of the American Government. These free trappers executed with a vengeance the unspoken, but not less real, policy of our government. Humanity, and even shrewd policy, had little place in the thoughts and actions of most of them. The Indians were simply to be stamped on like so many rattlesnakes. In the trapper's code, for an Indian to look longingly at a white man's horse, or even to be seen in the vicinity of a beaver trap, was sufficient warrant to send a rifle ball ploughing its way through his heart. The Gallic gentleness and sociabilitv which enabled the Canadian voyageurs to go almost anywhere imharmed among the Indians, found no counterpart in the sterner composition of the great majority of American trappers and traders. Such were the men from whom Hunt had to make up his little army, and a vexatious job it was, too. The rivalries of opposing companies were the opportunity of the trappers. Big wages were demanded. Old whisky bills had to be paid off. The clutch of the sheriff had to be loosened by the golden lever of wages in advance. Worst of all, Hunt found at nearly every station where he tried to engage men that the agents of the Missouri Fur Com- pany, chief of whom was a Spaniard named flannel Lisa, were neutralizing his efforts by representing the dangers from the hostile tribes and barren wastes intervening between the ^Missouri plains and the Pacific. But Hunt's patience and perseverance, backed by Astor's unstinted purse, overcame all obstacles, and in April, 1811, the winter rendezvous at the mouth of the Nodowa (four hundred and eighty miles above St. Louis) was abandoned, and in four boats, one of large size, and mount- ing a swivel and two howitzers, the party of sixty set forth up the almost untraveled Mis- souri. Of the party five were partners. Hunt, Crooks, McKenzie, Miller and McLellan. One was a clerk, Reed by name. There were two English naturalists, Bradbury and Nuttall. Forty of the party were Canadian voyageurs. They were to do the rowing, transporting, carrying, cooking, and all the drudgery in gen- eral. The remainder were American hunters and trappers. These were the fellows to hunt and fight and plan and explore, and, when the proper place was reached, to cast themselves upon the mercy of the savages and wild beasts, endure hunger and thirst and establish trading- posts. The chief of these hunters was a Vir- ginian named John Day. \\\\'e shall meet him frequently. The party was in all respects most bountifully ec]uipped. They designed following as nearly as possible the route of Lewis and Clark. Many interesting and some thrilling and exciting scenes were encountered on the pas- sage up the ^Missouri, especially on their way through the country of the Sioux Tetons. But thev met with no serious hindrance, and on HISTORY OF WALLA WALLA COUNTY. the nth of June they reached a large village of the Arickaras, fourteen hundred and thirty- miles above the mouth of the JMissouri. It had been determined before this, on the advice of several hunters who joined the party in the wilderness, after they had left the Nodowa, to abandon their canoes at this point and, se- curing horses, strike across the country south of Lewis and Clark's route, so as to avoid the dreadful Blackfeet, who, alike the terror of the other Indians as well as of the whites, dominated all the region of the upper Mis- souri. So with eighty-two horses heavily loaded — the partners only, together with the family of Pierre Dorion, being mounted — on the 1 8th of July they set out hopefully, though with many gloomy prognostications from trappers remaining at the Arickara village, on their march across the Great American Des- ert and through the volcanic defiles of the great divide. On the wide monotony of the sky-bordered prairie they seemed to make no progress. Day succeeded day, and every morning's sun shot up, hot and dry, on apparently the very land- scape of the day before. They did not seem in fact, though taking a more direct route, to make so good time as did Lewis and Clark. Guided by the Crow Indians, they penetrated range after range of the stepping stones to the final ridge, supposing each to be the last, only to find when it was surmounted that one yet higher succeeded, and at last on the 15th of September — the summer already gone — they mounted a lofty peak whence the bound- less wilderness over which they had come as well as that which they must yet traverse, lay like a map at their feet. Gazing attentively westward their guide finally pointed out three shining peaks ridging the western sky, whose bases he assured them were washed by a trib- utary of the Columbia. These peaks are now known as the Tetons from their peculiar shape. A Inmdred miles evidently lay between the weary travelers and that goal. When there, they felt that the}- would be almost at the end of their journey, little realizing the character of the thousand miles of travel yet awaiting them. Passing the green banks of Spanish river, a tributar}' of the Colorado, they laid in a large stock of the plentiful buffalo, gave their horses five days' rest and grazing on the abundant grass, and on the 24th of September, crossing a narrow ridge, found themselves on the banks of a turbulent stream, recognized by their guide as one of the sources of the Snake. From the name of the guide the stream was called Hoback's river. Down the rugged promontories which flanked this stream the party descended, often in danger of fatal falls, to its junction with a much larger one, which so much exceeded the first in fury of current as to receive the name of Mad ri\\'er. This seemed to issue from the midst of the Tetons, whose glacial and snowy immensity overtopped the camp of the trav- elers at the junction of the two streams. The all important C|uestion now arose, should they abandon the horses and make canoes with which to descend the river. It was evident that, though containing abundant water for large boats, it was so impetuous as to render navigating a dangerous business. But the Canadians insisted on making the attempt. ^Veary of the toilsome and rocky foot-paths of the mountains, and having all confidence in their well-tried ability in handling boats in any kind of water, they longed to betake them- selves once more to their favorite element, and, paddle in hand, their gay French songs beating time to the music of the paddles, they HISTORY OF WALLA WALLA COUNTY. would be ready to shoot another Niagara, if it came in their way. The partners finally gave their consent to make canoes. Forthwith the voyageurs repaired with joyful hearts to the adjacent woods, which soon began to yield up its best timber for the projected boats. JNIeanwhile a party of three, of whom the re- doubtable John Day was one, went down Mad river on a two days' journey. They returned declaring that neither in boats nor with horses along the banks could the party possibly go. Disappointed in this plan they now took the advice of Hoback to go to a trapping post Avhich had been established the year before by Mr. Henry, of the Missouri Fur Company. This post Hoback knew to be on one of the tipper waters of the Snake and he thought that it cuuld not be far distant. A violent storm of sleet, arising in the midst of their deliberations, admonished them that winter was near at hand and that they must hasten on one way or the other. The Snake Lidians who had come to their camp before tlie storm and had professed to know the location of Henry's post, now agreed to guide them thither. Accordingly on the 4th of October, the hills all around being spotted with snow, they resumed their horse'jack march. Four days of cold and difficult journeying took them to a cluster of deserted log huts. This had been Henry's trading station, but was now entirely abandoned. Beside the huts flowed a beautiful river a hundred yards wide. It was to all appearance a fine navigable stream. Two weeks of industrious work pro- Added fifteen canoes, and in these, hastily em- barking, they pushed out into the stream. Their horses were left in charge of the two Snake Lidians. Nine men also, including Miller, one of the partners, had been detached irom the party at points between Mad river and Henry's river, as the new stream was called. These men were to divide up in squads and trap on the streams thereabout. Well pro- vided Avith traps, clothes, horses and ammuni- tion, they set out cheerfully into the unknown and wintry recesses of the mountins, expect- ing to issue thence in the spring with a great stock of valuable peltries. With these they could make their best way to Astoria. \\Mth the rapid current aiding the skillful paddles of the voyageurs, Avhose spirits rose to an unwonted height, even for them, as soon as they found themselves on the water, the canoes swept swiftly on toward the sunset. They soon came to the mouth of a stream which they took to be their old friend, the ]\\Iad river. They now considered themselves fairly embarked on the main body of the Snake, and already, in imagination, they began to toss on the \\-ast current of the Columbia, and even to smell the salt breeze of the mild Pacific. Oc- casional rocky points abutting on the river made rapids which alternated with calm stretches of water, whose banks, shallow and grassy, were enlivened with perfect clouds of wild geese and ducks. For nine days they swept gaily on, with comparatively slight in- terruptions, making over three hundred miles- from the place where they had first embarked. Then they met with a most lamentable dis- aster. Li the second canoe of the squadron were Air. Crooks as bowman and Antoine Clappine as steersman. The first canoe hav- ing safely passed a dangerous rapid, the sec- 'ond essayed to follow. \\\\'ith a sudden lurch she missed her course and the next instant split upon a rock. Crooks and three of his companions succeeded, after a hard struggle, in reaching the land, but Clappine, one of the most popular and useful men in the company, was lost amid the boiling surges. Thev had HISTORY OF WALLA WALLA COUNTY. 2 J, now arrived at an unboatable chain of rapids and frightful bhiffs, among which neither boats nor horses, nothing, in sliort, but wings, were of use. At the beginning of this strait was one of those volcanic cracks peculiar to the rivers of this coast, in which the whole volume of the Snake is squeezed into a place thirty feet wide. This miniature maelstrom received from the disheartened voyagers the name of \"The Caldron Linn.\" The whole squadron now came to a halt. It was evident that a portage at least would be needed.
