DONOVAN BIOGRAPHICAL JOHN JOSEPH DONOVAN. There are times when human effort and enterprise seem to have no limit, when the door of opportunity continuously opens to the insistent demands of the individual and when ability finds its justification and reaps its reward in notable success. Such has been the record of John Joseph Donovan, whose work has been a vital force in the development and upbuilding of the northwest. He has directed and controlled affairs of great magnitude, in many of which the public has been a large indirect beneficiary, while at the same time his fortunes have enjoyed a just increase. Mr. Donovan seems to think there is nothing unusual in his life record, but when judged by what the great majority of men accomplish his history stands out as a notable example of the force of perse- verance, determination, clear vision and sound judgment. Mr. Donovan was born at Rumney, New Hampshire, September 8, 1858, his parents being Patrick and Julia ( O'Sullivan) Donovan, the former a native of County Cork, Ireland, and the latter of County Kerry. The educational op- portunities of the father were limited, but laudable ambition prompted him to try his fortune in the new world and in 1852 he arrived in the United States, after which he secured a position in connection with the building of the Boston, Concord & ^Montreal Railroad in New Hampshire. His ability soon won him promotion to foreman and with his savings he afterward purchased a farm near Plymouth, New Hampshire, where he carried on general agricultural pursuits until he permanently put aside business cares and took up his abode in the town of Plymouth, where he passed away. It was in July, 1856, in Concord, New Hampshire, that he wedded Miss Julia O'Sullivan, and to them were born seven children: John Joseph: Katharine, who is now living in Plymouth; Dennis, who died in infancy; Mary Agnes, who became the wife of George Lynch, of Lan- caster, New Hampshire, but both are now deceased; Julia Teresa, the wife of Hon. F. F. Blake, of Plymouth, New Hampshire, who served in the legislature of his state; Daniel P., who was general agent for the Northwestern Life Insur- ance Company of Milwaukee at Boston and died in 191 1; and Margaret, the wife of A. N. Gilbert, of Berlin, New Hampshire, who was formerly mayor of his city and is now an architect and building contractor doing business in Massa- chusetts and New Hampshire. The boyhood and youth of John J. Donovan passed without any unusual incident, his attention being given to farm work, to the acquirement of an edu- 5 6 WASHINGTON, WEST OF THE CASCADES cation and to the enjoyment of such sports as occupied the attention of the youths of his locality. He supplemented his public school course by study in the New Hampshire State Normal School, from which he was graduated, and then devoted three years to teaching in the schools of New Hampshire and Massa- chusetts. The funds thus secured enabled him to carry out his well defined pur- pose, that of pursuing a course in engineering in the Polytechnic School at Worcester, Massachusetts, and in 1880 he entered that institution, from which he was graduated with valedictorian honors in a class of thirty-one in 1882. The ambition which prompted him to take high rank in his class foreshadowed the spirit which has actuated him in all of his undertakings. He has never been content with the second best but has striven for the attainment of perfection in all that he has attempted. About the time of his graduation the Northern Pacific Railway Company was completing its transcontinental system and applied to the engineering school at Worcester, Massachusetts, to engage two members of the graduating class for engineering work along its line. The two chosen were John J. Donovan and J. Q. Barlow, the latter having also risen to eminence in railway and engineering circles, being assistant chief engineer of the Southern Pacific Railway. Going at once to Montana, they were given employment in adjacent fields, Mr. Donovan's first duties being those of rodman of a surveying crew far in advance of the western terminus. After a month he was made lev- eler, while six months' service brought to him the position of assistant engineer of construction. He celebrated his twenty-fifth birthday by attending the impos- ing and impressive ceremonies which were arranged by Henry Villard, presi- dent of the Northern Pacific Railway Company, in honor of the completion of the road by connection of the eastern and western divisions at Gold Creek, Montana, on which occasion Mr. Villard's guests were taken to Gold Creek in five Pullman trains and included such distinguished personages as President Ulysses S. Grant, William M. Evarts, English and German noblemen who were financially interested in the Northern Pacific, eminent engineers and railway officials, a number of Crow Indian chieftains, cattlemen of the neighboring ranches, several companies of United States soldiers and the usual corps of newspaper correspondents. All night long Mr. Donovan rode over lonely trails to reach Gold Creek and he remembers the ceremonies on that occasion as among the most impressive he has ever witnessed. He then returned to camp and when he had completed some important truss bridge work was transferred to Wash- ington, where his duties connected him with the construction of the Cascade division of the Northern Pacific as engineer of track and bridges, locating engineer and engineer in charge. His first work was about fifteen miles east of the present town of Prosser and later as one of the engineers on the Cascade tunnel project he ran surveys for that great bore, crossing the mountains almost daily throughout the winter when twenty feet of snow lay upon their summits. He rode in the saddle on the trails but had to cross the summit on snowshoes. On the ist of June, 1887, the zigzag track of the switchback, which invariably precedes the tunnel on large projects, was completed, so that the Northern Pa- cific could take people to the coast over its own lines. At that time Mr. Donovan was engineer in charge of the Cascade division west. A month later when granted a vacation he visited Alaska and also his old New England home, but WASHINGTON, WEST OF THE CASCADES 7 in September, 1887, returned to the west to take charge of the construction of a number of Hnes then being built by the Northern Pacific to connect important mining camps with the main line in Montana. Upon the completion of that work in 1888 he again went to New England and when he returned to Helena, Montana, in the same year he was accompanied by his bride. Mr. Donovan's value in professional connections was recognized by others aside from the Northern Pacific officials and various business propositions were made him, so that he finally resigned his position with the railroad company to accept the office of chief engineer for important enterprises then being estab- lished on Bellingham bay. From Helena he went to Tacoma and in December, 1888, arrived at Fairhaven, which later became a part of Bellingham. There were no stores in the town, merely a little cluster of dwellings in the midst of dense forests, and the total population of Bellingham bay was not more than five hundred, including men, women and children. One traveled from Fair- haven to Whatcom by the water route, using a rowboat, for the road between the two places was impassable. Under the direction of Mr. Donovan as chief engineer the companies with which he was associated soon wrought marked changes, his being the directing force in all of this important work. As chief engineer of the Fairhaven Land Company, the Skagit Coal & Transportation Company and the Fairhaven & Southern Railway Company he directed the building of a railroad, the opening of coal mines on the Skagit river, the plat- ting of the town site of Fairhaven and the construction of its wharves. Fair- haven was organized as a city and public improvements of importance were inaugurated and carried to completion. At this time he served on the city coun- cil for two terms, being chairman of the street and sewer committee. Another important progressive step was made in 1890, when the Fairhaven & Southern Railway Company projected a line from Vancouver, British Columbia, south to Portland, Oregon, and east to Spokane. The surveys were completed and eighty miles of the road had been constructed and was under operation when the com- pany sold out to the Great Northern system and Mr. Donovan retired as chief engineer. Once more he visited the Atlantic coast and upon his return to the west became engineer for the tide land appraisers and afterward chief engineer of the Blue Canyon Coal Mining Company and the Bellingham Bay & Eastern Railway Company, formed by Montana capital in 1891. The railway company gradually extended its lines from Fairhaven to Wickersham on the Northern Pacific by way of Lake Whatcom and in 1902 the Northern Pacific took over the road. In 1898 Mr. Donovan was made general superintendent and chief engi- neer of the Bellingham Bay & British Columbia Railway and immediately began the survey work for the extension of the line to Spokane. The companies under Mr. Donovan's direction devoted much time and capital to prospecting for coal and other minerals and to developing valuable water power on the Nooksack at Nooksack Falls. The water power was later sold to Stone & Webster, of Boston, Mr. Donovan making a special trip to the east to negotiate the deal. The Blue Canyon coal mines were leased to another company and the property is now being gradually developed. In 1898 Peter Larson, Julius H. Bloedel and Mr. Donovan organized the Lake Whatcom Logging Company, of which Mr. Larson became president, Mr. 8 WASHINGTON, WEST OF THE CASCADES Donovan vice president and Mr. Bloedel manager. In 1900 they also organized the Larson Lumber Company and built a mill at the town of Larson on Lake Whatcom, the latter company having the same officers as the former. At the time of the organization Mr. Donovan became president of the Lake Whatcom Logging Company and on the ist of April, 1913, that company and the Larson Lumber Company reorganized and Mr. Bloedel became president with Mr. Donovan as vice president. This company now owns three sawmills, one in Bellingham and two at Larson, and they also have two shingle mills at Larson and one at Blanchard, Washington. Their properties also include logging camps with five units or sides at Alger and Delvan respectively. They operate thirty miles of railroad, own six locomotives and complete rolling stock. The company has acquired timber lands in Skagit and Whatcom counties which include twelve hundred million feet of timber all at moderate elevation, while all is in solid blocks. This timber has all been acquired through purchase from one hundred different owners and none of it from the government, railroad companies or by filing scrip. They employ directly one thousand people. Aside from his extensive interests along that line i\\Ir. Donovan is vice president of the First National Bank of Bellingham. In Somerville, Massachusetts, April 29, 1888, Mr. Donovan was united in marriage to Miss Clara Isabel Nichols and they have become the parents of three children. Helen Elizabeth, the eldest, is a graduate of Dana Hall, Welles- ley, Massachusetts, and also of Smith College and was studying music in Ber- lin, Germany, at the time of the outbreak of the present war. John Nichols, twenty-five years of age, graduated in civil engineering from the Worcester Polytechnic Institute in 1913 and was a civil engineer with the Northern Pacific Railroad Company for a year. He is now efficiency engineer for the Bloedel Donovan Lumber Mills at Bellingham, Washington. He was married in Belling- ham in September, 1914, to Miss Geraldine Goodheart, and John N. Jr., born May 12, 1916, is the pride of the family. Philip, twenty-three years of age, completed a course in mechanical engineering at the Worcester Polytechnic Institute in 191 5 and is now active as his father's secretary and purchasing agent. In July, 1916, he married Miss Hazel Hart Prigmore, daughter of the late Judge Prigmore of Seattle and on May 23, 1917, Philip Hart entered their home. Mr. Donovan is a member of the Catholic church and is now president of the Catholic Federation of Washington. He has also taken the fourth degree in the Knights of Columbus and has held high offices in the order. He is prom- inently identified with many club and trade societies and organizations for the benefit of the public. His standing in business circles is indicated by the fact that he was honored with the presidency of the Pacific Logging Congress from 191 3 until 1915. Several times he has been president of the Chamber of Com- merce of Bellingham and he belongs to the Commercial Club of Tacoma, the American Historical Society and the American Irish Historical Society. That he casts his influence in support of cultural forces is indicated by his member- ship in the Washington State Art Association. He is likewise a life member of the Navy League and he has membership in the Bellingham Country Club, the Cougar Club of Bellingham and the Rainier Club of Seattle. He is a mem- WASHINGTON, WEST OF THE CASCADES 9 ber of the American Society of Civil Engineers and was one of the organizers of the Montana Society of Engineers, with which he is still connected. He has long been an ardent advocate of the good roads movement and was a leader in the fight for fortifications for Bellingham bay. He is a forceful writer and a frequent contributor of timely articles on vital subjects to the press. Belling- ham has no citizen who has been more keenly alive to the city's needs and possi- bilities or who has persisted with greater energy and success in attaining them. In politics Mr. Donovan is a stanch republican and has been a recognized leader in political circles in his part of the state. He would never consent to become an ofiice holder, yet it would have been possible for him to secure almost any position that he might desire, so great is the confidence reposed in his ability and public spirit. He was chairman of the state commission of forest legisla- tion under Governor Hay, which commission was characterized as \"twelve of the strong men of the state.\" Under appointment of Governor McGraw in 1894 he was a member of the first state highway commission, for which he has since been a worker, striving earnestly to promote good roads. He was also on the state board of charities and corrections for some years. He has given most lib- erally of his time and money to hospital work and he served in an advisory capacity in connection with St. Joseph's Hospital of Bellingham for years. He instituted progressive and humanitarian ideas in connection with his mills and camps which have been generally adopted by other big companies. Small reduc- tions in the men's pay guaranteed them medical attention and hospital service when needed and gave them a choice of hospitals — St. Joseph's or St. Luke's — and any surgeon or physician they might select. For eight years he was a trustee of the State Normal School and he was a member of the charter com- mission of fifteen which framed the charter of the city of Bellingham when Fairhaven and Whatcom united. This charter proved so satisfactory that later the people rejected the idea of a commission form of government, deeming the old charter to be more efficient and up-to-date. Mr. Donovan was also a mem- ber of the Municipal League for Civic Reforms and he has always been on the side of temperance, serving on the executive committee in the fight for prohibi- tion. Bellingham was one of the first cities of the state to go dry by men's votes and it remained consistently dry through all reactions and was dry for six years before the state prohibition law was passed. Bellingham therefore had no trouble in applying the statewide law. In a summary of his life it is noticeable that Mr. Donovan as a man is far- seeing, honest and public-spirited and throughout his life has operated boldly and continuously in the business field and by the stimulus of his efforts has aroused the enterprise of others, through which means he has added to his own great labors and furnished hundreds of workmen with remunerative em- ployment. He has never been a public man in the ordinary sense but during all his business life he has held many important relations to the public interest through the business concerns he has conducted, for in all of them the public has been a large indirect beneficiary. He has never sought to figure promi- nently before the public in any light or any relation, yet his influence has been felt as a strong, steady moving force in the social, moral and industrial move- ments of the community rather than seen. There is one point in his career to 10 WASHINGTON, WEST OF THE CASCADES which his many friends refer with pride and that is, whether as a prominent lumberman or financier, he has always been the same genial, courteous gentle- man whose ways are those of refinement and whose word no man can question. HARRY CLAY HEERMANS. Among the builders of a great empire in the Pacific northwest is Harry Clay Heermans, who has been a potent factor in the development of Hoquiam, Olympia, Raymond and other sections of western Washington. Forceful and resourceful, he accomplishes what he undertakes and at all times the public has been a direct beneficiary because his activities have been of a character that have had to do with the general improvement of this section of the country. He was born in Fellowsville, Preston county, West Virginia, June 3, 1852, a son of John and Nancy Heermans, who were natives of Luzerne county, Pennsylvania. The name of Heer- mans is of Dutch origin and the ancestors, leaving their native Holland, eriiigrated in 1657 to New Amsterdam, now New York city. The family records are found in the books of the old Dutch church. In the maternal line H. C Heermans comes of English ancestry. Liberally educated, he was graduated at the Wesleyan Uni- versity at Middletown, Connecticut, in 1875 with the Bachelor of Arts degree, and the Master of Arts degree was conferred upon him in 1878. Thinking to make the practice of law his life work, he began reading in the office of Brown & Hadden of Corning, New York, but after a time turned to the engineering profession and for thirteen years acceptably filled the responsible position of city engineer in Corning. He next purchased the waterworks system of that city and managed the same as its owner for thirty years prior to 1908. During that period he also engaged extensively in real estate dealing at Corning and in 1886 formed the Ontario Land Company, with headquarters in St. Paul, Minnesota. In 1889 he arrived in Hoquiam and made large investments for the Ontario Land Company and eastern capitalists, and at once allying his interests with those of the city and its future development, he constructed in 1889 an electric light plant in Hoquiam. From that point forward he has been one of the most active factors in the develop- ment of business interests which have had marked effect upon the welfare and progress of the community. In 1898 he was the active agent in securing the exten- sion of the Northern Pacific Railway into Hoquiam and constructed the Hoquiam waterworks as well as secured the establishment of several new industries in the city. Something of the breadth, scope and importance of his activities through the intervening years is indicated in the fact that at the present time, 1916, he is presi- dent and manager of the Hoquiam Water Company, president of the East Hoquiam Company, president of the Grays Harbor Company, president of the Ontario Land Company and vice president of the Harbor Land Company. With the exception of the first named, all these companies are operating in real estate. In 1905 he purchased the controlling interest in the Olympia Waterworks at Olympia, Wash- ington, and remained at the head of the system until 191 6, when he sold out to the city. He also has been president of the Raymond Land & Improvement Company since 1905. promoting the town site of Raymond, W^ashington, and he is a director of the First National Bank of Hoquiam. It was in 1908 that he removed from HARRY C. HEERMANS •HE NEW YORK PUBLIC UBRAHY ASTOii, LENOX _l^ffEN FOUNDATION WASHINGTON, WEST OF THE CASCADES 13 Corning, New York, to Hoqtiiam and in 1909 he established his home in Olympia but has devoted most of the time to the development of Hoquiam since 1898. On the 17th of March, 1886, at Painted Post, New York, Mr. Heermans was united in marriage to Miss Annie L. Townsend, a daughter of E. E. Townsend, of Erwin, Steuben county. New York, and a great-granddaughter of Colonel E. E. Erwin of Revolutionary war fame, who was the original pioneer and owner of the town of Erwin. Mr. and Mrs. Heermans have become parents of four children: Ruth, the wife of Milton J. Beaty, now residing in Warren, Pennsylvania; Joseph F., who was graduated with the class of 1916 from the University of Washington and Jerome T. and Donald, students in that school. The parents are members of the Presbyterian church and Mr. Heermans belongs to the Benevolent Protective Order of Elks at Hoquiam. His political allegiance is given to the republican party and with the vital questions and issues of the day he is thoroughly familiar, but he does not seek nor desire ofifice, pre- ferring to concentrate his energies upon his business affairs, which have been care- fully managed and wisely planned. He readily discriminates between the essential and the nonessential in business matters and Hoquiam and other sections of the state have profited largely by his cooperation in the work of promoting public progress. GEORGE FREDERICK FRYE. George Frederick Frye was one of the leading business men of Seattle and erected many buildings of iriiportance, including the Hotel Frye, which is con- ceded to be the finest hostelry in .the city. A native of Germany, he was born near Hanover, on the 15th of June, 1833. and his parents, Otto and Sophia (Pranga) Frye, were also natives of the fatherland. Their religious faith was that of the Lutheran church. In 1849, when sixteen years of age, George F. Frye emigrated to the United States and first located in Lafayette, Missouri, where he worked as a farm hand. In 1852 he worked his way across the plains to the Pacific coast with the Hays Company, which made the trip with ox teams. Fie spent one winter at Portland and was for some time in the employ of Hillory Butler, for whom the Hotel Butler was named. In 1853 he came to Seattle, which was then a small settle- ment on the Sound. In connection with Arthur A. Denny and H. L. Yesler, Mr. Frye built the first sawmill and the first grist mill in Seattle and for about ten years he was connected with milling interests. He established the first meat market in the city and also started a bakery. Later he turned his attention to steamboating and for four years was master of the J. B. Libby, one of the early Sound steamers. He was also mail agent, carrying the mail from Seattle to Whatcom on the Sameyami, making one trip a week. In 1884 he erected the Frye Opera House, which was the first place of the kind erected in Seattle, and as manager of the same secured good theatrical attractions for the city. In the fire of 1889 the building was destroyed and Mr. Frye later erected the Stevens Hotel on the site of the opera house. In connection with A. A. Denny he also owned the Northern Hotel, and he likewise erected the Barker Hotel. He also 14 WASHINGTON, WEST OF THE CASCADES built the Hotel Frye, in which the city takes justifiable pride. He personally supervised the construction of this eleven-story building and spared no expense nor effort in making it one of the best equipped and most complete hostelries of the northwest. In addition to his other activities he dealt extensively in real estate and was one of the wealthy men of Seattle. On the 25th of October, i860, Mr. Frye was married in Seattle to Miss Louisa C. Denny, a daughter of A. A. Denny, previously mentioned, who was one of the first settlers of Seattle and a man of great influence and high reputation. He was rightfully given the title of \"father of the town.\" To Mr. and Mrs. Frye were bom six children : James ^Marion, who died in 1905 ; Mary Louisa, the widow of Captain George H. Fortson; Sophia S., now Mrs. Daniel W. Bass; George Arthur, who died in 1892; Roberta G., now Mrs. P. H. Watt; and Eliza- beth, the wife of Virgil N. Bogue. Mr. Frye cast his ballot in support of the republican party and served accept- ably as a member of the city council. His religious allegiance was given to the Lutheran church and its teachings formed the guiding principles of his life. He was a man of great vigor and energy and was very active in business affairs. He aided in the development of many enterprises and among the other things he founded the first brass band in the city. He was one of the leaders among the early residents of the city and as Seattle developed his grasp of affairs seemed to grow accordingly, and he continued to occupy a position of importance in the life of his community. He almost reached the age of seventy-nine years, passing away on the 2d of May, 1912. HON. ALLEN WEIR. Hon. Allen Weir, of Olympia, was thoroughly western in spirit and inter- ests, his entire life having been passed on the Pacific coast, where through his business ability and public spirit he contributed in substantial measure to the wonderful development and progress of this section of the country. He was born in El Monte. Los Angeles county. California, April 24, 1854, and when six years of age was brought to Washington by his parents, who reached Port Townsend on the 28th of May, i860. He was a son of John and Saluda J. (Buchanan) Weir. The father, a native of Missouri, was at dift'erent times, a pioneer of that state, of Texas, of California and of the Puget Sound country. Removing to the Lone Star state, he there married Miss Buchanan and their three oldest children were born in Texas. In 1853 they started by wagon across the plains for southern California and were about a year in making the trip. The father engaged in blacksmithing and farming at Lexington, Los Angeles county, California, and in 1858 he made his way northward to Port Townsend and then to Dungeness, where two years later he was joined by his family. He settled two miles from the straits, where he took up government land and developed a farm, residing thereon until his demise. He cleared all his land, made all his own roads and also made the first plow in the county. He likewise built the first wagon in the county and he continued to engage in blacksmithing .as w^U as in general farming. He possessed expert mechanical ingenuity and WASHINGTON, WEST OF THE CASCADES 15 could make anything out of wood and iron. He lived to be sixty-three years of age and his wife, who survived him for about twelve years, had reached the age of seventy at the time of her demise. In their family were the following named: Marion, deceased; Mrs. Laura B. Troy, of Olympia; Mrs. Susan L. Evans, of Dungeness, Washington; Allen, of this review; Mrs. Martha J. Whit- tier, who has passed away ; and Julia, the widow of Charles Kennard, of Tacoma. Allen Weir attended school in Olympia but is largely a self-educated man and has gained many of his most valuable lessons in the school of experience. In 'his boyhood he was thrown in close relations with the Clallam Indians, who were numerous and often worked on his father's farm. Taking an interest in their language, he soon mastered it, and this ability to speak the Chinook language was of great value to him later in his legal practice as it enabled him to be his own interpreter. When nineteen years of age he started in business on his own account by renting land of his father, on which he engaged in the cultivation of crops and in raising hogs. He afterward spent two years in driving ox teams in logging camps but, desirous of improving his education, he then went to Olympia and spent two years in the Olympia Collegiate Institute, where Pro- fessor Royal took a great interest in him and assisted him as far as possible. While pursuing his studies Mr. Weir did his own cooking and worked as janitor of the building in order to pay his tuition. He kept ahead of his class, and left some time before his class was graduated, he having completed the course. It is a well known fact that it is under the stimulus of necessity and the pressure of adversity that the best and strongest in man are brought out and developed and Mr. Weir thus early displayed the elemental strength and force of his char- acter. Returning to Port Townsend, he purchased the Puget Sound Argus, a small weekly newspaper, which also did job work. About six months later, or in No- vember, 1877, he was married and his wife became his active assistant in the business. Together they built up the paper, largely increasing its circulation and its advertising patronage, and after twelve years they sold the business at a good profit. Not long after they began the publication of the paper a daily edi- tion was started. Mr. Weir had had no practical experience as a newspaper man but he applied himself thoroughly to learning the business and soon proved his capability therein. After disposing of the Argus the Commercial Club of Port Townsend ofiPered him ten thousand dollars if he would return and again enter the newspaper business there. He had served as secretary of the cham- ber of commerce and in both connections had much to do with the upbuilding of the town, the development of its interests and the exploitation of its resources. In fact he took an active part in shaping the history of the state in consider- able measure and in the spring of i88g was elected a member of the constitutional convention which met at Olympia. He took part in various debates of the convention and did much toward framing the organic law of the state. The same year he was nommated for secretary of state and was the first to hold that office after the admission of Washington to the Union. He proved a capable official but did not become a candidate for reelection. He had previously served as clerk in the upper house of the territorial legislature in 1887 ^\"d i'^ many ways he aided in forming public policy. He was a great friend of Governor Terry and many other distinguished statesmen of Washington and in their coun- 16 WASHINGTON, WEST OF THE CASCADES cils his opinions many times carried great weight. He was well fitted for leadership by reason of his keen mind and his natural oratorical powers, which had been developed while he was a member of a literary society in school. He became a pronounced advocate of the temperance cause and in this, as in every other public question, he studied every phase of the problem and his utterances were based upon thorough knowledge. For three terms he held the office of president of the Olympia Chamber of Commerce. After retiring from the ofiice of secretary of state he entered upon the practice of law in Olympia. having been admitted to the bar in 1892 upon examination before the United States supreme court, having the distinction of being the first one thus admitted. He was always alone in his law practice, which became extensive and of a very important character. He made a specialty of handling tide land litigation and is a recognized authority on tide land law. Years before when he was filling the office of justice of the peace at Port Townsend he rendered decisions in tide land cases which were accepted by the state courts and are still quoted in the trial of such cases. He continued actively in practice until Sep- tember, IQ15, when ill health forced his retirement. On the I2th of November, 1877, in Dungeness, Mr. Weir was married to Aliss Ellen Davis, a daughter of Hall Davis, who came from Ontario, Canada, in 1873 and was one of the leading dairymen of Washington. He developed a fine farm as well as a splendid dairy herd and his business afifairs were most wisely, carefully and successfully managed. While he made his home at Dun- geness his death occurred in Seattle. The surviving children of Mr. and Mrs. Weir are two sons and a daughter: Eva, who wedded \\\\'. R. ^^'hite. of Olympia, and has three children. Allen C, Elizabeth and ^lary-Ellen ; Frank A., who mar- ried Minnie Huwald and is now county engineer of Thurston county; and Royal F.. a lumberman of Hoquiam. Two other children died when young. Mr. Weir was long a devoted and faithful member of the Methodist Epis- copal church, in which he held every lay office. 'Sirs. Weir is also a member of that church. From 1877 until his death he was identified with the Ancient Order of United Workmen. The breadth of his interests is further indicated in the fact that he served as regent of the Territorial University. His political alle- giance was always unfalteringly given to the republican party. Before he was twenty-one years of age he was nominated by a democratic committee for a seat in the territorial legislature, but when the committee waited upon him to tell him of their choice he replied that he could not accept as he was a republican. He did much campaign work and in 1896 delivered campaign addresses throughout Washington, Oregon, Montana and Idaho. There is something stimulating in the life history of such a man. One responds to the story with a thrill, recognizing how successfully he battled with untoward circumstances and wrested fortune and prominence from the hands of fate. His expanding powers brought him prominently before the public and his history proves that merit and ability will come to the front. Prompted by a laudable ambition to be something more than a common laborer and realiz- ing that the fundamental step toward this end was the acquirement of an edu- cation, he developed the studious habits which remained his through life and which made him the peer of the ablest men of the northwest. In September, 191 5. he suffered a stroke of paralysis, from which, however WASHINGTON, WEST OF THE CASCADES 17 he almost completely recovered. On the 17th of August, 1916, while he and his wife were visiting at Port Townsend they took a drive with S. Troy and from some unknown cause the car ran off the dock into the strait. Mr. Troy was killed instantly, Mrs. Weir was thrown clear of the car and escaped with bruises and Mr. Weir received such a severe shock and was so bruised that he began to fail rapidly in health and passed away on the 31st of October, 1916, at the hospital in Port Townsend. Mrs. Weir has since lived in Olympia at the home of her daughter, Mrs. W^hite. JONATHAN JAMES BISHOP. Prominent among Jefferson county's native sons is Jonathan James Bishop, now serving as county clerk. He was born in Chimacum, May 9, 1870, and is a son of William and Hannah (Hutchinson) Bishop, natives of England and Scotland respectively. In early life the father joined the English navy and served in the Crimean war. On one of his trips to America he resigned on reaching Victoria and in 1855 became a resident of Washington, where he fol- lowed farming to 1890, when he retired. Here he died in 1906, at the age of seventy-two years. The mother of our subject was reared and educated in Scotland and Ireland and she, too, became an early settler of Washington, being married in Chimacum, January 14, 1868. She passed away in 1902, at the age of sixty-five years. In the family were seven children, namely: Thomas G. ; William; Mrs. Elizabeth A'an Trojen, deceased; A. A.; Jonathan James; Anna M. Hinde; and Amelia Bugge. During his boyhood Jonathan James Bishop attended the public schools of Chimacum, pursuing his studied under one teacher for ten years. He then worked on a ranch for several years and afterward pursued a normal course at Coupeville, Washington, graduating in 1892. The following year was de- voted to teaching in Chimacum and at the end of that time he entered the law department of the University of Michigan, from which he was graduated with the LL.B. degree in 1895. Returning to Washington, he located at Port Town- send, where he was engaged in practice for a short time but in 1914 was elected county clerk and has since filled that office with credit to himself and to the entire satisfaction of his constituents. On the 2ist of September, 1896, near Ladner, British Columbia, Mr. Bishop was united in marriage to Miss Pauline J. Chase, a daughter of John and Mary E. (Haskins) Chase, who at one time were well known citzens of Coupeville, Washington. The father is now deceased, but the mother is still living and makes her home with Mr. and Mrs. Bishop. Our subject and his wife have six children, namely: Florence, born in Port Townsend, June 8, 1897; Maizie, who was born September 15, 1899, and is now attending the State School for Defective Youth at Medical Lake; Prentiss C, who was born January 13, 1902, and is attending high school in Port Townsend; Myron J., born August 2, 1905, and Wilbert R., born July 30, 1910, both in school at Port Townsend; and Vinton Chase, born November 3, 1916. Mr. Bishop is probably one of the best known county ofiicials in Jefferson 18 WASHINGTON, WEST OF THE CASCADES county and he enjoys the confidence and respect of the entire community. He has filled the office of notary public and by his ballot always supports the men and measures of the rejniblican party. He is a member of the Native Sons of Washington, the Woodmen of the World and the Women of Woodcraft. FRANCIS W. BROOKS. Francis W. Brooks was born in Burlington, Iowa, March 27, 1862, the son of Francis W. Brooks, a native of New York, who went to Iowa in 1840, established the first bank in that state at Burlington and there continued in the banking business up to the time of his death in 1869. Francis W. Brooks, Sr., was married to Harriet C. Beach, a native of New York. She died in Burlington in her seventy-sixth year in 1910. Francis W. Brooks, the son, was educated at Lawrenceville and in 1879 entered the employ of the Union National Bank of Chicago. He later removed to Aberdeen, South Dakota, where he was associated with J. Q. A. Braden and John T. McChesney in the Brown County Bank and later was cashier of the Aberdeen National Bank. In 1900 Mr. Brooks removed to Everett where, in connection with Messrs. Tenant and Bickelhaupt, he built the Everett Flour Mill and was actively identi- fied in the management and operation of this plant for two years, until its sale to other interests. He then entered the American National Bank, and later the Everett Trust & Savings Bank, in which he held the position of Cashier from its inception up to the time of his death. August 2'j, 1916. He was a courteous and obliging official and his comprehensive knowledge of the banking business and his marked ability in this direction contributed in a large measure to the success of the institution. In 1887 in Burlington, Iowa. Mr. Brooks was married to Miss Jessie L. Hay- Jen, daughter of William F. and Susan Hayden, who were early settlers in Bur- lington. He was treasurer of the Everett Golf and Countr}^ Club and president of the Cascade Club. He is survived by his widow and one daughter, Mrs. Don- ald C. Barnes. OLAF CARLSON. Olaf Carlson, president of the C-B Lumber & Shingle Company and a director of the Citizens Bank & Trust Company of Everett, was born in Gottenburg. Sweden, on the 30th of November, i860. His father. Carl Elis Anderson, also a native of that country, was a sea captain throughout his entire life and passed away in Sweden in 1870, at the age of forty-eight years. The mother, Mrs. Justina Anderson, died in Sweden about 1880. Of the six children of the family one passed away in infancy, while three are yet living. Olaf Carlson, who was the fourth in order of birth, pursued his education in the schools of his native country to the age of eighteen years and in 1881 WASHINGTON, WEST OF THE CASCADES 19 came to the new world, making his way at once to Portland, Oregon, where he arrived with a cash capital of eighty dollars, but this was stolen from him in a hotel during his first week's stay there. He secured employment at gardening for C. A. Prescott at a wage of twenty-five dollars per month and board. His residence in Washington dates from the spring of 1887, at which time he located in Tacoma, where with his two brothers, August and David Carlson, and his two cousins, Andrew Johnson and Carl Johnson, he entered the sawmill busi- ness, which they successfully conducted for ten years and at the same time engaged in the manufacture of shingles. Later Olaf Carlson purchased a half interest in the Young Lumber Company, shingle manufacturers of Tacoma, at which time the name was changed to Carlson Brothers. After the destruction of the plant by fire they erected the first upright shingle mill on the coast and they were obliged to send to California to secure men experienced in the opera- tion of such a mill. Theirs was also the first mill to operate without a knee bolter, cutting the raw timber, which method is now universal. In Tacoma they built a large lumber mill, cutting eighty thousand feet per day. After conduct- ing that mill for four years they sold out and the Carlson Brothers became connected with E. G. McNeely & Company of Tacoma in the operation of their plant at Everett. After two years the business was burned down, at the end of which time Mr. Carlson purchased the interest of Mr. McNeely in the business and established an upright shingle mill on the old property. This he continued to operate until 191 2, when he sold the plant to the Shull Lumber Company. He then took a trip to Europe, visiting his old home and the principal countries on the continent. Upon his return to the new world he became associated with lumber inter- ests as the head of the C-B Lumber & Shingle Company, Incorporated, at Everett, of which he is the president, with W. R. Cunningham, Jr., as vice president and George A. Bergstrom as secretary and treasurer. The business was originally established in 1909 south of Monroe, on the Snocjualmie river, by his two part- ners, who engaged in the manufacture of shingles under the name of the C-B Shingle Company, Incorporated. The plant embraced a six-machine mill and employment was originally given to thirty people, while the average output was two hundred and twenty-five thousand feet per day. The business was con- ducted at Monroe until 1914, when the company was reorganized and a removal was made to Everett, a location being secured on the tide flats at Ninth and Bayside. The capacity was increased to a ten-machine mill, with an output of four hundred thousand feet, and Mr. Carlson became identified with the new organization, of which he was elected president. This was the first completely electrically driven shingle mill in the world. The present plant covers twenty acres and employment is furnished to forty-five men, while the manufactured product is being shipped to all parts of the world. Another important feature of the plant and one which is the company's own design is a blower system, resulting in the separation of the fine and coarse dust and thereby increasing the efficiency of the men. In fact theirs is the most modern mill equipment of the kind in the world. The machinery is of the very latest design, embracing all of the most modern improvements, their business largely setting the standard of progressiveness in their field. Mr. Bergstrom, who is the secretary and treas- urer, is also president of the Mukilteo Shingle Company, located at Mukilteo, 20 WASHINGTON, WEST OF THE CASCADES Washington, having a six-machine plant, and he is the secretary and treasurer of the Pacific Timber Company of Everett, Washington. It will thus be seen that the partners are men of broad experience and extensive business connec- tions. In addition to his lumber interests Mr. Carlson is a director of the Citizens Bank & Trust Company of Everett. On the 13th of June, 1891, in Tacoma, Mr. Carlson was married to Miss Ellen Caroline Nelson, a native of Sweden and a daughter of Gust Nelson. Their five children are: Edward W., who is associated with the C-B Lumber & Shin- gle Company as stenographer ; Nettie E. ; Esther Alma ; Evelyn, and Julia C. The family residence at No. 1722 Rucker avenue is one of the finest homes in :he city and stands on the best improved block in Everett. Politically ]\\Ir. Carlson is a republican where national issues are involved but casts an independent local ballot. In 191 1 he was elected a member of the city council, but six months later the commission form of government w^as voted in and thus his term was brought to a close. He belongs to the Commercial Club and is at all times in sympathy with its progressive movements for the upbuilding of the city, the extension of its trade relations and the establishment of higher civic standards. He belongs to the Modern Woodmen of America and the Benevolent Protective Order of Elks and his religious faith is that of the Lutheran church. He has justly won the proud American title of a self- made man. for his success is attributable entirely to his own efiforts, perseverance and capability. A thoughtful review of his life record will clearly indicate the fact that he has always been foremost in the adoption of methods to improve his business, taking an initiative step along many lines. In fact he has ever been a leader, not a follower, and his orderly progression has brought him to a place of distinction and of success. CHARLES XAVIER LARRABEE. The specific and distinctive office of biography is not to give voice to a man's modest estimate of himself and his accomplishments but rather to leave a per- petual record establishing his character by the consensus of opinion on the part of his fellowmen. Throughout r>ellingham and throughout Washington Charles Xavier Larrabee is spoken of in terms of admiration and respect. His life was so varied in its activity, so honorable in its purposes, so far-reaching and bene- ficial in its effects that it became an integral part of the history of his city and left its impress upon the annals of the state. He was in no sense a man in public life, in fact he shunned notoriety and publicity, but nevertheless he exerted an immeasurable influence on the city of his residence in relation to its material, intellectual and moral progress, and Bellingham's history without his life record would be as the story of Hamlet with the leading character omitted. Born in Portville, Cattaraugus county. New York, on the 19th of November, 1843, ^le was the son of a merchant, who about 1850 removed with his family to Wisconsin, where his death occurred when his two sons, S. E. and C. X. Larrabee, were but young lads. They inherited from their father no patrimony but an honorable name. They had been students in the village school at Amro, CHARLES X. LARRABEE .;. TH-E NEW YORK PUBLIC UBRARY ASTOR, LENOX Tfl-DEN FOUNDATION WASHINGTON, WEST OF THE CASCADES 23 and had mastered little more than the rudiments of a common school educa- tion when the necessity of providing for their own support and that of their widowed mother devolved upon them. The mother, however, encouraged the boys to make every possible advance along educational lines, so that when still in his teens, or in 1862, at the age of nineteen, Charles X. Larrabee had quali- fied for teaching and secured a school, devoting four winter terms to that pro- fession. He felt that he owed a duty to his country, then engaged in civil war, but a still greater duty to his widowed mother. All of his hard-earned savings he gave to a substitute, who represented him at the front, and he started anew to earn a living. Throughout the years of his early manhood he faced hard- ships and difficulties but they seemed only to call forth greater courage and determination on his part. He used his opportunities wisely and well, recog- nizing at the outset that he must depend entirely upon his own resources and that he must take advantage of every chance. He left Wisconsin for Montana in 1875 and in that state turned his attention to ranching and mining, his close application and clarity of vision in business matters soon gaining for him a sub- stantial measure of success that placed him in a position of leadership in the lines of business in which he was engaged. He sank the shaft of the famous Anaconda mine forty feet for a half interest in the mine and after selling that property he located and developed the St. Lawrence mine, which he later sold. His greatest achievement in mining was the discovery and development of the Mountain View copper mine at Butte City. In 1887, after a residence of twelve years in Montana, he disposed of the greater part of his mining interests in that' feta'te -bui retained the ownership of his extensive cattle and horse ranch. At that da:te he removed to Portland, Oregon, where in connection with his brother he purchased the HoUaday estate, a part of which lay within the corporation limits, of Portland, on the east bank of the Willamette river. About the same time he became the owner of a large interest in the Fairhaven Land Company. His residence on Bellingham bay dated from 1890 and from that time forward until his death almost a quarter of a century later he was closely associated with many of the business interests which have led to the substantial development and progress of the city. He was one of the builders of the Fairhaven & Southern Railroad and became vice president of the company, while later he was elected president. He owned a majority of the stock but eventually sold the road to the Great Northern Com- pany. He continued his business connections through investments in Montana, Oregon and Washington. He was at one time part owner of the Bellingham Herald and was ever one of its stanchest supporters when financial aid was needed. He became the possessor of valuable mining and ranch property, tim- ber lands and city and suburban realty in the three states mentioned and the wisdom of his judgment in business affairs and the keenness of his vision were indicated in many of his transactions, particularly in his purchase of the Holla- day estate, which became the very center of the east side residence district of Portland and increased rapidly in value with the substantial growth of the city. He became the president of the Oregon Real Estate Company, president of the Pacific Realty Company, vice president of the Northwestern National Bank and of the Northwestern State Bank, and he was the owner of stock in many other important corporations, in which he would accept no office. Vol. II— 2 24 WASHINGTON, WEST OF THE CASCADES In 1892, in St. Louis, Missouri, Air. Larrabee was united in marriage to Miss Frances Payne and to them were born three sons and a daughter : Charles Francis, whose advanced studies were pursued in Reed College at Portland; Edward Payne; Mary Adele; and Benjamin Howard. While the business interests of Mr. Larrabee made him a most valued factor in various communities, he did not feel that this comprised his duty to his home city and to an extent far greater than that of the majority of men he aided in the upbuilding of Bellingham and its interests. A local paper said : \"He had been most lavish in his liberal provisions and donations, actuated by keen- sighted benevolence. The children and youth especially were beneficiaries in the plans of his past philanthropies and those which he was contemplating for the future.\" Just a few weeks before his death, which occurred September 16, 1914, he gave in the name of his wife to the Young Women's Christian Asso- ciation a building costing forty thousand dollars and he was a most generous supporter of the Young Men's Christian Association. He contributed liberally for campaign purposes to the republican party and was regarded as one of its wise counselors, but the honors and emoluments of office had no attraction for him. He endorsed all those purifying and wholesome measures and reforms which have been growing up in the political life of the country and which today are common to both parties. In a word, while never seeking to occupy a posi- tion before the public and in fact shunning publicity, he nevertheless did so great a work for Bellingham and the state that his name has become an integral part of its history. Because of the innate refinement of his nature he opposed everything common and the universality of his friendships interprets for us his intellectual hospitality and the breadth of his sympathy, for nothing was foreign to him that concerned his fellowmen. REV. DANIEL BAGLEY. Rev. Daniel Bagley was born September 7, 1818, in Crawford county, Penn- sylvania, and died in Seattle April 26, 1905. His wife, Susannah Rogers Whipple, was born in Massachusetts, May 8, 1819. While she was a small child her parents moved into western Pennsylvania, near Meadville, Crawford county. This was then a rough and thinly settled region and they grew up amid the privations and hardships of pioneer life. Daniel helped his father clear the original forest off their farm and shared in the toil that was incident to cutting a home out of lands covered with a dense growth of hickory, chestnut, birch, maple, etc. The young people met while they were yet in their teens and acquaintance soon ripened into love, and August 15, 1840, they were made husband and wife. A few days later they started for the prairies of Illinois, and there settled on a claim near Somanauk. The husband farmed and taught school for two years, while the wife performed the household duties of their small and primitive cabin. In 1842 Mr. Bagley was admitted into the ministry of the Methodist Protes- tant church, and for ten years was engaged in active work, nominally being WASHINGTON, WEST OF THE CASCADES 25 stationed at one place each year, but in reality traveling summer and winter from the south, near Springfield, to the northern boundaries of the state. Buffalo and Indian trails then gridironed the broad and thinly settled prairies, and were not succeeded by the iron rails of the early railroads of the state until 1850 and the decade succeeding. At Princeton, Bureau county, the first home of the still young couple was established, and here Mr. Bagley was an active worker in the anti-slavery agitation then beginning to arouse the attention and con- science of here and there a few of the earnest thinkers of the day. Owen Lovejoy's and Mr. Bagley 's churches stood within a few yards of each other, and their pastors united in religious and philanthropical work, and time and again were their anti-slavery meetings broken up by the pro-slavery roughs of the day. During the closing years of the '40s and early in the '50s California and Oregon attracted a great deal of attention, and the more enterprising of the younger generation began the westward movement that has for sixty years gone on in an ever swelling tide. In 1852 Rev. Daniel Bagley was chosen by the board of missions of his church as missionary to Oregon, which then in- cluded the present states of Washington and Idaho and parts of Montana and Wyoming. Their wagon train left Princeton, Illinois, April 20, 1852, and in it were Mr. Bagley and family. Dexter Horton and family, Thomas Mercer and family, William H. Shoudy, John Pike and Aaron Mercer and wife. The wives of Thomas and Aaron Mercer never reached here, but the others all came to Seattle at some period to make their home. Those moving to the Pacific coast that year were an army in numbers, so that the danger from Indians was not great, but the hardships and sufferings of the emigrants were increased. The difficulties of securing water and feed for the stock were great and cholera became epidemic. However, the fifteen or twenty families of this particular train, after nearly five months of almost constant travel, arrived at The Dalles, on the Columbia river, without the loss of one of their number and with practically all their wagons and stock. Here they separated, only two or three families accompanying Mr. and Mrs. Bagley to Salem, Oregon, where they ended their journey September 21, 1852. Mr. Bagley at once began active ministerial and missionary work, and labored unremittingly in all parts of the Willamette valley the next eight years. He established about a score of churches and probably half that number of church edifices were built mainly through his instrumentality. This was long prior to the advent of telegraphs and railroads and the conveniences and com- forts of modern travel. His labors extended from the Umpqua on the south to the Columbia river on the north, and it was rare indeed that he remained at home twenty days in succession and, in fact, a large part of these eight years was employed in itinerant work, traveling through heat and dust, rain, snow, mud and floods by day and night, nearly entirely on horseback, so that at forty years of age his constitution was greatly impaired by exposure and overwork. During all their married life Mrs. Bagley had been an invalid, and in October, i860, the family removed from near Salem to this place, hoping the change of climate would prove beneficial to both of them. The trip was made entirely overland in a buggy — exccDt from Portland to Monticello — and the trip that 26 WASHINGTON, WEST OF THE CASCADES can now be made in as many hours required ten days to accomplish. They made the list of families in the village up to an even twenty, The unbroken forest began where the Colonial building on Columbia street now stands, and at no point was it more than 250 yards from the waters of the bay. Mr. Bagley was the pioneer minister of his church on Puget Sound and for years, covering almost the entire period of the Civil war, was the only clergyman stationed in Seattle. Rev. David E. Blaine, of the Methodist Episcopal church, had been instru- mental in the erection of a church building about 1854 on the present site of the Boston block, which remained unplastered or unceiled for ten years or more. Here Mr. Bagley and a -small band of worshipers gathered weekly. Early in 1865 the historic \"Brown church\" was built at the corner of Second and Madison streets and Mr. Bagley's manual labor and private purse con- tributed largely to that work. Besides his ministerial duties Mr. Bagley became an active and prominent worker in the advancement of the material growth and prosperity of Seattle and King county. Largely through the efforts of Hon. Arthur A. Denny, who was a member of the legislature of 1860-61, the university was located here, and Messrs. Daniel Bagley, John Webster and Edmund Carr were named com- missioners. Selling of lands began at once, and in March, 1861, clearing of the site and work on the university buildings began. As president of the board of commissioners most of the care and responsibility of the sale of lands, erection of the buildings, and establishing of scholastic work fell upon ]\\Ir. Bagley, and during the succeeding three years much of his time was devoted to the university interests, and those labors have borne abundant fruits for Seattle and her citizens. Just prior to and following the year 1870, the development of what are now known as the Newcastle coal mines began. Daniel Bagley, George F. Whitworth, Josiah Settle and C. B. Bagley took up the burden of this work, which was the first to become commercially successful in the territory. Mr. Bagley was the responsible leader and superintendent, and although the com- pany then formed was succeeded by a number of others, the credit of the opening of this great source of wealth to this county belongs to him and his associates. Until 1885 he continued as pastor of the church here and after the twentieth year in charge of the \"Brown church\" he resigned that position. After that time he did a large amount of ministerial work at Ballard, Columbia, Yesler, South Park, etc., continuing down to within a few years of his death. Forty-five years he was prominent, active and efficient as a clergyman and private citizen. Daniel Bagley was a life-long member of the Masonic fraternity, and he was the honored chaplain of St. John's Lodge, No. 9, in Seattle, many years. He was made a Master Mason in Princeton, Illinois, in 1851. He at once affiliated with the lodge in Salem, Oregon, on his arrival there in 1852, and between that time and 1856 became a Royal Arch Mason. On making his home in Seattle he affiliated with St. John's Lodge and remained a member of that lodge during life. He first appeared in Grand Lodge in 1861, and his merits as a Mason are attested by the fact that his brethren of the Grand Lodge of Washington elected WASHINGTON, WEST OF THE CASCADES 27 him their most worshipful grand master at the annual communication of that year. During their later years Mr. Bagley and his wife made their home with their son Clarence in Seattle and there Mrs. Bagley died October ii, 1913. They repose side by side in Mount Pleasant on Queen Anne Hill. C. A. COULTER. C. A. Coulter, South Bend's efficient mayor, actuated in all of his public service by an vmquestioned fidelity to the general good, is well known in business circles as the president of the Coulter Towboat Company. Since xApril, 1890, he has made his home in the city where he now resides and that he is one of its most honored and popular residents is indicated in the fact that he is now serv- ing for the fourth term as chief executive. A native of Illinois, he was born at Shawneetown, December 25, 1858, and when only seven years of age accompanied his parents on their removal to Cairo, Illinois, where he attended school. He afterward took up the blacksmith's and machinist's trades and later was for seven years steamship engineer on the Mississippi river. He was also an engin- eer for three years on the Ohio river, making trips from Pittsburgh to New Orleans, and in April, 1890, he arrived in South Bend. Here he built the tug- boats Laurel and Myrtle and also the boilers for his boats. Developing his business, he organized the Coulter Towboat Company, of which he became pres- ident, with A. J. Burnham. now deceased, as vice president and C. A. Werley secretary and treasurer. Mr. Burnham was at one time captain of the Laurel. Operating his tugboats, Mr. Coulter has developed a large and important business, and while successfully controlling his private interests in that connection he has also made investments in several buildings in South Bend, from which he derives a handsome annual income. In 1890 Mr. Coulter was married to Miss Sallie F. Dyer, of Evansville, Indiana, but a native of Kentucky. The children of this marriage are : Dan F., now of South Bend; Mary L., the wife of Earle Floyd, of South Bend; C. A., Jr., who is a clerk in Drissler & Albright's hardware store; and Laura Isabelle, in school. His fellow townsmen, recognizing his worth and ability, have frequently called Mr. Coulter to fill public offices. He served as a member of the city council for nine years and while on the council served as mayor. He headed the movement to replace the planked streets with cement paving and also was active in instituting the movement resulting in the building of new sidewalks and the installation of a new sewer system. To accomplish this public improvement work the city was bonded for seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars, all of which is now practically paid off and the city is on a cash basis. His fourth election to the office of mayor indicates most clearly Mr. Coulter's standing in public regard. He is held in the highest esteem by all who know him and even those opposed to him politically recognize the value and worth of his service as an official and his marked devotion to the public good; He was one of the stock- holders and organizers of the Commercial Club, which is today out of debt and 28 WASHINGTON, WEST OF THE CASCADES which makes its club house the headquarters for all conventions. He has always been a stalwart democrat but never sacrifices the public good to partisanship nor places the aggrandizement of self before the general welfare. Fraternally he is connected with the Knights of Pythias and the Modern Woodmen of America, while his religious faith is evidenced by his membership in the Presby- terian church. Those who know him, and he has a wide acquaintance, entertain for him the highest regard and his fellow townsmen are proud to be numbered among his friends. PHILIP J. MOURANT. In an enumeration of the specific forces which have contributed to the up- building of Hoquiam and southwestern Washington mention must be made of the Grays Harbor Construction Company, of which Philip J. Mourant was one of the founders and is the president. Their operations along building lines have been extensive, making theirs one of the leading features in the substantial up- building of the Grays Harbor district. His associates in business and those who have watched his career speak of Mr. Mourant as a most resourceful and enterprising man who seems to discriminate readily between the essential and the nonessential and utilizes each force within his control to the best possible advantage. He was born in Quebec, Canada, in 1867, and was but four years of age when taken by his parents to Wisconsin, where he resided from 1871 until 1887. Dur- ing the period of his youth there passed he learned the carpenter's trade and when twenty years of age responded to the call of the west, making his way to Vancouver, Washington, where he engaged in carpentering until 1889. In that year he went to Hoquiam, where he was engaged in the erection of the mill of the Hoquiam Sash & Door Company. At that time the only industry in the city was the small mill of the North Western Lumber Company and in providing a site for the sash and door factory Mr. Mourant tore down the old James residence, which was the first schoolhouse in Hoquiam. So excellent was his work in the erection of the factory that he was accorded the contract for the building of the Bay \\'iew Hotel, also the Pomona Hotel and the Acteson home. In 1893 he took up contract work as a member of the firm of Mourant & Brisco, which firm erected many of the early residences, most of which were frame buildings. When Mr. Brisco went to Mexico in 1898 he was succeeded in the partnership by Milton L. Watson, who has since been identified with the com- pany. At that point in its histor>^ the company broadened its scope, taking on several large contracts, including that for the construction of the plant of the Grays Harbor Lumber Company and for the National Lumber & Box Company. In 1904 Messrs. Mourant and Watson were joined by James T. Quigg and in 1907 the Grays Harbor Construction Company was incorporated. Again the scope of its activities was broadened and the paving business was included in 1914, and some of the finest pavements in the northwest have been laid by this company, including paving in Aberdeen and Everett. The plant of the company is large and splendidly equipped. They are engaged in the build- WASHINGTON, WEST OF THE CASCADES 29 ing of mills and bridges and also take contracts for pile driving, dredging and similar work. Aside from the structures already mentioned as erected by this company, they are well known as the builders of the Woodlawn Mill & Boom Company plant, the mill of the Bridal Veil Lumber Company at Bridal Veil, Oregon, the Lytle block at Hoquiam, the Emerson building, the Hicks building, the Foster block, the Washington and Lincoln schools and the Stearns and Lytle residences. They built the county bridge over the Chehalis river and built the government wharf and trestle for the government jetty in the harbor and are handling all the rock which is being used by the government there. The company owns large bunkers at Hoquiam, together with a fleet of scows and two tugs, the Manette and Hunter. In fact the equipment of the Grays Harbor Construction Company is the best and most complete in this part of the country and represents an expenditure of many thousands of dollars — an expenditure which indicates their faith in the future of the city and in the development of western Washington. In addition to his other interests Mr. Mourant has been vice president of the Rychard Grocery Company and was also a stockholder in the Hoquiam Trust Company. In 1 891 Mr. Mourant was married in Hopetown, Canada, to Miss Lydia A. Ross, a native of Canada, and they have one child, Ethel. Fraternally Mr. Mourant is an Elk, and at this writing, in 1916, is exalted ruler of his lodge. He is also connected with the Eagles and the United Workmen. In politics he is an independent democrat and served as mayor of the city in 1910 and previous to that time as a member of the city council, giving active aid in office and out of it to every measure or movement which he deems of value in the public life of the community. He is a man of resolute purpose who never falls short of the accomplishment of a task to which he sets himself and his developing powers are indicated in the constant growth of his business, which is now of an extensive and important character. FRANK CARLETON TECK. Frank Carleton Teck, newspaper and magazine writer, poet and literary critic, living at Port Angeles, was born in Northfield, Minnesota, November 12, 1869, and the public schools of Shieldsville and of Minneapolis, Minnesota, afiforded him his educational opportunities. The broad field of reading, however, is ever open to the individual if he has the taste and inclination to delve therein and Mr. Teck has never failed to embrace his opportunities in that direction. His initial step in the business world was made as a newspaper reporter and the years have brought him through successive stages to his present high standing as a newspaper and magazine writer, to which work he has devoted the greater part of his attention since January, 1889, or during the entire period of his residence in western Washington. He was a writer of verse and literary criticism for magazines for fifteen years prior to 1907, while living in Bellingham. He has brought forth one brochure of verses, \"Under Western Skies,\" and he has been poet of the Washington State Press Association two or three times. He has been city editor and editor of several Bellingham newspapers at different times, 30 WASHINGTON, WEST OF THE CASCADES also editor of the Seattle Town Crier, the Anacortes American, the Pacific Motor Boat and the Pacific Fisherman and has been staff writer on the Pacific Monthly and Sunset. The scope of Mr. Teck's activities is further indicated in the fact that he was secretary of the Bellingham Chamber of Commerce from 1904 until 1907 inclusive and since the ist of August, 1914, has been secretary of the Port Angeles Commercial Club. On the organization of the Washington Federation of Commercial Organizations in Everett, May 6, 191 5, he was chosen secretary- treasurer and so continued until October 6, 191 6, when, he was elected vice president. On the 3d of November, 1895, at Bellingham, Air. Teck was married to Miss Daisy Bell, a daughter of Captain and Mrs. J. J. Bell, of that city. Her father was formerly sheriff of Whatcom county and .her brother, Raymond R. Bell, is a well known northwest theatrical manager. Mr. Teck has joined but one lodge, the Elks, having membership at Belling- ham for many years, while at present he is connected with Naval Lodge, No. 353, of Port Angeles. His military experience covers eight years with Company F of the First Infantry Regiment of the National Guard of Washington at Bell- ingham, of which he was successively private, first sergeant and second and first lieutenant. He was also a trustee of the Bellingham State Normal School from March, 1899, until June, 1905, when he was retired at his own request. WILLIAM L. ADAMS. William L. Adams, since 1903 president of the First National Bank of Hoquiam, w-as born in Berwick, Pennsylvania, May 27, i860, a son of Enos L. and Margaret (Kisner) Adams. The genealogy of the family is complete back in direct line to John Adams, of East Friesland, who was born prior to the year 1400. The ancestors of all four grandparents of William L. Adams were early settlers of eastern Pennsylvania or New Jersey and four of his ancestors served in the Revolutionary war. Provided with liberal educational advantages, William L. Adams was grad- uated from Mount Union College at Alliance, Ohio, with the degree of Bachelor of Philosophy in i88t. The following year he engaged in sheep ranching in western Texas, he being one of the first to sink wells and run sheep on the staked plains of Texas. In 1882 he was called to the position of county commissioner of Mitchell county, Texas, which offtce he filled for three years, and from 1885 to 1888 he was county assessor of Alidland county, Texas. In the latter year Mr. Adams was married at Fort Worth. Texas, to Miss Elizabeth A. Davis, who was born at Colon. Michigan, a daughter of Willis G. and Adelia (Anderson) Davis, and was graduated from the Michigan Seminary at . Kalamazoo. They became residents of Washington in 1888 while it was still under territorial rule, settling at Hoquiam on the 12th of March, 1890. There they reared their family but their first born, a son, Ralph, died at Ellensburg in infancy. The others are : Gaylord, who married Leal Stevenson and is assistant cashier in the First National Bank of Hoquiam; Gwenivere, a graduate of Vassar WILLIAM L. ADAMS THE NEW YORK PUBLIC UBRARY ASTOR, LENOX TILDEN FOUNDATION WASHINGTON, WEST OF THE CASCADES 33 College, class of 191 5 ; Elizabeth, a graduate of Mount Vernon Seminary at Wash- ington, D. C, class of 1917; and William L., Jr., who was born in 1907, on his father's birthday. Throughout the period of his residence in Hoquiam Air. Adams has been actively and prominently connected with its interests and its development. He organized the Hoquiam high school in 1890 and graduated its first class in 1892. His identification with the banking business dates from February i, 1893, when he became cashier of the Hoquiam National Bank. A few months later he took the init'ative in the project to consolidate the business of the Hoquiam National Bank with that of the First National. The consolidation was consummated on July i8th in the very teeth of the panic of 1893. The title and charter of the First National Bank were retained and for ten years he was cashier of the First National Bank, at the end of which time he was elected to the presidency, in wdiich position of executive control he has now^ continued for fourteen years. His position in banking circles is indicated in the fact that he was honored with the presidency of the Washington State Bankers Association in 1908-9. He is also interested finan- cially in timber and lumbering, being at this time president of the Keystone Tim- ber Company and vice president of the Grays Harbor Lumber Company. Mr. Adams was the organizer and is the president of the Hoquiam Chapter of the Sons of the American Revolution. He is prominent in Masonry as a mem- ber of the Scottish Rite and the Mystic Shrine ; he belongs to the Elks lodge and is a member of the Grays Harbor Country Club and the Delta Tau Delta frater- nity. His religious faith is that of the Episcopal church, while his political views are indicated in his endorsement of the principles and measures of the republican party. He makes his home at the corner of Hill avenue and Center street in Hoquiam and for a quarter of a century has been regarded as one of its most valuable and distinguished citizens. JOHN LEARY John Leary was one of the early mayors of Seattle and a pioneer lawyer but retired from his profession to enter upon business pursuits and became an active factor in the upbuilding of the city. He was closely associated with ever in- creasing activities of larger scope and far-reaching effect and Seattle has had no more enterprising citizen, so that no history of the city would be complete without extended reference to him. Mr. Leary was a native of New Brunswick, his birth having occurred at St. John, November i, 1837. Early in life he started in the business world on his own account and soon developed unusual aptitude for business and a genius for the successful creation and management of large enterprises. His initial efforts were along the line of the lumber trade and \"he became an extensive man- ufacturer and shipper of lumber, to which business he devoted his energies between the years 1854 and 1867. He also conducted an extensive general mercantile establishment in his native town and also at Woodstock, New Bruns- wick. Prosperity had attended his efforts, enabling him to win a modest fortune. 34 WASHINGTON, WEST OF THE CASCADES but the repeal of the reciprocity treaty between the United States and Canada resulted in losses for him. Crossing the border into Maine, he conducted a lum- ber business at Houlton, that state, for some time, but the Puget Sound country was fast coming to the front as a great lumber center and he resolved to become one of the operators in the new field. Mr. Leary reached Seattle in 1869, finding a little frontier village with a population of about one thousand. Keen sagacity enabled him to recognize the prospect for future business conditions and from that time forward until his death he was a cooperant factor in measures and movements resulting largely to the benefit and upbuilding of the city as well as proving a source of substantial profit for himself. In 1871 he was admitted to the bar and entered upon active practice as junior partner in the law firm of McNaught & Leary, which associa- tion was maintained until 1878, when he became a member of the firm of Struve, Haines & Leary. Four years later, however, he retired from active law practice and became a factor in the management of gigantic commercial and public enter- prises which have led not only to the improvement of the city but also to the development of the surrounding country. In the meantime, however, he had served for several terms as a member of the city council of Seattle and in 1884 was elected mayor. His was a notable administration during the formative period in the city's history and he exercised his official prerogatives in such a manner that the public welfare was greatly promoted and in all that he did he looked beyond the exigencies of the present to the opportunities and possibilities of the future. The position of mayor was not a salaried one at that time, but he gave much time and thought to the direction of municipal affairs and while serving was instrumental in having First avenue, then a mud hole, improved and planked. He was the first mayor to keep regular office hours and thoroughly systematized municipal interests. Through the conduct and direction of important business enterprises his work was perhaps of even greater value to Seattle. A contempo- rary historian said in this connection : \"When he came to Seattle none of the important enterprises which have made possible its present greatness had been inaugurated. The most vital period of the city's history had just begun. Only men of the keenest foresight anticipated and prepared for a struggle, the issue of which meant the very existence of the city itself. No city so richly endowed by nature ever stood in such need of strong, brave- and sagacious men. Mr. Leary was among the first to outline a course of action such as would preserve the supremacy of Seattle, and with characteristic energy and foresight he threw himself into the work. A natural leader, he was soon at the head of all that was going on. A pioneer among pioneers, it fell to his lot to blaze the way for what time has proven to have been a wise and well directed move. When the Northern Pacific Railroad Company sought to ignore and possibly to commercially destroy Seattle, Mr. Leary became a leader of resolute men who heroically undertook to build up the city independently of the opposition of this powerful corporation. To this end the Seattle & Walla Walla Railroad was built, an enterprise which at that time served a most useful purpose in restor- ing confidence in the business future of the city, and which has ever since been a source of large revenue to the place. Throughout the entire struggle, which involved the very existence of Seattle, Mr. Leary was most actively engaged, and to his labors, his counsel and his means the city is indeed greatly indebted.\" WASHINGTON, WEST OF THE CASCADES 35 In 1872 Mr. Leary turned his attention to the development of the coal fields of this locality, opening and operating the Talbot mine in connection with John Collins. He was instrumental in organizing a company for supplying the city with gas and served as its president until 1878, thus being closely identified with the early material development of his community. His enterprise also resulted in the establishment of the waterworks system and along these and many other lines his efforts were so directed that splendid benefits resulted to the city. In fact, he was one of the men who laid the foundations for the future growth and importance of Seattle. It was he who made known to the world the resources of the city in iron and coal. Between the years 1878 and 1880 he had exploring parties out all along the west coast to Cape Flattery and on the Skagit and Similki- meen rivers, also through the Mount Baker district and several counties in eastern Washington. His explorations proved conclusively that western Washington was rich in coal and iron, while here and there valuable deposits of precious metals were to be found. The value of Mr. Leary's work to the state in this connection cannot be overestimated, as he performed a work the expense of which is usually borne by the commonwealths themselves. Another phase of his activity reached into the field of journalism. In 1882 he became principal owner of the Seattle Post, now consolidated with the Intelligencer under the style of the Post-Intelligencer. He brought about the amalgamation of the morning papers and erected what was known as the Post building, one of the best of the early business blocks of the city. In 1883 he was associated with Mr. Yesler in the erection of the Yesler- Leary block at a cost of more than one hundred thousand dollars, but this build- ing, which was then the finest in the city, was destroyed by the great fire of Tune, 1889. One can never measure the full extent of Mr. Leary's efforts, for his activity touched almost every line leading to public progress. He was active in the establishment of the Alaska Mail service, resulting in the development of important trade connections between that country and Seattle. He was elected to the presidency of the Chamber of Commerce, which he had aided in organiz- ing, and he also became president of the Seattle Land & Improvement Company and of the West Coast Improvement Company and the Seattle Warehouse & Elevator Company. He was on the directorate of the Seattle, Lake Shore & Eastern Railway Company, was one of the directors of the West Street & North End Electric Railway Company, which he aided in organizing, and was likewise a promoter and director of the James Street & Broadway Cable & Electric line. In financial circles he figured prominently as president of the Seattle National Bank but was compelled to resign that position on account of the demands of other business interests. In February, 1891, he organized the Columbia River & Puget Sound Navigation Company, capitalized for five hundred thousand dollars, in which he held one-fifth of the stock. That company owned the steam- ers Telephone, Fleetwood, Bailey Gatzert, Floyd and other vessels operating be- tween Puget Sound and Victoria. Ere his death a biographer wrote of him: \"It is a characteristic' of Mr. Leary's make-up that he moves on large lines and is never so happy as when at the head of some great business enterprise. His very presence is stimulating. Bouyant and hopeful by nature, he imparts his own enthusiasm to those around him. Pie has not overlooked the importance of manufacturing interests to a city like Seattle, and over and over again has encouraged and aided, often at a personal loss, in the establishment of manufac- 36 WASHINGTON, WEST OF THE CASCADES turing enterprises, having in this regard probably done more than any other citizen of Seattle. He has ever recognized and acted on the principle that property has its duties as well as rights, and that one of its prime duties is to aid and build up the community where the possessor has made his wealth. There are few men in the city, therefore, who, in the course of the last twenty years, have aided in giving employment to a larger number of men than ]\\Ir. Leary, or whose indi- vidual eft'orts have contributed more of good to the general prosperity of Seattle.\" On the 2ist of April. 1892, Mr. Leary wedded Eliza P. Ferry, a daughter of the late Governor Elisha P. Ferry. Their happy married life was terminated in his death on the 9th of February, 1905, at which time he left an estate valued at about two million dollars. He practically retired from active business about 1893. After his death the estate built upon the site of his old home the Leary- Ferry building. Mr. Leary was a man of most generous spirit, giving freely in charity to worthy individuals and to important ptiblic enterprises. He built the finest resi- dence in Seattle just before his death and took great pleasure in planning and erecting the home, but did not live to occupy it. He might be termed a man of large efficiency, of large purpose and larger action. He looked at no question from a narrow or contracted standpoint, but had a broad vision of conditions, opportunities and advantages. His life was never self-centered but reached out along all those lines which lead to municipal progress and public benefit. His work has not yet reached its full fruition but, like the constantly broadening ripple on the surface of the water, its efi'ect is still felt in the upbuilding and improvement of the city. ]\\Irs. Leary still makes her home in Seattle and is very active in charitable w'ork and in club circles, being identified with many women's clubs. Mr. Leary was also president of the Rainier Club, the leading social organization of Seattle, and those who came in contact with him entertained for him the warmest friendship, the highest admiration and the greatest esteem. His was a life in which merit brought him to the front and made him a leader of men. EDWARD C. MOXY. A spirit of energy and enterprise has actuated Edward C. Mony at every point in his business career and gained for him prominence as the secretary and treasurer of the Everett Improvement Company. He was born in Mackford, Green Lake county, Wisconsin, August 19, 1864, a son of Alexander Mony, who was a native of Pennsylvania but of Irish lineage and in the year 1848 removed to Wisconsin, becoming one of the pioneer farmers of that state. His wife was a native of Canada and was of Scotch descent. Edward C. Mony attended the public schools of his native town and after- wards attended a business college at St. Paul, Minnesota. His early life was spent upon the home farm and in early manhood he taught school. He next entered a law office but after a brief period accepted a position in the general offices of the Chicago, ^Milwaukee & St. Paul Railroad Company. He was also WASHINGTON, WEST OF THE CASCADES 37 employed for a short time by the Wisconsin Central. He became interested in the west and made his way to Washington, settHng at Hoquiam in the spring of 1890. He worked there for the real estate firm of Heermans, Congdon & Company for two years, during which period he gained comprehensive knowl- edge of the real estate business. In March, 1892, he removed to Everett when the city had a population of but a few thousand people. He immediately secured a position with the Everett Land Company and continued with that organization and its successor, the Everett Improvement Company, becoming secretary and treasurer of the latter company. In this field he has operated extensively and successfully and is regarded as one of the foremost real estate men of Everett, thoroughly conversant with values and with the property that is upon the mar- ket. This company has negotiated many important realty transfers and his opinions upon any question are largely accepted as authority. Extending his business efl^orts into other connections, Mr. Mony is now secretary and treas- urer of the Everett Railway, Light & Water Company and secretary of the Everett Dock & Warehouse Company and also of the Everett Theatre Company. On the 2d of June. 1897. in Everett, Mr. Mony was united in marriage to Miss Stella Cougill, a native of San Jose, California. They have two children, namely, Robert C, and ^Mary Louise. The family residence is at No. 2326 Rucker avenue. Mr. and Airs. Alony are members of the Everett Golf and Country Club. He is also identified with Everett Lodge, No. 479, B. P. O. E., with the Everett Commercial Club and the Cascade Club, and his political allegiance is given to the republican party, which finds in him a stalwart champion because of his earnest belief in its principles. He had no financial assistance on starting out in life for himself and has won whatever success he has achieved at the price of earnest, self-denying efi^ort, his record proving what may be accomplished through close application, persistent energy and indefatigable industry. PRESTON M. TROY. Preston AI. Troy is now dividing his energies between the aft'airs of the Olympia National Bank, of which he is president, and the practice of law. For a number of years he has been a member of the bar at Olympia and has gained a place of leadership in his profession. He has also long been prominent in the councils of the democratic party of the state and served as a delegate to the national convention at Baltimore in 19 12. He was born in Dungeness, Wash- ington, January 22, 1867, and is a son of Smith and Laura B. Troy. His father was born in Washington county, Pennsylvania, June 4, 1833, and after attending the public schools was a student in the Washington and Jeft'erson College. On beginning his independent career he engaged in the coal business on the Missis- sippi river but in 1849 went to the gold fields of California, going from Texas through Mexico to the coast. From San Francisco he i)roceeded to the Placer- ville mines, where he prospected and also took an active part in politics. In 1852 he drifted north to the Rogue River valley of Oregon, where he engaged in mining for a number of years. There he also participated in political affairs and 38 WASHINGTON, WEST OF THE CASCADES was a member of the first state democratic convention held in Oregon. In i860 he joined the rush to the Cariboo mines in British Columbia, where he remained until 1863, when he returned to the States and settled on land which is now- included in the town of Dungeness. There he turned his attention to agricultural pursuits, but his fellow citizens, recognizing his ability and faithfulness, time and algain called him to public office. For twelve years he was superintendent of schools of Clallam county, for a long period was a member of the board of county commissioners, in 1889 was elected county auditor and for two terms was a member of the legislature, representing Clallam and San Juan counties in the lower house for one term in the territorial period, and representing Clallam county in the second state legislature. His advice was often sought on political questions and he did much to secure the success of his party at the polls. Fra- ternally he was a Alason and his religious faith was indicated by his membership in the Presbyterian church. He was married in Dungeness, June 4, 1865, to Miss Laura Bass Weir, who died there May 11, 1894. She was born in Bowie county, Texas, and was a daughter of John and Saluda J. (Buchanan) Weir, who removed with their family to the Pacific coast in the '50s, making the long journey across the plains in a prairie schooner. They settled upon land near Los Angeles but soon afterward left as they were seriously annoyed by the Mex- icans, who broke down the fences and allowed their cattle to pasture on the growing crops. It was in i860 that the Weir family removed to Washington by boat and they took up their home in Dungeness, where Mr. Weir for some time engaged in hunting, selling the game which he killed to the settlers in that locality. Later he farmed and was following agricultural pursuits at the time of his death in 1885. To Mr. and Airs. Troy were born five children: Preston M., of this review; John Weir, editor and owner of the Alaska Empire, a paper published at Juneau, Alaska ; David Smith, who was killed in an automobile accident at Port Townsend, August 17, 1916, and who had served as state rep- resentative and at time of his death was state senator; Mrs. I. Callow, who is principal of a public school in Dungeness; and Mrs. Laura I. Stone, principal of the high school in Phoenix, Arizona. Preston M. Troy divided his time between attending the public schools and working in the logging camps until he was eighteen years old, when he began farming in partnership with his uncle and so continued until he attained his ma- jority. He then became a student in the Olympia Collegiate Institute, from which he was graduated in 1890, and subsequently he entered the law school of the University of Michigan, which conferred upon him the LL.B. degree in 1893. He then returned to Olympia and has since followed his profession, although of late years he has given the greater part of his attention to the dis- charge of his duties as president of the Olympia National Bank. From 1896 to 1899 and again from 1902 to 1906 he held the office of city attorney and from 1904 until 1908 he was prosecuting attorney of Thurston county. In 1904 he was the democratic candidate for superior judge and was defeated by only seventy-five votes, and in 1910 he was nominated by the non-partisan judiciary league convention as one of five candidates for justice of the supreme court of the state. For seven years he was chairman of the state board of law exam- iners and thus had an important part in determining the requirements for ad- mission to the bar. In 1913 he was elected vice president of the Olympia National WASHINGTON, WEST OF THE CASCADES 39 Bank and in September, 1914, following the death of Leopold F. Schmidt, presi- dent of the institution, Mr. Troy was elected its chief executive ofificer. He has since held that position and has manifested sound judgment, a thorough under- standing of the principles underlying the banking business and keen insight into present day conditions. He is also a director of the Building & Loan Associa- tion and recognition of his executive ability and highly developed business sense was accorded him when he was elected trustee of the Chamber of Commerce and later, in March, 1916, and again in March, 1917, was chosen president of that organization, which is recognized as perhaps the most efficient agency for promoting the all-round development of the city. Mr. Troy was married in Dayton, Washington, October 28, 1896, to Miss Eva Sturdevant, by whom he has three children : Marion Lucile, who is a high school graduate and is now attending the State University ; Harold Preston, who is sixteen years old and is attending high school; and Smith, ten years of age, in the public schools. Mr. Troy is one of the best known democrats in the state of Washington, having served as a member of the executive committee of the democratic state central committee for four years and having been a delegate in 1912 to the national convention at Baltimore which nominated Woodrow Wilson for presi- dent. From the first he has been a stanch W'ilson man and was one of the organizers of the Woodrow Wilson League of Washington. He is a past master of Olympia Lodge, No. i, F. & A. M., belongs to the various Scottish Rite Ma- sonic bodies, is past chancellor of the Knights of Pythias and is a member of the Woodmen of the World, the Native Sons of W'ashington. the University Club of Tacoma, the Olympia Golf Club and the Commercial Club of Tacoma. He is likewise a trustee of the Thurston County Pioneer and Historic Associa- tion and chairman of the Simcrtis monument committee. It is but natural that he should take a keen interest in the preservation of local history, for his entire life has been passed in this state and he has vivid memories of pioneer days when the white man had only begun to gain a footing in the Puget Sound coun- try and when it was impossible to foretell the development which a half cen- tury was to bring about. He believes that the next fifty years will also be a period of rapid progress and no project for the advancement of city or state fails to receive his enthusiastic support. MISS L. C. NICHOLSON. Miss L. C. Nicholson needs no introduction to the readers of this volume, for she became widely known as the proprietor of the Snohomish General Hos- pital, an institution of which the city of Snohomish has every reason to be proud, for it is conducted along the most progressive lines. It was established about ten years ago and two years ago Miss Nicholson purchased the hospital. It is modern in every department and furnishes accommodations to eighteen patients. There is also a large, well lighted operating room and the five physicians of Snohomish practice here independently or collectively as the situation demands. Miss Nicholson is a graduate nurse and after purchasing the institution contin- 40 WASHINGTON, WEST OF THE CASCADES ually worked for its betterment, for the adoption of higher sanitary ideals and for improvement along every possible line. Miss Nicholson comes from Revolutionary stock, her forefathers on both sides serving with distinction in the war for independence. She was born at Pomeroy, Ohio, May 4, 1890, and is a daughter of H. M. and N. Jane (Ander- son) Nicholson, w^ho were natives of A'irginia and Ohio respectively. Her maternal grandfather was Hiram Anderson, an early settler of Ohio, emigrating to that state when it was largely an unbroken wilderness. He bought land for six dollars per acre and lived thereon throughout his remaining days. Miss Nicholson's father became a well known stationary engineer and followed that business in Ohio for many years but in 1900 removed with his family to Wash- ington, establishing his residence in Everett, where he still makes his home. He is now fifty-seven years of age and is yet active in his profession. His wife is living at the age of fifty years. In their family were three daughters : Mrs, Mabel C. Hennessy, now a resident of Seattle; Miss L. C. Nicholson of this review ; and Mrs. Otto Schultz, residing in Portland, Oregon. Miss Nicholson attended school in Ohio and in Everett and when her general education was completed entered a hospital at Vancouver, British Columbia, there pursuing her studies and training until she received her certificate as a graduate nurse. Two years ago she purchased the Snoho"
