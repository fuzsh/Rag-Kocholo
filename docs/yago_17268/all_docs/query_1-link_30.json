        "text": "Many women-directed gems were snubbed, in favor of a story about a sex worker written and directed by a male filmmaker.\n\nAs I sat down to write up a short piece about the winners of this edition of the Festival de Cannes, I received Hanif Kureishi’s newsletter. Ever since his accident in Rome, in December of 2022, the Oscar nominated scriptwriter and author has been paralyzed from the neck down. He’s also been sending out regular updates that are always filled with his usual humor and sense of life — something I look forward to reading week after week.\n\nIn his latest newsletter, titled “Jury Duty,” the British born Pakistani writer reminisced about his two stints as a jury member, in Venice in 1992 and in Cannes, in 2009. On both occasions, the writer was basically told what to pick as winners, in Venice by then festival director Gillo Pontecorvo, and on the Croisette by jury president Isabelle Huppert, whose friendship with Michael Hanneke seemed to guarantee that The White Ribbon would walk away with the Palme d’or.\n\nI am only quoting Kureishi, you can find the piece by clicking on the previous text and would never dare to say something as controversial as this myself. But he does make an interesting point. How much of what is decided about prizes, both in festivals and during award season, is really a question of validity and worth.\n\nPersonally, I believe that Francis Ford Coppola’s Megalopolis, Karim Aïnouz’s Motel Destino and Agathe Riedinger’s Wild Diamond, along with Magnus von Horn’s The Girl with the Needle deserved to win something. And don’t even get me started on the Caméra d'or for best first film…\n\nBut, in the end, certain formulaic cinematic creations are given awards. Or maybe it’s just films I don’t desire to watch… Do they win because they are the best, or because they fulfill the trends of the moment? Or because those handing out the awards are friends with the filmmakers? As a funny aside, in the days preceding the awards ceremony, a colleague who writes for a major trade raved fantastic about Anora, which only solidified my own position in disliking it. And pointed to the natural Palme d’or winner, one that satisfies other palates, just not mine.\n\nPersonally, I’m always going to like a film which will be called a masterpiece in a few years, over something that feels right for right now and perhaps, never again. I also watch a lot of mixed media, read a lot, spend a lot of time with my own thoughts and try to live life. I don’t always think film buffs get around to the latter…\n\nHere is the list of all the award winners, including a well-deserved win in Un Certain Regard for Best Director ex-aequo for Rungano Nyoni whose fantastical On Becoming a Guinea Fowl conquered my heart. She received the award alongside another favorite filmmaker of mine, Roberto Minervini who won for The Damned.\n\nPalme d'or Features\n\nANORA\n\nSean Baker\n\nGrand Prix\n\nALL WE IMAGINE AS LIGHT\n\nPayal Kapadia\n\nJury Prize\n\nEMILIA PÉREZ\n\nJacques Audiard\n\nBest Director\n\nMIGUEL GOMES\n\nfor Grand Tour\n\nSpecial Award\n\nMOHAMMAD RASOULOF\n\nfor The Seed of the Sacred Fig\n\nBest Performance by an Actor\n\nJESSE PLEMONS\n\nin Kinds of Kindness directed by Yórgos Lánthimos\n\nBest Performance by an Actress\n\nADRIANA PAZ\n\nin Emilia Pérez directed by Jacques Audiard\n\nZOE SALDAÑA\n\nin Emilia Pérez directed by Jacques Audiard\n\nKARLA SOFÍA GASCÓN\n\nin Emilia Pérez directed by Jacques Audiard\n\nSELENA GOMEZ\n\nin Emilia Pérez directed by Jacques Audiard\n\nBest Screenplay\n\nTHE SUBSTANCE\n\nCoralie Fargeat\n\nPalme d'or Short Films\n\nTHE MAN WHO COULD NOT REMAIN SILENT\n\nNebojša Slijepčević\n\nSpecial Mention\n\nBAD FOR A MOMENT\n\nDaniel Soares\n\nUn Certain Regard Prize\n\nBLACK DOG\n\nby Guan Hu\n\nJury Prize\n\nL'HISTOIRE DE SOULEYMANE\n\nby Boris Lojkine\n\nBest Director Prize ex-aequo\n\nROBERTO MINERVINI\n\nfor The Damned\n\nRUNGANO NYONI\n\nfor On Becoming a Guinea Fowl\n\nBest Performance by an Actress\n\nANASUYA SENGUPTA\n\nin The Shameless\n\nBest Performance by an Actor\n\nABOU SANGARÉ\n\nin L’Histoire de Souleymane\n\nYouth Award\n\nHOLY COW\n\nby Louise Courvoisier\n\n1st Film Special Mention\n\nNORAH\n\nby Tawfik Alzaidi\n\nCaméra d'or First Film\n\nARMAND\n\nHalfdan Ullmann Tøndel\n\nUn Certain Regard\n\nSpecial Mention\n\nMONGREL\n\nWei Liang Chiang & You Qiao Yin\n\nFirst Prize La Cinef\n\nSUNFLOWERS WERE THE FIRST ONES TO KNOW…\n\nChidananda S Naik\n\nJoint Second Prize\n\nOUT THE WINDOW THROUGH THE WALL\n\nAsya Segalovich\n\nTHE CHAOS SHE LEFT BEHIND\n\nNikos Kolioukos\n\nThird Prize\n\nBUNNYHOOD\n\nMansi Maheshwari\n\nThe Higher Technical Commission for Sound and Images\n\nThe 2024 jury of the CST Artist-Technician prize awarded the prize to Daria d'Antonio, cinematographer on Paolo Sorrentino's Parthenope.
