        "text": "Tracy Lawrence will be adding ‘actor’ to his already impressive resume soon. The singer has landed a supporting role in new feature film L.A. Dirt, due to start filming this weekend in Alabama. He will also contribute music to the soundtrack.\n\nAll the details from the press release:\n\nTracy Lawrence announced today that he would begin filming on June 9, 2012 in Mobile, Alabama for the feature film L.A. Dirt. A movie set in Bay Minette, Alabama about a young man’s dream to become a champion dirt track racer. Lawrence will play the supporting role of the uncle to Ty Hargrove (Michael Roark, Dolphin Tale), the eighteen year-old aspiring racer. In addition, Lawrence’s acting role, his music will be featured in the film.\n\nL.A. Dirt produced by award-winning Tundra Productions combines the action of Days of Thunder, the romance of Urban Cowboy, and the feel-good of Rocky into a PG family feature.\n\n“L.A. Dirt is a movie about real people, struggles, and redemption in small-town America,” said Watt Key, writer of L.A. Dirt and award-winning author of Alabama Moon. “I don’t think we could ask for a better ambassador to represent our message than Tracy Lawrence. He’s lived and sings it through his music, Tracy Lawrence gets it right.”\n\nThe movie marks Lawrence’s first acting role in a full-length film. Early in his career, the multi-platinum selling artist contributed the song “Renegades, Rebels, and Rogues” to the soundtrack of the film Maverick starring Mel Gibson, which earned Lawrence a Top Ten record.\n\nL.A. Dirt plans to wrap principal photography on June 30, 2012."
