        "text": "Director Guan Hu and actress Liang Jing pose on the red carpet during arrivals for the screening of the film \"Megalopolis\" at the 77th Cannes Film Festival in Cannes, France, May 16, 2024. [Photo/Xinhua]\n\nDirector Guan Hu's masterpiece, Black Dog, emerged victorious at the prestigious Un Certain Regard selection, clinching the coveted best film award and shining as the standout Chinese film at the recently concluded 77th Cannes Film Festival.\n\nThe film, a captivating blend of noir and western genres, follows the poignant journey of a troubled loner, brilliantly portrayed by actor Eddie Peng, as he navigates life post-prison in his hometown on the fringes of the Gobi Desert in northwestern China. Through an unexpected bond with a black dog, the protagonist rediscovers the essence of existence, weaving a narrative that resonated deeply with audiences and critics alike.\n\nAdding to the film's accolades, Xiaoxin, the canine star who brought the titular character to life, secured the Grand Jury award at the esteemed Palm Dog ceremony, a testament to the remarkable performances across the cast.\n\nBlack Dog marks a significant milestone in Chinese cinema, becoming only the second Chinese film to claim the Un Certain Regard accolade, bridging an 18-year gap since director Wang Chao's Luxury Car achieved the same honor at the 59th Cannes Film Festival.\n\nFeaturing a stellar cast including Tong Liya, Zhang Yi, and Zhou You, as well as the esteemed filmmaker Jia Zhangke, the film is a collaborative effort supported by various production companies, including internet giant Tencent Video, known for backing blockbuster hits like Creation of the Gods I: Kingdom of Storms and YOLO.\n\nActor Peng, deeply impacted by his experience on set, has since adopted Xiaoxin, the canine co-star, into his life. The bond forged during filming has transformed Peng's daily routine, emphasizing care and companionship that have become integral aspects of his life, even extending to his Cannes preparations.\n\nAudiences can anticipate the release of Black Dog in theaters across the Chinese mainland starting June 15, promising a cinematic experience that transcends boundaries and resonates with viewers on a profound level."
