Inside the gunnysacks are two bodies, a Japanese prisoner of war (POW) and his interpreter, a Chinese. Six months pass without any sign of the Chinese soldiers. As the village is located at 50 m from a Japanese blockhouse, the villagers try to manage their fear. In the meantime, Dasan and his mistress, a young widow, take care of the prisoner and the interpreter with human bonds forming between them. In order to ingratiate himself with the villagers the interpreter falsifies his transmation and tells them the prisoner is begging for mercy. The idea that his begging for mercy comforts them reflects the mentality of the day. But after many months, a food becomes short and situation shows no through road, the villagers finally decide to kill them; As none of the villagers has ever killed anyone and no one wants to take responsability for the death of the POW, a tragic drama will follow...
