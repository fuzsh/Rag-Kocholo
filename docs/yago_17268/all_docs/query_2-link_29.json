        "text": "Movie: The Dirt\n\nRelease: March 22, 2019\n\nMusic biopics are always a hit and miss. My favourites are probably Control (Joy Division, focused on Ian Curtis), I’m Not There (An artistic tall-tale of Bob Dylan’s life), and Ray (Ray Charles). Recently, I found Bohemian Rhapsody to be more of a miss. And today I am writing about the latest miss: Mötley Crüe’s The Dirt.\n\nFor those who haven’t seen it, this film is based on Mötley Crüe’s 2001 biography by the same name. The movie chronicles the band’s notorious reputation as the archetypical 80′s glam-rock cliche: reckless unprotected sex, excessive use of drugs and arguably rock & roll.\n\nBefore getting into the reasons why I thought it was a miss, lets talk about what I did enjoy. The band is played by Daniel Webber (Vince Neil) Douglas Booth (Nikki Sixx), Colson Baker (Tommy Lee), and Iwan Rheon (Mick Mars). In my opinion, the casting was superb. Each of the actors looked very much like the people they were portraying, and the acting was strong. None will win any awards for it, but they played their role well, and that’s worth commending.\n\nThe soundtrack and how music was played up in the film was also outstanding. Instead of jamming as many songs as humanly possible into two hours, each song seemed carefully curated and was given enough play time to be enjoyed with as little interruption as possible. Sometimes as background music and sometimes as a live performance.\n\nHere is where things went wrong. The entire movie felt like a PR stunt to clean up the tarnished reputation of the band. A failed attempt to portray the band as a group of misguided young men who sought to clean up their lives after hitting rock bottom.\n\nIn reality, the debauchery that Mötley Crüe was infamous for in the ‘80s was one that made Led Zeppelin’s wild years seem tame — and nothing to be proud of. Around the clock drunkenness, excessive use of hard drugs, lewdness and a total disregard for others’ lives or properties. Now, I am merely stating the known facts without judgement, but what bothered me the most was the disconnect from reality.\n\nI didn’t want to see more of the excess, the girls or the recklessness, but it’s worth pointing out that while the movie ends with the band sobering up and living happily ever after, it does overlook the fact that even after seemingly hitting rock bottom, some of the members of the band continued with their bad habits. Take, for example, Vince Neil’s two subsequent DUI charges in 2007 and 2010. Or Tommy Lee’s 1998 arrest for physically assaulting Pamela Anderson. Then there is the troublesome confession that Nikki Sixx recanted of him and Tommy Lee raping an unconscious woman.\n\nTo be fair, it does seem like in their later years, most band members have stayed out of trouble.\n\nI would have liked to see more of the songwriting process and dynamic of the band. Or more of the stories that inspired the music. Take, for example, the opportunity to dive deeper into Mötley Crüe’s poignant Theatre of Pain or the darker Dr. Feelgood. Both of which — in my opinion — serve as the redeeming albums of a band whose music often leaned on cliches."
