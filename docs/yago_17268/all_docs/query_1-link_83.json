        "text": "2. The Substance\n\nFrench filmmaker Coralie Fargeat follows up her bloodthirsty festival favourite Revenge with some ghoulish body horror reminiscent of David Cronenberg.\n\nIn what’s been heralded as a career-reviving turn, Demi Moore stars as an ageing actress who embarks on an experimental black-market cloning procedure.\n\nThis gives birth to a fresh-faced doppelgänger, in the form of rising star Margaret Qualley, who proceeds to take Hollywood by storm in this scathing sci-fi satire about the disposability of women in a patriarchal world.\n\n3. Tales of Taipei\n\nThis ambitious anthology brings together 10 of the most dynamic young directors in Asia to paint an eclectic portrait of the Taiwanese capital.\n\n4. The Second Act\n\nThe increasingly prolific and perennially eccentric Quentin Dupieux presents another bizarre, metatextual comedy featuring some of the biggest hitters in French cinema.\n\nLéa Seydoux, Vincent Lindon, Louis Garrel, and Raphaël Quenard play actors who become increasingly frustrated by the uninspired, tiresome romantic comedy that they are filming, and who break character – and the fourth wall – to dissect the material and complain about their privileged plight.\n\nWhile light on its feet, Dupieux’s frivolous farce gleefully skewers the #MeToo movement, cancel culture, and so much more.\n\n5. The Devil’s Bath\n\nFollowing the success of Goodnight Mommy (2014) and The Lodge (2019), writer-director duo Veronika Franz and Severin Fiala return with an eerily atmospheric folk horror film set in the rural wilderness of 18th century Austria.\n\nA young woman moves to a remote woodland location after marrying her sweetheart, but this idyllic setting quickly becomes a physically and emotionally suffocating prison for the new bride, as ancient pagan rituals and rigid Christian dogma become terrifyingly intertwined, driving our young heroine to despair.\n\n6. Desert of Namibia\n\nWhen she embarks on a new romantic pursuit, the fullness of her bipolar condition is brought to bear, and mirrored in director Yoko Yamanaka’s vivid and dynamic style. The film was the winner of the Fipresci prize at Cannes Directors’ Fortnight this year.\n\n7. Hayao Miyazaki and the Heron\n\nSo what inspired the veteran filmmaker back to work? Kaku Arakawa’s fascinating documentary dives deep into the process and personality of this enigmatic figure.\n\n8. Made in England: The Films of Powell and Pressburger\n\nOne of the greatest cinematic partnerships of all time was that between Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger. Known collectively as The Archers, they directed some of the most accomplished British films ever made.\n\nPresented by Martin Scorsese, a lifelong devotee and close friend of Powell’s in his later years, this entrancing documentary charts their creation of numerous masterpieces, from The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp to The Red Shoes.\n\nThe duo’s daring and experimental works, brimming with romance and wonder, will also be the subject of a special Cine Fan programme later this year.\n\n9. The Films of Shinji Somai\n\nOne of the most influential filmmakers of his generation, Shinji Somai is the subject of an eight-film retrospective that promises to be both revelatory and invigorating, as a new generation of cinema-goers discovers his idiosyncratic tales of youth and rebellion.\n\nWhether diving head first into the yakuza genre with Sailor Suit and Machine Gun, a pop-culture phenomenon, or conjuring a sultry, dreamlike rite of passage for the students in the seminal Typhoon Club, Somai’s work is unforgettable.\n\nIn the words of Oscar-winning filmmaker Ryusuke Hamaguchi: “I can say with absolute conviction that no Japanese filmmaker makes a film without being conscious of Somai Shinji’s existence.”\n\n10. King Kong x Godzilla\n\nMerian C. Cooper and Ernest B. Schoedsack’s seminal stop-motion classic brings the eighth wonder of the world to life in astonishing fashion, forever shaping Hollywood as a dream factory where spectacle reigns supreme.\n\nSimilarly, Ishiro Honda’s 1954 kaiju masterwork, conceived in direct response to King Kong, retains every ounce of its profound power 70 years after its devastating debut.\n\nWhat self-respecting fan of blockbuster entertainment would dare miss this opportunity to marvel at these masterpieces once more, on the biggest screens in the city?\n\n11. One from the Heart: Reprise\n\nThe latest in a string of Coppola’s films to receive a major technical and editorial overhaul, One from the Heart is a full-blown, old-fashioned studio musical complete with lavish studio sets, dazzling visuals, powerhouse performances and a fantastic score from the incomparable Tom Waits."
