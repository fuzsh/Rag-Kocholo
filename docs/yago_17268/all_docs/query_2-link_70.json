That print has probably been played hundreds of times at this stage.\n\nIf you feel like going to the screening you can check out the details here.\n\nIt’s a great experience to watch movies projected on film to get an idea of how they really look compared to immaculate DCP digital screenings.\n\nThe Textures\n\nThe textures in the video are from two sources.\n\nI used Film Convert for the main grain. It’s a standard Kodak 35mm grain as I was trying to emulate a high-quality acquisition that had slightly degraded from being played over the years rather than a trashy badly acquired negative.\n\nI then decided I had to make a shiny new purchase to add some select artefacts to the image to take it to the next level.\n\nI settled on Cinegrain and although I’ve only had them about a week or two I’ve been really happy with the elements they’ve created.\n\nYou’ll see in the video insight below how I used them but if you’d like to check out the options you can find them here.\n\nThe Music Video\n\nDue to this being a Directors Cut of the video I can’t host or embed the final video here on Mixing Light.\n\nIf you click on the image below that will take you over to the London Alley web page where you can watch the video:\n\nLet’s jump over to the video insight so I can show you more.\n\n-Dan"
