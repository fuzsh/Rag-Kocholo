        "text": "The world’s most notorious rock band, Mötley Crüe has announced the release of The Dirt Soundtrack that accompanies the upcoming Netflix Film The Dirt, based on the New York Times best-selling 2001 autobiography by Mötley Crüe and Neil Strauss. The soundtrack and film are set to release March 22 worldwide.\n\n“During the filming of our movie we got excited and inspired to write new music. Getting back in the studio with Bob Rock just fueled the creative fires for us. To me, the music sounds like classic Mötley. The lyrics were written for the movie and are a reflection of our life.” – Nikki Sixx\n\nThe 18-song soundtrack mastered by GRAMMY winner, Dave Donnelly features a collection of Mötley Crüe classics that meaningfully underscore significant moments that shape the film. The album includes 14 fan-favorites and chart topping tracks such as “Dr. Feelgood” that charted at #6 on Billboard’s Hot 100 and the anthemic “Girls, Girls, Girls” which reached #2 on Billboard’s Top 200 amongst others. Additional hits featured are “Kickstart My Heart,” “Same ‘Ol Situation (S.O.S.),” “Shout At The Devil” and the iconic ballad, “Home Sweet Home” that landed the band mainstream recognition.\n\nExclusive to the film’s soundtrack, Mötley Crüe recorded four new songs featuring the single, “The Dirt (Est. 1981) (feat. Machine Gun Kelly)” with effortless rap verses surrounding signature guitar riffs. The three remaining songs conclude the album with the catchy “Ride With The Devil,” “Crash And Burn”and the band’s own spin on Madonna’s, “Like A Virgin.”\n\nTrack List\n\n1.
