From the opening moments—when a massive pack of stray dogs running across the desert cause a bus to crash—you get a great sense of isolation and wildness. When they get to the city, you get even more of that, as most of the buildings are abandoned and marked for demolition, as a mine recently closed and all the workers left (which is where all the strays came from). It makes for such an interesting landscape, just tons of abandoned buildings, streets, zoos, shops, and so on. Some really unique…\n\nEIFF #2\n\nMy favourite of the three. Echoes of An Elephant Sitting Still in that gritty aesthetic of northern China way. It kinda blends everything? Like you got this apocalyptic setting of stray dogs having overrun a town while China celebrates the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, seemingly so far removed from the realities of these townspeople that you question if it really is in the same country. Then you have the crime drama element of Eddie Peng playing Lang who just got out of prison. A neighbour asks, \"Did you escape?\" Moments of comedy. Make it in the Gobi desert, traverse via motorcycle, bus, foot. It now has an inkling of a western. Last but not least, star a…\n\nThe thing about the 'dog is man's best friend' formula is that while it is a formula, when the formula works it just works so well, and here is a wonderful example of it from Guan Hu. Through the familiar starting point of an ex-con released on parole, returning to his hometown, we get the stoic, silent man without a sense of purpose going about the motions, until encountering the titular dog who changes his life. Said ex-con here is Lang (a marvellous Eddie Peng, who expresses so much through so little dialogue), and aid dog here is one of the most remarkable canine performers you'll ever see. From rocky beginnings to the growing warmth between the two, every interaction…"
