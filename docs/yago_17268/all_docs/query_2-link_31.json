        "text": "Sorry if theres a thread already for this one but didn't see it. If you are a Motley Crue fan like myself this is a much watch. Yes there's inaccuracies to not spoil stuff Vince Neil's Daughter Skylar is burn in the film around the same time Vince goes to jail for DUI and killing Hanoi Rocks Razzle in the car with him, Many things were crammed in especially most of the 90s with Corabi are glossed over besides the Vince and Skylar stuff at the hospital. For pure enjoyment it's entertaining but I would definitely not allow your kids to watch it. What I liked about this over documentary movie like Bohemian Rhapsody was the band was not afraid to put in their F ups were Queen members seemed to be embarrassed about their past ventures and not want to own up to it. Things like how Under Pressure was written with Mercury and Bowie and what their \"friendship\" really was (a drug and alcoholic love affair) were glossed over. Where with Motley Crue they don't gloss over. Also a few parts of the movie is narrated by the band I think the actors are narrating it and not the band itself though they did have their hands all over the film. In one interview Nikki said he was looking at a Producer who looked at him and said what? Nikki told the producer \"We got a guy who lit himself on fire on stage and I'm waiting for you to yell cut and no we aren't using it.\" Producer tells him \"Isn't that what happened though\" (referring to Sixx being on Fire on stage during one performance. The narrator even goes over some of The Hollywood type parts put into the film making fun of how this or that didn't happen this way or how this person was met here and that person was cut from the movie do to this. Which I found fairly funny. Stuff that's definitely not glossed over is how their producer refused to send them on tour until they sobered up fearing one or all would comeback home in body bags, Nikki Sixx Heroine Addiction, they go through Tommy's love affairs but glossed over his cheating of Heather Locklear and the Pam Anderson stuff, They show a few issues with Mick and they did a great job with Vince dealing with his divorce and Skylar's Cancer Diagnosis. They also did fairly well painting a picture in the opening scenes of Nikki's abusive child hood.\n\nYes because of the time constraints and like I gave above example time lines are somewhat inaccurate but the films message comes across well in the end. Motley Crue was a group of 4 guys 3 kids and a older guy battling a bone disease who never should've made it to the top and did. There was a lot of #### ups along the way but they are human and aren't perfect. They lived the dream and the 4 of them together are forever family. Some people won't like this film do to inaccuracies and other things but I went into this with zero expectations and came out with this being one of my favorite movies made with real life events covering music and or a certain group. MG Kelly does an amazing Tommy Lee, Rheon AKA Ramsey Bolton did a great job of Mick Mars especially getting the comedy side of Mic down (which many people don't realize how funny that dude can be), Douglas Booth is a very good Nikki Sixx showing the controlling side of Sixx with the band as well as the the very detailed and opinionated sides of him. Daniel Webber who plays Vince Neil I thought was perfect looks wise but I'm not sure about overall character there. Davidson who plays their producer for Elektra Records is spot on. Max Miller who plays Razzle from Hanoi Rocks I thought was pretty good just based on footage and interviews I've seen of Razzle as I wouldn't be born to 3 1/2 yrs after his death. Costabile who plays long time manager Doc McGhee was perfect. Again some people are gonna love it, some people are gonna hate it and some will feel indifferent. I think if a bigger runtime some of the stuff wouldn't have been crammed in so fast. Vince definitely wanted the Skylar stuff in and to fit it in plus have the emotional impact it needed they had to change time lines to give it due diligence. I definitely thought this could've been better as say a 5 part series or something. Broken it up into a Band of Brothers type Mini Series with each era having their own part but I really did like it. For someone who grew up on Motley Crue but not be able to live the era and only hear and read about the stories it was definitely great to see some visual of the debauchery and trouble and hell they raised along the way. as well as seeing the trials and errors. After watching this it really puts into perspective how 4 guys from one of the most notorious bands from the 80s came into the business together and leave the business together with no ill will towards one another. Truly a huge accomplishment for 4 guys who never should've had any amount of the success they did\n\njust watched it, grew up in the MC era, knew the music well, but didnt go to concerts and follow them to that extent b/c i was too young.\n\nReally enjoyed the movie, thought they made some big jumps and that they rose really fast and ended it too soon. But like you said, they could have done a 5 parter.\n\ndef going to rewatch.\n\nWho was the dude Mars kicked out of the band in the beginning? Is he the Pete Best of MC?\n\nThere's some different theories of who it was but I'm not entirely sure. Yes I will definitely rewatch this possible tomorrow or later tonight. When I first watched I watched it right before work on Friday afternoon (Was originally off until my co worker decided to be an idiot and got her shelf fired) so I really didn't get to sit and enjoy it like I should've.\n\nI'm 30 so I never did get to see them either as most of the shows they did I was too young, Carnival of Sins tour was 21Plus so I couldn't even attend that when I was in HS. I was gonna get tickets for the final show in Philly but the night before we were gonna get the Tickets as a last min thing (Work related stuff for both of us so had to figure out schedules) he had a death in the family. And I missed the 2nd to last show because my Brothers College graduation had to of corse be the same day as the show but at 4PM and I was 2 hrs away and wouldn't be home in time.\n\nDefinitely should've been a 5 parter or something It just seemed like everything happened way too fast. I will complain about the build of the film event wise. It seemed to go from them growing up to them already forming the band in like the first 30 mins. Would've liked to have seen more of Mick before Crue\n\nAcerFC said:\n\nI didnt exactly understand that part. Why would Electra (I think it was them) give up the rights as a result of the band not fulfilling the contract. Owning the music would have probably made them more money than another album at that time anyway\n\nBecause Motley was being a pain in the ###. They already fulfilled their contract with them by Generation Swine. Elektra gave them their rights after getting back together and making the album not after Motley Crue and Corabi stuff but after reuniting with Vince. Nikki wanted the music and back catalogue and given that the band was done with their contract technically if Elektra tried to keep the catalogue the Crue could sue them and most likely have won in court. To put it in simple terms Elektra just wanted to be done with them at that point and they weren't gonna resign them. They didn't want to even see them in a court room so it was better to save everyone the hassle and just give them what they wanted.\n\nI'm no expert on music rights either but I do have two friends I went to school with the one made it fairly big (Wrote the theme to Fox's show Empire) and knows Tyrese Gibson, The rapper from Philly Meek Mill and a few others. Hasn't done anything terrible big that a lot of people would know him yet. He's produced a few indy films as well. The problem Is I have another buddy who use to write songs and stuff with him made two EP's and a CD they use to sell at school and stuff. The guy who made it big failed to credit my other friend on any of the work he did for songs or mixing etc. In College he told me how our buddy literally threw him under the bus and went big and didn't even tell him. Was negotiating projects and other things with people behind his back and one day in 2009 he went to his buddies house and his parents said he was out in LA signed with an Indy label a week earlier. He was also in the Movie Delivery Man with Vince Vaughn and Chris Pratt. Unfortunately my other buddy was gonna take him to court for copyright and get essentially his credit and $$ for the work he's done my other buddy was making money off of now. Unfortunately for him the lawyers told him even with the evidence he had about my other friend it's very hard in the music industry to sue for copyright. I think it's great one of the guys I went to school with made it big. He's been to some nice parties, met Paul Walker a few times and many others. Friends with Shamalayn and others. However I think what he did to my other friend was pretty douchey move.\n\nPoint is court sucks when it comes to entertainment and what people what and you have or anything. Elektra just wanted be done with the Crue. Metallica did the same thing to Elektra but essentially just terminated their contract and took their music. Elektra was already in court with Metallica over Cali Labor Code laws the band said the Record company violated. Perhaps Elektra also knew if they didn't give MC what they wanted they'd file the same way Metallica did in court. So to prevent all of that Elektra just said here take your #### and leave then.\n\nDJackson10 said:\n\nIt's why they were so successful with starting Motley Records which is basically Leathür records that released their first album and closed when they signed to Elektra. The smartest movie Nikki ever did was get the rights to their music. They didn't get the rights until they reformed though and Generation Swine was released and the only reason the got their music back was being huge pain in asses to the company and doing what they wanted. The Record label finally said enough and got tired of dealing with them so gave them what they wanted. In the movie Elektra gives them their rights back before they reunite with Vince.\n\nThe rights stuff felt a little self-serving after everything else but Nikki Sixx deserves a ton of credit not only for that but for putting the band together, KEEPING the band together, and delivering the goods song-wise -- getting the most out of himself in that department as well as the most out of the talent he had on hand. Any different piece and I'm not sure they make it. Mars could rip, Vince could wail, Tommy helped him elevate the back end, not to mention being that necessary right-hand man, and nobody wanted anything to do with songwriting, so were mostly just happy to be there. They blew away objectively \"better\" bands from their same scene.. Ratt, Dokken, Quiet Riot.. through sheer force of sound and will. Well, until they didn't anymore, but what a run for these dudes. I always thought they were gimmicky overachievers, even in high school, but whatever it takes, and I have to admit, I've been trying to beat that crappy \"Same Ol' Situation\" out of my head for two days.\n\nWas Dr. Feelgood really any better than the two that preceded it? People seem to think so, I never got it. But I won't go away mad.\n\nThe rawness and intensity of Too Fast and Shout.. that was the lightning they caught in a bottle and they rode it for all it was worth..\n\nAs for the movie, again, yeah, ugly but honest was my take-away. Kinda the Motley Crue of biopics\n\n- The Ozzy scene, well presented as an unheeded warning\n\n- The Pearl Jam poster as the writing on the wall\n\n- Mick as the default moral center/\"relatable\" band member\n\n- It WASN'T a fun film, and I don't think it was supposed to be\n\n- did you know.. the guy who played Nikki got his big break in the UK playing Boy George\n\n- I forgot how crappy their tattoos were all during their biggest years.. at least they were honest about that.. just wasn't a thing yet\n\nbeer 30 said:\n\nI used to work concert security at the Richfield Coliseum in OH and a few other venues around OH &amp; PA. Got to see a lot of cool shows. Was working a music fest at Buckeye Lake, the truly endless New Jersey Bon Jovi tour. It was in 1989, Winger &amp; Cinderella on the bill, kinda the middle of the tour and everyone was wore the #### out. I remember seeing the lead singer for Cinderella and wondering if he was going to make it. White as a sheet, about 150 degrees outside and he's head to toe in black leather. Great show. Look at that schedule https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey_Syndicate_Tour\n\nTie in to MC? Heather Locklear was there after being wore out by Tommy Lee as Richie Sambora's main squeeze.\n\nCinderella's lead Singer Tom Keifer is from my area. In fact where I use to live before my family moved we were like 5 mins from his childhood house. When I moved a town over we were about 10-12 maybe a little more from it. I've met a few of Tom's close friends over the yrs and met Tom a few different times during shows especially solo tours. Tom told me the last time he was around before the official announcement Cinderella had no future plans to reunite. Saying Guitarist Jeff laBarr's substance abuse problems were taking a huge toll on the band. Not only that but the guys still in the band didn't want to tour with or make a new album with someone new. It's unfortunate as they were one of the best bands that came out late in the era and so highly underrated and that's just not me saying that because they are local. Ive heard it from so many people. A co worker of mine has a friend who's played in bands and has filled in for Ozzy, Cinderella and the other Philly Band mixed from Cinderella Britny Fox as well as some other acts. He use to run around with Cinderella from time to time when they'd come back to Philly and always said if they had come out when Crue, Quit Riott, Ratt, Poison etc did they'd be huge stars.\n\nHow does this tie in to the Crue and Bon Jovi? Gene Simmons of KISS who Motley have had a long running feud with (Yes Mick's hatred of KISS is very real) took interest in signing Cinderella toPolygram but they had no interest. Jon Bon Jovi was in Philly and saw them at. The Empire Rock Club which was owned at the time by the same guy who Owned the Trocadero which is closing in May. Bon Jovi got them a record deal and Cinderella toured as an opening act for him. The Empire Rock Club closed and now is home to a beer venue, Bingo hall and Restaurant.\n\nCinderella's lead Singer Tom Keifer is from my area. In fact where I use to live before my family moved we were like 5 mins from his childhood house. When I moved a town over we were about 10-12 maybe a little more from it. I've met a few of Tom's close friends over the yrs and met Tom a few different times during shows especially solo tours. Tom told me the last time he was around before the official announcement Cinderella had no future plans to reunite.

That is until I had the chance to see them, maybe ten years ago, at a local small venue. Holy cow did they blow me away with their musicianship. I put Tom Keifer up with anyone as a musician from the era, and while his vocal stylings aren't for everyone, he's one of my favorites.\n\nThe rights stuff felt a little self-serving after everything else but Nikki Sixx deserves a ton of credit not only for that but for putting the band together, KEEPING the band together, and delivering the goods song-wise -- getting the most out of himself in that department as well as the most out of the talent he had on hand. Any different piece and I'm not sure they make it. Mars could rip, Vince could wail, Tommy helped him elevate the back end, not to mention being that necessary right-hand man, and nobody wanted anything to do with songwriting, so were mostly just happy to be there. They blew away objectively \"better\" bands from their same scene.. Ratt, Dokken, Quiet Riot.. through sheer force of sound and will. Well, until they didn't anymore, but what a run for these dudes. I always thought they were gimmicky overachievers, even in high school, but whatever it takes, and I have to admit, I've been trying to beat that crappy \"Same Ol' Situation\" out of my head for two days.\n\nWas Dr. Feelgood really any better than the two that preceded it? People seem to think so, I never got it. But I won't go away mad.\n\nThe rawness and intensity of Too Fast and Shout.. that was the lightning they caught in a bottle and they rode it for all it was worth..\n\nAs for the movie, again, yeah, ugly but honest was my take-away. Kinda the Motley Crue of biopics\n\n- The Ozzy scene, well presented as an unheeded warning\n\n- The Pearl Jam poster as the writing on the wall\n\n- Mick as the default moral center/\"relatable\" band member\n\n- It WASN'T a fun film, and I don't think it was supposed to be\n\n- did you know.. the guy who played Nikki got his big break in the UK playing Boy George\n\n- I forgot how crappy their tattoos were all during their biggest years.. at least they were honest about that.. just wasn't a thing yet\n\nDon't think you'll see anyone ever say they were the most talented. There were bands who came after them who talent wise were a lot better. But what they did do better than anyone was showmanship on stage. Vince was never a \"lead Singer\" as he was more of a frontman in terms of Nikki wanting that David Lee Roth Look a like. He wanted to put on something new and innovative. Yes they took ideas from others but made them better despite the fact that Gene and Paul keep saying Motley stole their whole stage act. Parts of it? No doubt but Tommy is the original Roller coaster type Drum set. Probably one of the best most iconic contraptions that comes out of that era. When you think 80s Glam bands that's one of the biggest things people mention is that. They were more showman then anything. Nikki to his credit had some amazing lyrics and it helped most of their songs were essentially about them and their activities. Nothing after DR Feelgood was great. Theres songs here and there that I like from their albums. I like the song Tommy has on Generation Swine but I'm biased as I have the same name. New Tattoo has some catchy songs. \"Fake\" is essentially about what frauds most of the Hollywood elite and big names are and P*rno Star is really catchy. I actually like the Demo of that song better then the Album version because it's a lot Faster. Saints of LA has some decent tunes especially the title Track. \"Chick = Trouble\" is pretty catchy, MFer of the Year took me a few listens to but I like it for what it is, Teaser on the Comp album is pretty good. Overall nothing was great album wise after Dr Feelgood but theres some good songs in there that may not be hits but are fairly solid for them as whole\n\nDon't think you'll see anyone ever say they were the most talented.

They were innovators in a lot of ways, for the fakes who came later. I don't care who steals who's stage show. And #### KISS.. look in the mirror GENE.. the name Alice Cooper mean anything to you? Smart of Crue and anyone else to avoid them. The crap they were making in the 80's was wholly unoriginal and bottom of the barrel. If this is the best you've got..\n\nI guess by being too young for their good stuff and not catching onto Crue until Theatre, yeah relative to acts like Cinderella who I loved, I thought they were overrated. 3/4 of Theatre is like the same song with different words. Hey HEY! hey hey hey\n\nBut they had those earworms throughout.. Home Sweet Home, Girls Girls Girls, Kickstart..\n\nAfter the early 90's, they weren't alone in the dustbin, as far as relevance. History tells us they were probably about to fade no matter what.\n\nYeah, Saints of L.A. is an earworm too.."
