        "text": "Mötley Crüe might hold the dubious title of being the most ludicrous band to come out of the already ludicrous scene that was sunset strip glam metal in the 1980s – a part of this, I’m pretty sure, is down to the fact that they are by far and away the most wide-reaching, interesting and successful band to come out of that scene.\n\nAs such when their autobiography, The Dirt: Confessions of the World’s Most Notorious Rock Band, was released back in 2001 it became one of the must read rock books and almost straight away there was talk of a movie, though I’ll admit given the stories relayed in the book and the manner in which each band member contradicted almost everything all the others said it seemed an unlikely prospect.\n\nWell, now here we are in 2019, four years after the band stopped playing live and nearly 12 years after my one chance to see them live (at the Hammersmith Odeon), and thanks to Netflix seeming not to give a monkey’s about what ‘good taste’ suggests is fine to put in a film, The Dirt has landed in glorious HD technicolor.\n\nTelling the story covering the same period as the book, with hints at parts of band leader and bass player, Nikki Sixx’s (here played by Douglas Booth), Heroin Diaries thrown into the mix, the film starts as it means to go on as we meet the band at a party in their house just off the Sunset Strip in LA in the early 80s and right away we see this movie isn’t going to pull any punches when it comes to sex and drugs and rock ‘n’ roll.\n\nFrom there the first act is a rollercoaster of all of these things as we see the formation of the band, their getting signed to a major record deal and their first big tours.\n\nWhen the trailer to the film landed I was worried at the flippant and brightly lit styling of it but thankfully the film seemed to find the balance of this in a way that captured the spirt of the glam rock scene with the essence of Crüe and the darker side of their story (though certainly one could argue it glosses over a lot of the nastier stuff).\n\nMost impressively is how the film matches the way the book tells the different sides of the story with the characters ‘breaking the fourth wall’ and addressing the audience directly to explain differing points of view, guitarist Mick Mars (Iwan Rheon, with one of the best of permanently exasperated acting I can recall) being a particular exponent of this but all doing it at various points, particularly earlier on.\n\nThe darker side really kicks in with the second act and the death of Hanoi Rocks drummer Razzle in the car of Crüe singer Vince Neil (Daniel Webber) and the arrival of heroin in Sixx’s life and it’s here that things wobble most as it’s clear that everything here is, for the most part, very surface.\n\nSo when Razzle dies and Vince Neil ends up in jail and the band are on the verge of imploding in a mess of drink, drugs and Mars’ self medicated ankylosing spondylitis they seemingly just carry on regardless at the behest of their manager and here the acting performances, as well as the script, almost hit breaking point and it becomes a story of haircuts as much as anything else (but in many ways that is exactly what one would expect, and the hair cuts are undeniably impressive).\n\nDespite these limitations the way the film is constructed makes it all rather enjoyable and, in a sense, echoes something of Mötley Crüe in general.\n\nWhile most of their music is far from particularly good (and I speak as a fan) you can’t help but be swept up in the energy and enthusiasm of it all, something embodied here in Colson Baker’s (aka Machine Gun Kelly’s) performance of Tommy Lee which feels almost constantly like a kid on a sugar high regardless of what else is going on around him – highlighted by a day in the life scene that brings to mind the video for The Prodigy’s Smack My Bitch Up, but with a suitable lack of attempt at intelligent subtext.\n\nThis is also bolstered by the music performances which, like those of the real band, are ludicrously overblown but brilliantly performed and captured with the actors miming along to the original tracks both in the studio and on stage (complete with over the top pyro and of course Tommy Lee’s flying drum kit)."
