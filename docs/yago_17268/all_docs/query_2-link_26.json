        "text": "When I was growing up, Tommy Lee was a permanent fixture on MTV more for his relationships than his music; I knew some Mötley Crüe songs, sure, but mostly they were the Thing That Came Before the music I wound up liking. But after watching this trailer for The Dirt, Netflix's new Mötley Crüe (please stop making me type those accents) biopic from Netflix, I think I actually like them.\n\nHair-metal dudes always seemed a bit like \"straight guys who wanted all the fun clothes of glam rock but none of the pesky introspection about gender performance.\" Nonetheless, The Dirt seems like it has everything you want out of a biopic. Stage fireworks! Naked people throwing bottles of whiskey in hotels! Degenerative spine diseases! Gay panic over a man looking hot in his little sister's pants! The movie is based on The Dirt: Confessions of the World's Most Notorious Rock Band, the tell-all written by the band and published in 2001, and chronicles a version of rock-'n'-roll life that seems all but dead now—which is probably for the best—but it doesn't mean it's not fun to gawk at.\n\nThe Dirt will be released on March 22."
