        "text": "BRACE yourself for the Netflix biopic of Motley Crue which guarantees to shock.\n\nHere's everything you need to know about the film that is available to stream NOW...\n\nWhen is the Dirt released on Netflix?\n\nThe Dirt was released on 22 March 2019.\n\nWhich means it is now available to stream.\n\nBut be warned - it may be the pared down version of real life events/ the book it's based on - but it is in no means pared down in the general sense.\n\nIt definitely should come with a warning to brace oneself - without giving too much away, even the opening scene doesn't hold back and pretty much sets the tone for the rest of the 108 minute running time.\n\nWhat is it about?\n\nThe new Netflix film is about metal rock band Motley Crue and all the highs and lows that come with being a rockstar.\n\nThe biopic is based on the book of the same name by the band itself and ghostwriter Neil Strauss.\n\nAnd they claim that most of the shocking scenes of the movie did actually happen.\n\nAs is the case in the original book, each scene is told from the perspective of a different band member, their manager Doc McGhee or their record exec Tom Zutaut.\n\nDoes the cast look like the original Motley Crue?\n\nDouglas Booth takes on bassist Nikki Sixx in the biopic.\n\nAnd though he's all glammed up and looking the part, some might argue that he's too pretty to play the original rocker.\n\nGame of Throne's Iwan Rheon plays Motley's guitarist Mick Mars and again the glam team did a good job at making him look the part.\n\nColson Baker - otherwise known by his rapper name Machine Gun Kelly - plays the notorious Tommy Lee.\n\nThe rapper-turned-actor is heavily tatted like the drummer himself and dons a black wig for the role so that he can pass for the former wild child.\n\nThe Punisher actor Daniel Webber plays lead vocalist Vince Neil and again transforms into his distinctive look with the help of the well-equipped make up department.\n\nLooking at fan reaction, many have taken to Twitter to praise the film's performances.\n\nAnd the general consensus is that the casting was done well.\n\nSo it's really up to you to decide if you think they do the original band justice...\n\nHere is the rest of the cast:"
