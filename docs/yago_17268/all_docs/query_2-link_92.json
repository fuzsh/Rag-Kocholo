        "text": "The official trailer for the Mötley Crüe movie The Dirt has premiered today (19th February).\n\nScheduled to be released globally on Netflix on Friday 22nd March, The Dirt is based on Mötley Crüe’s infamous collaborative 2001 autobiography The Dirt: Confessions of the World's Most Notorious Rock Band.\n\nClocking in at over two-and-a-half minutes, the trailer follows the band from their embryonic days through to their subsequent success and notorious debauchery. Watch it right here:\n\nNetflix's plot synopsis for the film reads:\n\n“The Dirt is an unflinching and uncensored story about sex, drugs, rock ‘n roll, fame, and the high price of excess. Director Jeff Tremaine (JACKASS co-creator, BAD GRANDPA) shows us just how Nikki Sixx (Douglas Booth), Mick Mars (Iwan Rheon), Tommy Lee (Colson Baker), and Vince Neil (Daniel Webber) took Mötley Crüe from the Sunset Strip to the world stage, and what it meant to become the world’s most notorious rock band.”\n\nPrincipal production started on the biopic in February 2018 in New Orleans, Louisiana a month after the cast members were revealed to the world.\n\nPlaying Nikki Sixx, 26-year-old English actor Douglas Booth has starred in an array of films including Noah, Jupiter Ascending and Loving Vincent. Giving Booth his seal of approval, Nikki Sixx described him as “a killer actor.”\n\n28-year-old American rapper Machine Gun Kelly – real name Colson Baker – portrays Tommy Lee in the film. Alongside a career in hip-hop (which has involved him getting into a very public spat with Eminem), Baker has appeared in several movies including The Land, Nerve and Viral.\n\n30-year-old Australian actor Daniel Webber, who plays Vince Neil, shot to fame playing PTSD-hit war veteran Lewis Wilson in Netflix series The Punisher.\n\nHowever, arguably the best-known cast member is 33-year-old Welsh actor Iwan Rheon as Mick Mars. Rheon, of course, played the evil and twisted Ramsay Bolton in Game of Thrones.\n\nLess than three years after their farewell show in Los Angeles, Mötley Crüe reunited in the studio last autumn to lay down four brand new songs for The Dirt.\n\nVocalist Vince Neil broke the news in September, writing on Twitter: “Exciting news! I’ll be going back in recording studio in a few weeks with the boys to record 4 brand new Motley Crue tracks! Rock On!!”\n\nAfter being deluged with questions from his followers, Vince later clarified things: “For those of you who don’t understand, yes “the boys” means Motley and we signed a contract not to tour anymore. We never broke up or said we would never make music again. Hope this clears it up.”\n\nIn completely unrelated Mötley Crüe news, Nikki Sixx slammed KISS over the weekend saying that part of their End Of The Road tour stage production is ‘an exact re-enactment’ of Mötley Crüe’s Final Tour.\n\nSharing images that allegedly show similarities to the stage set-ups, Nikki Sixx said: \"Our body wasn’t even cold before they took this exact grande finale from our tour. Might not matter to Kiss fans but it does to Crue fans. I dug their music when I was a little kid and it was cool to Co-Headline together a few years but this disappoints me.\"\n\nHear the greatest rock of all time on Planet Rock.
