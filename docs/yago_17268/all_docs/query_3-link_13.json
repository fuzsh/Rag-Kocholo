        "text": "\"I want to keep this dog.\" CineAsia UK has revealed an official UK trailer for a beloved Chinese film titled Black Dog, one of the best dog movies of 2024 (perhaps even of this entire decade). Black Dog premiered at the 2024 Cannes Film Festival a few months ago, and it won top prize in the Un Certain Regard section. It's one of my favorite films from Cannes - here's my review. On the edge of the Gobi desert in Northwest China, Lang returns to his hometown after being released from jail. While working for the local dog patrol team to clear the town of stray dogs before the Olympic Games, he strikes up an unlikely connection with a black dog. These two lonely souls embark on a journey together... It is a story about these two friends, but also how a town changes after realizing it's not a good thing to round up all these animals. Not a single dog (or other animal) was harmed in the making of the film, and a few dogs were adopted by the lead actor after filming. Black Dog stars Eddie Peng, Tong Liya, Zhang Yi, as well as fellow filmmaker Jia Zhangke in a small role as well. Highly recommend adding this film to your watchlist right away - keep an eye out for it.\n\nHere's the first official UK trailer (+ poster) for Guan Hu's Black Dog, found via Letterboxd's Twitter:"
