        "text": "MÖTLEY CRÜE has released a new video for the song \"Take Me To The Top\", which initially appeared on the band's debut album, \"Too Fast For Love\". Now, after the tremendous success of CRÜE's Netflix biopic \"The Dirt\", an official music video for the track has been made available. CRÜE bassist Nikki Sixx says: \"The original footage for this video was shot before we even had a record deal in 1981 and seeing it juxtaposed with the footage from the movie in 2019 is something I don't think any of us ever saw coming. It's been so exciting for the band to watch everyone celebrate the movie, music, and the band's legacy.\" MÖTLEY CRÜE experienced a bump on multiple platforms, including downloads, streams and book sales, following the release of \"The Dirt\". The age demo for fans streaming the band's music includes a much younger demographic. In fact, over a four-week period in late March and April, 64% of Spotify streamers were between 18 and 34 years. MÖTLEY CRÜE has experienced rapid growth with Google search increasing 4300% and sales up 2000%, with albums including \"The Dirt Soundtrack\", \"Dr. Feelgood\", \"Too Fast For Love\" and \"Greatest Hits\" charting on iTunes since the release of the film. \"The Dirt\" currently has 39% critic score from 66 reviews on Rotten Tomatoes, the online review aggregation service that allows both critics and the public to rate movies. The same site has a 95% audience score for \"The Dirt\" from 6,334 reviews. With tremendous success from the film's soundtrack, the lead track, \"The Dirt (Est. 1981) (Feat. Machine Gun Kelly)\", has helped introduce the band from a VH1 audience to a younger MTV and YouTube audience, having been added to MTV channels around the world.\n\nContinue reading..."
