Director Jeff Tremaine (JACKASS co-creator) shows us just how Nikki Sixx (Douglas Booth), Mick Mars (Iwan Rheon), Tommy Lee (Colson Baker), and Vince Neil (Daniel Webber) took Mötley Crüe from the Sunset Strip to the world stage, and what it meant to become the world’s most notorious rock band.\n\nThe Dirt Soundtrack includes four brand new songs and is available for pre-order now through Mötley Records and Eleven Seven Music. The pre-order offers an instant download of the single, “The Dirt (Est. 1981) (feat. Machine Gun Kelly)” HERE and check out the official music video HERE that includes behind the scenes footage.

The three remaining songs conclude the album with the catchy “Ride With The Devil,” “Crash And Burn” and the band’s own spin on Madonna’s, “Like A Virgin.”\n\n“During the filming of our movie we got excited and inspired to write new music. Getting back in the studio with Bob Rock just fueled the creative fires for us. To me, the music sounds like classic Mötley. The lyrics were written for the movie and are a reflection of our life.”\n\n- Nikki Sixx\n\nThe Dirt Soundtrack Tracklist:\n\n1. The Dirt (Est. 1981) (feat. Machine Gun Kelly)\n\n2. Red Hot\n\n3.
