        "meta_description": "Motley Crue's hugely successful Netflix biopic The Dirt remains one of the highest-rated music films as voted by the audience on Rotten Tomatoes, the online review aggregation service that allows both critics and the public to rate movies. As of December 17th, The Dirt remained at 95%, making it one of the highest, if not highest, audience-rated music films of 2019. It ranked higher than the Elton John biopic Rocketman at 88%, the Judy Garland film Judy at 85%, the Beatles-inspired Yesterday at 89%, and the Bruce Springsteen-driven Blinded By The Light at 91%. The Dirt's 95% audience rating also measured up against some of the year's biggest non-music movie releases, including The Irishman with an 86% audience rating, Toy Story 4 at 94%, Joker with 88% and even, at 90%, the all-time box office champ Avengers: Endgame. While Crue fans seemingly loved The Dirt, movie critics were less impressed. The film currently has a 39% critic score from 70 reviews on Rotten Tomatoes, with the Los Angeles Times calling the movie \"astoundingly tone deaf\" and \"vapid and misogynistic.\" The success of the film inspired Motley Crue to abandon a 2014 agreement to never play live again and announce a 2020 comeback tour with Def Leppard, Poison and Joan Jett. The tour, which kicks off on June 21st, 2020, has already sold 700,000 tickets. Aerosmith lead guitarist Joe Perry remembers seeing the Crue back in their early days and told us a while back that they were the best of their era: [\"You know, I remember seeing them play, I think it might have been one of their first big arena shows, at the Santa Monica Civic Center (in California), when their first record came out. And of that generation of bands, they were the best ones, you know what I mean?\"] SOUNDCUE (:13 OC: . . . what I mean?)",
