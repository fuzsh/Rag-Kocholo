        "text": "Mötley Crüe frontman Vince Neil has revealed the release date for the biopic based on the glam rock band.\n\nThe Dirt, tells the story of the glam rock band, based on the stories from the biography by the same name and will be released on Netflix March 22nd 2019.\n\nSee the announcement:\n\nIf you haven't read The Dirt, the Mötley Crüe story is filled with sex, drugs, rock'n'roll and is an unbelievable story that will be even more wild when brought to life on the silver screen.\n\nEarlier this year we had Guns N’ Roses drummer Steven Adler on Triple M Classic Rock Digital and he shared the story how he saved Mötley Crüe’s bass player Nikki Sixx’s life.\n\nListen:\n\nThe film has brought Mötley Crüe back together to work on new material for the film soundtrack, after the band called it a day in 2015.\n\nAccording to the band the new material made for the film is some of the best the band have made."
