        "text": "The love between the French and the Americans has always been mixed with an element of dismissal even contempt but the love is real. Woody Allen walks that fine line in truly inspired fashion. \"Midnight in Paris\" is a delight. This is he first time I actually loved Owen Wilson. He is terrific as Woody's alter ego. Rachel McAdams superb. Her mean American girl is hilarious and frighteningly recognizably, so are Kurt Fuller and Mimi Kennedy as her parents. What a chillingly awful, normal pair. I loved the moment in which Owen Wilson, in a great close up, comes to accept what's happening around him. I accepted it too. Happily. Another stand out moment: the meeting with Salvador Dali, played brilliantly over the top by Adrien Brody. Highly recommended.\n\nWoody Allen's love letter to romance and Paris in the 1920s, with its nucleus of historic artists and writers drawn to the city by its beauty and irresistible forces of creative gravity.\n\nHuman nature often pines for the romance and nostalgia of an earlier era, but one (hopefully) discovers that the \"golden age\" can be our world today, should we choose to recognize and explore its existence around us.\n\nOne of Woody Allen's most universally appealing films laced with subtle humor, and memorable cinematography. The keys to his protagonist role are handed over to Owen Wilson for this excursion into a Parisian daydream fantasy (that sets sail every nite at midnight).\n\nSuperb supporting cast delivers as does Allen's direction and pacing of the film - On my \"5 Favorite Woody Allen Films\" list, and highly recommended.\n\nGil (Owen Wilson) is on a trip to Paris with his fiancée Inez (Rachel McAdams) and her rich conservative family. One night, Gil takes a walk by himself as Inez goes dancing with her friends. A car stops and picks up Gil who is a little tipsy. He ends up in a party in the 1920s with some literary luminaries of the times. He's an amateur writer and is in awe of the company. He can't seem to take Inez there, but he goes back every night to see his new found friends especially Adriana (Marion Cotillard).\n\nThis must be what a fantasy looks like to the literary set. There is a lack of tension. This is more lyrical and more whimsical. The real world holds no interest for me, and I couldn't care less if Gil walks away from it all. My solution would be to fuse the characters Gabrielle (Léa Seydoux) and Adriana together. The fantasy world isn't real enough for me. Gil is constantly in awe. It feels like a costume party with all the literary name dropping. It's not really my field of expertise and I may be missing a lot. It is however very well done with Owen Wilson's great wide-eyed character."
