        "text": "3 stars\n\nIn Midnight in Paris, Woody Allen treats audiences to a picturesque stroll through the title city followed by a confusing journey into the roaring 20s.\n\nGil (Owen Wilson) and Inez (Rachel McAdams) travel to Paris to enjoy art museums, wine, and culinary delights. The engaged couple faces rifts in their relationship as they discover that they each harbor conflicting desires.\n\nGil dreams of leaving his artistically cramping screenwriting job for the freedom of penning a novel, while Inez – hoping for a comfortably posh lifestyle – continues to drag him back to reality.\n\nEach night as the clock stricks midnight, Gil is transported to a time almost a century away to be entertained by his writing idols, like Ernest Hemingway and F. Scott Fitzgerald.\n\nThis film delves into a confusing story of great American writers, a story that Gil loves, but one that audience members might find over their heads.\n\nAllen does not follow a formula, instead pursuing his vision for what life holds in a film that is somewhat a ride without a destination. While there are those who will appreciate Allen’s niche design, those seeking some structure might be confused by such an undefined plot.\n\nNonetheless, this arthouse endeavor is quite delectable. Like some wine, it is an acquired taste, but you’re encouraged to try it anyways."
