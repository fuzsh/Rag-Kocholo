        "text": "I have been itching to write this review for weeks. I am throwing caution and homework to the wind because I can’t wait anymore. Midnight in Paris is one of the most creative, funny, and intelligent movies I have ever seen. Now I’m not usually a fan of Woody Allen. The guy is a little weird and a lot neurotic. I usually find myself wanting to hit him upside the head as if he’s a stuck dvd player. But I’ve got to admit there is something incredibly distinctive about him and his work. He may not have appeared bodily in this film, but I don’t know who I am more impressed by: Woody Allen for being such a distinctive writer that his presence shines so strongly out of someone like Owen Wilson, or Owen Wilson for being able to embody the spirit of Woody Allen so completely.\n\nOwen Wilson plays a young, wealthy Hollywoodite named Gil who has thus far made a living writing films, but is now trying to focus on the more intellectual pursuit of a novel. His fiancée, Inez, played by Rachel McAdams (another lady whom I will see any movie for such is the depth of my crush), is undermining and does not appear to believe in his ability to write a novel despite his success with movies. They are traveling in Paris along with Inez’s annoying, disapproving passive-aggressive parents.\n\nGil and Inez are not in a very loving relationship and seem to be engaged more out of inertia than genuine desire to be together. Throughout the film he can never seem to say anything right and she is constantly either expressing her frustration with him for not being who she wants him to be or condescendingly explaining (her version of) the world to him.\n\nI would say that the weakest part of the film is the flatness of McAdams character, because she doesn’t seem to have any redeeming qualities beyond beauty and poise. She’s just a harpy. However, I didn’t really mind this condition in her character because of the nature of the film: it’s a lighthearted, slightly surrealistic comedy. It would have been more of a disadvantage in a deep, cerebral drama. Instead, her absurdness sort of fits into the absurdness of the rest of the movie.\n\nOne night while wandering tipsily around Paris by himself, Gil finds himself lost. He stops at a street corner, and as a clock strikes midnight a 1920s-esque car pulls up beside him. He is invited inside.\n\nThe car is filled with champagne drinking partyers who whisk him off to a party where he slowly begins to realize he’s not in 2010 anymore. The first indication is when Cole Porter is the man playing the piano and then he meets a couple named F. Scott and Zelda. They offer him the chance to meet Ernest Hemingway which he quickly jumps at and they leave the party. Okay, the guy playing Hemingway was so convincing – perfectly stoic and dramatically monotone just like his stories – that my friend and I were bent over laughing through all of his scenes.\n\nA host of other famous intellectuals make cameos throughout the film such as Gertrude Stein played by Kathy Bates, Salvador Dali and a gaggle of his surrealist companions, Pablo Picasso and then Picasso’s mistress named Adriana played by Marion Cotillard. Gil and Adriana make a connection that makes you wonder if it counts as infidelity if it takes place in a different century."
