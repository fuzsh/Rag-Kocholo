        "text": "City of Lights\n\nMidnight in Paris has become director Woody Allen's top-grossing film, earning $145.2 million and bringing the longtime filmmaker new currency and serious awards season buzz. Tapping into his lifelong love affair with Paris, Allen took time to arrive at the magic story hook of what happens at the midnight hour, then got a boost when new French tax rebates made the production feasible on his modest budget.\n\nPictured, Owen Wilson walks along the Seine in a shot that was used in the film's Van Gogh-like poster.\n\nSTORY: Woody Allen Reveals How He Conjured Up His Biggest Hit 'Midnight in Paris'\n\nOn the Set\n\nWoody Allen (left) and Owen Wilson discuss a scene during one of the film's many night shoots.\n\nAllen's longtime casting director Juliet Taylor suggested Wilson for the lead role of Gil. Though not his typical on-screen alter-ego, Allen liked the idea and reworked the script to accomodate Wilson's more West coast vibe, making him a successful screenwriter.\n\nJokes Wilson: \"He talks about me always being at the beach. I think he thinks I live at SeaWorld.\"\n\nA ‘Wedding Crashers’ Reunion\n\nOwen Wilson was happy to reunite with his Wedding Crashers co-star Rachel McAdams under Woody Allen's direction.\n\nAllen had McAdams in mind for the role of Gil's demanding fiancee when writing the screenplay, selling her the part by telling her: \"You don't want to go your whole life playing these beautiful girls. You want to play some bitchy parts. It's much more interesting for you.\"\n\nKindred Spirits\n\nMarion Cotillard and Owen Wilson are offered suggestions by director Woody Allen.\n\nSays Cotillard: \"Woody Allen in a way found his kind of spiritual son. It was like it was meant to be. Owen fits so perfectly in Woody's universe, it was really organic and made total sense.\"\n\nOn Location\n\nThe production filmed both inside and on the lawns at Versailles, where Michael Sheen and Nina Arianda joined Rachel McAdams and Owen Wilson. Moving at a brisk pace, director Allen shot just 35 days over seven weeks. On the set he would frequently tell the actors to use their own words.\n\nSays co-star Corey Stoll: \"For the big group scenes, he'd figure out the traffic patterns, but then he'd want it to be messy. That was his most common direction: 'Make it messier, make it more like life.'\"\n\nPower Couple\n\nOwen Wilson with Rachel McAdams, as they stop inside a shop.\n\nSays Allen of his films: \"I make them for the fun of making them. I work at a comparatively low budget and make the films for my own enjoyment and hope that other people like them, and it's always nice when they do.\""
