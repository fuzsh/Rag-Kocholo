        "text": "This post may contain affiliate links. Please read the disclaimer here.\n\nMost people either love or hate Midnight in Paris (2011) and all of Woody Allen’s other films for that matter. I am, for better or worse, in the ‘love’ club. Midnight in Paris is basically a daydream in Paris. It’s a tourist film, plain and simple. I don’t think any other film exists that comes close to doing for another city what Midnight in Paris does for Paris. So you can see why I hunted out some Midnight in Paris film locations on my most recent trip there…\n\nMidnight in Paris focuses on the jollies of Gil, an American screenwriter, and his wife-to-be Inez on a long trip to Paris. After getting tipsy one night, Gil loses his way back to his hotel. As the clock strikes midnight, he is picked up by a 1920s Peugeot and driven back in time to roaring 1920s Paris.\n\nIt’s a love letter to Paris, to culture, and maybe to rich white Americans as well. Nevertheless, I thoroughly enjoyed tracking down the Midnight in Paris film locations and now you can too!\n\nAll of the Midnight in Paris Film Locations in… erm…\n\nClaude Monet’s Fountain, 84 Rue Claude Monet, Giverny, 27620\n\nGiverny is about 50 miles away from Paris but apparently makes a good day trip. The ‘happy’ couple, Gil and Inez visit the estate once owned by the revered artist, Monet. It’s perfectly obvious from the setting where Monet found his inspiration for the famous waterlilies!\n\nHotel Le Bristol, 112 Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré, 75008\n\nThe likes of Kim Novak and Charlie Chaplin graced this swishy Hotel with their presence. This is the Hotel where Gil, Inez and her parents stay for the duration of their trip. Considering they seem to be staying in Paris for at least two weeks, I would have gone for an AirBnB but that’s just me.\n\nLe Grande Véfour, 17 Rue de Beaujolais, 75001\n\nJust as upscale as the Hotel Le Bristol is the restaurant where Gil and Inez bump into the pedantic gentleman, Paul and his wife Carol. Many famous guests have also dined at this restaurant and plaques are nailed above their favourite tables.\n\nPalace of Versailles, Place d’Armes, Versailles, 78000\n\nThere are two popular day trips from Paris: Giverny and Versailles. I chose the latter when I visited Paris but if you have the time, you can travel to both! That’s what Gil and Inez did when Paul and Carol offered, making the most out of their trip to France. The Palace of Versailles is the former home of the French monarchy and a beautiful estate to visit.\n\nChopard Boutique, 1 Place Vendôme, 75001\n\nTaking every opportunity to shop for her wedding ring, Inez and her mother are filmed leaving this upmarket jewellery store talking about diamonds and Gil’s flaky nature.\n\nRodin Musée in the Hotel Biron, 77 Rue de Varenne, 75007\n\nOnce again soaking up culture, the foursome takes a guided tour around the Rodin museum and gardens where Paul, unsurprisingly, argues with the guide (Carla Bruni in a cameo role). The building used to be the home of the artist Rodin.\n\nLa Belle Étoile on Hotel Le Meurice rooftop, 228 Rue de Rivoli, 75001\n\nThis is yet another high society Midnight in Paris film location. The Hotel was a favourite of royalty and artists alike such as Queen Victoria and Pablo Picasso. It’s particularly infamous for Salvador Dali’s monthly stays where he would ask for something strange to parade through the lobby like a horse or a herd of sheep. ‘Cause that sounds just like the kind of guy he was!\n\nSt Etienne du Mont, Place Sainte-Geneviève, 75005\n\nGil gets picked up by a 1920s Peugeot as the clock straights midnight outside a church. It’s not the front of the church, but off to the side. And I can personally vouch the film location does not disappoint!\n\nQuai de Bourbon, Ile St-Louis, 75004\n\nThis area of Paris is roughly the location of the party where Gil is taken. Among the guests are F. Scott Fitzgerald, Zelda Fitzgerald and Cole Porter. Just a few B list celebs, then.\n\nBricktop’s Le Grand Duc, 17 Rue Malebranche, 75005\n\nThe famous nightclub was actually at the address 52 Rue Jean-Baptiste Pigalle, 75009 but the scene was shot at the above address in the film. Bricktop was a famous singer and dancer in Paris and opened at least two reputable clubs in Paris in the 1920s.\n\nLe Polidor Restaurant, 41 Rue Monsieur le Prince, 75006\n\nGil’s first foray back into the 1920s finishes at a bar where he meets Ernest Hemingway. Luckily, the bar has not been converted into a Launderette and is still very much intact. The bar dates back to 1845 and was in fact frequented by Ernest Hemingway and Jack Kerouac, a personal favourite author of mine. I’ve read a whole two of his books! Go me.\n\nAntiquités Philippe De Beauvais, 43 Avenue Bosquet, 75007\n\nThis is the antique shop where Inez and her mother consider spending €18,000 on an antique chair. In real life, it actually specialises in lighting so I feel cheated that I can’t visit and drop an absurd amount of money on old furniture.\n\nGertrude Stein’s home, 27 Rue de Fleurus, 75006\n\nHow awesome is it that Gertrude Stein’s home in Midnight in Paris was her Parisian home in real life?! So awesome! Unfortunately, you won’t be able to go inside but there is a plaque above the door commemorating the time she lived there.\n\nMarché aux Puces de Saint-Ouen, 1 Avenue Georges Lafenestre, 75014\n\nGil first meets the young Gabrielle working at this flea market playing old Cole Porter records. It’s a flea market dating back over 50 years and if you’re lucky you might find some treasures too.\n\nMusée de l’Orangerie, Place de la Concorde, 75001\n\nOne of the top Parisian museums and one of my favourite Midnight in Paris film locations, this museum houses part of Monet’s famous waterlilies paintings. It’s also where Gil finally outsmarts Paul with his Picasso knowledge and takes one for the team for moderately smart people.\n\nMusée des Arts Forains at the Pavillons de Bercy, 53 Avenue des Terroirs de France, 75012\n\nGil’s next 1920s soiree is held in a private collection of merry-go-rounds and other fairground-related paraphernalia. It’s more of a venue for events rather than an open exhibition but you can’t deny that it’s certainly a unique film location.\n\nRue du Chevalier de la Barre and Rue Lamarck, 75018\n\nThese are the streets in Montmartre where Adriana and Gil walk together and learn more about one another. The pair also passes the famous Sacre-Coeur Basilica on their walk, very intentionally on Woody Allen’s behalf I assume.\n\nParc Jean XXIII, 4 Parvis Notre-Dame – Pl. Jean-Paul II, 75004\n\nGil has Adriana’s journal translated to him by Carla Bruni while sat in this gorgeous park. It’s not too far away from the Notre-Dame Cathedral.\n\nMaison Deyrolle, 46 Rue du Bac, 75007\n\nThis is a really weird exhibit/gallery in Paris that I might have to visit the next time I go back. It is a building that houses taxidermy, encased insects and other weird and wonderful pieces of art available to purchase. Midnight in Paris makes use of the building for a surrealist wedding celebration in Midnight in Paris and it’s been open since 1831.\n\nRestaurant Paul, 15 Place Dauphine, 75001\n\nIt was outside this restaurant where Gil and Adriana are picked up by a horse and carriage and transported even further back in time to the Belle Epoque.\n\nMaxim’s De Paris, 99 Rue de Rivoli, 75001\n\nAdriana and Gil head to popular bar Maxim’s, a favourite of patrons back in the day.\n\nMoulin Rouge, 82 Boulevard de Clichy, 75018\n\nJeez, these Midnight in Paris film locations sure do get around some hotspots, don’t they? Gil and Adriana stop at the Moulin Rouge Cabaret and bump into famous painter Toulouse Lautrec amongst others.\n\nRestaurant L’Île, Parc de l’Ile Saint-Germain, 170 Quai Stalingrad, 92130\n\nAfter leaving 1920s Paris behind and splitting up with Inez, Gil finds peace sipping an espresso in this riverside Cafe.\n\nShakespeare & Company Bookshop, 37 Rue de la Bûcherie, 75005\n\nGil ends up at Shakespeare & Company bookshop (as seen in Before Sunset too). It does make complete sense that a passionate writer would want to visit the most famous bookshop in Paris during his stay.\n\nPont Alexander III, 75008\n\nFinally, we end our journey of the Midnight in Paris film locations on this majestic Parisian bridge. This is where Gil begins a new relationship and finally experiences Paris in the rain.\n\nAnd that’s all of the Midnight in Paris film locations in Paris!
