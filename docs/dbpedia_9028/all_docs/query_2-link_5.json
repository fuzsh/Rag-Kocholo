        "text": "Paris Insiders Guide to Classic Movies – Midnight in Paris\n\nThis gorgeous movie was shot at some gorgeous locations… that is to say, Paris! Woody Allen's Midnight in Paris elegantly captures the spirit of 1920s and provides a glimpse into the marvelous and legendary Belle Époque, the period of flowering at the end of the 19th century between the close of the Franco-Prussian War and the beginning of the First World War.\n\nWoody Allen takes us on a wildly imaginative journey where we meet many of the famous writers, composers, and painters of the Jazz Age in Paris — Ernest Hemingway, Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald, Cole Porter, Pablo Picasso, Salvador Dali, Gertrude Stein. The film starts with a dazzling selection of Paris locations and sets the scene at Le Bristol, one of the city's most luxurious hotels. The director spends almost as much care and attention to the Paris locations as he does to the actors' performances.\n\nMidnight in Paris Locations\n\nRue Montagne Sainte-Geneviève\n\nIn the film, these are the stairs where Gil goes nightly to catch his magic car ride to the past. It's become a place to see in Paris for Woody Allen fans (and Owen Wilson fans), who sit on the steps at the church of Saint-Etienne-du-Mont behind the Pantheon to pay tribute to the movie.\n\n• Saint-Etienne-du-Mont, Rue Montagne Sainte-Geneviève, 75005\n\nHotel Le Meurice\n\nLe Meurice is the setting for the rooftop terrace wine tasting, where Michael Sheen gives his famous wine tasting speech. Like Le Bristol, Hotel Le Meurice has been awarded the Palace designation, the highest hotel rating in France. The Belle Etoile Royal Suite at the Meurice clocks in at over 15,000€ per night. We'd love to stay there, but…\n\n• Hotel Le Meurice, 228 rue de Rivoli, 75001\n\nHotel Le Bristol\n\nThe luxurious Le Bristol opened its doors in 1925. In Midnight in Paris, the Bristol is the Paris base for Gil (Owen Wilson), his fiancée (Rachel McAdams) and her parents. You can stay in a Junior Suite (as Owen & Rachel did) for as low as 1,500€ per day.\n\n• Hotel Le Bristol, 112 Rue du Faubourg Saint Honore, 75008\n\nRomantic Dinner Cruises In Paris\n\nMaxim's Restaurant\n\nMaxim's de Paris, famous for its Belle Époque décor, is one of the places Gil and Adriana (Marion Cotillard) visit in the 1890s. We like how Woody Allen manages to give us a taste of the good life throughout the film and has chosen some of the most luscious locations in Paris.\n\n• Maxim's, 3 Rue Royale, 75008\n\nMusée Rodin\n\nSet in the garden of the Rodin Museum in the 7th Arrondissement is a great scene where the former First Lady of France (and former rock-and-roll groupie), Carla Bruni, gives a surprisingly believable portrayal as a museum curator.\n\n• Musée Rodin, 79 rue de Varenne, 75007\n\nGo Deeper Into France: Day Trips From Paris\n\nClaude Monet's Garden at Giverny\n\nThere's a very romantic scene on the famous Japanese bridge that arches over Monet's equally famous lily pond. Who else but Allen could get the gardens at Giverny for himself for an entire day to shoot the \"I love you\" scene with Gil and Inez?\n\n• Monet's Garden, Giverny\n\nOther Locations In & Around Paris\n\nMidnight in Paris is an exploration of Paris and of the things we love about it, and there are dozens of additional scenes set in locations that show off the city and environs.\n\nTHE PALACE & GARDENS OF VERSAILLES\n\nA spectacular showing of the Sun King's sumptuous palace.\n\n→ Read How to Visit Versailles…\n\nPONT ALEXANDRE III\n\nThe bridge where Gil meets Gabrielle. One of most beautiful bridges in Paris, it connects the Grand Palais and Petit Palais on the Right Bank with Hotel des Invalides on the Left Bank.\n\n→ Guide to the Bridges of Paris…\n\nRESTAURANT LE GRANDE VEFOUR\n\n17 Rue du Beaujolais, 75001\n\n→ Le Grande Vefour Review…\n\nRESTAURANT LE POLIDOR\n\n41 Rue Monsieur Le Prince, 75006\n\nRESTAURANT PAUL\n\nRue Henri, Place Dauphine, 75001\n\nMUSÉE DE L'ORANGERIE\n\nPlace de la Concorde, 75001\n\n→ Discover Musée de l'Orangerie…\n\nDelectable Food Tours in Paris\n\nMore Classic Paris Movies"
