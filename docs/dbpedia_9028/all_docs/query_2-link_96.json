In 2013, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".[1][2][3]\n\nPlot\n\n[edit]\n\nAmerican showgirl Eve Peabody arrives in Paris from Monte Carlo during a rainstorm with nothing but her clothes (an evening gown). With no money and no place to stay, she persuades soft-hearted Hungarian taxi driver Tibor Czerny to drive her to nightclubs looking for a job in exchange for her doubling his fare. After an unsuccessful search, Tibor buys her dinner and offers to let her stay overnight at his apartment while he finishes his night shift. While attracted to Tibor, she slips away.\n\nSeeking shelter from the rain, Eve sneaks into a black tie classical concert. Without an admission card, she uses the pawn ticket for her suitcase. Stephanie, the hostess, learns that an imposter got in using a pawn ticket, and interrupts the concert to ask if \"Eve Peabody\" is there. Eve tries to slip away, but is intercepted by Marcel Renaud, who invites her to play bridge in another room. The other players are Madame Helene Flammarion and Jacques Picot, a wealthy ladies' man. Eve introduces herself as \"Madame Czerny\" and is partnered with Jacques.\n\nHelene's husband, Georges, enters the room and notices the woman who left during the search for the gatecrasher. Pretending to recognize Eve as the wife of \"Baron Czerny\", he chats with her. When the game ends, Eve and Jacques owe their opponents a few thousand francs. Eve thinks she must try to pass an IOU, but discovers 10,000 francs in her purse. Jacques insists on escorting her back to the Ritz, where she claims she is staying. Eve is stunned to find a lavish suite reserved for her.\n\nMeanwhile, Tibor searches for her. He recruits his fellow taxi drivers by organizing a pool, where everyone puts in five francs and whoever finds Eve wins the money.\n\nThe next morning, Eve awakens to find that \"her\" luggage has arrived: a set of expensive trunks containing a complete wardrobe. Her car and chauffeur are waiting outside. Eve is mystified and frightened until Georges arrives, her mysterious benefactor. He explains that Helene and Jacques think they are in love. Last night, he noticed that Jacques had eyes only for the \"Baroness\". George proposes that Eve encourage Jacques and break up his affair with Helene. Georges will pay her well if she succeeds, and Jacques might even marry her. He gives her an expense account of fifty thousand francs and invites her to the Flammarion estate in Versailles for a weekend house party.\n\nJacques becomes thoroughly captivated by Eve. While driving to the party, the couple are spotted by one of the taxi drivers. He collects the prize money from Tibor, who cannot believe she is staying at the Ritz under his name. Meanwhile, Helene learns that Stefanie accused the wrong person of being the gatecrasher. Suspecting the \"Baroness\", Helene has Marcel retrieve Eve's suitcase.\n\nAt the Flammarion estate, Eve and Jacques arrive together, much to Helene's jealousy. When Marcel arrives with the suitcase, they search its contents and find a photograph of some showgirls, one of whom looks like the \"Baroness\". Helene is about to expose Eve when \"Baron Tibor Czerny\" is announced. Tibor informs the hosts that he has come to be with his \"wife\". Later in private, Tibor professes his love for Eve, who hints that she feels the same way, but she is still determined to marry for money.\n\nThe next morning, Eve suspects that Tibor is about to reveal his true identity, so she explains that the Czerny barons are prone to fits of delusional madness, a story confirmed by Georges. Tibor appears as a taxi driver, but the Flammarions simply humor him, and he walks away in anger. Jacques offers to help Eve get a divorce and then marry her.\n\nEve appears in court for a sham divorce. Although Tibor is angry with her, he accepts payment from Georges to go along. During the proceedings, however, Tibor pretends to be insane, knowing that this will prevent a divorce under French law. Finally cured of her infatuation, Helene leaves arm-in-arm with Georges, while Tibor and Eve head to the marriage bureauâ€”much to the surprise of the judge who just denied their divorce.\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nClaudette Colbert as Eve Peabody\n\nDon Ameche as Tibor Czerny\n\nJohn Barrymore as Georges Flammarion\n\nFrancis Lederer as Jacques Picot\n\nMary Astor as Helene Flammarion\n\nElaine Barrie as Simone\n\nHedda Hopper as Stephanie\n\nRex O'Malley as Marcel Renaud\n\nMonty Woolley as The Judge\n\nArmand Kaliz as Lebon\n\nProduction\n\n[edit]\n\nAccording to a Turner Classic Movies introduction by Robert Osborne, the role that eventually went to Claudette Colbert was originally slated for Barbara Stanwyck but scheduling problems prevented her from taking it. Osborne also stated Wilder was unhappy with script changes made by director Leisen, giving him motivation to become a director himself so he would have more creative control.\n\nReleases\n\n[edit]\n\nThe film was released to theaters in the United States on March 24, 1939.[4][5]\n\nA VHS videotape was released on March 28, 1995;[6] a region 1 DVD was released on April 22, 2008.[7]\n\nRemakes\n\n[edit]\n\nThe film was remade as Masquerade in Mexico (1945) with Dorothy Lamour.[8]\n\nIn 2007, Universal Studios announced plans for a remake of Midnight to be shot in 2010, with Michael Arndt as writer and Reese Witherspoon in the lead role.[9] Universal currently owns the rights to the original version. However, as of November 2011 , the film has not gone into production.\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
