        "text": "Excuse me, but I feel profundity coming on.\n\n“Midnight in Paris” is director Woody Allen’s umpteenth film. I could have Googled the exact number, but it’s not important. What is important, to those interested enough to read a review about a Woody Allen film, is knowing that, way back when, Mr. Allen was a comic genius. He directed films like “Sleeper” and “Bananas” and “Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex*”—each of which was largely misconstrued at the time (meaning “ahead of”). Yes, Allen was hip.\n\nThen, of course, came “Annie Hall” in 1977—which was so ahead of its time that one might suggest it changed the face of the romantic comedy.\n\nBut after “Annie Hall,” Allen became less enamored with farcical comedy (his follow-up film was “Interiors”) and more absorbed with dissecting dysfunctional— although admittedly witty and engaging—adult relationships. Almost overnight, he became a somewhat pretentious, often egocentric art-house sage, a master of the upscale, cosmopolitan, neuroses-based modern romance.\n\nTo many he was an art-house guru, a sort of cinematic Bob Dylan—and I can recall that, in certain circles, if you didn’t understand Allen, you were dismissed as boring or inane. Yet it was rare for an Allen film to rake in more than a modest profit. For many, a Woody Allen film was more like psychoanalysis than entertainment.\n\nIn the late ’90s, I do believe Allen may have tried too hard to illuminate the failings of relationships (or else America was dumbing down sufficiently to miss his point). He married his stepdaughter and made a few clunkers. He was almost relegated to irrelevance.\n\nBut then, as a director, a writer and as an astute observer of Americana, Woody Allen seemed to grow up.\n\nWhich brings us to “Midnight in Paris” and concludes this rambling preamble, my roundabout way of saying Woody Allen has finally settled down, seemingly secure in his own insecurities.\n\n“Midnight in Paris” is possibly his finest work as writer/director in more than a generation—a truly gifted romantic fantasy about the trappings of love and, for Gil, a meek, mild-mannered writer (a perfectly cast, wonderfully self-effacing Owen Wilson), a potent tale of discovering one’s self-worth, at whatever the cost.\n\nI do believe the less said about “Midnight in Paris” the better. The film is full of surprises and best to meet each one with utter oblivion. Suffice it to say this isn’t a typical love story; it’s intelligent, imaginative, existential and—rare for a Woody Allen film—entirely sidesteps Manhattan for an even more magical land.\n\nIt’s not quite a perfect film: Gil’s fiancée, Inez (Rachel McAdams), is too shrill, too annoying to truly take seriously, although no doubt such creatures exist.\n\nBut “Midnight in Paris” belongs to Owen Wilson—it seems Allen may have found his perfect male muse (and if concocted 30 years before, Woody would have no doubt cast himself in the role).\n\nWilson is the perfect younger understudy for this modern (and not-so-modern) fairy tale. Gil’s neuroticism is underscored by his charm; in that regard, he’s the antithesis of Woody Allen playing his own Ritalin-starved protagonist. But it’s Gil’s gentility, his naive tolerance, that helps carry the film on a journey not only through Paris, but—for some of us— into a balmy dreamscape toward nirvana."
