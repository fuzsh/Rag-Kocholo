        "text": "Film Techniques Used in Midnight in Paris:\n\nThe opening sequence of the film is a four-minute montage of Paris by day and by night. It has slow editing in order to show the full spectrum of Paris and to allow the viewer to take in the feel of the city. The main character, Gil, is in love with Paris, and the start of the film makes the audience fall in love with Paris before meeting any of the characters. The classical editing helps to establish the setting of the rest of the film.\n\nThe nondiegetic music that provides the soundtrack is jazzy instrumental music. It helps to give the film a classy, Parisian feel and to play into Gil's fantasy of the Jazz Age.\n\nThe color palette of the film was developed specifically for this film. Everything has a creamy, bright color during the day. There are a lot of pastels and soft colors. The streets of Paris are open and breezy. At night, it is darker and more hazy, but it still maintains that warm look. The dreamy look of the city is used to help capture the simple yet alluring streets of Paris. It also represents the fantasy that Gil experiences while he's there.\n\nThe lighting in this film creates a contrast between day and night. By day, high-key lighting is used to make everything light and soft. But at night, even though it is dark, the lights seem brighter and more dazzling. The low-key lighting at night creates an uncertainty because Gil doesn't know if it's real or not. This contrast is used to help separate the present during the day and the past during the night. Gil transports through time during the night and the changing light helps to distinguish this transition.\n\nWhenever Gil is walking through Paris and there is not dialogue, the camera framing uses a long shot. While Gil is walking, the audience gets a view of everything around him. It is the calm, alluring streets of Paris that captures Gil and in turn captures the audience.\n\nWhen Gil goes to his first party in the 1920s, the camera slowly pans across the room in one shot. This creates the effect of looking around and getting a feel for the whole setting rather than quick editing, which would have been too modern.\n\nWoody Allen's casting of Owen Wilson as Gil Pender was a great choice. Wilson does a great job of delivering Gil's hopelessly romantic, awe-struck personality. His whole demeanor, from the way he walks to the way he babbles to the way he wears the khaki-pants-and-a-tucked-in-checked-shirt perfectly match the classic Woody Allen feel.\n\nThere are several close-ups of Gil. When Gil goes to the 1920s for the first time, a close-up of his face shows his transition from confusion to enjoyment. This shows the audience that he has accepted the fact that he's traveled in time.\n\nThe costumes play an important part in the film to distinguish present-day with the 1920s. The clothes worn by the characters in the present are sophisticated and simple, yet boring. At night in the 1920s, everybody wears dapper suits and sparkly dresses that seem more exciting and fun. The different time periods also require the costumes to match the style of the time.\n\nMost of the scenes in the film use eye-level camera angles and medium shot camera framing so that the audience sees from the same perspective as the characters. Keeping the camera angles and framing simple helps the reader to become a part of the illusion because it feels more natural."
