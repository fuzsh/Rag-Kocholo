        "text": "As for the time travel element, I almost would’ve preferred that the movie take place entirely in the 20s. The characters are certainly much more interesting and we could’ve spent more time with these legends. The problem is, Allen mostly gives us Cliff Notes versions of these characters. It would’ve been much more interesting if Allen wrote these icons as real people instead of such broadly-stroked caricatures, but at least some actors rise above it all. While the environment of the era seems earnest and authentic, I still couldn’t get behind the silliness of Brody shouting, “Dali! Dali! Dali!”\n\nI guess I just couldn’t get into the whimsy of it all, and just couldn’t readily give into it all with the same gee whiz that Wilson does. I especially couldn’t comprehend where Gil thought a romance with Adriana would go, when they are in two different time zones. I understand what Allen is getting at: one should be content, and do the most with where one is at in life. Not dwelling on the past (or longing for other eras in this case) , but discovering and embracing the possibilities around oneself.\n\nSure, I get that poignant theme, but it seems mired in so much comedic schtick, that it all just falls apart for me in the end. I can see why audiences love it though, as it is a vast improvement on the typical rom com garbage they usually get, heck, it’s even better than most current allen films. Ultimately, “Midnight in Paris” is a nice enough film to visit, but unlike Gil, I don’t desire any repeat visits."
