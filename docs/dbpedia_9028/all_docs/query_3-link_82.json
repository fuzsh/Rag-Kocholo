        "text": "A successful screenwriter and his fiancée take a vacation in Paris with her parents and while there, he embarks on a magical journey. The trip is an intoxicating one, a love letter to “The City of Light” during the 1920s. The adventure is historical filled with personalities of art and literature. But a more detailed discussion of who and what he meets would detract from the surprise. For that you’ll just have to watch.\n\nMidnight in Paris displays many of the touchstones that typify a Woody Allen production. He’s always had an affection for the music of the Jazz Age, for example, but who knew he could capture its period with such joie de vivre? His obsession with Europe continues as he has set virtually all of his productions there since 2005’s Match Point. The film begins with an opening montage of beautiful shots of Paris. The images are charming and quaint. They quickly set the mood. His passion with the city becomes our passion. Not only are we immediately intrigued to find out what happens next, we want to purchase plane tickets and fly there right after leaving the theater.\n\nOwen Wilson plays Gil, a Hollywood hack screenwriter tired of being a sellout. He wants to write, I mean really write great literature that will stand the test of time. The story comparison that actor Owen Wilson of utterly hackneyed rubbish like You, Me and Dupree and Drillbit Taylor is now in a sophisticated, well written romantic comedy, is not lost on this reviewer. The dramatic parallels between the actor and the role he is playing are just one of the things that make him so effective in this part. Owen Wilson as Woody Allen’s alter ego inhabits the lead so perfectly, you wonder why he hasn’t appeared in one of the director’s pictures until now. Perhaps Wilson’s involvement in Wes Anderson movies has honed his talent. He arguably gives the best performance. That’s saying a lot because he’s surrounded by an absolutely stellar cast of memorable characters. Marion Cotillard is radiant as Adrianna a mistress and muse of Picasso’s who catches Gil’s eye. Rachel McAdams is given the difficult task of portraying the shrewish fiancée, but she approaches the part tongue-in-cheek and exploits the nastiness of her character to comedic effect.\n\nSo much of the script is based on the unadulterated joy of nostalgia, a sentimental yearning for a previous time period. It intelligently explores the concept from the outlook of someone who shares the point of view while also admitting the inherent pitfalls of the feeling. Our tendency to romanticize the past is explored with insight. Using humor and witty dialogue, the story shares similarities with Play It Again, Sam and The Purple Rose of Cairo , classic pictures of his that twist reality. These are some pretty big shoes to fill. Midnight in Paris isn’t quite up to those classics, but it is his warmest, most sweetly innocent film in decades."
