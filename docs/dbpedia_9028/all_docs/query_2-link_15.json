        "text": "Thinking of doing a Midnight in Paris walking tour and looking for locations to add to your list?\n\nYou’re in the right place. This Woody Allen film is my favourite movie about Paris as it features the fabulous Belle Epoque period, the golden era in Paris.\n\nIt’s a feast for the senses and takes you to some wonderful spots in the city. Whenever I need a Paris fix, I watch this movie. So much so that I’ve lost count of the number of times I’ve seen it, but we’re well into double figures.\n\nFrom the beauty of Monet’s garden to the stunning views of Paris from the rooftop of Hotel Le Meurice, it makes you want to hop on a flight to the City of Love.\n\nImagine Paris in the 1920s, the time of the lost generation when you could rub shoulders with the likes of Cole Porter, Scott Fitzgerald, Pablo Picasso and Ernest Hemingway.\n\nI’m lucky enough to live a two-hour train ride away from Paris and go regularly. I’ve now explored pretty much every location the movie features.\n\nBut still on my bucket list is a stay in the gorgeous Hotel Le Bristol, but I may have to wait a while longer as it’s still a little outside of my budget. But that didn’t stop me from taking a peek inside the lobby.\n\nLet’s dive in and discover the Paris of Woody Allen’s imagination and the Midnight in Paris locations.\n\nA Quick Synopsis of the Plot of Midnight in Paris\n\nMidnight in Paris tells the story of Gil Pender, a screenwriter and aspiring novelist, who is in Paris with his soon-to-be inlaws and fiancée Inez.\n\nGil wanders through the streets of Paris at night to try and get inspiration for his novel and finds himself mysteriously transported back to the 1920s each night at midnight.\n\nAlong the way, he encounters legendary figures from art and literature, including F. Scott Fitzgerald, Ernest Hemingway, and Gertrude Stein.\n\nDuring these trips back in time, he meets Adriana, a fictional muse to some of the era’s most celebrated artists. As Gil’s nightly escapades through the past continue, his fascination with the golden age of the 1920s is paralleled by his growing affection for Adriana.\n\nTheir romance unfolds against the backdrop of a Paris filled with jazz, literature, and art. Adriana’s dreams and desires resonate deeply with Gil, who is searching for meaning and authenticity in his own life.\n\nTogether, they explore the complexities of nostalgia and the human longing for a “golden age,” questioning whether any era is truly perfect or if the beauty of life lies in its imperfection.\n\nMidnight in Paris Locations Map\n\n22 Midnight In Paris Locations To Visit in 2024\n\nNo 1 Claude Monet’s Fountain\n\nThe movie opens with Owen Wilson’s character Gil, and Rachel McAdam’s character Inez, taking a walk through Monet’s garden.\n\nHe’s trying to convince her that moving to Paris and leaving their luxurious life in LA behind is a good idea. However, Inez is having none of it and is not drawn into the magic of Paris in the way he is.\n\nShe tells him he’s in love with a fantasy, and it’s time to get back to town and meet her parents for dinner.\n\n📍84 Rue Claude Monet, Giverny, 27620 | 🌐 Book a Tour of Claude Monet’s House from Paris\n\nNo 2 Le Grande Véfour\n\nGil and Inez head back to town for dinner at Le Grande Véfour, a beautiful 18th-century fine dining restaurant. It was a favoured meeting spot for many of the most influential figures in French history and culture, including Napoleon Bonaparte and Victor Hugo.\n\nIt’s also where we’re first introduced to Paul and Carol, two friends of Inez. Paul is an insufferable know-it-all you can’t help but hate from the minute you meet him in the movie.\n\n📍17 Rue de Beaujolais, 75001 | 🌐 Make a Reservation at Le Grande Vefour\n\nNo 3 Palace of Versailles\n\nAfter bumping into Paul and Carol, the four set off for the Palace of Versailles the next day. Here, they are subjected to Paul’s non-stop commentary about Versailles, the meaning behind the name, and the history behind the palace and gardens.\n\nYou get some gorgeous shots of the garden as they walk through as they visit during the summer months rather than winter when a lot of the garden is shut and covered up.\n\nAs they stroll through the gardens, we hear more about Gil’s desire to live in Paris and finish the novel he’s writing.\n\n📍Place d’Armes, Versailles, 78000 | 🌐 Book a Tour of the Palace of Versailles\n\nNo 4 Rodin Musée in the Hotel Biron\n\nPerhaps one of the most beautiful museums in Paris, sat in the 18th arrondissement, is Rodin Musée. ​​The museum showcases the works of the French sculptor Auguste Rodin and is housed in the Hôtel Biron, surrounded by beautiful gardens. Inside is an extensive collection of Rodin’s sculptures, including iconic pieces like “The Thinker” and “The Gates of Hell.”\n\nGil and Inez do a tour with Paul and Carol, and the tour guide in the movie is none other than Carla Bruni, the former first lady of France.\n\nOnce again, Paul takes over and tries arguing with the tour guide over who was married to Rodin. It takes your level of dislike for the character up several notches. I mean really, who argues with a tour guide?\n\n📍77 Rue de Varenne, 75007 | 🌐 Book your Tickets for the Rodin Musée\n\nNo 5 Hotel Le Meurice rooftop\n\nWith possibly one of the best views of Paris, we’re treated to a look at the rooftop of the Hotel Le Meurice, where Gil and Inez are doing a wine tasting, courtesy of her parents. Of course, Paul and Carol are invited along, and naturally, Paul is an expert on French wine.\n\nThe hotel is part of the Dorchester collection and is where is a hotspot for celebrities. Alain Ducasse is the chef at the two Michelin-star restaurant on site, and you’re a stone’s throw away from Place de la Concorde and the Champs-Elysées.\n\nIt’s a little out of my price range, but I’ll carry on dreaming.\n\n📍228 Rue de Rivoli, 75001 | 🌐 Take a peek insire Hotel\n\nNo 6 St Etienne du Mont\n\nAnd this is where the adventure really begins. After an evening of tasting wine, Paul, Carol, and Inez go off dancing, and Gil takes to the streets for a late-night wander through the Latin Quarter.\n\nHe eventually realises he is completely lost and sits on the steps of a church, St Etienne du Mont. The clock strikes midnight, and that’s where it all starts.\n\nAn old 1920s car draws up to where Gill is sitting on the steps and tells him to jump in, which he does. He’s driven off to a party where he finds Cole Porter playing the piano and meets, Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald.\n\nAt this point, he realises that things aren’t as they should be and that he has somehow fallen through time into the 1920s, his favourite era in Paris.\n\nNow, I have to tell you, on my last trip to Paris, I was staying in a little hotel in the Latin Quarter, only a five-minute walk from St Etienne du Mont. And I just couldn’t help myself.\n\nAt 10.30 pm, I left my hotel, walked up to the church and sat on the steps. It looked just as it did in the movie. Unfortunately, though, I wasn’t whisked back to the golden era of Paris.\n\n📍Place Sainte-Geneviève, 75005 | 🚇 Nearest Metro: Cluny – la Sorbonne\n\nNo 7 Quai de Bourbon\n\nThe scene for the first party Gil goes to in the movie when he steps back in time is a building somewhere on Quai de Bourbon. It looks so romantic at night with the street lamps lit and the cobbled streets.\n\nThe party is being held in honour of Jean Cocteau, the French playwright, novelist and poet.\n\n📍Ile St-Louis, 75004 | 🚇 Nearest Metro: Pont Marie\n\nNo 8 Bricktop’s Le Grand Duc\n\nZelda decides she’s bored and suggests they all go to Bricktops, a nightclub run by the Grande Dame of the Jazz Age in Paris, Ada ‘Bricktop’ Smith. Unfortunately, the nightclub is no longer in existence, but in 1920s Paris, it was the place to be.\n\nIn the movie, the location was near the Pantheon on Rue Malebranche.\n\n📍17 Rue Malebranche, 75005 | 🚇 Nearest Metro: Luxembourg\n\nNo 9 Le Polidor Restaurant\n\nFrom Bricktops, it’s on to Le Polidor Restaurant for a whiskey sour, and it’s here that Gil meets Ernest Hemingway. And luckily, it’s still in existence. I had lunch there, and you couldn’t wipe the smile off my face.\n\nI couldn’t believe I was sitting in a place where the likes of James Joyce and Paul Valéry, among others. These luminaries were drawn to Le Polidor not only for its food but also for its bohemian atmosphere. It opened its doors in 1845 and has been a hub for discussions, debates, and the exchange of ideas during Paris’s culturally rich periods.\n\n📍41 Rue Monsieur le Prince, 75006 | 🌐 Book a Table at Le Polidor\n\nNo 10 Hotel Le Bristol\n\nNow we see our first glimpse of Hotel Le Bristol, where Gil, Inez and her parents are staying. One day, I’ll get to stay here, if for no other reason than to try out the rooftop swimming pool with its views of the Eiffel Tower.\n\nIt’s just a few minutes walk from the Champs Elysées and La Madeleine Place, and has not one, but two Michelin star restaurants, the 3-Michelin star restaurant “Epicure” and the 1-Michelin star restaurant “114 Faubourg”.\n\n📍112 Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré, 75008 | 🌐 Take a look at Hotel Le Bristol\n\nNo 11 Antiquités Philippe De Beauvais\n\nWe get a fleeting glimpse of the antique store as Inez goes shopping for furniture, with the promise of using her Mum’s interior designer discount. But at €18,000 for a chair, I’m not sure I’d be tempted.\n\n📍43 Avenue Bosquet, 75007 | 🌐 Their Facebook Page has their latest items\n\nNo 12 Gertrude Stein’s home\n\nOn Gil’s second night in the 1920s, Ernest Hemingway takes him to Gertrude Stein’s house, where he first meets Adrianna. She’s in a relationship with Pablo Picasso, and on their arrival, there is a heated discussion going on about Pablo’s drawing of Adrianna.\n\nThe house, where Stein lived with her partner Alice B. Toklas, became a hub for the avant-garde arts scene in the early 20th century. Stein, an American writer, art collector, and patron of the arts, hosted regular Saturday evening salons attended by a who’s who of the literary and art world.\n\nThese gatherings were pivotal in shaping the course of modern art and literature, offering a space for collaboration, critique, and camaraderie among emerging and established creatives. Her collection of modernist artworks featured works by Cézanne, Picasso, and Matisse. Today, the building is still there with a plaque outside bearing her name, but unfortunately, you can’t go in.\n\n📍27 Rue de Fleurus, 75006 | 🚇 Nearest Metro: Saint-Sulpice\n\nNo 13 Marché aux Puces de Saint-Ouen\n\nSwallowed up in the romance of his nightly exploits, Gil goes to Marché aux Puces de Saint-Ouen to try and find a Cole Porter record. He meets Gabrielle, a beautiful young French girl selling memorabilia and old vinyl records, just like the plot of his book.\n\nThe Marché aux Puces is one of the largest and most famous flea markets in the world, and the French love their brocantes and flea markets. It’s located on the outskirts of Paris, just beyond the 18th arrondissement, not in the centre of Paris as depicted in the movie, but it’s well worth a visit with its eclectic mix of antiques, vintage items, clothing, and curiosities.\n\nOpening in the early 1900s, Les Puces has grown from a small collection of rag-and-bone men to an institution in Parisian social and cultural life. It’s a place where the past and present merge, which is why Gil ends up finding himself there.\n\n📍 Le Marché Paul Bert, 96-110 rue des Rosiers | 🚇 Nearest Metro: Porte de Clignancourt\n\nNo 14 Musée de l’Orangerie\n\nI love the scene in the movie shot in Musée de l’Orangerie because it’s where Gil finally gets to outsmart Paul. He talks with confidence about Picasso and the drawing of Adrianna, leaving the others open-mouthed. It’s a great scene.\n\nOriginally built in 1852 as a greenhouse for the Tuileries Palace, the Orangerie was transformed into a museum by architect Camille Lefèvre in the early 20th century, with Monet’s Water Lilies murals installed between 1922 and 1926.\n\nThey are spread over two rooms and are quite literally breathtaking. Beyond Monet’s work, it also showcases an impressive collection of post-impressionist and modern art, including the Jean Walter and Paul Guillaume Collection, and features renowned artists such as Renoir, Cézanne, Picasso, Matisse, and Modigliani, among others. 📍 Place de la Concorde, 75001 | 🌐 Book Your Tickets to Musée de l’Orangerie\n\nNo 15 Musée des Arts Forains at the Pavillons de Bercy\n\nOn the following evening, Gil gets to go to yet another party, and this time, it’s a fairground theme featuring the beautiful carousel at Musée des Arts Forains.\n\nOf course, he bumps into Adrianna, and they leave the party to go for a walk. In reality, the walk would have been huge, as they suddenly find themselves in Montmartre, miles away from the Bercy district where the museum is located.\n\nThere is a lovely shot of them coming down the steps of rue du Chevalier de la Barre, one of the most photographed sets of steps in Paris. And from there they walk onto rue Lamark.\n\nThe Musée des Arts Forains (Museum of Fairground Art) is a privately owned museum dedicated to preserving and showcasing the art and artefacts of historical fairgrounds, amusement parks, and carnival attractions from the late 19th and early 20th centuries.\n\nFounded by Jean-Paul Favand, an actor and antiques dealer, the museum opened its doors to the public in 1996 within the ancient wine warehouses of Bercy. The collection includes beautifully restored carousels, vintage fair booths, century-old games, and exquisite carnival art, such as automated pianos, German swings, and Venetian carousels, each piece telling a story of a bygone era of entertainment and spectacle.\n\nI was lucky enough to visit a while back and could have spent hours there indulging myself in the fantasies of a hundred years ago.\n\n📍 53 Avenue des Terroirs de France, 75012 | 🌐 Book Your Tickets to Musee des Arts Forains\n\nNo 16 The Bouquinistes along the Seine\n\nAs Gil is wandering around, he stops at one of the lovely little bouquinistes on the banks of the Seine and buys an old journal that takes his fancy, written in French. He takes it and goes and sits on a bench in front of the Notre Dame.\n\nOn the bench is a French woman, who just so happens to be the guide Paul argued with at Rodin Musée. He asks her to translate some of the journal for him and he discovers that Adrianna is the author. There is a passage talking about him and the earrings he gave her. He realises she was in love with him.\n\nA quick history of the bouquinistes of Paris, the iconic green bookstalls lining the banks of the Seine River. This unique tradition of selling books outdoors has deep historical roots, tracing back to the 16th century. Initially, these sellers were itinerant peddlers who roamed the city’s streets.\n\nHowever, over time, they were granted the right to establish permanent stalls along the riverbanks, under the condition they could easily dismantle them, preserving the aesthetic and integrity of Paris’s scenic views.\n\nThe bouquinistes’ stalls have survived through the ages, witnessing and withstanding the many transformations of Paris. By the 19th century, they had become an established part of Parisian culture. Today, there are about 900 boxes run by approximately 240 bouquinistes along the Seine, offering a treasure trove of old, new, and rare books, along with engravings, magazines, and various collectables.\n\nNo 17 Maison Deyrolle\n\nOn his next trip back in time Gil goes to a Surrealist wedding where Adrianna is a guest. The wedding is set in Maison Deyrolle in Paris’s 7th arrondissement. Founded in 1831, it has become famous worldwide as a temple of taxidermy and natural sciences with an extensive collection of taxidermied animals, insects, shells, and botanical prints, arranged in a manner that feels more akin to a museum than a retail space.\n\nOver the years, Deyrolle has served educational purposes, offering tools for teaching natural sciences, while also appealing to collectors and enthusiasts of the natural world.\n\nThe interior is reminiscent of a Victorian cabinet of curiosities, filled with specimens ranging from exotic butterflies to majestic lions, each telling its own story of the natural world.\n\nAlthough the shop’s appearance in the movie is brief, it encapsulates the film’s fascination with the extraordinary aspects of Parisian culture and history.\n\n📍 46 Rue du Bac, 75007 | 🚇 Nearest Metro: Rue de Bac\n\nNo 18 Restaurant Paul\n\nThe restaurant is only briefly in the movie and is where Adrianna has her own time travel experience accompanied by Gil. A horse and carriage pull up, and they get in and are transported into Adrianna’s dream period.\n\n📍 15 Place Dauphine, 75001 | 🌐 Reserve a table at Restaurant Paul\n\nNo 19 Maxim’s De Paris\n\nOh, to be part of something like this and sit at a table with Toulouse Lautrec, Gauguin and Degas in Maxim’s, which is what Adrianna and Gil do. It’s here that Gil finally tells Adrianna where he is from and that he has travelled through time.\n\nMaxim’s epitomises the opulence and glamour of the Belle Époque period, the golden age of French culture and art from the late 19th century to World War I. Established in 1893 by Maxime Gaillard as a small bistro, it rapidly evolved into one of the most fashionable and exclusive restaurants in Paris.\n\nBy the turn of the 20th century, Maxim’s had become the emblem of Parisian high society, attracting aristocrats, wealthy businessmen and celebrities from around the world.\n\nThe decor is stunning, with mirrored panels on the walls, ornate lamps, mahogany woodwork and stained glass, and a gorgeous painted ceiling.\n\n📍 99 Rue de Rivoli, 75001 | 🌐 Make a Reservation at Maxim’s\n\nNo 20 Restaurant L’Île\n\nAfter finally splitting with Inez after she admits to sleeping with Paul, Gil goes for another wander and ends up sitting at Restaurant L’Île to have a drink.\n\n📍 Parc de l’Ile Saint-Germain, 170 Quai Stalingrad, 92130\n\nNo 21 Shakespeare & Company Bookshop\n\nPossibly one of my favourite spots in Paris is the Shakespeare and Company Bookstore, which appears briefly at the end of the movie.\n\nFounded in 1951 by George Whitman and named after Sylvia Beach’s original Shakespeare and Company, which was a hotspot for expat writers in the 1920s and ’30s, it’s been a home away from home for wandering writers and thinkers ever since, nicknamed tumbleweeds.\n\nWith its weathered shelves crammed with books that whisper the secrets of the past, and cosy corners that invite you to lose track of time, it’s one of the best places to while away an hour or two.\n\nAnd just one street away is my favourite tea room in Paris, Odette’s where the only thing they sell is cream puffs.\n\n📍 37 Rue de la Bûcherie, 75005 | 🌐 Check the website for opening times\n\nNo 22 Pont Alexander III\n\nIt’s a well-known spot and has appeared in many movies, but in this movie, it features at the very end. Gil bumps into Gabrielle from the flea market at the end of the evening. It’s raining, and together, they walk across the bridge talking about Gil’s new life in Paris.\n\n🚇 Nearest Metro: Invalides\n\nFAQS: Midnight In Paris Movie Locations\n\nFinal thoughts: The Locations of Midnight In Paris\n\nThere have been plenty of movies set in Paris, from Amelie to Julie Julia, but this one has more visually amazing moments than all of them put together.\n\nIf you love movies, you might enjoy learning about the places in France that have inspired some Disney movies."
