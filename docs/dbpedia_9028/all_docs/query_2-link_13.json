        "text": "Paris’s Latin Quarter features in so many films. This guided tour revisits the movie sets, pays tribute to the city of light, and plunges into the magical fantasy world of director Woody Allen.\n\nCiné-Balade invites you to travel back in time, like the hero of ‘Midnight in Paris’, to the 1920s, known as the ‘années folles’ (crazy years). Meet the legendary writers and artists that lived in Paris at that time: Zelda and F. Scott Fitzgerald, Cole Porter, Ernest Hemingway, Pablo Picasso, Salvador Dalí, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, and many more. Juliette will tell you all about the history of the neighbourhood and add some cinema history too.\n\nFor example, the tour takes in the Polidor restaurant, which was used as a movie location, the Pantheon movie theatre, the stairs where the emblematic scene of the film was shot, the banks of the Seine, and the Shakespeare and Company bookshop.\n\nWalking tour with photos and video clips on digital tablet.\n\nThis guided tour is conducted in English.\n\nJuliette Dubois is a former production assistant with a master’s degree in the history of cinema. She created Ciné-Balade 11 years ago, and is passionate about sharing her knowledge with visitors. Stroll around Paris with her and immerse yourself in the history of the cinema. Discover the unique destinies of the stars of the screen and hear stories, some frivolous, some serious. Share her passion and find out why Paris attracts all the cameras.\n\nSee also:"
