        "text": "Released in 2011, Midnight In Paris was a huge success for Woody Allen. Part of it must be that location, and Allen managed to make Paris on screen as beautiful as any city had even been. Much like what he did for Manhattan in 1979, Allen opened Midnight In Paris with a montage of the city, to put the audience into the mood of Paris. It also features the music of Sidney Bechet, a track called Si tu vous ma mere.\n\nThe footage takes us through the course of a day – from bright skies to the beautiful lights that come out at night. Many of the locations are later used throughout the film. We are currently working on tracking down every filming location for Midnight Paris, but we wanted to plot out this scene in particular. There’s so many places that we visit for a second.\n\nHere’s every location from Midnight In Paris’ opening scene. Here’s that scene if you’ve not seen it.\n\nThe Eiffel Tower and pont Alexandre III, that lovely ornate bridge over the Seine river. We are standing around Concorde, looking west, right in the middle of Paris.\n\nLa place François-Ier. Just west of Grand Palais. We’re looking down rue François-Ier, heading south east. 8th Arr.\n\nCours la Reine, the lovely walk on the north edge of the Seine, right near pont Alexandre III (just a little to the east of that bridge). 8th Arr.\n\nThe view of Paris as seen from the front of the Sacre Coeur, the beautiful church to the North, in the district known as Monmartre. The street we see is rue du Cardinal Dubois. Behind is the city’s east, as we look south. 18th Arr.\n\nThe Moulin Rouge. 82 Boulevard de Clichy, in Monmartre. 18th Arr.\n\nPlace de la Concorde, looking down the Champs Élysées. You can see the Arc de Triomphe at the end of the road. 8th Arr.\n\nThen another shot of Place de la Concorde. We looking over the river and pont de la Concorde and the National Assembly building.\n\nWe are on pont des Arts, on the river near the Louvre, and facing east towards pont Neuf and the most western point of Ile de la cité, one of two little islands on the Seine. 1st Arr.\n\nRue de la Bonne, on the more northern end, north of the Sacre Coeur and looking up at it. 18th Arr.\n\nThe intersection of rue Galande and rue Saint-Julien le Pauvre. It’s in the 5th Arr just south of Notre Dame.\n\nWe are on the West Bank of Île Saint-Louis, looking towards Île de la Cité. The bridge is pont Saint-Louis and we see two buildings. On the left is Notre Dame, the famous church. The right is actually apartments for some lucky folks.\n\nThe outside dining area of restaurant Le Fouquet’s Paris, on 99 Av. des Champs-Élysées. 8th Arr.\n\nThe Bassin Octogonal, on the western side of jardin des Tulleries, near Concorde. 1st Arr.\n\nPlace de la Concorde once again. You can see the fountain in the middle, and we’re facing west. 8th Arr.\n\nOn Avenue de Camoens, a small street across the river, west side, of the Eiffel Tower. 16th Arr.\n\nJardin du Palais Royal, on the edge of the beautiful garden at the Palais Royal. 1st Arr.\n\nCafé du Trocadéro, located in place du Trocadéro, across the river towards the west of the Eiffel Tower. In the background you can just make out base of the tower, as well as one of the statues on pont d’Iena. 16th Arr.\n\nThe staircase at the south of rue Paul Albert, just to the east of Sacre Coeur. The street at the bottom of the staircase is rue Charles Nodier. 18th Arr.\n\nOutside Musée Monmartre on rue Cortot, Monmartre. 18th Arr.\n\nThe flower shop on the corner of rue Edouard Colonne and quai de la Mégisserie. It’s along the north bank of the Seine, just east of the Louvre.
