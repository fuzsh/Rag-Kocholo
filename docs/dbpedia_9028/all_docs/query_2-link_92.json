        "text": "It’s official: season four of Netflix’s Emily in Paris is (almost) here. Created by Darren Star (the man behind the likes of 90210 and Sex and the City) and with Lily Collins in the starring titular role, the series follows marketing executive Emily Cooper who moves to Paris to provide an American point of view for the very-French office, Savoir. Dubbed ‘the Emily in Paris effect’, the show has garnered so much attention as to affect style and interior trends, and has been noted as somewhat of a walking advertisement for Paris tourism. If you (like us) are desperate to go to Paris, we’ve rounded up where the show was filmed so you can live out your Emily dreams.\n\nC&TH Responsible Tourism Guide\n\nWhere Was Emily in Paris Filmed?\n\nEmily in Paris was filmed in Paris, funnily enough. There is an abundance of filming locations that tourists can visit, from museums to boulangeries to the very place Emily lives. There are also some episodes filmed outside of Paris but still in France, including when Emily famously goes to stay with the family of her new friend, Camille, and when they go on a girls trip to the Riviera with Mindy.\n\nEmily In Paris Filming Locations\n\nAntoine’s Chateau: Château de Montpoupon\n\nChâteau de Montpoupon in Gordes, Provence plays the role of Antoine’s lavender-fringed chateau, a major part of season 3’s sixth episode. As Emily and co come together to promote McLaren’s new ‘Purple Edition’ (a purple version of the real McLaren Artura), the show is whisked away to the heady lavender haze of Provence. To experience France’s sweeping lavender vistas it for yourself, head to Provence between mid-June and mid-August – July is your safest bet for perfect purple blooms. If you’d like to tread in Emily’s footsteps, Château de Montpoupon is the place to be.\n\nVisit: Find Château de Montpoupon at 37460 Céré-la-Ronde, France. Plan your visit at montpoupon.com\n\nEmily’s Apartment: Place de l’Estrapade\n\nEmily lives in Place de l’Estrapade in the fifth arrondissement, which is a real place and easily visited if you’re looking to live it up as Emily. There’s charm in abundance here, with buildings lining a square with a fountain at the centre. It’s first seen in the first episode of season one, when Emily uploads her first ‘Emily in Paris’ Instagram post, a selfie taken in her new apartment (more specifically, the building is on rue des Fossés Saint-Jacques), with a view of the pretty street below visible through the window. This is, of course, the building that forbidden love interest Gabriel also lives in, with Gabriel’s restaurant right across the square.\n\nVisit: You can find Place de l’Estrapade at 75005 Paris, France. It’s private property, though, so you can’t explore the inside.\n\nGabriel’s Restaurant: Terra Nera\n\nGabriel’s restaurant is a real place, the Terra Nera Italian restaurant which is well accustomed to hosting Emily in Paris fans. Likewise, Emily’s frequent cafe haunt, Café de la Nouvelle Mairie, is right here along with her favourite bakery, La Boulangerie Moderne; brimming with delicious baked goods and fresh bread, it was a popular tourist spot even before Netflix got their hands on it. Nearby is Jardin du Luxembourg, another Emily haunt, and a classic Parisian sight.\n\nVisit: You can find Terra Nera at 18 Rue des Fossés Saint-Jacques, 75005 Paris, France. Book your table at terranera.fr\n\nSavoir Office: Place de Valois\n\nThe Savoir office is situated in Place de Valois in the first arrondissement, frequently featured when Emily comes bustling into work in her signature bright, garish, and un-Parisian outfits. Situated close to the Louvre, Place de Valois is a 30 minute walk from Place de l’Estrapade, making it the perfect stop off for fans looking to tick off all of the filming locations. Reward yourself with a drink at the Bistro Valois, one of Savoir’s favoured post-work bars.\n\nVisit: You can find Place de Valois at 75001 Paris, France.\n\nCamille’s Family Wine Estate: Le Château de Sonnay\n\nCamille’s family country estate was filmed near Tours on the Le Château de Sonnay estate, though it plays the role of an estate in Champagne. Situated approximately 175 miles from Paris, Sonnay is a well-known wine estate and 13th century château, with its own tours.\n\nVisit: You can find Château de Sonnay at Sonnay, 37500 Cravant-les-Côteaux, France. You can plan your visit at relais-sonnay.fr\n\nSeason 2 Girl’s Holiday: Grand-Hôtel du Cap-Ferrat\n\nEmily travels to the Riviera at the beginning of season 2, accompanied by gal pals Mindy and Camille. They stay in Four Seasons’ magnificent Grand-Hôtel du Cap-Ferrat which, White Lotus style, was used with exclusive use for filming due to Covid restrictions. While on the Riviera, Emily and co also head to Paloma Beach (the real restaurant that plays the part of Laurent’s restaurant), the Chapelle Saint-Pierre, a cute chapel on the harbour in Villefranche, St Tropez where they stroll among the yachts, and visit a party at ‘Ragazzi House’ (the Château Diter in real life), an Italianate palace in Grasse. Read our review of the Grand-Hôtel du Cap-Ferrat here.\n\nPalais Royal\n\nA tranquil oasis in the heart of the city, these regal gardens are where Emily first meets her new friend, Mindy, when Mindy is nannying. Find it at 75001 Paris.\n\nMontmartre & the Sacré-Cœur\n\nBrimming with pretty architecture and restaurants spilling into the streets, Emily and Mindy spend time in the Montmartre area, sampling the coolest places Paris has to offer. The Sacré-Cœur basilica, also featured in the show, is the city’s best spot if you love a panoramic view. Find it at 35 Rue du Chevalier de la Barre, 75018 Paris, France.\n\nLes Pavillons de Bercy\n\nRemember when Emily and friends go partying on fairground rides? Museum by day and hireable event space by night, Les Pavillons de Bercy – a museum of restored, historic fairground rides – features in Emily in Paris.\n\nVisit: Find Les Pavillons de Bercy at 53 Av. des Terroirs de France, 75012 Paris, France. Plan your visit at arts-forains.com\n\nPalais Garnier\n\nA magnificent monument dedicated to Napoleon III, Emily attends the opera here. Find it at Pl. de l’Opéra, 75009 Paris, France.\n\nLe Grand Véfour\n\nOpened in 1784 and situated on rue du Beaujolais, this is one of Paris’ most famous and legendary restaurants, with two Michelin stars and a plethora of sparkly grand mirrors. Emily tries to host a dinner here in episode 4, but a miscommunication lets her down. Instead, the dinner is hosted at saviour Gabriel’s restaurant. Find it at 17 Rue de Beaujolais, 75001 Paris, France.\n\nCafé de Flore\n\nOne of Paris’ oldest coffeehouses, famed for attracting high profile writers and philosophers, features in the first season of Emily in Paris, when Emily meets short-lived love interest, Thomas. Find it at 172 Bd Saint-Germain, 75006 Paris, France.\n\nPont Alexandre III\n\nRom-com buffs will recognise this filming location from Woody Allen’s Midnight in Paris as well as Emily in Paris, which uses this ornate, Beaux-Arts bridge as the filming location for the naked perfume ad for De L’Heure.
