        "text": "Midnight in Paris\n\nThis topic contains:\n\noverall comments and recommendations\n\ndetails of classification and consumer advice lines for Midnight in Paris\n\na review of Midnight in Paris completed by the Australian Council on Children and the Media (ACCM) on 25 October 2011.\n\nOverall comments and recommendations\n\nAbout the movie\n\nThis section contains details about the movie, including its classification by the Australian Government Classification Board and the associated consumer advice lines. Other classification advice (OC) is provided where the Australian film classification is not available.\n\nACCM review\n\nThis review of the movie contains the following information:\n\na synopsis of the story\n\nthemes\n\nuse of violence\n\nmaterial that may scare or disturb children\n\nproduct placement\n\nsexual references\n\nnudity and sexual activity\n\nuse of substances\n\ncoarse language\n\nthe movie’s message\n\nA synopsis of the story\n\nMidnight in Paris is a visually beautiful film that tells the story of Gil (Owen Wilson) and Inez (Rachel McAdams) an American couple who travel Paris with her parents. Gil, a successful Hollywood screenwriter, is eager to find a more meaningful expression for his literary talents and has begun writing his first novel. He is wildly in love with Paris and jumps at the chance to go with Inez and her parents on an unplanned trip. Inez however is less enthusiastic about Paris, and when she bumps into friends of hers she seizes the opportunity to spend time socialising with them.\n\nWhile Inez parties and visits tourist attractions with her American friends, Gil walks the streets alone, soaking in the sounds, sights and feel of Paris and finding inspiration for the novel he is writing. One evening Gil stumbles into a piece of Paris’s history and meets some of his literary idols from the 1920’s. His magical experiences help bring clarity and direction for his life, both personally and professionally, and force him and Inez to face the truth about their relationship.\n\nRelationship breakdown, infidelity\n\nThere is some mild violence in this movie including the following examples:\n\nErnest Hemingway who has drunk a lot of alcohol, stands up at a party and asks “Who wants to fight?”\n\nDuring one scene a character becomes drunk and, thinking that her husband no longer loves her, threatens to drown herself\n\nMaterial that may scare or disturb children\n\nNo additional scenes of concern\n\nNo additional scenes of concern\n\nNo additional scenes of concern\n\nnone of concern\n\nProduct placement\n\nThe following products are displayed or used in this movie:\n\nMoet\n\nDior\n\nSexual references\n\nThere are some sexual references in this movie, including:\n\nOne of the characters makes reference to Adriana being in love with Gil, and talks of Adriana’s past sexual encounters with other men.\n\nInez admits she has been unfaithful and spent a number of nights with another man.\n\nNudity and sexual activity\n\nThere is some sexual activity in this movie, including:\n\nGil and Inez kiss on their hotel bed.\n\nGil and Adriana kiss.\n\nUse of substances\n\nThere is quite a lot of use of substances in this movie, including:\n\nMany characters throughout the movie are seen drinking, often to excess. The scenes that depict 1920s Paris include significant alcohol use by many of the main characters with characters seen acting in an erratic manner due to their alcohol use. Other characters are seen drinking wine at almost all meals and occasions.\n\nMany characters are seen smoking throughout this movie.\n\nCoarse language\n\nThere is some coarse language in this movie, including:\n\nhell\n\nOh my God\n\ndamn\n\nIn a nutshell\n\nMidnight in Paris, directed by Woody Allen, is a whimsical romantic comedy likely to be enjoyed by adults. It lacks interest for children who will not recognise the historical characters, and contains some sexual references and frequent drinking and smoking.\n\nThe main messages from this movie are about being true to yourself, and not sacrificing the things that make you happy just to please other people.\n\nThis movie could also give parents the opportunity to discuss with their children attitudes and behaviours, and their real-life consequences, such as:\n\nTrust and honesty - How important are they in relationships? Did Gil and Inez trust each other? How would honesty have helped their relationship?"
