Midnight in Paris: Full Beat Sheet

ACT I

Sequence I: Establishing the beauty of Paris and Gil’s infatuation with the city. His wife, Inez, does not share his enthusiasm.

1 – OPENING IMAGES: Paris. Present day.

3 – Paris in and after the rain.

4 – Paris at night.

5 – Overlooking Monet’s Gardens, GIL PENDER pontificates on his love with Paris. His wife, INEZ, seems indifferent to his enthusiasm.

GIL

This is unbelievable. Look at this. There’s no city like this in the world. There never was!

INEZ

You act like you’ve never been here before.

GIL

I don’t get here often enough. That’s the problem. Can you picture how drop dead gorgeous this city is in the rain? Imagine this town in the twenties. Paris in the twenties. In the rain. The artists and the writers.

INEZ

Why does every city have to be in the rain? What’s wonderful about getting wet?

You could ever picture us moving here after we’re married?

INEZ

Oh God, no. I could never live out of the United States.

GIL

You know, if I had stayed here and written novels and not gotten, you know, caught up in that... just grinding out movie scripts. I’ll tell you something: I would drop the house in Beverly Hills, the pool, everything in a second... I mean, look, this is where Monet lived and painted. We’re thirty minutes from town. Imagine the two of us settling here. We could do it. I mean, if my book turns out...

INEZ

You’re in love with a fantasy.

GIL

I’m in love with you.

__________________________________________

Sequence II: Gil doesn’t seem to fit in with Inez’s parents or her friends, Paul and Carol, who invite them on a tour of Versailles. On the trip, Inez reveals the difficulties Gil’s having with his new novel to Paul, who, in turn, pompously ridicules its theme and the people it appeals to. Inez seems to admire and respect Paul’s intellect.

6 – Gil and Inez meet with her parents, JOHN and HELEN. Gil is the only one who seems enthusiastic about the city.

7 – Over lunch, Inez’s father reveals he’s in Paris on a new business venture and that he doesn’t care for French politics.

GIL

You can’t exactly blame them for not following us down that rabbit’s hole in Iraq. With the whole Bush --

INEZ

Oh, please. Let’s not get into that --

GIL

No, honey, we’re not getting in... by the way, it’s fine for your father and I to disagree. That’s what a democracy is. Your father defends the right wing of the republican party and I happen to think you’ve almost gotta be...like a demented lunatic, but --

INEZ

Okay, okay.

GIL

That doesn’t mean we don’t respect each other’s views.

(to John)

Am I right?

Looking Gil dead in the eye, John remains silent.

7 – Two friends from the states, PAUL and CAROL, bump into Gil and Inez at the restaurant.

9 – Gil and Inez argue over spending time with Paul and Carol. Inez admits she used to have a crush on Paul. Gil calls him a “pseudo-intellectual” and Inez defends Paul. Further, Inez suggests Paul should critique Gil’s novel, as he’s having difficulty with it.

INEZ

Gil, honey, just promise me something. If this book doesn’t pan out, that you’ll stop beating your brains out and just go back to doing what you do best. The studios adore you, you’re in demand. Do you really want to give it all up just to struggle?

10 – Touring Versailles with Paul and Carol, Inez, much to Gil’s dismay, reveals the difficulty and uncertainly Gil’s having with his new novel. She goes further to explain Gil’s obsession with Paris in the twenties…

PAUL

You know, nostalgia is denial. Denial of the painful present.

INEZ

Oh, Gil is a complete romantic. He would be more than happy living in a complete state of perpetual denial.

PAUL

And the name of this fallacy is called “golden-aged thinking.”

INEZ

Touche.

PAUL

The erroneous notion that a different time period is better than the one one’s living in. It’s a flaw in the romantic imagination of those people who find it difficult to cope with the present.

12 – Inez and her mother fantasize about the attention Inez’s wedding ring will garner. Helen brings up Gil and his obsession with Paris. Inez firmly believes he won’t ever move, that he just likes to talk about it. Unfortunately, that’s exactly what Helen’s worried about.

14 – With Inez and Gil in tow, Paul argues with their GUIDE over whether Rodin’s wife was Camille or Rose. Paul firmly believes Camille was Rodin’s wife (he is wrong). Gil sides with the Guide even though he hasn’t a clue.

__________________________________________

Sequence III: Opting for a walk instead of dancing with Paul, Carol, and Inez, Gil wanders Paris at night and gets lost. He finds a place to rest, and at midnight, gets inside an old car that transports him to the 1920’s. There, he meets Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald, as well as Ernest Hemingway, who offers to give Gil’s new novel to Gertrude Stein.

15 – A bit drunk after a wine tasting, Paul and Carol invite Gil and Inez dancing. Gil prefers a walk, even though Inez wants to go with Paul and Carol. Inez insists on going, so Gil parts with his wife for the evening.

16 – OFFER TO HEMINGWAY SETUP: In Gil’s absence, Paul questions Inez on whether Gil is fit to be a novelist or not. She claims Gil has not let anyone — herself included — read his novel. Paul says he’d be happy to critique it for him. Inez agrees, believing that’s exactly what Gil needs.

INEZ

The problem is, when it comes to his writing, he has absolutely no respect for anybody else’s opinion.

17 – After walking a bit too far, Gil’s lost.

18 – INCITING INCIDENT: On a quiet block, Gil rests on some steps as a clock strikes midnight. An old car pulls to a stop. Its passengers invite Gil for a ride. Though reluctant at first, Gil accepts.

19 – In the car, everyone is dressed from another period. They insist Gil drink. He doesn’t put up much of a fight.

20 – Arriving at a party, Gil notices everyone is dressed from the twenties. A piano man sings Cole Porter’s “Let’s Fall In Love” just like Cole Porter.

21 – A woman with a thick Southern accent approaches Gil, claiming he seems out of place. She gets out of him that he’s a writer before her husband shows up. They introduce themselves as SCOTT & ZELDA FITZGERALD.

23 – Scott and Zelda invite Gil to Bricktops. Gil accepts.

23 – Gil and The Fitzgeralds watch someone dance that looks like Josephine Baker….

INT. BRICKTOP’S CLUB – NIGHT

The group is watching someone like Josephine Baker. Gil is stunned by it all. The Fitzgerald’s drink a lot.

24 – Gil is drunk at Bricktops, not quite sure what’s happening to him.

25 – At Vins Fins Liquor, Scott introduces Gil to ERNEST HEMINGWAY.

25 – Probing Hemingway for his opinion on her latest work, Hemingway insults Zelda’s writing and she leaves Scott with the writers. Not long after a little ribbing from Hemingway, Scott chases after her.

27 – Hemingway questions Gil about his novel. Gil tells of a protagonist who works in a nostalgia shop. When Hemingway asks what a nostalgia shop is, Gil questions the choice. Hemingway immediately chimes in…

HEMINGWAY

No subject is terrible if the story is true, and if the prose is clean and honest, and if it affirms courage and grace under pressure.

28 – OFFER TO HEMINGWAY PAYOFF: Gil asks Hemingway to read his novel, but Hemingway declines.

GIL

Would you read it?

HEMINGWAY

Your novel?

GIL

It’s only about four hundred pages – if you could just give me your opinion.

HEMINGWAY

My opinion is that I hate it.

GIL

You do?

HEMINGWAY

If it’s bad I’ll hate it because I hate bad writing and if it’s good I’ll be envious and hate it all the more. You don’t want the opinion of another writer.

28 – END OF ACT ONE TURN: Hemingway offers to have Gertrude Stein read Gil’s novel, as she’s the only one he trusts with his writing. Hemingway asks for Gil’s novel and Gil immediately leaves to go get it.

29 – Down the street, Gil realizes he never arranged a place to meet Hemingway. Walking back to the bar, Gil finds a laundry mat in its place: He’s back in the present day.

ACT II-A

Sequence I: Hemingway introduces Gil to Gertrude Stein, who agrees to critique his novel. She reads the first paragraph aloud. Gil’s words capture the interest of the beautiful Adriana, Pablo Picasso’s lover. Gil discovers Adriana has a love for the past as he does.

30 – Morning. Back at the hotel, Gil attempts to talk with Inez about his evening with the Fitzgeralds and Hemingway, but she dismisses it as “idle chatter” and insists he get ready. Gil tells her he wishes to stay and work on his novel, but Inez demands he get up and go with her.

31 – Gil shops for furniture with Inez and Helen. When Helen attempts to talk Inez into purchasing a chair for 18,000 euros, Gil says they are cutting back on expenses so he doesn’t have to “take any crummy rewrite jobs.” Helen seems offended, saying “cheap is cheap” and “you get what you pay for” as she walks away.

32 – PARIS IN THE RAIN SETUP: Leaving the shop, it begins to rain. Gil attempts to talk Inez into walking home with him in the rain, but she declines, saying, “there’s nothing beautiful about walking in the rain.”

32 – Carrying his manuscript, Gil takes Inez to the steps where the car transported him before.

33 – Inez grows impatient and tired, and leaves Gil alone.

34 – The clock strikes midnight and the old car appears again. Hemingway’s inside this time.

35 – In the car, Hemingway talks about war and death.

HEMINGWAY

You’ll never write well if you fear dying. Do you?

GIL

Yeah, I do. I’d say it’s probably... might be my greatest fear, actually.

HEMINGWAY

Well, it’s something all men before you have done and all men will do.

GIL

I know. I know.

HEMINGWAY

Have you ever made love to a truly great woman?

GIL

Actually, my fiancé is pretty sexy.

HEMINGWAY

And when you make love to her you feel true and beautiful passion, and you, for at least for that moment, you lose your fear of death?

GIL

No. That doesn’t happen.

HEMINGWAY

I believe that love that is true and real creates a respite from death. All cowardice comes from not loving or not loving well, which is the same thing. When a man who is brave and true looks death squarely in the face, like some rhino hunters I know, or Bellmonte, who is truly brave, it is because they love with sufficient passion to push death out of their minds. Until it returns, as it does to all men, and then you must make really good love again. Think about it.

37 – Hemingway introduces Gil to GERTRUDE STEIN, currently in the middle of critiquing PABLO PICASSO’s latest work, a painting of his lover, ADRIANA.

STEIN

Look what he’s done to her – dripping with sexual innuendo. Carnal to the point of smoldering and yes she’s beautiful but it’s a subtle beauty – an implied sensuality.

(to Gil)

What is your first impression of Adriana?

GIL

(very taken)

..... Exceptionally lovely.

38 – FIRST TRIAL: Gil hands over his novel to Stein, who reads the first paragraph aloud. Adriana reacts first, saying she’s hooked.

39 – Gil approaches Adriana…

GIL

Did my opening lines really get to you that strongly?

ADRIANA

The past has always had a great charisma for me.

39 – Gil discovers Adriana has a love for the past as he does. Her perfect time was Belle Epoque.

__________________________________________

Sequence II: Later, at the L’Orangerie Museum, Gil corrects Paul on the facts surrounding Picasso’s painting of Adriana.

44 – Out shopping with Inez and her mother, Gil hears an old Cole Porter tune playing on a record. He speaks briefly with a woman named GABRIELLE, who also shares a passion for Porter, before Inez interrupts and whisks them away to their next destination.

45 – At the L’Orangerie Museum, Paul, Carol, Inez and Gil are in the circular room with the large Monet painting. Gil attempts to join the conversation, but Inez silences him in effort to let Paul educate them on Monet.

46 – COMBAT: In another area, the group stumbles upon the Picasso’s painting of Adriana….

PAUL

If I’m not mistaken he painted this marvelous portrait of his French mistress Madeline Brissou in the twenties.

GIL

Er – I have to differ with you on this one.

PAUL

Really?

INEZ

Gil pay attention and you’ll learn something.

GIL

If I’m not mistaken this was a failed attempt to capture a young French girl named Adriana – from Bordeaux – if my art history serves me – came to Paris to study costume design for the theatre. Believe she had a brief affair with Modigliani – then Braque – that’s where Pablo met her – er Picasso. You’d never know it from this portrait but she’s quite subtly beautiful.

__________________________________________

Sequence III: Gil gets closer to Adriana, but reveals his engagement to Inez after preventing Zelda Fitzgerald from killing herself. Adriana declines his invitation to walk her home.

47 – GIL FOLLOWED SETUP: At dinner with her parents, Inez rushes to finish because she’s going dancing with Paul. Gil is off on “one of his walks” and Carol is recovering from food sickness. She leaves and John indicates interest in having Gil followed.

JOHN

Where does Gil go every night?

HELEN

You heard her. He walks and gets ideas.

JOHN

I don’t know. I see what he earns but sometimes I think he’s got a part missing. And I didn’t like his remark about tea party Republicans. They’re decent people who want to take back the country...

HELEN

Nevertheless I hardly think your idea of having him followed is practical.

JOHN

No? I’d like to know where he goes every night.

HELEN

Well we know one thing – he doesn’t go dancing.

49 – Out dancing, Gil bumps into Adriana. She takes Gil to an old carousel from the turn of the century, caught up in its beauty. She reveals she has broken up with Picasso.

52 – Gil and Adriana walk Paris together.

GIL

There’s no book or painting, or symphony or sculpture that can rival a great city. All these streets and boulevards are a special art form. When you think in the cold, violent, meaningless universe Paris exists – these lights – I mean nothing’s happening on Jupiter or Neptune or out beyond – but from way out in space you can see these lights in whole dark void – the cafes, people drinking and dancing – I mean for all we know this is the hottest spot in the entire universe.

54 – Walking alongside the river, Gil and Adriana stop Zelda Fitzgerald from committing suicide. Gil assures Zelda that Scott loves her and gives her a Valium.

ZELDA

What is this?

GIL

A Valium – it’ll calm you down.

ADRIANA

Only since Inez and I became engaged. I’ve had these anxiety attacks – I’m sure after the wedding they’ll subside.

ZELDA

I never heard of Valium. What is this?

GIL

Er – it’s the pill of the future.

55 – At a Bohemian Cafe, Adriana confronts Gil over his upcoming marriage…

ADRIANA

You never said you were getting married.

GIL

Yes – I – I mean it’s in the future.

ADRIANA

Well good luck with your book and your wedding.

GIL

You’d like Inez – she has a sharp sense of humor – and she’s sexy – not that we agree on everything.

ADRIANA

But the important things.

GIL

Actually the small things – the important things we don’t – she’d like to live in Malibu and that I’d work in Hollywood – but I will say we both like – er – er Indian food – not all Indian food – pita bread – we both like pita bread.

55 – MIDPOINT: Adriana walks out of the cafe, politely refusing Gil’s offer to walk her home.

57 – At the cafe, Gil chats with SALVADOR DALI, MAN RAY, and LUIS BUNUEL.

DALI

Pender is in perplexing situation.

GIL

It sounds so crazy when I say it and you’ll think I’m drunk but I’ve got to tell someone I’m from a different time – a whole other era – the future – and I pass from the two thousandth millennium to here – a car picks me up – I slide through time –

MAN RAY

Exactly correct – you inhabit two worlds – so far I see nothing strange.

GIL

Look, you’re surrealists – but I’m a normal guy – See, in one life I’m engaged to marry a woman I love – at least I think I love her. Christ, I’m supposed to love her if I’m marrying her.

DALI

The rhinoceros makes love by mounting the female – but is there difference in beauty between two rhinoceroses?

MAN RAY

There is another woman?

GIL

Adriana is her name. And I felt drawn to her – but it wouldn’t matter – men much greater than me, profound artists – she’s drawn to geniuses – and they to her.

MAN RAY

A man in love with a woman from a different era. I see a photograph.

BUNEL

I see a film.

GIL

I see an insurmountable problem.

DALI

I see – a rhinoceros.

ACT II-B

Sequence I: Gil questions the Guide from the Rodin Museum Garden over the loves of Rodin’s life. Inez’s father hires a private investigator to shadow Gil. Stein offers her first critique of Gil’s work, saying he must not be such a defeatist.

59 – At the hotel room, Inez eats breakfast after her shower. Gil makes sexual advances, but she rejects them, putting more importance on their upcoming lunch with Paul and Carol.

60 – At the Rodin Museum Garden, Gil tracks down the Guide from their previous visit. He asks her about Rodin and his mistress, posing the question, “Is it possible to be in love with two women?” The Guide replies that Rodin “loved both in different ways.”

61 – GIL FOLLOWED PAYOFF: John meets with DUBOIS, a private investigator, regarding Gil. John wants to be certain Gil is not cheating on his daughter. Dubois puts TISSERANT on the case.

61 – Gil gets into the car at midnight, this time gets to chat with TS ELLIOT. Tisserant observes.

62 – Stopping by Stein’s place, Stein reveals Adriana has left Picasso for Hemingway.

63 – Stein comments on Gil’s book, offering advice…

STEIN

Now about your book. Very unusual indeed. In a way it’s almost science fiction. We all fear death and question our place in the universe. It’s the artist’s job not to succumb to despair but to find an antidote to the emptiness of existence. I find your voice clear and lively – don’t be such a defeatist.

__________________________________________

Sequence II: Gil thumbs through an old diary from a book market, only to discover it was Adriana’s. The Guide from the Rodin Museum Garden translates it for him: Adriana was attracted to him. An excerpt reveals she had a dream where he bought her earrings and then they made love.

63 – As they load their car outside the hotel, Inez reveals to her parents that Gil will not be joining them for their weekend getaway.

65 – Gil walks back to the market and buys a Cole Porter record from Gabrielle.

65 – At a book market, Gil buys an old diary. The screenplay reveals what the film initially does not: “This diary belongs to Adriana Dupree.”

66 – At the Notre Dame Garden, the Guide translates Adriana’s diary for Gil.

GUIDE

I’m in love with an American writer I just met named Gil Pender.

His eyes widen.

GUIDE

(continuing)

That immediate magic one hears about happened to me. I know that both Picasso and Hemingway are in love with me but for whatever inexplicable reasons the heart has, I am drawn to Gil. Perhaps because he seems naive and unassuming. As always in this sad life he is about to marry a woman named Inez. I had a dream where he came to me and brought me a little gift – earrings they were – and we made love.

__________________________________________

Sequence III: Gil narrowly avoids Inez’s wrath after attempting to take her earrings for Adriana. He ultimately buys Adriana a new pair. Traveling back, he gives his latest rewrite to Stein, who informs Gil that Adriana would like to see him. Gil finds Adriana and later, they kiss. She calls his gift of earrings “remarkable.”

67 – Back at the hotel, Gil steals a pair of Inez’s earrings and puts them inside a small box.

68 – Moments before Gil leaves, Inez and her parents come back: They had to cut their trip short because John complained of chest pains.

INEZ

Why are you so dressed up?

GIL

Me? No – I was just writing.

INEZ

You dress and put on cologne to write?

GIL

I took a break and showered. I think better in the shower. All those positive ions.

69 – INEZ HATES GIL’S GIFTS SETUP: Inez spots the box in Gil’s hand. He tells her it’s her gift, but for a special occasion. She hopes it’s not jewelry, because Gil doesn’t always understand her taste.

70 – Inez searches for her pearl earrings (then ones Gil wrapped for Adriana), but can’t find them. Her mother suggests ones of the hotel maids stole them and Inez calls the hotel to report a theft. Gil begs her to not report the maid, but only angers Inez. The doctor comes in and interrupts their argument.

71 – While the doctor examines John, Gil runs to the bedroom and magically discovers the earrings.

72 – ASSUMPTION OF POWER: Gil goes to the market and buys earrings from a vendor.

72 – Tisserant follows Gil, observing him leave inside the car again.

72 – Gil drops off the first few chapters into his rewrite to Stein. She informs him that Adriana’s relationship with both Hemingway and Picasso is over. She tells Gil where Adriana is, telling him “she’ll be glad to see you.”

73 – Gil approaches Adriana at wedding for artist types. He doesn’t waste time getting to what’s on his mind…

GIL

Let’s just say as a writer I see into women’s souls and I sense that you have very complicated feelings towards me.

ADRIANA

But you’re going to be married.

75 – At a “romantic locale,” Gil kisses Adriana

ADRIANA

What are you doing?

GIL

I don’t know but I do know that for a brief moment, when I was doing it, I felt – immortal.

ADRIANA

But – you look so sad.

GIL

Because life is too mysterious for me.

ADRIANA

It’s the time we live in. Everything moves so fast – life is noisy and complicated – not like the Belle Epoque. In those years Paris lived only for beauty.

GIL

I’ve always been a logical person. I never took chances – did anything crazy – like move here when I first came or take a shot at being a real writer, not a Hollywood hired hand – but I feel like letting everything go.

76 – INEZ HATES GIL’S GIFTS PAYOFF: Gil gives Adriana earrings. She calls them “remarkable.”

__________________________________________

Sequence IV: Gil and Adriana travel back to the 1890’s, to the Belle Epoque. They visit Moulin Rouge and talk with artists who believe the Renaissance was the best era. When Adriana pulls Gil aside and informs him of her intent to stay in the 1890’s, Gil elects to leave her for the future.

77 – Gil and Adriana take an old carriage with two people dressed from the Belle Epoque and end up transported to the 1890’s.

78 – Gil and Adriana slow dance at Maxims.

79 – Gil and Adriana watch the girls at Moulin Rouge.

83 – END OF ACT TWO TURN: Adriana pulls Gil aside and tells him she wants to stay in the 1890’s.

84 – Gil confesses he came from 2010 and his doubts of their relationship.

GIL

Last night I dreamed I ran out of Zithromax – and then I went to the dentist and there was no Novocain – these people have no antibiotics –

ADRIANA

What are you talking about?

GIL

And even in the twenties – no dishwashers – no 911 if your appendix bursts – no “movies on demand.”

ADRIANA

But if we love act other what does it matter when we live?

GIL

Because if you stay here and this becomes your present, sooner or later you’ll imagine another time was really the golden time. And so will I – I’m beginning to see why it can’t work, Adriana. The present has a hold on you because it’s your present and while there’s never any progress in the most important things, you get to appreciate – what little progress is made – the internet – Pepto-Bismol. The present is always going to seem unsatisfying because life itself is unsatisfying – that’s why Gauguin goes back and forth between Paris and Tahiti, searching – it’s my job as a writer to try and come up with reasons why despite life being tragic and unsatisfying, it’s still worth it.

ADRIANA

That’s the problem with writers – you’re all so full of words – but I’m more emotional. I’m going to stay and live in Paris’ most glorious time. You made a choice to leave Paris once and you regretted it.

GIL

Yes, that one I regretted but it was a real choice and I made the wrong one. This is a choice between accepting reality or surreal insanity.

ADRIANA

So finally you do love Inez more than me.

GIL

No – I love you – but this way lies madness – and if I’m ever going to write anything worthwhile I’ve got to get rid of my illusions and that I’d be happier in the past is one of them.

ADRIANA

Goodbye, Gil.

GIL

Goodbye, Adriana.

They kiss, she turns and goes to the table of artists.

84 – DECISION: Gil decides the present is where he needs to be.

ACT III

Sequence I: Traveling back one last time, Gertrude Stein praises Gil’s novel. She tells him Hemingway read it and offered a suggestion: the protagonist must realize his wife is having an affair. Gil then confronts Inez over her affair with Paul, which she admits to. Gil leaves Inez, electing to stay in Paris and not return home.

85 – Back at Gertrude Stein’s, Stein praises Gil’s novel. She informs him Hemingway read it and made a suggestion…

STEIN

Hemingway finds it hard to believe the protagonist doesn’t see his fiancee is having an affair that’s going on right before his eyes.

GIL

With –

STEIN

The other character – the pedantic one –

GIL

It’s called denial. Thank you.

86 – POINT OF NO RETURN: Gil coerces Inez into confessing her affair with Paul.

INT. HOTEL SUITE – DAY

Gil back in present in mid-argument with Inez.

INEZ

You’re crazy – Paul and me? Where did you get such an insane notion?

GIL

From Ernest Hemingway. He thought it out and it makes perfect sense.

INEZ

Gil, your brain tumor’s acting up again.

GIL

There’s nothing crazy about Ernest Hemingway or Gertrude Stein or Fitzgerald or Salvador Dali –

INEZ

Nothing except they’ve all been dead for years.

GIL

It was William Faulkner who said, the past is not dead. In fact, it’s not even past. Actually I ran into Bill Faulkner at a party.

INEZ

You’re a raving lunatic.

GIL

I guess I’m too trusting. I’m jealous and also trusting – cognitive dissonance, Scott Fitzgerald speaks of it.

INEZ

Gil –

GIL

I know it Inez – you can fool me but not Hemingway.

INEZ

Jesus Christ I’m dealing with a madman – okay – Paul and I had a few nights alone. We danced, we drank – you were always working – he’s very attractive, he spoke to me in French – the whole mystique of this corny city got to me – it’s over. We can put this all in perspective at home.

GIL

I’m not going back.

INEZ

What?

GIL

I’m staying here. It’s not the romantic fling. Paris is Paris. It’s that I’m not in love with you.

87 – CLIMAX (external): Gil informs Inez of his intentions to stay in Paris.

87 – In mid-argument, John and Helen enter the room. Inez immediately announces their breakup and her parents couldn’t be more thrilled. Gil leaves the room…

JOHN

I had a private detective follow him – I knew he was up to no good.

INEZ

Daddy you didn’t.

JOHN

I did. He saw him get into a car at midnight each night and he followed close behind.

HELEN

What happened?

JOHN

I don’t know. The detective agency says the detective is missing.

88 – Detective Tisserant enters a period room in Versailles, shocking a COUNT and COUNTESS in midst their breakfast. The countess screams for the guards and Tisserant is chased away.

That’s okay. I don’t mind getting wet. Paris is the most beautiful in the rain.

91 – CLOSING IMAGE: Gil walks Gabrielle home in the rain.
