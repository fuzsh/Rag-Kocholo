Foreign Exchange Depository Group

The origin of the Foreign Exchange Depository (FED) can be traced to a subsection of the Currency Section, Financial Branch, G-5 Division of the Supreme Headquarters, Allied Expeditionary Force (SHAEF), created on September 7, 1944. The primary function of the Currency Section was the receiving, holding, and supplying of occupation currency for Allied Armed Forces and for Military Government operations, but it was also empowered to act as a depository for, and to exercise control over, assets seized or impounded by Allied Military authorities. The Foreign Exchange Depository Field Unit was the Currency Section subsection created to serve as the safe depository. The first shipment of valuables was received at the FED on April 15, 1945. This treasure trove of assets was discovered at the Kaiseroda, or Merkers, salt mine, in Thuringia and consisted of gold bullion, gold and silver coin, platinum, jewelry, and various currencies. Also found was a large quantity of Schutzstaffel (SS) loot. Before the end of 1945, a total of 76 additional shipments of foreign exchange assets were received.

With the dissolution of SHAEF on July 14, 1945, the Currency Section was organized under the G-5 Division of the U.S. Forces, European Theater (USFET). On October 1, 1945, the Office of Military Government, U.S. Zone (OMGUS) recognized the Foreign Exchange Depository Field Unit as an independent agency within its Finance Division. The FED was responsible for the protection, custody, and inventorying of gold and silver bullion, coin, foreign currencies, securities and other assets; took custody and control of zonal currency reserves and allocated and delivered them to local banks as was required; maintained currency accounts; and undertook investigations of counterfeiting. The FED was organized into six sections: Executive, Administrative, Accounts and Reports, Claims, Currency, and Depository.

By early 1946, the operations of the Depository Section, namely the inventorying and examining of the seized assets, had completely stopped due to the lack of adequately qualified personnel. The assets of the Section were temporarily placed under "combat conditions" within the custody of the Currency Section in the name of the Commanding General, USFET. On April 1, 1946, the assets were formally returned to OMGUS, now called the Office of Military Government for Germany (U.S.).

When the OMGUS Finance Division was dissolved effective March 1, 1948, and the Office of Finance Adviser (OFA) was established, the Foreign Exchange Depository Field Unit became the Foreign Exchange Depository Group (FEDG). The FEDG provided banking and depository facilities to the Office of Chief of Finance, European Command for Army transactions requiring indigenous currency, and provided custodial facilities for valuables of German origin that came into the possession of the U.S. Army or Military Government pending disposition through reparations, restitution, return to German claimants, or delivery to successor custodian. Between 1946 and 1949, the FEDG received, stored, inventoried, and disbursed well over $500 million worth of loot and other valuables. Over the course of its development, the custodial, inventory, and accounting functions of the FEDG expanded to include Military Government Law 53 assets, Allied Military Marks, Military Government court fines, Military Payment certificates, Prisoner of War Payments, and assets seized by G-2 Censorship Division. Most assets were disposed by the end of August 1949.

The transition from military to civilian occupation administration was initiated by the Presidential appointment of the U.S. High Commissioner for Germany (HICOG), who assumed his duties on September 2, 1949. On September 3, the functions, personnel, equipment, and records of both the OFA and the Finance Division were transferred to the newly created Finance Division in the Office of Economic Affairs of HICOG, which assumed responsibility for the field of finance, including those of the FEDG. The transition was completed by September 21, the same day of the establishment of the Federal Republic of Germany. OMGUS was formally abolished on December 5, 1949.

The U.S. Allied Commission for Austria (USACA) Section was responsible for civil affairs/military government administration. It was organized concurrently with the establishment of Headquarters, United States Forces Austria (HQ USFA), July 5, 1945, as a component of U.S. Forces, European Theater (USFET). The single position of Commanding General USFA and U.S. High Commissioner for Austria was held successively by General Mark Clark, July 5, 1945–May 16, 1947; and Lieutenant General Geoffrey Keyes [Note 60], May 17, 1947–September 19, 1950. USACA Section provided the U.S. element of organizations comprising the Allied Commission for Austria, the name of four-power occupation administration established by a U.S., British, French, and Soviet agreement, signed July 4, 1945, and made effective July 24, 1945 [Note 61]. USACA Section also administered occupation government in U.S. zone of Austria and U.S. sector of Vienna. USACA Section was abolished following transfer of U.S. occupation government from military to civilian authority, marked by the Presidential appointment of Walter J. Donnelly as Envoy (later Ambassador) to Austria and U.S. High Commissioner for Austria, effective September 20, 1950. Donnelly was succeeded by Ambassador Llewelyn E. Thompson, Jr., July 17, 1952. U.S. occupation government in Austria officially terminated July 27, 1955, the date of the entrance into force of the State Treaty for the Re-establishment of an Independent and Democratic Austria, signed May 15, 1955.
