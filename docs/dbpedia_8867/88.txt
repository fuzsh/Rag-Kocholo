From the Pockets of the Greatest Generation and Into Your Collection!

Can you imagine holding actual Allied Military notes in your hand that may have been used by your father, grandfather or some other brave American soldier from the Greatest Generation who served overseas during World War II? Now you can with this fantastic 8-piece set of vintage Allied Military Currency notes that circulated in Europe and Japan during and immediately after the Second World War!

Why the special currency? Well, imagine if you will what the local economies were like following the devastation wrought by the most horrific war in human history. Millions of people were dead or missing, cities were left in ruins and monetary systems were in shambles. Seeing the economic catastrophe unfolding before them, the Allied powers led by the United States, France, Great Britain, China and the Soviet Union issued special military currency for Allied troops to use in liberated or newly occupied countries. The notes were issued to soldiers at a fixed rate of exchange and were declared legal tender in occupied areas by local commanders. Just as easily, they could be declared obsolete and removed from circulation.

This eight-piece collection consists of paper currency that circulated in France, Germany, Italy, Japan and Austria. What’s also interesting is that most of the notes were printed by the United States Bureau of Engraving and Printing due to America’s unscathed economy and infrastructure. Each note is in Circulated condition, and the entire collection comes housed in a portfolio that includes a storycard and Certificate of Authenticity.
