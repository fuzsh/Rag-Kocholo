        "text": "Biden argues against 'America First' ideology\n\nCOLLEVILLE-SUR-MER, France — For the most part, Joe Biden’s address marking the 80th anniversary of D-Day sounded like a familiar ode to a historic war victory — but tucked into the speech was a warning to Americans.\n\nBiden name-checked the World War II veterans who sat behind him onstage in wheelchairs, blankets draped over their laps in the early-afternoon chill. He praised their sacrifice in defeating Nazi tyranny. He highlighted the importance of alliances.\n\nBut he slipped in a plea to those who will decide in a few months whether he remains in power: Democracy is a fragile thing, and, all these years later, the battle for its survival is still in doubt.\n\nRead the full story.\n\nThe last living links to D-Day recount their Normandy memories\n\nBÉNOUVILLE, France — The anniversary of D-Day is commemorated annually with solemn ceremonies and grand re-enactments. But this year — the hugely symbolic 80th anniversary since that day of days — it may be the last major milestone for many veterans to recount in their own words the sheer brutality of that pivotal battle.\n\nAround 200 veterans attended this year’s event, the youngest in their 90s and some over 100. And an unavoidable truth, mostly unspoken this week across Normandy, is that the next five-year anniversary will almost certainly look very different.\n\nRead the full story.\n\nZelenskyy thanks U.S. veteran\n\n“You’re the savior of the people,” a U.S. veteran told Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as the two men embraced in Normandy.\n\n“No, no you. You saved Europe,” replied Zelenskyy.\n\nInternational ceremony in full swing on Omaha Beach\n\nOMAHA BEACH, France — The international D-Day ceremony at Omaha Beach is now in full swing, with musical and dance performances playing out on a wide stage, and paratroopers landing on the beach as other personnel play the bagpipes. Macron is expected to speak later in the event.\n\nKing Charles tells veteran who asked about his health that he's 'doing well'\n\nKing Charles told a D-Day veteran at a commemoration event in Normandy on Thursday that he was \"doing well.\"\n\nInside a tent where tea and cakes were being served, Ronald Hendrey, 98, of Clacton-on-Sea, asked Charles about his health.\n\nCharles, 75, recently resumed public duties after he was diagnosed with an unspecified form of cancer in February. Doctors discovered the disease after he was hospitalized with an enlarged prostate, although the palace says that he does not have prostate cancer.\n\n“He was very nice, he listened to what I was saying and took it in,” Hendrey told Britain's Press Association news agency. “I asked him how he was doing, he told me he is doing well.”\n\nBiden and more than 20 world leaders arrive at international commemoration\n\nOMAHA BEACH, France — World leaders, including Biden and Macron, have now arrived at the international D-Day ceremony on Omaha Beach, an event attended by some 25 heads of state and 4,500 spectators.\n\nUkraine’s Volodymyr Zelenskyy is among those attending, seen chatting with a number of World War II veterans onstage and embracing them after arriving. Despite Moscow’s pivotal role in WWII, the Russian delegation was uninvited to this week’s events, its presence deemed untenable because of Russia’s ongoing invasion of Ukraine.\n\nHeat beats down on commemorating crowds\n\nCOLLEVILLE-SUR-MER, France — By the time Biden, Macron and dozens of nonagenarian and centenarian veterans took the stage, the chilly morning had morphed into a scorcher.\n\nWith little shade in the bleachers and topiary of the Normandy American Cemetery, many in the crowd resorted to using their programs as makeshift hats. Organizers had warned attendees to bring their own food and water. Nonetheless, the lack thereof on site caused many to burn through their own supplies and visibly wilt in the heat.\n\nThe weather is something the veterans’ caregivers will have been acutely aware of during the ceremony, which was delayed by more than half an hour, with the former troops getting regular health checks throughout their trip.\n\nDespite the thousands-strong crowd, the speeches were received in near total silence, aside from the chirrup of an errant cellphone or the warble of a songbird high up in the pine trees. That pin-drop calm was eventually broken by the chest-rumbling roar of a flypast by four F-35s flying in the “missing wingman” formation.\n\nBiden praises 'astounding' courage of D-Day troops\n\nReporting from PARIS\n\nPARIS — President Joe Biden has praised the “astounding” courage of the troops who fought on D-Day.\n\n“Imagine what they had to come through,” Biden told David Muir, the anchor of “ABC World News Tonight.” “They got off those landing craft, many of them died.”\n\nDescribing their actions as “astounding,” Biden added, “What it says to me is how critical alliances are, how critical alliances are for our security.”\n\nWatch the 21-gun salute in Normandy for 80th anniversary of D-Day\n\nAfter President Joe Biden and his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron paid tribute to American veterans today, the ceremony ended with \"The Last Post.\" A 21-gun salute followed before a moment of silence. Then there was a flypast from F-35 jets in the missing man formation.\n\nWe should all embrace D-Day veterans' story, Tom Hanks tells NBC News\n\nHollywood star Tom Hanks praised D-Day veterans, telling NBC News their story is part of “the enlightenment that we should all embrace.”\n\n“The day is going to come where the last veteran of World War II is going to go and perhaps that might be the last veteran of D-Day. And when it happens the good news is that their story will have been told by them,” he told Peter Alexander, NBC News' chief White House correspondent.\n\n“We have then a record of people who brought peace to the world, and their story must be told and studied, and it’s an example and it’s part of the enlightenment that we should all embrace,” added the star of “Saving Private Ryan.”\n\nHanks said the D-Day commemorations gave people the opportunity to think about “why in the world were there a bunch of American soldiers over here when they could have stayed home?”\n\n“I’ll tell you, it’s because we’re a democracy and we’re an example to the rest of the world and we have always lived by the credo that sooner or later right-minded people had to get together and do the right thing,” he said.\n\n“Coming here in 1944 was not about claiming territory or getting rich or maintaining a status quo. It was actually about ensuring the future of the world,” he added.\n\nHakeem Jeffries talks about ongoing fight for freedom\n\nReporting from COLLEVILLE-SUR-MER, France\n\nCOLLEVILLE-SUR-MER, France — House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries told NBC News the generation that gave us the \"wonderful gift\" of having protected democracy and freedom needs to be cherished and remembered \"always and forever.\"\n\n\"It’s solemn it’s sober to be here, to give our respect to the people who paid the ultimate sacrifice in defense of America, American values, the free world democracy, all of which we have to fight hard to keep going,\" he said, speaking at the Normandy American Cemetery.\n\nEurope and the world are caught in an \"existential struggle\" between democracy and autocracy, he added. \"Which is why I want to continue to stand on the side of Ukraine, both because of Ukraine’s existential struggle against Russian aggression, but also what it means in terms of freedom and democracy throughout the world,\" Jeffries said.\n\nAmerican veteran dies while traveling to attend D-Day memorial in Normandy\n\nRobert “Al” Persichitti, an American veteran, died as he made a trip last week to attend the 80th anniversary of D-Day landing.\n\nPersichitti, who was from New York, was 102.\n\nAlong with his guardian, Persichitti flew to Germany and they were on a ship sailing down the coast to Normandy when he had a medical emergency, NBC affiliate WHEC-TV reported.\n\nHe was airlifted to a hospital in Germany but later died, veterans traveling with him confirmed to the station.\n\nPersichitti was a radioman on the command ship USS Eldorado, and served in the Pacific Theatre, Iwo Jima, Okinawa and Guam, the station said.\n\nOfficial ceremony ends with taps\n\nCOLLEVILLE-SUR-MER, France — The official ceremony involving Biden, Macron and other dignitaries finishes with the playing of taps, a traditional military bugle call marking the end of the day.\n\nBiden: 'Democracy is never guaranteed'\n\nCOLLEVILLE-SUR-MER, France — Biden stresses the importance of alliances during his remarks in Normandy.\n\n“Here we proved that the ideas of democracy are stronger than any army or combination of armies in the entire world,” he says. “We proved something else as well: the unbreakable unity of the allies.”\n\nHe goes on to praise NATO’s strength and unity, drawing an implicit contrast with his Republican rival, Donald Trump, who aides say considered withdrawing from NATO.\n\nBiden also works in a mention of Ukraine’s war with Russia.\n\n“The struggle between dictatorship and freedom is unending. Here in Europe we see one stark example. Ukraine has been invaded by a tyrant bent on domination,” he says. “We cannot let what happened here be lost in the silence of the years to come. We must remember it, honor it and live it.”\n\n“Democracy is never guaranteed,” he adds.\n\nBiden name-checks some of the individual veterans attending the ceremony\n\nCOLLEVILLE-SUR-MER, France — Biden name-checks some of the individual veterans who are attending the ceremony and recounting what they did during the war.\n\nHe mentions a woman who was an aircraft mechanic during the war and helped keep planes flying. He also singles out a member of the Tuskegee Airmen who is here.\n\nBiden and Macron at Normandy American Cemetery memorial service\n\nBiden stands with first lady Jill Biden, French President Emmanuel Macron and his wife, Brigitte Macron, at the American Cemetery and Memorial in Colleville-sur-Mer, France, today.\n\nBiden commissions challenge coin to honor D-Day veterans and their families\n\nReporting from PARIS\n\nPARIS — Biden has commissioned a challenge coin to honor those who served on D-Day and their families, the White House said in a statement today.\n\nThe coin will feature an image of troops approaching the beaches of Normandy and B-17 aircraft flying overhead, the White House said.\n\nThe number 9388 will be etched in the sand on the coin, “representing the number of Americans who remain in Normandy to this day and lie at rest in the cemetery,” the statement added.\n\n'You saved the world,' Austin tells the veterans\n\nAustin gave his thanks to the survivors and those who fell on D-Day, leading to the liberation of Europe and the postwar order that is increasingly under the threat.\n\n\"We thank every Allied worrier who fought for freedom on June 6, 1944,\" he said.\n\n\"Together with our allies, we built peace out of war,\" he added, a piece forged by generation that won the \"bloodiest war in history.\"\n\n\"We must again stand against aggression and tyranny,\" Austin added. \"You saved the world,\" he said to a loud applause from the audience. \"And we must only defend it.\"\n\nBiden speaks to veterans and others at D-Day commemoration\n\nCOLLEVILLE-SUR-MER, France — The audience at the Normandy American Cemetery gives Biden a standing ovation as he is introduced.\n\nThe president takes off his aviator sunglasses before saying: “Hitler and those with him thought democracies were weak.”\n\nBiden said it was an honor to salute the veterans, and then turned to face the veterans seated behind him and did just that, speaking with force and clarity, more so than in his routine speeches from the White House.\n\nAustin: 'Must rally again to defend the open, postwar world of rules, rights and responsibilities'\n\nCOLLEVILLE-SUR-MER, France — Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin honored the veterans gathered in Normandy to commemorate D-Day.\n\n“We still seek a world where aggression is a sin and human rights are sacred and all people can live in freedom. So, we must rally again to defend the open, postwar world of rules, rights and responsibilities,” he told the crowd assembled at the Normandy American Cemetery.\n\n“Those rules protect us. Those rights define us. And those responsibilities summon us once more,” he said.\n\nAustin then turned and saluted the veterans sitting behind his lectern.\n\nU.S. veterans receive Legion of Honor distinctions from Macron\n\nand\n\nPresident Emmanuel Macron is handing out France’s highest honor, Légion d’Honneur (Legion of Honor), to American veterans present at the ceremony as Biden greets them afterward.\n\nThe veterans each stand up, some assisted, to receive the honor.

Unity prevailed then, and true unity can prevail today.”\n\n'You left everything behind and took risks,' France's Macron tells U.S. veterans\n\nThe French leader praised American veterans on the stage by name to thank them individually for their sacrifices.\n\n\"You have come here,\" he said repeatedly.\n\n‘You left everything behind and took risks,’ Macron added, referring to their sacrifices on D-Day.\n\nBidens use headphones for translation of Macron's speech\n\nReporting from COLLEVILLE-SUR-MER, France\n\nCOLLEVILLE-SUR-MER, France — As Macron delivered remarks in French, both Biden and the first lady picked up headphones to hear the English translation.\n\nBiden and Macron stand to attention for French national anthem\n\nReporting from COLLEVILLE-SUR-MER, France\n\nCOLLEVILLE-SUR-MER, France — Biden, Jill Biden, French President Macron and his wife, Brigitte Macron, are now standing to attention for the French national anthem.\n\nBiden is wearing his trademark aviator sunglasses.

The day started out in the low 40s and now, in the early afternoon, there’s still a chill in the air.\n\nA few are bundled up in their wheelchairs, with blankets covering their legs and chest. Uniformed soldiers and attendants are watching over them, making sure they’re keeping warm and adjusting their blankets.\n\nTom Hanks exchanges hellos with excited crowds\n\nReporting from COLLEVILLE-SUR-MER, France\n\nCOLLEVILLE-SUR-MER, France — The surprise guest at the 80th anniversary of the D-Day landings was an actor who, as much as anyone, taught later generations of Americans what happened that morning.\n\nTom Hanks, who starred in the 1998 film, “Saving Private Ryan,” showed up at the American cemetery above Omaha Beach before the formal ceremony began and drew huge crowds as he stopped to give an interview to NBC News.\n\nOnlookers walking the perimeter of the cemetery stopped to gawk at Hanks, creating pedestrian bottlenecks and frustrating cemetery staff members who gently tried to shoo folks along.\n\n“That’s Tom Hanks,” visitors exclaimed. The Hollywood legend, wearing a suit and tie, gracefully exchanged hellos.\n\nA reporter then thanked Hanks for donating a coffee machine to the White House press room.\n\n“Is it worn out yet?” Hanks asked. “It’s probably taken a beating by now. I’ll include some coffee next time.”\n\nEven Hanks seemed awed, though, when he bumped into another guest walking on the grounds: C.Q. Brown, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n\nThe actor thanked Brown for his service and then remarked on what just happened.\n\nParachutes trail smoke over Juno Beach\n\nA Canadian parachutist trails smoke during a ceremony marking the 80th anniversary of D-Day at Juno Beach in Normandy today.\n\nVeterans take to the stage at American Cemetery\n\nReporting from COLLEVILLE-SUR-MER, France\n\nCOLLEVILLE-SUR-MER, France — One by one, D-Day veterans in wheelchairs are arriving on stage at the Normandy American Cemetery, above the Omaha Beach landing site where U.S. troops waded ashore 80 years ago under withering German fire.\n\nA large crowd of visitors has been standing and applauding throughout the procession, as uniformed officers wheel the veterans to their places on stage.

Somber music is playing, interrupted at one point as fighter planes fly overhead in formation.\n\nRecognition for women 'wonderful,' former battleship welder tells NBC News\n\nReporting from COLLEVILLE-SUR-MER, France\n\nCOLLEVILLE-SUR-MER, France — The story of D-Day is often about the men who fought on the beaches and fields of Normandy. Often overlooked is the role played by women away from the front lines.\n\nOne of them is Jeanne Gibson, 98, a “Rosie the Riveter” who was 18 in 1944 and worked as a welder building destroyers at a shipyard in Seattle.\n\nShe told NBC News that she was pleased women were finally getting the recognition they deserved for their crucial war efforts — but after too long a delay.\n\n“There have been parades and all sorts of things for the men — but nothing for the women,” she said at the American Cemetery in Normandy, where she will be part of the ceremony. “So this year it was wonderful.”\n\nBorn in North Dakota and now living in Pinole, California, she was taught to weld in just two weeks. She said her contribution “makes me proud — but I don’t want it to happen again.”\n\n'Let us pray such sacrifice need never be made again,' Britain's King Charles III says\n\nKing Charles III commemorated the sacrifices of more than 22,000 British troops who gave their lives during the D-Day landings and the Battle of Normandy during the special ceremony at the British Normandy Memorial in Ver-sur-Mer this morning.\n\n\"Over the past 40 years, I have had the great privilege of attending seven D-Day commemorations in Normandy and meeting so many distinguished veterans,\" he said.\n\n\"I shall never forget the haunting sights and sounds of thousands of be-medaled figures proudly marching past into a French sunset on these beaches. Our ability to learn from their stories at first hand diminishes. But our obligation to remember them, what they stood for and what they achieved for us all can never diminish,\" Charles added.\n\nHe also expressed his hope that such sacrifices would never be needed to be made again.\n\nBiden meets veterans\n\nBiden spoke with American veterans during a ceremony at the American Cemetery in Colleville-sur-Mer.\n\nTom Hanks speaks to NBC News\n\nNBC News Chief White House Correspondent Peter Alexander spoke to Tom Hanks during the D-Day 80th anniversary commemorations in Normandy, northern France, today.\n\nKing Charles III and Queen Camilla\n\nBritain’s King Charles III and Queen Camilla attend the Royal British Legion’s commemorative event at the British Normandy Memorial at Ver-sur-Mer, northern France, today.\n\nVeterans return to Normandy for D-Day commemorations\n\nAlthough many are unable to march these days, veterans were pushed through the site, which started as a battlefield and turned into a graveyard memorial for their former colleagues.\n\nJake Larson, a 101-year-old American best known on social media under the name “Papa Jake,” told NBC News he was “reliving walking in on D-Day.”\n\nFreedom 'costs,' Danish PM says as she marks D-Day\n\nDenmark’s prime minister said that this year’s observances of the D-Day landings, which come as Russia is at war against Ukraine, are a reminder that there is a price for defending freedom.\n\n“From D-Day, we have learned that freedom costs,” Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said in a statement as she headed to Normandy for ceremonies marking the 80th anniversary of the Allied landings.\n\n“Eighty years later, Europe once again finds itself at a fateful moment. Where freedom is once again being fought for on our own continent,” she said, “against an aggressive and brutal enemy who will dictate country borders with brute force and leave a trail of death and destruction.”\n\nWill the last big anniversary for D-Day vets also be the last for the Western alliance?\n\nand\n\nReporting from CAEN, France\n\nCAEN, France — For almost 80 years, the United States and Europe told themselves that a lasting postwar peace had been won here, in the bloody shallows and sands along six miles of the Normandy beach.\n\nToday — perhaps the last major milestone for many of the invasion’s dwindling heroes — that peace in Europe finds itself shattered.\n\nReplacing it are fears of another world war that until recently seemed outlandish, uncertainty about Washington’s European allyship that the Normandy landings cemented, and questions about the future of the Western alliance itself.\n\n“I believe that freedom and democracy are definitely under threat,” D-Day veteran Harold Terens, 100, told NBC News.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nTom Hanks arrives at American Cemetery\n\nCOLLEVILLE-SUR-MER, France — Tom Hanks, arriving at the American Cemetery above Omaha Beach, spoke briefly to NBC News about the D-Day anniversary and the people who had come to see the ceremony.\n\n“When I look around here today I see boys in high school, early in college, doing the right thing,” he told NBC News.\n\nAsked if the movie “Saving Private Ryan,” which depicted the D-Day invasion, was his most important film, Hanks said: “I can’t say that.” He paused and added: “But you can.”\n\nBiden arrives in Normandy\n\nBiden has arrived in Normandy for the D-Day anniversary celebrations.
