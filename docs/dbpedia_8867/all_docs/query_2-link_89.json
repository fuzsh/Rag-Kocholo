        "text": "You do not have to file a Missouri return if you are not required to file a federal return.\n\nIf you are required to file a federal return, you may not have to file a Missouri return if:\n\nYou are a resident and have less than $1,200 of Missouri adjusted gross income;\n\nYou are a nonresident with less than $600 of Missouri income; OR\n\nYour Missouri adjusted gross income is less than the amount of your standard deduction plus your exemption amount.\n\nNote: If you are not required to file a Missouri return, but you received a W-2 form stating you had Missouri tax withheld, you must file a Missouri return to get a refund of your Missouri withholding. If you are not required to file a Missouri return and you do not anticipate an increase in income, you may change your W-4 form to \"exempt\" so your employer will not withhold Missouri tax.\n\nMilitary pay is subject to income tax only by the state that is your home of record. If you entered the military in Missouri, your home of record is presumed to be Missouri (you are presumed to be domiciled in Missouri).\n\nIf you are entering or leaving the armed forces and are in Missouri more than 30 days, your total income (military pay included) is 100 percent taxable to Missouri.\n\nIf you are a Missouri resident and you are stationed in Missouri, your military pay is subject to Missouri tax. If you and your spouse are residents of Missouri and your spouse remains in Missouri while you are out of Missouri on military orders, your total income (military pay included) is taxable to Missouri.\n\nIf your home of record is Missouri, but you and your spouse did not spend more than 30 days in Missouri and you did not maintain permanent living quarters in Missouri, your military pay will not be subject to Missouri tax. You must file a Form MO-1040 and Form MO-NRI to verify your military/nonresident tax status. Be sure to include a copy of your federal return.\n\nIf your home of record is not Missouri, but you are stationed in Missouri due to military orders, your military pay is not subject to Missouri income tax. You are not required to file a Missouri individual income tax return. However, please complete the \"No Return Required - Military Online Form\" to ensure the Department is aware you are not required to file a Missouri income tax return. If you or your spouse earned Missouri source income of $600 or more (other than military pay), you must file a Missouri income tax return by completing Form MO-1040 and Form MO-NRI. Be sure to include a copy of your federal return.\n\nFor more information about the taxation of military pay, see DOR-558, Military Information , or refer to the Military Status page.\n\nYou must include all income on your Missouri return. If you perform services partly within and partly out of the state, only the wages you are paid for the services performed within Missouri are subject to Missouri income tax. The Form(s) W-2 issued to you from your employer(s) should indicate the state in which the wages were paid, along with the wages you earned in that state. You must allocate your Missouri source income on Form MO-NRI and complete Form MO-1040. You must include a copy of your federal return with your state return. Interstate transportation employees who regularly travel and perform duties in more than one state, may only be taxed by their state of residence. For more information regarding interstate transportation employees, you may download the state of Missouri Employer's Tax Guide.\n\nFor more information, refer to the Resident/Nonresident and Military Status pages.\n\nIf you are a full-year or part-year Missouri resident and earn income from another state, you must include all income on your Form MO-1040. You may be entitled to claim a credit against your Missouri tax liability for the income taxes paid to the other state. To determine your allowable credit, complete Form MO-CR (Credit for Income Taxes Paid to Other States). You must include a copy of the other state's return.\n\nIf you are a part-year Missouri resident filing as a nonresident, you must include the other state's income on your Form MO-1040. You may be entitled to reduce your Missouri tax liability. To determine the income tax you must pay to Missouri, complete Form MO-NRI (Missouri Income Percentage) and include a copy of your federal return.\n\nFor more information, refer to the Resident/Nonresident and Military Status pages.\n\nIf you receive an extension of time to file your federal income tax return, you will automatically be granted an extension of time to file your Missouri income tax return. Attach a copy of your federal extension (Federal Form 4868 or 2688) with your Missouri income tax return when you file.\n\nIf you expect to owe income tax, file Form MO-60 with your payment by the original due date of the return. An extension of time to file does not extend the time to pay. A 5 percent addition to tax penalty will apply if the tax is not paid by the original due date, provided your return is filed by the extension due date.\n\nAn addition to tax is imposed for failure to file or failure to pay. An addition to tax is imposed for failure to file by the due date at the rate of 5 percent per month, not to exceed 25 percent of the unpaid balance. An addition to tax is imposed for failure to pay by the due date at the rate of 5 percent of the unpaid balance.\n\nInterest is imposed on the portion of your Missouri tax liability that is not received on or before the due date. Simple interest is charged on all delinquent taxes. Click here to obtain current or previous interest rates.\n\nIf you have delinquent tax and want help figuring the amount due, access the Addition to Tax and Interest Calculator.\n\nThe deduction of your public retirement benefit will be 100 percent from the 2012 tax year and forward.\n\nThe total public pension exemption is limited to the maximum social security benefit of each spouse.\n\nIn order to be eligible for the full deduction, your Missouri adjusted gross income must fall within certain income limitations. If your income exceeds the limitation, you may qualify for a partial exemption. The amount of your exemption must be reduced by the amount that your income exceeds the limitation. The limitation is based on your filing status and income (less taxable social security benefits) as listed below:\n\n$85,000 â Single, Head of Household, or Qualifying Widow(er)\n\n$100,000 â Married, filing combined\n\n$85,000 â Married, filing separate\n\nSee the public pension exemption eligibility chart or complete the public pension calculation located on the MO-A, to determine if you are eligible.\n\nThe deductible percentage of your social security and social security disability benefits will be 100 percent from 2012 and forward. You must be 62 to qualify for a social security deduction.\n\nIn order to be eligible for the full deduction, your Missouri adjusted gross income must fall within certain income limitations. If your income exceeds the limitation, you may qualify for a partial exemption. The amount of your exemption must be reduced by the amount that your income exceeds the limitation. The limitation is based on your filing status and income as listed below:\n\n$85,000 â Single, Head of Household, or Qualifying Widow(er)\n\n$100,000 â Married, filing combined\n\n$85,000 â Married, filing separate\n\nSee the social security/social security disability deduction eligibility chart or complete the social security/social security disability calculation located on the MO-A, to determine if you are eligible.\n\nTo see if you qualify for a credit of up to $750 if you rent or $1,100 if you own your home, click here for the property tax credit diagram.\n\nIf you are required to file a Missouri income tax return, you may file a Form MO-1040 and Form MO-PTS (together) to claim your credit or refund. If you are NOT required to file a Missouri income tax return, you must file a Form MO-PTC, Property Tax Credit Claim, to claim your credit.\n\nFor more information, you may visit our Property Tax Credit Claim page or email us at PropertyTaxCredit@dor.mo.gov\n\nMissouri does not have a special form for amending a tax return. Form MO-1040 Individual Income Tax - Long Form should be completed (for the year being amended) with the corrected figures. The box indicating an amended return on page 1 should be marked in the top left corner.\n\nThe long form should be used even if you originally filed electronically, or used a short form. Remember to also complete the \"Amended Return\" section when completing page 2 of the return. To avoid a delay in processing your amended Missouri return, please include a copy of your amended federal income tax return and any supporting documentation, including Form MO-A (Individual Income Tax Adjustments), if applicable.\n\nAmended returns currently have the highest error rate among all types of income tax returns filed. The top reasons for taxpayer errors are:\n\nEntering the wrong amount that was previously paid on the original return. This amount should include tax, interest, addition to tax, and any penalty that was previously paid.\n\nEntering the wrong amount that was previously refunded on the original return. This amount should include the full amount overpaid, including the refund amount, interest, any amount transferred to next year's taxes, and any amount intercepted and applied to another debt.\n\nFailing to attach Form MO-A with the amended return. Complete and attach Form MO-A to your amended return if you itemize your deductions, claim modifications, or claim a pension exemption. (Even if changes were not made to this form, Form MO-A should still be attached with your amended return.)"
