        "text": "Zelle® is a convenient way to send, receive and request money quickly, safely and securely. Get money to and from friends, family and other people you know who have a bank account in the U.S. by using the USAA Mobile App on your Android or Apple mobile device.‍ ‍ See note 1, ‍ ‍ See note 2\n\nTo use Zelle®:\n\nLog on to the USAA Mobile App.\n\nChoose \"Zelle®.\"\n\nZelle® is also available on the mobile banking apps of many other participating banks and credit unions. Learn more about sending and receiving money with Zelle® on the Zelle® website.\n\nLog on to the USAA Mobile App.\n\nSelect \"Zelle®.\"\n\nChoose \"Send.\"\n\nSelect \"+\", then \"Add New Recipient\" will be displayed.\n\nTap \"Select From Contacts\" to import a recipient's information into your Zelle® contacts. You can also enter a trusted recipient's information manually.\n\nChoose the appropriate recipient type — \"Personal\" or \"Business.\"\n\nZelle® should only be used to send money to friends, family and others (including eligible businesses) you trust. Neither USAA Federal Savings Bank nor Zelle® offers a protection program for any authorized payments made with Zelle®.\n\nTo prevent delays, make sure you use the recipient's U.S. mobile number or email address that's enrolled with Zelle®. If you send money to someone who is not yet enrolled, they will receive a notification with instructions on how to quickly enroll to receive your money. Remember, only send money to friends, family and others you know and trust.\n\nIt's easy — just enroll with Zelle® through the USAA Mobile App and link your account to your U.S. mobile number or email address. When you're ready to send money, you can add a trusted recipient from your contacts list or add a new one. If the person you sent money to is not already enrolled, they will receive a notification with simple instructions on how to enroll to receive your money. If they are already enrolled with Zelle®, the money is sent directly to their bank account and cannot be canceled. That's why it's always a good idea to verify the email address or U.S. mobile number before sending and to only send to someone you know and trust. The person you're sending money to must have a bank account in the U.S. to receive money. In most cases, the money you send or receive is available in minutes.\n\nKnowing which of your friends, family and those you trust are enrolled in Zelle® is simple. We've tagged your contacts that are already using Zelle® with a “Z” logo.\n\nDon't see the “Z” by a contact? You can still send them money with Zelle®. They'll just need to enroll in Zelle® to receive the money.\n\nYes. USAA Federal Savings Bank sets these limits and allows you to send up to three payments in any 24-hour period, up to 21 transactions in any 7-day period and up to 90 transactions in any 30-day period. Your payments can't total more than $1,000 in any 24-hour period, $2,500 over any 7-day period or $10,000 in any 30-day period.\n\nIf you don't know the person, or aren't sure you will get what you paid for, such as items bought from an online bidding or sales site, we recommend not using Zelle®.\n\nNeither USAA Federal Savings Bank nor Zelle® offers a protection program for any authorized payments made with Zelle® – for example, if you do not receive the item you paid for or the item is not as described or as you expected.\n\nIf your recipient isn't enrolled with Zelle®, they'll get an email or text notification letting them know that money is waiting for them. They'll be prompted to enroll to receive the money you sent.\n\nIf your recipient doesn't enroll, they won't receive the money. The payment will expire in 14 days and the money will go back into your account.\n\nYou can only cancel a payment if the intended recipient isn't enrolled with Zelle®. On the Zelle® Activity page, choose the payment you want to cancel, and select \"Cancel this payment.\" If the person you sent money to has already enrolled with Zelle®, the money will usually be available within minutes.\n\nOnce a payment is sent, it can't be canceled unless the recipient has not yet enrolled with Zelle®. If the recipient isn't willing to send the money back to you, call us at 800-531-USAA (8722) so we can discuss your issue.\n\nWhenever you send money to someone who is already enrolled with Zelle®, the recipient's enrolled first name will display for you to confirm you're sending to the right person. Be sure to always check the name displayed before sending.\n\nIf you send money to an email address or U.S. mobile number for someone other than your intended recipient and the wrong recipient isn't willing to send the money back to you, call us at 800-531-USAA (8722). There's no guarantee that we'll be able to get the money back if it has been sent to the wrong recipient due to member error, such as a keystroke error or typo.\n\nIf your recipient hasn't received their money, check your Zelle® Activity screen to confirm money was sent to the correct mobile number or email address.\n\nIf your recipient didn't receive the money because they didn't enroll with Zelle®, ask them to complete their enrollment. If the payment expired because your recipient did not enroll within 14 days, and money is returned to your account, you can send the money again.\n\nIf your recipient is already enrolled but didn't receive the money, and you have confirmed that you used the correct email address or U.S. mobile number to send them money, suggest to your recipient they contact their financial institution. For additional help, call us at 800-531-USAA (8722) so we can discuss your concern.\n\nYes. If you've already enrolled with Zelle® through USAA Federal Savings Bank, you'll get a notification from us that someone has sent you money and no other action is necessary. If you haven't yet enrolled with Zelle®, you'll receive instructions on how to enroll with Zelle® in the USAA Mobile App or on usaa.com. Although you can enroll on usaa.com, you will need to use the USAA Mobile App to send or request money."
