        "text": "Berlin divided\n\ninBerlin inHistory\n\nGreater Berlin was created in 1920 by fusing 7 districts, 59 country communities, and 27 landed estates into a single association. Twenty resultant districts (now 12) became integral parts of metropolitan Berlin but still remained largely autonomous. At the end of World War II the Soviet Union took eight of Berlin’s districts as its sector of occupation. What was called the New West End, developed after old Berlin had outgrown its space, became West Berlin. The U.S. sector was formed by the six southern districts; the British sector embraced the four central and western districts; and the French were allotted the two northern districts.\n\nThis apportioning was based on an agreement that had been reached in London in 1944 and confirmed during the Potsdam Conference in 1945 (at the Cäcilienhof Castle, now a museum and hotel) by the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union; according to its terms, Germany was divided into occupation zones and Greater Berlin into sectors within, but not part of, the Soviet zone of occupation.\n\nIn March 1948 the Western powers decided to unite their zones of Germany into a single economic unit (trizone). In protest, the Soviet representative withdrew from the Allied Control Council. In June 1948 a currency reform was introduced in the trizone, including West Berlin. The Soviet Union responded by launching a land blockade of West Berlin.\n\nA great airlift broke this attempt to cut off the city from vital supplies, with Western Allied planes hauling nearly two million tons of food, coal, and other necessities. The Soviets abandoned the blockade in May 1949, but the Western Allies kept flying until September, building up a year’s supply of essential goods. The division of Berlin was completed when in November 1948 a separate municipal government with its own chief burgomaster was set up in East Berlin.\n\nIn June 1953 some 50,000 workers, reacting to restrictive policies, rebelled in East Berlin. The uprising, which spread throughout East Germany, was crushed by Soviet military intervention. A Soviet ultimatum in 1958 concerning the status of West Berlin prompted a new Berlin crisis, again causing hundreds of thousands of people to leave East Germany via West Berlin. To stop the exodus of its population, the East German government, with the full consent of the Soviets, erected the Berlin Wall, isolating West from East Berlin. West Berlin, then literally an island within the surrounding GDR, became the symbol of Western freedom. Generous cultural and economic subsidies and the exemption of its citizens from West German conscription made West Berlin a centre of artistic experimentation and political dissent. During the 1970s a network of treaties, based on the Four-Power Agreement of 1971, progressively eased relations and increased the freedom of movement, at least for West Berliners and Western visitors.\n\nBerlin united\n\nMass escapes in the summer of 1989 via Hungary and mass demonstrations in Leipzig, Berlin, and elsewhere within the GDR in the autumn of 1989 brought about the collapse of communist rule just when the representatives of the GDR and their foreign allies had celebrated the 40th anniversary of East Germany. The opening of the wall brought the 28-year division of Berlin to an end, as the unification of Germany ended the 45-year occupation of the city. With a few segments preserved as a monument, the wall was completely removed by the summer of 1991.\n\nThe reunited city, since 1991 Germany’s official capital, is confronted with a range of problems, including a 30-year break in joint and comprehensive city, highway, and public transportation planning; high unemployment, particularly among former East German government employees; duplication of many public institutions and services in the former two city halves; a psychological barrier that arose between easterners and westerners (“the wall in the head”); an acute housing shortage and a sharp rise in real estate prices and rents, intensified by Berlin’s restored position as the national capital; and a flood of immigrants, especially eastern Europeans, for whom Berlin is the easternmost “Western” metropolitan area.\n\nDuring the 1990s, massive construction projects transformed central Berlin. High-rise commercial construction in the Potsdamer Platz, on the site of the former wall, restored its role as a bustling urban centre, while hotel and retail construction on Friedrichstrasse renewed its place as one of the city’s showpieces. Meanwhile, a new dome capped a renovated Reichstag, which in 1999 once again served as the home of Germany’s parliament, and a series of new and restored government buildings housed most of Germany’s federal ministries by 2000. Large-scale infrastructural projects reunited the city’s long-divided transit systems. Perhaps most importantly, the divisions within the city began to break down as westerners lived or worked in former eastern neighbourhoods, and easterners lived or worked in the former west.\n\nThe democratization of eastern Europe and the disintegration of the Soviet Union in 1991 moved the centre of European gravity eastward. This shift, expressed also by the transfer of the German federal government from the Rhine to the Spree, holds strong promise for reviving Berlin as an economic centre and as the political and cultural hub of central Europe."
