        "text": "On the 15th August 1945, Emperor Hirohito took the unprecedented step of personally broadcasting to the Japanese people. The Emperor’s voice had not previously been heard by his subjects – who regarded him as an incarnate divinity. The situation faced by Japan was stated as follows, ‘Moreover, the enemy has begun to employ a new and most cruel bomb, the power of which to do damage, is indeed, incalculable, taking the toll of many innocent lives. Should we continue to fight, it would not only result in an ultimate collapse and obliteration of the Japanese nation, but also it would lead to the total extinction of human civilisation.’\n\nMichiko Nakamoto, who had suffered severe burns, as a consequence of the atomic bomb blast at Hiroshima, recalled her feelings, upon hearing that the war had ended, ‘I didn’t like the thought of losing the war and I couldn’t bear it, but then no more air raids and we could sleep at night without going to the underground shelter, so that was some relief. So it’s a mixed feeling.’\n\nThe Japanese population had experienced extreme food shortages during the latter part of the war, due to the sinking of merchant ships, by the United States Navy. The government in Japan had been advising people how to prepare meals from acorns, grain husks, sawdust, snails, grasshoppers and rats! The repatriation of demobilised Japanese soldiers exacerbated these starvation conditions. In a letter to a friend, Sherwood R. Moran, of the United States’ Navy wrote, ‘Tokyo, the first war casualty I’ve seen, is a devastated , immodest mess, but the silence is what gets me most…’.\n\nLooking to the Future\n\nIn their discussions regarding the post-war settlement, the leaders of The United States, The Soviet Union, Britain and China had agreed that an international organisation needed to be created, to help prevent the outbreak of another global conflict. From a conference in San Francisco-attended by fifty nations, emerged The United Nations Organisation (UN). In the preamble to the UN charter the hope was expressed that “…that armed force shall not be used, save in the common interest…” The way the world began to be reshaped in the years following the Second World War, owed more to politics and considerations of national interest, than the ideals embodied within the UN charter.\n\nThe leader of the Soviet Union Stalin, wanted to install communist governments in the nations of Eastern Europe, to prevent a future invasion, from the west. In October 1944, Churchill had visited Stalin in Moscow – President Roosevelt had remained in the United States, campaigning for re-election. Churchill agreed to the post-war Soviet control of Romania and Bulgaria, in exchange for Stalin promising not to support the communist insurgents in Greece. In March 1946, Winston Churchill gave a speech in Fulton Missouri, in the presence of United States President, Harry Truman. Churchill described Soviet domination of Eastern Europe, “From Stettin in the Baltic to Trieste on the Adriatic, an iron curtain has descended across the continent.” The speech was the opening blast in the confrontation known as the Cold War."
