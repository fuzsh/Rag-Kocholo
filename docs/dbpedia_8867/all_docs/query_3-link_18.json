        "text": "At its best, the campaign would knock Italy out of the war, persuade neutral Turkey to join the Allies, support the adjacent operations in the Balkans, and ultimately launch the Allied armies into Austria and then the heart of Germany.\n\nAt worst, it would tie down substantial enemy forces, drawing troops away from the Russian Front and answering Soviet demands for Allied action. It would also suck in enemy reserves from France, where the Allies hoped to land in 1944.\n\nSuccess in Italy would bring new hope to the many nations under Nazi rule and also secure new airfields from which to intensify the bombing of Germany and the Balkans.\n\nAllied disagreement\n\nHowever, the Americans were not convinced. Rich in manpower and resources, they wished to put all their efforts into a direct assault across the Channel and strike at Hitler through northern France as soon as possible.\n\nTheir agreement to the Italian adventure was grudging and conditional upon the withdrawal of forces whenever they were required in North West Europe.\n\nRough terrain\n\nThe Germans fought doggedly in terrain crossed by rivers and mountains well suited for defence. Italy's winter cold and summer heat exhausted the attackers.\n\nHighly mechanised forces such as the US Fifth and British Eighth Armies found that vehicles were at times more of a hindrance than a help. Rain frequently suspended what little mobility they had.\n\nMany British positions in the hills could only be reached by pack animals or porters. The regular supply of food and ammunition was often slow or hindered by bad weather.\n\nWounded men often had to be carried back several miles to reach full medical aid, or even to the point at which they could be transferred to a vehicle.\n\nLack of resources\n\nItaly’s vulnerable coastline could not be exploited effectively by the Allies through amphibious operations due to a lack of ships and landing craft.\n\nIn November 1943, seven battle-hardened Allied divisions were withdrawn from Italy for service in the forthcoming Normandy landings. A further seven, including the highly effective French Expeditionary Corps, were withdrawn in the summer of 1944 for the Allied landings in southern France. Finally, in January 1945, four more divisions were transferred from Italy to North West Europe.\n\nThe successes in Italy were achieved against this background of overstretched resources and shortages of ammunition, reinforcements and shipping."
