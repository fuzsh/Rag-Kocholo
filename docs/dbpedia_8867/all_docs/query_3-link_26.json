        "text": "Canadians played an important role in the liberation of the German-occupied Netherlands during the Second World War, forging lasting bonds between the two nations.\n\nCanadians landed in France on D-Day â 6 June 1944 â fighting through the summer in the Normandy campaign. Afterwards, they advanced northeast through France, Belgium and the Netherlands.\n\nIn October and November 1944, Canadian and Allied forces defeated the Germans blocking the Scheldt Estuary. This allowed the liberation of southern parts of the Netherlands and gave Allied ships access to the vital port of Antwerp, Belgium. After pushing into Germany in early 1945, Canadian and Allied forces liberated large parts of the Netherlands in April and May.\n\nâMy great grandfather was part of the liberation of the Netherlands. It shows me how much helping strangers can be an awesome power.â\n\nâMy family wouldn't be here if not for the bravery and sacrifice of Canadian Forces in liberating the Netherlands in 1945. Thank you.â\n\nâMy grandparents, oma + opa, came to Canada because of how they helped the Netherlands in World War II.â\n\nâMy mom was a young girl in Holland during the war. The first Canadian she ever met was a soldier who gave her his chocolate bar out of his ration pack.â\n\nâMy uncle lied about his age to enlist in WWII army. He died in April 1945 - 1 month before VE day + is buried in the Canadian cemetery in Groesbeek, Holland.â"
