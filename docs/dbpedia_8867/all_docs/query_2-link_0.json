The Reichsmark was then replaced by the Deutsche Mark, to become the currency of West Germany and then all of Germany after the 1990 reunification. The Reichsmark was used in the Soviet occupation zone of Germany until 23 June 1948, where it was replaced by the East German mark. The Reichsmark was subdivided into 100 Reichspfennig (Rpf or ℛ︁₰).[1] The Mark is an ancient Germanic weight measure, traditionally a half pound, later used for several coins; Reich (empire in English) comes from the official name for the German state from 1871 to 1945, Deutsches Reich.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Reichsmark was introduced in 1924 as a permanent replacement for the Papiermark. This was necessary due to the 1920s German inflation which had reached its peak in 1923. The exchange rate between the old Papiermark and the Reichsmark was 1 ℛ︁ℳ︁ = 1012 ℳ︁ (one trillion in American English and French, one billion in German and other European languages and British English of the time; see long and short scale). To stabilize the economy and to smooth the transition, the Papiermark was not directly replaced by the Reichsmark, but by the Rentenmark, an interim currency backed by the Deutsche Rentenbank, owning industrial and agricultural real estate assets. The Reichsmark was put on the gold standard at the rate previously used by the German mark, with the U.S. dollar worth 4.20 ℛ︁ℳ︁.[2]\n\nExpansion outside the Reichsmark\n\n[edit]\n\nMain articles: Öffa bills and Mefo bills\n\nDuring this period a number of shell companies were created and authorized to issue bonds outside the Reichsmark in order to finance state projects.[3] Nominally exchangeable at a 1:1 rate for Reichsmarks but then discounted by the Reichsbank this created secret monetary expansion without formally renouncing the gold standard of the Reichsmark.[4]\n\nWorld War II\n\n[edit]\n\nWith the annexation of the Federal State of Austria by Germany in 1938, the Reichsmark replaced the Austrian schilling. During the Second World War, Germany established fixed exchange rates between the Reichsmark and the currencies of the occupied and allied countries, often set so as to give economic benefits to German soldiers and civilian contractors, who were paid their wages in local currency. The rates were as follows:\n\nCurrency Date set Value per 10 ℛ︁ℳ︁ Belgian franc May 1940 Fr 100 July 1940 Fr 125 Bohemia and Moravia crown April 1939 K 100 Bulgarian lev 1940 Lev 333.33 Danish crown 1940 DKr 10 French franc May 1940 Fr 200 Italian lira 1943 Lit 100 Luxembourg franc May 1940 Fr 40 July 1940 Fr 100 Dutch guilder 10 May 1940 ƒ6.66 17 July 1940 ƒ7.57 Norwegian crown 1940 NKr 13.33 ?

Inflation in the final months of the war had reduced the value of the Reichsmark from 2.50 ℛ︁ℳ︁ = $1US to 10 ℛ︁ℳ︁ = $1US and a barter economy had emerged due to the rapid depreciation. The Reichsmark was replaced by the Deutsche Mark at a rate of 10:1 (1:1 for cash and current accounts) in June 1948 in the Trizone[5] and later in the same year by the East German mark in the Soviet Occupation Zone (colloquially also \"Ostmark\", since 1968 officially \"Mark der DDR\"). The 1948 currency reform under the direction of Ludwig Erhard is considered the beginning of the West German economic recovery; however, the secret plan to introduce the Deutsche Mark in the Trizone was formulated by economist Edward A. Tenenbaum of the US military government, and was executed abruptly on 21 June 1948. Three days later, the new currency also replaced the Reichsmark in the three Western sectors of Berlin. In November 1945, the Reichsmark was superseded by the Second Austrian schilling in Austria. In 1947, the Saar mark, later replaced with the Saar franc, was introduced in the Saar.[6]\n\nCoins\n\n[edit]\n\nDenominations\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1924, coins were introduced in denominations of 1 ℛ︁₰, 2 ℛ︁₰, 5 ℛ︁₰, 10 ℛ︁₰, and 50 ℛ︁₰, and 1 ℳ︁ and 3 ℳ︁.[7]\n\nPrewar bronze 1 ℛ︁₰ (reverse).

Known as the Brüningtaler or Armer Heinrich ('poor Heinrich'), they were demonetized the following year. See Brüningtaler (in German). The quality of the Reichsmark coins decreased more and more towards the end of World War II and misprints happened more frequently.[8][9] Since the 4 ℛ︁₰ coin was only slightly larger than the 1 ℳ︁ coin and the imperial eagle looked similar, an attempt was made to pass it off as a 1-reichsmark coin by silvering the 4 ℛ︁₰ coin.[10]\n\n10 Reichspfennig\n\n[edit]\n\n10 ReichspfennigValue10 ReichspfennigMass3.52 gDiameter21 mmThickness1.5 mmEdgePlainComposition100% ZnYears of minting1940–1945ObverseDesignReichsadler with swastika.\n\nLettering:\n\nDeutsches Reich 1940ReverseDesignDenomination and two oak leaves.

It is worth 1⁄10 or .10 of a Reichsmark. Made entirely of zinc, the 10 ℛ︁₰ is an emergency issue type, similar to the zinc 1 ℛ︁₰ and 5 ℛ︁₰, and the aluminium 50 ℛ︁₰ coins from the same period.\n\nMint marks\n\n[edit]\n\nNazi Germany had a number of mints. Each mint location had its own identifiable letter. It is therefore possible to identify exactly which mint produced what coin by noting the mint mark on the coin. Not all mints were authorized to produce coins every year. The mints were also only authorized to produce a set number of coins with some mints allocated a greater production than others. Some of the coins with particular mint marks are therefore scarcer than others. With the silver 2 ℛ︁ℳ︁ and 5 ℛ︁ℳ︁ coins, the mint mark is found under the date on the left side of the coin. On the smaller denomination Reichspfennig coins, the mint mark is found on the bottom center of the coin.[11]\n\nMint mark Mint location Notes References A State Mint Berlin, Germany Capital of Germany [11] B Austrian Mint Vienna, Austria Capital of Austria [11] D Bavarian Central Mint Munich, Germany Capital of Bavaria [11] E Muldenhütten Mint [de] near Dresden, Germany Capital of Saxony [11] F State Mint [de] Stuttgart, Germany Capital of Württemberg [11] G State Mint [de] Karlsruhe, Germany Capital of Baden [11] J Mint of Hamburg, Germany [11]\n\nMintage\n\n[edit]\n\n1940 Year Mintage Notes 1940 A 212,948,000 1940 B 76,274,000 1940 D 45,434,000 1940 E 34,350,000 1940 F 27,603,000 1940 G 27,308,000 1940 J 41,678,000\n\n1941 Year Mintage Notes 1941 A 240,284,000 1941 B 70,747,000 1941 D 77,560,000 1941 E 36,548,000 1941 F 42,834,000 1941 G 28,765,000 1941 J 30,525,000\n\n1942 Year Mintage Notes 1942 A 184,545,000 1942 B 16,329,000 1942 D 40,852,000 1942 E 18,334,000 1942 F 32,690,000 1942 G 20,295,000 1942 J 29,957,000\n\n1943 Year Mintage Notes 1943 A 157,357,000 1943 B 11,940,000 1943 D 17,304,000 1943 E 10,445,000 1943 F 24,804,000 1943 G 3,618,000 Rare 1943 J 1,821,000 Rare\n\n1944 Year Mintage Notes 1944 A 84,164,000 1944 B 40,781,000 1944 D 30,369,000 1944 E 29,963,000 1944 F 19,639,000 1944 G 13,023,000\n\n1945[12] Year Mintage Notes 1945 A 7,112,000 Rare 1945 E 4,897,000 Rare\n\nBanknotes\n\n[edit]\n\nThe first Reichsmark banknotes were introduced by the Reichsbank and state banks such as those of Bavaria, Saxony and Baden. The first Reichsbank issue of 1924 came in denominations of 10 ℛ︁ℳ︁, 20 ℛ︁ℳ︁, 50 ℛ︁ℳ︁, 100 ℛ︁ℳ︁, and 1,000 ℛ︁ℳ︁. This was followed by a second issue in the same denominations, dated between 1929 and 1936. The second issue commemorated persons who made contributions to German agriculture, industry, economy, science, and architecture: 10 ℛ︁ℳ︁ issued in 1929 commemorated agronomist Albrecht Thaer; 20 ℛ︁ℳ︁ issued in 1929 commemorated engineer, inventor, and industrialist Werner von Siemens; 50 ℛ︁ℳ︁ issued in 1933 commemorated Prussian politician and banker David Hansemann; 100 ℛ︁ℳ︁ issued in 1935 commemorated chemist and \"father of fertilizer industry\" Justus von Liebig; 1,000 ℛ︁ℳ︁ issued in 1936 commemorated Prussian architect Karl Friedrich Schinkel.\n\nA newer version of 20 ℛ︁ℳ︁ note was introduced in 1939, using a design taken from an unissued Austrian S100 banknote type. 5 ℛ︁ℳ︁ notes were issued in 1942. Throughout this period, the Rentenbank also issued banknotes denominated in Rentenmark, mostly in RM 1 and RM 2 denominations.\n\nIn preparation for the occupation of Germany, the United States issued occupation banknotes dated 1944, printed by the Forbes Lithograph Printing Company of Boston. These were printed in similar colours with different sizes for groups of denominations. Notes were issued for 1⁄2 ℳ︁, 1 ℳ︁, 5 ℳ︁, 10 ℳ︁, 20 ℳ︁, 50 ℳ︁, 100 ℳ︁, and 1,000 ℳ︁. The issuer was the Alliierte Militärbehörde ('Allied military authorities') with In Umlauf gesetzt in Deutschland ('in legal circulation in Germany') printed on the obverse.\n\nThese notes were convertible to US dollars at a rate of 10:1. Seeing an opportunity to procure foreign hard currency, the Soviet Union demanded copies of the engraving plates, ink, and associated equipment in early 1944, and on 14 April 1944 Henry Morgenthau and Harry Dexter White of the U.S. Treasury Department authorized the air transfer of these to the USSR. Using a printing plant in occupied Leipzig, the Soviet authorities printed large runs of occupation marks to fill Soviet coffers with dollars causing inflation and financial instability. An investigation by the United States Congress (Occupation Currency Transactions Hearings before the Committee on Appropriations, Armed Services and Banking and Currency, U.S. Senate, 1947) found that about $380,000,000 \"more currency than there were appropriations for\" had been circulated.\n\nIn 1947 Rhineland-Palatinate issued 5₰ and 10₰ notes with Geldschein on them.\n\n20 ℛ︁ℳ︁, 1924\n\n10 ℛ︁ℳ︁, 1929\n\n20 ℛ︁ℳ︁, 1929\n\nOccupation Reichsmark\n\n[edit]\n\nCoins and banknotes for circulation in the occupied territories during the war were issued by the Reichskreditkassen. Holed, zinc coins in 5 ℛ︁₰ and 10 ℛ︁₰ denominations were struck in 1940 and 1941. Banknotes were issued between 1939 and 1945 in denominations of 50 ℛ︁₰, 1 ℛ︁ℳ︁, 2 ℛ︁ℳ︁, 5 ℛ︁ℳ︁, 20 ℛ︁ℳ︁, and 50 ℛ︁ℳ︁. These served as legal tender alongside the currency of the occupied countries.\n\nThe coins were originally planned in great numbers of 100 million and 250 million each of the 5 ℛ︁₰ and 10 ℛ︁₰ coins respectively. The first embossing order, which was issued in April 1940, was about 40 million × 5 ℛ︁₰ and 100 million × 10 ℛ︁₰. The total amount was divided between each of the seven German mints after the embossing key of 1939. The contract was stopped in August 1940 as the Wehrmacht, which had requested the coins for Belgium and France, had no more need of it. When the embossing stopped, only Berlin (\"A\") and Munich (\"D\") produced significant quantities, but they still came to only a small extent of original production plans. The majority were melted down due to the limited supply of metal and thus, most mint marks are now quite rare (except for 1940 5 A and D, and 1940 10 A).\n\nCurrency of the occupied countries (1940 10 J)\n\nCurrency of the occupied countries (1940 5 B)\n\n50 ℛ︁₰, 1938–1945\n\n1 ℛ︁ℳ︁, 1938–1945\n\n2 ℛ︁ℳ︁, 1938–1945\n\n5 ℛ︁ℳ︁, 1938–1945\n\n20 ℛ︁ℳ︁, 1938–1945\n\n50 ℛ︁ℳ︁, 1938–1945\n\nConcentration camp and POW Reichsmark currency\n\n[edit]\n\nVarious special issues of Reichsmark currency were issued for use in concentration and prisoner of war (POW) camps (Stalag). None were legal tender in Germany itself. From 1942 to 1943 tokens were struck for use within the Łódź Ghetto.[13][citation needed]\n\nMilitary Reichsmark currency\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: AM-Mark\n\nSpecial issues of Reichsmark currency were issued for use by the Wehrmacht from 1942 to 1944. The first issue was denominated in 1 ℛ︁₰, 5 ℛ︁₰, 10 ℛ︁₰, and 50 ℛ︁₰ and 1 ℛ︁ℳ︁, but was valued at 1 military Reichspfennig = 10 civilian Reichspfennig. This series was printed on only one side. The second issue notes of 1 ℛ︁ℳ︁, 5 ℛ︁ℳ︁, 10 ℛ︁ℳ︁, and 50 ℛ︁ℳ︁ were equal in value to the ordinary German Reichsmark and were printed on both sides.\n\nThe 5 Mark note pictured, front and back, is Allied military currency (\"AMC\") printed at Forbes Lithograph Manufacturing Company in Boston for occupied Germany. There were different AMCs for each liberated area of Europe.[14]\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nÖffa bills 1932 German government promissory notes\n\nMEFO Financial instrument used to finance Nazi German rearmament\n\nAM-Mark\n\nPictorial list of postage stamps in Nazi Germany\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther reading\n\n[edit]\n\nAhamed, Liaquat (2009).
