This card can be used to transact in various countries using the amounts from the respective currency wallets at all VISA affiliated merchant outlets, ATMs and e-commerce.\n\n*The total amount loaded on a card, all currencies combined should be done as per prevailing RBI and FEMA regulations.\n\nFor reloading the card , Authorization letter from the card holder with the persons name and attested signature who will place the request on his behalf and acknowledge the transaction shall have to be obtained from the person placing the request along with the following documents:\n\nPassport Copy of the card holder\n\nForm A2 signed by the card holder\n\nReload Form signed by the card holder\n\nIdentity card of the person placing the request\n\nAlternatively, the card can also be reloaded Online in real time by using iMobile and RIB.\n\nNo, the card cannot be used in India, Nepal & Bhutan. Balance inquiry is allowed free of charge in ICICI Bank ATM in India (Not available for Multicurrency Forex Prepaid Card). However balance available on the card will be reflected in the INR (Indian rupees) but actual balance will be the same what was available in the loaded currency.\n\nUsage of the ICICI Bank Forex Prepaid Card should be in strict accordance with the regulations of the Reserve Bank of India and FEMA regulations.\n\nThe minimum load amount is <1> unit of respective currencies (i.e. USD 1, GBP 1 and so on). The maximum load amount should be done as per the Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999 and prevailing RBI regulations.\n\nAsk the merchant to ensure that he has swiped on a Credit Card terminal. Machine should accept VISA/MasterCard flag cards.\n\nIf the card is still getting declined, walk into the nearest ATM to check the available balance on the card. Customers can withdraw the cash from the ATM and settle with the merchant. Report the matter to ICICI Bank, for follow up with the Merchant.\n\nFor transactions done in the base currency, there is no exchange rate applicable. However, for transactions other than in the Base Currency, VISA / MATERCARD wholesale rates* would apply.\n\nThese rates are generally more favourable than the rates offered by money changers.\n\n*There will be a currency conversion markup of 3.5% plus Goods and Service Tax as applicable will be levied by the Bank.\n\nPlease note that 18% Goods and Service Tax (GST) w.e.f. July 1, 2017 will be applicable .\n\nBoth Primary and Secondary Card ATM PINs are triggered to the registered mobile number once they are activated. Primary Card ATM PIN is triggered as soon as the kit is activated. Secondary Card ATM PIN is generated once the Primary Card is closed/permanently blocked and the Secondary Card is activated. The ATM PIN can be changed by logging into the iMobile Pay app or Net Banking.\n\nCustomers having a Corporate Forex Card would have to contact their RM or visit an ICICI Bank Branch for a Forex Card refund, along with a request letter on a corporate letterhead (signed by an authorised signatory), a refund form and a passport copy for which the INR amount will be credited to the Corporate Current Account. In case the customer needs a refund in their personal account, an NOC on a corporate letterhead (signed by an authorised signatory), a refund form and a passport copy will be required.\n\nNo, you cannot use the card in India, Nepal and Bhutan. You can check the balance on the card free of charge at any ICICI Bank ATMs in India. The balance displayed would be in Indian Rupee equivalent. You can also generate a new ATM PIN at ICICI Bank ATMs in India, free of cost.\n\nDynamic Currency Conversion (DCC), also referred to as Cardholder Preferred Currency (CPC), is a service offered by merchants – not VISA - in some countries when you are travelling abroad. If you choose to use the DCC service, the merchant will convert the purchase price of goods or services at the point of sale from the currency in which the price (i.e. the merchant’s local currency) is displayed into another currency (i.e. your home currency) using an exchange rate that typically includes a service fee.\n\nWe recommend NOT to opt for DCC settlement if offered by merchant at the time of payment of bills.\n\nHotels/Car Rentals before check-in/renting services etc, take a pre-auth on your card. A Pre-Auth is essentially blocking of certain amount on your card which becomes unaccessible to you unless gets settled. We recommend that you DO NOT use your ICICI Bank Forex Prepaid Card at the time of checking-in or initiating a rental. Use any other credit/debit card for making the reservations. At the time of checking out of the hotel/settling the bill, you should:\n\nAsk the executive to settle the final bill against the pre-auth that was taken.\n\nAsk the executive to cancel the pre-auth (credit back the amount) that was taken and settle the bill by taking an authorization for the actual bill amount.\n\nAsk the executive to provide you the cancelled or VOID transaction slip for the same transaction and present the same to your bank for reversal of the unsettled transaction.\n\nIn the event of the Merchant neither reversing back the amount nor providing you the VOID transaction slip for submission to your bank, ICICI Bank would credit back the amount immediately after 31st day from the date of transaction. Incase of Cash withdrawal unsettled transaction, same will be released on 11th day from the date of transaction.\n\nThe Secondary Card can be activated by calling at the call centre and then request for balance transfer. Your ATM and web PIN can also be generated. Should you happen to lose both, the primary as well as secondary card, you can ask for another replacement card that will be sent to your location.\n\nAn ICICI Bank Forex Prepaid Card ensures that you have a hassle free business or pleasure trip abroad.
