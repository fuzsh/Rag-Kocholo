        "text": "The Muslim festival of Eid al-Fitr has begun, marking the end of the holy month of Ramadan.\n\nIt was declared after the new Moon was sighted in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday 9 April.\n\nWhat is Eid al-Fitr?\n\nEid al-Fitr is the \"festival of breaking the fast\".\n\nIt takes place the day after the new Moon is seen at the end of the month of Ramadan, and marks the start of Shawwal - the 10th month of the Islamic calendar.\n\nAlong with Eid al-Adha, it is one of the two main festivals in Islam.\n\nWhat happens at Eid al-Fitr?\n\nMany Muslims attend prayers at their mosque on the morning of Eid al-Fitr.\n\nBy this time, they are expected to have made their end-of-Ramadan donation to charity - known as Zakat-ul-Fitr or Fitrana - to help feed the poor.\n\nEid al-Fitr is usually a period of great celebration, with families and friends coming together and sharing large meals.\n\nIt is also common for children to receive either money or small gifts from their elders.\n\nWhat do you say at Eid?\n\nTo wish someone well at Eid, you can say \"Eid Mubarak\", which means \"Blessed Eid\".\n\nIn the Middle East, you may also hear \"Eid Saeed\" which simply means \"Happy Eid\".\n\nWhat is Eid al-Adha?\n\nEid al-Adha is expected to take place in 2024 between 16 and 20 June.\n\nIt lasts for four days and coincides with the later part of the Hajj - the annual pilgrimage to Mecca.\n\nEid al-Adha means \"feast of the sacrifice\", and it commemorates prophet Ibrahim's willingness to sacrifice his son on God's orders.\n\nWhat is Ramadan?\n\nRamadan is the ninth month of the Islamic calendar. It has a special significance in Islam.\n\nIt is during this month that Muslims believe the first verses of the Quran - Islam's holy book - were revealed to the Prophet Muhammad.\n\nDuring this period, Muslims are required to fast and to give to charity, to show kindness and patience, and to strengthen their relationship with God.\n\nExtra emphasis is placed on reciting the Quran.\n\nWhy do Muslims fast?\n\nFasting during Ramadan is one of the Five Pillars of Islam, which lay the basis for how Muslims are required to live their lives.\n\nThe other pillars are the profession of faith, prayer five times a day, zakat - a form of charity, and making the pilgrimage to the holy city of Mecca once in their lifetime.\n\nFasting is meant to encourage spiritual reflection.\n\nMuslims have an early morning meal before dawn, known as suhoor or sehri.\n\nDuring the day, they are not supposed to eat or drink anything - including water - until after sunset, when they break their fast with an evening meal, called iftar or fitoor.\n\nSome Muslims are, however, exempt from fasting. They include children who have not reached puberty, pregnant or breastfeeding women, menstruating women, those who are ill or whose health could be affected by fasting, and those who are travelling.\n\nWhat do you say at the start of Ramadan?\n\nIf you want to wish someone a good start of Ramadan, it is customary to say \"Ramadan Mubarak\", which means \"Blessed Ramadan\"."
