But we knew it will be like this so we were at the border quite early. We took a short stop at Svetogorsk centrum.\n\nFrom this not-so-beautiful-city we took a one hour drive to Vyborg. There I made a short stop at the train station. There is still parts of the original train station left but that was destroyed in WWII. It was originally quite accurate copy (smaller size) of Helsinki railway station.\n\nBut finally I stopped my car in the market square. And we were lucky it wasn’t raining so we could explore the city on foot.\n\nThere are many buildings in very bad condition or totally ruined in Vyborg. But luckily some of the buildings they are renovating so there will be something to see in the future also.\n\nThe city is definitely much more nice to see in the summer but we thought it was beautiful also now in the beginning of december… On a very grey weather. After the city tour we took a walk also in the famous Monrepo Park."
