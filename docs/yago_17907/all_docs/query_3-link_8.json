        "text": "Urban Design and Landscape\n\nTransformation of Industrial territories of the St. Petersburg's Vyborg Side\n\nAnastasia Kalinkina\n\nSaint-Petersburg State University of Architecture and Civil Engineering, Saint-Petersburg\n\nRussian Federation\n\nProject idea\n\nRevitalization of degrading industrial territories on the borders with the city center.\n\nProject description\n\nThe selected site is located in the Kalininsky district of the city of St. Petersburg and covers an area of 140 hectares. Part of the territory is included in the boundaries of the historic center.\n\nAt the levels of the city, microdistrict and site, the street and road network, functional zoning and landscaping were considered. The advantages and disadvantages of the territory were identified, on the basis of which the concept of the project was subsequently built.\n\nBased on the developed criteria for selecting analogs for all territories, art regions from the United States were selected.\n\nThe analysis examined various solutions for the design of the road network, functional zoning and landscaping.\n\nThe result of the analysis was the development of the most suitable development schemes for the considered site.\n\nFor the territory of the diploma project, the world examples of student campuses, options for their location, functional zoning were considered; identifies the main features of modern campuses, the requirements for them, as well as the merits of choosing the very idea of a campus for the territory under consideration.\n\nThe project proposes the transfer of an environmentally hazardous industry to an industrial site in Rybatskoye, the demolition of buildings that are not of historical and cultural value, the creation of a transport frame from intra-quarter and fire passages, the construction of new rear and structures that fit into the historical environment, the creation of clearly divided functional zones on the territory and the separation of residential areas from other industrial sites by business development, the creation of links between historical sites, unique buildings and structures, providing the territory with social infrastructure facilities, storing cars in underground parking lots, landscaping the territory and ensuring safe access to water, as well as improving the embankment.\n\nThe main idea was to create multifunctional neighborhoods based on historicity, identifiability and connectivity of the territory. The project also takes into account various types of buildings, courtyards and landscaping, which improves the quality of the environment due to its diversity.\n\nIn addition, proposals have been developed for residential units on the student campus, meeting the diverse needs of students and teachers.\n\nAs an object, a complex was developed, which is a synthesis of the main directions of the transformation of the territory and uniting the spheres of art and science.\n\nThe building is divided into blocks according to functional zoning: the block of arts, science and innovation. All blocks are connected with each other by an overhead passage.\n\nObject shaping is based on the image of a chain, which in turn unites the knowledge of students and teachers. On the other hand, the chain reflects the link between art, science and innovation.\n\nThus, the developed proposal solves a number of existing problems, takes into account the advantages of the site and reveals the potential of the selected territory.\n\nTechnical information\n\nStructural system of the building: frame-wall with transverse load-bearing walls (radial) and reinforced concrete columns with a circular section d=400 mm.\n\nStructural scheme of the building: Irregular structural system of frame-wall type, made according to the connection scheme.\n\nTo ensure spatial rigidity and stability, walls and stiffening cores are used, fixed in the foundation\n\nTo reduce the effort in the structures, temperature-shrinkage seams are provided.\n\nFoundation: Monolithic foundation slab 500 mm thick. Concrete - M300, EPPS insulation 200 mm, sandy gravel backfill 200 mm, sand cushion 200 mm.\n\nWalls:\n\n• Monolithic walls, monolithic concrete cake - 450 mm; plaster 30 mm;\n\n• Partitions - frame with Knauf plasterboard sheathing 80 mm, prefabricated reinforced concrete wall panels 160 mm;\n\nFilling window openings: panoramic glazing with metal imposts with a section of 120 x 120 mm. In the upper part they are attached to the roof with a strapping. In the lower part to the foundation - with the help of anchors.;\n\nFilling doorways: panel board, wooden door blocks.\n\nCeilings: multi-hollow reinforced concrete floor slab with a thickness of 220 mm, since due to the complex shapes of block sections, the installation of standard reinforced concrete floor slabs is not possible in all areas, monolithic sections are arranged.\n\nCrossbars: prefabricated prefabricated reinforced concrete crossbars with a tee section. The coupling of the crossbar with the column is solved according to the principle with an open console. The cross section of the crossbars is 300*600 mm.\n\nTrusses: bezraskosny reinforced concrete low-slope truss, which covers the span of 18 m in the sports block and assembly hall.\n\nCoatings: prefabricated reinforced concrete roof slabs, prefabricated ribbed roof slabs with a cross-sectional height of the bearing rib of 300 mm.Ceilings: prefabricated reinforced concrete slabs in the form;\n\nreinforced concrete flooring with round voids 220 mm thick. To ensure the spatial stability of the frame for the installation period, first of all, we install the middle and wall spacer plates;\n\nIn places where ventilation ducts pass, a monolithic section is arranged.\n\nFloors:\n\n∙ floor of the 1st, 2nd floor - self-leveling floor 3 mm, gypsum concrete slab 80 mm, cement sand screed 400 mm, backfill 10 mm, reinforced concrete multi-hollow slab 220 mm; to ensure the necessary index of sound insulation from airborne noise, a layer of sound insulation is arranged in the interfloor overlap;\n\n∙ basement floor - self-leveling floor 5 mm, reinforced screed 20 mm, slab insulation 150 mm, vapor barrier, cement sand screed 100 mm, compacted soil;\n\n∙ roofing - the main 4-layer roofing carpet, gravel embedded in bitumen 15 mm, leveling cement screed 15 mm, effective slab insulation 150 mm, rolled;\n\nvapor barrier, cement sand screed 20 mm, reinforced concrete floor slab 220 mm.\n\nRoof - flat, slope i= 5%\n\nStairs - prefabricated reinforced concrete from large-sized prefabricated elements. The width of the march is 1.2 m, the width of the platform is 1.2 m. For safety and ease of movement, the flights of stairs are equipped with enclosing structures with handrails 0.9 m high, the railing posts and handrails are metal.\n\nWall decoration - thin-layer plaster.\n\nFacade finishing materials - sheets of perforated aluminum mesh 0.16 mm thick;\n\nDegree of fire resistance of the building - II."
