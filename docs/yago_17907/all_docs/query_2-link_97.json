        "text": "*** Paper presented at the European Association for Urban History 13th International Conference, Helsinki, Finland, August 24-27, 2016. *** Before World War II the medieval fortress town of Vyborg (then Viipuri) situated on the Gulf of Finland was Finland's second city and the capital of Finnish Karelia. It is now a Russian town in the Leningrad Oblast 40km from the Finnish border. The town has a twofold identity as a current lived Russian place and as a past Finnish place, a 'ghost town' of memory. This paper examines how the town is represented and remembered in Finland today as a 'lost' and 'perfect' past Finnish place. This paper examines current tabloid media and online representations of Vyborg in Finland. Using Paasi's theory of spatial socialization the constructed collective memory of Vyborg in Finland is placed into the wider contexts of the trans-border Karelia region and ideas about the 'correct' or 'natural' eastern border of the Finnish nation state. This paper traces the formation and circulation of an homogenised, simplistic collective memory of Vyborg in Finland shaped by the idealised memories of Finnish Vyborger evacuees. Using ideas of collective trauma and how this can be transmitted within and between generations the paper ponders how and why Vyborg remains such an importance place of memory in Finland and whether it will remain so in the minds of the next generation.\n\nThis paper examines how the history of the now Russian once Finnish borderland town of Vyborg is told in Finland. Vyborg was the eastern outpost of the Russian Grand Duchy of Finland from 1812-1917 and then of the Republic of Finland from 1917 until World War Two (WWII). Vyborg was ceded to the Soviet Union in 1940, reoccupied by the Finns in 1941, taken by the Red Army in 1944 and again ceded to the Soviet Union as per the Paris Peace Treaty of 1947. This paper will argue that Vyborg is remembered in Finland as a perfect place, frozen in collective memory as a golden, prospering 1930s city. And that this remembering entails a concurrent forgetting. This paper argues that there is a 'double amnesia' at work in the remembering and forgetting of Vyborg in Finland. It's post WWII history is forgotten as is any negative aspect of pre-WWII life in the Finnish city. Through this wilful double amnesia Vyborg is kept and held in collective memory as a firmly Finnish place. The paper will examine popular media artefacts (including social media) and the stories they tell about Vyborg, and attempts to 'recreate' Finnish Vyborg in the virtual realm, to illuminate the uses and abuses of the collective memory of the city in Finland and how this selective memory is passed on via postmemory (Hirsch, 1999). The paper argues that media narratives adhere to a very narrow, Finland-centric, view of Vyborg conceiving of it as a lost place of the past and ignoring its complex history as a borderland town. The paper contrasts the stories of Vyborg's history told in popular media in Finland with 'silenced' and forgotten aspects of Vyborg's Finnish history. The paper shows, using Paasi's theory of spatial socialization, how closely ideas about the 'correct' eastern border of the Finnish nation-state, are bound up with the memory of Vyborg in Finland. The key question which this paper, and my PhD research, sets out to explore is why do those who lived or (more commonly nowadays) those whose parents lived in Finnish Vyborg \" continue to maintain and [to try] to transmit \" to the next generation \" such strong, positive, nostalgic memories of a city and culture that had long disappeared in reality, if not in the realm of remembrance, image, and recreation. \" 1 A related question is what purposes do these memories of a perfect, lost Finnish place serve in the contexts of Finnish identity and ideas of nation.\n\n***Paper Presented at the Conference 'Finland in Comparison IV: Re-thinking Power and the State in History', The Finnish Centre of Excellence in Historical Research, University of Tampere, 12-13 Oct. 2015*** Abstract This paper examines how the history of the now Russian once Finnish borderland town of Vyborg (Viipuri in Finnish) is told in Finland. Popular media and museum narratives are compared with official, state-sanctioned narratives of Vyborg's history and status today. The paper argues that the media and museum narratives adhere to a very narrow, Finland-centric, view of Vyborg based on the personal memories of Finnish ex-Vyborgers of a 'golden Finnish Vyborg' of the 1920s and 1930s. These histories, based on personal memories and postmemories, perceive Vyborg as a firmly Finnish place and also as a lost place of the past, ignoring its complex history as a borderland town. The popular history of Vyborg in Finland largely excludes conceptions of Vyborg as non-Finnish and any negative aspects of Vyborg's Finnish history such as the events of the Finnish Civil War of 1918 which took place there. The paper contrasts the stories of Vyborg's history told in popular media and museum exhibits in Finland with official government and state-sanctioned conceptions of Vyborg within the wider context of the 'Karelian Question' and the eastern border of the Finnish state.The paper shows, using Paasi's theory of spatial socialization, how closely ideas about the 'correct' eastern border of the Finnish nation-state, are bound up with the memory of Vyborg in Finland and how Vyborg is used to represent the 'injustice' of the post WWII Finnish-Russian state border. The paper is based on research included the author's Masters thesis and on ongoing research the author is conducting towards her PhD.\n\nThe article focuses on ﬁve essential phenomena in the Finnish memory culture relating tothe three Finnish wars fought in 1939–1945, namely, (1) the memory of the fallen; (2) theinﬂuential work by author Väinö Linna; (3) the contested memory politics and veteran cul-tures in the 1960s and 1970s; (4) Germany and the Holocaust in the Finnish memory culture; and (5) the ‘neo-patriotic’ turn in the commemoration of the wars from the end of the 1980s onwards. The Finnish memory culture of 1939–1945 presents an interesting caseof how the de facto lost wars against the Soviet Union have been shaped into cornerstones of national history and identity that continue to play a signiﬁcant role even today. Using the growing research literature on the various aspects of the Finnish war memories and memory politics, the article aims, ﬁrst, at outlining a synthesis of the memory culture’s central fea-tures and, second, at challenging the common contemporary conception, according to whichthe Finnish war veterans would have been forgotten, neglected and even disgraced during the post-war decades, to be ‘rehabilitated’ only from the end of the 1980s onwards.\n\nBased on an analysis of the leading Finnish newspaper, Helsingin Sanomat, this paper explores Finnish attitudes towards and understandings of Russia. It pays special attention to the so-called Karelia Question and the way it has shaped public discussion in Finland. The article seeks to investigate human signifying practices in the region’s specific social and cultural circumstances and explains meaning-making as a social practice. It evaluates how public opinion, as expressed in the letters page of the newspaper, has evolved and been affected by the broader changes that have occurred at the border. There are clear changes over time, both in a quantitative and qualitative sense. This may be summarised as representing a trend of general fading into history, but also as a more cyclical effect and as the interplay between bilateral relations and broader geopolitical changes.\n\nIn the aftermath of the Cold War, Finland has been involved in a geopolitical transition from the Soviet sphere of influence towards the core of the European integration process. The Finnish-Russian border has consequently transformed: primarily a segment of the Iron Curtain, it has thereafter turned into an external border, a frontier, of the European Union. As a result, a whole set of EU policies have been implemented, with the aim of converting this line of exclusion into an area of cross border cooperation. Due to the intensifying cross-border flows, the stress is often put on ongoing identity hybridization. Nonetheless, the impact of EU public policies should not be overestimated, nor should the national dimension of cross-bordering be omitted 1. Instead of relying on the hegemony of geopolitics, this paper will focus on the consequences of border&#39;s restructuring in regard to national memories and historiographies."
