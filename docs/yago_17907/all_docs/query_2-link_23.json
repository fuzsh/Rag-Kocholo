        "text": "Understand\n\n[edit]\n\nThe city is at the mouth of the Saimaa Canal, on a bay of the Gulf of Finland. Until World War II it was an important trading city. Especially in the 19th century it had a very international atmosphere. Although the Finnish speaking population grew from half to more than ninety percent, multiculturalism was important to the identity of the city, and the minorities of Swedes, Germans, Russians, Romani, Tatars, and Jews remained.\n\nAt the end of World War II the former population was evacuated and the city was later populated by Soviet Union citizens. The pre-war population of 70,000 was reached in the 1970s, with Vyborg having some 80,000 inhabitants in 2010.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nVyborg was one of six charted towns in medieval Finland. It started out as a marketplace for Karelians, belonging to the Novgorod realm. Until the 17th century Vuoksen, draining much of the Finnish Lakeland, had a western mouth here, while the eastern mouth was (and remains) in Ladoga. Thus Vuoksen connected Vyborg with Saimaa on one hand and Ladoga on the other, while Vyborg itself was on the coast.\n\nVyborg was conquered by Sweden in the \"Crusades\", and a fortress of stone was built in 1293, in place of the former wooden one. The town got its charter in 1403 and became one of the most important towns in the eastern part of Sweden (which was to become Finland).\n\nCeded to Russia in 1720 it grew in importance as a trade route for the Karelians, to the new Russian capital Saint Petersburg. This position remained when it became part of the Russian Grand Duchy of Finland in 1812.\n\nAgain part of Finland, Vyborg was one of the grand duchy's most important cities. The Saimaa Canal, inaugurated in 1856, again provided access to the Finnish Lakeland. Vyborg remained one of the most important cities in independent Finland until World War II, when it was ceded to the Soviet Union, reconquered by both sides and finally became Russian once more. There is much nostalgia for the city in Finland, which can be seen in the museums, with many Finnish visitors.\n\nSee\n\n[edit]\n\nA walking tour of the major sights of the city can be done in about three to four hours, with being the highlight of the tour.\n\nFrom the train station, walk down Leningradskiy Prospekt and turn right along the embankment of the Salakka-Lakhti Inlet. See the on the left at the end of the quay, where one can see the Market Hall or \"Rynok\" and the 16th-century . Walk past the Round Tower to the Lutheran in the park. Cross the street to see the blue-painted , then walk up Vyborgskaya Ulitsa past the along the remnants of the old city wall, then head up the street (this is the least picturesque part of the walk through the Stone City) to see the Clock Tower tucked in among the apartment buildings. Before the Castle Bridge, see the Statue of Torgils Knutsson, the Swedish knight who founded the city in the 13th century. Look across the gulf to the Statue of Peter the Great in the park opposite.\n\nCross the bridge to Vyborg Castle which was built in 1293 by Swedes, captured by Peter the Great in the 18th century, served as a Finnish prison in the 19th century, and passed between the hands of the Soviets and Finns multiple times during World War II. The castle has several different exhibits, each with its own entry fee, and one can climb to the top of the tower for a nice view of the city. (Tickets for the tower cost 80 руб from the museum cashier.)\n\nCross back over the bridge and walk up Krepostnaya Ulitsa through the town, turn left on Suvorovskiy Prospekt, see the and the Statue of a Moose in the park, then proceed to and the before heading up Vokzalnaya Ulitsa back to the train station.\n\nThe is one of the objects of Finnish nostalgia, an extensive English landscape park, founded in the 1760s. Under Soviet and later Russian rule much has been neglected or destroyed, but there have also been restoration efforts. Also, in the south-eastern part of the center of Vyborg is the another park, the (also known as Patterinmäki in Finnish), which is an old military and fortification area. The top of the rocky hill rises about 30 meters above sea level."
