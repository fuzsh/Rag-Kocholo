        "text": "\"The Blue Scarf\", Шарф голубой, originally was a romance, written in 1830 by the Russian composer Nikolai Titov (1800-1875), with verses by the poet Mikhail Markov. The composer Mikhail Glinka liked the song. He said that the melody of the romance was so good, that \"changing something in it means to spoil it\". He suggested \"nothing more touching\" and \"correcting the bass in the accompaniment\". As a result two versions of the romance were published: the first by Peetz in 1830, and the second, with Glinka's amendments, was published in Stellowski in 1835. It is this second version of Glinka that still is being performed nowadays.\n\nThe romance gained such popularity, that the blue scarf became an indispensable attribute of any fashionable young lady. Everybody considered it necessary to walk the streets wearing a blue scarf, that was swelling in the wind, spinning-turning over the head.\n\nAs it always happens with folk songs, the original words are or unknown, or they got forgotten, while they change depending on the circumstances in which the song is being performed. And this is what also happened with \"The spinning-turning Blue Scarf\". Even more, as the Russian word \"шарф\" (sharf), has the deaf consonant \"f\" at the end, which someone could not hear, the \"f\" was thrown away, and \"шарф\" became \"шар\", that means \"ball\". This caused the song's title to change into \"The spinning-turning Blue Ball\", \"Крутится-вертится шар голубой\", that became a hit on the eve of the WWI, and regained its popularity in 1934 due to the film \"Maxim's Youth\", from the cine trilogy about Maxim, directed by Grigory Kozintsev and Leonid Trauberg. The Russian author Boris Chirkov (1901-1982) played the role of the young worker Maxim, in the film \"Maxim's Youth\". During the shooting of the film it was suddenly realized that Maxim had not been given a song.\n\nAccording to Boris Chirkov, he was told to perform something for this reason, whatever came into his mind, and he remembered an old and famous city folk song. The words he had heard many times, but they were long time forgotten, and so he started to sing: \"It spins and turns, the blue glittering ball\". Chirkov, however, with the comrades who joined in the course of shooting, sang not all, but only a couple of verses of the song, and in this form it entered the movie, and in this form it stayed with the audience forever, while the rest of the song began to be forgotten. D. Shostakovitch, who composed the music for the film, agreed with the song and left it sounding.\n\nLater the song would sound in two other scenes of the trilogy: \"The Return Of Maxim\" (1937), and \"The Vyborg Side\" (1938).\n\nThe Russian song, however, did not end its life with the poems about the young ladies: new poems appeared for the same melody and a special surge of new songs appeared on the well-known motive at the time of the Great Patriotic War. On the eve of World War II the version of the song in the film \"The Cinema Concert of 1941\", was performed by laureates of the All-Union Contest of variety M. Kharitonov and N. Tiberga, accompanied by a jazz orchestra of the Central Palace of Culture of Railway Workers headed by Dm. and Dan. Pokrass. In this theme the railway theme was played out. Also during the time of the Great Patriotic War various versions of the song were distributed. In particular the poem of the poet Mikhail Isakovsky, composed in 1942, became widely known, and Boris Chirkov too sang a song in one of the novels of war cinematography \"Victory For Us\" of the Mosfilm studio. The collection was opened with the final scene from the film \"The Vyborg Side\", where the Chirkov`s personage sent farewell greetings to his audience. In the military compilation, however, instead of saying goodbye, Chirkov said \"comrades\", and began a conversation with his audience. The poet Vasily Lebedev-Kumach, was the author of these verses."
