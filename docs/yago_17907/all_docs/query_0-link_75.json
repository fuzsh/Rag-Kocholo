        "text": "1The influence of Fantômas novels and films on global popular culture is widely acknowledged. From the 1915 Spanish musical Cine-fantomas to the 1960s Italian comic book series Diabolik, Kriminal and Satanik, from Turkish B-movies such as Fantoma Istanbulda Bulusalim (dir. Natuk Baytan, 1967) to Julio Cortazar’s anti-imperialist pamphlet Fantômas contra los vampiros multinacionales (1975), Pierre Souvestre and Marcel Allain’s original literary series have engendered uncountable translations, adaptations, imitations and plagiarisms that have spread the character’s fame worldwide since its first appearance in 1911. This process continues to the present day, an example being the publication of an Italian graphic novel titled Fantomax by Luigi Bernardi and Onofrio Catacchio (Bologna: Coconino Press, 2011).\n\n2By focusing on the influence of Louis Feuillade’s film adaptations during the first decade of Fantômas’ long history as a transnational and transmedia icon, this paper aims to contribute to the growing interdisciplinary field that deals with the history of the supranational cultural sphere created by modern media culture. As a sort of archaeology of contemporary cultural globalization, this form of study intends to enrich previous historical surveys that had only taken into consideration specific national contexts. Moreover, it might also rebalance certain “colonizing” accounts that overemphasize the role of the cultural superpowers such as France, the UK or the US, often forgetting the appropriation of the products of international popular culture to be found in other countries. Therefore, this paper examines the transnational circulation of Fantômas films and, in particular, the creative processes engendered outside of France their origin country. Its goal is to explore both the immediate resonance of these works beyond French borders and the discontinuities that characterised their reception and assimilation by foreign cultural industries. As a controversial character and a central player in the relationship between cinema and literature in the crucial years when the feature and serial film boosted and legitimized the film industry, Fantômas represents an exemplary case study to discuss the cross-cultural and cross-media dynamics engendered by popular fiction.\n\n3This paper is structured in three parts. The first section lays out the theoretical background of the research. The second compares the circulation of Fantômas novels, films and theatrical adaptations with that of other similar crime series by analysing a series of maps. The final, longer section goes into the details of the influence of Feuillade’s films on international cinema in the 1910s, discussing in particular their impact in Italy, the UK, Spain, Germany, the US and Russia.\n\n1. Towards a Transnational History of Popular Culture\n\n2. Attempt at a cartography of the transnational circulation of crime fiction heroes (1900-1945)\n\n8To better analyse the case of Fantômas, it is useful to briefly take into consideration other similar and coeval crime fictions series. By looking at how Ernest W. Hornung’s Raffles (1898), Maurice Leblanc’s Lupin (1905) and Léon Sazie’s Zigomar (1909) were translated and adapted outside their origin countries, I intend to highlight both the exemplarity and the peculiarities of the circulation of Souvestre and Allain’s series. The contemporaneous presence of all of these serial characters in book and film markets played a pertinent role in this transnational process and markedly influenced their reception. Hence, discussing the differences and similarities in the international distribution of these four series usefully contextualises an analysis of the impact of Feuillade’s Fantômas adaptations on international cinematic production.\n\n9I will comment on four maps illustrating the circulation of Raffles, Lupin, Zigomar and Fantômas films, novels and theatrical works in Europe and the Americas between 1900 and 1945. These maps visualise the geographical areas reached by these series, the pace with which the original novels were translated and the number of theatrical and film adaptations that where produced in and outside the respective origin countries. They thus emphasise in an effective manner that all of them were immediately translated into several other languages and adapted for the theatre and/or the big screen numerous times, and in a very short span of time. Finally, the maps stress how these adaptations were frequently produced outside their origin country and attest to intensely creative dynamics of cross-cultural circulation.\n\n10Before examining these maps a methodological note is necessary. The data used to create them was collected via three main source types: the online catalogues of national libraries; specialized bibliographies and filmographies both online and print; archival documents preserved in film archives in Paris, London, Berlin and Bologna. Although this research has provided a certain amount of useful information, unfortunately the data presented here is still incomplete. In particular, given the absence of exhaustive catalogues and filmographies in relation to this early period in film history, discovering information about the transnational circulation of films during the 1910s has sometimes proved impossible without a lengthy perusal of trade magazines preserved in the film archives of each country under analysis, and through research into state offices devoted to commercial international exchanges. Regretfully, the author was not able to conduct such forms of research for this paper. In a further complication, it is always necessary to bear in mind that around 80% of the films produced during the silent period are currently considered to be lost. Hence, information about the films analysed in this paper is often seriously defective; even if the author has been able to view all the films still accessible either digitally or in film copies, these inevitably represent only a very small part of the titles mentioned.\n\n11These problems have been addressed through different strategies. As regards the scarcity of information available on the international distribution of silent films, I have considered the number and the characteristics of the foreign adaptations as an indicator of the international reception of each series. With regards to most of these movies not being available anymore, secondary sources such as promotional materials, trade magazines of the period and previous scholarly research are referenced. This set of data and information is then used to infer how different cultural industries related to them and to describe if and what practices of appropriation have taken place.\n\n14Raffles, the Amateur Cracksman: A Play in 4 Acts, written by Hornung himself together with the American playwright and director Eugene Presbrey in 1903, was staged in at least five countries including the UK, the US, France, Sweden and Canada. The international success of this play was a lasting one: in France the show toured the whole country numerous times until the late 1940s. A further theatrical adaptation was produced in Spain in 1909. However, the quantity of Raffles film adaptations is even more impressive, including at least 20 works produced in five different countries. It’s of particular interest to note that, before being taken to the big screen in the UK in 1911, Hornung’s character had been the protagonist of films produced in the US (1905), Denmark (1908) and Italy (1911).\n\n15The second map illustrates the circulation of stories, novels and films featuring Maurice Leblanc’s Arsène Lupin. This map makes immediately clear how the success of this series was significantly quicker, more widespread and more lasting than that of Raffles in any media. The number of translations of Leblancs’ works, as well as the rapidity with which they were published, is indeed extraordinary. Less then five years after its first appearance on the pages of the French literary magazine Je sais tout (1905), the series had been already translated in more than ten countries. The twenty volumes collecting Lupin stories and novels continued to be published until the death of their author in 1939, thus supplying new material that would be promptly translated in these as well as other countries around the world for more than three decades. As early as the 1910s the character’s fame reached non-Western countries such as Egypt and China where local imitations and variations were soon created.\n\n16It was thus predictable that the play Arsène Lupin, comédie en 4 actes, written by Leblanc with Francis de Crosset in 1909, was staged in a number of European and North American countries, and that at least two additional stage adaptations were created by Spanish authors in the same period. Because of controversy related to copyright issues, “only” 13 film adaptations of Lupin stories were produced before 1940. However, the variety of non-French adaptations is unique, ranging from countries such as Germany (1910), the UK (1916) and the US (1917) to even more surprisingly Russia (1918), Hungary (1921), Japan (1923) and China (1931).\n\n17This map refers to Léo Sazie’s Zigomar serial that first appeared as a feuilleton in the French newspaper Le Matin in 1909. The collected data about its translation circulation is unfortunately too incomplete to make a realistic cartography of the circulation of the series. The main reason is that it is very likely that Sazie’s “grand roman” was only published as a serial by different newspapers and journals, making it harder to collect information on an international scale. While it is certain that the Zigomar novel was translated in Italy and the UK, as yet there’s no information about other translations.\n\n19The fourth and last map describes the case of the Fantômas films, novels and theatrical adaptations. In particular, it clearly shows how the considerable circulation of Souvestre and Allain’s original literary works was significantly larger than that of the Zigomar novels. However, this map also clearly demonstrates that it was smaller and decisively less rapid in comparison to that of Hornung’s and Leblanc’s series. For instance, unlike the case of the Lupin stories and novels a much smaller portion of the volumes of the series was translated. The first series of Fantômas novels—published in France between 1911 and 1913—included 32 volumes, but in most cases only the very first one was translated. The pace of this process is also different and the export of Souvestre and Allain’s texts was much slower and more discontinuous than that of the Raffles and Lupin stories. Though foreign editions were published quite rapidly in Italy, Spain, Portugal and the UK, the series was only later translated into other languages (German, Hungarian, Finnish and Czech) during the Twenties and Thirties.\n\n3. The Transnational Influence of Feuillade’s Fantômas\n\n21As anticipated in the introduction, the last section of this paper focuses on how Louis Feuillade’s adaptations of five Fantômas novels, originally released in France between 1913 and 1914, affected foreign film industries during the years immediately subsequent to their initial appearance. Their impact on international cinema will be analyzed by drawing upon studies of their reception and most especially by discussing the films inspired by the series in six different countries i.e. Italy, the UK, Spain, Germany, the US and Russia.\n\n3.1 Fantômas made in Italy\n\n22As happened with Souvestre and Allain’s novels, Feuillade’s films were released In Italy immediately after the French première. In the 1980s, film historian Vittorio Martinelli conducted scrupulous archival research on the Italian reception of films of Feuillade, examining the problems encountered by Fantômas and Les Vampires with the Italian office of censorship. Martinelli writes that\n\n15 Vittorio Martinelli, “Feuillade en Italie,” Les Cahiers de la Cinémathèque, no. 48 (1988) : 105.\n\nles épisodes de Fantômas sont présentés sur les écrans italiens très peu de temps après leur première parisienne, précédés d’un battage publicitaire bien orchestré que les revues cinématographiques, alors très répandues, exaltent dans des long articles descriptifs et photographiques, tandis que les correspondances de Paris ne lassent pas de célébrer le vif succès remporté par les aventures de ce gentilhomme-cambrioleur publiées dans la péninsule par les éditions populaires Nerbini.”\n\n24Concerning Feuillade’s films, Martinelli also reports that in 1915 the office of censorship revoked its previous authorization of their distribution. By that time—two years after their first release—the series had almost completed its circulation and was still screened only in small town cinemas. Considering the timing and the contradictory meaning of this decision, in addition to examining the film journals published during the same period, Martinelli concluded that the real reason for the sudden change in the office’s decision was found in the increasingly protectionist campaign promoted by Italian production companies. In this period, violent attacks against foreign cinemas appeared with increasing frequency in film magazines—most of them being official or unofficial organs of the Italian film studios—as part of a campaign supporting a more high-brow, educational production inspired by Roman history or by nineteenth century literature and theatre. Not incidentally, this was exactly the genre of films the Italians companies were producing in this period.\n\n26The most interesting of these films is without any doubt the feature film Tigris, directed by Vincenzo Denizot and produced by Giovanni Pastrone for Itala studios. Launched in February 1913 (i.e. three months before the French release of the first episode of Feuillade’s saga) this film was probably inspired by the success of the Fantômas novels as much as by films based on Sazie’s Zigomar. Not coincidentally, Tigris is now remembered especially for its sophisticated visual effects, something it shares more with Jasset’s trick films than with Feuillade’s more realist series.\n\n3.2 A British Fantômas: Ultus\n\n24 Ibid.\n\nCette série compte parmi les meilleurs histoires de detectives jamais tourné” (The Kinegraph Weekly); “On y frissonne d’abondance. L’auteur a pris son courage à deux mains et prodigue des trésors d’imagination, sans se soucier de la vraisemblance […] Pourquoi les complices arrivent-ils alors qu’ils n’étaient pas attendus? Nous ne le savons pas et, vraiment, cela importe peu. La surprise est ici la sensation la plus agréable. Si nous savions le ‘comment”, le ‘pourquoi’ et le ‘quand,’ nous connaîtrions le mécanisme, et l’illusion serait dissipé” (The Cinematograph Exhibitors Mail).\n\n30The most interesting example of a British series influenced by Fantômas is a group of films featuring Ultus, an anti-hero played by Aurele Sydney, an Australian actor with French origins who had already worked successfully in France. Released by Gaumont through its British branch, the Ultus series was evidently a result of the positive reception of Feuillade’s film in the UK. Significantly, even though the goal was explicitly one of benefiting from the success of Souvestre and Allain’s creation, the new character was not a faithful replica of the model.\n\n3.3 The Spanish Vampires\n\n32Together with Italy, Spain was the only country to translate Souvestre and Allain’s novels as early as 1912. As a consequence Feuillade’s films also became extremely popular one year later, as is attested by at least two local productions.\n\n3.4 The German Phantômas\n\n35On the pages of Der Kinematograph, one of the most prominent German trade magazines of the 1910s, the future release of the first episode of Feuillade’s series was announced for the end of August 1914 with the publication of a promotional image featuring the most famous picture of the genius of crime. However, in perusing the following issues of the magazine, no further information can be found concerning the serial. The reason was certainly the outbreak of World War I in August 1914. It is thus quite significant to note that a crime series featuring a villain called Phantomas was produced in Germany between 1916 and 1919.\n\n3.5 Fantômas in America\n\n38Whereas at the beginning of the century French cinema—and, in particular, the pioneering firm Pathé-Frère—were still hegemonic within the USA, by the time Feuillade’s movies were distributed the situation had completely changed. As a consequence, Gaumont was forced to adopt a series of strategies to overcome this resistance. The first episode of the Fantômas series was announced as part of a series entitled “Cracksman vs. Detective,” while Fantômas was described as an elegant masked gentleman. The use of the word “cracksman” was another way of promoting Fantômas as an innocuous character, and it is certainly no coincidence that the “amateur cracksman” was the nickname of the much more reassuring Raffles, a Hollywood favourite from 1905 to 1940. As seen in the cases of the creation of Za la Mort in Italy and Ultus in the UK, the exportation of Fantômas in the US needed an intermediary to attenuate its outrageous qualities. This mediation was found either in the traditional figure of the “noble thief” or its modern equivalent, the “gentleman burglar.”\n\n37 “Fantômas,” TheKinematograph Weekly, 7 April 1921, 59.\n\nOne can hardly feel any sympathy with the good characters in such a Fantomas serial partly because they seem to walk into trouble simply because they like it, and partly owing to past experiences which teach the spectator that neither explosions, fires, falls from bridges or roofs into water, knives, pistols nor luridly devised tortures will harm a hair of their heads or the skin of their baby fingers. Fantomas is just the treasure serial. […] Fantomas himself has a striking face, and is very ingenious in disguising it, while all the performers appear to be good acrobats. […] The stunts include pretending to kidnap the millionaire alchemist in a motor car which really contains dummies; disguising as a chauffeur; connecting a telephone receiver with an explosive; jumping from a balcony into a motor car; swinging on a chandelier; jumping from roof to roof; blowing up a boat full of policemen, and high diving from a room through the window.\n\n41In 1967, Marcel Allain himself, in a speech given at the Bibliothèque communale of Verviers, reproached the Americans for having betrayed the original spirit of the character:\n\n38 Cited in Dominique Kalifa (ed.), Nouvelle Revue des Études Fantômassiennes, Paris : Joëlle Losfeld, (...)\n\nEt puis il y a les gens d’Hollywood, qui ont un procédé très simple: ils achètent les droits d’adaptation, les livres à une équipe qui, pour justifier ses honoraires, s’efforce de faire le contraire de ce qu’il y a dans le roman. Le résultat est qu’on n’y comprend plus rien du tout. J’ai eu la surprise un jour de voir Fantômas devenu une femme, qui agissait pour le plus grand bien du public. Il n’y a qu’à s’incliner devant ces choses-là, mais j’ai fais interdire le film en France.\n\n3.6 Fantômas in Russia\n\n43Even if first hand information about the distribution and reception of Feuillade’s films in Russia are missing, a pair of extraordinary secondary sources can be mentioned. Two of the greatest directors of the Soviet avant-garde—Sergei Eisenstein and Leonid Trauberg—publicly expressed their deep love for these serials while surprisingly acknowledging them as an influence on their own approach to cinematography.\n\n41 Ibid., 329.\n\nchaque scène, c’est l’épisode de l’inspecteur Juve et de son assistant Fandor quand ils combattent Fantômas, et puis Eisenstein m’a dit que le titre du film le Retour de Maxime lui avait plut parce que nous étions tous deux des passionnés de littérature d’aventures, comme le Retour de Sherlock Holmes.”\n\n45Furthermore, Trauberg remarked how The Extraordinary Adventures of Mr. West in the Land of the Bolsheviks (1924) as well as The Death Ray (1925) were Kuleshov’s tributes and parodies of Fantômas and other pulp heroes. Finally, the director underlined the extent to which Eisenstein’s theatrical work had been influenced by detective fiction. According to him, the “attractions” that Eisenstein famously used to provoke a “shock” among the spectators and urge them to engage more actively with what they were seeing on stage came directly from French and American crime stories. It was thus by including incongruous action sequences taken from contemporary popular cinema in more traditional theatrical plays, such as those written by nineteenth-century author Alexandre Ostrovski, that Eisenstein came to theorize the “montage of attractions” with which he later revolutionized film language.\n\nConclusions\n\n48Though much has been written about Fantômas’ international success, this paper has suggested that this topic deserves further research. During the first decades of the twentieth century, especially (but not only) thanks to the extremely rapid world expansion of the film industry, the transnational and transmedia circulation of popular fiction became so intense that an already truly global culture took shape. The list of Fantômas-like characters appearing in other countries—as that concerning any other internationally popular hero—would certainly be much longer if a collective research project had been undertaken to trace the direct and indirect influence of Souvestre and Allain’s creations on international cinema. In both popular literature and silent film studies, the practical and methodological problems in carrying out such endeavours are in fact numerous, and can only be met through an international and interdisciplinary cooperation, as well as through long-term archival research conducted in each country.\n\n49Despite its inevitable incompleteness, this paper proved that the success of Feuillade’s films, not only Fantômas but also its unofficial sequel Les Vampires, had a lasting influence in several countries. Far from producing simple imitations, this phenomenon encouraged the creation of national variations. Each country profited from Fantômas’ popularity to create its own version of the modern outlaw hero as a combination of both foreign influences and its own local priorities and cultural traditions. If the overall tendency was to reduce the outrageous, hyper-modern flavour of the French “genius of crime,” it is important to bear in mind that in these years cinema was still the victim of harsh cultural delegitimization and severe censorship. Although mitigated, the subversion of moral codes embodied by Fantômas’ figure and the intrinsic cinematic value of Feuillade’s adaptations were undoubtedly still perceptible in its foreign avatars and certainly contributed in the evolution of the respective national cinemas towards a more modern, twentieth century approach to film production and culture."
