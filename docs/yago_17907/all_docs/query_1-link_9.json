        "text": "In lieu of an abstract, here is a brief excerpt of the content:\n\n4. Under the Big Top America Goes to the Circus Josephine Woll Foreigners, as Peter Kenez argues in this volume, frequently appear in the more than two hundred feature films produced by soviet studios between 1933 and 1940, usually as negative characters.1 In the historical spectacles glorifying russia’s past (for example, vladimir Petrov’s 1937–1938 Peter the First and sergei eisenstein’s 1938 Alexander Nevskii), foreigners challenge the wisdom of russia’s far-sighted rulers or invade russia’s territory. In the substantial number of adventure films made about the October revolution and Civil War, most famously sergei and Georgii vasil’ev’s Chapaev (1934), efim dzigan’s We Are from Kronstadt (1936), and Leonid trauberg’s and Grigorii Kozintsev’s trilogy of films starring the revolutionary hero Maxim (1935’s The Youth of Maxim, 1937’s The Return of Maxim, and 1939’s The Vyborg Side), Bolsheviks typically triumph over local opponents (White army officers, remnants of the pre-revolutionary bourgeoisie, recalcitrant kulaks), but foreigners are either understood or are actually shown to offer political and financial support to enemies of Bolshevism, even when they remain on the margins of the story. similarly, the “construction dramas” dealing with heavy industry, the kolkhoz movies portraying collective farm life, or the popular aviation and border-guard adventure movies, all of which concentrate on contemporary domestic soviet life, pit the protagonists against inimical forces at every turn, most dangerously the homegrown saboteurs and wreckers who pretend to pious loyalty as they work to undermine their society. as the decade wore on, however, Japanese and German enemies multiplied: more than thirty films from the 1930s involve devious foreign agents penetrating soviet borders.2 at the same time, foreigners (or returning émigrés) who reject their own profoundly flawed societies to come to the soviet Union for a better, more meaningful life—a trope developed ten years earlier—figure in a number of films from the decade. Grigorii alexandrov’s The Circus (1936) offers both—enemy and convert—in an engaging package that entranced audiences at the time, and continues to do so seven decades later. UNDER THE BIG TOP 69 Of the four musical comedies Grigorii alexandrov made together with composerIsaacdunaevskii,allstarringalexandrov’swifeLiubov’Orlova,only The Circus involves foreigners. the first, Jolly Fellows (1934), “a loose chain of èstrada [revue or cabaret] numbers . . . soviet Hollywood with white pianos and pearl-studded cellos,” wears its politics lightly, preferring tuneful jazz and slapstick humor: “the only Marxism in the movie was that of Groucho and his brothers at the moment when the jazzmen created havoc in the Bolshoi theater.”3 In Volga-Volga (1938), stalin’s favorite, Orlova’s provincial postal carrier and songwriter defeats a recalcitrant bureaucrat, Byvalov (“man of the past,” a favorite screen villain, here played by the brilliant Igor Il’inskii). Radiant Path (1940), alexandrov’s soviet version of the Cinderella story, stars Orlova as an uneducated servant girl who becomes a textile worker and overcomes her own ignorance and the malice of first a jealous boss and then yet anotherhideboundbureaucrat to reach stakhanovite blissandrecognition in the Kremlin. there are no outsiders in these three films, only insiders who obstruct the heroines’ steady progress toward success and happiness. The Circus makes use of several patterns from the other films, but adds the “insider/outsider” element to the mix. two outsiders penetrate its utopian world. One, Marion dixon, is american. stone-throwing racists literally drive her out of the american heartland: she barely escapes the lynch mob by pulling herself onto the train that will carry her away. distraught, clutching her blanketed bundle, Marion tumbles into the arms of the other foreigner. even before we learn his name—Franz von Kneischutz—we know he is German, for although he is reading an english-language newspaper, his first words to Marion are “Was wollen sie?” Mistakenly believing she has found safe haven with von Kneischutz, Marion closes her eyes with relief. as the caboose recedes, the globe spins; english letters “Usa” convert to Cyrillic letters “CCCP,” and the audience finds itself in the Moscow circus, where von Kneischutz and Marion are preparing to perform their remarkable feat, “the Flight to the Moon.” the remainder of the film details their experiences in the Ussr. Both Marion and von Kneischutz, then, begin as outsiders to the soviet Union. But by the end of The Circus, their stances vis-à-vis soviet society diverge radically. Marion sheds her outsider status to become a part..."
