        "text": "Film industries exist within multiple paradigms, showing cultural, social and political links. Motion pictures reflect various constructs, which possess reciprocal functionality – they create, shape and raise awareness of the existing issues. For instance, new genre conventions are first tested and may even cause audience resistance, but later are incorporated into the existing genre or form new ones. Familiarity with the genre traits creates expectations of narrative, characters, their behavior, and character archetypes. From film noir, we all expect a femme-fatale, a detective and a crooked law enforcement official. In horror films, the audience expects monsters, ghosts and other supernatural beings to hunt protagonists. However, the situation gains another dimension of comprehension when characters are anchored through the representation of specific nationalities. For decades, film scholars like bell hooks and many others explored the issue, especially bound to the racial minorities in the U.S. One particular category of film characters’ representation may have been overlooked despite posing significant interest from the historical perspective and contemporary geopolitical dynamics: the archetype of Russians in films. Their representation, which emerged from primarily negative connotations during the Cold War, underwent various transformations after the collapse of the U.S.S.R. to return to where it started in recent years. The following piece serves as a historical overview of the issue of Russian portrayal as a specific archetype in popular Western films. It intentionally avoids comprehensive research on philosophical, cultural and social levels, but presents resilient dynamics and illustrates how popular media creates, reinforces and transforms the nationally anchored archetype.\n\nThis collection of articles is one of the last achievements of the scientific project called Cinema in the Soviet Union at war, 1939-1949. This project was initiated by Valérie Pozner (CNRS, Arias THALIM) and Alexandre Sumpf (University of Strasburg, ARCHE, CERCEC) and its goal was to go way further than studies on a couple ofSoviet war films uniformly quoted by authors dealing with the role of cinema during the “Great patriotic war”. It meant to include in its scope documentaries, newsreels and cartoons in order to explore this crucial moment in the development of one of the most important creative cultures of film history.\n\nThis collection of articles is one of the last achievements of the scientific project called Cinema in the Soviet Union at war, 1939-1949. This special issue of Connexe dedicated to “War Spoliations and Cultural Transfers: The Case Study of Soviet Cinema (1939-1949)” aims to set the history of Soviet cinema during the Second World War in the context of European history and to highlight the issues of transfers and seizures which are better known when concerning other objects, as archives or works of art."
