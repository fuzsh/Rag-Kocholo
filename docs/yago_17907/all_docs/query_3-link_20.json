        "text": "The city of Vyborg and the area around it – Karelia – has been particularly on focus in our project. In this text I describe the trips we have done (to Vyborg and to Kurkiyoki) and the things it has enabled as well as the thoughts involved. I mention our interest in the Aalto library (and libraries in general) as well as the themes of ruins, restoration, touring, nationalty, nostalgia and re-visit things done on this project.\n\nBy delving into history we aim to have a relationship to a place, to form a way for an occupation of sorts. Some trips are meant to be instigators of processes, where the exploration of a site is a way to cohabit memory in a landscape, or activate attitudes and sentiments related to time (like nostalgia) through our temporary visits. But visiting is mostly about confronting the limitations we travel with.\n\nThis project started with centering around ‘Viipuri’ (Vyborg in English), a small town in Russia about one hour away from St.Petersburg and close to the Finnish-Russian border. This location, near the border of Finland and Russia, having its own position within the history of these countries, served as a setting as we aimed at embarking on a sort of excavation; a survey around the thematics of knowledge, memory and history as attached to the concept of ruins (sites, situations) and thinking of what is neglected, in close proximity to what is preserved.\n\nWe (Miina Hujala & Arttu Merimaa) visited Vyborg in the early 2017 and later that year installed a video work ‘The Real Snow White’ by the artist Pilvi Takala to the Aalto library (in December 2017). This served as an introduction for some of the themes in the project.\n\nWe have wanted to deal with ‘libraries’ in our curatorial practice before as well. The 2016 exhibition ‘In Common’ became the setting for our first project and collaboration as part of the Connecting Points programme that set the tone for the exploration of ‘knowledge production and distribution’ through utilising a local library in St. Petersburg as a venue, and also activated our focus regarding working in Russia.\n\nThe Aalto library as a specific case example aroused our interest from the first time we visited it in early 2017.\n\nThe Aalto library was completed in 1935, the competition where Alvar Aalto received the first prize was held already in 1927. After the war between Finland and the Soviet Union (1940-1945) it had been neglected for a while, before being used again as a local library during the Soviet era.\n\nI saw an image of it in its overgrown state at the Vyborg Castle Museum, it had been in a state of ruin after the war and during Soviet times renovated between 1955-1961.\n\nAnd now quite recently, renovated (between 1994-2013) from the condition that it was in during Soviet times. It was reconstructed to suit its purpose and to emphasize the aesthetic of the architecture. Renovators became re-creative conservators adjusting also its purpose from being ‘just’ a library serving a public, to that of a library as an monument of architecture, serving a purpose as a landmark, now using the methods of retouching.\n\nRenovation is writing a new chapter into the building’s history, here uncovering layers meant building new ones. The Aalto Library in Vyborg is a cultural center offering multiple kinds of activities, which we learned of in early spring 2017 whilst meeting for the first time Helena Rogozina (the director) and Tatiana Svetelnikova (deputy director) of the Alvar Aalto library in Vyborg. For the centennial of The Finnish State (in 2017), there was a concert held at the hall of the library, where a large part of the audience had come from Finland.\n\nLibraries are in many ways, the churches of our time. They have been built to contain value of the human endeavor (in the particular forms as text and books.) But libraries shouldn’t be seen as only through the eyes of proclaimed archival or use value, as they are testaments of the past to be activated with live exploration. Passing time at a library has become the Libraries are in many ways the churches of our time. They have been built to contain the value of human endeavors (in the particular form of text and books.) But libraries shouldn’t be seen only through the eyes of archival or use value, as they are testaments from the past to be activated through live exploration. Passing time at a library has become a physical place for public and social visibility. When we feel the the lack of ‘agoras’ we arouse the need to understand what we create spaces for. Perhaps libraries should contain food banks, not just cafés. Libraries are fountains of learning. Loaning – a simple method bypassing the predatory exclusion of possession as owning – is all about the possibility to access information that is free and for all. As our project looked onto the era of mis- and disinformation, mostly prevalent in social (and other) media, it soon led us to look at the library as a physical space, a concrete building, that as an institution is a distillation and a mark of the value of continuity, as well as the manifestation of the variety of pursuits that can exist side by side with ‘disinterested respect’. The custom in the libraries to expect silence is an important element of this. I see small gestures as bearing more meaning than usually they are credited for.\n\nThere are numerous amounts of information available of the city of Vyborg in Finnish, perhaps even more numerous volumes of Aalto’s architecture in There is numerous information available on the city of Vyborg in Finnish, perhaps even more numerous volumes on Aalto’s architecture in Finnish and English; to highlight a recent English-language dissertation focusing on the Aalto Library by Laura Berger: ‘The Building that Disappeared’ (Aalto University publication series, Doctoral dissertations 127/2018).\n\nThe restoration of the library is well documented also. [For instance in these books published by Rakennustieto Oy: Alvar Aalto Library in Vyborg – Saving a Modern Masterpiece (part 1, 2009 and part 2, 2015).\n\nArtist Liisa Roberts made a work centered around Vyborg and the library called ‘What’s the Time in Vyborg?’ (2001–2004). [Information regarding the project distilled here: https://ateneum.fi/tapahtumat/film-screening-whats-the-time-in-vyborg/?lang=en or in here https://www.e-flux.com/announcements/42676/liisa-roberts/].\n\nAttuning to what a place is, is about forming a set of temporal and spatial characteristics that we contribute to it as a place – to make it as ‘a site’.\n\nVyborg as a place has aroused not only nostalgia-infused interest, which gains its energy from the possibility to offer a glimpse (as some cities that have changed their ‘hosts’ do) of alternation. Evoking a sense of exploring ‘what used to be here’, looking at the way different cultures are reflected in the built, but also lived environment. Aalto Library is in many ways at the epicenter of this kind of transformation.\n\nThe Vyborg Research Trip 2019: Ruins\n\nThere is always some ‘residue’. In the Aalto Library in Vyborg there are still some books that were part of the collection during the time when it was a Finnish city. The villas around Vyborg in the Karelia region have been (during the times of the Tsars and still now) the summer residences of the upper class and others. The changes and different phases of alteration have been documented, pictured, and described in multiple publications. The city of Vyborg especially has gained a steady flow of attention from the Finnish side, which accelerated after 1991 when the border became more open, and so movement became easier. Looking at how the city was and is now is found to be very alluring. I’ll mention the publications of Petri Neuvonen who has looked extensively at the architecture of the city. [Available publications include: ‘Linnoituksesta historialliseksi muistomerkiksi: Viipurin vanhakaupunki 1856-1939’, Aalto-yliopisto, 2017 and ‘Viipuri : rakennusperinnön seitsemän vuosisataa’, Suomalaisen Kirjallisuuden Seura, 2008. (In Finnish.) Also ‘Viipuri : opas kaupunkiin = Vyborg : town guide’ / Petri Neuvonen, Tuula Pöyhiä, Tapani Mustonen, Rakennustieto, 1999. A link in Finnish to an (pay-wall) article about Neuvonen in Helsingin Sanomat: https://www.hs.fi/kulttuuri/art-2000005495543.html]. A space is never without movement and place is never ‘created’ or ‘marked as something’ without the aim to stabilize the ‘reading’ of it. There have been, and are currently, attempts to renovate the old town of Vyborg.\n\nThe Vyborg Research Trip 2019: Restauration\n\nThe renovation of the renowned park Monrepos (which is currently underway) provides a look into the very core of how we attune to the renovation, here as a park – as a ‘space of recreation’. The park was initially designed for the Russian noble family of Nicolay and still possesses the tombs of its wealthy owners. It is now being built up again, taking its form from its previously quite free stage, to a more ‘structured’ Russian-style one. In some cases, renovation becomes removal of almost all of the original materials and building a new ‘simulacra’ of the building in question. The question of what is kept, and at what cost, can be a very controversial issue (A link to Finnish language article on YLE that describes how the main building of the park has been dismantled: https://yle.fi/uutiset/3-10947415).)\n\nWhat does this allure towards the derelict parks and urban sites (in Russia and elsewhere) mean? (Derelict only compared to the expectation of some cultural norm). I think they provide what all of us sometimes need; things left as they are.\n\nElina Vainio worked with a sentence she found in Svetlana Alexievich’s book ‘Secondhand Time’ forming the sentence with words in Russian made from fabric. And in Vyborg this fabric sentence was to find its place in an abandoned former warehouse near the train tracks. Our entire group: Miina Hujala, Arttu Merimaa, Elina Vainio, Eero Yli-Vakkuri, Iona Roisin, Matti Kunttu and Katja Kalinainen – and on the first day in Vyborg also our group was fortified by artist Jussi Kivi – ventured around Vyborg looking at the places and sites, in their various forms of decay and upkeep.\n\nIn addition to the park, library and the overall old town, we also sniffed around Patterinmäki (once a military compound) passing the sports field and (obviously) visited the medieval castle, with its under renovation tower. But the derelict, trash-filled building, brimming with discarded bottles (and I would also testify to excrement of all sorts), was the one that drew Elina’s attention. The sentence began in Vyborg, with the first part installed there, and was later to be continued in Vladivostok, installed in a site with similar characteristics (I would say in an even more obscure location).\n\n[The videos of Elina Vainio’s work can also be accessed online through the exhibition’s webpage: http://linnake.net/invariousstagesofruins.html ]\n\nKARELIA TOURING / NATIONALITY / NOSTALGIA\n\nCrossing the border from Finland to Russia is like reading a different translation of a book, or looking at a painting of the same view, where things are very recognizable yet something hints otherwise.\n\nFor me there is a ‘paradigmatic uncanniness’ in the concept of ‘Russia’. This is present in the feeling of how Russia is ‘familiar, but foreign’. There’s this inattentive prejudice involved that seems to seep in when wielding concepts such as ‘nationality’ or ‘nation’. The limiting capacity of the notion of ‘nationality’ is of course its problematic strength. Being ‘Finnish’ (the national label attributed to me) and with a relationship to a notion of ‘Russia’ can be an act of so-called ‘cultural mapping’. Nominating ‘Russia’ as a terrain in proximity to ‘the area known as Finland’ is a co-constitutive act of both of these realms. The perceived actuality of the concept of ‘Russia’ is animating the existence of ‘Finland’ as a neighboring nation/culture/realm. The urge to define any kind of identities as cultures; active in habits, gestures, beliefs and practices (and used in occupying terrains with those notions) is not without its personal translations. I don’t want to be tip-toeing around the issue of how recognising what constitutes ‘familiar’ and ‘foreign’ is laden with biases– that the attributes given to ‘nationalities as something’ are actively imagined (when also aimed to explore the ‘liminality’ of these perceptions).\n\n‘Nationality’ as a concept is an arousal of limitation as an ‘essentia’ – stifling the multitude into a referent. I look at names as placeholders, tokens for marking up stages and routes.\n\nRussia has been saturated through the division between the concept of ‘East’ and ‘West’; as in the 1800s with the disputes among slavophiles and westernizers, prevalent during Soviet times and activating current neo-nationalisms. The concept of ‘West’ is needed as the enemy image for the despotic power elite in the current state of Russia. Discarding the conceptual heritage of these points on the compass is obstructed by the reflection of how the ‘imaginary’ has always held its core in the possibility of providing alternating readings. (This related to Alexei Yurchak’s definition of the ‘Imaginary West’ in the late Soviet period, where the ‘West’ and its manifestation as style, music, and naming, for instance meant that: “It was not literal meaning of these symbols that mattered most but their linking of here and now to an imaginary ‘elsewhere’).”\n\nThe allegorical possibilities of notions, are something that affect the reading of what ‘Russia’ still is, and concepts of ‘East’ and ‘West’ have been used constantly as tools for ‘othering’ – not only emphasising the perceived ‘differences’, but making statements as evaluations based on those. I am myself caught in this trap of comparison and expectation; a perceived uncanniness built by the similarities in a landscape that is familiar to me (I did grow up close to the Russian border). The so called nature (as the entanglement of the characteristics of the environment) is similar and Vyborg’s centre (which architecture-wise differs from all Russian towns that I have visited and is not so prevailingly Soviet in outlook) hints to familiar notes for me. Here are thus some nutrients for “reflective nostalgia”, to use Svetlana Boym’s term.\n\nAlongside Vyborg, our group visited Kurkiyoki, a small village in the Karelian Isthmus [https://www.britannica.com/place/Karelian-Isthmus]. It was called ‘Kurkijoki’ (literally translated as ‘crane river’) during the ‘Finnish era’ and in 1939 had a population of 10,032.\n\nIt is currently visited regularly by Finnish groups that reminisce and also pay tribute to their family past, which we came across during our visit; seeing one group come with a rented coach, place a garland on a memorial and then drive away – a very usual activity I’ve understood. We also bumped into two regular visitors from Finland that stayed on a house next to ours, that come there (it seemed) to experience “the sense of belonging”, as I would paraphrase their sentiment and agenda. Active from Finland is a ‘Kurkijoki-seura’ [https://www.kurkijokiseura.com/ and info of the place: http://www.kurkijoki.fi/] and there is also a newspaper (https://www.kurkijokelainen.fi/). After the Second World War when Finland, as part of the peace treaty terms, ceded the Karelia area to the Soviet Union, the population of the area, of almost half a million, was relocated to other areas in Finland. The idea (partly) was to keep the villages intact so that people from Kurkijoki for instance would all move to the same area in Finland. But evidently finding suitable places was a patchwork of sorts, people that had had farms for instance were given state-backed loans so that they could take up farms that were allocated from the state’s land – rejuvenating inoperative farms, or then piecing together allotments from private land. Nonetheless, this created spots where previous inhabitants became concentrated in certain areas, or villages (such as the ‘Kurkijokelainen’ that is published from Loimaa, on the West coast of Finland.) This re-location of sorts is also reflected in place names across Finland, as depicted in Pohjois-Laajalahti, Espoo where streets have been named after places of the ceded Karelia.\n\nThat entire period after the war in Finland (as elsewhere) was obviously traumatic, and I can’t help but wonder if I might be tapping in (as a grandchild of an evacuee myself) to the same nostalgia-river that is bursting in various activities and societies configured around the former ‘Karelia’ region. In trying to understand the past, am I using the ‘usual’ methods available like visiting Karelia for instance, trying to find some sort of grounding factor – the source, the ‘real’?\n\nAs it is worth mentioning here, particularly during the time of ‘National Romanticism’ in Finland (active from the mid-1800s to early-1900s) Karelia was sought after to provide a source for cultural roots. This was presented and made visible not only in the paintings that focused on landscape, and the motifs of Kalevala (the national epic, also ‘foraged’ from Karelia and consisting of poems initially only recited orally) shifting through the pens and perspectives of the 19th century.\n\nBut I am not actually looking at any kind (alleged or other) of ‘source narrative’. But evidently it is hard to avoid the connotations of a sort of personal and national ‘creation myth’, that is based in finding ‘grounding factors’ through looking at history. Perhaps to contest that, I see visits to the sites of contemporary Karelia as an opportunity to disable these conceptions; to activate one’s own thoughts and expectations, but to see the exceptions from the expected and be open to the un-expected. For me it is the realisation that as a topic and as an actual area, Karelia shouldn’t be left to a set of notions aimed at securing a reading that caresses one’s longing for ‘an authentic past’.\n\nUsing Svetlana Boym’s terms “restorative nostalgia” and “reflective nostalgia” I could say that in the lack of evoking any kind of sentiment of a ‘return to home’ (restorative nostalgia), I partake in a “meditation on history and passage of time, cherish[ing] scattered fragments of memory” (reflective nostalgia).\n\nTapping into a Finnish song made popular by Annikki Tähti (in the mid-1950s) Iona Roisin, a British ‘native’ looks into the nostalgia elements from the position of an activated outsider; asking in her piece: Muistatko? (A Method) how can others’ nostalgia be reflected and entered? Is nostalgia that is not ‘yours’ like a phantom limb, where you experience it, notice the smell of it, but can’t place the resonating object anywhere? We get addicted to nostalgia as a longing for authenticity in feelings, it’s longing for a more uncluttered view than the continuous living present. Nostalgia activates ruins by building on them the dreams of what could (have) been, and we should be wary of what we build.\n\nBoym writes: “Nostalgics of the second type [reflective] are aware of the gap between identity and resemblance: The home is in ruins or, on the contrary, has been just renovated and gentrified beyond recognition.” (Svetlana Boym: The future of Nostalgia, 2001.)\n\nOne of the things that we encountered during our small one-night stay in Kurkiyoki was the house itself that we stayed in (that I found on AirBnB, just by chance). Designed by Finnish architect Lars Sonck for his brother, who didn’t occupy it for a long time (only between 1915–1919).\n\nThe house was used during Soviet times for multiple things, as a headquarters for the local collective farm for instance. Then after the Soviet collapsed, it was purchased by a very active local lady, whose grandson (alongside his mother, both initially from St.Petersburg) currently hosts lodging services there. There seemed to be some dispute in the air, that some villagers weren’t so happy about how the house was attained, but I can’t testify to anything other than that during our visit we were very satisfied and exceptionally well taken care of, with good vegetarian food served for us in an authentically casual setting. Our host did voice his desire to connect to people that would be knowledgeable about the architecture of Lars Sonck, so as to be able to add understanding of the value of the building, and so to be officially acknowledged as his design, and understandably to gain also more credit to help out with the costs of renovation.\n\nKurkiyoki, despite the briefness of our stay, seemed to provide abundance – as a small village with a vibrancy that is lacking in the countryside that I know of. Climbing onto the hill of bedrock that dominates the landscape at Kurkiyoki, looking onto all the small houses and hearing the voices of children and dogs, as well as music with the smell of grilling on a Saturday night, seeing people returning from ‘banja’ (a privately owned, but communally used sauna) – one couldn’t avoid the scent of ‘longing’ and nostalgia in the air.\n\nThe desire for a simpler, more ‘down-to-earth’ life, perhaps. The lure of imagining things differently that is possible only when one is a visitor, the reality of the people living there being of course different. For example the drivers that we hired to transport our small group around were predominantly former fire fighters that had had an immense reduction to their salaries (from 30,000 rubles to 9000, if I remember correctly) and thus had turned to driving people like us, touring tourists, around. The roads around Karelia area are in poor condition, the smaller the road the poorer it is. The roads that are being rebuilt currently seem more like surgical operations, wounds that are meant to last forever, as corruption uses them to milk the money allocated for infrastructure into some pocket that never seems to be filled. The corruption in Russia is a very real and deep fact, mentioned also by our driver, who had to factor in the time spend driving these same roads back after dropping us off, reflected in the price that I first didn’t want to accept, wanting stubbornly perhaps to cling to the notion that people are now milking us, the sentiment being ‘god forbid if someone gets to rip me off’. But paying ‘premium’ as they say for the effort of an entire day’s driving is in the end only fair, when you pay the amount of around half of someone’s monthly salary in Russia, at the price of a one person, one-way train ticket to Joensuu in Finland, for instance. The difference is real.\n\nThe local museum in Kurkiyoki, directed and up-kept by a very active lady, in what I understood to be a one person operation, activating of course a lot of locals in various activities, e.g. felting.\n\nThe museum exhibited a wide range of paraphernalia – consisting of various forms and describing the uses for lichen for instance (there used to be a very prominent Finnish lichen scholar that lived in Kurkijoki called Veli Räsänen).\n\nThe museum displayed all kinds of things excavated from the area, from war time scraps (Second World War mostly) to mammoth teeth. The excavated bounty was presented Russian-style, things added together in this very eclectic, chaotic, but kind of impressive, way. The Bronze Age jewellery mixed with symbols of the 20th century. The divisions are attempted but when you come around to it, it’s more interesting to think of the museum as a very well organized attic. A cabinet of curiosity nonetheless.\n\nThe vibrancy of contemporary Kurkiyoki is of its own making, but one cannot avoid the fact that some of it is based on the same elements that people across the ages have found alluring, like the surrounding topography. There is a river/stream that flows through the middle of the village, and the village itself is surrounded by forests and fields. But the thing that we were attracted to in Kurkiyoki was also to do with our personal interests, attributed to the things we experienced.\n\nOne of the things was artist Eero Yli-Vakkuri’s ongoing focus on mineral water, which he makes performances related to. This led to visits to natural fountains in the Karelia region. In Kurkiyoki, we asked the director of the local museum whether there would be a fountain in the vicinity, and were glad when provided with directions as well as a hand-drawn map with which we were able to locate a fountain that allegedly had silver in it. We located the fountain in the middle of a forest near the village.\n\nIt is used by the people in addition to the ones situated in the village, partly because it provided better quality water. This was the first of a total of three fountains we visited, with Eero collecting a water sample from each of them in an old pickled cucumber jar that we received from very nice ladies at the local store (initially to carry hot water to our instant coffees). This was well in line with the DIY research attitude that we have had across our excursions.\n\nThe initial push to visit natural fountains in Russia came from a website that Eero had found listing different sites around the globe. The site [http://mineralwaters.geo.uu.nl/world.php] had coordinates for a fountain located at Klyuchevoye [http://mineralwaters.geo.uu.nl/mineralwater.php?Country_id=1071&Brand=Kluchevaya], the visiting of which was one of our main missions on the trip. (We drove there after venturing briefly to the Motonye near Lake Ladoga.)\n\nThe site of the fountain at Kluchevoye was even more in the middle of a forest than the Kurkiyoki one, not far from the road though, and using the maps in our smartphones we were able to locate a stream that was running, in the middle of nowhere as it seemed. The fountain had marks of use and human presence, as there had been a steel structure installed (and other weird objects discarded in it). But by tapping into an online source, locating it became a task, a pursuit and a routing method. Our driver (not surprised as it is usual for Finnish groups asking to drive into the middle of nowhere, to visit the ‘ancestral’ stone foundations of houses for instance) seemed also genuinely interested as he was snapping pictures of this discovered fountain, or should I say, forest stream, as it was not covered by any structure.\n\nWhilst driving there we noticed a signpost for another well that was marked on Google Maps as well, and thought that as it was near-by we might as well visit there too. We then found a well that had once been part of a larger estate now being used by locals. It was worthwhile to take a water sample as well.\n\nAll of the samples were placed under a taste test on board the train when returning back to Finland, and the blind taste test resulted in the clear ‘winner’ being the fountain in Kurkiyoki. No water is the same or stays the same. Eero performed his piece: ‘Mineral Water Exploration (with electronics and taste buds)’ later in Moscow and in Vladivostok.\n\nIn the piece, he points out how through filtering and manipulating the minerals in the water, the taste is fabricated, simulated and activated. In Eero’s piece sound was also generated.\n\nENDNOTES / SENTIMENTS\n\nDuring our research trips to Vyborg, as well as to Karelia we have definitely been outsiders, ones that perform touristic acts and follow tracks, even while straying from them and adding things (like natural fountains) onto the list to explore.\n\nI have asked myself whether we do these trips to places that have ruins (like Vyborg) to ­try and find some form of ‘realness’ that polished and kept environments and buildings won’t provide?\n\nIt is like trying to lure the beauty of the dead stone, not carved out as marble, but as a derelict truth that we don’t really know what makes a stone ‘dead’. Our lives and imaginations animate things that don’t reproduce (or transpire) in themselves. The minerals found in water come from the ‘stones’ and the soil that the water filters through. Touching things with bare hands is caressing and learning at the same time. It is this ability to go to a place to come to ‘know’ about it that attracts not only liminal curiosity (e.g. how can I test the limit of my understanding) but more evidently it brings into view what kind of attitudes are aroused. Visiting Karelia area has been, for me, a litmus test of my cultural (mis)-conceptions.\n\nAuthenticity is a random occurrence, it is a temporal mixture of elements (sometimes in a certain place). It occurs at no certain time but when aimed at recreating, we seem to venture into looking for things it ‘originates’. Still as escaping constantly, like the other flows we are amidst, fabricating authenticity is an oxymoron, but still a fascinating one."
