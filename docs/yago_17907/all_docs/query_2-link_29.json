It is initially ruled by Ratsherr Carl Lebenhaupt.\n\nIt has the village Torma.\n\nLayout[]\n\nAccessible area\n\nPlayer Lord's Hall Prison\n\nSiege Ladders\n\nThe Lord's Hall and prison are on opposing ends on the sides of the player as he/she passes through the gates.\n\nDuring a siege, four ladders are used: two on each side of the gate. However, the player spawns behind a bridge, and access to the water is blocked by invisible barriers, making the narrow bridge an easy target for the defenders. To minimize losses as the attacker, it is worth choosing the option to proceed with the siege without the player's involvement.\n\nWikipedia has an article on this subject at:\n\nVyborg Castle"
