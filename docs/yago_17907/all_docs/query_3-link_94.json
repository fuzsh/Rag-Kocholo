        "text": "This study aimed to analyze many archival published documents and contemporary testimonies at the beginning of the 18th century, which reflects little-known facts of medicine history. The creation history of military medicine in Saint Petersburg, an integral part of the military history of Russia, was presented against the background of the most important events of the Northern War against Sweden (1700–1721) and military reform. The role of Robert Erskine (1677–1718), the reformer of Russian medicine, the head of the entire military medical service of Russia since 1706, the first Russian archiater, Surgeon in Ordinary to the King, and loyal companion and friend of Peter I was carefully studied, as he played a crucial role in establishing military medicine and medical education in Russia, mainly in Saint Petersburg. R. Erskine, who had encyclopedic-level knowledge, was also the creator and head of the Kunstkamera, the first public natural science museum in Russia (1714). The report of the head of the Moscow hospital on Yauza, Doctor N.L. Bidloo, to the Holy Synod (1722) with description and analysis of the most important facts of the Russian medicine history was also studied. Detailed documents on the number of sick and wounded people in Saint Petersburg since 1708 were presented. Not only military hospitals but also medical students in the military capital of Russia before 1715, had been documented. The documentary lists of Navy doctors from Saint Petersburg and lists of medical students who “stayed in Saint Petersburg” at the Navy Hospital, with the indication of the salary by articles (categories) for 1710, as well as documents on the number of sick and wounded people of the ground forces for 1712 and 1713 (Russian State Archives of the Navy), were presented. The medical staff lists of the Russian army for 1711 were examined. The absence of a large specialized medical complex at Vyborg side and insufficient suitable hospitals of any medical units located in wooden barracks at other territories cannot be proof of the absence of any hospitals until 1715 or medical schools until 1733. Ignorance of the military history of Russia can lead to numerous mistakes by historians who are interested in military medicine."
