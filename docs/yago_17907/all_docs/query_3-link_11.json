In the beginning of the twentieth century The Scandinavian Charity Foundation, for instance, was headed by Emmanuel Nobel, a representative of the family of “Russian Rockefellers” and one of the nephews of Alfred Nobel.ii Internationalism has been rooted in the urban tradition of St. Petersburg from its very birth and its naming – it was the first Russian city to be given a foreign name.\n\nThe Nobels in Russia\n\nThe name of Alfred Nobel has become so distinguished, and yet still little is known either about the whole dynasty of the Nobels or their intellectual heritage and overall impact on various aspects of modern life. The story of the Nobel family in Russia is a fascinating drama, the embodiment of the contradictions and trappings of modernity.iii Just like the age in which the family prospered, there was, on the one hand, a devotion to technological progress as the main engine of humanity’s progress, but on the other, an investment in the notion of the intellect drawn from the Renaissance – inasmuch that scientific invention should be the servant of humanity’s physical and spiritual prosperity.\n\nEven though the story of Alfred Nobel’s family is by no means a secret, with many of their inventions widely used around the world, less is commonly known either about their personal biographies or about the revolutionary scientific heritage the family fostered. Moreover, little about the Nobels’ time in Russia, where their industrial and oil empires were born and developed back in the nineteenth century, has trickled into public knowledge. Even though Russian sources on the Nobels’ time in Russia are quite extensive, interest shown in them has mostly focused on the family’s economic activities, technological inventions, and their industrial entrepreneurship.iv Public sources in other languages are even more scarce, and the information on, for example, Wikipedia provides us with just a modest introduction to the family’s major names and a brief overview of their inventions.\n\nSince the beginning of the century interest in the history of the Nobel family in Russia has grown significantly. Brita Åsbrink focuses on the history of the Nobel’s oil enterprise developed in the Russian Empire before the 1917 Revolution and is among the chief contributors to the online Branobel History Project and The Branobel History Digital Archives,v that collected over 50 000 digitalized documents related to the Nobel’s oil industry as well as publications on biographies and inventions of the Nobel brothers. In 2001 Brita Åsbrink published a book Ludvig Nobel: ”Petroleum har en lysande framtid.” En historia om eldfängd olja och revolution i Baku [Ludvig Nobel: “Petroleum has a bright future”],vi which remains the most exhausting source on the Nobel’s oil business and family life in Baku.\n\nThe ideological drive of the Bolshevik Revolution – to destroy the past, to divorce the present from previous experiences and forms of heritage in order to start anew – not only meant the literal destruction of the previous era’s material heritage, but it targeted the destruction of memory, by divorcing the present from history itself. These were not only the achievements by actors of the past that were to be undermined and neglected, but these were their very names that were to be forgotten and erased from a new reality. Soon after the Bolshevik Revolution, the Ludvig Nobel plant was re-named the Russian Diesel Plant, thus eliminating the very name of the Nobels from the “new paradigm.”\n\nThe technological achievements and the whole organization of the Nobel’s enterprises were declared the achievements of the new Soviet regime, while the family’s contribution to the country’s economic and technological development was severely undermined even in the professional studies and reports by the Soviet scholars. As a result, the Nobel’s heritage was forgotten in the Soviet Union and their name was connected only to the international prizes established by Alfred Nobel.\n\nA researcher on the Nobels, Vladimir Meshkunov, states that “unfortunately, later everything had been done to undermine the role of the Nobel family in the development of the Russian mechanical engineering and oil industry.”xxiv He admits the willful ignorance of the Nobel’s patented inventions within Soviet publications. And when various technological achievements, which were realized at the Ludvig Nobel plant, are in fact mentioned, they are, continues Meshkunov, often referred to as the products of the Russian Diesel plant – a name given to the factory after the Revolution. While the Ludvig Nobel plant is merely listed among others, he notes, the Russian Diesel plant is introduced as the central Soviet scientific hub. Thus readers get an impression that two different plants are spoken about.xxv\n\nThe Nobel’s housing estate in St. Petersburg was also nationalized, and apartment blocs were subject to the new norms of housing distribution, forming the so-called obschezhities and kommunalkas – apartments that were shared by several tenants who received housing based on the principle that each person would be given eight square meters of personal living space.\n\nIt is only by chance that the contemporary residents of the Nobel’s town in St. Petersburg are aware of the history of the estate and its impact on the further development of urban planning and mass housing production in Russia. The owners’ mansions were turned into public institutions, leaving unacknowledged the history of the place. The thread of history linking material objects –in this case buildings to their creators was severed. Principles of historical montage were applied to cut this heritage off from the Soviet narrative hegemonic at that time.\n\nThe long decades of neglect of the Nobel’s material and scientific heritage made the area invisible within the contemporary urban landscape, reducing it to a state of non-existence; little information about the Nobels living in Russia or their heritage was ever promoted among the general population or the academic communities during the Soviet times. Not only would contemporary passers-by not see many of the buildings that required renovation as part of the city’s valuable heritage, but the district’s residents remained indifferent. The reality was that special attention given to these architectural objects would only compound the miserable existence of the residents, pulling the buildings out of any context and any connection to the present appearance of urban spaces in the area. Rather than inducing any feeling of empathy in the hearts of inhabitants, the mute and nameless urban ruins, when neglected, were just devalued in their eyes.\n\nOblivion as remedy\n\nOn the other side of the iron curtain the Russian history of the Nobel family had also been muted, but as a traumatic experience. Revolution turned the Nobels into refugees trying to escape arrest, fleeing the country in severe winter conditions, risking the lives of their young children. Thus, members of the Nobel family, who were born already outside of Russia were already alienated from their family’s Russian background. As Gustaf Nobel notes:\n\nI wasn’t really a participant in any affairs regarding Russia, because — you know the history — my family: my father, Gunnar Nobel had to flee from Russia with his brother Alfred, his little sister Nina, and mother Eugenie, as did my grandfather Gösta Nobel, who was not with them in Baku at that time; he was in St. Petersburg. Emanuel Nobel also left the country. They had to flee, and they were on the run for one and a half months. Afterwards my father never talked about it for the rest of his life. Up until his death he said nothing. He would say, “I don’t want to talk about it”. So, we didn’t hear much about Russia or the Revolution from him. But then his brother, my uncle, was a bit more open about it because he was three years older than my father… So, we had a little information from him, but not much, really. Russia wasn’t very present when we were children. But as we grew up, we became more interested in the history, of course, and we started studying it to a certain extent. Growing up, there was not very much to say about it, since no one talked to us about it.xxvi\n\nThe exclusion of such a huge part of the family’s heritage was a symptom of a trauma that could not be cured, only repressed. Thus the attempt to connect back to a time and geographical spaces that were irretrievably lost was clearly impossible. To accept it and to have it fore-given by those who possessed neither experience of what was lost, nor the memories of it, could be achieved only through oblivion, as Lowenthal notes: “in nations as in families, to forget can be to forgive.”xxvii\n\nThe Nobels hence collectively shared the ultimate loss of their material and cultural heritage, an experience that all citizens of the country had gone through as a consequence of the Revolution. A huge part of the Empire’s population, especially those who owned something, became refugees or were exiled within the state that grew on the lands of their former homeland. The other half of the population became internal migrants. They were alienated from their traditional backgrounds, when forced to leave their native villages for alien cities and vice versa, escaping to the countryside from both hunger and civil war; detached from their homes and families, estranged from any memories of their past that could be a threat to survival in the present.\n\nNeglected future of the muted past\n\nRenaming the past to remember the future\n\nThe story of the Nobel heritage in Russia is as dramatic as it is exemplary for the history of the whole country. Having said this, their industrial heritage, even though deprived of its identity, was not physically demolished. When compared to the churches, the fate of the urban industrial heritage in St. Petersburg depended on severe conditions of neglect, rather than on supplies of explosives and budgets available to the Bolsheviks for their physical destruction.\n\nThe architecture of factories and plants was not often particularly characteristic of the rejected ideology, but rather indicative of the times in which they were constructed, which, while remaining indelibly marked by cultural and social backgrounds, could nonetheless be re-appropriated for the ideological purposes of the state much easier than the onion domes and belfries of Russian Orthodox cathedrals. Even when a factory or a Worker’s Club was established inside a church, what was required was still the physical deformation of its décor and inner space so that the workers did not associate their time in the club with visits to religious sermons.\n\nThe tradition of architectural transnationalism in industrial architecture, which blurred any reference of industrial quarters to particular (inter)national and ideological stances, helped their physical preservation. Yet, industrial architecture had undergone the most elaborate revision of its identity through the innovative use of the technique of renaming as a practice of oblivion and heritage fabrication.\n\nThe Revolution transformed life on all levels of human existence and recorded that transformation in the total and ultimate re-naming of everything – from the name of the country to the name of its former capital, of its people, of its past, present, and future.\n\nThe act of re-naming took place on an unprecedented scale. It became an innovative tool for appropriating St. Petersburg’s urban space (to phrase things in Henri Lefebvre’s terms) and provided an architectural articulation of the new ideological state apparatus (ISA) in the new Soviet state (to borrow some terminology from Louis Althusser).xxx In the Bolsheviks’ hands, the act of renaming became more than an instrument of propaganda of a new political regime and a way to establish the legitimacy of the new government, as had traditionally happened in the history of many countries.xxxi Renaming here was used as an innovative weapon of destruction of the past. Sinking the ideologically hostile objects into oblivion, it became a weapon for murdering histories and the memories.\n\nThe companies founded in St. Petersburg by foreigners were stripped of their international identity by means of renaming. The plants’ titles usually carry names of their owners as well as revealing the type of enterprise housed in the factory walls. For instance: Telephone Plant of the Russian Joint Stock Company ‘L. M. Ericsson and Co;’ Mechanical Plant ‘Ludvig Nobel;’ Joint Stock Company of Russian Electro-Technical Plants ‘Siemens & Halske.’\n\nThe replacement of names was not as much a fight against the products, but rather against their producers; it helped to eliminate all records of foreigners’ presence in the city as well as any reference to their contribution to the country’s industrialization. Starting with the first years of the Soviet state, the pre-revolutionary Russia was introduced in textbooks and state media as an undeveloped agrarian country, where illiterate workers lived their miserable lives while being heavily exploited by the capitalist class, and where feisty foreigners drained resources from the state.\n\nIn order to support this narrative of a disaster that the Bolshevik state had inherited from the Russian Empire, it was crucial to transfer objects of Industrial heritage from the cultural domain of Imperial Russia with its openness to the world of capitalism and international ‘predators’ to the heritage domain of the Soviet state.\n\nIn doing so it was important to erase all foreign names inscribed on factories’ facades and on the shops’ sideboards. Foreigners thus represented an ideology that was declared hostile to the new Soviet state. Their physical removal from the country, whether through exile or by execution, was necessary to break with the Imperialistic past and its ideology. It was equally necessary to re-appropriate their material and intellectual property, which was to be used as the ground for the new state development. The pre-revolutionary history had no legitimacy, hence no contribution from the past, be it local or international, could be recognized, since they were all equally alien to the new regime. The Bolshevik state invested tremendous efforts into cleansing and purifying the old urban spaces of all references to the defeated Empire. In Lefebvre’s terms, it meant that the country’s space was to return to its ‘natural’ state and pave the ground for new ideological appropriations.\n\nSubjecting all foreign elements to either external or internal exile was a widespread strategy in the Soviet Union. Expelling locals and foreigners to the outsides of the new world or uprooting them through endless forced migration had become another innovation of the new regime.\n\nThe inscription of new names to the bodies of newly colonized spaces was a necessary and a symbolic act of re-appropriating the urban space of Petrograd–Leningrad. Many districts in the city were occupied by plants and factories that carried the inappropriate names of local and international capitalists. Hundreds of Petrograd’s large factories and plants, along with countless workshops and studios were nationalized, their founders and owners evicted, and their workers swept off by the revolutionary wind. This heritage of the defeated Empire was to be re-integrated into the new ideological state apparatus of the Soviet state, to speak in Althusserian terms.\n\nAs the story of the Nobel family in Russia has demonstrated, the physical destruction of the industrial architectural heritage, trans-ideological in its architecture, was not necessary. The continuous oblivion and neglect combined with the wholesale re-naming of this heritage allowed for its symbolic and ideological re-birth and its material integration into the Soviet era.\n\nNew names given to old factories promoted the heroes of the Revolution. Such renamings were meant to lay the foundation for the development of new Soviet brands that would secure for Soviet industry a reputation for high-quality production. Both the local and the international names of various industrial companies were replaced with names to honor prominent Bolshevik Revolutionaries and famous communist leaders who otherwise had no connection to the industrial sites.xxxii\n\nAs part of international foreign heritage, Swedish factories in St. Petersburg were renamed to conceal their foreign background and to highlight their local origin, in order to be introduced as the latest achievement of the Soviet state. As was the case, for example, with The Mechanical Plant Ludvig Nobel, which was converted into the Russian Diesel plant after its nationalization in 1918.\n\nThe Nobel family’s good neighbors from the Vyborg Side did not escape the same fate. The Telephone Plant of the Russian Joint Stock Company L. M. Ericsson and Co. in St. Petersburg fell victim to the fashion of adding a stroke of ‘red’ to the name of enterprise in order to highlight the ideological succession over its former possessors. In 1919 the plant received the symbolic name of The Red Dawn. The Lessner Plant contributed to the trend of commemorating the heroes of the time and, ironically, preserved its international identity and even its reference to Lessner’s motherland; in the same year it was renamed as the State Mechanical Plant Named After Karl Marx.\n\nThe less appealing irony was bestowed upon the Odhner Plant, whose owner Willgodt Theophil Odhner died in 1905. The Odhner Plant continued operating, even if not as successful as during the life of its founder. The Revolution ended the plant’s history in Russia, but in 1918 the factory was reopened in Swedish Gothenburg under the name of The Original-Odhner. The ties to the origins and identity were restored on the Willgodt Theophil Odhner’s homeland, which was not the case in Soviet Russia, where the plant in Petrograd closed for good shortly after the revolution. Yet a decade later, in 1929, the production of the world-famous Odhner arithmometers was resurrected in the new Soviet capital of Moscow. Not only was the plant given the name that was as symptomatic for the country’s present at that time as it was symbolic for its upcoming future, but the very invention of Odhner, divorced from its past, received a new name, of Felix Dzerzhinsky. The name of the iconic iron calculator was called by the first name of the ‘iron Felix.’ This name brought the Ohdner’s inventions to thousands of factories around USSR, and, up until the mid-1970s, was the most universal and popular calculator.\n\nConclusion\n\nOnce the re-naming of plants and factories was complete, a declared course towards the rapid industrialization of the country was supported by the miraculous emergence of many ‘new’ Soviet plants around the country, which glorified the names of communist leaders, and thus fabricating a new heritage for new times.\n\nThe tremendous changes and dramatic events of the first Soviet decade resulted in a willful forgetting of the origins of industrial sites, which the Soviet State inherited from the Russian Empire. There were no former owners left to defend their confiscated property and to resist the ultimate degradation of their formerly blossoming industries. Proper names that had once become internationally recognized brands were soon forgotten.\n\nThe Bolsheviks did not invent the strategy of renaming urban spaces, but they refined it and intensified this practice in an obsessive need to establish the legitimacy of their succession over the past. They aimed at abandoning the past through the main tools of oblivion - those of depriving the heritage objects of their original names, which gave them legitimacy, and which constituted their identity. The new names had spoken neither for the past of their industrial sites nor, as time showed, projected them into a sustainable future.\n\nAs a result of decades of neglect and oblivion, many objects of industrial architecture had reached our times in ramshackle conditions, muted and invisible in the city’s landscape.\n\nThe heritage only exists as long as it is remembered and treated as a valuable legacy, and what is remembered constitutes the heritage. The Swedish industrial heritage in St. Petersburg remains in a semi-decadent and semi-ruined state, sharing the history of oblivion with Russia’s national past, which has not yet reached an agreement with its own present.\n\nIrina Seits is a researcher at Södertörn University (Sweden) with affiliation to the Centre for Baltic and East European Studies (CBEES).\n\ni Shustov A.

According to his theory, multiple ISAs belong mostly to the private domain, while RSAs (repressive state apparatuses), such as the police, army, courts, etc. – to the public domain. Yet, Althusser argues that this distinction immediately collapses; ISAs can operate both privately (e.g. families) and publicly (schools, churches). The main distinction is in actual fact the following: that while RSAs operate through repression and by violence, ISAs, even if they may include repressive elements, operate in, by, and through ideology.
