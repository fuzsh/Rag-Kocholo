        "meta_description": "In this article we focus on a remembered and imagined border: the changed border between Finland and Russia. We take as a case study the formerly Finnish now Russian town of Vyborg and its castle. The centuries-old castle has marked the limits of power in the Karelia region of the Swedish and Russian empires, the Finnish state, the Soviet Union and now Russia. We argue, based on our empirical studies that, for older generations of Finns, the castle can be the “symbol of everything”, whereas for today's Finnish teens the castle is a meaningless image. Thus this article also looks at the boundaries between social generations in their understandings of Finnish history and territory.",

        "text": "Changes of Direction: a Brief History of Vyborg and its Castle\n\nThe Lock Against the East\n\nVyborg and its Castle in Finnish Representations\n\nThe Castle, the Symbol of Everything?\n\n“A Longing that Crosses the Generation Gap”?\n\n30After being shown the photo of Vyborg castle the participants were asked to write free association lists in answer to the question “What comes to mind when you hear the word 'Vyborg'?” Only 25 % wrote down that they thought of the castle. And perhaps this can be explained by the fact they had just seen a picture of it (one list from Oulu says this explicitly). It is interesting that seeing a photo of the castle did not jog any memories or stories about it – as this is the effect it had for the respondents in Jani Karhu's study (see above). In their lists the vast majority of teen participants who did mention the castle wrote only “castle” / “Vyborg castle.” A few others elaborated a little; describing the castle as “kinda old” (student, Jyväskylä), “old-fashioned” (student, Turku) and fine or fancy (student, Turku). Again, however, these are things they could have gleaned from the photograph. One list from Oulu mistook the castle for one in Helsinki (“Vyborg castle. Is it the same thing as Suomenlinna [in Helsinki]? Yes”). Errors of geography occurred a few times in the lists with teens in Oulu (2 lists), Jyväskylä (1 list), Turku (1 list), and Rovaniemi (3 lists) all writing that Vyborg was somewhere in Finland. We could speculate that these are an expression of the mixed messages about Vyborg that circulate in Finland: that it is Russian but still, somehow, Finnish.\n\n31The lists were also examined to see if the castle was understood as a symbol of West vs. East, as “Finland's lock” as it is presented this way in Finnish tabloid media and is seen this way by some older respondents in Jani Karhu's survey (see above). Only six lists (of 260) mentioned the castle's defensive role and none linked this to wider ideas of West vs. East. Three lists stated that the castle offered protection or a defence against Russia, with one specifying that it offered Sweden protection. One list said that the castle defended Vyborg proper. Two lists mentioned a specific historic event which occurred at the castle: the so-called “Vyborg bang”. One list went into this in detail and was by far the most detailed answer given about the castle: “Vyborg castle and the big bang, when Finland, as a part of Sweden, defeated Russian troops in a siege [...] Vyborg castle was built on the Swedish and Russian border as a defence” (student, Lahti). Another list (from Rovaniemi) simply mentioned the “bang” and listed (incorrectly) the war during which it happened. These answers show the very faint signals, picked up only by a very few, about the castle as “defender” which have gotten through to this age group. These exceptions mean we cannot make a blanket generalisation about the teens' knowledge of and interest in the castle. Overall, however they seem to attach no emotional significance or meaning to it as a national symbol.\n\nMeanings of the Castle\n\nConclusion\n\n35As a conclusion, we suggest that Vyborg castle as a symbol of power institutions is a perfect example of how fixed generational ways of representing certain places of memory can create biased symbolic realities whereby today's foreign monuments are interpreted from the viewpoint of an imagined nationalistic past as unquestionable symbols of power institutions (Karelia and Finland) even when they have been only a vanishing part of the history of these.\n\n37Vyborg castle is, and has been made into, a commemorative historical site for Finns through repeated (re)use of (certain) photos of it and their contextualisation via their placement next to / with certain texts and their captions. For some Finns Vyborg castle is a representation of the past in the present associated primarily with pre-WWII memories which are kept alive and reinterpreted in the present. Vyborg castle is most meaningful for those Finns with a personal connection to Vyborg. Previous and ongoing research indicates that for Finnish High School students an isolated image of the castle is meaningless. This shows that Vyborg castle needs to be contextualized and given a background story linked to Finnish nation-building and the events of WWII in order to have symbolic value within Finnish discourses. The reason for this gap in meaning may be linked to how actively the affecting postmemory of losing the city has been transferred to the younger generation. Based on a large sample of Finnish high school students we can say that feelings of sorrow and bitterness about Vyborg seem not to have been adopted or expressed by the majority of young Finns; they do not feel Vyborg is “ours” as previous generations have done."
