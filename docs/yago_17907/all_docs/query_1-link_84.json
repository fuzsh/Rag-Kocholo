        "text": "Von Trier launches another acerbic attack on this all-American delusion in a tale curiously inspired by Happiness In Slavery, the preface to the infamous 1950s erotic novel The Story of O, which provides an account of the rejection of emancipation by some slaves in 1830s Barbados. As in Dogville, he adopts a Brechtian approach and reduces the sets to essential props and markings on the studio floor. But, this time, he has also stripped the narrative down to its bare essentials and, consequently, this is considerably leaner and meaner than its predecessor.\n\nHowever, with its story of a white woman who stops off at an Alabama plantation to teach its once repressed black residents about the benefits and duties of liberty, it's also potentially more combustible, as issues of race are always intensely sensitive and von Trier pulls few punches in either castigating the bigots of the extreme right or the patronising liberals of the left, whose good intentions have so often foundered on the rocks of bitter reality.\n\nBut, while the emphasis is primarily on the failure of the American people to live by the tenets of its much-vaunted constitution, this is also a cautionary tale about the perils of imposing democracy on populations ill-disposed towards its risky responsibilities a point that is made resoundingly clear during the provocative montage of stills under the closing credits, which juxtaposes images of the Ku Klux Klan and the Civil Rights movement with 9/11 and George W.Bush praying for ever-greater rectitude and the means to impose it.\n\nReplacing Nicole Kidman as Dogville's anti-heroine, Grace, Bryce Dallas Howard exhibits a chilling combination of arrogance and inexperience, as she seeks to guide the black tenants of Lauren Bacall's estate towards a better life. However, she's frequently reduced to a cypher, as von Trier tends to entrap her within his grand ideological design and dictate her fate through his omniscient narrator (John Hurt), whose urbane observations occasionally undermine the gravity of the action with their understated, but still lacerating, irony.\n\nYet, perhaps out of necessity, von Trier is even more calculating in his depiction of the rebellious Timothy (Isaach de Bankol) and the seemingly meek house servant Wilhelm (Danny Glover), as he has to use their clashing temperaments to suggest that part of African America's failure to participate fully in the fabled Dream lies in its own reluctance to seize its opportunities and accept its obligations.\n\nUnstintingly raw and cynical, this disconcerting State of the Union treatise regularly comes dangerously close to caricature, but parables often have to jettison subtlety to make their case.\n\nAnother tale centred on the redistribution of land opens this week at the National Film Theatre, as part of a month-long tribute to Grigori Kozintsev and Leonid Trauberg. They founded the Factory of the Eccentric Actor (FEKS) that kicked against the communist system in the 1920s, before settling to the tenets of socialist realism in the peerless Maxim trilogy The Youth of Maxim (1934), The Return of Maxim (1937) and The Vyborg Side (1939).\n\nHowever, in his later solo career, Kozintsev sought freedom from state intererence in literature and his adaptation of Cervantes's Don Quixote (1957) and the Shakespeare duo of Hamlet (1964) and King Lear (1970) remain among the finest interpretations of their kind.\n\nWorking from Boris Pasternak's translation, Kozintsev's Lear is a visually arresting study of misplaced trust and filial treachery that's shot through with political folly and human misery. The typically imposing Juri Jarvet plays the abnegating monarch less as a crumbling wreck than an intemperate tyrant, who is supported solely by Oleg Dal's truly touching Fool against Elsa Radzinya and Galina Volchek's vicious termagants, Goneril and Regan. Rarely has the Bard been adapted with such apprehension and power."
