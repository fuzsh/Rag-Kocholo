        "text": "This paper examines how the history of the now Russian once Finnish borderland town of Vyborg is told in Finland. Vyborg was the eastern outpost of the Russian Grand Duchy of Finland from 1812-1917 and then of the Republic of Finland from 1917 until World War Two (WWII). Vyborg was ceded to the Soviet Union in 1940, reoccupied by the Finns in 1941, taken by the Red Army in 1944 and again ceded to the Soviet Union as per the Paris Peace Treaty of 1947. This paper will argue that Vyborg is remembered in Finland as a perfect place, frozen in collective memory as a golden, prospering 1930s city. And that this remembering entails a concurrent forgetting. This paper argues that there is a 'double amnesia' at work in the remembering and forgetting of Vyborg in Finland. It's post WWII history is forgotten as is any negative aspect of pre-WWII life in the Finnish city. Through this wilful double amnesia Vyborg is kept and held in collective memory as a firmly Finnish place. The paper will examine popular media artefacts (including social media) and the stories they tell about Vyborg, and attempts to 'recreate' Finnish Vyborg in the virtual realm, to illuminate the uses and abuses of the collective memory of the city in Finland and how this selective memory is passed on via postmemory (Hirsch, 1999). The paper argues that media narratives adhere to a very narrow, Finland-centric, view of Vyborg conceiving of it as a lost place of the past and ignoring its complex history as a borderland town. The paper contrasts the stories of Vyborg's history told in popular media in Finland with 'silenced' and forgotten aspects of Vyborg's Finnish history. The paper shows, using Paasi's theory of spatial socialization, how closely ideas about the 'correct' eastern border of the Finnish nation-state, are bound up with the memory of Vyborg in Finland. The key question which this paper, and my PhD research, sets out to explore is why do those who lived or (more commonly nowadays) those whose parents lived in Finnish Vyborg \" continue to maintain and [to try] to transmit \" to the next generation \" such strong, positive, nostalgic memories of a city and culture that had long disappeared in reality, if not in the realm of remembrance, image, and recreation. \" 1 A related question is what purposes do these memories of a perfect, lost Finnish place serve in the contexts of Finnish identity and ideas of nation."
