The Vyborg Side is the area due north of the Neva River and St. Petersburg's historic centre. In the 19th century and on into the Soviet Era, the Vyborg Side was one of the city's main industrial centres, with several large factories including the Ericsson / Krasnaya Zarya telephone factory and the Nobel Machine-Building Plant. It has also, since the very early years of the city, been home to a number of military institutions, including what is now the Military Medical Academy, the campuses of which spread over several blocks near Neva River embankment.

The character of the area is thus very much industrial and institutional, although factories and administrative buildings are interspersed with a few historic apartment buildings constructed for the workforce, and even the odd industrialist's mansion. Further north the Vyborg District becomes a mass of modern housing developments, with a few fine Stalinist housing projects (as well as some pretty parks) around Lesnaya and Udelnaya Metro Stations. Apart from the Finland Railway Station and the splendid St. Sampson Cathedral, originally founded in 1709, there is little reason for most visitors to venture over to the Vyborg Side, and even less reason to stay there. If you do need to be in the area, however, there is a handful of reasonable hotels.
