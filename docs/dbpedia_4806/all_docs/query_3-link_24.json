        "text": "The New York Rangers concluded their preseason schedule Saturday with a 3-1 loss to the rival Islanders, but now the real fun begins.\n\nThey'll make final roster cuts by 5 p.m. Monday, setting the table for Tuesday's 7 p.m. regular-season opener at home against the Tampa Bay Lightning.\n\nMore:Preseason takeaways: Could Sammy Blais' injury alter roster plans?\n\nMore:Vitali Kravtsov opens up about his journey back to team\n\nWith the season so close you can taste it, here are my 10 predictions for the 2022-23 Blueshirts:\n\nVitali Kravtsov makes the team, but not the opening night lineup\n\nSaturday’s line combinations provided a clear indication of which way head coach Gerard Gallant is leaning for opening night, with the 22-year-old forward on the outside looking in. The chances of him being waived are essentially zero – the Rangers won’t take that risk with one of their top prospects – but it appears Kravtsov will begin the season as a healthy scratch.\n\nIt’s true that his preseason was underwhelming, as he produced just one secondary assist in four appearances, including 22:25 of ice time with Artemi Panarin. Confidence is an issue as he attempts to put the past behind him and prove he belongs, resulting in a player who looks tentative and unsure of himself. But you wonder if sitting out, rather than being given the leash to play through his growing pains, will further diminish that confidence.\n\nIf he doesn’t make the initial lineup, the Rangers will try to use that time constructively with practice and game observations. At some point, though, they’ll have to throw him into the fire if they’re going to finally make this work.\n\nKaapo Kakko scores 20-plus goals\n\nAs he prepares to enter his fourth season in the NHL, the 21-year-old forward has never seemed so relaxed. He’s gained comfort in his New York surroundings and taken big strides in developing his body, with one person close to the situation noting that his on-and-off-ice testing results are up across the board.\n\nIt’s showed in practice and in preseason games, with his three goals at five-on-five tied for fourth in the NHL. All three came in his last two games, including the most recent on the top line with Chris Kreider and Mika Zibanejad.\n\nHe’s clearly been the best right-winger in camp and has undoubtedly earned that spot. And with a left-handed shot that registers as one of the best on the team, the potential is there to shatter his previous career high of 10 goals in a season. The key will be using it often, which Kreider and Zibanejad will surely be in his ear about.\n\nAlexis Lafrenière ends up at RW\n\nWhile Kakko is settling in at the top of the RW depth chart, it’s a mess beyond that. Kravtsov couldn’t hold down a top-six role, nor could Sammy Blais, and now it’s defaulted to Jimmy Vesey, who was awarded a one-year contract Sunday.\n\nThe 29-year-old veteran has had a nice camp and deserves a roster spot, but he was brought in to kill penalties and provide bottom-six depth. Asking him to play on the second line for an extended period may cause Cinderella to lose her slipper.\n\nMeanwhile, the Rangers continue to dance around the idea of shifting Lafrenière to the right side. Wanting to keep one of their best young players at the position where he’s most comfortable is admirable, but the player himself has repeatedly stated that he’d be fine with moving. Maybe he’s saying otherwise behind closed doors, but we can only take him at his word.\n\nThere’s no question who the four-best wingers on this roster are: Panarin, Kreider, Kakko and Lafrenière. And if the Kid Line isn’t going to stay together, then it’s a matter of time before the No. 1 overall pick from the 2020 draft takes his rightful place in the top six.\n\nFilip Chytil prices himself out of New York\n\nEverything that I’ve seen at camp points to the 23-year-old center picking up where he left off in the playoffs, where he was arguably the Rangers’ No. 1 breakout performer.\n\nThe 6-foot-2, 204-pounder can flat out fly and he’s been carrying the puck with poise and confidence. The skill is there – and he’s still working at, as Chytil is often one of the last players on the ice after practice – and he’s improving both as a forechecker and in the defensive zone. If he can stay healthy, which has been an issue in recent years, then it feels like he’s ready to pop.\n\nWhile that would be great for the Rangers this season, it could put them in a tough spot next summer. They’re projected to have around $18.5 million in salary cap space, but that’s with only 11 players under contract. They’ll need add 10 or 11 more to the roster, with the list of pending free agents headlined by Lafrenière and K’Andre Miller. And after committing a seven-year, $39.375 million deal to Vincent Trocheck to be their second-line center, it will be difficult to give their current 3C a substantial raise.\n\nGustav Rydahl takes over at 4C\n\nIf it weren’t for the roster crunch and desire to protect their depth forwards from the waiver wire, the 28-year-old Swede might still be here.\n\nRydahl is waivers exempt, which made him an obvious choice to send to AHL Hartford. But for most of the preseason, he outplayed likely fourth-line center Ryan Carpenter.\n\nFor a big man – he’s listed at 6-foot-3, 209 pounds – the longtime SHL player skates very well. He’s also an aggressive forechecker who kills penalties and doesn’t shy away from contact, which are all traits that profile well on the fourth line.\n\nHe opened eyes at camp and should be one of the first players recalled in the event of injury. If he gets an opportunity, he might not relinquish it.\n\nK’Andre Miller becomes an all-star\n\nI’ve been banging this drum for weeks and won’t back down now.\n\nThe thing is, I’m far from the only one. Ryan Reaves said his “hot take of the year” is that Miller will become one of the top-15 defensemen in the NHL this season. Kreider called his upside “terrifying.” Multiple scouts, as well as people within the Rangers’ organization, are salivating over the 22-year-old’s combination of rare physical gifts and budding confidence.\n\nMiller has been blossoming before our eyes for the past two seasons, but this year could be the biggest leap yet.\n\nGrowing pains for Artemi Panarin and Vincent Trocheck\n\nFor all the empty-net jokes and GIFs at Ryan Strome’s expense, there’s no question that Panarin is going to miss him. They’re close friends off the ice and spent the past three seasons playing almost exclusively together, combining for 411 points in that span.\n\nNow that Trocheck has replaced Strome as the Rangers’ 2C, it’s reasonable to expect a period of adjustment. There are aspects of Trocheck’s game that should help in the long run – speed, defense and faceoffs, for starters – but camp has shown that it’s going to take time to get on the same page with one of the league’s most unpredictable players. They failed to produce a preseason goal at 5v5 and looked a touch off in stringing passes together.\n\nWill it click eventually? The Rangers are banking on it.\n\nMika Zibanejad hits 90 points\n\nPanarin has been the Rangers’ leading points producer for three seasons in a row, but don’t be surprised if Zibanejad gives him a run for his money in 2022-23.\n\nHe led the team with 24 points (10 goals and 14 assists) in 20 playoff games and seems poised to carry that momentum into the new season. That experience was critical for the 29-year-old, who “learned to trust myself” while going toe-to-toe with some of the best centers in the NHL.\n\nZibanejad set his career high with 81 points last season, highlighting his development as a well-rounded offensive threat. He made notable progress as a facilitator with 52 assists, but his 29 goals fell well short of his high-water mark of 41 from 2019-20. If he can combine his improved passing with his established goal-scoring prowess, watch out.\n\nRangers trade for a forward, but it’s not Patrick Kane\n\nIf there’s one obvious hole on this roster, it’s being short at least one top-nine forward. Consider that the Rangers lost three from their Eastern Conference finalist team in Strome, Andrew Copp and Frank Vatrano, with Trocheck representing the only established replacement.\n\nThe hope is that some combination of Blais, Kravtsov, Vesey and Barclay Goodrow can fill those voids, but we saw the blueprint when Copp, Vatrano, Justin Braun and Tyler Motte were acquired to bolster last season's playoff roster. I fully expect team president Chris Drury to be aggressive at the trade deadline again.\n\nThe hot rumor is that he’ll target Patrick Kane, and while the three-time champion would look great in that RW spot on Panarin’s line, there are major hurdles standing in the way of such a deal. The Rangers have reloaded on draft capital, including the potential for two first-round picks next summer, but their cap situation will be restrictive.\n\nThrough the accrual process, it’s reasonable to expect they can accumulate close to $4 million in cap space by the time we get to the deadline. (That’s if they stick to our 22-man roster projection, rather than the maximum 23.) They could possibly push it to the $5 million range with some shrewd off-day maneuvers, but it won’t be easy.\n\nThat makes acquiring Kane’s $10.5 million average annual value an impossibility. The only chance they have is if they can convince the Chicago Blackhawks to retain 50% of that salary – a big if that would surely require more than just one of those first-round picks. But even then, it’s unclear if they could fit the remaining $5.25 million cap hit.\n\nIt’s much more feasible to go after cheaper options on expiring contracts. Some way-too-early names to monitor could also come from the Chicago roster, namely Andreas Athanasiou and Max Domi, both of whom are in the final year of contracts that carry cap hits of $3 million. Others include Detroit’s Tyler Bertuzzi ($4.75 million), San Jose’s Nick Bonino ($2.05 million) and Seattle’s Joonas Donskoi ($3.9 million), but many possibilities could emerge.\n\nRangers win the Metro\n\nThe depth of the Metro Division is no joke. The four playoff teams from last season – Rangers, Carolina Hurricanes, Pittsburgh Penguins and Washington Capitals – remain formidable, while the Columbus Blue Jackets and New Jersey Devils have added loads of skill and talent. And with last season’s COVID-19 woes behind them, the Islanders loom as a sleeping giant with something to prove.\n\nBut are any of those teams truly elite? With a core of Kreider, Panarin, Zibanejad, Adam Fox and Igor Shesterkin, the Blueshirts may be the closest thing to it.\n\nOf course, an injury to any of those stars – particularly Shesterkin – would change everything. But if they all stay healthy and productive, you could make a case for the Rangers as the favorite.\n\nTheir main competition is probably the Canes, but they exercised past demons by knocking them out in the second round of the playoffs. They also took away one of their top-six forwards in Trocheck, and now Carolina’s biggest offseason addition, Max Pacioretty, is out with a torn Achilles.\n\nIt’ll be a tall order for the Rangers to get further than last season’s Eastern Conference Finals appearance – remember that most champions endure multiple playoff failures before finally reaching the promised land – but I like their chances of winning their first division title since 2014-15."
