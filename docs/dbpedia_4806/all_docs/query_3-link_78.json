        "text": "Effects of biofeedback on obstructive defecation--reconditioning of the defecation reflex?\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nPapachrysostomou, M; Smith, A N\n\n1994-01-01\n\nTwenty two patients with obstructive defecation were recruited for relaxation training by domiciliary self regulatory biofeedback. Each patient served as his or her own control for anorectal and proctographic assessments. Biofeedback training improved the obstructive symptoms of the patients and showed significant change in various parameters related to the obstructive defecation syndrome. As examined by isotope dynamic proctography: the defecation rate (% of evacuation/defecation time) was significantly increased (p anismus index (p < 0.0001). The rectal sensation was improved (p < 0.05), concomitantly. Biofeedback thus improves the defecation act in patients suffering from inappropriate contraction of the pelvic floor and sphincter musculature. Furthermore, this study has shown that biofeedback objectively influences the defecation reflex leading to an improved quality of higher control of bowel function.

We sought to characterize the differences in quality of life in patients with severe obstructive defecation and colonic inertia symptoms. This study was a cross-sectional analysis of a prospective database. Patients were enrolled at a single tertiary referral center. We included consecutive adults with severe symptoms of obstructive defecation (n = 115) or colonic inertia (n = 90) as measured by the Constipation Severity Instrument. The primary outcomes measured were the Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory, Constipation-Related Quality of Life instrument, Pelvic Floor Impact Questionnaire, and 12-item Short Form Health Survey. Although physical examination and anorectal physiology testing were similar between groups, patients with severe obstructive defecation symptoms reported worse pain, distress, and constipation-specific quality of life than patients with severe colonic inertia symptoms (all p < 0.001). Specifically, patients with severe obstructive defecation symptoms showed greater quality-of-life impairment related to eating, bathroom habits, and social functioning (all p â¤ 0.01). Furthermore, patients with severe obstructive defecation symptoms had inferior global quality of life on the 12-item Short Form Health Survey physical component score (p = 0.03) and mental component score (p = 0.06). The use of patient self-report instruments resulted in a proportion of patients with incomplete data. Quality of life was impaired in both groups of patients; however, patients with severe obstructive defecation symptoms were affected to a significantly greater extent. The fact that there were no differences in objective findings on physical examination or anorectal physiology studies highlights the importance of assessing quality of life during the evaluation and treatment of constipated patients.\n\nBiofeedback-guided pelvic floor exercise therapy for obstructive defecation: An effective alternative\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nba-bai-ke-re, Ma-Mu-Ti-Jiang A; Wen, Ni-Re; Hu, Yun-Long; Zhao, Liang; Tuxun, Tuerhongjiang; Husaiyin, Aierhati; Sailai, Yalikun; Abulimiti, Alimujiang; Wang, Yun-Hai; Yang, Peng\n\n2014-01-01\n\nAIM: To compare biofeedback-guided pelvic floor exercise therapy (BFT) with the use of oral polyethylene glycol (PEG) for the treatment of obstructive defecation. METHODS: A total of 88 subjects were assigned to treatment with either BFT (n = 44) or oral PEG (n = 44). Constipation symptoms (including difficult evacuation, hard stool, digitation necessity, incomplete emptying sensation, laxative dependence, perianal pain at defecation, and constipation satisfaction), Wexner Scores, and quality of life scores were assessed after 1, 3, and 6 mo. RESULTS: At the 6 mo follow-up, the symptoms of the BFT group patients showed significantly greater improvements compared with the PEG group regarding difficult evacuation, hard stools, digitation necessity, laxative dependence, perianal pain at defecation, constipation satisfaction, Wexner Constipation Score, and quality of life score (P biofeedback-guided pelvic floor exercise training is superior to oral polyethylene glycol therapy for obstructive defecation.

Her symptoms were controlled by percutaneous endoscopic colostomy with antegrade colonic irrigation. A percutaneous endoscopic colostomy tube was placed in the sigmoid colon endoscopically using a colonoscope and the patient irrigated two liters of water through the percutaneous endoscopic colostomy twice each day and was able to successfully evacuate her rectum without excess straining or discomfort. Percutaneous endoscopic colostomy is an alternative option to colostomy in the management of obstructed defecation.\n\nThe influence of age on posterior pelvic floor dysfunction in women with obstructed defecation syndrome.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nMurad-Regadas, S M; Rodrigues, L V; Furtado, D C; Regadas, F S P; Olivia da S Fernandes, G; Regadas Filho, F S P; Gondim, A C; de Paula Joca da Silva, R\n\n2012-06-01\n\nKnowledge of risk factors is particularly useful to prevent or manage pelvic floor dysfunction but although a number of such factors have been proposed, results remain inconsistent. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of aging on the incidence of posterior pelvic floor disorders in women with obstructed defecation syndrome evaluated using echodefecography. A total of 334 patients with obstructed defecation were evaluated using echodefecography in order to quantify posterior pelvic floor dysfunction (rectocele, intussusception, mucosal prolapse, paradoxical contraction or non-relaxation of the puborectalis muscle, and grade III enterocele/sigmoidocele). Patients were grouped according to the age (Group IÂ =Â patients up to 50Â years of age; Group IIÂ =Â patients over 50Â years of age) to evaluate the isolated and associated incidence of dysfunctions. To evaluate the relationship between dysfunction and age-related changes, patients were also stratified into decades. Group I included 196 patients and Group II included 138. The incidence of significant rectocele, intussusception, rectocele associated with intussusception, rectocele associated with mucosal prolapse and 3 associated disorders was higher in Group II, whereas anismus was more prevalent in Group I. The incidence of significant rectocele, intussusception, mucosal prolapse and grade III enterocele/sigmoidocele was found to increase with age. Conversely, anismus decreased with age. Aging was shown to influence the incidence of posterior pelvic floor disorders (rectocele, intussusception, mucosa prolapse and enterocele/sigmoidocele), but not the incidence of anismus, in women with obstructed defecation syndrome.\n\nMR defecography for obstructed defecation syndrome\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nRavikumar B Thapar\n\n2015-01-01\n\nFull Text Available Patients with obstructed defecation syndrome (ODS form an important subset of patients with chronic constipation. Evaluation and treatment of these patients has traditionally been difficult. Magnetic resonance defecography (MRD is a very useful tool for the evaluation of these patients. We evaluated the scans and records of 192 consecutive patients who underwent MRD at our center between January 2011 and January 2012. Abnormal descent, rectoceles, rectorectal intussusceptions, enteroceles, and spastic perineum were observed in a large number of these patients, usually in various combinations. We discuss the technique, its advantages and limitations, and the normal findings and various pathologies.\n\nManagement of obstructed defecation.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nPodzemny, Vlasta; Pescatori, Lorenzo Carlo; Pescatori, Mario\n\n2015-01-28\n\nThe management of obstructed defecation syndrome (ODS) is mainly conservative and mainly consists of fiber diet, bulking laxatives, rectal irrigation or hydrocolontherapy, biofeedback, transanal electrostimulation, yoga and psychotherapy. According to our experience, nearly 20% of the patients need surgical treatment. If we consider ODS an \"iceberg syndrome\", with \"emerging rocks\", rectocele and rectal internal mucosal prolapse, that may benefit from surgery, at least two out of ten patients also has \"underwater rocks\" or occult disorders, such as anismus, rectal hyposensation and anxiety/depression, which mostly require conservative treatment. Rectal prolapse excision or obliterative suture, rectocele and/or enterocele repair, retrograde Malone's enema and partial myotomy of the puborectalis muscle are effective in selected cases. Laparoscopic ventral sacral colporectopexy may be an effective surgical option. Stapled transanal rectal resection may lead to severe complications. The Transtar procedure seems to be safer, when dealing with recto-rectal intussusception. A multidisciplinary approach to ODS provides the best results.\n\nTransanal repair of rectocele corrects obstructed defecation if it is not associated with anismus.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nTjandra, J J; Ooi, B S; Tang, C L; Dwyer, P; Carey, M\n\n1999-12-01\n\nRectocele is often associated with anorectal symptoms. Various surgical techniques have been described to repair the rectocele. The surgical results are variable. This study evaluated the results of transanal repair of rectocele, with particular emphasis on the impact of concomitant anismus on postoperative functional outcome. Fifty-nine consecutive females who underwent transanal repair of rectocele for obstructed defecation were prospectively reviewed. All 59 patients were parous with a median parity of 2 (range, 1-6) and a median age of 58 (range, 46-68) years. The median length of follow-up was 19 (range, 6-40) months. Anismus was detected by anorectal physiology and defecography. The functional outcome was assessed by a standard questionnaire, physical examination, anorectal manometry, neurophysiology, and defecography. The quality-of-life index was obtained using a visual analog scale (from 1-10, with 10 being the best). The functional outcome of transanal repair of rectocele was superior in patients without anismus. Forty (93 percent) of the 43 patients without anismus showed improved evacuation after repair compared with 6 (38 percent) of the 16 patients with anismus (Panismus was not present (Panismus, effectively corrects obstructed defecation.\n\nMRI anatomy of anteriorly displaced anus: what obstructs defecation?\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nAbouZeid, Amr Abdelhamid; Mohammad, Shaimaa Abdelsattar; Khairy, Khaled Talaat\n\n2014-01-01\n\nAnteriorly displaced anus is an anomaly that is debated with regard to its nomenclature, diagnosis and management. To describe MRI anatomy of the anal canal in children with anteriorly displaced anus and its impact on the process of defecation. We prospectively examined ten children (7 girls, 3 boys; age range 7 months to 8 years, mean 3 years) with anteriorly displaced anus between August 2009 and April 2012. Noncontrast MRI examinations were performed on a 1.5-T magnet. T1- and T2-weighted turbo spin-echo images were acquired in axial, sagittal and coronal planes of the pelvis. The anorectal angle and the relative hiatal distance were measured in mid-sagittal images, and compared with those of a control group using the Mann-Whitney test. In children with anteriorly displaced anus, no anatomical abnormality was depicted at the level of the proximal anal canal. However, the distal anal canal was displaced anteriorly, running out its external muscle cuff, which remained un-displaced at the usual site of the anus. This changes the orientation of the central axis of the anal canal by passing across instead of along the fibers of the longitudinal muscle coat. Children with anteriorly displaced anus had a more obtuse anorectal angle (mean 112.1 ), which was significantly greater than that of the control group (mean 86.2 ). MRI is a valuable tool in studying the anatomy of the anal canal in children with anteriorly displaced anus. The abnormal orientation of the longitudinal muscle across the anal canal can explain the obstructed defecation in these children. Based on this study, it might be of interest to use MRI in studying equivocal cases and children with unexplained constipation.

This was a prospective cohort test accuracy study conducted at one major tertiary referral center on patients with a diagnosis of obstructed defecation syndrome who were referred to the colorectal surgery clinic in a consecutive series from 2009 to 2012. All patients underwent a clinical examination, videodefecography, and MR defecography in the supine position. We analyzed diagnostic accuracy for MR defecography and performed an agreement analysis using Cohen's kappa index (Îº) for each diagnostic imaging examination performed with videodefecography and MR defecography. We included 40 patients with Rome III diagnostic criteria of obstructed defecation syndrome. The degree of agreement between the two tests was as follows: almost perfect for anismus (ÎºÂ =Â 0.88) and rectal prolapse (ÎºÂ =Â 0.83), substantial for enterocele (ÎºÂ =Â 0.80) and rectocele grade III (ÎºÂ =Â 0.65), moderate for intussusception (ÎºÂ =Â 0.50) and rectocele grade II (ÎºÂ =Â 0.49), and slight for rectocele grade I (ÎºÂ =Â 0.30) and excessive perineal descent (ÎºÂ =Â 0.22). Eighteen cystoceles and 11 colpoceles were diagnosed only by MR defecography. Most patients (54%) stated that videodefecography was the more uncomfortable test. MR defecography could become the imaging test of choice for evaluating obstructed defecation syndrome.\n\nProspective multicenter trial comparing echodefecography with defecography in the assessment of anorectal dysfunction in patients with obstructed defecation.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nRegadas, F Sergio P; Haas, Eric M; Abbas, Maher A; Marcio Jorge, J; Habr-Gama, Angelita; Sands, Dana; Wexner, Steven D; Melo-Amaral, Ingrid; SardiÃ±as, Carlos; Lima, Doryane M; Sagae, Univaldo E; Sagae, Evaldo U; Murad-Regadas, Sthela M\n\n2011-06-01\n\nDefecography is the gold standard for assessing functional anorectal disorders but is limited by the need for a specific radiologic environment, exposure of patients to radiation, and inability to show all anatomic structures involved in defecation. Echodefecography is a 3-dimensional dynamic ultrasound technique developed to overcome these limitations. This study was designed to validate the effectiveness of echodefecography compared with defecography in the assessment of anorectal dysfunctions related to obstructed defecation. Multicenter, prospective observational study. Women with symptoms of obstructed defecation. Six centers for colorectal surgery (3 in Brazil, 1 in Texas, 1 in Florida, and 1 in Venezuela). Defecography was performed after inserting 150 mL of barium paste in the rectum. Echodefecography was performed with a 2050 endoprobe through 3 automatic scans. The Îº statistic was used to assess agreement between echodefecography and defecography in the evaluation of rectocele, intussusception, anismus, and grade III enterocele. Eighty-six women were evaluated: median Wexner constipation score, 13.4 (range, 6-23); median age, 53.4 (range, 26-77) years. Rectocele was identified with substantial agreement between the 2 methods (defecography, 80 patients; echodefecography, 76 patients; Îº = 0.61; 95% CI = 0.48-0.73). The 2 techniques demonstrated identical findings in 6 patients without rectocele, and in 9 patients with grade I, 29 with grade II, and 19 patients with grade III rectoceles. Defecography identified rectal intussusception in 42 patients, with echodefecography identifying 37 of these cases, plus 4 additional cases, yielding substantial agreement (Îº = 0.79; 95% CI = 0.57-1.0). Intussusception was associated with rectocele in 28 patients for both methods (Îº = 0.62; 95% CI = 0.41-0.83). There was substantial agreement for anismus (Îº = 0.61; 95% CI = 0.40-0.81) and for rectocele combined with anismus (Îº = 0.61; 95% CI = 0.40-0.82).

From June 2005 to June 2007, we submitted 20 patients with ODS due to rectal prolapse and/or rectocele, combined with stable enterocele, to STARR and laparoscopic correction of the enterocele. Preoperative assessment included symptom evaluation with standardized questionnaires, clinical examination, colonoscopy, proctoscopy, anal sphincter ultrasonography, video-defecography with synchronous opacification of the ileal loops in all patients and colpography in female patients, and anorectal manometry. Follow-up was performed in the first, third, sixth, 12th, and 24th month after surgery. Eighteen (90%) patients were submitted to both procedures, simultaneously. One patient, previously submitted to STARR, underwent laparoscopic treatment of the enterocele. Postoperative complications occurred in two (10%) patients: one case of postoperative rectal bleeding and one case of retropneumoperitoneum. Median (range) preoperative and postoperative Altomare's obstructed defecation score was ten (6-14) and two (0-14), respectively (p<0.001). Median (range) preoperative and postoperative quality of life score was 79 (39-109) and 109 (50-126), respectively (p<0.001). No symptom related to ODS was detected at 6-month follow-up (19 patients) and at 24-month follow-up (19 patients). The combination of STARR and laparoscopy provides a safe and effective method to treat ODS caused by rectal internal prolapse and/or rectocele combined with enterocele.\n\nUltrasound in the investigation of posterior compartment vaginal prolapse and obstructed defecation.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nDietz, H P; Beer-Gabel, M\n\n2012-07-01\n\nRecent developments in diagnostic imaging have made gynecologists, colorectal surgeons and gastroenterologists realize as never before that they share a common interest in anorectal and pelvic floor dysfunction. While we often may be using different words to describe the same phenomenon (e.g. anismus/vaginismus) or attributing different meanings to the same words (e.g. rectocele), we look after patients with problems that transcend the borders of our respective specialties. Like no other diagnostic modality, imaging helps us understand each other and provides new insights into conditions we all need to learn to investigate better in order to improve clinical management. In this review we attempt to show what modern ultrasound imaging can contribute to the diagnostic work-up of patients with posterior vaginal wall prolapse, obstructed defecation and rectal intussusception/prolapse. In summary, it is evident that translabial/perineal ultrasound can serve as a first-line diagnostic tool in women with such complaints, replacing defecation proctography and MR proctography in a large proportion of female patients. This is advantageous for the women themselves because ultrasound is much better tolerated, as well as for healthcare systems since sonographic imaging is much less expensive. However, there is a substantial need for education, which currently remains unmet. Copyright Â© 2012 ISUOG.

A high degree of agreement has been demonstrated between echodefecography (dynamic 3-dimensional anorectal ultrasonography) and conventional defecography. Our aim was to evaluate the ability of a combined approach consisting of dynamic 3-dimensional transvaginal and transrectal ultrasonography by using a 3-dimensional biplane endoprobe to assess posterior pelvic floor dysfunctions related to obstructed defecation syndrome in comparison with echodefecography. This was a prospective, observational cohort study conducted at a tertiary-care hospital. Consecutive female patients with symptoms of obstructed defecation were eligible. Each patient underwent assessment of posterior pelvic floor dysfunctions with a combination of dynamic 3-dimensional transvaginal and transrectal ultrasonography by using a biplane transducer and with echodefecography. Kappa (Îº) was calculated as an index of agreement between the techniques. Diagnostic accuracy (sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values) of the combined technique in detection of posterior dysfunctions was assessed with echodefecography as the standard for comparison. A total of 33 women were evaluated. Substantial agreement was observed regarding normal relaxation and anismus. In detecting the absence or presence of rectocele, the 2 methods agreed in all cases. Near-perfect agreement was found for rectocele grade I, grade II, and grade III. Perfect agreement was found for entero/sigmoidocele, with near-perfect agreement for rectal intussusception. Using echodefecography as the standard for comparison, we found high diagnostic accuracy of transvaginal and transrectal ultrasonography in the detection of posterior dysfunctions. This combined technique should be compared with other dynamic techniques and\n\nRadiographic findings of post-operative double stapled trans anal rectal resection (STARR) in patient with obstructed defecation syndrome (ODS).\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nGrassi, Roberto; Romano, Stefania; Micera, Osvaldo; Fioroni, Claudio; Boller, Brigitta\n\n2005-03-01\n\nLongo's procedure of double stapled trans anal rectal resection (STARR) has been evocated as surgical treatment of the obstructed defecation syndrome (ODS) in patients with rectal mucosal prolapse.

The aim of this study was to relate patterns of colonic transit to results of ano-rectal manometry. Sixteen patients (4 males, 12 females, age 20-58 years) were studied. All underwent ano-rectal manometric studies and colonic transit studies. The transit studies were performed following the oral ingestion of 4 MBq 67 Gacitrate with images performed at 6, 24, 48 and 72 h. Computed data on half clearance times (T 1/2 ), mean activity positions (MAP) and segmental tracer retention were obtained. Five patients had normal ano-rectal manometry, 7 decreased rectal sensation and 4 absent or paradoxical ano-rectal reflex (anismus). The T 1/2 for subjects with normal manometry was 78.5 Â± 11.9 h, decreased rectal sensation 73 Â± 4.9 h and the anismus group 52 Â± 12.1 h (P < 0.05). Total retention at 72 h was less at 56 Â± 3.73 h in the anismus group compared to normal manometry (74.7 Â± 12.2) and decreased rectal sensation (90.7 Â± 12.1), with higher MAP and less tracer in the right colon at 48 h in the anismus group (P < 0.05). The results indicate that colonic transit studies in constipated patients with anismus have different patterns to those with normal anorectal manometry or decreased rectal sensation\n\nUse of Biofeedback Combined With Diet for Treatment of Obstructed Defecation Associated With Paradoxical Puborectalis Contraction (Anismus): Predictive Factors and Short-term Outcome.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nMurad-Regadas, Sthela M; Regadas, Francisco S Pinheiro; Bezerra, Carla C Rocha; de Oliveira, Maura T Coutinho Cajazeiras; Regadas Filho, Francisco S Pinheiro; Rodrigues, Lusmar Veras; Almeida, Saulo Santiago; da Silva Fernandes, Graziela O\n\n2016-02-01\n\nNumerous studies have described the use of biofeedback therapy for the treatment of anismus. Success rates vary widely, but few data are available regarding factors predictive of success. Our aim was to evaluate short-term results of biofeedback associated with diet in patients with obstructed defecation because of anismus and to investigate factors that may affect the results. Patients were identified from a single-institution prospectively maintained database. This study was conducted in a tertiary hospital. Consecutive patients who had obstructed defecation associated with anismus and were treated with biofeedback associated with diet were eligible. Each patient underwent anal manometry and/or dynamic anal ultrasound. Patients with anismus and were treated with biofeedback associated with diet. Patients classed as having a satisfactory response to therapy and those classed as having an unsatisfactory response were compared with regard to sex, age, Cleveland Clinic Florida constipation score, functional factors (anal resting and squeeze pressures and reversal of paradoxical puborectalis contraction on manometry), and anatomic factors in women (history of vaginal delivery, number of vaginal deliveries, menopause, hysterectomy, and previous anorectal surgery). A total of 116 patients were included (75 women and 41 men). Overall, 59% were classed as having a satisfactory response (decrease in constipation score, >50%). Patients with satisfactory responses to biofeedback plus diet did not differ from those with unsatisfactory responses with regard to clinical, anatomic, and physiological factors. This was not a randomized controlled trial. Biofeedback combined with diet is a valuable treatment option for patients with obstructed defecation syndrome associated with anismus, and more than half of our patients of both sexes achieved a satisfactory response. Improvement was not related to reversal of paradoxical contraction of puborectalis muscles at manometry. Patient\n\nRole of enterocele in the obstructed defecation syndrome (ODS): a new radiological point of view.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nMorandi, C; Martellucci, J; Talento, P; Carriero, A\n\n2010-08-01\n\nThe aim of this study was to understand the role of enterocele in the pathogenesis of the obstructed defecation syndrome (ODS) a new defecographic classification based on function. A total of 597 patients (551 women, 46 men) who underwent cinedefecography between November 2001 and November 2005 were studied. A total of 567 (95%) underwent cinedefecography as they had symptoms of ODS. Enterocele was classified into three types. Enterocele was found in 127 (23%) female and one (2.2%) male patients. Thirty-eight (6.9%) patients had type A, 38(6.9%) type B, and 27(4.9%) type C enterocele. A total of 24 patients (4.35%) had sigmoidocele. In patients with type C enterocele, the finding of a radiological pattern of ODS was higher (26/27) than that in the other groups (A + B + Sigmoidocele) (23/100) (P ODS and usually presents as an isolated condition. Type B is less frequently associated with ODS and is more frequently accompanied by other pathological conditions.\n\nStapled trans-anal rectal resection (STARR) in the surgical treatment of the obstructed defecation syndrome: results of STARR Italian Registry.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nStuto, Angelo; Renzi, Adolfo; Carriero, Alfonso; Gabrielli, Francesco; Gianfreda, Valeria; Villani, Roberto Dino; Pietrantoni, Carmine; Seria, Giovanni; Capomagi, Antonio; Talento, Pasquale\n\n2011-09-01\n\nThis study was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of stapled trans-anal rectal resection (STARR) in the treatment of obstructed defecation syndrome ODS by the analysis of the data collected in the STARR Italian Registry (SIR) with a special emphasis on the analysis of symptoms and quality of life. Collected data included, preoperative tests findings, and the evaluation of symptoms; the latter was obtained by using dedicated tools such as the Obstructed Defecation Syndrome Score (ODS-S), the Severity Symptom Score (SSS), and the Continence Grading Scale (CGS). Data on the quality of life were collected by Patient Assessment of Constipation Quality of Life (PAC-QoL) and the Euro Quality of Life-5 Domains Visual Analogue Scale (EQ-5D VAS). The evaluation of the symptoms and the quality of life was repeated 6 and 12 months after surgery. The SIR had collected data on 2171 patients (1653 females, 76.1%; mean age 56.2 years; range 20-96 years). A significant improvement (P < .0001) was seen between preoperative and 12-month follow-up in all scores: ODS-S (16.7 vs. 5.0), SSS (15.6 vs. 2.6), CGS (2.0 vs. 0.7), PAC-QoL (51.0 vs. 22.1), and EQ-5D VAS (57.5 vs. 85.7). Complications included defecatory urgency (4.5% at 12 months), bleeding (3.6%), perineal sepsis (3.4%), and one case of rectovaginal fistula (0.05%). The analysis of SIR data seems to confirm that STARR is a safe and effective procedure in the treatment of ODS. However, further studies are required to evaluate the long-term stability of results.\n\nPelvic floor function following ventral rectopexy versus STARR in the treatment of obstructed defecation.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nAltomare, D F; Picciariello, A; Memeo, R; Fanelli, M; Digennaro, R; Chetta, N; De Fazio, M\n\n2018-04-01\n\nObstructed defecation syndrome (ODS), most commonly found in females, can be treated by a transanal or abdominal approach with good success rate. Nevertheless, patients may experience de novo or persisting pelvic floor dysfunctions after surgery. The aim of this study was to compare the functional outcome of stapled transanal rectal resection (STARR) and ventral rectopexy (VRP) in a series of ODS patients. Forty-nine female patients who had surgery for ODS between 2006 and 2016 were retrospectively evaluated: 28 (median age 60Â years, IQR 54-69Â years) had VRP and 21 (median age 58Â years, IQR 51-66Â years) had STARR. ODS was scored with the ODS score while the overall pelvic floor function was assessed with the three axial perineal evaluation (TAPE) score. Quality-of-life was evaluated by the patient assessment of constipation quality-of-life (PAC-Qol) questionnaire administered preoperatively and after 1Â year of follow-up. The preoperative median ODS score and TAPE score were comparable in both groups. After a median follow-up of 12Â months (range 12-18Â months), the median ODS score was 12 (range 10-20) in the STARR group and 9 (range 3-15) in the VRP one (pâ=â0.02), while the median TAPE score was 70.5 (IQR 60.6-77.3) in the former and 76.8 (IQR 70.2-89.7) in the latter (pâ=â0.01). Postoperatively the physical domain of the PAC-QoL score had a median value of 2.74 (IQR 1.7-3.75) in the STARR group compared to 1.5 (IQR 1-2.5) in the VRP group (pâ=â0.03). No major complications were recorded in either group. VRP and STARR can improve defecation in patients with ODS with minimal complications, but the overall pelvic wellness evaluated by the TAPE score improves significantly only after VRP, suggesting a better performance of VRP than STARR when overall pelvic floor function is concerned.\n\nThe clinical value of magnetic resonance defecography in males with obstructed defecation syndrome.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nPiloni, V; Bergamasco, M; Melara, G; Garavello, P\n\n2018-03-01\n\nThe aim of the present study was to assess the relationship between symptoms of obstructed defecation and findings on magnetic resonance (MR) defecography in males with obstructed defecation syndrome (ODS). Thirty-six males with ODS who underwent MR defecography at our institution between March 2013 and February 2016 were asked in a telephone interview about their symptoms and subsequent treatment, either medical or surgical. Patients were divided into 2 groups, one with anismus (Group 1) and one with prolapse without anismus (Group 2). The interaction between ODS type and symptoms with MR findings was assessed by multivariate analysis for categorical data using a hierarchical log-linear model. MR imaging findings included lateral and/or posterior rectocele, rectal prolapse, intussusception, ballooning of levator hiatus with impingement of pelvic organs and dyskinetic puborectalis muscle. There were 21 males with ODS due to anismus (Group 1) and 15 with ODS due to rectal prolapse/intussusception (Group 2). Mean age of the entire group was 53.6Â Â±Â 4.1Â years (range 18-77Â years). Patients in Group 1 were slightly older than those in Group 2 (age peak, sixth decade in 47.6 vs 20.0%, pÂ <Â 0.05). Symptoms most frequently associated with Group 1 patients included small volume and hard feces (85.0%, pÂ <Â 0.01), excessive strain at stool (81.0%, pÂ <Â 0.05), tenesmus and fecaloma formation (57.1 and 42.9%, pÂ <Â 0.05); symptoms most frequently associated with Group 2 patients included mucous discharge, rectal bleeding and pain (86.7%, pÂ <Â 0.05), prolonged toilet time (73.3%, pÂ <Â 0.05), fragmented evacuation with or without digitation (66.7%, pÂ <Â 0.005). Voiding outflow obstruction was more frequent in Group 1 (19.0 vs 13.3%; pÂ <Â 0.05), while non-bacterial prostatitis and sexual dysfunction prevailed in Group 2 (26.7 and 46.7%, pÂ <Â 0.05). At MR defecography, two major categories of findings were detected: a dyskinetic pattern (Type 1), seen in all Group 1\n\nA prospective evaluation of occult disorders in obstructed defecation using the 'iceberg diagram'.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nPescatori, M; Spyrou, M; Pulvirenti d'Urso, A\n\n2007-06-01\n\nSurgical treatment of constipation and obstructed defecation (OD) carries frequent recurrences, as OD is an 'iceberg syndrome' characterized by 'underwater rocks' or occult diseases which may affect the outcome of surgery. The aim of this study was to evaluate occult disorders, in order to alert the clinician of these and minimize failures. One hundred consecutive constipated patients with OD symptoms, 81 women, median age 52 years, underwent perineal examination, proctoscopy, anorectal manometry and anal/vaginal ultrasound (US). Anorectal physiology and imaging tests were also carried out when indicated, as well as psychological and urogynaecological consultations. Symptoms were graded using a modified 1-20 constipation score. Both evident (e.g. rectocele) and occult (e.g. anismus) diseases were prospectively evaluated using a novel 'iceberg diagram'. The type of treatment, whether conservative or surgical, was also recorded. Fifty-four (54%) patients had both mucosal prolapse and rectocele. All patients had at least two occult OD-related diseases, 66 patients had at least three of them: anxiety-depression, anismus and rectal hyposensation were the most frequent (66%, 44% and 33%, respectively). The median constipation score was 11 (range 2-20), the median number of 'occult disorders' was 5 (range 2-8). Conservative treatment was carried out in most cases. Surgery was carried out in 14 (14%) patients. The novel 'iceberg diagram' allowed the adequate evaluation of OD-related occult diseases and better selection of patients for treatment. Most were managed conservatively, and only a minority were treated by surgery.\n\nA pilot study on disturbed gastric myoelectric activity in obstructed defecation syndrome.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nFarid, Mohamed; Emile, Sameh Hany; Haleem, Magdy; El-Hak, Nabil Gad\n\n2018-07-01\n\nElectrogastrography (EGG) is a noninvasive technique for recording gastric myoelectric activity. The aim of this study was to measure and record gastric myoelectric activity in patients with obstructed defecation syndrome (ODS) and to compare their results with those of normal individuals. Forty-two patients (22 male) with ODS and a mean age of 41.02Â y were enrolled in this prospective study after thorough clinical and physiologic assessment. Eleven normal subjects (six female) with a mean age of 39.2Â Â±Â 8.4Â y were assigned to the control group. Both patients and controls were subjected to surface EGG in fasting and postprandial states. Data were recorded and analyzed via a computer system to reveal the EGG pattern in both groups. Abnormalities in the EGG were found in 24 (57.1%) of the 42 patients with ODS. EGG in ODS patients showed alterations in the fasting state in the form of a significant decrease of the normal gastric slow wave (PÂ =Â 0.03) and a nonsignificant increase in gastric dysrhythmias. The EGG alterations of ODS patients were significantly improved in the postprandial state as the normal gastric slow waves significantly (PÂ =Â 0.006) increased and the gastric bradycardia declined significantly (PÂ =Â 0.02). No significant differences were observed in the power distribution between the ODS patients and the healthy controls. Patients with ODS showed an altered EGG pattern compared with that of healthy control subjects. The alterations in ODS patients were more clearly observed during the fasting state and improved significantly after eating. Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Inc.

The medical records and imaging series of 105 consecutive patients (90 female, 15 male, aged 21-78 years, mean age 46.1 Â± 5.1 years) referred to our center between April 2011 and January 2012 for symptoms of ODS were retrospectively examined. After history taking and a complete clinical examination, patients underwent MR imaging according to a standard protocol using a 0.35 T permanent field, horizontally oriented open-configuration magnet. Static and dynamic MR-defecography was performed using recognized parameters and well-established diagnostic criteria. Sixty-seven out of 105 (64 %) patients found the prone position more comfortable for the evacuation of rectal contrast while 10/105 (9.5 %) were unable to empty their rectum despite repeated attempts. Increased hiatus size, anterior rectocele and focal or extensive defects of the levator ani muscle were the most frequent abnormalities (67.6, 60.0 and 51.4 %, respectively). An MR-based classification was developed based on the combinations of abnormalities found: Grade 1 = functional abnormality, including paradoxical contraction of the puborectalis muscle, without anatomical defect affecting the musculo-fascial structures; Grade 2 = functional defect associated with a minor anatomical defect such as rectocele â¤ 2 cm in size and/or first-degree intussusception; Grade 3 = severe defects confined to the posterior anatomical compartment, including >2 cm rectocele, second- or higher-degree intussusception, full-thickness external rectal prolapse, poor mesorectal posterior fixation, rectal descent >5 cm, levator ani muscle rupture, ballooning of the levator hiatus and focal detachment of the endopelvic fascia; Grade 4 = combined defects of two or three pelvic floor compartments, including cystocele, hysterocele, enlarged urogenital\n\nRENZI SCORE FOR OBSTRUCTED DEFECATION SYNDROME - VALIDATION OF THE PORTUGUESE VERSION ACCORDING TO THE COSMIN CHECKLIST.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nCaetano, Ana Celia; Dias, Sara; Santa-Cruz, AndrÃ©; Rolanda, Carla\n\n2018-01-01\n\nRecently, the Obstructed Defecation Syndrome score (ODS score) was developed and validated by Renzi to assess clinical staging and to allow evaluation and comparison of the efficacy of treatment of this disorder. Our goal is to validate the Portuguese version of Renzi ODS score, according to the Consensus based Standards for the selection of the Health Measurement Instruments (COSMIN) checklist. Following guidelines for cross-cultural validity, Renzi ODS score was translated into the Portuguese language. Then, a group of patients and healthy controls were invited to fill in the Renzi ODS score at baseline, after 2 weeks and 3 months, respectively. We assessed internal consistency, reliability and measurement error, content and construct validity, responsiveness and interpretability. A total of 113 individuals (77 patients; 36 healthy controls) completed the questionnaire. Seventy and 30 patients repeated the Renzi ODS score after 2 weeks and 3 months respectively. Factor analysis confirmed the unidimensionality of the scale. Cronbach's Î± coefficient of 0.77 supported item's homogeneity. Weighted quadratic kappa of 0.89 established test-retest reliability. The smallest detectable change at the individual level was 2.66 and at the group level was 0.30. Renzi ODS score and the total (-0.32) and physical (-0.43) SF-36 scores correlated negatively. Patient and control's groups significantly differed (11 points). The change score of Renzi ODS score between baseline and 3 months correlated negatively with the clinical evolution (-0.86). ROC analysis showed minimal important change of 2.00 with AUC 0.97. Neither floor nor ceiling effects were observed. This work validated the Portuguese version of Renzi ODS score. We can now use this reliable, responsive, and interpretable (at the group level) tool to evaluate Portuguese ODS patients.\n\nBowel habits and behaviors related to defecation in 10- to 16-year-olds: impact of socioeconomic characteristics and emotional stress.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nDevanarayana, Niranga Manjuri; Rajindrajith, Shaman\n\n2011-05-01\n\nBowel habits vary depending on food consumption and genetic factors. The knowledge regarding this physiological phenomenon is limited. Thorough understanding of normal bowel habits is essential for correct diagnosis of defecation disorders. This study evaluated the normal bowel habits of Sri Lankan children. Children ages 10 to 16 years were randomly selected from 5 schools in 4 districts. Those without defecation disorders were recruited. Details regarding their bowel habits during previous 2 months were collected using a validated, self-administered questionnaire. A total of 2273 children were enrolled (mean age 13.2 years, SD 1.7 years, boys 49.7%). Of them, 1748 (76.9%) opened bowels once daily, whereas 149 (6.6%) and 11 (0.5%) had 3/day defecations, respectively. Stool consistency was normal in 1997 (87.9%), hard in 86 (3.8%), and changing consistency in 163 (7.1%). Straining was present in 639 (28.1%), painful defecation in 241 (10.6%), and bleeding in 49 (2.2%). One hundred six (4.7%) children reported stool withholding. Bulky stool was present in 158 (7.0%). Straining, bulky stools, and withholding posture were more common in boys, whereas painful defecation and bleeding were reported more often in girls (Pwar-affected areas (P < 0.05). Bowel frequency < 3/week, bulky stools, painful defecation, straining, and withholding posture were more common in those exposed to stressful life events (P < 0.05). The present study provides data on normal bowel habits of Sri Lankan schoolchildren and provides a firm platform to evaluate defecation disorders in them.\n\nEffect of eliminating open defecation on diarrhoeal morbidity: an ecological study of Nyando and Nambale sub-counties, Kenya\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nJohn Njuguna\n\n2016-08-01\n\nFull Text Available Abstract Background Defecating in the open predisposes people to soil transmitted helminthes and diarrhoeal diseases. An estimated 5.6 million Kenyans defecate in the open. Kenya launched a program to eradicate open defecation by 2013 in the rural areas. By end of 2013, only two sub-counties had eliminated open defecation. These are Nambale and Nyando. The study looked at the impact of eradicating open defecation on diarrhea prevalence among children in these two sub-counties. Methods Data on diarrhoea morbidity among children under 5Â years was extracted from the Kenya Health Information System for all the sub-counties in Busia and Kisumu counties for 2012, 2013 and 2014 respectively. Prevalence was calculated for each sub-county in Kisumu for comparison with Nyandoâs. Prevalence was also calculated for each sub-county in Busia County and compared to that of Nambale sub-county. A MannâWhitney U Test was done to test the null hypothesis that diarrhoea prevalence was similar in both open defecation and open defecation free sub-counties. Results A MannâWhitney U Test revealed significant difference in diarrhoeal prevalence of open defecation sub-counties (Mdâ=â18.4, nâ=â34 and open defecation free sub-counties (Mdâ=â9.8, nâ=â5, Uâ=â9, zâ=ââ3.2, pâ=â.001. Among the two Counties, Nambale had the lowest prevalence. It recorded a decline from 9.8 to 5.7Â % across the three years. Prevalence for diarrhoea cases in Nyando declined from 19.1 to 15.2Â % across the three years. Nyando initially had the second highest prevalence in Kisumu County and by 2014 it had the lowest prevalence. Conclusions The two sub-counties with open defecation free status had lower prevalence of diarrhoea cases compared to sub-counties which were yet to attain open defecation free status. This suggests that elimination of open defecation may reduce the number of diarrhoea cases.\n\nConstipation and Defecation Problems\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\n... emptied their bowels.

Three hundred seventy female patients with ODS were reviewed retrospectively and were divided in Group I-105 nulliparous, Group II-165 had at least one vaginal delivery, and Group III-comprised of 100 patients delivered only by cesarean section. All patients had been submitted to ECD to identify pelvic floor dysfunctions. No statistical significance was found between the groups with regard to anorectocele grade. Intussusception was identified in 40% from G I, 55.0% from G II, and 30.0% from G III, with statistical significance between Groups I and II. Intussusception was associated with significant anorectocele in 24.8%, 36.3%, and 18% patients from G I, II, and III, respectively. Anismus was identified in 39.0% from G I, 28.5% from G II, and 60% from G III, with statistical significance between Groups I and III. Anismus was associated with significant anorectocele in 22.8%, 15.7%, and 24% patients from G I, II, and III, respectively. Sigmoidocele/enterocele was identified in 7.6% from G I, 10.9% G II, and was associated with significant rectocele in 3.8% and 7.3% patients from G I and II, respectively. The distribution of pelvic floor dysfunctions showed no specific pattern across the groups, suggesting the absence of a correlation between these dysfunctions and vaginal delivery.\n\nAnorectal manometry with and without ketamine for evaluation of defecation disorders in children.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nKeshtgar, A S; Choudhry, M S; Kufeji, D; Ward, H C; Clayden, G S\n\n2015-03-01\n\nAnorectal manometry (ARCM) provides valuable information in children with chronic constipation and fecal incontinence but may not be tolerated in the awake child. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of ketamine anesthesia on the assessment of anorectal function by manometry and to evaluate defecation dynamics and anal sphincter resting pressure in the context of pathophysiology of chronic functional (idiopathic) constipation and soiling in children. This was a prospective study of children who were investigated for symptoms of chronic constipation and soiling between April 2001 and April 2004. We studied 52 consecutive children who had awake ARCM, biofeedback training and endosonography (awake group) and 64 children who had ketamine anesthesia for ARCM and endosonography (ketamine group). We age matched 31 children who had awake anorectal studies with 27 who had ketamine anesthesia. The children in awake and ketamine groups were comparable for age, duration of bowel symptoms and duration of laxative treatments. ARCM profile was comparable between the awake and the ketamine groups with regard to anal sphincter resting pressure, rectal capacity, amplitude of rectal contractions, frequency of rectal and IAS contractions and functional length of anal canal. Of 52 children who had awake ARCM, dyssynergia of the EAS muscles was observed in 22 (42%) and median squeeze pressure was 87mm Hg (range 25-134). The anal sphincter resting pressure was non-obstructive and comparable to healthy normal children. Rectoanal inhibitory reflex was seen in all children excluding diagnosis of Hirschsprung disease. Ketamine anesthesia does not affect quantitative or qualitative measurements of autonomic anorectal function and can be used reliably in children who will not tolerate the manometry while awake. Paradoxical contraction of the EAS can only be evaluated in the awake children and should be investigated further as the underlying cause of obstructive defecation in patients with\n\nOutlet obstruction constipation (anismus) managed by biofeedback.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nKawimbe, B M; Papachrysostomou, M; Binnie, N R; Clare, N; Smith, A N\n\n1991-10-01\n\nFifteen subjects presenting with intractable constipation due to obstructive defecation, mean (SEM) duration 8.8 (1.8) years, had the inappropriate contraction and electromyographic changes in the pelvic floor muscles and external and sphincter typical of this condition. An electromyographically derived index was used to grade its severity. A self applied biofeedback device was used to allow electromyographic recording of the abnormal external anal sphincter. The subjects were encouraged to reduce the abnormal electromyographic activity on straining after instruction and training. The procedure was intended as a relearning process in which the non-relaxing activity of the pelvic floor was gradually suppressed. Biofeedback training was maintained on a domiciliary basis for a mean time of 3.1 weeks and resulted in a significant reduction in the anismus index (mean (SEM) 69.9 (7.8)% before biofeedback, mean 14 (3.9)% after biofeedback, p less than 0.01). There was an associated reduction in the time spent straining at stool and in the difficulty of defecation and an increased frequency of defecation. Defecatory video proctograms in six subjects showed improvements in the anorectal angle during straining and evacuation. The clinical benefit to the patients persisted after a mean follow up of 6.2 months.\n\nStressful Life Events in Children With Functional Defecation Disorders.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nPhilips, Elise M; Peeters, Babette; Teeuw, Arianne H; Leenders, Arnold G E; Boluyt, Nicole; Brilleslijper-Kater, Sonja N; Benninga, Marc A\n\n2015-10-01\n\nThe aim of the study was to determine the prevalence of stressful life events including (sexual) abuse in children with functional defecation disorders by performing a systematic review. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PsycINFO for cohort, case-control and cross-sectional studies investigating the prevalence of stressful life events, including (sexual) abuse in children with functional defecation disorders. The search yielded 946 articles, of which 8 were included with data from 654 children with functional constipation and 1931 children with (constipation-associated) fecal incontinence (FI). Overall, children with functional defecation disorders had been significantly more exposed to stressful life events than healthy children, with prevalence rates ranging from 1.6% to 90.9%. Being bullied, being a relational victim, interruption of toilet training, punishment by parents during toilet training, and hospitalization were significantly related to FI, whereas separation from the best friend, failure in an examination, severe illness in a close family member, loss of job by a parent, frequent punishment, and living in a war-affected area were significantly related to constipation. Only 1 study measured the prevalence of child abuse, which reported a significantly higher prevalence of child (sexual) abuse in children with FI compared with controls. The prevalence of stressful life events, including (sexual) abuse is significantly higher in children with functional defecation disorders compared with healthy children. To gain more insight into the true prevalence of child (sexual) abuse in children with functional defecation disorders, more studies are clearly needed.\n\nScintigraphic study on disordered defecation after low anterior resection\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nYoshikawa, Shusaku; Fujii, Hisao; Nakano, Hiroshige\n\n1997-01-01\n\nThis study was designed to clarify the mechanism of disordered defecation after low anterior resection (LAR). Twenty four patients were divided into two groups, the poor motility group (Group I), including 12 subjects who defecated over four times per day, and the good motility group (Group II), including 12 subjects who defecated under three times per day. At first, a polyethylene-tube was inserted into the cecum using a colonoscope and a guide wire. 37 MBq 99m TcDTPA in 50 ml of tepid saline containing 5 mg of bisacodyl was infused into the cecum through the tube. Transit time and expulsion ratio from the rectum (ERr) were studied. The average times of propelling RI-solution from the transverse colon to the descending colon, from the descending colon to the rectum, and from the rectum to defecation were 37.5 seconds and 163.7 seconds, 48.7 and 293.5, 47.7 and 215.5, respectively in Group I and Group II. ERr was 84.3% in Group I and 94.5% in Group II. There are significant differences between these two groups. Colonic transit time in Group I was shorter than that in Group II, and ERr in Group I was less than that in Group II. These results suggest that the disordered defecation after LAR may be partly caused by poor colonic motility and dysfunction of the neorectum. (author)\n\nTreating Pelvic Floor Disorders of Defecation: Management or Cure?\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nRao, Satish S.C.; Go, Jorge T.\n\n2013-01-01\n\nPelvic floor disorders that affect defecation consist of structural disorders such as rectocele and functional disorders such as dyssynergic defecation. Evaluation includes a good history and physical examination, a careful digital rectal exam, as well as physiological tests such as anorectal manometry, colonic transit study and balloon expulsion test. Defecography and dynamic magnetic resonance imaging may facilitate detection of structural defects. Their management consists of education and counseling regarding bowel function, diet, laxatives and behavioral therapies. Recently, several randomized clinical trials have shown that biofeedback therapy is effective in dyssynergic defecation. Dyssynergia may also co-exist in structural disorders such as solitary rectal ulcer syndrome or rectocele. Hence, before proceeding with surgery, neuromuscular training or biofeedback should be considered. Several surgical approaches including stapled transanal rectal resection (STARR) have been advocated, but there is lack of well controlled randomized studies and their efficacy is unproven.

This practice facilitates the transmission of diarrheal diseases - one of the leading causes of mortality in children under 5 in sub-Saharan Africa. The main purpose of this study is to: estimate changes in open defecation prevalence between 2005 and 2010 across countries in sub-Saharan Africa; examine the association between national level indices and changes in open defecation prevalence; and assess how many countries can achieve 'open defecation free status' by 2015. After applying selection criteria, this study analyzed country-level data for 34 sub-Saharan African countries. Seven country-level indices were collected: 1) presence of a national sanitation policy; 2) budget line for sanitation; 3) budget allocated to sanitation; 4) annual per capita GDP; 5) GDP growth; 6) implementation of total sanitation approaches; and 7) per capita aid disbursement for water supply and sanitation. The relationships between these country-level indices and the change in open defecation from 2005 to 2010 were investigated using Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test and Spearman's rank correlation test. Only 3 countries (i.e. Ethiopia, Angola and Sao Tome and Principe) decreased open defecation by 10% or more between 2005 and 2010. No significant associations were observed between the change in open defecation prevalence and all of national level indices except per capita aid disbursement. Per capita aid disbursement for water and sanitation was positively associated with a reduction in open defecation (p-valueâ=â0.02) for a subset of 29 low-income countries from 2005 to 2010. Only one country in our analysis, Angola, is on track to end open defecation by 2015 based on their performance between 2000 and 2010. Most of the national level indices, including a country's economic status, were not associated with the change in the open defecation prevalence. Based on current trends, the goal\n\nHealth related quality of life in disorders of defecation: the Defecation Disorder List\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nVoskuijl, W; van der Zaag-Loon..., H J; Ketel, I; Grootenhuis, M; Derkx, B; Benninga, M\n\n2004-01-01\n\nBackground: Constipation and encopresis frequently cause problems with respect to emotional wellbeing, and social and family life. Instruments to measure Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) in these disorders are not available. Methods: A disease specific HRQoL instrument, the \"Defecation Disorder List\" (DDL) for children with constipation or functional non-retentive faecal soiling (FNRFS) was developed using accepted guidelines. For each phase of the process, different samples of patients were used. The final phase of development included 27 children. Reliability was assessed in two ways: internal consistency of domains with Cronbach's alpha, and test-retest reliability with intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC). To assess validity, comparable items and domains were correlated with Tacqol, a generic HRQoL instrument for children (TNO-AZL). Results: In the final phase of the development, 27 children completed the instrument. It consisted of 37 items in four domains. The response rate was 96%. Reliability was good for all domains, with Cronbach's alpha values ranging from 0.61 to 0.76. Measures of test-retest stability were good for all four domains with ICCs ranging from 0.82 to 0.92. Validity based on comparison with the Tacqol instrument was moderate. Conclusion: The DDL is promising as a measure of HRQoL in childhood defecation disorders.

The aim ofthis study was to measure the main aspects that characterized the excretion behaviour (defecation of the cows in 24hours that were divided into 3 day periods: 07:00-14:00 (I1, 14:00-2:001 (I2, 21:00-07:00 (I3. During theexperiments, the following defecation behaviour aspects were determined: total number of defecations, number ofdefecations in the three intervals, number of defecations according to administration order of forages (fibroussucculentsand succulents-fibrous. Data was computed by ANOVA/MANOVA. Results showed that the differencesbetween intervals I1-I2 and I1-I3 were statistically very significant (p< 0.01. In fibrous â succulent order thedefecation were 0.69 higher than in succulent- fibrous order (p< 0.01.

It may be performed using either a double-stapling technique (PPH-STARR) or with the new Contour Transtar (CT) device. The aim of this study was to evaluate the two techniques with respect to morbidity and functional outcomes. Patients presenting with ODS were evaluated using standardized clinical and radiological investigations and prospectively entered into a database. A total of 150 Patients were treated with either PPH-STARR (n = 68) or CT (n = 82) and further evaluated at 12 month postoperatively. The mean size of the resected specimen was 27 cm(2) (SD +/-4.86 cm(2)) in the PPH-STARR group and 46 cm(2) (SD +/-10.6 cm(2)) in the CT group [P < 0.001]. Morbidity was 7.3% (n = 5) in the PPH-STARR group and 7.5% (n = 6) in the CT group. The most common complication was minor postoperative bleeding in both groups (PPH-STARR: n = 2, 2.9%; CT: n = 2, 2.4%) Overall there were no septic complications and no surgical re-interventions. There was a tendency for more postoperative pain following CT (n = 3, 3.6%) as compared with PPH-STARR (n = 1, 1.4%). Constipation Scores (CCS) were 15.50 +/- 5.71 in the PPH-STARR group and 15.70 +/- 5.84 in the CT group preoperatively and decreased significantly to 8.25 (SD +/-1.45) and 8.01 (SD +/-2.31) 12-months after surgery. Values did not differ significantly between the two groups. Contour Transtar is as safe and effective as PPH-STARR and provides a true circumferential resection of rectal intussusception. This may benefit selected patients and result in improved long-term durability of the technique.\n\nEvidence that central pathways that mediate defecation utilize ghrelin receptors but do not require endogenous ghrelin.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nPustovit, Ruslan V; Callaghan, Brid; Ringuet, Mitchell T; Kerr, Nicole F; Hunne, Billie; Smyth, Ian M; Pietra, Claudio; Furness, John B\n\n2017-08-01\n\nIn laboratory animals and in human, centrally penetrant ghrelin receptor agonists, given systemically or orally, cause defecation. Animal studies show that the effect is due to activation of ghrelin receptors in the spinal lumbosacral defecation centers. However, it is not known whether there is a physiological role of ghrelin or the ghrelin receptor in the control of defecation. Using immunohistochemistry and immunoassay, we detected and measured ghrelin in the stomach, but were unable to detect ghrelin by either method in the lumbosacral spinal cord, or other regions of the CNS In rats in which the thoracic spinal cord was transected 5Â weeks before, the effects of a ghrelin agonist on colorectal propulsion were significantly enhanced, but defecation caused by water avoidance stress (WAS) was reduced. In knockout rats that expressed no ghrelin and in wild-type rats, WAS-induced defecation was reduced by a ghrelin receptor antagonist, to similar extents. We conclude that the ghrelin receptors of the lumbosacral defecation centers have a physiological role in the control of defecation, but that their role is not dependent on ghrelin. This implies that a transmitter other than ghrelin engages the ghrelin receptor or a ghrelin receptor complex. Â© 2017 The Authors.

METHODS: Repeated ultrasound measures of rectal diameter were performed in 28 children (14...... constipated/14 healthy, aged between 4 and 12 years) every third hour during 24âh. After defecation, three additional scans were performed at 1-h intervals. RESULTS: No diurnal variation in rectal diameter was found in the healthy group. In the constipated group, mean rectal diameter was significantly larger...... at 2âpm (P = 0.038) and 5âpm (P = 0.006). There were significant differences between rectal diameter in the healthy group and the constipated group at 2âpm (P = 0.016) and 5âpm (P = 0.027).

An experimental study].\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nIikura, M\n\n1995-06-01\n\nThe functional disorder of defecation after low anterior resection (LAR) was studied from the aspect of colonic motility in an experiment with dogs using a strain gage transducer, and the following results were obtained: 1) In early phase after LAR, the frequency of the colonic contractile waves increased at the proximal and distal sites of the anastomosis in both subgroups of dogs denervated and innervated of hypogastric and pelvic nerves. The increase was more remarkable at the distal site of the anastomosis. Also, the contractile waves were not propagated across the anastomosis. 2) After LAR, strong colonic contractions occurred during defecation only at the distal anastomosis. Various patterns of contraction time required for defecation were demonstrated as compared to a single pattern in control dogs. 3) The frequency of the occurrence of colonic contractile waves and the propagation of the contraction tended to be normalized with time after LAR both in denervated and innervated groups, though the recovery was faster in the latter subgroup. 4) The frequency of defecation increased after LAR both in denervated and innervated groups compared to be in the control dogs, though more remarkable in the denervated groups. Although tended to be gradually normalized with time after LAR, the colectomized dogs required a long time for normalization of the frequency of defecation. These results suggested the significant effect of reduction in reservoir space and disturbed continuity of intramural plexus caused by colectomy. Less severity, however, of functional disorder of defecation and earlier recovery from colonic motility disorder in the subgroup of the dogs innervated of autonomic nerves indicated usefulness of retaining autonomic nerves in colectomy.\n\nOpen defecation and childhood stunting in India: an ecological analysis of new data from 112 districts.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nSpears, Dean; Ghosh, Arabinda; Cumming, Oliver\n\n2013-01-01\n\nPoor sanitation remains a major public health concern linked to several important health outcomes; emerging evidence indicates a link to childhood stunting. In India over half of the population defecates in the open; the prevalence of stunting remains very high. Recently published data on levels of stunting in 112 districts of India provide an opportunity to explore the relationship between levels of open defecation and stunting within this population. We conducted an ecological regression analysis to assess the association between the prevalence of open defecation and stunting after adjustment for potential confounding factors. Data from the 2011 HUNGaMA survey was used for the outcome of interest, stunting; data from the 2011 Indian Census for the same districts was used for the exposure of interest, open defecation. After adjustment for various potential confounding factors--including socio-economic status, maternal education and calorie availability--a 10 percent increase in open defecation was associated with a 0.7 percentage point increase in both stunting and severe stunting. Differences in open defecation can statistically account for 35 to 55 percent of the average difference in stunting between districts identified as low-performing and high-performing in the HUNGaMA data. In addition, using a Monte Carlo simulation, we explored the effect on statistical power of the common practice of dichotomizing continuous height data into binary stunting indicators. Our simulation showed that dichotomization of height sacrifices statistical power, suggesting that our estimate of the association between open defecation and stunting may be a lower bound. Whilst our analysis is ecological and therefore vulnerable to residual confounding, these findings use the most recently collected large-scale data from India to add to a growing body of suggestive evidence for an effect of poor sanitation on human growth. New intervention studies, currently underway, may shed more\n\nAutism Spectrum Disorders in Children with Functional Defecation Disorders\n\nNARCIS (Netherlands)\n\nPeeters, B.; Noens, I.; Philips, E.M.; Kuppens, S.P.E.; Benninga, M.A.\n\n2013-01-01\n\nObjective: To prospectively assess the prevalence of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) symptoms in children presenting with functional defecation disorders.

After an initial assessment phase carried out during 1 month, 20 chronically constipated women with dyssynergic defecation were randomly assigned to either electromyographic biofeedback (EMG-BF) group (n=10) or control group (n=10). Outcome measures used to evaluate the efficacy of treatment were weekly stool frequency, sensation of incomplete evacuation, difficulty evacuation level, mean EMG-activity (Î¼V) of the external anal sphincter during straining to defecate and Anismus index. The results obtained in this randomized controlled trial showed significant differences between the groups in all the dependent variables after 1 month of treatment. Moreover, there was no difference between the groups neither in age nor in the duration of chronic constipation symptoms. At the follow-up, 3 months later, clinical gains were maintained. This study demonstrates that the EMG-BF is an effective behavioral therapy for the treatment of dyssynergic defecation in community-dwelling elderly women.\n\nStressful Life Events in Children With Functional Defecation Disorders\n\nNARCIS (Netherlands)\n\nPhilips, Elise M.; Peeters, Babette; Teeuw, Arianne H.; Leenders, Arnold G.

Bionomic characteristics that could influence the vectorial capacity of T. rubrovaria as vector of Trypanosoma cruzi were evaluated: patterns of (i feeding, (ii defecation, and (iii resistance to starvation, using insects fed on mice. Fifty three percent of the females showed a defecation pattern conducive to chagasic transmission, defecating either on or near the bite site. The averages of the resistance to starvation varied from 48.1 to 179 days, for the first and fifth nymphal stages, respectively. Our study shows that with respect to the patterns of feeding, defecation and resistance to fasting, T. rubrovaria presented similar rates to the ones observed for other effective vector species, such as T. infestans. Thus, based on our studies we conclude that T. rubrovaria has biological characteristics that can positively influence its capacity to become infected and transmit T. cruzi, and also to keep residual populations after chemical control interventions.\n\nAttention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder and Functional Defecation Disorders in Children\n\nNARCIS (Netherlands)\n\nKuizenga-Wessel, Sophie; Koppen, Ilan J.

Air velocity measurements vary significantly and can change rapidly depending on the exact measurement location and, in particular, due to the presence of obstructions in the air stream. Air velocity must be measured at locations away from obstructions to avoid the vortices and eddies that can produce inaccurate readings. Further, an uninterrupted measurement path cannot always be guaranteed when using continuous airflow monitors due to the presence of nearby equipment, personnel, roof falls and rib rolls. Effective use of these devices requires selection of a minimum distance from an obstacle, such that an air velocity measurement can be made but not affected by the presence of that obstacle. This paper investigates the impacts of an obstruction on the behavior of downstream airflow using a numerical CFD model calibrated with experimental test results from underground testing. Factors including entry size, obstruction size and the inlet or incident velocity are examined for their effects on the distributions of airflow around an obstruction. A relationship is developed between the minimum measurement distance and the hydraulic diameters of the entry and the obstruction. A final analysis considers the impacts of continuous monitor location on the accuracy of velocity measurements and on the application of minimum measurement distance guidelines.\n\nTrpA1 Regulates Defecation of Food-Borne Pathogens under the Control of the Duox Pathway.\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nEun Jo Du\n\n2016-01-01\n\nFull Text Available Pathogen expulsion from the gut is an important defense strategy against infection, but little is known about how interaction between the intestinal microbiome and host immunity modulates defecation. In Drosophila melanogaster, dual oxidase (Duox kills pathogenic microbes by generating the microbicidal reactive oxygen species (ROS, hypochlorous acid (HOCl in response to bacterially excreted uracil. The physiological function of enzymatically generated HOCl in the gut is, however, unknown aside from its anti-microbial activity. Drosophila TRPA1 is an evolutionarily conserved receptor for reactive chemicals like HOCl, but a role for this molecule in mediating responses to gut microbial content has not been described. Here we identify a molecular mechanism through which bacteria-produced uracil facilitates pathogen-clearing defecation. Ingestion of uracil increases defecation frequency, requiring the Duox pathway and TrpA1. The TrpA1(A transcript spliced with exon10b (TrpA1(A10b that is present in a subset of midgut enteroendocrine cells (EECs is critical for uracil-dependent defecation. TRPA1(A10b heterologously expressed in Xenopus oocytes is an excellent HOCl receptor characterized with elevated sensitivity and fast activation kinetics of macroscopic HOCl-evoked currents compared to those of the alternative TRPA1(A10a isoform. Consistent with TrpA1's role in defecation, uracil-excreting Erwinia carotovora showed higher persistence in TrpA1-deficient guts. Taken together, our results propose that the uracil/Duox pathway promotes bacteria expulsion from the gut through the HOCl-sensitive receptor, TRPA1(A10b, thereby minimizing the chances that bacteria adapt to survive host defense systems.\n\nInvestigation of the utility of colorectal function tests and Rome II criteria in dyssynergic defecation (Anismus).\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nRao, S S C; Mudipalli, R S; Stessman, M; Zimmerman, B\n\n2004-10-01\n\nAlthough 30-50% of constipated patients exhibit dyssynergia, an optimal method of diagnosis is unclear. Recently, consensus criteria have been proposed but their utility is unknown. To examine the diagnostic yield of colorectal tests, reproducibility of manometry and utility of Rome II criteria. A total of 100 patients with difficult defecation were prospectively evaluated with anorectal manometry, balloon expulsion, colonic transit and defecography. Fifty-three patients had repeat manometry. During attempted defecation, 30 showed normal and 70 one of three abnormal manometric patterns. Forty-six patients fulfilled Rome criteria and showed paradoxical anal contraction (type I) or impaired anal relaxation (type III) with adequate propulsion. However, 24 (34%) showed impaired propulsion (type II). Forty-five (64%) had slow transit, 42 (60%) impaired balloon expulsion and 26 (37%) abnormal defecography. Defecography provided no additional discriminant utility. Evidence of dyssynergia was reproducible in 51 of 53 patients. Symptoms alone could not differentiate dyssynergic subtypes or patients. Dyssynergic patients exhibited three patterns that were reproducible: paradoxical contraction, impaired propulsion and impaired relaxation. Although useful, Rome II criteria may be insufficient to identify or subclassify dyssynergic defecation. Symptoms together with abnormal manometry, abnormal balloon expulsion or colonic marker retention are necessary to optimally identify patients with difficult defecation.\n\nSleep Disorders in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease: Etiology, Impact, and Management\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nBudhiraja, Rohit; Siddiqi, Tauseef A.; Quan, Stuart F.\n\n2015-01-01\n\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality and may frequently be complicated by sleep disorders. Insomnia and obstructive sleep apnea are commonly encountered in patients with COPD. Nocturnal hypoxemia is also prevalent in COPD may occur despite adequate awake oxygenation and can be especially severe in rapid eye movement sleep. Additionally, several factorsâsome of them unique to COPDâcan contribute to sleep-related hypoventilation. Recognition of hypoventilation can be vital as supplemental oxygen therapy itself can acutely worsen hypoventilation and lead to disastrous consequences. Finally, accruing data establish an association between restless leg syndrome and COPDâ an association that may be driven by hypoxemia and/or hypercapnia. Comorbid sleep disorders portend worse sleep quality, diminished quality of life, and multifarious other adverse consequences. The awareness and knowledge regarding sleep comorbidities in COPD has continued to evolve over past many years. There are still several lacunae, however, in our understanding of the etiologies, impact, and therapies of sleep disorders, specifically in patients with COPD. This review summarizes the latest concepts in prevalence, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and management of diverse sleep disorders in COPD. Citation: Budhiraja R, Siddiqi TA, Quan SF.

Improving sanitation is an essential step towards reducing these deaths. This secondary analysis examined rural Tanzanian householdsâ sanitation behaviors and attitudes in order to identify barriers and drivers to latrine adoption. The analysis was conducted using results from a cross-sectional study of 1000 households in five rural districts of Tanzania. Motivating factors, perceptions, and constraints surrounding open defecation and latrine adoption were assessed using behavioral change theory. Results showed a significant association between use of improved sanitation and satisfaction with current sanitation facility (OR: 5.91; CI: 2.95â11.85; p = 0.008. Livestock-keeping was strongly associated with practicing open defecation (OR: 0.22; CI 0.063â0.75; p < 0.001. Of the 93 total households that practiced open defecation, 79 (85% were dissatisfied with the practice, 62 (67% had plans to build a latrine and 17 (18% had started saving for a latrine. Among households that planned to build a latrine, health was the primary reason stated (60%. The inability to pay for upgrading sanitation infrastructure was commonly reported among the households. Future efforts should consider methods to reduce costs and ease payments for households to upgrade sanitation infrastructure. Messages to increase demand for latrine adoption in rural Tanzania should integrate themes of privacy, safety, prestige and health. Findings indicate a need for lower cost sanitation options and financing strategies to increase household ability to adopt sanitation facilities.\n\nProcedure for prolapse and hemorrhoids vs traditional surgery for outlet obstructive constipation.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nLu, Ming; Yang, Bo; Liu, Yang; Liu, Qing; Wen, Hao\n\n2015-07-14\n\nTo compare the clinical efficacies of two surgical procedures for hemorrhoid rectal prolapse with outlet obstruction-induced constipation. One hundred eight inpatients who underwent surgery for outlet obstructive constipation caused by internal rectal prolapse and circumferential hemorrhoids at the First Affiliated Hospital of Xinjiang Medical University from June 2012 to June 2013 were prospectively included in the study. The patients with rectal prolapse hemorrhoids with outlet obstruction-induced constipation were randomly divided into two groups to undergo either a procedure for prolapse and hemorrhoids (PPH) (n = 54) or conventional surgery (n = 54; control group). Short-term (operative time, postoperative hospital stay, postoperative urinary retention, postoperative perianal edema, and postoperative pain) and long-term (postoperative anal stenosis, postoperative sensory anal incontinence, postoperative recurrence, and postoperative difficulty in defecation) clinical effects were compared between the two groups. The short- and long-term efficacies of the two procedures were determined. In terms of short-term clinical effects, operative time and postoperative hospital stay were significantly shorter in the PPH group than in the control group (24.36 Â± 5.16 min vs 44.27 Â± 6.57 min, 2.1 Â± 1.4 d vs 3.6 Â± 2.3 d, both P hemorrhoids.\n\nCaecal impaction and chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction in a dog.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nEastwood, J M; McInnes, E F; White, R N; Elwood, C M; Stock, G\n\n2005-02-01\n\nA 10-year-old female neutered cross-breed dog presented with a 4-month history of chronic intermittent diarrhoea and vomiting. Abdominal ultrasound showed dilated loops of small intestine and a suspected faecolith. Exploratory surgery revealed a caecal impaction and a typhlectomy was performed. Histopathological examination of caecal and full thickness small intestine sections demonstrated atrophy of smooth muscle fibres as well as an influx of plasma cells, lymphocytes and macrophages, and mild lymphoplasmacytic and eosinophilic enteritis. This combination of caecal impaction and chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction has not been reported previously in the dog.\n\nUsefulness of flexible covered stent in malignant colorectal obstruction\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nKang, Jee Hee; Kang, Sung Gwon; Kim, Hyung Jin; Noh, Hong Gi; Woo, Jae Hong; Suh, Chang Hae [Inha Univ. Hospital, Inchon (Korea, Republic of)\n\n1998-07-01\n\nTo evaluate the usefulness of flexible covered stent in the treatment of acute colorectal obstruction secondary to colorectal carcinoma. Materials and Methods : Flexible covered stents were placed in 11 patients with clinical and radiologic signs of acute colonic obstruction secondary to colorectal carcinoma. The purposes of stent insertion were pre-operative bowel preparation in seven patients and palliative treatment in four. A fistula was present in two;in one this was between the proximal jejunum and colon, and the other was rectovaginal. The usefulness of stent insertion for the purpose of preoperative bowel preparation was evaluated according to the feasibility and status of bowel preparation, as decided by the operator. Palliative treatment for the relief of symptoms of acute bowel obstruction was evaluated according to the number and amount of defecation,bowel dilatation in simple abdomen radiography, and the presence of complications. Results : Bowel preparation for the purpose of preoperative bowel cleansing was easy in seven patients;the fecal materials remaining in the colon presented no problems during surgery.
