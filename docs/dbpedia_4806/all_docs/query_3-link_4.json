        "text": "TARRYTOWN - For the first time during this training camp, the New York Rangers were able to practice Saturday in one group.\n\nThey trimmed their roster that morning, leaving a manageable 28 players to take the ice at the MSG Training Center.\n\n\"When you look at the group, they've all played really well,\" head coach Gerard Gallant said just before leaving for the annual team bonding trip to Rhode Island. \"They continue to play well, continue to make our job tough. We’ve got 23 roster spots and we'll see what happens.\"\n\nGallant followed that statement by acknowledging that \"it's very possible it could be less than\" the maximum 23, echoing what team president Chris Drury said just before camp.\n\nCarrying 22 players would leave the Rangers with close to $1 million in salary cap space, whereas a full 23 would push them uncomfortably close to the $82.5 million cap threshold.\n\n\"The less players I have around, the easier my decision-making,\" Gallant quipped. \"It's about health and everything. Obviously, cap space and all that stuff. So, there are lots of different reasons why you talk about that number (22). But really, that number doesn't bother me.\"\n\nMore:Early mornings of 'passing to nobody': Inside look at Artemi Panarin\n\nMore:Preseason takeaways: Kid Line maintains good vibes, others struggle\n\nIf that's the case, there aren't too many mysteries as the Oct. 11 opener against the Tampa Bay Lightning approaches.\n\nAs Gallant sees it, there are only a couple spots up for grabs.\n\n\"That's the tough part,\" he said. \"There's probably a spot on the blue line and there's probably a spot in the forward group. You guys could probably figure who’s fighting for those spots. It's a battle. You keep working hard. You keep playing well, and you make our decisions real tough.\"\n\nZac Jones leading D competition\n\nOne position that's looking more secure by the day is the left-handed defenseman on the bottom pair.\n\nZac Jones practiced in that spot again Saturday and is the only player who has appeared in preseason games next to incumbent right-handed D-man Braden Schneider.\n\n\"I try not to let it enter my head,\" Jones told lohud.com, part of the USA TODAY Network. \"If tomorrow I'm on a different line, whatever. Just go out there and play my game and just keep working hard. At some point, everything will fall into place.\"\n\nThe 2019 third-round pick is taking his cues from Schneider, who said earlier in camp that he's staying in a Westchester hotel, rather than renting or buying his own place, \"until my name is called\" on the final roster.\n\nThe pair of 21-year-olds aren't taking anything for granted, with Jones laughing as he pointed out, \"I'm on the same floor as Schneids\" in the hotel.\n\nThrough two preseason games, Jones has logged more than 40 minutes of ice time with a goal and 54.05% shot share, according to Natural Stat Trick, while also receiving power play looks. But perhaps his most memorable moment came on the other end, when he made a strong defensive play to stop a Jesper Bratt rush opportunity in its tracks in Friday's 2-1 win over the New Jersey Devils.\n\n\"Obviously, I make mistakes during games,\" he said. \"Everybody does, and I think I can improve on those. But I think I'm in a really good spot right now. I think I've been playing well. I'm doing everything I can control.\"\n\nThe former national champion at UMass has been steady, heeding Gallant's warning to, \"Make your plays, but don’t do it at the cost of defense.\"\n\nJones is well-aware that proving he can hold up defensively is the key to locking down a place in the lineup. He acknowledged that he \"got pushed around a lot\" with AHL Hartford last season, which led to him bulking up to 180 pounds in offseason to prepare for the physical demands of the NHL.\n\nHe gave himself an incomplete grade when asked if he feels he's improved in that area.\n\n\"It’s been 50-50,\" he said. \"Obviously, there are some big guys in this league, so I'm going to get pushed around here and there. But I feel like I'm holding my own out here and I feel like my legs just feel stronger in the corner and stuff like that. I feel like I'm not getting pushed around as much as I used to.\"\n\nThat will be something to monitor during the season, but it certainly appears the Rangers are preparing to give him the first crack at the job.\n\nFellow lefties Matt Bartkowski, Libor Hájek and Jarred Tinordi are the only other roster-bubble defensemen left in camp. Figure the Rangers will eventually cut two of them, with Hájek the favorite to stick as an extra.\n\nGustav Rydahl pushing Ryan Carpenter\n\nThe forward competition isn't quite as easy to figure out.\n\nIf we assume Ryan Reaves will make the roster − which he almost surely will − then the Rangers have 11 spots settled. Newly signed forward Ryan Carpenter also feels like a strong contender to make it because he plays center, kills penalties and has a history with Gallant from their time together in Vegas. But another center has emerged to push the 31-year-old veteran.\n\nGustav Rydahl, a 28-year-old who spent the previous nine seasons playing in the Swedish Hockey League, has impressed throughout the first week-plus of camp.\n\n\"He’s playing hard,\" Gallant said last week. \"The reports we got on him were basically what I’m seeing right now.\"\n\nRydahl is bigger (6-foot-3, 209 pounds) and faster than Carpenter, but he's also waivers exempt. That means the Rangers can send him to Hartford without fear of another team claiming him, which is not the case with Carpenter.\n\nStill, Rydahl sticking around for the team bonding trip means he shouldn’t be counted out. Expect to see him in at least one more preseason game before any final decisions are made.\n\nJimmy Vesey could force tough decision\n\nIf the 12th spot is going to a center, then the 13th will likely be one of the remaining wingers – Julien Gauthier, Dryden Hunt and Jimmy Vesey.\n\nGallant praised Gauthier for creating scoring chances in Friday’s preseason game – he leads the team with 13 this preseason, including seven that registered as high danger – but bluntly added, “You see our roster.”\n\nThe reality is that Hunt and Vesey profile as better fourth-liners, with the latter’s case for a spot getting harder to ignore.\n\nVesey has posted a goal, two assists and seven scoring chances through three preseason games, on top of reliable defensive play at even strength and on the PK. The 29-year-old, who’s in camp on a professional tryout offer, made a game-saving play to reach out his stick and deflect a shot from Andreas Johnsson in the closing minutes of Friday's win.\n\n\"We expected that,\" Gallant said. \"Once he signed the PTO here, we knew he's a good player and what he'd done last year. Obviously, he's in the mix with those guys.\"\n\nTop-line shuffle\n\nThere's no question that both Sammy Blais and Barclay Goodrow will make the roster, but where they'll play remains up in the air.\n\nBoth are probably best-served in the bottom six, but unless Gallant is going to breakup the Kid Line of Alexis Lafrenière, Filip Chytil and Kaapo Kakko − which doesn't appear to be the plan at this point − one of the two will be needed to play further up in the lineup.\n\nBlais spent the first week-plus of camp mostly working with star forwards Chris Kreider and Mika Zibanejad, but he swapped places with Goodrow for Saturday's practice.\n\nGallant has hinted that both could be used as the right-winger on the top line, depending on the situation. But with Blais still working to regain his timing following right ACL surgery last November, it appears that the coach is temporarily reeling him in.\n\n\"Blaiser’s played one hockey game in 10 months, so we’ll give him an opportunity to play and see how things shake down,\" Gallant said. \"I can’t honestly say if that's going to be a line right now, but we'll see where it goes.\""
