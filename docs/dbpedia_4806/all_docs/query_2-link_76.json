        "text": "The Rangers still have something to play for with two games left in their regular season — an incredibly remote chance at a Metro Division title and a slightly less remote chance at home ice in the opening round — so we’re not going to ignore what’s still to come this week.\n\nBut we will take a brief interlude here to look back to October and the 10 bold predictions laid out before this season began. There’s a couple of decent hits, the usual pack of misses and overall not a terribly deluded sense of where the 2022-23 season was headed.\n\nHere we go:\n\nThe Rangers’ leading goal scorer will be … Mika Zibanejad\n\nAccuracy level: 5 stars\n\nFirst one out of the gate is on target! We tossed out 37 goals for Zibanejad this season; he’s at 39 with two games to go, on the verge of his second 40-goal season as a Ranger. Chris Kreider is making a late charge with 36 goals, which probably surpassed most people’s expectations on the heels of his 52-goal 2021-22, so we’ll see how much the Zibanejad-Kreider bromance defers to one another in their pursuit of individual milestones.\n\nThe Rangers will have seven 15-goal scorers this season\n\nAccuracy level: 5 stars\n\nTwo for two! Even nailed the seven who’d hit that mark, with a couple of names and totals switched around — Alexis Lafrenière will need a big finish to reach 20 but he and Kaapo Kakko broke through the 15-goal mark after slow starts. Vincent Trocheck and Filip Chytil cracked 20-plus, Artemi Panarin is at 26 and Zibanejad and Kreider lead the way. Adam Fox sits at 12 and we did say he’d get close, but that doesn’t quite make the cut. Vladimir Tarasenko and Patrick Kane are over 15 for the year but neither got there just with the Rangers, so we can’t count them.\n\nIgor Shesterkin will not win the Vezina Trophy again\n\nAccuracy level: 5 stars\n\nProbably one Ranger fans wish was wrong, but Shesterkin’s fate was basically sealed as written in October: Unless he was going to pull a Dominik Hasek and throw out another over-.930 save percentage season, the NHL general managers who vote on this award would surely look elsewhere. Shesterkin may pull in a couple fourth- or fifth-place votes but he’s not going to be a finalist. Even so, he’s sitting with a .915 save percentage in a season when the league average is .899. Not too shabby.\n\nK’Andre Miller gets more Norris Trophy votes than Adam Fox\n\nAccuracy level: 1 star\n\nThe first whiff of the list. Miller has had a very strong season, up to 43 points, 38 of those at even strength — just two behind Fox and top 15 in the league for defensemen. But Fox made his case for a second Norris Trophy for a lot of this season, though he will almost certainly come up short of the Sharks’ Erik Karlsson this time around. It’s a big leap for Miller to reach the Foxian level.\n\nBrennan Othmann will play at least one NHL playoff game\n\nAccuracy level: TBD (but likely 1 star)\n\nOthmann had a very solid training camp and just about everyone in the Rangers organization lamented that the 2021 first-rounder had to go back to the OHL. Othmann was traded from Flint to Peterborough in November and the Petes are in the second round of the OHL playoffs, so Othmann may not even arrive in the organization until the NHL and AHL playoffs are underway.\n\nThere’s also the small matter of the Rangers having traded for Tarasenko and Kane, so Othmann wouldn’t be parachuting into a spot of need among the Rangers forwards. If he makes it in time for Hartford’s AHL playoff stint, he’ll go there; if not, he’ll almost certainly be a Black Ace with the Rangers, skating and watching their postseason run.\n\nThe first call-up will be … Gustav Rydahl\n\nAccuracy level: o stars\n\nNot even close! And now we’re on a pretty ugly run of missed calls. Rydahl did indeed impress in training camp but lost out to NHL veteran Ryan Carpenter for the No. 4 center spot. Julien Gauthier was the first call-up from Hartford a week into the season and Rydahl didn’t do enough to earn a look, even when Carpenter fell out of favor and went to Hartford.\n\nRydahl was traded at the deadline to the Avalanche organization. Doesn’t seem like there’s much room there either, so the 28-year-old’s stay in North America could be one and done.\n\nChris Drury makes two trades during the season …\n\nAccuracy level: 3 stars\n\nTechnically there were five trades involving NHL players from Drury and three that brought in roster players. We were on target identifying a third-pair left defenseman to replace the Zac Jones/Libor Hajek rotation, though for most of the season that was tryout signee Ben Harpur. Niko Mikkola will be there in the playoffs, though, and we’ll take that as a correct-ish call.\n\n… and Patrick Kane will be a Ranger\n\nAccuracy level: 5 stars\n\nOn target! Kane’s desire to only be a Ranger and Drury’s crazy couple weeks of roster contortions made the difficult possible. After acquiring Mikkola and Tarasenko, it didn’t seem that the Rangers needed Kane; it remains to be seen if they still do and whether he can be a playoff force. But we said it was going to happen and it happened. The end.\n\nThe Rangers win the Metro\n\nAccuracy level: 2 stars\n\nThey begin the final week of the season still alive for the division title, so maybe this isn’t totally off base… But it’s not great. The Rangers’ 11-10-5 start to the season essentially sealed their fate when it came to winning the Metro crown, so the fact that they are even mathematically in it still after 80 games is an accomplishment. And if the Rangers were in either West division they’d have had it locked up already. It’s potentially a sixth-overall finish for the Rangers this season; too bad for them that two of the five better teams are in the Metro as well.\n\nThe Rangers take another step but lose in the Final\n\nAccuracy level: TBD\n\nThe Rangers have as good a shot as any team to get out of the Metro and into the Eastern Conference Final again. The Bruins look invincible, but this is the NHL playoffs we’re talking about. The Rangers won’t face the Islanders in round one, but they could see the Hurricanes and Leafs in the next two rounds, as we projected. As for losing in the Stanley Cup Final? That’s a maybe. To the Blues? Jeez, that’s awful. Negative-10 stars.\n\n(Photo: Eric Hartline / USA TODAY Sports)"
