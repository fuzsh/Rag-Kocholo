        "text": "The Colorado Eagles wrapped up the season series against the Rockford IceHogs on Saturday night. Colorado led the series (2-0-1) going into the final game, but hoped to close it out with a win and gain more ground on Abbotsford ahead of them in the Pacific Division. What was a back and forth game turned into a late game thriller. A Ryan Merkley turnover would be costly and result in the Eagles walking away with their heads down.\n\nFirst Period\n\nA spicy way to start the game was a monster hit on Callahan Burke that would eventually lead to a Kale Kessy fight. Later in the period, Colorado was on the power play. They would start the play down low and get the puck up to the point with David Farrance, who passed it along the blue line to Ben Meyers. He would get it back down low to Spencer Smallman who would turn and do a between the legs shot over the shoulder of goaltender Arvid Soderblom.\n\nIt wasnâ€™t much later that Rockford would strike back. With about seven and a half minutes left, Rockford worked out of their zone with a stretch pass from Brett Seney to Rocco Grimaldi in the neutral zone. This set up a two on one with Zach Jordan for an easy wrister past goaltender Justus Annunen to tie it at one.\n\nSecond Period\n\nThe period did not start off as dramatically as the first did with the hits or fights. It took about nine minutes of game time for someone to score. Justin Scott and Luke Philp lined up for a face off in the Colorado zone. Philip would get the win and get the puck back to Grimaldi on the point. Grimaldi took a hard slapper and Philip tipped it in right behind Annunen to make it 2-1.\n\nIt took a few minutes for the Eagles to even it up at twelve minutes into the period. Colorado was on the power play and having trouble getting set in the zone. Burke was able to squeak past the blue line and wait for Gustav Rydahl to get to the mid-slot. Burke sent it over to Rydahl and he hammered it home to tie it at two.\n\nAround The AHL\n\n[catlist name=AHL]\n\nThird Period and Overtime\n\nThe third period was a back and forth marathon of both teams trying to get the advantage. Colorado surprisingly outshot Rockford 14-11 in the period, but each team exchanged two penalties apiece. The real excitement came during overtime. Each team had four shots apiece but had several odd man rushes that would keep everyone on the edge of their seat. On a two-on-one opportunity by the Eagles with about a minute left, Merkley tried to make a cross-slot pass to Rydahl, but it hit the skates of Grimaldi and right onto the stick of Jakub Galvas. He sped down the ice to the left hash marks and passed over to David Gust in the slot. Gust slid the puck over to his backhand and shot it past a motionless Annunen for the 3-2 win.\n\nConclusion\n\nTwo things added up to kill the Eagles last night (other than the costly turnover).\n\n1) The Eagles were not able to wake up until late into the second period. They stood at about nine shots on goal until five minutes left in the second when they started to really open up.\n\n2) Another thing that killed the Eagles were the penalties. They had nine total penalties for four Rockford power plays. The IceHogs were able to convert on one of them and it was the difference in the game.\n\nIn the end, Colorado still gained a much needed point out of the game. They head back home on Tuesday to take on the San Jose Barracuda at the Budweiser Event Center."
