        "text": "Drama Series Pitch\n\nThe Drama Series Pitch showcases 15 of the most exciting development projects from the professional community that are looking for partners to take them to the next level. Each of the projects will present a 10-minute pitch with the winner receiving a marketing package through C21Media worth £30,000.\n\nThe Drama Series Pitch is back for a 3rd year at Content London. From over 100 submissions, 15 projects have been selected to pitch for the first time to the international drama business.\n\nModerator: Jamie Mustard, author, The Iconist & Jimmy Akingbola, actor and co-founder, TriForce Creative Network\n\nJudges:\n\nNadine Nohr, acquisitions consultant, Huanxi Media\n\nMeghan Lyvers, SVP, co-production and development, CBS Studios International\n\nRola Bauer, managing director, Studio Canal TV\n\nPhilipp Steffens, head of fiction, RTL Television\n\nGina Marcheschi, head of scripted television, VICE STUDIOS\n\nThe fifteen shows selected to pitch are:\n\nAlive: The Mystery of MOAG Station\n\nFilm UA (Ukraine)\n\nSome time in the future, after the humanity had to abandon Earth, kids are being raised by AI on a spaceship floating in the depths of the universe. There are no adults around, as they are supposed to be on the upper deck running the ship. The teens eagerly wait till they turn 15 as they then take exams – a rite of passage of sorts – based on which they are allocated their place in the adult society. Except that it turns out there are no adults on the upper deck – everyone over fifteen just gets killed by the main computer. Children of the Underground – a group of teenagers, who managed to survive, have to fight for their lives and for the lives of all the other children on the station. What happened to the adults? Why are some portions of the spaceship sealed off? Are robots and AI the enemy they think them to be? Or is there something bigger and more sinister going on? This is a story of a group of brave teens coming of age and finding what it means to be ALIVE in a world that is nothing like they thought it to be.\n\nSpeakers: Kateryna Vyshnevska, Head of Development and Co-productions and Producer, FILM.UA Group\n\nElena Malkova, Producer, FILM.UA Group\n\nBeyond Nature\n\nGutsy Animations (Finland)\n\nBeyond Nature is a psychological thriller in six episodes. It reveals what happens to a person when the mind shatters, our link to nature is severed and ego takes over. Genre: psychological thriller Length: 6 x 50 minutes Language: English / Finnish When a young and successful visual artist Stella returns from London to her roots in Finland, her life changes completely. Dark childhood memories, Finnish mythology and disturbing visions of horror intertwine and result in works of art that seem to carry a curse and cause a series of dark incidents. Stella’s mind is shaken, and she starts to believe that she has caused the events. But are they caused by Stella’s dangerous art that has come to life, her shattered mind, or is there a murderer who is using Stella to further their own ends?\n\nSpeakers: Paavo Westerberg, Cinema Director\n\nMarika Makaroff, CEO, Gutsy Animations\n\nBorderline\n\nOchre Moving Pictures (South Africa) and About Premium Content (France)\n\nDaniel, an American lawyer who’s built a new life in South Africa, feels guilty about Jessica, his ailing wife who he feels he broke. Desperately looking for ways to pay for her expensive treatment, Daniel crosses legal line after moral line in his job. It all finally catches up with him when he finds himself at the centre of an embezzlement scandal. Disbarred, in debt and in serious physical danger, he has no choice but to flee Johannesburg to the Eastern Tripoint Border, a hot bed of international smuggling, to hide on Jessica’s family game farm, their last remaining asset. In dire need of money and with his back against the wall, Daniel becomes a smuggler and teams up with Jessica’s childhood friend Laylani, an ambitious ex-game ranger who will guide him through this dangerous and unpredictable world in exchange for ownership of his ancestral land, located on Jessica’s farm. A dysfunctional crime family is born. Borderline is an adventure fuelled and layered human drama that shines a new light on modern-day South Africa, revealing its many racial, social and environmental complexities.\n\nSpeakers: Erik Durbin, Lead Writer\n\nRobbie Thorpe, Creator & Writer\n\nDark Hearts\n\nZDF Enterprises (Germany), Mnet (South Africa) and Quizzical (South Africa)\n\nEdie, an investigative journalist, is stunned by the brutal murder of her estranged brother.\n\nShe is quickly drawn into the nightmarish aftermath when she’s reunited with her orphaned teenage niece and nephew. But then the two become suspects of the unimaginable crime themselves. The supposed motive? A huge inheritance.\n\nEdie determines to find the real killer, digging deep into the contradictory world of post-Apartheid South Africa. In the leafy suburbs white privilege continues untouched while gang violence ravages desperately poor neighbourhoods. Edie follows elusive clues across these apparently impassable divides.\n\nMeanwhile, she grapples with her own sense of guilt: she gave up her boy to be raised by her brother as his own. She is also at loggerheads with Detective Forty, who is fighting his own battle for justice in a crumbling police service. Suspects slowly emerge: the beloved housekeeper who was ‘part of the family’. A deranged high school student who was infatuated with the mom. A drug-addled hired killer from the badlands. But in the end it is a secret closer to home that holds the key.\n\nThe story dissects a tight community, structured around a very personal journey, in the vein of Big Little Lies or Sharp Objects. Dark Hearts is at once a gripping mystery, a complex family drama and a searing indictment of a country struggling to redeem itself from the sins of the past.\n\nSpeakers: Darrel Bristow-Bovey, Head Writer\n\nNimrod Geva, head of development, Quizzical Pictures\n\nExtravagance\n\nAT-Prod (Belgium) and Zeitsprung Pictures (Germany)\n\nIn 2008, a global financial crisis is shaking the markets. It was impossible to predict the crisis that struck without warning. But was it really?
