        "text": "BACKGROUND: For a long time, giving the diagnosis of cancer was considered something cruel and inhuman. Many times, doctors would prefer that patient should not know the name of the disease, in order that, they would not lose hope. Doctors believed that there was no treatment available for cancer. Having in mind such social representation, the present study main goal was to know the influence of such representation in the reaction to diagnosis during the treatment. METHOD: Participated in this study 100 patients, of booth genders (39% male and 61% female), with the age between 17 and 86 years (median of 55 years), with 17 types of cancer. Those patients were accompanied in a specialized center in cancer, in the capital of Brazil. The research project was authorized by an ethics committee. The procedures of gathering data included in the consent of the patient and application of a structured interview during treatment. A content analysis of answers was made, with help of the software SPSS 16.0 and ALCESTE. RESULTS: The content analysis of reports identified three categories of representation of cancer, that maintained themselves during the treatment: serious and fatal disease (88%), serious disease, but treatable (9%) and disease similar to any other one (3%). In relation to reaction to diagnosis; 40% of the patients became afraid and worried; 24% became desperate; 16% had a pessimist attitude; 10% were discontented; 7% denied; 3% became frustrated. The analysis of the ALCESTE showed a relation between the cancer concept and the way patient react to diagnosis. This relationship is influenced by the history and personality of each patient. CONCLUSIONS: The fact that the increase of survival may change the cancer into a chronic disease did not diminish the stigma imposed by the historic perspective. Till today, this disease is connected to death, which compromises the coping of patients. The social representation favored negative reactions to diagnosis, similar to those related by the patients. Thus, we can infer that the initial concept of cancer does not change independent of chances of being cured. This concept is latent while the situation is favorable and it manifests itself when an expected event appears and that confirms the initial representation of this disease. RESEARCH IMPLICATIONS: The relationship between cancer and death brings up the need of new educational programs that may soothe the historic stigma and negative appeal of the midia. Furthermore, it asks for studies that investigate the influence of that relationship in the behavior, as for example: early diagnosis—fear of the disease inhibits the looking for medical assistance; coping with a diagnosis and treatment; hyper precaution with health, obsessive thoughts and hypochondria patients in remission. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Knowing the patient’s concept about his own disease favors a minimization of possible negative or positive fantasies that may compromise the coping of patient and adherences to treatment. Such perception may be related with distress, anxiety and depression - answers expected from the person who has cancer. Such knowledge, can favor the adequate assistance to patients because of the understanding of suffering and doubts present in the phases of disease. ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF FUNDING: None."
