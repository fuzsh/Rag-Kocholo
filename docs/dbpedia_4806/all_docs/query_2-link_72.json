        "text": "ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡º Russia 1-0 Sweden ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡ª\n\nChannel One Cup\n\nCSKA Arena, Moscow ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡º\n\nThursday, 16 December 2021\n\nIn a tight, tense contest, Russia edged Sweden in the second match of the 2021 Channel One Cup, holding on to claim an important 1-0 victory at the CSKA Arena.\n\nThe Swedes had the better of the first period.\n\nIn truth, they should have struck gold in the first minute of proceedings, as Gustav Rydahl could only thump the puck against Ivan Fedotovâ€™s body at point-blank range after our goalkeeper had mistakenly expected an icing call.\n\nOn an odd-man rush, Malte StrÃ¶mwall later passed up a glorious opportunity for Sweden, blasting off target with only the goaltender to beat. At the other end, the Russiansâ€™ best spell of play was witnessed during an early powerplay, with Nikita Gusev and Sergei Plotnikov coming close from inviting positions. Fedotov was the busier goaltender in the opening frame as he was forced into 10 saves in comparison to Magnus Hellbergâ€™s seven.\n\nThe manner of the game didnâ€™t change in the second period.\n\nSweden continued to play on the front foot and create the majority of the opportunities. After defensive errors, StrÃ¶mwall, Rydahl and Dmytro Timashov all had clear chances for the Swedes, but Fedotov came to the rescue for the hosts with a handful of difficult stops. Towards the end of a somewhat uneventful stanza, Russia were gifted a powerplay chance to begin generating attacking traction, however Hellberg calmly dealt with the challenge in the Swedish net.\n\nThe breakthrough was eventually made in the eighth minute of the third period.\n\nOn the counter-attack, Gusev picked out the onrushing Vyacheslav Voinov with an intelligent pass, who managed to carefully slide the puck over the line with Hellberg unable to freeze it.\n\nThe rest of the match predictably saw Sweden throw everything at the Russians. Nevertheless, despite pulling Hellberg for the extra skater with more than two minutes remaining in the frame and carving open a number of excellent chances, the away team simply couldnâ€™t find that elusive equalizer with Fedotov in unbeatable form.\n\nBOXSCORE\n\n1st Period\n\n00:28 â€“ ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡ª PEN â€“ Larsson, tripping\n\n04:43 â€“ ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡º PEN â€“ Plotnikov, tripping\n\n2nd Period\n\n35:15 â€“ ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡ª PEN â€“ Almqvist, holding\n\n3rd Period\n\n47:54 â€“ ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡º GOAL â€“ Voinov (Gusev, Tkachyov)\n\nGOALTENDERS\n\nW: ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡º Fedotov (25-25)\n\nL: ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡ª Hellberg (34-35)\n\nSHOTS ON GOAL\n\nðŸ‡·ðŸ‡º 10+8+17 = 35\n\nðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡ª 7+9+9 = 25\n\nROSTERS\n\nðŸ‡·ðŸ‡º Goaltenders: Ivan Fedotov, Alexander Samonov.
