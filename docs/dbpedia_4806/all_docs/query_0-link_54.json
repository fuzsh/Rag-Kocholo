        "text": "[sendtonews key=”peKAXibZ” type=”player”]\n\nThe New York Rangers will be looking to fill out some key spots in their lineup next season with low-cost, high-reward talent due to salary cap constraints.\n\nFree agency brought that stark reality to life when they let all their unrestricted free agents walk. Ryan Strome, Andrew Copp, Frank Vatrano, Justin Braun, and very likely Tyler Motte will not be wearing Rangers’ blue next season.\n\nInstead, they went for an upgrade at the second line center position with Vincent Trocheck and signed Jaroslav Halak to be the new backup. They even traded away Patrik Nemeth’s $2.5M cap hit away to make sure they can re-sign Kaapo Kakko and leave some space for trade deadline acquisitions.\n\nIn 2022-23, the Rangers will need a defense partner for Braden Schneider on the third pairing, plus forward replacements for those free agents that walked.\n\nLet’s dive into the team’s most NHL ready prospects.\n\nRanking New York Rangers NHL ready prospects\n\nBelow are my top 10 rankings for the New York Rangers by NHL readiness.\n\nIn order to be considered for this list, the player must not have been part of the active roster used during the playoffs.\n\nAnalyzing Rangers prospects NHL readiness\n\nCan Play Next Season\n\nZac Jones: Without a doubt, he is the most NHL ready prospect thanks to his experience with the big club and an excellent hockey IQ. He led all Wolf Pack blue-liners last year with 9 goals and 35 points in 52 games. He was also called up a few times by the Rangers adding 2 assists in 12 games. For his NHL career, Jones has 6 points (all assists) in 22 contests.\n\nVitali Kravtsov: The former first round selection, 9th overall, from 2018 was expected to be traded last year after refusing AHL assignment and bolting for Russia. However, the salary cap crunch can change a lot of opinions and the Rangers need his offensive talent on the third line. Kravtsov had a strong 2021-22 season in the KHL by recording 6 goals and 13 points in 19 matches. During the playoffs, he added 7 goals and 10 points in 15 games.\n\nNils Lundkvist: The 21 year-old defenseman struggled to adjust coming over from Sweden but still showed enough skill as to why he was taken in the first round of the 2018 NHL Entry Draft. In 25 games with the Rangers, he posted 1 goal and 4 points last year. He picked up an additional 15 points in 34 games with the Wolf Pack in the AHL. After adjusting to the North American style of play, he could be a factor next season. The question is can he make the switch to the left side?\n\nBorderline Ready\n\nMatthew Robertson: He’s a left handed defenseman that the New York Rangers selected in the second round of the 2019 Draft. At 6-4 and 201 lbs, he already has the size to play in the NHL but has taken a little more time to develop than some of the other prospects on the blue-line. Last year, he posted 11 points in 65 games for the Wolf Pack. His familiarity with Braden Schneider as a defense partner could give him an edge.\n\nWill Cuylle: In 2021, the 6-3, 212 lbs forward was invited to Rangers camp and impressed management. He was still cut but that may not be the case this time around. In 50 regular-season games in the OHL, he posted 43 goals and 80 points. Cuylle added another 15 goals and 31 points in 25 playoff games. The second round pick from the 2020 Draft looks physically ready to be a force in the NHL soon.\n\nBrennan Othmann: He’s strongly considered one of the New York Rangers’ top prospects. The 19 year-old was selected in the first round of the 2021 NHL Entry Draft 16th overall and has done nothing but stand out since. In 66 regular games, he posted 50 goals and 97 points and then added 9 goals and 24 points in 19 postseason contests. There’s no doubt that he will be an NHL player, but does it make sense to play a future top-six winger on the fourth line?\n\nBobby Trivigno: He was a late signing out of college and after a successful college career where he won the NCAA National Championship in 2021, he’s gained a reputation as a clutch performer. Last year, he scored 49 points with 20 goals for UMass earning himself College Hockey News’ Player of the Year Award. In limited action with the Wolf Pack, he scored a goal and added two assists in 11 contests. He has his list of doubters thanks to his 5-8, 161 lbs frame, but he also has the heart and smarts to play in the NHL.\n\nOutside shot\n\nGustav Rydahl: At 27 years-old it’s hard to consider him a prospect. Rydahl is a big forward at 6-3, 201 lbs that can also play center. Signed as a free agent out of Sweden, he scored 30 points in 44 SHL games. Expect him to start the season with the Hartford Wolf Pack after the Rangers signed veteran pivot Ryan Carpenter recently. However, keep an eye on Rydahl as someone who could surprise at camp.\n\nLauri Pajuniemi: Taken by the Blueshirts in the fifth round of the 2018 Draft, they thought highly enough of the forward to at least place him on the taxi squad last year. This past season in the AHL, he scored 13 goals and 26 points in 51 games for the Wolf Pack. It’s getting close to now or never for the young Finn to make the NHL.\n\nBrett Berard: The Rangers selected Berard in the 5th round of the 2020 Draft. He’s fast and feisty but a bit undersized at 5-9, 154 lbs. Berard has yet to sign his ELC and will be entering his junior year at Providence College. He registered 38 points in 36 games last season. Could he make an impact for the big club at some point over the next two seasons?\n\nNHL Rumors\n\nNHL Rumors: J.T. Miller trade, plus Pierre-Luc Dubois and Patrik Laine\n\nJohnny Gaudreau stuns everyone, signs with Blue Jackets\n\nNazem Kadri still weighing options"
