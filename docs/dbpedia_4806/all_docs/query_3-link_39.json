As of Thursday [general manager] Pierre Dorian is still said to be working the phones. He hasn’t necessarily locked in on one priority, I think he wants to survey what’s left.\n\n\"We know it’s not a lot left out there to get but in the past we know that Dorian has been looking for another centre for his team. He’s also told his players that he’s going to try to add and give them the best chance to play meaningful games into March and he’s in that position now.\"\n\nThe Senators, who have won four straight, are four points back of the New York Islanders for the final wild-card spot with three games in hand. The Buffalo Sabres are between the two teams, tied with the Senators at 66 points with one less game played.\n\nCould Edmundson be dealt?\n\nMontreal Canadiens defenceman Joel Edmundson returned to the team's lineup Thursday for the first time since Jan. 26.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether that will be his final game with the team.\n\nTSN Hockey Insider Pierre LeBrun reports there is interest in Edmundson, with the Calgary Flames among the potential suitors\n\n\"He’s a player who may not get traded but he is still on the market. There are a couple of teams interested, I’m told, in Edmundson, who has another year on his contract. To some teams that can be scary because of some of the injuries he’s coming back from. He’s expected to play tonight in Los Angeles, although he’s a game-time decision. To some teams that’s a value because they don’t want to spend on a rental. I will tell you this, there is one team that told me: “We need to see him play tonight.”\n\n\"One of the teams that, we believe, has talked to Montreal is the Calgary Flames. One of the things about the Flames is that they are in such a tough spot right now with where they are in the standings.. But in terms of Joel Edmundson, he would fit their needs because he’s not a rental. The Flames are not in a position where they can spend big for a short-term solution.\"\n\nEdmundson logged 16:24 of ice time of 19 shifts and took a minor penalty against the Los Angeles Kinsg Thursday. The 29-year-old, who's signed through next season at a $3.5 million cap hit, has one goal and six points in 40 games this season.\n\nContentId(1.1926144): Insider Trading: Will Canadian teams still be active ahead of the deadline?\n\nDomi dealt last night\n\nThe deadline deals continued Thursday night as the Dallas Stars acquired Max Domi and goaltender Dylan Wells from the Chicago Blackhawks for veteran goaltender Anton Khudobin and a 2025 second-round pick.\n\nDomi had a team-best 18 goals and 31 assists in 60 games with Chicago. The 28-year-old is a pending unrestricted free agent, carrying a $3 million cap hit this season.\n\nKhudobin, a pending unrestricted free agent, has played only at the AHL level this season."
