        "text": "LOVELAND, Colo. – The Colorado Eagles were looking to move on to the second round against the Ontario Reign on Friday night with just one more victory. Coming off an overtime win on Wednesday, Colorado would be riding the high and — more than likely — the more difficult team to beat. The Eagles were trying to keep their win streak against the Reign alive, as Colorado had won the the last four playoff games between the two.\n\nThe crowd was certainly a factor in game one and have played their role in the home ice advantage. Every Eagles player has mentioned that the crowd keeps them in the game, so Colorado was definitely going to have that on their side.\n\nThere were some late minute changes to the lineup with Gustav Rydahl coming out and Kale Kessy coming in. Considering Game One got a little physical, this isn’t much of a surprise at all. Kessy would bring some much needed grit to the lineup that hasn’t been there.\n\nFirst Period\n\nOntario would be the first on the board with a broken play after a blocked shot. Only about two and half minutes into the frame, Nate Schnarr snapped a shot that would be blocked by Mitchell Vande Sompel. Schnarr gathered the rebound and threw it in front for Lias Andersson to finish the play past an unsuspecting Justus Annunen.\n\nAbout two minutes later, Colorado would tie it back up. Ondrej Pavel worked the puck low into the zone and attempted a wraparound on goaltender Cal Petersen. Kessy would be a great lineup decision after all, as he buried the rebound to tie the game at one.\n\nSecond Period\n\nIn the second period, things got physical once more as about seven minutes in, Pavel tried carrying the puck into the zone. Suddenly, he was hit hard along the boards and couldn’t move on the ice. Matt Stienburg would come to his defense — along with Kessy — as Pavel left for the locker room and would not return to the game.\n\nThen, with nine minutes left in the period, Sam Malinski passed through the neutral zone up to Alex Galchenyuk for a shot in front. There wasn’t much effort needed for Oskar Olausson to make it 2-1.\n\nColorado would continue to dominate play. Five minutes later, Olausson carried the puck in unopposed and dropped it for Ryan Wagner to snap on Petersen. The puck took a lucky bounce off his shoulder and into the net to make it 3-1.\n\nAround The AHL\n\n[catlist name=AHL]\n\nThird Period\n\nThe third period became a goal scoring fest. A total of six goals were scored between the teams, but Colorado was able to keep the healthy lead. All of the goals wouldn’t even be scored until after eight minutes into the frame. Charles Hudon connected on a power play goal with Vande Sompel. Aidan Dudas would nail a breakaway goal only a minute and a half later to make the score 4-2. Cedric Paré joined in on the fun with a snapper from the left circle after receiving a pass from Malinski. Ontario would make a great effort for a comeback by pulling Petersen late for an extra attacker. The Reign would score two more, but it was not enough. Paré put the nail in the coffin with the empty netter and the final would be 6-4.\n\nConclusion\n\nOntario looked tired throughout the entire game. Coach Greg Cronin thought that the Reign looked like they wanted it, but they sure were not playing like it. Honestly, Colorado wanted the win more than Ontario did. Despite being outshot 34-26, the Eagles dominated most of the puck possession. They made smart plays by not passing into high danger zones and kept it out of the Reign’s hands. Colorado was able to convert both power play opportunities and kill the one they had to defend, remaining perfect in both categories.\n\nComing into the game, Colorado was first in the league for both the man advantage and the penalty kill in the playoffs. It will definitely be harder to keep those ranks as the postseason continues, especially with the possibility of facing Coachella Valley or Abbotsford in the second round."
