The maize (Zea mays) recessive carbohydrate partitioning defective28 (cpd28) and cpd47 mutants exhibit leaf chlorosis and accumulation of starch and soluble sugars. Transport studies with 14C-sucrose (Suc) found drastically decreased export from mature leaves in cpd28 and cpd47 mutants relative to wild-type siblings. Consistent with decreased Suc export, cpd28 mutants exhibited decreased phloem pressure in mature leaves, and altered phloem cell wall ultrastructure in immature and mature leaves. We identified the causative mutations in the Brittle Stalk2-Like3 (Bk2L3) gene, a member of the COBRA family, which is involved in cell wall development across angiosperms. None of the previously characterized COBRA genes are reported to affect carbohydrate export. Consistent with other characterized COBRA members, the BK2L3 protein localized to the plasma membrane, and the mutants condition a dwarf phenotype in dark-grown shoots and primary roots, as well as the loss of anisotropic cell elongation in the root elongation zone. Likewise, both mutants exhibit a significant cellulose deficiency in mature leaves. Therefore, Bk2L3 functions in tissue growth and cell wall development, and this work elucidates a unique connection between cellulose deposition in the phloem and whole-plant carbohydrate partitioning.\n\nMutations in Bk2L3 result in dwarfed plants with decreased anisotropic cell growth, cellulose deposition, phloem pressure, sucrose export, and carbohydrate hyperaccumulation in mature maize leaves.\n\nIntroduction\n\nMany products used by society, from clothing to food to alternative energy sources, are harvested from various crops and vegetation. These resources are the result of carbohydrate partitioning, the transport of carbohydrates synthesized in photosynthetic source tissues (i.e. leaves) to various nonphotosynthetic sink tissues (e.g. roots, reproductive organs, stem) for proper growth, development, and yield (Lalonde et al., 2003; Braun et al., 2014; Julius et al., 2017). In maize (Zea mays) and other crops, sucrose (Suc) is synthesized in the mesophyll cells of source leaves and transported to the phloem, the vascular tissue responsible for long-distance transport of assimilates (van Bel, 2003; Braun and Slewinski, 2009; Ayre, 2011). The phloem is primarily composed of three cell types: phloem parenchyma cells, companion cells, and sieve elements. The latter two cell types are found in complexes as the sieve elements are enucleate and rely on associated companion cells for metabolic support (Esau, 1977; van Bel and Knoblauch, 2000). Suc is transported from the mesophyll to the bundle sheath cells and on into the phloem parenchyma cells via cell wall-spanning cytoplasmic connections called plasmodesmata (Evert, 1982). In maize, plasmodesmata are rare at the interface of the bundle sheath or phloem parenchyma cells and companion cell–sieve element complex (Evert et al., 1978). Therefore, Suc is effluxed into the apoplastic cell wall space from these cell types by SWEET proteins and imported into the companion cell by the SUCROSE TRANSPORTER1 protein (Slewinski et al., 2009; Baker et al., 2016; Bezrutczyk et al., 2018, 2021). Suc undergoes symplastic transport via plasmodesmata from the companion cell into the sieve element (Evert, 1982).\n\nIn grass leaves, there are two types of sieve elements, thin-walled and thick-walled, which have distinct functions in long-distance assimilate transport and can be distinguished based on their position within a vein and the thickness of their cell walls (Botha, 2005). In plants, sieve elements are connected end-to-end by porous sieve plates forming a sieve tube, a transport path throughout the plant allowing for assimilate export from source leaf tissue to various sink organs (Esau, 1977; Evert, 1982). Suc, potassium, chloride, amino acids, and other compounds are translocated from source to sink tissues in the phloem sap and generate a very high osmolarity (>1.6–2.3 M; Ohshima et al., 1990; Weiner et al., 1991). The high Suc and other osmolyte concentrations in the source leaf phloem attract water from the nearby xylem to create a high hydrostatic pressure (M�nch, 1930). Conversely, Suc unloading from the phloem in sink tissues decreases the osmolyte concentration and results in lower hydrostatic pressure. The difference in pressure between source and sink tissues drives bulk flow through the phloem (van Bel, 2003).\n\nSeveral genes in maize have been characterized to influence carbohydrate partitioning, and when mutated exhibit a suite of phenotypes such as decreased plant growth, chlorotic leaves, and reduced fertility, all associated with hyperaccumulation of carbohydrates in leaves. The mutants can be classified into three groups: (1) psychedelic (psc), tie-dyed1 (tdy1), tdy2, and carbohydrate partitioning defective33 (cpd33), in which the causes of inhibited carbohydrate transport are unknown, although the Tdy and Cpd33 loci are hypothesized to function in companion cell-sieve element plasmodesmata transport (Baker and Braun, 2008; Ma et al., 2008, 2009; Slewinski and Braun, 2010; Slewinski et al., 2012; Baker et al., 2013; Tran et al., 2019), (2) sucrose transporter1 (sut1), sut2, and the triple mutant sweet13a, b, and c, the wild-type versions of each encode proteins that function as Suc transporters (Carpaneto et al., 2005; Slewinski et al., 2010; Baker et al., 2016; Leach et al., 2017; Bezrutczyk et al., 2018), and (3) sucrose export defective1 (sxd1) and Carbohydrate partitioning defective1 (Cpd1), which exhibit ectopic callose deposits that block Suc movement at various points along its transport pathway (Russin et al., 1996; Julius et al., 2018). These mutants are all impaired in their ability to export carbohydrates from their source tissue, resulting in their respective shared phenotypes, despite different underlying mechanistic defects among the three groups of mutants.\n\nA major part of the Suc imported into growing sink tissues is converted into carbon skeletons that provide the building materials for new cells, including the cell wall, a heterogeneous polysaccharide matrix surrounding the cell (Ruan, 2014; Liepman et al., 2018; Rui and Dinneny, 2020). Additionally, significant differences have been found between the composition of cell walls of eudicots, noncommelinoid monocots, and gymnosperms (Type I) compared with grasses (Type II; Carpita and Gibeaut, 1993). Both Types I and II cell walls contain cellulose; however, in Type I walls, cellulose is found in a network of mostly xyloglucan, pectin, and structural proteins, whereas in Type II walls, the cellulose is networked with mostly glucuronoarabinoxylans and low levels of pectin and structural proteins. Cellulose is a major component of both primary cell walls, which control the anisotropic growth of cells, and secondary cell walls, which are deposited upon the completion of cell elongation and are crucial for structural support of the plant tissue (Carpita, 1996). Cellulose is synthesized at the plasma membrane by cellulose synthase ‘rosette’ complexes (Giddings Jr et al., 1980; Mueller and Brown Jr, 1980). These complexes are composed of several distinct cellulose synthase isoforms, sub-functionalized for the deposition of cellulose in primary or secondary cell walls (Taylor et al., 2003; Appenzeller et al., 2004).\n\nAdditional proteins are required for proper cellulose synthesis and orientation, such as the COBRA proteins (Schindelman et al., 2001). The COBRA family was first identified in Arabidopsis thaliana with the characterization of the cobra mutant that exhibited abnormal root growth (Benfey et al., 1993). Several additional gene family members have been characterized in Arabidopsis, maize, rice (Oryza sativa), cotton (Gossypium hirsutum), and tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), affecting plant height, leaf, and stem brittleness, and the development of root hairs, seed coat, pollen, and cotton fiber cells (Hochholdinger et al., 2008; Cao et al., 2012; Li et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2013; Ben-Tov et al., 2015; Niu et al., 2015). For example, Brittle Stalk2 (Bk2) was the first COBRA family member to be identified in maize (Ching et al., 2006; Sindhu et al., 2007), and was proposed to function in lignin-cellulose patterning required for proper secondary cell wall development and tissue flexibility at maturity (Sindhu et al., 2007). In most cases, COBRA gene family mutants exhibited decreased cellulose content (Roudier et al., 2002; Li et al., 2003; Brown et al., 2005; Sindhu et al., 2007; Dai et al., 2011), while overexpression of COBRA in tomato exhibited increased cellulose levels (Cao et al., 2012). COBRA proteins contain four conserved domains: an N-terminal protein targeting domain, a carbohydrate-binding motif, a conserved CCVS domain of unknown function, and a hydrophobic C-terminal tail domain. Both the N-terminal domain and the hydrophobic C-terminal domain are cleaved as post-translational modifications, and a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor is attached at the C-terminal end of the protein after cleavage at the ω-residue (Roudier et al., 2002; Brady et al., 2007). The GPI anchor integrates into the plasma membrane with the remaining peptide sequence located in the apoplast (Eisenhaber et al., 2003). The carbohydrate-binding motif binds cellulose, and disruption of this domain inhibits proper function of COBRA family members (Sato et al., 2010). To date, COBRA mutants have no reported carbohydrate export defects.\n\nIn this article, we determined that the allelic carbohydrate partitioning defective28 (cpd28) and cpd47 mutations occur in the maize Brittle stalk2-like3 (Bk2L3) gene. Bk2L3 is a COBRA gene and functions in cellulose deposition, affecting the ultrastructure of the sieve element cell wall, and carbohydrate partitioning. This research demonstrates the physiological importance of proper phloem cell wall formation on whole-plant carbohydrate partitioning.\n\nResults\n\ncpd28 and cpd47 mutants are dwarfed and exhibit reduced photosynthesis\n\nThe cpd28 and cpd47 mutants were identified from an ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS)-mutagenized population based on a suite of phenotypes, including reduced plant height, chlorosis, and anthocyanin accumulation in the leaves (Supplemental Figure S1). Initially, as leaves develop and emerge from the whorl they appear healthy and normal, with the chlorosis and anthocyanin accumulation developing in a basipetal pattern with continuing exposure to sunlight (Supplemental Figure S1, B and C). Based on Mendelian segregation ratios, both cpd28 and cpd47 were determined to be recessive mutants segregating in a 1:3 ratio for mutant to wild-type plants. Due to the similarity in phenotype between the two mutants, heterozygous plants carrying either allele were crossed together, and the resulting offspring segregated the phenotype in a 1:3 mutant to wild-type ratio, supporting that the two mutations are allelic.\n\nBecause of the chlorosis in mutant leaves, measurements were taken to determine the differences in photosynthetic parameters between the wild-type and mutant siblings. Both the photosynthetic rate and stomatal conductance were dramatically decreased in the cpd28 and cpd47 individuals relative to the wild-type (Supplemental Figure S2).\n\ncpd28 and cpd47 mutants hyperaccumulate carbohydrates in their leaves\n\nThe decreased plant height, leaf chlorosis, anthocyanin accumulation, and reduced gas exchange in the cpd28 and cpd47 mutants were similar to phenotypes observed in other mutants exhibiting defects in carbohydrate export from their leaves (see “Introduction”). Therefore, mature cpd28 and cpd47 mutants, and their respective wild-type sibling leaves were harvested at the end of night, cleared of photosynthetic pigments, and stained with iodine potassium iodide (IKI) for the presence of starch. Both mutants exhibited hyperaccumulation of starch relative to their wild-type siblings (Supplemental Figure S3, A and B).\n\nAdditionally, quantitative measurements showed that cpd28 and cpd47 mature leaves exhibited significantly increased levels of starch, Suc, glucose (Glc), and fructose (Fru) relative to wild-type samples (Supplemental Figure S3C and Supplemental Data Set S1). To establish if the increased soluble sugars and starch in cpd28 mutant leaves impacted water relations of the plant, we measured the water potential (ΨW) and the osmotic potential (ΨS) of mature leaves, and in leaves transitioning from sink to source tissue of both cpd28 mutants and wild-type siblings. While neither mature nor transitioning leaves of cpd28 mutants exhibited a statistically different ΨW from their respective wild-type sibling leaves (Supplemental Data Set S1), ΨS of cpd28 mature leaves was enhanced by 55% (Supplemental Data Set S1, −2.28 MPa in cpd28 mutants compared to −1.46 MPa in the wild-type). This change in ΨS, coupled with the lack of significant alteration of ΨW, resulted in an over two-fold increase of turgor pressure (ΨP) in cpd28 mature leaves (Supplemental Data Set S1). Taken together, these results demonstrated that cpd28 and cpd47 mutants have increased carbohydrate accumulation in their leaves, which we hypothesized was due to decreased Suc export from source leaves.\n\nMutant leaves exhibit decreased Suc export\n\nTo assess long-distance Suc export from leaves, 14C-labeled Suc was applied to recently matured source leaves on 5-week-old plants (cpd28 and cpd47 mutants and their wild-type respective siblings) and allowed to translocate for 1 h. We performed the experiment using the most recently matured, fully expanded source leaf of each plant, which was prior to the appearance of chlorosis and anthocyanin accumulation. The radiolabel was transported to the base of the mature wild-type leaf (Supplemental Figure S3, D and E and Supplemental Data Set S1). However, the transport of radiolabel was severely limited in cpd28 and cpd47 plants, and no signal was seen in the basal half of the leaves. When the radioactivity in the images was quantified, a significant reduction in the amount of radiolabel was detected basipetally beginning 10–12 cm from the application site in each mutant compared to wild-type siblings (Supplemental Figure S3F and Supplemental Data Set S1). These data indicate that the hyperaccumulation of carbohydrates in the cpd28 and cpd47 mature leaves is a result of decreased Suc export.\n\nCarbohydrate hyperaccumulation is associated with ectopic callose deposits in phloem of strongly expressing mutant leaves, but not etiolated or transitioning leaves\n\nVeins of cpd28 and cpd47 mutants and wild-type sibling leaves were analyzed to determine if there were any abnormalities in regards to anatomy or ectopic deposition of callose potentially causing the inhibited transport of Suc as seen in the Cpd1 mutant (Julius et al., 2018). Cross sections from the tip of mature leaves displaying anthocyanins (strong and pronounced phenotypic expression) of cpd28 and cpd47 mutants were stained with aniline blue and showed callose deposition in the phloem of both mutants but not in wild-type siblings (Supplemental Figure S4, A–F).\n\nTo address whether these deposits might be the cause of the decreased Suc export in the mature leaves, cpd28, cpd47, and their wild-type siblings were grown for 2 weeks under etiolated conditions, which precludes photosynthesis, carbon assimilation, and hence carbohydrate hyperaccumulation in the leaves. Cross-sections stained with aniline blue exhibited no ectopic callose deposits in the phloem of etiolated tissue, or that of light-grown nonphotosynthetic immature leaves (Supplemental Figure S4, G–L). Therefore, we suggest that the ectopic callose deposition observed in the mature phloem of the two mutants grown in field conditions are likely downstream effects of the hyperaccumulation of carbohydrates, and not the cause of the increased carbohydrate levels.\n\ncpd28 and cpd47 exhibit allelic differences in regards to growth\n\nThe cpd28 etiolated seedlings exhibited a severe reduction in growth compared to cpd47 and their wild-type siblings ( ). Shoots and roots of both mutants were significantly shorter than the wild-type (Supplemental Data Set S1). The reductions in root growth of the etiolated cpd28 plants were particularly striking compared to those of the wild-type or cpd47 ( ). Consistent with the etiolated shoot data, cpd28 mutant plants had an average root length ∼6 cm shorter than their wild-type siblings, and cpd47 plants had an average root length ∼2.5 cm shorter than their wild-type siblings (Supplemental Data Set S1). Therefore, both cpd28 and cpd47 mutants have growth defects in addition to their carbohydrate partitioning phenotype, with cpd28 being the more severe allele. To determine if the reduced growth was due to decreased carbon mobilization from kernel carbohydrate reserves, we grew seedlings on media supplemented with Suc. The addition of 2% Suc to half-strength Murashige and Skoog (MS) media did not increase root growth of cpd28 mutants, indicating that carbohydrate availability is not limiting growth in the mutants (Supplemental Figure S5).\n\nTo determine the cause of the decreased root length relative to wild-type siblings, cortical cell length and width measurements were performed in 1 mm intervals of primary root tip median longitudinal sections from cpd28 mutants and wild-type siblings. There was no difference in cell length and width profiles within the first 2 mm, consisting of the meristematic zone of the primary root (Sharp et al., 1988). However, cpd28 cells were shorter and wider than the cells observed in wild-type siblings at every site distal to >2 mm from the root cap in the primary root (Supplemental Data Set S1). The inhibition in anisotropic cell elongation begins where cells transition from the meristematic zone to the elongation zone in the root tissue (Sharp et al., 1988). In addition to decreased cell length, there was a significant decrease in cell number in the first 1 mm of cpd28 mutant root apices compared to the wild-type (Supplemental Data Set S1), which also contributes to the shorter roots in the mutant.\n\nTo investigate if a similar growth retardation might underlie the reduced shoot growth phenotype, we measured mesophyll cell size in immature, transitioning, and fully mature leaves. No difference in mesophyll cell size was observed between the wild-type and cpd28 mutants in immature leaves, but cpd28 mesophyll cells were 30%–40% smaller than in the wild-type in the transitioning sink and mature leaves (Supplemental Figure S6 and Supplemental Data Set S1).\n\ncpd28 and cpd47 mutations occur in Brittle Stalk2-Like3\n\nTo understand the molecular mechanism for the inhibited carbohydrate transport and dwarf phenotypes, we employed a bulked segregant analysis (BSA) to map the mutations to the tip of the long arm of chromosome one. The region was further narrowed with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) markers to a ∼750-kb region, containing 17 predicted protein-encoding genes. To identify the causative mutations for each allele, a whole genome sequencing approach was utilized with DNA isolated from independent pools of >40 mutant plants for each allele. DNA sequences of cpd28 and cpd47 were aligned with the B73 reference genome sequence in the region of interest to identify any mutations in the 17 genes. A comparison of polymorphisms between the cpd28 and the cpd47 sequences resulted in the identification of a single gene, Brittle Stalk2-like3 (Bk2L3), with unique mutations in both.\n\nBk2L3 is one of nine members of the maize COBRA gene family (Brady et al., 2007). The cpd28 mutation is a single nucleotide polymorphism resulting in a nonsynonymous (missense) amino acid substitution in the first amino acid, changing it from Met to Ile, and therefore resulting in the loss of the start codon, with the next start codon located 30 amino acids downstream and out of frame, resulting in a nonfunctional protein, if translated ( ). The cpd47 mutation is a base pair change, resulting in a missense mutation in amino acid 103, changing a conserved Asp to Asn creating a novel, predicted N-glycosylation site at the end of the carbohydrate binding motif (Supplemental Figure S7). Therefore, we conclude that the cpd28 allele is likely a null allele, and cpd47 is a hypomorphic allele.\n\nBK2L3 localizes to the plasma membrane\n\nPrevious studies localized COBRA proteins to the plasma membrane, anchored there via a GPI attachment (Roudier et al., 2002; Dai et al., 2011). To determine whether BK2L3 also localized to the plasma membrane, the yellow fluorescent protein Citrine was translationally inserted immediately after the predicted N-terminal secretory peptide in the BK2L3 protein, upstream of, and in-frame with, the remaining peptide sequence. Nicotiana benthamiana leaves were co-infiltrated with 35Spro:BK2L3-Citrine ( ) and 35Spro:PIP2a-CFP, a tagged aquaporin protein that localizes to the plasma membrane (Nelson et al., 2007). The fluorescent signals of the BK2L3-Citrine and PIP2a-CFP proteins overlapped, supporting that BK2L3 localizes to the plasma membrane ( ).\n\nBk2L3 is closely related to AtCOBRA and OsBC1L4\n\nSeveral members of the COBRA family have been characterized in Arabidopsis, cotton, tomato, rice, and maize. Phylogenetic analysis separates the protein family into five clades based upon the length of peptide sequences and function. COBRA proteins in clades I–III typically consist of approximately 400–450 amino acids, while members in clades IV and V consist of approximately 675 amino acids ( ; Supplemental Data Set S2). Clade I includes rice BRITTLE CULM1-LIKE4 (OsBC1L4) and AtCOBRA, which function in the development of primary cell walls, and each exhibits a dwarf phenotype when mutated (Schindelman et al., 2001; Roudier et al., 2002; Zhao et al., 2009; Dai et al., 2011). Similarly, ZmBK2L3 is located in clade I, and etiolated cpd28 and cpd47 mutant seedlings also exhibit diminished growth phenotypes ( ). Interestingly, AtCOBRA, OsBC1L4, and ZmBK2L3 are co-expressed with primary cell wall cellulose synthases (Dhugga, 2001; Appenzeller et al., 2004; Brady et al., 2007). Clade II contains the COBRA proteins OsBC1, ZmBK2, and AtCOBL4, which have all been characterized as playing important roles in secondary cell wall development (Li et al., 2003; Brown et al., 2005; Sindhu et al., 2007; Liu et al., 2013). Nonstructural carbohydrate levels were quantified in the maize bk2 mutant leaves, but no differences were found in soluble sugars relative to the wild-type, although starch levels were decreased (Supplemental Figure S8 and Supplemental Data Set S1). Bk2L3 shows peak relative RNA expression early in organ development, particularly in elongating tissues compared with Bk2, which is expressed later in tissue development during secondary cell wall formation (Supplemental Figure S9; Brady et al., 2007; Walley et al., 2016). Bk2L3 is broadly expressed in numerous tissues throughout the plant, including primary roots, lateral roots, lateral root tip meristems, nodal root meristems, young leaves, elongating internodes, pulvinus, developing tassels, anthers, immature ears, expanding silks, developing embryos and endosperms, and maternal pericarp tissues, and it is often expressed at the highest level among maize COBRA family members (Brady et al., 2007).This broad pattern of gene expression is consistent with a role for BK2L3 in primary cell wall biosynthesis in multiple tissues (Li et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2014).\n\nbk2l3 mutants exhibit cellulose deficiencies and ultrastructural perturbations in mature leaves\n\nTo evaluate whether a classical cobra mutant cell wall phenotype underlies the observed carbohydrate partitioning-defective phenotype in cpd28 and cpd47, cellulosic and noncellulosic cell wall sugars in immature sink and mature source leaves of both mutant plants and their respective wild-type siblings were quantified. Cell walls were isolated and digested in 2 M trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) to separate TFA-labile sugar moieties derived from noncellulosic polysaccharides from acid-resistant cellulose and lignin polymers. Immature sink leaf cell wall composition was broadly similar between mutant and wild-type siblings for both mutants (Supplemental Table S2 and Supplemental Data Set S1). However, alterations in cell wall composition were apparent in mature tissues between mutant and wild-type leaves (Supplemental Table S2 and Supplemental Data Set S1). A significant reduction in cellulose per unit dry mass was seen for both cpd28 and cpd47 mutants relative to the wild-type (Supplemental Data Set S1). Interestingly, a stronger reduction was observed for cpd28 than cpd47 (17% and 14%, respectively; Supplemental Data Set S1), consistent with the above growth data, indicating that cpd28 is the more severe mutant allele. Minor, but consistent pleiotropic decreases in the amounts of xylose and galactose, and minor increases in arabinose, were found for both mutant tissues, suggesting slight changes to arabinoxylan and pectin composition (Supplemental Table S2 and Supplemental Data Set S1). These results indicate that, whereas developing sink leaves exhibit comparable cellulose levels to the wild-type, Bk2L3 function is required for normal levels of cellulose deposition in mature source leaves.\n\nTo examine cellulose abundance at the cellular level, fixed mature and immature leaves were embedded, sectioned, and stained with Direct Red 23, which binds cellulose and fluoresces red (Thomas et al., 2017). Qualitative inspection of mature tissues showed a marked decrease in red fluorescence in cpd28 mature leaves compared to those in wild-type siblings, whereas there were no apparent differences between immature leaves from mutant and wild-type plants ( ). To quantify these results, ImageJ analysis of fluorescence intensity of the cell walls from phloem, xylem, and epidermal tissues was performed. In immature cpd28 mutant leaves, a modest reduction of 11% was observed in cellulose fluorescence of the epidermis, with no significant differences in either phloem or xylem cellulose staining, compared with the wild-type (Supplemental Data Set S1). However, in mature leaves, cpd28 mutants exhibited approximately 26%–48% reduction in cellulose staining in all three tissues in comparison with the wild-type (Supplemental Data Set S1). These data suggest that BK2L3 is required for normal cellulose deposition in phloem, xylem, and epidermal tissues, and loss of function of the gene significantly reduces cellulose abundance in the vasculature and epidermis of mature leaves.\n\nSieve element cell walls must resist the high turgor pressure caused by the high osmolarity of phloem sap. Hence, the changes in cell wall composition, in particular the reduction of cellulose in the phloem cell walls, suggest a possible explanation for the carbohydrate export defect in bk2l3 mutants. To test this hypothesis, we employed transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to examine the ultrastructure of wild-type leaves and cpd28 mutant tissues exhibiting reduced cellulose. We observed an unusual feature in the cell walls of both the thin-walled sieve tubes ( ) and the thick-walled sieve tubes (Supplemental Figure S11, A–H) of cpd28 mutant source leaves, which were not evident in cell walls of corresponding wild-type sieve tubes. While mature wild-type sieve tube cell walls from source leaves appeared smooth at the inner (plasma membrane-facing) side, in cpd28 mutants, mature sieve tube cells exhibited a ruffled or fuzzy appearance along the plasma membrane interface ( ). Cell walls of sieve tubes of immature wild-type leaves ( ; Supplemental Figure S11, B and D) appeared smooth and continuous (Evert, 1977), while sieve tubes of cpd28 mutant immature tissue exhibited a less uniform, grain-like organization, with globular puncta sometimes observable throughout the wall ( ; Supplemental Figure S11, F and H), which were never observed in corresponding wild-type cell walls. We also observed an irregular cell wall morphology in epidermal cell walls of immature mutant leaf tissue (Supplemental Figure S11, I and J), including a similar lack of a smooth cell wall surface in the mutant as was observed in the phloem.\n\ncpd28 exhibits decreased phloem pressure in mature leaves\n\nThe cpd28 and cpd47 mutations produce plants with reduced cellulose in mature leaves and altered sieve tube cell wall architecture, which might be responsible for hyperaccumulation of nonstructural carbohydrates in their leaves because of decreased ability to export photosynthates from source-to-sink. Thus, decreased structural integrity of the sieve element cell wall because of deficiencies in cellulose deposition might compromise the ability of the sieve tube to withstand the high turgor pressure levels needed to drive bulk-transport of photosynthates, as outlined in the pressure-flow hypothesis (M�nch, 1930). To test this hypothesis, phloem pressure measurements were performed on cpd28 mutant and wild-type mature source leaves. The cpd28 phloem sieve tubes exhibit significantly decreased phloem pressure levels relative to their wild-type siblings (Supplemental Data Set S1). Collectively, our data suggest that the impaired carbohydrate partitioning in the cpd28 and cpd47 mutants is due, at least partly, to structurally impaired sieve element cell walls with decreased cellulose content being incapable of withstanding the high turgor pressure needed for proper photoassimilate bulk flow from source tissues.\n\nTable 1\n\nGenotypePhloem pressure (MPa)SEP-valueWT0.7520.0680.035* cpd28 0.5170.077\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe cpd28 and cpd47 mutant alleles display a suite of phenotypes similar to other previously characterized mutants inhibited in their carbohydrate transport, such as decreased plant height and vigor, anthocyanin accumulation, and chlorosis of mature source leaves (Lalonde et al., 2003; Baker and Braun, 2008; Braun and Slewinski, 2009; Ayre, 2011). Starch and soluble sugar quantifications and 14C-Suc transport studies suggest cpd28 and cpd47 mutants hyperaccumulate carbohydrates due to decreased Suc export from the mature source leaves. The observed chlorosis and reduced photosynthetic measurements in the mutant plants likely result from high Glc and/or Suc levels in the leaves, which are known to downregulate photosynthetic gene expression (Rolland et al., 2006; Ruan, 2014). The cpd28 and cpd47 mutants also exhibited dwarf phenotypes when grown in dark conditions, likely resulting from decreased anisotropic cell elongation, with the effect being more severe in cpd28 than in cpd47. In addition, cpd28 mutant mature leaves exhibited a ∼17% reduction in cellulose compared to wild-type siblings, and Direct Red 23 staining also showed that phloem and xylem tissues contained significantly less cellulose in cpd28 mature leaves compared with wild-type siblings. Consistent with the differences in phenotypic severity, the cpd28 mutation is a predicted null allele resulting from the loss of the start codon in the Bk2L3 gene. However, the cpd47 mutation results in a missense mutation leading to an Asp to Asn substitution immediately following the carbohydrate binding motif, resulting in an additional predicted N-glycosylation site. COBRA proteins are N-glycosylated, and in rice the carbohydrate binding motif is crucial for proper function of the COBRA BC1 gene (Sato et al., 2010; Liu et al., 2013). Therefore, we suggest that the cpd47 mutation is a hypomorphic allele.\n\nPrevious characterization of other maize mutants which hyperaccumulate nonstructural carbohydrates in their leaves identified three different biological processes involved in the export of Suc from source tissue, namely diminished symplastic transport between companion cells and sieve elements in mature leaves (Braun et al., 2006; Baker and Braun, 2008; Ma et al., 2009; Baker et al., 2013; Tran et al., 2019), reduced apoplastic Suc phloem loading by SWEET13s and SUT1 (Slewinski et al., 2009, 2010; Baker et al., 2016; Bezrutczyk et al., 2018), and ectopic callose formation blocking sieve tubes or specific cell wall interfaces (Russin et al., 1996; Julius et al., 2018). Our characterization of mutants in the Bk2L3 gene (cpd28 and cpd47) demonstrates that the proper formation of the primary cell wall, in particular cellulose deposition in phloem tissues, is also essential for long-distance carbohydrate partitioning.\n\nOf the currently characterized COBRA genes, none has been reported to have a carbohydrate export defect. However, in addition to the dwarfed phenotype and decreased stem cellulose, rice osbc1l4 mutants exhibited increased levels of starch in their stems relative to wild-type siblings (Dai et al., 2011). The authors suggested the starch accumulation was due to the inability to incorporate sugars into cell wall components, resulting in the unincorporated Glc being converted to starch. Additionally, in the Arabidopsis null mutant cell elongation defect1 (corresponding to the Atcobra-5 and Atcobra-6 alleles), anthocyanin accumulated in aerial tissues, and callose deposition was observed in mutant leaves (Ko et al., 2006). These phenotypes are similar to those observed in cpd28 and cpd47 mutants in maize. While there were no reports of increased carbohydrate levels in the cobra mutants, defense-related genes were upregulated in cob-5 and cob-6 compared to wild-type siblings (Ko et al., 2006). In other carbohydrate-accumulating mutants, it was reported that increased carbohydrates might prime defense responses (Gebauer et al., 2017; Julius et al., 2018). Hence, future studies are required to determine if either Atcobra or osbc1l4 mutants accumulate carbohydrates in their leaves when grown under high light conditions.\n\nMembers of the COBRA family form five phylogenetic clades, and certain subclades are associated with cellulose biosynthesis during primary or secondary cell wall formation in leaf, stem, root hair, and pollen development (Brady et al., 2007). Bk2 was hypothesized to function in forming proper cellulose–lignin interactions during secondary cell wall synthesis, and mutations resulted in loss of tissue flexibility, causing brittle plants to snap under slight pressure (Sindhu et al., 2007). The bk2 plants reach normal height, and no anthocyanin accumulation or chlorosis was observed in the mature leaves (Sindhu et al., 2007). Additionally, bk2 plants do not hyperaccumulate starch or soluble sugars in their mature source leaves. The bk2 brittle phenotype is not observed in cpd28 and cpd47 mutants. Instead, cpd28 and cpd47 plants are dwarfed compared to wild-type siblings. This observation, along with the reduced anisotropic cell expansion in the cpd28 primary root and reduced expansion of leaf mesophyll cells, suggests that the Bk2L3 gene functions in primary cell wall development in multiple cell and tissue types. In addition, we show here that etiolated bk2l3 mutants display reduced root and shoot lengths compared to their wild-type counterparts, indicating that like Arabidopsis COBRA, BK2L3 plays a role in rapidly expanding organs. Cellulose orientation is required for anisotropic cell expansion in plants (Daher et al., 2018); therefore, improper formation of primary cell walls would inhibit elongation of growing tissues. This was reported in both primary cell wall-acting Atcobra and the osbc1l4 mutant in rice, which both exhibit dwarf phenotypes and are closely related to ZmBk2L3 (Li et al., 2003). Additionally, specific cellulose synthase genes responsible for primary cell wall growth are co-expressed with Bk2L3 in maize gene expression studies (Dhugga, 2001; Appenzeller et al., 2004; Brady et al., 2007).\n\nThe expression profile of Bk2L3 RNA in a developing maize leaf is consistent with expression during both proto- and metaphloem development (Evert et al., 1996; Li et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2014). Thus, the large decrease in cellulose content in mature, fully penetrant source tissue occurs after growth and development have ceased, and is likely a pleiotropic effect similar to that reported in osbc1l4 (Dai et al., 2011). Therefore, we hypothesize that the defects in primary cell wall development in bk2l3 mutants, particularly in the phloem, result in decreased Suc export, and subsequent build-up of carbohydrates, in the mature leaves.\n\nOne hypothesis to link the cell wall defects and growth retardation in the cpd28 and cpd47 mutants with the excess carbohydrate accumulation and resulting leaf phenotypes is that it is the decreased sink demand, e.g. from smaller roots, that results in an abundance of carbohydrate in the source tissue. However, if this hypothesis were true, it would be expected that other maize mutants with similarly diminished sink demand, such as rootless with undetectable meristems1, rootless concerning seminal and crown roots1, rootless1, the defective kernel and embryo lethal classes of mutants, vanishing tassel2, and barren inflorescence2, to name a few, should present similar carbohydrate accumulation phenotypes in their source tissue, which is not the case (Jenkins, 1930; Neuffer et al., 1997; Woll et al., 2005; McSteen et al., 2007; Taramino et al., 2007; Phillips et al., 2011). Furthermore, the carbohydrate partitioning defective phenotypes described in bk2l3 mutants, as well as others with impaired Suc export from source tissues (see “Introduction”), are not observed in mutants with diverse causes for decreased sink demand. Therefore, we suggest that the hypothesis that mutations that result in diminished sink demand result in a carbon hyperaccumulation phenotype in leaves, such as that observed in cpd28 and cpd47 mutants, is unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, the source-to-sink transport of carbohydrates, such as Suc, necessitates a particular cellular physiology to accommodate the high pressures accompanying phloem loading. The pressure-flow hypothesis predicts that high concentrations of sugar and other osmolytes increase phloem hydrostatic pressure in source tissues, thus driving the transport of phloem sap to distant tissue sinks (Knoblauch et al., 2016). To compensate for the increased pressure, phloem cell walls must counteract these forces. Interestingly, recent studies using atomic force microscopy (AFM) found that phloem cell walls were significantly more elastic than that of other cell types in Miscanthus stems (Torode et al., 2018). Using high-resolution AFM to probe sieve element cell walls, the authors observed a spatial distribution of cell wall elasticity, with the highest elasticity observed towards the innermost region of the cell wall. This unique aspect of phloem cell wall physiology may be critical for facilitating high turgor pressures required for long-distance phloem transport, and improper formation of the sieve element cell wall is expected to impair long-distance phloem sap transport (Barratt et al., 2011). In the grasses Triticum aestivum and Aegilops comosa, the innermost, load-bearing layer of both proto- and metaphloem is composed of dense parallel arrays of radially oriented cellulose microfibrils (Eleftheriou and Tsekos, 1982; Eleftheriou, 1987). If the correct formation of this load-bearing wall were impaired, the cells may not appropriately respond to the high turgor pressure required in the mature source phloem needed to drive bulk flow to sink tissues (Lalonde et al., 2003; Patrick, 2012). Our data show reduced cellulose content in cpd28 mutant vasculature, and TEM observations of cpd28 mature and immature mutant leaves indicate that BK2L3 function is required for proper sieve tube cell wall formation, which we interpret as a direct link between primary cell wall formation and Suc export from source leaves via the phloem. Consistent with these observations, phloem pressure measurements of cpd28 mutant and wild-type mature leaves determined that the mutants exhibited significantly decreased phloem pressure, substantiating the hypothesis that cell wall biophysical properties are critical for maintaining Suc export by bulk-flow. Hence, our data support that BK2L3 is critical for proper cellulose deposition and cell wall formation during phloem development, which is necessary to establish and maintain the high phloem turgor pressure in source leaves.\n\nMaterials and methods\n\nPlant materials and growth conditions\n\nMaize (Zea mays L.) plants used for the photosynthetic and gas exchange analyses, microscopy, and soluble sugar and starch quantifications were grown in the field at the University of Missouri South Farm Agricultural Experiment Station in Columbia, MO. The cpd28 and cpd47 mutations were generated through pollen EMS mutagenesis of B73 by Patrick Schnable and Nathan Springer, respectively (Liu et al., 2010). Both mutations were backcrossed to the B73 inbred three or more times prior to analyses.\n\nPlants used for the 14C-Suc transport assays and microscopy were grown in a greenhouse supplemented with a 1:1 mix of metal halide and high-pressure sodium lighting (1,600 �mols m−2 s−1) under 16-h light and 8-h darkness. The plants were kept at a day- and night-time temperature of 30�C and 24�C, respectively. Additionally, etiolated plants used for microscopy and height measurements were grown for 13–15 days under 24-h dark conditions at 22�C. Genomic DNA was extracted from plants and sequenced to genotype cpd28 and cpd47 homozygous mutants, heterozygotes, and homozygous wild-type individuals. A dCAPS assay was developed to allow for easier genotyping of both cpd28 and cpd47 mutant alleles. After PCR amplification, DNA from individuals segregating the cpd28 allele was digested with either HaeIII or AluI restriction enzymes, where the wild-type allele is cut with HaeIII and the cpd28 mutant allele is cut with AluI. Families segregating the cpd47 allele were PCR amplified and digested with HinfI to cut the wild-type allele. All primer sequences are listed in Supplemental Table S1.\n\nNicotiana benthamiana plants used for transient protein localization studies were grown in a growth chamber under 12-h light (700–800 PAR from T5 fluorescent light bulbs) and 12-h dark conditions at 18�C–25�C and 55%–65% relative humidity for 4–5 weeks (Tran and Braun, 2017).\n\nStarch staining\n\nLeaves were cleared and stained with IKI as previously described (Baker and Braun, 2007).\n\n14C-Suc transport studies\n\n14C-Suc was purchased from PerkinElmer (USA) and transport assays were performed on 5-week-old plants as described previously (Tran et al., 2019). N = 4 plants were used for cpd28, cpd47, and wild-type sibling plants, respectively, for each experiment; the experiment was repeated twice.\n\nPhotosynthesis and gas exchange measurements\n\nGas exchange and photosynthesis measurements were performed on mature source leaves of plants grown in the field between 9:00 AM and 12:00 PM using a portable infrared gas exchange system (LI-6400XT, LI-COR Inc., Lincoln, NE, USA) as described (Huang et al., 2009; Bihmidine et al., 2015). Net photosynthesis (Anet, μmol CO2 m−2 s−1) and stomatal conductance (gs, mol H2O m−2 s−1) rates were measured at a photon flux density of 2,000 μmol m−2 s−1 and ambient CO2 concentration of 400 μmol mol−1. N = 5 each for the wild-type, cpd28, and cpd47 plants.\n\nSoluble sugar and starch quantification\n\nSamples of mature source leaf tissue were harvested from field-grown plants at 5:30 AM and immediately placed in liquid nitrogen before being stored at −80�C until measurement. Soluble sugar and starch samples were extracted according to Leach and Braun (2016). Samples were quantified using high-performance anion exchange chromatography against known standards according to Leach et al. (2017). N = 5 each for cpd28, cpd47, and their respective wild-type siblings.\n\nWater relations measurements\n\nWater potentials of leaf tissue were obtained using isopiestic thermocouple psychrometry as described previously (Boyer and Knipling, 1965). Leaf tissue was sampled from mature, pre-anthesis, field grown plants at approximately mid-morning. Osmotic potentials were measured after first measuring water potentials, then freezing tissue overnight at −20�C and remeasuring the following day. To obtain turgor pressure values, obtained values were related using the formula ΨW = ΨS + ΨP, in effect subtracting the osmotic potential value from the water potential value of a given sample. The experiment was performed twice, and the replicate datasets were determined to be statistically similar by performing a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), which did not find the individual experiment to be a significant factor using the model Tissue_WP ∼ experiment * sample. Data from the two experiments were then pooled for statistical analysis; with N = 7.\n\nRoot growth assay\n\nSeedling root growth was assayed using the growth conditions described (Sharp et al., 1988; Voothuluru et al., 2016). Briefly, 100–150 segregating seeds from a self-fertilized heterozygote were surface-sterilized in 1% NaClO for 15 min, rinsed under running water for 20 min, and treated with 0.1% myclobutanil (Chemsico Inc., St Louis, MO) for 20 min. Seeds were imbibed for 24 h in 1-mM CaSO4 at room temperature with constant aeration, and germinated for 48 h on germination paper moistened with 1-mM CaSO4 at 29�C in darkness. Germinated seedlings with primary root lengths between 0.5 cm and 2 cm were sown in Plexiglas boxes containing well-watered vermiculite moistened to drip-point with 1-mM CaSO4, and grown for 48 h under nontranspiring conditions at 28�C in darkness. Seedlings were removed from the growth medium, primary root axial lengths were measured, and shoot tissue was harvested for genotyping. Seedling roots grew vertically without contacting the bottom of the container for the duration of the growth experiment. The tissue was fixed, embedded, and sectioned as described below for the Direct Red 23 studies. The sections were stained with 0.1% Toluidine Blue O (TBO). N = 19 and 7 for wild-type and cpd28 roots, respectively. N = 48 and 20 for wild-type and cpd47 roots, respectively.\n\nThe mobilization of carbohydrate from germinating kernels was investigated by assaying root growth on large plates (245 � 245 � 25 mm) containing � strength MS media and 2% phytagel (Sigma Aldrich #P8169), pH buffered to 5.7 with or without the addition of 2% Suc. Seeds were sterilized and imbibed as with the vermiculite experiments using sterile solutions, and germinated for 48 h on sterile germination paper moistened with 1-mM CaSO4 at 28�C in darkness. Around 18–22 germinated seedlings of roughly uniform root lengths were transferred to each plate; the plates were sealed with parafilm and kept near vertical for 48 h in darkness at 28�C before measuring root lengths and genotyping each seedling.\n\nRoot cell number, length, and width measurements\n\nAll cell measurements were made using the ImageJ processing and analysis software (imagej.nih.gov/ij/) from composite TIF images of TBO-stained longitudinal sections of the wild-type and cpd28 mutant primary root tips taken on a Zeiss Axiovert 200M motorized widefield microscope. Cell lengths and widths were measured in 1 mm intervals of primary root tip longitudinal sections starting at 1 mm from the root cap junction and ending at 11 mm distal. Between 85 and 160 cells were measured per region per genotype. Due to their small size, the number of cells in the 1–2 mm apical region were counted from six to nine separate cortical cells files in similar positions of each region of each root. Because of their larger size, from 2 to 11 mm from the root cap junction, cell numbers in three cortical cell files were counted. Averages are the grand mean from cells within like regions of like genotypes. Statistical significance was determined by a single factor ANOVA. N = 8 roots per genotype.\n\nMesophyll cell size measurements\n\nThree individual plants (greenhouse grown, V8 stage) from each genotype were measured, with samples collected from developmentally equivalent leaves cut in the same locations on each leaf. The immature tissue was obtained by dissecting the whorl while the transitioning leaf material was sampled at the boundary where an emerging leaf protrudes above the whorl. Fresh issue was hand-sectioned and stained with TBO for visualization of cellular boundaries. Images were collected using the microscope described below, and quantified using ImageJ 1.52. Statistical significance was calculated by one-way ANOVA (P ≤ 0.01) with groupings obtained by Tukey–Kramer post hoc using the R software package.\n\nLight microscopy\n\nAll epi-fluorescence images for each experiment were taken using the same microscope and camera settings using a Nikon Eclipse 80i epifluorescence microscope equipped with a 100-W mercury bulb and a DXM1200F camera. Mature and etiolated leaf tissue free-hand cross-sections were generated and imaged as previously described (Baker et al., 2016). Callose was visualized under UV excitation by staining mature leaf sections with 0.1% (w/v) aniline blue in 0.15 M potassium phosphate buffer (pH 8.2) for 5 min.\n\nFor histological studies of cell walls, field grown mutant and wild-type plants were harvested at the V7 stage and tissue was collected from mature leaves and immature leaves dissected from within the whorl. Samples were prepared as described (Ruzin, 1999); briefly, 2 cm � 2 cm sections of fresh tissue were fixed in a 4% paraformaldehyde solution overnight, followed by dehydration in a graded ethanol series. Tissue was embedded in paraffin blocks and 7-μm sections were cut on a Leica RM2135 microtome. For the cellulose quantification imaging, all slides were processed simultaneously and treated identically. Dewaxed slides were stained in 0.2% (w/v) solution of Direct Red 23 in PBS (equivalent to pontamine fast scarlet 4b, Sigma Aldrich catalog number 212490; Thomas et al., 2017; Aleamotu’a et al., 2018). Slides were stained for 2 min, followed by two 20-min washes in PBS. Slides were mounted in PBS and sealed before imaging. A Leica TCS SP8 confocal microscope system (Leica Microsystems, Germany) was used to collect confocal images, using 561 nm excitation and detection between 580 and 615 nm with a 60� water immersion objective. For all collected images, microscope settings used were identical; pinhole was held at 0.75 AU throughout and laser power was kept at 30%. Fluorescence signal was quantified using ImageJ 1.52. Fluorescence intensity values were obtained by selecting individual pixels from the center of the cell wall; at least 100 such individual measurements were obtained for any one tissue measurement (see Supplemental Table S3 and Supplemental Figure S10). Values were normalized by subtracting the mean value of background fluorescence from that same image, which was always close to zero. Data were analyzed for normality and statistical significance was calculated by one-way ANOVA using the R software package.\n\nElectron microscopy\n\nTissue samples were collected from greenhouse-grown wild-type and cpd28 mutant siblings at approximately the V10 stage (auricles visible on 10th produced leaf). Mature leaf samples were collected at mid-leaf from the youngest fully expanded leaves. The immature leaf samples were collected from the partially emerged leaves 15 and 16, which were dissected from the whorl. The sampled immature leaves had a mean length of 39.4 � 8.8 cm emerged from the whorl, and 25.3 � 4 cm not yet emerged from the whorl. Immature leaf samples were collected at the approximate midway portion of the leaf still unemerged from the whorl, 11.5 cm from the base of the leaf. Once cut, tissue samples were immediately processed for TEM. Unless otherwise stated, all reagents were purchased from Electron Microscopy Sciences and all specimens were prepared at the Electron Microscopy Core Facility, University of Missouri. Tissues were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde, 2% glutaraldehyde in 100-mM sodium cacodylate buffer pH = 7.35. Next, fixed tissues were rinsed with 100-mM sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.35 containing 130-mM Suc. Secondary fixation was performed using 1% osmium tetroxide (Ted Pella, Inc., Redding, CA) in cacodylate buffer using a Pelco Biowave (Ted Pella, Inc. Redding, California) operated at 100 W for 1 min. Specimens were next incubated at 4�C for 1 h, then rinsed with cacodylate buffer and further with distilled water. En bloc staining was performed using 1% aqueous uranyl acetate and samples were incubated at 4�C overnight, then rinsed with distilled water. A graded dehydration series was performed using ethanol, transitioned into acetone, and dehydrated tissues were then infiltrated with a 1v/1v of Epon and Spurr resin for 24 h at room temperature and polymerized at 60�C overnight. Sections were cut to a thickness of 75 nm using an ultramicrotome (Ultracut UCT, Leica Microsystems, Germany) and a diamond knife (Diatome, Hatfield, PA). Thin sections were stained using Reynold’s Lead Citrate. Images were acquired with a JEOL JEM 1400 transmission electron microscope (JEOL, Peabody, MA) at 80 kV on a Gatan Ultrascan 1000 CCD (Gatan, Inc., Pleasanton, CA).\n\nSubcellular localization assays\n\nThe coding sequence for the pH insensitive Citrine fluorescent protein was inserted in the coding sequence of the BK2L3 protein (Zm00001d034049) immediately after the N-terminal secretory peptide domain and synthesized in the pDONOR221 vector (Life Technologies, USA; Tian et al., 2004). The BK2L3-Citrine construct was recombined into the pEarleyGate100 vector generating the 35Spro:BK2L3-Citrine translation fusion protein. Agrobacterium tumefaciens transformation and N. benthamiana leaf infiltration were performed as described (Tran et al., 2019). A Leica TCS SP8 confocal microscope system was used for imaging. All microscope and camera settings used were identical across samples within an experiment and imaging was performed as previously described (Baker et al., 2016).\n\nMapping and whole genome sequencing\n\nMapping population generation, BSA, fine mapping, and whole-genome sequencing were performed as described previously (Settles et al., 2014; Tran et al., 2019). To identify the mutations, the sequences were aligned to the B73 reference genome version 4. The fine mapping population consisted of 127 mutant and 298 wild-type plants. Sequences of mapping markers can be found in Supplemental Table S1.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis\n\nA phylogenetic relationship was constructed of the COBRA protein families from A. thaliana, Zea mays, O. sativa, S. lycopersicum, and Gossypium raimondi. Accessions were obtained through BLASTP in Phytozome using the Arabidopsis COBRA proteins. The settings for the BLASTP analysis were as follows: an E threshold of 0.001, BLOSUM62 comparison matrix, and gaps allowed. Once the COBRA family members were identified for each taxa, an alignment was generated using default parameters with MUSCLE (Edgar 2004). The output FASTA alignment was curated using Gblocks to exclude noninformative sites using the default parameters for protein alignments (Castresana 2000). The resulting curated FASTA alignment was submitted into the maximum likelihood method PhyML to generate the phylogeny in MEGA6 (Tamura et al., 2013). Statistical analysis was based on the approximate likelihood-ratio test (Guindon et al., 2010). In visualizing the final unrooted phylogenetic tree, the placement of proteins reflects their sequence similarity, with the lengths of the branches arranged for maximal readability.\n\nCell wall isolation and compositional analyses\n\nCell walls were isolated from mutant and wild-type sibling plants as described (Mertz et al., 2012). Briefly, N = 6 200–500 mg samples of frozen leaf tissue from field-grown immature sink and mature source leaves pooled from three to six individual isogenic sibling plants were harvested at 5:30 AM was weighed, ground with a mortar and pestle under liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80�C until all samples were processed. Frozen powder was suspended in ∼10 mL of 50-mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.2 containing 1% v/v sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS), and homogenized in a 30-mL glass-glass Duall tissue homogenizer (DWK Life Sciences, Rockwood, TN). The homogenate was pelleted at 2,000g for 5 min and the supernatant was replaced with fresh buffer and heated to 65�C for 20 min to extract soluble proteins. Walls were pelleted and washed 3� each with warm (50�C) dH2O, warm 50% ethanol, and room temperature dH2O. Isolated walls were resuspended in dH2O with one to two drops of toluene to prevent microbial growth and stored at 4�C. N = 6 each for cpd28, cpd47, and their respective wild-type siblings.\n\nFor quantification of TFA-labile cell wall sugars, 1-mL aliquots of wall suspension were treated with 2 U porcine α-amylase/mg carbohydrate in 10-mM Tris–Malate, pH 6.9 as described in Pettolino et al., (2012) to remove starch that would confound the analysis of cell wall Glc moieties. About 1–2 mg of destarched, lyophilized wall material was hydrolyzed in 2 M TFA containing 500-nmol��L−1myo-inositol for 90 min at 120�C, reduced with NaBH4, and converted to alditol acetates as described (Gibeaut and Carpita, 1991). Derivatized sugars were separated and quantified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry using the parameters described (Mertz et al., 2012).\n\nFor quantification of cellulose by the phenol-sulfuric assay, TFA-insoluble pellets of 4–6 mg lyophilized wall material were recovered following hydrolysis and washed 3� with dH2O in a 5-mL conical Reacti-Vial (Pierce). Triplicate 200 �L aliquots of suspended pellets from each sample were combined with 5% (v/v) phenol and concentrated sulfuric acid, developed for 2 h, and analyzed spectrophotometrically for Glc equivalents at 500, 510, and 520 nm according to Dubois et al. (1956).\n\nPhloem pressure measurements\n\nPico gauge pressure measurements (Knoblauch et al., 2014) were performed on a Leica DM-LFSA equipped with a Leica DC450 digital camera. For in situ phloem pressure measurements, a longitudinal section was removed from the bottom of the main vein (midrib) of a leaf still attached to an intact 8-week-old plant to expose the phloem without damaging it (Supplemental Figure S12). This leaf was mounted on the stage of the microscope on a tilted stage (∼20% tilt). Images were taken with a Leica 63x water immersion lens. Image analysis and pressure calculations were performed as described in detail in Knoblauch et al. (2014). N = 8 for cpd28 mutants and N = 9 for wild-type siblings.\n\nStatistical analysis\n\nAs indicated in the text, and figure and table legends, statistical analyses were performed by ANOVA or using Student’s t tests. See Supplemental Data Set S1 for statistical parameters.\n\nAccession numbers\n\nZm00001d034049BK2L3AT5G60920AtCOBRAOs05g32110OsBC1L4\n\nSupplementary Material\n\nkoab193_Supplementary_Data\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe appreciate the insightful comments of three anonymous reviewers and the editor for suggestions that greatly improved the manuscript.
