        "text": "There was no shortage of drama leading up to the 2023 NHL trade deadline, with more than 30 deals being made over the past week alone.\n\nMost of the big names went off the board ahead of Friday's deadline, including Patrick Kane, Jakob Chychrun, Timo Meier, Ryan O'Reilly and Vladimir Tarasenko, but that doesn't mean there wasn't drama.\n\nHere is a list of every trade along with the biggest news from the 2023 NHL trade deadline.\n\nJames van Riemsdyk deal falls through\n\nJame van Riemsdyk is staying put after all.\n\nSportsnet's Elliotte Friedman reported ahead of the deadline that the Flyers traded van Riemsdyk to the Detroit Red Wings, but the deal fell apart and the veteran winger will play out the final year of his contract in Philadelphia.\n\nVan Riemsdyk was one of the most established players available at the deadline, and reportedly had a number of teams interested in his services, including the Red Wings, Kraken, Golden Knights and Jets. The 33-year-old has nine goals and 23 points in 41 games this season after scoring 24 goals a season ago.\n\nIt was a quiet deadline overall for Flyers GM Chuck Fletcher, who only made a handful of minor transactions despite the team sitting 25th overall in the standings.\n\nWild bolster blue line in deal for John Klingberg\n\nThe Minnesota Wild acquired defenseman John Klingberg from the Anaheim Ducks in exchange for a 2025 fourth-round pick, defenseman Andrej Sustr and the rights to forward prospect Nikita Nesterenko. Anaheim will retain 50 percent of Klingberg's $7 million salary.\n\nKlingberg has taken a big step back this season after betting on himself in free agency last summer and inking a one-year deal with the Ducks. The smooth-skating defenseman has only 24 points in 50 games after racking up 47 in 74 a year ago, although he does have eight goals — just five back of his career high.\n\nThe 30-year-old right-shot defenseman will get one last chance build up his value ahead of free agency this summer on a Wild team currently sitting second in the Central Division.\n\nFlames, Coyotes make first ever brother-for-brother swap\n\nThe Calgary Flames acquired defenseman Troy Stecher and forward Nick Ritchie from the Arizona Coyotes in exchange for forward Brett Ritchie, Nick's brother, and defenseman Connor Mackey. It is the first trade in the NHL database involving brothers being traded for one another.\n\nStecher is the best player in this deal and gives the Flames some much-needed depth on the blue line. The 28-year-old has recorded seven assists in 61 games this season. He carries a $1.25 million cap hit and will be an unrestricted free agent after the season.\n\nNick Ritchie — the younger of the two brothers — has posted nine goals and 21 points in 58 games this season. Brett Ritchie recorded six goals and eight points in 34 games for the Flames. Both are set to hit the open market this summer.\n\nSabres bulk up with trade for Jordan Greenway\n\nThe Buffalo Sabres have reportedly acquired forward Jordan Greenway from the Minnesota Wild in exchange for a 2023 second-round pick and 2024 fifth-round pick.\n\nGreenway is a hulking forward at 6-foot-6 and 231 pounds who can chip in offensively, although he doesn't much of that this season with only two goals and seven points in 45 games. He has hit double digits in goals twice in his career (2021-22 and 2018-19) and topped out at 32 points in 2020-21.\n\nThe 26-year-old is under contract for two more season with a cap hit of $3 million.\n\nPenguins land Dmitry Kulikov from Ducks\n\nThe Pittsburgh Penguins have reportedly acquired defenseman Dmitry Kulikov from the Anaheim Ducks in exchange for forward Brock McGinn and a third-round pick.\n\nKulikov, 32, is a defensive defenseman who is averaging 20:13 of ice time per game on the NHL's worst defensive team. He also has three goals and 15 points on the season and is in the final year of a contract that carries a $2.25 million cap hit.\n\nMcGinn was placed on waivers this week to clear cap space. He makes $2.75 million and has another two years remaining on his contract.\n\nWild acquire Oskar Sundqvist from Red Wings\n\nThe Minnesota Wild have reportedly acquired forward Oskar Sundqvist from the Detroit Red Wings for a 2023 fourth-round pick. The 28-year-old has seven goals and 21 points in 52 games this season. He is in the final year of his contract that carries a $2.75 million cap hit.\n\nJets acquire Vladislav Namestnikov from Sharks\n\nThe Winnipeg Jets have reportedly acquired forward Vladislav Namestnikov from the San Jose Sharks in exchange for a 2025 fourth-round pick.\n\nThis is the second time Namestnikov has been traded this week, as he was shipped from Tampa Bay to San Jose in exchange for Michael Eyssimont on Wednesday.\n\nNamestnikov has six goals and 15 points in 57 games this season. The 30-year-old is making $2.5 million this season and is slated to become an unrestricted free agent. The Sharks retained 50 percent of his salary previously, so Winnipeg is only on the hook for $1.25 million.\n\nBlues take flyer on Jakub Vrana\n\nThe St. Louis Blues acquired forward Jakub Vrana from the Detroit Red Wings in exchange for forward Dylan McLaughlin and a 2025 seventh-round pick.\n\nThe Red Wings will retain 50 percent of Vrana's salary. The 27-year-old winger has one more year on his contract that carries a cap hit of $5.25 million.\n\nA first round pick of the Capitals in 2014, Vrana was placed on waivers by the Red Wings in January shortly after returning from NHL/NHLPA player assistance program, designed to offer players treatment for mental health and substance abuse issues.\n\nHe has appeared in only five games with the Red Wings this seasons, registering a goal and an assist. He had six goals and 11 points in 15 games with the AHL's Grand Rapids Griffins.\n\nPenguins make first move of the day\n\nThe Pittsburgh Penguins kicked off the NHL trade deadline in the middle off the night, reportedly acquiring forward Nick Bonino from the San Jose Sharks.\n\nThe deal was made official later in the afternoon, with the Sharks receiving defenseman Arvid Henriksson, a conditional 2024 fifth-round pick and a 2023 seventh-round pick. The Montreal Canadiens will retain 50 percent of Bonino's contract in exchange for defenseman Tony Sund and a 2024 fifth-round pick.\n\nBonino, who won back-to-back Stanley Cups with Pittsburgh in 2016 and 2017, gives the Penguins some added bottom-six depth. The 34-year-old has 10 goals and 19 points in 59 games this season. He is in the final year of a two-year contract that carries a $2.05-million cap hit.\n\nCompleted 2022-23 NHL trades\n\nThe Minnesota Wild acquired defenseman John Klingberg from the Anaheim Ducks in exchange for a 2025 fourth-round pick, defenseman Andrej Sustr and the rights to forward prospect Nikita Nesterenko.\n\nThe Calgary Flames acquired defenseman Troy Stecher and forward Nick Ritchie from the Arizona Coyotes in exchange for forward Brett Ritchie, Nick's brother, and defenseman Connor Mackey.\n\nThe New York Rangers acquired defenseman Wyatt Kalynuk from the Vancouver Canucks in exchange for future considerations.\n\nThe Chicago Blackhawks acquired forward Austin Wagner from the Los Angeles Kings in exchange for future considerations.\n\nThe Nashville Predators acquired forward Rasmus Asplund from the Buffalo Sabres in exchange for a 2025 seventh-round pick.\n\nThe New York Rangers acquired forward Anton Blidh from the Colorado Avalanche in exchange for forward Gustav Rydahl.\n\nThe Pittsburgh Penguins acquired defensman Dmitry Kulikov (50 percent retained) from the Anaheim Ducks in exchange for forward Brock McGinn and a 2024 third-round pick.\n\nThe Ottawa Senators acquired forward Patrick Brown from the Philadelphia Flyers in exchange for 2023 sixth-round pick.\n\nThe Buffalo Sabres acquired forward Jordan Greenway from the Minnesota Wild in exchange for a 2023 second-round pick and 2024 fifth-round pick.\n\nThe Calgary Flames acquired forward Dryden Hunt from the Toronto Maple Leafs inexchange for forward Radim Zohorna.\n\nThe Minnesota Wild acquired forward Oskar Sundqvist from the Detroit Red Wings for a 2023 fourth-round pick.\n\nThe Buffalo Sabres acquired defenseman Chase Priskie from the Anaheim Ducks in exchange for defenseman Austin Strand.\n\nThe Dallas Stars acquired forward Scott Reedy from the San Jose sharks in exchange for forward Jacob Peterson.\n\nThe Winnipeg Jets acquired forward Vladislav Namestnikov from the San Jose Sharks in exchange for a 2025 fourth-round pick.\n\nThe Pittsburgh Penguins acquired forward Nick Bonino from the San Jose Sharks in exchange for defenseman Arvid Henriksson, a conditional 2024 fifth-round pick and a 2023 seventh-round pick.
