        "text": "In some of the least surprising prospect news of the year, University of Michigan defenseman Luke Hughes will sign with the New Jersey Devils after his season comes to an end, GM Tom FitzGerald said.\n\nDrafted fourth overall in 2021, Hughes is considered to be one of the best prospects in the game right now. The younger brother of Jack and Quinn, Hughes has nine goals and 36 points in 32 games, three points behind Montreal prospect Lane Hutson for the NCAA U-21 defensive scoring lead. Hughes has 75 points in 73 games over his career, and won the Big 10 championship and rookie of the year title last year, as well.\n\nInternationally, Hughes’ four goals were the most at the 2023 World Junior Championship, helping USA win bronze. Hughes was a product of the United States Development Team Program, representing the company at the Under-17 World Hockey Challenge and various U-18 tournaments and played key minutes at the men’s World Hockey Championship last spring.\n\nHughes entered the season as the sixth-ranked prospect ahead of the 2022-23 season by Daily Faceoff. Known for his offensive flair, Hughes is expected to make a big impact on a Devils team that could cause some damage during the 2023 Stanley Cup playoffs.\n\nThe Devils drafted Simon Nemec with the second pick in 2022, and also have Seamus Casey, Kevin Bahl, Topias Vilen and Ethan Edwards, among others. The team traded Shakir Mukhamadullin as part of the deal that gave them Timo Meier last weekend."
