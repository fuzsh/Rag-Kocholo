Quillan on the other hand, I'd tell him I'd sign him and let him play a game this year to start the clock and point to that 3C spot for next season as well as the highly skilled group of wingers he can look forward to playing with moving forward. I mean if I was a 22 year old coming out of NCAA, the Rangers would be pretty high on my list\n\nNYR been very active w drafted college guys who hadn't signed - Gilmour, Vesey, Hayes\n\nbut undrafted college skaters\n\nwho signed first NHL deal w NYR\n\nand had reasonable NHL career\n\ncan't think of too many in recent times...\n\npost-lockout, who besides Pionk? ... and Gilroy (225 games)\n\nthese are guys who came to mind,\n\nlemme know who i forgot\n\nPavelich, McPhee (surprisingly few NHL games at 144 incl PS), Ortmeyer\n\nPionk, Thomas Poeck, Bothwell\n\nYeah, the UDFA signings haven't really worked out aside from Talbot, Pionk, Ortmeyer and Gilroy to a lesser degree.\n\nJustin Richards\n\nPatrick Khodorenko\n\nAustin Rueschhoff\n\nRyan Haggerty\n\nVinni Lettieri\n\nBobby Trivigno\n\nMat Bodie\n\nConor Allen\n\nTommy Grant\n\nPatrick Newell\n\nKyle Jean\n\nNick Jones\n\nAdam Chapie\n\nLewis Zerter-Gossage\n\nAhti Oksanen\n\nJeff Malcolm\n\nChris Nell\n\nSome of these were on AHL deals in Hartford but I remember all these participating in Ranger training camps.\n\nThe thing is, when it comes to UDFAs, the success-rate is low.

And we've had our fair share or them, even from Europe with Ville Meskanen, Michael Lindqvist, Andres Ambühl, Malte Stromwall, Gustav Rydahl, Alexei Bereglazov etc.\n\nthanks for the detailed list\n\na trip thru history for some of us obsessives\n\nOksanen maybe, for me, the most disappointing name on the list,\n\nkey player at BU, was an exciting signing\n\nNA pro didn't work out but he is still producing in SHL\n\nHaggerty situation continues to amuse and amaze me -\n\nwas his career torpedoed by his agent?\n\nor did they know he really wasn't that good ...\n\n(a) Signed w NYR right after RPI was eliminated in first weekend of ECAC playoffs - early March\n\n(b) As signing condition, demanded being with the NHL team, not AHL, and burning an ELC year\n\n(c) That season Hartford had a competitive team and made a deep AHL playoff run\n\n(d) Haggerty could have joined Pack in peak game shape, and had 6-7 weeks to kickstart his pro career\n\nInstead he just practiced with the optional/extra NHL guys,\n\nand when his Pack career finally started, many months later, he didn't distinguish himself\n\nBUT it worked out for NYR, who flipped him to Chicago for a few useful seasons of Raanta\n\nAny chance Rangers sign some dman? They really need to add more young depth that could be another Girardi type. Rangers really dont have another Schneider type in the system, someone in Hartford that is close or is NHL ready to step in. Rangers need to add center, RW and defense depth\n\nWith the signing of Mancini and Siedem the focus on defensemen should be left shooting D. The Rangers have plenty of young wingers but don't have a young right hand shooting winger other than Rempe who is limited. The team really needs center depth especially if Laba does not sign this year. Here are guys from frozen four teams:\n\nBC -- Jacob Bengtsrom, LD\n\nDenver -- Boston Buchburger LD\n\nDenver -- Carter King C\n\nMichigan -- TJ Hughes C/RW\n\nThere are lots of guys like Graf who are available. Too many to name.\n\nThere also are CHL and overseas free agents.\n\nFinally there are some drafted players who may/will not sign with their teams. Two guys to keep an eye on are:\n\nMinnesota -- Bryce Brodzinski RW (The Ranger organization has had the other three Brodzinski brothers in their system. Drafted by Philadelphia\n\nMichigan -- Jacob Truscott LD drafted by Vancouver but announced he is going free agency\n\nTo be fair a number of them did turn into decent organizational pieces, so there's a little bit of value in that. Haggerty was traded for Raanta. A bunch of them also came at a time when we had given all our picks away and had nothing in the system, so giving out ELCs to long shots wasn't a big deal.\n\nI was going to make this point but B17 Apricots beat me to it. You can't fill out an AHL roster without young free agents, particularly when you are like the Rangers and only have 4-5 draft picks a year. The AHL limits the number of veteran free agents that you can play. So even if Bobby Trivigno doesn't make the NHL (which seems likely) he still has been a useful contributor to Hartford.\n\nBrandon Scanlon also is someone who has a chance to be an NHL player. Time will tell. But even if not he has been the defensive rock in Hartford this year.\n\nThese guys are free lottery tickets and they pay off more than the lottery.\n\nYeah, the UDFA signings haven't really worked out aside from Talbot, Pionk, Ortmeyer and Gilroy to a lesser degree.\n\nJustin Richards\n\nPatrick Khodorenko\n\nAustin Rueschhoff\n\nRyan Haggerty\n\nVinni Lettieri\n\nBobby Trivigno\n\nMat Bodie\n\nConor Allen\n\nTommy Grant\n\nPatrick Newell\n\nKyle Jean\n\nNick Jones\n\nAdam Chapie\n\nLewis Zerter-Gossage\n\nAhti Oksanen\n\nJeff Malcolm\n\nChris Nell\n\nSome of these were on AHL deals in Hartford but I remember all these participating in Ranger training camps.\n\nThe thing is, when it comes to UDFAs, the success-rate is low. Even lower than signing free agents who were actually drafted. UDFAs are a long-shot. And we've had our fair share or them, even from Europe with Ville Meskanen, Michael Lindqvist, Andres Ambühl, Malte Stromwall, Gustav Rydahl, Alexei Bereglazov etc.\n\nThey also brought guys to camp like Matt Read, Andrej Sustr, Barclay Goodrow, Nikita Zaitsev, etc. They were either unable to sign those guys or chose not to."
