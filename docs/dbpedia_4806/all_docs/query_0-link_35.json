Enligt uppgifter till SportExpressen har en av guldhjältarna i Färjestad, Gustav Rydahl nu bestämt sig. Han spelar nästa säsong för New York Rangers. – Nej, det kommer sen, säger Rydahl.\n\nGustav Rydahl to the New York Rangers after the Swedish Championship gold\n\nKARLSTAD. The NHL move has been rumored for much of the season.\n\nNow it's ready.\n\nAccording to information to SportExpressen, one of the gold heroes in Färjestad, Gustav Rydahl, has now made up his mind.\n\nHe will play next season for the New York Rangers.\n\n- No, it will come later, says Rydahl.\n\nText Johan Svensson, Hugo Höglund\n\nShare\n\nCopy link\n\nAlready after the 2019-2020 season, there was talk of an NHL move for the now 27-year-old center.\n\nBut then he chose to nob the NHL offers and stay in Färjestad.\n\nFBK also chose to extend the contract and give Rydahl an increased salary. Then came a long-term injury, which meant that he played only nine games the season after.\n\nBut he has fought back and is now coming from perhaps his best season of his career. Leading player for Färjestad, Olympic games and one of the team's best scoring players during the Swedish Championship play-offs.\n\nNow the career goes on.\n\nLike I told you a couple of weeks ago Strong on puck, fantastic even and especially up against the boards. Can play C and W but I would use him as W since his faceoffs sucks.\n\nDoes he play a strong defensive game as a center?\n\nEliteprospects says his contract runs through 22/23. Is that accurate? Can he break that contract and come over next season?\n\nDoes he play a strong defensive game as a center?\n\nEliteprospects says his contract runs through 22/23. Is that accurate? Can he break that contract and come over next season?\n\nYes, I think so and he plays a gritty game.\n\nHe has an NHL out and have used it.\n\nFrom EliteProspects page:\n\n\"Rydahl is a physical powerforward who plays with a lot of grit. Loves to agitate opponents and takes advantage when players cannot handle their temper. Owns a decent shot, useful in boxplay and a tremendous team player. - David Enbom (2019)\n\nGustav Rydahl - Stats, Contract, Salary & More\n\nEliteprospects.com hockey player profile of Gustav Rydahl, 1994-09-11 Karlstad, SWE Sweden. Most recently in the undefined with Frölunda HC. Complete player biography and stats.\n\n... but they do mostly only post positive reports\n\nFirst clip in his highlight vid he passes up a chance alone with the goaltender for a royal road pass. Upping my crystal ball to 99.\n\nSo he would fit in, but wait he is a physical player, and he gets involved in scrums. He won’t fit in that well then. At least he won‘t skate away."
