        "text": "5 minute read\n\nTARRYTOWN - The final cuts are in, leaving the New York Rangers with 23 players on their roster to begin the 2022-23 NHL season.\n\nThat comes as somewhat of a surprise because it dwindles their available salary cap space down to about $183,500. That works to enter the season, but it will be prohibitive as they attempt to accrue additional space for the March 3 trade deadline. There's a long way to go until then, but don't be surprised to see the Rangers trim to 22 players sooner than later to aid in that process.\n\n\"Things can still happen,\" as head coach Gerard Gallant reminded us following Monday's practice at the MSG Training Center.\n\nMore:10 Rangers predictions for the 2022-23 season\n\nMore:Preseason takeaways: Could Sammy Blais' injury alter roster plans?\n\nFor now, though, our focus will shift to Tuesday's 7 p.m. opener at Madison Square Garden against the Tampa Bay Lightning.\n\nWith that mind, here are 23 thoughts on the new season − one for each player who made the roster:\n\nForwards (14)\n\nSammy Blais – You have to feel for the guy, who’s coming off right ACL surgery and is now dealing with an upper-body injury. He has all the tools to be an effective bottom-six player, but the Rangers are calling him doubtful for the opener.\n\nRyan Carpenter – How long this Gallant favorite can hold down the fourth-line center role is to be determined, especially if Gustav Rydahl performs well with AHL Hartford. But the 31-year-old with Staten Island roots is getting the first crack.\n\nFilip Chytil – The 23-year-old center took off in the playoffs, ranking third on the team with seven goals during their run to the Eastern Conference Final, and has ridden that confidence right into camp. Staying healthy will be key, but as he told me on Monday, “I’m excited for what’s ahead. I know what’s in me.”\n\nBarclay Goodrow – In his first season with New York, the 29-year-old showed why he was considered such an important glue guy for Tampa Bay’s back-to-back title teams. He’ll play anywhere in the lineup – and through all kinds of pain – without a complaint.\n\nDryden Hunt – The Rangers didn’t want to risk losing the energetic 26-year-old on waivers, with the Blais injury convincing them to keep him for the time being. But with accruing cap space for the trade deadline a priority, he may soon fall victim to the roster crunch. If that happens, they’ll hope he sneaks through and can be assigned to Hartford.\n\nKaapo Kakko – The Rangers’ leading goal-scorer in the preseason will rightly begin the season atop the right-wing depth chart. I’m calling 20-plus goals for the No. 2 overall pick from the 2019 NHL Draft, who is still just 21 years old.\n\nVitali Kravtsov – It appeared as if the embattled 22-year-old was heading for a healthy scratch on opening night, but Gallant has changed course. Monday’s practice saw him back on the second line with Artemi Panarin and Vincent Trocheck, which is the right call. The only rookie on the roster had a shaky preseason, but the only way to find out if he can handle the NHL game is to play him. Plus, what are the alternatives?\n\nChris Kreider – Can he score 52 goals again? That’s a tall order, but somewhere in the 30-to-40 range feels like the sweet spot for one of the league’s best net-front artists.\n\nAlexis Lafrenière – The No. 1 overall pick from the 2020 draft will begin the season on the third line, which allows him to stay on his natural left-handed side. Whether that changes at some point will be a lingering question, particularly if his situational usage and ice time doesn’t tick up. But much like Chytil, the 21-year-old’s strong playoff performance has fueled confidence that he’s ready to take a big step this season.\n\nArtemi Panarin – To be at his very best, the 30-year-old has to get back to doing “stupid (stuff).” Of course, puck management is important, but the Rangers can afford some risk-taking if it unlocks Panarin’s playmaking potential. He knows it and spent his offseason preparing to unleash his vast bag of offensive tricks.\n\nRyan Reaves – He may not play every game, but Gallant has made it clear that the 35-year-old veteran is “an important guy for us.” He remains a tone-setter in the locker room, but in an effort to extend his career, one of the NHL’s only remaining enforcers must show he can keep up with today’s fast-moving game.\n\nVincent Trocheck – The Rangers’ biggest offseason signing wasn’t thrilled with how his preseason went, as he’s still working to adjust to a new team and learn Panarin’s unpredictable tendencies. That will take time, but for the contract to prove a worthwhile investment, the 29-year-old will need to show he’s an upgrade over the second-line center he’s replacing, Ryan Strome.\n\nJimmy Vesey – One of the only surprises of camp was the former Ranger returning to where he began his career and earning a one-year contract. The 29-year-old started strong and held steady – and while it would have been a stretch to start him in the top six, a fourth-line/penalty-killing role will provide an opportunity to showcase how he’s “reinvented” himself.\n\nMika Zibanejad – Any questions about whether the 29-year-old is a true No. 1 center (not that they existed in this space) were finally put to bed in the playoffs. Zibanejad led the Rangers with 24 points (10 goals and 14 assists) in those 20 games and was the driving force in front of Igor Shesterkin. He’s on the short list of the Blueshirts’ most important players.\n\nDefensemen (7)\n\nAdam Fox – Is it possible for a former Norris Trophy winner to fly under the radar? With so many other stars and intriguing young players on this roster, the 24-year-old has quietly gone about his business throughout camp. But he, too, found another gear in the playoffs and should be in line for a big season.\n\nLibor Hájek – Things just haven’t panned out for the 24-year-old, who only played 17 games last season and seems destined for another year of mostly watching from the press box as the extra defenseman.\n\nZac Jones – The Rangers made the right call in giving the 21-year-old (he’ll be 22 next week) the first crack at filling the open left-handed spot on the bottom pair. He’s paid his dues and emerged as the top defenseman prospect among those who haven't had an extended look at the highest level. Now is his chance.\n\nRyan Lindgren – He’s been dealing with a lower-body injury, but did anyone actually think he would miss opening night? Of course not. The 24-year-old has been a rock since his 2019 arrival and further showcased his toughness by playing through a painful ankle injury during last year’s playoff run.\n\nK’Andre Miller – The 22-year-old is my No. 1 breakout candidate of the year. He’s been awesome throughout camp and has all the tools to become of the NHL’s best defenseman.\n\nBraden Schneider – After playing 63 NHL games between the regular season and playoffs, the 21-year-old will be the grizzled veteran on the bottom pair next to Jones. He looks even stronger than he did last year, with the Rangers holding high hopes that he’ll develop into a defensive stalwart.\n\nJacob Trouba – All eyes will be on the captain to show he can lead without being affected by the pressure that comes with wearing the “C.” He’s looked comfortable with the added responsibility so far, but bigger tests await.\n\nGoalies (2)\n\nJaroslav Halák – The hope is simply that the 37-year-old veteran will only be required to make 20-to-25 starts and responds well to sporadic playing time.\n\nIgor Shesterkin – Of all the star players on this roster, none are as critical to the Rangers’ success as the reigning Vezina Trophy winner. The 26-year-old posted historic numbers last season, particularly his .935 save percentage, while carrying the team through stretches when their five-on-five play was lackluster. If he can maintain that high level of play – and stay healthy – the Blueshirts should be considered legitimate Stanley Cup contenders."
