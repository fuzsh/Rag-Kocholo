        "text": "Quantifying wall turbulence via a symmetry approach: A Lie group theory\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nShe, Zhen-Su; Chen, Xi; Hussain, Fazle\n\n2017-11-01\n\nWe present a symmetry-based approach which yields analytic expressions for the mean velocity and kinetic energy profiles from a Lie-group analysis. After verifying the dilation-group invariance of the Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes equation in the presence of a wall, we select a stress and energy length function as similarity variables which are assumed to have a simple dilation-invariant form. Three kinds of (local) invariant forms of the length functions are postulated, a combination of which yields a multi-layer formula giving its distribution in the entire flow region normal to the wall. The mean velocity profile is then predicted using the mean momentum equation, which yields, in particular, analytic expressions for the (universal) wall function and separate wake functions for pipe and channel - which are validated by data from direct numerical simulations (DNS). Future applications to a variety of wall flows such as flows around flat plate or airfoil, in a Rayleigh-Benard cell or Taylor-Couette system, etc., are discussed, for which the dilation group invariance is valid in the wall-normal direction.\n\nFunctional group interactions with single wall carbon NT studied by ab-initio calculations\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCicero, Giancarlo\n\n2005-03-01\n\nWith the goal of designing functionalized nanotube materials, recent AFM measurements have succeeded in determining the force between individual chemical groups an single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) [1]. In order to rationalize and understand these experimental results, we have performed Density Functional Theory calculations for a number of structural arrangements of model tips functionalized with the same groups as those used experimentally. Our calculations include full geometry optimization of the composite SWCNT/tip system as well as `pulling-out' simulations to compute interaction forces. We considered (14x0), semi- conducting tubes, and AFM tips where modeled by a SiH3CH2-X molecule, with X- representing -CN, -CH3, -NH2 or -CH2OCH2. As X is varied, computed forces reproduce the same trend as that observed experimentally when n-doped SWCNT are considered; significantly different trends are observed for neutral and p-doped tubes. We propose that the polar solvent present in the experimental setup may be responsible for the n-doping of the nanotube suggested by our calculations.

L.\n\n1999-01-01\n\nThe asymptotic solutions, described by Tennekes and Lumley (1972), for surface flows in a channel, pipe or boundary layer at large Reynolds numbers are revisited. These solutions can be extended to more complex flows such as the flows with various pressure gradients, zero wall stress and rough surfaces, etc. In computational fluid dynamics (CFD), these solutions can be used as the boundary conditions to bridge the near-wall region of turbulent flows so that there is no need to have the fine grids near the wall unless the near-wall flow structures are required to resolve. These solutions are referred to as the wall functions. Furthermore, a generalized and unified law of the wall which is valid for whole surface layer (including viscous sublayer, buffer layer and inertial sublayer) is analytically constructed. The generalized law of the wall shows that the effect of both adverse and favorable pressure gradients on the surface flow is very significant. Such as unified wall function will be useful not only in deriving analytic expressions for surface flow properties but also bringing a great convenience for CFD methods to place accurate boundary conditions at any location away from the wall. The extended wall functions introduced in this paper can be used for complex flows with acceleration, deceleration, separation, recirculation and rough surfaces.\n\nGeneralized Wall Function for Complex Turbulent Flows\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nShih, Tsan-Hsing; Povinelli, Louis A.; Liu, Nan-Suey; Chen, Kuo-Huey\n\n2000-01-01\n\nA generalized wall function was proposed by Shih et al., (1999). It accounts the effect of pressure gradients on the flow near the wall. Theory shows that the effect of pressure gradients on the flow in the inertial sublayer is very significant and the standard wall function should be replaced by a generalized wall function. Since the theory is also valid for boundary layer flows toward separation, the generalized wall function may be applied to complex turbulent flows with acceleration, deceleration, separation and recirculation. This paper is to verify the generalized wall function with numerical simulations for boundary layer flows with various adverse and favorable pressure gradients, including flows about to separate. Furthermore, a general procedure of implementation of the generalized wall function for National Combustion Code (NCC) is described, it can be applied to both structured and unstructured CFD codes.\n\nStomatal cell wall composition: distinctive structural patterns associated with different phylogenetic groups\n\nPubMed Central\n\nShtein, Ilana; Shelef, Yaniv; Marom, Ziv; Zelinger, Einat; Schwartz, Amnon; Popper, ZoÃ« A.; Bar-On, Benny\n\n2017-01-01\n\nBackground and Aims Stomatal morphology and function have remained largely conserved throughout â¼400 million years of plant evolution. However, plant cell wall composition has evolved and changed. Here stomatal cell wall composition was investigated in different vascular plant groups in attempt to understand their possible effect on stomatal function. Methods A renewed look at stomatal cell walls was attempted utilizing digitalized polar microscopy, confocal microscopy, histology and a numerical finite-elements simulation. The six species of vascular plants chosen for this study cover a broad structural, ecophysiological and evolutionary spectrum: ferns (Asplenium nidus and Platycerium bifurcatum) and angiosperms (Arabidopsis thaliana and Commelina erecta) with kidney-shaped stomata, and grasses (angiosperms, family Poaceae) with dumbbell-shaped stomata (Sorghum bicolor and Triticum aestivum). Key Results Three distinct patterns of cellulose crystallinity in stomatal cell walls were observed: Type I (kidney-shaped stomata, ferns), Type II (kidney-shaped stomata, angiosperms) and Type III (dumbbell-shaped stomata, grasses). The different stomatal cell wall attributes investigated (cellulose crystallinity, pectins, lignin, phenolics) exhibited taxon-specific patterns, with reciprocal substitution of structural elements in the end-walls of kidney-shaped stomata. According to a numerical bio-mechanical model, the end walls of kidney-shaped stomata develop the highest stresses during opening. Conclusions The data presented demonstrate for the first time the existence of distinct spatial patterns of varying cellulose crystallinity in guard cell walls. It is also highly intriguing that in angiosperms crystalline cellulose appears to have replaced lignin that occurs in the stomatal end-walls of ferns serving a similar wall strengthening function.

We have studied experimentally the effects of this type of functionalization on the thermal conductivity of the nanocomposites. It was found that while even small quantities of carbon nanotubes (~1 wt %) can increase the electrical conductivity, a larger loading fraction (~3 wt %) is required to enhance the thermal conductivity of nanocomposites. Functionalized multi-wall carbon nanotubes performed the best as filler material leading to a simultaneous improvement of the electrical and thermal properties of the composites. Functionalization of the single-wall carbon nanotubes reduced the thermal conductivity enhancement. The observed trends were explained by the fact that while surface functionalization increases the coupling between carbon nanotube and polymer matrix, it also leads to formation of defects, which impede the acoustic phonon transport in the single-wall carbon nanotubes. The obtained results are important for applications of carbon nanotubes and graphene flakes as fillers for improving thermal, electrical and mechanical properties of composites.\n\nA unified wall function for compressible turbulence modelling\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nOng, K. C.; Chan, A.\n\n2018-05-01\n\nTurbulence modelling near the wall often requires a high mesh density clustered around the wall and the first cells adjacent to the wall to be placed in the viscous sublayer. As a result, the numerical stability is constrained by the smallest cell size and hence requires high computational overhead. In the present study, a unified wall function is developed which is valid for viscous sublayer, buffer sublayer and inertial sublayer, as well as including effects of compressibility, heat transfer and pressure gradient. The resulting wall function applies to compressible turbulence modelling for both isothermal and adiabatic wall boundary conditions with the non-zero pressure gradient. Two simple wall function algorithms are implemented for practical computation of isothermal and adiabatic wall boundary conditions. The numerical results show that the wall function evaluates the wall shear stress and turbulent quantities of wall adjacent cells at wide range of non-dimensional wall distance and alleviate the number and size of cells required.\n\nAn NPARC Turbulence Module with Wall Functions\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nZhu, J.; Shih, T.-H.\n\n1997-01-01\n\nThe turbulence module recently developed for the NPARC code has been extended to include wall functions. The Van Driest transformation is used so that the wall functions can be applied to both incompressible and compressible flows. The module is equipped with three two-equation K-epsilon turbulence models: Chien, Shih-Lumley and CMOTR models. Details of the wall functions as well as their numerical implementation are reported. It is shown that the inappropriate artificial viscosity in the near-wall region has a big influence on the solution of the wall function approach. A simple way to eliminate this influence is proposed, which gives satisfactory results during the code validation. The module can be easily linked to the NPARC code for practical applications.\n\nMultiple functionalization of multi-walled carbon nanotubes with carboxyl and amino groups\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nZhao, Zhiyuan; Yang, Zhanhong; Hu, Youwang; Li, Jianping; Fan, Xinming\n\n2013-07-01\n\nIn this paper, carboxyl and amino groups have been introduced onto the surface of the multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) by the mixed acid treatment and the diazonium reaction, respectively. The presence of multifunctionality groups on the MWCNTs has been characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, thermogravimetric (TGA) analysis, Raman spectra, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectrum (EDS). The multifunctionalized carbon nanotubes were further utilized to react with acetyl chloride and ethylenediamine (EDA). The formation of the amide bond in the grafting reaction has been confirmed by FT-IR spectroscopy. The result indicates that the further grafting is successful. The multifunctionalized MWCNTs can be a new versatile platform for many interesting applications.\n\nVisualizing chemical functionality in plant cell walls.\n\nPubMed\n\nZeng, Yining; Himmel, Michael E; Ding, Shi-You\n\n2017-01-01\n\nUnderstanding plant cell wall cross-linking chemistry and polymeric architecture is key to the efficient utilization of biomass in all prospects from rational genetic modification to downstream chemical and biological conversion to produce fuels and value chemicals. In fact, the bulk properties of cell wall recalcitrance are collectively determined by its chemical features over a wide range of length scales from tissue, cellular to polymeric architectures. Microscopic visualization of cell walls from the nanometer to the micrometer scale offers an in situ approach to study their chemical functionality considering its spatial and chemical complexity, particularly the capabilities of characterizing biomass non-destructively and in real-time during conversion processes. Microscopic characterization has revealed heterogeneity in the distribution of chemical features, which would otherwise be hidden in bulk analysis. Key microscopic features include cell wall type, wall layering, and wall composition-especially cellulose and lignin distributions. Microscopic tools, such as atomic force microscopy, stimulated Raman scattering microscopy, and fluorescence microscopy, have been applied to investigations of cell wall structure and chemistry from the native wall to wall treated by thermal chemical pretreatment and enzymatic hydrolysis. While advancing our current understanding of plant cell wall recalcitrance and deconstruction, microscopic tools with improved spatial resolution will steadily enhance our fundamental understanding of cell wall function.\n\nChronic abdominal wall pain misdiagnosed as functional abdominal pain.\n\nPubMed\n\nvan Assen, Tijmen; de Jager-Kievit, Jenneke W A J; Scheltinga, Marc R; Roumen, Rudi M H\n\n2013-01-01\n\nThe abdominal wall is often neglected as a cause of chronic abdominal pain. The aim of this study was to identify chronic abdominal wall pain syndromes, such as anterior cutaneous nerve entrapment syndrome (ACNES), in a patient population diagnosed with functional abdominal pain, including irritable bowel syndrome, using a validated 18-item questionnaire as an identification tool. In this cross-sectional analysis, 4 Dutch primary care practices employing physicians who were unaware of the existence of ACNES were selected. A total of 535 patients â¥18 years old who were registered with a functional abdominal pain diagnosis were approached when they were symptomatic to complete the questionnaire (maximum 18 points). Responders who scored at least the 10-point cutoff value (sensitivity, 0.94; specificity, 0.92) underwent a diagnostic evaluation to establish their final diagnosis. The main outcome was the presence and prevalence of ACNES in a group of symptomatic patients diagnosed with functional abdominal pain. Of 535 patients, 304 (57%) responded; 167 subjects (31%) recently reporting symptoms completed the questionnaire. Of 23 patients who scored above the 10-point cutoff value, 18 were available for a diagnostic evaluation. In half of these subjects (n = 9) functional abdominal pain (including IBS) was confirmed. However, the other 9 patients were suffering from abdominal wall pain syndrome, 6 of whom were diagnosed with ACNES (3.6% prevalence rate of symptomatic subjects; 95% confidence interval, 1.7-7.6), whereas the remaining 3 harbored a painful lipoma, an abdominal herniation, and a painful scar. A clinically relevant portion of patients previously diagnosed with functional abdominal pain syndrome in a primary care environment suffers from an abdominal wall pain syndrome such as ACNES.\n\nVisualizing chemical functionality in plant cell walls\n\nDOE PAGES\n\nZeng, Yining; Himmel, Michael E.; Ding, Shi-You\n\n2017-11-30\n\nUnderstanding plant cell wall cross-linking chemistry and polymeric architecture is key to the efficient utilization of biomass in all prospects from rational genetic modification to downstream chemical and biological conversion to produce fuels and value chemicals.

However, the frameworksâ dense layer architecture results in low porosity that has thus far restricted their potential for carbon dioxide adsorption. Here we report a strategy for converting a conventional 2D COF into an outstanding platform for carbon dioxide capture through channel-wall functionalization. The dense layer structure enables the dense integration of functional groups on the channel walls, creating a new version of COFs with high capacity, reusability, selectivity, and separation productivity for flue gas. These results suggest that channel-wall functional engineering could be a facile and powerful strategy to develop 2D COFs for high-performance gas storage and separation.

In this study, a multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNTs) was functionalized by oxidation treatment using concentrated nitric acid. The functionalized and pristine MWCNTs were analyzed by using Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR) and X-Ray Diffraction (XRD). The XRD patterns exhibit the graphitic properties for all samples. Besides, the XRD results also demonstrate that the percent of crystallinity of MWCNTs increases as the duration of acid treatment increases. The percent of crystallinity increases from 66% to 80% when the pristine MWCNT treated for 12 hours with additionalmoreÂ Â» 12 hours reflux process with nitric acid. The IR spectrum for the 12 hours-treated MWCNTs shows the formation of carboxyl functional group. Additional 12 hours reflux process with nitric acid on the 12 hours-treated MWCNTs have shown the loss of existing carboxyl group and only hydroxyl group formed.Â«Â less\n\n40 CFR 721.10663 - Functionalized multi-walled carbon nanotubes (generic).\n\nCode of Federal Regulations, 2013 CFR\n\n2013-07-01\n\n...

Although essential in the protection of the fungal cell against aggressive external stresses, the biosynthesis of the polysaccharide core is poorly understood. For a long time it was considered that this cell wall skeleton was a fixed structure whose role was only to be sensed as non-self by the host and consequently trigger the defence response. It is now known that the cell wall polysaccharide composition and localization continuously change to adapt to their environment and that these modifications help the fungus to escape from the immune system. Moreover, cell wall polysaccharides could function as true virulence factors. Copyright Â© 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

S.\n\n1986-01-01\n\nA new wall function approach is developed based on a wall law suitable for incompressible turbulent boundary layers under strong adverse pressure gradients. This wall law was derived from a one-dimensional analysis of the turbulent kinetic energy equation with gradient diffusion concept employed in modeling the near-wall shear stress gradient. Numerical testing cases for the present wall functions include turbulent separating flows around an airfoil and turbulent recirculating flows in several confined regions. Improvements on the predictions using the present wall functions are illustrated. For cases of internal recirculating flows, one modification factor for improving the performance of the k-epsilon turbulence model in the flow recirculation regions is also included.\n\nFunctional electronic inversion layers at ferroelectric domain walls\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMundy, J.

A.; Ramesh, R.; Spaldin, N. A.; Meier, D.\n\n2017-06-01\n\nFerroelectric domain walls hold great promise as functional two-dimensional materials because of their unusual electronic properties. Particularly intriguing are the so-called charged walls where a polarity mismatch causes local, diverging electrostatic potentials requiring charge compensation and hence a change in the electronic structure. These walls can exhibit significantly enhanced conductivity and serve as a circuit path. The development of all-domain-wall devices, however, also requires walls with controllable output to emulate electronic nano-components such as diodes and transistors. Here we demonstrate electric-field control of the electronic transport at ferroelectric domain walls. We reversibly switch from resistive to conductive behaviour at charged walls in semiconducting ErMnO3. We relate the transition to the formation--and eventual activation--of an inversion layer that acts as the channel for the charge transport. The findings provide new insight into the domain-wall physics in ferroelectrics and foreshadow the possibility to design elementary digital devices for all-domain-wall circuitry.\n\nSingle functional group interactions with individual carbon nanotubes\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nFriddle, Raymond W.; Lemieux, Melburne C.; Cicero, Giancarlo; Artyukhin, Alexander B.; Tsukruk, Vladimir V.; Grossman, Jeffrey C.; Galli, Giulia; Noy, Aleksandr\n\n2007-11-01\n\nCarbon nanotubes display a consummate blend of materials properties that affect applications ranging from nanoelectronic circuits and biosensors to field emitters and membranes. These applications use the non-covalent interactions between the nanotubes and chemical functionalities, often involving a few molecules at a time. Despite their wide use, we still lack a fundamental understanding and molecular-level control of these interactions. We have used chemical force microscopy to measure the strength of the interactions of single chemical functional groups with the sidewalls of vapour-grown individual single-walled carbon nanotubes. Surprisingly, the interaction strength does not follow conventional trends of increasing polarity or hydrophobicity, and instead reflects the complex electronic interactions between the nanotube and the functional group. Ab initio calculations confirm the observed trends and predict binding force distributions for a single molecular contact that match the experimental results. Our analysis also reveals the important role of molecular linkage dynamics in determining interaction strength at the single functional group level.\n\nRecovery after abdominal wall reconstruction.\n\nPubMed\n\nJensen, Kristian Kiim\n\n2017-03-01\n\nIncisional hernia is a common long-term complication to abdominal surgery, occurring in more than 20% of all patients. Some of these hernias become giant and affect patients in several ways. This patient group often experiences pain, decreased perceived body image, and loss of physical function, which results in a need for surgical repair of the giant hernia, known as abdominal wall reconstruction. In the current thesis, patients with a giant hernia were examined to achieve a better understanding of their physical and psychological function before and after abdominal wall reconstruction. Study I was a systematic review of the existing standardized methods for assessing quality of life after incisional hernia repair. After a systematic search in the electronic databases Embase and PubMed, a total of 26 studies using standardized measures for assessment of quality of life after incisional hernia repair were found. The most commonly used questionnaire was the generic Short-Form 36, which assesses overall health-related quality of life, addressing both physical and mental health. The second-most common questionnaire was the Carolinas Comfort Scale, which is a disease specific questionnaire addressing pain, movement limitation and mesh sensation in relation to a current or previous hernia. In total, eight different questionnaires were used at varying time points in the 26 studies. In conclusion, standardization of timing and method of quality of life assessment after incisional hernia repair was lacking. Study II was a case-control study of the effects of an enhanced recovery after surgery pathway for patients undergoing abdominal wall reconstruction for a giant hernia. Sixteen consecutive patients were included prospectively after the implementation of a new enhanced recovery after surgery pathway at the Digestive Disease Center, Bispebjerg Hospital, and compared to a control group of 16 patients included retrospectively in the period immediately prior to the\n\nEnhanced antibacterial activity of amino acids-functionalized multi walled carbon nanotubes by a simple method.\n\nPubMed\n\nZardini, Hadi Zare; Amiri, Ahmad; Shanbedi, Mehdi; Maghrebi, Morteza; Baniadam, Majid\n\n2012-04-01\n\nMulti-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) were first functionalized by arginine and lysine under microwave radiation. Surface functionalization was confirmed by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). After the MWCNTs were functionalized by arginine and lysine, the antibacterial activity of all treated samples was increased significantly against all bacteria that were tested. Based on the observed minimum inhibitory concentration and radial diffusion assay, the sequence of antibacterial activity was MWCNTs-arginine>MWCNTs-lysine>pristine MWCNTs. The functionalized MWCNTs were especially effective against gram-negative bacteria (e.g., Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium). Interestingly, the MWCNT samples were effective against the resistant strain Staphylococcos aureus. The enhanced antibacterial activity was attributed to electrostatic adsorption of bacteria membrane due to positive charges of the functional groups on MWCNTs surface. Since MWCNTs have lower cytotoxicity than single-walled carbon nanotubes, their functionalization with cationic amino acids could be a beneficial approach in the disinfection industry.

Considerable progress has been achieved in developing successful orbital decompression techniques with regard to functional and cosmetic outcome. Decompression techniques with resection of the bony orbital walls are adequate tools in restoring visual acuity and reducing exophthalmus. A considerable degree of deterioration of motility disorders has been described in the literature depending on the techniques being used. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether a modified technique of 3-wall orbital decompression with preservation of a medial part of the periorbital tissue to support the medial rectus muscle, is able to reduce the postoperative risk of diplopia. A modified technique of orbital 3-wall decompression with resection of the medial orbital wall, the medial orbital floor and the floor of the frontal sinus has been used in patients with compressive optic neuropathy (n = 20) and for cosmetic reasons (n = 7) in cases of uni- or bilateral proptosis. Analysis of the results was performed concerning visual outcome, exophthalmus reduction and development of horizontal and vertical motility changes. In all cases of optic neuropathy improvement of visual function at an average of 4.63 +/- 4.5 lines could be achieved. Exophthalmus reduction was 3.2 +/- 2.4 mm in the functional group and 3.9 +/- 1.7 mm in the rehabilitative group. In this group motility of the medial rectus muscle remained unaffected except in one eye. In the functional group motility deterioration was observed in 62 %. The modified 3-wall decompression technique with preservation of a medial periorbital tissue strip is an adequate alternative technique in the therapy of optic neuropathy and exophthalmus reduction in endocrine orbitopathy with a low risk of postoperative motility disorders.\n\nPolarization-induced local pore-wall functionalization for biosensing: from micropore to nanopore.\n\nPubMed\n\nLiu, Jie; Pham, Pascale; Haguet, Vincent; Sauter-Starace, Fabien; Leroy, LoÃ¯c; Roget, AndrÃ©; Descamps, Emeline; Bouchet, AurÃ©lie; Buhot, Arnaud; Mailley, Pascal; Livache, Thierry\n\n2012-04-03\n\nThe use of biological-probe-modified solid-state pores in biosensing is currently hindered by difficulties in pore-wall functionalization. The surface to be functionalized is small and difficult to target and is usually chemically similar to the bulk membrane. Herein, we demonstrate the contactless electrofunctionalization (CLEF) approach and its mechanism. This technique enables the one-step local functionalization of the single pore wall fabricated in a silica-covered silicon membrane. CLEF is induced by polarization of the pore membrane in an electric field and requires a sandwich-like composition and a conducting or semiconducting core for the pore membrane. The defects in the silica layer of the micropore wall enable the creation of an electric pathway through the silica layer, which allows electrochemical reactions to take place locally on the pore wall. The pore diameter is not a limiting factor for local wall modification using CLEF. Nanopores with a diameter of 200 nm fabricated in a silicon membrane and covered with native silica layer have been successfully functionalized with this method, and localized pore-wall modification was obtained. Furthermore, through proof-of-concept experiments using ODN-modified nanopores, we show that functionalized nanopores are suitable for translocation-based biosensing.\n\nA new method of functionalized multi walled carbon nanotubes by natural oil for microorganism cells detection\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHaider, Adawiya J.; Marzoog, Thorria R.; Hadi, Iman H.; Jameel, Zainab N.\n\n2018-05-01\n\nIn this work, new surfactants for Functionalization of Multi Walled Carbon Nanotubes (F-MWCNTs) with functional groups have been developed by using walnut oil, to improve their surface activity (solubility) and a create free reticules (functional groups) on it. MWCNTs were functionalized with walnut oil via ultra-sonication technique at 25Â°C for 1h with no drastic fragmentation of MWCNTs. Fourier Transformed Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), High Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HRTEM) and have been employed for the characterizations and analysis. In addition, the antibacterial activity of functionalized MWCNTs against Gram negative.

P.\n\n2017-04-01\n\nWall function boundary conditions including the effects of compressibility and heat transfer are improved for compressible turbulent boundary flows. Generalized wall function formulation at zero-pressure gradient is proposed based on coupled velocity and temperature profiles in the entire near-wall region. The parameters in the generalized wall function are well revised. The proposed boundary conditions are integrated into Navier-Stokes computational fluid dynamics code that includes the shear stress transport turbulence model. Numerical results are presented for a compressible boundary layer over a flat plate at zero-pressure gradient. Compared with experimental data, the computational results show that the generalized wall function reduces the first grid spacing in the directed normal to the wall and proves the feasibility and effectivity of the generalized wall function method.\n\nUltrasound-aided formation of gold nanoparticles on multi-walled carbon nanotubes functionalized with mercaptobenzene moieties.\n\nPubMed\n\nPark, Gle; Lee, Kyung G; Lee, Seok Jae; Park, Tae Jung; Wi, Ringbok; Wang, Kye Won; Kim, Do Hyun\n\n2011-07-01\n\nA hybrid of multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) and gold nanoparticle (Au NP) was prepared under ultrasound irradiation. The approach starts with the functionalization of the walls of MWCNTs with mercaptobenzene moieties for the subsequent immobilization of Au NPs. From the Raman spectra, mercaptobenzene was proven to exist on the MWCNTs. Gold ions were added to the aqueous dispersion of functionalized MWCNTs (f-MWCNTs), and were reduced with the aid of ultrasound and ammonium hydroxide. The reduced gold nanoparticles were examined from the TEM images. Au NPs adhered specifically on the thiol groups of mercaptobenzene to be deposited uniformly on the outer walls of the f-MWCNTs. The application of ultrasound led to a high yield of MWCNT-Au nanocomposites and to the dense distribution of the Au NPs. Moreover, the synthesis reaction rate of the hybrid was considerably enhanced relative to synthesis with mechanical agitation. Through an adsorption test using gold-binding-peptide-(GBP)-modified biomolecules, the hybrid's potential for biological diagnosis was verified.\n\nPlant and algal cell walls: diversity and functionality\n\nPubMed Central\n\nPopper, ZoÃ« A.; Ralet, Marie-Christine; Domozych, David S.\n\n2014-01-01\n\nBackground Although plants and many algae (e.g. the Phaeophyceae, brown, and Rhodophyceae, red) are only very distantly related they are united in their possession of carbohydrate-rich cell walls, which are of integral importance being involved in many physiological processes.

Salt-bridge interactions between carboxylic acid groups of SWCNTs and amine groups of PS drove the assembly of SWCNTs at the interface, monitored by pendant drop tensiometry and laser scanning confocal microscopy. The impact of PS end-group functionality, PS and SWCNT concentrations, and the degree of SWCNT acid modification on the interfacial activity was assessed, and a sharp drop in interfacial tension was observed above a critical SWCNT concentration. Interfacial tensions were low enough to support stable oil/water emulsions. Further experiments, including potentiometric titrations and the replacement of SWCNTs by other carboxyl-containing species, demonstrated that the interfacial tension drop reflects the loss of SWCNT charge as the pH falls near/below the intrinsic carboxyl dissociation constant; species lacking multivalent carboxylic acid groups are inactive. The trapped SWCNTs appear to be neither ordered nor oriented.\n\nStomatal Function Requires Pectin De-methyl-esterification of the Guard Cell Wall.\n\nPubMed\n\nAmsbury, Sam; Hunt, Lee; Elhaddad, Nagat; Baillie, Alice; Lundgren, Marjorie; Verhertbruggen, Yves; Scheller, Henrik V; Knox, J Paul; Fleming, Andrew J; Gray, Julie E\n\n2016-11-07\n\nStomatal opening and closure depends on changes in turgor pressure acting within guard cells to alter cell shape [1].

The present study specifically investigated how a numeric wall function in the turbulence model of a two-dimensional boundary layer code, STAN5, affected heat transfer prediction capabilities. Several sources of inaccuracy in the wall function were identified and then corrected or improved. Heat transfer coefficient predictions were then obtained using each one of the modifications to determine its effect. Results indicated that the modifications made to the wall function can significantly affect the prediction of heat transfer coefficients on turbine blades. The improvement in accuracy due the modifications is still inconclusive and is still being investigated.\n\nCarotid artery wall shear stress is independently correlated with renal function in the elderly.\n\nPubMed\n\nGuo, Yuqi; Wei, Fang; Wang, Juan; Zhao, Yingxin; Sun, Shangwen; Zhang, Hua; Liu, Zhendong\n\n2018-01-12\n\nHemodynamic has increasingly been regarded as an important factor of renal function. However, the relationship between carotid artery wall shear stress (WSS) and renal function is not clarified. To investigate the relationship between carotid WSS and renal function, we recruited 761 older subjects aged 60 years and over from community-dwelling in the Shandong area, China. Carotid WSS, endothelial function, and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) were assessed in all subjects. Subjects were grouped by the interquartile of the carotid artery mean WSS. We found that the eGFRs derived from serum creatinine and/or cystatin C using three CKD-EPI equations were significantly higher and albumin/creatinine ratio was lower in the higher interquartile groups than in the lower interquartile groups ( P <0.05). The mean WSS was independently correlated with eGFRs even after adjustment for confounders. Similar findings were found between carotid artery peak WSS and eGFRs and albumin/creatinine ratio. In addition, we found that endothelial function was strongly related to carotid WSS and renal function after adjustment for confounders. In conclusion, there is an independent correlation of carotid WSS with renal function in the elderly. The local rheologic forces may play an important role in renal function changing. The correlation may be mediated by regulation of endothelial function.\n\nValidation of a Node-Centered Wall Function Model for the Unstructured Flow Code FUN3D\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nCarlson, Jan-Renee; Vasta, Veer N.; White, Jeffery\n\n2015-01-01\n\nIn this paper, the implementation of two wall function models in the Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) computational uid dynamics (CFD) code FUN3D is described. FUN3D is a node centered method for solving the three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations on unstructured computational grids. The first wall function model, based on the work of Knopp et al., is used in conjunction with the one-equation turbulence model of Spalart-Allmaras. The second wall function model, also based on the work of Knopp, is used in conjunction with the two-equation k-! turbulence model of Menter. The wall function models compute the wall momentum and energy flux, which are used to weakly enforce the wall velocity and pressure flux boundary conditions in the mean flow momentum and energy equations. These wall conditions are implemented in an implicit form where the contribution of the wall function model to the Jacobian are also included. The boundary conditions of the turbulence transport equations are enforced explicitly (strongly) on all solid boundaries. The use of the wall function models is demonstrated on four test cases: a at plate boundary layer, a subsonic di user, a 2D airfoil, and a 3D semi-span wing. Where possible, different near-wall viscous spacing tactics are examined. Iterative residual convergence was obtained in most cases. Solution results are compared with theoretical and experimental data for several variations of grid spacing. In general, very good comparisons with data were achieved.\n\nRemoval of heavy metal ions from wastewaters using dendrimer-functionalized multi-walled carbon nanotubes.\n\nPubMed\n\nIannazzo, Daniela; Pistone, Alessandro; Ziccarelli, Ida; Espro, Claudia; Galvagno, Signorino; GiofrÃ©, Salvatore V; Romeo, Roberto; Cicero, Nicola; Bua, Giuseppe D; Lanza, Giuseppe; Legnani, Laura; Chiacchio, Maria A\n\n2017-06-01\n\nDendrimer-functionalized multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) for heavy metal ion removal from wastewaters were developed. Triazole dendrimers (TD) were built directly onto the carbon nanotube surface by successive click chemistry reactions affording the zero- and first-generation dendrimer-functionalized MWCNT (MWCNT-TD1 and MWCNT-TD2). The Moedritzer-Irani reaction carried out on the amino groups present on the MWCNT-TD2 sample gave the corresponding Î±-aminophosphonate nanosystem MWCNT-TD2P. Both MWCNT-TD2 and MWCNT-TD2P nanosystems have been characterized by physical, chemical, and morphological analyses. Their chelating abilities towards the toxic metal ions Pb 2+ , Hg 2+ , and Ni 2+ and the harmless Ca 2+ ion have been experimentally evaluated in the two different sets of experiments and at the salt concentrations of 1Â mg/mL or 1Â Î¼g/mL by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). The results of these studies pointed out the interesting chelating behavior for the phosphonated nanosystem towards the Hg 2+ ion. The complexation mode of the best chelating system MWCNT-TD2P with mercury was investigated through density functional theory (DFT) calculations, suggesting a chelation mechanism involving the two oxygen atoms of the phosphate group. The synthesized dendrimers, supported on the multi-walled carbon nanotubes, have shown the potential to be used for the selective toxic metal ion removal and recovery.\n\nComputation of turbulent boundary layers employing the defect wall-function method. M.S. Thesis\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nBrown, Douglas L.\n\n1994-01-01\n\nIn order to decrease overall computational time requirements of spatially-marching parabolized Navier-Stokes finite-difference computer code when applied to turbulent fluid flow, a wall-function methodology, originally proposed by R. Barnwell, was implemented. This numerical effort increases computational speed and calculates reasonably accurate wall shear stress spatial distributions and boundary-layer profiles. Since the wall shear stress is analytically determined from the wall-function model, the computational grid near the wall is not required to spatially resolve the laminar-viscous sublayer. Consequently, a substantially increased computational integration step size is achieved resulting in a considerable decrease in net computational time. This wall-function technique is demonstrated for adiabatic flat plate test cases from Mach 2 to Mach 8. These test cases are analytically verified employing: (1) Eckert reference method solutions, (2) experimental turbulent boundary-layer data of Mabey, and (3) finite-difference computational code solutions with fully resolved laminar-viscous sublayers. Additionally, results have been obtained for two pressure-gradient cases: (1) an adiabatic expansion corner and (2) an adiabatic compression corner.\n\nMolecular regulation of plant cell wall extensibility\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nCosgrove, D. J.\n\n1998-01-01\n\nGravity responses in plants often involve spatial and temporal changes in cell growth, which is regulated primarily by controlling the ability of the cell wall to extend. The wall is thought to be a cellulose-hemicellulose network embedded in a hydrated matrix of complex polysaccharides and a small amount of structural protein. The wall extends by a form of polymer creep, which is mediated by expansins, a novel group of wall-loosening proteins. Expansins were discovered during a molecular dissection of the \"acid growth\" behavior of cell walls. Expansin alters the rheology of plant walls in profound ways, yet its molecular mechanism of action is still uncertain. It lacks detectable hydrolytic activity against the major components of the wall, but it is able to disrupt noncovalent adhesion between wall polysaccharides. The discovery of a second family of expansins (beta-expansins) sheds light on the biological role of a major group of pollen allergens and implies that expansins have evolved for diverse developmental functions. Finally, the contribution of other processes to wall extensibility is briefly summarized.\n\nRedox protein noncovalent functionalization of double-wall carbon nanotubes: electrochemical binder-less glucose biosensor.\n\nPubMed\n\nPumera, Martin; SmÃ­d, Bretislav\n\n2007-10-01\n\nDouble wall carbon nanotubes are noncovalently functionalized with redox protein and such assembly is used for construction of electrochemical binder-less glucose biosensor.

Here, we successfully implemented a Tobacco Rattle Virus (TRV)-based VIGS system to study functions of genes involved in either primary or secondary cell wall formation in Nicotiana benthamiana plants. A 3-week post-VIGS time frame is sufficient to observe phenotypic alterations in the anatomical structure of stems and chemical composition of the primary and secondary cell walls. We used cell wall glycan-directed monoclonal antibodies to demonstrate that alteration of cell wall polymer synthesis during the secondary growth phase of VIGS plants has profound effects on the extractability of components from woody stem cell walls. Therefore, TRV-based VIGS together with cell wall component profiling methods provide a high-throughput gene discovery platform for studying plant cell wall formation from a bioenergy perspective.\n\nSingle Wall Nanotube Type-Specific Functionalization and Separation\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nBoul, Peter; Nikolaev, Pavel; Sosa, Edward; Arepalli, Sivaram; Yowell, Leonard\n\n2008-01-01\n\nMetallic single-wall carbon nanotubes were selectively solubilized in THF and separated from semiconducting nanotubes. Once separated, the functionalized metallic tubes were de-functionalized to restore their metallic band structure. Absorption and Raman spectroscopy of the enriched samples support conclusions of the enrichment of nanotube samples by metallic type. A scalable method for enriching nanotube conductive type has been developed. Raman and UV-Vis data indicate SWCNT reaction with dodecylbenzenediazonium results in metallic enrichment. It is expected that further refinement of this techniques will lead to more dramatic separations of types and diameters.\n\nSpectroscopic studies on sidewall carboxylic acid functionalization of multi-walled carbon nanotubes with valine.\n\nPubMed\n\nDeborah, M; Jawahar, A; Mathavan, T; Dhas, M Kumara; Benial, A Milton Franklin\n\n2015-03-15\n\nThe valine functionalized multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTS) were prepared and characterized by using XRD, UV-Vis, FT-IR, EPR, SEM, and EDX, spectroscopic techniques.

UV-Vis study shows the formation of valine functionalized MWCNTs. FT-IR study confirms the presence of functional groups of oxidized MWCNTs and valine functionalized MWCNTs. The ESR line shape analysis indicates that the observed EPR line shape is a Gaussian line shape. The g-values indicate that the systems are isotropic in nature. The morphology study was carried out for oxidized MWCNTs and valine functionalized MWCNTs by using SEM.

In the present study, the structural features of cell walls of the alga P. japonica concerning the formation of the cell groups were investigated using histochemical methods. Thin cell layers stained by Calcofluor White appeared to envelope the two-celled and four-celled groups separately and, hence, separated them from neighboring cell groups, and the Calcofluor White-negative gaps between neighboring four-celled groups were specifically stained by lectins, such as soybean agglutinin, jacalin, and Vicia villosa lectin conjugated with fluorescein. These results indicated that the Calcofluor White-positive cell wall layer of parent cell that existed during two successive cell divisions structurally distinguished two-celled and four-celled groups from others in this alga. Moreover, the results suggested that the cell wall components of the Calcofluor White-negative gaps would possibly contribute to the formation of the planar thallus through lateral union of the cell groups.\n\nFunctionalization of single-walled carbon nanotubes regulates their effect on hemostasis\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSokolov, A.

I.\n\n2011-04-01\n\nApplications of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) in medical field imply the use of drug-coupled carbon nanotubes as well as carbon nanotubes functionalized with different chemical groups that change nanotube surface properties and interactions between nanotubes and cells. Covalent attachment of polyethylene glycol (PEG) to carboxylated single-walled carbon nanotubes (c-SWNT) is known to prevent the nanotubes from interaction with macrophages. Here we characterized nanotube's ability to stimulate coagulation processes in platelet-poor plasma (PPP), and evaluated the effect of SWNTs on platelet aggregation in platelet-rich plasma (PRP). Our study showed that PEG-SWNT did not affect the rate of clotting in PPP, while c-SWNT shortened the clot formation time five times compared to the control PPP. Since c-SWNT failed to accelerate coagulation in plasma lacking coagulation factor XI, it may be suggested that c-SWNT affects the contact activation pathway. In PRP, platelets responded to both SWNT types with irreversible aggregation, as evidenced by changes in the aggregate mean radius. However, the rate of aggregation induced by c-SWNT was two times higher than it was with PEG-SWNT. Cytological analysis also showed that c-SWNT was two times more efficient when compared to PEG-SWNT in aggregating platelets in PRP. Taken together, our results show that functionalization of nanoparticles can diminish their negative influence on blood cells. As seen from our data, modification of c-SWNT with PEG, when only a one percent of carbon atoms is bound to polymer (70 wt %), decreased the nanotube-induced coagulation in PRP and repelled the accelerating effect on the coagulation in PPP. Thus, when functionalized SWNTs are used for administration into bloodstream of laboratory animals, their possible pro-coagulant and pro-aggregating properties must be taken into account.\n\nClassification of the maxillary sinus according to area of the medial antral wall: a comparison of two ethnic groups.\n\nPubMed\n\nLee, Fernandes Carmen; Fernandes, C M C; Murrell, H C\n\n2009-06-01\n\nThis study is an anatomical study designed to benefit surgeons working in the region of the maxillary sinus. This paper investigates ethnic and gender variations in the shape of the maxillary sinus in dried crania from the Raymond Dart collection of human skeletons. The paper claims that an estimate of the area of the medial antral wall of the maxillary sinus is one of the best ethnic/gender group predictors. Helical, multislice computed tomography was performed using 1mm coronal slices length, depth, width and volume measurements for each sinus were taken. Classification by shape and estimated area of medial wall was attempted. Shape classification was found to be unsuccessful whilst medial wall classification into ethnic/gender groupings gave encouraging results. The area of the medial wall is related to ethnic/gender groups.\n\nAcute toxicity of functionalized single wall carbon nanotubes: A biochemical, histopathologic and proteomics approach.\n\nPubMed\n\nAhmadi, Homa; Ramezani, Mohammad; Yazdian-Robati, Rezvan; Behnam, Behzad; Razavi Azarkhiavi, Kamal; Hashem Nia, Azadeh; Mokhtarzadeh, Ahad; Matbou Riahi, Maryam; Razavi, Bibi Marjan; Abnous, Khalil\n\n2017-09-25\n\nRecently carbon nanotubes (CNTs) showed promising potentials in different biomedical applications but their safe use in humans and probable toxicities are still challenging. The aim of this study was to determine the acute toxicity of functionalized single walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs). In this project, PEGylated and Tween functionalized SWCNTs were prepared. BALB/c mice were randomly divided into nine groups, including PEGylated SWCNTs (75,150Î¼g/mouse) and PEG, Tween80 suspended SWCNTs, Tween 80 and a control group (intact mice). One or 7 days after intravenous injection, the mice were killed and serum and livers were collected. The oxidative stress markers, biochemical and histopathological changes were studied. Subsequently, proteomics approach was used to investigate the alterations of protein expression profiles in the liver. Results showed that there were not any significant differences in malondealdehyde (MDA), glutathione (GSH) levels and biochemical enzymes (ALT and AST) between groups, while the histopathological observations of livers showed some injuries. The results of proteomics analysis revealed indolethylamine N-Methyltransferase (INMT), glycine N-Methyltransferase (GNMT), selenium binding protein (Selenbp), thioredoxin peroxidase (TPx), TNF receptor associated protein 1(Trap1), peroxiredoxin-6 (Prdx6), electron transport flavoprotein (Etf-Î±), regucalcin (Rgn) and ATP5b proteins were differentially expressed in functionalized SWCNTs groups. Western blot analyses confirmed that the changes in Prdx6 were consistent with 2-DE gel analysis. In summary, acute toxicological study on two functionalized SWCNTs did not show any significant toxicity at selected doses. Proteomics analysis also showed that following exposure to functionalized SWCNTs, the expression of some proteins with antioxidant activity and detoxifying properties were increased in liver tissue.

Two different wall function formulations are tested against experimental data obtained for bubbly boundary layers: (i) a new analytical solution derived through asymptotic techniques and (ii) the previous formulation of Troshko and Hassan (IJHMT, 44, 871-875, 2001a). A modified k-e model is used to close the averaged Navier-Stokes equations together with the hypothesis that turbulence can be modelled by a linear superposition of bubble and shear induced eddy viscosities. The work shows, in particular, how four corrections must the implemented in the standard single-phase k-e model to account for the effects of bubbles. The numerical implementation of the near wall functions is made through a finite elements code.\n\nRib Cage Deformities Alter Respiratory Muscle Action and Chest Wall Function in Patients with Severe Osteogenesis Imperfecta\n\nPubMed Central\n\nLoMauro, Antonella; Pochintesta, Simona; Romei, Marianna; D'Angelo, Maria Grazia; Pedotti, Antonio; Turconi, Anna Carla; Aliverti, Andrea\n\n2012-01-01\n\nBackground Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is an inherited connective tissue disorder characterized by bone fragility, multiple fractures and significant chest wall deformities. Cardiopulmonary insufficiency is the leading cause of death in these patients. Methods Seven patients with severe OI type III, 15 with moderate OI type IV and 26 healthy subjects were studied. In addition to standard spirometry, rib cage geometry, breathing pattern and regional chest wall volume changes at rest in seated and supine position were assessed by opto-electronic plethysmography to investigate if structural modifications of the rib cage in OI have consequences on ventilatory pattern. One-way or two-way analysis of variance was performed to compare the results between the three groups and the two postures. Results Both OI type III and IV patients showed reduced FVC and FEV1 compared to predicted values, on condition that updated reference equations are considered. In both positions, ventilation was lower in OI patients than control because of lower tidal volume (p<0.01). In contrast to OI type IV patients, whose chest wall geometry and function was normal, OI type III patients were characterized by reduced (p<0.01) angle at the sternum (pectus carinatum), paradoxical inspiratory inward motion of the pulmonary rib cage, significant thoraco-abdominal asynchronies and rib cage distortions in supine position (p<0.001). Conclusions In conclusion, the restrictive respiratory pattern of Osteogenesis Imperfecta is closely related to the severity of the disease and to the sternal deformities. Pectus carinatum characterizes OI type III patients and alters respiratory muscles coordination, leading to chest wall and rib cage distortions and an inefficient ventilator pattern. OI type IV is characterized by lower alterations in the respiratory function. These findings suggest that functional assessment and treatment of OI should be differentiated in these two forms of the disease.

The resulting method is more benign than conventional oxidation approaches and produces single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) with higher levels of oxidation. In this procedure, an oxygen saturated suspension of SWNTs in a suitable solvent containing a singlet oxygen sensitizer, such as Rose Bengal, is irradiated with ultraviolet light. The resulting oxidized tubes are recovered by filtering the suspension, followed by washing to remove any adsorbed solvent and sensitizer, and drying in a vacuum oven. Chemical analysis by FT-infrared and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy revealed that the oxygen content of the photo-oxidized SWCNT was 11.3 atomic % compared to 6.7 atomic % for SWCNT that had been oxidized by standard treatment in refluxing acid. The photo-oxidized SWCNT produced by this method can be used directly in various polymer matrixes, or can be further modified by chemical reactions at the oxygen functional groups and then used as additives. This method may also be suitable for use in oxidation of multiwall carbon nanotubes and graphenes.\n\nA density functional theory for association of fluid molecules with a functionalized surface: fluid-wall single and double bonding.\n\nPubMed\n\nHaghmoradi, Amin; Wang, Le; Chapman, Walter G\n\n2017-02-01\n\nIn this manuscript we extend Wertheim's two-density formalism beyond its first order to model a system of fluid molecules with a single association site close to a planar hard wall with association sites on its surface in a density functional theory framework. The association sites of the fluid molecules are small enough that they can form only one bond, while the wall association sites are large enough to bond with more than one fluid molecule. The effects of temperature and of bulk fluid and wall site densities on the fluid density profile, extent of association, and competition between single and double bonding of fluid segments at the wall sites versus distance from the wall are presented. The theory predictions are compared with new Monte Carlo simulation results and they are in good agreement. The theory captures the surface coverage over wide ranges of temperature and bulk density by introducing the effect of steric hindrance in fluid association at a wall site.\n\nInverse measurement of wall pressure field in flexible-wall wind tunnels using global wall deformation data\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBrown, Kenneth; Brown, Julian; Patil, Mayuresh; Devenport, William\n\n2018-02-01\n\nThe Kevlar-wall anechoic wind tunnel offers great value to the aeroacoustics research community, affording the capability to make simultaneous aeroacoustic and aerodynamic measurements. While the aeroacoustic potential of the Kevlar-wall test section is already being leveraged, the aerodynamic capability of these test sections is still to be fully realized. The flexibility of the Kevlar walls suggests the possibility that the internal test section flow may be characterized by precisely measuring small deflections of the flexible walls. Treating the Kevlar fabric walls as tensioned membranes with known pre-tension and material properties, an inverse stress problem arises where the pressure distribution over the wall is sought as a function of the measured wall deflection. Experimental wall deformations produced by the wind loading of an airfoil model are measured using digital image correlation and subsequently projected onto polynomial basis functions which have been formulated to mitigate the impact of measurement noise based on a finite-element study. Inserting analytic derivatives of the basis functions into the equilibrium relations for a membrane, full-field pressure distributions across the Kevlar walls are computed. These inversely calculated pressures, after being validated against an independent measurement technique, can then be integrated along the length of the test section to give the sectional lift of the airfoil. Notably, these first-time results are achieved with a non-contact technique and in an anechoic environment.\n\nFabrication of antibacterial PVA nanocomposite films containing dendritic polymer functionalized multi-walled carbon nanotubes\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSapalidis, Andreas; Sideratou, Zili; Panagiotaki, Katerina N.; Sakellis, Elias; Kouvelos, Evangelos P.; Papageorgiou, Sergios; Katsaros, Fotios\n\n2018-03-01\n\nA series of Poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) nanocomposite films containing quaternized hyperbranched polyethyleneimine (PEI) functionalized multi-walled carbon nanotubes (ox-CNTs@QPEI) are prepared by solvent casting technique. The modified carbon based material exhibits high aqueous solubility, due to the hydrophilic character of the functionalized hyperbranched dendritic polymer. The quaternized PEI successfully wraps around nanotube walls, as polycations provide electrostatic repulsion. Various contents of ox-CNTs@QPEI ranging from 0.05 to 1.0 % w/w were employed to prepare functionalized PVA nanocomposites. The developed films exhibit adequate optical transparency, improved mechanical properties and extremely high antibacterial behavior due to the excellent dispersion of the functionalized carbon nanotubes into the PVA matrix.\n\nMulti-walled carbon nanotubes: A cytotoxicity study in relation to functionalization, dose and dispersion.\n\nPubMed\n\nZhou, Lulu; Forman, Henry Jay; Ge, Yi; Lunec, Joseph\n\n2017-08-01\n\nChemical functionalization broadens carbon nanotube (CNT) applications, conferring new functions, but at the same time potentially altering toxicity. Although considerable experimental data related to CNT toxicity, at the molecular and cellular levels, have been reported, there is very limited information available for the corresponding mechanism involved (e.g. cell apoptosis and genotoxicity). The threshold dose for safe medical application in relation to both pristine and functionalized carbon nanotubes remains ambiguous. In this study, we evaluated the in vitro cytotoxicity of pristine and functionalized (OH, COOH) multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) for cell viability, oxidant detection, apoptosis and DNA mutations, to determine the non-toxic dose and influence of functional group in a human lung-cancer cell line exposed to 1-1000Î¼g/ml MWCNTs for 24, 48 and 72h. The findings suggest that pristine MWCNTs induced more cell death than functionalized MWCNTs while functionalized MWCNTs are more genotoxic compared to their pristine form. The level of both dose and dispersion in the matrix used should be taken into consideration before applying further clinical applications of MWCNTs. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The particular emphasis was on the effect of the included angle between two orifices (0-15 deg. in current study) on the flame structure and combustion characteristics under various simulated engine load conditions. The laser absorption scattering (LAS) technique was applied to analyze the spray and mixture properties. Direct flame imaging and OH chemiluminescence imaging were utilized to quantify the ignition delay, flame geometrical parameters, and OH chemiluminescence intensity. The imagesmoreÂ Â» show that the asymmetric flame structure emerges in wall-impinging group-hole nozzle sprays as larger included angle and higher engine load conditions are applied, which is consistent with the spray shape observed by LAS. Compared to the base nozzle, group-hole nozzles with large included angles yield higher overall OH chemiluminescence intensity, wider flame area, and greater proportion of high OH intensity, implying the better fuel/air mixing and improved combustion characteristics. The advantages of group-hole nozzle are more pronounced under high load conditions. Based on the results, the feasibility of group-hole nozzle for practical direct injection diesel engines is also discussed. It is concluded that the asymmetric flame structure of a group-hole nozzle spray is favorable to reduce soot formation over wide engine loads. However, the hole configuration of the group-hole nozzle should be carefully considered so as to achieve proper air utilization in the combustion chamber. Stoichiometric diesel combustion is another promising application of group-hole nozzle.

Despite recent technological advances in glycan analysis, structural elucidation of WTAs remains challenging due to their complex nature. Here, we employed a combination of ultra-performance liquid chromatography-coupled electrospray ionization tandem-MS/MS and NMR to determine the structural complexity of WTAs from Listeria species. We unveiled more than 10 different types of WTA polymers that vary in their linkage and repeating units. Disparity in GlcNAc to ribitol connectivity, as well as variable O -acetylation and glycosylation of GlcNAc contribute to the structural diversity of WTAs. Notably, SPR analysis indicated that constitution of WTA determines the recognition by bacteriophage endolysins. Collectively, these findings provide detailed insight into Listeria cell wall-associated carbohydrates, and will guide further studies on the structure-function relationship of WTAs.

These hybrid structures of organic-inorganic nanobiosensors are able to detect the smallest amino acid building block of proteins. The configurations of amine and carbonyl group coordination of tryptophan aromatic amino acid adsorbed on Pd/doped single walled carbon nanotube were compared. The frontier molecular orbital theory, quantum theory atom in molecule and natural bond orbital analysis were performed. The molecular electrostatic potential and the electron density surfaces were constructed. The calculations indicated that the Pd/SWCNT was sensitive to tryptophan suggesting the importance of interaction with biological molecule and potential detecting application. The proposed nanobiosensor represents a highly sensitive detection of protein at ultra-low concentration in diagnosis applications.\n\nAssociation Mapping of Cell Wall Synthesis Regulatory Genes and Cell Wall Quality in Switchgrass\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nBartley, Laura; Wu, Y.; Zhu, L.\n\ntranscription factors from the rice gene network. Eight of fifteen (53%) of these have not previously been examined for this function. Some of these may represent novel grass-diverged cell wall regulators, while others are likely to have this function across angiosperms. A parallel effort of this project to expand knowledge of enzymes that have evolved to function in grass cell wall synthesis, revealed that a grass-diverged enzyme in rice, OsAT 5, ferulates monolignols that are naturally incorporated into grass cell walls. This finding opens potential natural selection avenues for improving biomass composition for downstream processing by weak base pretreatment. Thus, this project has significantly expanded knowledge of cell wall synthesis and regulation in rice, information that can be used in reverse genetics and synthetic biology approaches to re-engineer cell walls for improved production of biofuel and high-value products. To lay the foundation for translating these results directly for switchgrass improvement, the project employed a comparative phylogenetic analysis of the major group of cell wall transcription factors that have been found to function in cell wall regulation, the R 2R 3 MYBs. This analysis concluded that known cell wall regulators are largely conserved across switchgrass, rice, maize, poplar, and Arabidopsis. This interpretation is also largely consistent with the gene network analysis described above, though both approaches provide evidence that some co-orthologs of Arabidopsis regulators have diminished or increased in importance based on gene expression patterns. Also, several clades containing dicot cell wall regulators have expanded, consistent with the evolution of new cell wall regulators. This latter result is supported by functional analysis of the R 2R 3 MYB protein SWAM 1 in a collaboration between this project and the DOE-funded group of Dr. S. Hazen at the University of Massachusettes.

In such a vessel, the tendency of a cell to fall in response to gravity is opposed by the rotation of the vessel and the culture medium within, keeping the cells in suspension without fluid shear. Previous reports indicated that such functions as lymphocyte migration through collagen matrix or monocyte cytokine secretion are altered under these conditions, and these changes correlate with similar functional defects of cultured cells seen during spaceflight.\n\nIf walls could talk\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nBraam, J.; McIntire, L.

The wall components and the mechanical properties of the wall have been implicated in conveying information that is important for morphogenesis. Proteoglycans, fragments of polysaccharides and the structural integrity of the wall may relay signals that influence cellular differentiation and growth control. Furthering our knowledge of cell wall structure and function is likely to have a profound impact on our understanding of how plant cells communicate with the extracellular environment.\n\nLiveWall Operational Evaluation: Seattle Law Enforcement Pilot\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nBarr, Jonathan L.; Burtner, Edwin R.; Stein, Steven L.\n\n2013-10-01\n\nThe LiveWall concept envisioned as an outgrowth of the Precision Information Environment (PIE) project allows communications between separate groups using interactive video, audio, and a shared desktop environment; this allows everyone to participate and collaborate in real time, regardless of location. The LiveWall concept provides a virtual window to other locations, where all parties can interact and collaboratively work with each other. This functionality is intended to improve multi-site coordination amongst emergency operations centers (EOC), field operations sites and across organizations and jurisdictions to accommodate communications during routine and emergency events. For the initial LiveWall operational evaluation PNNL partnered withmoreÂ Â» the Seattle Police Department (SPD). This partnership allowed for the creation of an excellent LiveWall test bed specific to law enforcement. This partnership made it possible to test the LiveWall concept with scenarios involving the many facets of the law enforcement work done by SPD. PNNL and SPD agreed that integrating the systems into operations for a real event would be the best test of the technology and give SPD staff greater visibility into the functionality and benefits offered by the LiveWall concept.Â«Â less\n\nEvidence for Functional Groupings of Vibrissae across the Rodent Mystacial Pad\n\nPubMed Central\n\nHobbs, Jennifer A.; Towal, R. Blythe; Hartmann, Mitra J. Z.\n\n2016-01-01\n\nDuring natural exploration, rats exhibit two particularly conspicuous vibrissal-mediated behaviors: they follow along walls, and âdabâ their snouts on the ground at frequencies related to the whisking cycle. In general, the walls and ground may be located at any distance from, and at any orientation relative to, the ratâs head, which raises the question of how the rat might determine the position and orientation of these surfaces. Previous studies have compellingly demonstrated that rats can accurately determine the horizontal angle at which a vibrissa first touches an object, and we therefore asked whether this parameter could provide the rat with information about the pitch, distance, and yaw of a surface relative to its head. We used a three-dimensional model of the whisker array to construct mappings between the horizontal angle of contact of each vibrissa and every possible (pitch, distance, and yaw) configuration of the head relative to a flat surface. The mappings revealed striking differences in the patterns of contact for vibrissae in different regions of the array. The exterior (A, D, E) rows provide information about the relative pitch of the surface regardless of distance. The interior (B, C) rows provide distance cues regardless of head pitch. Yaw is linearly correlated with the difference between the number of right and left whiskers touching the surface. Compared to the long reaches that whiskers can make to the side and below the rat, the reachable distance in front of the ratâs nose is relatively small. We confirmed key predictions of these functional groupings in a behavioral experiment that monitored the contact patterns that the vibrissae made with a flat vertical surface. These results suggest that vibrissae in different regions of the array are not interchangeable sensors, but rather functionally grouped to acquire particular types of information about the environment.

We focused our investigation mainly on intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) which are essential for coordinating an adequate mucosal immune response and on the functionality of macrophages. The probiotic bacteria and their cell walls were able to stimulate the IECs exhibiting an important activation and cytokine releases. Supplementation with PBCWs promoted macrophage activation from peritoneum and spleen, indicating that the PBCWs oral administration was able to improve the functionality of the macrophages. In addition, the PBCWs increased immunoglobulin A (IgA)-producing cells in the gut lamina propria in a similar way to probiotic bacteria, but this supplementation did not have an effect on the population of goblet cells in the small intestine epithelium. These results indicate that the probiotic bacteria and their cell walls have an important immunoregulatory effect on the IECs without altering the homeostatic environment but with an increase in IgA+ producing cells and in the innate immune cells, mainly those distant from the gut such as spleen and peritoneum. These findings about the capacity of the cell walls from probiotic bacteria to stimulate key cells, such as IECs and macrophages, and to improve the functioning of the immune system, suggest that those structures could be applied as a new oral adjuvant.\n\nOn the Interfacial Properties of Polymers/Functionalized Single-Walled Carbon Nanotubes\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAnsari, R.; Rouhi, S.; Ajori, S.\n\n2016-06-01\n\nMolecular dynamics (MD) simulations is used to study the adsorptio"
