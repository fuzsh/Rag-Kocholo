        "text": "We put out a call for mailbag questions on Dec. 5. Things looked a bit different for the Rangers way back then. They were 11-10-5, coming off their worst loss of the season at home to the Hawks and there was a lot of uncertainty.\n\nSo it’s perhaps some strange timing with these questions, which were mostly centered around a potential coaching change. There were some others in there – about organizational development, prospects, and whether the Rangers can keep Ryan Lindgren beyond this season.\n\nHere’s part one of the latest mailbag:\n\nHow does Patrick Kane and his 4 goals help the Rangers? His offensive numbers are down. Kane used to be a great player but those days are over. How come the media glosses over his lack of production? What have you done for me lately? — Dean S.\n\nWell Dean, I feel like I’ve done some decent work, couple good stories and podcasts… Oh, you meant PK88. Nvm.\n\nHe’s got four goals most likely because he’s playing on a team of misfits that’s going nowhere, so someone with his resume likely isn’t going to go all-out night after night. Kane knows he can name his destination most likely, so why turn it up a notch now?\n\nHe can help the Rangers power play diversify a bit, though it would likely mean one of the talented guys at the top of the Rangers’ power-play umbrella (Adam Fox, Artemi Panarin or Mika Zibanejad) has to adjust and likely leaves Vincent Trocheck out of the mix for PP1.\n\nIt’s far from a sure thing. But if the Rangers continue to win games and still look like a team that needs at least one more piece to compete, Kane would be on their radar, especially if Kane wants to come to New York because that will keep the trade price down.\n\nWho’s at the top of Chris Drury’s head coach list if he were to part ways with Gallant? The most talked about option (for good reason) is Barry Trotz, but what about an up-and-comer like Andrew Brunette? He’s allowed to talk to other teams during the season for a head coach position right now, from what I understand. Is that even an outside possibility, or is it far more likely he stays with NJ and levels up to HC there when Lindy Ruff is gone? I would be disappointed if we wound up with someone off the tired old coaching carousel of the past 10-15 years. — Bobby C.\n\nThis is what I deserve for taking mailbag calls just before a winning streak. These were all very valid questions 10 days ago; now, a bit less so, and certainly a bit more that Barry Trotz declared on a recent podcast he’s not taking a coaching job during this season.\n\nBrunette wouldn’t be a bad choice either, but I doubt the Rangers would make such a drastic move (firing Gallant) in the middle of the season to go out and get someone else’s associate coach. If you’re taking this big a swing you’re going to get a major name or someone at the very least who can turn the tide quickly, which almost certainly means a veteran coach who’s jumped into difficult situations before.\n\nWith Trotz and Joel Quenneville out of the mix — two league sources have told me that the NHL isn’t going to approve Quenneville’s return to coaching this season — that doesn’t leave many options for a midseason replacement.\n\nAlso, there’s the matter of this win streak. Drury certainly wasn’t rushing to dump his first hire, so this has come at a good time for the team and for Gallant. Now it’s hard to see the Rangers making a big move unless the wheels fall off.\n\nThis was the topic many of you rightly asked about last week. So hopefully this addresses those concerns for the time being.\n\nWhy do the Rangers consistently draft players that do not live up to their draft status? Is this a talent evaluation issue (don’t think so)? Or, do they lack proper development capabilities? Does Hartford need to be blown up in regards to coaching? Does a new developmental philosophy need to be adopted by the organization?\n\nI remember during the Red Wings’ 20-year run to the playoffs that prospects drafted played their first year in the AHL (almost always). Does the cap make this strategy impossible due to the need for inexpensive contracts to fill out an NHL roster?\n\n— Pat B.\n\nI’ll defer to the wise words of Steve Valiquette on player development. He’s said it often on The Garden Faithful podcast this season: To truly know what you’ve got in a young player, you need to see 200 games. Either at the NHL level for a forward or some combination of NHL/AHL time for a defenseman or goaltender.\n\nThe Rangers have had some fiascos already with Lias Andersson and Nils Lundkvist. Vitali Kravtsov’s fiasco seemed to reverse itself when he came back to the fold this summer, but now he’s a spare part and it’s hard to see how the team and player make anything good out of this.\n\nThat’s three first-rounders from two drafts either out of the organization or on their way out. That’s a dreadful track record, even when two other first-rounders from those 2017 and 2018 drafts, Filip Chytil and K’Andre Miller, look like core keepers.\n\nThe “why” is hard to pin down. Is it development? Andersson spent parts of three seasons in North America, Lundkvist just one and Kravtsov is in the middle of his third. With Andersson and Kravtsov there were early expectations that weren’t met, either through the player not meeting playing standards or the team not recognizing early on that each player needed to work on more than the coaches thought.\n\nIf you want to throw in the slow developments of Kaapo Kakko and Alexis Lafrenière, sure — but that’s where you run into salary cap concerns. Top-five picks tend to make rosters at 18, that’s the norm now. Kakko is no Jack Hughes, but Hughes’ success so far has been of the social media variety; Kakko made it to a conference final. The Rangers have been better than the Devils and gotten there on the backs of some star players, so Kakko isn’t getting the opportunities Hughes gets.\n\nSame goes for Lafrenière and Tim Stützle, the third pick in 2020. Would Stützle trade his 8x$8.35-million extension and 20 minutes a night for a crack at the playoffs that the Senators don’t seem close to getting? Maybe.\n\nThat’s a long way of saying there’s a bunch of factors. The Rangers drafted the wrong kids, or sometimes the right kid at the wrong time. There’s no easy-to-identify pattern.\n\nGiven the drop in play when Ryan Lindgren is out of the lineup, but also the salary cap, do you see the Rangers signing him to a long-term contract this summer? What do you think the term and salary have to be for him to stay? If you were a betting man, do you think he will be on the Rangers next year? — MKH\n\nI don’t see how, honestly. And the Board of Governors news this week that the cap is likely only going up $1 million next season makes it next to impossible to keep Lindgren while also signing Miller to any sort of mid- to long-term deal.\n\nMy best guess right now is that Miller slides in to be Fox’s partner, Matthew Robertson gets tentatively penciled in as Lindgren’s roster replacement and Drury tries his hardest to find a Mark Giordano-type on the cheap to either play with Fox or Braden Schneider.\n\nIt could be a real drop-off. Lindgren has a ton of respect in the Rangers’ room for how he plays and it is hard to duplicate.\n\nWill Kakko and Lafrenière ever be given any PP1 time this season? — Nicholas R.\n\nIt’s a question that’s asked a lot. Gallant’s answer is usually, “We’ll see.” Which, for the entire time he’s been here, has meant, “No.”\n\nIs that fair? No. But this is a results league and, man, have the Rangers needed results of late. So they’ve stuck with the five guys they like best on PP1 and those guys don’t give up the ice until they’ve basically run out of energy.\n\nIt would help both young players to get some more power play time. But would it help the team win games? That one’s hard to answer. And if there’s even a question as to whether it would help, you can see why Gallant won’t pull the trigger on it yet.\n\nThe Rangers’ player development department consists of Matt Hunwick (who was an OK NHL defenseman for a while) and fourth-line plug Tanner Glass (who was known for everything but his hockey skills). Considering Kakko and Lafrienière’s struggles to break out and reach their projected potential, should we perhaps look to shake up our player development department? — Thomas O.\n\nPlayer development coaches don’t work with NHL players. They rarely work with AHL players. They mostly keep a line of communication open with prospects outside the NHL or AHL and work with them during summer prospect camp or the pre-training camp rookie gathering. Just FYI.\n\nThe Rangers have a skills coach, Mark Ciaccio, who is on the ice just about every practice. He works with guys on individual stuff before and after the main skates and it’s not just the kids.\n\nSo again, the NHL is not a developmental league. Kakko and Lafrenière have been in tough spots, having to learn the NHL game on a team that now has real expectations. It’s been a bumpy ride, as it has been for all the players drafted close to both of them. But on a good team, the onus is more on the player to learn and adapt than on anyone else. That’s just the reality of today’s NHL.\n\nHow many players on the Wolf Pack are considered future NHL contributors? Anyone outside of the known names? — Michael R.\n\nTalked to three pro scouts who have seen Hartford anywhere from 3-5 times this season. The consensus choices were Matthew Robertson, who has 1-4-5 in 20 games this season and turned 21 in September, and Will Cuylle, who leads the Wolf Pack with seven goals and doesn’t turn 21 until February.\n\nOn Robertson: “I’m surprised he isn’t up yet,” said one scout. “He’s better than what they have here with (Libor) Hajek.”\n\nOn Cuylle: “He’s come on a bit lately,” one of the other scouts said. “He’s got the tools to be an NHLer.”\n\nThese may be familiar names to Rangers fans given both are second-round picks. One player who all three scouts like that’s maybe more off the radar: 28-year-old center Gustav Rydahl, who had a strong Rangers camp and has 2-3-5 in 17 AHL games.\n\n“He’s an NHL center,” one of the scouts said. “Good skating, strong on the puck, smart. He could be a fourth-liner right now for a lot of teams.”\n\n(Photo: Jamie Sabau / USA TODAY Sports)"
