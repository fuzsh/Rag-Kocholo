        "text": "Looking at the 13 games the Rangers have played this season, I think the evidence points most strongly to bad luck because the Rangers are performing much better at 5 on 5.\n\nIn 5 on 5 play this season, the Rangers are No. 5 in Corsi For (CF)%, No. 6 in Expected Goals For (xGF), and No. 23 in actual Goals For (GF). Last season, the Rangers were No. 25 in CF%, No. 27 in xGF, and No. 21 in GF.\n\nThere are clearly some issues on the defensive side at 5 on 5, but even there, the stats point to some bad luck. The Rangers are No.16 in Expected Goals Against (xGA) and No. 27 in actual Goals Against (GA). Last year they were No. 20 in xGA and No. 5 in actual GA at 5 on 5.\n\nThe numbers suggest that the Rangers are a much better team than they were last year. I don’t have the data to support it, but I doubt the Rangers achieved a 54% CF, even after the trade deadline. The team achieved a 47% CF for the full regular season at 5×5 last year. — Steve S.\n\nAs we’ve discussed on The Garden Faithful podcast with Steve Valiquette, the Rangers are among the league leaders in low-danger scoring chances this season. They’re also up there in high-danger chances too, which is good, but perhaps some of their players have been settling for long-range shots rather than going for quality as they did more a season ago.\n\nBut yes, they are controlling play better than they did last year, just not making it count. The Islanders game Tuesday was the biggest example of that — they outplayed the Isles for 50 minutes of that one and lost. Other than getting more out-of-this-world goaltending, what can they do besides keep playing the same way?"
