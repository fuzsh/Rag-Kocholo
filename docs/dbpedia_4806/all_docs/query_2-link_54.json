        "text": "The Rangers have re-signed Hartford Wolf Pack forward Anton Blidh to a two year, two-way contract. Blidh will earn $775k at the NHL if recalled or $350k in the AHL, the most likely scenario. Blidh was acquired by the Rangers from Colorado in exchange for Gustav Rydahl at the trade deadline this season. Blidh scored 7 goals and 11 points in 17 regular season games with the Pack, chipping in 2-5-7 in 9 playoff games as well.\n\nBlidh played great for the Pack and was a key piece in their surprising playoff run this season. It does seem that Chris Drury wants to continue creating a winning atmosphere in Hartford, which is a key ingredient to actual prospect growth. The Pack have been a disaster for a decade now, so itâ€™s nice to see some actual thought put into their roster."
