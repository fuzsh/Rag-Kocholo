        "text": "Share via Email\n\nIt’s been a while since we’ve talked actual game action, and it feels great to watch some live hockey again. The Rangers first preseason game got off with a bang, as two guys looking for roster spots made their presence felt big time. Jimmy Vesey got a goal and Brennan Othmann had two assists in the first period alone. No goal breakdown for the preseason, but we do have thoughts nonetheless.\n\nThat shorthanded goal by K’Andre Miller was just a beauty from Othmann. The pressure, the presence of mind to not just cut to the net, but to wait it out and let Miller get open, just amazing. There’s no reason to rush Othmann, so I still think he’s going back to the OHL, but man this kid is going to turn heads.\n\nVesey is likely competing with Othmann for a 3LW spot, but his main competition is going to be Barclay Goodrow and possibly Sammy Blais. A goal from a sharp angle, taking advantage of poor goalie positioning, is one way to set himself apart.\n\nA Chris Kreider goal from in front of the net? Shocker.\n\nIt’s just the Rangers first preseason game, but we should be happy with how much time the Rangers spent in the offensive zone.\n\nFilip Chytil picked up right where he left off, getting to the net, reading the play, and getting himself into a position to shoot once the puck gets low. I really hope the Rangers find a way to keep him. They will regret trading him if they do.\n\nZac Jones should be the front runner for 3LD, especially after that goal. It wasn’t pretty, but he made a good read and got out of a potential bad situation where he almost collided with Kaapo Kakko. His shot is much better this year too.\n\nAlso, good puck control by Kakko on that Jones goal. He was being pressured, but he protected the puck and bought time for Jones to get open.\n\nVitali Kravtsov is going to be a very good NHLer. We know the skill, but what has really improved is his play in the defensive and neutral zones. He’s actually playing a style of hockey that fits well within Gerard Gallant’s system. This bodes well for this season.\n\nIt’s just the Rangers first preseason game, but as of now there is no reason to keep Hajek in the lineup. He was outplayed by every Ranger.\n\nBobby Trivigno has some wheels.\n\nThere are a lot of guys who played last night that deserve another look after how they played. Vesey, Trivigno, Jones, Othmann, Gustav Rydahl, just to name a few.\n\nIt may be preseason, but it’s fun watching the Isles look like hot garbage.\n\nMore About:Game Wrap-ups Preseason"
