The present study is an attempt to evaluate and modify this instrument as necessary in light of the recent regulatory guidelines from the Food and Drug Administration on the use of patient-reported outcomes in clinical trials. Objectives Overall, the goal was to identify patientsâ highest priority cancer symptoms, compare these symptoms with those suggested by oncology experts, and construct a brief symptom index to assess these symptoms and categorize them as treatment-related, disease-related, or related to general function and well-being. Methods Patients (N = 49) with advanced (Stages III and IV) HCNs were recruited from participating National Comprehensive Cancer Network institutions and community cancer support organizations in the Chicago area. Patients completed open-ended interviews and symptom checklists. Participating oncology physician experts also rated symptoms. Content validity was obtained by evaluating results alongside items in the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy system. Eleven oncologists categorized symptoms in terms of importance and also whether the symptoms were primarily related to disease, treatment, or functional well-being. Results HCN-related symptoms endorsed as high priority by both patients and oncology experts were selected for the new National Comprehensive Cancer Network-Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Head and Neck Cancer Symptom Index-22. The final version includes 22 items, which are broken down into disease-related symptoms, treatment side effects, or general function and well-being. The new scale has acceptable internal consistency (Cronbachâs coefficient alpha = 0.86), content validity for use in chemotherapy trials of patients with advanced disease, and concurrent validity as demonstrated by moderate\n\nDistinguishing Depressive Symptoms From Similar Cancer-Related Somatic Symptoms: Implications for Assessment and Management of Major Depression after Breast Cancer.\n\nPubMed\n\nThompson, Lora M A; Bobonis Babilonia, Margarita\n\n2017-10-01\n\nPrevalence rates of major depressive disorder (MDD) following breast cancer diagnosis are estimated to be ~5% to >20%, and these rates range from slightly below to somewhat above the expected prevalence rate for MDD in the general population of women in the United States. Women with a history of MDD are at increased risk for recurrence of MDD after breast cancer and need to be monitored closely. To properly diagnose and treat MDD, healthcare providers must be able to recognize depressive symptoms and distinguish them from similar somatic symptoms that are associated with breast cancer and breast cancer treatment. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network and the American Society of Clinical Oncology have published guidelines for the screening, assessment, and care of adult cancer patients with depressive symptoms. Use of a standardized and validated screening measure may help healthcare providers identify patients in need of further assessment or treatment. Evidence-based nonpharmacological interventions such as cognitive behavioral therapy and antidepressant medications are recommended treatment options.\n\nExploratory study of impact of cancer-related posttraumatic stress symptoms on diabetes self-management among cancer survivors.\n\nPubMed\n\nJames, Janey; Harris, Yael T; Kronish, Ian M; Wisnivesky, Juan P; Lin, Jenny J\n\n2018-02-01\n\nPosttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) can be triggered by a diagnosis of a potentially life-threatening illness such as cancer. Little is known about the impact of cancer-related PTSS symptoms on self-management behaviors for comorbid chronic medical conditions such as diabetes mellitus (DM). We recruited patients with DM and a recent diagnosis of early-stage cancer from 2 medical centers in New York City. Cancer-related PTSS were assessed using the Impact of Events Scale (scoreÂ â¥Â 26). DM self-management behaviors (medication adherence, exercise, healthy diet, and glucose testing) were measured 3Â months later. Logistic regression was used to assess the association between cancer-related PTSS symptoms and DM self-management behaviors, adjusting for gender, marital status, and anxiety symptoms. Of 56 participants recruited, 33% reported cancer-related PTSS symptoms. Elevated cancer-related PTSS symptoms were associated with lack of healthy diet (odds ratio: 0.08, 95% confidence interval: 0.01-0.62). Early-stage cancer survivors with cancer-related PTSS symptoms were less likely to adhere to some DM self-management behaviors. Providers should recognize the impact of cancer-related PTSS symptoms to better support comorbid disease management in cancer survivors.

Cancer can also adversely impact on psychological wellbeing. Because many prostate cancer-related symptoms and side-effects are potentially modifiable, we investigated associations between symptoms and psychological wellbeing among prostate cancer survivors. Postal questionnaires were distributed to men diagnosed with prostate cancer 2-18 years previously identified through cancer registries. General and prostate cancer-specific symptoms were assessed using the EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-PR25, with higher symptom scores indicating more/worse symptomatology. Psychological wellbeing was assessed by the DASS-21. Associations between symptoms and each outcome were investigated using multivariate logistic regression, controlling for socio-demographic and clinical factors. A total 3348 men participated (response rateâ=â54%). Seventeen percent (95%CI 15.2%-17.9%), 16% (95%CI 15.1%-17.8%) and 11% (95%CI 9.5%-11.8%) of survivors scored in the range for depression, anxiety and distress on the DASS scales, respectively. In multivariate models, risk of depression on the DASS scale was significantly higher in men with higher urinary and androgen deprivation therapy (ADT)-related symptoms, and higher scores for fatigue, insomnia and financial difficulties. Risk of anxiety on the DASS scale was higher in men with higher scores for urinary, bowel and ADT-related symptoms and fatigue, dyspnoea and financial difficulties. Risk of distress on the DASS scale was positively associated with urinary, bowel and ADT-related symptoms, fatigue, insomnia and financial difficulties. Cancer-related symptoms significantly predict psychological wellbeing among prostate cancer survivors. Greater use of interventions and medications and to alleviate symptoms might improve psychological wellbeing of prostate cancer survivors.

Stress, defined as life events or perceptions of stress, is associated with depressive symptoms. However, little is known about the relationships between different types of stress and these symptoms in women with breast cancer. This relationship was tested in 210 women assessed after initial surgical treatment for regional breast cancer. Using Hierarchical Multiple Regression, three types of stress were examined: the occurrence of five stressful life events in the year prior to cancer diagnosis, perceptions of global stress, and perceptions of cancer-related traumatic stress. Other potentially relevant correlates of depressive symptoms were also examined, including the personality trait neuroticism, sociodemographics, and disease/treatment characteristics. Fifty-three percent of the variance in depressive symptoms was accounted for by three stress variables (perceptions of global and cancer-related traumatic stress and the life event-major financial difficulty) and two control variables (neuroticism and racial group). Specifically, global stress perceptions coupled with cancer-related intrusive thoughts and financial concerns along with the tendency towards negativity (neuroticism) may conspire to heighten a womenâs risk for depressive symptoms. Assessing multiple sources of stress would improve our ability to identify women âat riskâ for depressive symptoms and provide appropriate intervention.

Peer-reviewed journal articles, TCM texts, professional experience. The increasing integration of TCM into mainstream medicine mandates that oncology professionals be familiar with the benefits as well as risks. Clinical research on acupuncture in cancer care is growing and demonstrates it is safe for cancer patients, although results on efficacy across symptoms have been mixed. Informed oncology nurses can assist patients by making appropriate referrals to licensed acupuncturists and qualified TCM practitioners to help alleviate unpleasant symptoms associated with cancer and conventional cancer treatment.

The stereotype that breasts are a sign of women's femininity results in patients with breast cancer fearing diminished femininity and rejection, which may induce psychological problems that co-occur as a symptom cluster. Cross-sectional study. A total of 131 patients with breast cancer postmastectomy completed the study. A question measuring breast-related stereotype threat, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue Scale were used to assess their breast-related stereotype threat and symptoms of anxiety, depression and fatigue. Of the 131 patients who answered the breast-related stereotype threat question, 86 (65Â·6%) reported breast-related stereotype threat. They did not differ significantly in social and clinical characteristics compared with those without the stereotype, but did report significantly higher levels of the symptom cluster and each symptom (anxiety, depression and fatigue). The odds ratios of the stereotype were significant for the symptom cluster, depression and fatigue (odds ratiosÂ =Â 2Â·52-3Â·98, pÂ <Â 0Â·05). The breast-related stereotype threat was common in patients with breast cancer. There was about a twofold increase in their risk of experiencing the symptom cluster and symptoms of depression and fatigue. In clinical practice, breast-related stereotype threat should be measured together with prevalent symptoms (e.g. anxiety, depression and fatigue) in patients with breast cancer. Our findings will aid the development of interventions for improving the mental health of women with breast cancer.

The aim of this study was to investigate longitudinally the relationship of cancer-related cognitions with the severity, incidence, and persistence of anxiety, fear of cancer recurrence, depression, and insomnia symptoms during an 18-month period. Patients scheduled to undergo surgery for cancer (N = 962) completed a questionnaire assessing cancer-related cognitions at baseline (T1), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the severity subscale of the Fear of Cancer Recurrence Inventory, and the Insomnia Severity Index at baseline (T1) and 2 (T2), 6 (T3), 10 (T4), 14 (T5), and 18 (T6) months later. Group Ã time factorial analyses using mixed models revealed that participants endorsing more negative cancer-related cognitions consistently reported more severe symptoms throughout the 18-month period. Logistic regression analyses suggested that endorsing more negative cancer-related cognitions at T1 significantly increased incidence and persistence rates of clinical levels of psychological symptoms. These findings suggest that the endorsement of negative cancer-related beliefs at the perioperative period influences the longitudinal evolution of anxiety, fear of cancer recurrence, depression, and insomnia symptoms in the following months. These results highlight the relevance of using cognitive restructuring early during the cancer care trajectory to potentially revise erroneous beliefs about cancer and prevent the incidence and persistence of psychological disturbances over time.\n\nOral symptoms and functional outcome related to oral and oropharyngeal cancer.\n\nPubMed\n\nKamstra, Jolanda I; Jager-Wittenaar, Harriet; Dijkstra, Pieter U; Huisman, Paulien M; van Oort, Rob P; van der Laan, Bernard F A M; Roodenburg, Jan L N\n\n2011-09-01\n\nThis study aimed to assess: (1) oral symptoms of patients treated for oral or oropharyngeal cancer; (2) how patients rank the burden of oral symptoms; (3) the impact of the tumor, the treatment, and oral symptoms on functional outcome. Eighty-nine patients treated for oral or oropharyngeal cancer were asked about their oral symptoms related to mouth opening, dental status, oral sensory function, tongue mobility, salivary function, and pain. They were asked to rank these oral symptoms according to the degree of burden experienced. The Mandibular Function Impairment Questionnaire (MFIQ) was used to assess functional outcome. In a multivariate linear regression analyses, variables related to MFIQ scores (pâ¤0.10) were entered as predictors with MFIQ score as the outcome. Lack of saliva (52%), restricted mouth opening (48%), and restricted tongue mobility (46%) were the most frequently reported oral symptoms. Lack of saliva was most frequently (32%) ranked as the most burdensome oral symptom. For radiated patients, an inability to wear a dental prosthesis, a T3 or T4 stage, and a higher age were predictive of MFIQ scores. For non-radiated patients, a restricted mouth opening, an inability to wear a dental prosthesis, restricted tongue mobility, and surgery of the mandible were predictive of MFIQ scores. Lack of saliva was not only the most frequently reported oral symptom after treatment for oral or oropharyngeal cancer, but also the most burdensome. Functional outcome is strongly influenced by an inability to wear a dental prosthesis in both radiated and non-radiated patients.\n\nRelationships among therapy-related symptoms, depressive symptoms, and quality of life in Chinese children hospitalized with cancer: an exploratory study.\n\nPubMed\n\nLi, Ho Cheung William; Williams, Phoebe D; Lopez, Violeta; Chung, Joyce Oi Kwan; Chiu, Sau Ying\n\n2013-01-01\n\nRecent advances in cancer screening and treatment have resulted in a decrease in mortality rates in children and adolescents. However, despite the improved prognosis, the course of cancer treatment continues to be a very stressful experience in the life of a child. The objectives of the study were to assess the occurrence and severity of treatment-related symptoms manifested by children and adolescents undergoing active cancer treatment and to examine the relationships between therapy-related symptoms, depressive symptoms, and quality of life of these pediatric patients. A cross-sectional study design was used, and 135 Hong Kong Chinese children (9- to 16-year-olds) who were admitted for treatment of cancer in a pediatric oncology unit were invited to participate in the study. Results indicated that children and adolescents receiving combined cancer treatment generally experienced greater symptom occurrence and severity. In addition, children reporting greater symptom occurrence and severity experienced higher levels of depression and a lower level of quality of life. The study revealed that therapy-related symptoms are a strong predictor of quality of life of children and adolescents hospitalized for cancer treatment. Cancer and its treatments significantly affect the psychosocial well-being and quality of life of children and adolescent hospitalized for cancer care. Therapy-related symptoms can be a useful indicator for screening those pediatric patients who are likely to exhibit psychosocial distress or are at high risk of depression. It is essential for nurses to be sensitive and knowledgeable about the therapy-related symptoms of cancer treatment and their effects on children and adolescents to promote the psychosocial well-being of these patients and enhance their quality of life.\n\nMolecular epidemiology, cancer-related symptoms, and cytokines pathway\n\nPubMed Central\n\nReyes-Gibby, Cielito C; Wu, Xifeng; Spitz, Margaret; Kurzrock, Razelle; Fisch, Michael; Bruera, Eduardo; Shete, Sanjay\n\n2012-01-01\n\nThe Human Genome Project and HapMap have led to a better appreciation of the importance of common genetic variation in determining cancer risk, created potential for predicting response to therapy, and made possible the development of targeted prevention and therapeutic interventions. Advances in molecular epidemiology can be used to explore the role of genetic variation in modulating the risk for severe and persistent symptoms, such as pain, depression, and fatigue, in patients with cancer. The same genes that are implicated in cancer risk might also be involved in the modulation of therapeutic outcomes. For example, polymorphisms in several cytokine genes are potential markers for genetic susceptibility both for cancer risk and for cancer-related symptoms. These genetic polymorphisms are stable markers and easily and reliably assayed to explore the extent to which genetic variation might prove useful in identifying patients with cancer at high-risk of symptom development. Likewise, they could identify subgroups who might benefit most from symptom intervention, and contribute to developing personalised and more effective therapies for persistent symptoms. PMID:18672213\n\nParents' perceptions of their children's cancer-related symptoms during treatment: a prospective, longitudinal study.\n\nPubMed\n\nPÃ¶der, Ulrika; Ljungman, Gustaf; von Essen, Louise\n\n2010-11-01\n\nThis article describes a comprehensive assessment of treatment-related symptoms in children aged 0-18 years undergoing cancer treatment from the perspective of their parents. The aim was to describe which symptoms that, according to parents, cause most problems for children receiving cancer treatment and to explore whether there is a relationship between parents' ratings of their children's symptoms and their own post-traumatic stress at one week (T1), two months (T2), and four months (T3) after a child's cancer diagnosis. In total, 214 parents (107 mothers and 107 fathers) of 115 children answered a modified version of the Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale 10-18 and the PTSD Checklist Civilian Version over the telephone at T1-T3. According to parents, the following symptom areas cause the most problems for children undergoing cancer treatment: emotional distress, fatigue, nutrition, and pain. Pain is the most problematic area. The prevalence of most symptoms and the symptom burden decreases over time. Parents' ratings of their children's symptom burden and their own emotional distress, and mothers' and fathers' ratings of their child's symptom burden, are associated. Parents of adolescents report a greater symptom burden for their child than the parents of the youngest children. The opinions of both the patient and the parent are important in pediatrics. The results of this study can be used to guide health care professionals within pediatric oncology in their discussions of cancer treatment's adverse effects with patients and families. Not only the expectations and potential interventions but also the sources of worry should be discussed. Copyright Â© 2010 U.S. Cancer Pain Relief Committee. Published by Elsevier Inc.

This study was conducted in a palliative care unit in Taiwan between October 2004 and December 2009. Symptom intensity was measured by the \"Symptom Reporting Form\", and graded on a scale of 0 to 4 (0â=ânone, and 4â=âextreme). These measures were assessed on the 1(st), 3(rd), 5(th), and 7(th) Day in the palliative care unit. The study data comprised routine clinical records and patients' demographic data. Generalized estimating equation (GEE) was used to assess the symptom improvement, and investigate the factors associated with the symptom reporting form scores. Among the 824 recruited patients with advanced cancer, pain (78.4%), anorexia (64.4%) and constipation (63.5%) were the most common and severe symptom. After controlling for other factors in the multivariate GEE model, the day of palliative care administration was a significant factor associated with all of the scales, except Days 7 on the dyspnoea and oedema scales and Day 5 on the anxiety scale. In addition, patients agedââ¥â65 years exhibited significantly lower scores on the pain, sleep disturbance, depression, and anxiety scales than did those agedâ<â65 years. Moreover, female patients exhibited higher scores on the vomiting, anorexia, oedema, depression, and anxiety scales than did male patients. Furthermore, patients with gastrointestinal tract cancer exhibited higher scores on the constipation, vomiting, anorexia, oedema, depression, and anxiety scales and lower scores on the dyspnoea scale than did those with lung cancer. Patients with breast cancer exhibited higher scores on the oedema scale and lower scores on the anxiety scale. Patients with genitourinary cancer exhibited higher scores on the vomiting and oedema scales and lower scores on the dyspnoea scale. Patients with head, neck, and oral cancer exhibited lower\n\nBreast Cancer Survivorsâ Experiences of Lymphedema-Related Symptoms\n\nPubMed Central\n\nFu, Mei Rosemary; Rosedale, Mary\n\n2009-01-01\n\nThe purpose of this study was to explore and describe breast cancer survivorsâ lymphedema-related symptom experiences. As a serious chronic condition from breast cancer treatment, lymphedema, or persistent swelling, is caused by chronic accumulation of lymph fluid in the interstitial spaces of the affected limb or surrounding areas. While significant prevalence of ongoing multiple symptoms have been reported, little is known about how survivors with lymphedema perceive and respond to lymphedema-related symptoms in their daily lives. This study employed a descriptive phenomenological method. Thirty-four participants were recruited in the US. Three in-depth interviews were conducted with each participant; a total of 102 interviews were completed, audio-taped, and transcribed. Interview transcripts and field notes were the data sources for this analysis, which was part of three larger studies. Data were analyzed to identify the essential themes within and across cases. Four essential themes were revealed: living with perpetual discomfort; confronting the unexpected; losing pre-lymphedema being; and feeling handicapped. Participants experienced multiple symptoms on a daily basis. Distress was heightened when women expected symptoms to disappear but instead they remained as a âperpetual discomfort.â Moreover, distress was intensified when symptoms evoked unexpected situations or when symptoms elicited emotional responses powerful enough to change perceived personal identity. Findings suggest that symptom distress may encompass temporal, situational and attributive dimensions. Prospective studies are needed to examine lymphedema-related symptom distress in terms of these dimensions so that more specific interventions can be developed to target distress occurring in each dimension.

The best way to measure it, however, remains unsettled. The SF-36 vitality scale, a general measure of energy/fatigue, is a frequently cited measure. With only four items, however, its ability to adequately represent multiple CRF facets has been questioned. The 13-item Fatigue Symptom Inventory (FSI) was developed to assess multidimensional aspects of CRF. Our objectives were to assess the convergent validity and to compare the sensitivity to change of the two scales. We administered both scales at 1Â month (nâ=â68) and 6Â months (nâ=â96) to a subset of heterogeneous patients receiving treatment in 16 cancer centers who were enrolled in a clinical trial of pain and depression. Distributions of standardized response means (SRMs) were compared to assess sensitivity to change. Results of both scales were compared to scores on a single fatigue item from the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ). Mean scores for both the FSI and the vitality scale demonstrated clinically significant fatigue in the sample. The vitality scale was strongly correlated with all three FSI scales (râ=â-0.68 to -0.77). The vitality and FSI scales also correlated strongly with the PHQ fatigue item. Moreover, distributions of SRMs for both scales were approximately normal. Both the FSI and the vitality scale are supported as valid measures of CRF. Both demonstrated sensitivity to change across a range of effect sizes. The vitality scale may be an excellent choice when brevity is paramount; the FSI may be more appropriate when tapping specific dimensions is warranted.\n\nSymptom incidence, distress, cancer-related distress, and adherence to chemotherapy among African American women with breast cancer.\n\nPubMed\n\nYee, Melissa K; Sereika, Susan M; Bender, Catherine M; Brufsky, Adam M; Connolly, Mary C; Rosenzweig, Margaret Q\n\n2017-06-01\n\nThere is a persistent racial survival disparity between African American (AA) and white women with breast cancer. There is evidence that symptom incidence, associated distress, and overall cancer-related distress may be unexplored, important contributing factors. The purpose of the current study was to: 1) describe and compare the number of chemotherapy-related symptoms and associated distress among AA women with breast cancer over the course of chemotherapy at 3 time points (at baseline before initiating chemotherapy, midpoint, and at the completion of chemotherapy); and 2) to describe the relationship between the number of chemotherapy-related symptoms and overall cancer distress compared with the ability to receive at least 85% of the prescribed chemotherapy within the prescribed timeframe. Descriptive, comparative, and correlational analyses of symptom incidence, symptom distress, cancer-related distress, and prescribed chemotherapy dose received among a cohort of AA women receiving chemotherapy for breast cancer were performed. AA women (121 women) experienced worsening symptoms from baseline to midpoint in chemotherapy and then stabilized for the duration of therapy. The inability to receive 85% of the prescribed chemotherapy within a prescribed time point was found to be significantly correlated with midpoint symptom distress. The main findings of the current study were that AA women experience a deterioration in symptom distress over the course of chemotherapy from baseline (before chemotherapy) to the midpoint, which was found to be associated with less adherence to chemotherapy overall. Thus, the incidence and management of physical and emotional symptoms, as measured through a multidimensional symptom measurement tool, may be contributing to breast cancer dose disparity and should be explored further.

Self-report questionnaires were distributed to 753 outpatients receiving â§ 4 weeks of treatment at an outpatient chemotherapy center. Valid responses were returned by 638 patients (response rate, 84.7%). Participants were questioned about 57 appearance-related symptoms (AS) and 23 non-appearance-related physical symptoms (non-AS); psychological well-being was assessed using a shortened version of the Derriford Appearance Scale 59. Questionnaire responses were obtained from 264 male and 374 female patients (mean age, 59.5 years; range, 18-85 years). Most respondents (80.3%) were concerned with changes in appearance resulting from treatment. By sex and disease type, women suffered more than men, and treatment for breast cancer created the greatest distress for women. Cancer patients are concerned about a variety of AS, and these may result in greater distress than non-AS. AS-related information and care are increasingly being sought in advance of treatment.

A report from the Cancer Care Outcomes Research and Surveillance (CanCORS) Consortium.\n\nPubMed\n\nKenzik, Kelly M; Ganz, Patricia A; Martin, Michelle Y; Petersen, Laura; Hays, Ron D; Arora, Neeraj; Pisu, Maria\n\n2015-08-15\n\nThe objective of this study was to examine associations of symptoms with physical and mental health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) and in patients with lung cancer. Patients with newly diagnosed CRC (n = 3040) or lung cancer (n = 2297) who were participating in the Cancer Care Outcomes Research and Surveillance Consortium study completed surveys on general HRQOL and symptoms. HRQOL was measured by using physical component summary (PCS) and mental component summary (MCS) scores on the Medical Outcomes Study 12-item short-form heath survey. Nonspecific cancer symptoms were measured using items from the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer core quality-of-life questionnaire. Cancer type-specific modules developed by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer were used to assess CRC-specific and lung cancer-specific symptoms. For both cancer types, linear regression models that were controlled for demographic and clinical information were used to examine correlations of nonspecific and cancer-specific symptoms with PCS and MCS scores. PCS scores for patients with CRC and lung cancer were below the general population norm of 50 (43 and 37, respectively), and MCS scores were at the population norm. For the CRC sample, in the model that included both symptom indices, an increase in nonspecific symptoms was more strongly associated with lower PCS and MCS scores than an increase in CRC-specific symptoms (PCS, standardized coefficient [Î²]â=â-0.41 vs -0.09; MCS, Î² =â-0.38 vs -0.08). In a similar model for lung cancer, increases in lung cancer-specific symptoms were more strongly associated with lower PCS scores (Î² =â-0.34 vs -0.20), whereas nonspecific symptoms were more strongly associated with lower MCS scores (Î² =â-0.34 vs -0.14). Symptoms were associated with HRQOL impairments in recently diagnosed patients.

To show that information on repeated assessments of symptom severity improves predictions for risk of death and to use updated symptom information for determining whether worsening of symptom scores is associated with a higher hazard of death. This was a province-based longitudinal study of adult outpatients who had a cancer diagnosis and had assessments of symptom severity. We implemented a time-to-death Cox model with a time-varying covariate for each symptom to account for changing symptom scores over time. This model was compared with that using only a time-fixed (baseline) covariate for each symptom. The regression coefficients of each model were derived based on a randomly selected 60% of patients, and then, the predictive performance of each model was assessed via concordance probabilities when applied to the remaining 40% of patients. This study had 66,112 patients diagnosed with cancer and more than 310,000 assessments of symptoms. The use of repeated assessments of symptom scores improved predictions for risk of death compared with using only baseline symptom scores. Increased pain and fatigue and reduced appetite were the strongest predictors for death. If available, researchers should consider including changing information on symptom scores, as opposed to only baseline information on symptom scores, when examining hazard of death among patients with cancer. Worsening of pain, fatigue, and appetite may be a flag for impending death. Copyright Â© 2014 American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine. Published by Elsevier Inc.

In the US alone, some 2 million breast cancer survivors comprise 20% of all cancer survivors. Conservatively, it is estimated that some 20-40% of all breast cancer survivors will develop the health deviation of lymphedema or treatment-related limb swelling over their lifetimes. This chronic accumulation of protein-rich fluid predisposes to infection, leads to difficulties in fitting clothing and carrying out activities of daily living, and impacts self-esteem, self-concept, and quality of life. Lymphedema is associated with self-care deficits (SCD) and negatively impacts self-care agency (SCA) and physiological and psychosocial well-being. Objectives of this report are two-fold: (1) to explore four approaches of assessing and diagnosing breast cancer lymphedema, including self-report of symptoms and the impact of health deviations on SCA; and (2) to propose the development of a clinical research program for lymphedema based on the concepts of Self-Care Deficit Nursing Theory (SCDNT). Anthropometric and symptom data from a National-Institutes-of-Health-funded prospective longitudinal study were examined using survival analysis to compare four definitions of lymphedema over 24 months post-breast cancer surgery among 140 of 300 participants (all who had passed the 24-month measurement). The four definitions included differences of 200 ml, 10% volume, and 2 cm circumference between pre-op baseline and/or contralateral limbs, and symptom self-report of limb heaviness and swelling. Symptoms, SCA, and SCD were assessed by interviews using a validated tool. Estimates of lymphedema occurrence varied by definition and time since surgery. The 2 cm girth change provided the highest estimation of lymphedema (82% at 24 months), followed by 200 ml volume change (57% at 24 months). The 10% limb volume change converged with symptom report of heaviness and swelling at 24 months\n\nSymptom clusters in advanced cancer.\n\nPubMed\n\nJimÃ©nez, Ana; Madero, Rosario; Alonso, Alberto; MartÃ­nez-MarÃ­n, Virginia; Vilches, Yolanda; MartÃ­nez, Beatriz; Feliu, Marta; DÃ­az, Leyre; Espinosa, Enrique; Feliu, Jaime\n\n2011-07-01\n\nPatients with advanced cancer often experience multiple concurrent symptoms. Few studies have explored symptom clusters (SCs) in this population. The aim of the present study was to explore SCs in advanced cancer, evaluate the characteristics associated with various clusters, and determine their relationship to survival. This study included patients in the palliative care program of the Hospital Universitario La Paz from 2003 to 2005. The Edmonton Symptom Assessment System and a supplement including 13 other symptoms were used to detect symptoms. Principal component analysis was performed to determine symptom relationships and compare SCs with associated parameters. In total, 406 patients were included, 61% men and 39% women. The median age was 66.4 (range 18-95). The most common primaries were gastrointestinal (35%), lung (25%), genitourinary (8%), breast (5%), and head and neck (5%) carcinomas. The following clusters were identified: confusion (cognitive impairment, agitation, urinary incontinence), neuropsychological (anxiety, depression, and insomnia), anorexia-cachexia (anorexia, weight loss, and tiredness), and gastrointestinal (nausea and vomiting). The presence of these SCs was influenced by primary cancer site, gender, age, and performance status. Survival was related to the number of SCs present in a given patient: zero SC, 52 days; one SC, 38 days; two SCs, 23 days; and three to four SCs, 19 days; P < 0.001. Different SCs can be identified in patients with advanced cancer. These SCs are influenced by primary cancer site, gender, age, and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, and they can have prognostic value.

The challenge for clinicians and researchers alike is to assess symptoms, and to determine the symptom distress associated with the symptoms and the patient's ability for symptom management without a lengthy and burdensome assessment process. The objective of this article was to discuss the psychometric evaluation of a brief general symptom distress scale (GSDS) developed to assess specific symptoms and how they rank in relation to each other, the overall symptom distress associated with the symptom schema, and provide an assessment of how well or poorly that symptom schema is managed. Results from a pilot study about the initial development of the GSDS with 76 hospitalized patients are presented, followed by a more complete psychometric evaluation of the GSDS using three samples of cancer patients (n=190) and their social network members, called partners in these studies (n=94). Descriptive statistics were used to describe the GSDS symptoms, symptom distress, and symptom management. Point biserial correlations indexed the associations between dichotomous symptoms and continuous measures, and conditional probabilities were used to illustrate the substantial comorbidities of this sample. Internal consistency was examined using the KR-20 coefficient, and test-retest reliability was examined. Construct validity and predictive validity also were examined. The GSDS demonstrated satisfactory internal consistency and test-retest reliability, and good construct validity and predictive validity. The total score on the GSDS, symptom distress, and symptom management correlated significantly with related constructs of depression, positive and negative affect, and general health. The GSDS was able to demonstrate its ability to distinguish between those with or without chronic illness, and was able to significantly predict scores on\n\nSymptom Burden in Cancer Survivors One Year after Diagnosis: A Report from the American Cancer Societyâs Studies of Cancer Survivors\n\nPubMed Central\n\nShi, Qiuling; Smith, Tenbroeck G.; Michonski, Jared D.; Stein, Kevin D.; Kaw, Chiew Kwei; Cleeland, Charles S.\n\n2011-01-01\n\nBackground Few studies have examined risk for severe symptoms during early cancer survivorship. Using baseline data from the American Cancer Societyâs Study of Cancer Survivors-I, we examined cancer survivors with high symptom burden, identified risk factors associated with high symptom burden, and evaluated the impact of high symptom burden on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) 1 year post-diagnosis. Methods Participants were enrolled from 11 state cancer registries approximately 1 year after diagnosis and surveyed by telephone or mail. Outcomes measures were the Modified Rotterdam Symptom Checklist and Profile of Mood States-37 (to assess symptom burden) and the Satisfaction with Life Domains Scale-Cancer (to assess HRQoL). Results Of 4903 survivors, 4512 (92%) reported symptoms related to their cancer and/or its treatment. Two-step clustering yielded 2 sub-groups, one with low symptom burden (n=3113) and one with high symptom burden (n=1399). Variables associated with high symptom burden included metastatic cancer (odds ratio [OR], 2.05), number of comorbid conditions (OR, 1.76), remaining on active chemotherapy (OR, 1.93), younger age (OR, 2.31), lacking insurance/being underinsured (OR, 1.57), having lower income (OR, 1.61), being unemployed (OR, 1.27), or being less educated (OR, 1.29). Depression, fatigue, and pain had the greatest impact on HRQoL in survivors with high symptom burden, who also had lower HRQoL (P < .0001). Conclusions More than 1 in 4 cancer survivors had high symptom burden 1 year post-diagnosis, even after treatment termination. These results indicate a need for continued symptom monitoring and management in early posttreatment survivorship, especially for the underserved.

Evidence suggests that they often feel left alone or unprepared to do so. This qualitative study explores how patients deal with chemotherapy-related symptoms in their home, which factors and ideas influence their self-management and what role professional caregivers play. One-off, semi-structured interviews were held with 28 adult patients with cancer being treated with chemotherapy. Using a Grounded Theory approach, we cyclically collected and analysed data to come to a thorough understanding of the major conceptual themes and their interconnections. Dealing with chemotherapy-related symptoms involves a process of experiencing and learning how side effects unfold over time and how to deal with them. Patients express very personal symptom experiences and symptom-management styles, which are shaped by personal factors (e.g. coping with cancer and cancer treatment, perceived level of control) and environmental factors (e.g. professionals' attitude, information resources). Improving symptom self-management support requires active exploration of the personal symptom experience and symptom-management style. Professional care should be tailored to the patient's perspective and should address personal and environmental determinants of their behaviour.

The aim of this paper is to obtain the views of general practitioners (GPs) in relation to symptom-based detection of ovarian cancer and to assess their knowledge for family history of breast and/or ovarian cancer as a predisposing factor for ovarian cancer. In this questionnaire survey, postal questionnaires were sent to 402âGPs in 132 primary care clinics, out of which we obtained 110 replies (27.4%). Approximately 26% of respondent GPs thought that the symptoms were more likely to be frequent, sudden, and persistent, and one-fifth were unsure of the importance of family history of breast cancer in relation to ovarian cancer. The participant GPs scored a set of symptoms for their relevance to ovarian cancer from 0 (not relevant) to 10 (most relevant). The highest scored symptoms were abdominal swelling (mean Â± SD, 8.19 Â± 2.33), abdominal bloating (7.01 Â± 3.01), and pelvic pain (7.46 Â± 2.26). There was a relative lack of awareness for repetitive symptoms as well as gastrointestinal symptoms as an important feature in a symptom-based detection of ovarian cancer.\n\nSymptoms and Risk Factors of Ovarian Cancer: A Survey in Primary Care\n\nPubMed Central\n\nGajjar, Ketan; Ogden, Gemma; Mujahid, M.

A Greenlandic version of the EORTC QLQ-C30 v.3.0 was developed. The translation process included independent forward translation, reconciliation and independent back translation by native Greenlandic-speaking translators who were fluent in English. After pilot testing, a population-based cross-sectional study of patients with advanced cancer receiving palliative treatment was conducted. Internal consistency was examined by calculating Cronbach's alpha coefficients for five function scales and three symptom scales. Of the 58 patients who participated in the study, 47% had reduced social functioning, 36% had reduced physical and role functioning and 19% had reduced emotional and cognitive functioning. Furthermore, 48% reported fatigue, and 33% reported financial problems. The Greenlandic version of the EORTC had good applicability in the assessment of symptoms and quality of life. Acceptable Cronbach's alpha coefficients (above 0.70) were observed for the physical, role and social functioning scales, the fatigue scale and the global health status scale. Patients with undergoing palliative treatment in Greenland for advanced cancer reported high levels of social and financial problems and reduced physical functioning. This indicates a potential for improving palliative care service and increasing the focus on symptom management. The Greenlandic version of the EORTC-QLQ-C30 represents an applicable and reliable tool to describe symptoms and health-related quality of life among Greenlandic patients with advanced cancer.

Hypnotic Induction Profile Scores were dichotomized into low and high categories; posttraumatic intrusion and avoidance symptoms were measured with the Impact of Events Scale (IES); hyperarousal symptoms with items from the Profile of Mood States; and depressive symptoms with the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale. High hypnotizability was significantly related to greater IES total, IES intrusion symptoms, and depressive symptoms. A logistic regression model showed that IES total predicts high hypnotizability after adjusting for depressive symptoms and hyperarousal. The authors relate these results to findings in other clinical populations and discuss implications for the psychosocial treatment of metastatic breast cancer.\n\nRole of nuclear factor-ÎºB-mediated inflammatory pathways in cancer-related symptoms and their regulation by nutritional agents\n\nPubMed Central\n\nGupta, Subash C; Kim, Ji Hye; Kannappan, Ramaswamy; Reuter, Simone; Dougherty, Patrick M; Aggarwal, Bharat B\n\n2011-01-01\n\nCancer is a disease characterized by dysregulation of multiple genes and is associated with symptoms such as cachexia, anorexia, fatigue, depression, neuropathic pain, anxiety, cognitive impairment, sleep disorders and delirium (acute confusion state) in medically ill patients. These symptoms are caused by either the cancer itself or the cancer treatment. During the past decade, increasing evidence has shown that the dysregulation of inflammatory pathways contributes to the expression of these symptoms. Cancer patients have been found to have higher levels of proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-6. The nuclear factor (NF)- ÎºB is a major mediator of inflammatory pathways. Therefore, anti-inflammatory agents that can modulate the NF-ÎºB activation and inflammatory pathways may have potential in improving cancer-related symptoms in patients. Because of their multitargeting properties, low cost, low toxicity and immediate availability, natural agents have gained considerable attention for prevention and treatment of cancer-related symptoms. How NF-ÎºB and inflammatory pathways contribute to cancer-related symptoms is the focus of this review. We will also discuss how nutritional agents such as curcumin, genistein, resveratrol, epigallocatechin gallate and lycopene can modulate inflammatory pathways and thereby reduce cancer-related symptoms in patients.

Cut points are used to determine if scores represent clinically relevant burden. The aim of this systematic review was to explore the evidence on cut points for the symptoms of the Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale. Relevant literature was searched in PubMed, CINAHLÂ®, Embase, and PsycINFOÂ®. We defined a cut point as the lower bound of the scores representing moderate or severe burden. Eighteen articles were eligible for this review. Cut points were determined using the interference with daily life, another symptom-related method, or a verbal scale. For pain, cut point 5 and, to a lesser extent, cut point 7 were found as the optimal cut points for moderate pain and severe pain, respectively. For moderate tiredness, the best cut point seemed to be cut point 4. For severe tiredness, both cut points 7 and 8 were suggested frequently. A lack of evidence exists for nausea, depression, anxiety, drowsiness, appetite, well-being, and shortness of breath. Few studies suggested a cut point below 4. For many symptoms, there is no clear evidence as to what the optimal cut points are. In daily clinical practice, a symptom score â¥4 is recommended as a trigger for a more comprehensive symptom assessment. Until there is more evidence on the optimal cut points, we should hold back using a certain cut point in quality indicators and be cautious about strongly recommending a certain cut point in guidelines.

Sixty nine subjects reconstructed pivotal events beginning with symptom onset and ending with medical consultation, and completed the Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI) and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). The mean delay time was around 6 months, with about 1 out of 6 subjects waiting one year or more. Subjects estimated the lengths of two sequential segments of total time to consultation: (1) Symptom Appraisal time (from symptom onset to recognition of possible seriousness), and (2) Action Appraisal time (from recognition of seriousness to medical consultation). Symptom Appraisal time accounted for over two-thirds of total time and was associated with low scores on the TCI Harm Avoidance scale (TCI-HA), indicating dispositional insensitivity to threat, and marginally associated with less education and younger age. Action Appraisal time was not associated with any demographic or psychological variables. Low TCI-HA scores were also associated with lower likelihood of previous cancer screening, and with better judgments of premorbid health. Low STAI Trait scores were associated with better judgments of premorbid health and fewer doctor visits. Results are discussed regarding the importance of understanding dispositional characteristics related to health behavior.

The need for long-term stenting makes the quality of life of cancer patients one of the challenging problems of modern urology. The aim of this study was to optimize treatment of stent-related symptoms in cancer patients with internal long-term stents by complementing the treatment regimen with m-anticholinergic solifenacin. From November 2013 to November 2015 68 cancer patients (26 males, 42 females, age 36-79 years) underwent elective internal ureteral stenting for drainage of the upper urinary tract (UUT) with special long-term stents coated with the hydrogel. The urinary tract obstruction was caused by urological (24), gynecological (26) and colorectal (18) cancers. Before deciding on urinary tract drainage, all patients were treated with radiation or chemotherapy, 28 (41.2%) patients underwent surgery, but on admission all of them had contraindications to radical surgery for different reasons. In 52 (76.5%) patients UUT stenting was performed using transurethral access, in 12 (17.6%) by percutaneous access and in another 4 (5.9%) by the combined access with patients in the supine position. Percutaneous and combined access was used in cases of impracticability (failure) of transurethral stenting. Patients in group 1 (n=32) after stent placement received standard therapy co-administered with solifenacin 5 mg daily, group 2 (n=36) - only standard therapy. The data analyzed were the technical features of the internal drainage, optimal access and registered solifenacin-related adverse events. Control examinations were scheduled once in 3 months after stent placement according to the following algorithm: ultrasound scanning, laboratory test monitoring and, if indicated, plain urography. To objectify the severity of stent-related symptoms, a survey of patients using a special\n\nSymptom clusters and related factors in bladder cancer patients three months after radical cystectomy.\n\nPubMed\n\nRen, Hongyan; Tang, Ping; Zhao, Qinghua; Ren, Guosheng\n\n2017-08-23\n\nTo identify symptom distress and clusters in patients 3Â months after radical cystectomy and to explore their potential predictors. A cross-sectional design was used to investigate 99 bladder cancer patients 3Â months after radical cystectomy. Data were collected by demographic and disease characteristic questionnaires, the symptom experience scale of the M.D. Anderson symptom inventory, two additional symptoms specific to radical cystectomy, and the functional assessment of cancer therapy questionnaire. A factor analysis, stepwise regression, and correlation analysis were applied. Three symptom clusters were identified: fatigue-malaise, gastrointestinal, and psycho-urinary. Age, complication severity, albumin post-surgery (negative), orthotropic neobladder reconstruction, adjuvant chemotherapy and American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) scores were significant predictors of fatigue-malaise. Adjuvant chemotherapy, orthotropic neobladder reconstruction, female gender, ASA scores and albumin (negative) were significant predictors of gastrointestinal symptoms. Being unmarried, having a higher educational level and complication severity were significant predictors of psycho-urinary symptoms. The correlations between clusters and for each cluster with quality of life were significant, with the highest correlation observed between the psycho-urinary cluster and quality of life. Bladder cancer patients experience concurrent symptoms that appear to cluster and are significantly correlated with quality of life. Moreover, symptom clusters may be predicted by certain demographic and clinical characteristics.\n\nAssociations among menopausal symptoms, sleep and fatigue in Taiwanese women with endometrial cancer.\n\nPubMed\n\nLi, Chia-Chun; Tsai, Yun-Fang; Chang, Ting-Chang; Chen, Lynn\n\n2017-09-01\n\nThe purpose of this study was to explore the relationships among menopausal symptoms, sleep quality and fatigue in women with endometrial cancer. Participants were 95 women (mean ageÂ =Â 57.44Â Â±Â 10.15Â years) diagnosed with endometrial cancer and who had completed their treatment before data collection. Each woman completed three structured questionnaires: the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Endocrine Symptoms (endocrine symptom subscale), the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue. Participants' worst menopausal symptom was sexual pain. In addition, menopausal symptoms were worse in women with surgical menopause than with natural menopause. The majority of women had poor sleep quality (55%), and women with fatigue reported worse sleep quality and menopausal symptoms than those without fatigue. However, higher fatigue was significantly related to shorter time since diagnosis. Together, three variables (time since diagnosis, menopausal symptoms and sleep quality) explained 39% of the variance in fatigue, with menopausal symptoms being the strongest predictor. Healthcare providers can assess menopausal symptoms and sleep quality during and after treatment of women with endometrial cancer. Such assessments would allow timely interventions to alleviate fatigue and menopausal symptoms in this population, thus improving their quality of life.

Few studies have examined breast cancer symptom clusters during treatment, and fewer studies have addressed symptom clusters during radiation therapy (RT). The theoretical underpinning of this study is the Symptoms Experience Model. Research is needed to identify antecedents and consequences of cancer-related symptom clusters. The present study was intended to determine the clustering of symptoms during RT in women with breast cancer and significant correlations among the symptoms, individual characteristics, and mood. A secondary data analysis from a descriptive correlational study of 93 women at weeks 3 to 7 of RT from centers in the mid-Atlantic region of the United States, Symptom Distress Scale, the subscales of the Positive and Negative Affect Scale, Life Orientation Test, and Self-transcendence Scale were completed. Confirmatory factor analysis revealed symptoms grouped into 3 distinct clusters: pain-insomnia-fatigue, cognitive disturbance-outlook, and gastrointestinal. The pain-insomnia-fatigue and cognitive disturbance-outlook clusters were associated with individual characteristics, optimism, self-transcendence, and positive and negative mood. The gastrointestinal cluster correlated significantly only with positive mood. This study provides insight into symptoms that group together and the relationship of symptom clusters to antecedents and mood. These findings underscore the need to define and standardize the measurement of symptom clusters and understand variability in concurrent symptoms. Attention to symptom clusters shifts the clinical focus from a specific symptom to the patient's experience as a whole and helps identify the most effective interventions.\n\nCancer-Related Post-traumatic Stress (PDQÂ®)âHealth Professional Version\n\nCancer.gov\n\nExpert-reviewed information summary about post-traumatic stress and related symptoms in cancer patients, cancer survivors, and their family members.

According to the biobehavioral model of cancer stress and disease, life stress during diagnosis and treatment may negatively influence the trajectory of women's physical health-related adjustment to breast cancer. This longitudinal study examined chronic and episodic stress as predictors of bothersome physical symptoms during the year after breast cancer diagnosis. Women diagnosed with breast cancer in the previous 4Â months (NÂ =Â 460) completed a life stress interview for contextual assessment of chronic and episodic stress severity at study entry and 9Â months later. Physical symptom bother (e.g., pain, fatigue) was measured at study entry, every 6Â weeks through 6Â months, and at nine and 12Â months. In multilevel structural equation modeling (MSEM) analyses, both chronic stress and episodic stress occurring shortly after diagnosis predicted greater physical symptom bother over the study period. Episodic stress reported to have occurred prior to diagnosis did not predict symptom bother in MSEM analyses, and the interaction between chronic and episodic stress on symptom bother was not significant. Results suggest that ongoing chronic stress and episodic stress occurring shortly after breast cancer diagnosis are important predictors of bothersome symptoms during and after cancer treatment. Screening for chronic stress and recent stressful life events in the months following diagnosis may help to identify breast cancer patients at risk for persistent and bothersome physical symptoms. Interventions to prevent or ameliorate treatment-related physical symptoms may confer added benefit by addressing ongoing non-cancer-related stress in women's lives.\n\nChronic and episodic stress predict physical symptom bother following breast cancer diagnosis\n\nPubMed Central\n\nBauer, Margaret R.; Wiley, Joshua F.; Hammen, Constance; Krull, Jennifer L.; Crespi, Catherine M.; Weihs, Karen L.; Stanton, Annette L.\n\n2017-01-01\n\nBreast cancer patients often experience adverse physical side effects of medical treatments.

The Kappa subscale was also evaluated and values were 0.84 for high frequency physic symptoms, 0.81 for low frequency physical symptoms, 0.81 for psychological symptoms, and 0.78 for Global Distress Index. High level of reliability estimated suggests that the process of measurement of Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale aspects was adequate.

In cooperation with a health management company, using a patient experience co-design, we developed the platform operated by an interactive application for reporting and managing symptoms in real time. Nine patients diagnosed with prostate cancer and receiving radiotherapy were recruited from two university hospitals in Sweden. Evidence-based symptoms and related self-care advice specific to prostate cancer were implemented in the application based on a literature review and interviews with patients and health care professionals. In the test of the platform the patients reported symptoms, via a mobile phone, daily for two weeks and were afterwards interviewed about their experiences. Overall, the patients found the symptom questionnaire and the self-care advice relevant and the application user friendly. The alert system was activated on several occasions when the symptoms were severe leading to a nurse contact and support so the patients felt safe and well cared for. The platform enabled increased patient involvement and facilitated symptom assessment and communication between the patient and the health care provider. The study's results support further development of the platform, as well as tests in full-scale studies and in other populations. Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

However, multiple clinical domains contribute to the phenotype of cancer anorexia. The characterization of the clinical and molecular pathophysiology of cancer anorexia may enhance the efficacy of preventive and therapeutic strategies. Clinical trials showed that cancer anorexia should be considered as an umbrella encompassing different signs and symptoms contributing to appetite disruption in cancer patients. Loss of appetite, early satiety, changes in taste and smell are determinants of cancer anorexia, whose presence should be assessed in cancer patients. Interestingly, neuronal correlates of cancer anorexia-related symptoms have been revealed by brain imaging techniques. The pathophysiology of cancer anorexia is complex and involves different domains influencing eating behavior. Limiting the assessment of cancer anorexia to questions investigating changes in appetite may impede correct identification of the targets to address.\n\nDepressive symptoms predict cancer caregivers' physical health decline.\n\nPubMed\n\nShaffer, Kelly M; Kim, Youngmee; Carver, Charles S; Cannady, Rachel S\n\n2017-11-01\n\nCancer caregiving has been associated with worsening health among caregivers themselves, yet demographic and psychosocial predictors of their long-term health decline are less known. This study examines changes in caregivers' physical health 2 to 8 years after their family members' cancer diagnosis and prospective predictors of that change. Caregivers (n = 664; mean age, 53.2 years) participated in a nationwide study at 2 (T1), 5 (T2), and 8 (T3) years after their family members' cancer diagnosis. Physical health (12-item Medical Outcomes Study Short Form Health Survey Physical Component Scale) was assessed T1 through T3 as outcome. Predictors were self-reported at T1, including caregiver demographics (age, sex, education, income, relationship to patient, and employment status), patient cancer severity (from medical records), and caregiver psychosocial factors (caregiving stress, caregiving esteem, social support, and depressive symptoms). Latent growth modeling tested predictors of caregivers' initial physical health and their physical health change across time. At T1, caregivers reported slightly better physical health than the US population (M = 51.22, P = .002), which declined over the following 6 years (M slope = -0.27, P < .001). All demographic factors, patient cancer severity, and T1 caregiving stress were related to caregivers' initial physical health (P â¤ .03). Higher depressive symptoms were unrelated to caregivers' initial physical health, but were the only significant predictor of caregivers' more rapid physical health decline (B = -0.02, P = .004). Findings highlight the unique contribution of caregivers' depressive symptoms to their physical health decline. Assessing and addressing depressive symptoms among caregivers early in the cancer survivorship trajectory may help to prevent premature health decline among this important yet vulnerable population.

Employed breast cancer survivors (n = 94) and women without a history of cancer (n = 100) completed questionnaires online in a cross-sectional study. A two-cluster solution of high or low symptom severity groups was observed. High symptom cluster was associated with breast cancer (odds ratio [OR] = 2.46; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.22 to 4.93), more frequent job stress (OR = 1.78; 95% CI, 1.12 to 2.83), and lower levels of aerobic activity (OR = 0.55; 95% CI, 0.36 to 0.83). Levels of anxiety, depression, cognitive limitations, and fatigue are expressed as clusters with varying severity. Clusters are related to job stress and aerobic activity in breast cancer survivors at work. Findings suggest avenues for clinical management and research.\n\nComputer-based symptom assessment is feasible in patients with advanced cancer: results from an international multicenter study, the EPCRC-CSA.\n\nPubMed\n\nHjermstad, Marianne Jensen; Lie, Hanne C; Caraceni, Augusto; Currow, David C; Fainsinger, Robin L; Gundersen, Odd Erik; Haugen, Dagny Faksvaag; Heitzer, Ellen; Radbruch, Lukas; Stone, Patrick C; Strasser, Florian; Kaasa, Stein; Loge, Jon HÃ¥vard\n\n2012-11-01\n\nSymptom assessment by computers is only effective if it provides valid results and is perceived as useful for clinical use by the end users: patients and health care providers. To identify factors associated with discontinuation, time expenditure, and patient preferences of the computerized symptom assessment used in an international multicenter data collection project: the European Palliative Care Research Collaborative-Computerized Symptom Assessment. Cancer patients with incurable metastatic or locally advanced disease were recruited from 17 centers in eight countries, providing 1017 records for analyses. Observer-based registrations and patient-reported measures on pain, depression, and physical function were entered on touch screen laptop computers. The entire assessment was completed by 94.9% (n = 965), with median age 63 years (range 18-91 years) and median Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) score of 70 (range 20-100). Predictive factors for noncompletion were higher age, lower KPS, and more pain (P â¤ 0.012). Time expenditure among completers increased with higher age, male gender, Norwegian nationality, number of comorbidities, and lower physical functioning (P â¤ 0.007) but was inversely related to pain levels and tiredness (P â¤ 0.03). Need for assistance was predicted by higher age, nationality other than Norwegian, lower KPS, and lower educational level (P < 0.001). More than 50% of patients preferred computerized assessment to a paper and pencil version. The high completion rate shows that symptom assessment by computers is feasible in patients with advanced cancer. However, reduced performance status reduces compliance and increases the need for assistance. Future work should aim at identifying the minimum set of valid screening questions and refine the software to optimize symptom assessment and reduce respondent burden in frail patients.

This study aimed to identify the patient and disease characteristics of patients with lung cancer experiencing emotional problems and to examine how emotional problems relate to quality of life and symptom burden. A total of 2205 newly diagnosed patients with lung cancer completed questionnaires on emotional problems, quality of life, and symptom burden. Emotional problems at diagnosis were associated with younger age, female gender, current cigarette smoking, current employment, advanced lung cancer disease, surgical or chemotherapy treatment, and a lower Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance score. Additionally, strong associations were found between greater severity of emotional problems, lower quality of life, and greater symptom burden. Certain characteristics place patients with lung cancer at greater risk for emotional problems, which are associated with a reduced quality of life and greater symptom burden. Assessment of the presence of emotional problems at the time of lung cancer diagnosis provides the opportunity to offer tailored strategies for managing negative mood, and for improving the quality of life and symptom burden management of patients with lung cancer.

Baseline assessments included the Patient Generated Subjective Global Assessment (PG-SGA) tool and an amended Symptoms and Concerns Checklist (SCC). Symptom management strategies, written for this project, were instigated. Follow-up SCC scores were collected at 2 and 4 weeks. Forty out of 79 patients referred were recruited; 29/79 (36.7%) were too unwell or had died prior to consent. At baseline, the PG-SGA tool revealed 250 active symptoms associated with ACS. Total PG-SGA score was above 9 for all patients. Predominant interventions involved simple dietary advice and prescription of artificial saliva, mouthwash and prokinetic antiemetics. Median total SCC score improved sequentially from 11 at baseline, to 7 and 4 at first and second review, respectively (visit 1 to 2, p = 0.001; visit 1 to 3, p < 0.001; and visit 2 to 3, p = 0.02). We conclude that patients with ACS are recognised late in their disease and have a considerable burden of active symptoms. A structured approach to assessment and management has a significant impact on symptom burden.\n\nThe Cognitive Symptom Checklist-Work in cancer patients is related with work functioning, fatigue and depressive symptoms: a validation study.\n\nPubMed\n\nDorland, H F; Abma, F I; Roelen, C A M; Smink, A; Feuerstein, M; Amick, B C; Ranchor, A V; BÃ¼ltmann, U\n\n2016-06-01\n\nThe study objectives are to translate the 21-item Cognitive Symptom Checklist-Work (CSC-W21) to Dutch (CSC-W DV) and to validate the CSC-W DV in working cancer patients. The CSC-W21 was cross-culturally translated and adapted to a Dutch version. In this 19-item version, the dichotomous response option was changed to an ordinal five-point scale. A validation study of the CSC-W DV was conducted among cancer patients who had returned to work during or following cancer treatment. Internal consistency (Cronbach's Î±), structural validity (exploratory factor analysis) and construct validity (hypothesis testing) were evaluated. In a cohort of 364 cancer patients, 341 (94Â %) completed the CSC-W DV (aged 50.6âÂ±â8.6Â years, 60Â % women). Exploratory factor analysis revealed two subscales 'working memory' and 'executive function'. The internal consistency of the total scale and subscales was high (Cronbach's Î±â=â0.93-0.95). Hypothesis testing showed that self-reported cognitive limitations at work were related to work functioning (Pâ<â0.001), fatigue (Pâ=â0.001) and depressive symptoms (Pâ<â0.001), but not to self-rated health (Pâ=â0.14). The CSC-W DV showed high internal consistency and reasonable construct validity for measuring work-specific cognitive symptoms in cancer patients. The CSC-W DV was associated in expected ways with work functioning, fatigue and depressive symptoms. It is important to enhance knowledge about cognitive symptoms at work in cancer patients, to guide and support cancer patients as good as possible when they are back at work and to improve their work functioning over time.\n\nComponents of the anorexia-cachexia syndrome: gastrointestinal symptom correlates of cancer anorexia.\n\nPubMed\n\nYavuzsen, Tugba; Walsh, Declan; Davis, Mellar P; Kirkova, Jordanka; Jin, Tao; LeGrand, Susan; Lagman, Ruth; Bicanovsky, Lesley; Estfan, Bassam; Cheema, Bushra; Haddad, Abdo\n\n2009-12-01\n\nCancer-related anorexia is traditionally considered part of a complex but ill-defined anorexia-cachexia syndrome in which anorexia is intimately associated with other gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms and weight loss. We surveyed cancer patients with anorexia to learn more about the relationship between anorexia and these symptoms. A 22-item GI questionnaire assessed the severity of anorexia and the prevalence of concurrent GI symptoms, including taste changes, food aversions, altered sense of smell, and diurnal food intake changes. The relationship between anorexia severity and anticancer therapy and prior menstrual or pregnancy-related appetite changes was also assessed. Ninety-five of 101 patients with anorexia surveyed had complete data. Seventy-eight percent of them had moderate or severe anorexia. Abnormal diurnal appetite variation, taste changes, and food aversions were present in over 50% of all those with anorexia. Judged by the numerical rating scale, the worse the anorexia, the more prevalent were early satiety, constipation, vomiting, and food aversions. Those with more severe anorexia had greater weight loss, and worse performance status. Anorexia severity did not correlate with that during prior menses/pregnancy or antitumor therapy. Evaluation of multiple other GI symptoms is important in understanding the total experience of cancer anorexia. Early satiety, taste changes, food aversions, and altered sense of smell are important accompanying GI symptoms. Most validated anorexia tools do not assess these commonly associated GI symptoms. Future research should develop a comprehensive anorexia symptom questionnaire.\n\nDepressive symptoms and inflammation are independent risk factors of fatigue in breast cancer survivors.\n\nPubMed\n\nXiao, C; Miller, A H; Felger, J; Mister, D; Liu, T; Torres, M A\n\n2017-07-01\n\nPsychosocial and inflammatory factors have been associated with fatigue in breast cancer survivors. Nevertheless, the relative contribution and/or interaction of these factors with cancer-related fatigue have not been well documented. This cross-sectional study enrolled 111 stage 0-III breast cancer patients treated with breast surgery followed by whole breast radiotherapy. Fatigue was measured by the total score of the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory-20. Potential risk factors included inflammatory markers (plasma cytokines and their receptors and C-reactive protein; CRP), depressive symptoms (as assessed by the Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self Reported), sleep (as assessed by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index) and perceived stress (as assessed by the Perceived Stress Scale) as well as age, race, marital status, smoking history, menopause status, endocrine treatment, chemotherapy and cancer stage. Linear regression modeling was employed to examine risk factors of fatigue. Only risk factors with a significance level <0.10 were included in the initial regression model. A post-hoc mediation model using PROCESS SPSS was conducted to examine the association among depressive symptoms, sleep problems, stress, inflammation and fatigue. At 1 year post-radiotherapy, depressive symptoms (p<0.0001) and inflammatory markers (CRP: p = 0.015; interleukin-1 receptor antagonist: p = 0.014; soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor-2: p = 0.009 in separate models) were independent risk factors of fatigue. Mediation analysis showed that depressive symptoms also mediated the associations of fatigue with sleep and stress. Depressive symptoms and inflammation were independent risk factors for cancer-related fatigue at 1 year post-radiotherapy, and thus represent independent treatment targets for this debilitating symptom.\n\nPolycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), related symptoms/sequelae, and breast cancer risk in a population-based case-control study\n\nPubMed Central\n\nKim, Jayeon; Mersereau, Jennifer E.; Khankari, Nikhil; Bradshaw, Patrick T.; McCullough, Lauren E.; Cleveland, Rebecca; Shantakumar, Sumitra; Teitelbuam, Susan L.; Neugut, Alfred I.; Senie, Ruby T.; Gammon, Marilie D.\n\n2016-01-01\n\nPurpose Despite the overlap between the clinical symptoms/sequelae of polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) and many known reproductive risk factors for breast cancer, the relationship between PCOS and breast cancer remains unclear, possibly because of the complex heterogeneity and challenges in diagnosing PCOS over time. We hypothesized that PCOS, specific PCOS-related symptoms/sequelae, or clusters of PCOS-related symptoms/sequelae, may be differentially associated with pre- vs. postmenopausal breast cancer risk. Materials and Methods Cases were 1,508 women newly diagnosed with a first primary in situ or invasive breast, and the 1,556 population-based controls were frequency-matched by age. Results History of physician-diagnosed PCOS was reported by 2.2% (n=67), among whom oral contraceptive (OC) use, irregular menstruation, and infertility due to ovulatory dysfunction were common. Using unconditional logistic regression, adjusted odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) for PCOS were increased for premenopausal [2.74 (1.13, 6.63)], but not post-menopausal breast cancer [0.87 (0.44, 1.71)]. We used cluster analysis to investigate whether risk among all women varied by PCOS-related symptoms/sequelae, such as reproductive irregularities, OC use, and components of insulin resistance. In the cluster analysis, odds ratios were elevated among premenopausal women who had a history of OC use and no ovulatory dysfunction [1.39 (1.03, 1.88)], compared to those with fewer number of PCOS-related symptoms/sequelae. Conclusion PCOS, and associated PCOS-related symptoms/sequelae including OC use, may play a role in the development of premenopausal breast cancer. Our findings require confirmation in studies with a larger number of premenopausal women with systematically applied diagnostic criteria for PCOS.

Less evident is the role which financial difficulties might play in this relationship. We sought to determine if caring for a child with cancer was related to clinically relevant depressive symptoms among parents, whether or not financial difficulties mediated this relationship, and if financial difficulties were independently associated with symptoms of depression among parents of children with cancer. Data are from 215 parents of children diagnosed with cancer or brain tumors (nâ=â75) and a comparison group of parents of healthy children (nâ=â140). Multiple logistic regression analyses were used to assess the factors associated with reporting clinically relevant depressive symptoms. Caring for a child with cancer was associated with increased odds of clinically relevant depressive symptoms in parents (OR = 4.93; 95Â % CI 1.97-12.30), controlling for covariates. The mediating effect of financial burden on this relationship was not statistically significant. However, among parents of children with cancer, negative financial life events increased the likelihood of reporting symptoms of depression (OR = 4.89; 95Â % CI 1.26-18.96). Caring for a child with cancer was associated with depressive symptoms for parents. Financial difficulties were the strongest correlate of these symptoms among parents of children with cancer. Our results suggest that it may not only be the burden of caring for the child with cancer but also the associated financial difficulties that contribute to a higher likelihood of depressive symptoms in parents.\n\nComputerized symptom and quality-of-life assessment for patients with cancer part I: development and pilot testing.\n\nPubMed\n\nBerry, Donna L; Trigg, Lisa J; Lober, William B; Karras, Bryant T; Galligan, Mary L; Austin-Seymour, Mary; Martin, Stephanie\n\n2004-09-01\n\nTo develop and test an innovative computerized symptom and quality-of-life (QOL) assessment for patients with cancer who are evaluated for and treated with radiation therapy. Descriptive, longitudinal prototype development and cross-sectional clinical data. Department of radiation oncology in an urban, academic medical center. 101 outpatients who were evaluated for radiation therapy, able to communicate in English (or through one of many interpreters available at the University of Washington), and competent to understand the study information and give informed consent. Six clinicians caring for the patients in the sample were enrolled. Iterative prototype development was conducted using a standing focus group of clinicians. The software was developed based on survey markup language and implemented in a wireless, Web-based format. Patient participants completed the computerized assessment prior to consultation with the radiation physician. Graphical output pages with flagged areas of symptom distress or troublesome QOL issues were made available to consulting physicians and nurses. Pain intensity, symptoms, QOL, and demographics. Computerized versions of a 0 to 10 Pain Intensity Numerical Scale (PINS), Symptom Distress Scale, and Short Form-8. Focus group recommendations included clinician priorities of brevity, flexibility, and simplicity for both input interface and output and that the assessment output contain color graphic display. Patient participants included 45 women and 56 men with a mean age of 52.7 years (SD = 13.8). Fewer than half of the participants (40%) reported using a computer on a regular basis (weekly or daily). Completion time averaged 7.8 minutes (SD = 3.7). Moderate to high levels of distress were reported more often for fatigue, pain, and emotional issues than for other symptoms or concerns.
