Gustav Rydahl, the newest addition to the Eagle's roster, was acquired from the New York Rangers in exchange for forward Anton Blidh on March 3rd. The 6-foot-3, 209-pound center has played nine seasons in the Swedish Hockey League and is currently in his first season of hockey in North America.

Rydahl made his first appearance in an Eagles sweater with number 36 on his back on Saturday, March 4th against the Calgary Wranglers, after arriving in Colorado at 2 a.m. the morning of the contest.

“It was really fun,” Rydahl said. “It was a long day yesterday, but it was nice to come here. There are some really good teammates here. I’m really excited to be here.”

Rydahl was impressed with the atmosphere of the Budweiser Events Center but was faced with a challenge on the ice…altitude.

The Karlstad, Sweden native said, “It was a good crowd.” “It was really fun to play, but it was a little bit hard because we are so high up. I hope I will get used to [the altitude].”

The elevation is something Rydahl is going to have to adapt to as Loveland, Colorado has an elevation of 4,982’ in comparison to 210’ elevation in Karlstad, Sweden.

Rydahl’s favorite hockey player is a Swedish player who wore number 21 for the Colorado Avalanche. He wore an “A” on his sweater for the Avs from 1997-2004 and goes by the nickname “Peter the Great.”

If you guessed Peter Forsberg, you are correct!

In Rydah’s opinion, “Peter Forsberg worked hard and never quit. He was a really good hockey player who had grit. He is arguably the best Swedish hockey player.”

Rydal looks forward to his time in Colorado and his main goal simply is to “play some good hockey.”
