        "text": "Delhi Metro is the largest and busiest Metro rail system in our country and only the second oldest Metro rail after Kolkata Metro.\n\nKey Highlights\n\nThe construction of the Delhi Metro, the heart of our national capital, started in 1998.\n\nOn December 25, 2002, PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee inaugurated the first elevated section.\n\nIn 2004, Delhi Metro became the second underground rapid transit system in India.\n\nNew Delhi: The Delhi Metro can be easily called one of the most important modes of communication in Delhi. A mass rapid transit (MRT) system its vast network is a blessing for the people of Delhi as it helps to avoid traffic and the extensive network of Delhi Metro also means that all the important places in the city are covered. It is the largest and busiest Metro rail system in our country and only the second oldest Metro rail after Kolkata Metro. Every day, thousands of commuters use the Delhi Metro as it presents a quick way to reach a destination. Much like the London Underground, the Delhi Metro is the heart and soul of the national capital and is operated by the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation Limited (DMRC).\n\nDelhi Metro: All you need to know\n\nA study on the traffic of Delhi was conducted in 1969, and from there the concept of a mass rapid transit emerged. In 1984, the Urban Arts Commission came up with a proposal for developing a multi-modal transport system, which would consist of constructing three underground mass rapid transit corridors as well augmenting the cityâ€™s existing suburban railway and road transport networks. The construction of the Delhi Metro started in 1998, and the first elevated section (Shahdara to Tis Hazari) on the Red Line opened on December 25, 2002. It was inaugurated by the then Prime Minister of India Atal Bihari Vajpayee.\n\nThe Delhi Metro became the second underground rapid transit system in India, after the Kolkata Metro, when the Vishwa Vidyalaya-Kashmere Gate section of the Yellow Line opened on December 20, 2004. It was inaugurated by then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. The first phase of the project was eventually completed in 2006, on budget and almost three years ahead of schedule. It has been built and operated by the DMRC, which has been certified by the United Nations as the first Metro rail and rail-based system in the world to get carbon Credits for reducing Green House gas emissions as it has helped to reduce pollution levels in the city by 6.3 lakh tons every year.\n\nDelhi Metro issues seven kinds of tokens: Single Journey Token, Smart Card, Tourist Card (1 day or 3 days), Single Journey Paper QR Ticket, Mobile App based QR Ticket, Trip Card (10, 30, 45 Trip), Mobile App based Trip Pass. The tokens are available across all ticketing windows and Ticket Vending Machines at stations. A token remains valid for the whole day from the station of purchase. An unused token is refundable at a full amount from the token purchased at a station only, within 60 minutes of the purchase. Partially used tokens can be refunded in exceptional cases, like disruption in service, unusual delay in train running due to an incident/accident. In Airport Express Line, the refund of a Single Journey Paper QR ticket is not permitted. A partially used Single Journey Paper QR ticket can be refunded in exceptional cases like disruption in services. Also, you can extend your journey beyond the original destination.\n\nIf you are a token holder, the additional fare for an extended journey has to be paid at the customer care centre of the destination station before making an exit from AFC gates. If you are a smart cardholder, the fare for the journey will be automatically deducted at the time of exit. The Metro services are generally available from 6.00 am to 11.00 pm. The interval between two consecutive trains varies from 2 minutes 30 seconds to 5 minutes on different lines while on the Airport line it is 10 minutes.\n\nDelhi Metro: Lines and stations\n\nThere are 11 operational lines in Delhi Metro.
