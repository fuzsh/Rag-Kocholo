        "text": "Green Line\n\nDelhi Metro rail network’s 5th line is the Green Line which is also known as Line 5. This is the first standard gauge line quite opposite to the earlier broad gauge tracks. It extends between Mundka and Inderlok (a Red Line station) together with a branch track linking Ashok Park Main Station to Kirti Nagar Station through blue line. This line is totally elevated that runs parallel to NH 10 road of West Delhi. This line covers 17 stations together with an interchange spot with a total distance of 18.46 km.\n\nThis Green line was inaugurated in 2 stages, the first phase of 15.1 km between Inderlok and Mundka was initiated on April 3, 2010 followed by 3.5 km stretch between Kirti Nagar and Ashok Park Main subsidiary route on August 27, 2011. With an aim to develop transport in the region of National Capital, Indian Union Government approved the extension of Metro Rail service between Mundka and Bahadurgarh in the state of Haryana on August 6, 2012. This 11.18 km route from Mundka to Bahadurgarh crosses 7 stations like City Park, Bahadurgarh Bus Stand, Modern Industrial Estate, Tikri Border, Tikri Kalan, Ghevra and Mundka Industrial Area.\n\nThe project was initiated during 2012 and is expected to be completed before March, 2016. After completion, this will deliver good transport service for people to travel between Bahadurgarh and Delhi. By 2016, approximately 96,000 people are expected to use Metro service, whereas by 2121-2122, the number may go upto 1, 48, 000. An order for supplementary rolling stock was placed by DMRC. By 2016, there will be 1,800 coaches in Phase III Metro Project. It is expected that there will be a necessity for 60 more coaches for Faridabad Line and additional 32 coaches for the extension of Green Line.\n\nStations\n\nStation Name\n\nLayout\n\n1\n\nInderlok\n\nRed Line\n\nElevated\n\n2\n\nAshok Park Main\n\nGreen Line branch\n\nElevated\n\n3\n\nPunjabi Bagh East\n\nNone\n\nElevated\n\n4\n\nShivaji Park\n\nNone\n\nElevated\n\n5\n\nMadipur\n\nNone\n\nElevated\n\n6\n\nPaschim Vihar East\n\nNone\n\nElevated\n\n7\n\nPaschim Vihar West\n\nNone\n\nElevated\n\n8\n\nPeera Garhi\n\nNone\n\nElevated\n\n9\n\nUdyog Nagar\n\nNone\n\nElevated\n\n10\n\nSurajmal Stadium\n\nNone\n\nElevated\n\n11\n\nNangloi\n\nNone\n\nElevated\n\n12\n\nNangloi Railway station\n\nNone\n\nElevated\n\n13\n\nRajdhani Park\n\nNone\n\nElevated\n\n14\n\nMundka\n\nNone\n\nElevated\n\nBranch Line\n\nThe branch lane of Kirti Nagar was intended to decrease the time and fare for people but because of the slow transport pace of standard gauge trains, commuters are forced to select the former longer distance through interchanging at Rajiv Chowk and Kashmere Gate. The percentage has been decreased with equal population at Kirti Nagar and Inderlok and majority of them get down at Nangloi, Peeragarhi and Ashok Park Main. By the year 2021, it is expected to complete and it will be extended between Dwarka Sector 28, Delhi Gate and Bahadurgarh to decrease the crowd in the present interchange stations.\n\nGreen Line branch\n\nSr.no\n\nStation Name\n\nOpening\n\nConnections\n\nLayout\n\n1\n\nAshok Park Main†\n\nApril 3, 2010\n\nGreen Line\n\nElevated\n\n2\n\nSatguru Ramsingh Marg\n\nAugust 27, 2011\n\nNone\n\nElevated\n\n3\n\nKirti Nagar\n\nAugust 27, 2011\n\nBlue Line\n\nAt Grade\n\nRolling Stock\n\nThe standard gauge trains used by Green Line were made by the group of Bharat Earth Movers (BEML), Hyundai Rotem and Mitsubishi. About 196 cars to run in 6-car configurations (two trains) and 4-car configurations (46 trains) of Violet and Green Line have been ordered. One of the trains was made in Changwon part of South Korea, whereas the remaining trains were made at BEML, Bangalore. The standard width of the trains is planned to be 2.9 m which is slightly less than the 3.2 m on broad gauge trains.\n\nBombardier Cityflo 350 signaling has been installed in Green Line.\n\nRoute Map"
