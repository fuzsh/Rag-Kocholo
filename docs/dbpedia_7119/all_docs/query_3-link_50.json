        "text": "it is very funny to see how uneven the crowd distribution in public transport like local trains and buses can be. An extreme example is the Kirti Nagar station in the Delhi Metro (station layout depicted in the adjoining figure). Here the first compartment is extremely crowded with barely enough space to stand while the crowd gradually thins until there are empty seats in the last compartment.\n\nIn this blog, I propose a model based on certain assumptions on the behavior of an individual. Following Feynmanâ€™s guidelines on what constitutes a good theory, first I made the assumptions based on observation of how people behave and then put it down to mathematics to show that such uneven crowd distributions can be stable. Hence, although this model is nothing more than a curiosity, I believe that upon further validation based on real data, we can use this as a model for crowds. We could thus possibly use this to design better layouts so that crowd distributions are more uniform.\n\nLet us denote the space available to an individual as the distance to the nearest neighbor, . Further, let us assume a dis-utility function (ie. a measure of the discomfort to the person) as:\n\n(note: it might be worthwhile modeling this in a more general sense with fewer assumptions on . For instance we could just say that it is infinite (or not defined?) till a and concave upward later on. This will give it a nice economics flavor (without any actual economics of course)).\n\nNow let us say that a person will move only if the rate of decrease in is greater than a certain threshold . That is, they move only if . The use of derivatives models the fact that people only search locally for good places to stand and most do not explore at all (chemists would say that no reaction with a positive activation energy occurs here). A distribution of people is said to be stable if no one moves and nobody is crushed (ie. ).\n\nThe objective is to find how distorted the distributions can be (in some sense, mow much discomfort people will tolerate). If we assume a room where people enter through an entrance and stop as soon as the distance is greater than , we can intuitively see that the distribution will be somewhat similar to the most uneven stable distribution (ie. one with minimum variance).\n\nHere, it is immediately apparent that the most distorted distribution will be a plateau-like distribution (ie. it will be uniform before tapering off to zero suddenly). This analysis is valid for any concave upward dis-utility function. But surprisingly, this model is not very stable to changes in assumptions. For instance, it instead of using , we use the population density as the indicator of dis-utility, we get very different results. Note: population density is a viable measure only when there are a sufficiently large number of people.\n\nLet the population density be where is a generic n-dimensional coordinate vector. Writing the dis-utility function in terms of the density, we get where is the dimensionality of and . We want that at all points, . Further, due to the restriction by , hence we have (although values for are known exactly for small , going into the packing problem is an unnecessary deviation from the main idea).\n\nIntuitively it is clear that the most uneven distribution will be one where the gradient is the maximum allowed (ie. in some sense the density density increases as fast as it can and then decreases as fast as it can). Simple calculations now give us:\n\nfor ,\n\nand for ,\n\nnote, for the 2D case, denotes . This gives us the densities as depicted in the graphs (for 2D, I was too lazy to make a density plot, so this is the plot of a cross section). Also, for 2D the curved parts are parts of parabolas. Interestingly, for a general , the curved parts are parts of functions of the form where and are constants."
