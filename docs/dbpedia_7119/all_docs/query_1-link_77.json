        "text": "Synopsis\n\nThe number of interchange stations will increase to 22 from the current nine, leading to a drastic reduction of travel time and saving of commuters' money.\n\nNEW DELHI: With the completion of third phase of Delhi Metro, the number of interchange stations will increase to 22 from the current nine, leading to a drastic reduction of travel time and saving of commuters' money.\n\nThe crisscrossing of lines in Phase III with the existing lines at many places will lead to emergence of several interchange stations, thus, shortening the distance between two different parts of the city by upto 15 kms at some locations.\n\nAt present, there are nine interchange stations-- Rajiv Chowk, Kashmere Gate, Central Secretariat, Inderlok, Ashok Park Main, Yamuna Bank, Dwarka Sec 21, New Delhi and Kirti Nagar.\n\nOnce phase III becomes fully operational by 2016, Delhi Metro network will have 13 more interchange hubs across the city, which includes Hauz Khas, INA, Rajouri Garden, Mayur Vihar phase-I, Azadpur, Netaji Subhash Place, Lajpat Nagar, Anand Vihar, Karkardooma, Welcome, Kalkaji Mandir, Botanical Garden and Mandi House.\n\nWith the coming up of interchange stations at Karkarduma and Anand Vihar in the third phase, the present day distance of these stations from nearest Metro station Welcome will come down drastically to 4.34 kms and 5.49 kms from the earlier 19.26 kms and 20.32 kms respectively if going by a train.\n\nThus, bringing them closer by almost 15 kms will not only save travel time but will also help in saving money for the passengers.\n\nSimilarly, with the coming up of other interchange stations in phase III, commuters in almost all parts of Delhi will be able to change trains without going to the present interchange stations like Rajiv Chowk and Central Secretariat.\n\nFor instance, Hauz Khas Metro station will come up as an interchange between Line 2 and the Janakpuri West-Botanical Garden corridor (Line 8) of Phase III.\n\nPassengers coming from Gurgaon on Line 2 will be able to get down at Hauz Khas and take a direct train to Kalkaji. And by doing so they would save traveling of about 13.14 kms.\n\nEarlier, for the same route the interchange facility was available only at Central Secretariat station and distance to be traveled was about 18.6 kms and with Line 8 connectivity in Phase-3 the distance between Hauz Khas and Kalkaji would be just 5.45 kms.\n\nThrough this connectivity, travelling time between Gurgaon and Noida will be brought down by at least 30 minutes.\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\nWhy India needs its biggest port Vadhavan, more now than ever\n\nFOMO overriding fundamentals?
