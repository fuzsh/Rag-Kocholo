        "text": "Delhi Metro project started in 1990s with an aim of creating a world class metro railway network in Delhi. At that time, I wondered if Delhi Metro will be made accessible for the persons with disabilities? Delhi’s public transport system was very unfriendly for the persons with disabilities. However, I have been pleasantly surprised to see that the Delhi Metro has always kept accessibility in mind. Metro stations and trains provide a number of facilities that make travel easier for persons with disabilities.\n\nIn this article, we will see what facilities Delhi Metro provides to make the whole network accessible for everyone.\n\nDelhi Metro Accessibility: Elevators are Available\n\nA number of Delhi Metro stations are equipped with elevators (lifts) which can be used by persons with disabilities to reach at the platforms. Even better thing is that mostly these elevators are found to be functional! So, you can easily get your wheelchair inside the lift and reach the desired level / platform.\n\nThese lifts are meant for the exclusive use by the persons with disabilities and elderly. However, you may find other people also using the elevators. Also, sometimes, insensitive vehicle users park their vehicles at the accessible entrance; thereby blocking the access. You should complain about such hurdles to the Metro staff.\n\nDelhi Metro Accessibility: Facilities Inside Elevators\n\nWay to elevators are properly marked. See the list given at the end of this article to find out station gates with elevators. Elevators have rails inside to help wheelchair users. Elevator buttons are marked with embossed signs as well as Braille. Audio notifications are also played.\n\nDelhi Metro Accessibility: Extra-Wide Flap Gates for Entry\n\nFlap gates have been installed to regulate the entry of passengers on to the platform. These gates can be opened extra-wide to allow wheelchairs through.\n\nDelhi Metro Accessibility: Wheelchairs are Available\n\nWheelchairs are available at every station for those who need one. You can contact the Customer Care Counter to get assistance. These counters are located near the entrance of the station.\n\nTactile Pathways for Persons with Visual Impairment\n\nOn station floors tactile pathways have been made to help guide the persons with visual impairment. These paths are made of bright yellow tiles with tiny bumps and ridges on it. Visually impaired people can feel the path by touching cane on these projections. Bright color of the path helps people with low vision to better see the paths. These paths do lead people right to the places like ticket counters, toilets, platforms etc.\n\nLevel Platforms with Train Floor\n\nThe train floor and the platform are in level. Thus a wheelchair can be easily rolled into the coaches. There is a gap of few inches between train and platform. The passengers should mind this gap as small front wheels of a wheelchair may get stuck in this gap.\n\nAccessible Toilets at Metro Stations\n\nAll metro stations are equipped with accessible toilets. These toilets are well maintained. Frequent cleaning is carried out. these toilets have wide doors, low height commodes and handrails etc.\n\nHand Rails Along the Stairs\n\nAll the stair cases inside metro stations are lined with hand rails. These railings are very helpful for elderly and persons with visual impairment who would want to use stairs instead of an elevator.\n\nProper Signage for All the Facilities for Persons with Disabilities\n\nYou will find well lit signage at appropriate places to inform you about various facilities like elevator, entry, exit and accessible toilets etc.\n\nReserved Seating\n\nSeating space has been reserved for persons with disabilities and elderly people. There are wheelchair parking spaces inside every coach. You can safely park your wheelchair in these spaces.\n\nRamps\n\nRamps have been installed in metro stations wherever surface level changes. Ramps have been made according to standards.\n\nGeneral Tips Regarding Delhi Metro Accessibility\n\nIt should be noted that in peak hours metro stations (especially at the interchanges) could be very crowded. Peak hours in Delhi Metro run from 8:00am to 12:00pm and 5:00pm to 9:00pm.\n\nFollowing table informs you about the availability of elevator at each Delhi metro station. You should reference it before planning your journey on Delhi Metro.\n\nENTRY / EXIT POINTS AT THE METRO STATIONS FOR HASSLE FREE ACCESS TO PERSONS WITH DISABILITIESS/NSTATIONSTATION TYPESTATION GATE / LIFT No.LOCATIONLINE-1 (RED LINE) DILSHAD GARDEN TO RITHALA1Dilshad GardenElevatedLift No.3Near Gate No.1; Near 2-Wheeler Parking Lot / Bajaj Showroom2JhilmilElevatedGate No.2Ramp connecting to GT RoadLift No.3Near Gate No.1 of the Station3Mansarovar ParkElevatedLift No.3Near Gate No.2 of the Station; towards Industrial Area4ShahdaraElevatedGate No.1Towards GT Road Side5WelcomeElevatedGate No.1Towards GT Road Side6SeelampurElevatedGate No.1Towards GT Road Side7Shastri ParkAt GradeGate No.1On the Approach road to the Station from Gandhi Nagar Side8Kashmere GateElevatedGate No.7Adjacent to Kashmere Gate ISBT9Tis HazariElevatedGate No.1Ramp connecting St. Stephen’s Hospital and Tis Hazari CourtsGate No.2On GT road coming from Azad Market to Kashmere GateGate No.3Entry from Station’s Parking lot10Pul BangashElevatedLift No.3Near Gate No.1 of the Station; towards Rohsnara Road11Pratap NagarElevatedLift No.3Near Gate No.2 of the Station; towards Sabzi Mandi side12Shastri NagarElevatedLift No.3Near Gate No.2 of the Station; near 2-Wheeler Parking Lot13Inderlok (L-1)ElevatedLift No.3Near Gate No.1 of the Station; towards Big Bazar side14Kanhaiya NagarElevatedLift No.3Near Gate No.3 of the Station15Keshav PuramElevatedLift No.3Near Gate No.3 of the Station; near Parking Lot16Netaji Subhas PlaceElevatedLift No.3Near Gate No.2 of the Station17Kohat EnclaveElevatedLift No.3Near Gate No.1 of the Station; near Big Parking Lot18PitampuraElevatedLift No.3Near Gate No.2 of the Station; near Parking Lot19Rohini EastElevatedLift No.3Near Gate No.3 of the Station; near Parking Lot20Rohini WestElevatedLift No.3Near Gate No.3 of the Station; near Unity Mall21RithalaElevatedLift No.3Near Gate No.3 of the StationLINE-2 (YELLOW LINE) SAMAYPUR BADLI TO HUDA CITY CENTRE22Samaypur BadliElevatedLift No.3Near Gate No.1 of the Station23Rohini Sector-18,19ElevatedLift No.3Near Gate No.1 of the StationLift No.4–24Haiderpur Badli MorElevatedLift No.3Near Gate No.1 of the Station25JahangirpuriElevatedLift No.3Near Gate No.4 of the StationLift No.4Near Gate No.2 of the Station26Adarsh NagarElevatedLift No.3Near Gate No.4 of the StationLift No.4Near Gate No.2 of the Station27AzadpurElevatedLift No.3Near Gate No.1 of the Station28Model TownElevatedLift No.3Near Gate No.4 of the Station; Near Police Chowki29GTB NagarUndergroundLift No.3Near Gate No.5 of the Station; in front of Samrat Hotel30VishwavidyalayaUndergroundGate No.1Near Station’s Parking Lot (Exit Only)Gate No.2Near Station’s Parking LotGate No.3Near Delhi University StadiumGate No.4Near Khalsa College of Delhi University (Exit Only)31Vidhan SabhaUndergroundLift No.3Near Gate No.1 of the Station32Civil LinesUndergroundLift No.3Near Gate No.1 of the Station33Kashmere GateUndergroundLift No.2On Lala Hardev Sahai Road, near Gate No.6 of the Station34Chandni ChowkUndergroundLift No.2Near Gate No.2 of the Station; near Delhi Public Library35Chawri BazarUndergroundLift No.1Towards Ajmeri Gate SideLift No.2Towards Ajmeri Gate Side36New DelhiUndergroundLift No.2Paharganj Side37Rajiv ChowkUndergroundLift No.4Near ICICI Bank in A-Block Connaught PlaceLift No.5Near Gate No.1&2 of the Station; Near B-Block38Patel ChowkUndergroundLift No.2Between Gate No.1&2 of the Station; near Parking Lot39Central Secretariat-2UndergroundLift No.3Near Railway Board Building40Central Secretariat-6UndergroundLift No.3ATowards India Gate41Udyog BhawanUndergroundLift No.2Between Gate No.1 & 2 of the StationLift No.3Near Gate No.4 of the Station; on K Kamraj Marg42Lok Kalyan MargUndergroundLift No.2Near Gate No.2 of the Station; on Abdul Kalam Road43Jor BaghUndergroundLift No.2Near Gate No.2 of the Station; on Aurbindo MargLift No.3Near Gate No.1 of the Station44INAUndergroundLift No.2Near Gate No.1 of the Station; Adjacent to HP Petrol Pump near Delhi HaatLift No.3Near Gate No.2 of the Station; Near INA Market AIIMS end45AIIMSUndergroundLift No.2Near Gate No.3 of the Station; Near Sardarjung HospitalLift No.3Near Gate No.2 of the Station; Near AIIMS HospitalLift No.4Near Gate No.1 of the Station; Near AIIMS Hospital46Green ParkUndergroundLift No.2Near Gate No.3 of the Station; Near Avida HospitalLift No.3Near Gate No.2 of the Station; Near Parking Lot47Hauz KhasUndergroundLift No.2Near Gate No.3 of the Station; Near Parking Lot48Malviya NagarUndergroundLift No.2Near Gate No.1 of the Station; Near Police Station/Malviya NagarLift No.3Near Gate No.3 of the Station; Near Parking Lot49SaketUndergroundLift No.2Near Gate No.1 of the Station; On MB Road near Vidya Niketan SchoolLift No.3Near Gate No.2 of the Station; On MB Road near Said-ul-Ajab50Qutab MinarAt GradeGate No.1Near Parking Lot.
