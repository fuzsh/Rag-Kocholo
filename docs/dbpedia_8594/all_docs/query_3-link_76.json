        "text": "Pep Guardiola became the first manager in Europe to win two trebles as Manchester City completed a dream season by beating Inter Milan 1-0 to secure their first Champions League title on Saturday.\n\nCity completed the treble of Champions League, Premier League and FA Cup titles, matching Manchester United's feat in 1999 and drawing comparisons with Guardiola's 2008-09 Barcelona team.\n\nHere is how the 2022-23 City side stack up against that Barca team.\n\nTEAM STRENGTHS\n\nGuardiola's 2008-09 Barca had a squad including some of the best Spanish players of their generation, defenders Carles Puyol and Gerard Pique, and midfielders Sergio Busquets, Xavi Hernandez and Andres Iniesta who were the core of the national team who won the 2010 World Cup in South Africa.\n\nBrazilian full back Dani Alves was a menace down the right channel, supplying one of the best strike forces in the history of club football -- Lionel Messi, Samuel Eto'o and Thierry Henry.\n\nManchester City have one of the greatest club squads ever assembled.\n\nThe likes of forward Julian Alvares, a starter for Argentina in last year's World Cup triumph, England midfielder Phil Foden and Riyad Mahrez all struggle to nail down a first-team spot.\n\nThe addition of Erling Haaland turned Guardiola's City into a juggernaut, with the 22-year-old Norwegian striker surpassing Mohamed Salah's record of 32 goals in a 38-game Premier League season and beating Alan Shearer and Andy Cole, who managed 34 each when it was a 42-match competition.\n\nGAME STYLE\n\nGuardiola's Barca were well known for their unique possession game which dazzled opponents with quick short passes, intelligent movement and positional interchange in a style called \"Tiki-Taka\".\n\nOne of the great tactical revolutions also helped Spain to dominate world football, winning won two European championships and a World Cup.\n\nAt City, Guardiola presented an evolution of \"total football\", creating a near perfect fluid system in which almost no player remained in a fixed role, complemented by a relentless high press.\n\nCity are flexible and can change systems when required. Last year, they won the Premier League without a centre forward and with Haaland they have a battering ram up-front which allows them to adopt a more direct style.\n\nCAMPAIGNS\n\nBarca won the 2008-09 LaLiga title with 87 points, nine more than Real Madrid, scored 105 goals and finished the season with an unbeaten run of 22 matches.\n\nMessi, Eto'o and Henry scored a 100 goals in all competitions with the Argentine netting 38 and Eto'o finishing as LaLiga's top scorer with 30 strikes.\n\nThey beat Manchester United in the Champions League final 2-0 thanks to goals by Eto'o and Messi.\n\nThis year's Premier League title was Guardiola’s fifth with City as they became only the second club to win it three years in a row and the fifth in the history of league football in England.\n\nThey will bid next year to become the first club to win the Premier League four times in a row.\n\nCity beat Manchester United 2-1 in the FA Cup final and became only the second English team to win the treble.\n\nTrophies won by Pep Guardiola\n\nPep Guardiola won his 35th trophy as a manager after Manchester City beat Inter Milan 1-0 in the Champions League final on Saturday.\n\nThe following are the trophies the 52-year-old Spaniard won with Barcelona, Bayern Munich and City.\n\nBarcelona (14 trophies between 2008 and 2012)\n\n* LaLiga: 2008–09, 2009–10, 2010–11\n\n* Champions League: 2008–09, 2010–11\n\n* Copa del Rey: 2008–09, 2011–12\n\n* Spanish Supercup: 2009, 2010, 2011\n\n* UEFA Super Cup: 2009, 2011\n\n* FIFA Club World Cup: 2009, 2011\n\nBayern Munich (7 trophies from 2013 to 2016)\n\n* Bundesliga: 2013–14, 2014–15, 2015–16\n\n* DFB Pokal: 2013–14, 2015–16\n\n* UEFA Super Cup: 2013\n\n* FIFA Club World Cup: 2013\n\nManchester City (14 trophies since 2016)\n\n* Premier League: 2017–18, 2018–19, 2020–21, 2021–22, 2022–23\n\n* FA Cup: 2018–19, 2022–23\n\n* Champions League: 2022-23\n\n* League Cup: 2017–18, 2018–19, 2019–20, 2020–21\n\n* Community Shield: 2018, 2019\n\n* Guardiola became only the second manager to win the treble of Premier League, FA Cup and Champions League trophies after Alex Ferguson with Manchester United (1998-99).\n\n* The treble with City is the second of Guardiola's career after his Barcelona side won LaLiga, the Copa del Rey and the Champions League in his debut season (2008-09).\n\n* Guardiola became only the fourth manager to win the European Cup at least three times after Carlo Ancelotti (four titles - two each with AC Milan and Real Madrid), Bob Paisley (Liverpool) and Zinedine Zidane (Real Madrid).\n\nMANAGER WINS YEARS WON\n\nCarlo Ancelotti 4 2003, 2007, 2014, 2022\n\nBob Paisley 3 1977, 1978, 1981\n\nZinedine Zidane 3 2016, 2017, 2018\n\nPep Guardiola 3 2009, 2011, 2023"
