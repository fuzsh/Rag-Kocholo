        "text": "Arsenal will take on Porto for a place in the Champions League quarter-finals, with holders Manchester City drawn against FC Copenhagen in the round of 16.\n\nArsenal and City topped their respective groups, and both sides will arguably be pleased with their draws given Paris Saint-Germain were among the potential opponents, likewise Serie A champions Napoli.\n\nAnd it is Napoli who arguably have the standout tie of the round against Barcelona, who are currently off the pace in La Liga.\n\nPSG, meanwhile, face Spanish side Real Sociedad, who topped their group ahead of Inter Milan.\n\nChampions League last-16 fixtures\n\nFC Porto vs Arsenal\n\nNapoli vs Barcelona\n\nParis Saint-Germain vs Real Sociedad\n\nInter Milan vs Atletico Madrid\n\nPSV Eindhoven vs Borussia Dortmund\n\nLazio vs Bayern Munich\n\nFC Copenhagen vs Manchester City\n\nRB Leipzig vs Real Madrid\n\nChampions League last-16 dates\n\nThe first legs will be played across 13-14 and 20-21 February, with the return legs then on 5-6 and 12-13 March.\n\nHolders City get easiest tie – on paper\n\nAmong the group runners-up were the fourth, sixth and seventh best teams in Europe – PSG, Inter and Leipzig based on Uefa’s club coefficients – and so naturally City landed on the team ranked 37th, the lowest of the eight.\n\nThose who feel City have the luck of the draw will have certainly scoffed, but Pep Guardiola would be wise not to overly underestimate Copenhagen, the side that beat Manchester United 4-3 at home in November.\n\nThe Danish side were also unlucky to leave Old Trafford without a point in October, and while City are a different beast to their city rivals, their current form could offer Copenhagen some hope.\n\nCopenhagen managed to hold City to a 0-0 draw at home in the group stages last season.\n\nThat’s the positive. The mighty negative was the 5-0 defeat in the reverse fixture, when Erling Haaland score twice in the first half to get the City machine rolling.\n\nArsenal and their fans expect\n\nPremier League leaders Arsenal are fourth favourites to win the Champions League this season – behind City, Bayern and Real Madrid – a sign of the times despite having not played in the competition since 2016-17.\n\nIn Mikel Arteta they very much trust, and in Porto they face a side currently in a three-way title race with Benfica and Sporting in the Primeira Liga.\n\nPorto in fact head to Sporting on Monday night, and in their Champions League group, the 2004 winners overcame both Antwerp and Shakhtar Donetsk twice, but lost both of their matches to Barcelona.\n\nArsenal will be expected to reach the last eight, therefore, and it will be the first time for 14 years they have faced Porto in the Champions League.\n\nOn that occasion, in the 2009-10 round of 16, Arsenal lost the first leg 2-1 away, but made amends with a 5-0 demolition at home – thanks, of course, to a Nicklas Bendtner hat-trick."
