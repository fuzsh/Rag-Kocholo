        "text": "Ever wondered which Premier League side have been the most entertaining to watch, which title winners have not only clinched the top prize but done so in breathtaking fashion?\n\nWell, now your prayers have been answered. Thanks to betting firm Spreadex , a points-based system has been devised to decide which Premier League side can claim to be the most entertaining top-flight team ever.\n\nThe process awards points for each match over the course of a season, with points awarded for wins, clean sheets and goals but taken away for cards while none are received for a loss.\n\nMany fans will no doubt point to Arsenal's Invincibles team that survived an entire season unbeaten as the best-ever but incredibly the 2003/04 side does not even make it inside the top 10.\n\nNeither does Manchester United's treble-winning side of 1999 nor do Leicester's heroic underdogs who achieved the unthinkable in 2016.\n\nFor such teams to miss out, there must be some serious Premier League heavyweights that make up the list, time to find out who is number one.\n\n10. Liverpool 2013/14 – 71.37\n\nA season that will forever be remembered for Steven Gerrard's costly slip in a 2-0 home defeat to Chelsea which meant Man City pipped the Reds to the title.\n\nBut it was also a campaign where Liverpool played some enthralling football, spearheaded by Luis Suarez who raced to the Golden Boot with his tally of 31 goals in 33 top-flight games.\n\nSuarez and Daniel Sturridge were lethal upfront for Brendan Rodgers' side who notched 101 times in the league, their best-ever total in the Premier League era.\n\n9. Man United 2009/10 – 73.18\n\nAiming for their fourth consecutive Premier League crown, the Red Devils were agonisingly beaten to top honours by Chelsea with just a point separating the two sides.\n\nFollowing Cristiano Ronaldo's £80m departure to Real Madrid, United were tipped to struggle, but Wayne Rooney rose to the challenge and the PL Player of the Season so nearly fired his side to glory.\n\n8. Man City 2011/12 – 73.47\n\nAguerooooo!! Undoubtedly the most exciting climax to a season in Premier League history, the last day drama that saw City snatch the title away from bitter rivals Man Utd was breathtaking.\n\nBut aside from that incredible last-gasp 3-2 win over QPR, which saw City score twice in stoppage time, Roberto Mancini's team were scintillating throughout the campaign.\n\nAt both ends of the pitch, they were simply outstanding. Keeper Joe Hart claimed a league-high 17 clean sheets whilst Sergio Aguero bagged 23 league goals as City scored 93 in total.\n\n7. Man United 2011/12 – 75.05\n\nUnited may have come second on goal difference in an epic title race but they can claim bragging rights here, as they rank above their noisy neighbours in terms of excitement.\n\nOne match at Old Trafford shows just how ruthless United were, an 8-2 drubbing of Arsenal. It included a Rooney hat-trick and left Gunners boss Arsene Wenger with his tail firmly between his legs.\n\n6. Man City 2013/14 – 76.03\n\nManuel Pellegrini steered the City machine and oversaw a team which ran riot. They became the fastest Premier League team ever to reach 100 goals in all competitions in a season.\n\nThat feat was achieved before the end of January and had included a 4-1 hiding of neighbours United, a 6-0 thumping of Spurs and a 6-3 win over Arsenal - all at the Etihad.\n\nBeneficiaries of Gerrard's Anfield mishap, Pellegrini's free-scoring side went on to win the title with Aguero, Yaya Touré and Edin Džeko all registering over 15 league goals each.\n\n5. Liverpool 2018/19 – 76.11\n\nIt was another campaign which ultimately ended in heartache for Liverpool. A tough one to take, considering the Reds only tasted defeat once in the league.\n\nThat solitary loss came courtesy of eventual champions Man City whose 1-0 triumph over Jurgen Klopp's side proved pivotal in deciding the course of the title.\n\nOnly one point split the two teams, and Liverpool's points tally of 97 was not only their best-ever but would have clinched them the top gong in 25 of the 26 PL seasons that had preceded it.\n\n4. Liverpool 2019/20 – 76.66\n\nIt's a recurring theme, oh so near yet so far for the Merseysiders. But this time it had nothing to do with football, this time Liverpool's 30-year wait for a title was halted by a global pandemic.\n\nJust when it looked as if Klopp's men would canter to the title, 25 points ahead of nearest rivals Man City, with only nine games left to play, coronavirus stopped them in their tracks.\n\nUp until then, Liverpool had been near flawless. They dropped two points in their first 28 league games before losing to Watford in their only defeat of the season.\n\n3. Chelsea 2009/10 – 77.97\n\nCarlo Ancelotti's side were a joy to watch as they beat Man United to the title, clinched a league and FA Cup double and scored a record-breaking 103 league goals along the way.\n\nChelsea were irresistible from start to finish and registered 17 times in their last three league games including a final day 8-0 home demolition of Wigan.\n\nDidier Drogba was the driving force in a campaign which saw Chelsea register a then-record +71 goal difference and score a league best-ever tally of 68 goals at home.\n\n2. Man City 2018/19 – 81.68\n\nPep Guardiola's name has always been synonymous with beautiful football and it has been no different since his arrival at the Eithad in 2016.\n\nDuring this particular season, Pep's men swept all comers aside to claim an unprecedented domestic treble - their Premier League crown was accompanied by both the League and FA Cup.\n\nCity contributed no less than six players to the PL PFA Team of the Year, with Player of the Season Raheem Sterling among the Sky Blues' contingent.\n\nThey also secured a double over city rivals United and eclipsed their own record of goals in a season, notching 169 times in all competitions.\n\n1. Man City 2017/18 – 82.55\n\nIt comes as no surprise that Guardiola's City top the list. This astonishing season broke all manner of top-flight records as City romped to the title, winning 32 of their 38 league games.\n\nCity finished a record-breaking 19 points ahead of second-placed Man United having wracked up an incredible 100 points during the season, the greatest ever Premier League tally.\n\nBut it doesn't stop there. Pep's side also bagged a best ever 106 goals during their league campaign, boasted a +79 goal difference and recorded 18 consecutive top-flight victories. Quite simply a cut above the rest."
