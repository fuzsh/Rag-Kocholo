        "text": "Research has revealed that more Champions League winners have come from Group F than any others as Arsenal look to win their first major European honour. Their quarter-final against Bayern Munich is on a knife edge after they played out a 2-2 draw with the German giants last week.\n\nThe Gunners last picked up silverware outside of England in 1994 when they scooped the Cup Winners Cup but suffered heartache against Barcelona in 2006. With a possible all-English semi-final against Manchester City on the cards, Mikel Arteta's side are looking to cement themselves in history while chasing the Premier League title.\n\nAlthough, the Genting Casinos research shows they face the possibility of further disappointment after qualifying out of Group B. Arsenal earned 13 points in their six group-stage matches, ahead of PSV Eindhoven and RC Lens. The statistics also paint a bleak picture for Manchester City's hopes of retaining the Champions League after they breezed through out of Group G.\n\nIt was found that 23 percent of all winners since the tournament re-brand in 1992 has had more winners from Group F than any other with Group D falling marginally short. Inter Milan, Bayern Munich, Barcelona and Real Madrid are the winners to progress from Group F to lift the famous trophy since 2009/10.\n\nManchester United were the last English club to win the competition from Group F, while Liverpool progressed beyond Group A and C in their respective successes. While Chelsea won the tournament after qualifying from Group E in their 2011/12 and 2020/21 triumphs.\n\nCity's Champions League future is also on a knife-edge after their draw with Real Madrid. Atletico Madrid, Borussia Dortmund, Paris Saint-Germain and Barcelona are among those remaining in the competition. Dortmund and the Ligue 1 giants both qualified from Group F and are the only group to feature multiple clubs in the last eight.\n\nREAD MORE: Mikel Arteta sends brutal title race message to Arsenal squad as Gunners run out of excuses\n\nREAD MORE: Arsenal still have unexpected Premier League title advantage over Man City with clear final chance\n\n\"In Champions League history, Group F has emerged as the most prolific source of winners, boasting 23% of all champions since the tournament's rebranding in 1992,\" a spokesperson for Genting Casinos said.\n\n\"While Group G and Group H have produced fewer winners, it's important to note that this can be attributed to the tournament's expansion in recent years. The latest quarter-finalists, including Borussia Dortmund and PSG from Group F, underscore the competitive strength of this group.\""
