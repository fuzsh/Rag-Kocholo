        "text": "Liverpool’s ability to challenge for the Premier League title is not being taken as seriously as it should be in some quarters considering they are top after 30 games. To listen to some people, you would think its hopes are built on sand, not the sturdy foundation of 2.33 points per game.\n\n“Liverpool (36 per cent) have spent a lower proportion of game time in a winning position than Man City (45 per cent), Arsenal (42 per cent), Aston Villa (38 per cent) and Spurs (37 per cent) in the Premier League this season,” read a post on X (formerly Twitter) from Opta Analyst on Friday. As this figure stood between 49 and 50 per cent for Jürgen Klopp’s Reds in each of the three campaigns in which they got at least 92 points, perhaps this simple statistic highlights a problematic weakness.\n\nBut then it doesn’t matter for how long a team is leading in a match, just that they are when the referee blows the full-time whistle. Ask any Liverpool player or fan if they mind that the Reds didn’t lead at Newcastle and Nottingham Forest until stoppage time and see what response you get. When it comes to finishing games well in 2023/24, no team can match up to the Reds.\n\nREAD MORE: Karim Benzema has just said exactly what Liverpool should want to hear amid Mohamed Salah call\n\nREAD MORE: Liverpool injury latest and return dates pre-Man Utd as Diogo Jota and Wataru Endō boosts near\n\nAgainst Sheffield United on Thursday, Liverpool scored twice in the final 13 minutes of normal time to turn the potential dropping of two points into its 21st Premier League victory of the campaign. The goals by Alexis Mac Allister and Cody Gakpo against the Blades were the Reds’ 25th and 26th after the 75th minute of league matches this season. In the last 15 years, only the title-winning Chelsea side of 2009/10 scored as many, and the Liverpool class of 2023/24 has eight games remaining.\n\nTransfermarkt recently shared further data which emphasizes how well the Reds have been finishing matches this term. It revealed that if Premier League matches started at half-time, Liverpool would be top of the league with 73 points, 10 clear of Arsenal, with Tottenham four points further back and City one behind Spurs.\n\nThis is a serious total from the Reds. Pep Guardiola’s side topped these standings with 70 points in 2022/23, while Manchester United led the second-half table with 67 two years earlier. Liverpool theoretically amassed 85 points in this sense in 2021/22, but for the current crop to have 73 from 30 games illustrates that their determination, fitness and will to win is incredibly strong this season.\n\nOf course, there is an element of “if my grandmother had wheels, she'd be a bike,” to this type of analysis. A team could win every second half 1-0 but if it were 2-0 down at the break each week then it would still finish with no points. Liverpool has had to be so good in the final 45 minutes of league matches this term because it has only led 10 of its first 30 games at half-time. That’s fewer than Villa (14), Brighton and West Ham (both 12), never mind the teams with which it is competing for the title.\n\nAnd no side is flawless at protecting leads late in the day either. The Reds’ three second-half ‘losses’ this season occurred at Tottenham (in hugely controversial circumstances), Brighton and Arsenal. The four goals conceded after the interval in those matches cost Liverpool four points, which could be huge at the end of the season, particularly if the Gunners win the league.\n\nBut you cannot ask for much more than a team outscoring its opponents in 23 of 30 second halves as the Reds have done in 2023/24. If they are not leading at half-time at Old Trafford on Sunday, all is far from lost."
