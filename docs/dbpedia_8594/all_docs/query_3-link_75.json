        "text": "TOTAL NETWORK SOLUTIONS FC\n\nIn the 47-year history of European club football there has never been a match like this. The 600-fold difference in size between Manchester and Llansantffraid-ym-Mechain is the largest yet between any pairing in Europe. It will be the first time that both clubs contesting a European match have not played a competitive game previously at both of the grounds being used. And, as TNS will field at least 8 Englishmen and City maybe 5, this will be the first European tie where the nation represented by one side has more individuals playing for the oppsition!\n\nAlso, this is the first time since Wales created a national league and football pyramid in 1992 that an English Premier club has met a Welsh Premier club in Europe, and only the second meeting ever between England and Wales (Manchester United beat Wrexham 5-0 on aggregate in the old Cup Winners’ Cup – then the only Welsh access to Europe – in 1990). All this leads to another notable landmark: a member of the oldest and richest national league versus a club from the youngest and poorest one – a penury graphically displayed recently when 7-times champions Barry Town had trouble scraping together a mere £1300 so that their Champions League qualifier could go ahead.\n\nSo, the usual soccer-speak of giants and minnows just doesn’t come close to doing justice to this UEFA Cup tie: Manchester City and TNS inhabit different universes. How did this club from a rural hamlet get invited to feast at football’s top table?\n\nLlansantffraid FC paddled in the quiet backwaters of amateur football for over 30 years until, as the FAW began to form a pyramid system, the Saints began their climb. With an ambitious and innovative committee, and galvanised by the new possibilities opening up for Welsh clubs, Llansantffraid won 3 promotions in 4 seasons to reach the Welsh Premier (WP) in 1993. Observers of the Welsh scene predicted instant relegation. But Llansantffraid defied the odds to survive in the WP. Every step of the way the club grew in stature, and the Treflan trophy cupboard began to fill. The League Cup was won in 1995, and then at the old National Stadium a year later Llansantffraid triumphed in the Welsh Cup, leading to a first European experience in Poland.\n\nIn 1997 computer company Total Network Solutions, from their base on the border in Oswestry, made Llansantffraid an offer no WP club could refuse. In the absence of sponsorship, TV revenues or public assistance, WP clubs cannot afford to reject a helping hand. In a shoestring league you don’t need a fortune to get ahead – any investment will lift you above the pack. The price of the deal was a change of name to TNS. In most countries businesses support clubs, in many countries clubs are businesses, but only in Wales could it happen that a business IS the club.\n\nWhen TNS wrestled the championship title from Barry Town’s grip in 2000, their astonishingly rapid rise to the top was complete. But Managing Director Mike Harris never rests on his laurels. A new stand, fully-pro status, a youth structure and a twinning deal with Chelsea have followed, and TNS are now established as regular title contenders and European qualifiers. None of this would have been possible without the financial clout of the parent company.\n\nManager Ken McKenna will need his players to perform at their absolute peak if TNS are even to keep the score respectable against Manchester City. He will not want a repeat of the alarming frailty shown in the club-record 2-12 aggregate defeat of last year’s UEFA Cup. Nor will he want to see more of the raw nerves exposed in last season’s WP, when a big points lead was overhauled by Barry and the Saints were pipped at the post for the title. Mike Harris’s typically audacious booking of the Millennium Stadium for the ‘home’ leg puts more pressure on – the gamble could backfire if City kill the tie in Manchester and as a result gate revenues suffer in Cardiff.\n\nWhatever happens, after the dust has settled on two historic matches, TNS will return to the domestic scene wealthier and stronger. They are the shot in the arm the Welsh game desperately needed. Not for them the narrow horizons of Old Wales; TNS prove things can be other than they’ve always been before. The final twist is this: it has taken an English company, an English manager, a largely English group of players and English enterprise to show Wales how to do it. And, if Mike Harris’s latest plan, a merger with Oswestry Town, gets the thumbs-up, TNS’s exciting future will take place on English soil.\n\nCITY/TNS CONNECTIONS\n\nManchester City and TNS have never met before, but these two very different clubs have more in common than you might think…\n\nBilly Meredith – The first football folk-hero, vital to the transformation of Manchester City from Lancashire also-rans Ardwick into one of England’s great clubs, and still the prototype of the dribbling winger. The Welsh Wizard was born a few miles from Llansantffraid and played his early football for Chirk, the village sensations of their day, 100 years before TNS filled that role.\n\nTony Henry – A City apprentice who went on to make 79 league appearances for the club and play in the 1981 Cup Final, effective utility man Henry arrived at Llansantffraid in 1994 after making over 400 English league appearances. He made 46 WP appearances for TNS and won a League Cup winner’s medal before being appointed manager in October 1997. It didn’t work out – only 2 wins in 16 games got Henry the sack 4 months later. He bitterly denounced the TNS board, but time has vindicated their decision. His departure paved the way for the title-winning reign of Dr Andy Cale.\n\nDarren Beckford – Mancunian Beckford was another City apprentice who found his way to Treflan. He never really made it at Maine Road, making only 11 league appearances, before a wandering career took him via Bury, Port Vale, Norwich, Oldham, Hearts, Walsall and Southport to TNS. His old City pal Tony Henry persuaded him to join in season 1997/98, but his stay was short and unfruitful – a mere 4 WP games and 1 goal.\n\nCliff Sear – After 248 league appearances for City between 1957 and 1968, Sear moved to Chester City where he discovered and developed goal-machine Ian Rush, who is now a non-executive director of TNS."
