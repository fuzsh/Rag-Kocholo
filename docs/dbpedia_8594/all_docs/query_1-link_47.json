        "text": "Just one point separates the top three teams in the Premier League, and perhaps more crucially it is Arsenal and Liverpool with the slenderest of advantages over Manchester City.\n\nFor now, Arsenal are top of the table on goal difference – which could yet prove a decisive factor – ahead of Liverpool. Both have 64 points to City’s 63, Pep Guardiola’s side the hunters once more.\n\nAt this stage, it is the tightest three-team title race ever in the Premier League era. It is the first time three clubs have 63 or more points after 28 matches, and just the third occasion where three teams have 60 or more points with 10 games to go.\n\n“I don’t think I have ever been involved in a title race with three teams,” said Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp, after his side’s 1-1 draw with City on Sunday.\n\n“I literally don’t know if it changes something. We have 10 games to play, so obviously nothing is decided. There are plenty of games… I would prefer to have 30 points between us, but the realistic thing is are we really in that race from a performance point of view? I saw a team that is in the right position, so now let’s see what we can do.”\n\nLiverpool are the only side to break City’s stranglehold in the Premier League in recent years, winning the 2019-20 title. Otherwise, City have won five of the past six, and are looking to become the first-ever side to win four straight titles in the top tier of English football.\n\n“There are still 10 games to play, 30 points to play for, one point difference. Still we are there. That is the important thing,” Guardiola said.\n\nFor Arsenal, meanwhile, top is a familiar sight after occupying that position for so long last season. They would relinquish the title to City in the final straight, but have shown mettle of late – including a late winner against Brentford on Saturday.\n\n“If you want to be up there, you have to win these types of games and the team showed that it has the tools and especially the determination, and the belief to do so,” Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta said.\n\n“There’s a lot of qualities that you need to win that many games in this league and manner in which we have done it, but it is about consistency… and not being satisfied and willing to do more, and as well having the qualities to gain in different context because every game is going to require different process, different story and the team showed a different one today.”\n\nPremier League table\n\nYour browser does not support iframes\n\nKey dates in Premier League title race\n\n31 March – The first weekend back after the international break is a doozy. Liverpool welcome Brighton to Anfield, before City host Arsenal at the Etihad. A must-win for the Gunners?\n\n6-7 April – An away hat-trick for the title contenders. After City travel to Crystal Palace at Saturday lunchtime, Arsenal go to Brighton in the evening. And the Sunday? The small matter of Liverpool heading to Manchester United.\n\n20-21 April – City ended their winless and goalless run at Tottenham’s new ground in the FA Cup in January. They head there again on a weekend – fixture times TBC – where Liverpool go to Fulham and Arsenal face Wolves away.\n\n11-12 May – The penultimate weekend, exact times TBC, sees Liverpool travel to Aston Villa, while City face Fulham away and Arsenal go to Manchester United.\n\n19 May – The final day. Arsenal host Everton, Liverpool host Wolves, City host West Ham. All at home, all easy? Maybe not. Add the tension of a potential deciding afternoon and it could get nervy.\n\nWho will win the Premier League?\n\ni’s correspondents and reporters predict which way they have the title race going…\n\nKevin Garside: With fixtures at City, Spurs and Manchester United, Arsenal have the heavier load. City’s next engagement against Arsenal is the big one for both, which plays into the idea of an epic Liverpool send off for Jurgen Klopp, who has only road trips to United and Aston Villa to concern him.\n\nSam Cunningham: I’d love Arsenal to win it. A league is far stronger and exciting when multiple participants share the prospect of winning it, in my opinion. But I still think it will be Manchester City, again. They have missed Kevin De Bruyne and Erling Haaland for so much of the season, yet neither Arsenal nor Liverpool have been able to open a gap on them and they will probably prove too strong in the final months.\n\nDaniel Storey: I’m increasingly convinced that Liverpool will. They don’t play another team in the current top five until May. If they get a lead, I think the emotional heft of Jurgen Klopp leaving will carry them through the tough late run to their perfect ending.\n\nMark Douglas: Only at Manchester City could collecting 11 points from a possible 16 constitute a wobble. Even though they’re third now – and were rocked by Liverpool in the second half on Sunday – I still believe their experience of these run-ins combined with their world class talent will tell. Crucially they have key games against Arsenal and Villa at fortress Etihad.\n\nOliver Young-Myles: Premier League title wins are built on solid foundations and Arsenal have the best defence in the division by some distance. That they are now scoring so freely too makes them the favourites. Take four points from trips to the Etihad and the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium and the trophy will be theirs.\n\nJames Gray: Can scarcely believe I’m saying this but I really think Arsenal will win the league. City looked so vulnerable against Liverpool and the Gunners should think they can beat them at the end of the month. Do that, and it will feel like a decisive blow.\n\nMichael Hincks: The head is ruling the heart and says Manchester City, with 10 games to go, are still going to win by a cushion of at least a couple points. Arsenal need a result at the Etihad to make me change my mind, but then, then, I look at the fixtures and think… Liverpool can run City close.\n\nEvan Bartlett: I look at the fixtures and I can’t see Liverpool dropping many points. The Reds have navigated a tricky period without a host of key players and now title winners like Alisson, Alexander-Arnold and Salah will be returning refreshed. It will take a special team to stop Klopp’s perfect farewell.\n\nBen Saunders: Arsenal should have won it last season, have strengthened, won close games, battered teams and are coming into their best form at the right time. Trips to Wolves and Spurs on successive Saturdays in April will be key.\n\nWho do you think will win the title? Have your say on our Facebook page here\n\nWho Opta predicts for the title\n\nThe supercomputer at Opta has been working out the percentages all season, and only in December did City’s chances drop below 50 per cent for the first time.\n\nCity were the heavy favourites heading into the new season, but a loss at Aston Villa on 6 December and draw at Palace 10 days later made a few think twice.\n\nNevertheless, they have always remained the favourites, while Liverpool’s chances have steadily increased. Arsenal have also enjoyed a recent boost given their eight-match winning run in the league.\n\nAs a result, after the weekend’s fixtures Opta have City dropping below 50 per cent again to 45.9 per cent, while Liverpool are 35.3 per cent and Arsenal 18.8 per cent.\n\nThe tightest Premier League title race ever?\n\nAs it stands, yes – between three teams, anyway.\n\nThere have been some barnstorming climaxes to seasons in years gone by, and whether this season follows suit only time will tell.\n\nFor now, it has the makings of a classic, and could top the following races that were close at this stage of the season:\n\n2021-22 – One point separated City from Liverpool with nine games to go. They both won seven and drew twice as City pipped Liverpool by a point.\n\n2018-19 – The second occasion where three clubs had 60 or more points with 10 to go. Liverpool had 69, City 68, and Spurs 60. City won 14 straight to finish the season to win the title by a point, with Liverpool only slipping up once with a draw in their last 10 games.\n\n2013-14 – Chelsea had a four-point lead over Liverpool and Arsenal and were six clear of City, but in the Steven Gerrard slip year it was City who would go on to win the title by two points.\n\n2011-12 – The best final day of the Premier League era, as United – who held a one-point lead over City with 10 to go – and then extended it to five points with just four games to go, lost to City on goal difference. Agueroooo.\n\n2009-10 – Just three points separated Chelsea, United and Arsenal with 10 to go, with Chelsea going on to win ahead of United by a point.\n\n2007-08 – The first occasion where three clubs had 60 or more points with 10 to go. Arsenal had 66 points and had played a game more than United (64) and Chelsea (61), who both had 10 to go. United won the league by two points ahead of Chelsea, Arsenal two further points adrift.\n\n2001-02 – Just two points separated United, Arsenal and Liverpool, but Arsenal went on to storm it by seven points in the end.\n\n1998-99 – Four points separated United from Arsenal and Chelsea, and though they stumbled United would go on to win league on the final day at Arsenal’s expense.\n\n1997-98 – The table was a mess at this stage with United nine clear but having played three more than Arsenal. Arsenal ended W8 L2 in final 10 to win the title by a point.\n\n1995-96 – Newcastle were a point above United and with a game in hand. They lost the title to United by four points.\n\n1994-95 – Blackburn led United by two points with 10 to go and won by a point on the final day.\n\nArsenal’s remaining Premier League fixtures\n\n31 March – Man City (a)\n\n3 April – Luton (h)\n\n6 April – Brighton (a)\n\n13 April – Aston Villa (h)\n\n20 April* – Wolves (a)\n\n27 April* – Tottenham (a)\n\n4 May* – Bournemouth (h)\n\n11 May* – Man Utd (a)\n\n19 May – Everton (h)\n\nTBC – Chelsea (h)\n\n*Date could change for TV\n\nLiverpool’s remaining Premier League fixtures\n\n31 March – Brighton (h)\n\n4 April – Sheff Utd (h)\n\n7 April – Man Utd (a)\n\n14 April – Crystal Palace (h)\n\n20 April* – Fulham (a)\n\n27 April* – West Ham (a)\n\n4 May* – Tottenham (h)\n\n11 May* – Aston Villa (a)\n\n19 May – Wolves (h)\n\nTBC – Everton (a)\n\n*Date could change for TV\n\nMan City’s remaining Premier League fixtures\n\n31 March – Arsenal (h)\n\n3 April – Aston Villa (h)\n\n6 April – Crystal Palace (a)\n\n13 April – Luton (h)\n\n20 April* – Tottenham (a)\n\n27 April* – Nottingham Forest (a)\n\n4 May* – Wolves (h)\n\n11 May* – Fulham (a)\n\n19 May – West Ham (h)\n\nTBC – Brighton (a)\n\n*Date could change for TV"
