        "text": "Goodbye\n\nThat's all from us for today, as always thank you for your company and for all of your contributions to the managerial merry-go-round chat.\n\nBefore we go, here's a reminder of today's top stories:\n\nBayern Munich boss Thomas Tuchel to leave at end of season\n\n'Don't criticise Haaland - he will shut your mouth'\n\nTightest title race in years - who will win the Premier League?\n\nKane statue in storage with nowhere to go\n\nMillwall set to replace Edwards with ex-boss Harris\n\nDon't forget there's Premier League and Champions League action tonight and BBC Sport will bring you live text commentary of both of those games.\n\nLiverpool v Luton Town (19:30 GMT)\n\nPorto v Arsenal (20:00 GMT)- you can also listen to BBC Radio 5 Live commentary of this match here.\n\nEnjoy the rest of your day and see you soon!\n\n'We have earned the right to be here'\n\nFC Porto v Arsenal (20:00 GMT)\n\nMikel Arteta feels \"energy\" and \"enthusiasm\" will have to compensate for a lack of experience in the Champions League as his side prepare for their last-16 tie against Porto.\n\nThe Gunners have not gone beyond this stage of the competition since 2010 and Arteta's side boast little know-how in Europe's elite competition.\n\n\"We don't have the experience, that's the reality - 95 per cent of these players haven't played this competition, they haven't played the last 16,\" said Arteta.\n\n\"I haven't (managed at this stage). But they have so much energy and enthusiasm to play well and that's our desire and how we're going to play the game.\n\n\"It's great. We have earned the right to be here. It's been seven years since we've been at the top table for these kind of matches and 14 years since we were able to go to the next stage.\n\n\"That's the challenge. We know what is ahead of us, but we are very excited to face it and to go for it with full belief, that's for sure.\"\n\nName the Arsenal squad that played against Porto in 2009-10\n\nFC Porto v Arsenal (20:00 GMT)\n\nThe last time Arsenal made the quarter-finals of the Champions League was the 2009-10 season. The team they beat in the last 16? Porto.\n\nThat is the same challenge facing Mikel Arteta's side this season as they look to reach the last eight for the first time in 14 years.\n\nArsene Wenger's side lost 2-1 away in 2010 but then thrashed the Portuguese side 5-0 at home to progress.\n\nCan you name the side that started that day? One clue for you, one of the scorers came off the bench so isn't a name you're looking for.\n\nTake our on Arsenal quiz ahead of tonight's game here.\n\nArsenal team news\n\nFC Porto v Arsenal (20:00 GMT)\n\nArsenal midfielder Thomas Partey has returned to training after four months out with a thigh injury, while Fabio Vieira is nearing a comeback after having groin surgery in November.\n\nGabriel Jesus (knee), Oleksandr Zinchenko (calf) and Takehiro Tomiyasu (niggle) remain doubtful after missing Saturday's 5-0 win at Burnley.\n\nPorto could be without Mehdi Taremi after the club confirmed the Iran striker was struggling with a thigh injury sustained in training on Sunday.\n\nThe Portuguese side are already missing Nigeria full-back Zaidu Sanusi, who is out for the season with a knee injury, with centre-back Ivan Marcano another long-term absentee.\n\nBBC Sport has a dedicated Arsenal page packed with news, analysis and fan views - get it here\n\nKlopp 'one of my favourites' but 'we're going to Anfield to try and win'\n\nLiverpool v Luton Town (19:30 GMT)\n\nLuton boss Rob Edwards says he \"hopes it's not the last time\" he faces Jurgen Klopp on Wednesday but he is taking his side to Anfield \"to try and win\".\n\nThe Hatters face league leaders Liverpool having dropped back into the Premier League relegation zone.\n\n\"He's one of my favourites I've got to say,\" Edwards said pre-match.\n\n\"He's got an amazing presence, personality, charisma. The way he leads his team, the way he wants to play - he wants to attack, he wants an exciting game.\n\n\"They want some control as well but I just love how his teams play - they're always on the front foot. They want to win, they want to defend high and aggressively. Everything about what he's done for God knows how many years is obviously very impressive.\n\n\"I hope it's not the last time I'm able to go up against him.\n\n\"Jurgen and his staff trust their players and he's not afraid to put young players in or change things up if they need to because they just do what they do and play their way. He trusts them.\n\n\"Whatever team they put out tomorrow will be very good, no doubt about that.\"\n\nLiverpool v Luton Town: Sutton's prediction\n\nLiverpool v Luton Town (19:30 GMT)\n\nBBC pundit Chris Sutton is making predictions for all 380 Premier League matches again this season, against a variety of guests.\n\nFor Liverpool's game against Luton Town on Wednesday, which has been brought forward from this weekend because the Reds play in the Carabao Cup final against Chelsea on Sunday, he takes on former England striker Jermain Defoe.\n\nSutton's prediction: 2-0\n\nLiverpool needed a 95th-minute goal from Luis Diaz to rescue a point at Kenilworth Road in November, but I am expecting things to be a bit more straightforward for them at Anfield.\n\nJurgen Klopp's side have some injury problems to contend with - especially up front, where they are running out of fit forwards - but I still don't think Luton will keep them out.\n\nDefoe's prediction: 4-1\n\nLuton are 'really together' as a squad - Klopp\n\nLiverpool v Luton Town (19:30 GMT)\n\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp has praised the the \"incredible\" way that Luton Town play.\n\nSpeaking in his pre-match news conference, he said: \"Set-pieces are one strength [of Luton] but I have to say the way they play their system with their confidence level - they play incredible but even in games they lost they were in the game. We experienced a tough game there, but it was a different game to how they play now.\n\n\"Now in possession they found a structure where everyone is really comfortable. Ross Barkley is one of these nice stories who really is back to his best, or better. He plays a deeper role, super disciplined on the ball and extremely strong.\n\n\"[Albert Sambi] Lokonga when you see him you can tell he's an Arsenal player on a loan deal, it's interesting. They are strong and experienced. They are a really together [squad].\n\n\"The situation at Bournemouth with the captain [when Tom Lockyer collapsed] it brought them closer and made them think some things are worse in life than maybe getting relegated.\n\n\"In general they deserve respect and we have to show that with a proper Liverpool performance and I mean everyone who enters the gate to Anfield has to be on their toes.\"\n\nLiverpool v Luton: Team news\n\nLiverpool v Luton (19:30 GMT)\n\nLiverpool will be without Diogo Jota and Curtis Jones, who were both taken off in the win over Brentford.\n\nDarwin Nunez, who also picked up an injury in that game, will be assessed but Trent Alexander-Arnold, Alisson, Joel Matip and Dominik Szoboszlai all remain out.\n\nLuton's Elijah Adebayo is out after suffering a hamstring injury in the warm-up against Manchester United.\n\nFellow forward Jacob Brown has had knee surgery and so also misses out.\n\nMads Andersen and Marvelous Nakamba are still on the sidelines.\n\n'We need to be brave'\n\nLiverpool v Luton Town (19:30 GMT)\n\nLuton were minutes away from a famous victory over Liverpool at Kenilworth Road in November but manager Rob Edwards wants to go one better than the 1-1 draw they managed, external.\n\n\"We will take a draw but we're going there to try and win,\" he added. \"It's not about repeating the last one.\n\n\"We're going to have to defend very well, manage the ball well in turnovers and transitions, and when we have the opportunity to take the ball we need to be brave, play to our strengths and try and take the spaces they will give away.\n\n\"We're going to need to be ruthless in both boxes because chances at Anfield will be few and far between, we're looking forward to that challenge but we're not going to go there and sit back and wait, we're going to try and win it.\"\n\nCity favourites but 'danger all around' in 'amazing' title race\n\nManchester City's win over Brentford on Tuesday means the top three clubs in the Premier League are separated by just two points with 13 games to play.\n\nLiverpool lead City by one point, with Arsenal one point further back in third spot.\n\n\"It's amazing, this is the one we want,\" former City midfielder Michael Brown told BBC Radio 5 Live's Football Daily podcast.\n\n\"We've seen Liverpool and City do it several times right to the end and City have just got over the line with an incredible run of games. Arsenal are certainly contributing - it was a big result against Liverpool and they followed it up with a real demolition of West Ham.\n\n\"It's going to be tight. Can it swing any way? Yes it can. Normally I'm sitting there much more confident thinking that City will take the title, but this season I've got that doubt.\n\n\"City have got the best chance, they're the favourites, but there's danger all around. The amount of games, you're going to need a little bit of luck, consistency where possible and [avoiding] injuries as well - could that be key?\n\n\"We've seen Pep Guardiola not play Kevin de Bruyne [against Brentford], is he keeping him up his sleeve for the bigger ones? You have to manage that load - you can get that right and you can get them wrong.\"\n\nListen to more reaction on BBC Sounds\n\nDo Arteta's side have the most favourable run?\n\nArsenal trail Manchester City by a point but are currently the league's form team, having started a calendar year with five successive wins for the first time in their history.\n\nAs well as putting six goals past West Ham and five past both Crystal Palace and Burnley, the Gunners also moved to within two points of Liverpool with victory over the Reds in a tense encounter at Emirates Stadium.\n\nMikel Arteta's side have a favourable run of fixtures before hosting London rivals Chelsea in mid-March, taking on an inconsistent Newcastle side on Saturday night before games against Sheffield United and Brentford.\n\nThey visit Manchester City on the final day of March - just over two weeks after welcoming Chelsea to Emirates Stadium."
