        "text": "So last week, UEFA made the draw for Champions League. Well, it wasn’t so much a draw, more a repeat, like watching a classic episode of some old sitcom on Dave. The same three English teams drew the same three German teams, and Manchester City, the Premier League champions, got stiffed, as usual. Arsenal, meanwhile, sailed from a 1-0 aggregate win over Besiktas in pre-qualifying tie, straight into pot one. I wrote about the sorry status quo of UEFA seeding here, and even proposed an alternate process, in which the champions of the strongest European leagues were rewarded. It caused a little fuss. See below.\n\nAnyway, the next day a wonderful thing happened. UEFA announced that from next season the seeding system would be changed to put greater emphasis on league champions, much in line with my thoughts. I shouldn’t have been surprised really – Michel Platini, the UEFA president, had agreed and suggested an overhaul was due when we met last year. I just didn’t think he would have the will to take on the elite. I’m happy to say I was wrong. As for the backlash against the backlash, just read on. This might take a little longer than anticipated – although anyone who has ever seen a UEFA draw will certainly know how that feels.\n\nAll I see here is journalists’ shenanigans, creating stories for more clicks. We all know the rules, so why the fuss? FIFA and UEFA use a similar formula to determine the top seeded teams. Holland have never won the World Cup but they've always been in the top seeds due to their consistency and performance at international level. Just because Nigeria are African champions doesn't warrant them a higher seeding slot over England. It's all about consistency and performance in the Champions League and not domestic positions. As far as the system is concerned Arsenal deserve to be ahead of City. End of. Mystical, Cardiff.\n\nExcept it wasn’t end of, was it, because the UEFA have now announced they are altering the seeding system in time for 2015-16. So far from being mere click-bait, the unfairness that I had been banging on about long before newspaper websites became big business several years ago, was finally recognised. And you do know you’ve undermined your own argument with the Dutch analogy? No, Holland have never won a World Cup, yes they are frequently among the seeds. Do you know why? Because their consistent performance in recent competitive qualifying matches is what counts, not their historic underachievement. They are measured on the present, not the past. Holland don’t amass points based around having a good team when Johan Cruyff was playing: it is because their current form puts them among the world’s highest performing teams. Frankly, mate, I don’t think you’re very mystical at all. This bloke, he’s mystical.\n\nIt’s disgusting that Liverpool got an easy group. Yesus Khan, England.\n\nNot really. In any system there will always be the luck of the draw. In the original article, I proposed a way that I think is much fairer but, even using that, Manchester City from pot one could still have drawn Barcelona, Roma and Porto, and Arsenal from pot four could draw BATE Borisov, Basle and CSKA Moscow. You can never fully protect any draw from good or bad luck, but you can try to reward champions in a tournament called the Champions League. As for the ease of Liverpool’s group, I don’t agree. Ludogorets Razgrad beat PSV Eindhoven and Dinamo Zagreb home and away in the Europa League last year, and then eliminated Lazio in the knockout round. They also defeated Partizan Belgrade and Steaua Bucharest to qualify for the Champions League this season. Basle, as Manchester United found out, can be tricky, too. Liverpool should progress but one slip against a smaller club could cause huge problems as Real Madrid are the other team in the group.\n\nYou say that Arsenal being top seeds is a travesty, however, they have outperformed Manchester City in the Champions League. City couldn't even finish above Ajax two years ago, while Arsenal were knocked out on away goals by the eventual winners, Bayern Munich. Last year, Arsenal beat Borussia Dortmund and Napoli, before they were knocked out in the last 16 with City. BNB, London.\n\nYes, City – the champions of England – performed poorly in 2012-13 having been drawn against Real Madrid (champions of Spain), Borussia Dortmund (champions of Germany) and Ajax (champions of Holland). Arsenal – who came third, 19 points beind City – did have champions in their group but Montpelier (France) and Olympiacos (Greece) come from inferior leagues to Spain and Germany, while their final opponent club in Group B, Schalke 04, had finished third in Germany, 17 points behind City’s opponents Borussia Dortmund. Even so, Arsenal finished behind them, which is how they ended up facing Bayern Munich. Your memory of that game as a narrow defeat on away goals, is somewhat rose-tinted, too.\n\nArsenal played Munich for 180 minutes and were losing on aggregate for 173 of them. The other seven minutes were a draw. Munich won the first leg at the Emirates 3-1, thought they had the tie wrapped up, got sloppy and conceded two goals at home, the second with four minutes to go. The seeding in last year’s campaign was less of an issue for Manchester City as they were not champions, so not deserving of a place in pot one. Having said this, Arsenal had to pre-qualify but were then drawn from pot one in a group without champions comprising Napoli (second in Italy by nine points), Marseille (second in France by 12 points) and Borussia Dortmund (second in Germany by 25 points). Top seeded Arsenal didn’t win the group that time either. Their European record is strong in part because they are protected by the historical anomalies of the seeding system.\n\nThe sooner you realise it is about money and not football the sooner you will realise why it has been drawn like this. If it was a real Champions League we would not have second, third and fourth placed teams in it. Ted, United Kingdom.\n\nYes, Ted, but the modern Champions League is a better, stronger competition than the old, champions only, European Cup. I don’t mind the new format, I just think seeding systems should reward current form not historic entitlement. UEFA agree.\n\nHow about Manchester City make it out of the group and accumulate some points first? They win a couple of things and think they deserve to play with the big kids. They have a lot of growing up to do first. Paulo23, London.\n\nManchester City did make it out of the group last year. Bayern Munich’s group I recall. Didn’t stop them drawing them again this season, though. As for the airily-dismissed ‘couple of things’ they have won, you mean the league title. If it’s so meaningless, why have Manchester United spent over £200m in a year getting back in the hunt?\n\nHow about asking why some league champions such as Celtic have to play qualifiers, while some second and even third placed teams do not? Mr Christian, Croydon.\n\nThe simple answer is because it is no longer a Champions League but a competition that involves the best teams in Europe. Celtic are fundamentally not in that bracket as this season’s results suggest, so must pre-qualify. If every European champion got a free pass the group stage would comprise an unwieldy 53 teams minimum. And are we seriously suggesting that the champions of Andorra, say, bring more to the competition than Arsenal? I think UEFA are playing all the right teams; just not necessarily in the right order, as Eric Morecambe might say.\n\nThe real travesty is what you are proposing. If you only take into account the league record of Manchester City or any other club for the last three or so years, how is it fair to those that have consistently qualified for the Champions League over the last 17 or 18 years and, yes, won more league titles than City in that period too? Arsenal have 17 consecutive qualifications, Real Madrid 18 and Manchester United 18 consecutive until this season. Your proposal simply reward the one or two time league winners at the expense of clubs who have worked really hard over a long period of time to consistently qualify. Manchester City are only as unlucky as Arsenal drawing Barcelona in the knockout stages twice in a row. If City is a better team than Arsenal, Real Madrid and Barcelona this year they shouldn’t be scared of playing them. Seeded or not, you will face them sooner or later. If you want Manchester City to duck tough competition in the group, then that’s another way of allowing them to get an easy ride to the knock-out stages, creating the same problem you are trying to solve. This is more an emotional proposal than a sensible one. Offering City the jackpot for winning the league once or twice is the farthest thing from fairness. What happened to meritocracy over a long term investment? GNUS, Boston.\n\nThe meritocracy is the league table, mate. And who cares what happened 17 years ago? Have a look at season 1997-98 in English football. Eight of the teams in the Premier League are not there any more, two are in England’s third tier, one doesn’t exist. Back then, only the top two qualified for the Champions League so Arsenal would not even have made it into the competition for the last nine years. And qualifying for the UEFA Cup in 1997-98 were Leeds United, Blackburn Rovers and Aston Villa, two of them now in the Championship. So 17 years has no relevance. And you don’t think a club like Manchester City was working hard, too, in that time, living in the shadow of Manchester United, with any good player poached by their wealthier rivals. You have talked so much rot here. Arsenal were unlucky to draw Barcelona in 2009-10, but ended up playing them the next year because they came second in a group featuring Shakhtar Donetsk, Braga and Partizan Belgrade. Also, I’m guessing City would not be much fazed at playing Arsenal, considering they beat them 6-3 at the Etihad Stadium last season and drew 1-1 away. Finally, I am not advocating Manchester City ducking tough competition – it is the champions that should be rewarded, not an individual club. The seeds from England should be the champions, and if that is Manchester City, Arsenal or Milton Keynes Dons, I will support that ranking all the way. The Spice Girls were big in 1997, not so relevant now. As 1997 goes, I’m a little more partial to this myself.\n\nIf the seedings exist to protect the elite why would Bayern Munich be happy being in a group containing Manchester City instead of Arsenal? Skull023, Manchester.\n\nI would imagine they are not happy at all. The seedings do protect the elite, but any draw will always contain a random element beyond UEFA’s control.\n\nIf they are winners of their league then I guess they are super strong so they wouldn't have problems meeting the fourth-placed teams like Arsenal, seeded or not? So what is your problem? I guess seeding in tennis is also rubbish? Why shouldn't Roger Federer be allowed to meet Andy Murray in the first round of a grand slam? KwameBK, Sutton.\n\nI didn’t say the concept of seeding was rubbish. I said it of UEFA’s seeding. Also, your question of Manchester City works equally well of Arsenal. With that 17 years of European experience, what would they have to fear if placed in pot four?\n\nHow are Manchester City who have won the Premier League twice, and played in the Champions League three times, ranked 16 in Europe; and Tottenham Hotspur who haven't won the title for over 50 years, and only played in the Champions League once, ranked 17. Bodo, Gravesend.\n\nWrong way round, Bodo old son. As it stands right now, Tottenham are 16 and City are 17. Want some more? Birmimgham City 85th, Everton 102nd. Hull City 105th, Malmo (champions of Sweden) 143rd. But here’s something interesting. According to the very clever Bert Kassies whose co-efficient tables update on a match by match basis, Manchester United are currently rated 100.992, placing them sixth, and very vulnerable to Atletico Madrid (99.599), Valencia (96.599) and Schalke 04 (96.111). Arsenal are currently tenth (91.992). When the seedings were calculated for the current Champions League groups they were ninth, but Manchester United and Valencia above them did not make it into the tournament. Next season, however, there would have been a very real danger of failing to make pot A, even if UEFA did not change their system to reward the champions. Just qualifying and then losing to the first good team at the knockout stage is not enough. Arsenal, in particular, need to start making more significant serious progress.\n\nSorry, but where exactly is the problem? Manchester City are in pot two now. When they first qualified for the 2011/12 competition they were in pot three. If they play to their ability, get out of the group stage and go far in the competition this season then they could be in pot one next year. They are already being rewarded for their success in this competition, not for their success in the Premier League. They are two different entities. Why should a team that have qualified for the tournament after managing to win the domestic title for the first time in 40 years be seeded ahead of a team that have been competing regularly in European competition for a couple of decades? The coefficient system clearly rewards success and penalises failure and mediocrity. Matt, London.\n\nDo your research, Matt. Manchester City are clinging to pot two by their fingertips. They were the last team in it, 2.621 co-efficient points ahead of Bayer Leverkusen in pot three. As for ended up in pot one next year, Real Madrid received 39.6 points for winning the competition, and adding that to Manchester City’s current total would give them 108.9636 points, placing them sixth overall. All it would then need is for City to conquer Europe and Atletico Madrid, Valencia, Schalke 04, Arsenal, Porto, Borussia Dortmund, Paris Saint-Germain, AC Milan, Zenit St Petersburg and Tottenham Hotspur to fail to register any points at all this season and, yes, that’s exactly where they would be.\n\nYou have been writing some of the most important columns in Daily Mail, you have worked hard, you have earned it. Would you like to start fresh, like an intern tomorrow? See the similarity? Varun Pandey, Bermuda.\n\nNo, I don’t. I start afresh every day. If someone is writing better material than mine it gets in the paper ahead of my stuff. I have a column because they think I write them reasonably well. The moment that changes, no amount of hard work or presumption on my part will alter the inevitable conclusion. That’s a really poor analogy, Varun. The best, most competitive, workplaces invariably deploy a quite ruthless meritocracy.\n\nThe domestic title only matters domestically. Why should UEFA change the rules so that teams like Manchester City benefit? The teams in pot A deserve to be there and have worked very hard. Chelsea at one point needed to win the competition so that they could participate the following year. I look forward to watching the games from when the group stages commence. You can switch to another sport, no one is stopping you, Martin. Sahwira Dougie, Zimbabwe.\n\nNo, the domestic title is the key to it all. If Arsenal do not finish top four in England, they do not even get to enter the Champions League – so let’s not pretend European competition is ring-fenced, with a different way of measuring success. It’s very essence, the participating teams, comes from domestic leagues. Maybe it’s you who needs to switch to another sport, because you sure as hell don’t understand this one.\n\nWhat´s the fuss: Manchester City have relatively easy games against weak teams Roma and CSKA Moscow. If City can´t beat those two sides home and away then they don´t deserve to progress. Mediastarguest, Madrid.\n\nNot sure it’s quite as easy as that but, yes, with their level of investment City should progress.\n\nTelevision’s control over the draw is what I found so unfair. This went almost unnoticed. Gkeebs, Stockport.\n\nI totally agree. If you haven’t spotted this, television companies in countries with four competing teams (England, Germany, Spain) or two (France, Italy, Russia) want their matches split equally over Tuesday and Wednesday. So it quickly became apparent last week that once Juventus had been drawn from pot 2 and placed in Group A, Roma, the only other Italian team in it, had to go in the lower half of the draw and face teams in Groups E to H. The presence of Paris Saint-Germain in Group F meant Monaco had to go in Groups A to D. And you are right, this passed unnoticed. By the time we have factored in that teams from the same country cannot play each other – again to give the TV companies value – it is possible to start calling the draw at the midway stage. Once Juventus were out it was 50-50 that Roma would play one of Manchester City or Chelsea. They couldn’t face Liverpool or Arsenal.\n\nChampions League seeing is based on historical performance not just league standing in the last season. What has Manchester City done in the Champions League, they only just recently started qualifying for it? Arsenal always make it out of the group stage, 17 years straight, and are past semi-finalists, and finalist many times. Boram, Bangkok.\n\n'Hi, it’s Boram from Bangkok, regular listener, first time caller. I’m new to this football lark and rather confused about issues such as Arsenal’s pedigree in Europe. Any chance of a history lesson?' Why yes, Boram, certainly. Arsenal have completed an impressive 16 consecutive campaigns in the Champions League and have failed to make it out of the group stage just twice. They have exited at the last 16 stage, however, on eight occasions, and have been beaten quarter-finalists four times. Contrary to popular belief they have not made it to the final and semi-final many times. They were beaten finalists in 2006 and lost in the semi-final in 2009. Arsenal have not been beyond the round of 16 since 2010.\n\nIf the seedings were constantly updated then, if Liverpool had won the league last season, they would have gone straight into Pot 1 having not been in the Champions League for five years. Carlooooos14, Gloucester.\n\nYes. And the problem is?\n\nIsn’t it time we let the clubs who finish fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh play off for the last spot in the Champions League, rather than let fourth place finish specialists Arsenal in every year, just to get knocked out? Mart, East Sussex.\n\nNot really. Why should Manchester United, 15 points behind Arsenal, get to play them again off levels? They had their chance to qualify, over 38 matches. They weren’t good enough. There should be no safety net. Arsenal fully deserve their place in the competition.\n\nA point about the author: the other week it was a pop at financial fair play because people couldn't throw money around that their club couldn't afford, and this week it's a moan about the draw Manchester City have got. I thought he was a Watford supporter? Lewis, Manchester.\n\nNew to this, aren’t you mate?\n\nIt is not just the seeding system. UEFA must stop sides that are knocked out then getting another bite of the cherry in the Europa League. Absolute farce. One Day, Dunmow.\n\nAgreed. I think it devalues the competition beyond repair.\n\nWhy have an issue with Arsenal being in pot one? Other top seeded teams include Porto, Benfica and Atletico Madrid, none of whom have been in the Champions League consistently for ten years, let alone always getting through the group stage. Bob Duck, London.\n\nNo issue with Atletico and Benfica getting top seeded as national champions, their rankings would not change in my system. Porto would be in pot four with Arsenal.\n\nFairness? What planet are you from? Manchester City should be in pot 1? They have the biggest average salary per head of any sports team in the world. If you want to talk fairness, why not ban Manchester City from any competition this year, as they are dependent on their sugar daddy and a massive influx of cash. How is that fair to, say, Hull City? At least Arsenal have always lived within their means, and have still qualified for the Champions League for 17 straight seasons. You give one example but forget the blatant unfairness of all else. Rolls123, United Kingdom.\n\nMuch as you vilify City, while conveniently forgetting the £50m given to Arsenal by Danny Fiszman, that kept the club in contention when Arsene Wenger arrived? Back in the days when this stuff was known as investment, not cheating.\n\nTedious and bent? Just because you perceive the English clubs have difficult groups? Obviously if the same teams qualify you will get repeated fixtures and as a Bayern Munich fan I am not too pleased about having to play Manchester City again. Chelsea and Arsenal have also drawn the same teams but that is just the way it is. City won’t have much chance to improve their co-efficient for next term as I doubt they will make it out of that group. Germany 3:0 England. FCB4ever, Glasgow.\n\nDid you not pay attention last year? Arsenal 1 Borussia Dortmund 2; Borussia Dortmund 0 Arsenal 1. Schalke 0 Chelsea 3; Chelsea 3 Schalke 0. Manchester City 1 Bayern Munich 3; Bayern Munich 2 Manchester City 3. So two ties that ended a win apiece and one that ended 6-0 on aggregate to the English club. Yet you fancy a German whitewash. How modest.\n\nI don't think the journalist understands the system, which is a UEFA tournament rewarding consistent progress in previous UEFA competitions. Manchester City, for example, will get a better seeding if they progress consistently over a number of years. Furthermore if they are really the best English team, their seeding doesn't matter because they'll progress in any case. Get it? Steve788, Lowestoft.\n\nYes, but you plainly don’t because as a team lower down gets a harder ride than a team in pot one, it then becomes harder for them to make progress because the draw is always skewed against them. Anyway, here’s me not getting it, in conversation with Michel Platini in April 2013.\n\nSamuel: Arsenal played Olympiacos at the group stage this year, so that’s 2012, they played them in the group stage in 2011, they played them in the group stages in 2009 –\n\nPlatini: Arsene [Wenger] likes to go to Greece – he has many friends.\n\nSamuel: The seeding system often means that the same rematches occur. Should you not freshen that?\n\nPlatini: Yes. We have to do something. I totally agree with you. But we don’t want to change every year. We go in cycles and the next cycle will be in 2015 and perhaps we will have to refresh something. For me it is not normal that the champion of the competition is not –\n\nSamuel: Top seed. Absolutely.\n\nPlatini: But it’s an old system and I have to discuss with the clubs, too, because of that. Real Madrid will be not in favour, Arsenal. I think we have to discuss but I totally agree – we think about that.\n\nSamuel: Manchester City won the league last year, ended up in the hardest group. Arsenal haven’t won a thing since 2005 and are top seeds.\n\nPlatini: After the draw in Monte Carlo this year, I said to my team you have to propose me something better and to put a bigger implementation for the champion of the competition of the domestic league. I totally agree. I don’t know if it’s easy to do but we have to do something. But you know we have the problem of some clubs like Milan who say, ‘We have the most titled team in Europe and we want to play in the Champions League every year.’\n\nSamuel: So get 11 better players and win the league.\n\nPlatini: Oui. We have to help the champions more than the other, it’s not normal that we have a group where Manchester City is the fourth team of a group where there is only champions – it is not right. I totally agree with you. But to explain that in the administration is not so easy, eh? In UEFA? Now I am the boss I have to say yes, we have to do that.\n\nSomething is wrong when teams continuously meet the same opposition year on year. It would be very simple to fix this glitch. Papabear, London.\n\nYes, it merely requires greater flexibility in the seedings to reward current form. For example: by seeding the holders and the champions of the best leagues, the top seeds this year would be Real Madrid, Atletico Madrid, Bayern Munich, Manchester City, Benfica, Juventus, CSKA Moscow and Paris Saint-Germain. The top seeds the previous year would be: Bayern Munich, Barcelona, Manchester United, Juventus, Porto, Paris Saint-Germain, Shakhtar Donetsk and CSKA Moscow. So four changes in just one year. Do you know how many changes there were this year from last? One. Atletico Madrid in for Manchester United.\n\nYeah sure, there's a meeting with Manchester City's badge up on the wall saying, ‘this is the team we dislike’. It doesn't matter that this form of seeding has happened for years even before City had a sniff at finishing mid-table. You’ve got to love conspiracy theories. Plastics Everywhere, United Kingdom.\n\nI don’t think there is an anti-Manchester City conspiracy at work in the draw, Plastic, I think the inequalities of the system have been highlighted because a team has come from outside the elite to win our Premier League.\n\nIn college, my Descriptive Geometry teacher used this method: we had six exams over the year, but the second was worth twice as much as the first, the third three times as much as the first, and so on. His reasoning was that you needed to know what came before to understand the next step, so complexity increased linearly. Something like this could be applied to evaluating both clubs and leagues. Consider the last five seasons, but the most recent one is worth five times as much as the one five years ago. This would give a more accurate presentation of worth, while softening the impact of any freak year. Rocha, Portugal.\n\nAlternately, seed the champions. Who cares what happened in 2009? Five seasons ago, Portsmouth were in the Premier League. They are now in League Two. This chap was planning a series of concerts in London that year, too. Things change.\n\nI have to agree about the predictability. Barcelona faced AC Milan three times on the trot in the group stages. ESP81012, Spain.\n\nI think this is as much the motivation behind the change as any move towards fairness. UEFA know that, soon, it will simply become a turn-off, unless there are fresh matches.\n\nAnd yet, Arsenal drawing Barcelona two years running and then Bayern Munich two years running in the knockout stages raised no eyebrows. Nick, London.\n\nNo, because on three of the four occasions, the unfortunate draw occurred because Arsenal finished second in the group. You will notice no complaints about Manchester City’s pairing with Barcelona last season – or about any second round pairing come to that.\n\nDo you think is fair for Chelsea to build points during five years, reaching the final and semi-final, while Liverpool come in ahead of them because they were second in the league? Who put England’s clubs second in UEFA’s co-efficient? Without Chelsea and Manchester United you wouldn't be thinking of top seeding in the first place. Time to go, London.\n\nFair point – but it does rather make Chelsea and Manchester United’s cup runs in Europe seem like an altruistic act. You and I know the benefits to other English clubs is merely a by-product, not the motivation – and that Chelsea and Manchester United would also benefit down the line from any good work done in Europe by their rivals.\n\nLiverpool have won it five times, and got a cup to keep yet they were third seeds. Manchester City have never even got close to the quarter finals with all their billions. It's called luck of the draw, get over it. I'm beginning to think Martin Samuel is an idiot. Roger, United Kingdom.\n\nNo, mate, the idiot is anyone who thinks what happened in 1976-77 is relevant to competition seeding today.\n\nWhat rubbish. If they can’t compete with the top teams they have no business calling themselves the best team in England. Open Eyes, London.\n\nI don’t think they need to call themselves the best team in England. Until someone takes it off them, I think that big trophy they were given on May 11 sort of says it for them.\n\nThe best team in England last year were Liverpool, not Manchester City and every neutral would say the same. MJ Rooney, Manchester.\n\nNo, the best team wins the league and anyone who says otherwise is deluded. Also, if you want to go counter-intuitive on it, I’d say Chelsea’s 16 points from 18 against the other teams in the top four, indicate an even greater missed opportunity than Liverpool’s. Finally, it is worth pointing out that had Liverpool won the Premier League they would have been placed in pot three just the same; and that would not have been right, as it isn’t for City.\n\nThe clubs that are the top seeds have earned their place through progress in Europe. It took Chelsea three semi-finals in four years to climb into the top pot and finally avoid Barcelona. George, Winchester.\n\nYes, it wasn’t fair then, and it isn’t now.\n\nIt is simply the luck of a draw. Look at Liverpool, they were very fortunate but could have easily have pulled Roma from the last pot, then their group would have looked harder and City's much easier. This article feels like you had nothing else to come up with so just picked a random topic, no one has ever complained about it before. Hotwings97, Braintree.\n\nNo, Liverpool couldn’t have got Roma because of the need to separate the two Italian clubs for television. And I have been writing about this stuff for years mate, you just haven’t been reading – just as you were not paying attention to the nuances when the draw was made.\n\nIf your proposal went through you would be the first to complain how unbalanced the groups were. And you will complain if two easy teams are then paired in the first knock-out round as well. Fizmo, United Kingdom.\n\nNo system will ever be perfect, and a draw will always throw up some hardships and lucky breaks, but I would back the intrinsic fairness of my system. Here it is again:\n\nPOT 1 (the holders, plus the champions of the seven leagues with the strongest co-efficient): Real Madrid, Atletico Madrid, Bayern Munich, Manchester City, Benfica, Juventus, CSKA Moscow, Paris Saint-Germain.\n\nPOT 2 (the winners of leagues ranked eight to 15, with the second placed teams in the leagues ranked one to seven filling any gaps): Shakhtar Donetsk, Ajax, Anderlecht, Basle, Olympiacos, Barcelona, Liverpool, Borussia Dortmund.\n\nPOT 3 (the winners of leagues ranked 16 to 23, plus the second placed teams in leagues ranked one to 15 filling gaps, and after that the highest ranked third placed teams by country co-efficient): APOEL Nicosia, BATE Borisov, Sporting Lisbon, Roma, Zenit St Petersburg, Monaco, Galatasaray, Chelsea.\n\nPOT 4: (the remaining league winners by country co-efficient, plus all remaining teams): Malmo, Ludogorets Razgrad, Maribor, Schalke 04, Porto, Athletic Bilbao, Arsenal, Bayer Leverkusen.\n\nThe UEFA rankings protect the teams that have performed better in their competitions, as it should be. Your proposal of Malmo as a top seed is simply ridiculous. No competition in the world would do that because it would hurt their product. Dirk41, London.\n\nExcept in my system Malmo are in pot four because the level of performance of Swedish clubs is ranked 24th in Europe. I initially had them in pot 3, but have subsequently switched them with Galatasaray, who came second in Turkey. Either way, they were never anywhere near the top seeds in pot 1. Try reading the piece before commenting. It will save us both a lot of time.(Also if history is so important, I think you’ll find Malmo have reached as many European Cup/Champions League finals as Arsenal – or is it only 17 years that is important, not what went before?)\n\nMartin's proposal leaves no consideration for a club's performance in Europe. Using Chelsea as an example, we would be seeded lower than the champions of Ukraine, Belgium and Greece despite having a pretty high consistency in the Champions League - that isn't fair. A rejig of the seeding, giving more credence to a league winner while also rewarding good performances in the elite club competition would be the best way forward. A Davies, South Wales.\n\nI don’t disagree and I am sure that will be UEFA’s ultimate compromise. They have entire departments dedicated to factoring this stuff, and I admit my version takes one very basic principle – namely that you can’t be seeded above a team if you finished below them in your domestic league – and then applies that throughout the 32 clubs. Looking at my fantasy pots, however, I’m happy. I don’t see Chelsea having to handle Shakhtar Donetsk, Anderlecht or Olympiakos as the issue, more that the likes of Barcelona are also lurking in pot B and could be paired with Bayern Munich from pot A and Porto in pot D, with Chelsea from pot C in the middle. You’d have to be a tad unlucky though. Equally, you could end up with CSKA Moscow, Basle and Maribor. I can’t guarantee the absolute fairness of any individual draw; more its general principle.\n\nBy using Champions League pedigree UEFA create a closed group that will always be given the easier run, If the champions league was what it says on the tin, and if they want to keep a seeding system, then clearly the champions of the best leagues and the current holders should be top seeded. Everything else is history. Qwerty1, United Kingdom.\n\nI agree: Real Madrid’s 18 consecutive years are a nice statistic but winning the competition last season counts for more.\n\nScrap seeding completely, have a straight draw of 32 clubs, and you get who you get. It'll never happen, of course, because you might end up losing TV revenue if the big boys go out. Romantic, Colchester.\n\nAnd also because it’s a lousy idea. I’m a traditionalist by nature, but even I can see the value of not ending up with the champions of England, Spain, Germany and Italy in one pot, and the teams from Bulgaria, Slovenia, Belarus and Cyprus in the other. I’m not against seeding, just protectionism and entitlement.\n\nI remember Chelsea working up the ranks in 2004-2007 and meeting Barcelona and Liverpool in the group stages. We never heard talk of a tedious and bent travesty then. Berserker, Jeddah.\n\nProbably because the 32 team format was in its infancy and people hadn’t realised how repetitious and self-serving the seeding was going to become. Now it is so clear that even UEFA are saying it needs changing.\n\nA cynic would be forgiven for thinking, Martin, that this is only now an issue because City and Paris St Germain don't like the fact that it's the one privilege money can't buy. They don't like having to start from the bottom, having been used to buying their way into the elite. HarryTheManc, Manchester.\n\nThey bought their way into the elite because it was the only option available, Harry. The fate of clubs like Southampton and Lille have exposed the falsehood of organic growth.\n\nOh please give it a rest. The posters on here agree with the rankings because it benefits their club for a couple of years. They go on about making things fair but all I ever hear is what’s good for their lot. MCFC OK, Manchester.\n\nI agree. Not one Arsenal fan on here thinks his club should be anywhere but Pot 1, and no Chelsea or Manchester City fan either.\n\nAt least Arsenal have been consistently up with the best while, until last season, being one of the lowest net spenders in the league. Both Manchester clubs and Chelsea have bought any success they've had in the last few years. Despite the ridiculous amount of money City have spent, and continue to spend, they are still less successful than Arsenal in the Champions League. JimmyC, United Kingdom.\n\nJimmy, how can I put this? I really don’t give a monkeys about your net spend. I like football, not accounting. As for Arsenal’s Champions League success, like City, you have never won it, and like City, got knocked out in the round of 16 last year. Don’t tell me, it’s those 17 straight years again, isn’t it?\n\nAnd what better way to accompany a tedious and repetitive draw, than a tedious and repetitive article. Come back in 12 months’ time folks to re-read what you have read the three years previously. Is it time Samuel and his 'I don't get it' outrage were put out to pasture? No, because as long as he keeps writing crap like this people will click to respond. So you want to replace an elitist seeding system with another one? What about the winners of the Belgium or Swiss leagues? Do they not deserve to be seeded also? Goober, London.\n\nI apologise for my consistency, but while I’m the only one writing about this stuff – and then UEFA announce the seedings will be changed the next day, to something closer to my thinking – I might be able to get away with it for a while yet. And it’s not just the readers who respond to what I write, is it Goober? UEFA seem to have responded, too. As for your point about the champions of Belgium and Switzerland, they are both seeded in my fantasy draw. They get to be in Pot 2, ahead of Chelsea, Arsenal and Porto, but not up there with Real Madrid, Bayern Munich and Manchester City who won the strongest leagues. So I’ve got nothing against Belgium. In fact, have this: as heard on Radio Soulwax.\n\nHow fair is it Manchester City have spent unimaginable amounts building this team and they only have one English starter? They need to earn their way not have it handed over to them. Do we have right wing sports writers now? Jon, Purfleet.\n\nRight-wing sports writers, left-wing sports writers, apolitical sports writers, but mostly just sports writers, Jon. I don’t see letting a football club grow as it sees fit as a political issue.\n\nSurely it is only a matter of time before Paris St Germain, Manchester City or one of the other new rich clubs challenge this cartel. Financial fair play is a sham - limit spending to income then protect the income of the elite with a seeding system that sees a team like Arsenal in pot one of the Champions League, when they have not been champions for years. Betis Steve, Seville.\n\nI don’t think it’s illegal Steve, but joining the dots like that is why I have never felt it was right. I think FFP works only if implemented with fairer seeding and, in particular, wealth distribution. I don’t know how right-wing that makes me, so ask Jon of Purfleet.\n\nThe let’s all have a go at Arsenal brigade are out again. Listen, we don’t make the rules. We have no influence over UEFA whatsoever. Dial Square1886, London.\n\nI don’t think for one second Arsenal are plotting, but I do believe the wealthy, establishment clubs have more influence than you think.\n\nHow can Manchester City be England’s best team, and then all the bookmakers place Chelsea as favourites to win the Premier League? TheIvtcha, Serbia.\n\nBecause circumstances change very quickly in football; that’s why banging on about events from two decades ago is so silly.\n\nStop moaning. UEFA are doing it right and may it continue because FFP is already starting to have an effect and rightly so. LeftFootedRighback, Salford.\n\nYou mean your club once again has the most money to spend, yes?\n\nManchester City suddenly expect to be a top team in the Champions League alongside Real Madrid, Liverpool and Barcelona who have won it multiple times. City were battling relegation consistently and losing often in that time. Arsenal are top seeded because we have been consistent over many years and have earned it. Manchester City have not. Ozil, London.\n\nSorry, Ozil, I didn’t realise you had to win the thing to be a top seed. Well, let’s see how that works in pot one. Bayern Munich, no problem, Real Madrid, fair enough, Barcelona, step this way, Chelsea, in you go, Porto and Benfica, nice to see you again, Arsenal – oh dear.\n\nWhere were Manchester City five years ago when Arsenal were playing Manchester United in the semi-finals? Mbewa13, Kenya.\n\nWho cares? It’s history. Three Arsenal players who were involved in that tie – which Manchester United won 4-1 on aggregate by the way – are still at the club: Kieran Gibbs, Theo Walcott and Abou Diaby.\n\nHow can this be bent? Everyone saw the draw live and the balls were picked physically. Era Var, Åland Islands.\n\nI didn’t mean bent as in literally fixed, but in terms of the way advantage is skewed to a privileged few.\n\nOf course there is protectionism. Do you really think the top teams in Europe would play in UEFA's competitions if they were likely to be knocked out straightaway? They would break away and form their own competition. It's all about money. Zardoz, St. Ives.\n\nAnd you’re happy with that? Listen, if the top teams broke away and made it a closed shop the tournament would be dead in five years. Who remembers the group campaigns of Arsenal, Chelsea and Manchester United in recent seasons? What keeps the competition interesting from the start is the variety inherent in the odd newcomer: Manchester City and Tottenham Hotspur. The rest all runs into one until the knockout stage.\n\nAn insane piece. So if all league champions are thought to be equal why should they be treated differently? In other words, why should the league champions of the bigger countries enter directly into the main draw? Let the champions of Armenia and Belarus be placed as top seeds. While we are at it, why should England have a guaranteed three places in the main draw and not Iceland? Martin Samuel should think a bit before writing. Milsum, Sutton Coldfield.\n\nOr maybe you might think before posting? Where did I say that all champions are equal? I very obviously divided the champions according to country co-efficient, so there was no question of Armenia and Germany being treated as equals. The same with England and Iceland. If you really need to know why Stjarnan are not in the Champions League and Chelsea are, thought may not be your specialist subject.\n\nSo why should Real Madrid who came third in their league be seeded higher than Manchester City, who were champions. Oh, that’s right, it’s Madrid therefore they must get what they want. Mancityfan, Chester.\n\nNo, it’s because they are the reigning tournament champions. Pot One, seed one, by my reckoning.\n\nFootball is about history, and what you have achieved before. Manchester United are not in Europe this season, but when they come back next year they will be seeded and Manchester City will still be below them. Gumbos, Salford.\n\nGuess again, dear. You obviously missed that UEFA announcement last Friday. Manchester United will need to win the league to guarantee that.\n\nA major part of the problem is that the club co-coefficients are based upon the last five years of European competition. If that were reduced to two years, it would eliminate much of the problem. Clubs experience 80 to 90 per cent turnover in five years. Why should the 2010 season even be part of the calculation? Mark, United States.\n\nIs that player turnover, Mark? If so, that is an incredible statistic. I would be amazed if it was that high – but either way I agree with your point that five years for club co-efficients is perhaps too much. When measuring country co-efficients it makes more sense.\n\nIn your system the strength of the national leagues are not taken into account. Suppose Real Madrid did not win the Champions League last year and were third behind Atletico Madrid and Barca. That means they would be in pot three when the national champions of lesser countries would sit in pot one and two. How is that fair? Regarding City, let them improve their performance. Ujjwal Mukherjee, India.\n\nSo City have to improve their performance, but Real Madrid don’t and would deserve a high seeding despite being the second best team in their city, let alone in their country, last year? How about Real Madrid raise their game if they want a high seeding, too?\n\nSome people just don't like seeing Arsenal in the Champions League. If you are one of them, hopefully your much better club will go further than Arsenal or can knock them out of the top four. If not, keep sucking those lemons. Abir Joshi, Canada.\n\nNot me. I love seeing Arsenal in the Champions League. I have great admiration for the way Arsene Wenger has always hit the standard required to qualify. My only quibble is with UEFA’s seeding. No resentment about Arsenal’s consistency at all.\n\nThe reason Arsenal have the most co-efficient points is because they are top seeded every year and handed easy opponents on that basis. They comfortably beat these teams racking up more coefficient points in the process. How can it be right that this is allowed to go on, simply because Arsenal happened to be a successful club some years ago when the seeding system started? It's a protectionist farce. Johnny B, Exeter.\n\nThis is about to change, thankfully. I think even UEFA have realised there is not enough movement between the pots.\n\nWhile I agree they need to mix it up a bit, I don't know about the champions of Cyprus being ranked higher than Arsenal or Bayer Leverkusen. August September, United States.\n\nI’m not saying Leverkusen or Arsenal are literally second best to APOEL Nicosia. I do think, however, there is a feeling inside UEFA that the national champions across Europe have to be given greater opportunities in the draw. I’d still back Arsenal to beat Nicosia in a tie obviously, but to make the competition fairer we may have to reverse their positions in the draw. We should not presume inferiority or actively work to ensure it, as the present rigid seeding system does.\n\nYou might be right, but based on what's written I wouldn't know. What's your alternative? That would have taken actual effort and, clearly, based on this article, you're not interested in putting in effort. AtleticoProvenciano, San Diego.\n\nWhat's the alternative? Did you miss school the day they taught reading comprehension? It's right there in the story. It starts in paragraph ten after the picture of Raheem Sterling. It's a perfectly argued alternative and I'd suggest you go and read it again; rather than the author not taking any effort to think, I'd say you haven't taken the effort to read or make sense. If you want to talk about fairness then the champions of any league should get preferential seeding over those lower in the league during the previous domestic season. Anything else - such as using past glory as a guide - is unfair. I'm not a Man City fan, far from it, but they have been the best team in England and deserve a higher seeding than Arsenal, who have not been champions for a long time. Bob, Birmingham."
