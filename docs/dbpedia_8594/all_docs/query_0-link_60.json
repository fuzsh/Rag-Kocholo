        "text": "Rebuilding their reputation after some disappointing Premier League seasons in the past few years, Arsenal have proved once again they are genuine title contenders at the start of each campaign.\n\nThe Gunners led the league for the majority of 2022/23 but fell away in the final weeks and finished five points behind a surging Manchester City side which captured a historic treble.\n\nArsenal then spent big to add star players in the offseason in an attempt to make a new title push in 2023/24, which so worked as they took the race to the final day of the season again against Man City. But silverware remains elusive for the Gunners, with their most recent trophy being the FA Cup in 2020.\n\nThe Sporting News takes a look at the last time Arsenal won the Premier League title, alongside documenting how they have fared in every English top-flight season since their last triumph.\n\nMORE: The best Premier League title races ever\n\nWhen did Arsenal last win the Premier League?\n\nArsenal last won the Premier League title in 2003/04, gaining 90 points over the course of 38 games without losing a single match.\n\nOf course, this achievement is famously known as 'The Invincibles', with that team regarded by many as arguably the best in the history of the Premier League, under the leadership of the legendary Arsene Wenger.\n\nIn 2003/04, the Gunners recorded important victories in many tight encounters, including a 2-1 victory over Liverpool at Anfield, as well as a double over London rivals Chelsea, who were their nearest title competitors.\n\nMost famously, they were embroiled in one of the most iconic matches in Premier League history in a 0-0 draw away to Manchester United in September 2003. Labelled as the 'Battle of Old Trafford', both Manchester United and Arsenal were involved in an extremely bad-tempered affair with multiple instances of fracas throughout.\n\nGunners captain Patrick Vieira was dismissed with 13 minutes to go in the match, and then Man United's Ruud Van Nistelrooy missed a last-minute penalty for the hosts. That prompted Martin Keown to celebrate wildly in front of the Dutchman, as Wenger's side clung to a 0-0 draw before a melee ensued at the final whistle.\n\nSix Arsenal players and two United men were charged with ''improper conduct' by the FA in the aftermath of the game. This result was seen as symbolic of United's dominance starting to falter, while providing the fuel for Arsenal to go unbeaten whereas the Red Devils could only muster a third-place finish.\n\nWenger's men never looked back. The rest, as they say, is history.\n\nWhat has Arsenal's record been since their last Premier League title?\n\nDespite consistently finishing in the top four and securing Champions League qualification from the 2004/05 campaign until 2015/16 under Wenger, the Gunners have not regularly challenged for the title before the 2022/23 season.\n\nThey finished five points behind Manchester City and led the league for much of the way, only to fade in the final two months of the season as the defending champions caught up and surpassed them with the head-to-head matchup tilting the balance.\n\nThe Sporting News takes a look at their record since the famous Invincibles season and how close they have come to reaching the summit of the Premier League.\n\nArsenal's record since 2003/04\n\nSeasonPositionPoints gap\n\nfrom 1st place2004/052nd122005/064th242006/074th212007/083rd42008/094th182009/103rd112010/114th122011/123rd192012/134th162013/144th72014/153rd122015/162nd102016/175th182017/186th372018/195th282019/208th432020/218th252021/225th242022/232nd52023/242nd2\n\nPremier League 2023/24 TV channels, live streams\n\nRegionTVStreamingAustralia—Optus SportCanada—\n\nFubo Canada\n\nHong Kong—Now TVIndiaStar SportsDisney+, Hotstar,\n\nJioTVMalaysiaAstro SuperSportAstro GoNew ZealandSky SportSky Sport Now,\n\nSky GoSingaporeStarHubStarHub TV+UKSky Sports, TNT SportsNOW TV, Sky Go,\n\nAmazon PrimeUSAUSA Network,\n\nTelemundo, UniversoFubo, Peacock\n\nUK: Matches are carried across Sky Sports and TNT Sports streaming and TV platforms, with select matches on Amazon Prime.\n\nUSA: Select matches are televised on USA Network (English) and Telemundo or Universo (Spanish), and all three channels can be streamed on Fubo.
