        "text": "Chelsea have lost three pre-season friendlies in a row, to Ajax, Eintracht Frankfurt and Hamburg. A Chelsea XI also lost 5-1 at Wycombe, with the Blues' only victory so far coming at Selhurst Park in their 1-0 win over Crystal Palace. But should anything be read into these results? Well possibly, yes. Evidence suggests that teams who go on to win the Premier League title generally have favourable results in pre-season …\n\nChelsea 2009-10\n\nWon 4 Drew 1 Lost 1\n\nChelsea were unbeaten in all their friendly matches, including a 2-0 victory over the Seattle Sounders, a hat-trick of wins against Internazionale, Milan and América in the World Football Challenge in the US, and a 2-2 draw at Reading. They went on to beat Manchester United in the Community Shield 4-1 on penalties after drawing 2-2 in normal time. Nine months later, Chelsea sealed their title – and the Double – on the last day of the season with an 8-0 triumph over Wigan.\n\nManchester United 2008-09\n\nW7 D2 L0\n\nIn the buildup to their third consecutive title, Manchester United played in the Vodacom Challenge in South Africa, beating the Orlando Pirates and playing the Kaizer Chiefs twice, drawing the first match and winning the second 4-0. On their way back, the team stopped in Abuja, Nigeria to play Portsmouth, beating them 2-1 in a match that served as a rehearsal for the Community Shield, which Sir Alex Ferguson's side also won, this time on penalties. The pre-season also resulted in away wins over Aberdeen and Darren Ferguson's Peterborough, and home games against Espanyol and Juventus, which were won and drawn respectively.\n\nManchester United 2007-08\n\nW8 D1 L2\n\nUnited prepared to defend their title with a tour of east Asia, yielding a draw with the Urawa Red Diamonds, and victories over FC Seoul, Shenzhen FC and Guangzhou Pharmaceutical. Their only home game of the pre-season was a 3-2 defeat to Inter, although they managed away wins over Doncaster, Peterborough, Glentoran and Dunfermline. They lost 3-2 in Saudi Arabia to Al-Hilal before returning home to win the Community Shield on penalties after a 1-1 draw with Chelsea – whom they would beat by two points to win the Premier League.\n\nManchester United 2006-07\n\nW9 D0 L2\n\nA pre-season tournament in South Africa saw Manchester United claim victories over the Orlando Pirates and the Kaizer Chiefs, although they lost the final to the latter on penalties. United returned to the UK and recorded away wins over Celtic and Macclesfield, although they lost to Preston North End at Deepdale. In August United took part in the Amsterdam Tournament, where they beat Porto and Ajax – although the Porto match is perhaps better remembered for Paul Scholes and Wayne Rooney being sent off. The pair were suspended for the first three matches of the season as a result. United wrapped up their preparations with wins over Oxford, Sevilla and a Europe XI, and went on to win the league by six points.\n\nChelsea 2005-06\n\nW5 D1 L0\n\nChelsea put together an unbeaten run in the buildup to their second successive title, despite playing none of their matches at Stamford Bridge. Away wins over Wycombe Wanderers and Benfica were followed by a tour of the US, when they beat DC United in Washington, and play Milan – who had been beaten by Liverpool in the final of the Champions League the previous season – twice, winning in Boston and drawing in New York. The Blues' final match before the Premier League restart was the Community Shield, where a Didier Drogba brace helped them defeat Arsenal 2-1. José Mourinho's side went on to win the league almost as convincingly as the season before, finishing with eight more points than second-placed Manchester United.\n\nChelsea 2004-05\n\nW2 D1 L1\n\nMourinho's reign got off to an inauspicious start with his first game, a friendly away at Oxford, resulting in a 1-1 draw. Better results were to be found on a pre-season tour of the US, including a 4-2 win over Celtic and a 3-0 win over Roma, although the latter match was marred by the sending off of Mateja Kezman. The tour ended in Philadelphia with a 3-2 defeat to Milan. Although their pre-season was something of a mixed bag, their Premier League season was decidedly not: Chelsea finished 12 points ahead of nearest rivals Arsenal.\n\nArsenal 2003-04\n\nW3 D3 L2\n\nArsenal's pre-season results gave little clue as to the unbeaten season that lay ahead. Although victories over Rangers, Vienna and Besiktas – the latter two played on a tour of Austria – were solid enough, there were draws with Celtic, Barnet and Austrian part-timers SC Ritzing, as well as a defeat away to Division Two's Peterborough. Arsène Wenger's side were level at 1-1 after 90 minutes against Manchester United in the Community Shield but lost 4-3 on penalties, substitute Francis Jeffers having been sent off in the 72nd minute for kicking out at Phil Neville.\n\nManchester United 2002-03\n\nW7 D0 L1\n\nUnited won all but one of their pre-season matches in 2002, scoring 5-0 away victories over the Irish team Shelbourne, Division Two's Chesterfield and an XI put out by Aarhus of Denmark. They also beat Parma, Bournemouth, Valerenga and – in their only home fixture – Boca Juniors. United finished third in the Amsterdam Tournament having beaten Parma but succumbing 2-1 to hosts Ajax. They went on to win the league by five points from Arsenal.\n\nArsenal 2001-02\n\nW5 D0 L2\n\nArsenal's warm-up before their Double-winning season resulted in five victories, although few came against strong sides – Boreham Wood, Rushden & Diamonds and Barnet were on the list of beaten teams. Sterner tests might have been expected from Norwich and Real Mallorca but both were dispatched with a two-goal winning margin. However, Wenger's side were beaten by AS Roma and Turkey's Kocaelispor. In the Premier League five teams were in contention for the title at the halfway point, but Arsenal took the title with a seven-point margin.\n\nManchester United 2000-01\n\nW6 D0 L2\n\nUnited claimed a number of victories over big-name teams, including Real Madrid, Celtic and arch-rivals Manchester City – as well as wins over York City, Maltese side Birkirkara and an 8-1 drubbing of Shrewsbury Town. However, they were less impressive against Bayern Munich in the Olympiastadion for the final of the German side's centenary tournament, going down 3-1 with David Beckham missing a penalty. They lost the last Charity Shield to be held at the old Wembley Stadium 2-0 to Chelsea. No matter: they won the Premier League with 80 points, 10 more than nearest challengers Arsenal."
