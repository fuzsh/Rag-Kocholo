        "text": "Arsenal have been fighting in their second successive Premier League title race against Manchester City and it is going down to the wire.\n\nThe Gunners have been virtually unstoppable this season and have challenged reigning champions Man City the whole way.\n\nHowever, heading into the final day, they know their fate remains out of their hands with the north Londoners needing to beat Everton, live on talkSPORT, and City to drop points against Wolves.\n\nHowever, Mikel Arteta will still believe - with Arsenal last winning the Premier League before he even joined the club as a player!\n\nPiers Morgan told talkSPORT last year that he believes this team is the best since the Invincibles and they have got even better since.\n\nHe said: “I’ve never seen the Emirates as loud and universal in it’s support for a team and manager as it is now.\n\n“The media are loving the way Arsenal are playing. We got spoilt in the first eight years under Wenger in the way they played.\n\n“I think this is the best quality of football and best squad we’ve had since the Invincibles days.\"\n\nArteta's side will be hoping they can replicate the legendary Gunners side and go all the way to lift the Premier League title.\n\nArsenal are two points behind Man City with one match remaining but boast a superior goal difference that could benefit them.\n\nWhen was the last time Arsenal won the Premier League?\n\nArsenal last won the Premier League in the 2003/04 season.\n\nThis campaign is famously remembered as the club's 'Invincibles' year.\n\nDuring that season, Arsenal went unbeaten in their 38 league games, winning 26 of them and were rewarded with a Gold trophy - the only team to ever win one - instead of the usual silverware.\n\nThe Emirates outfit are now in their nineteenth season since they last lifted the title - their closest finish since then was when they finished third in 2007/08, four points behind winners Manchester United.\n\nHow many titles have Arsenal won?\n\nThe Gunners have lifted 13 English league titles, only behind Liverpool (19) and Manchester United (20) for most successful.\n\nHowever, only three of Arsenal's trophies have come in the Premier League era - with none being won since the move to the Emirates.\n\nArsenal have been a mainstay in England's top division for over a century and are one of only seven teams never to have been relegated from the Premier League."
