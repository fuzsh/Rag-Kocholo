Arsenal's Premier League title rivals Manchester City face 115 charges over alleged breaches of the Premier League's financial regulations.

City were charged in February 2023 due to historical accusations that they had violated the league's Financial Fair Play (FFP) rules from 2009 until 2018. With an independent commission scheduled to review the case, City vehemently refutes these allegations.

The club are being scrutinised for all the following offences, according to a press release by the Premier League: "In accordance with Premier League Rule W.82.1, the Premier League confirms that it has referred a number of alleged breaches of the Premier League Rules by Manchester City Football Club to a Commission under Premier League Rule W.3.4."

It comes as the club are involved in yet another tightly-contested Premier League title race with Arsenal, after City narrowly came out on top during the final stretch of last season. But questions remain over whether City may eventually be stripped of their titles should they be found guilty of any wrongdoing - something they vehemently deny.

Richard Masters, the Premier League CEO, disclosed on Friday that the hearing for the case would occur in the "near future." Below is a comprehensive rundown of the infractions City is accused of violating, as reported by the Manchester Evening News.
