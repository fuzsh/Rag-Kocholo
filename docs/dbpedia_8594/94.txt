Manchester City have been charged by the Premier League with breaching financial rules over 100 times from 2009-18 - leading to calls for the club's achievements in that time to be airbrushed from history.

English top flight chiefs allege that City, who won three Premier League titles during that period, broke a series of regulations in relation to revenue, details of manager and player remuneration, UEFA rules, profitability and sustainability and co-operation with Premier League investigations.

The club maintain their innocence and expressed their 'surprise' at the charges in a statement on Monday, with the matter now set to be referred to an independent commission.

However, many are already calling for City to be stripped of their various titles from that period in light of the charges - and if that extreme punishment ever came to fruition it would alter the history books significantly.

Sportsmail has taken a look at what would have happened in the Premier League if City were deducted 20 points for each of the nine seasons in question, with Steven Gerrard and Jose Mourinho amongst the biggest winners...

2009-10

1. Chelsea (C) - 86 PTS

2. Man United - 85 PTS

3. Arsenal - 75 PTS

4. Tottenham - 70 PTS

10. Man City - 47 PTS

The first of those seasons would not have impacted matters at the top of the Premier League too drastically, as City missed out on a place in the top four by the skin of their teeth anyway.

A penultimate 1-0 defeat at home to Tottenham saw Roberto Mancini's men beaten to Champions League qualification by the north London side, but had points been deducted they would have been without European football altogether.

City would have finished down in 10th had 20 points been taken that year, costing them a place in the following season's Europa League.

2010-11

1. Man United (C) - 80 PTS

2. Chelsea - 71 PTS

3. Arsenal - 68 PTS

4. Tottenham - 62 PTS

8. Man City - 51 PTS

After the heartbreak of the previous campaign City wrapped up Champions League qualification for the first time in their history this time around, finishing third in the Premier League behind second-place Chelsea on goal difference.

Should they have been docked points, the Manchester club would have missed out on European football again all the way down in eighth.

Their punishment would have been music to the ears of Tottenham, who move up to the holy grail of fourth-place and seal a second straight Champions League spot in this hypothetical league table.

2011-12

1. Man United (C) - 89 PTS

2. Arsenal - 70 PTS

3. Man City - 69 PTS (+64 GD)

4. Tottenham - 69 PTS (+25 GD)

By far the most important season of the lot, City ended their 44-year wait to become champions in quite literally the most dramatic way possible in 2011-12, with two stoppage-time goals on the final day against QPR snatching the title back from neighbours United just when all hope seemed lost.

Yet with the points deduction in play, that iconic late victory - and Sergio Aguero's famous strike at the death - would mean all but nothing.

In this scenario City would have only beaten Spurs to third place on goal difference, with Champions League qualification already safe regardless of the result against QPR, and the Premier League's greatest ever moment would be no more...

2012-13

1. Man United (C) - 89 PTS

2. Chelsea - 75 PTS

3. Arsenal - 73 PTS

4. Tottenham - 72 PTS

8. Man City - 58 PTS

Mancini and Co failed to retain their crown the following year, losing out to United by 11 points and finishing the campaign in second place.

A 20 point-penalty would have costed City European football, however, pushing them all the way down to eighth in the table.

Again, such an outcome would have sparked jubilant scenes over at Tottenham, who narrowly missed out on a place in the top four that season.

2013-14

1. Liverpool (C) - 84 PTS

2. Chelsea - 82 PTS

3. Arsenal - 79 PTS

4. Everton - 72 PTS

7. Man City - 66 PTS

The story of this season undoubtedly belongs to Steven Gerrard, whose infamous slip against Chelsea cost him the greatest chance he ever had of winning the Premier League with Liverpool.

City went on to pip them to the title by two points after Gerrard's nightmare that day, meaning the legendary Reds captain ended his career without a league winner's medal - yet that would not be the case if the Manchester club were penalised.

In the fantasy world of a points deduction, City fall to seventh in the table, Liverpool are crowned champions and Gerrard rides off into the sunset with the holy grail at last.

Oh, and Everton also sneak themselves into a Champions League spot. It could have been a season to remember all round on Merseyside.

2014-15

1. Chelsea (C) - 87 PTS

2. Arsenal - 75 PTS

3. Man United - 70 PTS

4. Tottenham - 64 PTS

8. Man City - 59 PTS

Another fairly non-eventful year where City were concerned, Jose Mourinho's Chelsea would still have run away with the title in 2014-15 regardless of a 20-point penalty.

As they so often are in this scenario, Tottenham would have been the main beneficiaries of City's demise by moving themselves up into fourth place once again, with Manuel Pellegrini's men dropping to eighth.

2015-16

1. Leicester (C) - 81 PTS

2. Arsenal - 71 PTS

3. Tottenham - 70 PTS

4. Man United - 66 PTS

13. Man City - 46 PTS

In a season which saw Leicester complete one of the most astonishing sporting upsets of all time, City were a shadow of their former selves under Pellegrini and scraped a place in the top four over United on goal difference.

A points deduction this year would have been the most damaging for the club, as they would have fallen into the bottom half of the table down in 13th.

Incredibly, the docking would have left 2013-14's champions just nine points above the relegation zone.

2016-17

1. Chelsea (C) - 93 PTS

2. Tottenham - 86 PTS

3. Liverpool - 76 PTS

4. Arsenal - 75 PTS

8. Man City - 58 PTS

The arrival of Pep Guardiola was supposed to revive City as title favourites, however that proved not to be the case as the former Barcelona boss adjusted to life in English football.

His side failed to make it into the top two, instead coming third after finishing 15 points behind dominant champions Chelsea, but with 20 points taken off Guardiola's debut campaign would have left them without European qualification.

Arsenal, who missed out on a place in the top four for the first time in 20 years that season, would have kept their Champions League run going in this scenario.

2017-18

1. Man United (C) - 81 PTS

2. Man City - 80 PTS

3. Tottenham - 77 PTS

4. Liverpool - 75 PTS

The final season in which City are alleged to have breached financial rules shows exactly how ruthless and relentless Guardiola's side were when imposing the points deduction.

Incredibly, even with 20 points less they still find themselves in second place, just one point behind revised-champions United, after becoming the first team in Premier League history to hit a ton.

Such an outcome would have seen Jose Mourinho bring the glory days back to Old Trafford, becoming the first manager since Sir Alex Ferguson to win the title for United. What could have been for the Special One...
