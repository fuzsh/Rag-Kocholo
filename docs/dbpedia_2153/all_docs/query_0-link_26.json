        "text": "An immigrant actress living in New York is separated from her son by her drunken lover, who sells the baby to a rich family, in this heartbreaking pre-Code melodrama, directed by Dorothy Arzner with both a firm hand and a light touch. The film embraces a balance between realism and artifice that humanises its characters with intelligence, humour and care. Ellipses are irreverent, actions are cruel and tender at the same time and every shot of Arzner’s mise en scène portrays its characters with a humanist understanding, an ambiguity that leads emotion, inevitably, to bloom. At one point, when Sarah knows she has lost her son, she is asked what she is going to do next. She answers, with the brave confidence of the desperate and the bitter-sweetness of a classical cinema that knows how to surpass its limitations: “I will wait.” Time makes Sarah (and Dorothy) win back their deserved place in this vile, beautiful and foolish world.\n\nCésar is the outlier of Marcel Pagnol’s Marseille trilogy. Taking place 20 years after the events of Marius (1931) and Fanny (1932), the film is the only one that wasn’t adapted from a stage play, and the only one that Pagnol directed himself. Among these beloved characters, nothing has apparently changed for some time. The already-briny band of dock-dwellers, led by the bar proprietor César, has somehow become even saltier, while the once-young lovers Marius and Fanny have resigned themselves to the consequences of earlier decisions. But the wind unexpectedly stirs. Pagnol opens up the confines of filmed theatre to the city outside; you can practically smell the sea air. There’s even a pair of tracking shots of portly César huffing up a steep hill, hat in hand, to fetch the priest for an ailing friend. The camera feels heavy, as though it might give way and roll back down. But like César, who never breaks his laboured stride, it is unusually determined. After all these years, the film insists, change is still possible\n\nAniki-Bóbó, Manoel de Oliveira’s first feature, was filmed in 1941, during World War II. It can be seen as a precursor to neorealism with its non-professional casting, its focus on the inhabitants of the poor neighbourhoods of Porto and its location shooting in the riverside areas of the city. It combines several filmic influences: the constructive power of rapid editing from Soviet directors, German expressionist shadows in the night sequences and French poetic realism in its best-known scenes.\n\nBut the importance of Aniki-Bóbó goes far beyond its formal innovation: since 1932 Portugal had been ruled by António Salazar, who did not tolerate subversive content. To evade the censorship imposed by the dictatorship, de Oliveira brilliantly transposed an adult story into the world of childhood, masking its irreverent content and turning the film into a unique object.\n\nIt’s a film starring Robert Mitchum, Richard Hart and Greer Garson, of all people. It had a big budget and a troubled production. And its costs kept doubling and tripling every time its directors quit. George Cukor was one of them, as were Mervyn LeRoy, Jack Conway and Victor Saville – all good directors. And all of them were foolish enough to take their names off this thing because it’s pretty wild. It’s beautifully written – talk about mad love, I think Buñuel would’ve been happy to inscribe his name in the credits. It’s probably a kissing cousin to the Buñuel title on my top ten list, Abismos de pasión (1954), his Wuthering Heights. Desire Me is engorged with mad love, but it strangely is an American picture so it has the laid-back intensity of Robert Mitchum at its centre. It doesn’t have a Mexican telenovela, high-burning flame. It’s got this cool guy, but he’s just as mad somehow and creates interesting tensions, plus the madness of not one but four directors removing their names from the film… I don’t know, it’s something that needs to be better known. It’s just great, really great.\n\nAlong with Mildred Pierce (1945) and Humoresque (1946), Possessed features one of Joan Crawford’s best performances. It is a story told in flashback of her character Louise’s decline into madness. The film begins with her being taken into a psychiatric hospital. These scenes were shot very early in the morning and America has never seemed bleaker or less romantic. For most of the opening sequence the camera is used subjectively, until the reveal that Louise is seriously mentally ill.\n\nThe best sequence, shortly after the halfway point, is when Louise goes to a concert with her stepdaughter. She leaves early but then imagines a confrontation with her stepdaughter wherein Louise accidentally kills her. The other great sequence is at the beginning when Crawford’s character is having an affair with Van Heflin’s David. This scene is played with light romanticism but has darker undertones. I really do think it is a marvellous performance by Crawford.\n\nYou’ve got one melodrama, make it count: the actress turned director Tanaka Kinuyo’s film, which competed at Cannes, places a woman at the forefront of post-war, ruined Tokyo (not just the place, the people). I love it, in the same way I love the Hollywood films of its time and ilk, and those of Britain – could you talk about 1945’s Brief Encounter in the same sentence? Perhaps, but Tanaka’s film is darker. It gives a terrific insight into Japan at the time and puts a woman at the centre of a lost society – with the shading that comes from a country that was a defeated power. The love letters of the title are written to the women’s lost foreign loves. Tanaka is undergoing a rediscovery, thanks in part to Mark Cousins’s excellent 2018 documentary Women Make Film, so there should be more opportunities to see this in the future – and to appreciate the director.\n\nIf Rossellini’s ‘trilogy of solitude’ (Stromboli, 1950; Europe ’51, 1952; Journey to Italy, 1954) was characterised by a very intense relationship between the characters and the surrounding environment, in Fear the Munich landscape is instead reduced to a mere narrative frame, in favour of the emergence of a landscape that has become internal. This manifests itself in the metaphor of a guinea pig’s heartbeat graph, during a scene shot in the pharmaceutical lab, in which Rossellini ‘draws’ a mountain skyline on the paper of the electrocardiograph.\n\nIn Fear it is no longer possible to hope for any kind of comfort or disturbance or miracle that could come from reality: Irene (Ingrid Bergman), Albert (Mathias Wieman), Erich and Johanna are all truly desperately alone. Fear is perhaps the darkest and most hopeless film from the master forerunner of modernity.\n\nWindfall in Athens is often given short shrift when it comes to both Hellenic cinema and the work of Michael Cacoyannis, whose subsequent films Stella (1955), A Girl in Black (1956) and Zorba the Greek (1964) all displayed a propensity for tragedy, which was at odds with the seemingly saccharine frivolity of his 1954 debut. Centred on a stolen lottery ticket and its quarrelling claimants, Ellie Lambeti and Dimitris Horn are riotously pitted against each other as the mismatched lottery players, yet their emphatic double-act transforms what is a straightforward enough yarn into a joyfully astringent romantic comedy. It’s also a rhapsodic eulogy to a rejuvenated Athens after the horrors of Axis occupation, famine and civil war. The 1950s saw Greece soar from the ashes, only to be swatted once again with the junta the following decade. In a historical context, as a film sandwiched between national calamities, Windfall in Athens could be seen as yearning for lightness. And yet, beneath its fragrant surface, there are fissures that reveal the darkness that Cacoyannis would later come to embrace, especially with his Euripidean trilogy.\n\nMayabazar broke many rules. Films made before it had a formulaic approach to portraying gods. But Mayabazar reinvented the wheel by making the deities relatable rather than aspirational; for example, the actors who played the deities spoke casually rather than in a bookish Sanskrit way. To the shock of traditionalists, the audience loved it.\n\nThe writers also introduced an array of new words, which ultimately became a part of the culture and everyone’s vocabulary. Although the characters are derived from the Mahabharata, the plot was an entirely fictional and social story and it was one of the first films to do this.\n\nThe film featured leading actors working with a larger-than-life scale and budget, which was a monumental breakthrough for Indian cinema at the time. Certain special effects and shots still leave modern audiences awestruck about how a film like this was made in those days.\n\nMayabazar’s screenplay, and how it approaches conflict among multiple characters, is simply phenomenal. The songs continue to sit on everyone’s playlists as well. Typically, it would have taken a lot of screen time to introduce the characters and establish the relationships among them, but the director, Mr K.V. Reddy, pulled it off seamlessly with just one celebration song.\n\nI made the children in my family watch it a while ago. They laughed, smiled and sat through the entire film without blinking an eye. The fact that today’s generation are entertained by a film made nearly 70 years ago proves it is a timeless classic. Mayabazar is truly the greatest film India has ever produced.\n\nThis film was commissioned by the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department to publicise the importance of traffic safety in the lead-up to the 1964 Olympics. In preparation for the Games, Japan constructed not only athletic facilities but an entire urban infrastructure, including massive motorways and the world’s first bullet train. Navigating a city newly criss-crossed with roads was perilous, not least for the taxi drivers upon whom Tsuchimoto focused. An act of exposure and empathy, On the Road: A Document maps the terrifying space-time compression of speeding traffic and automated signals that organised the city along axes of efficiency and control. Using oblique angles, high contrast shots and abrupt cutting, Tsuchimoto materialised the alienation and fracturing of everyday life in this age of acceleration. Interspersed with action sequences on the road are scenes of a young taxi driver returning home with low pay and high stress levels. While Tokyo announced construction and growth, Tsuchimoto chronicled car crashes and social misery. Predictably, the film angered police commissioners and was shelved.\n\nTsuchimoto worked with a drivers’ union while filming On the Road: A Document and shared the film as a tool for politicisation and empowerment. This act of allyship characterised his entire career.\n\nThere can be no recording of world cinema without paying attention to Brazil’s cinema novo movement. Yet no novo films – even one as renowned as Glauber Rocha’s Black God, White Devil (1964) – appear in the top 250 of the Sight and Sound Greatest Films of All Time poll. Of all the novo films, Macunaíma floats to the top for me, for everything it did to play around with form. The story of a Black miracle boy who drops in and out of Blackness and whiteness in his journey from the forests of Brazil to Rio de Janeiro, it is a comedy, a fantasy, a tragedy and a fantastic allegory about Brazilians but also people in general and their unquenchable greed. Grande Otelo, who plays the Black Macunaíma, is a legend, and this film is the perfect vehicle for his genius to play out.\n\nThis film is a cornerstone of Brazilian cinema marginal and, in the director’s own words, a “Maoist detective story”. I didn’t know either of these pieces of context when I watched it as part of an evening paying tribute to the director, who had recently died. It was a lucky, unplanned viewing of a film whose unpredictable rhythms seemed weirdly familiar and intuitive; at one point, I thought, “The only way this movie could improve is if the car to which this camera is strapped would start moving” – and it did! Nearly impossible – by design – to synopsise, it’s the prototypical old film that’s fresher than any new one, and served as an energising reminder for me of how much we all still have to discover.\n\nEssie Coffey’s film is often hailed as the first documentary directed by an Aboriginal woman – a distinction that says less about her than about Australia. But if My Survival as an Aboriginal had been made yesterday, it would still feel groundbreaking. Coffey begins by boldly reciting the history of her tribe, the Muruwari, and the colonial assaults it has suffered; then she passes on to kids in her community crucial knowledge of how to live off the bush; at the end, she declares, “I will not live a white-man way – and that’s straight from me, Essie Coffey.” In under an hour, she demonstrates every iteration of political cinema: as a corrective to the past, as an archive for the future and as a defiant planting of the flag in the present.\n\nThe film starts off with some perfunctory exterior shots (in that behind-the-Iron-Curtain black-and-white that we so adore), then we follow someone inside – and you are suddenly confronted by a family so real that their lives are happening not on the screen but in the theatre itself, 3D without the glasses. The bullying father, so real and familiar… All you sense is a desperate urge to escape this family and their funky apartment and the kitchen table you feel you were born on. Béla’s handheld cameras push closer and closer… you ​​feel like one more victim of the mad father and his director driving him further into your head and everyone else’s.\n\nI never wanted to get out of anywhere as badly as this house. Narrative, documentary, experiential – these words are meaningless to describe this movie that I will never forget. It’s the nuclear family as the ultimate weapon of mass destruction; the origination and obliteration of all life and drama.\n\nBy being absorbed by an unsought thirst for truth and guided by an irrepressible need to find his place in the world; by seeking to strike the right balance between reality and fiction in an attempt to piece together the fragments of memory that shape his disquietude; by acknowledging himself to be overwhelmed by the violence of history and choosing to mirror his hectic flow of thoughts; by letting himself be enchanted by the ineffability of existence and the imperceptible fragility of the ordinary,\n\nPerlov succeeds in wrenching himself from the eternally benighted epicentre of all the vanities of the artist and presents himself to us, his “hypocritish readers”, as a man – generous, inquisitive, compassionate and serene – in harmony with himself, the world and his own act of confession. This, to me, is the very condition and ‘roadmap’ of the filmmaker. And this is why I consider Diary the overlooked manifesto of the film d’auteur.\n\nBintang Kejora is a peddler of all kinds of ointments and remedies. In a modern cosmopolis like Jakarta, he might be regarded as a charlatan of sorts. Our story begins when he arrives in a small village that has not felt rainfall in years. Rusdi, a local widower with three children, has suffered greatly from the drought, which has diminished his family’s dreams and stood in the way of their future. So, with all his savings, Rusdi decides to commission Bintang Kejora to Make It Rain. Bintang Kejora accepts the challenge. But he has two conditions: he needs to see a cow walk backwards to the beat of a drum, and a beautiful flower blossom out of a patch of dry earth inside Rusdi’s family home. Clearly these are no small feats, and the family’s efforts take them through some major changes in their daily lives.\n\nBintang Kejora first screened in 1986, when President Suharto had been reigning uninterrupted in Indonesia for 18 years. Cinema was regulated by the Department of Information, and the government relied on this system to promote compliance and conformity, which they needed to stay in power. Even under these stringent conditions, filmmakers tried to make their voices heard, albeit subtly. I feel that films like Bintang Kejora existed for this countercultural purpose: to voice protest and dissent. Chaerul Umam used comedy as the perfect vehicle to depict a shackled society. This is one of the times I am thankful for the dull-bladed scissors (and minds?) of the state censorship board when it evaluates films with more ‘artistic’ cinematic nuances.\n\nBintang Kejora is never loud or even verbal about its opposition to the Suharto regime. But for an audience that was living in a similar drought of humanity under the dictatorship, Rusdi’s frustrated intentions to order rainfall and Bintang Kejora’s irrational promise that he can deliver it can be seen as a reflection of a desperate yearning for opposition and resistance.\n\nRain eventually did fall in the drought-stricken village. Not because the cow could walk backwards, nor because of the flower that could blossom without a single drop of water or a ray of sunshine, and most certainly not because of the shamanic prowess of Bintang Kejora. The sky truly began to pour when the people of the village arose and put real effort into their love, hope and dreams, instead of just waiting in despair for the raindrops to fall.\n\nIf you can get past the incest and violence in the first 45 minutes of this film, it is an achingly powerful story about love and it urges the audience to never give up on anyone. Ever. Healing, salvation, connection, belief and intimacy can all be attained even if you are damaged and have experienced trauma. Love can still blossom as long as you remain open to experiencing the world. And Bubby’s great triumph is just that – he remains open even after everything he has been through. This film taught me that you can take an audience to the very edge of what they can handle as long as you know precisely what it is you want to say.\n\nThe film appeared during the nationalist wars that took place in the 1990s in the former Yugoslavia. This is not a coincidence: Pintilie wanted to show how nationalism leads, in his own words, to “the massacre of the innocents”, and how in our region nationalist violence has deep roots. By telling a story about how the Romanian army killed Bulgarian civilians in the 1920s, Pintilie made the first film in which the interwar period is not seen as the golden age many people considered it to be after the fall of communism. The film has a beautiful classical mise en scène, it looks like a mix of a John Ford western and a Miklós Jancsó film and it offered Kristin Scott Thomas her best part ever.\n\nIn the early 1990s, Mikhail Gorbachev decided to end the Cold War, dissolve the Soviet Union and free the peoples of Eastern Europe from the yoke of communism and dictatorial rule, which would no longer be enforced from Moscow.\n\nSuddenly, people were free! A new hope arose that perhaps countries like Poland and Hungary and Czechoslovakia could be more like America and Britain and West Germany – and that capitalism was the path forward to even more freedom. The freedom to make profits. The freedom to buy stuff, to own lots of shiny things, to become not just citizens but – even better – consumers.\n\nYet, a decade or so after the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe, few working people there were getting rich, most homes did not have a two-car garage or a backyard in-ground swimming pool. The services that they used to enjoy in the former socialist economy – free health care, free child care and free education – were either disappearing or being ‘repurposed’ into for-profit endeavours. Where was the American Dream they were promised?\n\nIn 2003, two young Czech film students, Filip Remunda and Vít Klusák, decided to make a satirical documentary about the Czech people’s insatiable desire to have what the West has, to have the money the French make and to live like the Americans they see on TV. So what if we are free to vote – I want to be free to drive a Cadillac and go on an ocean cruise!\n\nThe filmmakers, pretending to be pro-capitalist businessmen, announce the upcoming grand opening of the Czech Republic’s first Walmart-style superstore – a ‘hyperstore’ that will have everything you have ever dreamed of owning. They hold press conferences. They saturate Prague with TV ads, billboards and a growing excitement. The government gives them a grant. ‘Construction’ starts in a guarded field just outside the city. On opening day, thousands of Czech citizens/consumers rush to the store, called Czech Dream, in a stampede. The filmmakers are there with their big surprise. They want to show their fellow Czechs what the arrival of free enterprise has done to their souls.\n\nCzech Dream is not only a stinging look at the transition from communism to capitalism – it is one of the funniest documentaries I’ve ever seen. Which may not sound like much, considering most documentary filmmakers are loath to use humour as a means of revealing the greater truths. Best to stick to sad reportage of orphans or celebrations of rock-climbing. The genius of young Klusák and Remunda in making this movie is that, with their debut film, they fired a brutal, comic broadside at the very thing most filmmakers are afraid to avenge – the system that funds us and distributes our art for profit.\n\nAnd, I suppose, in part because of this exact reason, few people have seen this brilliant movie. Which is too bad. We need more films that are dangerous; literally, in the case of Czech Dream. By the end of the film you are on the edge of your seat, fearing for the lives of these two filmmakers who have done a bad, bad thing: placing their hot poker of a camera lens into the eyes of the people they love and are trying to save from a future of credit card debt, income inequality and shopping, shopping, shopping just to score more points on the Czech Dream loyalty card, which promises you that, someday, if you buy enough things, you’ll be on that miserable ocean cruise.\n\nBefore I saw this film, I found the term ‘poetic’ to be abstract and elusive when used to refer to film; poetry takes many different forms, which are as nuanced as cinema itself. But Alabdalla and Al Beik certainly approach their process as a form of poetry, one which uses cinematic language as free verse. Spliced between recitations of the late Syrian poet Da’ad Haddad’s work and ruminations on their own journeys as filmmakers, Alabdalla and Al Beik interview three women exiled from their home country of Syria; women whose stories parallel their own. The result is an intimate scrapbook of memory, a film which evades any single analysis; it is reminiscent of Agnès Varda’s later, more autobiographical work. The film has rarely been screened since its initial release, despite winning the Doc/It Award at the Venice Film Festival in 2006.\n\nViva Riva! showed that it was possible to make an entertaining picture about an African country with style, verve and seriousness. Djo Munga created what didn’t exist and made it recognisable to the people who knew his country, while being true to his characters. He did the latter so well that the former was immaterial, showing nous that belied his first-timer status. His film massaged genre elements into a vivid portrait of Congo – and beneath the first-rate entertainment, there was a political subtext concerned with life in Kinshasa. This was to be the film to inspire young filmmakers to greatness. But the nature of the distribution network meant not a lot of Africans saw it back in 2010. And then the director disappeared from the industry. We hope he’ll be back.\n\nWaru is a collectively made, feminist, Māori feature which takes the omnibus film to another level. Far from being a disparate, fame- and ego-driven portmanteau project, Waru creates an entirely new model for fiction filmmaking grounded in a collectivist and communally minded cultural paradigm. Its eight directors worked with a tight brief: make a ten-minute segment with a woman as the protagonist, shot in a single take, set at the exact same hour and day, the day of the funeral of the eponymous young Māori boy, Waru. All eight pieces loosely relate to his death at the hands of a negligent caretaker. Waru is exemplary of what Kiwi filmmaker Barry Barclay has termed ‘Fourth Cinema’. It reflects the values and priorities of the Indigenous community about which it was made and, in turn, offers a powerful alternative to the hierarchical and patriarchal filmmaking structures that have been inherited from the industry.\n\nEsi lives with her parents in a village built on stilts in the middle of a lake. Her mother, Ama, is the main breadwinner and while she toils, Esi spends time with her father, Kojo, on his boat. As they float atop the shimmering lake, Kojo regales his young daughter with stories where the beginnings don’t make sense until the end and the endings are never what you expected.\n\nSimilar to the brilliant, melancholic Aftersun (2022), The Burial of Kojo is told through the lens of an adult woman trying to unravel the mystery of a beloved father lost in childhood.\n\nIn its dreamlike haze, everything is fluid. The camera glides along the water, through Esi’s memory and into the spirit world. Startling modern images are set against ancient landscapes and made timeless. The Burial of Kojo is beautiful, magical filmmaking. A bold cinematic poem that also satisfies the viewer narratively."
