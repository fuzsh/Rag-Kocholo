        "text": "In 2015, Sight and Sound highlighted 100 “overlooked” female-directed films in a feature called ‘The Female Gaze’. (The feature can be read on the BFI’s website.) Six years since the list's publication, some of the films featured have become easier to see, with the reputations of Barbara Loden’s Wanda (1970), Kathleen Collins’ Losing Ground (1982) and Claudia Weill’s Girlfriends (1978) growing exponentially in this time. However, many of the films have yet to find a larger audience.\n\nIn that edition of Sight and Sound, associate editor Kieron Corless writes about The Eternal Breasts (1955), a Japanese cancer drama with \"an unsparing frankness and directness.” Revisiting the issue in 2020, I became curious about the film and its director, Kinuyo Tanaka, an actor that worked closely with several icons of Japanese cinema: Kenji Mizoguchi, Yasujiro Ozu and Mikio Naruse to name a few. Acclaimed for her performances in Mizoguchi’s Ugetsu (1953) and The Life of Oharu (1952), she was the director’s muse and off-screen partner. With her 1953 debut Love Letter, she also became the only female filmmaker working in Japan. (Mizoguchi was furious about her directorial ambitions; they split and never collaborated again.)\n\nAlso known as Forever a Woman, Tanaka’s third film had been ripped from the headlines. Thirty-two-year-old Fumiko Nakajō had been battling breast cancer, having both breasts removed and undergoing radiation treatments away from her family. An active part of poetry groups in the post-war period, she wrote tanka compositions about her mastectomies and sent them to poetry magazine Tanka kenkyū, winning first prize in a contest. Following publication in several other magazines, her first collection Chibusa Soshitsu (trans. The Loss of Breasts) was published. Tanka kenkyū editor Nakai Hideo travelled from Tokyo to a Sapporo hospital to hand Nakajō her very own copy. She passed a few days later, on the 3rd of August 1954.\n\nNakajō became a posthumous success, with a second collection of her poems released the next year. A 1955 book, written by Akira Wakatsuki and called Chibusa Yo Eien Nare (trans. The Eternal Breasts), was inspired by her life and became the basis for Tanaka’s feature film. The script, written by Sumie Tanaka (no relation), plays hard and fast with many elements of the poet’s life: her surname is changed to Shimojō, three children are turned into two, while a series of Nakajō’s romantic affairs are mashed together. What Tanaka emphasises in her script are the poet’s battles with illness and the popular works it inspired.\n\nIn a way, Nakajō’s public martyrdom is something the film is trading on as a commercial product — the poet's then-fresh death (and how she tackled it in her work) is the motor behind the film being made in the first place. It’s a piece of content made off the back of someone whose grave is still warm. What’s astonishing about The Eternal Breasts is how it transcends this potential cash-in status, becoming as emotionally direct and involving as Nakajō’s poetry.\n\nWe first meet Fumiko Shimojō, unhappily married and living in Hokkaido. She’s played by Yumeji Tsukioka, whose meekness turns to bitterness as the film proceeds. By the end of the first act, Fumiko’s divorced and unable to attend tanka meetings as a single mother; meanwhile, she pines for a happily married childhood friend (Masayuki Mori). Things are tough, even before she feels a pain in her breast. The rest of the film is about Fumiko’s struggles with cancer, mirroring the poet she is based on: the mastectomies, the loneliness, the pain in her own tanka compositions.\n\nThe Eternal Breasts never feels like an exercise in emotional manipulation. Unlike other martyr-style depictions of the dying, Fumiko is never given a glowing redemption arc or the condescending sense that they are being called \"home\". Fumiko is unmoored from the life she thought she would have — from the man she truly wanted, the success as a poet, even her children as she recovers in the hospital. In the film’s most visually striking sequence, Fumiko walks her hospital's hallways, following a patient like a phantom at night. The path she walks visually mirrors an earlier scene where she faints, cueing the start of her fight with cancer. This time, however, she’s closer to the inevitable — that patient is being wheeled into the morgue. One more pathway; in/out.\n\nThe process of healing can be as harsh, as depicted in a sequence where Fumiko undergoes her mastectomy. Director Tanaka depicts her protagonist’s surgery like a horror film, with glimpses of open flesh, hand-pumped oxygen and otherworldly operating lights hanging overhead. But while Tanaka stylises these scenes with an expressionistic approach to light and shadow, it is never unfamiliar to the real world. A big part of this is in having Tsukioka play a complicated human being — while suffering, she is never entirely sympathetic. She disregards medical advice, pettily leaves her brother’s wedding halfway through and is filled with self-hatred. When a hunky journalist (Ryōji Hayama) arrives at Fumiko’s bedside to profile her, she lashes out. Surely the paper just wants a sob story about the dying writer, she accuses him. The public acclaim her poetry receives is rarely touched on; it brings little satisfaction in her abilities, post-mastectomy body or ability to survive cancer.\n\nWhile depicting the death of a well-known writer, it does not indulge idol worship. And although a tough watch, Eternal Breasts never feels remorseless or cruel. It is stirring to watch Tsukioka's face light up around her children, to take in the location photography, to swoon as Fumiko pines for the man she can't have. There is the poetry too, bittersweet and direct. It is odd to call something so devastating a beautiful watch, but Tanaka achieves that balance.\n\nThe print of Eternal Breasts on Youtube is in poor condition, burdened by a very quiet audio track. Even with the volume pushed to its limit, it was barely louder than a whisper. Weirdly, the online copy’s hushed audio forces you to lean in a little closer, to become more intimate with the lives Kinuyo Tanaka grants us permission into: Shimojō on-screen, Nakajō off it, in both of their journeys across life and into death. I’m happy that since last year, a 4K restoration has been touring festivals. Like others featured in that 2015 Sight and Sound list, I hope this film grows in reputation too.\n\nQUICK NOTICES\n\nIf anybody from New York reads this: howdy! Go see Lincoln Center’s Kinuyo Tanaka retrospective from March 18-27. Lemme know how The Eternal Breasts 4K restoration looks on a big screen.\n\nBy the time you’re reading this, I will have attended the Syrian Arts and Culture Festival screening of Mohammad Malas’ Dreams of a City (1984). (For the eagle-eyed among us, the film was written by Samir Zikra, whose Chronicles of the Coming Year (1985) was covered in my last newsletter.) During the introduction, the festival team informed us that Malas’ debut is undergoing restoration — for some of my quick thoughts on the film, follow me on Letterboxd!\n\nFinally, if you’re based in London, the restoration of Sara Gomez’s De cierta manera (1974) will be screening at the Barbican on March 31st. I wrote about this film way back in 2020, and it’ll be a delight to watch it in good quality — at least better than what we’re used to at Illicit Film Club.\n\nELSEWHERE ON YOUTUBE:\n\nKENZO FALL/WINTER 2022 SHOW BY NIGO\n\nIn my younger years as a hypebeast, I was in love with the Japanese streetwear empire A Bathing Ape aka Bape, founded by mononymous designer Nigo. The most expensive item of clothing that I’ve ever bought remains a grey full-zip 2008 panda face hoodie, thanks to the fact the label did not have a European e-shop. The import tax on this silly item makes my knees buckle every time I think about it. (I will never get rid of this hoodie. I still love it after all this time.) My relationship to Bape has changed over the years — too many pointless collaborations! less quality materials! — but I retained an interest in Nigo’s work, even after he sold his shares in the brand and left in 2013.\n\nThis past week, he debuted his first collection for French fashion house Kenzo, a distillation of everything he’s mastered over his career. I’m writing about it because I feel like the takes have been lacking in context for the designer’s career, with the collection presented as a streetwear evolution or, even worse, “cutely kawaii”. (That means “cute cute”.) There’s streetwear there, but it’s more reminiscent of the Americana menswear Nigo draws from for his label Human Made — military surplus silhouettes and thrifted vintage headwear. Baggy, jazz-era tailoring builds on the suit-making he workshopped at Mr Bathing Ape. Also, outside of his own history, there are floral prints adapted from the label’s late founder, Kenzo Takada — another Japanese expat, playful at work in the land of high couture. I like it a lot."
