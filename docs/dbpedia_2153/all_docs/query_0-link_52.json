He fought in the War of 1812, and for his services was granted 160 acres in Ark. He moved his entire family to Jefferson Co. in the late 1820's. He was married to Sally Haynes FLYNN and their children were: William, Elizabeth (Delia), Solomon, Lucinda, George W. Jr., Frances Haney, and Obediath (deceased 1926), his widow Polly Hughs FLYNN and their four children. My GGG Grandfather, George W. Jr., was married to Caroline HILL, and their children were: John William, Elizabeth, Robert L., A.J. (Andrew Jackson) and Joseph. My GG Grandfather was John William and he was married 4 times. The 1st time he had 1 child her name was Leeanna. The 3rd time he married Lovey MASON and had 2 children, their names were John and Elizabeth. Lovey and their son died between 1861-1869. He then marries Lovey's sister Sarah Mason CARNES. She had also lost her husband V.Y. Carnes and 2 children Sarah and Nancy the same time that John lost his family. John and Sarah's children were: Winfrey, Caroline, Isabella (Bell), Robert E. Lee, William R., Josephine, and Theodosia. My G Grandmother was Theodosia FLYNN, she married Ben JONES from St. Francis Co., around 1898-1899. Ben JONES was a River Boat Gambler on the Mississippi and I think that she was disowned by her family for marrying him. They moved to Memphis and had two children, Leo and Bertha Lee JONES. Ben was shot and killed while tending a bar around 1903. Theodosia ran a boarding house and became very ill. I think her family came and took her back to Loanoke Co. where she died on the operating table around 1907-1908. I would like to have any information on any of the names above. I would also like to find out who Theodosia ended up with, because she was very young when her mother and father died. Also the same information on my grandmother Bertha Lee JONES and her brother Leo, for, they were also very young when they lost their parents. I know my Grandmother married Clive D. TURNER, from Loanoke Co. sometime after World War 1. I also think that there was a private cemetery for the Flynns in Lonoke Co., it may be a public one now, would love to find out about this too. I feel like there are some Flynns in around that area of Jefferson, Lonoke, and Prarie Co. to this day.

Nor did I find him in Jefferson Co. in 1900 0r 1910 nor the 1913 Civil War census. So he must have died before then. Do any of you have access to the DAR cemetery records for Sherrill or have any of you run across any records for this BUMGARDNER family? His application in 1903 says there are three small girls in the household too small to do household jobs. Richard BUMGARDNER must have married again to a younger woman or these might have been grandchildren. Is Sherrill in Pastoria or Plum Bayou township? Of course he may have not lived in Sherrill, it may have just been the closest Post Office. Any help will be greatly appreciated.
