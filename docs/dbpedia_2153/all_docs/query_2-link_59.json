        "text": "It's delicious to see this kind of character taking up so much space on screen: unkempt, dazed, and aimless, with occasional moments of alertness to take pleasure in something tiny, just because she wants to.\n\nFull Review | Dec 28, 2020\n\nWith a marvelously subtle and quiet expressiveness, [Barbara Loden's] performance is captured through the painstaking lens of [director of photography] Nicholas Proferes.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 4.5/5 | Aug 14, 2020\n\nMiss Loden has promise, if not flair, as a director and she is an extraordinary actress... The fact is Miss Loden has given us less content and exposition than a short story.\n\nFull Review | Jan 11, 2020\n\nWanda is a fascinating screen character in all her contradictions, and Loden delivers a beautiful performance in the role.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 3.5/4 | Mar 30, 2019\n\nWanda refuses to embody any of the female images she comes across in the film...You see, just because she can't articulate her desires, doesn't mean she doesn't yearn for something more.\n\nFull Review | Mar 18, 2019\n\nWhen \"Wanda\" premiered, Pauline Kael (and many other US critics) called it a mundane piece of garbage. But they were wrong ... it's a feminist masterpiece.\n\nFull Review | Oct 24, 2018\n\nIt's not without it's rough edges, but it's well worth seeing, and wondering what might have been had Barbara Loden made more films.\n\nFull Review | Sep 13, 2018\n\n\"Realism\" doesn't entirely do justice to the world Wanda inhabits, which, for all the grit and grunge of its bars and diners and factory floors, is also a world of startling everyday beauty.\n\nFull Review | Aug 3, 2018\n\nJust by living an unheroic life as millions of others live it, and by conveying its condition, a maker of art can show what's wrong with a society or culture. This is what Loden does brilliantly...\n\nFull Review | Jul 16, 2018"
