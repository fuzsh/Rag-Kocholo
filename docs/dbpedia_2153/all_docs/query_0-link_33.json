        "text": "Australian actress (born 1982)\n\nYvonne Jaqueline Strzechowski[a] (born 30 July 1982),[1] known professionally as Yvonne Strahovski ( ), is an Australian actress. She is known for roles as Sarah Walker in the spy comedy drama series Chuck (2007–2012), Hannah McKay in the drama series Dexter (2012–2013) and Kate Morgan in the event series 24: Live Another Day (2014). Strahovski stars as Serena Joy Waterford in the drama series The Handmaid's Tale (2017–2022), for which she has received nominations for two Primetime Emmy Awards, three Screen Actors Guild Awards and a Golden Globe Award.\n\nHer other notable works include Lego: The Adventures of Clutch Powers (2010), The Guilt Trip (2012), Killer Elite (2011), I, Frankenstein (2014), The Astronaut Wives Club (2015), Manhattan Night (2016), All I See Is You (2016), He's Out There (2018), The Predator (2018) and The Tomorrow War (2021). She voiced Miranda Lawson in the Mass Effect video game series and Batwoman in the animated superhero film Batman: Bad Blood (2016).\n\nEarly life and education\n\n[edit]\n\nStrahovski was born Yvonne Jaqueline[2] Strzechowski on 30 July 1982[1] in Werrington Downs, a suburb of Sydney, Australia.[3] She is the only child of Bożena, a lab technician, and Peter[4] Strzechowski, an electronic engineer.[5] Her parents are Polish emigrants from Warsaw.[6]\n\nThe family relocated to Bass Hill when Strahovski was five years old and later to the coastal suburb of Maroubra. She began acting lessons at age 12. Straight after high school, Strahovski went to the University of Western Sydney's[7] Theatre Nepean, where she graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in performance in 2003. She then worked professionally in theatre in Australia for three years before landing a role in the American TV series Chuck.[3][8]\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nStrahovski started acting at school when she played Viola in the school production of Twelfth Night.[9] She appeared in film and television roles in Australia, including a turn on satirical show Double the Fist and as Freya Lewis in the Australian drama series headLand. She has also appeared in Channel Nine's Sea Patrol.\n\nStrahovski sent in her audition tape for the TV series Chuck while in the United States auditioning for roles in other shows, namely NBC's 2007 series Bionic Woman.[10] She was cast as Sarah Walker after running lines with Zachary Levi. She relocated to the United States six months later.[11] Strahovski adopted the more phonetic spelling of Strahovski as her stage name in place of Strzechowski at this time.[12]\n\nStrahovski is fluent in Polish and English, and employed it in a brief exchange with a colleague in the Chuck episode \"Chuck Versus the Wookiee\" and again in the episodes \"Chuck Versus the Three Words\" and \"Chuck Versus the Honeymooners\". Although she portrays an American in the series, she briefly spoke in a \"Hollywood\" Australian accent in the episode \"Chuck Versus the Ex\".\n\nStrahovski appears in Mass Effect Galaxy, Mass Effect 2, and Mass Effect 3 as the voice of Miranda Lawson. She had her face scanned and animated so she could portray Lawson in Mass Effect 2.\n\nStrahovski voices Aya Brea in the English version of the Parasite Eve spinoff, The 3rd Birthday. She appeared in a CollegeHumor sketch in April 2011, parodying the music styles of Katy Perry, Ke$ha, Lady Gaga, and Justin Bieber.[13]\n\nStrahovski appeared in the 2011 film Killer Elite, alongside Jason Statham, Clive Owen, and Robert De Niro.[14] She appeared in the 2012 comedy The Guilt Trip, opposite Seth Rogen and Barbra Streisand.[15]\n\nIn 2010, Strahovski received the Teen Choice Award for Choice Action TV Actress for Chuck, as well as a nomination for Spike Video Game Awards for Best Performance by a Human Female for Mass Effect 2. In 2011, Strahovski was nominated again for the Teen Choice Awards for Choice Action TV Actress. In 2011, Cosmopolitan Magazine (Australia) named Strahovski the Fun Fearless Female of the Year, along with Favorite TV Actress.\n\nIn November 2011, Strahovski was cast as the female lead in I, Frankenstein (2014).[16] In March 2012, she featured in a new SoBe Life commercial. In May 2012, Strahovski ranked No. 35 in Maxim Hot 100. In June 2012, Showtime announced Strahovski had joined the cast for the seventh season of Dexter portraying Hannah McKay, a woman involved with an investigation following the death of her former lover, a spree killer whom she accompanied when she was a teenager.[17] She reprised the role in the eighth season of Dexter.[18]\n\nIn December 2012, she made her Broadway debut in a revival of Clifford Odets' Golden Boy,[19][20] for which she won a Theatre World Award.[21] Strahovski was honored along with Liam Hemsworth for their work in international roles with the 2012 Australians in Film Breakthrough Award.[22]\n\nIn 2014, Strahovski joined Fox's TV series 24: Live Another Day cast as Kate Morgan, CIA agent.[23] Later that year, she was cast as Rene Carpenter on the ABC limited series The Astronaut Wives Club.[24] In 2016, she starred, along with Adrien Brody, as Caroline Crowley in the film noir Manhattan Night. She was featured in Maxim Hot 100 from 2009 to 2013.[25]\n\nSince 2017, she has starred as Serena Joy Waterford in the acclaimed Hulu drama series The Handmaid's Tale. For her performance, Strahovski earned a Primetime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series in 2018.[26] She also starred as Sofie Werner in the limited series Stateless (2020).[27]\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nAt the 69th Primetime Emmy Awards, Strahovski revealed that she had married Tim Loden, her partner of six years.[28] The couple have three sons, born in 2018,[29] 2021[30] and 2023.[31]\n\nFilmography\n\n[edit]\n\nFilm\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Title Role Notes 2007 Gone Sondra 2008 Sarah 2009 Persons of Interest Lara Short film 2009 The Canyon Lori Conway 2010 I Love You Too Alice 2010 Matching Jack Veronica 2010 Lego: The Adventures of Clutch Powers Peg Mooring Voice 2011 Killer Elite Anne Frazier 2012 Koala Kid Miranda Voice 2012 The Guilt Trip Jessica 2014 I, Frankenstein Dr. Terra Wade 2016 Batman: Bad Blood Kate Kane/Batwoman Voice[32] 2016 Manhattan Night Caroline Crowley 2016 All I See Is You Karen 2018 He's Out There Laura 2018 The Predator Emily McKenna 2019 Angel of Mine Claire [33] 2021 The Tomorrow War Colonel Muri Forester 2023 Scrambled Sara\n\nTelevision\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Title Role Notes 2004 Double the Fist Suzie Episode: \"Fear Factory\" 2005–06 headLand Freya Lewis 33 episodes 2006 BlackJack: Dead Memory Belinda Television movie 2007 Sea Patrol Martina Royce Episode: \"Cometh the Hour\" 2007–12 Chuck CIA Agent Sarah Walker Main role (91 episodes) 2012–13 Dexter Hannah McKay Recurring role (17 episodes) 2014 Louie Blake Episode: \"Model\" 2014 24: Live Another Day CIA Agent Kate Morgan Main role (12 episodes) 2015 The Astronaut Wives Club Rene Carpenter Main role (10 episodes) 2015 Edge Beth Pilot 2017–2022 The Handmaid's Tale Serena Joy Waterford Main role (56 episodes) 2018 Tangled: The Series Stalyan (voice) 2 episodes 2020 Stateless Sofie Werner 6 episodes[34] 2024 Teacup pre production and producing.[35]\n\nVideo games\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Title Voice role Notes 2009 Mass Effect Galaxy Miranda Lawson 2010 Mass Effect 2 Also likeness 2011 The 3rd Birthday Aya Brea English dub 2012–2013 Mass Effect 3 Miranda Lawson Also likeness\n\nWeb\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Title Role Notes 2011 Three Pop Stars, One Song Katy Perry, Lady Gaga, Ke$ha and Justin Bieber CollegeHumor YouTube video[36] 2015 Princess Rap Battle Daenerys Targaryen YouTube video series; 1 episode\n\nAwards and nominations\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Award Category Work Result Ref. 2010 Teen Choice Awards Teen Choice Award for Choice TV Actress – Action Chuck Won [37] 2011 TV Guide Awards TV Guide Award for Favorite Actress Won TV Guide Award for Favorite Couple Who Have (Shared with Zachary Levi) Won Teen Choice Awards Teen Choice Award for Choice TV Actress – Action Nominated 2012 Teen Choice Awards Teen Choice Award for Choice TV Actress – Action Nominated 2013 Saturn Award Saturn Award for Best Guest Starring Role on Television Dexter Won 2018 Screen Actors Guild Awards Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series The Handmaid's Tale Nominated [38] Primetime Emmy Awards Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series Nominated [39] 2019 Golden Globe Awards Best Supporting Actress – Series, Miniseries or Television Film Nominated [40] Critics' Choice Awards Best Supporting Actress in a Drama Series Nominated [41] Screen Actors Guild Awards Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series Nominated [42] 2020 Screen Actors Guild Awards Nominated [43] AACTA Awards Best Lead Actress in a Television Drama Stateless Won [44] 2021 Primetime Emmy Awards Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series The Handmaid's Tale Nominated [45]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther reading\n\n[edit]\n\nBodey, Michael (2 June 2007). \"Unknown Aussie lands TV lead in US\".
