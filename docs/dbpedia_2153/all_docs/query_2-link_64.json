        "text": "FROM THE DIRECTOR\n\nAs director of UCLA Film & Television Archive, it is my great pleasure to introduce the 2011 UCLA Festival of Preservation. We have worked to put together a program that reflects the broad and deep efforts of UCLA Film & Television Archive to preserve and restore our national moving image heritage.\n\nOur Festival opens with the restoration of Robert Altman’s Come Back to the Five and Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean (1982), funded through our good friends at The Film Foundation and The Hollywood Foreign Press Association. This is the first fruit of a new, larger project, funded by The Film Foundation, to preserve Mr. Altman’s artistic legacy. Another more recent film is Barbara Loden’s Wanda (1970), an unjustly neglected independent masterpiece, restored by senior preservationist, Ross Lipman, with funding from The Film Foundation in association with GUCCI.\n\nMoving backwards in time, we present several films noir, restored by preservationist Nancy Mysel, including the recently rediscovered gem Cry Danger (1951), starring Dick Powell, and Kiss Tomorrow Goodbye (1950), featuring James Cagney in his last gangster role.\n\nOur newsreel preservationists, Blaine Bartell and Jeff Bickel, present their restoration of the classic John Steinbeck documentary, The Forgotten Village (1941), while senior preservationist Jere Guldin has restored two silents directed by Rex Ingram, both previously considered lost:The Chalice Of Sorrrow (1916) and The Flower of Doom (1917). And our senior most preservationist Robert Gitt, will unveil two new programs of Vitaphone shorts, preserved in cooperation with Warner Brothers.\n\nThis year we have also expanded our preservation of classic television. In cooperation with the Righteous Persons Foundation we will present three episodes of Ralph Edwards’ This is Your Life, which discussed the Holocaust for the first time on American television. On a lighter note, we also highlight two television musical specials starring Gene Kelly.\n\nThe Archive’s internationally recognized preservationists will appear in person at many Festival screenings to introduce the films and discuss their work with audiences.\n\nBefore the Festival ends, UCLA Film & Television Archive will also go live with our new website. The new site will be interactive, offering information, blogs and streaming film clips. Be sure to visit: www.cinema.ucla.edu.\n\nAll of our preservation work and public programs—including this Festival—are funded by donations from individuals, foundations, corporations, and government agencies. We are most thankful for the generosity of these organizations and individuals.\n\nDr. Jan-Christopher Horak\n\nDirector\n\nUCLA Film & Television Archive\n\nFESTIVAL SPONSOR\n\nAdditional programming support provided, in part, by The Hollywood Foreign Press Association\n\nPreservation funded by The Hollywood Foreign Press Association and The Film Foundation\n\nCOME BACK TO THE FIVE AND DIME, JIMMY DEAN, JIMMY DEAN (1982)\n\nDirected by Robert Altman\n\nRobert Altman’s screen adaptation of the Ed Graczyk play (which Altman also directed on Broadway) relates the twenty-year reunion of a James Dean fan club at a Woolworth's in a small Texas town. Older and wiser, club members, all of them women, recount their aspirations and failures, illuminating feminist themes of sexuality and power. While boasting a stellar ensemble cast, the film proved a breakthrough for Cher, in particular.\n\nScreenplay: Ed Graczyk. Cast: Sandy Dennis, Cher, Karen Black, Kathy Bates. 35mm, Color, 108 min.\n\nPreservation funded by The Packard Humanities Institute\n\nTHE GOOSE WOMAN (1925)\n\nDirected by Clarence Brown\n\nThe Goose Woman depicts the tale of a former prima donna descended into alcoholism and bitter recrimination. When a murder occurs next door, she concocts an eyewitness account of the crime to get her name back in the press. Director Clarence Brown employs his signature symbolism throughout, displaying a deft hand at guiding the moments of comedy that relieve the dramatic tension.\n\nScreenplay: Melville Brown. Cast: Louise Dresser, Jack Pickford, Constance Bennett. 35mm, Tinted, silent, approx. 83 min.\n\nPreservation funded by The Packard Humanities Institute\n\nEVE'S LEAVES (1926)\n\nDirected by Paul Sloane\n\nWhen a well-meaning sea captain forces his daughter, Eve, to masquerade as a boy to protect her from the evils of the world, she responds by provoking widespread mischief aboard his tramp freighter. While the plot is loosely framed by melodrama (particularly after Chinese marauders seize the ship), this is really a comedy with Leatrice Joy delivering an ebullient performance as Eve.\n\nScreenplay: Elmer Harris, Jack Jevne. Cast: Leatrice Joy, William Boyd, Robert Edeson. 35mm, silent, B/W, approx. 75 min.\n\nPreservation funded by The National Endowment for the Arts and The Packard Humanities Institute\n\nBIG RED RIDING HOOD (1925)\n\nDirected by Leo McCarey\n\nScreenplay: Hal Roach. Cast: Charley Chase, Martha Sleeper, Helen Gilmore. 35mm, B/W, approx. 10 min.\n\nPreservation funded by The Packard Humanities Institute\n\nTHE GIRL WHO DARED (1944)\n\nDirected by Howard Bretherton\n\nAn invitation to a party at a remote old house, a succession of murders, the telephone line cut—The Girl Who Dared has all the makings of a classic whodunit. Briskly adapted from Medora Field’s 1942 novel Blood on Her Shoe by John K. Butler (himself a prolific author of pulp-fiction), this Republic Pictures mystery clocks in at under an hour but packs a thrill-filled punch.\n\nScreenplay: John K. Butler. Cast: Lorna Gray, Peter Cookson, Grant Withers. 35mm, B/W, 56 min.\n\nPreservation funded by The Packard Humanities Institute\n\nRENDEZVOUS WITH ANNIE (1946)\n\nDirected by Allan Dwan\n\nCorporal Jeffrey Dolan, stationed in London, misses his stateside wife so bad that two buddies fly him, AWOL, back home for a secret anniversary visit. After the war, Jeffrey returns home legitimately to discover he’s a father, only he and his wife can’t tell anyone the truth about how it happened. Complications ensue and are then compounded in this post-war comedy of errors.\n\nScreenplay: Mary Loos, Richard Sale. Cast: Eddie Albert, Faye Marlowe, C. Aubrey Smith. 35mm, B/W, 80 min.\n\nPreservation funded by The Packard Humanities Institute\n\nREISSUE TRAILER FOR RAINBOW OVER TEXAS\n\n35mm, B/W, approx. 1 min.\n\n\"I've been writing about the incomparable UCLA Festival of Preservation for nearly 20 years, and every time a new edition appears, I fear I'll run out of fresh adjectives to describe the UCLA Film & Television Archive's gift for restoring the widest possible spectrum of fascinating and hard-to-see cinema.\"\n\n—Kenneth Turan, Los Angeles Times\n\nPreservation funded by The Packard Humanities Institute\n\nSLEEP MY LOVE (1948)\n\nDirected by Douglas Sirk\n\nBefore achieving real critical and box office success, director Douglas Sirk turned in this surprisingly effective terrorized-wife drama. Produced by Mary Pickford, the plot centers around a socialite, played by the earnest and lovely Claudette Colbert, being driven mad by her faithless husband, Don Ameche playing against type. Joseph Valentine’s cinematography contributes mightily to the film’s noirish atmosphere.\n\nScreenplay: St. Clair McKelway, Leo Rosten. Cast:Claudette Colbert, Robert Cummings, Don Ameche. 35mm, B/W, 96 min.\n\nPreservation funded by Paramount Pictures Corporation\n\nSTRANGERS IN THE NIGHT (1944)\n\nDirected by Anthony Mann\n\nThe inky noir style and fatalist themes that would later emerge full force in T-Men (1948) and Border Incident (1949) take shape in Anthony Mann’s sixth feature, an early gothic thriller about a veteran lured into a deadly psychological nightmare by the promise of love. Strangers in the Nightdisplays Mann’s deft facility for squeezing the most from a tight budget.\n\nScreenplay: Bryant Ford, Paul Gangelin. Cast:William Terry, Virginia Grey, Helene Thimig. 35mm, B/W, 56 min.\n\nHIGHLIGHTING THE OUTFEST LEGACY PROJECT: THREE FILMS\n\nPreservation funded by Joanne Herman with additional support from the Andrew J. Kuehn, Jr. Foundation, Friends of the Film, and the members of Outfest\n\nQUEENS AT HEART (1967)\n\nDirected by Unknown\n\nAn extraordinary bit of ephemera, this proto-scientific documentary, verging on exploitation, presents four male-to-female transsexuals in candid discussions about their private lives and identities. The four subjects gamely respond to probing questions providing an intriguing portrait of Americans on the fringes of gender identity just before the Stonewall Rebellion two years later.\n\n35mm, Color, 22 min.\n\nPreservation funded by the Women’s Film Preservation Fund, the members of Outfest and the Ronald T. Shedlo Preservation Fund\n\nMONA’S CANDLE LIGHT (1950)\n\nDirected by Unknown\n\nThis all-too-brief film, discovered at a flea market, depicts patrons of a lesbian bar (probably in San Francisco circa 1950) and performances by drag king Jimmy Reynard and singer Jan Jensen, singing American standards, including “I’ll Remember April” and “Tenderly.” A deceptively simple document, it presents exceedingly rare images of queer life on its own turf, and on its own terms, before gay liberation.\n\n35mm, Color, 8 min.\n\nPreservation funded by the Andrew J. Kuehn, Jr. Foundation, with support from the Women’s Film Preservation Fund and the members of Outfest\n\nCHOOSING CHILDREN (1984)\n\nDirected by Debra Chasnoff and Kim Klausner\n\nDebra Chasnoff and Kim Klausner’s groundbreaking documentary presents with grace and towering authority, portraits of several lesbian mothers who were among the first to make the historic choice to become parents. Free from didacticism, the film exerts a powerful emotional undertow as it frames the lives of these families as arenas of love, commitment and work.\n\n35mm, Color, 45 min.\n\nPreservation funded by The Packard Humanities Institute\n\nTHE CHALICE OF SORROW (1916)\n\nDirected by Rex Ingram\n\nDirector Rex Ingram shifted the locale of this loose adaptation of La Tosca to Mexico City where opera star Lorelei is pursued by two men: a powerful Mexican provincial governor and an American artist who is her secret fiancé. Infatuated with Lorelei, the governor falsely imprisons his rival and forces Lorelei to choose: acquiesce to his licentious desires, or see her lover executed.\n\nScreenplay: Rex Ingram. Cast: Cleo Madison, Blanche White, Charles Cummings. 35mm, Tinted, silent, B/W, approx. 70 min.\n\nPreservation funded by The Packard Humanities Institute\n\nTHE FLOWER OF DOOM (1917)\n\nDirected by Rex Ingram\n\nRecently rediscovered, The Flower of Doom reveals director Rex Ingram taking a perceptible cinematic step toward the iconic pictorial style upon which his reputation rests. The story—a gritty drama set in the shadowy world of Chinatown gangs—allowed Ingram to indulge his interest in the exotic as newspaperman Harvey Pearson enters a sinister web of corruption after his girlfriend is kidnapped.\n\nScreenplay: Rex Ingram. Cast: Wedgwood Nowell, Yvette Mitchell, Nicholas Dunaew. 35mm, Tinted, silent, B/W, approx. 70 min.\n\nTRAILER FOR SHORE ACRES (1920)\n\n35mm, silent, B/W, approx. 1 min.\n\nPreservation funded by The Packard Humanities Institute and The American Film Institute/National Endowment for the Arts Film Preservation Grants Program\n\nTRAILER FOR GARDEN OF ALLAH (1927)\n\n35mm, Tinted, silent, B/W, approx. 1 min.\n\nPreservation funded by The Packard Humanities Institute and The American Film Institute/National Endowment for the Arts Film Preservation Grants Program\n\nTRAILER FOR THREE PASSIONS (1928)\n\n35mm, Tinted, silent, B/W, approx. 1 min.\n\nPreservation funded by The Packard Humanities Institute\n\nSATAN MET A LADY (1936)\n\nDirected by William Dieterle\n\nWarner Bros.’ second adaptation of Dashiell Hammett’s The Maltese Falcon in just five years features a number of story changes, including the substitution of a jewel-filled ram’s horn for the Maltese Falcon itself. Maligned as further evidence of the studio’s indifference to Bette Davis’ talent,Satan Met A Lady has its charms as a comedy-tinged mystery in the vein of The Thin Man.\n\nScreenplay: Brown Holmes. Cast: Bette Davis, Warren William, Alison Skipworth. 35mm, B/W, 74 min.\n\nPreservation funded by The Packard Humanities Institute\n\nTHE BIG SHAKEDOWN (1934)\n\nDirected by John Francis Dillon\n\nBette Davis plays Norma Nelson, the ever-supportive fiance of a pharmacist who falls in with gangsters in this Warner Bros. programmer released months before her breakthrough performance in Of Human Bondage. Later mayor of Palm Springs, Charles Farrell plays the druggist and Ricardo Cortez, segueing from silent romantic lead to sound-era heavy, plays the ex-bootlegger who forces him to make counterfeit drugs.\n\nScreenplay: Niven Busch, Rian James. Cast: Charles Farrell, Bette Davis, Ricardo Cortez. 35mm, B/W, 64 min.\n\nTRIBUTE TO TOM CHOMONT\n\nPreservation funded through the Avant-Garde Masters program funded by The Film Foundation and administered by the National Film Preservation Foundation\n\nTom Chomont's exquisite short experimental works, a treasure among the holdings of the Outfest Legacy Collection at UCLA, exist at the intersection of eroticism, mysticism, and the everyday. Infusing his work is a palpably human longing for love, in which the boundaries that limit us are in fact gateways, be they door, window, skin, or spirit. This program of short works includes the sensuously provocative Love Objects (1971), as well as his lyrical portraits.\n\nAll films directed by Tom Chomont except where noted.\n\nOPHELIA/THE CAT LADY (1969)\n\n16mm, Color, silent, 3 min.\n\nLOVE OBJECTS (1971, Netherlands)\n\n16mm, Color, silent, 11 min.\n\nTHE MIRROR GARDEN (1967)\n\n16mm, Color, silent, 4 min.\n\nEPILOGUE/SIAM (1969)\n\n16mm, Color, silent, 6 min.\n\nJABBOK (1967)\n\n16mm, silent, b/w and color tint/tone emulations, 4 min.\n\nPHASES OF THE MOON (1968)\n\n16mm, Color, silent, 4 min.\n\nOBLIVION (1969)\n\n16mm, Color, silent, 5 min.\n\nAQUARIUM (1994)\n\nDigiBeta, Color, silent, 3 min.\n\nSADISTIC SELF PORTRAIT (1994)\n\n16mm, Color, silent, 5 min.\n\n[SELF] [PORTRAIT] (2000) Directed by Mike Hoolboom and Tom Chomont\n\nDigiBeta, Color, silent, 4 min.\n\nSTORM WARNING (2008)\n\nDVD, Color, silent, 2 min.\n\nFLUCTUATIONS (2005) Directed by Samay Jain\n\nDVD, Color, silent, 7 min.\n\nPreservation funded by The Packard Humanities Institute\n\nRAINBOW OVER TEXAS (1947)\n\nDirected by Frank McDonald\n\nLike Gene Autry, Roy Rogers worked for Republic, cranking out westerns for the Saturday matinee crowd. Rainbow Over Texas was Rogers’ sixtieth film since 1935 but Rainbow wasn’t just routine. Dale Evans, for example, does a little cross dressing, appearing first as a boy to travel West before, Roy, returning to his hometown, meets her and falls in love.\n\nScreenplay: Max Brand, Gerald Geraghty. Cast: Roy Rogers, Gabby Hayes, Dale Evans. 35mm, B/W, 65 min.\n\nPreservation funded by The Packard Humanities Institute\n\nHEART OF THE RIO GRANDE (1942)\n\nDirected by William Morgan\n\nGene Autry’s fifty-first film in less than eight years is nevertheless something different. A contemporary Western set in 1942, it’s also more of a lyrical, musical Western than Autry’s usual action fare. While running a dude ranch, he must contend with a millionaire’s spoiled daughter and a disgruntled ex-foreman but still finds time to croon “Deep in the Heart of Texas,” “Rumble Seat for Two” and more.\n\nScreenplay: Lillie Hayward, Winston Miller. Cast:Gene Autry, Smiley Burnette, Fay McKenzie. 35mm, B/W, 68 min.\n\nPreservation funded by The Packard Humanities Institute\n\nHYMN TO THE SUN (1935)\n\nDirected by Robert C. Bruce\n\n35mm, Color, approx. 8 min.\n\nON THE VITAPHONE, PROGRAM ONE 1927-1930\n\nVitaphone technology, an early method of syncing sound discs to film, left critics astounded that vocal and musical reproductions could sound so “natural,” so “real.” Developed by Warner Bros., Bell Laboratories and Western Electric, the Vitaphone system had distinct advantages over other sync sound methods and Vitaphone films were tremendously popular, particularly the shorts produced by Warner Bros. featuring top stage and musical talent of the day. From 1926-1931, Warner Bros. produced over 1000 Vitaphone shorts. Since its inception, UCLA Film & Television Archive has been committed to preserving as many of these as possible. This Festival, the Archive presents two nights of newly preserved Vitaphone shorts featuring Robert Gitt, preservation officer, in person.\n\nThe Vitaphone shorts in this program have been restored by Warner Bros., in collaboration with UCLA Film & Television Archive, the Library of Congress Packard Campus for Audio Visual Conservation, and The Vitaphone Project, with funding provided by Warner Bros. and Dudley Heer. Additional financial support provided by Emily Thompson and Scott Margolin.\n\nTHE RANGERS IN “AFTER THE ROUND-UP” (VITAPHONE #2900) (1928)\n\n35mm, B/W, 8 min.\n\nMITCHELL LEWIS IN “THE DEATH SHIP” (VITAPHONE #2234) (1927)\n\n35mm, B/W, 9 min.\n\nGLADYS BROCKWELL IN “HOLLYWOOD BOUND” (VITAPHONE #2235) (1928)\n\n35mm, B/W, 9 min.\n\nVAL HARRIS WITH ANN HOWE, IN “THE WILD WESTERNER” (VITAPHONE #2759) (1928)\n\n35mm, B/W, 8 min.\n\nJACK WALDRON IN “A BREATH OF BROADWAY” (VITAPHONE #2691) (1928)\n\n35mm, B/W, 8 min.\n\nFLORENCE BRADY IN “A CYCLE OF SONGS” (VITAPHONE #2699) (1928)\n\n35mm, B/W, 9 min.\n\nVAL & ERNIE STANTON IN “CUT YOURSELF A PIECE OF CAKE” (VITAPHONE #2586) (1928)\n\n35mm, B/W, 8 min.\n\nEDDIE WHITE IN “I THANK YOU” (VITAPHONE #2689) (1928)\n\n35mm, B/W, 9 min.\n\nROBERT EMMETT KEANE IN “GOSSIP” (VITAPHONE #2849-2850) (1928)\n\n35mm, B/W, 21 min.\n\nJOE FRISCO IN “THE SONG PLUGGER” (VITAPHONE #1019-1020) (1930)\n\n35mm, B/W, 15 min.\n\nPLAY OF THE WEEK: “WAITING FOR GODOT” (WNTA-TV, 4/3/1961)\n\nDirected by Alan Schneider\n\nPremiering in 1959, the ambitious television experiment Play of the Week presented an eclectic mix of plays that \"no one else would touch,” including Samuel Beckett's absurdist masterpiece, Waiting for Godot (1961), starring blacklisted stage and screen actor Zero Mostel. In reference to the direction of Godot by Beckett collaborator and confident Alan Schneider, Mostel reportedly quipped that he \"wished to be re-blacklisted.\"\n\nScreenplay: Samuel Beckett. Cast: Burgess Meredith, Zero Mostel, Kurt Kasznar. DigiBeta, B/W, 102 min.\n\nPreserved through the Avant-Garde Masters program funded by The Film Foundation and administered by the National Film Preservation Foundation\n\nSAMUEL BECKETT'S FILM (1965)\n\nDirected by Samuel Beckett\n\nSamuel Beckett’s lone work for projected cinema is in essence a chase film—one that locates the existential crisis of modernity in the very fabric of the movies themselves. The link to cinema’s essence is evident in the casting of an aged Buster Keaton and the exquisite cinematography of Boris Kaufman. Film is a now-legendary cinematic conundrum that asks as many questions as it answers.\n\nScreenplay: Samuel Beckett. Cast: Buster Keaton, Nell Harrison, James Karen. 35mm, B/W, 20 min.\n\nTHIS IS YOUR LIFE: THREE EPISODES\n\nPreservation funded by Righteous Persons Foundation and the Ronald T. Shedlo Preservation Fund\n\nOne of American television’s most popular programs,This is Your Life presented tributes to hundreds of notable people on NBC from 1952 until 1961, hosted by the effervescent Ralph Edwards. Among the many famous personalities that the show honored were also many ordinary people who had overcome tremendous obstacles. Among these “regular” people were three exceptional women—Hanna Bloch Kohner, Ilse Stanley and Sara Veffer—all survivors of the Holocaust. Their harrowing yet inspiring stories are vividly related in these threeThis is Your Life episodes which marked some the earliest accounts from Holocaust survivors themselves to appear on national television.\n\nTHIS IS YOUR LIFE: “ILSE STANLEY” (NBC, 11/2/1955)\n\nDirected by Axel Gruenberg\n\nProducer: Axel Gruenberg. Screenwriter: Axel Gruenberg. Cast: Ralph Edwards. 35mm, B/W, 30 min.\n\nTHIS IS YOUR LIFE: “SARA VEFFER” (NBC, 3/19/1961)\n\nDirected by Richard Gottlieb\n\nProducer: Axel Gruenberg. Screenwriter: Axel Gruenberg. Cast: Ralph Edwards. 35mm, B/W, 30 min.\n\nTHIS IS YOUR LIFE: “HANNA BLOCH KOHNER” (NBC, 5/27/1953)\n\nDirected by Axel Gruenberg\n\nProducer: Al Paschall, Axel Gruenberg. Screenwriter: Axel Gruenberg. Cast: Ralph Edwards. 35mm, B/W, 30 min.\n\nPreservation funded by The Packard Humanities Institute\n\nTHE FORGOTTEN VILLAGE (1941)\n\nDirected by Herbert Kline and Alexander Hammid\n\nThe Forgotten Village was John Steinbeck’s first work written for the screen and his only screen documentary (actually more of a docudrama told in the form of a parable). Directed by Herbert Kline and narrated by Burgess Meredith, it centers on one symbolic indigenous family in a remote pueblo in Mexico as its eldest son attempts to bridge two very different worlds, one traditional and one modern.\n\nScreenplay: John Steinbeck. Narrator: Burgess Meredith. 35mm, B/W, 67 min.\n\nMEXICO IN THE HEARST METROTONE NEWS COLLECTION (1930’S AND 1940’S)\n\nPreservation funded by The Packard Humanities Institute.\n\nMexico, still alive with social activism at the beginning of the 1940‘s, provided John Steinbeck with a rich source of creative inspiration. In order to give some background on the social and political situation in Mexico during this era, tonight’s program will include highlights from the Hearst Metrotone News collection’s coverage of Mexico during the 1930’s and 1940’s.\n\n35mm, B/W, approx. 30 min.\n\nPreservation funded by the Film Noir Foundation\n\nCRY DANGER (1951)\n\nDirected by Robert Parrish\n\nIn this underappreciated noir gem, the terse, pitch-perfect Dick Powell portrays ex-convict Rocky Mulloy who returns to Los Angeles to find the gang who framed him. Aided by a hard-drinking, crippled ex-marine, Mulloy prowls the streets for justice while flopping at a Bunker Hill trailer camp, home to his ex-girlfriend, played by the graceful Rhonda Fleming.\n\nScreenplay: William Bowers. Cast: Dick Powell, Rhonda Fleming, Richard Erdman. 35mm, B/W, 79 min.\n\nPreservation funded by The Packard Humanities Institute\n\nKISS TOMORROW GOODBYE (1950)\n\nDirected by Gordon Douglas\n\nJames Cagney followed up his brilliant, ruthless performance in White Heat (1949) with his last great gangster turn in this adaptation of Horace McCoy’s 1948 crime novel. As wild hoodlum Ralph Cotter, Cagney snarls, struts, and chews up the scenery throughout a plot replete with twisted associations, heists, and blackmail schemes. Gordon Douglas’ efficient direction suits the sadistic low-budget independent production.\n\nScreenplay: Harry Brown. Cast: James Cagney, Barbara Payton, Helena Carter. 35mm, B/W, 103 min.\n\nBABY PEGGY: HOLLYWOOD’S TINY TITAN\n\nAt the dawn of the 1920s, precocious Baby Peggy captured the hearts and box office dollars of the theatre-going public worldwide. Discovered at the tender age of 19 months, Peggy-Jean Montgomery was cast in a series of shorts with Brownie the Wonder Dog before moving on to features at Universal in which her remarkable acting skills and iconic bob haircut created a sensation. Today she is known as Diana Serra Cary, author of several books, including her own biography, What Ever Happened to Baby Peggy? Unfortunately, her cinematic legacy did not fare as well. While a number of her films survive, many exist only as fragments, a number of which are included in our tribute to Baby Peggy.\n\nPreservation funded by David Stenn and The Packard Humanities Institute\n\nBROWNIE’S LITTLE VENUS (1921)\n\nDirected by Fred Hibbard\n\nScreenplay: Fred Hibbard.

From 1926-1931, Warner Bros. produced over 1000 Vitaphone shorts. Since its inception, UCLA Film & Television Archive has been committed to preserving as many of these as possible. This Festival, the Archive presents two nights of newly preserved Vitaphone shorts featuring Robert Gitt, preservation officer, in person.\n\nThe Vitaphone shorts in this program have been restored by Warner Bros., in collaboration with UCLA Film & Television Archive, the Library of Congress Packard Campus for Audio Visual Conservation, and The Vitaphone Project, with funding provided by Warner Bros. and Dudley Heer. Additional financial support provided by Emily Thompson and Scott Margolin.\n\nTHE KJERULF’S MAYFAIR QUINTETTE IN “A MUSICALE MELANGE” (VITAPHONE #2650) (1928)\n\n35mm, B/W, 6 min.\n\nANN CODEE AND FRANK ORTH IN “A BIRD IN THE HAND” (VITAPHONE #757) (1929)\n\n35mm, B/W, 10 min.\n\n“TRIFLES” (VITAPHONE #3722-3723) (1929)\n\nCast: Jason Robards, Sara Padden, Blanche Friderici. 35mm, B/W, 16 min.\n\nMARLOWE AND JORDAN IN “SONGS AND IMPRESSIONS” (VITAPHONE #2741) (1928)\n\n35mm, B/W, 8 min.\n\nARTHUR PAT WEST IN “SHIP AHOY” (VITAPHONE #2919) (1929)\n\n35mm, B/W, 8 min.\n\nDOOLEY & SALES IN “DOOLEY’S THE NAME” (VITAPHONE #824) (1929)\n\n35mm, B/W, 8 min.\n\nBORN & LAWRENCE IN “PIGSKIN TROUBLES” (VITAPHONE #2940) (1928)\n\n35mm, B/W, 8 min.\n\nHARRY FOX AND BEATRICE CURTIS IN THE BEE AND THE FOX (VITAPHONE #829) (1929)\n\n35mm, B/W, 8 min.\n\n“NIAGARA FALLS” (VITAPHONE #3778) (1930)\n\nCast: Bryant Washburn, Helen Jerome Eddy. 35mm, B/W, 11 min.\n\n“SHE WHO GETS SLAPPED” (VITAPHONE #3900) (1930)\n\nCast: Tommy Dugan, William Irving, Dorothy Christie. 35mm, B/W, 8 min.\n\n“WHAT A LIFE” (VITAPHONE #3849) (1930)\n\nCast: Virginia Sale, Sid Silvers, William Irving. 35mm, B/W, 11 min.\n\nPreservation funded by The Packard Humanities Institute\n\nPOT O' GOLD (1941)\n\nDirected by George Marshall\n\nIn this musical comedy, James Stewart sings for the second and last time in his career—and his voice isn’t half bad!
