        "text": "Hello…as I was searching for some of my family names I happened across your search for this Surname. I have compiled a book of Pioneer’s of Medina County, Ohio and remembered that I have seen that name in my search for my book.\n\nThis book covers newspaper articles, wedding, deaths, mini biographies, court records, cemetery records for most of the cemeteries in Medina Co., and much more.. from as early as 1800’s to 1906.\n\nIn some cases of death notices and marriages as well as the mini bio’s … family from other states are mentioned and information about their ancestors.\n\nI would be glad to let you know the first names I have for this surname...\n\nGood luck in your search….I know I have spent hours just to find one piece of my family tree puzzle.\n\nBeverly Elizabeth"
