        "text": "The Reading List is a feature of Poetry’s Editors’ Blog. This month, contributors to the November 2019 issue share some recommendations.\n\nDorothy Chan\n\nCurrently re-reading:\n\nRobert Schumann Is Mad Again, Norman Dubie\n\ntsunami vs. the fukushima 50, Lee Ann Roripaugh\n\nThe History of Art, Rae Gouirand\n\nOur Earliest Tattoos, Peter Twal\n\nturn around, BRXGHT XYXS, Rosebud Ben-Oni\n\nA Small Story about the Sky, Alberto Ríos\n\nrecombinant, Ching-In Chen\n\nFelt, Alice Fulton\n\nThe War Makes Everyone Lonely, Graham Barnhart\n\nVantage, Taneum Bambrick\n\nBlack Swan, Lyrae Van Clief-Stefanon\n\nCurrently/will soon be teaching:\n\nMess and Mess and, Douglas Kearney\n\nTender Data, Monica McClure\n\nAre You My Mother? Alison Bechdel\n\nSour Heart, Jenny Zhang\n\nThe Seven Necessary Sins for Women and Girls, Mona Eltahawy\n\nLong Live the Tribe of Fatherless Girls: A Memoir, T Kira Madden\n\nConvenience Store Woman, Sayaka Murata\n\nReeling Through Life: How I Learned to Live, Love, and Die at the Movies, Tara Ison\n\nOculus, Sally Wen Mao\n\nYear of the Snake, Lee Ann Roripaugh\n\nSons of Achilles, Nabila Lovelace\n\nVictoria Chang\n\nThere are so many books that I enjoy! There are lots more on my desk but these are the ones I’ve been enjoying at the moment (both poetry and prose):\n\nSet Me on Fire: A Poem for Every Feeling, edited by Ella Risbridger\n\nOculus by Sally Wen Mao\n\nBe Recorder by Carmen Giménez Smith\n\nThe Tradition by Jericho Brown\n\nDeaf Republic by Ilya Kaminsky\n\nOnly as the Day Is Long by Dorianne Laux\n\nOdes to Lithium by Shira Erlichman\n\nSpace Struck by Paige Lewis\n\nThe Undying by Anne Boyer\n\nDoomstead Days by Brian Teare\n\nDictionary of the Undoing by John Freeman\n\nDunce by Mary Ruefle\n\nThe Galleons by Rick Barot\n\nKevin Craft\n\nI spent part of my summer teaching an interdisciplinary arts and writing course in Rome. Between reading newspapers and gauging the self-defeating surges of global populism—on full display in Italy as in the US—I found solace in terrific books that reimagine classical history and myth. Favorites were Paisley Rekdal’s Nightingale, which fiercely reinvents Ovid’s Metamorphosis for the #MeToo era, and Karl Kirchwey’s Stumbling Blocks, which probes Roman roads and ruins—most notably those gold cobblestones which memorialize the deportations of Jews during WWII—for vestiges of political conscience and truth.\n\nCloser to home, books by several poets living in the Pacific Northwest (and one in Dubai) have filled me with radiant awe and inventive joy throughout the year. Keetje Kuipers’s All Its Charms and Bill Carty’s Huge Cloudy stand out for the tender, tough-minded ways they delve into familial rifts and intimate landscapes to reimagine the North American sublime. I feel the same way on a global scale about Lena Khalaf Tuffaha’s Water & Salt and Shara Lessley’s The Explosive Expert’s Wife, two poets who pluck genuine resilience from the spare language of profound cultural conflict—no small achievement in an era where compassionate truths that might alleviate suffering are lost in aggravated spin.\n\nKit Fan\n\nI should be ashamed of my promiscuous relationships with books but, luckily, I am not. These are the pre-Christmas encounters that I am having, re-having, and desperate to be having soon. The alphabetical order by surname disguises the pleasure of randomness.\n\nJohn Berger, And Our Faces, My Heart, Brief as Photos\n\nEmily Berry, Stranger, Baby\n\nJames Bridle, New Dark Age: Technology and the End of the Future\n\nAnna Burns, Milkman\n\nJohn Burnside, All One Breath\n\nNick Drake, Out of Range\n\nEllen Hinsey, The Illegal Age\n\nPierre Hadot, The Veil of Isis: An Essay on the History of the Idea of Nature\n\nJames Griffiths, The Great Firewall of China\n\nJorie Graham, Runaway\n\nHan Kang, The White Book\n\nDiana Khoi Nguyen, Ghost Of\n\nMaureen N. McLane, What I’m Looking For\n\nJoshua Mehigan, Accepting the Disaster\n\nHerman Melville, Moby Dick\n\nAnge Mlinko, Marvelous Things Overheard\n\nAlice Oswald, Nobody\n\nSamanta Schweblin, Mouthful of Birds\n\nChristine Gosnay\n\nThese are the books I’ve recently read and loved:\n\nThe Summer Book by Tove Jansson\n\nThe Invention of Morel by Adolfo Bioy Casares, translated by Ruth L. C. Simms\n\nGhachar Ghochar by Vivek Shanbhag, translated by Srinath Perur\n\nWomen Talking by Miriam Toews\n\nThe Worst Journey in the World by Apsley Cherry-Garrard\n\nThe Invention of Love by Tom Stoppard\n\nCharms by Paul Valéry\n\nPoems of Paul Celan translated by Michael Hamburger\n\nCollected Works by Lorine Niedecker\n\nThe Odes of Horace\n\nAnd these are the books I’m reading, or re-reading, now. It appears that I will be reading Proust until I die. As usual, there are more books that I’m reading at any given time than I ever finish. It lends horrible, terrific suspense to my reading life.\n\nEichmann in Jerusalem: A Report on the Banality of Evil by Hannah Arendt\n\nBasic Black with Pearls by Helen Weinzweig\n\nSPQR: A History of Ancient Rome by Mary Beard\n\nOne Hundred Years of Solitude by Gabriel García Márquez, translated by Gregory Rabassa\n\nIn Search of Lost Time by Marcel Proust, translated by C.K. Scott Moncrieff\n\nLives Other Than My Own by Emmanuel Carrère, translated by Linda Coverdale\n\nThe Book of Disquiet by Fernando Pessoa, translated by Richard Zenith\n\nThe Great Enigma: New Collected Poems by Tomas Tranströmer, translated by Robin Fulton\n\nLove by Stendhal, translated by Gilbert and Suzanne Sale\n\nGenevieve Kaplan\n\nSome books I’ve lately been reading or re-reading:\n\nAlexis Almeida, I Have Never Been Able to Sing (chapbook)\n\nBrent Armendinger, Street Gloss\n\nChiwan Choi, The Yellow House\n\nHilda Hilst, Of Death. Minimal Odes (translation by Laura Cesarco Eglin)\n\nAngela Hume, meat habitats (chapbook)\n\nNathalie Léger, Suite for Barbara Loden (translation by Natasha Lehrer and Cécile Menon)\n\nSawako Nakayasu, The Ants\n\nClaudia Rankine, Don’t Let Me Be Lonely\n\nMartha Ronk, Silences\n\nMichelle Brittan Rosado, Why Can’t It Be Tenderness\n\nJessica Smith, How to Know the Flowers\n\nMónica de la Torre, The Happy End / All Welcome\n\nSara Uribe, Antígona González (translation by John Pluecker)\n\nRosmarie Waldrop, Gap Gardening\n\nJeanne Larsen\n\nRight before a visit to the Center for Writers at the University of Southern Mississippi, I re-read Angela Ball’s stunning Talking Pillow. Afterward, I rushed to read Stranger by Adam Clay, and J.A. Bernstein’s novel Rachel’s Tomb. I just reviewed The Fisher Queen by Kathryn Kirkpatrick for the Hollins Critic.\n\nOther recent top-notch reads/re-reads:\n\nChad Abushanab, The Last Visit\n\nLauren K. Alleyne, Honeyfish\n\nErica Dawson, When Rap Spoke Straight to God\n\nRebecca Morgan Frank, Sometimes We’re All Living in a Foreign Country\n\nBecky Gould Gibson, Indelible\n\nLinda Gregerson, Prodigal\n\nAlyson Hagy, Scribe (novel)\n\nCathryn Hankla, Galaxies\n\nTwyla Hansen, Rock · Tree · Bird\n\nDavid Huddle, My Surly Heart\n\nPatricia Spears Jones, A Lucent Fire\n\nUrsula K. Le Guin, So Far So Good\n\nTyler Mills, Hawk Parable\n\nMiles Waggener, Superstition Freeway\n\nAnnie Woodford, Bootleg\n\nI’ve started Don Paterson’s 600+ page book of theory/craft/electric/ranting, The Poem: Lyric, Sign, Metre. Onward.\n\nAe Hee Lee\n\nPoetry collections I’ve waded through most recently:\n\nSchizophrene by Bhanu Kapil\n\nTeeth by Aracelis Girmay\n\nBestiary by Donika Kelly\n\nCenzontle by Marcelo Hernandez Castillo\n\nMarilyn by Amanda Ngoho Reavey\n\nLove, Robot by Margaret Rhee\n\nAutobiography of So-and-So by Maurice Kilwein Guevara\n\nJoy Manesiotis\n\nI am reading in Medieval spirituality and illuminated manuscripts—from bestiary to religious treatise—as ballast for the poems I am working on, but I will list here more contemporary work, published and forthcoming, that I am equally engaged in.\n\nThe Tradition, Jericho Brown\n\nThe River Twice, Kathleen Graber\n\nHouse of Lords and Commons, Ishion Hutchinson\n\nEvery Ravening Thing, Marsha de la O\n\nFalling Awake, Alice Oswald\n\nIf the house, Molly Spencer\n\nFoxlogic, Fireweed, Jennifer K. Sweeney\n\nAnd, teaching:\n\nSome Say the Lark, Jennifer Chang\n\nWhen My Brother Was an Aztec, Natalie Diaz\n\nHum, Jamaal May\n\nAnd, always:\n\nSong and The Orchard, Brigit Pegeen Kelly\n\nElegy and The Darkening Trapeze, Larry Levis\n\nValzhyna Mort\n\nAutobiography of Death by Kim Hyesoon (translated from the Korean by Don Mee Choi) pushes the language of loss to absurdity in order to show that we have forgotten how to mourn. Hyesoon’s shamanistic repetitions and illogical similes resist emotional atrophy. The book was triggered by the deaths of school children in a 2014 ferry accident, and it goes straight to the heart of “prayers and thoughts” offered to the victims of school violence in this country.\n\nThe playfulness of Aleš Šteger’s Above the Sky Beneath the Earth (translated from the Slovenian by Brian Henry) is contagious: Here comes Aleš Šteger. His name is protein. His body is a Central Committee. His language is dirty but his shirt is perfectly white (I’m quoting across the poems to capture Steger’s speaker). His “cherished doctor, internationally ill expert on the manufacture of souls” speaks to César Vallejo’s “Mr. Minister of Health,” mocking the life we’ve manufactured out of our ills and longings.\n\nOn the English-language side of my bed right now: Carolyn Forché’s What You Have Heard Is True; Matthew Zapruder’s Father’s Day; Negative Space by Luljeta Lleshanaku (translated from the Albanian by Ani Gjika); and Elena Fanailova’s The Russian Version (translated from the Russian by Stephanie Sandler and Genya Turovskaya).\n\nCharles Shields\n\nI don’t write poems as much as I render them in the spirit of a sensibility, in the spirit of the production of the spirit and sensibility of poetry itself; likewise, I love largely textless renditions of text, naked linguistic codes, things like:\n\nNothing in MoMA by Abraham Adams\n\nSelected Writings of Mirtha Dermisache\n\nProse Architectures by Renee Gladman\n\nHair Paintings by Jarrett Key\n\nSET by Na Kim\n\nAnd I love exhibition catalogues, especially:\n\nBlackness in Abstraction from Pace Gallery\n\nSpeech/Acts from Futurepoem in collaboration with the Institute of Contemporary Art at the University of Pennsylvania\n\nClaudine Toutoungi\n\nLately, I have been dipping into and very much enjoying:\n\nThe Half-Finished Heaven: Selected Poems by Tomas Tranströmer, translated by Robert Bly\n\nPoems New and Collected, 1957–1997 by Wisława Szymborska\n\nMy Poems Won’t Change the World: Selected Poems by Patrizia Cavalli, edited by Gini Alhadeff\n\nFeel Free by Nick Laird\n\nAnd, when it’s out early next year, I’m very much looking forward to reading Heaven by Manuel Vilas, translated by James Womack."
