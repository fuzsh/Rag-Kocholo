        "text": "#965 Wanda\n\n1970 // USA // Barbara Loden\n\nCriterion Collection (LINK)\n\nLetterboxd (LINK)\n\nIt’s a shame that I don’t share the same passionate love to WANDA as the majority of the film critics and film-lovers considering the film is one of the handful female-directed films included in the Sight and Sound Greatest Films poll in 2012. I understand how remarkable the film was as being the first film ever a woman directed, written and starred in it. It’s impossible not to talk about the film without diving into Barbara Loden‘s life. Long story short, Barbara Loden was a phenomenal actress, she was married to the famous American director Elia Kazan who evidently was far from the most approving husband or creative collaborators one could imagine, even worse is Kazan’s disparaging and dishonest treatment towards her. As far as I know Loden’s creative output was unfortunately very limited as her life was cut short by cancer at the age of 48. WANDA, the first and the only full-length feature Loden ever directed, has been often regarded as a groundbreaking cinéma vérité feminist film with anti-Hollywood romanticism and piercing portrait of a passive woman.\n\nFamously the film was inspired by a real life story of a woman who thanked the judge for sentencing her to 20-year prison on account of being an accomplice to a male robber in a bank robbery. This ‘heist’ story and the relationship between the woman and the male robber, known as Wanda (Barbara Loden) and Mr. Dennis (Michael Higgins), in the film constitute the main narrative framework. But WANDA is anything but the drifting nature of a unequiped woman dislocated from the bleak society, who’s leaning on the callous men she met by chance and surviving through a protective mechanism of passivity against male’s hostility and humiliation. The character of Wanda is built from Loden’s poor upbringing and her present quandary when her talent was belittled and her voice was muted in a patriarchal industry.\n\nThe cinematography and editing by Nicholas T. Proferes conveys a spontaneity and intimacy on a character who is hardly sympathetic throughout. She’s not a good mother, nor a good wife under the usual definition made by males (men: wife should stay at home, clean the house and take care of the children while I’m working and earning money). During the court scene at the beginning of the film, Wanda’s husband requested a divorce and took the full custody of their children, Wanda was late and coming in with a cigarette on her hand, she admitted the children are better off with their father and dispassionately concurred with the court. The lack of the background information of Wanda is offset by Loden’s authentic and tender performance as a soft-speaking woman. Wanda’s pathetic way of living hinted at a non-nurturing growing environment. The coal-mining landscape Wanda crossed in the morning as captured by the camera from a far distance sets up the tone for the rest of the film, that is bleak and tarnish.\n\nShe encountered Mr. Dennis incidentally in a closed bar and mistook him as a bartender. In fact Mr. Dennis was robbing. Soon Wanda followed him and unwittingly became an partner-in-crime. Many comments on the pair as anti-BONNIE AND CLYDE, unequivocally WANDA eschewed the romanticism of Hollywood gangster picture and instead exhibited a vulgarity rarely seen in Hollywood films. The lack of dramatic urgency indeed bores me a bit and I never find the character of Mr. Dennis compelling (Michael Higgins did a remarkable job here though). The last act involving a hostage scenario and a bank robbery looks like a scenario taken out from a sitcom but played with utter seriousness. The second half does lose me a little and the relationship between the two main characters falls into the stereotypical hard-hearted petty thief and a clumsy dumb blonde sidekick category.\n\nThe nuisance only truly delivered in the last 10 minutes when Wanda was all by herself again, as lost and helpless as she was before. Her usual tactic of finding a ‘causal’ man was self-rejected at the last moment. The last shot, a freeze frame on Wanda holding a cigarette between two fingers inside a bar while looking alienated, speaks louder than any words. She’s adrift on her meaningless life and barely living for the rest of her life. WANDA puts the spotlight on a ‘loser,’ a real human being one may encounter and overlook on the street. I won’t say it’s a masterpiece, though in WANDA I see so much potential for Loden’s subsequent works and sadly they never came to fruition (Loden did directed two short films afterwards). It’s the biggest resentment in the history of American cinema, still I’m grateful WANDA exists and reminds us how plainly difficult a woman’s life is, even you’re talented."
