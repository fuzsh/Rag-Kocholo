        "text": "It was critic Andrew Sarris, I believe, who described Elia Kazan’s artistic output on film as a devolution “from the Method of Streetcar to the madness of” Splendor in the Grass. There can be no doubting that the latter verges on insanity, but it’s quite possible to debate what this means, that is, whether this fact dismisses the film from all serious consideration as art or entertainment. After all, two or three of Werner Herzog’s masterpieces stretch beyond the limits of sanity, and I’m not even taking into account Heart of Glass (1976), for which Herzog had his entire cast hypnotized. The passage of time breeds nostalgia, and returning to Kazan’s fevered high school romance is like visiting an old, demented, institutionalized friend. Splendor in the Grass is so frenzied one wants to comfort it.\n\nWhen this film about Midwestern sexual repression in the 1920s appeared in 1961 it became a hit, drawing an audience from teenagers, Kazanians, and people like my mother in search of a “good cry” in a world where Irene Dunne and Bette Davis no longer were young enough to churn out the requisite occasions for securing this. The film’s principal target audience, however, was undoubtedly the first on the list; the stamp of its studio, Warner Bros., certified its kid-friendliness. Alas, Warner Bros., which thirty years earlier was synonymous with crusading films of social and political protest, had become, by dint of hour-long television adventure-dramas aimed at the young, synonymous with highschoolers anticipating itchily the “sexual revolution” to come. The message of Splendor in the Grass? American Puritanism is just so unfair, Father and Mother! Why can’t you see that?\n\nWorking from a(n Oscar-winning) script by playwright William Inge, Kazan thus whipped up a flagrant soap opera, replete with teenage angst and sighs and much talk about what “bad” girls do and “good” girls don’t, to show the world how kids felt. And the kids flocked to it, motivated by the deluge of ads for it on the TV shows they watched, and they weren’t fooled for a minute. The script insisted “1928 Kansas”; the kids said instead, “1961 America.” To them, the film was as hotly contemporary as the favorite of their older brothers and sisters, Nicholas Ray’s Rebel Without a Cause (1955), also from Warner Bros., and Natalie Wood, starring in both, was there to cement the connection for possible nonbelievers. The earlier film addressed how misunderstood kids felt as a result of their insensible parents; this new one addressed far weightier matter: how boys of all moral stripes were allowed their nooky while “decent” girls had to do without. It’s enough to drive a girl nuts.\n\nAnd, in a nutshell, that’s what happens in Kazan’s noisy, slambanging emotional extravaganza that runs the gamut from Warren Beatty to Phyllis Diller, both in their film debuts.\n\nThe central character is Wilma Dean Loomis (“Deanie,” about which more later), a “good” bourgeois girl in intense puppy-love with tall, handsome, athletic Arthur (“Bud,” about which more later), the son of the town’s loudest and most powerful member (the puns keep coming), Ace Stamper. Ace doesn’t want a sissy for a son (more about which later), so he openly encourages the boy in the direction of the “right” kind of promiscuity; but class prejudice also being what it is in 1928, or 1961, or 2007 America, he sees no Loomis girl in his son’s future. Bud is bound for Yale after all. In the meantime, Bud can’t think of another girl; Deanie holds his heart, if little else. Having raised her daughter right, Deanie’s mother has counseled her to resist at all costs her raging hormones. Meanwhile, the boy has raging hormones of his own. The film opens with the youngsters frantically kissing by a flagrant and tacky waterfall: Bud presses; Deanie dutifully halts the action. If only the fool had the slightest degree of wit he might have quipped, “Would’st thou leave me so unsatisfied?” Whatever the iron girdle of Deanie’s upbringing, there must be a way around it. It turns out there unhappily is: another girl. Feeling wounded and abandoned, “good” girl Deanie starts imitating “bad” girl Ginny, Bud’s wild sister. Poor Ginny: her brother has received all the parental attention, turning her into a tramp; but, inadvertently, Deanie’s choice of a role model to help (in her mind) win Bud back hints one of the repressed secrets of Inge-Kazan’s family melodrama. Forbidden love of one kind is the text of the film; forbidden love of another kind is the film’s subtext.\n\nThe incestuous hint that the film almost casually provides—Bud and Ginny are clearly nuts about each other, in a big sisterly-younger brotherly way—in turn directs our attention (by substitution, symbolism, displacement—whatever you care to call it) to the real “forbidden love” floating in and around, under and through the narrative and its peculiar presentation. Homosexuality.\n\nLet us first remind ourselves that Inge was himself homosexual. But more than this, Inge’s plays, as is the case with Picnic and Bus Stop, are often thinly veiled productions of gay feelings and experience. Here, in Splendor, Kazan, who was not homosexual, does nothing to reformulate the content beneath the veil and even takes a few steps to lift the veil. Bud’s principal source of guidance and pressure is, of course, his father. (Ace derives from the patriarch in Inge’s mentor Tennessee Williams’s Cat on a Hot Tin Roof; think of Ace as Little Big Daddy.) What drives Ace, therefore, is what indirectly drives Bud. Even the most casual perusal of the continual father-son exchanges in this film suggests that the thing Ace most dreads is that his son not prove himself “a man.” This, in turn, adds fuel to the hormonal fire of Bud’s attraction to Deanie; at first a true heart, Bud wants to prove himself, for his own sake and his father’s sake, with the one girl he actually puppy-loves. It’s another of his father’s periodic interventions, in addition to Deanie’s sexual reticence and reluctance, that redirects the boy elsewhere. We can connect the dots. The principal reason why Ace would be so concerned about Bud in this regard (from what we see) is that he is projecting onto his son repressed doubts about his own sexuality. To go one step further, and to tie this back to the brother-sister thing, it’s quite possible that Ace is in such a tizzy because he is coping with repressed, or barely repressed, sexual feelings toward his own son. Or his daughter. (It’s hard to say which.) This might also help explain the out-of-control aspect of Pat Hingle’s weird performance.\n\nGlimpsed from another angle, the entire film seems like a gay charade. Consider the names. Let’s dispose of the most indelicately suggestive one first. Ace suggests ace-in-the-hole. Having set that ickiest example aside, let’s turn to the nicknames of the two kids. Inevitably for Inge, Bud suggests Herman Melville’s innocent, young Billy Budd, the “jewel” of the men aboard the ship the Rights-of-Man, a pacifier capable of “sugaring the sour ones,” and one whose presence restored to Captain Graveling (whose surname in the slang of Melville’s day meant “going against the grain”) the pleasurable use of his “pipe.” In short (or long), there is probably no divorcing Arthur Stamper’s nickname from a web of homoerotic suggestions. In the case of “Deanie” (unlike Wilma), the name is blatantly adrogynous. Underscoring the blatancy are the allusion to James Dean, the gay star of Rebel Without a Cause, and the actress that was cast in the role.\n\nWood began as a child star in such films as Tomorrow Is Forever (1946) and Miracle on 34th Street (1947), in both of which she acted memorably. By the time Wood played the daughter of the Bette Davis character in The Star (1952), her appearance had become highly androgynous. She was in her mid-teens, and this was entirely normal. Although pretty, Wood did not outgrow this aspect of her appearance, however. In Splendor in the Grass, she is still androgynous. When I was a young teenager, the jokes about Wood on the school playground came as thick as flies. She was her spouse Robert Wagner’s lookalike. In West Side Story (the same year as Splendor), Richard Beymer as Tony was the girlish one. Some of the other jokes, coarser and even more cruel than these two, frontally assaulted the notion that Wood was biologically female. It’s reasonable to assume that my Long Island schoolmates weren’t unique and that Wood had in fact been cast for the boyish air she would bring to the part. The following year, Warner Bros. made an attempt to showcase her “femininity” by casting her (despite her wee-breastedness) as stripper Gypsy Rose Lee in Gypsy, hoping audiences would note a contrast between the boyish Wood early in the film and the glamorous young woman she is supposed to become; but three years hence, perhaps to assert her pluck over private humiliation, she flaunted her boyishness in Inside Daisy Clover. This film, unlike the others, flopped, breaking the spine of her career. Natalie Wood was washed up, and she wasn’t 30 yet.\n\nThematically, all the name- and (with Wood) visual play on gayness resolves itself to such a statement as this: while the puritanical strain in our culture and society often forbids even heterosexual sex, how much worse it is for those trapped in the layer of repression underneath the norm. That is one-half of the film’s argument-by-association. The other half is this: homosexual dread may in fact be contributing to, may be underpinning, taboos against boy-girl sex. This is fairly interesting stuff, but Kazan’s film fails on the grounds of its formal deficiencies.\n\nI have already remarked on how brutally loud and noisy a film Kazan has wrought; if he really wished to pursue the development of a serious dramatic thread, he would have made a sparer, quieter, more reflective piece of work. The muted colors his cinematographer, Boris Kaufman, devises are admirable, but Kazan puts them to as little use as he does any other visual properties; there isn’t a single interesting or compelling shot in the entire film. Alas, Splendor in the Grass is one more clunky piece of junk that proceeds by scenes rather than shots. Inge is still behaving as a playwright, and Kazan finds no way around this. Finally, the acting stinks. Wood may bring an interesting, thematically pertinent dimension to her role by the androgynousness of her appearance, but like nearly all her performances past childhood this one is wooden, shallow, mechanical; she is laughable, in fact, whenever she emotes, for instance, when Deanie becomes hysterical in a bathtub, crying and yelling at her mother, dropping her head below water in anticipation of her later attempt to drown herself—scenes that should haunt now that Wood herself has drowned, having fallen off her boat, christened Splendour in memory of Kazan’s film. (Should, but don’t, given how little residue of affection had held fast to the star by the time of her rumor-clad death in 1981, by which time she had divorced and remarried Wagner.) Beatty is better, if conventional, in his suffering, but the studied way he overplays his hand when Bud, now married, converses with Deanie when, fresh from the sanatorium, she visits him at the end is another of the film’s low points. His “I guess . . .” philosophizing is preposterous, although given the selfconsciousness of the writing it’s hard to see how anyone could have convincingly played it. Much more disappointing than these two actors, from whom we expect little,* though, is Barbara Loden, who is scarcely better than Wood as Ginny, the one human heart, along with Deanie’s father, beating, however unsteadily or lowly, in this film. Kazan would marry Loden, who would play the Marilyn Monroe-character in perhaps Arthur Miller’s best play, After the Fall, and who would give a superlative performance, self-directed, in a film surpassing anything Kazan ever did: Wanda (1971). Regrettably, Loden died of cancer much too soon.\n\nThere was splendor in the lass.\n\n* Of course, low expectations sometimes add a further bonus to unexpected pleasure. Case in point: Beatty’s marvelous performance in Robert Altman’s McCabe & Mrs. Miller (1971)."
