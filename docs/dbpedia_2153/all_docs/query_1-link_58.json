        "text": "2005 06 22 James Agee was embarrassed by the blatant sexuality of orchids; how about my queen palm? which just dropped its drawers for all the world to see.\n\nMy photo is of the tree, not the house, which I just painted.\n\nIt’s the west side of the house which is well-planted; the east side gets far too much sun.\n\nCoincidental to my noticing the palm’s latest display I met an attractive young woman, herself a seeming display of fecundity. “My name is …” and she named a famous actress: one almost exactly my age. I asked if that most beautiful of actresses’ surname, chosen for her career, was indeed this young woman’s surname. No, the actress’ full name was her given name: I still don’t know the young woman’s surname.\n\nI wrote this differently on first posting it. Now circumstances entice me to revise considerably; but also to expand: at Knatz.com if not fully here. You see I soon learned that the young woman was in trouble, a whole heap of trouble. And though the visitor can soon tell that given name for themself, I am not trying to add to that woman’s trouble: not that my neighbors can read: especially not blogs. And if they do, it will be to do no good.\n\nOne aspect of her trouble had to do with the landlord. Apparently there’s some question of lease and rent concerning the trailer I met her in front of: a horrible dump back by the sewage treatment ponds. The landlord, a decent fellow as landlords go, was bitching about garbage, and about illegal entry. Apparently the tenants had been driving over locked gates, breaking windows for entrance …\n\nWhen I saw her again she looked haunted, said she was fleeing her husband. When I next saw her she said she was fine: everything was fine.\n\nActually this woman looks nothing like her namesake. She is however the spitting image of Daniela Hantuchova!\n\nHer situation reminded me of the play A Taste of Honey which thrilled London audiences by opening with two woman rolling onto the stage after climbing through a sewer grating: escaping from their landlord! I don’t know exactly who’s who in the current, or recent drama, with my own landlord. I don’t know for sure that the woman I speak of and her husband are the ones in trouble with the landlord: they could be subletting (illegally) from the lease holder. And it is not my business to cause additional trouble for her – or to get in trouble myself with her husband, talking with some freedom about his wife. I wish that woman well – and wish I could help. Ha! Me! In Sebring Gardens: a place that despises help, and has long not deserved any [Link to be restored].\n\nBut: I live my life to say what I want to say, to say what I believe needs saying.\n\nThe young woman, on telling me her name, told me that her mother named her after seeing Splendor in the Grass (1961). By the late 1950s I knew some Elia Kazan, thought the world of Streetcar Named Desire, On the Waterfront, East of Eden … But, I had never seen Splendor in the Grass. So I rented it from NetFlix.com: and am in the middle of watching it. Thus far I find the movie to be much to the point of this post: and I intend to develop this post to say what I mean. And damn the torpedoes.\n\nA quick word on the movie, Splendor in the Grass, now that I’ve finished viewing it: first, it’s an excellent example of conflict of myth. High school kids in the 1920s: hot to trot. But Natalie Wood’s Deannie is told to be a good girl. Her young love, Bud (Warren Beatty), the football hero, is told by his father that he has to go to Yale. He can marry Deannie after Yale, his father will send them to Europe: meantime, go with a bad girl. Bud’s sister Ginny (Barbara Loden) is in not much better a pickle. She too is supposed to be a good girl, but of course with the father’s oil company she’s got the wardrobe, the leisure, the opportunity … to get drunk. Not to be drunk, mind you: to get drunk. So she’s precocious even for the age at becoming a floosie.\n\nThe parents are stock parents: conventional, ambitious, church-going: Christians ha ha. The father paid his dues by falling off an oil rig: so the son has to be the athlete; the father just makes money: 1929 coming ha ha. The kids are told to cross their legs. No one instructs them on the use of hands, mouth …\n\nSo what does Deannie do? She goes nuts. At least her parents sell their stock before the crash and send their little girl to the looney bin.\n\nShe comes out a couple of years later. Bud has dropped out, flunked out, opted out of Yale, but married the nice pizza girl. Deannie sees him, meets the wifey, but gets her head straight remembering Wordsworth. I think Wordsworth wanted to recollect natural beauty in tranquility: reprocess memory; Deannie uses his words to decide that the best is behind her, grow up, and get on with whatever is left: a happy ending given the situation.\n\nDeannie’s parents are so worried that the shrinks will use Freud to teach her to blame her parents – not an unfounded fear; not an unreasonable position either. But she doesn’t: she just sees them, sensibly, as people.\n\nNatalie Wood was very good, as was the movie as a whole. But I want to emphasize the society frustrating the young, preparing round pegs for square holes.\n\nFreud‘s ahem ideas were spreading by the 1920s. But they hadn’t spread to Bud’s or to Deannie’s parents who were still strictly in the Victorian and empire thing, for which Yale and the father’s oil company are nice symbols: actualities. Yale would try to turn the horny foot baller into the executive the father thought he wanted. pk point: Neither Freud nor Splendor in the Grass has yet reached my neighbors. They are clones of Deannie’s parents: a lots of don’ts and few insteads.\n\nI don’t know the young woman I met: except for her given name, the circumstances of being given the name, and her attractive appearance. But I can easily imagine her, despite the mother’s loving the movie, as having had not much different a history than her mother had had herself: identifying with Natalie Wood’s Deannie. In this society I am not likely to get to know that young woman: and I don’t mean me trying to seduce her! What? me? with no teeth most of the time? seldom shaved? bumping around barefoot in shorts and a tee shirt? No: she’s married! She’s busy! I just mean being friendly, being sympathetic. Being interested. What would her husband say? What would the neighbors say? (What they already say: Paul is a loose canon. Beware.) I’m sure that this woman can see that as well or better than I can.\n\nBut I’ll take the occasion to strike one of my many irons: a sensible society would let young people fuck. Get out of their way. That’s what they need. Don’t interfere.\n\nLots of babies would be born. Good. Take care of them. Everybody.\n\nThe young shouldn’t have to care for their babies: unless they want to. They’re not equipped for it. It’s the middle aged people who are equipped for parenthood. They’re employed. They’re beginning to own property. Those who can should care for the young: and I don’t mean government trained teachers, social workers, experts. I mean people. You and me. Him and her.\n\nAh, but what about when the kids have too many babies? Abort them: before, during, or after term. Trim the population. (And if you don’t think the mother is promising as a mother, abort her too! I don’t mean the state; no, you or me: abort her whatever her age, and the no good papa too.)\n\nBut the new population should come from the young, the juicy. Think how much easier the births would be, how much healthier, how much smarter, the children. Our future.\n\n2005 07 09 update: I just “learned” a couple more rumors that lend additional perspective on this budding woman’s plight: She’d rent the trailer by the week from the leasee. She paid the first week but made no additional payments. She’d been hitting residents up for money, for the use of their phone – though she carried her own cell phone. When the landlord pointed out that she’d bent the fence with her car, her excuse was that she’d only bent it a little, he ought to be able to fix it without much problem. … That’s enough. The world, Florida in particular, is filled with people around whom trouble breeds. Some of them are female, young, and too damn attractive.\n\nApparently she’s gone: and it may be just as well for those remaining here.\n\nI mean what I said above about the young: the soup was sour before they add their own irresponsibilities.\n\n2011 09 05 I post this at IonaArc in 2005, before I was arrested, censored, my domains destroyed by the fed. The graphics had resided at PKImaging.com. I didn’t realize till today that the post was showing text but couldn’t show the images. So, rather than link the piece in an IonaArc menu I just move it here, pix and all.\n\n2012 07 20 I wish I had gotten a good picture of a different palm of mine that was just in flower: most beautiful tree flowers I’ve ever seen, like a head on a glass of Irish beer. Now I see that you can just see the tree I mean in the photo above which shows the caladiums growing in a tub on my trailer hitch. The tree in question is to the left, just visible above the car port. It’s much taller and broader now: has four “towers” at the top. And by golly now that I notice it, it’s in flower here too!"
