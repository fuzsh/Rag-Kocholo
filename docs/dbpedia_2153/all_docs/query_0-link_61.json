        "text": "Steve Carson Mon Mar 31 15:33:17 1997\n\nLooking for information concerning the parents and grandparents of James Richard Haggard. According to his headstone at the Fairfield cemetery, he was born June 28, 1939 and died December 19, 1905. He served in Company G, 17 Tennessee Infantry in the Civil War. He married Mary Ridner. According to her headstone at the Fairfield cemetery she was born September 28, 1842 and died July 24, 1925. We have family records (a will) from Samuel Haggard and believe that he was the grandfather or great grandfather of James Richard Haggard. Also looking for information about O.W. (Ollie) Haggard (my great grandfather), and son of James Richard Haggard. According to his headstone at the Fairfield cemetery, he was born March 29, 1880 and died February 16, 1911.
