        "text": "Correction Appended\n\nELIA KAZAN\n\nA Biography.\n\nBy Richard Schickel.\n\nIllustrated. 510 pp.\n\nHarperCollins\n\nPublishers. $29.95.\n\nA BIOGRAPHER'S life is not an easy one. Aside from taxing demands of I.R.S. (insight, research, style), there is the supreme test of tact: knowing what to include, what to exclude. There are not only sins, but also virtues, of omission. A good biography is like a good marriage: biographer and biographee (if they knew each other personally) must have a mutual love, but a discriminatingly nuanced rather than blind one. And both had better be interesting. All this obtains in Richard Schickel's \"Elia Kazan: A Biography,\" the life story of the distinguished stage and screen director.\n\nNo mere page turner, this is a page devourer, generating the kind of suspense that is usually the province of the playwright or novelist. But Elia Kazan's life, as lived and written up here, is dramatic to a fault, and easily as strange as fiction.\n\nTo start with the prose, take this sentence from the discussion of the making of Arthur\n\nMiller's \"All My Sons,\" during which, Schickel says, Kazan started \"inhabiting that sublime zone directors sometimes achieve, a zone in which they sense that their every decision is the right one.\" Promptly, there is even better: Kazan \"wanted his actors to bring their discoveries to him, like children finding pretty objects on a beach.\" Lest, however, this make Kazan out to be a laissez-faire director, there follows, \"Impact -- the more shattering the better -- was everything with Kazan.\" And there you have him: permissive yet manipulative, enlightened but also commercial.\n\nKazan is a tough subject because there is so much to deal with. Equally renowned as a stage and screen director, he also became a lacerating autobiographer and prolific novelist. He helped found the enormously influential Actors Studio, cradle of the questionable \"Method.\" He kept profuse, revelatory notes on virtually every project he undertook; there are numerous published articles by and interviews with him, including a book-length one with the French critic Michel Ciment. Further, he appears in autobiographies by major writers. Moreover, as a friendly witness naming names to the House Committee on Un-American Activities, he became politically controversial, necessitating knowledge of the McCarthy era and its long shadow. Lastly, this complex and contradictory figure has inspired reams of important film and drama criticism.\n\nAnd even that is not quite the last. There remains Kazan the great adulterous womanizer, with his passion for blondes. From the semiautobiographical novel \"The Arrangement,\" Schickel quotes, \"Being Greek, blondness is my fetish.\" (Opposites, you'll recall, attract.) \"All three of Kazan's wives were blondes,\" Schickel writes. \"Almost invariably his leading ladies were, too.\"\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
