She was the first woman to write, direct and star in her own feature film, Wanda, which won the International Critics Award at the 1970 Venice Film Festival. Loden also directed several off-Broadway plays. Loden was a life member of the famed The Actors Studio and appeared in several projects directed by second husband, noted film director, Elia Kazan, including Splendor in the Grass. Loden also appeared as a regular sidekick on the irreverent The Ernie Kovacs Television Show, where she would get pies thrown in her face or pretend to be “sawed in half.”\n\nStage plays\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbara_Loden#Stage_plays\n\nSelected filmography\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbara_Loden#Selected_filmography\n\nAwards and nominations\n\nAfter the Fall – Tony Award – Best Actress\n\nWanda - International Critics Award – Venice Film Festival"
