        "text": "Wanda\n\nWanda is a female given name of Polish origin. It probably derives from the tribal name of the Wends. The name has long been popular in Poland where the legend of Princess Wanda has been circulating since at least the 12th century. In 1947 Wanda was cited as the second most popular name, after Mary, for Polish girls, and the most popular from Polish secular history. The name was made familiar in the English-speaking world by the 1883 novel Wanda, written by Ouida, the story line of which is based on the last years of the Hechingen branch of the Swabian House of Hohenzollern. In the United States, Wanda attained its highest popularity in the year 1934 peaking then at No. 47 on the list of names most frequently given to female infants. The name is popularly interpreted as meaning \"wanderer.\"\n\nWANDA\n\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, Wanda is ranked #76029 in terms of the most common surnames in America.\n\nThe Wanda surname appeared 253 times in the 2010 census and if you were to sample 100,000 people in the United States, approximately 0 would have the surname Wanda.\n\n71.9% or 182 total occurrences were White.\n\n14.2% or 36 total occurrences were Black.\n\n10.2% or 26 total occurrences were Asian.\n\n1.9% or 5 total occurrences were of Hispanic origin.\n\nMarvel Studios:\n\nBut it would have taken away from Wanda, which is what we didn't want to do, we didn't want the end of the show to be commoditized to go to the next movie — here's the white guy,' Let me show you how power works.'.\n\nElizabeth Smart:\n\nElizabeth Smart was held captive by Brian David Mitchell and his wife, Wanda Barzee, for nine months, and the case captivated the nation just months after the 2002 Winter Olympics took place in Salt Lake City. Elizabeth Smart was raped, tethered to trees by steel cables and left without food and water for days at a time. Elizabeth Smart recalled what Elizabeth Smart said to Brian David Mitchell on the night Elizabeth Smart was kidnapped. There finally came a point where I remember stopping Brian David Mitchell and just saying, ‘ If you're just going to rape and kill me, please do it here,' because in my mind I was thinking I want my parents to know what happened to me, I wanted them to find me even if it was just my body, brian David Mitchell had this smile and it was just, it was bone chilling … Brian David Mitchell said, ‘ I'm not going to rape and murder you. Yet,' Elizabeth Smart added. Wanda Barzee was sentenced to 15 years in prison in 2010, and Brian David Mitchell is serving two life terms. Elizabeth Smart will talk about how Elizabeth Smart moved past the harrowing incident 15 years later, according to E ! News. The special will air on Nov. 12 and 13 before the Lifetime original movie.\n\nBen Crump:\n\nIt's heart-wrenching. That's why Wanda Cooper-Jones need prayers, and Wanda Cooper-Jones need the pastors' prayers for Wanda Cooper-Jones, just so Wanda Cooper-Jones can try to keep Wanda Cooper-Jones sanity, if this was your child, how would you keep composure after you see these people lynch him and then you see them offer this self-defense and people are actually taking this as if it's credible ?"
