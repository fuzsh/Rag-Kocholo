        "text": "THIS IS THE FIRST biography ever written about Italian-born French actress, dancer, singer, and producer Marisa Pavan, who acquired fame during the Golden Age of Hollywood in the 1950s and in American television in the 1960s and 1970s. Pavan is the twin sister of actress Pier Angeli (1932–1971), who is best known today for her ill-fated relationship with actor James Dean. Pavan is also the widow of Jean-Pierre Aumont (1911–2001), a famous stage and screen actor and writer in France and in the United States.\n\nBased on extensive interviews with Pavan herself and with various people who have known her and worked with her over the years, this book is a tribute to Pavan’s life and career, with a focus on her Hollywood years and the studio system and star system through which she had to navigate. It is part of a bigger biographical project that includes a French-English website, www.marisapavan.com.\n\n“This is a wonderful book about one of the loveliest women I’ve ever known, Marisa Pavan. Margaux Soumoy has captured not only Marisa, but her whole family. Her trials and tribulations helped her become the actress, mother and wife that she is today. I think you will enjoy this book as much as I did, and will love Marisa as much as I do.“\n\nRobert J. Wagner"
