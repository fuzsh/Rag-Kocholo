Angeli made her debut opposite Vittorio de Sica in Leonide Moguy's Domani é troppo Tardi (Tomorrow is Too Late, 1949). A year later, she filmed the sequel, Domani é un altro Giorno. Both films dealt with the pain of adolescence and the need for sexual guidance. Fred Zinnemann then hired her for the title role of his soulful Italian bride Teresa (MGM, 1951), which was filmed in Italy. At this time, she met singer Vic Damone who was stationed as a soldier there. Moving to Hollywood with her mother and sister, Angeli became a close friend of Debbie Reynolds (who taught her American slang), dated James Dean and Kirk Douglas, and surprised everyone by marrying Damone in 1954.\n\nDuring the 1950s, Angeli played the lead in many Hollywood films, generally as the fragile innocent. She also struggled with injuries in her personal life. In 1955, she fell aboard an airplane while pregnant and broke her pelvis; fortunately, a healthy son was born that August. The following year, she broke her ankle and had a miscarriage. In addition, her marriage to Damone was little more than a series of separations and reconciliations; Damone blamed their problems on a meddling mother-in-law, and they were divorced in 1959. The next six years were taken up with custody battles over their son."
