Born on June 19, 1932, in Cagliari, Sardinia, Italy, she gained recognition not only for her acting but also for her contributions to music and Alzheimer’s research.\n\nPersonal and Family Life\n\nMarisa was born Maria Pierangeli and had a twin sister named Pier Angeli. She had two marriages, first to Jean-Pierre Aumont, with whom she had two children, and later to the same man again until his death in 2001. Marisa’s family background included parents Luigi Pierangeli and Enrichetta Romiti, and several nieces and nephews.\n\nCareer Highlights\n\nAlthough initially not interested in acting, Marisa was cast by director John Ford in What Price Glory? (1952). She later adopted the name Pavan, a tribute to a Jewish officer her family helped during World War II. Pavan became well-known for her support roles, especially earning an Oscar nomination for her performance in The Rose Tattoo. Despite her success, she found Hollywood unfulfilling and shifted her focus to television and theater.\n\nDeath and Legacy\n\nMarisa Pavan passed away on December 6, 2023, in Gassin, Var, France. Her legacy includes her impactful performances in film and television, as well as her work in supporting Alzheimer’s research through her organization, URMA.
