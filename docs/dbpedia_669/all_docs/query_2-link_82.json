Pavan is the twin sister of actress Pier Angeli (1932–1971), who is best known today for her ill-fated relationship with actor James Dean. Pavan is also the widow of Jean-Pierre Aumont (1911–2001), a famous stage and screen actor and writer in France and in the United States.\n\nBased on extensive interviews with Pavan herself and with various people who have known her and worked with her over the years, this book is a tribute to Pavan’s life and career, with a focus on her Hollywood years and the studio system and star system through which she had to navigate. It is part of a bigger biographical project that includes a French-English website, www.marisapavan.com."
