        "text": "Written by: Victor Malone\n\nMarisa Pavan: The Italian Actress Who Shone Bright in Hollywood\n\nMarisa Pavan is an Italian actress known for her breakout role in the 1955 film The Rose Tattoo, which earned her an Academy Award nomination and a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress. As the twin sister of film star Pier Angeli, Pavan initially gained recognition as her sibling's identical counterpart, but soon established herself as a talented actress in her own right.\n\nEarly Life and Career\n\nBorn Maria Luisa Pierangeli on June 19, 1932, in Cagliari, Sardinia, Italy, Pavan was raised alongside her fraternal twin sister Pier Angeli and younger sister Patrizia Pierangeli, who also became an actress. Growing up during World War II, the Pierangeli family hid a Jewish general in the Italian Army, and it was his surname, Pavan, that Marisa adopted as her stage name.\n\nWithout any formal dramatic training, Pavan signed a Hollywood contract with Paramount at just 19 years old. Her screen debut came in 1952 with What Price Glory, but it was her role as Anna Magnani's daughter in The Rose Tattoo three years later that catapulted her to stardom.\n\nBreakthrough and Success\n\nPavan's Oscar-nominated performance in The Rose Tattoo was originally intended for her twin sister Pier Angeli, but when Angeli became unavailable, Pavan stepped in and stole the show. This breakout role led to a string of notable films, including Diane (1956), The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit (1956), The Midnight Story (1957), and John Paul Jones (1959).\n\nShe also played Abishag in the biblical epic Solomon and Sheba (1959), and continued to work in film and television throughout the 1970s and 1980s, including appearances in A Slightly Pregnant Man (1973), Antoine and Sebastian (1974), and the miniseries The Moneychangers (1976).\n\nPersonal Life and Legacy\n\nOn March 27, 1956, Pavan married French actor Jean-Pierre Aumont in Santa Barbara, California, and the couple remained together until Aumont's passing in 2001.\n\nMarisa Pavan's remarkable career, marked by her early success and tireless work ethic, has solidified her place as a talented and enduring figure in Hollywood history. Her contributions to the film industry have inspired generations of actresses, and her legacy continues to shine bright."
