Her breakthrough came in the film The Rose Tattoo as Anna Magnani's daughter; her role was first assigned to her twin, who at the time was unable to play the part. When Magnani won the Academy Award for Best Actress, Pavan accepted on her behalf as Magnani was not present at the awards ceremony. Pavan was nominated for Best Supporting Actress, losing to Jo Van Fleet (for East of Eden). Both Magnani and Pavan won Golden Globe awards that year.\n\nAfterwards, Marisa Pavan co-starred in films such as The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit, Diane, John Paul Jones and The Midnight Story.\n\nShe married in 1956, divorced in 1963, and remarried in 1969 the French actor Jean-Pierre Aumont until his death in 2001.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Marisa Pavan, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",
