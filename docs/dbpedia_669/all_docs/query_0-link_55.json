Hudson's mystical novel Green Mansions; the studio went to the extreme of sending out photographs of Ms. Angeli dressed as the novel's Rima the Bird Girl. But when time came to film Green Mansions in 1959 Pier had long since left the MGM fold, and the role went to Audrey Hepburn. \n\tPier was briefly married to singer Vic Damone. \n\tShe died of a barbiturate overdose at the age of 39 on September 10, 1971 in Beverly Hills, California. \n\tPier Angeli was the twin sister of actress Marisa Pavan.",
