        "text": "Electronic is a blanket term used by Monstercat used to classify songs that don't fit under any other genre. Genres such as breaks or chillout were previously included under the electronic classification.\n\nThe color associated with the genre before genre colors were phased out was: Gray (Hex: #C1C1C1) (RGB: 193, 193, 193)\n\nGenres[]\n\nA capella[]\n\nA capella music is a style music that refers to a vocal performance by a singer or singer group that isn't accompanied by instruments. The term was originally created to differentiate between Renaissance polyphony and Baroque concertato, however in the 19th century, due to an ignorance of the fact that vocal parts were often doubled by instrumentalists, it stared being used to describe vocals without instruments.\n\nAcoustic[]\n\nAcoustic music, as generally classified by Monstercat, refers to vocal performances of songs backed by acoustic instruments such as the acoustic guitar or piano.\n\nBlues[]\n\nBlues is a genre of music originating from the African-American culture, of which it incorporates spirituals, work songs, field hollers, shouts, chants, and rhymed simple narrative ballads, and is characterized by the call-and-response pattern, the blues scale, and specific chord progressions.\n\nChiptune[]\n\nChiptune is a style of music created using retro or video game console sound chips, or made to sound like such. It is often heard in video game soundtracks. Chiptune is made with a small number of channels to work with, each creating a different sound wave.\n\nChoral[]\n\nChoral is a genre that is sung by a choir or chorus.\n\nElectro Funk[]\n\nElectro, or Electro Funk, refers to a genre of electronic music influenced by the use of the Roland TR-808 drum machines and funk music. Songs typically feature drum machines and heavy electronic sounds, usually without vocals, although if vocals are present they are often delivered through electronic distortion such as vocoding and talkboxing.\n\nElectro-Disco[]\n\nElectro-Disco is a style of Disco music in which disco instrumentation is largely replaced by synthesizers and augmented with futuristic elements such as the vocoder.\n\nElectronica[]\n\nWhile “Electronica” is not a “true” genre, it is used by Monstercat to label songs that are made strictly for listening, and not for dancing. With the inclusion of Monstercat Silk, the term is being used more and more. The blanket term started rising in the 1990’s, and is now mainly just being used to describe Electronic music. More can be found about the genre here.\n\nIndietronica[]\n\nA subgenre of Electronica that mixes genres such as Rock and Pop.\n\nGlitch[]\n\nGlitch is a style of experimental electronic music that uses the sounds created by malfunctioning digital technology in its composition.\n\nJazz[]\n\nJazz music is a broad style of music characterized by complex harmony, syncopated rhythms, and a heavy emphasis on improvisation. It developed from ragtime and blues music in the 20th century.\n\nNu Jazz[]\n\nNu Jazz is a combination of jazz and electronic music. Jazz samples, arrangements and instrumentation are often mixed into electronic genres such as IDM, breaks, downtempo or drum & bass.\n\nSmooth Jazz[]\n\nSmooth Jazz is a form of jazz music that is more commercially oriented and made for easy listening. It is often mixed with pop, rhythm & blues or funk music.\n\nJungle Terror[]\n\nHas the same characteristics as Big Room House but with snare/military drums performing tribal/murda rhythms and less bass to focus on the characteristic elements to the build-up for the drop. Wiwek is the most well-known artist of this genre for creating the first songs with this characterization back in 2012. In mid-2014, it gained popularity on websites like SoundCloud, turning it into something more elaborate and stable.\n\nIndie Folk[]\n\nIndie folk is a folk music genre that hybridizes the acoustic guitar melodies of traditional folk music with contemporary instrumentation.\n\nIndustrial[]\n\nIndustrial is an experimental genre described as a dark, brooding and aggressive fusion of rock, punk and electronic music. Early industrial music often featured tape editing, stark percussion and loops distorted to the point where they had degraded to harsh noise. It sought to oppose traditional rock music\n\nElectro Industrial[]\n\nElectro Industrial is a subgenre of industrial music that originated from a combination of industrial and electronic body music (EBM). Songs often use harsher beats and raspy, distorted, or digitized vocals, and avoided the use of guitars.\n\nPost-Industrial[]\n\nPost-Industrial is a subgenre of Industrial that takes Industrial and combines it with more accessible genres such as Rock and EDM.\n\nReggae[]\n\nReggae is a particular music style, strongly influenced by traditional mento as well as by American jazz & rhythm and blues, and evolved out of the earlier genres ska and rocksteady. Reggae themes usually relate to news, social gossip, and political commentary and it is recognizable from the counterpoint between the bass and drum downbeat and the offbeat rhythm section.\n\nReggaeton[]\n\nReggaeton is a style of popular and electronic music that originated in Panama during the late 1980s and later popularized in Puerto Rico. It has evolved from Dancehall, with elements of Hip Hop, Latin American, and Caribbean music. The vocals are usually in Spanish.\n\nSalsa[]\n\nSalsa music is a style of Latin American music, with Cuban, Puerto Rican and American influences. Because most of the basic musical components predate the labeling of salsa, there have been many controversies regarding its origin. Most songs considered as salsa are primarily based on Son montuno and Son Cubano, with elements of Guaracha, Cha-cha-chá, Danzón, Descarga, Bolero, Guajira, Rumba, Mambo, Jazz, Funk, R&B, Rock, Bomba, and Plena.\n\nSoul[]\n\nSoul is a popular music genre that has its roots in African-American gospel music and rhythm and blues.
