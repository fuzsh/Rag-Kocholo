        "text": "A roaring hour from one of the most vital talents in Naarm: First Nations producer Paul Gorrie, AKA DJ PGZ. The Gunai/Kurnai and Yorta Yorta artist is a fixture of forward-thinking dance music in Australia, with releases on labels like Butter Sessions, Pure Space and !K7, as well as numerous club and festival gigs on the circuit. An international breakout moment now feels inevitable.\n\nThere's much to be said about the lack of visibility and support for Indigenous artists within the global electronic ecosystem (we'll be publishing more on this soon), but at the root of all PGZ's disparate interests are community building and the advancement of marginalised peoples.\n\nTo that end, DJ PGZ's RA Podcast is notably laced with multiple cuts from Nene H's Gaza fundraising compilation. It's distinctly freshâthe oldest track you'll find is from 2022âas he gallops through Kalahari-style wigged-out prog and techno, through to harder drum syncopations. Consider this a firm tip from us: PGZ is the truth.\n\n@dj-pgz\n\nRead more at ra.co/podcast/949\n\n\"If someone from Detroit wins, it's another win for Detroit.\" The duo discuss their longtime roots in the Motor City and how their work has evolved after more than 30 years in the game.\n\nTo commemorate August 8th, we're featuring an interview with the Detroit duo AUX88. Tommy HamiltonâAKA TOMTOMâand William âBJâ SmithâAKA POSATRONIXâare pioneers celebrating 35 years in the music industry, known for their work combining elements of ghetto tech, Kraftwerk-indebted techno and Miami bass. Their sound has remained consistent throughout the decades, and their influence on club music extends far and deep.\n\nIn this Exchange, RA editor Nyshka Chandran interviews the duo live from Detroit earlier this year, where they discuss their trajectory in the scene. They started out playing at local businesses, they recallâflower shops, coffee shops, cabarets and strip clubsâsometimes to no more than three people. They also unpack their creative setup and why their music has and always will be indebted to futurism and sci-fi. The duo turn their attention to the present. AUX 88 just released an EP called ALPHA WAVES and are starting a new label that will help champion local artists. In their words: \"If someone from Detroit wins, it's another win for Detroit.\" Listen to the episode in full.\n\nSpeedy percussion meets screwface basslines: the Parisian club maestros are in session.\n\nTrying to find one word to describe the music of Amor Satyr and Siu Mata could run you into difficulty. But if we were to try, we'd reach for amphibian: slippery, nimble and evading borders with ease.\n\nWith solo and shared releases on labels like SSPB, HARDLINE, TraTraTrax and their own WAJANG, they have evident kinship with what moves contemporary dance floors. The pair are also linked to the rise of an alchemical style they like to call \"speed dembow\"âtaking the looping rhythm of dembow before pitching it up to modern club tempos and adding muscle.\n\nCombining tribal techno, baile funk, dubstep, jungle, dancehall and beyond, their RA Podcast makes for one hell of a ride, with over two hours of romping percussion, lysergic effects, high drama and plenty of wobble.\n\n@amorsatyr @siumata\n\nRead more at ra.co/podcast/948\n\n\"The first time I heard a Moog, it blew my mind.\" The esteemed neoclassical composer talks about his long standing love of synthesisers and his forthcoming album, In A Landscape.\n\nGerman-born British composer Max Richter has led the vanguard for post-minimalist classical music. His work has soundtracked major film and TV, ballets, runway shows and exhibitions globally. He also gained recognition for Sleepâan eight-and-a-half-hour-long concept album written around the neuroscience of the sleeping brainâwhich he's performed regularly to crowds of sleeping people, including at Berlin venue Kraftwerk.\n\nWhile Richter has garnered widespread acclaim for his classical compositions, his original source of inspiration was electronic music. In this Exchange, recorded at his home and studio in Oxford, England, he recalled discovering Kraftwerk while watching a travel show as a teenager. He quickly began designing and building his own synthesisers after that, enamoured by the sound of the filter on the Moog, which remains one of his favourite instruments and go-to tools.\n\nRichter, who went through rigorous classical training, rejected the genre's orthodoxy, inaccessibility and view of the \"composer as master.\" His work challenges the conventions around this school of music, appealing to a broader audience through his deconstructed compositional style, which he continues to explore in his forthcoming album, In A Landscape, out on September 6th. Listen to the episode in full.\n\nWhat does great techno sound like in 2024? Enter LYDO. This week's RA Podcast captures @lydole in full flow, combining the old-school vernacular of European and North American technoâreduced rhythms, hi-hats and punchy 909sâwith tracks from the new guard (Sev Dah, GiGi FM, D.Dan) sprinkled throughout.\n\nAfter moving to New York in 2015, the Vietnamese-American sound artist and X-XTRA.SERVICES founder became one of BASEMENT's first residents; the scene built around the revered Queens club has helped nurture their adventurous sound. Lately they've been making waves beyond North America, playing with the MARICAS crew in Barcelona and locking down slots at De School, Bassiani and Draaimolen.\n\nRA.947 is the sound of artful hypnosis: it's techno with elegance, depth and just the right amount of thump. Rig this up on a proper system, turn off the lights and any worriesâabout the genre's direction of travel, or otherwiseâmight melt away.\n\nRead more at https://ra.co/podcast/947\n\n\"Soundscapes reveal a lot about how people think and behave.\" The field recordist and musician talks about listening culture, repatriating African sounds and his new album with The Bug.\n\nToday's conversation moves away from the dance floor, focusing instead on the soft, ambient soundscapes of the Berlin-based musician Joseph KamaruâAKA KMRUâwhose work has been featured at festivals like CTM, Mutek, Atonal, Horst Music and Arts, Dekmantel, and Unsound; concert halls like The Barbican; and major galleries and site-specific installations around the world.\n\nKamaru moved to Europe from Nairobi, where he first became interested in music production, and field recordings specifically. As a graduate student in the sonic arts, he learned that the majority of the discourse around sound art practices is specific to Western Eurocentric or occidental ways of thinking. He's since embarked on a mission to use field recording as a means of repatriating African identities that are often left out of institutional archives and grapple with the legacy of colonialism.\n\nIn this RA Exchange, Kamaru reflects on the sociopolitical angle of his work, and his observation that listening, by its very nature, is never neutral. He also talks about how civilisation and technology has changed our collective listening habits; how sound sources beyond the human hearing range make their way into his work with the use of electromagnetic microphones; and his new album, Disconnect, made with the musician Kevin Richard Martin (AKA The Bug).
