        "text": "You could write a lengthy essay about the Slits’ landmark LP Cut based on the semiotics of its cover alone. Three young women stand wearing only loincloths in a Surrey rose garden – a sight to delight any shock-marketing executive. But they are covered almost entirely in mud, possessing the unmistakable attitude of warriors; the aesthetic much closer to National Geographic than lad mag. Titillation is not on offer, a fight might be.\n\nThis perhaps accounts for the album’s relatively comfortable passage into the world. While Never Mind the Bollocks’s mild cuss word had prompted an obscenity trial – they were primmer times – no such bother attended Cut when it reached shops in 1979, despite its multiple provocations.\n\nThis week’s rerelease has, however sparked controversy, in the form of a fan-led petition that has won more than 5,000 signatures, calling for Island Records to write off an alleged debt which would allow the band to receive royalties for Cut. So far both parties are avoiding saying much publicly.\n\nThe album – which is reissued on rather pointlessly purple vinyl on this occasion – remains an inflammatory document, far beyond label contracts and its cover. Thanks to its incendiary music, even after 37 years retains its power to rouse your inner delinquent. With Ari aged 17 and the others not much older, its songs lay out a set of frustrations – such as the choking stereotypes of femininity in Typical Girls, or disappointing boyfriends on Ping Pong Affair – all of which could almost spring from Brill-Building era Carole King.\n\nIf an all-girl rock band remains, ridiculously, a relatively rare thing, it was still next to unthinkable in the late 70s, so the Slits were taking up a radical stance before they played a note. Rock music was a boys’ game, and Viv Albertine writes about the uncomfortable disdain in music shops when she went to buy her first guitar in her book Clothes, Clothes, Clothes. Music, Music, Music. Boys, Boys, Boys. The aim on Cut was to play something as unfamiliar as its personnel.\n\nThe Slits had been part of the collective, chaotic ‘No!’ of the punk era, frightening even some of the era’s most alarming figures with their gleefully obnoxious antics. Led mostly by singer Ari Up, such incidents saw the group nearly thrown off the White Riot tour bus with the Clash.\n\nReleased in 1979, as wilfully amateur, clashing guitars had begun to seem an exhausted gesture, Cut retained the defiant attitudes but moved on to more adventurous sonics. Almost from the off, Jamaican music had been the preferred listening of the bands making their reputation with shouty noise. The Slits were among the first to try absorbing that influence fully into their own music.\n\nTo this end, producer Dennis Bovell – known for both echoing, bass-heavy dub and pretty Jamaican pop tunes such as Janet Kay’s Silly Games – came in to produce. Budgie, the Liverpool drummer who went on to join the Banshees, added tumbling beats which carried a fair load of punky menace smartly enough to work in one-drop stylings.\n\nIt’s not a mix that ought to work, but the gleeful willingness to have a go that drove the best of punk carries this along. And it did open on to fresh possibilities: if it were possible to blend scratchy guitars with heavy, spacey bass and clattering drums and make heady pop music, any number of influences might be combined without standard chops. You could argue that other post-punks who followed – Culture Club, for instance – got their nerve up listening to Cut, as well as their obvious successors in the riot grrrl movement.\n\nWith songs including a merry celebration of Shoplifting (“10 quid for the lot / We pay fuck all …. Do a runner!”) it’s a record that invites trouble. Thirty-seven years on, its provocations do not seem exhausted."
