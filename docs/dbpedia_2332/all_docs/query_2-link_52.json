        "text": "For this month of November, Diggers Factory has concocted a selection of favorites for you!\n\nWe are keeping up the momentum with some great surprises for the month of November. Let's start by offering you the chance to discover - or rediscover - the virtuosity of Herbie Hancock in his legendary album \"Takin' Off\". Then we offer you a delicious blend of sunshine and French Touch with the debut EP \"Velour\" by Darius. The November rock project will be none other than the recording of Guns N' Roses' live performance in New York City in 1988 (red vinyl). Next, we suggest the fine blend of folk, rock and new wave of Hen Yanni's debut EP \"Where do we go? Reggae dub makes a comeback in the main selection with a project entitled \"New Bladerunners Of Dub\" produced by the duo Jed Smith & Paul Zasky. Our selection also features a fusion of electronic music, haunting melodies and personal lyrics by the magnificent Kacy Hill in her latest project, \"Is it Selfish If We Talk About Me Again\". And to round off this selection on a high note with the Collector's Project, we are offering you the chance to receive a pack including Mezerg's latest project entitled \"Extended Play\", as well as the project's poster and pins! We'll let you have a look ‚¨áÔ∏è\n\nüé∂üíøAlways find over 150 other vinyl records in the expanded selection! üíøüé∂ COLLECTOR PROJECT: MEZERG - Extended Play - Exclusive pack (Vinyl, Poster & Pins)\n\nMezerg, originally from Bordeaux (France), began his career in music at the age of 19 at the Bordeaux Conservatoire, then went on to study at the University of Paris-Est Marne-la-Vall√©e. In 2016, he played the piano in a Bordeaux tramway during the self-produced \"Festival sur les rails\". The following year, he hitchhiked from Bordeaux to Hungary with his piano to perform at the Sziget Festival. He then began to make a name for himself in the media.\n\n\"Piano Boom Boom\" is the term the artist uses to describe his music: a fusion of techno and electronic music based on keyboards, synthesizers, pianos and sometimes a theremin. As a one-man band, he controls the rhythm with his feet (bass drum, snare drum, cymbals), and the harmonies and bass with the keyboards. In 2022, he won an award at the Music Moves Europe Awards during his world tour of North America and Europe. Mezerg is a bold, forward-thinking artist who captivates international audiences with his musical creativity.\n\nHis latest project, \"Extended Play\", brings to close a cycle dominated by live electronics, and marks a return to acoustic. The EP's six tracks move from groove to more cinematic ambience, symbolizing a retro-futuristic hybridization of jazz, synthesizers and solo piano. \"This is my first release really thought out as a set of tracks,\" admits Mezerg proudly. A beautiful EP like an extended game, like an extension of Mezerg's game, to be discovered in the Vinyl Box.\n\nONLY 5 COPIES IN THE SELECTION Herbie Hancock - Takin' Off\n\nHerbie Hancock is an internationally renowned American jazz pianist, born on April 12, 1940, in Chicago. He is widely celebrated for his remarkable career spanning several decades, during which he pushed the boundaries of jazz and explored various musical genres. Hancock is famous for his virtuosity on the piano, constant innovation, and significant influence on jazz and contemporary music.\n\nThe album \"Takin' Off\" is a cornerstone in Herbie Hancock's career. Recorded in 1962, this release marks his debut as a bandleader and showcases his talent as a jazz composer and performer. The album is iconic for its standout composition, \"Watermelon Man,\" which has become a jazz standard. \"Takin' Off\" helped propel Hancock onto the international jazz scene and served as an inspiration for generations of musicians. This recording highlights Hancock's piano virtuosity and foreshadows his long and prolific career characterized by experimentation and innovation.\n\nDarius - Velour\n\nDarius, also known as Terence N'Guyen, is a prominent figure in the electronic music scene. He's celebrated for his knack for releasing sophisticated club tracks on Roche Musique and collaborating with notable artists like Wayne Snow. While his recent work has gained significant attention, especially his latest EP ‚ÄúOasis‚Äù, it's worth revisiting his early days in 2012 when he self-released the album \"Velour\" in a digital format.\n\n\"Velour\" is an album that captures a distinct French touch spirit, which goes a long way in explaining its widespread popularity. Within its groovy compositions, Darius expertly caresses samples, creating a musical landscape that has the power to part the clouds and let the sunshine through, regardless of the time of year. This album has not only stood the test of time but has also contributed significantly to Darius's reputation as an innovative and influential artist in the electronic music realm.\n\nNew Bladerunners Of Dub - New Blade Runners Of Dub\n\nImmerse yourself in the groundbreaking musical landscape of Zasky & Smith, the dynamic duo behind the innovative project known as ‚Äúthe New Blade Runners Of Dub‚Äù.

With notable collaborations featuring Grammy winner Lee Scratch Perry, David Lynch, and Ari Up, they've been a driving force in the Dub and Reggae scene.\n\n‚ÄúThe New Blade Runners Of Dub‚Äù unite Europe and America, forging an innovative rhythmic journey for a new generation. Their music transcends borders, reflecting a new era of art, communication, and politics, decoding the future that lies ahead. This is the sound of the 21st century, a testament to the unity and creativity of Zasky & Smith.\n\nHen Yanni - Where do we go?\n\nBorn in 1983 in Israel's northern district, Hen Yanni is a multi-talented artist.

Both tracks are featured on the album we have selected for you. Guns N' Roses are also known for their breathtaking live performances, blending raw energy with unforgettable melodies.\n\nDespite changes in line-up and periods of hiatus, Guns N' Roses remain an essential name in rock, continuing to captivate fans the world over with their iconic music and rebellious attitude, which you'll have the opportunity to discover, or rediscover, in this live performance in New York City from 1988.\n\nKacy Hill - Is it Selfish If We Talk About Me Again\n\nKacy Hill, a versatile artist with an enchanting voice, quickly conquered the music world thanks to her exceptional talent and artistic singularity.
