        "text": "\"Music is never a fixed thing. There are always new techniques, new sounds, new plug-ins being used — new ways to produce music.\"\n\nHow often do you create your own sounds, as opposed to using pre-existing samples or patches?\n\nFor synths, it’s about 50/50, using pre-existing banks or creating our own patches. We record a lot of real instruments, too.The title track from Intense, for example, featured Miri Ben-Ari on violin. I had finished the track with a MIDI violin part and went to New York to record Miri there in Pro Tools. Then we took the raw files and finished the project in Logic back here at my home studio in Leiden, Holland. To finish things up, all of the files then went back to New York for mastering at The Lodge.\n\nOne of your longest standing collaborations is with producer Benno de Goeij (Rank 1, Jochen Miller). Can you describe your workflow when you’re tracking and mixing together?\n\nBenno is a good friend. When we’re working together, we often start with a vocal or melody idea, or another track that has a good sound that we want to recreate. I do most of my work in Logic Pro X and, within that, I love the possibilities for using MIDI.\n\nHow does your choice of Logic Pro X for your DAW affect your and Benno’s workflow?\n\nWhat I love about Logic Pro X is that you can import channel strips, including MIDI and bus routing. The way Benno and I work is, everything is hooked up to an old Apple server upstairs from my studio. That houses all of my samples and it’s fast enough that I can work from one server and have two projects open and streaming from it at the same time. Then Benno and I can each open the same project and, search for bass lines, import entire channel strips with MIDI or audio information, automation, or whatever, and efficiently combine our ideas.\n\nHow do you guys monitor during these sessions?\n\nWe like to have one of us on headphones at one DAW, and the other sitting on the main PA checking out a mix, working on a mixdown, or arranging another track. Both DAWs have the same settings, so it’s easy to open all projects in both DAWs. It’s heaven working like this. We usually route everything through buses — one for kick, one for bass, one for synth leads, one for vocals, one for effects. We do that to create headroom in the mix. You don’t want your leads to go above -10dB, and you don’t want your kick above -10dB either.\n\nWhen you mix, do you compress the master bus?\n\nFor our own reference, we make a full version that we’ve compressed the hell out of it to make it sound really loud. When we send a track out for mastering, however, we give them a non-compressed, non-limited version that has headroom of at least 6 dB. That way, the mastering engineer can still add EQ and effects and have some space to play with. The loud reference mixes we make for ourselves are very useful for me on the road. As a DJ, I play every weekend, and those mixes are perfect for road-testing my tracks. That’s a golden rule — even if it’s just a draft of a track — if there’s something wrong with an arrangement, you will hear it on the dance floor.\n\nThe kick is such an important part of dance music. How do you craft yours?\n\nI recently got into the Xfer Nerve software drum machine, which lets you combine sounds to make your own kick drum. Usually, we take the top of an existing kick drum and add our own low end, which is often just a synth filling out the oomph that we need. Then we put a compressor on there to make the kick drum more snappy, to help it blend, and to make the sound whole."
