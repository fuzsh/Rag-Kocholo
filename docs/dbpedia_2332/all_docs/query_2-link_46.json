Kick Ass Remastered (2004)\n\nBeginnings is a collection of &quot;classic&quot; Digital Droo music. These songs were created in the late nineties and early 2000s. This was before the proliferation of software synthesizers and samples, when we actually had to plug the output of these boxes into an input jack of a computer. In fact, many of the songs on Beginnings were recorded using the 1/8&quot; jack in a Macintosh computer clone.\r\n\r\nMany of these songs were written specifically for a Macintosh Magazine CD-ROM and were made to loop endlessly. As such, these songs were short and had unnaturally abrupt endings. Many years after the original release, the songs were massaged a bit to be self-contained and enjoyed outside the context of the Mac CD-ROM.\r\n\r\nMost of these songs were compiled for release on CD by MP3.com, under the title, The MacAddict Years. Since MP3.com ceased to be (in its then current form), this music has not been available for download. Well, now it is.\r\n\r\nI hope you enjoy it!\r\n\r\n-Andrew, Digital Droo",

His music first appeared on a Macintosh enthusiast magazine's monthly CD-ROM and has gained a small, but loyal following. In later years, the music has been licensed for use in television programs and commercials and continues to be used today.\n\nOh, and Digital Droo created a viral remix called \"Monkey Developers.\" ... more"
