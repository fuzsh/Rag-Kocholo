        "text": "John Lydon’s wife Nora Forster has died at the age of 80 after a long battle with Alzheimer’s. Forster’s daughter Ari Up lead singer of The Slits tragically passed away in October 2010 of cancer.\n\nJohn’s official Twitter page announced the news this afternoon, writing: “Rest in Peace Nora Forster. It is with a heavy heart that we share the sad news that Nora Forster – John Lydon’s wife of nearly 5 decades – has passed away.\n\n“Nora had been living with Alzheimer’s for several years. In which time John had become her full time carer.”\n\n“Please respect John’s grief and allow him space. Rest in Peace Nora. Heart felt condolences to John from Rambo and all at PiL Official.”\n\nJohn spoke of Nora’s illness in our interview early last year.\n\nWe have a small favour to ask.
