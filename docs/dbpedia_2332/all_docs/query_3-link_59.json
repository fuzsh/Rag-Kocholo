        "text": "Category Archives: Podcasts\n\nVakula\n\nMuch like his richly atmospheric and often deeply contemplative studio masterstrokes, a Vakula DJ set is an experience in every sense of the word. A musical storyteller at his very core, the Ukrainian artist has spent the last decade sharing his vision with open minded dancers around the world, creating memorable moments with records ranging from pure techno, dub techno, deep house, jazz, funk, disco, psychedelic rock or whatever his limitless imagination dictates at that moment. With two new Vakula albums nearing release and an Australian tour currently underway, we’ve managed to secure a very special episode from the man himself. Recorded at Shelter Amsterdam just last month, we see him move from disco to Afro to techno, Italo, electro and soulful house with absolute ease, building into some moments of pure euphoria. Jump in and enjoy the ride with Vakula in full flight!\n\nI see you’ve been keeping a pretty busy schedule playing in Europe regularly over the past few months.. what have been some of your favourite memories?\n\nHey hey, It is always difficult to talk about something highlighting the best. But I liked the last two parties in The Netherlands a lot. One of them was at the club Shelter in Amsterdam, where this mix was recorded.\n\nI remember seeing a photo of your studio a while ago and trying to imagine your creative process with so much incredible gear at your disposal… in recent times it sounds as though you’ve been focussed on developing your skills with live instruments..? How have you enjoyed that process, and what instruments are you currently playing on your varying productions?\n\nYes it’s true. I have a lot of musical instruments including live drums, guitars, percussions, drum machines, samplers and a lot of synthesizers. I probably do not have any favorite instrument that I spend more time with. I like everything. I love the sound. Recently I bought Buchla System 200 perhaps at the moment I spend the most time on it to learn and understand the function of each module and I very much enjoy it. Musical instruments and their timbres provide a great field for development in different genres. It’s hard for me to imagine an idea made on one musical instrument for it sounds dry.\n\nWhen the party is over I can not wait to get back to the studio.\n\nAs the title of your 2013 selected works LP suggests, many fans of your music would never have been to or experienced your hometown of Konotop, and you’ve spoken before about a kind of ‘wild realness’ that is yet to be fully discovered there… can you elaborate on this and how it continues to inspire your music today?\n\nI am sure that every human in the soul has his own Konotop. I love my city despite possible shortcomings such as the lack of an airport and a distant location from the capital. When I create music, listening to it becomes complete if I can imagine the landscapes of my native city.\n\nI hear you have a two new albums nearing release, including the Metaphors LP due out on your Leleka label… what can you tell us about these two records and when might we expect to hear them?\n\nYes, I finished two albums one of which is techno and will be published on the Moscow label Arma. It’s the first time I decided on the publication of techno under the name Vakula. I do not want to stop continuing to develop myself in different musical genres. The second album is called ‘Metaphors’, it will be published on my own label Leleka and yes, there will be more music for my soul as it combines many experiments in combination with Marimbas and synthesizers such as Buchla Easel etc.\n\nWhat can you tell us about the mix?\n\nThis mix was recorded at the club Shelter in Amsterdam where I played next to San Soda and Tako. I think it very well describes and reflects me as a DJ and an artist. I think that you just have to listen to it for your body and soul and I hope this does not leave you indifferent.\n\nI know you’re coming back to Australia to play a couple of shows this week, where can people catch you play?\n\nWell this time I’m playing:\n\nFriday 9 June – Adelaide, Sugar Nightclub, at the amazing Driller Armstrong party.\n\nSaturday 10 June – Perth, Freedom Time for Ben and I’m super excited about this one.\n\nFriday 16 June – Sydney – Peoples Club with my brother Karim\n\nSaturday 17 June – Melbourne, Charades at The Bottom End with my brow Nergal\n\nLooking forward to that!\n\nPeace,\n\nV\n\nRoza Terenzi\n\nShifting gears last year to resettle in Melbourne after carefully honing her sound and performing around the country as Catlips, former Perth local Katie Campbell’s latest musical conception marks her transition from the lounge to the rave, a new direction and a new outlet for the plethora of experimental sounds currently making her tick. Showcasing some of the sounds driving the new Roza Terenzi alter ego, Katie takes us on a wild ride through the murky underbelly of electro, 90s techno, rave, jungle, breakbeat, ambient and dubbed out house.\n\nKatie! How are you? You made the big move over to Melbourne from Perth not all that long ago, what was behind the move and how have you been settling in?\n\nSup mate, I am great thanks. Yeah, after a few years of coming over to play I decided it was time to make the move. I love Perth but it’s time for something new! Been settling in really nicely so far, I have always loved this city and it’s been really easy to adjust to call it home.\n\nFor the last few years you were making music and performing under a different alias… tell us about this new chapter, how does Roza Terenzi differ musically and what kind of sounds have inspired this latest project?\n\nI guess I started producing tracks under my old alias Catlips about five years ago and spent most of that time experimenting, learning how to produce, and just throwing stuff out there. I decided it was time to start with something new because my production has developed quite a bit over those years, and now is finally at a point where I’m actually closer to making the sound I want to be outputting. This project has a much more focused vibe in terms of my tracks and also my DJ sets, which although share some similar elements to my older stuff, are definitely more focused around the club.\n\nYou have a forthcoming record due out on the consistently brilliant Perth label Good Company Records, what can we be expecting from your debut R.Terenzi EP?\n\nYep! I guess my first release is made up of stuff that was the first real acknowledgement of a new project for me. I made the tracks end of 2015/start of 2016 so I’m really stoked to see them finally coming out. Weird house, field recordings, electro breaksy kind of thing, a little different to what I’m making now but still relevant to where I’m at. It also features a remix from Jayda G, using elements from the other three tracks!\n\nTell us about this mix you’ve put together for us… what are some of the records in there we should keep an ear out for?\n\nThis mix is basically a mash of everything I’ve been listening to and playing out at the moment, and I guess what usually influences me when I make music. An overload of genres… house, electro, breaks, experimental, trance, ambient, techno, jungle.. I don’t know call it whatever you want, I feel like all the tracks come together with a similar kind of bleepy/90’s aesthetic which is pretty much at the core of everything I like. I’d keep an ear out for the real ravey/bleepy electro stuff 2/3rd of the way in..but there are some unreleased tracks from Rory McPike, D.Tiffany and myself to scope out too.\n\nWhat else is coming up?\n\nA few great DJ shows supporting Legowelt, Lipelis and Vakula in Melbourne, a trip to Vancouver in August and more music releases which you can find out about soon!\n\nCooper Saver\n\nAfter launching his party and mixtape series Far Away back in 2012, Cooper Saver has slowly but surely made a name for himself by throwing the best underground parties in Los Angeles, combining unique spaces with proper sound to host formidable guests like Floating Points, Four Tet, Daphni and Ben UFO on the regular. Now the party is into its fifth year and well and truly established, he’s been busy sharing the love abroad, with recent stints in Europe, Australia, Canada, Tel Aviv, plus a Far Away special in Tijuana, Mexico.\n\nHey Cooper how’s things? I see you just got back from a little European tour… what were the highlights?\n\nThings are good! I’m in recovery mode so just chilling hard. Some highlights include losing my luggage on the flight over, playing in Tel Aviv for the first time, getting my luggage back, returning to London and Berlin, seeing all the homies – good times all around.\n\nYour clubnight Far Away seems to just be going from strength to strength, and appears kind of unparalleled in LA in terms of the acts you’re consistently bringing out. Can you give us a little bit of the backstory of the night, and where you see it sitting within the current LA party scene in a broader sense…?\n\nFar Away is all about finding a unique space and transforming it into a special venue for one night only, and giving guest DJs the room to play a set they normally wouldn’t be able to. The bookings lately are mainly returning guests that we can trust to play all night long (6+ hour sets) – keeps it in the family that way too.\n\nThe current LA party scene, especially within the underground community, is growing quite rapidly. There’s so much happening these days with very few venues and it’s super tough to keep up. I like to think we’ve carved out our own vibe and sound in a way. A lot of my friends who throw parties here have done that for themselves too. So I think if everyone is offering something unique and expanding the audience, then we’re sitting in a good zone within the local scene. Fingers crossed we can keep doing this for many more years to come, given the endless challenges the city puts against us.\n\nYour own music has begun popping up a little bit more often over the last year with a bunch of remixes for labels like DFA and Let’s Play House. Where are you at with it currently? Can we expect to hear some original bits at some stage this year?\n\nMaybe the EP will be finished before I turn 60. Nah, now that I’m home for a while I should finally have some of the original stuff wrapped up soon. I slowed down on remixing to make time for this, but being on the road most of the year up until now certainly didn’t help. Going to get it in these next couple months though!\n\nThis mix really is an epic journey… was that the idea when you approached it or did it just naturally progress that way? What are some things that we should keep an ear out for?\n\nA little bit of both. I recently played a similar set at Tresor in Berlin and I wanted to recreate a few of those moments in this mix. So I just added to a handful of records that I came home with and basically winged it. I don’t want to spoil anything but I will say I was happy to include the latest from Skee Mask on Ilian Tape. Also the new one from Aussie heroes Sleep D & Albrecht La’Brooy is fantastic. Ibon’s record on Ectotherm pitched down -10% or so. Avalon Emerson’s dreamy remix of Slowdive.\n\nWhat else is coming up?\n\nI have a pretty mellow summer this year – taking a break from parties, gigs, and heavy traveling to just chill out and work on tunes with friends. We have a couple tape new releases coming out under the Far Away cassette label real soon – next up is a recording of Pender Street Steppers & Beautiful Swimmers from when they played for us last year.\n\nI’ll be opening for Prins Thomas here in LA on June 9th, b2b with Honey Soundsystem, which should be a lot of fun…one of the only things I have planned this summer so far. Touring again in the fall. Disco edit 12” with my friend Patrick out on Common Edit this year. That’s about it for now!\n\nFlørist\n\nHaving had the pleasure of hosting his first show in Melbourne last year, it was pretty clear to us that there’s something in the freezing water in Vancouver at the minute. Logan Sturrock aka Flørist is one of the latest of a string of Vancouver based artists to break through, sharing his dreamy house with the world through familiar favourites like All Caps, Pacific Rhythm and the new World Building imprint – labels that are constantly unearthing fresh talent from the Pacific North West and beyond. With the desolate Canadian winter having recently drawn to a close and the sun finally shining, Flørist provides the perfect soundtrack to a changing of the seasons.\n\nHey Logan, what’s been happening in sunny Vancouver?\n\nHeya! Today is actually sunny! The winter has been long and miserable, but because of all the snow and rain, the plants are blooming and it’s beautiful. The chill has left the breeze and the birds sing all day. I have been hibernating for the past few months while working on some new things, playing a few shows around the PNW region (Pacific North West) and planning out the rest of 2017.\n\nSpeaking of sunny Vancouver, RA recently described your latest record for Pacific Rhythm as ‘the sound of an overcast summer’. What can you tell us about that cheekily named Dvote and how it came about?\n\nHaha, yes. That sound. I’m interested about how in gospel house music the lyrics can be interpreted as either about love / devotion to a higher power or to someone or something else. It’s insane to think how much “Show Me Love” has been flipped and remixed and how the original is still such an amazing song. I think that is a testament to its versatility – how it can be heard in a number of ways without being any one thing in particular. All the best things in life are like that. Shout out to Robin S!\n\nYour latest full EP Windows On The World arrived as the second release on Ari Goldman’s new label World Building via a new alias of yours. How would you describe your V. Rosso alter ego, and what was the general idea behind this little gem of a record?\n\nOh man. Well I was just playing with layering different influences and references. V. Rosso is like another layer. I always think it’s funny when you get a record that says something like “DJ Whoever presents Project X” and it’s just the same producer. I never understood making some alias project for yourself that’s so closely related in style and then still giving your original alias credit. The title Windows On The World is reference to a restaurant that doesn’t exist anymore. If you search for it online you can find out more. Pretty fascinating. All the tracks are based around references to New York, Detroit and Italo House sounds and how we can never go back in time. lol. But art is like time travelling so whatever. It was really cool working with Ari. He has a great sense of humour.\n\nHow did you approach this mix, and what are some of the hidden treasures we might find in there?\n\nI just pressed record and tried not to think because I always over think things. Speaking of aliases there’s a Chiapet track in there that I really enjoy. All the records are quite easy to find. Look out for that Bossa Nova track on Moontown!\n\nWhat’s coming up next for Westside Flørist?\n\nWhats next… In my immediate future I’m playing a few shows overseas in May and June and planning my relocation to Glasgow for a little while. I feel at home there. Terrible weather. Beyond that stuff just continuing my lifelong search for the most exotic dance floors in the world – get in touch if you hear of anything spicy.\n\nJenifa Mayanja\n\nThe latest addition arrives by way of Connecticut based Berlin regular Jenifa Mayanja, an East Coast DJ and producer who has been infusing her African roots with a distinctive soulful vision since the early 90s. Earning the praise and mentorship from legendary house figures like Joe Claussell as an up-and-coming artist, Mayanja is now behind a series of ‘organic deep house’ labels, such as Bu-Mako, Sound Warrior and the label she runs alongside husband Jus-Ed, EDJ Records. Known for consistently dishing up soul filled dance floor journeys of the highest order, her latest offering via the Bass Cadet Records’ Orbits series is currently doing the rounds, and she’s taken the time to offer us a deep selection, carefully packed with that familiar East Coast spirit.\n\nHey Jenifa, what’s been happening? I hear you and Ed recently hosted your second ‘Zuflucht’ party at Berlin’s Loftus Hall, featuring special guest Move D and the legendary Elbee Bad on live percussion. What can you tell us about the idea behind the party, and how did the first one go down?\n\nHey there, the party was our way of introducing and ultimately doing our part to grow the house community in Berlin with spreading house music culture, knowledge and community spirit that we are familiar with from the East Coast. Our parties are a success when we are able to break people out of their familiar ideas of “clubbing” and instead treat this time with us an experience with the potential to help you release stress, freedom to interact with people in an environment that respects you as you come, an opportunity to encounter people that you may not normally engage with, and maybe even gain some new musical knowledge. The party was a great success in these ways and we are hopeful more people in Berlin gravitate to what we are offering with “Zuflucht” -Refuge.\n\nWe brought as much as we could spiritually to create the kind of parties we have experienced on the East Coast as dancers and promoters. Elbee Bad brought his special vibe with his son on percussion, there was some free food as is tradition, some sensory stimulations in the form of incense oils, and original artwork to transform the space done by our resident opening DJ Radio Hobo, I think we are adding something meaningful to the dance scene in Berlin.\n\nYour latest record marked the second chapter for the Bass Cadet Records’ sub-label Orbits, following on from Ron Trent’s timeless first up offering for the series. You’ve mentioned that you wrote the record with the label’s musical vision in mind… did Ron’s EP or his output more generally help to inspire the soulful direction of these tracks?\n\nI was honored to contribute to Orbits as Etienne and Laura from Bass Cadet have been supporters of me as an artist. This was the guidance as a creative person to be able to give back and do something that was worthy of their label. My inspiration was knowing they have great music taste and my contribution should be a release that would be timeless and collectible.\n\nI quite enjoyed reading your ‘Mentors’ piece on the artistic lessons you learned from Joe Claussell back in the 90s while working at his NYC record store Dance Tracks. I can imagine the experience you had would resonate with any young artist dealing with how to accept feedback on their work, while also trusting their own instincts. What would be your major piece of advice for young producers trying to have their own artistic voices heard today?\n\nI would tell any young producer to literally sequester themselves for a while in a remote location (not literally) and just spend a year just making music without the intention of releasing of it! That would be ideal just so they could grow creatively. Of course that is not practical! So the best advice in my humble opinion – at least during the time you are actively working on a project – is to listen to any other kind of music other than what you are making. I say this only so you give yourself the space to find your true sound as a producer/artist. This I say only for those really in the early stages of starting out with production, so you can come up with something that is true to yourself.\n\nIt seems as though your label Bu-Mako Recordings had a little hiatus last year after consistently releasing music from yourself and likeminded friends since back in 2007.. What future plans do you have for the label, and can we expect any new Bu-Mako material from yourself again in 2017?\n\nThe label didn’t actually go on a hiatus, just output slowed down to a crawl because of the pressing situation in the states. Also I was releasing musical projects with other like minded labels like deepArtSounds. I was also busy with my other two labels Sound Warrior – which releases music exclusively by female producers, and EDJ records which releases music only by myself and hubby Jus-Ed.\n\nHowever I am ramping things up with my long overdue third album ‘what a strange dream’. I have been working on and off it for at least a year and a half. I’m working on releasing an album from my artist Denis Clifford on Bumako. I also have some upcoming releases on Sistrum and another mini LP on deepArtSounds.\n\nWhat can you tell us about this mix you’ve put together for us? Who are some of the artists that feature in the mix?\n\nI can tell you that I had quite a good time putting this mix together. I was aiming for a timeless mix that you cannot date because the music sounds right whenever you hear it. There was actually not too many brand new artists or tracks with the exception of one my tracks on Orbits. There is some Joe Claussell in there, Bittersuite, Ed & Jen and some old skool jams like Kurtis Blow.\n\nWhat else is coming up?\n\nIt’s quite an exciting time for me. I have my first artist CDR session where I get to talk about what I do as an artist as well premiere some tracks from my album. That is March 23rd in Berlin. We also have another ‘Zuflucht’ party April 1st at Loftus Hall, this time with special guest Lawrence. A special RBMA mix in April. I also have some nice upcoming gigs that I’m looking forward to… In addition my other labor of love Sound Warrior Records is releasing a 2×12″ vinyl in April, it’s a compilation featuring some incredible women like Aurora Halal, Cherushii (RIP), Daniela La Luz, Lilith, Lady Fingers, CMD, newcomer Avalele and myself.\n\nAnthony Naples\n\nJust in time for his latest visit of our large island, Proibito Recs boss and all round chiller Anthony Naples turns in a floor friendly hour full of bumping 80s and 90s club jams, live and direct from his record filled bedroom in Queens. After following his evolution as an up-and-coming artist / DJ / record label guy, Naples’ finger never really seems to leave the pulse. With a keen ear for discovering fresh NYC based talent and sharing it with the world, local producers like Huerco S., Hank Jackson and Austin Cesear have all helped to forge his Proibito label’s unique NYC identity. As a DJ Naples doesn’t disappoint either, regularly playing all night long to sweaty dancefloors round the globe, weaving together countless tempos and styles. If you get a chance to catch him over the next couple of weeks, we highly recommend it!\n\nHey Anthony, what’s happening man?\n\nHello Myles, I’m just hanging out and getting started on the day. It’s a nice one here in Ridgewood, NYC (and also – Happy International Women’s Day!) – I hope you are well too.\n\nYour newest EP Us Mix is just around the corner and sounds to be channeling various 90s US house vibes with your own unique twist on things. Was that the general idea behind these four club tracks?\n\nI’m not sure if I go into anything with a general idea, for better or worse. These are just a few songs I made in fall 2016 that were definitely inspired by my experiences over the few months prior. It was a very melancholy, but chill time for me when I was making them, and I guess you just can’t help what you are, hey!\n\n2016 was by far your label Proibito’s biggest year to date, with Huerco S.’ brilliant ambient album plus a handful of EPs from NYC artists DJ Python, Hank Jackson and yourself alongside some interesting new names. What else might we be able to expect from the label this year?\n\nThanks for all the kind words! I’m actually taking a break from ye olde PRB after Us Mix comes out to check out some new routes. One of which is starting a new label with my girlfriend. Just like that old Australian saying goes “two heads are better than one, especially when they’re in love!”. The first release is actually coming from an Aussie we all know and love, so stay tuned for that!\n\nYour music feels like it’s evolved quite a bit in recent times, with your EP for The Trilogy Tapes dealing in what Ivan Berko sums up as ‘slo mo electro for neon lit life’. Hearing you play in NYC late last year with CZ Wang it felt like these kind of slower, more suspenseful tracks were really key to laying the foundations of the night. Was this kinda where your head was at approaching that record?\n\nHaha, shout out to Ivan, what a guy! and CZ!\n\nHmmm, it’s again just a product of my environment I guess – going to the Loft and it’s sort of affiliated parties definitely rewired my brain a bit, and you can’t help that sort of thing can you? I’m just going with my flow – I was worried how people would take to it, but in the end, one of the DJ’s who influenced this record, Takaya Nagase, told me he liked it a lot, so it always comes full circle. Shout out to Takaya as well!\n\nWhat can you tell us about this little mix you’ve gone and done for us?\n\nIt’s just a quick live recording in my room. I just played some stuff I pulled from the shelves without planning it out at all. Once and a while Jen would come in and give me a “woo” – so lets say the title of this mix is “In the pursuit of Woo”. A few records skipped, and nearly all of them have moments where they fall out of time, but I catch them! And as I always say, “What is life without mistakes?”. Also I must say that 1/3rd of these records are Jen’s so of course I couldn’t have done it without her influence.\n\nYou’re back in Australia again in a minute, was there anything you didn’t get to tick off the bucket list last time you were out here? Where can people catch you this time round?\n\nI didn’t get out of the cities either time I’ve been to AUS in the past, so I’d like to check out some Bush, and some DOOFS hopefully. Also some wildlife. I know it’s stereotypical, but to hold a sweet little koala bear in my arms would be a dream come true. If I wasn’t a DJ I’d definitely go to Vet school to take care of my furrier brothers and sisters.\n\nI’ll be in Melbourne, Perth, Adelaide, and Sydney. Doing a few off-the-table surprise parties as well. Still waiting on that Darwin connect to come through!!\n\nUrulu\n\nRegularly hopping between LA and Berlin, Taylor Freels aka Urulu has found his calling creating spatially rich analogue sounds for likeminded labels like Voyage, Dirt Crew and his own carefully curated Amadeus imprint. With his maiden Australian voyage kicking off this weekend, Urulu chimes in here with a spacey, late night affair full of his signature chunky atmospheric house and electro.\n\nWhat’s been happening mate? Have you managed to escape much of the Berlin and or Californian winter?\n\nHey hey, all good! Back stateside for some time now. What was intended on being an extended holiday stay sort of turned into a total avoidance of winter in Berlin (ha).\n\nYour label Amadeus has consistently released a range of spacey house records since it began back in 2012, nurturing a healthy roster of likeminded friends, what can you tell us about the general idea there and what’s coming up next for the label?\n\nFor me, Amadeus has never really had a clear motive other than releasing records from friends. The label itself has directly reflected my taste(s) in music over the past five years, which could be seen both as consistent and chaotic. Currently the label is stronger than ever, with our roster at about four core artists (Huerta, Chaos In The CBD, Cromie & myself).\n\nUp next will be a solo 12” of mine, the first actually on the label (ha). I am more than ecstatic for this one as it’s sort of a birth of a new pseudonym, “Señor Friction.” The record with fit four tracks on it and is due out late March. You can also expect a solo record from Cromie & Huerta to drop later in the year.\n\nGreetings From Namek was up there with our favourite records from last year… I read that you kinda poured your heart and soul into that one over a long period of time, and it definitely shines through in the release… What might a follow up for the label sound like?\n\nHey thanks for that. It was great to work with Andy on a project that took well over 6 months. Looking forward to getting another Voyage record out this year. Haven’t nailed a tracklisting yet, so no telling on what or when that’d be.\n\nWhat can you tell us about this mix you’ve put together, who are some of the artists featured in there?\n\nLet’s see. I’ve got a little interlude from myself to kick things off, a classic Georgie Red remix, as well as the latest from Kid Sublime, Mathew Herbert and Youandewan.\n\nWhat else is coming up this year?\n\nDirectly after these Aus dates I’ll be heading to China for a little tour (full schedule\n\nbelow). Music wise there’s another Kepler Sound record off to press, a few remixes\n\n(specifically one for the Sports Records buds in Miami), and a solo 12” from myself on\n\nAmadeus.\n\nUpcoming dates:\n\n1/28 – tba – Dallas\n\n2/04 – Lost Weekend – Melbourne\n\n2/11 – Strange Behavior – Wellington\n\n2/18 – Lucid – Melbourne\n\n2/24 – Peoples Club – Sydney\n\n2/25 – Center Source Rec Party – Brisbane\n\n3/04 – HWG – Chengdu\n\n3/09 – Lola – Shanghai\n\n3/10 – Loopy – Hangzhou\n\n3/11 – Migas – Beijing\n\n3/31 – tba – New York\n\n4/01 – Dolphin Tavern – Philadelphia\n\n4/07 – Treehouse – Miami\n\n2016 Review\n\nSo it turns out 2016 actually wasn’t that bad after all, at least when it comes to new music. Piecing together some of the best bits, this year’s review is stacked with Melbourne’s finest labels and producers, and features a host of recent MDC contributors and friends from further abroad. Zone out with ambient soundscapes, worldly electronics, deep electro, hazy breakbeats, bush doof techno and dubby atmospheric house from some of the best in the biz.\n\nTracklist:\n\nTelephones – Expanse // Running Back\n\nRoberto Musci – Water Music // Music From Memory\n\nUrulu – Lullaby // Voyage\n\nTornado Wallace – Falling Sun // Second Circle\n\nEx-Terrestrial – Blue Smoke // 1080p\n\nCale Sexton – Unsure Everything // Butter Sessions\n\nTauru Jonson & Lion Heart – Sunny Dae // Mood Hut\n\nNu Guinea – Howls // Early Sounds\n\nAnthony Naples – Lekker // The Trilogy Tapes\n\nAndy Hart – Island In The Sky // Voyage\n\nJTC – Caskadia // Bopside\n\nDorisburg – Lemuria // Aniara\n\nOlin – From Iceland (Huerco S.

Her classy house and Detroit electro inspired records for heavyweights like Apron, Future Times, Broadwalk and her own BRSTL – the label she created alongside Idle Hands founder Chris Farrell – have seen her jump up the ranks in just a couple of short years, capping off many more years of hard work behind the scenes with her own Housework parties and DJing around Bristol. Making her way to Australia for the first time this weekend, we caught up and she’s put together a deep dance mix for our final MDC of the year.\n\nHey Shanti, what have you been up to? You recently moved to Berlin right, is it feeling like home just yet?\n\nI have been up to no good! Hehe, Just travelling a lot and playing a lot really! I’ve also been knitting and cooking lots too, in my spare time! Knitted a scarf!! And obvs been in the studio as well. Berlin is starting to feel more like home but it’s hard when I go away every weekend ya’no! but its a great city and I love my place and my friends there, so all is good, I’m sure I will be totally settled soon!\n\nYou’ve also recently announced that your new home for original material will be your very own label, Peach Discs, featuring your own quirky paintings on the record sleeves as well as the music of some talented producer friends. What else can you tell us about it? Will it be a vinyl only thing?\n\nIt’s going to be my main home but I’d still like to do stuff elsewhere every now and then, if the opportunity arises. Im not sure about the vinyl only thing just yet, haven’t decided.. still making some last minute decisions but I’m always changing my mind about stuff!! But yes, the general idea is to release music that I love and makes me happy and want to dance, from friends and friends of friends…it’s pretty simple! And the artwork is just a way of combining things together really! I love to paint I studied illustration at university (for a year lol) and its something I never get to do that often..so yay!!\n\nWhilst living back in Bristol, you spoke about a lacking supply of good quality, mid-sized clubs, making your decision to move from there a little easier. With Berlin being home to quite a number of them, have you got any plans to get back into the party throwing game next year?\n\nI still throw parties in Bristol with some friends, there is a great space there that we use which is 250 capacity called the Prison Cells, but there is just not enough of them really! We are doing a party at Sameheads in Berlin on the 10th of Feb though which should be fun!!\n\nWhat can you tell us about this mix you’ve put together for us?\n\nWell.. it’s just lots of tracks I like!! Thought I’d start a bit faster and wind down a bit at the end, but with some fun and funky bits, I hope you like it!!\n\nWe know you’re coming out to Australia over the new years period, will this be your first time out here? Where can people catch you playing?\n\nYes it’s my first time!! woooohooo!! I’m so excited! Although pretty terrified of the journey there! I’m playing first in Adelaide then Melbourne for NYD, and then finally….Sydney!!!! I want to hug a Koala!!\n\nWhat else is coming up?\n\nWell, after Australia im going to visit family in Chile for a month, and then to Brazil!! for Dekmantel in Sao Paulo..really looking forward to that! Can’t wait to get some sun!!! and then straight back to Berlin for the party at Sameheads I was telling you about! There are also some exciting releases lined up for next year! So keep your eyes peeled!!\n\nNeville Watson\n\nAt it since the mid 90s, Neville Watson has been delivering pulsating analogue techno and ravey acid jams under a host of aliases and with a regular stream of collaborators for gun labels like Crème Organization, Clone Jack For Daze, Don’t Be Afraid and Scenery. With KiNK his most notorious partner in crime, the seemingly unlikely pair rolled out a slew of club weapons for Rush Hour’s Hour House Is Your Rush label with tracks like Metropole and The Long Wait becoming instant late night classics. No nonsense from the get-go, his mix moves between deep driving techno and house with a sprinkling of mind morphing acidddd.\n\nHey Neville, what have you been up to?\n\nGetting my head down in the studio.\n\nYou just released a track for Glaswegian label Craigie Knowes on their Second Annual Fundraiser – War Child compilation, with proceeds going to the global War Child charity. Tell us a bit about your connection with the label and this particular project, and who else has contributed to the release?\n\nMax, who runs the label, is a friend of Domenic Cappello from the Sub Club in Glasgow. He contacted me ahead of the first compilation and asked if I’d like to be involved. As a general rule if Dom can vouch for you then you’re in. It’s always nice to get involved in a decent project that helps people, my wife is a fundraiser so I often get to compare people out there actually helping others with a load of whingeing, self indulgent DJs.\n\nThe label have pulled in some top quality music for both comps. Oftentimes with charity projects the music can often sound a bit like producers have just donated any old tosh they have languishing on their hard drive, but they really have done a sterling job getting people like Bicep, Asok, Lord of the Isles and Shanti Celeste involved.\n\nWe know you’ve also had a close connection with Fabric over the years, playing there regularly and even contributing to the recent #savefabric compilation on their artist-led Houndstooth label. Tell us about your reaction to the recent news of Fabric’s imminent re-opening, and how much do you think the whole #savefabric movement that you were involved with played a part in that?\n\nI think it played a massive part and I think the authorities weren’t quite expecting the degree of backlash that they got, with everyone from celebrities to a young woman whose own brother had died from an ecstasy overdose getting onboard and making their feelings felt. Not to mention clubs all over having fundraisers. The pure fact that fabric were able to raise the money they did to help with the legal fees shows how important the #savefabric campaign was. I also think that in what has been a mental year Worldwide it feels particularly great that people in some small way are able to make an impact on what’s important to them.\n\nWhat have you been working on in the studio lately, and where have you been finding your inspiration to create new music?\n\nI’ve just finished up remix of Nathan Surreal on Biologic Records, which is a string driven techno thing. Plus I’ve started work on a new album.\n\nI always have a million ideas for music going around in my head and inspiration can come from absolutely anywhere. The important thing though is to work to a schedule, that is imperative in feeding in to any inspiration you might have. If you have an idea and don’t act on it your ideas in general will soon dry up. Waiting for inspiration to strike and the stars to align is for suckers.\n\nWhat can you tell us about this mix you’ve put together for us? Who are some of the artists that feature?\n\nIt’s gets a little bit more banging than I would normally do for a podcast. I wanted it to be a bit more like the mixes people like Colin Faver and Colin Dale used to have on their shows. They would mix the feeling up, rather than just bang the arse out of it all the way.\n\nThere are tracks from the ever mighty Jamal Moss, an unreleased gem from Dom Cappello. A few corkers from Ambivalent, who has had an outstanding year – easily my favourite producer of 2016, and some killer cuts from Semtek, Paul Mac, Matrixxman, Planetary Assault Systems and one of my top tunes of the year from Artefakt on Delsin.\n\nWhat else is coming up to close out the year?\n\nFifth Column, my release for Riverette is out right now. Then it’s getting ready for 2017, I’ve got tracks dropping on new Manchester label I Walked By Night and I Love Acid in Jan/Feb. It’s been a bit of a fierce old year so I’m looking forward to descending into mince pie-fuelled debauchery."
