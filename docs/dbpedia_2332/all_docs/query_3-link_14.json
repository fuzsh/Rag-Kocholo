        "text": "Kaiser, an enigmatic DJ and producer from Italy, is currently shaping the electronic music landscape in Berlin, Germany. Gianluca Caiati, known by his stage name Kaiser, has carved his path through the beats, blending the influences of 90s techno with his unique sound.\n\nIn this article, we delve into the rhythmic journey of a musician whose passion for techno transcends borders and resonates in iconic venues from Berghain to Bassiani.\n\nWho is Kaiser?\n\nKaiser, real name Gianluca Caiati, is a DJ and producer from Italy and based in Berlin, Germany, known for his techno music influenced by 90’s techno.\n\nGianluca was born in a small town near the southern Italian coastline; he first started his musical journey around 2007/2008, when he was approximately 16 years old. At the time, there was a big wave of minimal techno. He started out practising his skills with vintage turntables, mixing various music genres such as house (deep house and tech house), minimal, disco, and electronic music.\n\nAt the age of 18, Kaiser was introduced to the music scene, where he began creating his own music, spending years in his bedroom at his parent’s house creating beats and DJing at various events. He had a background of playing at beach clubs, which influenced his musical preferences. “I played anything in my life as a DJ until I finally found my identity in the sound that I keep offering for 10 years.”\n\nIn 2015, he went on a transformative trip to Berlin. Everything changed during a visit to a Berlin club that left a profound impact on him, resulting in him venturing into the techno scene. “During that trip, I got the opportunity to visit a club that gave me such strong emotions that it made me understand, musically, the path to take and to follow.”\n\nIn 2018, Gianluca established his own imprint, K S R (Kaiser Sound Records), which he debuted with the release of his’ State Of Existence’ project. The label officially came into existence in early 2018, but the idea had been brewing in the artist’s mind for several years. “There were years when I was very focused on the art of production. I used to spend whole days and nights producing music.”\n\nThe label was born to release his own music, but over time, he realised his passion for releasing music from other artists as well, such as 999999999, Quelza, and Justyn Nell, among others. The latter released his project on the label at the young age of 17. “When I discovered Justyn, I said to myself: what a brilliant guy.” Recognising the talent in Justyn, Gianluca saw a reflection of his own self from a decade ago. Without hesitation, he decided to give Justyn an opportunity, firmly believing that he deserved it and predicting a promising future ahead.” At the tender age of 17, he was able to perceive the quality in music by digging and discovering the records from which he draws inspiration.”\n\nIn 2019, he released the ‘Substance’ EP on the Knowledge Imprint; before the launch of the project, ‘Solitude’ had a different title. After some discussions with Ari, the label owner, they decided to change the title to ‘Solitude’. It seemed fitting for the two due to the sounds in the track resonating with both of them in a positive way.\n\nIn 2022, he released the project ‘Konsequentz’ on the Key Vinyl imprint, established by artist Freddy K. “I made that record especially for him. I have known Alessio for a few years, and I have studied his musical taste well, listening to his DJ sets many times and digging into his label.” In the same year, he released ‘Language Development’ on SÈKS TAPES.\n\nHe also collaborated with artist Matrixxman for the release of ‘Strapped’ on the K S R label. Over a span of several months during the pandemic, they collaborated on this EP. “Charlie is the big brother I never had. A wonderful, humble, cheerful person, capable of making you happy no matter what.”. He has also collaborated with Mario (Kwartz), with whom he started a project named Force Reaction. He has showcased his productions on labels like Mord Records, Soma Records, Key Vinyl, Attic Music, Planet Rhythm, and many others.\n\nBefore adopting the alias “Kaiser,” he worked in a duo with someone of the same age and creative spirit. However, over time, they decided to part ways for various reasons. “Based on my experience, I think that it’s hard to collaborate, but who succeeds has won because two heads and four hands are better than one.”\n\nOne artist who has had a major impact on him in his music and career is legendary artist DVS1. “DVS1, in my personal opinion, is the best DJ in the world. “Other DJs and producers whom Gianluca draws inspiration from include Steve Bicknell, Function, Luke Slater, Regis, Surgeon, Oscar Mulero, James Ruskin, Helena Hauff, Ellen Allien, Freddy K, Marco Carola, Rino Cerrone, Gaetano Parisio, Underground Resistance, Juan Atkins, Joey Beltran, Adam Beyer, and Carl Cox.\n\nThroughout his career, he has played at many notable events, including Awakenings Spring Festival, and has played at notable venues such as the legendary Berghain, Bassiani and RSO.BERLIN. “DJing is the thing that makes me happy in my life. It’s my biggest passion and my only job. This is why I give my best in every performance, every weekend.”\n\nWhat is Kaiser’s music style?\n\nKaiser is known for his techno music, which is heavily influenced by the sounds of 90s techno.
