        "text": "Table of Contents\n\nIt’s no secret that electronic music is one of the biggest genres in the world today, second only to rap and hip-hop. Electronic music has many subgenres, from deep techno to trance and big room sounds. Behind the scenes, music labels play a crucial role in promoting and shaping these genres, driving the sounds and culture of dance music forward.\n\nTo celebrate the launch of our own label, Magnetic Magazine Recordings, we wanted to compile a massive article that will explore the top sixteen electronic music labels that have significantly impacted the music industry, particularly in club and dance music. These labels are trendsetters, constantly pushing boundaries, introducing new sounds, and expanding their platforms.\n\nWe’ll cover their stories, highlight notable artists they’ve worked with, share some of their radio shows and live streams, and explain why they are considered some of the most impactful and important labels in electronic music today. But before diving into the main topics, we’ll briefly cover the basics of electronic dance music. Although Magnetic Magazine prefers not to use the term “EDM” due to its connotations, we’ll provide a brief overview for those new to the genre.\n\nWhether you’re a long-time fan or just curious about dance music, sit tight, and let’s dive in.\n\nWhat is Electronic Music\n\nElectronic music is a wide genre of music that creates, manipulates, and records sounds using electronic devices and technology, and while I understand that as a massive kind of catch-all phrase, it really is the best way to do the most general low-hanging fruit description justice.\n\nUnlike traditional music, which comprises of acoustic instruments and guitars and pianos and drums, electronic music, especially dance music, creates its own sounds oftentimes with synthesizers, drum machines, computer software, and sourcing samples from a wide range of inspirations and sources to sequence all oftentimes within a laptop or a computer.\n\nGranted, there are many different styles, which lean into the softer sounds of guitars, pianos, and drums mentioned above. The main assumption is that these are going to be more heavily on synthetic elements, synthesizers, drum machines, etc. While there is a growing number of artists who are kind of setting themselves apart from the crowd by doing live performances and performing their instruments or their synthesizers on stage, the general assumption with most electronic music, club music, and EDM, in general, is that DJs will be playing it often at nightclubs, parties, festivals, and stuff like that, and record labels are often the platform that helps get their music to the masses.\n\nSo now that leads me to my next question.\n\nWhat is an Electronic Music Label\n\nAn electronic music label is a company that specializes in producing, promoting, and distributing electronic music. These labels play a vital role in the music industry by:\n\nDiscovering Talent: Dance music labels find and sign new artists who create electronic music.\n\nProducing Music: They help artists record and produce their tracks in high-quality studios.\n\nReleasing Music: Electronic music labels distribute music to digital platforms like Spotify, Apple Music, and Beatport, as well as physical formats like vinyl and CDs.\n\nMarketing and Promotion: Promoting artists and their music through social media, music videos, and collaborations with other artists is a major part of their job.\n\nOrganizing Events: Labels hosts live shows, club nights, and festivals to showcase their artists and connect with fans.\n\nNow, moving on…\n\nThe Most Influential Electronic Dance Music Labels Of All Time\n\nSeveral music labels stand out in the electronic music industry for their significant contributions to the genre.

Another pivotal moment came with the release of LFO’s “LFO,” which reached the UK Top 20.

Anjuna Beach inspired anjunabeats in Goa, India, synonymous with trance music culture.\n\nThis label is known for its high-quality productions and distinctive blend of melodic trance and progressive house. As a result, Anjunabeats has cultivated a dedicated global fan base and launched the careers of numerous iconic artists.

It offers a softer, more club-oriented vibe that resonates with the evolving tastes of dance music fans, as the genre’s culture and demographics continue to mature and age.\n\nSpinnin’ Records\n\nSpinnin’ Records is another major EDM label founded in 1999 by Eelko van Kooten and Roger de Graaf in the Netherlands.

Beyer wanted to start a label that would push the boundaries of techno while remaining true to its underground origin. Beyer was inspired by the raw, industrial sounds of Detroit and the energetic club atmosphere of Berlin. Beyer’s “Drumcodes 1,” the label’s first release, established the tone for Drumcode’s distinctive sound, which is persistently energizing, hypnotic, and driving.\n\nThroughout the late 90s and early 2000s, Drumcode steadily built its reputation with influential releases from artists like Cari Lekebusch, Joel Mull, and Henrik B. During this time, techno remained a relatively underground genre. However, in the past five years, techno has surged in popularity, becoming the genre of choice for many, often seen as the “cool guy” sound.

The label emerged just as Skrillex was gaining international fame with his unique dubstep, bro-step, and electro-house sound. The name OWSLA is inspired by Richard Adams’ novel Watership Down, where it refers to an elite group of rabbits, mirroring the label’s ethos of fostering an elite collective of boundary-pushing artists.\n\nAlthough OWSLA hasn’t released new music since early 2017, its legacy is significant. The label launched the careers of many artists who have since become megastars, including Porter Robinson, whose debut release “Spitfire” topped the iTunes charts and solidified the label’s influence with its complextro sound. Ouslaw became known for a diverse range of genres, including dubstep, electro-house, and trap, featuring artists like Kill the Noise, Misha, Kone Sound, Jack U, R.L. Grime, Must Die, and M Machine.

Their sound is characterized by punchy, modern elements, including bright drums and ripping synths.\n\nThe label has achieved significant growth by prioritizing digital platforms, focusing on playlists and YouTube streams, which has helped them reach modern audiences and build a passionate fanbase. In recent years, Monstercat acquired Silk Music, expanding their catalog with a collection of more melodic, softer, and chill house music. This strategic move and their constant innovation have solidified Monstercat’s status as one of the most influential labels in dance music today.\n\nArtists and Releases from Monstercat\n\nMonstercat is committed to supporting its artists, providing them with resources and opportunities to grow their careers.\n\nMarshmello: Alone (2016)\n\nPegboard Nerds: Disconnected (2012)\n\nTokyo Machine: BAD BOY (2019)\n\nMonstercat is known for its wide range of genres, from dubstep and electro-house to future bass and drum & bass.

Some of these events held in cities around the world are the iconic Hospitality club nights and festivals. Through these events, Hospital Records has showcased its artists and provided a platform for the growth and evolution of the genre.\n\nMad Decent\n\nMad Decent is one of the most influential American record labels in the electronic music space, known for its eclectic and innovative approach. The label was founded in 2007 by DJ and producer Diplo. Mad Decent has always cultivated a unique vibe, blending far-out sounds with a laid-back, South California cool-guy aesthetic while still drawing in the worldly inspirations that Diplo is so known for in his personal work.\n\nDiplo established Mad Decent with the vision of promoting a diverse range of music, and he’s succeeded in spades. The label has benefited not only from Diplo’s industry clout and respect but also from its series of live events and stage takeovers at major festivals, bolstering its influence.
