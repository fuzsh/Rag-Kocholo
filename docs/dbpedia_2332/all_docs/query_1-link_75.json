        "text": "The emergence of punk in Britain (1976–1978) is recalled and documented as a moment of rebellion, one in which youth culture was seen to challenge accepted values and forms of behaviour, and to set in motion a new kind of cultural politics. In this article we do two things. First, we ask how far punk&#39;s challenge extended. Did it penetrate those political, cultural and social elites against which it set itself? And second, we reflect on the problem of recovering the history and politics of moments such as punk, and on the value of archives to such exercises in recuperation. In pursuit of both tasks, we make use of a wide range of historical sources, relying on these rather than on retrospective oral or autobiographical accounts. We set our findings against the narratives offered by both subcultural and mainstream histories of punk. We show how punk&#39;s impact on elites can be detected in the rhetoric of the popular media, and in aspects of the practice of local government and t...\n\nThis essay explores the punk subculture in the UK, and examines the extent the subculture was dependent on music (particularly the genre of punk rock). It analyses the different ways music impacted the subculture; considering both the role of music within the media and society, and the music itself. By reviewing literature between the 1970s, to the present day, it seeks to understand the different components of music, and how these represented the members of the subculture and the overall representation of punk. This study aims to measure the degree of musical influence on punk, and which elements of music had the most impact. It will focus on the subculture’s formation and demise, and how music affected both. It will also look at the music of punk rock in depth, and how musical expressions can represent subcultures.\n\nAs a visible entity punk was galvanized into being under its own name in New York and London in the middle seventies during the Cold War. On the one hand it is seen as a manifestation of postmodernism, on the other hand it is about an underground youth culture that expressed its revolutionary attitude mainly through music (the punk rock genre) and an outrageous, collage-like clothing style rebelling against conformity, authority, the establishment, class hierarchy and celebrating the collapse of traditional forms of meaning. However, Birmingham scholars argued that culture industries destroyed the authenticity of the subculture without adequately considering either the ideological underpinnings of the subcultures in question (i.e. punk), nor the concept of authentic identity. Hence, this paper attempts to unmask these ideological underpinnings and their authenticity in relation to punk, its signifying practices and intractably subversive features that can also be linked to its predecessor counterculture movements. This will shed new light on punk as a complex historical and cultural phenomenon and on the evolution and refashioning of the \" anarchic \" discourse. Besides tracing the punk ideology and aesthetics back to the movers and shakers of the art and literary world of the 20 th century (Dada, Situationists, Beat movement, Andy Warhol), I will also consider how the original punk movement, short-lived and nihilistic, marked the beginning of a phase of ideological struggle within popular music itself. Its broad cultural influence started with the postpunk (1979-1984) trying to built an authentic alternative culture with its own independent infrastructure of labels, distribution and records stores and releasing small magazines and fanzines taking on the role of an alternative media. This do-it-yourself concept i.e. punk ethos proliferated like a virus with the global expansion of electronic music nevertheless finding always new ways to remain detached from the dominant culture. In conclusion, the paper discusses that the punk´s appeal doesn´t lie in Hebdige´s semiotic flux but rather the punk´s formal stability with its clear ideological and formal elements. Perhaps only fragmented, these ideological and formal elements of punk resonate unchanged in current alternative lifestyles permeating the music, theory and art either produced or consumed. These discourses form part of the unconstrained self-expression of punk and it´s oppositional point of view in the world.\n\nSociety associates “Punk” with a music genre, backed with a very distinctive look, recognizable from the hair style, make-up and overall outfit. Other than their outward ‘fashion’ appearance, many also associate “Punk” with a group of young people who do not characteristically blend with their social surrounding. All of these factors tend to have them portrayed as an aggressive circle, and being associated with ‘anarchy’ has driven people to be weary of them. With a compact study through the history of “Punk” and the society in which it emerged, this journal will dig into Punk’s origins and unveil if society’s idea of Punk movement and society’s weariness against them is justified and fairly grounded. It will also attempt to uncover if Punk has any other social significance besides the aggressive genre of music that the public has known it to be."
