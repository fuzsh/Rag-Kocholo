        "text": "Longtime NJ scene photographer and music blogger James Damion may have relocated to Washington, DC, but he still keeps a keen eye on indie, punk, and whatever else comes his way in this column.\n\nUnwound  19912091 (Numero Group)\n\nNow that youve collected every Unwound recording, known and unknown, you can prepare for the inevitable and deserving rockumentary movie thats sure to follow by checking out this beautiful cloth-bound book. Much like any Numero Group project, the book itself is put together and presented with meticulous quality and detail, 252 clothbound pages with over 100 images, flyers, and anecdotes from band members and people who witnessed or were a part of the band's history, making the bands 20+ year absence seem like mere months. Despite the grainy and mediocre quality of many of the images, the finishing product and build of the book are excellent. The personal entries give insight into the band, its members, and their personalities. The flyers bring the shows and memories back to life, even warranting the hefty $75 price. With a 2,000 count first pressing and no guarantee of further pressings, I highly suggest making a move sooner rather than later.\n\nAtom Driver  \"Occupants\" EP (atomdriver.bandcamp.com>\n\nWhenever you encounter hard times or moments that might make your days seem darker than they might be, its important to know that music is always there waiting to pick you up. Im reminded of that as I listen to this recent sampling from New Brunswick, New Jerseys Atom Driver. Atom Driver has really outdone itself here with three songs, each of which leaves a lasting impression, forming a bonfire of energetic, celebratory anthems. With decades of proof the best bands known to us are formed out of the edgy cities and landscapes of the American interior. New Brunswick deserves to stand alongside the heavy hitters like Detroit, Chicago, and Boston. Location aside, with origins in bands such as Good Clean Fun, Deadguy, and others, the members' pedigrees all but guarantee authenticity. Through a mere three songs, Atom Driver leaves a lasting impression with a bonfire of energetic and edgy anthems worth singing along to with your fists in the air and your heart pumping as if its just run a marathon. As someone whos been hit with some hard times of late, this EP was the perfect cocktail to bring me back to my old cantankerous self. I can only hope the future brings a full Atom Driver LP or at least more singles by the band.\n\nBedmaker  S/T (Dischord Records)\n\nFeaturing bassist Arthur Noll (Light Beams, Kid Congo Powers,) drummer Vin Novara (The Crownhate Ruin, 1.6 Band,) guitarist Jeff Barsky (Insect Factory, Time Is Fire), and rounded out by the unforgettable vocals of Amanda McKaye (Desiderata, The Routineers,) Bedmaker represents yet another reason to reconnect with Punk Rocks past and watch its greying members show us the way. As a follower of each members past conquests, I headed into Bedmakers debut album with high anticipation and joy. It was quite recently that I was reminded by a friend of the time we caught Desiderata at CBGBs and the lasting impression it left us with. MacKayes voice has always had the strength and resilience necessary to convey the emotions of the lyrics, and there are few accurate comparisons to make. On the musician side of things, Id call upon Bikini Kills Kathleen Hannah as one that mirrors this band's strength and tenacity instead of mere styling. Howling vocals and wandering instrumentations show a clever sense of rhythm and syncopation, leading to a thoroughly experimental album. As it progresses, one can feel like theyre immersed in a spiritual jam session. The self-titled debut grows on you rather than making an immediate hit, thus making the album more of an enduring partner than a love at first listen.\n\nMatt Hunter & the Dusty Fates  Reindeer Soul (DromedaryRecords.bandcamp.com)\n\nIts always a pleasure getting news of a new Dromedary Records release, being that Al Crisafulli (the labels founder) is responsible for turning me on to countless bands that educated and informed my ears regarding the joy of a great power-pop hook. Looking back, its hard to imagine my time in the Garden State without the rewards of countless bands, artists, and records Al sent me. Though not the least familiar with Matt Hunter, a little background check granted a deep dive into the talent and accomplishments of a New York City talent whose many gifts are yet to be fully realized. Reindeer Souls might not have immediately impacted me but after the second and third go through, Hunters words and voice put their hooks in me. On Reindeer Soul, Hunter's deep and textured voice perfectly navigates each song while musicians Murdock, Öhman-Frölund, and Hunter create the perfect backdrop. While enjoying the album and taking in the depth of each song, I was suddenly hit with the lyrics to \"Franz:\" I hear the tap, tap, tap within, and I found myself questioning, Are these the words that will forever haunt me? Thanks again to Dromedarys boss of bosses, Al Crisafulli, for always giving me something I might not look for on my own journey. The man is a true tastemaker.\n\nDrought  EP (droughtdoom.bandcamp.com)\n\nThis Oakland, CA post-core band makes quite a mark with a well-rounded EP that features three songs, Consequential Love, Oh, Javelina! and MacArthur Station that explore a wide range of sounds and styles, including and mainly screamo. Comprised of vocalist Viggy Ram (Plush Palace, ex-Untrust Us), drummer Ray Avila, bassist Dev Bleyle (Obsolete Man, Failed Earth), and guitarists Eric Nakano (ex-Caulfield) and RJ Rabe, the Oakland quintet formed in 2022. \"Drought\" leaves an impressive footprint with heartfelt and honest lyrics that reflect real-life scenarios. Musically, it reminds me of past bands such as Thursday and Taking Back Sunday. Whatever day it is, Rams vocals are some of the best Ive heard in quite a while. He seems the perfect vehicle to drive these songs home with a tempo and rhythm that guides each song and that on this self-titled Ep. One can only hope an LP is in the making. Quite possibly, this is the biggest and best surprise this year has delivered.\n\nKing Face  S/T (atomicactionrecords.bandcamp.com)\n\nUpon hearing that 80's favorite King Face was not only active but had recorded nine new songs for a self-titled release, I caught myself attempting cartwheels. Mark Sullivans singing voice has aged well. The album opens with Not Pretty Anymore, a song highlighting Sullivans uniquely powerful vocal ability while reestablishing the drive and raw power of the bands leads and rhythms. The following track, Starvation Food, ups the ante with its driving guitar parts and pounding rhythms. The lyrics I hear a voice inside my head, that mother-fucker wants me dead couldnt have hit closer to home if they tried. Bad Mood follows with a similar impact. The words Dont know where Id be without this bad fucking mood feel as if they were personally addressed to me. All throughout this victorious return are reminders of how impactful King Face's words and delivery always were and how they set them apart from other bands who were worthy of our admiration. In the end, I felt as if this was an unexpected gift.\n\nDisarm - \"Existence Demo 1985\" EP (Beach Impediment Records)\n\nYou have to hand it to Beach Impediment Record's dedication to bring attention and life to old and mostly forgotten recordings of Virginias 80s punk and hardcore acts. As an observer, fan, and person who got into the hardcore punk scene in the middle of the decade, Ive come to both appreciate and resent the practice. My appreciation coming from represses and first pressings of records and demos I loved at the time. My resentment is fueled by the almost constant resurgence of material unworthy of our attention or money. Disarms Existence demo easily falls under the latter, featuring 12 songs of thrash metal-tinged hardcore with various influences whose mention might misrepresent and warp the bandsimportance or impact. In listening to these songs on Bandcamp, I had no interest in investing the time, money, or space to grab a copy. Not the least impressive or interesting, Beach Impediment has limited this release to a one-time only 500 copies.\n\nSIKM  Now I Must Comply (Beach Impediment Records)\n\nHeading into or toward a review, its never wise to pre-judge an artist or their music. It happens, though. I admit it. A band or record title, the albums art... These and many other things can close the mind and lead you down a negative train of thought. In the case of Now I Must Comply by Atlanta, Georgias SIKM, such was the case. Best described as street punk or Oi, comprised of DINOS BOYS and HEARTATTACKS alumni, these six bruisers, each of which barely makes it to the two-and-a-half minute mark, remind me of past acts such as The Ruts, Sham 69, and The Business. Not bad if you can get past the pro-violence, right-wing idealism.\n\nRed Cross  19811982 No Message (Beach Impediment Records)\n\nWith my interest in digging up ancient, undocumented punk and hardcore bands waning, my ears and credit card have become more choosy about what ends up in my ever-expanding record collection or computer hard drive. Not to be confused with Californias iconic Redd Kross, Richmond, VAs Red Cross was another punk rock animal whose sound and delivery hinged on a raw and chaotic sound that felt like it would unravel at any moment. (Think guttural sneers supported by a D-beat sound perfectly fit into that early 80s American Punk Sound.) Noting that many early punk acts had little music training to fall back on, I sense a heavy Germs influence that might explain my aforementioned description. No Message perfectly captures when our country's punk scene moved towards a heavier, louder, and faster style and eventually adhered to New York Citys Stimulators Loud, Fast, Rules ethos, the sound that would quickly be known as hardcore. Featuring 14 songs, any and all punk rock archivists should fight to secure this. No Message is more than worth its meager price. 100 copies on RED VINYL are available for mail-order, including a risograph recreation of the poster that came with the original cassette tape! I would say more, but for now I highly recommend you check this out.\n\nCarnage Asada  Head on a Platter (carnageasada.net)\n\nWhile the name Carnage Asada is new to me, the band has a rich history that goes back to friendships made within the punk and hardcore scenes of the 80s. In the end, I enjoyed this a lot more than I expected. I am being reminded not to judge a book by its cover. Musically funky with musicianship that reminds me of the weirdness of Voodoo Glow Skulls and Butthole Surfers, frontman George Murillos vocal style is more spoken word than anything else. Releasing lyrics with a storytelling appeal in that they seem to come from real-life experience, the bands story is long and interesting. Yet, as far as the music and the album itself, I feel lucky to have come upon such a diverse yet centered recording.\n\nTrail of Lies  Only the Strong (Triple B  Records)\n\nHaving reveled in the energy and power of their prior album, 2018s W.A.R., I was eager to see any evolution the Syracuse straightedge band had gone through in the years. Trail of Lies follows in the camp of hard-hitting bands from Syracuse, delivering the Straight-edge message with a hateful sermon. Stand For Change, the album's sixth entry and a personal favorite, features Pat Flynn of Bostons Fiddlehead. The thunderous guitars from JD and Tom and the rhythms from Tom and Chris are quite satisfying. Also, note the albums many breaks and breakdowns and lion roar vocals from Tom. While looking for new stories to tell about the new album might leave you empty-handed, this is a good album that shows Trail of Lies is still on top of things. Available in several color vinyl variations and CDs. For fans of Earth Crisis, Doughnuts (the band, not the snack,) and Snapcase.\n\nExorbitant Prices Must Diminish  For a Limited Tim (lixiviatrecords.bandcamp.com/)\n\nPlease excuse my limited knowledge and exposure regarding heavy metal's bastard son, grindcore. Concerning Ugo at Lixiviat Records, I am reminded of a recent interview Donald Trump agreed to with the National Association of Black Journalists. The simple term Know your audience could apply here. Switzerlands E.P.M.D. (not the classic rap duo) have been together for nine years and feature members of numerous bands of the grindcore scene. This, unfortunately, is the end of what I would consider constructive criticism. For A Limited Tim features 17 songs that each exemplify why grindcore is so hated and looked down on by many. Its unfortunate when one views someones hard work as an absolute shit show. However, this is most likely the lowest my foray into music journalism will get. It's an absolute dumpster fire from start to finish.\n\nPariiah  Many Shall Fall (pariiah.bandcamp.com)\n\nIf you read my review of Pariiahs four-song debut, Swallowed by Fog, youll know how enamored by that under-the-radar doom-metal release I was. Pariiahs six-song follow-up Many Shall Fall ups the ante, proving that small things often come in small packages. Ill add that many things we cherish most often fly under the radar. The current lineup features Paul Andress (Mothman, The Nolan Gate, and a respected visual artist) and Adam Paterson (Books Lie, Change Order, and Jersey City Tattoo Co.) Perhaps most notable is Alexandria Nelson, who played with surf-rockers Coffin Daggers. Nelsons performance on the Theremin, amongst other electronic instruments, might be a first in this subgenre of metal. The theremin, an electronic oscillator best known for its use in Good Vibrations and innumerable cheesy horror and scifi soundtracks. substitutes here for the bass, an instrument I find essential to any band performance. Each of the six entries on Many Shall Fall is exceptional and praiseworthy, featuring all of doom-metals signature heavy, thick, and sludgy elements; easily recognizable and not-so-recognizable movie samples add flavor to the recipe. Elements of the title song leave the most devastating mark. Overall, it is a record worth mentioning among greats such as Sleep, The Sword, and High on Fire.\n\nHer Heads of Fire  Strange Desires (Iodine Records; herheadsonfire.bandcamp.com)\n\nNew Yorks post-core indie rock band Her Heads on Fire is worth investing maximum time in. First, there's their pedigree, with members known for past work in bands such as Small Brown Bike, The Bomb, Garrison, Saves the Day, and more. Then there is the simple fact that this is one hell of an album that experiments and captures ones attention and manages to hold even the most easily distracted listener (me, for instance.)listener. On their third record and second full-length to date, Her Heads On Fire is firing on all cylinders. The band continues to evolve and fortify a foundation built on solid song structure and a very diverse sound that bears down on you like a runaway subway car. Syd Jaggers voice was built on Rock's sincerity and ability to dig deep to deliver the goods. (His time fronting I Hate Our Freedom is noted and appreciated.) Its also worth noting that any music venture that Chicago guitarist Jeff Dean touches or involves himself in becomes indie gold. With a selection of ten songs, its nearly impossible to put the spotlight on one, two, or even three favorites. Lets just say that Strange Desires presents the growingly rare occasion where an album ranks a very authoritative \"10.\"\"\n\nAncient Domains  Set in Stone (ancientdomains.bandcamp.com)\n\nNew Yorks Ancient Domains is a new rock outfit comprised of an impressive cast of New York Hardcore veterans, including John \"BIV\" Biviano and Rich Edsell of Supertouch fame on guitar and drums; Matt Warnke, former frontman of BOLD; and Jim Boehmer of High-Speed Chase on bass. Past endeavors aside, Ancient Domains carve a new path worthy of praise. Set in Stone features seven blasts of edgy rock, led by standout musicianship that highlights each member's skill set, led by Matts soulful, gritty vocals. Due to the past music endeavors of Jon, Rich, Matt, and Jim, Set in Stone might comfortably fall under the post-core umbrella. Yet, the music recorded here defies labels and genre categorizing. Favorite songs include but are not limited to As Far As Im Concerned, the song that introduced me to Ancient Domains, one that highlights Matt Warnkes deep, soulful baritone voice and brings to mind the great Greg Dulli of Afghan Whigs fame. The frenzied Makes No Difference to Me and the devilish Set In Stone are a must for fans of the Whigs, Rocket From the Crypt, and other like-minded debauchery.\n\nRibzy - '81-'85 Recordings (vinehellrecords.bandcamp.com)\n\n'81  '85 Recordings collects the recorded work of early 80s San Jose punk band Ribzy, described as legendary and essential by Puke & Vomit Records. Hearing the bands name for the first in 40 years and listening to what might be best described as less than pedestrian music, I would have to disagree categorically. Though featured on the essential punk compilations Not So Quiet on the Western Front (1982,) the \"Growing Pains\" tape comp (1983,) and \"From The Valley Within\" (1984). Little is known or mentioned about the bands existence. Ribzys raw and bratty punk style may have been notable among its early '80's peers. However, forty or so years later, its perhaps best forgotten.\n\nElle King  Come Get Your Wife (RCA)\n\nIts not every day that I muse over a major label release, and its even rarer when that album falls under the country music umbrella. That said, my appreciation and fandom of singer-songwriter Elle King come from a deep appreciation of her reflective and painfully honest storyteller-inspired work. Her turbulent battles with substance abuse and ADHD issues are regularly explored in her songwriting. Its no secret that her honest and often self-deprecating lyrics add an additional appeal to her songs. On Kings third album and first bonafide Country Music adventure, the honest, relatable songwriting continues to be a magnet to her musical path. Guilty pleasures noted: Come Get Your Wife is a front-row ticket to a train wreck. The album's first song, Ohio, and follow-up, Before We Met, read like diary entries and highlight Kings incredible vocal abilities. Try Jesus follows, guaranteeing this album's place as a landmark recording. Drunk (and I Dont Wanna Go Home) featuring Miranda Lambert, and the song Lucky add an upbeat aspect to the album despite their dark lyrics. Worth a Shot, featuring Dierks Bentley, shines as a high-energy ode to broken relationships and alcohol. The album closer, Love Go By, raises both the bar and the roof, putting the spotlight on a vocal ability worth praise and admiration. How this song ended up at the end of the affair hurts the brain. My praise for this album goes on and on. Always sensing connections and influences, I cant help but be reminded of Janis Joplin's honesty and openness. Hopefully, King will get her personal issues under control and find inspiration from being a new mother. While I dont ever see myself becoming a fan of mainstream country, Ill surely make exceptions for Kings work.\n\nMaya Hawke  Chaos Angel (Mom & Pop Records; mayahawke.bandcamp.com)\n\nPerhaps best known as an actor and the character Robin Buckley on the hit Netflix show Stranger Things, Hawke has also become a respected and celebrated folk singer/songwriter, inspiring many with her journey from acting to music. As someone who fell in love with her music through 2022s celebrated Moss, I cant help but be surprised how folk music in general has become a part of my listening regimen. So I eagerly awaited the May 31st release of the native New Yorkers third album. Being the daughter of Hollywood power couple Ethan Hawke and Uma Thurman might have brought claims of nepotism, but Hawkes' innate talent and work as an actor, singer/songwriter, and fashion model make her a legit triple threat. Needless to say, Hawkes talent is without question.\n\nChaos Angel opens with the dreamy Black Ice. Hawkes songwriting and wistful voice is captivating. Though her voice more than carries the message and intention of the song, one cant help but feel an effortless nature in her vocals, perhaps serving as an ambassador for folk musics strengths and purpose. As one who often rates each song of an album to mark for future visits, I found myself giving every song that followed the highest ranking. With that said. I feel the need to mention that Black Ice, Better, and Big Idea are personal favorites that will be revisited countless with an elevated sense of enjoyment and admiration. Chaos Angel scores a confident \"10\" and lacks any weak moments. I found it somewhat surprising that Stranger Things co-star Sadie Sink Max provides muck of the backing vocals. Recorded between Woodstock and New York City's legendary Electric Lady studios, Hawkes New York City base gives Chaos Angel a close-to-home feeling that seals the deal. All in all, it is a flawless record that will surely bring you joy.\n\nAni DiFranco  Unprecedented Shit (Righteous Babe Records)\n\nDialing back to my adventurous 90s phase and introduction to the folksters work, I decided to check out the legendary Ani DiFrancos just-released Unprecedented Shit. Perhaps universally known for the earthshaking song 32 Flavors, DiFranco has survived and thrived as an independent artist decades after the major-label contracts were being dangled in front of her like a carrot on a stick. Instead of signing on the dotted line, the singer, songwriter, guitarist, and poet has continued carving out a beloved and highly respected body of work. On her latest, Unprecedented Shit, the evolution of DiFrancos arc continues. The moody Spinning Room opens the 11-song set with DiFrancos unique voice and an instrument backing that sometimes seems off the mark. Virus follows, ensuring the listener that whatever might have seen a bit off is back on track. My favorite tracks include, but arent limited to, You Forgot to Speak and The Thing at Hand. Everything about Unprecedented Shit is top-notch. The lyrics, vocals, musicianship, and recording leave nothing to be desired. What I found most rewarding was that since her debut in 1990, DiFrancos voice and songwriting style havent waned. She still stands as a unique example of independence and the power of pure artistry.\n\nRedd Kross  Red Kross (In the Red Recordings)\n\nRed Kross has been a staple of punk-inspired power-pop since 1980. It puzzles me why they are rarely mentioned in the same breath as Black Flag, with many highly regarded albums to look back on and a current banger to drool over. The question seems worthy of conversation, with my purchase of the monumental Researching the Blues just last week. Its safe to say Ive received noise complaints from my neighbors and wife alike. The newly released, self-titled album is an impressive one, one worth exploring and enjoying from cover to cover. Candy Coloured Catastrophe, the album's opener, invites you on the trip and punches your card to what is a fantastic album. The aggressive Stunt Queen follows with scorching guitars and a robust attention to storytelling. It reminded me of the iconic Australian band, The Hellacopters. Good Times Propaganda Band and Whats in it For You? are like a time machine to the '60s, reminding me of those epic performances on Shindig or whatever music-related TV show. When looking for an album that honors different vibes from different decades and styles of music, this is it. As I get older and, of course, wiser. I find myself taking in more and more of the McDonald brothers Redd Kross. By all means, you should too.\n\nDeep Tunnel Project  Sweetest Balls (deeptunnelproject.bandcamp.com)\n\nIn my lifelong journey, I want to possess every record Chicagos Jeff Dean has ever performed and produced. I found myself navigating through the debut album from Dean's latest project, Deep Tunnel Project. After deep diving into the singles Elysian Fields and Connector, I knew I was in for something different from Airstream Futures and All Eyes West, acts I adored and hoped would last forever. Deep Tunnel Project is a darker animal altogether. Aside from Dean, DTP features drummer Mike Greenless, whom you might remember from TAR, John Mohr, and many others, and Tim Midyett, perhaps best known for his time in the legendary Silkworm. Check out this fascinating interview with him here. DTP performs a form of rock and roll that, at least to my ears, experiments with darker layers. Think of a more guitar-driven Joy Division, bringing the past to the future with a sound that stands out while standing apart. Weird title and all, Sweetest Balls is on top of my list of best records of the passing year, maybe years.\n\nMissing Link  Watch Me Bleed (Triple-B Records; bbbrecords.bandcamp.com)\n\nNot to be dismissive or negative, but I knew exactly what I was in for within the first couple of notes from this New York hardcore act. Eleven songs of heavy concussion grenades featuring titanic leads and rhythms led by baritone vocals that sound like someone leaning over a public toilet regurgitating the toxic remains of a night out with his friends. Hard, sick, relentless beatdowns, sure. Any sense of ability beyond the scope of the active mosh pit at a hardcore matinee, not likely. I found this to be very one-dimensional and limited in its reach.\n\nFirewalker  Hell Bent (Triple B Records; bbbrecords.bandcamp.com)\n\nFirewalker's Hell Bent is a cacophony of incendiary instrumentations and unbearable vocals, creating a jarring listening experience. The diverse and interesting instrumentations are overshadowed by the vocals, which sound like they came from an evil Hobbit on the set of a straight-to-video 80's slasher flick. With song titles like Devils Favorite Toy and Play Dead, Hell Bent is a nightmare on any street. The album features nine songs, each more unbearable than the last, making it a record that worsens as it crawls from track to track.\n\nSSD  Get it Away (Reissue) (Trust Records)\n\nSSD's seminal \"Get It Away\" has been out of print since before you were born. Im not as familiar with this release, the 7-song follow-up to the iconic 1982 debut, The Kids Will Have Their Say. 1983's Get it Away, originally released by X-claim Records, was the predecessor to the awful How We Rock and Break it Up, departures from the band's original sound that followed in '84 and '85. Seeing much-needed reissues of these Holy Frails of hardcores raw origins quickens the pulse. They stand apart from the endless cycle of revisiting, rerecording, repackaging, and re-issuing every indie release, known or unknown, deserving or not. Though not the timeless masterpiece of The Kids Will Have Their Say, the seven songs on Get Away continue to show SSD's strengths, from Barilles's songwriting to Springas screams. Get it Away still feels rooted in its urgent, life-or-death Boston grip; as the record progressed, I felt its hold tightening on me. So much so that I got the feeling Get it Away, possibly due to a time when we accepted little change from our heroes, was criminally overlooked. Remastered by Dave Gardner at 45 rpm to ensure further confusion on my part. (Available for pre-order now. Available for pre-order; release date July 19, 2024.)\n\nBad Idea  Breakout (badideampls.bandcamp.com)\n\nIts been a few years since I visited Minneapolis. Upon my return, I hoped to catch up with Bad Idea. On Breakout, Jon, Mike, Spencer, and Tim impress, creating thunderous, fast-paced rock 'n' roll that brings to mind Rocket From The Crypt. While I feel Bad Ideas Breakout could have benefited from a full LP treatment, these six rippers had me thirsty for more. Available on red vinyl, it features an impressive black-and-white live photo of the band by photographer Jacqueline Peterson. While thoroughly enjoying this, I cant help but notice the recent habit of releasing EPs on full-length LP albums. Id like to know if this is solely to charge the full price or if something else is behind it. Available for pre-order now. Release date is July 13, 2024.\n\nR.C. Sullivan  Masquerade (rcsullivan.bandcamp.com)\n\nJust when I thought my music journalism days were over, I was hit with a wave of new music that inspired me and has me looking forward to a bright future of eye-popping and ear-opening releases. The four-song Masquerade from the Netherlands perfectly applies melodic hardcore to its canvas, with instrumentations and lyrics that serve as an inward monitor, thoughts you might find in ancient texts from Revolution Summer bands such as Rites of Spring, Embrace, and 3. (Pardon the comparison to acts from the increasingly distant Twentieth Century.) Though it only features four songs - Day to Day, Chasing Rainbows, Masquerade, and Back in the Game - each leaves an indelible mark, eliciting countless return listens.\n\nShreds  Step Back (shredshc.bandcamp.com)\n\nDrawn in by the cover sketch of someone in the mist of some form of psychosis, this four-piece hardcore act from Sheffield, U.K. set themselves apart in a number of notable ways. Though some of the influences Im hearing here are from the American side of hardcore, Step Back sounds like something Id hear at New Yorks CBGB back in my halcyon days. The Scottish act is unique and convincing. Accent or not, Jims vocals are some of the most unique Ive heard to date, adding a certain level of distinctiveness to the mix of fiery guitars and rhythms. Adding this to your collection gives you something to stand out from the crowd. Featuring a full on 14 songs, none of which sound alike. This is a fast-paced guitar assault supported by drums and bass rhythms your doctor might warn against. As good as it gets.\n\nSpells  Past Our Prime (Big Neck Records; spellsrules.bandcamp.com)\n\nPast Our Prime marks The Spells third album. The Denver, Colorado rock 'n roll unit continues to impress and amaze. Featuring 11 songs best cranked up to twelve. Spells push the limits and extremes of hard rock and punk with an offering that shows they are still at the top of their game. with a stark album portrait on the sleeve that reminds me of those 60s black-and-white propaganda films. Musically, each song strikes a chord with bombastic riffs, rhythms and lyrical attacks. Past Our Time is one of those rare times the album as a whole outshines any specific song or single. That said, there are entries where a particular member and instrument stand out. Listen for yourself. Youll know. Resolutions - Monster Mirror (End Hits Records) Sometimes, a record can have well-written and performed songs and squeaky-clean production yet still fail to inspire any emotion or reaction whatsoever. In listening to Resolutions 2024 LP Monster Mirror, I got that exact non-feeling. Thats not to trash Resolutions art or its results. Its just that this album reminded me of the polished rock that, although the album is on a respected indie label, warrants the age-old term Corporate Rock Still Sucks. Monster Mirror gives off an energy that conjures the image of a contracted band in matching white suits, booked to play on a cruise to White Island.\n\nAngel Hair  Insect Immortality (Three One G Records; angelhair.bandcamp.com)\n\nLike nails on a chalkboard. Angel Hair created a sound that warranted the term You Call That Music? that every punk ever heard a dozen or so times a day. The noisy, experimental hardcore band introduced us to a new way to perform and express our emotions. It was dark yet cathartic to me. The band also introduced me to the term hearing loss, while turning me on to bands like Heroin, Antioch Arrow, Swing Kids and more close to home, Rorshach. The chaotic and often unpredictable noise was a stark contrast to Metalcore, and a welcomed alternative to the perseverance of the many tired tropes that overpopulated hardcore. Now, decades after their break up, San Diegos Three One G records steps up to put together most if not all the band's recorded history. Being somewhat of a punk archeologist myself, Insect Mortality was an absolute must-have. To have so much of the band's recorded history in one place gave me geek bumps. Whether youre a fan of the era's artsy detour or just looking for something to scare the squares, scoop this up. The record features 17 songs. The album comes packaged in a gatefold cover on yellow vinyl from threeoneg.com. (The color variations may differ.)\n\nVidro  Up Till Dans (Beach Impediment Records; vidro.bandcamp.com)\n\nStraight outta Stockholm, Vidro add four songs to a somewhat flooded hardcore market on their American debut with Richmond, Virginia's Beach Impediment Records. The band puts fourth four aggressive offerings that grow on you with each step forward. Hardcore excellence with a sense of hard rock prowess thrown in, powering the tough sound, while peppering it with more accessible hard rock elements. Though a quick ride, Up Till Dans (whatever that means)[\"up to dance\" - Editor] has a way of winning over the listener's attention, with the track Förstör Det Som Förstör Dig []destroy what destroys you - Editorbeing the killer.\n\nPeace Decay  S/T (Beach Impediment Records; peacedecay.bandcamp.com)\n\nTexas thrash-metal band Peace Decay are back with their self-titled follow up to 2021s debut 6-song Death is Only  Ten scathing entries of well-played rhythms and leads and tragically terrible vocals. Honestly, I had a bad feeling about this one. From the band name to the album art, everything about it said mediocre thrash. Understandably, thrash and most extreme music sub-genres are a love/hate dance. Peace Decay, however, did nothing to ignite any love whatsoever.\n\nBad Beat  LP 2024 (Triple-B Records; triplebrecords.net)\n\nWhile background information on Detroits Bad Beat seems scarce, the Hardcore outfit's debut LP really impresses despite their lackadaisically named LP 2024. A closer look seems to prove that the band puts a lot more hard work toward their music than their image and media kit, something I personally found impressive. Sixteen scorchers that raise the bar for hardcore bands with amazing riffs, timing, and the biggest, baddest and best bass rhythms known to the sub-genre. Each songs eeks out an identity and personality all its own.\n\nConservative Military Image  No Squares in Our Circle (Triple  B Records)\n\nIts been decades since I heard the term Skinhead Band, and at this point in my life, I do my best to avoid any and all labels that stigmatize or marginalize anyone. Instead, I choose to approach the music without any judgements regarding social or racial ideals. You know the term: Labels are for soup cans. Drawn in by the intriguing cover image of two skinbyrds, yet turned off by the non-inclusive title No Squares in our Circle (I have no idea what that suggests,) these Chicago stompers more than make their presence known. While the songs are quite good and show off some unique characteristics, I cant, in the least, relate to the violent, drunken, fist-flying ethos it supports. Next.\n\nTrenchkoat  Apocalypse Hits (BigNeckRecords1.bandcamp.com)\n\nThe second album from English hardcore band Trenchkoat features 12 songs that feel as if theyre caught up in a tornado: unrelenting chords rhythms and demon spirit vocals. (Imagine Jigsaw from the movie franchise SAW fronting a hardcore band.) Apocalypse Hits reminds me of the pre-teen weekends spent sneaking into local theatres to catch the latest slasher films making appearances on the screen. Though those films certainly didnt hold up or warrant return visits, the memories of being a juvenile delinquent looking for trouble are gold. Though this fast paced, fire-in-the-hole noise isnt something Id listen to normally, the fact that it brought back fond memories and had me recall my some of horror director John Carpenter's film scores is definitely a plus. Not my thing, at all, but worth hearing. The vinyl comes with a 16-page fanzine.\n\nTeen Cobra  Buzzkill (Big Neck Records)\n\nBuzzkill follows the group's 2020 debut EP, \"Teen Piranha.\" If it's your thing and you dont mind testing your ear drums limits, go for it.\n\nThe Stools - Live at Outer Limits 12-28-19 (Big Neck Records)\n\nWhile the vinyl LP is sold out, heres a chance for Stools fans to revisit that \"Outer Limits\" show or hear what you missed. Though I do recall reviewing one of their albums for this column, I honestly have no memory of their sound or style. While trying to listen to this album with an open mind, I could honestly find nothing worth noting or retaining. Detroit rockers the Stools might deserve more respect and mention for their years together honing their chops as a bluesy, punk rock fused band. Unfortunately, this live album wont do it.\n\nKid You Not  Heres to Feeling Good All the Time (kidyounotfl.bandcamp.com\n\nIn my late teens, I had a good friend who used the term I kid you not more often than any used car salesman ever mouthed. Fast forward a couple of hundred years and I find myself reviewing a final release by a band that has left us with four noteworthy albums, but seems to have called it quits. This titanic eponymous album leaved us licking the wounds of our loss. Sad, considering this is really good stuff. First off, you cant go wrong with the title Heres to Feeling Good all the Time. It announces a celebration worth attending. The party gets started with the opening track, the look in the mirror with the self-awareness and humbling self-realization of I am who I am. And I wish that I wasnt. Kid You Nots uptempo post-core sound is immediately contagious, featuring uplifting vocals, ever-reaching harmonies and riffs, and well-placed and subtly giant rhythms. If there was ever an award for not judging a book by its cover, Kid You Not brings to mind many of the bands - including Hot Water Music, the seldom celebrated Iron Chic, The Menzingers, and others - who inspired so many fans' sing a-longs, raised pints and support.\n\nSleave  How to Get Over (Engineer Records)\n\nRichmond, Virginias Sleaves feature 10 radio-friendly AOR tunes worthy of an A&R rep's wet dream. Polished, clean, and well-produced songs that went through me without ever making a connection or striking a nerve. While the music and production are worth noting, perhaps its the corporate rock vibe that seems to flow through each song that turned me off. The track How To Get Over begs for your attention, but youd have to play it for me a dozen or so times before I remembered it. Pass.\n\nBad Bad Hats  S/T (Don Giovanni Records; dongiovannirecords.bandcamp.com/)\n\nTaking a deep dive into Don Giovanni Records catalog has always been a rewarding journey, one that has included Screaming Females, The Ergs and many, many more. Mining the just released LP from Minneapolis, Minnesotas dynamic duo Bad Bad Hats was quite fulfilling as the 10 songs on this disk almost immediately brought warmth to my cold heart. The duo of Kerry Alexander and Chris Hoge have been writing, recording and touring since they met in college more than ten years ago. Through four previous albums, their brand of warm and upbeat pop rock has brought the term indie-rock back to relevance. Alexanders voice is warm and heavenly. I found myself bobbing my head and tapping my feet to every note. The songwriting of Alexander and Hoge deserves praise as their efforts seem grounded in classic applications and 90s pop appeal. Whereas all ten of the entries warrant praise, the rhythmic Let Me In had me in a dance minded trance. Back to my Body was the perfect detour from the norm. And Meter Run had a bubbly pop genius about it that cant be denied. While I cant confirm whether or not this album brought the sun out today, its a strong possibility.\n\nFaz Waltz  Endless Beat (spaghettytownrecords.bandcamp.com)\n\nReleased back in January, 2024, Endless Beat\" is Faz Waltz' tribute to the raucous and raw rock & roll and boogie of the Fifties. And while I find it more than admirable that they avoided an overdone cover treatment by writing new tunes with an old, familiar approach, I couldnt help but think that a band I admittedly love and have dedicated considerable free time hasn't kept their eyes on the ball and hands on the wheel by continuing their upward trajectory. Worth noting, the delivery, recording and production are aces. Its focus on the \"once upon a time\" was a bit disappointing for me. All in all, not a bad record by any sense. Just one whose focus turned me off.\n\nThe Boatsmen - Hard Livin' (spaghettytownrecords.bandcamp.com)\n\nSwedens hard rockin delinquents The Boatsmen are back, and thankfully, havent mellowed over time. The band and the music on \"Hard Livin'\" feel like the perfect soundtrack to a night of drinking and bad decisions with your friends. A night youll morally regret, yet repeat on a weekly basis. You know, that night you met Lemmy Kilmister and regretfully challenged him to a Last man standing drinking game. Sure you didnt win, but you sure enjoyed losing. Okay, so I got way off track. Hard Livin delivers hard, relentless, bombastic, hard rock and punk, bringing to mind some of hard rock's best and hardest, such as Motorhead, Rocket From the Crypt, or Hot Snakes. Twelve songs, not a bad one in the deck. Through their last two albums, I feel as if Im channeling some incredible hard rock. Hard Livin has me hoping for more.\n\nWallbreaker - Wallbreaker (RefuseRecords.bandcamp.com)\n\nWallbreaker's two-song EP admittedly took a few listens to have its appeal sink in. (Isnt that how it always goes? ) This self-titled EP fits that bill. Formed by Jeremy Evans (Coke Bust, WarXGames - two bands I would highly recommend looking into;) Jeff DeSantis (Bloodtype, Bleeding Edges Label;) Ken Ramsey (Glory Fades;) and Ben Wood (Chainsaw To The Face), the New Jersey-based hardcore band finds influence in great hardcore bands such as Life's Blood and Sheer Terror. Raw and angry as fuck. Having recently received a small taste of Wallbreaker, I knew what was coming, and I wasn't expecting much. However, after a few closer listens. I was more than convinced. Surely, Wallbreaker seems to be playing it safe when it comes to their brand of hardcore, but if it aint broken\n\nMerauder - Master Killer (Rebellion Records; rebellionshop.com)\n\nMusic is very subjective. Just because you're not into a record, or you straight-up hate a band's sound, doesn't necessarily mean it sucks. Such is the case with Merauder. While many in the Hardcore and crossover community go nuts for them, Merauder is like many of the outerlying crossover, tough guy bands of the 90's that did not appeal to me. While earlier recordings show ties to Hardcore and especially metal crossover, their 1996 Century Media release \"Master Killer\" sent them directly into the \"Metal Core\" universe. This latest reissue of 1995's \"Master Killer is the first vinyl issue since 2021, available again on color vinyl and imported from the Netherlands. Unfortunately, listening to these 10 songs for the first time since 1995 was not the least rewarding. Featuring the original ten songs, this marks the first time that the promise of color vinyl was more rewarding than the music itself. Hard pass.\n\nThe Fastbacks  1985 Okay (HeySuburbiaRecords.com)\n\nAsk any music-minded Seattle resident about The Fastbacks and expect a barrage of praise and admiration for a band that helped inspire the birth of Sub-Pop records and pioneer the entire grunge rock scene. Recorded July 9th, 1985 in a Pioneer Square basement (my wife and I almost moved there and never once regreted our decision not to,) the 12-song demo has been carefully remastered. (Well done, I must say.) 1985 Okay marks the first time Ive listened to The Fastbacks since my time in Seattle (2017  2021.) I found it hard to digest that a demo, basically an introduction to a newly formed band, could be so impressive. Though not polished or overproduced, the songwriting and final results are quite impressive. Theres a notable cover of Jefferson Airplane's Somebody to Love.\" It can also be noted that Warnicks vocals and approach are incredibly versatile. I mentioned I had not listened to the Fastbacks since my Seattle days, but this record's appeal guarantees numerous spins, no matter where I call home. The record comes in limited edition white vinyl and available through Italys Hey Suburbia label. On the downside. If there is one. Id like to voice my dismay regarding reissues that are void of any cookies that tell the story about the band members and history. I would gladly trade the color vinyl for a backstory, images and, at the very least, a lyric sheet.\n\nMary Timony  Tame the Tiger (Merge Records)\n\nBefore reviewing Mary Timony's \"Tame the Tiger,\" it's important to celebrate the singer-songwriter-guitarist's 30-plus years of contributions to indie music and culture as a member of bands such as Autoclave, Helium, Wild Flag, Hammered Hulls, and Ex Hex, among others. Her voice, songwriting, and guitar play have contributed so much to independent music that nothing less than a statue erected in her honor would suffice. On this solo release, \"No Thirds\" opens the journey with Timony sounding like a troubadour with a tale to tell. Authentic on all levels. One can feel Country and Folk vibes with the scent of Sheryl Crowe thrown in for good measure. Gentle strokes of folk-inspired melodies and emotional soundscapes carry the listener through like a gifted storyteller. Tame the Tiger is a 10, if not a 10+, a record thats warranted countless listens and has confidently occupied my turntable since its arrival.\n\nMoira - Demo (Refused Records; moirapl.bandcamp.com)\n\nEarlier today, I had the chance to listen to a rather impressive four-song demo of Poland's female-fronted Moira. The band delivers some dark hardcore that feels quite dynamic and uplifting, songs that feature a deep emotional core. Screamed/shouted vocals and sharp as fuck instrumentals forge a thick-as-fuck bond that impresses on every level. Appealing to both hardcore and metal purists alike, I have to admit that Moira caught me off guard. However, I didn't expect anything nearly as moving, dynamic, or satisfying as these four songs. I loved this and cant wait to hear more.\n\nOuter World - Who Does The Music Love? (outerworldmusic.bandcamp.com)\n\nFeaturing Tracy Wilson and Kenny Close of Richmond, VA's Positive No, Outer World seems to be an evolving project from the songwriting duo. Wilson and Close make for a dynamic songwriting team, creating a soundscape that includes dreampop, shoegaze, and trip-hop elements. I am dumbfounded regarding how Wilson's singing has held a grip on me since I first heard it back in the mid-Nineties, both angelic and haunting simultaneously. At any range or level of emotion, it perfectly conveys the song's mood and its intended emotion. If these two songs are any indication of what's to come, sign me up.\n\nThe Hasbros - God Hates the Hasbros (thehasbrosnyc.bandcamp.com)\n\nSince my editor agrees that my reviews have no actual timetable, I thought I'd step back to discuss what was one of 2023's best releases. Since the Hasbro's debut album, 2018's \"Cart Before the Horse,\" the Queens, NY, band has earned both my respect and admiration. How could they not, with their innate ability to forge excellent musicianship with a sense of songwriting that has me referencing acts as far-reaching as early R.E.M. and Canada's The Doughboys? \"God Hates the Hasbros\" features all the melodies and hooks needed to relate to and invite a record into your \"must-have\" tune-a-verse. There's a certain looseness to the musicianship that feels more like cadence, as it might point to their chemistry and desire to create and communicate with one another. The album features nine songs, each of which glistens like gems, making their connections and impact. Favorite songs include the power pop sparkler \"Eye to Eye,\" the emotive (yes, I'm a sucker for slow jams) \"Days of Night,\" and the \"knock it out of the park\" aggression of \"Hell or Me.\" In the end, it makes me happy to write about and promote something as rewarding as \"God hates the Hasbro's.\" Learn it, know it, live it.\n\nPublic Acid - Public Destruction (beachimpedimentrecords. bigcartel.com)\n\nThere comes a time in every reviewer's life when you get tired of using the same words and terms to describe your thoughts about a recording. My time came when listening to Public Acid's 8-song firestorm, choosing to skip the ingredients of that word salad. Let's focus on the record at hand. While North Carolina's Public Acid delivers more than its share of pummeling and bludgeoning, there's no further tale to tell. The band fails to distinguish themselves otherwise unapologetically, forgoing any rhythm, harmony, breaks, or breakdowns. Each minute-plus song fails to distinguish itself from the other, thus leaving little to no impression. Should you take a moment to read the bio on their Bandcamp page, you'll get the impression that they take themselves way too seriously. Pass.\n\nCanal Irreal - Someone Else's Dance (Beach Impediment Records)\n\nWhile finding little information about this Chicago hardcore band, I must admit that \"Someone Else's Dance\" is some of the best stuff I've recently caught up with from the respective hardcore camp. Fast, furious, and unrelenting. Canal Irreal's sound travels much further than the limitations of its sub-genre. Granted that, as of late, my attention span has been that of a squirrel. Realizing that \"Someone Else's Dance\" kept my attention throughout its 11 tracks, it is at least admirable. The 10 songs offered on \"Someone Else's Dance\" feature fast and upbeat leads, reprises, and above-the-rim vocals, paying respect to while giving just about every genre, sub-genre, and \"post\" addition a swift kick in the tush. Listening to the album countless times, finding new elements to celebrate each time, says a lot. Great stuff worthy of its sold-out vinyl status. I recommend going to the Beach Impediments Bandcamp page and listening to it.\n\nSexpill - In Dust We Trust (Beach Impediment Records)\n\nFrom the first note (if you want to call it that,) I knew Sexpill was not my thing. To be more precise, if given the choice, I would never choose to listen to this again. \"In Dust We Trust\" features 12 songs of absolute misery, scathing noise that sounds like nails on a chalkboard and reminds me of being awakened on a Saturday morning by a jackhammer performing \"Ongoing Construction Project.\" \"In Dust, We Trust\" marks the Texas bands' first 12-inch LP and shows a universe of space for improvement.\n\nMala Vista - In the Dark (SpaghettyTownRecords.bigcartel.com) (Pre-Order)\n\nYou'll not often see me reviewing singles, especially considering how difficult it is to gauge a band's appeal through one or two songs. New York's Mala Vista might be the rare exception to the rule. The single \"In the Dark.\" transports me to a specific time and place with its colors, chords, and vocal associations that would sit comfortably in a Lower East Side club, bar, or dive. Think 80s post-punk or guitar rock. Think about the kind of excellence and individualism the typical music lover and show attendee would love and a corporate rock record label would pass over. I'm old, so it might be hard to compare any current acts. Instead, board my time machine back to another time when acts such as the Plimsouls, Dead Boys, and Johnny Thunder were corrupting our eyes and ears. \"In the Dark\" is a killer track that will send to their Spotify page seeking more,\n\nBloodshot Bill - Trick and Treat Vol. 2 (GhostHighwayRecordings.bandcamp.com)\n\nIf you're still into 1950's hillbilly and rockabilly, then this 5-song 7-inch ep is for you. Limited to three hundred copies or available for download. I didn't find anything remotely interesting or noteworthy in these songs, just revivalist horse hockey that can probably suck the bumper off a '57 Chevy. Hard pass.\n\nBad Anxiety - S/T (RefuseRecords.bandcamp.com)\n\nWhile it took me a hot minute to find any background information regarding Mississippi-based Bad Anxiety, I learned that it is more or less a solo project of Hampton Martin, self-claimed King of Hattiesburg, Mississippi DIY Punk. He's perhaps best known for his being a member and contributor of the Delta States and Judy and the Jerks. The four songs featured on this EP are rough yet appealing. Sampling this for the first time reminded me of the fondness I've always felt regarding the raw and unadulterated punk noise of the '80's and NYC's The Stimulator's \"Loud, Fast, Rules\" ethos. Jagged guitars, bratty vocals and punk rock angst, generating enough excitement to make you forget about the rules of the game that punk sought initially to defy. Good stuff you should check out.\n\nDrink Deep - \"DD\" EP (Refuse Records)\n\nWhether or not Berlin, Germany's Drink Deep took their name from Rites of Spring's most recognizable song is none of my business. There's no argument regarding the pressure it might bring to live up to the choice. Respectively, Drink Deep sure does wear that \"Revolution Summer\" sound and ethos on their sleeves. Whereas the eight songs on their debut EP certainly play homage and find influence in bands such as Rites of Spring and Embrace, it never feels gimmicky or unoriginal. Just eight songs that hit all the right buttons musically and raw nerves emotionally. Impressive.\n\nOn Patrol: Discography (1993-1996, Richmond, VA) (southernpunkarchive.bandcamp.com)\n\nIf you're familiar with my column (and I know you're not,) you'll see that I love discographies of all shapes and sizes. Tracking down the recorded output of a band I have no prior knowledge is a particular passion. Such was the case with Richmond, VA's On Patrol. Hearing On Patrol decades after their initial existence was sure to bring some surprises. What transpired was beyond any expectations as I found myself enjoying every track. What surprised me most about these recordings is their kinship with the Cali-punk acts and Lookout bands such as Crimpshrine and Operation Ivy. Present is the desire to skank and have fun being a total nerd. Absent are the tough guy breakdowns and metallic worship. It features 36 songs from a handful of 7-inch EPs and an LP. Plus, a handful of live hits. On Patrol's bouncy rhythms and uplifting spirit inspire me as someone who's become aware that I may never uncover everything I might have initially missed out on. I'm grateful for discographies like this to remind me.\n\nNausea - Cybergod/ Lie Cycle (Svart Records; revhq.com)\n\nEurope's Svart Records bring New York crust-punk Nausea's 1991 \"Cyborg\" and 1992's \"Lie Cycle\" EP's together for the first time on a remastered 12-inch with the bonus track \"Here Today.\" Most notably, Nausea appeared on Revelation Records' 1988 classic \"New York Hardcore\" The Way It Is\" and was an essential part of the \"Squat or Rot\" movement that supported the squatter practice of the time. Nausea's sound was scathing and brutal, earning a small yet dedicated following. Hearing them for the first time in 30 years (remastered or not) did not improve my opinion of Nausea nor my appreciation of the band or crust-punk genre. Knowing there would undoubtedly be a remaining niche of punks and hardcore archeologists out there eager to remember the days when deodorant wasn't a key ingredient in the survival kit, I'd give it some attention. Perhaps hearing these again will renew your memories of dumpster diving, squatting, and panhandling on the Lower East Side. Note the records' limited Transparent red vinyl and insert. (Limited to 400 copies. (Release date: March 28. Pre-order now.)\n\nTrash Knife - Weird Daze (trashknife.bandcamp.com)\n\n\"Weird Daze,\" the ten-song debut LP from the Philadelphia quintet, combines excellence with an aura of fun as it produces something that most would consider punk but has an appeal that anyone looking for honest-sounding, high-energy moods and tempos would find themselves drawn to. Trash Knife and the 10 recordings on \"Weird Daze\" make their impact while leaving a lasting impression, highlighted by fast and fiery screamed vocals, rapid-fire riffs, and snake-like rhythms. I'm often reminded that when you findd yourself hooked on a band and their music, keeping tabs on when and where their next show was happening became part of the experience. Music, lyrics, and snotty, growling vocals keep you drawn to a core that can be compared to early punk bands such as the Avengers or Germs.\n\nNightfreak - S/T LP (nightfreakchicago.bandcamp.com)\n\nDespite only visiting Chicago once, the city has been a regular topic of my daily conversations and targets for future travel. Sure, the winters are cold, and there are neighborhoods where you better watch your ass. But such cities are a breeding ground for honest, badass music. Such is the case with \"Nightfreak.\" Nightfreak displays a gift for high-octane guitar rock that screams and declares independence from corporate interference on their self-titled 9-song debut. Elements of punk, hard rock, and musicality bring to mind the raw energy of garage rock. Nightfreak displays the raw power and savagery fueling a debut juggernaut. Like my friend Tohm used to say, \"This is the tits.\" On a side note. I sent this over to a friend who runs a label thats geared toward this kind of debauchery, and he loved it.\n\nAsbestos - Wishful Thinking (11pmrecords.bandcamp.com)\n\nCongratulations, Asbestos! If your intentions going into the recording studio were to say, \"Fuck you, we set out to make a record you'd hate and immediately designate for the circular file,\" you won the prize. If not. Oh well. Musically forgettable and vocally punishable by death, \"Wishful Thinking\" doesn't show any hope for this relatively young punk/hardcore act, a band that can be significantly improved by not making their attempt at tuning up a key focus of your recording session and rethinking the screaming bloody murder into the microphone. The opening basslines on the third track, \"Double Bind,\" are the only savior throughout this 7-song dumpster dive. However, it's far too late into the game.\n\nMorons Moron's - Go Pop (bigneckrecords1.bandcamp.com)\n\nWhile it's pretty apparent Poland's Moron Moron's didn't put much thought into naming their band, this Molotov cocktail of garage punk and rock 'n' roll produced here warrants attention. If you're a fan of no-nonsense and unfiltered guitar rock, you're in the right place. The EP features two songs, \"Cadillac Eyes\" and \"Your A Sleaze.\" If you're a Rocket From the Crypt Fan Club member and have five and a half minutes to spare. I highly suggest this.\n\nHeatseeker - Illusion of Will (Refuse Records)\n\nI have no idea what inspired their five-year break from recording, but the Warsaw, Poland hardcore band Heatseeker must have been tackling essential duties. Their new album offers an all-out assault that takes grip of your interest and attention, lifting any preconceptions about time apart, putting any strain on the member's personal or creative bond. Heatseeker possesses all of the ingredients necessary to demonstrate both its style and message. (The beats, the breaks, and the breakdowns.) This 6-song 7-inch EP comes on black and green vinyl. For those mp3 folks I keep hearing about, it can be downloaded on their Bandcamp. This is a record that has me digging deeper into Heatseeker's past recordings as well as their influences.\n\nJunta - Self-Titled (Sentient Ruin Records)\n\nAs a kid from the New York streets, it's always good to see and hear new bands coming up, making noise, and keeping that D.I.Y. spirit alive. Junta struck me with their raw, DIY approach to hardcore punk. I appreciate the novelty of their dedication to Anarcho beliefs. What separates Junta from the typical \"Squat or Rot\" bands I'm used to is the attention to more of what I would consider the rhythmic focus of their music. The vocals are impressive, too, in English and in Spanish. Overall, New York's Junta impresses through 11 well-executed and produced songs.\n\nMooM - Plague Infested Urban Dump of the Future (Lixiviat Records)\n\nFar be it from me to trash the work of another (especially when they seem pretty passionate about the art they create) but there are times like these when, as a listener, you don't feel any connection to what is unfolding around you. Israel's MooM flies under the grindcore flag/power violence banner. I've never enjoyed metal styles and often questioned how others possibly could. On their full-length debut for Lixiviat Records, the Tel Aviv, Israel band sticks with what they know, delivering a torturous mix that the LP's title can best describe. Meanwhile, the instrumentation of Ez Ra, Gad, and Heshbon is pure misery and torture to the ears. The death toll doesn't take hold until Sima enters the picture with what is, without a doubt, the most scathing and unenjoyable vocals I've ever heard. Thanks to Lixiviat Records for the informative and helpful email. Unfortunately, this is far from my kind of art.\n\nStymie - Toil and Folly (New Rage Records)\n\nBios attached to a file describing an artist's infinite influence and misunderstood genius don't appeal to me. Listen to the music on your terms, write what comes to mind, and then read the buyer manual if you're still interested. That's the route I took to \"Toil and Folly.\" Low or no expectations can be suitable for someone swimming with the indie and college rock of the time. Stymie were an unheralded Seattle band that recorded this album some 30 years ago. It's finally being released by New Rage Records, who have similarly unearthed seminal recordings by Alcohol Funnycare and Sweet Water. Stymie would have fit right in with all the hooky bands of their era. It brings me back to when every small club and bar hosted the best band you'd ever heard. When the guy you met behind the merch people later that night was in the band. Essentially, this collection of songs is a \"10\", not a bad one in the bunch. In taking this collection in, I can't help but wonder if their trajectory would have differed if Grunge hadn't hit Seattle so hard. Check it out.\n\nSamiam  Stowaway (Pure Noise Entrtainment; purenoise.net)\n\nThere's a quote in a movie, I don't know which one, that goes, \"Have you ever loved a band so much it hurts?\" Well, that's how I feel about Berkeley, California's Samiam, formed way back in 1988 (yeah, during the Reagan administration.) Like many Berkeley and Gilman Street associated bands, their signature sound was based on the pop-punk sound. What set them apart was their incredible lyrics and ability to express the emotions that came with life's insecurities and failures without getting all Wikipedia on you. Samiam - like, say, Jawbreaker - was incredibly relatable. All Samiam fans have their favorite albums and songs. Mine being \"Factory\" from the 1997's \"You're Freaking Me Out.\" Back to the present, and I'm trying to find the words to adequately describe the band's first release since 2012's \"Complete Control\" sessions. As I go into this review, I realize I've had it on repeat for hours without feeling the slightest intention of playing anything else. It's one of the rare occasions where each song immediately becomes part of you. The vocals, rhythms, and warm yet punchy guitar leads. As I get deeper and deeper into \"Stowaway.\" I can't help but feel this is a 10. While many songs stand out, it's the album itself and the way all the dots connect.\n\nSnail Mail - Valentine Demos (Matador.com)\n\nFollowing the urging of a reliable music nerd whose name shall remain unknown, I gave Lindsey Jordan's project Snail Mail a good listen. Having loved the song \"Speaking Terms,\" I went out and bought the album \"Lush,\" in which it is featured, and quickly found a new voice to anchor my calm. 2021's \"Valentine\" came, and that anchor remained. So when I got wind of \"Valentine Demos,\" I stepped up and pre-ordered a copy. Featuring a small offering of just four songs, this might be Snail Nail's best and most captivating work to date. \"Demos\", as expected, delivers wispy and intimate offerings that are both captivating and lush. I've always been a sucker for warm, cozy acoustics, and hearing those loose chords on \"Headlock\" had me choked up. Snail Mail has been labeled as Pop, Alternative Rock and even Folk. If you ask me, labels are for groceries. Suppose you're not already familiar with Snail Mail. I highly recommend tracking down \"Lush\", \"Valentine,\" and, of course, \"Valentine Demo.\" You'll indeed thank me later.\n\nBulldoze - The Final Beatdown (Streets of Hate Fanzine; streetsofhatenby.bigcartel.com)\n\nOriginally released on CD in 1992, now on vinyl for the first time since 2011, \"The Final Beatdown\" would mark New York knuckle-scrapers Bulldoze only full-length. Originators of beatdown style, one that influenced a wave of dumbed down hardcore bands that proudly wore the \"School of Hard Knocks\" label. Ten songs of heavy, unimaginable, and unintelligent stompers. Suppose you're a fan of 25 ta' Life, Commin' Correct, or Rick ta' Life on a Horse. Well then. You might want to relive this. Limited 100 copies on Gold/Black splatter vinyl.\n\nOzma - Rock And Roll Part Three (ozmamusic.bandcamp.com)\n\nAside from an eye-popping instrumental intro, \"Domino Effect, California power-pop act Ozma's \" \"Rock and Roll Part Three\" is a complete letdown and reminder of why rock radio is unlistenable, bringing to mind the bloated and overproduced corporate rock of the past. Ozma, despite some Herculean guitar playing, never connected with me. Musically notable, however, the vocals are a corporate label honcho's wet dream and an average music fan's castration nightmare. \"Rock And Roll Part Three\" does little more than wish there would be no sequel. Please note that my reviews are my opinions and not meant to hurt any feelings.\n\nCombust - Promo 2023 (Triple B; bbbrecords.bandcamp.com)\n\nCombust is an up-and-coming New York Hardcore band that arrived on the scene with a six-song demo in 2017. Featuring a chugga-chugga metalcore sound and street-level, non-intelligent lyrics, the two-song offering was painful to get through. \"Dark Corners,\" with its unnecessary broken word intro, and \"N.Y.H.C.\" ruin the journey before it begins. Honestly, it's the worst I've heard in forever.\n\nReagan Youth  The Poss Tapes 1981  1984 (Cleopatra Records; revhq.com)\n\nConsidering the sad and gruesome past surrounding this early New York City Anarcho-Punk band, one scarred by drug addiction, murder and suicide, the surviving cast of the original band have spent more than a decade on the road with revolving fill-ins too young to have seen the release of 1984s Youth Anthems for the New Order. Instead of creating new anthems to rally listeners in an era of political unrest, they have instead, rolled out some less than quality outtakes and live recordings. The Poss Tapes is just more of that. Featuring a mish-mash of 19 demo and live recordings, \"The Poss Tapes\" is a collection of expired leftovers and sloppy seconds, an offer of table scraps even a dog might turn its nose up to. There's no blaming a band for wanting to keep their name on the mind of people or make some fast cash by resurrecting unearthed material, but this only goes to lessen whatever is left the band's legacy. The record includes liner notes by original bassist Al Pike and comes on color vinyl. None of which makes this worth checking out. Instead, more crap for the circular file.\n\nPushed Beyond all Reasonable Limits by Brian Garrity (www.diwuelf.com)\n\nPushed Beyond All Reasonable Limits explores and celebrates the rock photography of Minneapolis's Brian D. Garrity. Having grown up in California with a stop in Seattle, geographical locations would have surely provided plenty of ammunition for his passion and long presence as a rock photographer. His life in Minneapolis, however, would serve as the launching point for a lifetime of capturing timeless moments. The book features images of bands such as Radiohead, Marilyn Manson, Rancid, Nirvana, Husker Du, Babes in Toyland, Lunachicks, Ice Cube, Motorhead, Evan Dando and Julianna Hatfield, Garbage, Rollins Band, Deftones, Luscious Jackson, Pigface, Hole, Descendents, Limp Bizkit, Alien Sex Fiend, The Offspring, The Melvins, and so many more, images that have been published in Rolling Stone, Spin, Alternative Press, and several other print and online outlets. The perfectly timed captures, natural lighting, and slow-motion captures are each worth praise. However, it's the many images of fan reactions, interactions, and bands hanging out backstageor just grabbing a meal that make this collection priceless.\n\nPushed... does more than document the fans and bands. It visually documents what it feels like to be in love with live music. No matter the artist or observer, we're all brought together for the same reasons. As with any release from DiWulf Publishing, you can always count on quality printing and binding. No matter your sub-culture, they're sure to have something to keep you informed and entertained. Those reasons and many others make this such an engaging book.\n\nCOA - Trauma Dump (triplebrecords.net)\n\nYou might have noticed that I've kept my ears peeled regarding Triple-B Records releases and Bandcamp posts.That's fitting, as Triple-B has been consistent in releasing hardcore punk, the music I've been drawn to for most of my life. It's a label worthy of attention if you're dedicated to the 'core. In the case of Boston's COA (Colin of Arabia), their five-song, gritty, and back-to-basics aggression fits well with that urban landscape. It's worth noting that, though COA has been around for quite a while, this is their first recorded material to be released in ten years. Not bad, but not all that impressive, either.\n\nRestraining Order - Locked Inside (Triple -B Records)\n\nWhen taking in Restraining Order's new album, Locked in Time, one can't help but make comparisons to East Coast neighbors Transit. Not by sound, but by the sense of growth and maturity the album shares with 2021's Glow On. Since Restraining Order's impressive 2017 demo, the Massachusetts Hardcore act has appealed to different eras of the core with their raw, aggressive approach and the new era of more elevated musicianship and characteristics. Whereas 2019's full - length debut \"This World is Too Much\" was a big leap forward, 2023's Locked Inside is a total and complete thrust into the future. A good one, at that. Ã¢â¬ÅAddictedÃ¢â¬Â opens the album like a category-five storm. The relentless punch of the follow-up Ã¢â¬ÅLeft UnsaidÃ¢â¬Â adds gas to an already out-of-control fire. From there, things level off without ever wavering in intensity, energy, or unabated savagery. Ã¢â¬ÅWouldn't You AgreeÃ¢â¬Â slows it down with its deliberate pace and focus. The title track Ã¢â¬ÅLocked in TimeÃ¢â¬Â is, by far, my favorite of the album. Restraining Order remains a favorite as they evolve musically while keeping one foot in Hardcore's original sound and another in its future. Where that might take them is yet to be known. However, the growth and progression of the band see no bounds.\n\nPrivate Mind -The Truth You See (Triple B Records; triplebrecords.net)\n\nMelodic Hardcore from Long Island. \"The Truth You See\" features eight songs in all, four from their 2020 debut and four newly baptized ones. Dark and moody, yet introspective and melodic. Elements to build on and take them in whatever direction they wish to go. Each song stands out. \"The Truth You See\" offers reminders of great bands such as Turning Point and Balance & Composure can be heard on my end.\n\nFyzxical - Is This Your Life? (Triple B Records)\n\nWhat goes better than purposely misspelling your bands name and flexi-singles? Well, I don't know. That difficulty of sorts didn't stop me from lending my ears to the single from this mystery hardcore band. While hearing \"Is This Your life?\"\" and Fyzxical for the first time, my reaction was hardly felt. While lyrically, vocally, and musically, this isn't bad, it just doesn't inspire further listening. Perhaps more material will encourage more of a reaction. Until then, pass.\n\nJust a Minor Threat - Photos of Minor Threat by Glen E. Friedman (Burning Flag Press/Akashic)\n\n\"Just A Minor Threat\" features iconic images of the legendary band taken by archetypal photographer Glen E. Friedman, including classic images and variations of Minor Threat in front of the Dischord House, Buff Hall, 930 Club, CBGB, and more. Before acquiring the book, I made the short trip to Washington DC's MLF Memorial Library to join Glen and Ian to discuss the book, images, shows, and, in particular, friendship. As I sat there surrounded by people my age and a half dozen or so older, it hit me that the iconic, beloved Minor Threat broke up 40 years ago, and I realized how much that hardcore/punk band and FriedmanÃ¢â¬â¢s work helped mold and shape me. I felt thankful for what's been a long and rewarding journey. I enjoyed every word, story, and exchange with people in the crowd who attended the shows and were a part of booking the gigs. Whether you've seen them countless times or seeing them for the first time in this book, there's something for everyone. Friedman's shots always come from a place of love.\n\nCode Orange - The Above (Blue Grape Music; bluegrapemusic.com)\n\nIf there's ever been a band that flat-out scares the skin off of me. Pennsylvania's Metal Core gods Code Orange owns all rights to blow back my hair while making the hairs on my body hair stand on end. On their sixth album to date, it's not as much as whether this is good. It's great. What you'll be asking yourself as you begin to rank their albums in importance and magnitude is. Have they added any new dimensions or elements to their wall of fiery sound to keep us on our toes? To this the answer is absolutely YES. The fourteen scorcher, 'The Above,' opens the album with a similar energy that each prior juggernaut exhibits by completely taking you out of your previous mood and transplanting you into one all of their making. That's it. That's what great music does. What I love about Code Orange and 'The Above,' is how after years of making intense music together. They still feel genuine, intent, and set apart from anything else I'm listening to. The duel vocals, fiery riffs, the depths of the rhythms. Those that keep my attention throughout and remain long after. As my long-time friend Ev Gold (Cinema Cinema) told me, \"You have to surrender to the trip.\"\n\nSAMUEL - High Places (samuelsc.bandcamp.com)\n\nWhat drives a group of musicians to reform or reconvene and record after 27 years apart? It's a story I'd be interested in sitting in on. Imagine the shock when one of the members contacted me for permission to use a couple of images I took of the band for their seven-song anthology, \"94-95.\"\" Before considering such inquiries, I gave the somewhat ambitious 8-song affair 'High Places' a listen, and found eight songs of tight indie rock with impressive vocals, warm rhythms, leads, and excellent strong structure that keeps it interesting throughout. Though we never made that deal to use those images, I appreciate the interest and admit to enjoying this, and I can't help but praise Vanessa Downing's vocals.\n\nBOLD - Speak Out (Revhq.com)\n\nIf you ever decide to jump into reissues, it's very important to understand that all are not created equal, and continually cruising on memory lane is unhealthy. In the case of BOLD's 1988 debut Speak Out, I'm should have avoided going down that path. If only every reissued, remastered, and multi-color vinyl LP could achieve its intended goals by impressing the listener and maybe even blowing some minds. In the case of BOLD'S 1988 debut and only full-length blast, it's a question that comes into focus. Originally released in 1988, Speak Out would be the New York Hardcore imprint Revelation Records' eighth release. Thirty-five years later. Revelation has given it a full-on repress and a vinyl reissue for the ages, as the color vinyl and accompanying 40-page book are pretty impressive. That said, while respecting aspects such as packaging, presentation, and the color variations of the vinyl, Bold weren't much to fuss about back then and have certainly not aged well. For myself and many others. BOLD always came off as a saccharine version of Youth of Today, aside from a few songs such as \"Talk Is Cheap,\"\" \"Nailed to the X,\" and \"Wise Up.\" What I remember most about Speak Out is how underwhelmed and downright disappointing the album was. Remastering and reissuing it on color vinyl with a 40-page booklet hasn't changed that. Beloved as they might have been by some in the CBGB HC scene, they also got a lot of hate from those who found them gimmicky and preachy, and they were often derided as a carbon copy of their mentors Youth of Today. Side note, they were barely 14 when they formed the band, so cut them some slack. At least their heart was in the right place.\n\nMONEY - \"Money\" EP (beachimpedimentrecords.bandcamp.com)\n\nWhen previewing Money's upcoming eight-song EP, I found myself quickly disinterested, unraveled, and left retreating with my hands over my ears. Even as my knowledge and appreciation for Metal sub-genres has grown, many elements still escape my interest and level of appreciation. Darkness can be a great thing. It's worked its way into music since the beginning and shows no signs of decline. But if you don't weather the storm, what's the point? Listening to Money offered no rewards. Instead, it sounds one-dimensional and limited in its scope and ability to evolve musically. There are no breaks, breakdowns, face-melting solos, or bridges to brighter places. It's just scathing darkness and riffs to no end. If this is your kind of misery, go right ahead. Available in \"coke bottle\" clear and white vinyl.\n\nGOLPE - \"Assuefazione Quotidiana\" EP (beachimpedimentrecords.bandcamp.com)\n\nAnother preview. This one is from Italy. Not having any previous knowledge of GOLPE or its personnel helped me to go into this review with open ears and an open mind. Hearing GOLPE for the first time shows how much Italy has contributed to rock, punk, and hardcore. It would seem the 'Loud, Fast Rules' ethos of NYC. icons the Stimulators professed had an international reach. The band's debut has a stripped-down, early hardcore appeal, bringing to mind the legendary Italian hardcore band Raw Power. Worth checking out.\n\nFURY Ã¢â¬â \"Resurrection\" EP (LG Records; dischord.com)\n\nOriginally recorded in 1989, this meat and potatoes reissue of the shared studio session that coalesced between members of DC's Swiz and Ignition during the last ten minutes of the recording of Swiz's \"Hell Yes, I Cheated.\" Considering the time allowed and the spontaneous nature of the recordings, these tracks are raw and stripped down to their bare bones. Both bands are known for their raw and uninhibited approach to hardcore, and the sogs presented here don't stray any further. Anyone familiar or new to these recordings will benefit from this short and meaningful collaboration.\n\nCleons Down - 1995-1997 (Council Records; cleonsdown.bandcamp.com)\n\nThis reissue collects the 11 songs DetroitÃ¢â¬â¢s Cleons Down recorded during their short, mid-Nineties time together (hence the title \"1995 - 1997.\") The lesser-known Cleons Down sound reflects a time when punk and hardcore music became more experimental, expressive, and emotive. While I've been attempting to feature fewer reissues (or in this case, a discography,) my appreciation of bands that guitarist Jeff Dean played with (The Bomb, All Eyes West, Airstream Futures, Dead Ending, and countless others) warranted a review. Originating in Michigan and existing in that mid-Nineties frame, it's no wonder that Cleons Down reminds me of the many bands that were related to Council Records such as Current. Those bands shared certain rhythms and grooves, start/stop breaks, and lyrics that served as an inward monitor. As an example, the song \"Loss for Words\" perfectly encapsulates the mood and ethos created by Dischord's \"Revolution Summer.\" Cleons Down also brings to mind bands like New Jersey's Turning Point and Lifetime. Each listen has produced an additional, go to song for me. It should be noted that shortly after my purchase of the MP3Ã¢â¬â¢s on Bandcamp, I went ahead and ordered the album, due largely to the album's amazing art and cream soda-colored vinyl. Note: The vinyl version looks to be sold out. Therefore, I highly recommend downloading the MP3's or streaming the collection, and checking back to see if a new pressing becomes available.\n\nDas Damen - 1986: Keeps Me Wild (Reissue)(Dromedary Records; dromedaryrecords.bandcamp.com)\n\nThe year was 1986, and guitar punk and power pop were still making waves and kicking down doors. Formed in 1984 in New York City at a time when Alternative Rock was still defined by having a rougher edge that thrived and survived left of the FM dial, a time that fostered bands like Husker Du and The Replacements before rightfully anointing them as legends and heroes of alternative culture. Noisy, fun and raw, Das Damen - Jim, Alex, Phil, and Lyle - cultivated a sound that reflected life in New York City and til' this day, reminds me of what you might dig up in the stacks at Greenwich Village's long defunct Other Music or Freebeing Records. Favorites include, but are not limited to, the spacey, psychedelic \"Behind My Eyes\" and the watery, yet scorching \"Trick Question.\" The reissue features 17 songs of \"all killer, no filler.\" Guitar rock anthems like this were a blast to ingest in 1986 and a pleasure to revisit in 2023.\n\nHe Who Cannot Be Named - Imposter (Spaghetty Town Records)\n\nIf you're unfamiliar with HWCBN, you will most likely remember him as the maguitarist with punk legends, the Dwarves. Is he a superhero, villain, or anti-hero? Well, perhaps that's for another day. What is quite apparent is his ability to craft songs ripe with melody, hooks, and pop-punkish sounds you might not expect from a masked artist. Granted, HWCBN'd bag of tricks relies heavily on catchy rhythms, melody, and hooks. What might catch you unaware is the secret sauce of catchy songwriting you get with 'Imposter,' an appealing 14-song palate of tasty power-pop-punk that should satisfy the harshest critic. As someone who tends to avoid what I might see as a gimmick (like, say, the lucha libre masks,) I can honestly confess that this was quite a surprise that has garnered many listens.\n\nSaetia - Collected (secretvoice.bandcamp.com)\n\nCollected, as the title suggests, brings together the 17 songs the New York-based screamo band recorded during their short yet active existence from 1997-2000. Though Screamo shares links to Punk, Hardcore, Emo, and other forms of extreme music, it makes my list of the worst sub-genres music has ever developed. Its dissonant sound and caustic screams are not conducive to most ears. One might liken Screamo's origins to mental illness and prolonged stays in mental facilities. To each their own, considering Saetia had quite a following in their day and were forerunners of the Screamo scene. The 17 songs featured here represent the band's entire recorded history. Here's your chance to look back on the Satias' time. Now available on vinyl for the first time since 2016 and housed in a durable gatefold cover. Due to the vinyl version being temporarily out of stock, IÃÆÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢Ã¢â¬Å¡ÃÂ¬ÃÂ¢Ã¢â¬Å¾ÃÂ¢m including a link to a bandcamp where you can listen before choosing to download, or wait until it becomes available.\n\nDFL - My Crazy Life (trustrecordscompany.com)\n\nHolding the deluxe edition reissue of the 1993 release of \"My Crazy Life\" feels somewhat strange, as I had completely forgotten the existence of the original CD I owned. I wonder how it became so mangled before being passed on to a buddy of mine? Formed in 1991 and featuring both Adam Horowitz (Ad Rock) and Michael Diamond (Mike D) of the Beastie Boys, and a cast of characters that once boasted Brian Baker (Where do I start?), and released via the Beastie's Grand Royal label, the 27 track expanded version features the original album and a live show performance. It was underappreciated at the time of its release; listening to it now is rewarding as it shows Horowitz and Diamond's love of and appreciation of their hardcore/punk roots, especially if you love first-wave hardcore acts and surf punk. \"My Crazy Life\" is a good go-through, a fun racket that never takes itself too seriously. As a bonus, the deluxe reissue also includes a 20-page, full-color oral history, a massive, full-color 'zine packed with unpublished flyers, and, the piece de resistance: a complete, totally unreleased live show that was recorded at a huge party at G-Son Studios the day after album tracking was completed. The fanzine's flyers show that DFL played with a lot of amazing bands such as Fugazi, Pennywise, Strife, and the legendary yet often overlooked Wool.\n\nSamuel S.C. - \"94-95\" (samuelsc.bandcamp.com)\n\nA good reissue or, in this case, discography allows you to relive and cherish the moment you first heard an artist. Or, in my case, saw them perform live. If not for tagging along with the long-forgotten band Baby Gopal for a show at Connecticut's Tune Inn, I might have missed out on the band Samuel. Now we have their firsdt new music in 27 years. I thought it might be fun revisiting this rather sparce seven-song discography. Listening to Samuel for the first time in years, maybe decades, I'm reminded of the uplifting movement and drive that made indie music and college rock such an essential part of taking the next step. Downings' voice carries weight, adding depth to lyrics about life and its varied experiencesÃÆÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢Ã¢â¬Å¡ÃÂ¬ÃÂ¢Ã¢âÂ¬ÃÂguitar leads and rhythms crash and cascade, adding muscle to each song. The production, something I don't often mention, is excellent. Though their initial recordings are scant, the overall output is impactful. Each piece helps to make this a rewarding return to my younger years.\n\nThe Chronics - Do You Love the Sun? (Spaghettytown Records; chronics.bandcamp.com)\n\nAs another Summer descends over the horizon, we grab hold of whatever remains, hoping to save what we can for those cold, sunless days ahead. The Chronics \"Do You Love the Sun' sounds like an album written to welcome the first days, rays, and waves of the season. Ten songs of upbeat guitar-driven Italian pop rock with influences ranging from the Ramones to those syrupy beach anthems I recall hearing on Saturday morning cartoons in my youth. Each piece leaves a lasting impression with upbeat and poppy chords and rhythms. My favorites of the bunch: The opening track \"Surf Town\" and \"I Can... I Go Home\" put the gas n the tank. For those lacking knowledge of Italian power pop, you're closing yourself off to a world, or in this case, a country bursting at the seams.\n\nCinema Cinema ÃÆÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢Ã¢â¬Å¡ÃÂ¬ÃÂ¢Ã¢âÂ¬Ã â Mjolnir (nefariousindustries.com)\n\nThere I was, speaking to a fellow music nerd, running out of adjectives to describe Brooklyn's Cinema Cinema and trying my hardest not to scare the Bejeezus out of her. It would seem like demons and tortured spirits were racing out of my jowls while simultaneously trying to convince her they don't eat babies or burn down churches. Just days earlier, I was handed an advance of the CC's upcoming release, \"Mjonlnir.\" My approach was tepid at best. After more than ten years of love and admiration for Ev and Paul, it would seem that there would be a slow decline or middling of those creative juices. Upon further investigation, however, that revelation proved untrue. Before we go any further, try naming an act, major or independent, that's still evolving and developing more than ten years into its existence and youÃÆÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢Ã¢â¬Å¡ÃÂ¬ÃÂ¢Ã¢â¬Å¾ÃÂ¢re bound to come up empty. Is it possible that Brooklyn's Cinema Cinema coincided with releasing their latest album a week from my birthday and on the exact anniversary of my wedding? The world may never know. As in the past, a deep dive into any CC noise rock experimentation can be likened to a dark psychiatric venture into the soul of a sociopath, an investment in time and research into the most profound thoughts. As usual, Ev and Paul have brought in some help with the producing prowess of long-time friend Martin Bisi, while coming full circle by adding Thor Harris of the Swans (a band that has always influenced Cinema Cinema's sound) on synthesizers. \"Mjonlnir.\" is a record that demands to be listened to in its entiretyÃÆÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢Ã¢â¬Å¡ÃÂ¬ÃÂ¢Ã¢âÂ¬ÃÂnothing against singles or sampling tracks, it's just that these eight offerings deserve your full attention. I might be going back more decades than warranted, but \"Mjonlnir\" made me wonder: What if John Carpenter directed \"Apocalypse Now?\" Like Ev Gold once told me, \"You have to surrender to the trip.\" Is it mere coincidence that the release of Cinema Cinema latest album happens a week from my birthday and on the exact anniversary of my wedding? The world may never know. Regardless, I highly recommend your investing the time and whatever brain damage you might suffer while taking that trip. \"Mjonlnir.\" Is more than music. ItÃÆÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢Ã¢â¬Å¡ÃÂ¬ÃÂ¢Ã¢â¬Å¾ÃÂ¢s art at its conceptual halcyon.\n\nINTENTION! - Brand New Story (Beachimpedimentrecords.bigcartel.com)\n\nWhile I may not be the person you would turn to for advice or knowledge of Japanese hardcore, my understanding is that hardcore music is an international movement that, by all means, affects the entire universe. Attending a couple of Japanese hardcore matinees while visiting Tokyo might also get my foot in the door upon introducing myself to Intention and giving the seven-song vinyl version of \"Brand New Story\" (originally released in February 2023 on CD) a thorough go-through. All of the usual components of hardcore are there: The breaks, busts, and aggression are upfront and present. While \"Brand New Story\" lacks that immediate impact that might set them apart from their peers, second and third listens were more rewarding.\n\nRedemption '87 - S/T (25 Year Reissue) (newagerecords.bandcamp.com)\n\nEvery now and then, an older man like myself needs to replenish his record collection with a new, shiny, and in this case, blue-with-white-splatter piece of vinyl. As a Token Entry super fan, finding Timmy Chunks (Token Entry vocalist) had a band on the opposite coast and playing guitar, I just had to see what that was all about. Featuring Chunks and Eric Ozenne, Redemption ÃÆÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢Ã¢â¬Å¡ÃÂ¬ÃÂ¢Ã¢â¬Å¾ÃÂ¢87 were a lot more than just a ÃÆÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢Ã¢â¬Å¡ÃÂ¬Ãâ¦Ã¢â¬Åband with former members ofÃÆÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢Ã¢â¬Å¡ÃÂ¬ÃâÃÂ¦ÃÆÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢Ã¢â¬Å¡ÃÂ¬ÃâÃÂ Choppy riffs attached themselves to raw vocals reminiscent of the energetic punk noise of the East Bay at the time. Redemption '87 deserves recognition as they offered a healthy balance of '80ÃÆÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢Ã¢â¬Å¡ÃÂ¬ÃÂ¢Ã¢â¬Å¾ÃÂ¢s hardcore timing and urgency with East Bay punk rhythms and energy. \"At the Hand of Our Disease\" and \"From Experience\" remind me of why Redemption '87 appealed to me. While \"A Solution\" perfectly displays a connection to their East Bay home Most notable and something I might have overlooked or forgotten the first time are the outstanding and anthemic covers of Antidote's \"Something Must Be Done.\" and 7 SecondsÃÆÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢Ã¢â¬Å¡ÃÂ¬ÃÂ¢Ã¢â¬Å¾ÃÂ¢ \"I'm Gonna Stay Young Until I Die.\" The bandÃÆÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢Ã¢â¬Å¡ÃÂ¬ÃÂ¢Ã¢â¬Å¾ÃÂ¢s debut is now available on 175 gram black-and-white marbled and 205 gram blue-with-white splatter vinyl. I, myself, chose the latter.\n\nDon't Sleep - See Change (End Hit Records)\n\nI've never met Dave Smalley, but if I did, I might thank him for providing me with over four decades of life-affirming music. At this point in our punk rock lives, is there any reason to doubt or question any band or project that includes Dave Smalley? That's a question I found myself asking when approaching Don't Sleep's new album and second full-length, \"See Change.\" Not that I go around rating albums as they do on Pitchfork (not knocking them in the least.) But \"See Change' without overthinking is a strong 10. With Smalley's vocal gift of expressing power without ever forsaking melody, there's no reason to approach \"See Change\" with any trepidation. Deep Sleep features accomplished punk musicians Tom McGrath, Garrett Rothman, Tony Bavaria, and Jim Bedorf. The nine-song affair opens with \"Harrison Graves\" before effortlessly coalescing into \"Promises Made.\" You're convinced this isn't your run-of-the-mill. \"Dead on the Inside\" follows, teasing that this will be your favorite track, deserving a cherished spot on your next mix tape. (Do people make those anymore?) \"Outside In\" quickly finds itself in the favorite track on the album. Eventually, you realize that every damn song on this album is your favorite. Worth mention and praise is Smalley's cover of Tom Petty's \"Running Down a Dream.\" Having heard a few of his covers of past classics has cemented my opinion that Smalley can do it all. At this stage in our lives, it becomes rare when a record scores an absolute ten on my rating scale. However, \"See Change\" does just that, reminding me of a time when we listened to albums as a whole and built a certain intimacy with music.\n\n?\n\nGraven Image - Studio Sessions '82-'83 (Beach Impediment Records)\n\nFor a time, the act of reissuing or bringing unreleased material to life was exciting. However, the practice has resulted in countless letdowns, drawing comparisons to Hollywood's obsession with reboots. Graven Image's \"Studio Sessions '82-'83\" avoids such disappointment as it perfectly reflects many of the best elements of early American hardcore: raw, fast, and vital. The album features 22 tracks, from the band's 1982 \"Your Skull is My Bowl\" and 1983's \"Kicked Out of the Scene\" sessions, along with a few unreleased gems. The included 12x12\" booklet helps reflect on and tell the story of a band worth recollecting. Show flyers include the likes of Honor Role, Minor Threat, The Necros, and countless others, to illustrate the importance and status of the rarely mentioned Richmond, VA band. I want to note that I originally downloaded the MP3s. However, the material's overall impact inspired me to invest in the vinyl version.\n\nThe Melmacs - Good Advice (Spaghettytown Records)\n\nHailing from the Leipzig, Germany, the Melmacs' debut is about as good as it gets, 10 songs that immediately impress with a bouncy, upbeat sound whose origins and influences most likely spring from late 70's and early 80's pop punk and power pop. The lively and energetic elements in \"Good Advice\" are essential ingredients that make each of the ten songs uncomparably appealing. Leads, rhythms, and keys lay out a well-rounded and well-executed collection of songs, that inspire and instigate listeners to react to every lyric, note, and beat. Though, by no means would you associate The Melmacs with ska, lead singer Bimmi's raspy tones can easily be compared to that of the Intrrupters Aimme Allen. Bimmi, Remo, Max, and Connie have released an album that warrants countless listens and high praise. \"Good Advice\" easily makes my \"Best of 2023\" list.\n\nRancid - Tomorrow Never Comes (Epitaph Records)\n\nIt's mind-boggling to listen to new Rancid recordings in 2023. Yet, here I am, staring at my calendar, doing just that. Rancid formed in 1991 out of the ashes of the short-lived but highly influential Operation Ivy, and this is their first release since 2017. Although \"Tomorrow Never Comes\" doesn't explore any new territory or offer surprises, true to form Rancid navigate through 16 songs that showcase the band's knack for accessible punk tropes. ÃÆÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢Ã¢â¬Å¡ÃÂ¬Ãâ¦Ã¢â¬ÅTomorrow Never ComesÃÆÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢Ã¢â¬Å¡ÃÂ¬ÃâÃÂ features all the signature elements that made you love or hate the East Bay act. Armstrong and Frederiksen still carry the same chemistry that made the band relevant over thirty years after their coming together, guttural vocals meet fast-paced punk leads and rhythms addressing relatable blue collar themes. Not bad. Not bad, at all.\n\nThe Donnas - Early Singles 1995-1999 (Real Gone Music)\n\nThe recent Record Store Day delivered several vinyl releases that caught my eye and eventually took control of my attention, the most notable one being The Donnas' \"Early Singles.\" Whether you remember the Donnas from their major label hit \"Take it Off.\" or for their time as pop punk favorites with independent legends Lookout Records, it is hard to think of them in any terms other than icons. However, if you've been living on a distant planet and are unfamiliar with the Ramonesesqe goddesses, \"Early Singles 1995-1999\" is your chance to get the bands' Cliff Notes, with 14 singles from their early indie label recordings. The Donnas' fast, upbeat, up-tempo sound was, to say the very least, addictive. These fourteen non-LP tracks more than vindicate its $29.99 list price. The covers of Alice Cooper, KISS, and Reo Speedwagon are noteworthy, adding to the energy and bombast of their originals. The record includes images, liner notes, and a whole lot more. Its limited production of only 2,000 copies might impede your ability to get your hands on the gold vinyl version, which will take some serious hunting. However, I've already seen a CD version and hope for further pressings.\n\nAudio Karate - ÃÆÃ¢â¬Å¡ÃâÃÂ¡OTRA! (Iodine Records; deathwishinc.com)\n\nSouthern California's Chicano pop-punk act Audio Karate (not to be confused with the Massachusetts Karate) returns to form with an eight-song collection of rare and unreleased material that, in my case, serves as an introduction to the band and its sound as we await a new release (due June 30th.) These eight tracks from the past serve as an introduction to a band I might have missed the first time. \"Lovely Residence\" introduces the band's sound and style, accurately reflecting pop punk's height of popularity. Loaded with hooks, melodies, angst, and lack of any danger associated with punk rock. Comparable yet not as well known to the many pop punk acts of that era, Audio Karate originally broke up in 2007, only to resurface in 2009. Overall, the songs on \"ÃÆÃ¢â¬Å¡ÃâÃÂ¡OTRA!\" are a good look back on the band's past, engaging and seemingly perfect for a raunchy late 90's teen movie.\n\nMerauder -'93 demo (Reaper Records; revhq.com)\n\nThe continuous draining of the past by long-dormant hardcore bands continues, this time with Brooklyn-based crossover act Merauder. Reissues have become a bank account-draining affair that refuses to release us from the past. This one features four songs, with \"Fear of Sin\" listed as a bonus track. The music might appeal to fans of tough guy crossover or straight-up metal bands with connections to hardcore, such as Biohazard. These songs will always sound awful lacking any personal appeal to someone like me who saw bands like Merauder as a gateway drug to the thug core elements that engulfed the movement.\n\nMerauder - The Minus Years (Upstate Records; revhq.com)\n\nA collection of unreleased studio recordings and the bands' '93 demo (which, by the way, is reviewed separately above.) Each of these is available for the first time on vinyl, featuring frontman Javier \"Sob\" Caprio (AKA Minus.) My reaction to hearing MeraudersÃÆÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢Ã¢â"
