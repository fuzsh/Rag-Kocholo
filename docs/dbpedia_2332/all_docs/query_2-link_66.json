We are humbled to bring you the one and only: Lee “Scratch” Perry and Mad Professor for an exclusive extended set at our beloved Ampere.\n\nLEE “SCRATCH” PERRY VS MAD PROFESSOR + SUPPORT\n\nPresale: €15\n\nAvailable at all FNAC stores\n\nOnline via Ampere ticket shop: https://goo.gl/Fs7NzH\n\n* LEE “SCRATCH” PERRY\n\nLee Scratch Perry is arguably one of the most influential Jamaican-born singers, songwriters, producers and inventors of his time. Born in Kendal, Jamaica, Perry has helped evolve the Dub, Reggae, Techno and Ska genre since the 50’s.\n\nLee Scratch Perry has remixed various versions of popular reggae tracks to create a fusion of sound that stays true to the Dub reggae, ska, rocksteady, jungle, electronic beats. Perry focused on collaborations with other artists early in his career such as Bob Marley and the Wailers, Junior Murvin, the Congos, Max Romeo, Adrian Sherwood, the Beastie Boys, Ari Up, and many others.\n\nIn 1968, Perry broke away from his former record label to form his own label, Upsetter. The success of hit tracks with the ‘Upsetter’ label, opened the doors for Perry to win Grammy awards as well as influence the development and acceptance of reggae and dub music in Jamaica and overseas. In 2003, Perry won a Grammy for Best Reggae Album with the album Jamaican E.T.\n\nIn his earlier years, Perry spent time in England and the United States, performing live and making records with a variety of collaborators. He is most noted for his unique sounding collaborations with Bob Marley. In 1970 Perry produced and released The Wailers track “Mr. Brown” with its unusual use of studio effects and eerie opening highlighting his unique approach to production.\n\nIn 2004, Rolling Stone ranked Perry #100 on their list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time, solidifying his name forever in the records of Reggae music. When asked by the Guardian what influenced Perry’s music, he responded, “Love. To tell the truth and speak the truth. Only the truth can save people.” A popular artist amongst fans of all ages, Lee Perry performed at the 2013 Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in Indio, California to sold out audiences.\n\nPerry’s love for pushing the limits and creating new sounds in the genre of reggae and ska is a truly magical thing to watch in all of his live shows across the world.\n\nHaving hooked up with Mad Professor in 1983, Lee has been instrumental in the re-development of the Dub movement. The two have been touring on and off for the past 32 years, releasing fresh product all the while. Mystic Warrior was the first fruit of the collaboration between the 2 dubologists, and more recently followed Black Ark Classics in Dub.\n\n* MAD PROFESSOR\n\nHe might be called Mad Professor, but he is one of the sanest working musicians around. In his long and accomplished career, this globally acclaimed dub talent has amassed a fine discography that includes many cult albums. He has also worked with the likes of Johnny Clarke and Mikey Dread, Reggae Regular and Ruts DC, all of whom are legends in their own right. Right back in the 80s did Mad Professor build his own first mixing desk and he soon began working with the Ariwa Studio and label on a 12 part album series Dub Me Crazy. With new installments coming each year, they helped establish the Londoner as a real master of the mix, of echo and reverb, of spacious rhythms and dub attitude.\n\nHis crazy use of sound effects and clarity of mixing won him many fans and plaudits, and remixes of acts like The Orb, Beats International, Sade and 400 Blows all followed. And of course so did live shows, which took the Mad Professor to high profile gigs all over North America, Europe, Japan and many places in between. High profile remix work on Massive Attack’s seminal Protection album helped elevate him yet further, and the new century brought with it many more big releases for his Ariwa label, which eventually went on to distribute more than 200 releases in all. Still in demand for shows and studio work, Mad Professor plays cult events like Unsound and Outlook Festival in Croatia and works with the likes of Lee Scratch Perry, U Roy, BigYouth and many more on his ever excellent label.\n\nfor more info and tickets: https://goo.gl/Fs7NzH"
