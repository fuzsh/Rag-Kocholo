        "text": "i would like to get some of my music into some stores: beatport, and juno download…which digital aggregators do you think are good for this?\n\ni use bandcamp a lot these days. use to be selectadisc an actual shop i miss those days ):\n\nThe main thing about Bandcamp, I feel, is you really have to direct most people to your music. Searching for new music on Bandcamp is terrible IMO. I’m not saying you won’t have to direct people on Beatport or Juno, but I feel like there is a way better chance someone will randomly find your music there. Beatport especially encourages wandering that ends up being fruitful.\n\nAt least on Beatport and Juno there seems to be some kind of policing with genre tags. On Bandcamp at least half of what gets put under house and techno is not.\n\nUnless you know the “trick” of looking through other people’s collections on Bandcamp, as much as I like it, it feels a bit like soundcloud–just storage space (pretty customizable storage space).\n\nAt the end of the day I don’t think it matters where you upload your music really, you have to put in the leg work to direct people to it. That is the big thing. I’d spend my time thinking about that.\n\nAnd yea, Beatport and Juno are almost exclusively used by DJs these days…or at least people looking for dance music.\n\nBandcamp’s “Discover” is actually quite nice, given the amount of niche subgenres you can look. But there’s no quality filter… and generally filtering it by popular / best selling / new never really grants you that much gold. I’ve gone through hundreds of pages of “black metal” tagged albums that are not black metal whatsoever. A lot of people don’t tag properly and there’s a lot of litter.\n\nThat being said I have found some really great stuff on there, but it takes work… and there’s so many competing artists and albums uploaded on the daily that you really only get that first day of showing up in searches unless you somehow get a lot of presales on a physical that bump you into a popular page roster.\n\nWith my black metal band, selling physical copies on bandcamp that also give digital sales is probably the only reason that I still get some sales from the search algorithm (bandcamp emails and tells you when you’ve sold a copy through their search function or google).\n\nI remember trying to get my music on beatport a looooong time ago and IIRC you needed to be on some sort of label to get your music on there. I can’t remember - can you just freely upload?\n\nAlso, did you guys hear that soundcloud is now going to start aggregating to spotify/itunes? LoL. fuck, that could be really bad if they keep their awful compression.\n\nYou can not just upload to beatport\n\nI can see this is old topic, but wanted to chime in with a review might t be helpful:\n\nI’ve been with Symphonic as a distributor for a while, and they changed their plans up last year. I don’t fully understand the new platform, but it works where you submit material, and they decide if it gets picked up to handle the release for free, or not. Which usually leaves you to shop the song elsewhere if they don’t accept it. They do however have a pricing service where they will release the track to your choice of platforms for certain prices. Think it’s like .99 for tier 5 platforms, and unto 10.00 to get it on tier 1 platforms. They will also offer to handle a whole slew of service for you, such as promotions, video distribution, fan engagement, rights management, and many other popular services.\n\nIn general, digital distribution doesn’t matter if your music is shit. Not being against anyone, just a general notion. If you go and read reviews on any of distribution services you’ll notice that people say they were “ripped off” or “my music was rejected by some online store”. You’ll notice a pattern here. Delusion-driven individuals that think so good about themselves but they forget to be somewhat good at it and actually qualify as a music artist. Sure you can drop cash and get your stuff out there but be more self-aware of your works and don’t try justify if your music gets rejected.\n\nBackstreet boys for the win…\n\nLol jk\n\nAnyone ever watch the wu tang documentary and how they got a following…looking back I mean some songs where alright…but looking back they had their time…\n\nMe personally I just archive my shit on multiple platforms…and give it away for free because I’m not that good…I just experiment and try to make certain ideas…or try to emulate certain artists in certain genres to challenge myself…most importantly I try to share what I’ve learned with each experiment and document it to help others that are more passionate about being a musician than me…even though I am not an expert…so…yea…\n\nI read that “Ari’s Take” post several times… pretty sure I posted it on the forum a year ago or so. It’s so full of good information about a very complex topic that I came away mostly intimidated and confused… my personal failing… not Ari’s!\n\nThen one day (on another forum) someone posted about changing from Distrokid or Tunecore to RouteNote (it’s right there on the graphic with the others!) he mentioned that RouteNote has a choice of free upload, which takes 15% of revenue! Or a $10 one time ( not yearly!) per track and keep 100% of revenue. Don’t know how I missed that in all those readings of Ari’s take…not paying attention? Information overload?\n\n“Free” caught my attention! I signed up and I’m very happy to see my music on all the major platforms. I’ve been working on claiming my various artist pages… a bit of a chore but rewarding.\n\nI’m most pleased with Pandora! My California Country stuff is streaming all over (yeehaw!) and my Classical stuff is streaming somewhere everyday as well. Hmmm… who knew? The Electronica stuff… not so much… but here and there.\n\nBased on streaming counts my first monthly payout should be in the range of $10 or $20. (Did I mention this is free!?) and I haven’t even started promoting yet"
