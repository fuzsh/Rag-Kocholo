        "text": "est. reading time: 40 mins\n\nThe Age Of Anglo-Pessimism\n\nIt was in 2020, during a confidential Zoom call between myself and the now ex-editor of a prominent music outlet that I first encountered it. After challenging them on their history of anti-blackness they responded first with, the claim that tears were shed in a group session with a work book called \"Me and White Supremacy\". Secondly, that they were the biggest fans of AceMoma.\n\nThis is a peculiar defence. It opens the door to white guilt and claims that white supremacy has been internalised and made aware of. Then comes the variation of \"but my friend is Black\", with the enthusiastic support of a trending Black dance music duo.\n\nThe mindset behind this response was only recently given a name, Anglo-Pessimism, as defined by Mathys Rennela in his piece titled \"Negrophilia in club culture\". Through his framework we can see how the editor displayed the first three of its nine tenets in perfect order.\n\n(1) Ontological bigotry:\n\nAnyone who wields privilege is bigoted towards those who don’t; in particular, white people are irremediably racist.\n\n(2) Acknowledgement is absolution:\n\nAcknowledging that one’s identity or part of one’s identity is irremediably bigoted is enough to absolve oneself from the moral burden of being an oppressor or holding privilege.\n\n(3) Diversity in socialisation:\n\nFailing to develop (para)social relationships with people that one wields privilege upon is a form of bigotry.\n\nThis framework is best explained by the author themselves.\n\nThe focus on Negrophilia, white guilt and visible Black representation has crystallised in what I call Anglo-pessimism, an anti-racist ideology which capitulates to racial capitalism and its institutions, in favour of a status quo. Anglo-pessimism seems very progressive on the surface but it actually ignores the difference between the lived experiences of marginalised people, promotes standardised marginalised identities, and avoids any form of wealth redistribution... It is a framework which helps maintain the same people and institutions on top, while diversifying the workforce at the bottom. In short: Anglo-pessimism is social justice in name only.\n\n(Negrophilia In Club Culture, Mathys Rennela, 2022)\n\nIn the wake of the cultural shock caused by the 2020 Minneapolis uprising against police brutality, white actors in the dance music industry found themselves in the crosshairs. They had to answer previously unconsidered and ignored questions about race, class and privilege.\n\nThe response by those in power was to make concessions that were wholly performative and in reality, changed nothing. Crying into a workbook about their privilege and using the (para)social fandom of Black artists is the last line of defence for inaction.\n\nWe are now in the age of Anglo-Pessimism and so my current assessment of the UK dance music landscape echoes that of the one found in the Technomaterialism manifesto.\n\nLiberal hegemony in the political landscape has led to a reinforcement of representation politics, which favor feckless and anecdotal representation of marginalized groups over an improvement of their material conditions, which would necessarily pass by actual systemic change. White-owned talent agencies using the likeness of Black artists and tokenizing them to show how progressive they are, all while holding a monopoly of the means of production, is not liberatory.\n\n(Technomaterialism Manifesto, 2022)\n\nOne of the most prominent and influential of those white-owned talent agencies is One House, owned by Napper Tandy. It has risen since 2020 from a run-of-the-mill booking agency to managing some of the fastest rising stars in UK dance music. They work with names you will rightly recognise, including: Eliza Rose, SHERELLE, Yung Singh, Ahadadream, SUCHI and Call Super, to name just a few.\n\nTheir rise has coincided with some significant shifts in how the industry works over the last two years.\n\nFirstly, the influence of traditional dance music media has waned, and instead management agencies and artists are more likely to turn to brands and sponsors to propel themselves. This pairs with an increased acceptance in the commodification of the industry by fans of \"underground dance music\" as necessary to artist growth/survival.\n\nSecondly, younger generations are more likely to see forms of discrimination as abhorrent, and are more aware of racial inequalities than ever before.\n\nFinally and unexpectedly, communities, particularly racialised communities, are being given the space and opportunities that they had not been given before. In combination with collective action, they have taken the industry’s concern with neoliberal optics and its scramble for an un-activated audience to muscle in on once gate-kept sectors.\n\nThese changes have been carefully observed by white-owned talent agencies and none have been better at cynically adapting to this change than One House.\n\nAll Under One House\n\nThe Hounding Of Daytimers\n\nDaytimers, the UK South Asian collective of DJs, producers and artists, launched in 2020 with a charity compilation and Twitch charity stream. In the midst of lockdown, it leveraged South Asian solidarity to put on a 48-hour stream of talent from the diaspora and raise money for the Farmers Protest in India - the world's largest protest of collective working class demands in the 21st century.\n\nThis was followed swiftly by the second compilation. These were curated, mastered, illustrated, promoted and shared by South Asian hands. A point that will become important later.\n\nThey received broad coverage from press outlets, the sort of coverage that some previous industry actors were struggling to get. The press were now in a frantic bid to show that lessons had been learnt by supporting initiatives from racialised groups in the industry. Some outlets even temporarily stopped accepting paid pitches by white freelance writers. It allowed the South Asian diaspora to seep through on the BIPOC quota.\n\nThen the \"Yung Singh presents Daytimers\" Boiler Room happened. While Yung Singh came out the star of the show, it catapulted Daytimers and the larger British SA diaspora as participants of dance music culture into the limelight. The benefit of which is still being felt by Daytimers to this day. The momentum and 'brand' recognition by being featured on such a prominent platform mean that opportunities continue to arrive into the Daytimers inbox, opportunities that benefit in real terms, the wider diaspora.\n\nBut occasionally these offers by white institutions begin to border into co-option and subtle agreements to exploit, delivered with a friendly, well-meaning face.\n\nLet's first outline something important. True allyship is in invisible, meaningful actions done without the expectation of reward.\n\nAnything more is a gross overstep that reveals a fundamental unwillingness to relinquish social capital and a desire to exploit marginalised people as a middle man. In October 2020, Yung Singh's Punjabi Garage mix was posted on the Shuffle'n'Swing SoundCloud as part of their mix series. It started to gain a massive following, gathering support through blogs, reposts & word of mouth. Around this time, it became clear that clubs might open up soon, and not one to miss a viral opportunity, One House came calling.\n\nIn the earliest conversations between Yung Singh and Barry Davies of One House in February 2021, the benefits that One House could offer Daytimers were hawked. Senior members of One House spoke to a few of the Daytimers team days after reaching out to Yung Singh about how One House could be of service. This service was, and always is, conditional and in opposition to the model of true allyship. Otherwise, the connections, social capital and opportunities would not need to be agreed upon, they would just be given.\n\nOne House couldn't get a piece of Daytimers because they were resistant to it. At the time this was mostly due to concerns about a collective being treated like another artist on an already large booking roster. For me, it was because I knew what relinquishing the future of Daytimers to white middle men would mean. So instead they used the self-interest of artists and the promise of stardom to pull individual talent into their pool and now, without the Daytimers name, they could get their cut of the South Asian diaspora.\n\nA key part of that was the use of Josh de Silva, a mixed race South Asian man who is a junior agent at One House. He was the first point man sent to Daytimers. This was done entirely to subdue the concerns around racial dynamics artists like SUCHI and Ahadadream might have had in signing to an agency run by an overprivileged white man. It worked, with one artist saying to me, \"I felt more comfortable knowing Josh was there.\" This, despite Josh de Silva being absent from any community events.\n\nWith Yung Singh they had something that up until now they failed to stimulate through the chain of institutionally white structures. They had now, an activated racialised community at their fingertips, which also allowed them to fake the pretence of community for their other artists more convincingly than ever before.\n\nCommunity Leader\n\n\"Community Pillar\"\n\nThat's how the One House-managed artist SHERELLE was marketed, as she modelled the 2022 Season Arsenal Kit in their social media announcement that couldn't even be bothered to spell her name right.\n\nJust days before, an Arsenal midfielder was accused of rape. (Which was shortly dismissed by the Crown Prosecution Services for lack of evidence.)\n\nWhat does it mean to put a queer Black woman as the poster star for the launch of a football kit during a rape allegation, for a club in a football league that has no openly gay players, because they fear for their lives and their careers? Here One House have engaged in a risky game of liberalism where the marginalised identities of its artists have been used to whitewash the lived experience of those who exist in the sport and the potential of those that come in contact with it. Perhaps the fact that they kept the announcement to just \"Community Pillar\", without ever stating which community that might be, should have been sign enough that this was a bad move.\n\nOr perhaps the fact that the community was not defined is a mirror to the other issue at play. That in the case of SHERELLE and many of One House's other marginalised artists, the ties to community that their identities supposedly represent, do not exist - at least not in the forms that they pretend to.\n\nTurning to the Anglo-Pessimist tenets, we can see a number of points about how the mere existence of a marginalised identity is enough to warrant reward, accolade and achievement.\n\n(4) Blackness is the Rosetta Stone:\n\nBlackness is the blueprint for any marginalised identity.\n\nBlack activism is the blueprint for social justice work.\n\n(7) Empiricism:\n\nMarginalised people have an innate knowledge of their marginalised conditions.\n\nThis knowledge escapes rationalisation and does not need to be supported by any data.\n\n(8) Identity is performance:\n\nAny action taken, word uttered or work produced by a marginalised person is a political statement which impacts their community and reshapes the world.\n\nIt is these tenets that One House banks on when they push SHERELLE as a leading queer Black liberatory activist. But being queer or Black or both does not automatically make anyone a community leader and such a thing should not be tied to the number of press opportunities or gigs your white owned management company have secured. Community leadership necessitates being elected leader by the people you supposedly represent. After all, it is surely up to community to decide, not an artist development manager.\n\nOne House have empirically marketed her as such based on identity alone. This could be mistaken as an individual faux pas, an overzealous marketing tactic in the face of an increasingly neoliberal optics game. But it carries genuinely harmful consequences, as Ari Robey-Lawrence noted in her piece for Technomaterialism earlier in the year.\n\nHyper-visible scene actors with multiple marginalized identities can sometimes become complicit in the erasure and co-optation of the community they identify with, while actively benefiting from positioning themselves as liberatory, activist, or abolitionist thought leaders, and using that as currency in their creative-professional environments. Individuals or groups of individuals with institutional access become hoarders of resources by weaponizing their identity, at the expense of the Black community they claim to represent.\n\n(Sweetheart, All Justice is a Dead End, A. Robey-Lawrence, 2022)\n\nMost importantly when SHERELLE wins, there is no identifiable community structure that benefits as there was in the case of Yung Singh presents Daytimers Boiler Room.\n\nExisting Is Activism\n\nTo illustrate this issue further let me take you to 2019, where I had the privilege of playing Panorama Bar twice. Once in February at Klubnacht and again in September as part of a REKIDS showcase. Neither time did I take a picture outside the venue and neither time did I claim to be the first British Asian to play there.\n\n(6) Existing is activism:\n\nBeing visible in spaces which historically lacked diversity is activism.\n\nBeing the “first one” to enter such spaces is revolutionary.\n\nAnglo-Pessimist ideology warrants that I must make the claim where I can that my existence and being the first one in a space is meaningful, when in actual fact it is meaningless. How does playing Panorama Bar, through the joint support of Laurent Garnier and Su my manager, have any impact on the reality for South Asians also looking to play the prestigious venue? This is at most a personal victory. I do not own the means of success, nor have I made any claim to. The means of success are owned by my industry supporters who have a historical relationship with these institutions. This opportunity is not shared with the diaspora, and so they will receive no material benefit.\n\nWhat's most odd about this strategy is that the dance music industry constantly touts itself as being on the edge of progressive values, ahead of the rest of mainstream society. But even in British politics, the limits of identity have been blown wide open by years of conservative brown faces dolling out policies that diminish the material circumstances of Black and Brown people in Britain. It has proven to be a pointless farce, yet dance music lags so far behind this understanding that the whiplash is lethal.\n\nRacial justice has become about including people of colour into the winners category of the status quo, then using them as evidence that the system works if you are brilliant and hard-working enough.\n\n(Nesrine Malik, The Guardian, 2022)\n\nBut this is precisely the strategy that One House dabbles in with every marginalised artist. As Napper Tandy, its owner illustrates.\n\nEliza is the first female DJ to reach the top of the charts since 2002 when Sonique did it with It Feels So Good...\n\n...An independent music company taking a new artist to the top of the charts with their first single feels like a fairytale but it isn’t.\n\nThis is not a moment, this is a revolution, and we’re in the middle of it.\n\n(Napper Tandy - Founder & CEO of OneHouse)\n\nTeam members towed the Anglo-Pessimist line, highlighting this absurdly niche fact that almost none of the listeners that got Eliza Rose's BOTA to number one in September 2022 would have cared about or been aware of, despite its last minute inclusion in the PR roll out. Simply calling it, \"The song of generation TikTok\" would have sufficed.\n\nThe notion that another overprivileged white man becomes the vector of success for a racialised woman to reach number one is about as far from revolutionary in the music industry as you could get.\n\nWhat is the purpose of spinning every meaningless identity politics trope they can find into something meaningful? In the intro I noted that post-2020, younger generations were more likely to see forms of discrimination as abhorrent, and are more aware of racial inequality than ever before. The key to this is in tenet three.\n\n(3) Diversity in socialisation:\n\nFailing to develop (para)social relationships with people that one wields privilege upon is a form of bigotry.\n\nThis is the centre of One House's strategy. To sell feel-good optics of progress through racialised artists to a concerned, well-meaning white audience, whose white guilt can be absolved through the celebration of entirely performative wins by their (para)social champions. Wins that are meaningless to the material circumstances of the racialised people that are supposedly represented. Wins, that are entirely internalised by One House.\n\nHow can you be anti-black if you love AceMoma?\n\nTokenisation\n\nAfter patiently waiting for the short-lived hysteria of recognising the existence and importance of Black people, the white structures resumed as before. The real gatekeepers of opportunities have created the perfect spectacle, where the people who run dance music venues, curate its spaces, books artists for club gigs and festivals, run the most industry respected PR agencies remain steadfast - while the colour of the front of house is shuffled to accommodate a tokenistic agenda.\n\nThe reality of existing under this spectacle has ramifications for the communities it effects.\n\nI was advised by another South Asian who had experience in the European house and techno scene to market myself as \"The Biggest British South Asian DJ in Techno.\" And to pursue a \"big room\" path, doing guest mixes for BBC radio DJs and the like. This is a symptom of how the Anglo-Pessimist reality limits the imaginations of racialised people. We are handed a reduced scale of success with exploitative tokenism on one end and \"empowerment\" through visibility on the other. We are, in our self-interest, forced to trample over each other to fight for its gaze. A gaze which ultimately finds us as interchangeable as our identities.\n\nIn Yung Singh, One House have found their racialised golden goose. There are few ethnicities from the South Asian diaspora that have the strength in solidarity that male Punjabi Sikhs have. This is down to their immediate visibility and all the hardship that entails growing up in white society, the length of its religious history, and the history of persecution from all sides, both within and outside the subcontinent. Yung Singh has also been a passionate and informed proponent of Sikhs in the music world long before One House swooped in. Because of all of these factors, he has activated a generation of hyper engaged fans from his diaspora, where even the lowest bar of identity politics theory of being \"seen\" is a major win thanks to the historic dearth of Punjabi Sikhs propelled into almost-mainstream youth culture in Britain up until this point. He is pushing the limits of what can be gained from the reduced scale of success. Even still, the core criticisms that Ari Robey-Lawrence make in reference to hyper-visible scene actors remain a concern here.\n\nReal Issues. Faux Solutions.\n\nThese limits of what is possible under the current narrative is perpetuated by industry initiatives to ‘fix’ it. We are presented by its main actors a reduced scale of 'solutions'; nothing radical is ever on the table.\n\nTake for example the \"Progressing Gender Representation in UK Dance Music\" Jaguar Foundation report. In a piece that detailed extensively the risks and abuses faced by non-males in the dance music industry, it came as surprise that the offered solution was to instead put more non-males in danger through a form of self-tokenisation. Its recommendation to artists was an inclusion rider, telling promoters that they should book a more inclusive line-up. This is despite the report having a section dedicated to issues of tokenism and multiple quote excerpts from women in the industry who understood the importance of behind the scenes change.\n\nIts other recommendations for change included equally tepid calls for more music & production workshops, and the equivalent of unconscious bias training on trans & non-binary people so that industry actors might treat them with dignity.\n\nThere are no explicit calls by the report, funded by Sony Music UK, for more women behind the scenes because that would necessarily mean the displacement of established men. However, in the DJ booth as the token support act, where the turnover can remain high, women can fight for the meagre financial pickings between each other.\n\nIt might be argued that this is a first step. But it prevents real change by design, as I will outline later. It also opens up the door for One House, and other male owned agencies to exploit this initiative by presenting artists that fulfil a surface level optics need for promoters with minimal effort. These guys stay winning.\n\nThe solution must be more non-males owning the means of production and creating a system that materially benefits communities. Not a diversity quota. Not something driven by identity alone. Otherwise, it will continue to encourage putting more non-males, and racialised non-males, in danger in the hope that their lived experiences will be the wakeup call for change. Starting with a self-tokenising inclusion rider is the wrong order of operations.\n\nRepresentation is supposed to be reflective of an underlying system. If you skip the change in system part then you are left with a solution that perpetuates a hollow, meaningless spectacle. As Mathys Rennela wrote in Abolish DJ Idolatry:\n\nClub activism and DJ/producer-focused unions fail to tackle structural problems in dance music by not centering the majority of the dance music industry’s workforce. Take for example the very liberal concept of inclusion riders, which only address the symptoms (lack of diversity on line-ups) and not the cause (lack of diversity behind the scenes).\n\nIf change can happen, it has to happen across the whole industry, and not just in highly visible roles. In essence, trying to quantify diversity on lineups and rankings is really an outdated metric, as it only quantifies diversity among a very small subset of the workers involved in the dance music industry. Who are the stage managers, the agents, the bookers, the artistic directors, the light artists, the PR agents...?\n\n(Abolish DJ Idolatry, Mathys Rennela, 2021)\n\nInternally, the hiring of racialised people by One House goes beyond making them appear more attractive to other racialised artists and exploiting them for their owners. It is also designed to defend against valid criticism from those whose understanding of identity politics is more than surface level. This trick has been pulled by the white California investor/tech class for years. Stack your hiring with minority bodies at the bottom of the chain so the group photoshoot looks good, but the actual decision makers and owners are still the same as they always were.\n\nFor the racially diverse staff at One House, they have shown themselves to be deeply seated in the thinking of Anglo-Pessimism. They actively facilitate the cynical plays to undermine their own communities and push liberal solutionism. Actions count more than their identities. This deliberate ethnic meat shield is tissue thin. They work for Napper Tandy. Rishi Sunak works for the Tory party.\n\nAnglo-Pessimism becomes a tool for maintaining the status quo in supposedly progressive spaces, where institutions and individuals feel that because they are contributing in some way, or taking part in a progressive cause that they are beyond criticism. This results in them using their proximity to Blackness and other racialised people as tokens in defence. For a harrowing example about how this impacts racialised people outside of the elevated few, look no further than Ifeoluwa's essay on their treatment within the Bristol scene.\n\nAcross other booking and talent agencies in the same industry, the picture is not much better. I've received reports of racialised workers witnessing the blatant tokenising thinking that goes behind artist outreach. Questions of artistry are thrown out in favour of optics for them to capitalise on. Obviously these conversations are kept secret from the artists once they try to sign them. Almost always these agencies are owned and founded by the overprivileged. It is no surprise to hear that racialised workers also experience racial discrimination by their peers and are bought on developmental schemes with moving goal posts of performance to exploit them.\n\nWhat does it mean for a talent agency in this industry littered with alleged racists, that exploits its racialised workers to have a diverse roster? In the UK, whenever white elite gatekeepers are the owners of cultural institutions, sub-genres of postcolonial exploitation are to be found.\n\nIn summary, the limits of what is possible under the guise of Anglo-Pessimism creates division between communities, fighting on the front line for gigs and being prevented from owning the means of success for the benefit of a larger marginalised group. Tokenising is not only limited to DJs and performers but also to the staff that are bought in to these historically white institutions. The only accepted proposition so far has been the perpetuation of the spectacle of change.\n\nAmong all of this, it feels like we have forgotten why we are even having these conversations in the first place.\n\nA Black Man Died\n\nIn 2018, 26-year-old accountant Botham Jean, a Black Man, came home to his apartment in Dallas, Texas. He wanted to wind down after a long day at PricewaterhouseCoopers and decided to eat ice-cream on the sofa while watching TV. An off-duty officer, Amber Guyer, finished her shift and headed to what she thought was her apartment on the 3rd floor but was actually Botham Jeans' on the 4th, who had left his door unlocked. Upon entering and sighting Botham Jean, on a sofa in a living room that was not even her own, she drew for her firearm and shot Botham in his own apartment.\n\nAmber Guyer would claim in her testimony that the encounter was \"not about hate,\" she said, \"It's about being scared.\" But the murder of Botham Jean by Amber Guyer in his own flat is fundamentally a story about a Black man who is perceived as an outsized threat by a white woman in a space that belongs to him.\n\nSince the murder of George Floyd in May 2020 until the current time of writing there have been 41 more extrajudicial killings of unarmed Black Americans in the United States. Almost all of them are men, and in the rare case when they aren't, women are not the initial target by police, such was the case for Breonna Taylor.\n\nImmediately after, dance music press outlets rushed to retell the history of house and techno and highlight its Black roots. Roots that it had mostly failed to highlight in the decades before to obvious effect. It was a reminder about who should rightly own the space.\n\nDespite all the promises to do better, meaningless pledges and Black squares, this industry's response to the 2020 uprising against police brutality and the killing of a Black man is most accurately summarised in Anglo-Pessimist tenet 5.\n\n(5) Hegemonic gender roles are racialised:\n\nRacialised women will save the world.\n\nAll racialised men yearn for assimilation into whiteness.\n\nIt is the white man’s burden to protect racialised women from their barbaric men.\n\nAcross the industry Black men, and for parts of Europe racialised men more broadly, face discrimination in underground techno clubs. Here they are subjected to increased surveillance from security staff both before and after they enter the venue. Once inside they are subjected to a visible othering, and the only meaningful interaction they’re likely to receive is the incessant request for drugs by majority white patrons.\n\nIn the context of the UK this is particularly dangerous, the Metropolitan Police is consumed by an internal systemic racism and misogyny problem that effects every level of its operations. These same police were given powers to patrol nightclubs in plain-clothes in a government response to the death of Sarah Everard. A woman who was kidnapped, raped and killed by an off duty Metropolitan police officer while walking back from a friends house.\n\nFor artists, this results in Black men having to make themselves into something more approachable to reduce their perceived racialised threat. This is often through constant reminders of their approachability or through queer baiting. This, \"coded\" behaviour isn't exclusive to the dance music industry. But it renders itself quite clearly in the increasingly diminished presence of Black men as artists.\n\nOn a fundamental level, Amber Guyer and the dance music industry share a common idea: that Black men pose an outsized threat that warrants a disproportionate preventative response. In joining with that premise and demonising Black men, they concede to the ideological ground that allows extrajudicial killings to happen in the first place.\n\nIncreasingly racialised women and non-males capitulate to this Anglo-Pessimist premise either through racialised heteropessimism, white feminist theory or a highly racialised understanding of male privilege, without understanding that it is a perverse form of self-hate. Its purpose is to elevate the supposed supremacy and civility of white men as saviours, even when it is clear that misogyny has no racial boundaries in our industry. The colonial tactics of divide and conquer are plain to see.\n\nAnglo-Pessimism warrants that the lived experience of marginalised people can only be understood through the framing of hierarchy - resulting in the most efficient form of performative allyship to be in the tokenisation of racialised queer women. I am not suggesting that Black women have it easier, I am merely highlighting that Black men face a very specific form of discrimination that is different from the queer South Asian, that is different from the trans and so on. However, under its gaze marginalised people are forced to make needless comparison between our experiences, instead of understanding that our experiences are separate and specific to the annals of history as it relates to our identities. Solidarity can be found between us if we understand that we face specific challenges, that when fought together, result in overlapping wins. Ending the demonisation of Black masculinity would impact all racialised non-males that do not conform to a white/western ideal of femininity. The improvement in the material conditions of one will always benefit another.\n\nIn 2020 a Black man died. When another extrajudicial killing inevitably happens again, and shock from its blatant injustice causes the industry to investigate its own relationship with anti-Blackness, One House and other Anglo-Pessimist institutions are poised now more than ever to benefit from Black death.\n\nMaintaining The Status Quo\n\n(8) Identity is performance:\n\nAny action taken, word uttered or work produced by a marginalised person is a political statement which impacts their community and reshapes the world.\n\nThis tenet has been the main load bearer for how the industry goes about the work of maintaining the status quo. With this thinking there is no difference between a South Asian capitalist and a Black socialist, and regardless of community outreach, they both miraculously command the respect of their peers and have something affecting to say. The Anglo-Pessimist weaponises this to create the spectacle of change. Who gets a say on panel talks? Whose voice is most effectively promoted? Under which brand activation do these proclamations of urgency happen under?\n\nThe status-quo thrives due to the encouraged para(social) relationship and ontological white guilt. Under it, we see well-meaning white audiences nodding their heads in approval to any racialised viewpoint and supposed \"win\". Olúfẹ́mi O. Táíwò, associate Professor of Philosophy at Georgetown University observes this as \"elite capture\".\n\nSo the elite capture problem with identity politics as I see it is the fact that some people are using identity politics as a weapon against consolidated group interest, against building solidarity. Using it for representation only.\n\n(Emmanuel Midy, Olúfẹ́mi O. Táíwò - RxC 2020)\n\nOne House's presence is so monolithic that it comes to play an outsized role in writing the narrative of what UK dance music is. For a younger audience entering the space, it is One House artists that are their most likely entry into the scene.\n\nWhen artists are given the choice to sign with One House as a booking agency the question is not usually, should I go with A or B, or do I go with One House at all. Artists, who usually have no bargaining power of any sort are actually presented with the choice, do you want gigs up and down the country, at every festival you've ever dreamed of or not?\n\nThis illuminates something I touched on earlier, that these relationships between booking or management agencies and those who curate spaces, venues & festivals have remained largely unchanged for years.\n\nOne House weaponises identity politics for the benefit of its owner and to the detriment of all other marginalised people in the industry. But it also does it with contempt for its well-meaning white audience, providing solutions to their concerns for inequality and racial injustice that is hardly solution at all.\n\nIndividual Liberalism vs Community\n\nIncreasingly we're seeing individual artist-led initiatives making headlines in music outlets. This usually means launching workshops that benefit whatever 'community' an artist's individual identity most closely aligns with. Community in quotes here because there is very rarely an identifiable structure directly related to the artist in question; it is through identity alone that assertions are made. This is evidenced when earlier One House-managed artist initiatives couldn't get enough of the artists' supposed 'community' onboard, so had to open it up to people outside it to fill out spaces.\n\nThese artist-led solutions and attempts to flirt with feel good personal brand optics often require assistance from outside facilitators in combination with brand partnerships. On closer inspection these initiatives find themselves limited in length and scope. There are no real attempts to distribute a meaningful ownership of success to their communities or to exist for long term development.\n\nSince the launch of Bandcamp Fridays, One House has managed to get their foot in the door with what I would call faux-community compilations, once again centred around an individual artist and not a community. Any other association is purely branding. Their markings are obvious: relatively few tracks, or padded with \"allies\" because they can't find the community members they supposedly represent. Often they're linked to big brand western institutions whose work or initiatives on closer inspection is ineffective but is a safe recognisable choice.\n\nAt first glance this appears to be a spurious complaint, regardless of length, scope and level of sponsor - these initiatives are surely a good thing? But this limited thinking is how management companies get away with cynical optics plays, increasing their artist value in an environment where performance is more valuable than change. Spotlighting individuals as saviours is itself a technique used to disarm real solidarity movements.\n\nIn a 1963 televised panel discussion, Malcolm X cautioned against the very idea of Black entertainers’ leadership on social issues, as their class interests do not necessarily align with those of the Black working class. Nearly sixty years later, Black entertainers are still expected to be community leaders, in industries which exploit the entertainer-turned-activist narrative.\n\n(Negrophilia In Club Culture, Mathys Rennela, 2022)\n\nThere could be a thousand artist-led initiatives and still marginalised people would be no closer to owning the means of their success in this industry. This is by design and illustrates the limits of individual solutionism.\n\nOne House, by using the individual artists that it controls rather than the community that it couldn't, creates two issues.\n\nFirstly, privilege and whiteness begets social capital, which in turn begets access to funds. As deliberate white middle men they surely understand that under the rules of White Supremacy, their very presence in the culture space is detrimental to the real and active marginalised communities that they pretend to care about.\n\nSecondly, community systems will always have much broader points of access than individuals. By focusing the role of uplifting community to artists it narrows the benefit to those who have proximity to individuals and limits effectiveness to individual reach.\n\nOne of the most fascinating aspects of Daytimers as someone who has seen its working from the inside, is its ability to cater to the needs of people within its community are far beyond any individual's capacity. In the space of two months there will be multiple charity drives by members for the floods in Pakistan, or for food banks, solidarity posts with political movements, workshops giving people the confidence to create their own media, evenings dedicated to poetry and spoken word from the diaspora, festival stage takeovers giving DJs some of their most formative experiences, multiple radio shows across multiple stations, bespoke shows in London's most prestigious spaces - the list goes on.\n\nMarginalised artists that rely too heavily on the co-option and support of white institutions to amplify themselves will miss their intended audience entirely. You cannot procure a racialised, or even marginalised audience through institutions owned by the overprivileged. The result of this reliance is in headline shows that have to ramp up the list of 'allies' in support as ticket sales don't hit expectations, or just half empty venues entirely.\n\nThere are a host of communities in UK dance music that exist outside the Anglo-Pessimist gaze that have been built through decades of sweat. I investigated the impact that a lack of coverage on Black and Working Class communities means in part two of \"A Letter to RA\" . Here I noted the ineffectiveness of the press to represent anything happening on the ground.\n\nWe can see how specifically in the case of a community that was largely oblivious of systems their white middle class peers had access to; How valued you are by the press, as awarded by the amount of coverage - bears no relationship to the communities value, as awarded by the number of gigs. Or in other terms, the press’ coverage bears no semblance of reality compared to actual scene activity.\n\n(Measured: The Scale Of Ignorance, 2020)\n\nIs it any wonder that these same institutions can't speak to any marginalised community of any sort?\n\nFor those communities their growth depends on real groundwork, constant outreach and fostering of relationships that cause a meaningful tangible benefit. It is through the group effort of private DMs, group chats, locked off Discords and Slack groups, private emails, texts, late night calls, and Google meet discussions that these grassroots communities are formed. These actions cannot be sufficiently replicated through shortcuts, through optics and through white-institutions that do not represent your communities' interest.\n\nYou cannot sustain a community through the tenets of Anglo-Pessimism. White guilt, Blackness alone, immutable identity as achievement and corporate sponsors form the weakest foundations. There is no brand partnership on the planet that can accelerate real solidarity. Only the iron will of traditional forms of solidarity can hold the weight.\n\nMy advice to any marginalised person looking to find their place in the dance music industry is not to seek out individual performers that match your identity, because ultimately their wins mean very little materially to your lived experience. Instead, seek out a real community that represents your interests and work with each other to uplift, educate and develop a mode of working that doesn't rely on the co-option of the Anglo-Pessimist.\n\nConclusion\n\nOver two years after the cultural shock in the summer of 2020. One House and other talent agencies have learnt nothing about the principles of true allyship in the wake of George Floyd and instead have sought to co-opt racialised communities and take a cut from racialised labour. On top of this they fabricate the spectacle of community as a form of personal branding and serve their racialised artists as absolvers of white guilt. Through 'Artist-as-saviour' rhetoric they undermine the activities of real communities and promotes tokenism that, in turn, limits the spectrum of wins for all racialised people. They weaponise identity both externally and internally to act as meat shield to criticism, whitewash brands and to profit from Black death.\n\nAt the end of the year One House look to reach the final stages of clown make-up application, launching their \"Manifesto\" in the Mecca to white cultural commercialisation, London's Shoreditch House. Given Napper Tandy's understanding of the word \"revolution\" we can expect liberal feel-good solutionism dripping in Anglo-Pessimist mentality. An elevation into white light for their racialised chosen and maintenance of the status-quo for everyone else.\n\nBeing white does not automatically make you an Anglo-Pessimist, and being a racialised person does not stop you from internalising its dogma. But the key boundary preventing white self-declared progressives from unlearning its behaviours is tenet 9.\n\n(9) Achieving equality is a corporate-style exercise:\n\nStructures of oppression can only be atoned for and dismantled through corporate-style procedures: it is through scripted dialogues, listicles, reconciliation and complaint management processes that true equality will be achieved.\n\nTo truly rid themselves of this thinking it requires them to be radical. For the overprivileged, whose divide in class interest is so vast, this is incurable, as the current status quo benefits them so greatly.\n\nA lot of what I've written here will be deeply uncomfortable for many people. To find out that your thinking and actions, swayed by the dominant conversations around race and privilege, are actually steeped in a faux anti-racist ideology is defeating. But there is an inevitability in this step, this con, this last final defence against change. It is the last breath of a dying system.\n\nFor those who read Negrophilia, this piece hopefully spells out the justification for its closing lines.\n\nThe social justice focused segment of this industry has no intention to challenge this status quo. It pursues a feckless and self-serving assimilationist agenda which perpetuates the lie that it is possible to change dance music institutions’ from the inside. Industry actors appoint obedient Black community leaders to shield themselves from criticism. Institutions have perfected the art of “raising awareness,” without ever getting anywhere near any action which would lead to structural change. Anglo-pessimism is the new normal.\n\n(Negrophilia in Club Culture, Mathys Rennela, 2022)\n\nWe must surely imagine a place where in UK dance music, something that started as a movement of genuine community and solidarity between working class people, can elevate itself beyond the self-interest of individual liberalism. No single individual should encapsulate the culture.\n\nAn individual has two arms while the community has many, and while one hand may not know what the other is doing, it can be certain that all parts of it are working to an aligned goal. Working through these structural communities is the only way for marginalised actors to gain power on their own terms.\n\nHere I propose a model for communities that works to counter institutional narratives and progress to own the means of production in the industry.\n\n1. Own The Means Of Success\n\nPreserve gains in capital made by individual members, so they are shared with the rest of the community. This includes social capital (emails, contacts, opportunities) and financial capital (cut of earnings from bookings of top artists).\n\n2. Educate & Archive\n\nPreserve the history of collectives that have come before and share the importance of solidarity movements to anchor the collective in a political grounding.\n\nShare knowledge that allows members to be best equipped against the Anglo-Pessimist and serve the interests of their community.\n\n3. Solidarity Union\n\nJoin with other grassroots collectives to share social capital and resources.\n\nJoin in collective action that amplifies each other.\n\n4. Aggressive Expansion\n\nTake the lead on opportunity sourcing, and intercept the Anglo-Pessimist. Avoid middle men facilitators wherever possible and reject conditional help.\n\n5. Externalise Community\n\nIncrease the activity and impact on the community you represent outside the cultural industries through collective labour and action.\n\n6. Attack\n\nPublicly shame institutions that maintain the status quo. PR and narrative is the weak foundation on which they are built on. Once that is gone they cannot survive. People who act in self-interest will naturally fall in line when you provide no other reasonable avenue.\n\nAs mentioned at the top of this piece, Daytimers started out with very political intentions.\n\n“Everything we’ve done to date is a form of protest, that’s the only way you can get to be on any sort of level playing field.”\n\n(Rohan Rakhit, The Guardian, 2021)\n\nIn an incredibly short amount of time I have witnessed a unity in the South Asian diaspora that just two years ago I would have cast off as pure fiction. The model I outlined above is already here, it has already been tested, and is already working. Daytimers is not without its problems and its own internal struggles, but those are its problems to solve and learn from, there is power in ownership of all things.\n\nTo close, a scene from recent memory. I am at a Mehfil, an evening of spoken word and poetry run entirely by members of the community as an offshoot of Daytimers. The work of many South Asian hands is evident all around me. Above, projected visuals of Mehfil sites from the subcontinent evolve over the course of the evening from day to night. The balconies are decorated with a specific arrangement of hanging fabrics that mirror the muted tones of traditional ceremonial garments. The topics covered through the art of performance range wildly from Islamophobia, dhal & rice, loss & grief, the rights of Iranian women and reflection on privilege. The event has steadily grown since 2021 and is now in its largest venue yet, Conway Hall near Holborn. Its promotion is possible through the tireless work of everyone who contributes to the awareness of Daytimers as a collective. Before the intermission two bansuri flute players and a complement of traditional instruments remind us of Bollywood films we were made to watch as children. I am looking around at the joy on the brown faces across from me on stage, all around me on the balcony and below in the stands. It is packed and the sound of South Asian hands coming together for applause is resounding. It continues, for so long and with such unrelenting force that the flute players become overwhelmed with gratitude. I look around once again, among the cacophony of community. The Anglo-Pessimist gaze is nowhere to be seen.\n\nFinally,\n\nI can breathe again."
