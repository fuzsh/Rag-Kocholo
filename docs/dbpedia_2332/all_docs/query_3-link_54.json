After 7 years playing bass guitar and low brass in school and garage bands, he found something unexpected in the bins of a local record store. The album was µ-Ziq vs. The Auteurs. It didn’t follow any of the standard rules of music in structure or sound. He was so intrigued, that he traded his bass for a MIDI keyboard and started recording electronic music on his own.\n\nIn 2001, Osiris teamed up with Michael Manahan (from Starseed) and Isis Indriya (from Seelie Court) to create The Oracle Gatherings – a series of 23 themed events based on a new original tarot deck (oracelgatherings.com). For nine years, this series became an influential component of the West Coast “Tribal Underground” dance music culture by combining the experiences of cathartic dance, performance art, education, and the expressions of spirit. During this period, Osiris released his first full length album “Reach Within”, which included music written for Oracle Gatherings ritual performances.\n\nWHITNEY FIERCE https://soundcloud.com/thump/whitney-fierce-breath-deep-love-triangle-mix\n\nRefinery29 says, “[this girl’s] about to break, big time.” Perhaps this is one of those moments when you should believe the hype. After cutting her teeth as a DJ in NYC, Whitney Fierce joined Hercules and Love Affair as a vocalist and touring member. Shortly thereafter she sang their DJ Kicks single “Release Me.” Upon returning to LA Whitney reunited with her first love, DJing, and has produced her first solo EP which is being released on Rock It Science Laboratories. Fierce also laid down guest vocals on Subb-an’s new EP Vapour Trails on Crosstown Rebels, co-produced and did vocals on the lead single for Eric Sharp’s last RIS Labs EP “Wait Just Wait,” and has a string of collaborations in the works for the near future.\n\nIf you haven’t heard of Whitney Fierce yet, the coming months may prove her impossible to ignore. She has played for Dior in Paris, Nylon in New York, the Mayor in LA, and is New Order’s tour DJ. Fierce is also quickly racking up club and festival plays as the word spreads about her sophisticated style. On the decks, Fierce blends her background of classical musicianship with a powerful flair for the eccentric, bearing sexy bangers pumped-full with catharsis and a stylish humor that basks in the dance-floor madness. She is very proud to play non-shitty tunes, and is still stoked about not being universally hated. Also, important people say she’s cool (aaand that’s the point at which you should probably start questioning the hype.)\n\nJOSE MARQUEZ\n\nhttp://soundcloud.com/jose-marquez\n\nLos Angeles DJ/Producer Jose Marquez’s musical influence is a result of being brought up on a stable diet of Latin and World Music.

Being exposed to what can arguably be called the beginning of the electronic music genre, Willy soon gravitated towards electronic music pioneers such as; Kraftwerk, Brian Eno, and Giorgio Moroder. As techno started to hit the states in the early nineties and the rave era began in Los Angeles, Willy was soon exposed to the electronic wizardry of musicians like; Orbital, Derrick May, Doc Martin, Steve Loria, Francois Kevorkian, Electric Skychurch, Moontribe Artists, and a long list of others. It was in this furnace of music and innovation that Willy’s love for techno was thus galvanized. After numerous events in both the deserts under the full moon and hundreds of inner city events, Willy soon found himself enamored with the spirit of the out door parties and the rampant tribal techno being played to the hardcore fans who braved the trek out into the lost highways to find the techno oasis. As the decade of the nineties began to near an end Willy began collecting techno and house vinyl in hopes he could soon rock a dance floor as he had been taught to in the deserts and warehouses of nineties L.A. From that point on, Willy Electronarcosis has followed his passion of music and has fast become one of the rising stars emerging from both the So-Cal and Nor-Cal underground dance scenes, meanwhile rising as well in international communities around the globe.\n\nTHEE ROCKAFARIANS\n\nJamaican Psychedelic Raggae Band\n\nBio Coming soon..\n\nBLOOMING FIRE\n\nhttps://soundcloud.com/blooming-fire\n\nBlooming Fire is a family of seven best friends based in Los Angeles, collaborating on a music project unrestricted by genre.

First picking up the guitar at age 3, he studied music theory through jazz and classical guitar extensively for the next 15 years. Throughout his teens he played in psychedelic rock, metal, punk bands. Finding it difficult to find dedicated musicians to make music with, he found boundless creative freedom in producing, experimental hip hop, downtempo, and house music. Inspired by experiences in the desert, his psychedelic, often glitchy and off-kilter beats take more from IDM, jazz, math rock and industrial music than traditional dance music, and can go from dark, moody psychedelia to playful, bongo driven grooves, often within the same track.\n\nDAVOID\n\nhttps://soundcloud.com/wierd-phish\n\nTraveling monthly up to California for desert gatherings, and spending summers at festivals, Davoid attuned his musical taste to that of the underground house world which drew his focus to the deeper side of house music.
