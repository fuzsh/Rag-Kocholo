How did it all start? Who was the first guy who said \"Holy shit, this buzzing, spitting, throbbing, pulsing din of an inane sequence of noises that might arguably call itself music sounds totally awesome on ecstasy!\" And what made him do that?\n\nBut maybe I'm getting ahead of myself. To try and pinpoint the exact origins of electronic music, you first have to look at how it's made. Because as amazing as it sounds, electronic instruments did not always exist. The vast majority of them are barely more than 20 years old. And it's not like you can just pick up a sampler, synth and drum machine and jam away. Unlike conventional music, electronic music isn't played, per se. It is PROGRAMMED. So any study of the history of electronic music is really a study of its programmers--that is, the people who make the machines that make the sounds that make the music what it is. Without some guy tinkering with diodes and transistors, electronic music is just a fancy, lifeless hunk of junk. Just sitting there. Not doing anything.\n\nBecause of this, more than any other music medium, electronic music thrives on technology to make it what it is. And moreover, to make it better and different than what it was. Other instruments have remained largely unchanged since their original design centuries ago, but electronic music is constantly evolving and changing its sound with the application of technology. A new oscillation, patch or filter could take it in an entirely new direction. It is the one form of music where the equipment manufacturers have probably a greater control over the final musical output than the artists. Acid wasn't invented by a musician, it was invented by Tadao Kikumoto, creator of the Roland TB-303 Bassline. Without the 303, there is no acid. Without Kikumoto's fucked up design schematic, there is no 303. Up until recently, electronic musicians were practically at the mercy of the designers who programmed the sounds into the machines. In a way, the instruments don't make the music, the instruments ARE the music. It's a very Macluhanesque way of looking at things, I know, but trust me: It all makes sense.\n\nSo what was the first technological apparatus that kicked things off, then? Well, to answer that question, we have to go all the way back to.....\n\nMIDI\n\n1982 was when it all began. Yes, 1982 was the pivotal year that electronic music crashed into prominence. Nothing happened earlier than that. And it was all due to the creation of a single, ingenius invention, one of the most celebrated collaberations of collaberaters in the standards-fractured world of electronic equipment: MIDI.\n\nIt stands for Musical Instrument Digital Interface. It's pronounced \"middy\". At least, that's what I've always called it. It is both a language and an operating system, a protocol and a standard all in one. It could even feed the dog and put the kids to bed. What it is NOT, as dumb computer users have come to think of thanks to stupid Geocities pages, is an audio format. It is not a cheap, tinny, low size form of audio like MP3 or WAV, you idiots. Those .mids you see aren't actual music. They just contain instructions of what kind of notes a MIDI-enabled device (like most computer soundcards have a crude version of--yes, that 8-bit noise you hear) should play and how to play them. I'm going to say this again: MIDI IS NOT AUDIO, dummies. It is like sheet music. For computers. It tells computers how to play music. And it was around long before annoying famewhores ever thought of embedding it in their obnoxious, head-decapitating webpages.\n\nMIDI was a revolution in electronics manufacturing. It was a landmark idea during an age where standards were fragmenting and computer companies were coming out with different languages, protocols, applications and operating systems every day. All the electronic music equipment manufacturers--or at least all the important ones, anyway--decided to put an end to all the compatibility issues by coming together and hammering out a single, solid, ever-dependable universal standard protocol. Once and for all. Under this standard, it didn't matter if your drum machine was from Roland and your keyboard was from Yamaha and your effects processor was from Akai. MIDI made them work together, talk to one another, get the band back together and not be so pissed off that the lead singer ran off with their girlfriend.\n\nMIDI ushered in an age of uber compatibility across the board. Everything, from samplers, sequencers, software, synths and effects processors could simply be hooked up to one another via two simple to attach cables (one to send data, one to receive it), and work together flawlessly, with little to no hassle, turning the electronic musician into an orchestra. But the best part was what they did next: they released the MIDI spec into the public domain, liberated it from proprietorship, thereby allowing every piece of equipment made afterward to adhere to its standard. This would be like if Microsoft made Windows free and public, and EVERY PROGRAM EVER MADE, past, present and future, for Mac, Unix, or even Amiga, Wang or Commodore 64, would work under it. Without fail. Damn. That would make computers so much more awesomer.\n\nMIDI also allowed one other important thing to happen: continuous music in video games. Before MIDI, injecting sounds into video games was often difficult and expensive. Audio was notoriously large to inscribe digitally, and early cartridge systems like Atari and Intellivision barely had the room to squeeze much more than a few blips and bleeps into their games. With MIDI came a much more compact way to shove sound effects and music onto the games. Because remember: MIDI is not audio. It is simply a series of text instructions. And text, as we all know, is far smaller than media. So when the new generation of Nintendos and Genesis' came around, they had MIDI soundbanks hard-coded into their consoles, all the carts had to carry were instructions of what music to play and how to play it. And there you go--streaming Super Mario Bros. music for a fraction of the size. What a brilliant idea, eh?\n\nSo now you understand why the electronic music industry will always triumph over the computer industry, because the computer industry is dumb. And it all started in 1982, with the creation of MIDI, that allowed electronic instruments to hook up with one another, and finally free themselves from the bonds of you filthy humans.\n\nHEAR Stupid Geocities MIDI music\n\nMinimoog\n\nWait. Scratch that last bit. 1970! Yes, 1970 was the year everything started! That was the year Bob Moog--the eminent electronic music equipment manufacturer at the time--teamed up with Dr. Evil to create the Minimoog, a synthesizer that was every much as awesome as his original Moog Modular....only one-tenth its size.\n\nThis was important. Like all things electronic, everything tends to start out really fucking big, and then get smaller as time goes on. Moog had been making synthesizers since 1961, the only problem was barely any of them could fit inside a room. Therefore, the only people who had access to them were bigwig recording studios and people with lots of money but little to no musical talent. Or transexuals. And don't even get me started on the learning curve, which consisted of studying the original design schematics to figure out how to turn the things on (only to learn that they required 1.21 gigawatts of electricity). When they actually managed to produce a note on key--which wasn't often--they usually blew out 30 vacuum tubes in the process, and then everyone had to evacuate the room, because the smoke was toxic.\n\nThe Minimoog changed all that. It was small. You could carry it through a doorway. You might even take it on the road, which is why Pink Floyd didn't start becoming a listenable live band until they could take their studio sound effects gizmos on tour with them.\n\nBut most importantly, it led to a revolution in electronic equipment manufacturing that was paramount in making electronic music accessible to a whole class of people who wouldn't otherwise be exposed to it. I'm talking, of course, about black people. And this is really important in electronic music's development, because up until now the genre had been completely dominated by white people. And not just white people, but the squarest of the white people. White people who were even too white for white people. Mostly scientists, mathematicians and Parisian experimentalists. People so stuffy, pretentious and intellectual, for them getting down and boogeying was picking a nickle up off the street.\n\nThis sounds like a broken record, but once again the brother saves humanity from turning into a race of boring dunces. While Italian futurists and musique concrete tards were busy patting themselves on the back about how insipidly genius they thought their cat-strangling atonal compositions were, jazz and soul musicians picked up the Minimoog and immediately found its raw edgeyness to be something quaint and funky. The low-fi sounds of these quirky analog boxes led to one of the most endearing electronic samples of all time, courtesy of the Ohio Player's Club: The Funky Worm. From there came Herbie Hancock and George Clinton, always game for futurism, but not futurism the way the french and italians envisioned through stiff intellectualism and mathematic precision, but rather a weird, warped future full of funky freedom, camp sci-fi themes, and operatic space sets featuring an alien mothership descending upon the world to drop DA BOMB on y'all. Oh yeah. Make mine the P-funk.\n\nFrom here, things would only get better, and by better I mean blacker. There are lots of great exceptions, but generally white people just suck at making electronic music.\n\nHEAR The Funky Worm\n\nRCA Mark II Synth\n\n1955!! I forgot about 1955. Now, 1955 was the year of electronic music's genesis. I mean it. For real. Forget everything I said before. To find out where electronic music came from, you need to go all the way back to the year 1955, for that was the year that RCA commissioned Harry Olsen and Herbert Belar to come up with something wacky and wild to do with the burgeoning electronics industry (something that had stalled in technological development since the 30s until space aliens crashed in Roswell in 1947 and the government absorbed their technology, which led to rapid advancements in science like plastics, neon, transistors, and Dick Clark), to which they did. They came out with something they called the RCA Mark II Synthesizer (there was previously a Mark I, but it was a stupid thing that no one used and no one remembers having existed. Kind of like Streetfighter 1).\n\nThat was the first time anyone had ever used that word for a piece of musical equipment. Synthesizer. They called it that because it was the first musical instrument that was meant to emulate or \"synthesize\" musical sounds. Also, they called it that because Synthesizer just sounds so awesome and futuristic, like a favourite delicacy enjoyed by robots in the year 2340.\n\nThis was an incredible feat. Before then, if you wanted a piano sound, you had to actually get a piano. If you wanted to hear a trumpet or a drum, you had to hire a trumpetter or a drummer. The concept of virtualizing music through artificial means just blew people away. It wouldn't take long before Synthesizers started becoming self-aware and roaming through the streets of LA looking for Sarah Connor. Eventually, they just said \"fuck this shit\", stopped reproducing existing sounds and started making their own, in ways and manners that no existing musical instrument was capable of doing. Like the sawtooth waveform. Mmmmmmm.....sawtooth.\n\nThere were some problems though. For one, the thing was the size of a bus, and secondly, in order to program notes into it you had to use punch cards, reel-to-reel tape decks, ludicrous speed, masking tape, Unix v0.1 in Assembler and four different forms of karate to get it to belch out anything. And when it did, it was hardly music. More like an annoying whine. Still, what it proposed was promising. It just wasn't useful for anything yet. But hey....even Superman was only capable of lifting a car when he was a kid.\n\nBut it did do one thing really cool: it allowed you to make your own music as you composed it. It was an analogue, real-time beast that took four men to operate, but everything was real and instant. Serious music composers had never done anything like that before. It's unfortunate that the only people who got to fiddle around with it were boring stiffs who like to take all the fun out of music.\n\nSynthetic Speech\n\nHold on a sec! Since we're looking for the REAL origin of electronic music, it only makes sense that we go to the source--the guy who actually coined the term \"electronic music\". And for that we have to go back to 1949, where Werner Meyer Eppler wrote one of the most earth-shattering essays in 20th century music: \"Electronic Tone Generation, Electronic Music and Synthetic Speech\", outlining the freaky future that popular music was about to undertake as a terrifying warning to all mankind.\n\nSpeaking of which, allow me to go on a bit of an aside here: What was with all these brilliant eggheads in the 40s foretelling the future with such grim accuracy? Maybe they were tipped off by the Roswell aliens or maybe--due to the fact that just a few years earlier they had figured out how to blow the planet to kingdom come and were feeling awfully proud of themselves for it--they wanted to do something that would REALLY fuck us up (like nuclear bombs didn't impress us enough. No, really guys. What, were people saying \"Pshaw, Any eight year old can slam plutonium particles together and release a biblical amount of energy. Try again, fuckheads.\" What more did they want, rocket cars and an atmosphere on the moon?).\n\nAnyways, it's pretty strange to see a whole bunch of post-war visionaries--some scientists, most not--accurately predicting future living, complete with technological advancements and all. You got George Orwell, who wrote \"Politics and the English Language\", detailing the perils of political correctness 50 years before it was canonized. And you got Vannevar Bush, who wrote \"As We May Think\", which foretold hypertext, miniature cameras and the rise of the internet. Yeah, this guy fucking predicted the motherfucking internet at a time when there were only six computers in the entire world, and four of them only knew how to decode secret Nazi messages, store recipes, and decode secret Nazi recipes and store them. There was also Aldous Huxley, who warned about the \"assembly line-ation\" of life, harbinging the era of suburbanization and consumerism. A society of Nostradamus', I swear. Why aren't there people like this today? Where are today's visionaries? Was the war generation simply smarter than us? They were certainly better at killing one another.\n\nAnyways, Eppler took his ideas to Bell labs, and came out with what he called a synthetic speech encoder...or a Vocoder for short. And then he went on tour talking about his amazing ideas about this new thing called \"electronic music\", because everything at this stage was simply theoretical. Like the guys above, nothing they talked about was technically doable yet. But it would be, if they sat around long enough, shut their eyes tight and put their fingers to their temples, and willed it to happen.\n\nSo there you go. Werner Meyer Eppler. The founder of electronic music.\n\nElectric Organ\n\nActually, that's all wrong. What am I thinking, electronic music didn't start in the 1940s. Stupid me. It started in the 1920s! Yeah. 1929, specifically, is when the first actual keyboard synthesizer was built by Edouard Coupleux and Armand Givelet, only they didn't call it a keyboard synthesizer, they called it the \"Givelet Electric Organ\", because it didn't have any preset samplebanks or patches or ADSR envelopes or noisegates. But it did have oscillation! Though the oscillation was controlled by paper rolls, like those automatic piano players that have been around since the 1800s, only these paper rolls could control more than just notes. They instructed electronic circuits to control pitch, tone, colour, loudness, and even note articulation. It was a breakthrough in organ technology.\n\nThis might have gone down as the most important electronic instrument of all time, except for one thing: four years later, a non-descript company called Hammond, working on a similar premise, released their own electric organ, and the rest is organic history, hahaha. Sorry, bad joke.\n\nBy the 60s, Hammond had advanced their product into the B-3, also known as the greatest organ ever made. The skill, quality, competence, and craftsmanship that went into that thing was so extraordinarily high that if Hammond ever tried to re-release the B3 today, it would run retail of somewhere around $60,000. Ahh, but parts and labour were cheaper back then, and for a brief, blissful golden age, it was the king of the somewhat electronic music devices that could actually make decent music. Attach one to a Leslie Speaker, and you got the greatest electronic sound before there was electronic sound. It was certainly better than whatever the musique concrete guys were farting around with. Dumbasses.\n\nOrgans are all about size. The bigger the organ, the fuller the sound, the more awe-struck the illiterate church-going masses are when they enter the cathedral, striking real wrath-of-god-like fear into their feeble, mortal minds. Hehehe. But when digital technology came around, it kind of made the art of making really fucking big musical equipment rather pointless. Maximizing acoustics was replaced by the raw power of sheer amplification, and when that happened, organs ceased to have a place in this world. It was like bringing a trebouchet to a fight against a tank--it doesn't matter how good or how big you build that thing, it's not going to win.\n\nBut it started here. With the foreknowledge that electronics could improve and probably replace the boisterousness of the gigantic organs. Boy, were they ever right.\n\nHEAR the Hammond B-3\n\nTheremin\n\nHold on, that wasn't when electronic music started. Go back even earlier, to 1917, when Leon Theremin, a Russian, invented a device that was so fucking weird he couldn't really name it after anything already existing or even anything futuristically existing, since it was so beyond the future, it was like in a parallel dimension. So he named it after himself: the Theremin.\n\nWhat made the thingamajigger so weird to begin with? Well...for one, you didn't have to touch it to play it. It responded to your body movements, and if you wiggled your hand around in the general vicinity, it would respond accordingly, using your body as a reception receiver. Kind of like the old days when the television set required antenna to pick up signals, and you had to stand in a special spot in the room for crystal clear reception, or else the bloody thing wouldn't work. Secondly, the sound it produced was a completely analogue, real-time, high-pitched alien-like whine, like a microphone feedback squeel, and because it depended on YOU to stand still to play any notes of any discernible length, it tended to waver off a lot because, well, no one can stand completely still. So due to your erratic movements, the thing squiggled around a lot, and I mean a lot, making it sound like a garbled radio frequency dial oscillating to all hell and back. But at least it was electronic.\n\nBecause of its unpredictability, music composers couldn't really think of anything useful to do with it. The thing was unpredictable as fuck. How do you even begin to write music for a device like that? Theremin demonstrated the device to the 8th Soviet Congress, thereby allowing secret Theremin technology to fall into the hands of those diabolical communists. Of course the Americans couldn't stand to let there be a Theremin gap, so they raced furiously to find their own Theremin boxes and to frantically find SOME thing to do with them. The answer came 30 years later, in campy, B-grade, pulp sci-fi movies about Evil Things What Come From Outer Space (Klaatu barada nikto and all that), where the Theremin's utterly bizarre noise was perfect for describing the mysterious and the foreign (and the Russian).\n\nBut perhaps it's crowning achievement was when the Beach Boys insisted on using one for their 1967 #1 hit Good Vibrations, which took over one year, three different recording studios and twenty different versions of the song to complete because the blasted Theremin was so god damn inoperable. Brian Wilson, fed up with the thing's unresponsiveness, appealed to Bob Moog, telling him to build a more user-friendly one so that they could finish the stupid song already. Moog complied, and the end result is what you hear on \"Best of...\" Beach Boys compilations today. They should have released the others as remixes.\n\nSo here's to the Theremin: the most frustrating musical instrument of all time, and the first entirely electronic instrument, ever.\n\nHEAR The Theremin\n\nTelharmonium\n\nOkay, so that wasn't the first electronic instrument ever. But I think I got it now. The first electronic instrument was invented in 1897. For real this time. I'm sure of it. 1897 is when it all began. Nothing earlier. For it was in 1897 that a little thing (which, of course, was anything but little) called the Telharmonium was developed, by a guy named Thaddeus Cahill.\n\nHe originally called it the Dynamophone, and it took ten years for him to actually get a working model up and running to produce any sounds, but he filed the patent in 1897, back when he came up with the idea, and by that I mean back when filing a patent for your ideas was more important than actually doing anything about them.\n\nI'm not making this up: The Telharmonium was 200 tons, the size of a hydroelectric power station, and was operated with large levels and gear shafts. It had a massive keyboard with something like 36 keys per octive. 36-key scale! Who the fuck would want to make music with a 36-key scale?! It also had gigantic rivets and pistons and valves and steam coming out of solid iron smokestacks above it. It was truly a masterpiece of steampunk engineering. Amplifiers did not exist back then, so the only way to hear whatever grinding noises it made was to hook up one of those new-fangled telephone things to it and and put the receiver next to your ear. It was like the first Walkman. A Walkman that you could actually walk inside, instead of taking it with you. They later figured out how to play it for rooms of audiences by attaching a megaphone to the telephone receiver. So the sound it made was like a really old, 8khz crappy analog phone conversation. Like someone talking into their fist. This is not ghetto. This is seriously genius stuff for the Victorian era.\n\nIn all, three Telharmoniums were made. Being the size of battleships, it took a couple years to build each one. Each one was bigger than the last, too. Everyone was obsessed with size in those days, so they had to be. The last one was finished in 1911, where it promptly hit an iceberg in the North Atlantic on its maiden concerto, taking over 1500 listeners to a watery grave.\n\nThey were going to build more, but production was halted by the first World War, and then Thaddeus' ultimate evil master plan of brainwashing the world by filling the telephone airwaves with seductive Telharmonium music, commanding the filthy peons to do his bidding, was thwarted by a much more insidious technology that filled the masses' heads with far more potent drivel: Radio. With the rise of radio and amplification technology in the 20s, the Telharmonium's purpose was rendered moot, forever resigned as the Beta of the electronic music family.\n\nToday, no recording of what the Telharmonium must have sounded like exists, though if you want a general idea, just pick up any generalized Hammond Organ. It was built on the same principal. The last Telharmonium was sold as scrap in 1950, because no one wanted it. Not that they'd want to. Where would you find the room for such a beast, and what would you do with it after the novelty wore off? I guess donate it to some kind of electronic music Hall of Fame museum, if one exists. Does it? Shit, someone should apply for a grant for something like this. It would be awesome! I say it should go in Detroit, because.....well, who's going to argue with that? (shut up, Chicago)\n\nMusical Telegraph\n\nDammit, I forgot about 1876. The year everything changed everything. 1876 was the pivotal year that not just electronic music, but electricity and electric inventions in general, would be introduced into people's lives. I've been looking at this all wrong.\n\n1876 was important for two reasons: the first was Elisha Gray. This guy got to the meat of the matter, of what makes electronic music electronic. First, he developed an electromagnetic circuit that discharged a sound. And then, getting the thing to self-vibrate, he made the circuit produce continuous sound. Through careful manipulation using steel reeds (and magic music gnomes) he figured out how to control the tone of this sound, thereby creating the first, basic note, single tone oscillator. This was extraordinary for people who just discovered what to do with electricity a generation before. All that was needed at this point was a simple interface--attach keys to the steel reeds, and viola...the first actual instrument that produced sound entirely via electrical means. He called it the \"Musical Telegraph\" or \"Harmonic Telegraph\" or the \"Electroharmonic Piano\". Jesus, what's with these staunch, stupid-ass latinized Victorian names. The \"Teleharmonocinematagramaphone Electroacoustinoscillating Instrumentality Thing!\" Hadn't any of these guys ever heard of marketing? I would've called it the \"Super Space Piano of Doom\". For leisurely sporting purposes of a gentlemanly kind. It would've sold much better. But where did he get the idea to make this self-vibrating electromagnetic circuit thingy in the first place?\n\nHe had it in his back pocket for awhile, he just wasn't sure what to do with it. Originally what he was trying to do was figure out a way that, if controlled right, he could use it to make human speech itself travel electronically through a wire to somewhere miles away where someone else could hear it. Far out, eh? He called it the telephone, and he had the idea all laid out, and was all ready to head down to the patent office to claim his role as genius inventor of all time, except he was beaten--by mere hours, no doubt--by Alexander Graham Bell, who kind of beat him to the punch because Bell already had a working model up and running. His wasn't even theory.\n\nBut Bell wasn't interested in electronic music, so he sucks. Who doesn't suck, however, was Thomas Edison, who was tinkering around with those very same vibrating circuits and steel cylinders, only instead of trying to figure out how to send sound from one place to another, he figured out how to inscribe it onto a physical surface. Like a book. Only with sound. He called it the Phonograph, and it showed up a year later, in 1877.\n\nThat was something no one had ever seen (I mean heard) before. Before 1876, if you wanted to hear music, you had to hire someone to play it. Go to a concert, a live show, rock out, and all that crap. Rave your ass off. There were no downloading mp3s. There was no mixtape trading. All music was live. It was impossible to hear a recording, because the concept of recording music didn't exist. It's a good thing all the classical composers formulated a way to write their compositions on paper, because without the presence of recordable media, all that shit was gone as soon as you heard it. You couldn't play it back or save it for later.\n\nYet these masters of sound changed everything in 1876. After this year, it was possible to record, play back, stop, move, shift, transport, edit, and manipulate sound to your hearts content. Nothing was out of the realm of musical possibility at this point. Edison and Gray's inventions led to more durable formats of music compacting, stretching, looping, taping and mashing, bringing about the Italian futurist movement, the dadaists, musique concrete, the first ever commercial tape manipulating hit music that charted in Ross Bagdassarian's campy Alvin and the Chipmunks, synthesization of sound and, ultimately, sampling. The totality of musicality in sound. And it all started here. In 1876. For real this time.\n\nClavecin Electrique\n\nActually, electronic music's origin was really in 1761! Because it was in 1761 (or somewhere thereabouts) that Jean-Baptiste de Laborde invented the Clavecin Electrique, or \"Electric Harpsichord\". It was more like a kind of a clavichord, only the clappers were charged with static electricity to ring the bells. Don't ask me how this works, it's got something to do with baroque mysticism I think.\n\nAlso, in 1761, Johann Maelzel came upon the brilliant idea of creating the Panharmonicon, which was the first mechanical keyboard that, although technically not electronic (it ran on diesel fuel) automated the playing of all the other instruments in the orchestra. Maelzel then went on to design a universal spec for the Panharmonium by which every musical instrument everywhere could adhere to, so they could be hooked up to one another for universal control and compatibility. Where trumpets could play drums and violins could play clarinets and that sort of stuff. He called it Medieval MIDI, and it was a revolutionary concept for the time, but despite its endorsement by larger-than-life composers like Beethoven, it wasn't received too well so Maelzel would have to wait another 200 years before his dream of hooking every instrument up into the Voltron symphony would be realized.\n\nAlso, in 1761, Benjamin Franklin invented the glass harmonica, which has nothing to do with electronic music, but it's a pretty useful fact to know in case you're ever on Jeopardy someday.\n\nAnd Mozart composed his first symphony in 1761. Of course, he was five years old at the time and his song probably sucked ass (I mean...come on. I wrote my first novel when I was eight. Not that it was any good), and besides, he had help from the evil Earl of Darkwood, kidnapping music prodigies from the 5 5ecret 5tar 5ystems in his quest for immortality.\n\nSo yeah. 1761. The year it all began. I know I've said this before, but I mean it this time.\n\nPascaline\n\nOkay, so I didn't mean it that time. But that's because I forgot about something that happened earlier: In 1641, mathematician Blaise Pascal, obviously upset at being in Renes Descartes' shadow all the time, attempted to invent something new and unusual that no one had ever thought of before. So he studied things like differential calculus and probability theory, eventually coming up with the Pascaline, a calculating machine which didn't make noise, unless you consider the clickity-clackingness of its adding algorithm to be music which, if you ask the musique concrete guys, might very well be. It was, by all accounts, the earliest (albeit crude) known example of digital logic (though it wasn't digital. More like analog logic). The forerunner to computers, and thusly, electronic circuits and instruments.\n\nPascal would then use this knowledge to go on and create the Pascal programming language, but his idea fizzled out at the starting gate because there were no computers around for him to demonstrate it on. There weren't even any wall sockets for him to plug a computer in even if he had one. Though I suppose he could cruft together some hacks using a whiteboard and a sharpie, but those didn't exist either. And it's not really fun writing programs on paper. Man, was he ever ahead of his time. Just goes to show that timing is everything. War geeks always talk about how cool it would be to take a modern army back to Ancient Rome and see how they'd kick ass in a battle with the infamous legions of Scipio, but what would you do once you ran out of bullets and gasoline? The only supplies a phalanx needs is food. Without the infrastructure necessary for advancement, upgrading and upkeep, nothing modern would be of very use to past civilizations, despite what time travel movies suggest.\n\nSo there you have it. 1641. The very first time anyone had even conceived of the concept of electronic music. Without having to delve very far into electronics or music. There is no possible way anything could predate this.\n\nHydraulis\n\nActually, as timelines would have it, there is (sigh). In the third century BC, Ktesibios, a Greek engineer, studied pneumatics and hydraulics and managed to come up with a water-controlled organ that he called the Hydraulis. Using an intricate system of levers, switches, and sacrificing the first-born to the Gods of Olympus, the Hydraulis was the first device that enabled someone to play more than one instrument at the same time.\n\nThe Greeks also invented the Aeolian harp, which was the first automatic instrument that played music without needing human input. I suppose they could have also invented sequencers and trackers to get the thing to play what they wanted, but they didn't need to. They simply set the strings at a prescribed pitch and let the wind blow through them, creating music. Essentially, the thing was a nothing more than a dressed-up, fancy, multi-tonal whistle. Big fucking deal, guys.\n\nAnyways, the Hydraulos was really keen for its day, because it allowed for harmonic complexity and fullness of sound. What makes it electronic music, you might ask? Well....they used water. And water, as we all know, is a deadly absorber of electricity, so it all makes sense in the end. Organs were ultimately the first synthesizers anyway. That's why all modern synths have a keyboard as their native control panel, and not, like....a series of strings or bagpipes or something. Though electronic bagpipes would be pretty keen.\n\nSo. That's it. The origin of electronic music. Over 2000 years ago. Amazing how far we've come.\n\nAcoustic Tribal\n\nOkay, fuck everything I just said. The real inventor of electronic music was Grog, who in 65,000 BC started banging his stick against a rock in a rhythmic, synchronous repetetitetitetive motion, thereby producing the first tribal track. And what, pray tell, is so electronic about that? Well....he was struck by lighting at the time. It really gave an analogue warmth and fullness to his sound.\n\nThere. Have I done it? Is this the end? Are you satisfied now, you sophmoric, pedantic fucks? Is your precious little electronic dork IDM history now complete for all to recognize the timelessness of your pompous, \"forward-thinking\" music? Are you pissed off that I left out the Ondes-Martenot or that I snubbed the mighty Ondioline or Heliophon, and you can't wait to send me a snobbish, pretentious email decrying \"CONTINUITY ERROR! CONTINUITY ERROR!\"?\n\nYou know, sooner or later you conceited tools are going to realize that it doesn't matter who made what or how it came out when. The purpose of music is to have fun and enjoy it and identify with the culture that does, not to flaunt your oh-so-deep and sophisticated air of superiority like a snivelling, skinned-knee school kid who got picked last for kickball. And when that happens you're going to want to stop with the intellectual bedwetting, or else we should just keep on going and just admit that electronic music started with the motherfucking Big Bang so we can pride ourselves on how brilliant and genius we think we are (yes, that means you, Tobias).\n\nWe gotta draw the line. Where is that line? I don't know. I don't care. I think this is the first timeline I've ever seen that actually goes backwards, though. Hey, howabout that.\n\nClockwise, from top-left: Pierre Shaeffer, Lee 'Scratch' Perrey, Herbie Hancock\n\nNow, as for the music itself....pay attention to this part, because I'm only going to say this once.\n\nAll electronic music that exists today originated in three principle nerve centres: The Caribbean (Jamaica), the American Midwest (Detroit and Chicago), and Western Europe (France, Italy and Germany). There are other hot points that have contributed lots of good things along the way, like Japan, India, Great Britain, Scandinavia and other areas of America, but chiefly these are the Big Three.\n\nThe Caribbean fermented reggae and dub, introduced MCing, exported rapping to New York where it promptly became the most popular music in the world, kickstarted dancehall and DJing, and was the womb of the Breakbeat and Jungle sections of this guide.\n\nThe American Midwest enriched us with jazz, soul, RnB, funk and blues, morphed into electro, merged with hip hop, toyed with disco, championed the 'black gay club' aesthete, combined all-night dancing with ecstasy, and was the flowerbed of the Techno and House sections of this guide.\n\nWestern Europe cultivated electronic instruments, attracted freaky arthouse intellectual scenes like the futurists, dadaists, existentialists, and beats which all which helped found post-modernism, developed minimalism and musique concrete which transformed into industrial, created spacey film soundtracks, ambient and krautrock, sent disco to America and promptly took it back when America got sick of it, and was the test tube of the Trance, Hardcore and Downtempo sections of this guide.\n\nThere. You got all that? Now that you know where it came from, it's up to you to decide where it goes. There is no beginning or end to this thing. Simply dive into the genre of your choice and explore for yourself. That is the purpose of music, after all.\n\nThere it is. The wheels of steel. The #1 prime application by which all music is mixed. Plug two of them into a mixer and you got yourself a very expensive hobby. This sumbitch has yet to be largely improved upon since its inception in 1972. Yeah--that's 30 years of being the undisputed, dead solid, ever dependable standard. Eons in an age where technological advancements are just fleeting excuses inbetween more technological advancements. So why is it still preferred after all these years? Because its built like a fucking tank, that's why. I've seen Tech 12s dropped down whole flights of stairs, fallen off balconies, off moving cars, get hosed on, puked on, bottles broken over, set on fire, even buried under 3 feet of sand--and still work flawlessly. The Technics SL-1200 turntable is more reliable and loyal than the family dog. Likened to the AK-47, it was built to last. It never jams, never breaks down, rarely needs maintenance, and its design is so stupidly simple (3 buttons, a knob and a slider) everyone in the industry knows how to use one. It has an average lifespan of 10 DJ careers. You could drop it in a river of molten lava and it would still work. When other tables might sputter or crumble to pieces if you even touch them, the Technics platter can be pushed, back-spinned, stopped, slowed, and manually manipulated to your hearts content, and it will always bounce right back to its regular speed. This durability allows people to practically play it like an instrument, as its solely responsible for the rise of hip hop and DMC battles, and the Disc Jockey as a self-contained musician in his own right.\n\nYes. The sound that launched an entire cultural movement. Given that this device was originally intended to sound like a bass guitar, I would say that the engineers completely missed the mark. And that may have been the best thing that's ever happened to music. This little box (only 30cm long) makes the First Sound of Electronica, and the loveliest, most versatile sound of all time: acid. Through proper tweaking, it can be warm, cold, stiff, funky, dark, happy, soft, fuzzy, trippy, screaming, squelching, driving, pulsing, rubbery, or anything you've ever possibly heard of (and even things you haven't). It can be smooth and bubbly, like a drinking fountain or boiling hot springs. Or it can be cold and mechanical, like an automotive assembly line on the bridge of the Star Trek Enterprise. But perhaps the most important thing about its mutated, alien-like din is that its really really cool to listen to on drugs. That combination--warped acid music and amphetamines--has gone on to spawn the greatest single form of all-night recreation yet conceived of by man.\n\nThe infamous drum machine responsible for techno, electro, and the entire decade of 80s music sounding all tinny and raspy. The problem with the 808 is that it doesn't sound anywhere close to real drums (was it trying to?). It doesn't have a bassdrum--that sound you hear is just bass, something so deep it makes the cat run around the house in utter confusion. And what the hell is that ticky noise? Is that electronic twerp supposed to be a cowbell? Christopher Walken would not approve. These don't sound anything like.....well, like anything. Yet somehow, this machine released soulless, mechanical hell upon an unsuspecting music industry and, much like all the other equipment detailed on here, was rediscovered well after the company discontinued making them by an electronic arm of musicians who consider those quirky noises happy accidents.\n\nHouse, trance and techno start here. The 909 is the yin to the 808's yang. Where the 808 is tinny, mechanical, raspy and twitchy, the 909 is heavier (physically and sonically), deeper and fuller. The standard setup is to employ the 909 for the groove, and the 808 for the percussion. The 909 doesn't have a bassdrum--that's just a weird thud emanating from the box that has launched a million dance records. Stick a guitar distortion pedal on it and you have hardcore. Add some decks and effects and you have Richie Hawtin. If there's one great signature sound about this beast, it's definitely the handclaps. The 808 may have the cowbell. But The 909 is ALL about the handclaps.\n\nThe Winstons were just a soul/RnB group with one hit record: a single in 1969 called \"Color Me Father\". So what, you think. A one-hit wonder because you wonder how they got the one hit. Yet it was the B-side of that single that contained something strangely extraordinary: an instrumental called \"Amen Brother\" that was all about its spastic drum solo. And when I say 'spastic drum solo' I mean wave your arms in the air like Grover, make some noise, and get ready fo' da rewind, Boh! My Selectah! Yup. That's it right there; the infamous Amen Break, staple sample of every breakbeat and jungle producer's arsenal. Without this, junglists would not exist.gasp God forbid!\n\nIt's not even a very good or popular track. It certainly didn't make any compilations or \"Best of...\" lists years later. It was just standard James Brown fair, him doing his thing like only he can. It sounds like a track he probably made in the span of about 5 minutes, while making breakfast one morning (\"Makin' some hotcakes....gots ta flip 'em over....gots ta flip 'em over...gots ta flip 'em over....hotcakes! Smokin'! With tha bacon on the siiide! aiiiigh!\"). Near the end, however, is a very special moment where he tells the band to shut up and just listen to what the drummer is doing. Something very monumental, he notices. A catchy drum riff that years later would propel hip hop and breakbeat to the heights of the music world, and make James Brown the most sampled man in the history of music. For sample-happy artists like The KLF, there was only one thing to do then: snub the Godfather of Soul and rip off Gary Glitter instead. For the rest of the rap world: you niggas owe the hardest working man in show business your bling bling. All of it.\n\nMost every popular sound in electronic music has come about because of a mistake. Nothing is ever made in this music scene deliberately or through conscious, premeditated effort. Everything is discovered by accident, used because it sounds cool, becomes popular, and is ripped off for other tracks, crafting entire genres in their wake. The hoover is the jetfighter wooshing, beehive buzzing, race car driving wall of sound made popular by the Roland Alpha Juno series of synthesizers. Hell, on the Roland Alpha Juno-2 it's listed as Patch-86, titled \"What the...\". Early on, was referred to as Mentasm or Reese after popular tracks and producers who employed it, but the name that's stuck after all these years is the one afforded by the lowly vacuum cleaner. Ha ha ha.\n\nThe Master of Ceremonies first got his start as a conductor of sorts, introducing the musical talent and becoming the host of the party. The practice started off fairly benign in--where else--Jamaica, where the MC would add his voice as a freestyle adlib singer, becoming part of the music. Then it was exported to New York where it became Hip Hop, and as time went on Hip Hop MCs decided that they were more important than the music, and then later on declared that they were more important than everything. Jungle and Breaks MCs tried to do the same, with limited amounts of success and bravado. But the important part to remember is that an MC is not supposed to transcend the music or even compete with it. That's when everything goes to shit. The original Jamaicans didn't do that. They understood that the object was to liven the party atmosphere, not to become the centre of attention. They were simply Toastmasters, which is something that modern MCs rarely do anymore. Toasting. I like that word. Who toasts anymore? It seems like every freestyler today is trying too hard to be some sharp-tongues, insult-armed \"lyrical assassin\" rather than someone who actually wants to improve the quality of the party.\n\nStandard Business Professional Service Enterprise Multimedia Epress Deluxe Special Epansion Advanced Championship Edition Suite Version.5 Build r23\n\nThis guide is a non-technical, irreverent critique of electronic dance music.

It's also the simplest, the oldest, the warmest, and where electronic music is concerned, easily the most human-sounding, making it the most popular, commanding the most producers, artists, labels, DJs, fans, and subgenres. The whole of top40 pop music gets its hooks, gimmicks, lines and melodies from house music (and vice versa). That is why it stands as the world's perennial party music, and it will probably stay that way until the end of time. Or until someone finds a more catchy beat than the 4/4 bassdrum.\n\naka: Party House, Uk Hard House?!?!? Good God, No in the Hard Dance group, emerged in 90s\n\nPretty interchangeable with Nu-NRG, except where Nu-NRG is hard and driving every once in awhile, Stupid House (better known as UK Hard House for reasons unknown as it sounds neither hard nor housey) is just retarded. It's probably the offbeat bass stabs that lend credence to its defining 'stupid' sound. And the horn fanfares, making it sound like silly circus music. And the crowd cheering samples, which make it seem cheap and gimmicky. But where other party music (Happy Hardcore, Eurodance) has a self-aware, tongue-in-cheek affability, Stupid House here legitimately tries to pass itself off as something serious and genuine. Like actual contentious music. A chip-on-its-shoulder, more-hardcore-than-thou ethos, something so laughably ridiculous even Gabber House looks cooler in comparison. Pretending to be what it's not makes this whole genre fraudulent and insulting to those who just want to have a good time. And that's before you see how the kids dance to it. Stupid House is the bargain bin of electronic music. It also encompasses those signature-melody tracks that are always packaged in 'BEST CLUB ANTHEMS EVER' compilations, like The Launch, which are the musical equivalent of junk food.\n\naka: Jazz House in the Funk group, emerged in 90s\n\nThis genre is to House music like Superman is to the Superfriends: indispensable. Everything that other House genres can do, Deep House does. Sometimes better. In fact, this genre IS House music. It encapsulates everything House music is supposed to do, supposed to sound like, supposed to make you feel, to a T. If there was no Deep House, House just wouldn't be House. Deep House is the sound that holds the whole genre together. There are several sub-sub-genres of this, all of it good, including Mark Farina's own special brand of Mushroom Jazz. One of my favourites is a really swanky, soulful sub-sub-genre tentatively named (meaning, called only by my friends and I) \"Dad House\", because it always evokes images of your father walking around the house in his bathrobe on a Sunday morning, reading the paper and smoking on a pipe. Well, mine anyway.\n\naka: Gay Disco House in the Funk group, emerged in 90s\n\nOf course House wasn't going to leave Disco alone. Even if every track samples the same riff from Change - \"The Glow of Love\". This is easily the style of music that has the most fun. If there was an official gauge of how much fun something is, Disco House would score off the chart. If there was a country in the world called Funia, Disco House would be its national anthem, as well as the name of its capital city. Everyone would be free, easy, super and gay (that's gay as in happy and fun, not gay as in lame and stupid). I was once walking down the street late one night and a hooker called to me from the curb, asking me if I was looking for some fun. \"No thanks, Miss,\" I replied, pulling out a pair of headphones. \"I've got Disco House, the most fun there is.\" She nodded completely in agreement. \"Word. Be on your way, then.\"\n\naka: Filter House, Tekfunk in the Funk group, emerged in 90s\n\nIn the mid-90s, House was in a major funk. And by funk I mean it wasn't doing too well. Yeah, the primo dance music of the world was struggling with what to do next. Nothing was inspiring, records were weak, a real lull was apparent. And then along come these pretentious Parisian students (oh, but aren't they all pretentious? It is the French, after all. Saying they're pretentious is like saying fat people are overweight). Anyways, along come these French students, who took house music out of its funk by putting it back into the FUNK! I mean it: they literally turned the entire fucking industry on its ear overnight with their special brand of 70s/80s electro porn music house. Stuff so filtered, so funky, and so fresh, they just had to call it French. If anything of value has ever come from France, it's this music right here. At this point, you can't NOT deny the genius that is Thomas Bangalter. He is the only reason why the world does not sack France.\n\nin the Funk group,\n\nYes, officially sanctioned by the Department of Redundancy Department, it's Funky House! Since when is House Music not funky? Well, when it's doing something else, I guess. Still, this and Deep House are easily the strongest genres, because they encapsulate best what House music represents: groovy soul. Well, I suppose there's a Soul House genre somewhere as well, but for the time being all soulful house gets squeezed into here. Or Vocal House. Point is if you aren't moving at least ONE PART OF YOUR BODY RIGHT NOW (even a head bobbing), then you just don't get it. House music is not for you. Go pick up a craft project or something.\n\nin the Funk group,\n\nAnd arguments can be made that there is very likely a strain of House for every cultural identity in the entire world, of which Latin House is probably the most proficient since there's so much of it. So until Hungarian Accordian Latvian Mandolin Tapdancing House music makes it big and cracks the top10 a few times, they don't warrant inclusion on this guide. I'm already splitting hairs much too unnecessarily anyway.\n\naka: Stadium House, Arena House in the Europop group, emerged in 90s\n\nI suppose The KLF are to be responsible for this, when they released their 'Stadium House' trilogy in 89. But more or less Anthem House is really just the less-used, broke-ass cousin of Anthem Trance, evoking images of 'hands in the air' cheering about positively nothing in giant soccer stadiums and british superclubs with thousands of other people who would normally be annoying the hell out of you if you weren't on such great drugs. Gang vocals, cheering noises, and catchy melodies. This is the kind of music that's like really rich chocolate: tasty in small doses; will make you sick to your stomach if you're inundated with too much of it. Trance crackers, take note.\n\naka: 'Dance Mix' in the Europop group, emerged in 90s\n\nPretty interchangeable with Eurodance and Epic Trance, except for one idiot feature: the abject rape and decimation of fine 80s tunes and classic ballads by making trite, derivative \"dance\" mixes of them. Stupid. Just stupid stupid stupid. Listening to these tunes makes you yearn for the originals way more than you'd ever want to dance in a club to them. From \"Total Eclipse of the Heart\" to \"Keep Me Hanging On\" to a cutesy version of the Hamsterdance song (yes, I said HAMSTERDANCE, fuck dammit. Go P2P for it yourself, and brace yourself for the horror of horrors). If there is any redeeming feature of Epic House that exists, I haven't seen it yet. This genre is absolutely shameless and without remorse. It is a gimmicky vehicle for cheap radio one hit wonders through upgraded nostalgia, and is completely devoid of originality, substance and value whatsoever. Whoever makes this shit should be shot.\n\nin the Europop group,\n\nWith Jpop and Eurodance as its parents, Eurobeat is truly in a class of its own, with maybe Happy Hardcore as its stupid step-sister. Unlike other genres, Eurobeat knows what its limitations are. It's not trying to save the world or convert everyone over to its spastic, sped-up euro disney cheese. It doesn't foster any illusions about its tweaker formula and erratic sensibilities. And for that you kind of have to respect it. It's role is to be the background music for funny fitness competitions on TV, and it's perfectly happy with that. It's also good wakeup music.\n\naka: Europop, Euro, Club House, Handbag in the Europop group, emerged in 90s\n\nThe reason why it's called Handbag in parts not American is because girly flocks wearing tight capri pants and tube tops or something would colesce in clubs to dance to this music around piles of their purses and handbags on the dance floor. I've never actually seen that happen, but it's certainly believable. Eurodance is the undisputed king of creative cheese: that is, cheesy dance music that is far from annoying. It's dedication to silly, spastic fun, with buff dancers running around and funny raps about dancing, love, and the love of dancing has made an artform out of the lighter side of music. Where other genres in the same vein failed due to their pompous delivery and overblown self-important schmaltz, Eurodance got it right: pop music as it is, was, and should be. Nothing more.\n\nin the Europop group,\n\nThe official music genre of Dance Dance Revolution, this is by far the most syrupy, saccharine music known to mankind. I bet they play this kind of stuff to calm lunatics at insane asylums locked in padded rooms with pink walls. Bubblegum pop so childish, with lyrics so inane and non-sensical that you can't possibly take it seriously, so it's best that you don't. Just keep nodding politely, and step away carefully, with slow, controlled movements. Or the Japanese schoolgirls might sic their giant robots on you.\n\naka: Shibuya-Kei in the Europop group, emerged in 90s\n\nIs anyone even surprised that this kind of stuff would come from Japan? That whole country is like Bizarro world. They do everything we do, just in a really strange way. It reminds me of that scene in \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\" where they go near Toontown, and you can see clouds of smoke and yelling and fighting and all sorts of haywire shit happening above the horizon to signify the complete and total lunacy of the place. Japan is just like that. The whole world continuously scratches its head at the far east, then sits back and watches to see what wacky thing the Japanese will do next. I mean, I'm sure the culture is swell once you get past all the incest and pedophilia and giant robots and all, but after that--huh? Japan is super crazy place, 100 PERCENT! Note: there's actually two forms of Jpop. The faster kind which gives the hardiest Dance Dance Revolution masters a run for their money, which is indistinguishable from Eurobeat, and the more bubblegum kind, called Shibuya-kei. You can tell which is which.\n\naka: Nu Italo in the Europop group, emerged in 90s\n\nNot really an upgrade of 80s Italo Disco, but its made in the same place, so I guess the name is appropriate. Slower, thicker beat than Eurodance, but its signifying and most addictive feature is the VOCODERS!! Love those lovely, oscillating vocoders! You can never have enough vocoders. Hell, the whole reason why most of the songs don't have any actual lyrics but just nonsense human melodies (la da bee dee doo da lee da) is because they sound so cool with vocoders. Rediscovered by Daft Punk legend Thomas Bangalter (the purveyor of everything 80s), used lavishly by everyone in his wake. This genre has had one monster hit: Eiffel 65's \"Blue\", but just because it's way overplayed doesn't mean you should discount the entire genre. There's some wicked-ass stuff here.\n\naka: Diva House in the Europop group, emerged in 90s\n\nThis can pretty much be any of the other genres, really. What makes it Vocal is, well...vocals. Not just any vocals but loud, dominating, high-class crooning ones by diva songstresses. That makes this genre pretty hit and miss, depending on whether the diva is any good or not, or whether she annoys the hell out of you (which can happen with alarming frequency, believe me). For what it's worth, I tend to think that house classics have the best Divas, as the modern stuff has way too much of that insipid octave modulating RnB crap like a bunch of Destiny's Child rejects. Can you just hold a single note for longer than a fucking second, you stupid tarts?!?!?\n\naka: Techno in the Europop group, emerged in 80s\n\nAnd then all of a sudden, without word or warning, electronic music was granted mainstream acceptance and exploded all over the pop charts. It was like a revolution, and everyone hitched onto these power pop tracks with silly raps and cooing divas. Fuck, I remember dancing to Snap! in my grade 7 school dance. The public accepted everything, calling it all Techno for some reason. This genre didn't really have a name--then or now. Everyone called everything Techno so it was hard to place the evolution, origin or progression of any kind of set sound or music. So I put it all in here, and call it Techno Dance, even though it's more Dance than Techno, and not really either. It's a shame that most ignorant people still think of this music when they hear the word \"techno\".\n\naka: Italo in the Eurodisco group, emerged in 80s\n\nThere was a big backlash to everything Disco in America in 1980. In Europe, this didn't happen, so Disco naturally progressed over there to what it had been hinting at for several years: a stripped down, mechanical version of itself dubbed Italo Disco for reasons unknown as very few of the artists were actual Italians. But they all sang in english, which is odd because english was universally a second language to them, as evidenced by the fact that the lyrics make no sense and the vocalists have thick accents of indeterminate origin. Still, despite these shortcomings, the music kicks ass, and is recognized as the world's first completely electronic commercial dance music, predating House, Techno, Electro, and just about everything else. The music is seriously stupid good fun once you get past its dated, tinny sound. I now have ten times more of this music than any other genre. And I might very well start spinning it too. No, I'm serious. You don't believe me, do you?\n\naka: Electro Pop in the Eurodisco group, emerged in 80s\n\nAs in a new sound, a new mode, a new type of apparatus from which to construct, compose, and perform music. What I like best about this period is everyone who picked up an electronic instrument did so because they were already established musicians and composers looking for additions and enhancements and explorations of their sounds. Today, electronic musicians--especially the bad ones--seem to be mostly lazy, uncreative morons who don't know a damn thing about music because they let the sequencer and preset banks do all the work. It's no wonder that the music 20 years ago still sounds way more interesting than it does today.\n\naka: New Wave Part 2 in the Eurodisco group, emerged in 80s\n\nYou BETTER KNOW what this is, otherwise you have no conception of the oddity that people ironically giggle about called \"the 80s\". Taking the explorations of New Wave and the feelgood rhythms of Italo Disco, Synthpop--in all its androgeny--makes as warm a sound as archaic 80s electronic instruments can get. Melodic hooks, pop lines, all the tools of the trade are there, only this time with synthesizers. MIDI definitely contributed to this explosion. And now its undergoing a renaissance due to the almighty power of Retro. But its crowning moment will always be the Carnival scene in Revenge of the Nerds, proving that the geeks and social outcasts were, are, and will forever be the ones spearheading modern cultural movements. I personally feel Italo is way better though.\n\naka: Electro Boogie in the Eurodisco group, emerged in 70s\n\nNot just any Disco, but electro boogie! The synthesized direction Disco was heading after its flame was extinguished by American meatheads. Trivia time: the last Disco track to reach #1? Lipps Inc.'s \"Funkytown\", May 1980. And by then synthesizers and drum machines really started coming into their own, as shown by the track's stark contrast to the big-band, string-section, entire-ensemble disco cuts that permeated radio waves 5 years earlier. Machines allowed making the music easier, faster, and cheaper, but they also brought on a whole bunch of other things. The 80s proved to be the coming-out party for electronic music, as within a year of Disco's infamous backlash everyone, from Reggae (Eddy Grant) to Funk (George Clinton) to Jazz (Herbie Hancock) to movie soundtracks (The Warriors) would employ electronic instruments with glee. As for Disco--it moved to Europe and became Italo Disco.\n\naka: Acid, Oldskool Acid in the Chicago group, emerged in 80s\n\nRaves weren't actual raves until this came along. 1988, the Summer of Love, the Hacienda, Shoom, Heaven, and all that. Well, first they were called acid house parties, then they were raves. The music itself is actually pretty moody and sinister compared to today. We always think of the music at parties to be upbeat and energizing. I think the whole motif of this evil-sounding, mechanical 80s music in dark rooms with minimal lighting and hundreds of people squashed on drugs swaying about like automatons to be quaintly cool. Of course, at the time this must have freaked out the suits. It would've freaked me out too. It's definitely lost its edge since those seedy days. Rave-oriented music now is just too warm, receptive, and pleasant-sounding to give its origins any justice.\n\naka: Chicago House in the Chicago group, emerged in 80s\n\nIt's antecedents include funk, soul, blues, jazz, disco, dub, and sometimes even hip hop, but none of that is here because it isn't electronic (unless specified specifically). Still, no genre is an island, and it had to get its inspiration from somewhere. Like, say someone banging a stick on the edge of a wooden box or something. The music's really been around for 40 years (if you don't believe me, go listen to the Jazz Crusaders), the drum machines just make things more groove-centric. Which is a good thing, owing to the highly-convoluted social phenomenon that was about to emerge from this thing.\n\naka: New York House in the Chicago group, emerged in 80s\n\nAround the same time that gay black people were inventing House in Chicago, gay black people were inventing Garage in New York. It makes you wonder if gay black people in other cities weren't doing similar things, like maybe 'Shack' in Indianapolis, or 'Toolshed' in Des Moines, or the uptempo, swanky, soulful 'Apartment Complex' coming out of Cleveland's urban underground. Where House brings the funk, Garage brings the soul, as it sounds more organic and 'disco-y'. Scientists have still yet been able to figure out what makes its spin-off genres 2-step/UK and that godawful 'speed' stuff actual Garage, since they've both been disowned from conception.\n\nin the Chicago group,\n\nIt's more popular than you think; people are just wack bitches and don't give it their props like they should. Some of your favourite top40 hits you remember getting down to at your Bar Mitzvah or Prom or Commencement or whatever lame dance you thought was cool back in highschool were actually house remixes of rap songs, or rap remixes of house songs, or a forethought meshing of both. Making them Hip House. Come to think of it, most modern rap (Dr. Dre comes to mind) is employing a steady house beat these days. I don't hear much scratching in rap music much anymore. Is hip hop truly dead?\n\naka: Parental Advisory: Explicit Lyrics in the Booty Bass group, emerged in 90s\n\nEvery song will contain one or more of the following samples: \"If you got a bigger booty, come on down and do your duty\", \"Let me see your booty bounce, booty bounce, booty bounce, let me see your booty bounce, booty bounce, booty bounce\", \"Awe girl, you think you bad. Let me see you shake dat ass\", \"Let me hit it from the back, and I give that ass a smack\", \"Face down, ass up, that's the way we like to fuck\", \"Hold up!\", \"Wait a minute!\", \"Uh-oh!\", \"There some hoes in dis house, if you see 'em point 'em out\", \"Whoomp! There dem hoes\", \"Just shake dat ass bitch, and let me see what you got\".\n\nIt seems to be a domain largely of \"progressive\" (read: Brit House) producers who don't want to be too pretentious. More characteristically, though, it seems the whole of western popular music itself has turned very passionate (which is to say, tragic and somber), moody, abrasive and short-fused in the wake of the terrorist attacks, not just electronic music. Even a happy-go-lucky genre like house couldn't help but feel somewhat sinister and serious for awhile. That's where this music comes from. Even if the concept of \"dark house\" is like a water-repellent sponge.\n\naka: Real Hard House, Chicago Hard House emerged in 90s\n\nYeah, there we go. Real FUCKING Hard House. To even remotely hint at suggesting that Hard House is some other kind of limp-wristed pussy circus music makes you ridiculously dumb. I mean it: you are really really DUMB for fostering the delusion that Hard House should be anything other than.....HARD. A distorted 909 bassdrum is what you need. And some courses on how to properly focus your anger management, and hopping around pumping your fist in the air.\n\naka: Minimal House, Glitchy Tech House emerged in 90s\n\nTech House artists decided to expand their sound into ever more monotonous soundscapes when they decided to create Microhouse: A minimal version of itself not unlike Minimal Techno......only housey. It actually floundered for a few years, narrowly escaping a bitter lawsuit with a software company from Seattle, but lately it's been getting a lot of interesting press more or less because the Glitch guys (like Akufen and Matthew Dear) stumbled upon it and began applying it's sparse aesthete to their clicks and cuts. It now doesn't sound half-bad. When it's sounding like anything at all. Why is it called Microhouse? Because it really IS Micro! The kickdrums, the snares, the hi-hats all sound really compacted and tiny-like, unlike the big booming bassdrums of its brethren genres.\n\naka: Progressive House emerged in 90s\n\nAlright, this progressive nonsense has got to stop. You do not make yourself intelligent and creative by using that word. Instead, you make yourself out to be haughty and pretentious. That makes you no better than the french. This goes for progressive rock, progressive house, progressive trance, progressive progress, and even progressive itself. Kill the word already. It means nothing. With that said, Progressive House is a genre originally coined by Genesis P'Orridge to describe the early 90s sound made by artists like Leftfiend (actually, only just Leftfield), which was not quite house and not quite techno and not quite dance. In truth, it really just sounded like house with (then) trancey elements. Not trance with housey elements. I don't know what it meant after that (probably Progressive Trance), but that doesn't mean you can hi-jack the word now and call yourself forward-thinking. Especially since the genre is STILL BEING MADE (the 'X-press 2' track came from 2002, not 1992). There's a lot more to music than trying to look and feel important, trancecrackers.\n\naka: The Worst Music In The World emerged in 90s\n\nHow did this music get past the censors? Who greenlighted this project at the Official Electronic Music Genre Standards and Classifications Consortium? I'm still at a loss as to what it's trying to do. Is it funky? No. Those dulled basslines sound like someone farting into a pillow. Or like the school teacher in the Charlie Brown cartoons scolding some child for his inability to spit, sing and gargle at the same time. Is it soulful? No. Time-stretched vocals never had any appeal, ever. There's no real hook, no real melody. It doesn't even pay any decent homage to Classic Garage. So what the hell is this stuff doing?! Sucking, by the sounds of it. But as bad as it sounds, it has actually managed to find a way to get WORSE over the years, dumping the time-stretched vocals in favour of......you guessed it: those annoying, crooning Mariah Carey wannabe diva hooks. Oh, fucking hell.\n\naka: Electroclash, Glitchcore, Nu Synthpop, Glitz, Euroclash, Synthcore, Electropop, Robotrash, Synthpunk, Futurepop, who knows what else emerged in 90s\n\nYou know a genre is really popular in the music press when it quickly garners more names than it does actual artists or labels. The reason for this is because every major player in the music press wants to lay claim to discovering something so kitsch and trendy by giving it their own pet term for it--a foreshadow of things to come as music continues to fragment into social niches. I am no different, which is why I call it 'Synthtron', because Electroclash sounds like the stupidest name I've ever heard. Though it may more be appropriately applied to the grittier, guitar-infused punk artists (Chicks on Speed, Fischerspooner, Add N to (X), Orgy), I can't see it being a justifiable term for their House-bred contemporaries (Felix da Housekat, Miss Kitten and the Hacker, Ladytron, Adult., Who da Funk, Northern Lite) who are, once again, following the wake of pioneers Thomas Bangalter and Les Rythmes Digitales, who were spearheading this retro 80s trend back in 1996. Heh. Synthpop with upgraded equipment. Who could've seen that coming?\n\naka: Techno-House emerged in 90s\n\nYou'd think that a hybrid genre combining the best qualities of House and Techno would be totally rad, but it's not. In actual fact, Tech House comes out mostly as a dull, monotonous drone (something Tech House was the undisputed king of until only recently, when the technique of making boring music was surpassed by the pretentious Brit House scene calling itself only \"progressive\"), with barely enough going for it to make it interesting. It's like it decided to combine the worst qualities of Techno and House. Why the hell it would do that, I don't know. But it's been around, like, forever, and people keep making it, so someone somewhere has to be listening/buying/dancing/spinning all those Tech House records. I have yet to find anyone though (Tripwire, shut up).\n\naka: Tribal emerged in 90s\n\nI'm probably splitting hairs here by describing each and every flavour of tribal when it could be much more easily sorted out as just one percussive whole, but some people have really narrow tastes, so this guide is not for them. Tribal House is mostly a west coast thing, where we still have trees out here for hippies to hang out in and throw free parties in the forests during the summer (when the weather cooperates). Plenty of bongs and bongo drums for everybody.\n\naka: Dub House emerged in 70s\n\nThis kind of stuff's been around at least for 30 years. Take reggae, remove the lyrics and harmonies. What you have left is what those lovable Jamaicans like to call the dub. Yeah: Dub. Sheesh, sounds like one of those pet words stoners always come up with in their spare time. Add a beat to it and it becomes Dub House. It was the first ever tool for DJs--a groove to lay down under all the anthems and floorfillers--somehow making it a genre in its own right. Now it's influenced everything else as well. There's probably a million and one sub genres of this--ambient dub, techno dub, dub dub--but I'm too lazy to find out what they got going for them. But god bless those wacky Jamaicans and their wonderful detail to rhythm.\n\naka: Uk House, English House, Not Progressive emerged in 00s\n\nIt's almost as if England (and maybe Europe as well) had been collectively stuffing its face full of sweet, syrupy, cavity-inflicting cookie cutter McTrance for 3 years (96-99), and then suddenly got sick to its stomach and threw it all up. Or maybe it was just Britain's major DJs who got sick of the anthem schlock, and vowed never to spin it ever again. And appropriately, where they commanded, the people, like polite little sheep, obeyed. Then Sasha and Digweed and their ilk wanted to be taken seriously so they started moving into...this sound. Whatever you want to call it, it doesn't matter; it serves its purpose, which is to be anti-anthem. And then as if to REALLY show everyone how above-it-all they were, they gave it a really pretentious name out of an adjective: Progressive. Progressive what? Fuck if I know, after 3 years trance snobs are still arguing over that part. Since it means absolutely nothing, then, I'm calling it Brit House, because if anyone could make house (trance?) music this boring and monotonous, it's the British.\n\nTrance is the most emotional genre. It can make you cry, make you shout, make you cheer, and make you celebrate absolutely nothing of substance except pure, ecstatic bliss. This is interesting, when at one time it was very repetitive and hypnotic (hence its label 'trance') and was very easy to get lost in whilst divulging in aforementioned emotions. But now it's quite difficult to get entranced due mostly to the fact that the genre has devolved into such trite, derivative junk that even the biggest culprits of it are having trouble lying about how interesting it is. If you ignore the cliched, breakdown-build-anthem template side of the genre that is so canned and predictable you can set your watch to it, trance is still pretty fun. Unless you're trying to be a Sasha worshipping pretentious snob not partaking in that, in which case you don't even want to admit you're listening to trance anymore.\n\naka: Heavy Metal Goa in the Psy group, emerged in 90s\n\nThere's enough sub-subgenres of psychedelic-goa-israeli-mediterranean-middle eastern trance (ie: anything not euro, which inherently makes it far more interesting) to warrant its own trance section altogether, and in compliance with the true ethos of trance it should very well get one. And maybe someday it will. But for now, I'll just list my favourites and/or most prominant ones. Psychedelic trance envelopes all of that. And Buttrock Goa is easily the best one. Heavy metal and trance go so well together.\n\nin the Psy group,\n\nDark Trance and Death Trance are pretty interchangeable. The only real difference (and it's a minor one...oh, but isn't this entire guide?) is that Death Trance artists seemed to be ported over from Hardcore a lot, whereas Dark Trance artists are ported over from Goa. But not always. Speaking of Goa, this music sounds a lot like it and can be mixed with it really well, and it scares the hippies away too, so it gets the bigthumbs up by me.\n\naka: Hippie Trance in the Psy group, emerged in 90s\n\nFor what it's worth, the only trance genre that still has some integrity left. Goa is just too complicated, too dark, too brooding, and too ominous to ever have popular appeal, and it's doubtful that it ever will....and that's just the way hippies like it. Imported from India, duty free, where it is so hot the DJs don't even bother mixing or else their faces melt off (and that's BEFORE you drop acid). There are a million and one splinter genres to this too (hard goa, progressive goa, psyfunk, ambient goa, etc...), but I'm only putting down the most prevalent. As for the rest, it's terrific stuff, if all the annoying, superficial hindu and buddhist iconography doesn't annoy the hell out of you. Goa would be the best genre ever, if it weren't for the fucking hippies.\n\naka: Psytrance, Psychedelic Goacore in the Psy group, emerged in 90s\n\nThe difference between Psychedelic and Goa Trance is really negligible, and if you ask anyone involved they'll readily say that there is no difference, much the same way that junglists will say there is no difference between Jungle and Drum n Bass (even though there is). To put it succinctly, Psychedelic Trance removes the hindu/middle-eastern influences and melodies and full-on blasts you with mindfuck music...teleport zappers, star trek tweeps, nintendo twerps, theremin squeels, feedback hums and radio antennae frequency squelches. Well...Goa might have all that stuff too. Hmmmm. Let's say this instead: Goa is more organic, and Psy is more cybernetic. But they're both futuristic sci-fi music. Okay, fine: they are the same damn thing. But there's just so much good music here to only squeeze in one genre. And if you think I'm done here, wait until you check out Psytekk. It's like HR Giger on acid.\n\naka: Minimal Psytrance, Augh!!!!!!! in the Psy group, emerged in 90s\n\nPsychedelic Trance isn't total horror. In latter years it actually came to be pretty goofy stuff, with the most bizarre samples inserted, like babies crying, people burping and sneezing, and other avant-garde musical interludes. The less sensible, however, ventured into this sonic territory, and I have to tell you: this is, bar none, the most evil, depressing, gut-wrenching, \"no hope for mankind's impending war against the machines\" music in the world. Like most genres, best--and also best for your acid trip--in small doses. But subject yourself to a whole night of this terror and you'll WANT the madness to leave your head by the morning, and you're damn prepared to end it yourself with your brain firmly smushed into the nearest brick wall. I sincerely think this is a secret government torture weapon that accidently escaped to the public. No one can be this sadistic, can they?\n\naka: Electronic Body Music, Industrial Dance in the Industrial group, emerged in 90s\n\nAh yes, here we go: Electronic Body Music. Almost like proto-goa, in its straight-ahead, buzzing synth aesthete. Industrial's true connection to trance, which is why the rest of the genres kinda got dragged with it in this mangled mess of a music genre node. In its raw form here, it's pretty mean, impersonal stuff. I'm not sure how some people can insist that trance is peaceful, euphoric angel music. That's like saying Charles Manson is the next Mother Teresa. Machines don't have feelings, and neither does trance.\n\naka: Agro-Industrial, Post Industrial in the Industrial group, emerged in 90s\n\nIt might be EBM with breakbeats (sometimes), or it might be Industrial with more updated equipment, capable of taking abrasiveness and filtered vocals to the next level of brooding angst. Technically this came way after EBM, but I'm running out of room as it is. This is what became of real Industrial music in the 90s, which means ixnay on the uitarsgay in order to separate it from its massively popular cousin Industrial Rock.\n\naka: Futuresynth, Industrial Synthpop in the Industrial group, emerged in 90s\n\nYou know how when you meet someone from another geographical region, they have a funny accent? But to them, you're the one who has the funny accent. Well, in the great mess that is the music of Trance, Futurepop has the same kind of polar opposite perceptions based on one's musical background. To the Industrial/Goth community, Futurepop is cheesy, silly commercial pop music, a blend of the straight-ahead driving synths and treated vocals of EBM with the flying strings of euphoric Epic Trance. But to the Epic Trance scene, Futurepop seems at once impersonal and harsh, a product of the dark, brooding Industrial scene that is disdainful to their sensitive, trance attuned ears. Since that's the case, then Futurepop may very well be the greatest Trance genre ever. Even better than goa.\n\nin the Industrial group,\n\nColdwave is really pissed off about something, but I'm still trying to figure out what that is. It basically takes the angst of Darkwave and turns it up a notch (where Darkwave takes the angst of Goth and turns it up a notch). So this is like Goth...TO THE EXTREME!!! But it loves using acid, so it can't be all bad. And it loves using guitars, being a stepping stone to the more commercial-friendly Industrial Rock.\n\nin the Industrial group,\n\nEssentially, this entire branch of electronic music really had three distinct origins, all of them not entirely electronic but evolving and criss-crossing each other often: Goth, which was gloomy, morbid romanticism; Industrial, which was abrasive, raw angst, and this--the 'synth' stuff, which was pretty damn apathetic at times, though it would frequently get upset at the other two for being so damn melodramatic. That doesn't mean it didn't have its fun, however. It just thinks the other two whine too much.\n\naka: Electro-Goth, Industrial Goth in the Industrial group, emerged in 80s\n\nEverything was \"wave\" in the 80s. There was New Wave in pop music, and then No Wave in punk music, and then the Third Wave of Alan Toffler, and then there was the New Wave of British Heavy Metal, and also everyone's hair had impressively feathered waves in it. It was certainly a time of waving (it took them awhile to change the 'w' to an 'r'). So when the goths finally decided that their melodrama would work really well with machines, of course they called it Darkwave. They probably wanted to call it Blackwave, but that.....hey, why didn't they call it that? I guess it beats calling it Electro-goth (some people might tell you there is a difference between the two genres, but don't listen to them). Lately, it has splintered into regional styles, like Euro Darkwave, and American Darkwave, and man, they are amplified trauma on a whole different, unheard of level. I swear, they make Linkin Park and Evanescence's bellowing about stupid insignificant shit sound like pillow talk.\n\naka: Experimental Industrial in the Industrial group, emerged in 80s\n\nIndustrial music is already pretty much experimental music to begin with, but wouldn't you know it--they had to go out and be experimental themselves. So this is like Experimental Experimental music. Like....experimental squared or something. It's not quite known whether you can actually hear the added experimentalness in the music that makes it more experimental than other experimental genres--unless you have specialized experimental-attuned ears for it. Because it just sounds like every other experimental genre....just experimental industrial. This sounds really stupid, doesn't it?\n\naka: Industrial Metal in the Industrial group, emerged in 80s\n\nAh yes, Industrial Rock. The form of Industrial that has had the most commercial success, and it's all Trent Reznor's fault. Just like how it's all Morrissey's fault there's emo. Heavy metal (and metalheads) needed somewhere to go after grunge nearly crushed it out of existence, so they latched onto this like it was, well, the Next Big Thing. It doesn't differentiate from Coldwave much, except that the songs are more pop accessible. I guess you could call it Epic Industrial then. Ha ha ha. The music's actually not all that bad. The artists have all been featured on Mortal Kombat compilations at one time or another, and they have a tendancy to brainwash troubled teenagers into shooting their classmates every now and then, but other than that it sounds alright to me.\n\naka: Goth Rock, Trad Goth in the Industrial group, emerged in 70s\n\nTechnically not electronic music, unless you count it's giddy use of sound-enrichment studio techniques to give those wailing choruses that extra level of self-deprication and despair. Goths are not happy people. In fact, next to emo kids they are just about the most self-centred, whiny bunch of neo-narcissists on the face of the earth (if you're wondering what the difference is: classic narcissists go around telling everybody how awesome they are, while neo-narcissists go around telling everybody how awful they are). This doesn't mean you should hate the music. Far from it, it's actually quite snappy and fun. Just don't take it too seriously. The style is fine, but there are more colours in the world than black, y'know.\n\nin the Industrial group,\n\nGenesis P'Orridge must be the most quotable man in modern music. Seriously, everything that guy says turns into a de facto music industry declaratitive term for all time. He got his start in the 70s forming the band Throbbing Gristle (what a great name!), releasing music on his own label, called 'Industrial Records'. That word--and the label--would go on to become synonymous with all abrasive forms of music for the rest of the century and beyond. Then, later on in the 80s, he forms his Psychic TV project and begins toying with the TB-303, christening the new sound \"acid house\". The name stuck. Then, in 1992, he's asked about the kind of music coming from artists like Leftfield. His response: Progressive House. Man, is there anything that guy doesn't say that isn't so catchy and applicable? If I were a marketer, I would follow him around every day and bottle whatever he says and sell it.\n\nin the Hard Dance group,\n\nNow this one is odd. It's hard, but at the same time it's not hard. Summarily put, Hard Trance is yet another refuge for fleeing souls of the Anthem comedown at the turn of the millenium. The funny thing is it has actually picked up \"hard\" anthems since then, so the new arrivees won't feel at all estranged by this --intense-- music. Personally, I think if you have to abandon flighty emotional stuff for a harder edge in order to get people to take you seriously as a musician, you probably aren't a very good one. This music will probably be made by mad-libs computer programs a generation from now (if it isn't already).\n\nin the Hard Dance group,\n\nHard. Acid. Trance. It's kind of actually like Goa, only without all the hippy shit. That makes it better by default. Pretty interchangeable with Hard Acid Techno, though the major difference seems to be where this genre seeks to fill dancefloors, the techno variant will scheme ways to FLATTEN dancefloors. Either way, they are the twin masters at making the little 303 box squeel with glee. Like Progressive Trance's patenting of the breakdown-build-anthem formula, Hard Acid Trance can also lay claim to a similar-styled gimmick for quick, cheap, instant acclaim: the \"drop the music for one or two bars, and then bring it all back motherfucker\" technique. And like Progressive Trance, the formula was used credibly here, but then overused to the point of ad nausium by its offspring--namely, NRG.\n\naka: Nu Nrg, Hard Nrg, Hard Dance in the Hard Dance group, emerged in 90s\n\nIt's actually really decent in small doses. Being forced to endure an entire set of it will grate on you, however, and having to go through an ENTIRE NIGHT of it--as I was victim to, many many times--gets excruciatingly mundane. The problem is the music just doesn't let up--ever--and no, you stupid ravers, that is not a good thing. Parties build on tension and release; NRG's go-go-go ethic just flatlines the entire experience, with track after track after track of the same idiotic shit. There are a group of genres that pride themselves under the monicker Hard Dance (which includes Happy Hardcore, Trancecore, Freeform, and Stupid House) and are harbingers of a culture infatuated with its own attitude that, given the chance, will set your teeth on edge even more than the music will. Best to just ignore them. They're too high on crystal and nordic-tracking to NRG music to pay much attention anyway.\n\naka: Really Hard Trance, Hard Dance in the Hard Dance group, emerged in 00s\n\nAs what usually happens in the creation of new genres, you take one specific thing that makes another genre cool, and revolve your new genre entirely around it. So this is what happens when artists go \"hey, that thunderous beat and bassline and squelching synthline sounds really cool\". Whamo, there you go: new genre (or nu, I should say). Eventually, Nu Style Gabber producers started noticing it, so they dived right in, thinking \"hey, no problem. We can make this shit too.\" What's the difference between them? About 30 bpm. Play your Nu Style Gabber records at -8, and Hardstyle is born. But it's still not hard enough to be included among the Hardcore genres. Though maybe that Hard Dance subgroup.\n\naka: McTrance, Stadium Trance, Arena Trance in the Eurotrance group, emerged in 90s\n\nProgressive Trance actually had a pretty good idea. There's nothing wrong with some tension and release in your song. That's what people listen to music for. To bring the music down to a crawl before exploding out with a crescending climax is one of the best tricks in music. And besides, if the DJ's too stupid and inept to figure out how to provide adequate tension and release during his sets through careful track selection and record management, why not do it for him, essentially removing any skill he thought he might've needed to have in order to be a good DJ. Breakdowns, builds, and memorable melodies are not a new thing in trance. But what Anthem Trance did was completely and totally abuse and pervert them. Where Progressive Trance used them to somewhate accentuate the moment (like say a lull before the main synth kicks back in), Anthem Trance used them for the track's entire purpose. This cookie cutter, by-the-numbers formula dominated the english club scene and trance, once the quirky kind of music with only a niche market, reformed itself into a neverending series of pop jingles and by doing so supplaunted house as the most popular dance music in the world.\n\naka: Dream House in the Eurotrance group, emerged in 90s\n\nIf there is anyone who is responsible for the complete and thorough pussification of Trance, making it offensively lame to the point where not only newbie ravers but also their soccer moms could enjoy it, it's Robert Miles. \"Children\" has the exclusive accolade as being the #1 rave recruitment song of all time. It's also probably responsible for the embarrassing onslought of banal, melody-driven trance that dominated the last half of the 90s. Hell, I remember Anne Savage playing this fucking song at my very first rave. This isn't trance; this is like that crappy background music on the TV listings channel that tells you what's playing on other channels.\n\nin the Eurotrance group,\n\nEpic Trance is the gateway genre into the world of rave for most people, so if you have any form of music to blame for raves hitting the mainstream, this is it. Right here. And that, my friends, really, truly, terribly sucks. There must be a word to describe the pain one feels when witnessing (or hearing, rather) something once pure and brilliant completely sold down the river. Sometime in the mid-90s trance decided to drop the technique of slowly introducing complicated layers and building adequate tension over long stretches, replacing them with cutesy little insta-melodies (Robert Miles may actually be to blame for this). That made it more pop culture accessible. The average attention span, way too ritalin-freaked to pay attention to the slow, brooding trance in its original form, liked the anthemic singalong tone of the NEW McTrance, and that's why all you trance crackers are reading this right now. Not because you grew a taste for this super awesome underground music or you discovered it all by yourself once upon a time. But because trance reformed its sound and delivery to suit YOUR sweet-toothed, top40 pop music consuming tastes. Because the truth is Epic trance is not actually trance, per se. It is powdered, sugar-coated pop schmaltz draped over trance for easy digestion by giggling highschool girls and poser trendy types who would never think to even blink at trance in its raw incarnate. This is the musical equivalent of drowning a meal in ketchup so you can't taste the original flavour anymore.\n\naka: Balearic House in the Eurotrance group, emerged in 90s\n\nThis is the only genre I would trust with any uplifting, euphoric melodies. There's a stark contrast between this and the forced-upon, pompous schlock that seeps out of the Epic Trance. I'm not sure why, but without ever having been there this music seems to capture the mood of a soft, Mediterranean sunset perfectly. Soft and wistful music without being trite and limp. It's probably because of its use of string instruments, like spanish guitars and mandolins and other Mediterraneany things, like oceans, birds, and other things borrowed from Ambient Trance. This genre is actually much, much older. It came out of Balearic House in the 80s, and named after the Spanish island that is now an expensive, overcrowded trashy tourist trap.\n\naka: Progressive "
