We will examine this question through several disciplines including philosophy, art history and experiential artistic practice. We will consult short readings of the classics answer to this question (e.g. Plato, Kant, Schiller, Delacroix, Hegel, Marx, Heidegger, Freud, Vygotsky, Foucault, Gombrich, Susanne Langer, John Berger, Elaine Scarry, Boris Groys, Clement Greenberg, Laura Malvie) At the same time we will also look at several distinct periods and ask what was beauty at these specific times. I have chosen four such times. The first period is the Northern Renaissance (e.g. Van Eyck, Bosch, Dürer, Bruegel) the second the Baroque (e.g. Velázquez, Rembrandt), the third the impressionists (e.g. Manet, Degas, Cassatt, Monet, Renoir, Toulouse-Lautrec) the expressionists (Franz Marc, Ernst Ludwig Kirchner) and fourth 20th century art photography. We will examine various concerns that we have with the beautiful. For example, the concern that the love of beauty is at best an evasion from the problems of social reality, at worst a way of legitimizing the status of the rich and powerful. That it is merely a marker of social class (e.g. Bourdieu). That beauty is frivolous, decadent, distracting, and unserious. That there is nothing to describe or to share or give account to this most subjective experience. We will attempt to answer this question by looking to both the experience as well as production of beauty as a kind of temporary emancipation from a life-world experience, a life- world that is limited by material conditions and social factors. We will also look at beauty as a transformative decentering of the self. We will examine deeply Kant’s idea that true beauty is the free play of imagination and understanding in the mind of the audience and therefore can include any theme of topic.\n\nTaking our inspiration both from the philosophers of beauty as well as from the artists we will attempt to capture and frame beauty around us in NOLA. There will be structured weekly tasks in which we will train the eye and mind in finding the aesthetic in some of the most unlikely places, as well as to close viewing. Much of the course will be focused on finding words in writing and speech that attempt to describe and theorize our aesthetic intuitions.\n\nAri Ofengenden, Professor of Practice, Jewish Studies | BIO\n\nW 4:00-5:15p\n\nIdentity and power are often interwoven with community social issues, but may not be openly apparent to the average individual engaging in community service. This course encourages students to first understand their social identities, then the broad range of social issues in New Orleans, to contribute in a meaningful way to the body of work already being done in the New Orleans community. Students will reflect on their own social identities and connect to local non-profits, community organizers, and a broad survey of current issues in New Orleans. By creating a space for meaningful discussions about community involvement, students will examine how social identities and power affect community engagement in New Orleans. This is also a tier 1 service learning course and students will be required to complete at least 20 hours with the selected community partners.\n\n**This course includes a service learning component**\n\nMaurice Smith, Associate Director, Center for Public Service | BIO"
