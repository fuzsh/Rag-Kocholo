        "text": "The 2020 Diamond Platters: Swim Into The Sound’s Ancillary End of the Year Awards\n\nWelp, it’s that time of the year again. Not the holidays, not Christmas, not Hanukkah, but List Season. Yes folks, it’s that wonderful time of the year where every other mainstream music publication stumbles over themselves to write compelling one-paragraph write-ups on the same 50 albums as every other blog.\n\nVindictive as I sound, I do have a strange affinity for List Season. I’m always curious to see what the critical consensus is and where my favorites rank among the lists (if at all), yet there’s something so off about the whole thing. A 3-page listicle of 50 different one-paragraph album write-ups has never felt indicative of the year. Sure, you can revisit the big hits, the 10 out of 10s, and the cultural touchstones, but the format itself is limited. A simple countdown doesn’t do the year justice. Where are the EPs and splits? Where are the weird headlines? Where are the cover songs? Where are the other formative musical events of the year that don’t fit into the album format? That’s why I created The Diamond Platters.\n\nIntentionally named to be as gaudy and opulent as possible, these awards are the highest honor that I, a music blog with impeccable taste, can possibly bestow upon an artist. Music sales, popularity, playing to swaths of adoring fans, those should all come second, because if you made it on this list, then you made it baby.\n\nTongue-in-cheek sarcasm aside, this tradition began four years ago and was so well-received that I just had to do it again in 2018. That second iteration was less-well-received, but I thought ‘analytics be damned!’ and did it again in 2019 to relative success. These awards began as a way for me to circumvent publishing “just another” end of the year list. This is a look at the past 365 days in music through a unique (and sometimes hyper-specific) lens. These awards allow me to draw attention to the creations that may not get discussed on a typical publication’s end of the year list. Most importantly, it’s a way to celebrate the year in music without pitting artists against each other. Unique categories for the unique music listener, because not everything fits into a list of 50.\n\nBest Acoustic Reimagining\n\nWinner: The Wonder Years “Hoodie Weather”\n\nOver the course of the last decade, The Wonder Years have become a stalwart of the pop-punk scene. The band has aged gracefully into each iteration of their career, gradually shifting from energetic teenage goofiness to post-college listlessness and, more recently, morbid pathos. This year, the band released the second iteration in their Burst & Decay series, allowing them to revisit their old songs and update them in a way that feels more true to where the band members are today. The group’s acoustic reimagining of 2011’s “Hoodie Weather” merges these worlds together, taking a song about the restless touring of their early 20’s and rendering it in a pensive, more idyllic light. This rendition of the track retains the sentiment at the core of the original and feels like an update that looks back on the events with reverence provided by the distance of time. It’s a revisitation, but also an update. In a way, this feels like the way the song was always meant to be heard. It’s proof that the band still has more to say, even if it’s just saying it differently.\n\nRunner-up: Future Teens “Swiped Out”\n\nFuture teens have always straddled the line between “emo band” and something more profound. They have achieved success by using many of the same struggles and stylistic choices as your average emo group but have managed to present them in a more mature way. With their Sensitive Sessions EP, the group revisited four songs from last year’s Breakup Season and somehow managed to make them even sadder. Hell, the band even managed to make Smash Mouth sound sad, so at this point, I’m pretty sure there’s nothing they can’t do.\n\nBest Album Art\n\nWinner: Vile Creature - Glory, Glory! Apathy Took Helm!\n\nFor an album that I’ve only listened to one time, the cover to Vile Creature’s Glory, Glory! Has stuck with me more than any other release this year. Capturing the heaviness and beauty at the heart of this sludgy release, this album art is simultaneously gorgeous and disturbing to look at. The cover both sticks with you and accurately indicates the exact kind of songs you’re about to take in. When flipping through vinyl at a record store, this cover is enough to stop any music fan in their tracks, and that means it’s a success on every level.\n\nRunner-up: Niiice. - Internet Friends\n\nLooking at the cover for Internet Friends, you might wonder who some of these people are, but if you’re a part of the emo DIY circuit on Twitter, then you’d quickly recognize a majority of these faces. From Origami Angel to Stars Hollow and Short Fictions, this cover is a veritable Avengers Endgame of 5th wave emo. This means you can spend a majority of the album’s runtime combing over the front and back of the vinyl scanning for easter eggs while taking in songs about weed and depression, essentially the ideal way to spend an evening in 2020.\n\nI Miss Shows: Award For Best Live Album\n\nWinner: Aaron West & The Roaring Twenties - Live From Asbury Park\n\nIt probably goes without saying, but concerts were fucked this year, and that meant we had to rely on livestreams and live albums to fill that void. I was fortunate enough to catch a grand total of 6 shows in the two and a half months of 2020 that things were still open. Halfway through the year, Dan Campbell (aka Aaron West) released Live From Asbury Park, a one-hour album capturing two sold-out nights of energetic, folksy, Springsteen-inspired performances from the tail end of 2019. This record is everything a live album should be. There’s crowd interaction, jaw-dropping high notes, and gorgeous brass instrumentation. On top of all this, the live rendition of “Divorce and the American South” is one of the only songs to make me cry outright this year, so this record is worth checking out for that fact alone.\n\nRunner-up: Bon Iver - Blood Bank (10th Anniversary Edition)\n\nI’m a longtime Bon Iver guy and seeing Justin Vernon treat the tenth anniversary of Blood Bank with such reverence warmed my heart. It’s not exactly a sizable release in the band’s discography, but still a memorable stopgap after the breakthrough success of For Emma, Forever Ago. Even though the EP’s tenth-anniversary release is essentially just the original EP plus a collection of four live tracks, the selection of songs taken from different locations across their 2018 tour makes it feel like a lot of time and thought was put into its presentation. Having (finally) seen the group in concert back in 2019, I can say that the selections on this release do an excellent job of bottling up the raw emotional power of these songs when rendered live on-stage.\n\nBest Sequenced Album\n\nWinner: Ratboys - Printer’s Devil\n\nLongtime readers know that I’m a diehard supporter of short albums. I’m already a big believer in ‘less is more,’ but the longer an album is, the more opportunities there are for lulls and rough patches. While it may or may not end up on my album of the year list in a few weeks, there’s no denying that Ratboy’s third album is an immaculately-crafted work. It’s perfectly paced with peppy, upbeat tracks opening each side, long wistful passages right when they’re needed, and a wonderfully pensive closing track. In other words, this is a masterfully-structured release that hits all the right beats at all the right times.\n\nRunner-up: 100 Gecs - 100 Gecs and the Tree of Clues\n\nNine times out of ten, you could hand me a remix album and I’d throw it straight in the trash. Even for bands that I love, all a remix typically makes me want to do is stop listening to it and go turn on the original. There are some rare examples where a remix can elevate the original or cast it in a new light, but on 100 Gecs and the Tree of Clues, pretty much everything and the kitchen sink is included, yet somehow everything works. Essentially an album-length victory lap for the breakthrough hyperpop act, Tree of Clues sees the duo turning their eclectic 2019 album over to a host of collaborators and conspirators. These guests create ecstasy-fueled EDM bangers, hash noise rock assaults, and everything in between. Every song is different from the ones that came before it, which means there’s never a dull moment.\n\nRemix of the Year\n\nWinner: 100 gecs “ringtone remix featuring Charli XCX, Kero Kero Bonito, and Rico Nasty”\n\nWhen 100 gecs dropped their ringtone remix at the beginning of the year, I’d never experienced anything quite like it. The mix of Charli XCX’s PC Music pop, the brash bars provided by Rico Nasty, and the kawaii interlude courtesy of Kero Kero Bonito proved to be an intoxicating mixture that felt like falling in love. This remix takes an already great track and re-infuses it with that feeling of meeting someone you’ve fallen head over heels for. A powerful emotion to have bottled up in a three-and-a-half-minute song.\n\nRunner-up: Origami Angel - Origami Angel Broke Minecraft\n\nOnce we all collectively realized that gigs weren’t happening this year, Origami Angel did the only logical thing and released a Minecraft-themed remix of their greatest hits for a livestreamed concert taking place in the same game. Despite the complicated and meme-like origins surrounding its release, I’ll never say no to new Gami, much less Gami with Lil John drops.\n\nBest Hiking Album\n\nWinner: Cory Wong - Trail Songs Dusk/Dawn\n\nOn top of releasing one album with Vulfpeck and an album with the Fearless Flyers, Cory Wong also somehow found time to release a solo album in January, a live album, a jazzy piano record, a second two-part live album, and another solo album. On top of all this, he also managed to release a conceptual double EP at the peak of summer that (literally) walks the listener through two different halves of a hiking trip. The first release focuses on the sunny hike up the trail, while the second release captures the starry night spent around the campfire. As someone who got into hiking this year, I can’t articulate how beautifully Wong manages to capture the feeling of boundless exploration and wonder that one experiences on their way up a trail, as well as the sense of satisfied triumph you feel on your way back down. It’s a beautiful breath of fresh air that I can’t wait to revisit all winter long.\n\nRunner-up: Empty Country - Empty Country\n\nEmpty Country’s self-titled release is an arid, jangly album that walks the line between emo, indie rock, and even a touch of heartland Americana. Much like Wild Pink, this is a band that fuses all of these sounds together into something fresh and accessible. Listening to Empty Country feels comparable to a lackadaisical stroll through a field, or the view from the top of a hill.\n\nBest Interpolation\n\nWinner: Dance Gavin Dance “Born To Fail” (Interpolating Tides of Man)\n\nWhen I first heard “Born To Fail,” I was digging it. Then, when I heard Tilian quoting my favorite Tides of Man song a full decade after he first sang it, the song officially blew my mind. It never even occurred to me that a band was even ALLOWED to do this, but like everything else that Dance Gavin Dance does, they made it sound great.\n\nRunner-up: Gleemer “TTX” (Interpolating Lesley Gore)\n\nWhile the interpolation on “Born To Fail” is fantastic because of the reference track's mind-bending context, Gleemer's “TTX” is noteworthy for an entirely different reason. Here, the band interpolates Lesley Gore's “It’s My Party” and integrates it so seamlessly that the lyrics sound completely organic.\n\nBest Music Video\n\nWinner: Rico Nasty “Own It”\n\nEvery frame of this video is art. From the bikini-clad Hellraiser look to the babushka-adorned champagne tea party, “Own It” truly feels like Rico Nasty in her element. There are bright colors, triple-take costume designs, and animated in-your-face movements that come across as equal parts boisterous and calculated—a perfect, disorienting crash course into the world of Rico Nasty.\n\nRunner-up: Dogleg “Wartortle”\n\nThis seems like a safe place to admit that Clerks blew my mind when I first saw it in college. Not even a casual “blew my mind and liked it,” but an “I need to go sit by myself and think about that movie because it spoke to something that deep within me.” I’m a little embarrassed by that fact six-ish years down the line, but seeing Dogleg’s faithful recreation of the Kevin Smith classic in the music video for “Wartortle” made me feel a little bit better about my regrettably deep-rooted connection.\n\nBest Music-Related Game of the Year\n\nWinner: Dikembe: The Video Game\n\nI’ll admit this category was not entirely my idea but came from Dikembe themselves jokingly suggesting it on Twitter. Despite the artificial creation of this award, this is precisely what the Diamond Platters were made for. After all, how many other DIY bands have the brains big enough to promote their upcoming record with a platformer? Just one, and it was Dikembe.\n\nRunner-up: Get To The Gig: The Chillwavve Records Video Game\n\nIn a similar vein, Get To The Gig from Chillwavve Records is a throwback RPG that finds its hero fulfilling the title’s promise and meeting a roster of DIY emo icons along the way. If that wasn’t enough, the “leaked” song at the end of the game made the entire journey feel worth it. Eat your heart out, Travis Scott Fortnite performance.\n\nBest Guest Feature\n\nWinner: Uwade Akhere on Shore\n\nI may not have liked Fleet Foxes’ fourth studio album, but Uwade Akhere’s contributions are undeniably the record’s high points. In fact, the band places a lot of weight on her shoulders for an unknown talent. From opening and closing the album to contributing gorgeous melodies to the album’s best cut, it’s painful to imagine what Shore would have been without her.\n\nRunner-up: Morgan Freeman on Savage Mode II\n\nMorgan Freeman’s dulcet tones are pretty much the last thing you’d expect to hear when clicking play on the newest 21 Savage mixtape, yet on the sequel to 2017’s Savage Mode, they somehow manage to fit perfectly. From welcoming the listener to the album, giving a detailed explanation on the difference between ‘snitches’ and ‘rats,’ to closing the tape out with a reminder to “stay in savage mode,” it’s fair to say this release wouldn’t have been the same without him.\n\nBest Cover Song\n\nWinner: Phoebe Bridgers & Maggie Rogers “Iris”\n\n2020 was a banner year for Phoebe Bridgers; she released her sophomore album to critical acclaim and (relative) enthusiasm from long-time fans. She earned a slew of Grammy nominations, performed at Red Rocks, released her annual Christmas song, and had a seemingly never-ending barrage of attention-grabbing interviews. The arguable peak of Phoebe-dom happened when, during a particularly bleak moment on Election Day, she tweeted, “if trump loses I will cover iris by the goo goo dolls.” Not only did Trump end up losing, but Phoebe stuck to her word, releasing the song for only 24 hours on Bandcamp with all proceeds going to Fair Fight, an organization dedicated to fighting for free and fair elections. On top of all this, both Bridgers and Rogers earned their first Billboard Hot 100 with this cover based solely off of Bandcamp Purchases alone. The song itself is an absolutely gorgeous and heartfelt rendition of the late-90s radio banger, a genre of music I’ve found myself increasingly unironically drawn to over the course of quarantine. If anything, Phoebe’s version of the song only further solidified my belief in the earnest beauty that lies at the heart of corny songs from my childhood.\n\nRunner-up: Pelafina “Cardigan”\n\nI’ll be honest. I have no idea how I stumbled across Pelafina, let alone became a follower of theirs on Bandcamp, but when I got an email announcing their Taylor Swift covers, I bought them without hesitation. TS finds the band revisiting two recent Swift hits, “Cardigan” and “Cruel Summer,” both of which the band casts in a new and loving light that’s both faithful to the source material while retaining their style as a band, exactly what a good cover should be.\n\nHeadline of the Year\n\nWinner: “Scooby-Doo Is Going on Tour With Björk's Costume Designer”\n\nThe fact that 2020 robbed us of this experience is nothing short of a national tragedy.\n\nRunner-up: “Sex Pistols star Johnny Rotten bitten by a flea on his penis after rescuing squirrels”\n\nLook, if I had to read this, y’all do too.\n\nPorch Beer Album of the Year\n\nWinner: Routine - And Other Things\n\nPorch Beers, a term coined by me and popularized with my two-follower Spotify playlist, is a subgenre of music characterized by jangly guitars, lackadaisical lyricism, and relaxed rhythm sections. It’s country-tinged indie rock that pairs flawlessly with a porch and a pink sky on a summer evening, and there wasn’t a release this year that captured that feeling better than And Other Things. Surprise announced in the last quarter of the year, this 17-minute EP brings together partners Melina Duterte of Jay Som and Annie Truscott of Chastity Belt for a collection of songs that feels as fulfilling as a full-length. As you’d expect from such a short release, the two waste no time jumping straight into it with “Candy Road” which sparkles like desert sand in the midday sun. The titular “And Other Things” is a masterwork of revelatory reverb. Meanwhile, “Calm and Collected” sends things off perfectly with an extended instrumental stretch that leaves just enough room for reflection while you queue the record up again and grab another beer.\n\nRunner-up: Kevin Morby - Sundowner\n\nWith songs like “Valley,” “Campfire,” and of course the titular “Sundowner,” Kevin Morby’s sixth studio album feels tailor-made for porch beers or long, reflective drives home. It’s laid-back, countrified, fresh air music that practically begs you to crack open a cold one, inhale some fresh air, and appreciate your surroundings.\n\nBest Gothic Country Album\n\nWinner: Holy Motors - Horse\n\nIf someone were to ask me what Gothic Country is, I would simply show them the cover art for songs like Holy Motors’ “Country Church” and “Endless Night,” then I’d hit play on the band’s excellent sophomore album.\n\nRunner-up: BAMBARA - Stray\n\nSwirling together a mesmerizing blend of gothic country and post-punk, Bambara’s Shadow On Everything was a dark horse entry in my 2018 Album of the Year list. Two years later, they’ve continued to develop that sound into a new release that’s haunting, unsettling, groovy, and even singable at times.\n\nFavorite Longform Piece I Wrote This Year\n\nWinner: The Stark Maximalism of Sufjan Stevens\n\nSpoiler alert: sometimes I use these awards to re-promote some of my old articles. While it may seem like insular self-promotion, what better time than the end of the year to look back on some of my favorite pieces of writing? Literally the first article I published this calendar year, my retrospective on Sufjan’s Carrie & Lowell was a long time coming. Bringing together years of listening history, a live album, and a B-sides collection, I felt like I finally said everything I’d spent five years ruminating on. Not only that, I feel like I was able to articulate myself completely and beautifully, which is one of the most satisfying experiences as a writer.\n\nRunner-up: An Introduction To Post-Rock\n\nPost-rock is a genre that’s gotten me through a lot of tough times. It’s scored countless hours of reading, writing, and creating for me. It’s a pretty specific but deep genre, which means it’s infinitely rewarding to get into. In this piece, I did my best to put the wordless power of the genre into several paragraphs, a task that proved to be both rewarding and herculean. Intended to serve as an entry point for someone new to post-rock, this post takes nine of genre’s best records and explains the differences between each so someone can jump in with an album that’s up their alley stylistically then (ideally) journey in deeper from there.\n\nY’all Sleep: Most Overlooked and Underappreciated Release of the Year\n\nWinner: Marble Teeth - Park\n\nDo you like Slaughter Beach, Dog? What about Oso Oso? How Do you feel about Field Medic? If you responded positively to any of the above questions, then what are you waiting for? Press play on Marble Teeth’s Park immediately. While Cars weaved minute-long stories of high school football players, paranoid Pop-Tart connoisseurs, and lifelong love, Park ventures into more polished and personable territory. While Cars centered around acoustic guitar licks and simplistic electronic beats, Park favors a full(er) band approach that strikes at the heart of midwest mediocrity. Still centered around Caleb Jefson’s astute observations of the human condition, these songs sway forward in the most approachable and unexpected ways. There’s nothing quite like reveling in the world of awkward relationships, midnight dances, and Connecticut rest stops depicted in Park. This is a superb and lived-in release that is more creative, wondrous, and well-observed than almost anything I’ve listened to this year.\n\nRunner-up: Fixer - Married\n\nPortland, Oregon doesn't have much of a music scene because if there was any justice in this world, then Fixer’s sophomore album would have roughly one million streams by now. A lowkey indie rock release from the beginning of quarantine, this record is catchy, groovy, and immaculately produced. A literal shame that more people haven’t dug into these songs because this 25-minute release is worth its weight in gold.\n\nBest “Making Of” Documentary\n\nWinner: Glass Beach - the making of the first glass beach album\n\nHave 90 minutes to kill and don’t feel like watching a movie? Well, it’s hard to beat the making of the first glass beach album. The perfect introduction to the emo-ish prog-ish indie-ish band, this feature-length documentary is up for free on Youtube and details (as you would expect) the creation of the band’s titular first album. It’s fun, it’s funky, it’s a journey.\n\nRunner-up: King Gizzard & The Lizard Wizard - Ratty\n\nHave another 30 minutes to kill? Well, Ratty is a documentary from genre-agnostic Aussie rockers King Gizzard & The Lizard Wizard. This mini-movie details the creation of their thrash metal masterpiece Infest The Rats Nest, which wound up on our 2019 Album of the Year List. For a band as entertaining and musically diverse as King Gizz, this doc is a great peek behind the curtain into the psych rocker’s creative process.\n\nBest Cover Song Part II: Electric Boogaloo\n\nWinner: The World Is a Beautiful Place & I Am No Longer Afraid to Die “In Circles”\n\nThe World Is A Beautiful Place are emo legends. Sunny Day Real Estate are emo legends. It would only make sense that the two should meet at some point, and this cover bridges the gap between emo generations like nothing before. It shouldn’t be surprising that TWIABP does “In Circles” such justice, but they also manage to put their own spin on it that feels distinctly modern. It’s gorgeous and honestly just makes me want a full album of Sunny Day Real Estate covers.\n\nRunner-up: Dogleg & Worst Party Ever - go ep\n\nIt started, as many things do, with a tweet. Late November, Michigan punk band Dogleg pitted a fight against Florida emo rockers Worst Party Ever. Accusations were made, shots were fired, the gauntlet was thrown. This jokingly playful beef culminated in the two bands exchanging covers, all of which were collected in a split that warms my emo heart.\n\nMost Triggering High School Metalcore Phase Flashbacks\n\nWinner: Mikau - Phantoma\n\nThis year I stumbled across a vinyl copy of The Word Alive’s debut EP Empire at a local record shop. I’m pretty sure I audibly gasped and quickly threw down however much money allowed me to leave the store with the record in-hand. If that reaction makes sense to you, then Mikau’s Phantoma is likely to spark that same corner of your latent 2010’s Hot Topic brain as it did me. There are chuggy riffs, crabcore breakdowns, and synthy interludes. In short, this is the type of band who would have signed to Rise Records in 2011 and raked in money by the thousands every summer at Warped Tour. Instead, we’re lucky enough to have them in 2020, where they can be appreciated for the nostalgic, lost art form that they really are.\n\nRunner-up: If I Die First - My Poison Arms\n\nWhen I first stumbled across If I Die First on Spotify, I didn’t even know what genre they were. When I clicked play on My Poison Arms and was greeted electronicore in the vein of This Romantic Tragedy, I was immediately smitten. This EP would have fit in perfectly on my iPod Classic circa 2009, so I am legally obligated to love it with every molecule in my latent metalcore-loving heart.\n\nSong of the Summer\n\nWinner: Cardi B & Megan Thee Stallion “WAP”\n\nLet’s just get it out of the way; “WAP” is a great song. The track is catchy, dirty, and sexually-liberating, which is all well and good, but what strikes me most about this cartoonishly horny hip-hop cut is the fact that it managed to be so pervasive despite a nationwide shutdown. I know there were (unfortunately) still people out partying this summer, but this song’s ability to spread through TikTok, Twitter, and various other social media is what really cemented it as an artistic achievement in the face of a distinctly non-WAP summer.\n\nRunner-up: Dababy & Roddy Ricch “Rockstar”\n\nI know it was a quarantined summer, and having a hit song during this time feels like it comes with a giant asterisk. However, if your song managed to make its way to me (an uncool white guy in his late-20s), I can only assume it’s reached a level of cultural pervasiveness that is worthy of praise.\n\nFavorite Review I Wrote This Year\n\nWinner: Young Jesus - Welcome To Conceptual Beach\n\nMore shameless self-promo, this time in review form! While those earlier articles were longer-form pieces, my review for Young Jesus’ phenomenal fifth album is short, pointed, and poured out of me in one writing session. Sometimes the most challenging part of writing a review is just figuring out your way in. Young Jesus provided so many different ways in on their latest record, the problem became figuring out which one to pursue. Luckily, I feel like I did the album justice and spoke articulately to the statement that it’s making.\n\nRunner-up: Sinai Vessel - Ground Aswim\n\nMuch like my Young Jesus review, my review for Ground Aswim poured out of me over the course of one impassioned afternoon that I spent with the record. Also, much like the Young Jesus album, Sinai Vessel’s sophomore effort is a measured, precious, and relaxing album with a statement to make coming at a prescient time.\n\nBest Cover Song Part III: Return of the King\n\nWinner: Lucy Dacus “Lips of an Angel”\n\nApologies for three identical categories, but we got lots of great covers this year, and I want to talk about “Lips of an Angel.” Originally by the American rock band Hinder, “Lips of an Angel” arrived upon our earth in 2005 and is arguably the toxic masculinity anthem. There’s cheating, gaslighting, pleading, and everything else you’d expect to hear while listening to a shitty dude talk to his ex on the phone. Lucy Dacus takes the band’s cringy lyricism and re-frames it from a distinctly femme perspective that de-fangs the negativity and replaces it with a layer of deeply-felt beauty.\n\nRunner-up: SASAMI “Toxicity”\n\nIf you were to sit me down and just start connecting random artists to songs they’ve covered, I would never, ever, in a million years, have connected indie rocker SASAMI to System of A Down. I suppose given the band’s semi-ubiquitous prevalence throughout the early to mid-2000s, it’s unsurprising that an artist currently in her late-20s would have an intimate familiarity with the nu-metal group. What’s impressive is not only how incredible her cover sounds, but how drastically different it is from the original. Proof that a good song is a good song no matter what, and a good artist can always take a good song and make it sound even better.\n\nGreatest Addition to the Christmas Canon\n\nWinner: 100 gecs “sympathy 4 the grinch”\n\nBack at the beginning of December, I mindlessly liked this tweet from 100 gecs and never gave it a second thought. It had never occurred to me that the hyperpop duo even could release a Christmas song. That was simply too awesome a combination of my tastes and interests to exist in 2020. We didn’t deserve it as a society. When the gecs dropped “sympathy 4 the grinch” less than 24 hours later, I was shook to my core. The perfect Christmas song. Finally.\n\nRunner-up: girl in red “two queens in a king sized bed”\n\nAs a man, I feel unilaterally unqualified to speak on the queerness of “two queens in a king sized bed.” What I will speak on however, is how beautiful, soft, and caring this song is. Pairing a piano with faint jingle bells and a pulsating drum build, this song is as loving, caring, and gorgeous as you’d want your lover to be. It’s gay as hell and Christmassy as fuck; what’s not to like?\n\nMost Impactful Beat Drop\n\nWinner: Beach Bunny “Rearview”\n\nComplete candor: this song was neck-and-neck in the running for my song of the year, but just barely got overtaken in the homestretch. That said, it’s still one of my favorites of the year, and this list would have felt utterly incomplete without its inclusion. “Rearview” is a mid-album cut off Beach Bunny’s fantastic debut album. It begins simply enough; a gentle guitar paired with Lili Trifilio’s confessional vocals. As she pines for her unrequited love over the guitar, her strums gradually pick up energy, morphing into a more-pointed riff. In the last minute of the song, she lands on the track’s namesake and pauses for a moment, then proceeds to sing a simple rhyme over a cool bassline. “You love me, I love you / You don't love me anymore, I still do. I'm sorry, I'm trying / I hate it when you catch me crying” As these words emerge from her lips, a whirl of feedback tears through the track along with two drum hits that make way for the rest of the band. From there, the group introduces a towering riff that makes the listener feel like a speck of dust in their all-encompassing emotional oasis. It’s goosebump-inducing and possibly my single favorite moment in any song this entire year.\n\nRunner-up: Soccer Mommy “Gray Light”\n\nSophie Allison knows how to end an album. From the quiet “Switzerland” to the confessional and forlorn “Waiting For Cars,” this fact has been clear from the very outset of her career. But two is a coincidence, three is a pattern. Allison ends Clean with the soul-decimating “Wildflowers” which works its way up from a solitary acoustic guitar to an ascending electronic whir that feels like every emotion you’ve ever had lifting you up into the air like an alien tractor beam. “gray light” accomplishes a similar effect, winding up from a slow soul-crushing spacey electronic bed into a weird reversed electronic “snap” that commands all attention then sends the listener off on a dreamy Mazzy Star guitar slide. It’s bliss.\n\nMost Hypnotizing Bassline\n\nWinner: Seahaven “Moon”\n\nSeahaven made us wait seven years for this record, and honestly, the bassline on “Moon” alone makes that wait worth it. Placed in the skillful hands of Mike DeBartolo, this song sounds like it was made with the express purpose of winding around his knotty basswork. It’s dark, witchy, and downright spooky yet utterly captivating. I swear I could listen to just the bass on this song for the album’s full runtime.\n\nRunner-up: Thank You, I’m Sorry “Follow Unfollow”\n\nAdmittedly more energetic than “Moon,” “Follow Unfollow” from midwest emo outfit Thank You, I’m Sorry features a dynamic, bouncy bass that drives the song forward. As the bass, courtesy of Bethunni Schreiner, bounces back and forth, the listener is left to watch in awe, taking the track in like a tennis match, merely trying to keep up.\n\nFind Your Throne: Award For Most Positive Song of the Year\n\nWinner: Cliffdiver “Gas City”\n\nPositivity felt in short supply this year. Maybe that’s why songs like “Gas City” stuck out so much from the crowd. Cosmically affirming and infinitely singable, this single from the Oklahoma-based emo group also introduced the group’s new co-lead singer Briana Wright who brings a soaring quality to the song that makes it all the more uplifting. Also featuring the group’s usual mix of tappy emo, honest lyricism, and soulful saxophone, this song has become my go-to whenever I need a pick-me-up.\n\nRunner-up: Guitar Fight From Fooly Cooly “My Friends Are My Power (Spoiler Alert!)”\n\nAny song that opens with a Kingdom Hearts sample and throws directly into a moshpit volley of drums is a winner in my book. I won’t give away the “spoiler” here, but it’s well worth the 1:39-second listen.\n\nLose Your Throne: Award For Most Self-Deprecating Song of the Year\n\nWinner: Cheem “Smooth Brain”\n\nI feel that “Smooth Brain” really captures the essence of this year well. Between quarantine, the election, and everything in between, I think I could have scraped my brain into a blender and turned it on high for 360 days straight, and I still would have kept it in better shape than whatever I ended up doing. Blending a Patrick Stump-like chorus with pained bars and a glittery instrumental, “Smooth Brain” is the real song of the summer.\n\nRunner-up: I Love Your Lifestyle “Stupid”\n\nSometimes everything just plain sucks. You are stupid, I am stupid, he is stupid, she is stupid, this whole thing is stupid. That’s almost literally the sentiment captured in “Stupid” by I Love Your Lifestyle. Built around a repetitive, building, earworm of a chorus, this is a song that sounds more like the things you mutter under your breath while working your retail job dealing with abject nonsense day-in, day-out. Truly an anthem for these stupid ages.\n\nBest Posthumous Album\n\nWinner: Pop Smoke - Shoot For The Stars Aim For The Moon\n\nPosthumous albums are inherently an uphill battle. You never know how much was created before the artist’s passing and how much was studio fuckery. While Pop Smoke’s death at the beginning of 2020 was an outright tragedy, Shoot For The Stars Aim For The Moon is nothing short of a triumph. From star-studded features, teeth-gritting bangers, and career-affirming assists, this record does everything right. There’s a diverse wealth of sounds, and Pop Smoke rarely feels overshadowed on his own release, which is an all-too-common pratfall of the posthumous album. Shoot For The Stars is already one of the best trap albums of the decade, it’s just a shame we never got to see Pop Smoke’s career flourish the way he deserved.\n\nRunner-up: Mac Miller - Circles\n\nMac Miller’s death at the end of 2018 came as a shock to pretty much everyone. Having spent a decade developing his sound from frat rap mixtapes as a teen to the jazzy poetry he released just a week before his death, Mac was a poster boy for artistic development on top of being an all-around great dude. Circles continues the sound that Mac was fleshing out on Swimming and ends his story in a satisfying place that offered fans some semblance of closure.\n\nRecord Label of the Year\n\nWinner: Acrobat Unstable Records\n\nAt nearly every step of the way this year, I was amazed by the North Carolina upstart indie label Acrobat Unstable. Initially conceived as a way for labelmates Eric Smeal and Martin Hacker-Mullin to make tapes and merch for bands that they liked, this quickly ballooned from local acts to bands like Short Fictions and the Callous Daoboys. This year, the label helped release projects from the likes of Carpool, Charm, Acne, Ultimate Frisbee, and Thirty Cent Fare, none of whom I’d heard of before this year, but all of which blew me away. The label also released hundreds of vinyl records and helped bands like Hospital Bracelet, Jail Socks, Stars Hollow, and Origami Angel release merch and vinyl. If next year bears even a semblance of the label’s success in 2020, then we are in for a wild ride.\n\nRunner-up: Moon Physics\n\nWhile Acrobat Unstable wins for turning me on to a constant stream of new music throughout 2020, Moon Physics earns their runner-up spot for positing a new way that a label can operate in this capitalist hellscape. Centered around monthly “drops,” this Tony-Hawk-inspired entity describes themselves as a “zero-profit, anti-capitalist” springboard for artists. In between dropping tapes, vinyl, and fingerboards, the label acts as an educational resource that also splits the profit of sales between the artists and local community organizations. An aspirational model that I hope sets the tone for a new decade of labels. I cannot wait to see what’s in store for the organization in 2021.\n\nHonorable mentions to Good Luck Charm Records, Chillwavve Records, and Take This To Heart Records because each of these labels consistently dropped fire releases all throughout the year.\n\nCame Out Swinging: Best New Band of 2020\n\nWinner: It Doesn’t Bother Me\n\nYou can say a lot of bad things about 2020, but at least it gave us It Doesn’t Bother Me. This Midwest emo project may have had the misfortunate timing of dropping their debut EP at the height of a quarantined spring, but the way I see it, that just gives them more time to rack up fans who will soon be screaming along to these songs in a sweaty Michigan basement. Alternating between catchy Mom Jeans choruses and You, Me, And Everyone We Know-esque vocal stylings, the band is more than equipped to create a string of iconic emo songs ready for Spotify playlists, emo mixtapes, and infinitely-bigger stages. Get hip now before they blow up.\n\nRunner-up: Blue Deputy\n\nBlue Deputy didn’t exist before 2020, and now they do. That alone makes this year worth it. A creative (and romantic) partnership between Andy Bunting and Brody Hamilton, Blue Deputy explores the tender spaces of relationships that can only be observed as you’re living them. Look no further than the gorgeous double New Jersey / I Hate Steven Singer for two catchy emo-flavored bedroom pop songs that sparkle and glisten like the glitter on a freshly-uncapped gel pen. These two will do amazing things, and we’re lucky that 2020 allowed such beautiful songs as these into existence.\n\nBiggest Come-up\n\nWinner: Roddy Ricch\n\nRoddy Ricch began the year with a chart-topping #1 song that fended off singles from both Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez. He contributed to the (*secondary) Song of the Summer with Dababy and tossed out features to the likes of Gunna, Pop Smoke, and Ty Dolla Sign. In short, it was Roddy Ricch’s year, unfortunately, the stars just happened to align for him on a really shitty year.\n\nRunner-up: Redveil\n\nWithin the space of one calendar year, Maryland-based Redveil went from an unknown Twitter rapper to one of the internet’s hottest upcoming artists. A baby-faced 16, Redveil created a mixtape that single-handedly made waves all over Twitter and garnered millions of streams, all before he was legally allowed to drive.\n\nBest Revisitation\n\nWinner: Into It. Over It. - Canada Sessions\n\nI respect Evan Thomas Weiss as the face of Fourth Wave emo. I respect his output, I cherish his voice, and I love his dynamic autumnal album from this year. While I love and appreciate his body of work, nothing sits quite as close to my heart as 52 Weeks. That record was formative in my emo upbringing, and it makes me sad he’s “moved on” with albums that have had bigger hit songs. Nothing speaks to me quite the way “Basto” does. Nothing gets me singing quite like “A Song About Your Party.” Nothing feels quite as bile-filled as “Bullied Becomes the Bully,” and honestly, that’s a bummer. I had these songs all but written off until 2020 when Weiss released Canada Sessions, a short EP that saw him revisiting two different decade-old tracks off his breakthrough year of music. Obviously better produced than the original tracks, both “Embracing Facts” and “22 Syllables” absolutely shine in this new context, slightly updated to reflect Weiss’ more recent artistic leanings but still tapping into the same younger soul that created them. An affirmation and a celebration.\n\nRunner-up: The Fearless Flyers “Adrienne and Adrianne”\n\nThe Venn diagram of members between Vulfpeck and Fearless Flyers is almost a circle, and with four iterations of one song under their belt, Vulfpeck are no stranger to revisiting a tune. While I admittedly have a propensity for the band’s earlier instrumental EPs, I have grown to love the Fearless Flyers for the very same reason as Vulf; an abundance of proficient, funky, fun instrumentals. When I heard the sounds of an eight-year-old Vulfpeck deep cut coming out of my 2020 Fearless Flyers record, I just about lost my shit. It’s like putting on an old winter coat; fits like a charm.\n\nBest Deployment of a Harmonica\n\nWinner: Slow Pulp “Montana”\n\nEssentially the end credits to Slow Pulp’s fantastic debut album, “Montana” is a laid-back and relaxing track that’s as easy as the rolling hills that the song seeks to depict. The song builds to a hypnotic repetition as lead singer Emily Massey pleads, “come on get out of my head,” and becomes fixated on the word “head,” singing it over and over until the song’s close. The deployment of harmonica midway through the track not only breaks the repetitive wave-like nature of the lyrics but feels like a stand-in for something larger than the piece itself, something spiritual I haven’t quite figured out yet.\n\nRunner-up: Field Medic “HEADCASE”\n\nKevin Patrick Sullivan (better known as Field Medic) has made his name as an outspoken and famously-mulleted poet, equal parts emo and horny. While the Bob Dylan comparisons can feel simultaneously on-the-nose and unfair, sometimes it’s a hard thing to avoid when one pairs acoustic guitar with harmonica this much. “HEADCASE” is a fast-moving Field Medic track where the harmonica comes in at just the right spot, punctuating a top-tapping chorus and capping off an array of confessional sentiments found in each verse.\n\nBest Split of the Year\n\nWinner: Arcadia Grey, Oolong, Guitar Fight From Fooly Cooly, dannythestreet - Fatal 4 Way Split\n\nTo some degree, many of the big bands from the 5th Wave Emo Movement have already revealed themselves to the world… However, if you were to ask me who some of the best, most promising upcoming bands in the scene are, I’d point you to this split. All harnessing the same jittery zoomer energy, this lineup features some of the best bands currently releasing music on the regular. From the moshpit-opening body dysmorphia found on Arcadia Grey’s “Braum” to the propulsive combo of tapping and screaming found on Oolong’s “Dippin Daniel,” I really believe there’s something for everything on this meeting of the emo minds. Guitar Fight From Fooly Cooly kicks their contribution off with a fist-balling Mortal Kombat sample that makes me want to start swinging the same way “2nd Sucks” did way back in high school. dannythestreet closes the rumble royale off with a glimmering earworm of a melody that leaves me hopeful for the next generation of emo acts.\n\nRunner-up: Snarls, The Sonder Bombs - A Really Cool Split\n\nAs previously established above with the Dogleg x Worst Party Ever split, I’m a sucker for bands covering each other’s songs. It’s cute and sometimes just makes sense in some cosmic way. A Really Cool Split from Snarls and Sonder Bombs sees the two Cleveland bands swapping songs to great effect on top of an acoustic rendition and a long-awaited pre-album single. It’s a loving little pit stop for both bands, one coming hot off one of the most underrated indie pop records of the year and the other ramping up to drop one of the best of 2021.\n\nBest Release From 2019 That I Didn’t Give A Fair Shake\n\nWinner: Hovvdy - Heavy Lifter\n\nBy the time fall rolled in, it was simultaneously jarring and calming. Precipitated by the changing of the leaves and sharp snaps of fall temperatures, the fall season still managed to take me by surprise, but I’ll admit that quarantine has thrown off all sense of time. As I mentally relegated myself to the frigid wintertime, I found Heavy Lifter to be a perfect reflection of my mental state. Somewhat inward, a little bit scattered, and wholly comforting, I did not give this album the time of day back in 2019. Aside from the warming blanket of comfort, what I find more artistically impressive about this record is the way that it can make banal things like falling asleep to YouTube and free parking practically romantic in melody. Never again will I sleep on Hovvdy.\n\nRunner-up: Orville Peck - Pony\n\nWhile I had seen Orville Peck back in 2019 (his half-mask, half-tassel cowboy hat is hard to miss after all), I realized I had never actually listened to him until this year. Within seconds of hitting play on “Dead of Night,” I realized I’d made a grave mistake. Pony is a dark, mysterious country record centered around Peck’s smoldering baritone, which lends an air of genre-based familiarity. Aside from the record’s immaculate production, what makes these familiar genre trappings fresh is how Peck updates the topics to feel more reflective of our society as it stands. He talks candidly about queerness, drug use, and his own emotions, three things the country of yesteryear would never touch with a ten-foot pole. In other words, Pony represents a long-needed update to an entire genre that everyone is quick to write off; I’m just glad I got here when I did.\n\nSong of the Year\n\nWinner: Spanish Love Songs “Losers 2”\n\nSeeing Spanish Love Songs live was one of the last concerts I went to this year, and (apparently) one of the last concerts I’ll go to for a while. I could focus on that lack of live music and dwell in a pit of despair, but instead, I’d rather focus on the freedom I felt that night screaming along to my favorite songs with a wall of sweaty fans.\n\n“Losers 2” is easily my favorite song of the year. Centered around sharp lyricism and a cathartic build, this track quickly became an outlet for me early in 2020. It represents something bigger, something I may not experience for a while, yet experience every day.\n\nFor roughly two minutes, lead singer Dylan Slocum finds himself displaced, revisiting former homes, dead relatives, and economic inequalities. Destined to die poor and wake up forever tired, Slocum has no choice but to continue. Third jobs enter the picture, but the larger scene of mortality and capitalism never fades. It’s a life that many millennials can understand. A life where nothing bad can ever happen because a single accident, a single diagnosis, a single unplanned event can throw your entire future into disarray. Minimum wages aren’t fought for by our politicians, but by mothers, forced to rideshare to demonstrations because they don’t have vehicles of their own. The entire thing paints this richly-detailed picture of a deeply-failed country. Of a failed generation. Of the world in which we currently exist.\n\nAbout midway through, the song transitions to the bridge and here’s the part that gets me every. fucking. time. Just as Slocum self-deprecatingly describes himself as a “walking tragic ending,” something shifts inside him. The instrumental cuts out to a single warbling synth note which makes way for the most poignant sentiment of the entire record. The bridge, which I’ll paste here in-full, is a pitch-perfect depiction of this stalemate between economic and emotional devastation.\n\nSo I'm leaving the city / Maybe the country / Maybe the earth\n\nGonna find a place of my own\n\nWhere the fuckups aren't cops / Patrolling neighbourhoods they're afraid of / And the rest of us won't burn out / Displacing locals from neighbourhoods we're afraid of\n\nNow if we weren't bailed out / Every time by our parents we'd be dead / What's gonna happen when they're dead?”\n\nThere’s really nothing else I can say.\n\nRunner-up: Mandancing “Johnny Freshman”\n\nMandancing released one of the most underrated emo albums of 2020. The record is packed with gorgeous slice of life tales of love, loss, and friendship. There are stellar performances, jaw-dropping arrangements, and earnest emo deliveries aplenty. Amongst an album that’s so consistently great, my personal peak comes at the tail end with the closing track “Johnny Freshman.”\n\nThis enigmatic and slow-moving song is centered around a dual vocal and instrumental build that both peak in the same cathartic way before whisking the listener off on a shimmering emo outro that’s reminiscent of some of my favorite songs of all time. “Johnny Freshman” borrows the same pleading sentiment as Julien Baker’s “Go Home” as lead singer Stephen G. Kelly belts “would you please come home?” over a near-bear instrumental bed. These pleas repeat and eventually culminate in a goosebump-inducing cry of the same phrase as the instrumental grows in scope, eventually consuming the entire track. For 90 seconds the guitar reverberates, the drums roll, and the bass shakes as the band plays out the same ascending chord strum dozens of times, lending the track this meditative quality that gives the listener time to think and reflect on the entire record they had just taken in. Simple masterful.\n\nMost Anticipated Release of 2021\n\nWinner: Jail Socks - Debut Album\n\nJail Socks had already created my 2019 Album of the Year, so it probably goes without saying that I’m feverishly anticipating the next moves from the fresh-faced No Sleep signees. Despite only having released a grand total of eight songs to the public, Jail Socks had become one of my favorite 5th Wave emo-ish bands by the end of last year. I still listen to It’s Not Forever on an (at least) weekly basis, so I cannot wait to see what the band does with their first full-length next year.\n\nRunner-up: Michelle Zauner - Crying In H Mart\n\nMy second most-anticipated release of 2020 isn’t an album, but a book. Crying In H Mart is the soon-to-be-released memoir by Michelle Zauner of Japanese Breakfast. The book is based on, named after, and presumably in the style of her heartbreaking New Yorker article of the same name. Zauner, who was also the winner of our 2017 Album of the Year, has a beautiful way of navigating words and emotions in a manner that cuts directly to my soul. I’m sure Crying In H Mart will be nothing short of a crushing read, but that’s exactly what I want, and exactly what I need.\n\n100 gecs' Ringtone Remix is a Joyous Pop Confection\n\n100 gecs might be one of the most exciting, promising, and future-forward musical acts I’ve ever had the joy of discovering. While I connect with them from an omnivorous music fan’s perspective, there’s undeniably something greater lurking just beneath the surface. Last year, their debut 1000 gecs shocked me. It was a 23-minute unveiling that was familiar yet unlike anything I’d ever heard in my life. I could hear pieces of rap, metal, hip-hop, trap, and PC Music all throughout it. I heard bands that I loved in high school like I See Stars and Breathe Carolina. I also heard artists that shaped my final years in college like Brockhampton and Lil Aaron, and I heard futuristic poppy music that I was just getting into like Charli XCX and SOPHIE. 1000 gecs wound up on my album of the year list for 2019, and just recently, guest writer Jack Gol gave a succinct rationale for it being one of the best releases of the decade. So yeah, 100 gecs are that band.\n\nIt’s not often I’m looking forward to a specific song release, let alone a remix, but one month ago Charli XCX fan account @FckyeahCharli posted this video of producer umru playing a remix of 100 gecs’ “ringtone,” and I’ve been looking forward to hearing it in-full ever since. The remix featured PC Music pop star Charli XCX, agro rapper Rico Nasty, and kawaii indie band Kero Kero Bonito. That lineup, while unexpected, made almost too much sense in the context of the song. Despite their seemingly divergent styles, these three artists fit into the chaotic world of 100 gecs like a second home.\n\nToday 100 gecs released that star-studded remix of “ringtone,” and it’s every bit as explosive and life-affirming as I had hoped. Within the context of the original record, “ringtone” was the sugary-sweet heart beating at the center of the LP. Surrounded by booming electronics, and chrome-covered bangers, “ringtone” was a precious song about love in the internet age. It captures a specific brand of zoomer lifestyle comprised mostly of jumping between text chains, group DMs, chatrooms, and real-life obligations all while trying to maintain a meaningful relationship in the process.\n\nWithin the song, the titular ‘ringtone’ represents a sort of unique sonic identifier that cuts through the noise of life and technology to let our narrator know that it takes precedence over whatever else is currently happening. It’s a specific countermeasure to our increasingly connected world and a lovely narrative device to depict a relationship with. “ringtone” is also the record’s most humanistic and wholesome song; a momentary reprieve from the bombastic electronics and overpowering emotions that surround it. At the end of the day, “ringtone” is an extremely simple and straightforward love song, which ironically makes it one of 100 gec’s most unique.\n\nWhat was once the love-ridden centerpiece of the group’s debut is now a joyous multi-faceted celebration that also reflects the wildly-diverse future of pop music. Beginning with Charli XCX’s pitch-perfect reinterpretation of Laura Les’ chorus, the listener is immediately thrown back into the love-sick context of the original song. Charli’s verse is fast-moving and over-the-top, evoking all the best parts of her self-titled record with fast cars, champagne, and nights out with friends.\n\nFrom there, Sarah Bonito enters with a verse that would have sounded perfectly in-place on Bonito Generation bearing her trademarked rapped delivery punctuated by zany background effects ripe for cute proto-TikTok videos. After another chorus from Charli, Rico Nasty commandeers the song as she belts out a line that makes my heart melt every time I hear it: “I think I might be addicted to your kisses.” She sing-raps her first few lines over a wall of ascending heavy metal guitars that feel like that peaking moment of elation as the roller coaster slowly reaches its apex. Nasty continues to spit a tight and (mostly) clean verse that captures the emotions of a budding relationship with as much badassery and pizzaz as we’ve come to expect from her.\n\nThe cherry on top comes after one more mini-appearance by the KKB singer where Laura Les comes back to perform her original chorus but stops short and asks Charli XCX to sing it once again, just because it sounds that good.\n\nThe ringtone remix is a goosebump-inducing endorphin-producing portrayal of love. It’s hyper-collaborative and cosmically low-stakes, but personable and exhilarating beyond words. This song captures the unbridled euphoria of having a crush and finding out that they feel the same way about you. It makes my knees weak and my heart full. If the rest of 2020 sounds half as good as this remix, then we truly are living in the future.\n\nAlbums of The Decade in An Era of Real Change: A Fan’s Look at Music in The 2010s\n\nThe personal experience of listening to music is probably my favorite feeling in the entire world. There is nothing more cathartic, more soul-stirring, or more fundamentally interesting than taking in a great album; it just feels like the most intrinsic and natural form of human artistic heights. Getting into music has been my defining experience over the last decade. The slow movement from the music that your parents leave you towards entirely new directions that allow you to discover the eternally vast catalog of human creativity is something that I feel like defines the adolescence of most music fans. There is so much with music, so much to talk about and to dive deeper in to. Within the past 5 years, I have managed to discover bands and artists who have spoken to me in such distinctly personal ways that it sometimes feels like direct communication. And yet I always feel like I have just scraped the tip of the iceberg. I just know there is so much more out there, so many new experiences, music heading into 2020 looks incredibly bright.\n\nThe 2010s were an insanely groundbreaking and paradigm-shifting time in the music industry; the entire experience and market of music has been digitized for better or for worse, and social media and the internet now replace the predominance of the label from the 2000s. Genres were innovated upon in ways that couldn’t even be imagined in 2009; production, sound design, and countless other technical musical aspects are now truly in their golden age of growth and development. Technology has helped musical achievement reach new heights, but these are only the tools. What is even more remarkable is the breakout in the brand new, vastly diverse and unique, and revolutionary voices which were only so rarely accessed in music before. Queer, trans, POC, and all varieties of marginalized voices made their impact and poignancy common knowledge; the 2010s were the decade where the music industry truly lost white heteronormative orthodoxy as its defining trait. So many new genres, new ideas and forms, and even experiments in what music itself is have become prominent. The 2010s were the new apex of musical change and innovation.\n\nAfter months of subconsciously thinking about how I would order my favorites from this decade, eventually, I couldn’t help but put the time into doing something like this. It felt right to me, and I genuinely appreciate anyone who shares in this experience with me. I really do think these are the best 100 albums of the decade, and I will attempt, with increasing fervor, to offer why I think so. However, the line between “best” and “favorite” is always a strange territory to me; because music is such a subjective experience, all music criticism is personal judgment by its very nature. Thus, I understand how personal this list is, and I hope that, in a way, it maybe helps the project: this is really just one experience of music, categorized just for the sake of it. Thank you for reading.\n\n100 | Rihanna - Loud (2010)\n\nLoud is a collection of some of the most undeniable hits to come out of this decade, as well as a bold harbinger of the veracity with which pop as a genre would make itself known in the 2010s. Rihanna harnesses the charisma of her earlier works and melds it into a grown-up, revolutionary pop arrangement that would come to define the latter half of her career. Songs like “S&M” are classic iPod Touch-core and bring forward a strange sense of nostalgia upon further relisten. This album is one of the pop landmarks of the 2010s.\n\n99 | Noname - Room 25 (2018)\n\nRoom 25, from Chicago veteran Noname, is a thoughtfully provocative album that takes on patriarchy and racial injustice through the lens of whimsicality and comedic overthrow. Long is the tradition of the subtle protest album, records railing out against a diseased and broken culture just as much as they are at any specific political figure. This album is a rich continuation in this legacy. Noname’s flow is effortless and soaring as she rises and falls across bars about injustice and oppression as easily as if she were reading a YA novel. Room 25 intends to convey the banality of evil and greed in our modern capitalist culture, and how this is rerouted through the lenses of race and gender. Noname, with her technical skill and superb political awareness, is exactly the right voice to do so.\n\n98 | Sidney Gish - No Dogs Allowed (2018)\n\nSidney Gish creates music that is somehow nostalgic without referring back to any specific era or event. Listening to No Dogs Allowed makes you wistful for a bygone era you weren't actually sure ever existed. The songs on this record have an innately charming and ethereal nature to them, basking them in a layer of familiarity that most music can only achieve after repeated listens. Gish is infinitely likable and constructs well-made songs that play exactly to their strengths. No Dogs Allowed is an amazing look at the later Gen Z experience in America today and strikes a deserved chord with many other queer young people. This record is easily one of the most criminally underlooked of the past five years.\n\n97 | Megan Thee Stallion - Fever (2019)\n\nMegan Thee Stallion wants you to know that she is bad as hell in every sense of the word. This album is an affirmation of both her badness and skill for delivering fun slapper tracks. The album is a lengthy testament solely to the act and lifestyle of being a pimp. As an album, it represents a new sort of gender equality within the rap scene. It’s a 40-minute-long acceptance and celebration of the fact that women can also make dope, focused, and invigorating tracks about all traditional rap topics with just as much self-importance and braggadocio. Megan is impatient for her rise, but Fever shows that this desire is less immature and more important; her voice is powerful and belongs on the forefront of the contemporary rap scene.\n\n96 | Radiohead - A Moon Shaped Pool (2016)\n\nA Moon Shaped Pool is Radiohead’s most depressing and mournful record yet, which is a pretty big statement for a band that's made some of the most desolate and unsettling songs ever. Thom Yorke’s voice has ripened even further with age, growing even more ghostlike and otherworldly over the electronic and dream pop-influenced instrumentals. A Moon Shaped Pool is a haunting treatise on impermanence, death, aging, and the legacy we leave behind through art after we are gone. For a band so late in their career, Radiohead maintain a youthful ability to adapt and grow their sound to an evolving musical world, and this skill is one of the reasons they deserve their status as one of the best bands to grace the Earth.\n\n95 | Beach House - Bloom (2012)\n\nBloom is the ultimate stadium pop album, a dreamy pop piece from an era of oversaturatedness and insincerity in the genre around them. What makes Beach House so honest is their refusal to reinvent the wheel; they may lean heavily on their influences, but they still produce top-notch music which is amazing for what it is. This album, however, is their most original; Beach House delve into the darkened corners of their own sound, breaking the way for their comfortable pace the rest of their discography. This is one of the best dream pop records this decade.\n\n94 | King Krule - The OOZ (2017)\n\nKing Krule creates an incredible exploration into the nature of misery with The OOZ. This record is one of the somberest of the decade, wallowing in depressively lengthy songs and featuring decrepitly introspective songwriting and aesthetic choices. Krule’s deep and rumbling cadence is an enabler of his musical direction, allowing him to truly sell the depth of the misery and depression he reflects upon as fully personal and authentic music. This record, while not essential for every type of music fan, is a poignant and valuable look into the manifestation of depression into art, something those of us with the illness must reconcile with as we seek to create. Krule is authentic, resonating, and triumphant.\n\n93 | DaBaby - KIRK (2019)\n\nDaBaby is one of America’s new favorite media personalities, in no small part due to the fact that he radiates sincerity in everything he says and does. In every interview, be it in the aftermath of his recent unjust arrest and police harassment in his native Charlotte or on Saturday Night Live, DaBaby is stunningly kind, evocative, charismatic, and hilarious. His music is absolutely reflective of this sincerity, and KIRK is one of the most fun and energizing hip hop records of the decade. His flow remains unchallengably appealing, switching from hit to hit in almost equally bangertastic verses that make you feel like you can run through a wall or punch a cop and get away with it. DaBaby is also unlauded for his ability to bring out good things from others, scoring noticeably above par verses from the likes of Moneybagg Yo and Stunna 4 Vegas which play up from the artist’s usual performance. DaBaby had the epicest 2019 there was.\n\n92 | Fleet Foxes - Helplessness Blues (2011)\n\nThe Fleet Foxes are masters of creating ambiance, and Helplessness Blues is the full realization of this knack as well as the full realization of Robin Pecknold’s vocal talent. Brooding and existential lyrics are veiled in a sash of fluttery strings and naturalistic production. The experience of listening to Fleet Foxes is part of what makes their music good itself; one can’t help but feel at ease when Peckinold is sliding angelically over a sound which can be most accurately described as ‘early Bon Iver but woodsier.’ This album is a key piece of early decade folk and one of the most atmospheric pieces of the decade.\n\n91 | JPEGMAFIA - Veteran (2018)\n\nJPEGMAFIA has recreated the protest song for a new generation, combining leftist liberatory thematic spins and industrial-influenced production to create one of the most political and striking records of the past few years. Internet culture and its influence is absolutely marked on the work, but is nowhere near as saturated and essential to its understanding than his other projects. Veteran is accessible, ravenous, and unforgiving: blame is placed squarely on those who deserve it, and god help those who JPEGMAFIA is able to enact his righteous vengeance upon. Leftist ideology is too rarely directly promoted and understood in contemporary records, and is even more rarely done well; Veteran is this done at its best.\n\n90 | Ariana Grande - Sweetener (2018)\n\nStanding in contrast to the brooding and serious thematic spin of 2019’s Thank U, Next, Sweetener is a treatise on positivity, happiness, and the everlasting energy of the human spirit. Sweetener celebrates the divine nature of budding relationships love, passion, and the emotional ensemble that comes with it. This album also was the first to truly establish Grande as a certified hit-maker, with songs like “God Is A Woman” serving as key set pieces which both advance the album and manage to stand on their own as individual pieces. Ariana’s 2010’s career has been the definition of turbulent, and Sweetener represents an already bygone era and radiating love and positivity which emerged from it.\n\n89 | Blueface - Dirt Bag (2019)\n\nI promise this is not a bit, I really think that Blueface is one of 2019’s freshest rap voices. Blueface is a connoisseur of the dense rap bar and, Dirt Bag hones his ability to deliver biting punchlines into even more memorable choruses following his breakthrough Famous Cryp. Blueface’s lifestyle, worldview, and hedonism are fully celebrated and advertised on the EP: Songs such as “Bussdown” and “Bleed It” represent some of his best songwriting to date. Blueface’s untamed and cascading flow may be off-putting to some, but he carries bars and swings through verses on levels of imagery like no other contemporary artist. This tape is a promising performance from one of rap’s coolest new voices.\n\n88 | Death Grips - The Money Store (2012)\n\nThe Money Store is one of 4 Death Grips projects featured on this list; it is reasonable to say that no band had a more consistent, full decade run than the titanic Death Grips. And, although Exmilitary is excellent and influential in its own right, The Money Store is when it all really started; the hype, the bits, and everything tangential to the band’s notorious internet fanbase really began with this album. Completely aside from all that dumb trivial crap, Death Grips can be seen coming into their own throughout the album; harvesting their virulent and pulsating sound, showcasing the flawless drumming of Zach Hill, and creating choruses and hooks which are just as impactful with today’s youth as punk was in the 80s. The Money Store was the beginning of a legendary run.\n\n87 | Toby Fox - UNDERTALE Soundtrack (2016)\n\nI am anti-soundtrack, as a person. I generally don’t love soundtracks to movies or games, and they don’t often stick out to me as independent pieces of work. I’m absolutely a soundtrack Grinch. But I can not even begin to imply that the Undertale soundtrack is nothing other than a work of virtuoso from a man who is just as good of a music producer as he is of a game designer. Undertale transcends its status as the ultimate meme music not by shunning it, but by outshining it through the sheer charmingness and sprightliness of the short songs and the resounding poignancy of the longer-form atmospheric tracks. It is far and away the best soundtrack to any piece of media that I have heard in a long time; it stands as a complete work, and I consider it to be an album.\n\n86 | Rico Nasty and Kenny Beats - Anger Management (2019)\n\nThe 2nd shortest project on this list, Anger Management makes its veracity known and leaves its mark fully within the 20 minutes the listener has with it. Kenny Beats is a producer coming fully into his own, and the production on Anger Management reinforces the legitimacy of said rise; there is not one dull sounding moment, and the ferociousness of Rico’s flow never allows for one slow moment. Kenny and Rico are a powerful duo heading into the next decade, and this tape offers hope for even lengthier cooperative projects. However, the album has maintained its status as an energetic festival since release, and will likely only grow more revered with time.\n\n85 | Jeff Rosenstock - WORRY (2016)\n\nJeff Rosenstock is the definitional cool old head, in no small part because he is still making music that whips ass about 10 to 15 years after the high-point of his career. WORRY, besides being an undeniably charming and endearing record, is some of the best garage rock/ska-influenced rock that’s been released this decade. Rosenstock has a knack for constructing surprisingly wholesome and poignant love songs and lyrical arrangements, and guitar work on this album is fabulously technical. This record represents the best of a genre creating music as they do best.\n\n84 | Car Seat Headrest - Teens Of Denial (2016)\n\nTeens Of Denial is one of the best conventional rock records to be released in a long time. While it lacks the artistic vision and grandiose thematic construction of Twin Fantasy, Will Toledo’s incredible lyricism is even more the centerpiece of this album. Lyrics that are as common as they are poetic, like my personal favorite, “I did not transcend, I just felt like a piece of shit in a stupid looking jacket,” strike a chord because they are funny, relatable in some way or other, and somehow still incredibly poignant. Will Toledo’s voice is amazing (as it always is), and Teens of Denial was an impressive reflection of a band about to truly come into stride and hit their peak.\n\n83 | Deakin - Sleep Cycle (2017)\n\nIn the 2010s, synth-pop titans Animal Collective maintained a steady yet comparatively uninspired pace, choosing instead to develop their solo careers. Sleep Cycle is the best of these solo projects and is notable for being a vocal-based album by a member of the band who was not a primary vocalist. Deakin’s voice is soothing and distant, ushering in the otherworldliness and kindness which caused Animal Collective’s work to resonate with so many. Additionally, Deakin establishes his prowess as a solo artist with his own artistic vision.\n\n82 | Vampire Weekend - Modern Vampires Of The City (2013)\n\nVampire Weekend permanently toe the line of bourgeoisie corniness and perfectly made yacht rock, and Modern Vampires Of The City is the band at their most creative and genuine. Ezra Koening and crew will always sound like a song made for Kia commercials, although if Neo Yokio is any indication, the band operates with this fully in mind. However, this doesn’t mean the music is bad in any sense of the world; Vampire Weekend produce music that is so insanely well crafted that it wraps back around to feeling inauthentic in some way. The band manages to make this sincerity known with heart-wrenching songs like “Hannah Hunt,” and as always Koenig’s smooth and reassuring voice is a highlight of the album and a treat to hear. Despite everything, Vampire Weekend slaps and will continue to slap. Ezra’s grand design is beyond our mortal plane of understanding.\n\n81 | Denzel Curry - ZUU (2019)\n\nI hate to nuance positive reviews with negativity, but it needs to be said; I thought Denzel Curry was pretty crap before ZUU. I still think that “TA300” or however it's spelled is a cornball-bonanza, and I thought there was no way the follow-up would be anywhere close to good. I was dead wrong. Denzel Curry managed to harness all the good, endearing parts scattered in his previous work and congeal them into a 30-minute banger fest based on South Florida pride. ZUU works extremely well because it is a catchy, non-assuming record that seeks only to deliver the highest possible frequency of kickassishness it can within its short running time. And for the most part, it succeeds, forming a lasting contribution to the 2010’s rap canon.\n\n80 | (Sandy) Alex G - Rocket (2017)\n\n(Sandy) Alex G is the most relevant voice in neo-folk to emerge this decade, doing so largely by constructing a sound that is warmly inviting and understanding of the difficulties of the modern rural/suburban experience. Although there are experimental tracks like “Brick” scattered throughout the record, the core of the album’s arc is a story of the warmth of domesticity, the ethereal nature of family, and the wistful beauty of a domestic existence. (Sandy) Alex G’s music is charming to its core, unassuming about the listener, and a completely self-contained experience that is somehow also universal in its messaging.\n\n79 | Courtney Barnett - Sometimes I Sit and Think, and Sometimes I Just Sit (2015)\n\nCourtney Barnett possesses a knack for bitingly real lyrics and sound songwriting, which has rightfully allowed for her to be recognized as one of the best singer-songwriters this generation. Songs on Sometimes I Sit and Think are morose, relevant, familiar, and loving all the same; it is an insanely smart testament to the strangeness of the modern human condition. I would also be remiss to not mention how hard the bass lines and guitar choruses hit on this album. The ability to combine such fierce songwriting with powerful music is all too rare in rock today, which is why Barnett’s breakthrough was such a breath of fresh air when it first released and still remains so to this day.\n\n78 | Slowdive - Slowdive (2017)\n\nReunion albums always pose a risk of severe disappointment, especially when said band is as relevant to the development of a genre and music internet tastes as Slowdive are. Instead of wavering under such expectations, Slowdive soared, delivering one of the best shoegaze albums of the decade and a highly worthy addition to the Slowdive canon. While not a revolutionary reimagining of their previous sound, the eponymous album continues the band’s uncanny knack for creating dreamy, refreshing soundscapes, which are the sonic equivalent of the eternally pleasant feeling of the cold side of the pillow. Many shoegaze bands have come and gone since Souvlaki’s release in 1994, but with their 2017 return, Slowdive proved that their ethereal magic is eternal.\n\n77 | Tame Impala - Currents (2015)\n\nKevin Parker’s follow up to the breakout Lonerism establishes him as one of the most influential and prominent producers and sound designers of the century. The sleek, techno-rock filtered production aesthetic so carefully created by Parker more than carries famously maligned weak points such as “Past-Life.” Meanwhile, the high points of the album such as “Let It Happen,” and “Eventually” stand as some of the most sonically pleasing songs of the decade. If Rihanna thinks that Tame Impala songs sound good enough to be on the masterful ANTI, I trust that judgment.\n\n76 | alt-J - Relaxer (2017)\n\nI went to an alt-J concert shortly after Relaxer was released. Every bandmember stood amongst their synthesizers on stage, harmonizing and doing what they do while thousands of tranced-out/high teenagers danced rabidly to the music. The concert, much like the band and this album, was not a repudiation of their critics or reimagination of their style, but a celebration of their particular approach to indie music. To this day, the show’s pure, simple, and positive essence remains one of my fondest live music experiences. Similarly, the group’s third effort is an unassuming yet remarkable record if only for its sheer dedication to the craft of creating enjoyable, layered psych trance-pop. alt-J focuses not on pretenses, but on making pleasant and thoughtful music, and Relaxer is their best work yet.\n\n75| Freddie Gibbs & Madlib - Bandana (2019)\n\nAlthough their first collaboration produced the renowned Piñata, Freddie Gibbs and Madlib found their true sound on Bandana. Madlib proves that, as we all know, he is still one of the forefront producers in the world; it feels canned talking about Madlib production at a certain point (what hasn’t been said?), but it really is that good. Gibbs continues his incredible post-wrongful-arrest hot streak into 2019 with this record, delivering fierce and firm bars with little breathing room from top to bottom of the tracklist. He even drops an anti-vaxxer line and it still kinda hits, that’s how hard this record is. “Classic” style rap records made in the 2010s were rarely ever non-derivative, yet Bandana feels wholly original and self-created.\n\n74 | Lil Peep - Come Over When You’re Sober, Part I (2017)\n\nThe story of 2010’s rap is impossible to tell without the inclusion of Lil Peep. One of the original artists to become popular off of Soundcloud following and an originator of the rise of “emo rap,” Peep's music reflected the bitter realities of his life with the same kind, soft-hearted emotionality which continues to resonate with fans of his work long after his death. The music itself exists on the fringes of misery, a world full of painful break-ups and the all-encompassing horror of drug addiction. Yet somehow, his outlook and talent shine through this misery, delivering songs that are empathetic yet empowering. The music scene and the world is a darker place without him.\n\n73 | Bon Iver - 22, A Million (2016)\n\n22, A Million came at a critical juncture in Bon Iver’s career. The album represents a move completely in the experimental direction, abandoning the comfort zone of guitars and understated ballads for an intriguing and admirable voyage into the dregs of Justin Vernon’s psyche. This album is primarily about feelings, and thus the music is designed mostly to procure an emotional and wistful response above all else. The detached sort of imagination I am placed in whenever I listen to this album is a testament to its success in this objective. The longer songs on this album are striking in their permanence and their emotional impact. I have listened to very few albums which so effortlessly throw me into introspection, and the cascading beauty of this album has been a comfort many times in my life.\n\n72 | SOPHIE - Oil of Every Pearl’s Uninsides (2018)\n\nSOPHIE is one of the seminal producers and most visible trans musicians in the industry today. Her debut album, a techno-influenced dream pop extravaganza, is a triumphant reflection on both existing as a trans person, a woman in the music industry, and an isolated being in the cold and expansive universe. Sometimes, this is done through erotically biting distorted bangers such as “Ponyboy” other times through distant, ethereal angelic pleading like on “Is it Cold In The Water?” Diversity and confusion is a key aspect of SOPHIE’s existence, and this album manifests this into an artistic avenue and a bold exploration that is immeasurably valuable for those unversed in her experience.\n\n71 | Chance The Rapper - Acid Rap (2013)\n\nBefore Chance became the ambassador for cornballs nationwide, he was an up-and-coming rapper who rightfully broke into the mainstream consciousness with his excellent tape, Acid Rap. A product of an early 2010’s hip hop scene which was largely devoid of new ideas and fresh talent, Chance was able to establish himself as a master of fun, catchy hip-hop/ R&B fusion tracks that inspire emotions of youthful revelry and a world full of wild possibilities. Chance also uses his album as a platform for other Chicago artists yet to break into the public consciousness through fabulously crafted features from Saba and Noname. While his public image has shifted more towards Chance the Capper, Acid Rap is still an excellent record from a now bygone era of hip hop.\n\n70 | Young Thug - Jeffery (2016)\n\nYoung Thug’s dynamic follow-up to the equally-strong Barter 6 is a reintroduction of his true self to a hip-hop scene that still was not ready to accept his talent. And, unsurprisingly to his fans, he reaffirmed his status as one of trap’s most eccentric and imaginative voices, constructing a genre-bending fusion feast which holds its originality and fire to this day. Jeffery operates as a Young Thug’s “Self Titled” of sorts, describing the vast, bright majesty of his lifestyle and the connections in life that he has made. Young Thug albums, when they are at their best, are joyous celebrations of humanity and the ties we can make, be they sexual, romantic, platonic, or any of the weird sorts of bonds in between. Jeffery is a fantastic collection of songs with this spirit fully imbued into them, coming out from the seams to explode into one of the most empowering albums of the decade.\n\n69 | Beyoncé - Beyoncé (2013)\n\nSelf-titled albums, as a concept, are about the musicians themselves and the lives they lead. Beyoncé’s self-titled work, from the height of her popularity and the beginning of her cultural indomitability, is focused squarely on her. Beyoncé has developed a voice, an important and valuable voice, and she intends to share it. The thematic focus on women’s empowerment and emboldenment, often through means of wealth and fabulousness, are equal parts reflective of a bygone Obama era neoliberal optimism and a powerful statement rooted in generations of struggle. This album is a testament to the conflict which is black existence in America in the 2010s, and it is executed marvelously. Also, “Partition” bears one of the best beat switches of the decade.\n\n68 | Ariana Grande - thank u, next (2019)\n\nSongs on thank u, next sound organically cool. Ariana crafts it to seem like she isn't really trying when she makes her lyrics; they're just about how boss she is and the boss life that she leads. However, a close listen reveals that this blasé veneer is just as purposeful and well done as anything else the pop star has ever touched. The emotional reckoning with the highly public nature of her turbulent love life combined with the death of a loved one came together to form a profoundly sincere and thoughtful piece. Ariana is a badass still, and wants you to know it; songs like “7 rings” and “Break up With Your Boyfriend, I’m Bored” are so good that you won’t soon forget that fact. But, as humans are eternally complicated and internally conflicted, Ariana also relays and grapples with sentimentality, romance, loss, and their coexistence all at once. Additionally, the structural tracklist choice of putting the singles exclusively at the end of the record is a bold and rewarding selection, which fits amazingly within the organization of the album.\n\n67 | Carly Rae Jepsen - EMOTION (2015)\n\nCarly Rae Jepsen is a the master of the chorus. One of my closest friends and I have spent many hours discussing *exactly* what makes EMOTION such a fabulous pop project, and we couldn’t help but settle on the chorus writing as one of the primary reasons. Carly creates extended, heart-wrenching, cascading choruses as if it were the easiest thing to do in the world, and loads the album (and B-sides) full of them. Smart pop songs are very often outwardly enjoyable and inwardly miserable, and Carly writes lyrics and songs which are the perfect embodiment of this phenomenon. This album has helped to define a generation of pop and is one of the most influential records on this list.\n\n66 | Blueface - Famous Cryp (2018)\n\nWhat makes Blueface good? This is a question many of you are probably wondering at this point in the list; I am here to preach the gospel of chasing a bag and worrying not what others are doing. Blueface songwriting exists in a comic-book universe, where gangbanging heroes pull up and bleed it in broad daylight. Crypping and bravery are the currency of this universe, and our protagonist is rich. Blueface lyrics are densely layered with humor and otherworldliness: from the insanely Freudian extended metaphor of people’s piece being directly referred to as their “second dick” to the bars about owning a minivan and dealing with romantic partners who don't understand object permanence. In this universe, rapping is storytelling and the beat is a suggestion that can be played with and hopped in and out of. Blueface is a master wordsmith and one of the best musicians in the game when it comes to ‘worldbuilding’ through music; his aesthetic vision and artistic representation of the life he leads and the debauchery he participates in is highly developed.\n\n65 | Kanye West - My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy (2010)\n\nSo much has already been said about this album, and how could that not be the case? My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy redefined what hip-hop albums were supposed to look like, sound like, and be structured like in the new decade; no album has been a bigger trendsetter and cultural pariah as this one. The production still holds up after almost a full decade, creating the first true Kanye West masterful soundscape and making an album about being an irredeemable asshole sound like it came from a gospel choir. I won’t dwell on how fantastic this album is; this has been done by better music reviewers than I many times over. But to omit it from this list would be a staunch disservice.\n\n64 | Vince Staples - Big Fish Theory (2017)\n\nVince Staples is very good at rapping. Technical, concise rapping and flows are done better than Vince by few in the music scene today. Such talent and technicality is the thematic basis for Big Fish Theory, an album with a clear focus as a showcase of the insane talent of Staples and to claim his rightful place at the forefront of contemporary rap. This album achieves this not only through sole reliance on Staples’ revelry, but the eclectic hip-hop production of SOPHIE, creating an Avengers-tier collaboration on “Yeah Right” with Kendrick Lamar. Lyrics on this album are also notably poignant for their strong and powerful political messaging, all coming together to form an excellent rap record.\n\n63 | Jai Paul - Leak 04-13 (Bait Ones) (2013)\n\nThe Jai Paul story is a tragic legend, recounted on music message boards and leak websites for years. That is, until he returned from the shadows with a heartfelt and memorable twitter post and then released the formerly leaked work officially, not in its intended final form but as it was, as Bait Ones, which in spite of everything is still fantastic. Jai Paul has one of god’s chosen voices; something about it daunts you and hangs over the soundscape in your head like an eternal musical poltergeist. The songs are mostly either unfinished or demos, but they are fantastic and imaginative and a completely novel approach to pop nonetheless. The album’s incompleteness is part of the mythos, a work permanently hampered by time yet resilient through all of that nonetheless. Also, in a major upside, he kept the really cool cover which is one of my favorites of the decade. Cool ass album.\n\n62 | Taylor Swift - RED (2012)\n\nThis album comes from a beautiful midpoint in Taylor Swift’s career, the juncture between her earlier pop-country act and her future full-on arena pop direction. What is left in the middle is a sprawling and revolutionary pop record, the best she has ever released and her essential contribution to the 2010’s pop canon. Swift employs her skill for catchy songwriting and earnestness found in her earlier albums, and refines it into a mature and developed pop sound; her artistry comes into its own with this album. All the things Taylor Swift has been praised for for years, be it her fabulous songwriting and riveting orchestration and arrangement, is best on RED. The album is a feat of Americana and one of the best traditional pop albums of the era.\n\n61 | Arcade Fire - The Suburbs (2010)\n\nThe Suburbs is the swan song of the first era of Arcade Fire’s sound; a wistful and optimistic reflection on life in the endless American cultural wasteland which is the suburbs. Those of us who grew up where all houses looked the same for hours on end can have something specific resonate upon listening to this album. Win Butler knows how it feels to exist as a young person in this marginal suburban experience, and the band is able to transpose this feeling across an epic of a rock album. The Suburbs is not the peak of the band’s songwriting, and really that's not an insult considering how Arcade Fire has written some of the best songs of all time, but it still delivers its message with enthusiasm and vitriol.\n\n60 | Tierra Whack - Whack World (2018)\n\nI feel like, because so much (rightful) attention has been given to the conceptual arc of Whack World as a 15 minute/15 song album, many have failed to commend just how structurally good songs and Tierra Whack’s rapping are themselves. Every blurb on this record manages to be catchy and memorable, creating a rich, cultured soundscape that lingers in your memory for days after listening. Tierra Whack sought to identify the base and concise components of what makes music good, and she absolutely succeeded. It is one of the most imaginative projects of the decade.\n\n59 | Tame Impala - Lonerism (2012)\n\nOn this record, quite unscrupulously titled to its thematic focus on loneliness and isolation, Kevin Parker was able to synthesize 60’s era pop patterns with cutting-edge production. The result is something that is most accurately described as “The Beatles Through A Sepia Instagram Filter”: the sound is breathtakingly familiar yet surprisingly new. Tame Impala’s music is as much original as it is a reimagining of previous sounds. On this album, Parker is more lucid and honest about himself and his life than on any other Tame Impala effort. It is the best album from a band that makes good albums, and the one with the tightest thematic focus and actual positive factors that don’t hinge solely on production.\n\n58 | Snail Mail - Lush (2018)\n\nLindsay Jordan is one of the best voices in rock today, and Lush serves as a fantastic debut and introduction of her talents. Aside from her angelic, haunting voice, the songwriting and arrangement skills of Jordan are sublime. Songs on this album are never too short, nor do they overstay their welcome; and when they are playing, the lyrical density and metaphorical motifs inserted into the record are phenomenally deep. This album is well-written, well-made, well-realized, and well-executed, and rarely are debut albums all of these things. Lush is an essential part of the 2010’s rock canon, and Snail Mail will be a core part of the 2020s rock canon.\n\n57 | Mitski - Be The Cowboy (2018)\n\nMitski’s popularity exploded with Be The Cowboy, partially as a testament to the excellence of her earlier career, but largely because the album is a culmination of her journey and her most polished and researched sound to date. She has found her songwriting niche as the master of vagueness and subtlety; lines like the choruses of “Two Slow Dancers” and the lines about venus and global warming which manage to be heart-wrenching and desolate despite being trivial at a surface level. Mitski challenges you to understand the struggles she faces and her reckoning with past abusive relationships through the same lens that she does. She executes this challenge by creating compelling, haunting, and universally appealing music that is even more rewarding to those who relisten and attempt to dig deeper into what the album has to offer. It is one of the most layered releases to be put out in years and is a testament to the power of songwriting and poetry. Oh, and her singing is still, like, top 5 in the business right now. That helps a lot too.\n\n56 | Weyes Blood - Titanic Rising (2019)\n\nTitanic Rising is one of the best chamber pop/singer-songwriter records of the decade, an astounding latecomer of this decade that also serves as an introduction to one of the industries’ most promising figures of the next. The lyrics on this album are phenomenal, some of the best on this list: eternally wise and striking mantras such as “true love is making a comeback” are so commonplace on this album that it feels ordinary in its excellency. So many great records came out in 2019, and this record is reflective of a completely unique vain of this fabulousness; Weyes Blood have returned to the sounds of mid-70s under-recognized artists, such as Joni Mitchell, and completely refined it for a beautiful new sound.\n\n55 | KIDS SEE GHOSTS - KIDS SEE GHOSTS (2018)\n\nOut of the most bizarre and disappointing era of the Kanye West arc comes the collaborative project with Kid Cudi KIDS SEE GHOSTS, a bottled-lightning record, and a testament to the maintained dominance of West as the world’s forefront producer and audio technician. Kids See Ghosts is Kanye at his inward and polished, a digital sandbox of songs constructed with his favorite collaborator on his own terms. While the context of Kanye’s horridness at the time of this record’s release can not be removed from the albums aesthetic, the magnificent and empowering songwriting and high-effort contributions from Cudi are able to exhibit profound beauty also within the confines of the 24-minute work. This album is musically infallible, intense, and a key testament to the new heights of production capable in the modern era. Kanye West has never produced better than this album.\n\n54 | Sufjan Stevens - The Age Of Adz (2010)\n\nThe Age of Adz is Sufjan Steven’s wildest sound to date, a cacophony of noise experimentation and electronic riffing that comes together with his genteel singing to form a reflective, brooding, and stunning album. The album opens with what is probably the masterwork of Sufjan’s conventional style and ends with a 27-minute-long sprawling opus of a song that could easily be qualified as an EP in and of itself. The kicker is that everything in the middle of “Futile Devices” and “Impossible Soul” is completely distinct from the ideas and sound of the opener and closer. The sounds and motifs on this album are experimental yet well-considered, a combination so rare in forays into the unknown. Sufjan had a plan for this album, all the twists and turns which it goes through and decisions it makes, and it is executed immaculately.\n\n53 | Death Grips - No Love Deep Web (2012)\n\nNo Love Deep Web is a snapshot of Death Grips at the high point of their visceralness and intensity; few records released this decade contain the raw untapped power created in some of these songs. Zach Hill, who I personally believe to be the most paramount member of the band, is unstoppable with his drumming on this album. Few have managed to drive the entire arc of songs and be at the forefront of the musical ensemble quite like Hill has, especially on this album. Although the band has evolved into something newer and greater, No Love Deep Web is an essential look at the peak of the band’s first wave.\n\n52 | Father John Misty - I Love You, Honeybear (2015)\n\nJosh Tillman has one of the sweetest voices in all of music today, and he takes this indescribable talent all the way to the bank on his brilliant sophomore album. Misty’s bitter pessimism and misanthropy are disguised and even enhanced by the divine beauty of his voice; the contrast of the bitterness and resignation of his songwriting and his singing cadence is the essential crux on which this album succeeds. Songs on this album are empathetic and tender just as much as they are condemnations of human misery. The press cycle around Father John Misty and his uber-eccentric public profile often fails to account for just how good the music really is.\n\n51 | BROCKHAMPTON - Saturation Trilogy (2017)\n\nThe “Brockhampton Moment” meant a lot to a lot of people, including myself. I was really, really into the Saturation albums when I came in to contact with my queerness and realized I wasn’t straight. If anything, I can say that Brockhampton acted as a really refreshing and cool way to reflect on the common anxieties and motivations of queer people in today’s world and the internal struggle of queer American existence. It feels amiss to consider the 3 separate works; for me, Saturation is an extended, magical musical slide across three wonderful albums. However, the Ameer sexual assault situation and his subsequent removal from the band have permanently marred and estranged the albums for me personally; it is hard to erase the mark of the man who is literally on the cover of all 3 albums, and his evils seem to hang over the work. Brockhampton’s 2017 was an insane and eventually tragic moment, but the albums themselves remain important, yet sullied, statements on queer existence.\n\n50 | Black Dresses - Love And Affection For Stupid Little Bitches (2019)\n\nDevi Genetrix and Ada Rook’s chemistry is as tangible as the unending fleeting distortion on every track on this album. The duo explore the trans and -wlw experience through brilliantly layered choruses, early 2000’s nostalgic yet existentially miserable songwriting, and a completely unique sound that relies on the balance between beauty and convolutedness and toes the line everywhere from pop to industrial.

Her natural virtuoso is unmistakable, and her synergy with her brother’s production is a boon to the playout of a lot of her songwriting. I like Billie so much because she makes incredibly honest, youthful, yet wise pop for a generation that is only now finding its voice. Many of the anxieties and absurdities of the album and her public persona strike a sort of familiarity with younger people, who have been faced their entire lives with terrifying existential threats such as climate change and nev"
