        "text": "Lionel Richie\n\nLionel Richie was saying \"Hello\" waaay before Adele. Born in Tuskegee, Alabama, we’re not surprised he’s a southern guy at heart. He’s charmed us all these years winning everything from Grammys, a Golden Globe and even a nomination for an Oscar! (Best Original Song for the film Endless Love). Nowadays he's the smiling face in the judge’s chair on ABC’s American Idol.\n\nPortugal. The Man.\n\nPortugal. The Man. is living proof that the friends you played music with from high school can go on to win a Grammy. The American rock band from Wasilla, Alaska won “Best Pop Duo/Group Performance” for their runaway hit “Feel It Still” in 2018. The band (and classmates of Wasilla High School) consists of John Baldwin Gourley, Zach Carothers, Kyle O’Quin, Jason Sechrist, Eric Howk, and Zoe Manville.\n\nStevie Nicks\n\nWhile she penned arguably one of the biggest songs, like, ever, “Landslide,” while looking out into the mountains in Colorado, Stevie Nicks actually hails from Phoenix, Arizona. A voice like no other, she’s one of the first women in the music biz to prove that she’s just as powerful with her band Fleetwood Mac, or on her own. She’s the only woman to have been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame twice.\n\nEvanescence\n\nEvanescence was formed in Little Rock, Arkansas, but nothing is little about them. Singer and pianist Amy Lee and guitarist Ben Moody recorded separate albums before coming together for the group’s first EP, Fallen. They struck gold as the album has sold more than 17 million copies worldwide with a couple Grammys in tow. They’re planning to release a long-awaited comeback album later this year and we’re ready for them to *briiiing us back to life.*\n\nBillie Eilish\n\nShe’s a baaaaaaad guy, duh! Billie Eilish (full name: Billie Eilish Pirate Baird O’Connell) is a Los Angeles native, growing up in a humble bungalow with her family. At 18, she won every award imaginable with her debut album When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go? She wrote and recorded the entire album with her brother Finneas, creating the entire thing right in his bedroom.\n\nOneRepublic\n\nOneRepublic is an American pop rock band formed in Colorado Springs. The band hit the scene back in 2002 after being discovered as an unsigned act on...Myspace! Besides frontrunner Ryan Tedder (who writes songs for literally everyone), the group consists of guitarist Zach Filkins, guitarist Drew Brown, bassist and cellist Brent Kutzle, drummer Eddie Fisher, and keyboardist Brian Willett.\n\nJohn Mayer\n\nJust think that John Mayer’s “Your Body Is a Wonderland” could be about his memories in Bridgeport, Connecticut, *sigh*. He dabbled in various genres from pop to blues and rock, even being a member of a two person band called Lo-Fi Masters before he became famous. Although he dropped out of Berklee College of Music in Boston to pursue his career, it seemed to have all worked out for him in the end.\n\nGeorge Thorogood and The Destroyers\n\nGeorge Thorogood hails from Wilmington, Delaware and his enthusiastic “boogie-blues” became a staple of 1980s rock radio. This is the group that sang “Bad to the Bone” and “I Drink Alone”. Selling over 15 million albums worldwide, they continue to tour recently celebrating their 40th anniversary of performing in 2014.\n\nAriana Grande\n\nMiss Ariana Grande needs no introduction, but here's one anyway: born Ariana Grande-Butera, Ari grew up in Boca Raton, Florida. She successfully navigated going from clumsy sidekick Cat Valentine in the Nickelodeon series Victorious to famed pop princess. For the first time since The Beatles, she held the top three spots on the Billboard Top 100 in the same week with “7 Rings,” “Break Up With Your Girlfriend,” and “Thank You, Next,” respectively.\n\nOutkast\n\nAh, the group that taught us all how to shake a polaroid picture. American hip hop duo, Outkatst, was formed in 1992 in East Point, Georgia consisting of André 3000 and Antwan “Big Boi” Patton. They paved the way for many from the mid-1990s to the early 2000s, commercializing Southern hip hop while experimenting with funk, jazz, techno, and psychedelia.\n\nBruno Mars\n\nPeter Gene Hernandez (we know him as Bruno Mars) was a young kid with a dream when he moved from his hometown of Honolulu, Hawaii to Los Angeles in 2003 to pursue a musical career. Since his debut album Doo-Wops & Hooligans, he’s charmed us ever since.\n\nPaul Revere and the Raiders\n\nYes, some talent does come out of Idaho! Paul Revere & the Raiders is an American pop-rock band from Boise, Idaho. They defined garage rock to psychedelic pop throughout the 1960s to early 1970s. Ask your parents about them, because they were *Lady Gaga* big back then.\n\nJennifer Hudson\n\nJennifer Kate Hudson was born and raised in Chicago, Illinois. While she only placed 7th on American Idol, it didn’t stop her from becoming a force of nature(!). She ventured into acting too with Dream Girls, where she stands as the only American Idol alum to win an Oscar (Best Supporting Actress).\n\nSlipknot\n\nYou can’t say heavy metal without thinking of Slipknot. The band was founded in Des Moines, Iowa in 1995 with members Shawn Crahan, Joey Jordison, and Paul Gray. Members in the following decade have swapped in and out. Their aggressive image and chaotic live shows are not for everyone, but their diehard fans live for it.\n\nMelissa Etheridge\n\nFrom Leavenworth, Kansas, Melissa Etheridge’s debut album in 1988 was a sleeper hit. She kept the momentum going with her breakthrough album, Yes I Am with her biggest song “Come to My Window.” After being diagnosed with breast cancer in 2004, she returned to the Grammy stage in 2005 with a bald head and a performance of bravery that defined her career.\n\nBilly Ray Cyrus\n\nWhile we know him as Miley’s dad or that guy in Lil Nas’ “Old Town Road” remix, he was quite the act back in his day. Born in Flatwoods, Kentucky, this man has released 16 (sixteen!!) studio albums and is best known for his smash “Achy Breaky Heart.” He’s a pioneer to country music, making line-dancing mainstream in his music video for the hit song.\n\nBritney Spears\n\nOur sweet, Britney, oh where to begin. Britney Spears grew up in Kentwood, Louisiana and was singing and dancing at the age of two. She quickly shed her Disney persona and became America’s sweetheart gone bad girl with hits like “Oops!...I Did It Again” and “Toxic”. She grew up in the spotlight, making some of her greatest music in her darkest moments (yes, we’re talking about Blackout). She’s done everything from a Super Bowl Halftime Show to a Las Vegas residency—this Queen of Pop has paved the way for many pop artists to come.\n\nHowie Day\n\nFrom Bangor, Maine, Howie Day wasn’t originally signed to a record label and released his first album self-financed and self-released. It worked out because he got signed to Epic Records in 2002 and the rest is history. “Collide” is his biggest song to date.\n\nGood Charlotte\n\nAh, Good Charlotte brings back our emo middle school days. Formed in 1996 in Waldorf, Maryland by guitarist and vocalist Benji Madden, vocalist Joel Madden, bassist Paul Thomas, and guitarist and keyboardist Billy Martin. Their breakthrough album was The Young and the Hopeless which over a decade later feels too relevant."
