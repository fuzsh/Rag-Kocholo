        "text": "20-year old breakout singer-songwriter Ari Abdul blesses her fans with this latest self-remix single alongside her debut EP Fallen Angel. \"Fallen Angel\" is a captivating pop-noir work.. Growing up in Catholic School instilled within her an appreciation for the fallen angel narrative that has become so entwined with Lucifer's legacy. With her own story as inspiration, along with help from producer Thomas LaRosa, Ari created a mesmerizing world behind this EP; one steeped in loss and distorted wickedness.\n\nWhat separates Ari Abdul from the countless other pop musicians is her willingness to take risks - like self-remixing nearly all of her tracks before releasing an official EP. This bold move distinguishes her artistry, proving she's not afraid to step outside of traditional boundaries and explore new creative avenues. Her self-remixed tracks like \"BABYDOLL (Speed)\" and \"TASTE (Speed)\" features Ari's signature easy-going and hypnotic guitar melodies along with her enthralling vocal performance, creating an irresistible mix of modern dance-pop and the newly founded witch-pop style that will have you dancing all night long. Ari Abdul truly listens to her fans -- when they love a song, she steps it up and releases an even better version for her fans to latch onto.\n\n“Fallen Angel” EP immediately captivates listeners by giving them a window into the enigmatic world of Abdul with the first song and Ari’s debut single “BABYDOLL.” Tracks like \"BABYDOLL\" and the seductive fan-favorite, \"TASTE,\" blend dark fantasy with an intimate glimpse into her life story. This unique combination creates music that is truly mesmerizing.\n\nWhen asked to describe her EP Fallen Angel, Ari shares...\n\nYou have like these nice, lovely, innocent sounding songs. And by the end of the EP, the songs get really distorted and heavier, and the lyrics get darker. Maybe there'll be an emotion or a little something that happens in my life in a song, but the EP is completely storytelling. We keep pretty melodies, but still have production and lyrics that completely contradict those pretty melodies.\n\nOne of Ari's most beloved tracks, \"HELLGIRL\", is the finale to their transition into a fallen angel. The intensity and emotion in this track will keep you glued until the last note. It offers an ideal demonstration of how their EP contains hauntingly beautiful instrumentals that effortlessly lead up to heavier, distorted sounds.\n\nThe track \"HUSH\" is a particular standout, launching with an impacting beat and groovy bass. This combination serves Ari's bewitching vocals perfectly - the lines,\"Gonna haunt you peacefully/ and keep you company\" paired with the counterpointing lyrics, \"Darling if you can just hush/ your mouth's been moving too much,\" express that shadowy pop sound where Abdul truly thrives.\n\nThe EP tantalizes the listener with glimpses into who Abdul truly is, masterfully blending captivating fantasy and her own life story. Her songs \"BABYDOLL\" and \"TASTE,\" for example, exemplify this creative merging of reality and dreamscapes. Ari Abdul is one fast-rising viral pop star you'll want to keep your eye on if you're a fan of the new wave of witch pop music. Ari Abdul's unique sound, storytelling, and genre-bending creativity proves that she's here to stay and make an impact on the music world.\n\nBe sure to follow Eddie Sing & The 31 Days for his upcoming releases and Exclusive Audio for more music news & releases."
