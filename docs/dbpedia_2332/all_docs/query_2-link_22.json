        "text": "ARi\n\nLos Angeles\n\nLos Angeles-based electronic DJ, Producer and Vocalist. ARi channels inspiration from the early 00's progressive house + trance era. In her sets you are sure to hear energetic danceable drums, emotion-evoking melodies, electrifying synthesizers and infectious rolling bass lines. In early 2022, ARi founded METASIN - a futurist electronic music collective exploring consciousness and healing through sound. METASIN hosts live shows, houses new music releases and produces #MetasinLiveSeries an installment of ongoing live mixes showcasing the best of deep trance, melodic house, melodic techno and progressive house, found exclusively on Youtube. (see link below) ARi is currently standing on the precipice of her first-ever self-produced, studio recorded EP. With her sights set on building out her live shows and progressing her distinct sound, ARi is undeniably coming into her own as an artist, and it's impossible not to be excited for what's to come for this bright, young musician.\n\nARiâs tracks\n\nARi - Metasin Live Series Ep. 011 [Melodic Techno Progressive House Mix] by ARi\n\npublished on 2024-06-17T17:32:15Z\n\nARi - Metasin Live Series Ep. 010 [Melodic Techno Progressive House Mix] by ARi\n\npublished on 2024-02-05T05:53:24Z\n\nARi, Vaughn Anton - Breathe by ARi\n\npublished on 2023-11-20T05:56:49Z\n\nARi - Metasin Live Series Ep. 009 [Melodic Techno Progressive House Mix] by ARi\n\npublished on 2023-09-16T02:00:03Z\n\nARi - Metasin Live Series Ep. 008 [Melodic Techno Progressive House Mix] by ARi\n\npublished on 2023-06-26T05:31:06Z\n\nARi - Metasin Live Series Ep. 007 [Melodic Techno Progressive House Mix] by ARi\n\npublished on 2023-05-12T22:18:25Z\n\nARi - Metasin Live Series Ep. 006 [Melodic Techno Progressive House Mix] by ARi\n\npublished on 2023-04-07T17:59:18Z\n\nARi - Metasin Live Series Ep. 005 [Melodic Techno Progressive House Mix] by ARi\n\npublished on 2023-03-06T08:45:04Z\n\nARi - Metasin Live Series Ep. 004 [Melodic Techno Progressive House Mix] by ARi\n\npublished on 2023-02-05T00:08:12Z\n\nARi - Metasin Live Series Ep. 003 [Melodic Techno Progressive House Mix] by ARi\n\npublished on 2023-01-10T00:19:51Z"
