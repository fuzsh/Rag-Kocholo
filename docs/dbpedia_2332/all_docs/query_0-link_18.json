That influence is heard from the first track “Instant Hit” with a four on the floor steppers-inspired rhythm driven by the drums, bass, and guitar; a rhythmic motif that is a through-line of the record. The recent 2019 Island reissue includes a bonus tune – the group’s powerful rendition of rhythm & blues classic “Heard it Through the Grapevine” that features a monstrous bassline and wonderfully aggressive vocals from singer Ari Up.\n\n– Tana Yonas\n\nRecommended – A1 Instant Hit, B4 Typical Girls, B6 I Heard It Through The Grapevine"
