        "text": "DARE Records announced the all-black female band, LA’DY, has released their debut single titled “Love Me Down” produced by Harmony “H-Money” Samuels. Soulful singer Ashley Kimbraeleads the melodic track while band members Kris Callazo, Zuri Appleby, Michel’Le Baptiste, and Ari O’Neal slay the keys, bass, drums, and guitar. It’s the first single from LA’DY’s forthcoming EP, which is slated to deliver later this year. You can download and stream “Love Me Down” here.\n\nWe are extremely excited for our first single ‘Love Me Down’ to be released,” says LA’DY. “We hope everyone enjoys this sultry R&B single and can’t wait to give y’all more! We’re appreciative to Dare Records for believing in us and pushing this record!”\n\nThe world’s newest, all-black female band, LA’DY is composed of five musical powerhouses. Social media brought the ladies together, through each of their pure musical talents and sonic attraction to each other. The band was officially formed in 2019 and joined by Kris Callazo on keys, Zuri Appleby on bass, Michel’Le Baptiste on drums, and Ari O’Neal on guitar. As seasoned musicians who worked together previously with many of the industry’s top artists, the ladies felt inspired to bring their artistry to the forefront. LA’DY’s debut EP is forthcoming with the sultry track “Love Me Down” as the lead single. Lady’s talent is not only on stage, but they excel in the studio as composers and songwriters as well.\n\nEach member of LA’DY, hailing from each end of the US, has a long history of music from childhood. They grew up singing and playing in their respective hometown church choirs and bands. Their combined experience includes working with top music artists such as Kanye West, Lizzo, Nick Jonas, Beyonce, Jay-Z, and SZA. Their classic R&B sound is infused with refreshing upbeat tempos and instrumentation that has no comparison to any bands from the past or present. LA’DY represents the union and unconditional collaboration of women. As they hold their instruments (together), they are ignited to empower generations of girls who never see women of color rock out.\n\nFor more information on LA’DY and DARE Records, use the social media handle @DareRecordsLabel.\n\nFollow LA’DY on Socials:\n\nInstagram: @Ladyforreal\n\nYouTube: LA’DY\n\nFacebook: @TheLadyForReal\n\nTikTok: @TheLadyForReal\n\nTwitter: @TheLadyForReal\n\nTweet\n\nAbout the Author\n\nrichvongod"
