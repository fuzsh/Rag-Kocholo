        "text": "The concept of P.L.U.R., otherwise known as “Peace, Love, Unity, and Respect”, is one of the core foundations that Electronic Dance Music was built upon. What isn’t as widely known is that EDM was spear-headed by LGBTQ+ folks who helped to bring it to mainstream popularity and widespread acceptance. Electronic music was created as an inclusive and non-judgmental music space that everyone can enjoy, regardless of their sexual or gender identity. In celebration of Pride Month, we are thrilled to bring you our top 10 picks for LGBTQ+ artists in EDM that you should be listening to.\n\n1. Worthy\n\nKnown for her funky, bass-driven house music, Worthy, who is one of the four original co-founders and artists to release music on the iconic Dirtybird Records, has caught the eye of some of the biggest players in dance music, including Carl Cox, Diplo, Richie Hawtin, and more. In December 2020, Worthy, who now goes by the name Kristy, announced in a Facebook post that she was transgender and identifies as non-binary.\n\nSpotify / SoundCloud / Facebook / Twitter / Instagram\n\n2. Rezz\n\nIsabelle Rezazadeh, aka Rezz, is a Canadian DJ and music producer who is known for her heavy, sinister basslines and dark, hypnotizing lyrics, which are only emphasized by the LED goggles that she wears during every performance.
