        "text": "Results and discussion\n\nWhen cinema first came into being, it had its own characteristics, which are often unknown to the modern viewer and are therefore presented in a very brief overview: The first films were attractions shown at fairgrounds and mostly short films of a few minutes in duration. The plots were rarely constructed as more than a stunning or amusing snapshot, but soon the initial amazement at the technical wonders of moving pictures faded. Consequently, the plots became more complex, and the running time expanded. This process evolved over at least two decades, until the feature-length film overtook the short films as the standard we all know today. Films from this period, however, are in a desolate state of preservation (this circumstance explains why only films from industrialized countries like USA, Germany and France are preserved and represented in this paper) and most of them are considered lost–like the first surgery film in cinema history: Chirurgien américain (France 1897, Georges Méliès) [14]. Méliès was one of the first influential filmmakers to emerge from the early stages of cinema and is still known for classics like Le Voyage dans la Lune (France, 1902). Chirurgien américain utilizes the special effects–typical of Méliès style–to visualize a transplant of both legs to a tramp. In the following, the patient must be satisfied with more procedures, because aesthetic results do not appeal to him. Accordingly, the first representation of plastic surgery can be found as well, when the patient’s head is miraculously replaced by a more attractive one [15]. The first female director of \"surgical films\", Alice Guy, created a similar work with Surgery fin de siècle (France 1900). Today, Alice Guy is considered the first significant female filmmaker in cinema history with a career spanning several decades [16]. Her Surgery fin de siècle–fortunately, preserved–shows an operating room where a patient’s limbs are amputated and resewn. One can already anticipate the feelings the film is going to evoke as, apart from the marvelous special effects, the \"Please do not cry\" messages adorning the theatre walls–an ironic jab that accentuates the severe pain related to surgical procedures, stares down at the viewer. Considering that anesthesia was already established at that time, this reference can be considered misinformation [17].\n\nFilm example 1: Une indigestion (France 1902, Georges Méliès) takes us back to the special effects films of the Houdini admirer Méliès. Cinematically, the director presents more along the lines of the works already mentioned, the immediate operation: A patient with severe abdominal pain comes to a doctor’s office, where the resourceful surgeon immediately reaches for the scalpel. Following this familiar pattern, the limbs are removed, and the surgeon opens the abdominal cavity and removes the most unexpected equipment such as forks and lamps. As these procedures failed to provide any proper pain relief, the Medicus cuts off the patient’s head, fills his torso with the assistance of a futuristic water pump and miraculously reassembles the patient. The absurd operation is a success, and the client willingly pays the doctor’s fee [18]. Méliès seems to have been inspired by an 1892 theatrical performance that lured audiences to the box office with optical illusions called \"Le Charlatan Fin de Siècle\" [19] The popularity of grotesque-utopian operations was therefore not solely due to novel cinematic trick effects. This is further illustrated by headlines from the German press of the time, which wrote skeptically about the hemicraniectomies performed by the French brain surgeon Eugène-Louis Doyen: The surgical instruments would look like a \"…pincher, a \"mortise and tenon machine\" and a pipe saw\" [20]. The first representations of surgery in film were thus more than mere displays of trick effects; the motion pictures reflected the circumstances and prejudices of the time with which surgeons had to cope.\n\nThe short film was not completely replaced by the feature-length film; for a long time, short animated, slapstick, or experimental films were shown as openers to feature-length films, where the surgical theme reappeared. Examples would be the animated I’m Insured (USA 1916, Harry Palmer), in which a man tries to provoke an accident in order to get insurance money. But he is quickly confronted with the reality of being a traumatized surgery patient. In No Noise (USA 1923, Robert F. McGowanin), the \"Little Rascals\" turn a surgical ward into mayhem after one of them had his tonsils removed. They try to stay mainly because they get plenty of ice cream after the procedure. Following this, the gang wreaks havoc on X-ray machines, and exhibition skeletons and is having questionable fun with laughing gas, until they find themselves with disturbing complications (erysipelas, amputated toes, etc.). Medically enlightened, they flee in agony. Also worth mentioning is the frequently used cliché of the \"blood-splattered surgeon\", which was promptly used to induce moments of sheer horror. A well-known example would be the butcher-like surgeon in Good Night, Nurse (USA 1918, Roscoe Arbuckle), portrayed by the famous slapstick-comedian Buster Keaton."
