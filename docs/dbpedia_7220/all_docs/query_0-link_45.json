        "text": "Plot\n\nAs described in a film magazine,[4] Rosalie Beckwith (Minter) is an editor of a column devoted to affairs of the heart in a New York City newspaper. When the City Editor (Mathis) contemplates dropping the column since there is no such thing as romance, Rosalie wagers a month's salary that she can find romance within forty miles of the newspaper's office. Arriving at a small town selected at random, she is mistaken for Muriel Murat Bey, the cousin of a recently returned millionaire war hero, and decides to play along and enters his home as that person. Here a scheming Dr. Thomas Fitch (Beery), who has embezzled the millionaire's funds, seeks to bring about his death through poison. Numerous complications follow, terminating with the doctor's attempt to murder Rosalie and introduce his accomplice Grace Fitch (Phillips) as the real Muriel Murat Bey so that she could cover the doctor's theft by claiming that she received the missing money. The war hero comes to the rescue and she wins the wager when he falls in love with her."
