Shelby himself wanted that Juliet and her older sister Margaret also became stage actresses. One night when there was no babysitter available  Juliet accompanied her sister to an audition, was discovered and got her first stage role. In order to avoid the Child Labor Act, she used her cousin's passport and took the name &quot;Mary Miles Minter&quot;.

With her innocent appearance, Soon after, she started to work for Metro Pictures, while in 1916 she moved on to Mutual Pictures - always playing the leads, despite her young age. In 1917 she moved to the American Film Company, where Henry King often directed here, and in 1918 she traded American for Paramount.

The film became a huge success, as a result of which Taylor started to promote the actress so that she would grow into a legendary star. Eventually, she got into a relationship with the 30-year-old man.

The perpetrator could not be found and her mother Charlotte Shelby was long known as a suspect. In 1937, when the case was still unresolved, Minter demanded that she be given a prison sentence or that the case would be left alone.
