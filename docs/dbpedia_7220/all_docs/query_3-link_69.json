        "text": "For some, the nuts and bolts of modern media productions might be less interesting than the stories being told. But if you’ve always wanted to know just how a TV show is developed, a webisode is made, or the effects of a movie come together to dazzle audiences, consider a media arts production degree from Ohio University!\n\nIn this Bachelor of Science program, you’ll progress through a comprehensive combination of coursework and engaging practical experiences in video and audio production, media writing, editing and so much more. By the end, you’ll have what it takes to succeed as a multimedia creative or media production specialist, either as part of a company or on your own as a freelancer. Read on to learn:\n\nPost-Grad Opportunities for Media Arts Production Majors\n\nMany of Ohio University’s media arts production majors have gone on to work for top-rated and profitable companies, such as Disney, Lucasfilm, Animal Planet and more. Previous alums, in fact, have worked on some of the most successful movies and television shows of the last decade: \"Big Brother,\" \"The Force Awakens\" and \"You\" are just a few examples!\n\nIf you're ready to add to your expertise and experience after spending time working in the industry, our unique, three-year Master of Fine Arts in Communication Media Arts degree is the perfect opportunity. This terminal degree is a partnership between the Schools of Emerging Communication Technologies, Media Arts & Studies and Visual Communication, and it integrates advanced production skills and contextual knowledge with state-of-the-art facilities.\n\nExperience Behind-the-Scenes Tours and Workshops at Walt Disney World\n\nMany of our media arts production majors enjoy a “working vacation” when they get to visit Walt Disney World as part of our Storytelling, Technology, and Digital Media in Theme Parks program! Rather than jump onto rides, you’ll attend workshops and get behind-the-scenes tours to see how the classic Disney magic really works (plus learn how to make your own magic in your career).\n\nWhy Choose a Media Arts Production Degree?\n\nToday’s most powerful stories are cinematically rich experiences that combine careful craft, auditory enhancements and emotional resonance. Our media arts production majors remember the first time they watched or heard their favorite stories or songs, and they’re inspired to create the same kinds of experiences for others in the world.\n\nThe media arts bachelor’s degree empowers you to master multimedia and digital storytelling experiences. The program helps you create new, powerful stories for others to enjoy. It also gives you the behind-the-scenes, insider look at media production you might have always wondered about.\n\nWhether you’re interested in the nuts and bolts of media production and the business side of things, or you’re looking to fully realize your creative potential, the media arts production program gives you the tools, academic knowledge and personal experience needed to achieve your dreams.\n\nStudent Support Resources for Media Arts Production Majors\n\nThe faculty members of OHIO’s media arts bachelor’s degree are involved from the start of your education. Whether you’re new to college or have switched majors after tackling your first couple of years, you’ll find that your teachers offer one-on-one mentorship opportunities, personalized guidance and internship support from day one.\n\nYour professors and success advisors are committed to providing you with an engaging learning experience. Student organizations further enable you to network and socialize on campus, leading to new ways to become a part of our welcoming community and participate in exciting media projects with your fellow majors.\n\nDon’t forget OHIO’s many scholarships for those in need of financial assistance! Ohio University is here to support your educational journey in whatever form it may take.\n\nHarris Student Support Center\n\nThe OHIO Experience for Media Arts Production Majors\n\nOHIO media arts production majors start creating and participating in the producing and marketing media projects in their freshman years. As opposed to other colleges, Ohio University doesn’t make you wait until your junior or senior year to start gaining practical and highly applicable experience for your future career.\n\nFor example, many media arts production majors work on projects at the Bob Lyon Studio, which was recently updated with new equipment. Our podcasting studio and other equipment rooms also give you the precise tools you need to realize the creative vision in your head.\n\nUltimately, the media arts production program is all about experience combined with classroom learning."
