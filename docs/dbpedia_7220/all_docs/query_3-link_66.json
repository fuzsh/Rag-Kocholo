        "text": "Heart failure can affect the right side of the heart, the left side of the heart, or both sides.\n\nWhen the right side of the heart begins to function less efficiently, it is unable to pump much blood forward into the vessels of the lungs. Because of the congestion in the right side of the heart, blood flow begins to back up into the veins. Eventually, swelling is noticed in the feet, ankles, lower legs, eyelids, and abdomen due to fluid retention.\n\nWhen the left side of the heart fails, it is unable to pump blood forward out to the body efficiently. Blood begins to back up into the vessels in the lungs, and the lungs become stressed. Breathing becomes faster and more difficult. Also, the body does not receive enough blood to meet its needs, resulting in fatigue and poor growth in children.\n\nThe following are the most common symptoms of heart failure. However, each child may experience symptoms differently. Symptoms may include:\n\nVisible swelling of the legs, ankles, eyelids, face, and (occasionally) abdomen\n\nAbnormally fast breathing\n\nShortness of breath or labored breathing\n\nFatigue\n\nNausea\n\nFalling asleep when feeding or becoming too tired to eat\n\nLack of appetite\n\nWeight gain over a short period of time, even when the appetite is poor, typically due to fluid retention\n\nCough and congestion in the lungs\n\nSweating while feeding, playing, or exercising\n\nBreathing difficulty with activity, especially while feeding, walking, or climbing stairs\n\nLoss of muscle mass\n\nFailure to gain weight\n\nChange in skin temperature and color (tendency to become cold and clammy, or sweaty, flushed, and warm)\n\nThe severity of the condition and symptoms depends on how much of the heart's pumping capacity has been affected.\n\nThe symptoms of heart failure may resemble other conditions or medical problems. Always consult your child's healthcare provider for a diagnosis."
