        "text": "Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) uses a powerful magnetic field, radio waves and a computer to produce detailed pictures of the structures within and around the heart. Doctors use cardiac MRI to detect or monitor cardiac disease. They also use it to evaluate the heart's anatomy and function in patients with both heart disease present at birth and heart diseases that develop after birth. Cardiac MRI does not use radiation, and it may provide the best images of the heart for certain conditions.\n\nTell your doctor about any health problems, recent surgeries, or allergies, and whether you are pregnant. The magnetic field is not harmful, but it may cause some medical devices to malfunction. Most orthopedic implants pose no risk, but you should always tell the MRI technologist if you have any devices or metal in your body. Guidelines about eating and drinking before your exam vary between facilities. Unless you are told otherwise, take your regular medications as usual. Leave all jewelry at home and wear loose, comfortable clothing. You may need to change into a gown for the procedure. If you have claustrophobia or anxiety, ask your doctor for a mild sedative prior to the exam.\n\nWhat is Cardiac MRI?\n\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a noninvasive test doctors use to diagnose medical conditions.\n\nMRI uses a powerful magnetic field, radiofrequency pulses, and a computer to produce detailed pictures of internal body structures. MRI does not use radiation (x-rays).\n\nDetailed MR images allow doctors to examine the body and detect disease.\n\ntop of page\n\ntop of page\n\ntop of page\n\ntop of page\n\nHow does the procedure work?\n\nUnlike x-ray and computed tomography (CT) exams, MRI does not use radiation. Instead, radio waves re-align hydrogen atoms that naturally exist within the body. This does not cause any chemical changes in the tissues. As the hydrogen atoms return to their usual alignment, they emit different amounts of energy depending on the type of tissue they are in. The scanner captures this energy and creates a picture using this information.\n\nIn most MRI units, the magnetic field is produced by passing an electric current through wire coils. Other coils are inside the machine and, in some cases, are placed around the part of the body being imaged. These coils send and receive radio waves, producing signals that are detected by the machine. The electric current does not come into contact with the patient.\n\nA computer processes the signals and creates a series of images, each of which shows a thin slice of the body. The radiologist can study these images from different angles.\n\nMRI is often able to tell the difference between diseased tissue and normal tissue better than x-ray, CT, and ultrasound.\n\ntop of page\n\ntop of page\n\ntop of page\n\nWho interprets the results and how do I get them?\n\nA radiologist, a doctor trained to supervise and interpret radiology exams, will analyze the images. The radiologist will send a signed report to your primary care or referring physician, who will share the results with you.\n\nYou may need a follow-up exam. If so, your doctor will explain why. Sometimes a follow-up exam further evaluates a potential issue with more views or a special imaging technique. It may also see if there has been any change in an issue over time. Follow-up exams are often the best way to see if treatment is working or if a problem needs attention.\n\ntop of page\n\ntop of page\n\nWhat are the limitations of a Cardiac MRI?\n\nHigh-quality images depend on your ability to remain perfectly still and follow breath-holding instructions while the images are being recorded. If you are anxious, confused or in severe pain, you may find it difficult to lie still during imaging.\n\nA person who is very large may not fit into certain types of MRI machines. There are weight limits on the scanners.\n\nImplants and other metallic objects can make it difficult to obtain clear images. Patient movement can have the same effect.\n\nA very irregular heartbeat may affect the quality of images. This is because some techniques time the imaging based on the electrical activity of the heart.\n\nThe constant motion of the heart creates challenges in obtaining clear images. These challenges can be overcome by various techniques including synchronizing the imaging with ECG tracing, synchronizing the imaging with breathing, or having you perform repeated short breath holds during imaging.\n\nAn irregular heartbeat or atrial fibrillation (which makes cardiac motion and heart rate unpredictable) may cause difficulties in acquiring cardiac MR images.\n\nMRI is generally not recommended for seriously injured patients. However, this decision is based on clinical judgment. This is because traction devices and life support equipment may distort the MR images. As a result, they must be kept away from the area to be imaged. Some trauma patients, however, may need MRI.\n\nPresent data show no convincing evidence that non contrast MRI harms the fetus of a pregnant woman. However, if the need for the exam is not time sensitive your doctor may delay the exam until after delivery. MRI gadolinium contrast agents are generally avoided during pregnancy except in very specific circumstances. Your doctor will discuss the benefits and risks of any MRI procedure with you. Doctors may perform MRI after the first trimester to assess the fetus for findings that are not fully evaluated by ultrasound.\n\nAcquiring detailed images of the coronary arteries and their branches is more difficult with MRI than with other imaging exams. Therefore, coronary artery imaging is most often done with cardiac CT or a more invasive procedure using a catheter placed into the blood vessels via the groin or arm.\n\nAn MRI exam typically costs more and may take more time than other imaging exams. Talk to your insurance provider if you have concerns about the cost of MRI.\n\ntop of page"
