        "text": "What is a transesophageal echocardiogram?\n\nA transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) is a test that uses sound waves to create pictures of your heart. A TEE is different than other forms of echocardiogram or ultrasounds because it takes pictures from within your body, rather than outside of it.\n\nYour provider uses a long, thin tube called an endoscope to carefully guide a small transducer down your throat and esophagus (food tube). The transducer is a device that makes sound waves. These sound waves bounce off the different areas of your heart, making echoes. The transducer then sends these echoes to a computer that makes them into pictures. These pictures show the structure and function of your heart in great detail.\n\nYour provider may combine TEE with Doppler ultrasound and color Doppler methods. These specialized techniques show the speed and direction of blood flow through your heart.\n\nWhat does a transesophageal echocardiogram show?\n\nA transesophageal echocardiogram shows a detailed view of your heart’s structure and function. It can help diagnose and manage many different conditions, including:\n\nAortic aneurysm, which is a bulge in your largest blood vessel.\n\nBlood clots in your heart. People with atrial fibrillation face a higher risk of clots in their atria (upper heart chambers).\n\nCardiac tumors, which may be cancerous or noncancerous.\n\nCongenital heart disease, which includes a range of heart problems that you’re born with.\n\nHeart valve disease, including mitral valve disease. Your valves may be narrowed (stenosis) or leaky (regurgitation). TEE can also spot problems with prosthetic valves, such as growths or infections.\n\nInfective endocarditis and other infections in your heart tissue or valves.\n\nPericardial disease, which affects the sac that covers your heart.\n\nWhy is a transesophageal echocardiogram performed?\n\nA transesophageal echocardiogram may be performed for many reasons. These include:\n\nYou had an echocardiogram on the outside of your chest (a transthoracic echocardiogram or TTE), but your provider needs a better or more detailed visualization of your heart. In this case, a TEE is a follow-up to the TTE that helps diagnose or manage a heart problem.\n\nYou have a life-threatening problem that your provider needs to see up-close, right away. TEE can be useful in emergency and critical care.\n\nYour provider needs to check for blood clots before you have a medical procedure such as cardioversion.\n\nYou’re having a surgery or procedure. TEE helps providers confirm your surgery was successful. TEE also provides real-time imaging during some catheter-based procedures.\n\nDiagnosing or managing a heart problem\n\nYour provider may need more information than what a TTE, performed outside your body, can provide. So, they may run a TEE to examine your heart without your ribs or lungs getting in the way.\n\nImagine standing on a sidewalk, looking through a storefront window. Inside the store, near the back, you see a glass display case. You can tell the display case contains plates with flower patterns. But you can’t make out the details since people are standing around the case. So, you go inside and walk to the back of the store to get a better look.\n\nA transthoracic echo gives your provider a storefront window view, which is still very helpful. But a transesophageal echo lets your provider see directly inside the display case. It’s the difference between seeing the plate has flowers and learning the flowers are roses.\n\nSince your esophagus runs behind your heart, it’s the perfect spot for the transducer to send and receive sound waves. A TEE is especially valuable for examining structures in the back of your heart. These include your:\n\nLeft atrium: The top left chamber of your heart.\n\nLeft atrial appendage (LAA): The small, ear-shaped sac in your left atrium where blood clots sometimes form.\n\nInteratrial septum: The wall that separates your left atrium and right atrium.\n\nThoracic aorta: The part of your aorta that passes through your chest.\n\nSometimes, providers skip the TTE and use TEE first. This may be the case if you have:\n\nChest anatomy that makes a transthoracic echo difficult.\n\nLung disorders.\n\nSupporting emergency and critical care\n\nTEE can help investigate life-threatening medical conditions. In some critical situations, providers use TEE without using TTE first. This may happen if you have one of the following conditions without a clear cause:\n\nHemodynamic instability (problems with blood pressure and blood flow).\n\nHypotension (low blood pressure).\n\nHypoxia (low oxygen).\n\nTEE may also be used initially, without a prior TTE, to investigate:\n\nAortic dissection or other sudden problems with your aorta that may require urgent investigation.\n\nHeart attack.\n\nProsthetic valve problems (like a blood clot or infection).\n\nTrauma to your chest.\n\nChecking for blood clots before a procedure\n\nProviders use TEE to check for blood clots before certain procedures that treat arrhythmias. These include:\n\nCatheter ablation.\n\nElectrical cardioversion.\n\nThese procedures may cause a blood clot to break free and travel through your bloodstream (thromboembolism). Your provider will let you know if you need TEE to check for clots before your procedure.\n\nHelping with surgeries and procedures\n\nTEE is a valuable tool during certain surgeries and procedures. Your provider may use TEE before your surgery to check your anatomy. They may also use TEE afterward to confirm the surgery’s success. TEE may be used for:\n\nSurgery for congenital heart disease.\n\nValve repair.\n\nValve replacement.\n\nProviders also use TEE to see inside your body and guide procedures in real time. TEE may be used during percutaneous procedures including:\n\nTranscatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR).\n\nTranscatheter mitral valve repair.\n\nTranscatheter tricuspid valve repair.\n\nTranscatheter left atrial appendage.\n\nIs TEE an invasive procedure?\n\nA TEE is an invasive procedure because your provider needs to put a device inside your body. You may experience mild discomfort. But the risk of serious problems is low.\n\nDoes TEE require anesthesia?\n\nUsually, a TEE requires only local anesthesia and moderate sedation. That means your provider will spray the back of your throat with pain-relieving medication. They’ll also give you medicine through an IV to help you relax.\n\nMost people don’t need general anesthesia (deep sleep). Talk with your provider about what’s best for you during your TEE.\n\nAre you awake during a transesophageal echocardiogram?\n\nModerate sedation should make you drowsy and allow you to tolerate the procedure without significant discomfort. The staff will be constantly monitoring for signs of discomfort and can decide if you need more sedation. . If you need general anesthesia, you’ll be fully asleep and you won’t remember the procedure. With general anesthesia, you will need to be placed on a breathing machine. Because you are deeply sedated, the recovery will be longer compared to moderate sedation.\n\nHow long does a transesophageal echocardiogram take?\n\nA TEE examination may take up to 90 minutes. The picture-taking part usually only takes 15 minutes."
