        "text": "What is heart valve disease?\n\nHeart valve disease refers to any of several conditions that prevent one or more of the valves in your heart from working right. Left untreated, heart valve disease can cause your heart to work harder. This can reduce your quality of life and even become life-threatening. In many cases, your healthcare provider can do surgery or a minimally invasive procedure to repair or replace your heart valves, restoring normal function and allowing you to return to normal activities.\n\nThe four valves in your heart make sure blood flows in only one direction through your heart. Your heart’s valves are:\n\nMitral (between your left atrium and left ventricle).\n\nTricuspid (between your right atrium and right ventricle).\n\nAortic (between your left ventricle and aorta).\n\nPulmonary (between your right ventricle and pulmonary artery).\n\nOxygen-poor blood comes back from your body to your heart’s right atrium, then goes through your tricuspid valve and into your right ventricle. From there, it goes through your pulmonary valve and pulmonary artery to get oxygen from your lungs.\n\nBlood with oxygen returns through your pulmonary veins to your heart’s left atrium. Your mitral valve lets the blood travel from the left atrium to your left ventricle. From there, oxygen-rich blood goes through your aortic valve and out through your aorta to the rest of your body.\n\nYour valves consist of small flaps of tissue (called leaflets) that open to allow blood to move forward through your heart during half of your heartbeat. These leaflets close to prevent blood from flowing backward during the other half of your heartbeat. Your mitral valve has two leaflets, but the others have three leaflets.\n\nThe leaflets in two of your valves (the mitral and tricuspid) also have tough, fibrous strands of tissue called chordae tendineae that connect the valve leaflets to the papillary muscles inside the walls of your ventricles. The chordae tendineae and papillary muscles keep the leaflets stable against any backward flow of blood.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center.

Policy\n\nWhat are the types of heart valve disease?\n\nThere are different types of heart valve disease, and it is possible for more than one valve to be affected.\n\nValvular stenosis\n\nWith valvular stenosis, the tissues forming the valve leaflets become stiffer, narrowing the valve opening and reducing the amount of blood that can flow through it. Mild narrowing may not reduce the overall functioning of your heart. However, the valve can become so narrow (stenotic) that it reduces your heart’s function, makes your heart pump harder and puts it under strain. As a result, the rest of your body may not get enough blood flow.\n\nValvular insufficiency\n\nValvular insufficiency (or regurgitation, incompetence, \"leaky valve\"), happens when the leaflets don’t close completely, letting blood leak backward across the valve. This backward flow is referred to as “regurgitant flow.” Your heart has to pump harder to make up for this backward flow, and the rest of your body may get less blood flow.\n\nYou can get a backward flow if you have mitral valve prolapse, a common problem in which the valve flaps go back into your left atrium when your heart beats.\n\nValvular atresia\n\nValvular atresia happens when a heart valve doesn’t form correctly before birth. This is usually diagnosed very early in infancy.\n\nHow common is heart valve disease?\n\nAbout 2.5% of Americans — many of them older adults — have heart valve disease. Each year, roughly 28,000 people die from heart valve disease in the United States. Mitral valve prolapse is a common heart valve problem.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow does heart valve disease affect my body?\n\nWhen a heart valve isn’t working right, it puts a strain on your heart because it makes it work harder. Also, it can cause less blood flow to your body.\n\nHow is heart valve disease treated?\n\nA heart valve problem can be serious if it’s not treated. Although you can’t undo damage to a heart valve, you can treat the issue.\n\nHeart valve disease treatments depend on the underlying cause and may include:\n\nProtecting your valve from further damage.\n\nTaking medications.\n\nHaving surgery or invasive procedures if necessary.\n\nSeeing your heart doctor for regular visits.\n\nThe decision to prescribe medical treatment, surgical repair or surgical replacement depends on several factors, including:\n\nThe type of valve disease.\n\nThe severity of the damage.\n\nYour age.\n\nYour medical history.\n\nIf you’re pregnant and have heart valve disease, you can get extra rest and/or take certain medicines that are safe for your baby.\n\nIf you know about your valve disease before pregnancy, you should ask your healthcare provider if any tests or visits with a cardiologist are recommended before trying to become pregnant. This can help ensure that you are treated appropriately before and during pregnancy. If you have a severe valve problem, your doctor may recommend valve repair or replacement before pregnancy.\n\nSurgical repair or replacement\n\nHeart valve disease is a mechanical problem in the opening or closing of the leaflets, and you may eventually need surgery to repair or replace your valve. Some infants and children who are born with a valve problem need surgery during childhood.\n\nUsually, the surgeon and cardiologist will know which treatment will be best before surgery day. Other times, the surgeon makes the decision during surgery, when they can see your valve.\n\nOften, valve surgery may be combined with other procedures (such as more than one valve procedure, bypass surgery or surgery to treat atrial fibrillation) to fully treat your heart disease.\n\nHeart valve repair allows your surgeon to fix your faulty valve, often without the use of artificial parts. In some cases, such as a narrow mitral valve, your provider may use a balloon on a catheter to widen your valve.\n\nThe advantages of valve repair are:\n\nLower risk of infection.\n\nDecreased need for lifelong blood thinner medication.\n\nPreserved heart muscle strength and function.\n\nSurgeons have to replace valves they can’t repair. Replacing your heart valve involves removing your old valve and sewing a new valve to the ring-shaped part of your old valve. The new valve could be a mechanical or biological (made with tissue from a human, cow or pig) valve. These replacement valves can provide adequate function when repair can’t. However, depending on the type of valve your provider uses, you may have to take certain medications to prevent blood clots or get a new valve again in 10 or 15 years.\n\nDepending on the type of valve problem and your other medical conditions, you may be a candidate for minimally invasive valve repair or replacement. Ask your cardiologist if a minimally invasive procedure may be right for you.\n\nWhat medications are used?\n\nAlthough medicines can’t cure heart valve disease, they — and a healthier lifestyle — can help with symptoms and decrease your chance of having a stroke or sudden cardiac arrest. You may be able to stop taking some medications after valve surgery, but you may need to take other medicines for the rest of your life.\n\nYour healthcare provider may prescribe medications to help you with:\n\nPreventing arrhythmias or blood clots.\n\nBringing down your blood pressure or cholesterol levels.\n\nTreating heart failure or coronary artery disease.\n\nYour provider will review your medication information with you before you leave the hospital. It’s important to know:\n\nThe names of your medications.\n\nTheir purpose.\n\nHow often and at what times to take them.\n\nComplications/side effects of the treatment\n\nOlder people and those whose health is not good to begin with have a higher risk of complications from valve replacement surgery.\n\nComplications, which are rarely fatal, may include:\n\nInfection.\n\nAtrial fibrillation or another type of abnormal heart rhythm.\n\nBleeding.\n\nBlood clots.\n\nKidney failure.\n\nStroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA).\n\nHow long does it take to recover from heart valve surgery?\n\nYou may be in the hospital for about five to seven days after heart surgery. After that, it can take approximately four to eight weeks to recover. Your provider may recommend cardiac rehabilitation, a carefully monitored exercise program to assist with your recovery."
