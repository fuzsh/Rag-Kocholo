        "text": "The most important female director the American film industry ever knew and one of the most important and prolific film directors in the silent film era. Florence Lois Weber was a genuine filmmaker, involved in all aspects of production and a person who utilised the motion picture to put across her own ideas and philosophies. Lois brought to the screen her concerns for humanity and social justice across 400 films, of which only 20 survive. She was a true pioneer who regularly courted controversy: in 1915, she produced ‘Hypocrites’, featuring cinema’s first full-frontal female nude scene, whilst in 1916, she produced ‘Where Are My Children?’, featuring discussions on abortion and birth control. Lois was many things, but above all else, she was the trailblazing director who shocked the world…\n\nThe Child Prodigy\n\nLois was born on June 13th, 1879 in Allegheny City, Pennsylvania, the second of three children of Mary and George. Lois was considered a child prodigy and an excellent pianist. As a child, music was everything to her, her most treasured possession a baby grand piano. As a child, she left home for two years to live in poverty whilst working as a street corner evangelist and social activist with the Church Army Workers, an organisation similar to the Salvation Army. She would preach and sing hymns on street corners in the red light districts of Pittsburgh, all until the Church Army Workers disbanded in 1900.\n\nBy then, she was a music student, performing as a soprano singer and pianist, touring America as a concert pianist. But after a piano key broke during a recital, Lois retired from the concert stage, too nervous to play in public again. Following the advice of one of her uncles, in 1904, Lois decided to take up acting and moved to New York City.\n\nAs I was convinced the theatrical profession needed a missionary, he suggested that the best way to reach them was to become one of them so I went on the stage filled with a great desire to convert my fellow man.\n\n– Lois.\n\nFor five years, Lois worked as a repertory and stock actress, receiving promising reviews for her performances. One of her acting troupes was lead by Wendell Phillips Smalley. After a brief acquaintance, shortly before Lois’s 25th birthday, she married Wendell. She had begun her career on the stage alongside her husband and they began working in motion pictures around 1907, often billed together as, ‘The Smalleys’.\n\nAnd they were inseparable…\n\nA Highbrow Life\n\nTogether, The Smalleys acted alongside one another onscreen and codirected scripts written by Lois. They soon earned a reputation for highbrow, quality pictures. Lois had knack for writing. She was a fanatical realist, her movies filled with details, her extravagant visions ranging from the psychological to the metaphysical. She was a master of her craft. Her very first pictures, in 1908, were talkies, in which the images were synchronised to records that played along with them. It spoke of her artistic inventiveness. She was at the forefront of motion picture technology.\n\nFor the next five years, The Smalleys pursued a career in those, the early days of the motion picture industry. Lois typically received sole writing credit. She wrote scenarios and subtitles, acted, directed, designed sets and costumes, edited films and even developed the negatives. As early as 1912, enthused by the rapid progression of technological advancements in the motion picture industry, Lois predicted the medium would soon become a part of the elite high arts.\n\nHer idea of a motion picture was imaginative and eclectic. She was devoted to cinema’s educational potential, believing that they would soon be shown in classrooms and places of worship. She also believed that slow-motion cameras could be used to advance the field of science, and she wasn’t wrong. She made these predictions as early as 1913.\n\nBy 1911, The Smalleys were working for William Swanson’s Rex Motion Picture Company in New York and it was here when Lois gained her reputation as a ‘serious social uplifter and as the leading partner in the Weber-Smalley unit’. It was in this year when she acted in and directed her first silent short film, ‘A Heroine of ‘76’. Rex was incorporated into Universal and The Smalleys were the first people to run the company, with Lois becoming Universal City’s first mayor. In fact, the entire staff of officials were all women, making it the first municipality in history to be entirely governed by female officials.\n\nBut it was not as mayor where Lois would make her name…\n\nSuspenseful\n\nOne of Lois’s earliest movies is ‘Suspense’ (1913), a masterpiece that critics agree still holds up, with comparisons to Hitchcock. Lois stars as ‘The Wife’, alone with her baby in a remote house when a man named ‘The Tramp’ tries to break in. With the imposter at the door, the wife phones her husband at the office. Lois splits the screen into three so we can see all the characters at once, Lois one of the early pioneers of split screen. The techniques Lois uses would become hallmarks of the greats of directing to come. Close-ups on the character’s eyes and the shot of a telephone wire being cut, for example, characteristics we now identify with the best suspenseful movies. All this started with Lois.\n\n‘Suspense’ survives in full on YouTube, one of the few surviving reminders of Lois Weber, pioneer of cinema. The movie demonstrated Lois’s masterful command of filmmaking and she followed it up with more hits, such as, ‘The Jew’s Christmas’ (1913), a three-reel silent movie that dramatizes the conflict between traditional Jewish values and American customs and values. It illustrated the challenges of cultural assimilation, especially the generational conflict over interfaith marriage. It is believed to be the earliest portrayal of a rabbi in an American film. Lois played his daughter. It was her effort to combat racial discrimination, using film to highlight social issues when so many other directors of the age simply wanted to entertain. The film was highly controversial when it was released, but it demonstrated perfectly why Lois is considered a trailblazer of cinema.\n\nLois loved to court controversy. Her 1915 movies, ‘Hypocrites’, is heavy-handed in its approach to social hypocrisy. But it is best remembered for the scene in which a woman appears full-frontal nude for the first time in cinema’s history. The figure is translucent, a double exposure, as she frolics across the screen. Lois loved to titillate but also preach. To this day, historians argue about whether the actress was wearing a bodystocking, but in any case, the American censorship boards lost it. The movie angered them greatly.\n\nLois denied the nudity was a publicity stunt. She said, “I hoped the picture would act as a moral force.” In one scene, the naked woman is at a political rally, holding a hand mirror and a title card that reads, ‘Truth holds her mirror up to politics.’ In 1914, Lois produced 27 films. By the end of 1915, she was one of the most notorious directors in the business.\n\nShe was one of the first directors to draw the ire of the censors.\n\nNo Censorship!\n\nIn 1914, Lois became the first American woman to direct a feature-length movie in America, with, ‘The Merchant of Venice’. It was in this year that Lois was convinced to move to the Bosworth Company, Universal, ironically, refusing to make feature-length films. Bosworth was managed by Julia Ivers, the first woman to manage a film studio. Lois signed a $50,000 a year contract, making her one of the best known, most respected and highest paid directors in Hollywood at the time. Each week, across America, six million people on average turned out to watch one of Lois’s movies. She was one of the most famous directors around.\n\nIn moving pictures I have found my life’s work. I find at once an outlet for my emotions and my ideals. I can preach to my heart’s content, and with the opportunity to write the play, act the leading role, and direct the entire production, if my message fails to reach someone, I can blame only myself.\n\n– Lois.\n\nThe Smalleys returned to Universal in 1915, their first film, ‘Scandal’, in which both of The Smalleys starred. It was a movie that featured the consequences of gossip mongering. By 1916, Lois was at the height of her fame. She produced in that year three of her most famous pictures. One, ‘Shoes’ (1916) tells the story of a shop girl named Eva, who helps to support her indignant parents and sisters. Her shoes are full of holes and falling apart. Yet she cannot afford new shoes on her small wage. She becomes so desperate she decides to sleep with a lecherous nightclub singer. To this day, the movie remains potent and powerfully heart-breaking. One scene features Eva gazing at herself in a mirror, all broken and cracked. The camera lingers. We feel her pain. She meets the man at the club. The camera fades to black. And the next morning, she has her new shoes. As long ago as 1916, Lois was one of the very few filmmakers making movies like this.\n\nLois made a series of high profile and often deeply controversial films on the social issues of her day, including capital punishment, drug abuse, poverty and wage equity, and contraception. But for the 10 feature-length movies she made for Universal in 1916, nine of which she wrote, she became Universal’s highest paid director, earning $5,000 a week. She enjoyed complete creative freedom. The head of Universal, Carl Laemmle, said:\n\nI would trust Miss Weber with any sum of money that she needed to make any picture that she wanted to make. I would be sure that she would bring it back.\n\nThe Master\n\nLois was at the height of her renown. In 1916, she was the first and only woman elected to the Motion Picture Directors Association, an honour she would retain for decades. One of her most famous pictures of the time was, ‘The Dumb Girl of Portici’. The movie features large action scenes, some of the first in cinematic history. The movie stars the great Russian ballerina Anna Pavlova, who plays a mute fisherwoman seduced by a nobleman. The movie features energetic crowd scenes, all exquisitely orchestrated. Rows and rows of soldiers on horses ride into the centre of town. A mass demonstration takes place outside the Viceroy’s palace. A riot even breaks out at one point as the soldiers attack the peasants. To achieve this then, in 1916, in the earliest days of cinema, was remarkable.\n\nSo successful was Lois that, in 1917, she founded her own film studio. She hardly ever filmed in it, though, preferring to shoot on location. She had grand ambitions for the future. In 1917, she spoke of colour movies and stereoscopic movies: 3D, the first 3D movie coming out in 1922. It was at this time she made one of her most controversial movies: ‘Where Are My Children?’ The movie dealt with birth control and abortion. At the time, both were illegal.\n\nThe story begins with a district attorney prosecuting a man who had been charged with promoting ‘indecent literature’: a pamphlet with information about contraception. It was Universal’s most popular hit of the year. The controversy surrounding the movie undoubtedly made it a box office hit, grossing in excess of $3 million. Across two weeks in Sydney, 100,000 people watched the movie, a time when the population of the city was barely more than that. Lois had brought the subject of birth control out of the shadows. Lois’s name was rocketed to the big time.\n\nLois tackled birth control again in, ‘The Hand That Rocks the Cradle’ (1917), starring The Smalleys. It was Lois’s last screen appearance. She plays a doctor’s wife arrested and imprisoned for illegally disseminating family planning information. The movie is now lost. Whilst controversy continued to plague her life, Mary had her studio.\n\nShe was committed to making pictures, come what may.\n\nThe Producer\n\nMary had leased a self-contained estate for her studio. She had offices, dressing rooms, scenic and property rooms, and a 12,000 square foot shooting stage all constructed. Yet there were signs of trouble in The Smalleys’ marriage. It was starting to deteriorate. Wendall was known as an ‘indolent womanizer’, chasing every woman on the lot, resulting in very public arguments and shouting matches with Lois. She started to find it difficult to pay the bills. By 1920, the world around her had changed.\n\nAudiences had lost their appetite for socially conscious films as the age of the talkies dawned. Movies were making big money and that turned Hollywood into what it is today. Lois soldiered on. By 1921, she was at the zenith of her career, fearless in the production of her pictures, her position intact as one of the best directors of the screen. But her moralising was starting to be viewed in a negative light. This was the era of the flapper, the confident New Woman not constrained by archaic values. Making movies tackling those issues made Lois seem almost passé. Modern audiences were growing increasingly bored of her output.\n\nSome considered her crusades unwarranted and unwanted, almost quaint. Her fall from favour was unquestionably worsened by her refusal to adapt or change. She also refused to feature big name stars in her features. After making 13 films, Lois Weber Productions collapsed and with it, Lois was forced to release all of her contracted staff. Her career as a giant of Hollywood was effectively over.\n\nEven then, it was in 1921 when Lois would produce one of her most successful films.\n\nThe Blot\n\nIn 1921, Lois produced her masterpiece and her best-known film today: The Blot. The movie depicted the rejection of the capitalist values of America by depicting the compromises and choices impoverished women are forced to make to attain social mobility and financial security. Lois linked consumerism with sexual exploitation. The movie exudes a certain quietness, the use of detail rich and rewarding. There is an emphasis on the natural. At the time, the movie was not a critical success and did little at the box office. The movie was lost until 1975, when it was restored.\n\nSoon after the movie premiered in New York City, Lois and Wendall set sail for Europe, trying to save their broken marriage. They travelled for six months, returning to America in 1922. Later that year, Lois obtained a divorce from Wendall, describing him as alcoholic and abusive. Her marriage was over. And her studio was gone. But she had maintained a career as a successful female director over a long period of 14 years. That was something no other female director could claim.\n\nHer output slowed down considerably after 1922. But she did write and direct five features over the next decade. The industry in which she made her name was in transition. Lois very much felt on her own. But she was still receiving acclaim. She was praised for her direction in, ‘A Chapter in Her Life’ (1923), in which a young girl whose love and faith transformed the troubled adults in her life. These storylines many felt were outdated. With the criticism, Lois left America to travel to Europe. She suffered a nervous collapse in 1923 and as a result, made no more movies until 1925. She effectively retired from public life.\n\nIt was in 1925 when she returned to Universal, hired by Carl Laemmle to take charge of all story developing for a $5 million production initiative based around the adaption of popular novels. She signed a new distribution deal with Universal in 1926, making her one of the highest paid women in the movie business. In 1927, she directed her final silent movie, ‘The Angel of Broadway’. However, the advent of sound and the demise of silent movies, coupled with negative reviews and poor box office receipts, marked the end of Lois’s comeback. Lois felt lost. She lamented the rapidly declining fortunes of female directors in Hollywood, saying:\n\nWomen entering the field now find it practically closed. Frequently a male writer is given a directorial chance on the supposition that he ought to know better than anyone else how his story should be presented on the screen. But you do not hear of a woman writer being so favoured.\n\nLois’s movie career was over. Or was it?\n\nThe Star that Never Fades\n\nLois was frustrated. But in 1932, thanks to the efforts of Frances Marion, Lois was hired by United Artists as a script doctor. And in 1933, Universal signed Lois to scout for new talent and to direct screen tests. But Lois still had it. She directed ‘White Heat’, a tale of racial prejudice on a Hawaiian sugar plantation, made on a low budget. It was the first film shot on the island of Kauai. When it was released in 1934, it was a commercial and critical success. It was her last film. Her only talkie. Shortly after it was released, she married again but he squandered all of Lois’s hard earned money… and then he left her. By the end of her life, Lois had little left. ‘White Heat’ is now a lost film.\n\nIn the November of 1939, Lois was admitted to Good Samaritan Hospital in a critical condition. She was suffering a stomach ailment that had afflicted her for years. She died two weeks later on Monday, November 13th, 1939 at the age of 60, destitute, from an ulcer. She was surrounded by friends and her younger sister. But her death was largely overlooked. Variety only mentioned Lois in two brief paragraphs. That was it. For all Lois had achieved, it seemed likely that she was destined to be forgotten.\n\nWith no money, Frances Marion paid for Lois’s funeral. 300 people attended. Lois Weber was cremated but to this day, the whereabouts of her remains are unknown. She wrote a memoir to be published after her death, but her sister could not find a publisher. The memoir was stolen in 1970 and it has never been recovered. It all felt very undignified. For all the success Lois enjoyed, her life did not end how it should have done, nor should she have been forgotten so easily.\n\nShe was the leading female director-screenwriter of early Hollywood. Her films addressed social issues and the ordeals endured by women. She was defined by controversy. The first full-frontal female nudity on camera. Issues of birth control and prostitution. In the silent era, her movies were shocking because of just how far ahead of their time they were. But the critics lapped her up. In 1916, she was the highest paid director on Earth. Man or woman. The money she received and the faith the studios had in her served as a testament to her remarkable skill. She should not have died alone and broke.\n\nMercifully, in the last 20 to 30 years, she has been rediscovered. Her films are now regularly played at festivals and special screenings across the world. Many of her films are available on DVD and streaming services. Whilst many of her 400 films have been lost, now they are, at the very least, getting the recognition they deserve. She truly was one of the most prominent and most successful female filmmakers of her age.\n\nLois Weber is now receiving her long-overdue recognition, no longer forgotten but celebrated as the trailblazer and astonishing filmmaker that she was.\n\nLois Weber had worked with her own [production] unit at Universal City and had rapidly achieved prominence as the top director on that enormous lot. Her films tackled such controversial issues as birth control, divorce and abortion, and while raising storms of controversy and censorship, pulled millions of dollars into Universal’s coffers… Weber controlled every aspect of production herself, even acting in them when the time allowed…\n\n– Richard Koszarski (film historian).\n\nToodle-Pip :}{:\n\nPost LB: Comments, Likes & Follows Greatly Appreciated :)\n\nImage (click on it to enlarge): 1) Lois Weber.
