        "text": "A Legacy from Newport’s Victorian Era\n\nby Mary Evans\n\nCopyright Newport Museum and Art Gallery, Percy Scannel's archive, Ref. 1906, 96.469.1. Postcard dated 1906.\n\nFor more postcards click here\n\nAccess to green spaces became a valued part of our lives during lockdown and public parks played a major role in many areas. As I have been walking through Belle Vue Park and Tredegar House Parkland over the past few months it has struck me how their reopening during lockdown was carrying on the tradition of the public park movement of the late 19th Century. Newport reopened its parks on the 18 May this year when initially visitors were limited to a 5 mile radius. The oldest of its parks, Belle Vue, is a legacy of the public park movement which was such a success in the later part of the 19th Century and depended on funding from town and city corporations across Britain.\n\nIn the early part of the Victorian era access to public open green spaces would have been a dream for the majority who lived and worked in the dire conditions of the rapidly growing industrialised towns. That is until the 1830s when out of concern for the moral and physical health of the population the public park movement began. Harriet Jordan in the Garden History Journal explains the theory behind the movement was that parks would make the working classes happier and therefore better citizens. This movement reached its peak between 1885 and 1914 when more public parks were built than at any other time before or since.[1]\n\nCopyright Mary Evans (M.E.)\n\nCopyright Christabel Hutchings\n\nNewport was no exception to the aspiration to provide a public park for its population. Belle Vue Park was opened in September 1894 at the cost of £19,500 on 23 acres of land presented in 1891 to Newport Corporation by Godfrey, 2nd Lord Tredegar (1831-1913). On his charger, Sir Briggs, he was one of Tennyson’s ‘six hundred’ who rode into ‘the valley of death’ and survived the ill-fated Charge of the Light Brigade in 1854. Known locally as Godfrey the Good, he believed that with great personal wealth came social obligation. He donated land for the establishment of the Athletic Ground, (named Rodney Parade after his elder brother Charles Rodney, heir apparent who died aged 25), the Free Library and the Technical Institute. He not only benefitted Newport but endowed Cardiff with many of its green spaces donating land for Cardiff Royal Infirmary, the University College and £3000 towards the building of the Welsh National Museum and Library. In 1909 he was presented with a portrait by the county of Monmouth and awarded the freedom of both Cardiff and Newport. A statue of him on his war horse Sir Briggs, by noted Welsh artist Goscombe John, still stands today in front of Cardiff City Hall.\n\nA competition for the design of Belle Vue Park was launched In1892 and 25 entries were received. Thomas Mawson (1861-1933), who would become a world renowned English landscape architect, won the first prize of £50. The design was Mawson's first win in an open competition and he would go on to have numerous commissions in Britain, Europe and Canada. One of his most prestigious is the Gardens of the Peace Palace in the Hague, home of the United Nations’ International Courts of Justice.We are fortunate to see his work nearer to home, Belle Vue Park is the only public park in Wales designed by Mawson. It now boasts a Blue Plaque to him and Lord Tredegar.\n\n(M.E.) Dyffryn Gardens, April 2019\n\nBelle Vue Park is not the only example of Mawson’s work on our doorstep. Mawson also designed and constructed Dyffryn Gardens in 1906 for its owner the coal magnate Reginald Cory. Dyffryn Gardens is considered to be the finest example of an Edwardian garden. As seen above the gardens feature a wealth of daffodils. In 2008 they received hundreds of specially bred bulbs donated by the Netherlands to commemorate the centenary of Mawson’s design of the Gardens of The Peace Palace in the Hague. The bulb was named the Peace Daffodil and will be blooming at Dyffryn next Spring. Mawson’s influence also inspired Lawrence Johnston who designed Hidcote, the world famous garden in the Cotswolds also owned by the National Trust and is famous for its series of outdoor rooms. Johnsons’s design was inspired by his visit to Dyffryn Gardens and his reading of The Art & Craft of Garden Making by Thomas H. Mawson.\n\nDuring the height of the Victorian public parks’ movement more attractions were provided such as music, sports facilities and horticultural display to encourage people to visit the parks. Gwent historian Dr Wendy Taylor notes that Mawson’s design for Belle Vue Park included tennis courts, beautiful walks, shrubbery and trees, a pavilion with terraces, ornamental lodges, and stone steps. She also explains how much work this construction provided for Newport’s unemployed who carried out the heavy manual labour. [2].\n\nThe minutes from Newport County Borough Council Parks Committee describe the pavilion, terraces and two conservatories as the dominating features of Mawson’s design. [3]He added two decorative lodges located at the Friars Road entrance and the other on Cardiff Road. No public park was complete without a bandstand and one was added in November 1894 at the cost of £238-16-10.\n\n(M.E.) The Bandstand, June 2020\n\nThe present day bandstand is a replica of the original, said to have been recreated from archive photographs. Bowling greens were opened in 1904, tennis courts were constructed in 1907 and a rustic tea house added in 1910 in response to increased demand for refreshments. The minutes also record that Mrs Bevan provided the refreshments in the pavilion at a yearly tenancy of £10 per annum and was allowed to extend her service to the tea house for the additional rent of £5. In 2000 the tea house was given listed grade II status.\n\n(M,E.) The Tea House, July 2020\n\nA hundred years after it opened Belle Vue Park was in urgent need of repair due to general deterioration and vandalism. The Belle Vue conservation area was designated on 12 January 1976. In 1996 CADW gave the pavilion, conservatories and terracing Grade II listed status and extended this to the gates, gate piers, lodges and tea house in 2000. In 2002 the Heritage Lottery Fund awarded £1.5 million towards the restoration of Belle Vue Park and the new facilities were formally opened on 8 September 2006.\n\n(M.E.) The Gorsedd Circle Belle Vue Park, 2019\n\nNewport is only a handful of towns and cities to have two Gorsedd circles. One circle was erected in Belle Vue Park ready for the Proclamation ceremony of 1896 and the Eisteddfod which took place the following year. This was the first time the Eisteddfod had taken place in Newport. The other circle was erected in Tredegar House parkland where the Eisteddfod was held in 1988 and 2004.\n\nSources\n\n1.
