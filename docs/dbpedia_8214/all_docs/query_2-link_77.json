        "text": "A new interactive map shows you the notable person born in your hometown – ranked based on details from their Wikipedia page.\n\nIt allows you to zoom in on anywhere in Wales – or indeed, the world – to discover who the most famous person from that area is.\n\nThe map was put together by Topi Tjukanov, a geographer and senior map designer at Mapbox.\n\nIt suggests that the most well-known people from Wales are currently the actors Christan Bale and Richard Burton, and ‘Lawrence of Aarbia’ T. E. Lawrence.\n\nMore than just a cool gimmick, the map builds on a study published in Nature that tries to use Wikipedia to calculate “aims at building the most comprehensive and accurate database of notable individuals”.\n\nThe paper admits however that an emphasis on English Wikipedia may lead to “an Anglo-Saxon bias” in the data.\n\nZooming in will however unearth a wealth of famous people noted for their Welsh language contribution, from Dafydd ap Gwilym to Williams Williams Pantycelyn.\n\nSome entries may be less well-liked, such as Edward II in Caernarfon.\n\nThe final rankings are based on:\n\nThe number of Wikipedia editions of each individual;\n\nThe length, i.e total number of words found in all available biographies. It is equal to zero for individuals with just one Wikidata entry and no biography in Wikipedia;\n\nThe average number of biography views (hits) for each individual between 2015 and 2018 in all available language editions, using an API available here or zero in the absence of a Wikipedia biography;\n\nThe number of non-missing items retrieved from Wikipedia or Wikidata for birth date, gender and domain of influence. The intuition here is that the more notable the individual, the more documented his/her biographies will be;\n\nThe total number of external links (sources, references, etc.) from Wikidata.\n\nLet us know who was the most famous person from your area below!"
