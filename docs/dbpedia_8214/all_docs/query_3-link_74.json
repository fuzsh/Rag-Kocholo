        "text": "There's no doubt that Newport has changed a lot over the years.\n\nThe city is best known for its iconic landmarks like the Transporter Bridge and historical links to the Chartist movement.\n\nBut if you grew up there, you'll probably remember it for an entirely different list of reasons.\n\nWhat were your favourite memories of growing up in Newport? Tell us in the comments - here.\n\nHere's a few things you'll only remember if you grew up in the 'Port.\n\n1. Going to see the giant clock in John Frost Square\n\nBack in the day, it was not uncommon to head into town to check out the giant mechanical clock on the square, staring open-mouthed as it split apart to reveal a bizarre world of skeletons, devils, cuckoos and angels.\n\nAfter perplexing onlookers for 16 years, the clock was moved out of the city centre, and nowadays you have to travel to Llanwern to see it in all its glory.\n\n2. Swimming down to the bottom of Maindee swimming pool in your pyjamas to collect bricks while learning to swim\n\nMost Newport kids will remember weeks learning to swim in Maindee in Year 5 or 6 - we're not quite sure how retrieving a brick came into it, but it's certainly stayed in our memories!\n\n3. Getting a piping hot cup of Bovril at half time watching the County play\n\nGood days or bad (and there were a lot of bad), was there anything better than rocking up to Newport Stadium (or Somerton Park, depending on your age) and taking in the roars of the crowd and the smell of deep fried chips from the stalls?\n\n4. Flicking through the dusty racks of cassettes and tapes of Hitman Records on a Saturday morning to find something you heard that week on Steve Lamacq's Radio One show\n\nIt's hard to believe now, but record stores back in the day were almost ten-a-penny and, mid-morning on a Saturday, you'd literally have to squeeze yourself in among the crowds of customers.\n\n5. Getting chips and eating them sitting on the statues in the city centreâ€¦\n\nVacara's, if you were in the city centre, or if you weren't, your local favourite (a debate for another day).\n\n6. Before going home to get ready to go back out again\n\nAfter a day in the shops in the city, there was nothing like popping home for a shower before heading back in for a pub crawl to Le Pub, the Murenger, or any of the old favourites before making the pilgrimage to the club.\n\n7. Sweaty nights spent watching a band in TJsâ€¦\n\nWe've all heard the tales of Kurt Cobain (not) proposing to Courtney Love, but there are countless other nights which most people will remember fondly from Newport's most famous club. Depending on your taste, you've probably got your own pick.\n\n8. And the state of the gentsâ€™ toilets in there\n\nThe less said about this the better.\n\n9. Going for a play in the Ruff â€˜nâ€™ Tumble ball pit in the old â€˜inshopsâ€™ when your parents went to go to Tesco\n\nMaybe you relished a trip to the old inshops with your mother on a Saturday, or maybe you were bored out of your tree walking around as she looked at the offers in Peacocks. But you always new there'd be a chance of a play in the ball pit, which made it all OK.\n\n10. Tucking into jam sandwiches with your friends on a summerâ€™s day in Beechwood Park\n\nBefore foreign holidays became cheap as chips, there was a certain perfection to going down to the park on a hot day in July with your mates and a packed lunch. Who would've thought Newport could match the Costa del Sol?\n\n11. Sledging down the massive hill in Beechwood Park on a snow day - or whatever big hill was closest to you (the hill at the top of Allt-Yr-Yn View, anyone?)\n\nAlways a favourite, there was nothing more magical than a snow day, not least when your nearest big hill could make for the perfect impromptu sledging slope. There might have been a few bumps and bruises as a result, but it was always worth it.\n\n12. Going to the cinema at ABC where the Travel Lodge is now and enjoying a Pizza Hut afterwards\n\nGenerations queued outside the doors of this cinema to watch the latest blockbuster, Cokes and boxes of popcorn in their hands. Sadly the cinema later closed and was replaced with a Travel Lodge.\n\n13. Almost every child in Newport had a Zap Zone or bowling birthday party at the old Megabowl\n\nThe smell of sweat and bowling shoes was a regular feature of a birthday party in Megabowl in the retail park, where you could battle it out with your friends to your heart's content, armed with laser guns.\n\n14. Being taken across the Transporter Bridge and back, just for the sheer thrill of it\n\nYou didn't really understand it at the time, but that didn't diminish the temporary joy of a trip back and forth over the famous bridge with grandparents desperately trying to keep you occupied on a weekend.\n\n15. Heading to either Gilwern or Talybont on your Year 6 school trip to go orienteering or kayaking\n\nThere was nothing like the excitement of a trip to the outdoors with your friends, even if in reality it meant capsizing into freezing cold water at some point.\n\n16. Skateboarding at 'The Pig' - the back entrance to the market with the famous, you guessed it, statue of a pig near it - and being branded a 'sweaty'\n\nIt's a monument that commemorates 700 years of markets in Newport, but the famous bronze statue was also the spot where as a wannabe punk you'd spend afternoons skateboarding around by the back of the market near the station.\n\n17. Starting off your clubbing careers at Delilahâ€™s, Mojoâ€™s and Meze, and the morning hangovers that inevitably followed\n\nNewport's had countless famous clubs over the years - chances are you had a different favourite - but there was nothing like dancing your heart out to metal and pop punk on the dancefloor on a Saturday night, in between trips to the bar to down another revolting shot."
