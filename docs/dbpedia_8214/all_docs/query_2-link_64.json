        "text": "WALES may be a relatively small country, but many thousands of Welsh people have made their mark either in their native homeland or even on a global scale.\n\nA glance at the Hall of Fame section elsewhere on the EweGottaLove website gives a flavour of some of the great and the good to have flown the flag for Wales all over the world, but of course there are many, many more notable figures who we are proud to call Welsh.\n\nThe following lists are far from exhaustive and here at EweGottaLove we are always happy to consider new names for inclusion.\n\nPrimarily, these lists contain people of Welsh heritage and descent, and occasionally those otherwise perceived as Welsh; through either birth or adoption. A few versatile people, whose influence spread into multiple fields, may appear in more than one section.\n\nAs for sport, we have said elsewhere on EweGottaLove that Wales has often punched above its weight in international terms, so we have a whole separate section for our sporting notables.\n\nAll of these lists will be kept under constant review and we are happy to hear from ewe about inevitable oversights. Notable Welsh writers, for instance, merit a website all of their own, so we have had to be selective. By all means, e-mail us at [email protected] to offer your thoughts and suggestions.\n\nSome ewe may have heard of, some not, but from philanthropists to philosophers, from models to monarachs, let’s celebrate the Welsh men and women who have wowed the world.\n\nACTORS\n\nKeith Allen (born 1953)\n\nBennett Arron (born 1973), actor, comedian, writer\n\nStanley Baker (1927–1976)\n\nAneurin Barnard (born 1987)\n\nHywel Bennett (1944–2017)\n\nDavid Bower (born 1969)\n\nRob Brydon (born 1965)\n\nRichard Burton (1925–1984)\n\nBoyd Clack (born 1951), actor, writer, musician\n\nRichard Ian Cox (born 1973), actor, comedian and radio host\n\nTimothy Dalton (born 1946)\n\nCharles Danby (1858-1906), actor\n\nJosie d’Arby (born 1973), actor, presenter\n\nGareth David-Lloyd (born 1981)\n\nGarnon Davies (born 1982)\n\nPhoebe Davies (1864–1912)\n\nRichard Davies (1926–2015)\n\nRyan Davies (1937–1977)\n\nWindsor Davies (1930–2019)\n\nRobert East (born 1943)\n\nAimee-Ffion Edwards (born 1987)\n\nMaudie Edwards (1906–1991)\n\nTaron Egerton (born 1989)\n\nTom Ellis (born 1978)\n\nPeg Entwistle (1908–1932)\n\nClifford Evans (1912–1985)\n\nLuke Evans (born 1979)\n\nPam Ferris (born 1948)\n\nHuw Garmon (born 1966)\n\nColin George (born 1929)\n\nMali Harries (born 1976)\n\nMatthew Gravelle (born 1976)\n\nHugh Griffith (1912–1980)\n\nKenneth Griffith (1921–2006)\n\nIoan Gruffudd (born 1973)\n\nEdmund Gwenn (1875–1958)\n\nMike Gwilym (born 1949)\n\nRobert Gwilym (born 1956)\n\nLyn Harding (1867–1952)\n\nDoris Hare (1905–2000)\n\nRichard Harrington (born 1975)\n\nGeorgia Henshaw (born 1993)\n\nAnthony Hopkins (born 1937)\n\nDonald Houston (1923–1991)\n\nGlyn Houston (born 1926)\n\nAneirin Hughes (born 1958)\n\nGareth Hughes (1894–1965)\n\nNerys Hughes (born 1941)\n\nRhys Ifans (born 1968)\n\nEmrys James (1928–1989)\n\nHywel John (born c.1970), more notable as a playwright\n\nMargaret John (1926–2011)\n\nGlynis Johns (born 1923)\n\nMervyn Johns (1899–1992)\n\nGary Jones (born 1958)\n\nRuth Jones (born 1967)\n\nTerry Jones (1942–2020)\n\nEddie Ladd, also a contemporary dancer\n\nKate Lamb\n\nGwilym Lee (born 1983)\n\nDesmond Llewelyn (1914–1999)\n\nBernard Lloyd (born 1934)\n\nPhilip Madoc (1934–2012)\n\nRuth Madoc (1943-2022)\n\nSteven Meo (born 1977)\n\nRay Milland (1907–1986)\n\nEve Myles (born 1978)\n\nKimberley Nixon (born 1985)\n\nJonny Owen (born 1971)\n\nKai Owen (born 1975)\n\nJoanna Page (born 1978)\n\nSiân Phillips (born 1934)\n\nTom Price (born 1980)\n\nJonathan Pryce (born 1947)\n\nIan Puleston-Davies (born 1959)\n\nAngharad Rees (born 1949)\n\nRoger Rees (1944–2015)\n\nIwan Rheon (born 1985)\n\nSteffan Rhodri (born 1967)\n\nIeuan Rhys (born 1961)\n\nMatthew Rhys (born 1974)\n\nPaul Rhys (born 1963)\n\nJohn Rhys-Davies (born 1944)\n\nIeuan Rhys Williams (born 1909)\n\nRachel Roberts (1927–1980)\n\nMatt Ryan (born 1981)\n\nMichael Sheen (born 1969)\n\nSarah Siddons (1755–1831)\n\nWilliam Simons (1940–2019)\n\nSteve Speirs (born 1965)\n\nVictor Spinetti (1933–2012)\n\nGareth Thomas (born 1945)\n\nTalfryn Thomas (1922–1982)\n\nWilliam Thomas\n\nTim Vincent (born 1972), also presenter\n\nMelanie Walters\n\nNaunton Wayne (1901–1970)\n\nAndy Whitfield (1972–2011)\n\nIan Whyte (born 1971)\n\nRobert Wilfort\n\nEmlyn Williams (1905–1987), also dramatist\n\nPeter Wingfield (born 1962)\n\nOwain Yeoman (born 1978)\n\nCatherine Zeta-Jones (born 1969)\n\nAlexander Vlahos (born 1988)\n\nARCHITECTS\n\nJonathan Adams (born 1961)\n\nWilliam Edwards (1719–1789)\n\nAlwyn Sheppard Fidler (1909–1990)\n\nJohn St. Bodfan Gruffydd (1910–2004)\n\nInigo Jones (1573–1652), born in London to Welsh parents\n\nJohn Jones (1810–1869)\n\nOwen Jones (1809–1874), born in London of Welsh descent\n\nErnest Morgan (1881–1954)\n\nJohn Nash (1753–1835), born in London to Welsh parents\n\nMalcolm Parry (born c.1938), architect, academic and TV presenter\n\nJohn Prichard (1817–1886)\n\nGwynne Pugh (currently active)\n\nDavid Wyn Roberts (1911–1982)\n\nPercy Thomas (1883–1969)\n\nRevd.
