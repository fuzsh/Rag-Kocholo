        "text": "Some of them were born here, some live here now, and several attended school in Somerset before finding fame.\n\nHere are 20 celebrities you will almost certainly recognise with ties to Somerset.\n\nBoris Johnson\n\nThe Prime Minister was recently spotted looking dishevelled at Taunton Station as he cut his holiday in the south west short to return to London.\n\nIt is believed that he returned to the capital on Sunday because of the crisis taking place in Afghanistan.\n\nJohnson, 57, was born in New York but spent time during his childhood at his family’s 500-acre farm in Nethercote, West Somerset.\n\nWhen the Prime Minister was in intensive care with Covid-19 in April 2020, the nearby village of Winsford sent him their \"good wishes and thoughts through this very difficult time\".\n\nMick Jagger\n\nThe Rolling Stones singer's brother, Chris Jagger, lives in a farmhouse near Glastonbury.\n\nAlthough his musical career did not reach the heights of Mick’s, Chris, 73, has recorded several albums and toured in the UK and abroad.\n\nHe recently finished working on his new album, Mixing Up the Medicine, which will be released on the same day as his autobiography, Talking to Myself (Friday, September 10).\n\nHe recently said in an interview: “The only thing I’m jealous of is Mick’s hair.”\n\nMaisie Williams\n\nWilliams, 24, is best known for playing Arya Stark in the critically acclaimed HBO fantasy drama Game of Thrones.\n\nShe grew up in Clutton, just south of Bath and Bristol – but very nearly missed out on Game of Thrones for a very West Country reason.\n\nIn 2014, Williams said: “I had a school trip on the day of my audition actually, and I really wanted to go because we were going to a pig farm – who doesn’t want to go to a pig farm when you’re 12 years old?\n\n“My mum was like, ‘You should go, you don’t have anything to lose.”\n\nSpeaking about Clutton, she said: “It’s just such a lovely place to escape from the crazy life that I find myself in sometimes these days, and it’s a lovely place to just chill out where I’m just Maisie again and not ‘the girl off the telly’ or anything like that.”\n\nDame Mary Berry\n\nNational treasure Mary Berry, who became a dame in the Queen’s Birthday Honours last October, was “immensely honoured” to be awarded the freedom of Bath in 2014.\n\nShe was born there in 1935 and, when she was 17, her father Alleyne Berry served as the 724th mayor of the city.\n\nShe studied catering and institutional management at Bath College of Domestic Science before publishing 70 cookery books and presenting numerous shows, including The Great British Bake-Off, in a career spanning six decades.\n\nBill Bailey\n\nStrictly Come Dancing winner Bill Bailey was born in Bath in 1965, grew up in Keynsham, and attended King Edward’s School in Somerset’s Roman city.\n\nThe comedian, singer and actor won the hugely popular BBC competition in 2020 with his dance partner Oti Mabuse.\n\nAlongside his stand-up, he is known for appearing on panel shows Never Mind the Buzzcocks, QI and Have I Got News For You.\n\nHe appeared alongside Simon Pegg and Nick Frost in Edgar Wright’s 2007 police comedy Hot Fuzz, in which he played twin sergeants working for Sandford Police.\n\nThe film, which is the second instalment of the Cornetto Trilogy, was filmed in Wells, Somerset.\n\nEdgar Wright\n\nBefore filming Hot Fuzz in Wells, director Edgar Wright grew up in the city and attended The Blue School there between 1985 and 1992.\n\nThe school allowed him to borrow the school’s video camera and show his films, for which he charged 50p admission.\n\nHis drama teacher, Peter Wild, even made a cameo appearance in Hot Fuzz as a Village of the Year judge.\n\nIn 2016, a blue plaque was unveiled at the school in his honour.\n\nWright said: “I hope it will make these young people think, if a skinny Blue School teenager can become a famous Hollywood film writer and director, what can I achieve?”\n\nDame Jacqueline Wilson\n\nThe children’s author, who has sold more than 35 million books, was born in Bath, although she spent much of her childhood living in Kingston-upon-Thames in Surrey.\n\nShe wrote around 40 books before The Story of Tracy Beaker became a hit in 1991.\n\nIn 2002, it was adapted into a successful CBBC series that has seen several revivals – most recently, My Mum Tracy Beaker, which aired earlier this year.\n\nShe is also known for writing Love Frankie, Double Act and The Suitcase Kid.\n\nJohn Cleese\n\nComedy legend John Cleese was born in Weston-Super-Mare and became a big fan of Somerset County Cricket Club after watching them play Sussex with his father in 1948.\n\nIn an interview with the cricket club, Cleese revealed that he grew his moustache in honour of Bertie Buse, who played 304 first-class matches for Somerset.\n\nCleese said: “The two people I liked the most in the world were Bertie Buse and my father and they both had moustaches. Bertie was a wonderful character and I loved him.”\n\nBefore becoming a household name by appearing in Fawlty Towers, Monty Python and the Harry Potter films, Cleese went to St Peter’s Preparatory School in Weston-Super-Mare and Clifton College in Bristol.\n\nGary Rhodes\n\nThe late Gary Rhodes used to be the head chef at The Castle Hotel in Taunton, retaining its Michelin star when he was only 26.\n\nAfter that, he worked at The Greenhouse in Mayfair before carving out a television career with appearances on Masterchef and Hell’s Kitchen.\n\nAfter the popular chef’s death in November 2019 at the age of just 59, The Castle Hotel owner, Kit Chapman MBE, said: “It is with a profound sense of loss that I hear the sad news of the death of Gary Rhodes.\n\n\"In the late 80s he made (The Castle) famous by reviving the fortunes of the English culinary repertoire.”\n\nJenson Button\n\nThe first of two Formula 1 drivers on this list, Jenson Button was born in Frome and bought up in nearby Vobster.\n\nIn 2009, he won the Formula 1 World Championship while driving for Brawn GP.\n\nBrawn, later renamed Mercedes GP (now Mercedes-AMG Petronas Formula 1 Team), won the Constructors’ Championship in the same season after rising from the ashes of Honda's F1 team.\n\nAfter seven seasons at McLaren, Button, 41, retired from driving F1 cars and now works as a Sky Sports pundit and senior advisor to the Williams team.\n\nDeborah Meaden\n\nThe businesswoman is best known as one of the dragons on the BBC Two series Dragon’s Den, which sees budding entrepreneurs pitch their business ideas to multi-millionaires.\n\nShe was born in Taunton and now lives in a 10-bedroom farmhouse on the Somerset Levels that she shares with her husband Paul and dozens of animals.\n\nLast year, Meaden told the Gazette: “Whatever the weather, even if it’s freezing or raining, first thing in the morning I go outside barefoot and just in my dressing gown and walk around the farm.\n\n“There’s something about starting the day actually touching the world and having nothing between me and the earth is incredibly grounding.”\n\nShe is reportedly worth £40 million and, in 2013, partnered Robin Windsor in the 11th series of Strictly Come Dancing but was eliminated in week five.\n\nSir Ian Botham\n\nA former cricketer and current member of the House of Lords, Sir Ian Botham lived in Yeovil from an early age.\n\nHis parents moved to the town when his father got a job as a test engineer at Westland Helicopters.\n\nBotham attended Milford Junior School as a boy while developing his love of cricket – a sport both his parents played.\n\nAfter captaining the under-16 team at Buckler’s Mead Comprehensive School at the age of 13, he joined the youth set-up at Somerset County Cricket Club.\n\nHe went on to play 102 Test matches for England between 1977 and 1992.\n\nHe was knighted in 2007 in recognition of his services to charity and cricket, and the Brexiteer joined the House of Lords last year as a crossbench peer.\n\nVanessa White\n\nWhite, who was a member of The Saturdays, was born in Yeovil and still visits Somerset when she can.\n\nThe band formed in 2007 after the five members successfully auditioned and were active until 2014.\n\nThey rose to stardom with their singles If This Is Love and Up, which both reached the UK top 10.\n\nWhite said in an interview in 2018: “I came along and started to grow up in Yeovil but my mum never really settled. I think it was not cosmopolitan enough for her at the time.\n\n“She had friends in East London and we moved there.
