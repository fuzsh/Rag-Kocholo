Onboard Titanic as she sailed away from Southampton on 10th April 1912 were a number of people who lived in or were born in Wales, United Kingdom. Amongst those people with a Welsh connection were seven passengers and one ships officer who were residents of or who had most recently resided in Wales. in addition, there were a further three passengers and 14 crew members aboard who are known to have been born in Wales.\n\nAll but two of the passengers aboard from Wales were traveling as third-class passengers, the other two traveled as second-class passengers. Amongst the Welshman aboard was TItanics Fifth Officer, Harold Lowe. It is sad to note that the vast majority of the crew and all of the passengers connected to Wales were lost in the disaster on 15th April 1912.\n\nIts interesting to note that a third of the Welsh crew and all but one of the Welsh passengers were from the now historic county of Glamorgan, including Cardiff and Swansea.\n\n3rd class passengers (lost in sinking)\n\nDavid Bowen - a 20-year-old professional boxer, along with another professional boxer from Wales, Leslie Williams, traveling to the United States to box.

He was born in Llanrhos, Conwy, Wales. He is notable for being in charge of Titanic's Lifeboat 14 which returned to pick up survivors from the water after the sinking. He survived the Titanic disaster. Fifth Officer Lowe, portrayed by Ioan Gruffudd, was featured in James Camerons 1997 Titanic film, most prominently in the scenes depicting his lifeboat returning to search for survivors in the water.\n\nThomas Jones - a 34-year-old Able Seaman born in Cemaes, Anglesey, Wales.

Although Titanic never visited Wales, she did pass in between Ireland and Wales as she sailed south down the Irish Sea and then the Celtic Sea, passing close to the Smalls Lighthouse, Pembrokeshire, Wales, on 3rd April 1912 as she was making her delivery trip from her shipbuilders in Belfast to her effective homeport in Southampton, in preparation for her maiden voyage.\n\nRelated pages - Titanic Lookouts and Crow's Nest, All Titanic Pages"
