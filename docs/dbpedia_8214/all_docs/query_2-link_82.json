        "text": "Dame Shirley Bassey was born on the 8th January 1937 in Tiger Bay, Cardiff. She is Famous for being the first Welsh woman to reach number 1 in the British charts. She sang famous James Bond theme songs such as ‘Goldfinger’ and ‘Diamonds are Forever’.\n\nShirley Bassey was the youngest of six children, her mother was originally from England and her father from Nigeria. She recalls one teacher during choir practice asking her to sing outside in the corridor so that the other children’s voices could be heard!\n\nShe left school aged 15 to work in a factory and also sang in clubs during the evenings. In 1953, she earned £14 a week, which was a lot of money for a teenager at the time.\n\nShe signed her first contract at the age of 16 and toured various theatres. In 1959, her song ‘As I Love You’ reached Number 1 and remained there for four weeks. Many of her songs reached the charts and became great hits. She made her television debut in 1960 when she appeared on the Ed Sullivan Show.\n\nShirley performed at President Kennedy’s Washington Gala, for the Queen in her Golden Jubilee celebrations and the Duke of Edinburgh on his 80th birthday. In 1999, wearing a gown with a Welsh flag design, Shirley performed the official Rugby World Cup song with Bryn Terfel in Cardiff. More recently, Bassey has undertaken a number of charitable projects. In 2020, she released an album, ‘I Owe it All To You’.\n\nInteresting Fact\n\nShe is the first woman to chart an album in the top 40 of the UK Albums Chart in seven consecutive decades!\n\nBetty Campell was born in 1934 and died on the 13 October 2017. She was born in Butetown, Cardiff. She is famous for being Wales’ first Black headteacher and a community activist who helped to establish Black History Month. Betty was born Rachel Elizabeth Johnson. She was the daughter of Honora and Simon Vickers Johnson. Her mother was Welsh Barbadian, and her father Jamaican. Her father was killed in the Second World War.\n\nShe loved reading and was top of her class in school, gaining a scholarship to attend Lady Margaret High School. Betty decided she wanted to be a teacher but was told that she’d face ‘insurmountable’ difficulties gaining employment as a Black teacher. This made her even more focused on her goals. Betty married Rupert Campbell and they had four children. In 1960, whilst juggling the demands of a young family, she went to study at Cardiff Teacher Training College and went on to teach for 28 years. She often talked about the hostility she faced as a Black teacher from some parents. When she became a headteacher in the 1970s, she taught the children about Black history and apartheid in South Africa. Prince Charles once visited her school, and she was invited to meet Nelson Mandela on his only visit to Wales. Between 1999 and 2004, she was an independent councillor for Butetown.\n\nInteresting Fact\n\nA statue by the sculptor Eve Shepherd has been erected in her memory in Cardiff\n\nIn 1948, the Empire Windrush arrived at Tilbury Docks in Essex carrying over 1,000 passengers from the Caribbean Islands. They bravely left their friends and families back home in response to Britain’s call for post-war workers. Over the next 40 years, thousands followed in their footsteps, with many making Wales their new home.\n\nOn April 15, 1948, Jamaicans bought tickets for the HMT (Her Majesty’s Transport) Empire Windrush. At the time, Jamaica’s economy was struggling and suffering from the effects of a hurricane a few years earlier.\n\nA small advert was placed in a newspaper announcing a ‘passenger opportunity’ to sail from Jamaica to the UK on the HMT Empire Windrush. The price of a ticket (on what was called the Troop Deck) was £28, that’s around £1000 today.\n\nAround 500 Jamaicans bought tickets. Some wanted to live and work in Britain, with hopes of a better life.\n\nSome had served in the British armed forces during the war and wanted to re-join. While others made the journey out of curiosity and wanted to see what lay ahead here.\n\nThe history of the Windrush generation in Wales was recently the focus of an oral history project delivered by Race Council Cymru and funded by National Lottery Heritage Fund. During the course of the project, Windrush Generation Cymru from across the country shared their stories of migration and their memories of forging a new life in Wales.\n\nThis powerful exhibition features the stories of over 40 of those Windrush Generation Cymru, told in their own words. Learn about their journeys to Wales, and the challenges they faced in building a new life in a country far from their homelands – finding work and the attitudes of people towards them.\n\nThe stories show how the Windrush Generation Cymru, and their descendants, have made their mark in all walks of Welsh life: through the jobs they worked, careers they built, the children they raised, and the contributions they made to our communities and culture\n\nIn 2002, an exhibition titled Belonging in the Oriel 1 gallery at St Fagans was launched, known then as the Museum of Welsh Life. It was the first time the museum had reflected diversity in its narrative of Wales. During the launch, a guest said “I’ve waited over twenty years for this.” She was a teacher in Butetown, a part of Cardiff with one of the longest standing Black communities in the UK. Yet that history had not been told in Wales’ national museum.\n\nOriel 1 was the first step in reinventing St Fagans as a participatory National Museum of History, working with communities to reflect the diversity of life stories and identities which make up Wales.\n\nHe is a third generation Welsh Somali, born and bred in Butetown was interviewed on Zoom for the exhibition:\n\nMy grandfather was a merchant sailor and so was my father. I grew up in the Docks and I think that really made me the person I am. It was living in Butetown. Before the word multiculturalism existed, it existed in Butetown, because we have over fifty six nationalities all living in a square mile radius. I was fortunate and privileged enough to have been exposed to so many cultures, so many different religions, so many different people. And also amazing activists like Betty Campbell, Neil Sinclair, Chalky White, Gaynor Legall and Sheik Mohamed. There were so many inspirational people I’d kind of grown up around. But also the merchant sailors. I remember I used to sit down in one of the seamen’s teahouses at the age of about six or seven and just being in awe of them. They used to tell us about their travels to Argentina or when their merchant ships were torpedoed in the Second World War. It was so fascinating to me. I used to go back every day with my father just to listen to the elders and their stories.\n\n\"Black history is Welsh history. And, you know, we need to be proud of that and really celebrate that every single day and every moment. When my children go to school, and they’re taught about Black History, it becomes this huge event. But it isn’t a huge event, it’s a reality. It’s our reality. This is what we face on a day to day basis. It’s about acknowledging that reality and trying to change it. And I think we can only do that if we talk about it, or if there is space regardless of what month it is, just to continue with that every single day. Because this is our reality, it doesn’t stop for us. And I think Black history awareness shouldn’t stop either. Because racism isn’t going to stop. We’re at the stage now where we have to take the next step. And we have taken the next step in Wales. We are kind of leading the world really. It is in the national curriculum, whereas with our counterparts across the border, that hasn’t been the case. We’re also quite fortunate in that we’ve got a Welsh Government that really genuinely believes in every voice… We’re leading the way and we should be proud. We should really be proud. \"\n\nBack-a-Yard is an oral history project which is gathering the stories of African-Caribbean people who came to live in Newport during the 1950s and 1960s (and later), including their memories of the Caribbean and their reasons for coming to the UK. The eighteen-month project is run by the SEWREC and supported by the National Lottery through the Heritage Lottery Fund. The project runs from October 2014 to March 2016.\n\nMrs Veris Carnegie - (An example of a story from website)\n\nA Jamaican childhood\n\nVeris grew up in Mountainside where her parents were bakers. Her father’s name was Fred Mullins and he came from Barbary Hall.\n\nVeris would help to make bread, buns and cake for her parents shop and the night market that was popular with local policemen from Black River, Santa Cruz and Maggotty.\n\nAmong her favourite recipes were bulla cake – a rich Jamaican cake made with molasses, nutmeg and ginger – and cocoa bread.\n\nThe family were Anglican and Veris sang in the choir.\n\nComing to the UK\n\nVeris waved her husband Clement goodbye on New Year’s Eve 1959 and didn’t see him again until 1961 when he sent for her to join him in the UK.\n\nClement had been renting a flat in Wolverhampton but when his wife arrived, the couple moved to Newport where Clement’s brother Stanley was already living.\n\nLike many Caribbean people, the couple left their two children – Patrick and Viveen – behind in the care of Veris’s mother. Both children remained in Jamaica and the Carnegies paid for them to go to college there. Viveen is now a teacher on Grand Cayman.\n\nIn Newport, Veris soon found work at Crompton Batteries where she stayed for eight years.\n\nThe Kendal railway crash\n\nVeris remembers hearing about the Kendal railway crash on September 1, 1957, which left nearly 200 dead and 700 injured.\n\nShe recalls how the train left the railway line and fell to the bottom of a narrow gully. The terrain was not level and the train had to go around a hill.\n\nThe Caribbean community in Pill\n\nIn Newport, the Carnegies lived at 3 Capel Crescent, Pill. Their immediate neighbours were Thomsons furniture shop (which is still trading) and a garage with huge doors.\n\nIn those days, no-one in Pill locked their front doors, not even at night. Veris remembers once mistaking the house next door for her own; she was halfway up the stairs before her elderly neighbour stopped her.\n\nThe Caribbean community was strong in the 1960s and 1970s, with blues parties and dancing every Saturday night. The Carnegies would dance the night away at the popular Silver Sands on Commercial Road.\n\nVeris wrote home regularly, putting money in her letters"
