        "text": "Newport is known for its rich history and diverse culture.\n\nThough, like all locations across the world, it is the uniqueness of the people who are at the heart of any city.\n\nAnd the people of Newport are no different, with the residents of Wales' third largest city popping up in all sorts of vocations.\n\nFrom singers and actors, to business people and sports stars, the natives of Newport are making themselves known in whatever it is they do.\n\nMaybe its luck, or maybe there's just something in the air, but these are 19 of the biggest names that Newport has given to the world, in no particular order.\n\n1. Aimee-Ffion Edwards\n\nA familiar face to TV viewers, actress, Aimee-Ffion Edwards makes the list of Newport's finest after her on-screen break through in the 2008 season of Skins, while playing obsessive Welsh girl Sketch.\n\nThe 32-year-old attended Ysgol Gymraeg Casnewydd, in Llanwern, before joining the National Youth Theatre of Wales, and is a fluent speaker in both Welsh and English.\n\nEdwards is best known for her part as Esme Shelby in the popular BBC drama Peaky blinders, and has also made appearances in Casualty and Being human.\n\n2. Michael Sheen\n\nBorn in Newport in 1969, Welsh actor Michael Sheen is one of Wales' most famous exports, known for his roles in a variety of major films such as the Twilight Saga, Blood Diamond, and the Damned United.\n\nHe became widely known as a screen actor in the early 2000's making his break-out performance while playing broadcaster David Frost in the hit movie Frost/Nixon in 2008.\n\nThe 51-year-old started life in Newport before moving to Port Talbot, the place he now considers to be his home town, and is known for his public championing the Welsh culture and people.\n\n3. Christian Malcolm\n\nDespite having trials with Nottingham Forest football club as a 15-year-old, Welsh sprinter Christian Malcolm decided to follow the path of athletics, going on to become one of the country's most prominent 200 metre runners.\n\nAfter winning two gold medals at the 1998 Junior World Championships in the 100m and 200m, Malcolm went on to receive a number of senior honours with the Welsh and British team during his illustrious career.\n\nHighlights included a silver medal at the Commonwealth games in Kuala Lumpur, as well as a World Championship silver medal in 2010.\n\nThe speedster from Hartridge High school retired from running in 2014, before taking a coaching role with the Australian athletics team in 2019.\n\n4. Florence Olivia Tunks\n\nBorn in Newport in 1891 Florence Olivia Tunks was a militant women's rights activist who played a major role in campaigning for women's suffrage in the UK.\n\nIn April 1914, Tunks along with fellow-suffragette Hilda Burkitt famously burnt down the pavilion at the Brittania Pier in Great Yarmouth, before torching the Bath Hotel in Felixstowe and causing £35,000 of damage.\n\nTunks received a nine-months behind bars for the attacks, serving her sentence in Holloway Prison. She later became a registered nurse before her death in East Sussex in 1985, though the 93 year old is still remembered by historians for her contribution to the suffragette's cause.\n\n5. Josie d'Arby\n\nTelevision presenter Josie d'Arby presented a number of high profile shows in the 90's and early 2000's, including her own Channel 5 talk show Josie, and popular children's art show Smart.\n\nd'Arby has also made appearances on BBC comedy Miranda, Mersey Beat, and still regularly presents Proms in the Park and Songs of Praise.\n\n6. Bobby Windsor\n\nNicknamed The Duke, Welsh rugby legend Bobby Windsor played the majority of his career whilst working as a steel worker in south Wales.\n\nWidely regarded as one of the best hookers ever, Windsor was part of the famous Pontypool front row, playing alongside Graham Price and Charlie Faulkner.\n\nWindsor played his club rugby for Cross-Keys and Pontypool, and earned 28 caps for Wales as well as taking part in two British Lions tours of South Africa and New Zealand.\n\n7.
