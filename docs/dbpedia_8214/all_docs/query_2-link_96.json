        "text": "Magic Mike actor Tatum made a surprise cameo in hit sequel Deadpool & Wolverine as X-Men character Gambit (Remy LeBeau), having been linked to the character for many years.\n\n“Gambit is a guy Chan was born to play,” Reynolds said in a post on Instagram.\n\n“His story is similar to my road on Deadpool — in that Chan spent a decade trying to put the most comic-accurate version of Gambit on the big screen.\n\n“Remy LeBeau is grafted to his soul and needs to come out and deal.\n\n“Some characters can only exist with a one in a billion pairing and this is it.\n\n“Gambit found his author in Chan. He’s one of the coolest, smartest characters in Comics and still largely unexplored.”\n\nReynolds gave his nod of approval for future projects with Tatum as Gambit, writing “I want more”.\n\nHe added: “Having the chance to say goodbye to some of these heroes is as important as having new characters to root for… and rooting for Gambit is easy. Rooting for Chan is even easier.\n\n“He’s one of the greatest, hardest working, kindest people in this entire industry.\n\n“I couldn’t be more thrilled to see @channingtatum pull Gambit from the dead and bring him to life at the perfect time and perfect way.”\n\nIt comes days after Tatum praised Reynolds, saying “there is almost no one that has had my back in this industry more” over the last decade.\n\n“I thought I had lost Gambit forever. But he (Ryan) fought for me and Gambit,” Tatum wrote.\n\n“I will owe him probably forever. Cause I’m not sure how I could ever do something that would be equal to what this has meant to me.”\n\nOther cameos in Deadpool & Wolverine include Reynolds’ wife Blake Lively as Lady Deadpool and Jennifer Garner who reprised her role as martial arts trained assassin Elektra Natchios.\n\n“I’ve worked with Jen twice now,” Reynolds said in a separate post on Instagram, having starred in The Adam Project together in 2022.\n\n“She brings a completely different scope of skills to each movie but can’t hide one detail…I don’t care how talented someone is, you can’t hide humanity.\n\n“She’s not only one of my favourite performers, she’s one of my favourite people. I love her and I will now and always, owe her one. Or five. What a baller. #ElektraForever.”\n\nReynolds also joked that Garner had a “blackbelt in nice” but has an “unblinking hurricane of vengeance”.\n\nCommenting on the post, Garner replied: “I’ll fight bad guys for you any day, @vancityreynolds, thank you so much for having me and for your years of kindness and generosity.”\n\nGarner also backed Tatum for a follow-up Gambit film, writing: “I’m ready for a Gambit movie, sequel, three-quel. Buying tickets now, @channingtatum.”"
