        "text": "One of the finest properties in Wales, with an interesting story to tell of a long line of the Morgan dynasty. Immense wealth from the early industrial age with all the trappings it brought and stories of heroism in the Crimea war and charge of the light brigade. Eventually, the profligate expenditure of a couple of the heirs left the lifestyle unsustainable and the estate was sold in the 1960s.\n\nVisited yesterday with lockdown measures in place, so only had access to the parkland, woodland and lake. Still had an excellent day out! Easy to find, clean toilets, and beautiful grounds perfect for a picnic. Other than one gap in the foliage where you can see the motorway, the reality is hidden behind magnificent trees and idyllic landscapes so you feel like you're worlds away.\n\nGreat place, especially at Christmas, with the house decorated, carols and staff dressed in period clothes; thanks for a great visit.\n\nWe had a really enjoyable visit to this fabulous museum.and garden in Caerleon.So much history and many interesting artefacts found locally on display.Kids would love it as there is an area with helmets and things to dress up in.The staff are really friendly and knowledgeable and told us lots of interesting facts about the area.Will definately visit again.Id like to see the Roman baths,which look amazing.Well worth a visit if youre in the area or live nearby.Oh and its free entry to the museum too,though you can give a donation if you choose!\n\nAmazing area with lots to see especially if you live all things Roman! There’s the excavated barracks, Amphitheatre, Roman Baths and Museum! Really fascinating so glad we visited! The village has a few pubs and coffee shops plus hotel so you can make a whole day of it!\n\nExcellent museum for amazing remains of a Roman bath house. The second Augustan Legion liked it so you should too! And only a fiver to get in so a bit of a bargain.\n\nLovely little 7km walk if you can manage to find your routed and have a good explore. Nice and flat so easy for all ages and types of walkers. The lighthouse is truly amazing small but built in the late 1800’s still Fully functioning. Very interesting and some nice views over the Severn estuary.\n\nLove walking here, the paths are well defined and on a lovely evening, you get stunning sunsets over the channel, lovely cafe and shop in the RSPB wetlands centre for a cup of hot chocolate after a lovely walk. what's not to love.\n\nBeautiful place. Would recommend parking on the street just outside and walking in as there is a charge for parking for non members. Sunset here is beautiful!"
