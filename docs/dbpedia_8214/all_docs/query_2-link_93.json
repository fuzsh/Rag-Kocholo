        "text": "The rain didn't stop 12 volunteers from the Principality Building Society Executive/Senior Leadership team from working together to erect a shed and polytunnel for the Growing Green Creative Horticultural Project in Cardiff. Various other tasks were completed such as digging up soil and planting fox gloves, weeding, moving stones to level the floor of the polytunnel and more. The Growing Green project work in partnership with Breathe Creative to support people with mental health and physical health challenges by having a safe space, a relaxed and welcoming outdoor environment to connect with others, enjoy the outdoors and do as much or little as they want in the allotment. Principality volunteers commented: \"Being part of the community and giving back is so important to the Principality Building Society.\" \"Although it is hard work at times, is it quite energising and nice to know that we are helping the Growing Green Project who support so many people in need.\" Adrian Brace, Project Manager at The Growing Green Creative Horticultural Project said, \"We are grateful for the Principality team of volunteers who've come out today. Their assistance has pushed forward our project enabling us to help people in the community. We don't have the people power to do the larger tasks. Having a volunteer team to support us has been fantastic!\" This project was facilitated by Business in the Community. #employeevolunteering"
