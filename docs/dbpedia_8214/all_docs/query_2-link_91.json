        "text": "The first thing I notice when I arrive in Newport is a large, multicoloured fibreglass dragon being stroked by a small boy. The dragon is covered in handprints – and also in words, among them \"change\", \"resilience\", \"freedom\", \"identity\", \"spirit\", \"survival\" and \"life\". The dragon, one of 60 distributed around the town, is breathing a message of transformation.\n\nThese so-called SuperDragons are here because next week, the Ryder Cup will be played in the city – or rather, on a specially designed golf course at the huge Celtic Manor hotel, which looms over the M4 at Newport's eastern edge. On the other side of the motorway is the Ringland estate: sprawling, tough, deprived, viscerally working class. \"Ringland – home of the Ryder Cup\", as one local wag's T-shirt puts it, to emphasise that this must be the oddest venue ever chosen for the biennial match between golfers from Europe and the US.\n\nI have a particular interest in this strange juxtaposition because I grew up in Ringland in the 60s, when Newport (thanks to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Llanwern_steelworks\" title=\"Llanwern <00ad>steelworks\">Llanwern steelworks, which had a workforce of more than 10,000) was prosperous, the estate was stable and crime-free, hard drugs were unheard of, parents were ambitious for their children, and there were jobs for those children to aspire to. Now the steelworks, reduced to processing rather than making steel, employs fewer than 1,000 workers; the estate is ravaged by crime, anti-social behaviour and drug use; and aspiration has largely died.\n\nCeltic Manor is a short walk from the house where I spent the first 18 years of my life. Ringland, virtually a town in its own right and home to more than 10,000 people, had just been built when I was born, carved out of farmland. It was very green and wooded then – a beautiful idea, with rows of houses separated by large green spaces – but gradually more roads were built, the lawns on which we played (immaculately kept by the council 40 years ago) were turned into carports, and the motorway and a large ancillary road hemmed the estate in. In the part where I lived, a haven of relative peace was turned into junction 24 of the M4. A wood was half-flattened (was there a planning inquiry?) to make way for a Holiday Inn, and fences erected around what remained. I had more or less grown up in that wood, feeder of dreams, and it irritated the hell out of me that later generations wouldn't have the same access, the same chance I had to disturb a hornets' nest and get a sting on the head that made it swell to twice its normal size and meant I had to wear dark glasses for a fortnight.\n\nBut the Holiday Inn was just the beginning. This spot, a few miles into Wales and right beside junction 24, was perfect for hotels, so when a 19th-century manor house that had for decades been a maternity hospital closed in the 70s, the Welsh-born IT billionaire Terry Matthews turned it into a small hotel. He added rooms and it became a medium-sized hotel. Then he had a vision: a five-star resort hotel that would combine golf, the perfect executive game, with conferences – and so Celtic Manor, with 400 rooms, a conference centre and three championship golf courses sprawling across 1,400 acres of the Usk Valley was conjured up, a stone's throw away from depressed, deprived Ringland. The contrast has always struck me as a perfect symbol of divided Britain: Mercs and Range Rovers gliding along up at the hotel, which sits atop a steep hill; ancient Mondeos and Fiestas chugging along on the estate.\n\nOn the eve of the Ryder Cup, which Matthews successfully bid for in 2001, I feel obliged to return – and not just, I hope, to indulge in cheap points-scoring. I have sympathy for the view expressed by a contributor to the Western Mail's website recently, who said: \"It is a poorly kept secret that the strategy for the Ryder Cup is to keep it out of Newport itself. Visitors will be carefully herded away from the city in the same way that World Cup visitors were herded away from the townships in South Africa. Very few businesses in the city will benefit.\"\n\nMost golf fans will, indeed, stay at hotels in Bristol and Cardiff, though several hundred Americans have opted for a luxury liner docked at Newport; they will be bussed to Celtic Manor, which will be sealed off to private cars and pedestrians for the entire week. Tickets to watch Tiger Woods et al cost more than £100 a day – way out of the price range of most Newportonians; and most of the financial benefits go to the company, Ryder Cup Ltd, which organises the event. Celtic Manor gets its weekend in the spotlight; the benefits for Newport are less tangible.\n\nBut there is a more positive view, which is why I trek up another hill (symbols of wealth and authority sit on hills in Newport) to the impressive, art-deco civic centre to meet Tracey Lee, managing director of Newport city council. \"This is about putting Newport on the map,\" she tells me. \"Celtic Manor is featured in the magazine on BA transatlantic flights this month. Would we have been able to afford that kind of marketing for Newport? No, not in a million years. Can you quantify what that brings? No, not immediately. But it's about raising awareness. It's also been important in bringing work to local employers, and giving us opportunities to work with companies that we want to bring to the area.\"\n\nLee thinks golf's exclusive image is changing, and says the sport has been built into the curriculum of local primary schools, with golf-themed maths and geography lessons (my seven-year-old nephew makes the same point, and insists I mention his school, St Gabriel's). But will local people really buy into the event?\n\n\"Tickets are expensive,\" Lee concedes, \"and most people won't get a ticket or even want one – but the fanzone in the city centre [a big screen in John Frost Square] isn't elitist, and Ian Woosnam is playing a round of crazy golf with the winner of a competition being held by the local paper. It's things like that which put a smile on people's faces.\"\n\nLee and the council are working hard to regenerate the city, and there has been a huge amount of development along the river. I make a point of having lunch at the city's first (and so far only) boutique hotel, the Waterloo, situated opposite the dock gates in a gritty but vivid area called Pillgwenlly (known locally as Pill), before taking a ride over the murky waters of the Usk on the gondola of the Transporter Bridge, the century-old symbol of Newport.\n\nRestored at a cost of £1m, the bridge – one of only eight such structures in the world – was reopened in July with a live performance by Alex Warren and Terema Wainwright of their YouTube sensation Newport (Ymerodraeth State of Mind), a brilliant parody of Jay-Z and Alicia Keys's Empire State of Mind (\"Twinned with Guangxi province China,/There's no province finer\"). It was a brave decision by the council to embrace this spoof – with its focus on Newport's cheese-and-chips culture – but a sound one. Newport can't be regenerated into something else entirely, some shiny smaller-scale version of nearby Cardiff. The dockside Waterloo hotel used to be a brothel, but the new owners don't deny that past: \"I tell people we have different working girls here now,\" says the woman behind the bar.\n\nOn the day I visit Celtic Manor, where I'm allowed to hit a few golf balls on the edge of the 18th hole, drive a buggy round the rain-soaked course and sit in the oak-panelled locker room that will soon house the finest golfers from Europe and the US, a press conference is being held by Welsh first minister Carwyn Jones to underline the branding benefits of the event for Wales. It's all a bit management-speak, and what is most interesting is that they have a Welsh translator on hand who doesn't have anything to do, because none of the journalists bother to don the headphones that offer a simultaneous translation. Afterwards, though, I do get a few minutes with the first minister – a burly man with grey hair who looks as if he knows his way around a rugby scrum – and ask him whether he thinks there's an irony in this global jamboree being held next to poor, excluded Ringland. How does it help the people living there?\n\n\"Ultimately it means the potential to bring more investment into Newport, and indeed across the whole of Wales,\" he says in smooth, practised politician-ese. \"There's a new railway station here, a new university campus, a riverfront theatre, the new Rodney Parade stadium is being built, and there are plans for the city centre.\" The politicians claim the Ryder Cup has concentrated minds and provided a 10-year timescale for regeneration from the winning of the bid in 2001. Newport planned to show its glitziest face to the world, and there has been progress. But because the credit crunch scuppered the development of a new shopping centre, the heart of the city is still a shambles and US visitors, if they bother to get off the bus, will be reminded of their own dodgy downtowns, with lots of youths pushing buggies and clutching cans of lager.\n\nWhat about the moaners, I ask Jones; all those in Newport who say this is a corporate beano that has nothing to do with them? \"You've got to have ambition,\" he insists. \"There will always be some people in Wales who take the view that we shouldn't host anything; we should sit in the corner and let the world go by. No chance – we've got to get out there and show the world we've got something to offer.\"\n\nThe first minister's message does not appear to have reached the few people hanging around a windswept John Frost Square when I pass through one evening. This square should be the centre of Newport's life and there have long been plans to reclaim it, but at the moment it's shabby, ugly and largely ignored. When I'm there, the chief point of visitor interest is a tattooed woman in a tracksuit trying to catch her son, who is running riot in a flowerbed.\n\nI ask a passerby, 72-year-old Raymond Myles, whether he thinks the Ryder Cup will give the town a boost. \"I don't think it'll do anything for Newport,\" he says in that sing-song accent which is distinctively south-east Welsh. \"The people who come won't stay in Newport, will they? It's a hole. All the Yanks will go to Cardiff. They won't come here. The council has done all this work in Newport, but it's still a shithole.\" Oddly, though, it's a shithole that he loves – friendly, neighbourly, great spirit, good sense of humour, without the dog-eat-dog mentality he has encountered elsewhere. Myles says he travelled the world with the army, but always came back to Newport: \"I've been to Malaya, Germany, Aden, but I wouldn't swap Newport.\" A shithole, but his shithole.\n\nA group of five young people are looking at a large silver globe-shaped sculpture in the square – Newport is very keen on public art. The most voluble, a music student called Josh Vickers, has come here to study from Cornwall and is enthusiastic about the city. \"I love it. It's got everything you need, but it's never overly busy. It's quite chilled.\" His friend, Tom Stockley, demurs. \"Newport's like a shit bit of Birmingham that's been cut out and put in the middle of Wales,\" he says pithily. \"To be fair, there isn't a lot to do here,\" admits Vickers, \"but you have to make the most of it. The Asda's cool.\"\n\nSo what will those famously glamorous American golfers' wives make of it? \"It's not exactly high-end London shopping,\" Vickers says. \"It hasn't got a Harrods.\" He advises the Wags to buy an outfit from a charity store and not be worried about what people think; to learn about Newport's culture (Chartism, kebabs, the \"hideous\" but historic Transporter Bridge); and to go to Meze, the latest hip club in a town noted for its pop and alternative music scene (in the 90s Newport was touted, a little too ambitiously, as the \"new Seattle\").\n\nAcross town, in the Ringland shopping centre, a blasted concrete nightmare that makes John Frost Square look like the Champs-Élysées, four youths are playing pitch-and-toss with pound coins – much more Ringland's game than golf. They are not especially moved by the imminence of the Ryder Cup: \"They've spent all these millions of pounds doing up Newport town centre, but they should have spent the money on a youth centre,\" says one. \"What's going to be left when the Ryder Cup goes? It'll probably all be back to vandalism.\" Not that vandalism has ever gone away – even some of the SuperDragons have been vandalised, leading to much soul-searching in the local paper. They invite me to play pitch-and-toss, but they look pretty good and I decide that claiming any losses on expenses might prove difficult.\n\nThe shopping centre houses Ringland Resource Centre, whose business administrator Sian Gwyer is also sceptical about the event's wider benefits. \"It's a lot of money for just a couple of days,\" she says, \"and I don't think Ringland is going to benefit from it, not in the slightest. A lot of people think the hotel is an eyesore, and they don't really have much to do with it. It's very much a them-and-us situation.\" She does, though, think Ringland is improving – because the Welsh Assembly-funded Communities First programme is getting young people into work, and single mothers to budget and organise their lives better.\n\nI remember that when this shopping centre was built in 1966, it had fountains in the middle of it; they've been concreted over – too expensive to maintain, too many frolicking children – and now youngsters are performing wheelies where they once stood. Maybe one day they'll come back, along with the idea that a large community of not very wealthy working-class people should live in pleasant, uplifting surroundings.\n\nAs well as the resource centre, Ringland shopping centre offers a long-established butchers, a post office, newsagents, busy bookies, a Costcutter supermarket and the obligatory Greggs bakery. The golfing Wags – and even the golfers themselves – should pay a courtesy call to bridge the cultural divide. A visit could even form part of Tiger Woods's rehabilitation. Just ignore the barbed wire in front of the block of flats, and be sure to come before 6pm, because heavy iron gates seal it off at night in an effort to deter vandals.\n\nHere, truly, they would see how the other half lives. People who spend their life hacking away in the rough, and rarely catch sight of the fairway.\n\nThe Ryder Cup begins on Oct 1. For full coverage go to guardian.co.uk/sport"
