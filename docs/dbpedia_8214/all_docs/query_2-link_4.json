        "text": "Michael Sheen is a Welsh actor and started his career as a theatre artist. He rose to fame in the 2000s as a screen actor after working in various biographical films. He starred in television films like The Deal, The Queen and The Special Relationship. Some of his notable films are The Twilight Saga: New Moon and Midnight in Paris.\n\nWelsh actor, Desmond Llewelyn, is best known for his role as Q in many James Bond films over a span of four decades. Even though he originally wanted to be a minister, his interest shifted to acting while in high school. He served in the army during World War II and resumed his acting career afterward.\n\nInitially aspiring to be a classical singer, Aimee-Ffion Edwards had her first stint with showbiz on the show Wawffactor. As a teenager, she was the only girl in a rugby team. She is equally at ease playing a working-class mother in The Left Behind and a gypsy in Peaky Blinders.\n\nPeter Greenaway is a Welsh artist, film director, and screenwriter. He is best known for making films with common traits, such as the contrasts of nature and architecture, costume and nudity, sexual pleasure and painful death, and furniture and people. Some of his best-known films include The Pillow Book and Goltzius and the Pelican Company.\n\nTony Pulis is a Welsh former football player who played for teams like Bristol Rovers, AFC Bournemouth, and Newport County in a career that spanned 17 years. Pulis is better known for his career as a football manager, for which he was made an inductee to the LMA Hall of Fame.\n\nAfter losing his father at age 3, Georgian poet W. H. Davies was raised by his grandparents. He later spent moving from place to place in the US and Canada, taking up odd jobs, and even lost his right foot while trying to jump a freight train.\n\nWelsh-Canadian business tycoon Terry Matthews has been associated with countless companies, such as Mitel and Newbridge Networks, as their co-founder. A telecom and data networking magnate, he made it to the Forbes list of Billionaires 2021. His knighthood created diplomatic issues in Canada, which doesn’t allow acceptance of foreign titles.\n\nBorn to a Canadian physician in Wales, John Savage followed in his father’s footsteps to study medicine. He later gained the name \"hippie doctor\" for his beard and unconventional treatments. He later led the Nova Scotia Liberal Party and also became the Premier of Nova Scotia."
