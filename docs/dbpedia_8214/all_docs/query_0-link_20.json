(R. Chapman & Sons) had loaded with a cargo of pig iron at Philadephia for Hull and sailed to Sydney, Cape Breton where the ship joined up with the 40 ship Convoy SC-25 which left Halifax, Nova Scotia on 10th March 1941. During the crossing two ships were forced to return due to bad weather and the Koranton found herself straggling the main convoy and was soon sailing alone and vulnerable and was last sighted on 24th March.\n\nAfter failing to arrive the ship was recorded in May 1941as missing/untraced and a Joint Arbitration Committee considered the loss 40% Marine Cause, 60% War Cause around the 28th March.\n\nThe ship had actually been intercepted by U-98 South West of Reykjavik and hit in the stern by a single torpedo and sank almost immediately before any distress message could be sent taking all thirty four men with her in approximate position 50 00N 27 00W\n\nBarnes, William Leslie, 26, 8th June 1940, Royal Navy, H.M.S.

The centre of the bombing was right across the Krupps factory just west of the city centre with creep back extending into the north-western outskirts. Photo interpretation assessed that Krupps received 30% more damage this night than on the successful raid of 5/6th March. Nearly 500 houses were destroyed and the number of dead has been reported as between 169 and 322, although 198 is the most probable figure. German records say that 1/3rd of the bombs dropped were outside Essen, but hit other, overlapping towns such as Bottrop (just north of Essen), where 39 people were killed. These other towns were so close to the target that there was very little division between them.\n\nBessell, Henry Thomas, 18th April 1940, Royal Navy, H.M.
