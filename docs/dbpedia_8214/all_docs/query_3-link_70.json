        "text": "A curving mile-long, west-facing, Blue Flag, sandy beach – widely considered to be one of the best in the country. Whitesands is sheltered by Ramsey Island and is perfect for surfers or paddlers alike. At very low tide the remains of an ancient forest can be seen, consisting of stumps of birch, fir, hazel and oak trees. Parking is adjacent to the beach and lifeguards are on duty during the summer months.\n\nCarn Llidi\n\nFor fantastic views, sure-footed walkers can head for the summit of Carn Llidi (595ft; 181m) – one of the finest hills in Pembrokeshire. From here you can see the full curve of the sweeping Pembrokeshire coastline and on a clear day, the Wicklow Hills in Ireland. As you approach the hill, take time to visit the 5000 year-old burial chamber of Coetan Arthur, with an 8ft capstone and supports."
