        "text": "Main Births etc\n\nNewport ( /ˈnjuːpɔːrt/; Welsh: Casnewydd) is a cathedral and university city and unitary authority area in south east Wales. It is located on the River Usk close to its confluence with the Severn estuary, approximately 12 miles (19 km) northeast of Cardiff. At the 2011 census it is the third largest city in Wales, with a city population of 145,700[1] and an urban population of 306,844. The city forms part of the Cardiff-Newport metropolitan area with a population of 1,097,000.\n\nNewport has been a port since medieval times, when Newport Castle was built by the Normans. The town outgrew the earlier Roman town of Caerleon, immediately upstream, and gained its first charter in 1314. It grew significantly in the 19th century, when its port became the focus of coal exports from the eastern valleys of South Wales. Until the rise of Cardiff from the 1850s, Newport was Wales' largest coal-exporting port. It was the site of the last large-scale armed insurrection in Britain, the Newport Rising of 1839 led by the Chartists.\n\nDuring the 20th century, when the docks declined in importance, Newport remained an important manufacturing and engineering centre. It was granted city status in 2002. Newport hosted the Ryder Cup in 2010. The city was the venue of the 2014 NATO summit.[2]\n\nIt is the largest urban area within the historic county boundaries of Monmouthshire and the preserved county of Gwent. The City of Newport, which includes some surrounding rural areas as well as the built up area, is governed by Newport City Council.\n\nHistory[]\n\nSee also: Category:History of Newport, Wales\n\nOrigins[]\n\nBronze Age fishermen settled around the fertile estuary of the River Usk and later the Celtic Silures built hillforts overlooking it. In AD 75, on the very edge of their empire, the Roman legions built a Roman fort at Caerleon to defend the river crossing. According to legend, in the late 5th century Saint Woolos church was founded by Saint Gwynllyw, the patron saint of Newport and King of Gwynllwg. The church was certainly in existence by the 9th century and today has become Newport Cathedral, the seat of the Bishop of Monmouth. The Normans arrived from around 1088–1093 to build Newport Castle and river crossing downstream and the first Norman Lord of Newport was Robert Fitzhamon.\n\nThe settlement of 'Newport' is first mentioned as novo burgus established by Robert, Earl of Gloucester in 1126.[3] The name was derived from the original Latin name Novus Burgus, meaning new borough or new town. The city can sometimes be found labelled as Newport-on-Usk on old maps.[4] The original Welsh language name for the city, Casnewydd-ar-Wysg (pronounced [kasˈnɛwɪð ar ˈwɪsk]) means 'New castle-on-Usk' (this is a shortened version of Castell Newydd ar Wysg) and this refers to the twelfth-century castle ruins near Newport city centre. The original Newport Castle was a small motte-and-bailey castle in the park opposite Newport Cathedral. It was buried in rubble excavated from the Hillfield railway tunnels that were dug under Stow Hill in the 1840s and no part of it is currently visible.[5]\n\nAround the settlement, the new town grew to become Newport, obtaining its first charter in 1314[6] and was granted a second one, by Hugh Stafford, 2nd Earl of Stafford in 1385. In the 14th century friars came to Newport where they built an isolation hospital for infectious diseases. After its closure the hospital lived on in the place name \"Spitty Fields\" (a corruption of ysbyty, the Welsh for hospital).[7] \"Austin Friars\" also remains a street name in the city.\n\nDuring the Welsh Revolt in 1402 Rhys Gethin, General for Owain Glyndŵr, forcibly took Newport Castle together with those at Cardiff, Llandaff, Abergavenny, Caerphilly, Caerleon and Usk.[8] During the raid the town of Newport was badly burned and Saint Woolos church destroyed.\n\nA third charter, establishing the right of the town to run its own market and commerce came from Humphrey Stafford, 1st Duke of Buckingham in 1426. By 1521, Newport was described as having \"....a good haven coming into it, well occupied with small crays [merchant ships] where a very great ship may resort and have good harbour.\" Trade was thriving with the nearby ports of Bristol and Bridgwater and industries included leather tanning, soap making and starch making.[7] The town's craftsmen included bakers, butchers, brewers, carpenters and blacksmiths. A further charter was granted by James I in 1623.\n\nDuring the English Civil War in 1648 Oliver Cromwell's troops camped overnight on Christchurch Hill overlooking the town before their attack on the castle the next day. A cannonball dug up from a garden in nearby Summerhill Avenue, dating from this time, now rests in Newport Museum.[9]\n\nIndustrial Revolution[]\n\nAs the Industrial Revolution took off in Britain in the 19th century, the South Wales Valleys became key suppliers of coal from the South Wales coalfield, and iron. These were transported down local rivers and the new canals to ports such as Newport, and Newport Docks grew rapidly as a result. Newport became one of the largest towns in Wales and the focus for the new industrial eastern valleys of South Wales. By 1830 Newport was Wales' leading coal port, and until the 1850s it was larger than Cardiff.[3]\n\nThe Newport Rising in 1839 was the last large-scale armed rebellion against authority in mainland Britain. John Frost and 3,000 other Chartists marched on the Westgate Hotel at the centre of the town. The march was met with an attack by militia, called to the town by the Mayor, Thomas Phillips: at least 20 marchers were killed and were later buried in Saint Woolos churchyard. John Frost was sentenced to death for treason, but this was later commuted to transportation to Australia. He returned to Britain (but not to Newport) later in his life. John Frost Square (1977), in the centre of the city, is named in his honour.\n\nNewport probably had a Welsh-speaking majority until the 1830s, but with a large influx of migrants from England and Ireland over the following decades, the town and the rest of Monmouthshire came to be seen as \"un-Welsh\", a view compounded by ambiguity about the status of Monmouthshire.[3] In the 19th century, the St George Society of Newport (a group largely consisting of English settlers and businessmen) asserted that the town was part of England. It was at a meeting in Newport, attended by future Prime Minister David Lloyd George, that the Cymru Fydd movement received its death blow in 1896 when politician Robert Bird stated “You will find, from Swansea to Newport, a cosmopolitan population who will not submit to the domination of Welsh ideas!”.[3] In 1922 Lloyd George was to suffer a further blow in Newport, when the South Wales Liberal Federation, led by David Alfred Thomas, an industrialist and Liberal politician, and Robert Bird moved that Lloyd George \"be not heard\" in the 1895 General Election. The Conservative capture of the recently created Newport constituency in a by-election in 1922 was one of the causes of the fall of his coalition government.[3]\n\nThe late 19th and early 20th century period was a boom time for Newport. The Alexandra Docks opened in 1875. The population was expanding rapidly and the town became a county borough in 1891.[3] In 1892 the Alexandra South Dock was opened and was the largest masonry dock in the world.[3] Although coal exports from Newport were by now modest compared to the Port of Cardiff (which included Cardiff, Penarth and Barry), Newport was the place where the Miners' Federation of Great Britain was founded in 1889, and international trade was sufficiently large for 8 consuls and 14 vice-consuls to be based in the town.[3] In 1898 Lysaght's Orb Works opened and by 1901 employed 3,000 staff. Urban expansion took in Pillgwenlly and Lliswerry to the south; this eventually necessitated a new crossing of the River Usk, which was provided by the Newport Transporter Bridge completed in 1906, described as \"Newport's greatest treasure\".[3]\n\nFurther extensions to the South Dock were opened in 1907 and 1914. The Newport Docks Disaster occurred on 2 July 1909 when, during construction of the new south lock connecting the South Dock to the Severn Estuary, supporting timbers in an excavation trench collapsed and buried 46 workers. The rescuers included 12-year-old paper boy Thomas ‘Toya’ Lewis who was small enough to crawl into the collapsed trench. Lewis worked for two hours with hammer and chisel in an attempt to free one of those trapped who was released the next day. Several hundred pounds was later raised through public subscription in gratitude for the boy's efforts, and he was sent on an engineering scholarship to Scotland. Lewis was awarded the Albert Medal for Lifesaving by King Edward VII in December 1909. A Wetherspoons pub in the city centre is named \"The Tom Toya Lewis\" after the young hero.[10] The building in which the pub is housed was formerly the Newport YMCA, the Foundation Stone for which was laid by Viscount Tredegar, also in 1909.[11]\n\nFrom 1893 the town was served by the paddle steamers of P & A Campbell Ltd. (the \"White Funnel Line\"), which was based in Bristol. The company had been originally set up, by the Scottish brothers Alex and Peter Campbell, on the River Clyde, but was re-located to the Severn Estuary. Departing steamers would face south on Davis Wharf, with the Art College to its left and the town bridge behind. The boats gave rise to the name of the short street which led to the quayside - Screwpacket Road. By 1955 steamers had stopped calling at Newport and P&A Campbell went in to receivership in 1959. It was taken over by the firm which would become the Townsend Ferry group.[12]\n\nThe modern era[]\n\nCompared to many Welsh towns, Newport's economy had a broad base, with foundries, engineering works, a cattle market and shops that served much of Monmouthshire.[3] However, the docks were in decline even before the Great Depression, and local unemployment peaked at 34.7% in 1930: high, but not as bad as the levels seen in the mining towns of the South Wales Valleys. Despite the economic conditions, the council re-housed over half the population in the 1920s and 30s.[3] In 1930 the Town Dock was filled in.\n\nThe post-war years saw renewed prosperity, with Saint Woolos Cathedral (now Newport Cathedral) attaining full cathedral status in 1949, the opening of the modern integrated Llanwern steelworks in 1962, and the construction of the Severn Bridge and local sections of the M4 motorway in the late 1960s, making Newport the best-connected place in Wales.[3][13] Although employment at Llanwern steelworks declined in the 1980s, the town acquired a range of new public sector employers, and a Richard Rogers-designed Inmos microprocessor factory helped to establish Newport as being extant for technology companies.[14] A flourishing local music scene in the early 1990s led to claims that the town was \"a new Seattle\".[3][15]\n\nThe county borough of Newport was granted city status in 2002 to mark Queen Elizabeth II's Golden Jubilee.[16] In the same year, an unusually large merchant ship, referred to locally as the Newport Ship, was uncovered and rescued from the west bank of the River Usk during the construction of the Riverfront Arts Centre.

The Local Government Act 1972 removed ambiguity about the legal status of the area by including the administrative county of Monmouthshire and the county borough of Newport into all acts pertaining to Wales, and in 1974 the borough was incorporated into the new local government county of Gwent. Gwent itself was abolished in 1996 but remains in use for ceremonial functions as a preserved county.\n\nPolitics[]\n\nSee also Category:Politics of Newport, Wales\n\nThe city is historically industrialised with a large working-class population[3] and a strong support for the Labour Party.\n\nLabour lost control of Newport City council in the 2008 local elections to a Conservative/Liberal Democrat coalition but the Labour Party regained an overall majority of councillors in the 2012 election.\n\nThe City of Newport is divided between the UK Parliamentary constituencies of Newport West and Newport East and elects one Member of Parliament (MP) in each constituency. The two constituencies cover a similar area to that of the city area controlled by Newport City Council. The city formerly had only one constituency until 1983 when the city was split into Newport West and Newport East due to population growth. In the United Kingdom general election, 2015, Labour held Newport West with a reduced majority of 3,510 votes over the Conservative Party. The Labour Party also held Newport East with an increased majority of 4,705 votes over the Conservative Party.\n\nIn the National Assembly of Wales Newport is divided into Newport West and Newport East constituencies and elects one Assembly Minister (AM) in each constituency. In the National Assembly for Wales election, 2016, Labour held Newport West with a reduced majority of 4,115 votes over the Conservative Party. The Labour Party also held Newport East with a reduced majority of 4,896 votes over UKIP.\n\nNewport is part of the Wales European Parliament Constituency. The Wales constituency elects four Members of the European Parliament (MEP). In the 2014 European Parliament election the Wales constituency elected one MEP from each of the Labour, UKIP, Conservative, and Plaid Cymru parties.\n\nPosition Current Representatives Members of Parliament Newport West: Paul Flynn, Labour, first elected 1987 · Newport East: Jessica Morden, Labour, first elected 2005 Members of the National Assembly for Wales Newport West: Jayne Bryant, Labour, first elected 2016 · Newport East: John Griffiths, Labour, first elected 1999 Members of the European Parliament Wales (European Parliament constituency):\n\nDerek Vaughan, Labour, first elected 2009 · Nathan Gill, UKIP, first elected 2014 · Kay Swinburne, Conservative, first elected 2009 · Jill Evans, Plaid Cymru, first elected 1999 Newport City Council Members See Newport City Council main article Police and Crime Commissioner Gwent Police: Ian Johnston, Independent, first elected 2012\n\nCoat of arms[]\n\nMain article: Coat of arms of Newport\n\nThe official blazon of the armorial bearings is: \"(arms) Or, a chevron reversed gules, the shield ensigned by a cherub proper. Supporters: on the dexter side a winged sea lion Or, and on the sinister side a sea dragon gules, the nether parts of both proper, finned gold.\"\n\nFreedom of the City[]\n\nThe title of Freedom of Newport is a ceremonial honour, given by the Newport council to those who have served in some exceptional capacity, or upon any whom Newport wishes to bestow an honour. There have been 17 individuals or organisations that have received the honour since 1909,[18] including:\n\nRt. Hon. Godfrey Charles Morgan, 1st Viscount Tredegar, Lord Lieutenant of Monmouthshire\n\nBernard Montgomery, 1st Viscount Montgomery of Alamein (1945) [19]\n\nCorps of the South Wales Borderers (24th Foot)\n\nRoyal Regiment of Wales (24th/41st Foot)\n\n104th Regiment Royal Artillery (Volunteers)\n\nRoyal Welch Fusiliers (2001) [20]\n\nBritish Merchant Navy Association\n\nHMS Severn (2006) [21]\n\nNewport County A.F.C. (2013) [18]\n\nNewport R.F.C. (2013)[22]\n\nGeography[]\n\nNewport is located 138 miles (222 km) west of London and 12 miles (19 km) east of Cardiff. It is the largest urban area within the historic county boundaries of Monmouthshire and the preserved county of Gwent. The City of Newport, which includes rural areas as well as the built up area, is the seventh most populous unitary authority in Wales.\n\nThe city is largely low-lying, but with a few hilly areas. (Wentwood reaches 310 metres above sea level). Areas in the south and east of the city tend to be flat and fertile with some housing estates and industrial areas reclaimed from marshland. Areas near the banks of the River Usk, such as Caerleon, are also low-lying. The eastern outskirts of the city are characterised by the gently rolling hills of the Vale of Usk and Christchurch has panoramic views of the Vale of Usk and the Bristol Channel. Ridgeway at Allt-yr-yn also has good views of the surrounding areas and Bristol Channel. Brynglas has views over the city centre and Twmbarlwm to the west. The suburbs of the city have grown outwards from the inner-city, mostly near the main roads, giving the suburban sprawl of the city an irregular shape. The urban area is continuing to expand rapidly with new housing estates continuing to be built.\n\nThe city boundaries include a number of villages in the Newport Built-up area.\n\nWards and districts[]\n\nSee also Category:Districts of Newport, Wales\n\nThe city is divided into 20 wards. Most of these wards are coterminous with communities (parishes) of the same name. Each community can have an elected council. The following table lists city council wards, communities and associated geographical areas. Communities with a community council are indicated with a '*':\n\nWard Communities (Parishes) Communities Allt-yr-yn Allt-yr-yn Ridgeway, Barrack Hill, Glasllwch, Gold Tops Alway Alway Somerton, Lawrence Hill Beechwood Beechwood Eveswell Bettws Bettws Caerleon Caerleon Christchurch, Bulmore Gaer Gaer Maesglas, Stelvio, St. Davids, Gaer Park Graig Graig* Rhiwderin, Bassaleg, Lower Machen, Pentre Poeth, Fox Hill Langstone Langstone*, Llanvaches*, Penhow* Llanmartin, Parc Seymour, Wentwood Forest, Coed-y-caerau, Cat's Ash, Kemys, Coldra, Llanbedr Llanwern Bishton, Glan Llyn, Goldcliff*, Llanwern*, Redwick* Underwood, Whitson, Uskmouth, Summerleaze, Wilcrick, Saltmarsh, Milton, Porton Lliswerry Lliswerry, Nash* Broadmead Park, Moorland Park, Broadstreet Common Malpas Malpas Hollybush Marshfield Coedkernew*, Marshfield*, Michaelstone-y-Fedw*, Wentlooge* Castleton, St. Brides, Blacktown, Peterstone Pillgwenlly Pillgwenlly Level of Mendalgief Ringland Ringland Bishpool, Treberth, Coldra Rogerstone Rogerstone* High Cross, Cefn Wood, Croesllanfro, Mount Pleasant Shaftesbury Shaftesbury Brynglas, Crindau, Marshes, Blaen-y-pant St. Julian's St. Julian's Riverside, Barnardtown Stow Hill Stow Hill St. Woolos, Baneswell, City centre Tredegar Park Tredegar Park Duffryn Victoria Victoria Maindee, Summerhill\n\nClimate[]\n\nNewport has a moderate temperate climate, with the weather rarely staying the same for more than a few days at a time. The city is one of the sunnier locations in Wales and its sheltered location tends to protect it from extreme weather. Like the whole of the British Isles, Newport benefits from the warming effect of the Gulf Stream. Newport has mild summers and cool winters.[23][24][25][26][27]\n\nThunderstorms may occur intermittently at any time of year, but are most common throughout late-spring and summer. Rain falls throughout the year, Atlantic storms give significant rainfall in the autumn, these gradually becoming rarer towards the end of winter. Autumn and summer have often been the wettest seasons in recent times. Snow falls every winter and usually settles on the ground several times, and usually melts after a few days. Newport records few days with gales compared to most of Wales, again due to its sheltered location. Frosts are common from October to May.\n\nOn 20 March 1930, the overnight temperature fell to −16.1 °C (3.0 °F) the coldest temperature for the whole of the UK during that year, and the latest date in spring the UK's lowest temperature has been recorded.[28]\n\nDemography[]\n\nYear Population 1801 6,657 1851 29,238 1881 48,069 1901 79,342 1941 116,434 1981 131,016 2001 137,017 2006 est.\n\nPeople from Newport are known as Newportonians. In the 2011 census, 89.9% described themselves as White, 5.5% Asian, 1.7% Black, 1.1% Mixed White/Black, 0.5% Mixed White/Asian and 1.4% as other ethnic groups.[29]\n\nReligion[]\n\nIn 1929 St Woolos Church became the Pro-Cathedral of the Diocese of Monmouth, becoming a full cathedral in 1949. When Rowan Williams was appointed Archbishop of Wales in 2000, the Cathedral became the Metropolitan Cathedral of Wales.[30] In 1850 Newport was recognised as the chief centre of Roman Catholicism in Wales when the town became the seat of the Bishop of Newport and Menevia; however Newport lost its bishop with the creation of the Archdiocese of Cardiff in 1916.[3] Between 21 October 1966 and 6 October 1969, having retired as Bishop of Rochester, New York, Fulton J. Sheen, an American bishop who pioneered preaching on television and radio, was appointed the titular archbishop of Newport by Pope Paul VI.\n\nIn the 2011 census 56.8% of Newport residents considered themselves Christian, 4.7% Muslim, 1.2% Other religions (including Hindu, Buddhist, Sikh, Jewish and Others), 29.7% were non-religious and 7.5% chose not to answer the non-compulsory religion question on the census.[31] By 2014 the city's Jewish community had reduced to only six members, placing it among the smallest in the UK.[32]\n\nNewport has more than 50 churches[33] (including Welsh, Chinese and Urdu speaking services), 7 mosques,[34] and one synagogue;[35] the nearest Gurudwara[36] is in Cardiff.\n\nThe church of St Julian and St Aaron, at St Julian's, was consecrated in 1926.[37][38]\n\nEconomy[]\n\nNewport's Travel to Work Area incorporates much of south Monmouthshire; the new 2001-based area also includes Cwmbran.[39] The city itself has three major centres for employment: the city centre, and business parks clustered around the M4 motorway junctions 24 in the east and 28 in the west.\n\nOrganisations based in the city include Airbus Defence & Space; the headquarters of the Office for National Statistics;[40] the headquarters of the United Kingdom Intellectual Property Office (formerly known as the Patent Office); the General Insurance Division of Lloyds TSB; a large Panasonic manufacturing plant; a manufacturing plant for International Rectifier; the headquarters of insurance comparison site Gocompare; the headquarters of Wales and West Utilities; the shared-service centre for HM Prison Service; the Passport Office for much of the south and west of the UK; and the Wales headquarters of the Charity Commission and British Red Cross. In 2014 Admiral Insurance opened a large newly constructed office opposite Newport railway station.\n\nIn 1997, Newport secured what was then thought to be Europe's largest-ever inward investment when the LG Group announced a £1.7 billion project creating 6,100 jobs, and supported by public sector grants.[41] Facilities were built on the Celtic Lakes business and science park, but market conditions led to the semiconductor plant never opening, and the CRT plant eventually closed in 2003.[42] In 2005 Irish radiator manufacturer Quinn Group bought the former LG Phillips building, which became its European base.[43]\n\nIndustry in the east of Newport was formerly based at the Corus Llanwern steelworks, and although the rolling mill is still active, steel manufacture ceased in 2001. Permission has been granted to transform the 600-acre (2.4 km2) former steelworks site into a £1bn mixed-use development comprising housing, office and industrial space, public open space and a range of community facilities.[44]\n\nAt the mouth of the River Usk, the Sims Metal Management plant hosts the world's largest industrial shredder for scrap metal with access by road, rail and sea.[45][46][47][48] The plant, which is also the world's largest car crusher which was featured in the TV series 'How do they do it'.[49]\n\nNewport Cattle Market, in the Pillgwenlly area of the city, closed in 2009 and was demolished to make way for a new supermarket.\n\nRegeneration[]\n\nThe city has seen major regeneration projects being undertaken since 2004.\n\nInfrastructure[]\n\nThe first stage of regeneration involved improving the city centre road network, including turning Kingsway and Queensway into boulevards. The Southern Distributor Road to the south of the city opened in 2004, including the new City Bridge over the River Usk, improving access and opening up new areas for development. The Newport City footbridge opened in 2006 linking the east and west banks of the river for pedestrians and cyclists.\n\nNewport railway station was redeveloped with the lengthened Platform 4 of the railway station opening in July 2007 and a new terminal building opened in 2010 with a futuristic design. The railway station's reconnection with the Ebbw Valley Railway was due to be completed by 2011 but was delayed. There are plans to reopen many suburban stations in the near future – as part of phase one of the Ebbw Valley reopening, Rogerstone station was re-opened in 2008. Pye Corner station re-opened in 2014 and three others are planned in the city's Unitary Development Plan.[50] Newport bus station was also redeveloped.[51]\n\nA state-of-the-art District General Hospital is envisaged to be built to replace the Royal Gwent Hospital. The former Corus steel Whiteheads site was speculated but this was rejected in favour of redeveloping the Llanfrechfa Grange Hospital site, near Cwmbran as a specialist and critical care unit.\n\nThe M4 relief road skirting the southern edge of the urban area of Newport is proposed as a means of reducing the congestion on the existing M4 motorway (presently squeezed through the Brynglas Tunnels) and making Newport and the surrounding areas more accessible. There have also been calls for a barrage across the River Usk to be incorporated with the M4 bypass, so that the level of the river would stay permanently at high tide level, although possible plans for a Severn barrage across the River Severn would reduce the need for a River Usk barrage. The relief road scheme was cancelled in July 2009 but relaunched in 2014.[52]\n\nLeisure[]\n\nThe Riverfront Arts Centre was the first structure to be built as part of Newport's regeneration by Newport City Council in 2004. It stands on Kingsway Boulevard on the west bank of the River Usk. On the east bank, Rodney Parade is being redeveloped as a sports and entertainment complex and it is home to Newport Gwent Dragons, Newport RFC rugby union teams and Newport County football team\n\nResidential[]\n\nAs part of the city's master plan, the city centre is currently being expanded to take in areas of the River Usk east bank. The area of land between Newport Bridge and George Street Bridge is being developed as a £43 million high-density combined commercial and residential area, joined to the west bank by the new footbridge. The plan is designed to show a strong urban form along the river front, emphasised with tall landmark buildings[53] The first phase will be known as City Vizion.[54]\n\nAdjacent to the University campus on the west bank is the site of a potential development called \"The Edge\". This was to feature 227 apartments, including a 21-storey tower containing duplex apartments and penthouses. However, this development did not take place due to financial problems for the developer. The prime development site is now thought to be in the control of a bank and is likely to be brought forward for development in the future.[55] Further south is the \"Newhaus\" development of 154 riverside apartments.[56] At the southern end of the site, the \"Alexandra Gate\" development will eventually see 300 homes and riverside apartments built adjacent to the City Bridge.[57]\n\nIn east Newport, land released from the Corus steelworks at Llanwern is being redeveloped as 4,000 houses, shops and other facilities.[58]\n\nCommercial[]\n\nDue to the late-2000s recession, some major redevelopment projects were cancelled. A £210 million city centre shopping complex known as Friars Walk including a Debenhams department store and a multiplex cinema was planned to be created in time for the 2010 Ryder Cup in Newport, but was scrapped in 2009.[59] In December 2010 the Friars Walk scheme was relaunched[60] and in April 2012 a completion date of 2015 was announced with Debenhams again being the flagship store.[61] Newport Council lent the developers £90m to ensure the centre opened on time.[62] It opened in November 2015.[62] As well as 30 new shops there is a dozen restaurants and an eight-screen Cineworld multiplex cinema.[62] City Spires on the Cambrian Centre site would have included a 30-storey block of 238 apartments, 101 metres (331 ft) tall, a 10-storey office block and a four-star hotel. The plan was mothballed in 2008.[63][64] An alternative redevelopment plan for Cambrian Centre started in 2012.[65]\n\nTransport[]\n\nSee also Category:Transport in Newport, Wales\n\nThe M4 motorway comes within a mile (1.6 km) of the city centre, and Newport can be accessed from six junctions (from 24–28 inclusive). The Great Western main railway line also passes through the heart of the city, stopping at Newport railway station. Newport is well linked with nearby Cardiff, with approximately six rail and five bus services between the cities every hour.[66]\n\nRoad[]\n\nM4 Motorway[]\n\nThe main west—east road is the M4 motorway.\n\nThe junctions within the city are:\n\n24: Coldra A449/A48/B4237\n\n25: Caerleon Road B4596\n\n25A: Grove Park A4042\n\n26: Malpas Road A4051\n\n27: High Cross, B4591\n\n28: Tredegar Park A48/A4072 (A467/A468)\n\n29: St Mellons A48(M) — no access from local roads\n\nAdditionally junction 23A lies just outside the city boundaries and provides local access via the A4810 and B4245.\n\nThe Brynglas Tunnels on the M4 are a cause of traffic delays as the motorway narrows to two lanes in each direction between junctions 25 and 26 to pass through the tunnels. Partly due to regular tailbacks at the tunnels a variable speed limit is in place between junctions 24 and 28.\n\nPrincipal roads[]\n\nOther major west-east A roads are:\n\nAs an alternative to the busy M4 motorway through Newport, the Southern Distributor Road (A48) is a two-lane dual carriageway connecting M4 junction 24 to junction 28. Combined with the M4 in the north, the SDR forms the southern part of a ring road for the city.\n\nThe A48 westbound (Cardiff Road) is as an alternative route from Newport to Cardiff.\n\nThe A48 eastbound (Chepstow Road) is as an alternative route from Newport to Chepstow, South West England (via the Severn Bridge), the Wye Valley and Gloucestershire.\n\nThe A4072 (Forge Road) from M4 junction 28 connects Newport via the A468 to Machen and Caerphilly.\n\nThe A4810 (Queen's Way) connects the SDR at Lee Way to the M4 at junction 23A through the Llanwern Steelworks.\n\nThe main north-south A roads are:\n\nThe A449 connects Newport to Usk and the English Midlands via M4 junction 24.\n\nThe A4042 connects Newport to Cwmbran, Pontypool and Abergavenny via M4 junction 25A.\n\nThe A4051 (Malpas Road) connects Newport to Cwmbran via M4 junction 26.\n\nThe A4072 (Forge Road) from M4 junction 28 connects Newport via the A467 to Risca and the towns of the Sirhowy Valley, Ebbw Valley and Rhymney Valley.\n\nThe main B roads are:\n\nThe B4237 (former A48) connects M4 junction 24 to junction 28 (Chepstow Road, Wharf Road, crossing George Street Bridge onto George Street and then Cardiff Road).\n\nThe B4596 (Caerleon Road, former A449) links central Newport to Caerleon via M4 Junction 25.\n\nThe B4591 (Risca Road/High Cross Road, former A467) is an alternative route from Newport to Risca via M4 Junction 27 (High Cross) and Rogerstone.\n\nThe B4245 (Magor Road) at Langstone connects Newport to Underwood, Magor and Caldicot.\n\nThe B4239 (Lighthouse Road) at Duffryn connects Newport to Rumney, Cardiff.\n\nCity centre[]\n\nThe Old Green Interchange is an elevated roundabout over the A4042 (Heidenheim Drive) at the western end of Newport Bridge. Newport's pedestrianised High Street runs southwest from the interchange through Westgate Square to the pedestrianised Commercial Street. Queensway passes Newport railway station and links the Old Green Interchange to Newport Civic Centre via Clytha Park Road. Kingsway/Usk Way is a boulevard on the west bank of the River Usk linking the Old Green Interchange to the Southern Distributor Road at the western end of City Bridge and to Newport Transporter Bridge.\n\nCorporation Road follows the east bank of the River Usk, but with limited views of the river. It links Newport Bridge to George Street Bridge, Newport City Bridge and, via Stephenson Road, Newport Transporter Bridge.\n\nBus[]\n\nBus services are primarily provided by the council-owned Newport Transport under the Newport Bus brand. Other operators include Stagecoach in South Wales, New Adventure Travel and Cardiff Bus. Newport bus station[67] is to be redeveloped. National Express operate cross-country coach services from the city.\n\nRail[]\n\nSee also Railway stations in Newport.\n\nNewport railway station is connected directly to the South Wales Main Line branch of the Great Western Main Line, Welsh Marches Line and Gloucester to Newport Line.\n\nRogerstone railway station on the Ebbw Valley Railway reopened in 2008. Services currently run between Ebbw Vale and Cardiff via Rogerstone. The reconnection of Newport station to the Ebbw Valley Railway via Rogerstone station is under consideration, but no decision will be made until at least 2011.[68]\n\nThe services calling at Newport are:\n\nFirst Great Western\n\nLondon Paddington – Reading – Bristol Parkway – Newport – Cardiff Central (- Bridgend – Port Talbot – Neath – Swansea)\n\nCardiff Central – Newport – Bristol Temple Meads – Bath Spa – Salisbury – Southampton – Portsmouth Harbour\n\nCardiff Central – Newport – Bristol Temple Meads – Weston-super-Mare – Taunton\n\nArriva Trains Wales\n\nManchester Piccadilly – Stockport - Crewe – Shrewsbury – Hereford – Cwmbran – Newport – Cardiff Central (– Bridgend – Port Talbot – Neath – Swansea – Carmarthen – Haverfordwest)\n\nCardiff Central – Newport – Cwmbran – Hereford – Shrewsbury – Wrexham General – Chester – Rhyl – Bangor – Holyhead\n\nMaesteg – Bridgend – Cardiff Central – Newport – Chepstow – Gloucester – Cheltenham Spa\n\nCrossCountry\n\nCardiff Central – Newport – Gloucester – Cheltenham Spa – Birmingham New Street – Nottingham\n\nNewport railway station underwent a £22 million refurbishment programme, completed in time for the Ryder Cup in October 2010. The project introduced a futuristic new passenger terminal and bridge, whilst restoring the 19th-century features of the site. The new complex, west of the old station entrance, includes two terminals, new terminal buildings and a public footbridge, a new passenger footbridge, a new taxi area and short-stay car park, and a 250-space passenger car park.\n\nAir[]\n\nThe nearest airport with scheduled domestic and international flights is Cardiff Airport, 30 miles (48 km) south west of Newport.[69]\n\nIn 2003, a proposal for a new Severnside airport near Newport was rejected by the Department for Transport. The airport would have featured runways on a man-made island in the Severn Estuary.[70]\n\nBridges in Newport[]\n\nNewport has nine public bridges spanning the River Usk, connecting the east and west of the city. From north to south they are: Caerleon Bridge, St. Julian's railway bridge, M4 motorway Usk bridge, Great Western Railway Usk bridge, Newport Bridge, Newport City footbridge, George Street Bridge, City Bridge and Transporter Bridge. In addition, the Twenty Ten Bridge at the Celtic Manor Resort is a footbridge crossing the River Usk north of Caerleon Bridge and open to the public.\n\nTimeline:\n\n1800: First stone Newport Bridge\n\n1806: Caerleon Bridge\n\n1850: South Wales Railway Usk Bridge\n\n1866: Newport Road Bridge widened\n\n1866: St. Julian's railway bridge\n\n1888: Great Western Railway Usk bridge\n\n1906: Transporter Bridge\n\n1911: Great Western Railway Usk bridge widened\n\n1927: Current Newport Bridge\n\n1964: George Street Bridge\n\n1967: M4 motorway Usk bridge\n\n1989: M4 motorway Usk bridge, additional crossings\n\n2004: City Bridge\n\n2006: Newport City footbridge\n\n2010: Twenty Ten Bridge\n\nNotable buildings and structures[]\n\nSee the following categories:\n\nBuildings and structures in Newport, Wales\n\nLandmarks in Newport, Wales\n\nVisitor attractions in Newport, Wales\n\nMany of the landmarks of Newport are in Newport city centre or within a short walking distance of the centre; the Railway station, Bus station, Castle, Westgate Hotel, Market, Museum Art Gallery and Central Library, Cathedral, Transporter Bridge, Newport Bridge, Newport City footbridge, George Street Bridge, City Bridge, University of South Wales, Riverfront Arts Centre, Dolman Theatre, Newport Centre, Civic Centre, Newport Technical Institute (former Art College), Shire Hall, Belle Vue Park, Rodney Parade, Newport Crown Court, Ye Olde Murenger House, St Mark's church, St Paul's church, and Royal Gwent Hospital.\n\nThe city has a number of churches of architectural merit.
