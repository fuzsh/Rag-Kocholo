        "text": "The face of Newport has changed dramatically over the last few years.\n\nWith the creation of Friars Walk and the Riverfront theatre, the city centre is totally different to how it looked even a decade ago.\n\nBut it's not just these massive investments that have made a difference to city's facade - a quick look through the archives and you can see just how much Newport has changed.\n\nAnd to show exactly how much the city has been transformed , we've gone out and recreated some old pictures from our archives, along with some that have come from Newport Museum and Art Gallery.\n\nHere are the pictures, side by side...\n\n1. The old bus station\n\nThis scene has changed dramatically over the last 50 years since the first picture was taken.\n\nNot only has a new bus station been built in front of the market, but the biggest difference is the tram lines which run through the city centre.\n\nThe Newport Corporation had a fleet of 58 trams at its peak, which operated from 1903- 1937.\n\nOn the left, the hangar style brick building is Ansells bottling plant. The big white building behind was Fyffes bananas. Newport Centre now occupies the area just beyond.\n\n2. The Lyceum Theatre\n\nUnfortunately, this architectural beauty is no longer in Newport.\n\nIt was built in 1867, and originally named Victoria Hall Assembly Rooms before a name change in 1897.\n\nThe Lyceum Theatre, pictured here in 1959, hosted a number of famous acts - most not notably Houdini.\n\nIn the days since its demolition the site has been a cinema and it's currently a hotel.\n\n3. Market Arcade\n\nPictured here in May 1967, the city's oldest shopping arcade tells a very different story.\n\nBuilt in 1869, the shop-filled walkway connects the top of High Street to Market Street and the indoor market, and it was originally called Fennell's Arcade.\n\nNow branded Market Arcade, the number of shops has dwindled but it is in the running for a cash boost from the Heritage Lottery Fund .\n\n4. The bank on the corner of Westgate Square.\n\nBack when horse and carriage was the go-to mode of transportation, this is what Westgate Square looked like.\n\nThe building is on the junction of Bridge Street and High Street was the National Provincial Bank in the 1890s and is now NatWest, while today a McDonald's is found to the right of the bank.\n\nA horse \"omnibus\" (bus) can be seen entering High Street from Bridge Street and information from Newport Museum and Art Gallery says that the first omnibus service in Newport was started in 1845, and they were hailed like a modern taxi.\n\n5. The other side of Westgate Square\n\nLooking at Westgate Square again, but this time from another angle - in the direction of Commercial Street with High Street out of view.\n\nIt had been decorated for the coronation of George VI and the famous Westgate Hotel is also pictured.\n\nThe most interesting part of this early image, taken in 1937, is the clock tower in the background. The imposing landmark is the the old Town Hall, which opened in 1885 and was demolished in the 1960s.\n\n6. The Westgate Hotel\n\nIn more recent history, this first image was taken in January 1988.\n\nBack then the Westgate Hotel was flanked by a Benetton and Thornton's chocolate shop.\n\nThe front of the hotel is rumoured to contain a bullet hole from the Chartist riots in 1839, however sources at Newport Museum and Art Gallery quashed that myth, saying that the building was actually rebuilt in the 1880s.\n\n7. The Cardiff Road junction\n\nAn area subject to a recent revamp, this part of the town centre that leads towards Pillgwenlly has changed dramatically.\n\nThe building pictured is the former King William pub, which is now a coffee and waffle house, Coffee First.\n\nFound on the on the junction of Cardiff Road and Commercial Street, Newport, the first picture was taken in 1921.\n\n8. The Transporter Bridge\n\nNot a lot has changed about this scene, with the first image being captured in 1953.\n\nThe Transporter Bridge , which was built in 1906, is arguably Newport's most famous landmark and is one of just eight bridges of its kind in the world that is still in use today.\n\nAnd here's some video footage from the opening ceremony , which was held in 1906.\n\n9. Clarence Place\n\nNewport's Cenotaph in Clarence Place which was funded by public subscription, is pictured here in 1959.\n\nThe foundation stone was laid on Wednesday, April 11, 1923, and the unveiling ceremony took place on Saturday, June 2, 1923.\n\nIn the background of the modern day shot is the large Crown Building, which previously housed the city's tax office before it moved.\n\n10. Newport Bridge/The Old Green Roundabout\n\nThis part of the city has seen some dramatic changes in the years between these photographs.\n\nPictured is Newport bridge, the castle, and the old arts college in the background.\n\nNot only have the buildings been demolished but a serious of subways and a huge roundabout are now in place, offering a newer route into the city centre.\n\nIt's thought the first picture dates back to the late 1950s or early 1960s.\n\n11. Chartist Tower\n\nNewport's tallest building, which has recently been bought by developers , is pictured here in 1969.\n\nThere are currently talks of a hotel being developed on the site.\n\nAlso pictured is Upper Dock Street and Olympia house - the former passport office.\n\n12. Newport Market\n\nThe Victorian market in Newport was built in 1854.\n\nIn the first image, the busy shopping venue is pictured more than 100 years later in 1973, while the modern image shows the Rae Barton's fruit and veg stall and Chilly's sweet shop.\n\nIf you look closely at the back wall of the market, you'll spot the addition of a lift.\n\n13. Junction of Commercial Street and George Street\n\nNot only are they ripping up tram lines on Commercial road in the first image, but a whole building seems to have been demolished on the corner of the junction.\n\nThe last tram ran on September, 5 1937. Pictured, workmen are removing the redundant tracks near the Alma Inn - which is still trading today, using a similarly designed sign - at the junction of Commercial Road and George Street.\n\nAn art installation now stands in the place of the building which has been removed and the middle of the road has become pedestrianised, known by locals as Gilligan's Island.\n\n14. The Stow-away, Stow Hill\n\nBuilt as a chapel during the 19th century, this building has more recently been used as a nightclub.\n\nIn the picture, the venue was in its Stow-away days and since then it became Zanzibar and finally Escapade. It closed in 2010 and the club has been unused since.\n\nNow you'll find street art and graffiti across the front of the building.\n\n15. Commercial Street\n\nPictured in 1962, Newport's Commercial Street is quite different.\n\nMany of the shops have closed and become something else, with Bevans becoming Poundland, shoe shop Lilley & Skinner becoming Waterstones and the Woolworths building now covered by scaffolding.\n\nThe street was much less pedestrianised back then too, with cars on the road, something which only permitted vehicles can do today.\n\n16. High Street\n\nA busy shopping day on High Street in June 1966, the picture takes in the market, shops and Westgate Square in the background.\n\nThe pictures were taken while standing next to the entrance of the Grade II-listed Newport Arcade, which dates back to the 1890s.\n\nIn the modern image, the market's recent rebrand and signage can be seen.\n\n17. Corner of High Street and Thomas Street\n\nThe first image here, taken on the corner of High Street and Thomas Street looks very different.\n\nFor a start, Thomas Street doesn't actually exist anymore. To the left of the older photograph (which is undated) stands the old Post Office. This was built in 1845 and demolished in 1904, so we can safely say the image was taken at some point between those dates.\n\nOn the corner is the Great Western Coffee Tavern."
