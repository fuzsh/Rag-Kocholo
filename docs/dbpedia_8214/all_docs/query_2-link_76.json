        "text": "1. North Walsham - Lauren Hemp\n\nThe Manchester City star, who helped England win the Women's Euros last summer, was born in North Walsham and first played for the local team.\n\nHer face now adorns the wall of the town's Cafe Kitale, after the owner came up with the idea while on a long trip across Europe driving aid to Ukraine.\n\nAs a youngster, Hemp played for North Walsham Town FC before being picked up by Norwich City's academy programme at nine years old.\n\n2. King's Lynn - Roger Taylor\n\nA member of one the most famous rock bands in the world, Queen, Roger Taylor was born at West Norfolk & Lynn Hospital in King's Lynn.\n\nHe said of his time living in Belulah Street: \"The road used to be very quiet. I remember going down to the end of the street and looking into the river.\n\n\"I used to see the odd pike or two. I was constantly warned not to fall in.\"\n\nAfter moving to Cornwall, Taylor would regularly come back to visit his grandmother Annie Hickman who lived in Birchwood Street in King's Lynn's North End.\n\nAs a teenager on visits to King's Lynn he would stay with a friend at the post office in Tennyson Avenue.\n\n3. Great Yarmouth - Jason Statham\n\nA-lister Jason Statham moved to Great Yarmouth with his family when he was young.\n\nA former professional diver, who competed for England in the 1990 Commonwealth Games, Statham went on to star in hit films The Italian Job, The Expendables and the Fast & Furious series.\n\nFor some of his time in Great Yarmouth, Statham lived above a pub on the seafront with former Norwich City player Dion Dublin and his brother Ash.\n\n4. Gorleston - Myleene Klass\n\nMyleene Klass made her name in Hear'Say before finding success on the silver screen as a contestant on I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here!.\n\nThe 45-year-old attended Cliff Park Ormiston Academy, when it was still Cliff Park High School, for part of her secondary school education.\n\nSpeaking at the opening of IntoUniversity's Great Yarmouth learning centre earlier this year, she said: \"Norfolk is in my blood. And it was people from this area who helped me hone my skills. I want to pay it forward now.\"\n\n5. Dereham - Todd Cantwell\n\nTodd Cantwell attended Northgate High School in Dereham from the ages of 11 to 14, with his old headteacher Andy Mason being among his top supporters.\n\nHe joined the Norwich City Academy at under-10 level in 2008.\n\nCantwell has always honoured his roots, with the player handing out presents to locals last December who dubbed him the 'Dereham Santa'.\n\nThe 25-year-old left the Canaries in January and signed for Rangers.\n\n6. Reepham - Sigala\n\nBruce Fielder, known professionally as Sigala, is an English DJ and record producer.\n\nHe was born in Reepham in 1993 and has had eight songs in the top 10 of the UK Singles Chart.\n\nHe attended Reepham High School and Norwich City College before graduating with a BA honours degree in commercial music from the University of Westminster.\n\n7. Cromer - Sir James Dyson\n\nSir James Dyson was born in Cromer in 1947 and attended Gresham's school as a boy, paying tribute to his \"wonderfully empathetic headmaster\" Logie Bruce-Lockhart after his death in 2020.\n\nIn his mid-teens, his mother Mary moved to Cley next the Sea, but Cromer remained Sir James' \"local city\" and he remembers taking part in music competitions at the Pavilion Theatre on the pier.\n\nThe 76-year-old founded a manufacturing empire that spans the globe and, as well as his line of vacuum cleaners, he has been responsible for inventions including the Airblade hand dryer and the Supersonic hair dryer."
