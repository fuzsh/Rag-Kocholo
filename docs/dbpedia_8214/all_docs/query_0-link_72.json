        "text": "Chartists looked to America as the land of the free. Though often disappointed by the reality, it offered for some the chance of a better life – and, for others, a place of refuge when their political activities made their home country too dangerous.\n\nMany of those who went to America eventually returned to the UK. Others made their home there. Of this group, a number went on to play a prominent role in the labour and socialist movements, as organisers, propagandists and fighters. Others took up arms in the American civil war. Still others became prominent in wholly unexpected ways – as the founders of industrial dynasties, detective agencies and even music-hall entertainers.\n\nIn his book British Chartists in America , (Manchester University Press, 1971), Ray Boston identifies a number of different categories into which those Chartists who headed west can be grouped:\n\n* Physical force Chartists on the run from imminent arrest;\n\n* Those who were “persuaded” to emigrate by secret service funding, thus avoiding a trial;\n\n* Left-wing social democrats who left voluntarily after local pressure;\n\n* Moral force Chartists who disliked O’Connorism and were attracted by the liberal constitutions of new American states such as Iowa and Wisconsin;\n\n* “Tired old men” anxious for a rest from the struggle; and\n\n* “Famous English Chartists” taken up briefly by the American radical press who were little more than tourists.\n\nThe book gives a great deal of context for the American exodus, and of what happened to the Chartists who made their way to America. It also mentions some of the sons of prominent Chartists who made a point of mentioning this connection in their writings. The following list is drawn from that book.\n\nNotes on 76 British Chartists (and Chartist children) in America\n\nWilliam Aitken : Born 1814, Dunbar, Scotland, weaver.

The paper for that week contained a copy of the new constitution of Wisconsin, which territory was then making preparations for admission as a State into the American Union. Discussing it, one of the party said. ‘Here is a land where the Charter is already law; where there is plenty of work and good wages for all; whynot go there?’ To me the question sounded logical… Shortly after that I was on board an emigrant ship a-sailing Westward, Ho!”\n\nMatthew Mark Trumbull on his decision to emigrate\n\n“I by no means take your favourable view of the Knights of Labour and similar [American] organisations. In the first place, their puerilities disgust me. Their ‘dignities’ make me feel sea-sick. Vanity and love of notoriety are at the foundation of all these societies and organisations. A lot of fellows want to be Grand this and Grand that: Grand Dictator, Grand Chaplain, Grand Doorkeeper, Grand Pisspot-emptier, Almighty Grand Panjandrum etc etc. A Yankee ‘Sir Knight’ makes me feel that I could — well, not need an emetic! Then my idea of these fellows is that they aim at establishing an Aristocracy of Labour, in fact playing the role of that gang in London who are represented in Parliament by Broadhurst, Howell and Co., well held up by you to scorn.”\n\nGeorge Julian Harney\n\nletter to Frederick Engels,\n\n6 May 1887"
