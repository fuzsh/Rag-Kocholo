        "text": "Wales might be best known for its dramatic mountain ranges and gorgeous rolling countryside, but did you also know that this incredible county has its fair share of celebrities who hail from the region?\n\nWe’re not sure whether it’s the incredible scenery or the fresh air that’s inspired so many creative actors, singers, and designers in Wales – but there’s definitely something providing a source of inspiration here! While many have moved away from the area to set their sights on Hollywood and other glamorous regions across the pond, we’ll bet Wales still holds a special place in the hearts.\n\nWe’ve put together just a list of the most famous Welsh people – from the acting chops of Sir Anthony Hopkins to the talented Tom Jones…\n\nSo, who are our top five famous Welsh people?\n\n1. Dylan Thomas\n\nThe late Dylan Thomas was born in Swansea but he also lived in the Ceredigion area and the latter few years of his life was spent in Laugharne, West Wales. Dylan Thomas’ boathouse in Laugharne is where he wrote Under Milk Wood his most famous piece of work along with other major pieces of his work; the boathouse is set in a cliff overlooking the Taf Estuary and is now owned by Carmarthenshire County Council who restored and opened it to the public as a museum/heritage center.\n\nThe boat house still has most of the original furniture that belonged to Dylan Thomas along with memorabilia. “The writing shed” is very close to the main house and this is where Thomas spent most of his time.\n\n2. Tom Jones\n\nTom Jones the famous Welsh singer was born in Pontypridd, best known for his distinctive voice and charismatic personality. His successful singing career first took off 1964 with hits like “The green green grass of home” and “Delilah”, over 50 years on and he is still going strong.\n\n3. Catherine Zeta Jones\n\nCatherine Zeta Jones was born in Swansea, West Glamorgan. Catherine’s acting career started at a young age playing the daughter of David Jason in her role in the darling buds of May, a popular TV series running in the 1990’s, she has now gone on to be an Oscar-winning Hollywood star and was voted by the Peoples magazine “To be One of the most beautiful people in the World”.\n\n4. Sir Anthony Hopkins\n\nSir Anthony Hopkins is another world-famous actor who was born in Wales in the area of Port Talbot in 1937. He has starred in a string of award-winning film and has himself collected all kinds of awards including Baftas and Emmy awards he also has a star on the walk of fame in Hollywood he has been awarded a CBE and has also been knighted, the list of what he had achieved in his acting career really is endless he is a truly inspirational man.\n\n5. Laura Ashley\n\nLaura Ashley was born in the Welsh town of Merthyr Tydfil in 1925. It’s hard to believe that such a huge enterprise started with Laura and her husband Bernard Ashley making headscarves in the kitchen of their home, while Laura concentrated on the design side of the business Bernard worked on all the printing. Due to the increasing demands for their elegant style and creations from well-known retailers such as John Lewis they went on to open the first Laura Ashley shop which they opened in Machynlleth, Powys and by the 1980’s they had around 5,000 Laura Ashley shops worldwide.\n\nLaura Ashley’s love of Wales is said to be what has inspired her to become one of the best known Welsh designers. Ashley’s children today have a huge involvement in the family’s very successful business.\n\nOur VIP-ready holiday cottages\n\nFancy living like a celebrity for a couple of days?
