        "text": "Dating back thousands of years, Newport has a history to rival any city in the UK. One of the furthest Roman outposts, Newport was established by the Romans in AD74 and they went on to live in the area for another 300 years.\n\nTo the south of the city lies Tredegar House Country Park. A 17th-century mansion owned by the Morgan family - including Captain Morgan behind the world-famous rum - the park includes 90 acres of land, walled gardens, apple orchards and more.\n\nIt’s one of the best preserved Restoration-era houses in the UK. And when the sun is shining, it’s the perfect spot in Newport for a family day out.\n\nCloser to the centre of the city, you’ll find Newport Castle. Now an impressive ruin with the east side of the castle preserved, the castle dates back to the 14th century and was once responsible for protecting the city from the river banks. Part of the civil war effort, the castle has also been used as a tannery and even a brewery during its long history and is now a major local landmark. Check out our hotel in Newport.\n\nThere are plenty of Roman ruins on display in Newport, including the Caerleon amphitheatre, barracks and baths. At its peak, the huge amphitheatre held 6,000 spectators watching gladiators battle it out, while the baths were state of the art for the time, boasting underfloor heating, hot and cold baths and an outdoor swimming pool. The ruins are well preserved and less than a 10-minute drive from our Newport Wales (M4, J24) hotel.\n\nMake sure to check out the adjoining Roman National Museum as well for a fascinating overview of the Roman conquest and to discover some amazing treasures and artefacts.\n\nOne of the oldest buildings in the city is Newport Cathedral, which dates back to the 5th century and has survived attacks by pirates and the Normans during its long history. Initially built as a wooden structure 1,500 years ago, the cathedral was rebuilt in stone during the 9th century, making it one of the most impressive of its era. The building has since endured all manner of attacks and damage, and is still undergoing renovation to fully restore the fabric of the property."
