        "text": "City and county borough in Wales\n\nThis article is about the city and unitary authority. For the town in southwest Wales, see Newport, Pembrokeshire. For other uses, see Newport (disambiguation).\n\nCounty borough and city in Wales\n\nNewport (Welsh: Casnewydd; [kasˈnɛwɨð]) is a city and county borough in Wales, situated on the River Usk close to its confluence with the Severn Estuary, 12 mi (19 km) northeast of Cardiff. The population grew considerably between the 2011 and the 2021 census, rising from 145,700 to 159,587,[3] the largest growth of any unitary authority in Wales. Newport is the third-largest principal authority with city status in Wales, and sixth most populous overall.[4] Newport became a unitary authority in 1996 and forms part of the Cardiff-Newport metropolitan area,[5] and the Cardiff Capital Region.\n\nNewport has been a port since medieval times when the first Newport Castle was built by the Normans. The town outgrew the earlier Roman town of Caerleon, immediately upstream and now part of the city. Newport gained its first charter in 1314. It grew significantly in the 19th century when its port became the focus of coal exports from the eastern South Wales Valleys. Newport was the largest coal exporter in Wales until the rise of Cardiff in the mid-1800s. Newport was the site of the last large-scale armed insurrection in Great Britain, the Newport Rising of 1839.\n\nIn the 20th century, the docks declined in importance, but Newport remained an important centre for manufacturing and engineering. Latterly its economy has been bolstered as part of the M4 corridor high-technology cluster. It was granted city status in 2002. The Celtic Manor Resort in Newport hosted the Ryder Cup in 2010 and was the venue for the 2014 NATO summit. The city contains extensive rural areas surrounding the built-up core. Its villages are of considerable archaeological importance. Newport Cathedral is the seat of the Anglican Bishop of Monmouth and is the cathedral of the Diocese of Monmouth.\n\nEtymology\n\n[edit]\n\nThe original Welsh name for the city was Casnewydd-ar-Wysg (pronounced [kasˈnɛwɪð ar ˈwɪsk]). This is a contraction of the name Castell Newydd ar Wysg, which translates as \"new castle on the Usk\". The Welsh name is recorded in the Brut y Tywysogion when it was visited by Henry II of England sometime around 1172. \"New castle\" suggests a pre-existing fortification in the vicinity and is most likely either to reference the ancient fort on Stow Hill, or a fort that occupied the site of the present castle.[6]\n\nThe English name 'Newport' is a later application. The settlement was first recorded by the Normans as novo burgus in 1126. This Latin name refers to the new borough (or town) established with the Norman castle.[7] The origin of the name Newport and the reason for its wide adoption remains the subject of debate. Newport-on-Usk is found on some early maps, and the name was in popular usage well before the development of Newport Docks.[8] One theory suggests that Newport gained favour with medieval maritime traders on the Usk, as it differentiated the \"New port\" from the \"Old Roman port\" at Caerleon.[9]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nEarly history\n\n[edit]\n\nBronze Age fishermen settled around the fertile estuary of the River Usk and later the Celtic Silures built hillforts overlooking it.[10] In AD 75, on the very edge of their empire, the Roman legions built a Roman fort at Caerleon to defend the river crossing. According to legend, in the late 5th century Saint Gwynllyw (Woolos), the patron saint of Newport and King of Gwynllwg founded the church which would become Newport Cathedral. The church was certainly in existence by the 9th century and today has become the seat of the Bishop of Monmouth. In 1049/50, a fleet of Orkney Vikings, under Welsh king Gruffydd ap Llywelyn, sailed up the Usk and sacked St Gwynllyw's church.[11][12] The church suffered a similar fate in 1063, when Harold Godwinson attacked south Wales.[13][14] The Normans arrived from around 1088–1093 to build the first Newport Castle and river crossing downstream from Caerleon and the first Norman Lord of Newport was Robert Fitzhamon.\n\nThe original Newport Castle was a small motte-and-bailey castle in the park opposite Newport Cathedral. It was buried in rubble excavated from the Hillfield railway tunnels that were dug under Stow Hill in the 1840s and no part of it is currently visible.[15]\n\nNorman invasion and early modern Newport\n\n[edit]\n\nAround the settlement, the new town grew to become Newport, obtaining its first charter in 1314[16] and was granted a second one, by Hugh Stafford, 2nd Earl of Stafford in 1385 (the Newport coat of arms reflects those of the Staffords: theirs was a red chevron - pointing upwards- on a gold field, Newport's is a red chevron reversed - pointing downward - on the same background.) In the 14th century Augustinian friars came to Newport where they built an isolation hospital for infectious diseases. After its closure the hospital lived on in the place name \"Spytty Fields\" (a corruption of ysbyty, the Welsh for hospital).[17] \"Austin Friars\" also remains a street name in the city.\n\nDuring the Last War for Welsh Independence in 1402 Rhys Gethin, General for Owain Glyndŵr, forcibly took Newport Castle together with those at Cardiff, Llandaff, Abergavenny, Caerphilly, Caerleon and Usk.[18] During the raid the town of Newport was badly burned and Saint Woolos church destroyed.\n\nA third charter, establishing the right of the town to run its own market and commerce came from Humphrey Stafford, 1st Duke of Buckingham in 1426. By 1521, Newport was described as having \"....a good haven coming into it, well occupied with small crays [merchant ships] where a very great ship may resort and have good harbour.\" Trade was thriving with the nearby ports of Bristol and Bridgwater and industries included leather tanning, soap making and starch making.[17] The town's craftsmen included bakers, butchers, brewers, carpenters and blacksmiths. A further charter was granted by James I in 1623.\n\nDuring the English Civil War in 1648 Oliver Cromwell's troops camped overnight on Christchurch Hill overlooking the town before their attack on the castle the next day. A cannonball dug up from a garden in nearby Summerhill Avenue, dating from this time, now rests in Newport Museum.[19]\n\nIndustrial Revolution\n\n[edit]\n\nAs the Industrial Revolution transformed Britain in the 19th century, the South Wales Valleys became key suppliers of coal from the South Wales Coalfield, and iron. These were transported down local rivers and the new canals to ports such as Newport, and Newport Docks grew rapidly as a result. Newport became one of the largest towns in Wales and the focus for the new industrial eastern valleys of South Wales. By 1830 Newport was Wales' leading coal port, and until the 1850s it was larger than Cardiff.[7]\n\nThe Newport Rising in 1839 was the last large-scale armed rebellion against authority in mainland Britain. John Frost and 3,000 other Chartists marched on the Westgate Hotel at the centre of the town. The march was met with an attack by militia, called to the town by the Mayor, Thomas Phillips: at least 20 marchers were killed and were later buried in Saint Woolos churchyard. John Frost was sentenced to death for treason, but this was later commuted to transportation to Australia. He returned to Britain (but not to Newport) later in his life. John Frost Square (1977), in the centre of the city, is named in his honour.\n\nNewport probably had a Welsh-speaking majority until the 1830s, but with a large influx of migrants from England and Ireland over the following decades, the town and the rest of Monmouthshire came to be seen as \"un-Welsh\", a view compounded by ambiguity about the status of Monmouthshire.[7] In the 19th century, the St George Society of Newport (a group largely consisting of English settlers and businessmen) asserted that the town was part of England. It was at a meeting in Newport, attended by future Prime Minister David Lloyd George, that the Cymru Fydd movement received its death-blow in 1896 when politician Robert Bird stated: \"You will find, from Swansea to Newport, a cosmopolitan population who will not submit to the domination of Welsh ideas!\".[7] Lloyd George was to suffer a further blow in Newport, when the South Wales Liberal Federation, led by David Alfred Thomas, an industrialist and Liberal politician, and Robert Bird moved that Lloyd George \"be not heard\" in the 1895 General Election. The Conservative capture of the recently created Newport constituency in a by-election in 1922 was one of the causes of the fall of his coalition government.[7]\n\nThe late 19th and early 20th century period was a boom time for Newport. The Alexandra Docks opened in 1875. The population was expanding rapidly and the town became a county borough in 1891.[7] In 1892 the Alexandra South Dock was opened and was the largest masonry dock in the world.[7] Although coal exports from Newport were by now modest compared to the Port of Cardiff (which included Cardiff, Penarth and Barry), Newport was the place where the Miners' Federation of Great Britain was founded in 1889, and international trade was sufficiently large for 8 consuls and 14 vice-consuls to be based in the town.[7] In 1898 Lysaght's Orb Works opened and by 1901 employed 3,000 staff. Urban expansion took in Pillgwenlly and Lliswerry to the south; this eventually necessitated a new crossing of the River Usk, which was provided by the Newport Transporter Bridge completed in 1906, described as \"Newport's greatest treasure\".[7]\n\nFurther extensions to the South Dock were opened in 1907 and 1914. The Newport Docks Disaster occurred on 2 July 1909 when, during the construction of the new south lock connecting the South Dock to the Severn Estuary, supporting timbers in an excavation trench collapsed and buried 46 workers. Rescuers included a 12-year-old paperboy, Thomas 'Toya' Lewis, who was small enough to crawl into the collapsed trench. He worked for two hours trying to free one of the trapped men, who was finally released the next day. A public subscription raised several hundred pounds and Lewis was sent on an engineering scholarship. He was also awarded the Albert Medal for Lifesaving by King Edward VII. Memorials to the dead are in St Mark's Church, close to the centre of the city. A pub in the city centre was named \"The Tom Toya Lewis\" in his honour, but closed in 2021.[20] The building in which the pub was housed was formerly the Newport YMCA, the foundation stone for which was laid by Viscount Tredegar in 1909.[21][22]\n\nFrom 1893 the town was served by the paddle steamers of P & A Campbell Ltd. (the \"White Funnel Line\"), which was based in Bristol. The company had originally been set up by the Scottish brothers Alex and Peter Campbell on the River Clyde, but was re-located to the Severn Estuary. Departing steamers would face south on Davis Wharf, with the Art College to its left and the town bridge behind. The boats gave rise to the name of the short street which led to the quayside – Screwpacket Road. By 1955 steamers had stopped calling at Newport and P & A Campbell went into receivership in 1959. It was taken over by the firm which would become the Townsend Ferry group.[23]\n\nCompared to many Welsh towns, Newport's economy had a broad base, with foundries, engineering works, a cattle market and shops that served much of Monmouthshire.[7] However, the docks were in decline even before the Great Depression, and local unemployment peaked at 34.7% in 1930: high, but not as bad as the levels seen in the mining towns of the South Wales Valleys. Despite the economic conditions, the council re-housed over half the population in the 1920s and 1930s.[7] In 1930 the Town Dock was filled in.\n\nThe post-war years saw renewed prosperity, with Saint Woolos' Cathedral (now Newport Cathedral) attaining full cathedral status in 1949, the opening of the modern integrated Llanwern steelworks in 1962, and the construction of the Severn Bridge and local sections of the M4 motorway in the late 1960s, making Newport the best-connected place in Wales.[7][24] Although employment at Llanwern steelworks declined in the 1980s, the town acquired a range of new public sector employers, and a Richard Rogers–designed Inmos microprocessor factory helped to establish Newport as a centre for technology companies.[25]\n\nA flourishing local music scene in the early 1990s led to claims that the town was \"a new Seattle\".[7][26]\n\nThe county borough of Newport was granted city status in 2002 to mark Queen Elizabeth II's Golden Jubilee.[27] In the same year, an unusually large merchant ship, referred to locally as the Newport Ship, was uncovered and rescued from the west bank of the River Usk during the construction of the Riverfront Arts Centre. The ship has been dated to between 1445 and 1469 and remains the only vessel of its type from this period yet discovered anywhere in the world.[citation needed]\n\nc. 1075: Norman wood motte and bailey castle built on Stow Hill.\n\n1314: First town charter.\n\n1327–1386: Newport Castle built.\n\n1385: Second town charter granted by Hugh Stafford, 2nd Earl of Stafford.\n\n1402: Town was taken by the forces of Owain Glyndŵr, rebel Prince of Wales during the Welsh Revolt: Saint Woolos Church destroyed.\n\n1426: Third town charter granted by Humphrey Stafford, 1st Duke of Buckingham.\n\n1648: Town was taken by the forces of Oliver Cromwell during the English Civil War.\n\n1672: Tredegar House completed.\n\n1796: Opening of the Monmouthshire Canal.\n\n1839: Chartist Newport Rising, Westgate Hotel, Newport led by radical former mayor John Frost.\n\n1842: Newport Town Dock opens – floating dock able to accommodate the largest ships in the world.\n\n1858: Town Dock extended to the north.\n\n1867: Lower Dock Street drill hall completed.[28]\n\n1871: W.

The Local Government Act 1972 removed ambiguity about the legal status of the area by including the administrative county of Monmouthshire and the county borough of Newport into all acts pertaining to Wales. In 1974, the borough was incorporated into the new local government county of Gwent until Newport became a unitary authority again in 1996. Gwent remains in use for ceremonial functions as a preserved county.\n\nNewport was historically industrialised with a large working class population and strong support for the Labour Party.[7]\n\nCouncil\n\n[edit]\n\nNewport City Council consists of 53 elected councillors. The Labour Party won the 2022 Newport City Council election with 35 seats, ahead of the Conservative Party with 7 seats.\n\nThe Labour Party lost control of Newport council in the 2008 local elections to a Conservative/Liberal Democrat coalition but the Labour Party regained an overall majority of councillors in the 2012 election until the present day.\n\nSenedd\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the Senedd (Welsh Parliament), Newport is divided between the Senedd constituencies of Newport East and Newport West and elects one Member of the Senedd (MS) in each constituency. In the 2021 Senedd election, the Labour Party retained both Newport East and Newport West.\n\nIn Senedd elections the Labour Party has held both the Newport East and Newport West constituencies since the constituencies were created in 1999.\n\nUK Parliament\n\n[edit]\n\nIn UK General Elections the City of Newport is in two UK Parliament constituencies. Due to boundary changes the Newport West constituency was renamed Newport West and Islwyn for the 2024 United Kingdom general election. In 2024 the Labour Party won both the expanded Newport East constituency and the new Newport West and Islwyn constituency.[33]\n\nUntil 2024 The City of Newport was divided between the UK Parliament constituencies of Newport East and Newport West and elected one Member of Parliament (MP) in each constituency. The Labour Party held Newport East since constituency boundaries were redrawn in 1983 and held Newport West since 1987.\n\nThe city formerly had only one constituency Newport (Monmouthshire) (UK Parliament constituency) until 1983 when the city was split into Newport East and Newport West due to population growth.\n\nEuropean Parliament\n\n[edit]\n\nPrior to Brexit in 2020, Newport was part of the Wales European Parliament Constituency. The Wales constituency elected four Members of the European Parliament (MEP) on a Proportional representation basis. In the 2019 European Parliament election the Wales constituency elected one MEP from the Labour Party, one from Plaid Cymru and two from the Brexit Party.\n\nElected Representatives\n\n[edit]\n\nPosition Members of Newport City Council 51 Councillors elected 2022\n\nincluding Council Leader: Dimitri Batrouni, Labour Party, appointed Leader in 2024\n\nMembers of the Senedd Newport East: John Griffiths, Labour Party, first elected 1999\n\nNewport West: Jayne Bryant, Labour Party, first elected 2016 Members of UK Parliament\n\nNewport East: Jessica Morden, Labour Party, first elected 2005\n\nNewport West and Islwyn: Ruth Jones, Labour Party, first elected 2019 (Newport West constituency) Gwent Police and Crime Commissioner Gwent Police: Jane Mudd, Labour Party, first elected 2024\n\nCoat of arms\n\n[edit]\n\nThe official blazon of the armorial bearings is: \"(arms) Or, a chevron reversed gules, the shield ensigned by a cherub proper. Supporters: on the dexter side a winged sea lion Or, and on the sinister side a sea dragon gules, the nether parts of both proper, finned gold.\"\n\nFreedom of the City\n\n[edit]\n\nThe title of Freedom of Newport is a ceremonial honour, given by the Newport council to those who have served in some exceptional capacity, or upon any whom Newport wishes to bestow an honour. There have been 17 individuals or organisations that have received the honour since 1909,[34][35] including:\n\nRt. Hon.

(2013)[34]\n\nNewport R.F.C. (2013)[39]\n\nRoyal British Legion (2021)\n\nGeography\n\n[edit]\n\nNewport is located 138 mi (222 km) west of London and 12 mi (19 km) east of Cardiff. It is the largest urban area within the historic county boundaries of Monmouthshire and the preserved county of Gwent. The City of Newport, which includes rural areas as well as the built up area, is the sixth most populous unitary authority in Wales.\n\nThe city is largely low-lying, but with a few hilly areas. Wentwood is 1,014 ft (309 m) above sea level. Areas in the south and east of the city tend to be flat and fertile with some housing estates and industrial areas reclaimed from marshland. Areas near the banks of the River Usk, such as Caerleon, are also low-lying. The eastern outskirts of the city are characterised by the gently rolling hills of the Vale of Usk and Christchurch has panoramic views of the Vale of Usk and the Bristol Channel. Ridgeway at Allt-yr-yn also has good views of the surrounding areas and Bristol Channel. Brynglas has views over the city centre and Twmbarlwm to the west. The suburbs of the city have grown outwards from the inner-city, mostly near the main roads, giving the suburban sprawl of the city an irregular shape. The urban area is continuing to expand rapidly with new housing estates continuing to be built.\n\nThe city boundaries include a number of villages in the Newport Built-up area.\n\nWards and districts\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also Category:Districts of Newport, Wales\n\nThe city is divided into 21 wards. Most of these wards are coterminous with communities (parishes) of the same name. Each community can have an elected council. The following table lists city council wards, communities and associated geographical areas.\n\nWard Communities (Parishes) Other geographic areas Allt-yr-yn Allt-yr-yn Ridgeway, Barrack Hill, Glasllwch, Gold Tops Alway Alway Somerton, Lawrence Hill Beechwood Beechwood Eveswell Bettws Bettws Bishton and Langstone Bishton*, Langstone*, Llanvaches*, Penhow* Llanmartin, Parc Seymour, Wentwood Forest, Coed-y-caerau, Cat's Ash, Llanbedr, Whitebrook Caerleon Caerleon Christchurch, Bulmore, Lodge Hill Gaer Gaer Maesglas, Stelvio, St. Davids, Gaer Park Graig Graig* Rhiwderin, Bassaleg, Lower Machen, Pentre Poeth, Fox Hill Llanwern Llanwern, Goldcliff, Whitson, Redwick Underwood, Whitson, Uskmouth, Summerleaze, Wilcrick, Saltmarsh, Milton, Porton Lliswerry Lliswerry, Nash* Broadmead Park, Moorland Park, Uskmouth, Broadstreet Common Malpas Malpas Hollybush Pillgwenlly Pillgwenlly Level of Mendalgief Ringland Ringland Bishpool, Treberth, Coldra Rogerstone East Rogerstone* High Cross, Cefn Wood, Croesllanfro, Mount Pleasant Rogerstone North Rogerstone West Afon Village Shaftesbury Shaftesbury Brynglas, Crindau, Marshes, Blaen-y-pant St. Julian's St. Julian's Riverside, Barnardtown Stow Hill Stow Hill St. Woolos, Baneswell, City centre Tredegar Park and Marshfield Tredegar Park, Coedkernew*, Marshfield*, Michaelston-y-Fedw*, Wentlooge* Duffryn, Castleton, St. Brides, Blacktown, Peterstone Victoria Victoria Maindee, Summerhill\n\n* communities with a community council.\n\nClimate\n\n[edit]\n\nNewport has a moderate temperate climate, with the weather rarely staying the same for more than a few days at a time. The city is one of the sunnier locations in Wales and its sheltered location tends to protect it from extreme weather. Like the whole of the British Isles, Newport benefits from the warming effect of the Gulf Stream. Newport has mild summers and cool winters.[40][41][42][43][44]\n\nThunderstorms may occur intermittently at any time of year, but are most common throughout late-spring and summer. Rain falls throughout the year, Atlantic storms give significant rainfall in the autumn, these gradually becoming rarer towards the end of winter. Autumn and summer have often been the wettest seasons in recent times. Snow falls in most winters and sometimes settles on the ground, usually melting within a few days. Newport records few days with gales compared to most of Wales, again due to its sheltered location. Frosts are common from October to May.\n\nOn 20 March 1930, the overnight temperature fell to −16.1 °C (3.0 °F) the coldest temperature for the whole of the UK during that year, and the latest date in spring the UK's lowest temperature has been recorded.[45]\n\nDemography\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Population 1801 6,657 1851 29,238 1881 48,069 1901 79,342 1941 116,434 1981 131,016 2001 137,017 2022 161,506\n\nReligion\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1929 St Woolos Church became the Pro-Cathedral of the Diocese of Monmouth, becoming a full cathedral in 1949. When Rowan Williams was appointed Archbishop of Wales in 2000, the Cathedral became the Metropolitan Cathedral of Wales,[46] as it had when previous Bishops of Monmouth were elected Archbishop.\n\nIn 1850 Newport was recognised as a centre of Catholicism in Wales when the Diocese of Newport and Menevia was created. Between 21 October 1966 and 6 October 1969, having retired as Bishop of Rochester, New York, Fulton J. Sheen, an American bishop who pioneered preaching on television and radio, was appointed the titular archbishop of Newport by Pope Paul VI. The Catholic St Patrick's Church was served by the Rosminians until the 2010s.\n\nThe foundation of the Charles Street Baptist Church was mainly the project of three women who had been members of Bethesda Baptist Chapel in Rogerstone, which was first built in 1742. In 1807 a Mrs Samuel and her friends rented a room in John Rowe's house on Stow Hill and asked the preachers John Hier, and his subordinate James Edmunds, both from Bethesda, to preach to them there. They later moved to a larger room in Charles Street. In 1816 a meeting at the Castleton Baptist Association agreed to build the first Welsh Baptist Chapel in Newport. Land was acquired in Charles Street, with the help of a bequest from Newport tailor John Williams. In May 1817 the opening services of the new church were held. By July 1879 the decline in Welsh-speaking in the town led to a change in the services from Welsh to English. In September 1993, the Charles Street congregation joined with Ebbw Bridge Baptist Church, Newport, and the Charles Street Chapel closed.[47]\n\nIn the 2011 census 56.8% of Newport residents considered themselves Christian, 4.7% Muslim, 1.2% Other religions (including Hindu, Buddhist, Sikh, Jewish and Others), 29.7% were non-religious and 7.5% chose not to answer the non-compulsory religion question on the census.[48]\n\nNewport has more than 50 churches,[49] 7 mosques,[50] and one synagogue;[51] the nearest Gurudwara is in Cardiff.[52]\n\nThe Church in Wales church of St Julius and St Aaron, at St Julian's, was consecrated in 1926.[53]\n\nThe following table shows the religious identity of residents residing in Newport according to the 2001, 2011 and the 2021 censuses.\n\nReligion 2001[54] 2011[55] 2021[56] Number % Number % Number % No religion 22,963 16.8 43,336 29.7 68,564 43.0 Christian 98,484 71.9 82,858 56.9 68,287 42.8 Muslim 3,492 2.5 6,859 4.7 11,280 7.1 Religion not stated 11,135 8.1 10,935 7.1 8,977 5.6 Hindu 231 0.2 685 0.5 761 0.5 Other religion 294 0.2 463 0.3 739 0.5 Buddhism 240 0.2 360 0.2 479 0.3 Sikh 85 0.1 141 0.1 415 0.3 Jewish 87 0.1 99 0.1 90 0.1 Total 137,011 100.00% 145,736 100.00% 159,600 100.0%\n\nEthnicity\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the 2011 census, 89.9% described themselves as White, 5.5% Asian, 1.7% Black, 1.1% Mixed White/Black, 0.5% Mixed White/Asian and 1.4% as other ethnic groups.[57] In the 2021 census, Whites had decreased to 85.6% of the population while all other groups increased bar Black Caribbeans.[58]\n\nEthnic Group Year 1991[59] 2001[60] 2011[61] 2021[58] Number % Number % Number % Number % White: Total 128,694 96.5% 130,408 95.2% 131,025 90% 136,473 85.6% White: British – – 127,563 93.1% 126,756 87% 128,245 80.4% White: Irish – – 1,045 769 685 0.4% White: Gypsy or Irish Traveller – – – – 84 168 0.1% White: Roma – – – – – – 406 0.3% White: Other – – 1,800 3,416 6,969 4.4% Asian or Asian British: Total 3,024 2.2% 3,873 2.8% 7,986 5.5% 12,194 7.6% Asian or Asian British: Indian 386 402 1,218 2,023 1.3% Asian or Asian British: Pakistani 1570 1,958 3,127 4,803 3.0% Asian or Asian British: Bangladeshi 552 867 1,749 2,858 1.8% Asian or Asian British: Chinese 250 296 600 711 0.4% Asian or Asian British: Other Asian 266 350 1,292 1,799 1.1% Black or Black British: Total 889 0.7% 734 0.5% 2,535 1.7% 3,737 2.3% Black or Black British: African 155 242 1,499 2,687 1.7% Black or Black British: Caribbean 449 418 782 553 0.3% Black or Black British: Other Black 285 74 254 497 0.3% Mixed or British Mixed: Total – – 1,635 1.1% 2,752 1.9% 4,451 2.8% Mixed: White and Black Caribbean – – 745 1,318 1,528 1.0% Mixed: White and Black African – – 182 360 640 0.4% Mixed: White and Asian – – 426 669 1,188 0.7% Mixed: Other Mixed – – 282 405 1,095 0.7% Other: Total 711 0.5% 361 0.3% 1,438 1% 2,737 1.7% Other: Arab – – – – 926 999 0.6% Other: Any other ethnic group 711 0.5% 361 0.3% 512 1,738 1.1% Ethnic minority: Total 4,624 3.5% 6,603 4.8% 14,711 10% 23,119 15.4% Total 133,318 100% 137,011 100% 145,736 100% 159,592 100%\n\nEconomy\n\n[edit]\n\nNewport's travel to work area incorporates much of south Monmouthshire; the new 2001-based area also includes Cwmbran.[62] The city itself has three major centres for employment: the city centre, and business parks clustered around the M4 motorway junctions 24 in the east and 28 in the west.\n\nOrganisations based in the city include Airbus Defence and Space; the headquarters of the Office for National Statistics;[63] the headquarters of the United Kingdom Intellectual Property Office (formerly known as the Patent Office); the General Insurance Division of Lloyds TSB; a large Panasonic manufacturing plant; a manufacturing plant for International Rectifier; the headquarters of insurance comparison site Gocompare; the headquarters of Wales and West Utilities; the shared-service centre for HM Prison Service; the Passport Office for much of the south and west of the UK; and the Wales headquarters of the Charity Commission and British Red Cross. In 2014 Admiral Insurance opened a large newly constructed office opposite Newport railway station.\n\nIn 1997, Newport secured what was then thought to be Europe's largest-ever inward investment when the LG Group announced a £1.7 billion project creating 6,100 jobs, and supported by public sector grants.[64] Facilities were built on the Celtic Lakes business and science park, but market conditions led to the semiconductor plant never opening, and the CRT plant eventually closed in 2003.[65] In 2005 Irish radiator manufacturer Quinn Group bought the former LG Phillips building, which became its European base.[66]\n\nIndustry in the east of Newport was formerly based at the Corus Llanwern steelworks, and although the rolling mill is still active, steel manufacture ceased in 2001. Permission has been granted to transform the 600-acre (240 ha) former steelworks site into a £1bn mixed-use development comprising housing, office and industrial space, public open space and a range of community facilities.[67]\n\nAt the mouth of the River Usk, the Sims Metal Management plant hosts the world's largest industrial shredder for scrap metal with access by road, rail and sea.[68][69][70][71] The plant, which is also the world's largest car crusher which was featured in the TV series 'How do they do it'.[72]\n\nNewport Cattle Market, in the Pillgwenlly area of the city, closed in 2009 and was demolished to make way for a new supermarket.[73][74]\n\nOn 17 February 2024 workers from Llanwern steelworks marched in the city centre to protest at the proposed loss of thousands of steel jobs at Port Talbot.[75]\n\nRegeneration\n\n[edit]\n\nThe city has seen major regeneration projects being undertaken in recent years.\n\nInfrastructure\n\n[edit]\n\nThe first stage of regeneration involved improving the city centre road network, turning Kingsway and Queensway into boulevards. The Southern Distributor Road to the south of the city opened in 2004, including the new City Bridge over the River Usk, improving access and opening up new areas for development. The Newport City footbridge opened in 2006 linking the east and west banks of the river for pedestrians and cyclists.\n\nNewport railway station was expanded in 2007[76] to four full size platforms capable of receiving 10 car Intercity Express Programme services to and from London Paddington. In 2010 a new station building was finished, carried out by engineering firm Atkins. During construction it was Wales' most environmentally friendly station work,[77] using a hypermodern green ETFE structure similar to the materials used in the Eden Project and the Beijing Olympics' ‘Water Cube’. In 2019 railway electrification and resigning work was completed, completing the 21st-century modernisation of the Great Western main line and reducing journey times to London to 1 hour 30 minutes.\n\nNewport bus station was redeveloped in 2013, expanded in 2015 with the Friars Walk development, and now offers 24 stands connecting to the rest of the city, as well as Cardiff and Bristol.[78] Local railway stations are reopening, starting with Rogerstone station in 2008, Pye Corner station in 2014, and with three others planned in the city's Unitary Development Plan.[79] Transport for Wales intend to restart services between Newport and Ebbw Vale Parkway by 2021.[80]\n\nThe Royal Gwent Hospital was downgraded to a minor injuries unit in 2020 when the new Grange University Hospital (Welsh: Ysbyty Athrofaol Y Faenor) was opened at Llanfrechfa, near Cwmbrân. There had been proposals to use the former Corus steel Whiteheads site, close to the existing Royal Gwent site, for a replacement hospital but this was considered to have the same access and space restrictions as the current hospital. It was decided to redevelop the Llanfrechfa Grange Hospital site, a former mental health and disabilities residential centre near Cwmbran, as a specialist and critical care unit.\n\nThe M4 relief road skirting the southern edge of the urban area of Newport was proposed as a means of reducing the congestion on the existing M4 motorway (presently squeezed through the Brynglas Tunnels) and making Newport and the surrounding areas more accessible for motorised vehicles. The relief road scheme was cancelled in July 2009 but relaunched in 2014.[81] A final decision not to proceed with the scheme was announced by the then First Minister of Wales, Mark Drakeford AM, on 4 June 2019.[82]\n\nLeisure\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Riverfront Arts Centre was the first structure to be built as part of Newport's regeneration by Newport City Council in 2004. It stands on Kingsway on the west bank of the River Usk. On the east bank, Rodney Parade is home to the regional United Rugby Championship (rugby union) team Dragons and the football team Newport County AFC. Club rugby union side Newport RFC play some home games at the ground (it was their home fro 1877 to 2016) but reotherwise based at Newport Stadium in Spytty.\n\nResidential\n\n[edit]\n\nNewport witnessed the fastest growth in property values in the UK during 2018,[83]\n\nAs part of the city's master plan, the city centre has been expanded to take in areas of the River Usk east bank, with the area of land between Newport Bridge and George Street Bridge part of an ongoing a £43 million high-density combined commercial and residential area, joined to the west bank by the new footbridge. The plan is designed to show a strong urban form along the riverfront, emphasised with tall landmark buildings.[84] The first phase has been labelled City Vizion.[85]\n\nThe Newport Student Village is adjacent to the university campus on the west bank,[86] as well as the \"Newhaus\" development of 154 riverside apartments.[87] At the southern end of the site, the \"Alexandra Gate\" development includes 300 homes and riverside apartments built adjacent to the City Bridge.[88]\n\nIn east Newport, land released from the Corus steelworks at Llanwern is being redeveloped as 4,000 houses, shops and other facilities.[89]\n\nCommercial\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Newport retail environment faced challenges following the late-2000s recession, with major redevelopment projects heavily delayed.\n\nFriars Walk shopping complex was first planned as a £210m development ahead of the 2010 Ryder Cup, but faced numerous setbacks. The site opened to the public in November 2015[90] helped by £90m of assistance from Newport Council to the developers,[90] with the Debenhams flagship store.[91] As well as 30 new shops, there are a dozen restaurants and an eight-screen Cineworld multiplex cinema.[90] Plans for redevelopment of the smaller Cambrian Centre were approved in 2012.[92]\n\nBuilding on hosting the Ryder Cup in 2010 and the NATO Summit in 2014, the 5,000 capacity Celtic Manor International Conference Centre (ICC Wales) opened its doors in 2019[93] as a conference venue for businesses and events in Wales and across the South West of England. It has hosted the UK Space Conference, BBC Cymru Wales broadcasts, and numerous national political conferences including hosting the Green Party of England and Wales and the UK Independence Party.\n\nThe 15-storey Chartist Tower is currently being redeveloped by developers Garrison Barclay Estates as a 163-bedroom Mercure Hotel, offering views across the city and the Bristol Channel. The site will also include 25,000 sq ft of office space and 18,000 sq ft of retail space. The hotel development is seen as an important step towards meeting the additional demand for hotel space in Newport created by the International Convention Centre (ICC) Wales. The opening of the hotel was delayed by several months due to Wales' lockdown as a response to COVID-19 and opened in May 2022.[94][95]\n\nNewport Market has also being redeveloped as a £12m mixed use[96] site with a tech hub, apartments, market units, as well as a food court, a project led by Newport City Council and the proprietors of Tramshed Cardiff.\n\nTransport\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also Category:Transport in Newport, Wales\n\nFor those travelling west from England into Wales, Newport is the first major urban area one passes through. As a result, it is a convergence point for national road, bus, and rail routes.\n\nAviation\n\n[edit]\n\nThe nearest airport with scheduled domestic and international flights is Cardiff Airport, 30 mi (50 km) south-west of Newport.[97] The airport is a 35-minute drive away from the city or a 55-minute train journey which involves changing at Cardiff Central for Vale of Glamorgan Line services to the nearby Rhoose Cardiff International Airport railway station. The airport is also accessible by transferring to 24-hour TrawsCymru T9 buses, which begin at Cardiff Central station.\n\nIn 2003, a proposal for a new Severnside airport near Newport was rejected by the Department for Transport. The airport would have featured runways on a man-made island in the Severn Estuary.[98]\n\nBuses\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Newport bus station\n\nNewport bus station is the largest bus interchange in the county, with 24 stands. It was built as part of the adjacent Friars Walk shopping centre and the station opened in December 2015.\n\nBus services are primarily provided by the municipally funded Newport Bus company, and neighbouring firm Cardiff Bus. Other operators include Phil Anslow Coaches, Stagecoach in South Wales, New Adventure Travel (N.A.T.), and until recently, First West of England.\n\nInter-city National Express services run from a stop near the Riverfront arts centre, opposite the bus station[99] and Megabus (Europe) services operate outside of Newport station.\n\nRailway\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Railway stations in Newport\n\nNewport is the easternmost Welsh city on the United Kingdom rail network and has close proximity to major economic centres in Cardiff and Bristol. Newport railway station is the third-busiest station in Wales and, due to its interchange options, it serves as a major transfer station.\n\nThe Great Western Main Line connects the city with termini at Bristol Temple Meads, London Paddington and Pembroke Dock; the Welsh Marches line connects with Holyhead, Manchester Piccadilly and Llanelli; and the Gloucester line connects the borders region including Cheltenham. The Wessex Main Line also provides an hourly service from the city to Portsmouth. The station has four platforms and is a mandatory stop on all express services to and from London Paddington.\n\nThe city is well linked with the nearby Welsh capital Cardiff, with approximately six rail and five bus services between the cities every hour.[100] Services to/from Bristol stop at Newport on average 2–3 times per hour, while there are nearly 4 services to/from London each hour.[101]\n\nModernisation\n\n[edit]\n\nThe current Newport station was built in 2010, in a hypermodern green ETFE structure, after a £22 million refurbishment programme; it introduced the futuristic new passenger terminal and bridge, whilst restoring the 19th-century features of the site. The new complex, west of the old station entrance, includes two terminals, four full-size platforms, new terminal buildings and a public footbridge, a new passenger footbridge, a new taxi area, short-stay car park and a 250-space passenger car park.\n\nThe 21st-century modernisation of the Great Western main line programme has seen the installation of new facilities on platforms 2 and 3, including redesigned toilets, waiting rooms and covered areas.\n\nOverhead line equipment has been installed through the city, as part of electrification of the London to Cardiff line, which allows the operation of Japanese-built Intercity Express Programme 10-car trains. The new services are all-electric, with more seats and improvements to journey times between Newport and London of around 1 hour 30 minutes, including non-stop services after Wales between Bristol Parkway and London Paddington.[102]\n\nRogerstone railway station, on the Ebbw Valley (Western Valleys) line, reopened in 2008 and Pye Corner, close to the site of the former Bassaleg railway station, opened around 2015. Transport for Wales services run between Ebbw Vale and Cardiff Central, and between Ebbw Vale and Newport, via Rogerstone and Pye Corner. Direct services between Ebbw Vale and Newport were reintroduced in early 2024 following work on local signalling.\n\nThere are active proposals from Grand Central to operate services from Llanelli, via Cardiff and Newport, to London Paddington, only stopping at Severn Tunnel Junction and Bristol Parkway instead of the current service which also calls at Didcot Parkway, Swindon and Reading.[103]\n\nServices\n\n[edit]\n\nThe services calling at Newport are:\n\nGreat Western Railway\n\nLondon Paddington – Reading – Bristol Parkway – Newport – Cardiff Central (– Bridgend – Port Talbot – Neath – Swansea)\n\nCardiff Central – Newport – Bristol Temple Meads – Bath Spa – Salisbury – Southampton – Portsmouth Harbour\n\nCardiff Central – Newport – Bristol Temple Meads – Weston-super-Mare – Taunton\n\nTransport for Wales\n\nManchester Piccadilly – Stockport – Crewe – Shrewsbury – Hereford – Cwmbran – Newport – Cardiff Central (– Bridgend – Port Talbot – Neath – Swansea – Carmarthen – Haverfordwest)\n\nCardiff Central – Newport – Cwmbran – Hereford – Shrewsbury – Wrexham General – Chester – Rhyl – Bangor – Holyhead\n\nMaesteg – Bridgend – Cardiff Central – Newport – Chepstow – Gloucester – Cheltenham Spa\n\nCrossCountry\n\nCardiff Central – Newport – Gloucester – Cheltenham Spa – Birmingham New Street – Nottingham\n\nRoads\n\n[edit]\n\nM4 Motorway\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: M4 motorway\n\nThe M4 motorway junctions in and near the city area:\n\n23A lies just outside the city boundaries and provides local access via the A4810 and B4245.\n\n24: Coldra A449/A48/B4237\n\n25: Caerleon Road B4596\n\n25A: Grove Park A4042\n\n26: Malpas Road A4051\n\n27: High Cross, B4591\n\n28: Tredegar Park A48/A4072 (A467/A468)\n\n29: St Mellons A48(M) – no access from local roads\n\nThe Brynglas Tunnels are a cause of traffic delays as the M4 narrows to two lanes in both directions between junctions 25 and 26.\n\nSouthern Distributor Road\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Southern Distributor Road\n\nThe Southern Distributor Road (SDR) is part of the A48 road and is a peripheral distributor road, which runs from Junction 24 of the M4 motorway in the east of Newport to Junction 28 in the west.
