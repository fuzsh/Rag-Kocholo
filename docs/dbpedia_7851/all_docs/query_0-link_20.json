When Thunderbolt's trusty sidekick Lightning reveals that the show's producers are on the lookout for a new star, Thunderbolt - with Patch in tow - struts out into the real world to perform true acts of heroism. When the puppy-obsessed Cruella De Vil returns, it's Patch and Thunderbolt's teamwork and friendship that will save the day.",
