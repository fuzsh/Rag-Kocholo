        "text": "It’s been so long since I’ve done a Disney sequel that I almost forgot I was doing Disney sequels. But we are doing Disney sequels so let’s get this overwith. Wait a minute, I thought Bolt was decades away!\n\nDisclaimer: This blog is purely recreational and not for profit.

The opinions expressed therein reflect those of the authors and are not to be viewed as factual documentation. All photos are from Animation Screencaps unless otherwise stated.\n\nNow, right out of the gate we have a silver lining. 101 Dalmatians 2 is not a Disneytoon sequel. Instead, it was done by Walt Disney Television Animation and Walt DIsney Animation Japan, who had plenty of practice with these characters doing the 101 Dalmatians television series. Why was that a thing? I don’t know. Why is there a second series going on right now on Disney+? I don’t know that either. But there was. And they also did this movie.\n\nWeirdly enough, this is one of the highest rated Direct to Video sequels Disney’s done. It boasts a solid 67% on Rotten Tomatoes and several DVDX Awards, including Best Animated Feature, Best Director, Best Editing, and Best Musical Score. I’ve seen this one once and though my memories are a little spotty (ayyyy!), I don’t remember it being that good. But before we go to see if it really is better than I think…\n\nLOOK IT MAH DOG.\n\nSTORY\n\nIt’s not a good sign when the opening narration of a sequel encourages you to remember the first one. But that’s where we begin, with Pongo reminding us that Roger is his pet and he’s the one with the spots. The two of them wrangle the multitudes of puppies materializing out of nowhere in a writhing mass of tongues and tails and chaos. Seriously. Too many dogs. Anita, now voiced very obviously by the one and only Jodi Benson, scolds Roger to get to work while he prances around singing about having a ludicrous number of dogs. But of course, as always with a Disney sequel’s opening number, there’s one character who’s not satisfied with the idyllic status quo. That’s just how these movies work.\n\nIn this case, it’s Patch, one of the mass of Dalmatians. He perches in front of the TV so he can watch his favorite show from the best spot in the house, with no competition. Of course, this plan get shot when Nanny calls the pups all in for dinner. The raging tide of puppies sweeps Patch away, but his siblings crowd him out so badly that he can’t get a bite to eat. He ends up searching the empty bag of food and only finds one stray kibble… which Rolly promptly swallows whole. Rude. To make things worse, Thunderbolt comes on, and poor Patch has lost his place in front of the TV! In a desperate plea for attention, Patch refuses to shut up, annoying his siblings further. Revenge, I guess? I don’t know.\n\nAt the end of the show, Patch tries to imitate Thunderbolt’s mighty super bark and gets ridiculed by his siblings. Why are these dogs so mean to him? I don’t get it. This is the last straw that convinces Patch that he needs to be one of a kind. Before he can muse on this longer, it’s bedtime. On the way up, Anita announces that she has new licenses for everyone, so they’re conveniently marked with their new address in case the plot needs it. Suddenly, Patch stops. A commercial blares onto the TV. The producers of Thunderbolt are looking for new wonder pups to join the show as guest stars! It’s Patch’s big chance to become one of a kind! And even better, he gets to meet his hero! He begs his dad for the chance to go but Pongo has to decline. After all, tomorrow’s the big move. Green fields, blue skies, and plenty of space between them and that “evil, ugly monster”.\n\nSaid evil, ugly monster has her face pressed against a furrier’s window. It seems Cruella’s probational officer has placed a restraining order on her to keep her away from her precious furs. Roger’s song is still top of the charts, and her car falls apart as soon as she tries to drive it. How that thing hasn’t been scrapped already boggles the mind. Anyway, Cruella’s having a rough day. But all that changes as she passes an art gallery full of paintings upon paintings of black and white spots! The artist, a beatnik caricature of modern artists named Lars invites her to share her interpretation of his minimalistic art. She dramatically declares that she sees the whole world in that one little spot.\n\nOf course, she’s transferring her obsession with furs onto his art, but Lars thinks she’s praising his work. And then things get weird. He instantly falls in love with her, which is as uncomfortable as it is hilarious. I mean, the deadpan delivery of overblown compliments like “what cloud dares to cast a shadow on the flower?” is comedy gold but the idea of some guy macking on Cruella de Vil of all people is a Yikes from me. Anyway, she commissions him to paint something to restore her will to live and he asks her to be his muse.\n\nAfter… that…. it’s puppy sleepy time, but Patch’s siblings keep him awake with their snoring and drooling. He carefully crawls through the masses until he can snuggle up to his father’s side. Now, throughout this movie so far, there’s been a running gag of Pongo struggling to keep count of all his kids. So he’s still counting in his sleep. Because Disney sequel main characters barely maintain higher brain function, Patch fails to realize that his father is asleep and asks him if he’s unique or just one of one hundred and one. Sleepy Pongo mumbles the first number to penetrate into his brain, which of course makes Patch think his father doesn’t love him. So he forlornly pads to the kitchen and curls up in the empty dog food bag.\n\nMoving day arrives, and Pongo frantically tries to keep track of the masses teeming into the truck. No one sees Patch asleep in the pantry, and Pongo loses count at the worst possible time. He decides that he’s done a good enough job and leaves it, so no one realizes that there’s a puppy missing! Patch races to the window and barks to tell them he was left behind, but no one hears him over 98 other barking pups. Soon, the moving truck is gone. Rather than do the intelligent thing and give chase, Patch follows the next vehicle to come by instead: the Kanine Krunchies truck, heading towards the audition… and Thunderbolt!\n\nThe Radcliffs have been afflicted with Chronic Moron Disease, so they happily drive off to their idyllic little home in the country. Perdita sighs with relief that they don’t have to count anymore which I do not understand. It’s even more important to keep track of your kids in wide open spaces! Already one of them has almost drowned in the pond! Already a bunch of them have been attacked by chickens! When did these two become so neglectful? Not cool. Oh, yeah, and the human house is a mouldering wreck that needs some serious fixing up.\n\nAnd then it’s back to the audition! Dogs from all over pack in to watch Thunderbolt himself, a majestic German Shepard, strut up onto the stage, followed by the less majestic Corgi Li’l Lightning. A bunch of female dogs (one of whom is voiced by Kathryn Beaumont in her final film role) swoon and sigh and make fools over themselves in an effort to get Thunderbolt’s attention, so of course Lightning tries to schmooze in. Yeah, it doesn’t work. This is a Disney sequel, so of course the big celebrity is a vapid, arrogant toolbag, preening under all the attention.\n\nWell, no time to prepare. It’s time to get started! The gathered dogs step onto the stage one by one so the producer can hear their super bark… I mean heroic bark. Carrying in the original’s traditions of cameos, Jock from Lady and the Tramp and Max from the Little Mermaid appear as candidates. And then it’s Patch’s turn. The little guy gets serious stage fright, but at Thunderbolt’s coaxing tries his best bark. Everyone bursts out laughing at the pathetic squeaking but like, he’s a baby! The audition ends there, leaving him alone and humiliated on the stage. And even worse, his shellshocked expression is the picture the newspapers choose to tell people about the audition!\n\nLater that night, Thunderbolt enjoys the attention of his admirers for just a little bit longer. Finally, he backs into his trailer which is filled to the brim with his own merchandise. They’re really driving home that ego thing. Suddenly, Lightning bursts into the trailer as fast as his lil corgi legs can carry him with bad news. The studio’s auditioning dog to replace Thunderbolt! They’re going to kill him off! And this is the part where I really warmed up to Thunder. Because yeah, his character is 100% stock. But he’s so excited about getting to do a big dramatic death scene that he just devours the scenery, spouting gems like “I’ll kick it bigger than Old Yeller!” It’s glorious. But then Lightning drops another bomb: he’s really never coming back. It’s over… and Thunder’s ensuing panic is even funnier. “I HATE TICKS. THEYYYY SUCK THE BLOOOOD RIIIIIGHT OUT OF YOOOOOUUUUUUU!!!!!”\n\nLightning plants an idea into his head: if Thunderbolt performs a real act of heroism, the humans will know he’s still worthy of being a star. So that’s what he’s going to do. But first, he has to get past the stragglers and staff from the audition, which involves putting a mop on his head and going “sneak sneak sneak sneak sneak” out loud. You’re all right, Thunder. Patch sees through this awful disguise immediately and starts rattling off episode numbers where he did the same thing, because he’s seen every episode enough times to memorize them. And this is before DVR made that common! Thunder tries to shake him off, then gets distracted by a cat stuck in a tree… okay, no, the cat’s terrorizing some birds in the tree. He has no idea how to “rescue” it without a script, so Patch feeds him ideas based on his TV exploits. After some slapstick where Thunderbolt squashes the cat and probably kills a man, the ditzy Shepard’s only concern is… where are the photographers?\n\nBack at the art studio, Lars finishes up his painting… and Cruella hates it. Like, really hates it. Sets it on fire with her cigarette, even. Lars’ reaction to her vicious tongue is amazingly deadpan, but because she’s still his “cupcake” (ew), he agrees to try again. This dude is scary devoted and I do not understand. While Cruella manipulates this guy with her “tortured soul” or whatever, Thunderbolt convinces Patch to undertake a “Junior Deputy Test”. This basically means feeding him stunts from his episodes so he can do hero things, like stopping a runaway stagecoach that isn’t running away at all until he spooks the horses.\n\nAnd what would a Disney sequel be without a comedic montage set to a bad pop song? Lars continues to hunt for inspiration, Thunderbolt continues to search for heroics. It’s a lot more entertaining than I just made it sound, including things like crazed badgers and monkey rustlers, and easily the best sequel montage so far. Thunder’s having a surprisingly good time being a real hero, too, which makes Patch a little suspicious. Rather than come clean, Thunderbolt asks about the pup’s story.\n\nThe humans realize Thunderbolt is missing and freak the heck out. Fortunately, there just happens to be another dog in the exact right place at the exact right time: Lightning! He can be the new star! Satisfied with his hard work, Lightning returns to the trailer to outline his whole evil plan to a giant Thunderbolt plushie. He’s going to replace Thunderbolt and become the star. This whole thing about killing him off on the show was all a lie to get him out of the way! This movie has an evil Corgi, you guys. I’m liking this more and more as it goes on.\n\nSpeaking of evil, pleasing Cruella is an impossible task. Lars collapses in defeat, despairing of ever finding inspiration. It’s okay, though! Cruella just knows where to go. It’s a last ditch effort but she has no problems breaking her parole if it feeds her obsession with spots. Where is this magical cure-all? Why, Anita Radcliffe’s place, of course! There’s just one problem. They’ve moved! Like a deus-ex-machina falling from the sky, a newspaper smacks Cruella in the face with the photo of Patch and Thunderbolt clearly visible on the front. Somehow Cruella is able to make out the new address from the tiny photographed dog tag.\n\nThe same paper finds the Radcliffes on their farm, but they’re all too distracted to actually read it. Anita’s wrangling chickens and puppies. Nanny’s got laundry to do. Roger’s busy writing music. So they all toss the paper aside without even looking at the picture on the front. So that’s frustrating. Cut back to Patch telling Thunder he’s one of one hundred and one siblings, which, besides being factually inaccurate (99 puppies! Two parents!) reminds Thunderbolt of that one time he heard about them on the Twilight Bark. Remember the better movie? The two commiserate about being replaceable and superbark from a bridge. I mean hero bark. They’re totally different.\n\nThe Dalmatian Plantation is still beset with the kind of mass chaos that comes with owning 101 dogs. The puppies’ shenanigans knock the newspaper onto Roger’s music stand, and finally, finally the humans notice that Patch is still in London. The movie’s half over, folks. Horrified, Roger and Anita load Pongo and Perdita into the car and speed off towards London, leaving Nanny in charge. Somehow, Perdita convinces herself that Cruella will get a hold of her puppy and honestly I don’t know how she came to that conclusion that quickly. I mean, it’s obvious to any viewer with any basic knowledge of story structure but how could she know the devil woman is on the prowl again?\n\nThey can’t possibly know Cruella’s scheming again. She doesn’t even have the help of her two thugs. That would be because Horace and Jasper are languishing in jail, which is wildly unfair considering Cruella got off with probation. But wait! Someone bailed them out! This is not how bail works in the slightest, but never mind. The two brothers muse on which of their parents it might have been, only to find it wasn’t their parents at all. It was Cruella! Shock! Amazement! She tells them they’re going to finish what they started with a prison guard right there. What is wrong with the prison system in this city?\n\nAnd then there’s a prostitution joke. No, I am not kidding. At all. I wish I was. The new plan is for Jasper to dress as a woman, stick his leg out, and call the Kanine Krunchies truck driver a “naughty boy” when he offers to help “her” in exchange for “services.” Who is this joke made for? Why did I have to witness this? I’m a good person. I don’t deserve this. The knowledge that there is a prostitution joke featuring a creepy thug in drag in an official Disney sequel designed to make children shut up for an hour will haunt me for the rest of my life.\n\nThis unbelievable, ridiculous, mind-meltingly disturbing ploy actually works, and the Baduns are able to hijack the Kanine Krunchies truck. Nanny hears the jingle blaring out of the truck’s speakers and immediately goes on high alert. But she’s too late. The puppies hear the gangling music, too. Like the Pied Piper and his flute, the music irresistibly draws the puppies into the back of the van to their doom. Just as the Baduns prepare to make their grand escape, Nanny charges out, armed with that most potent of household weapons: the frying pan. And she holds her own! Tragically, Horace and Jasper overpower her and tie her to a barrel, which they lower to the bottom of a well to keep her out of the way. Poor thing. She was this close to “knocking the stupid out of them.”\n\nMuch to Lars’s confusion, Cruella returns with enormous crates that she calls “inspiration.” Lars is thrilled at the idea of painting all these adorable little puppies, and he cuddles and snuggles and loves them. You know, like people do with adorable little puppies. But he seems to have misunderstood Cruella. She doesn’t want them to be inspiration. She wants to use their skins as the canvas because artists are always looking for new ways to experiment and man I don’t even know. How do you go from fur coats to this? Lars finally, finally realizes that this chick is crazycakes and vows to protect the puppies at any cost. So she ties him to one of his own canvases and throws knives at him while gloating that she still has her backup plan of creating a Dalmatian-skin coat. Why is that the backup plan? Man, I don’t know.\n\nThe puppies bark madly to alert the Twilight Bark that they’re in trouble. And we get the exact same montage as the first movie! This one is actually much shorter, but it feels much longer because it’s such a rehash. They added Max to the list of cameo dogs, though. That’s cool. I do so love Little Mermaid. During all this, Thunderbolt starts to get discouraged by the lack of press coverage because this is clearly the most interesting thing happening right now. The Twilight Bark catches their attention, with news of one hundred and one kidnapped puppies! Patch immediately realizes his siblings are in trouble even though that’s impossible because he’s only got 98 siblings. Must be a different bunch of animal hoarders. Thunder stops just short of confessing that he’s not really a hero at the exact moment he needs to be one, but he can’t resist Patch’s puppy adorableness. They finally know what he can do to be a real hero!\n\nBut they’re not the only dogs listening to the Twilight Bark. Lightning hears the news, too, and somehow knows Thunderbolt’s going to play the hero and succeed. Because reasons. A lot of this movie’s plot hinges on “because reasons”. He wiggles his little corgi butt down to the warehouse and just happens to make it just in time to catch Patch and Thunderbolt in time to offer his help. Somehow, all three dogs, including the corgi, make it up a human sized ladder to drop into the warehouse through the skylight. Patch’s encyclopedic knowledge of Thunderbolt’s TV exploits almost derails Lightning’s plans, but he sabotages Thunder into launching an all-out attack. Thunder looses his super hero bark… and it fails. He tries it a second time… and Horace and Jasper freeze in terror. For a moment, it looks like an episode of the show. But it soon becomes apparent that they’re really terrified of the devil woman who, a second later, bashes Thunder unconscious with a paint can.\n\nCruella gloats and gloats about how she finally has the puppies while Thunderbolt moans about how easily he was defeated. Horace and Jasper load Thunder and Patch into a cage separate from the other puppies, and Lightning divulges the whole horrible truth about everything. The humans aren’t really writing Thunderbolt out of the show, he’s just trying to steal his spotlight, and Thunder’s not really a hero anyway. Everything is terrible and Patch’s illusions of his hero are shattered. Sadness. Drama. All is lost.\n\nBut wait! Lucky is also a walking Thunderbolt encyclopedia! There was apparently an episode where he got out of this exact situation! So Patch regains his confidence and kicks open the door. Yeah. Really. A tiny puppy manages to kick open the lock. These guys need better supplies. Once free, Patch opens up the other puppies’ cages and turns them loose right under Horace and Jaspers’ sleeping noses. But one dog refuses to leave the cage. Thunderbolt is depressed and ashamed of himself which apparently makes him willing to become a coat. Or something.\n\nCruella still has Lars tied to his canvas, and she’s not done gloating or blowing toxic waste smoke in his face. Horace wakes up to get a snack, waking Jasper, who notices that the cages are empty. The goons frantically search the warehouse for the missing puppies, trying to be as quiet as possible so they don’t alert Cruella. She notices, of course. Oh, and the puppies camoflauge themselves against a spotted canvas. This whole plotline was a setup for that one joke. Oh, sequels. Anyway, Cruella loses her mind when she realizes the puppies are missing again. Lucky gets the terrible trio’s attention by hiding on top of the elevator shaft to trick them into searching downstairs\n\nBut the puppies aren’t upstairs at all. They creep out of their corner to bounce on a stretched canvas like a trampoline, out the skylight to freedom. Yes, really. That is how they escape. Now, I only dabble in painting, but I’m fairly certain canvases are not that bouncy. Somehow, Cruella pops out of nowhere to catch Patch, the last puppy, in her cold, cruel claws. And a slapstick escape ensues! Paint splashes all over Horace and Jasper, creating a canvas covered in splotches with their bodies outlined. Remember that. It comes back. Thunderbolt watches the puppies escape with pride in his eyes. And then he locks eyes with the captive Lars.\n\nOnce outside the warehouse, the puppies take refuge aboard a double decker bus. Patch bumps the stick shift and the bus hilariously takes off! Now the puppies have to drive a bus to escape Cruella! Isn’t that wacky? Seriously, I’m pretty sure even in the ’60s no bus was that easy to accidentally gun into gear. But this is a cartoon and it makes no bones about being such. And yes, there is a difference between animation and a cartoon. But this is not the place for that conversation. Anyway, finally, at the climax of the movie, Cruella calls her henchmen idiots for the first time (took them long enough!) and piles everybody into the stolen truck.\n\nWell, it’s certainly not the epic car chase from the first one. The two cars swerve and cause tons of property damage and mass panic. After surfing on the backs of the cars on the road, Cruella manages to get her hands on Rolly. She lassoes a scarf around her head to catch the bus or something while Rolly shrieks for help. That reminds Patch of an episode of Thunderbolt- the very episode we got to see at the beginning that I skipped right over! Lucky snatches the scarf between his teeth, making it fly back and tie Cruella up. It looks like it’s over. But if your Disney sequel doesn’t have a serious case of ending fatigue, is it really a Disney sequel?\n\nDuring the chaos, the vehicles smashed through the first rehearsal of Li’l Lightning’s takeover of the show. Lightning got smashed against the windshield of the bus, which almost results in him getting squished against a wall as the bus screeches to a stop. You know. Comedy. Cruella’s truck stops at the mouth of the alley, cornering the puppies. Patch distracts her while his siblings escape through the upper deck. Just when it seems like he’s going to have to sacrifice himself, Thunderbolt heroically leaps onto the scene! It seems he freed Lars, and Lars drove him over. How did he know where they’d be? I don’t know, maybe he followed the path of destruction caused by puppies driving a bus.\n\nThunder distracts the bad guys with a really, really dramatic fake heart attack. It’s amazing. The fake death moves Lightning to tears and urges Cruella into trying to put him out of his misery with a lead pipe. Her wild flailing manages to knock out Horace, Jasper, Lightning, and eventually herself, but misses Thunderbolt entirely. Patch pulls the bus into gear so the puppies can use it to escape, knocking all four of the bad guys into a convenient pond. Nanny leads the police to Horace and Jasper, who promptly get arrested all over again. Police dogs drag Lightning away, and Cruella is finally, finally institutionalized.\n\nThe Radcliffes pull the car up. They, Pongo, and Perdita race out to greet their lost children, who can’t stop gushing about how great Patch was. He’s just happy that his dad missed him for real. No you didn’t! You didn’t realize he was gone until you saw the papers! Whatever. Patch introduces his new best buddy Thunderbolt to his parents, and Thunderbolt is happy to give Patch all the credit for saving his siblings. Because Patch is really a one of a kind wonder dog.\n\nWe end on a newspaper montage of where all the characters are after the movie. The public finally recognizes Lars as a genius for his work in “splatter art” (with the silhouettes of Horace and Jasper, remember?) . Roger inexplicably gets a gold record for the song at the beginning. Horace and Jasper renounce their life of crime to open a fur-free dress shop. Cruella is still in the asylum, according to a periodical all about mental institution. And all 99 puppies get to guest star on Thunderbolt!\n\nIs it a great movie? Not by any means. But you know what? I enjoyed it a whole lot more than I’ve enjoyed any of the sequels so far. There were some genuinely funny moments, especially one-liners from the deliciously hammy Thunderbolt and the gloriously deadpan Lars. Nearly everyone is out of character, and it feels significantly more cartoony and childish than the original, but the existing characters are such minor roles it only got a chance to bother me a little bit. Cruella was the exception to this and she’s such a caricature anyway that it’s not such a big deal. It probably doesn’t need to exist but I had a pretty good time with it!\n\nExcept for the prostitute thing. That was super weird.\n\nCHARACTERS\n\nPatch is a bit of an odd choice for a point of view character considering Lucky was a lot more of a focus in the original… inasmuch as any of the puppies got a focus. He’s a very precocious child who seems to have an uncanny ability to memorize anything he sees, as long as it’s on television. He’s a great teaching tool for younger or middle siblings who might find themselves lost in the shuffle, and of course kids tend to be the target for these things. He’s much less annoying than our last sequel protagonist in a dog movie, too. Like, muuuuuch less annoying. Ironically, part of this is the casting of a real British child named Billy Lockwood to do the child voice, instead of an adult trying to pitch his voice up. It makes him so much more believable and likable than Scamp.\n\nThunderbolt is a walking cliche: the selfish egomaniac actor who learns to be a better person. It’s such a stock trope. But you know what? I liked it. They took the time to show his growth, and they made the journey entertaining. Barry Bostwick is absolutely devouring the scenery with every line he speaks (“THEY SUCK ALL THE BLOOD OUT OF YOOOOOOU!!!!), and it got some genuine belly laughs out of me. And guys, guys, guys! I went a whole review talking about Barry Bostwick without talking about Rocky Horror! Aren’t you proud of me?\n\nPongo and Perdita are reduced to bit parts this time around, but they got the bulk of that good old Disney sequel character assassination. Perdita had very little to work with to begin with but apparently her new personality is “has detailed knowledge of Cruella-related plot points before they happen”. And Pongo is now ditzy and inattentive which… what? What happened to the father who treked 75 miles to unleash holy hell on the guys who kidnapped his kids? I’m supposed to believe that he can’t count them and he decides it’s good enough? Come on, guys, you were doing so well.\n\nLars is almost as delightful as Thunderbolt, and for many of the same reasons. He’s just so hammy! And yet, unlike other Martin Short Disney roles, it never descends into being annoying. It’s mitigated with equally hilarious deadpan deliveries of absolutely ridiculous lines like “your words hurt like the fists of a large dock worker”. I loved him. While I’m not entirely sure that a parody character like this fits in the world of 101 Dalmatians, he’s still way more entertaining than a new character from a Disney sequel has any right to be. Cruella having a boyfriend is still super weird, though.\n\nCruella de Vil is back to her old puppy murdering tricks, but now she just wants to paint on their skins for… some reason. She’s a much more comedic villain than she was in the first one, with most of the menace of the orignal gone. Yet she still maintains her ability to manipulate people and situations to her advantage, so that’s cool. She’s voiced by Susanne Blakeslee, who does every Disney villainess ever now. I probably mentioned that in the Cinderella sequels. Oh well.\n\nHorace and Jasper are more or less the same as alway: amoral goons who exist to do Cruella’s bidding. Right from the beginning, though, they seem to regret their actions and are kind of reluctant to go along with Cruella’s schemes. Mostly because she’s nuts. They also have a lot more reliance on slapstick and cartoony antics, which makes them a lot less threatening. I mean, they got hit with a lot of slapstick in the original, too, but it still felt realistic. So I guess that’s a downgrade.\n\nLi’l Lightning is the last of our villains, and easily the weakest one. He’s another stock character, the disgruntled sidekick who wants to take the spotlight away from the star who overshadows him. A cute little corgi turning evil could have been a really interesting angle, but they don’t really work it to its full potential. And if you want a really threatening, compelling villain, don’t have Jason Alexander’s goofy voice doing it! I’m super salty because of Hunchback, true, but it just killed any hope for me of Lightning working. Stupid gargoyles.\n\nMUSIC\n\nThe first thing I noticed about Richard Gibbs’ score is that it borrows from the 101 Dalmatians Kids play that Disney licenses out to schools to get kids into the arts or whatever. Listen, guys, I was a theatre kid, I have seen things I still regret. But listen to the opening credits and then listen to the opening number from the play. Like, I’m not crazy, right? That’s the same? So right out of the gate we have something completely unoriginal. However, the score at least tried to emulate the jazz-infused piano-filled tunes from the original. I’ve got to give an A for effort there. Like the original, the sequel has very few actual songs, but let’s examine what’s there anyway.\n\nI See Spots is an uninspired opening number featuring some incredibly awkward lyrics. It also breaks the continuity of the world by having Anita burst into random song (a reprise of Dalmatian Plantation) in counterpoint with Roger. It’s okay for Roger to start because he’s a musician, but a random song and dance number just doesn’t fit with this universe. I really don’t know how it got a gold record in universe, because it’s not a good song. At all.\n\nThunderbolt Adventure Hour tries very, very hard to be Kanine Krunchies. Like its predecessor, it’s a deliberately annoying, catchy jingle meant to parody the cheesiness of ’60s TV. However, I don’t think it exactly fits the idea of a serious action Western like the Thunderbolt show purports to be. And yes, I know the movie’s marketed to small children, but is a little bit of tonal consistency too much to ask?\n\nTry Again is our Disney sequel montage song pop song, but at least they attempt to put a little jazz in it with the trumpet and the “do-wop” in the underscore. It fits the world of 101 Dalmatians a whole lot better than the songs in Cinderella 2 or Bambi 2, anyway. It’s also not a terrible message for kids, all things considered. The lyrics aren’t great, but I’m sure parents would prefer their kids to hear a message about persistence than “it’s a painted up face that gets you a man”. I also appreciate that Will Young samples the Thunderbolt Adventure Hour with the “ah-ooos” that sound like dog howls. That’s a nice touch.\n\nYou’re the One is the credit song and a blatant reminder that this was made in 2003. I will say, I always liked LMNT when I was younger but this is not one of their better songs. I guess you need an over-synthed pop song on the credits of these things but… yeah, it’s not great.\n\nARTISTRY\n\nThey tried! They actually tried! That’s not a “damning with faint praise” thing, I’m actually geniunely impressed that the creators made an effort to replicate the loose, sketchy style of the original. The character animation is way smoother and very clearly inked with computers, but the backgrounds look great! Colors are outside the lines, details are left to the viewer’s imagination, and the feel of the 1960’s is in full force. It’s not an exact replication, but I have to give them props for making the effort.\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS\n\nI was genuinely surprised by how much I enjoyed this movie. I mean, it’s still very much a Disney sequel. Cliché plots, stock characters, and lackluster music all make that abundantly clear. But they flesh them out, they take the time to honor the original instead of blowing it off or trying to modernize it (looking at you, Cinderella 3), and it’s got some decent visuals. Best of all ,though, it’s genuinely funny! Like, some of the line reads from Martin Short and Barry Bostwick are actually hysterical! And that made it much more fun to watch than I ever thought it would be.\n\nBut seriously, who wrote in that prostitution joke? Turn on your location, I just want to talk.\n\nFavorite scene: Lars meets Cruella and falls madly, weirdly, awkwardly in love with her. It’s deeply uncomfortable, but it’s supposed to be, and his infatuation leads to some serious comedy gold."
