        "text": "Kath Soucie is a New York City-born voice actor best known for her work on animated children's TV shows, including the Nickelodeon series \"Rugrats\" and feature films such as the Disney blockbusters \"Beauty and the Beast\" and \"The Little Mermaid.\" After debuting in a live-action role in the1979 made-for-TV film \"The Incredible Journey of Doctor Meg Laurel,\" Soucie switched almost exclusively to voice acting. Highly sought after for her uncanny ability to switch between male and female voices, Soucie played characters of both sexes and of various ages in dozens of animated series throughout the 1980s and '90s. In 1991, Soucie began perhaps her best-known role, voicing twins Phil and Lil DeVille and their mother on the long-running children's series \"Rugrats.\" By the late '90s Soucie was branching out into voice acting for live-action films, as well as work on more adult-themed animated programs such as the Matt Groening-created cult series \"Futurama.\""
