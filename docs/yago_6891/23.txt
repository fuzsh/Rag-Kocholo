Jeremy Sisto has married his fiancÃ©e Addie Lane in a private ceremony in New York.

The pair, who welcomed daughter Charlie Ballerina four months ago, exchanged vows at City Hall in Manhattan last Tuesday with only two people present.

The Six Feet Under star apparently wore ripped jeans and a casual shirt, while Lane wore a simple dress. When an onlooker told the couple how happy he was for them, the bride apparently said: "We are the ones who are happy."

Sisto divorced his wife of nine years Marisa Ryan in 2002.
