He was born in Grass Valley, California, USA, on 6 October 1974, so his zodiac sign is Libra.\n\nEarly life\n\nLike many other actors, Jeremy was born into a family of creatives. His father, Richard, is a renowned jazz musician and music professor, while his mother, Reedy, is an actress. Jeremy’s older sister, Meadow, also grew up to be an actress, probably still known best for her portrayal of Caroline in the 1992 movie “Captain Ron”.\n\nHis parents separated when he was very young, and his father later married the fabric artist Penny Sisto.
