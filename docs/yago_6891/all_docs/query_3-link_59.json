However, Soaps.com may receive a commission on orders placed through its retail links, and the retailer may receive certain auditable data for accounting purposes.\n\nThe Law & Order spinoff might be moving to Peacock for Season 5, but that doesn’t mean fans won’t get to see any fun guest stars. But which familiar faces might show up in Law & Order: Organized Crime in the new season?\n\nWho Are the Law & Order: Organized Crime Season 5 Guest Stars?\n\nThe most important guest star coming to Law & Order: Organized Crime for Season 5? None other than Mariska Hargitay’s Olivia Benson. “Oh, girlfriend’s coming on,” Christopher Meloni, who plays Detective Elliot Stabler, said on the Today show on Thursday, August 1st. The two characters, whose fans have affectionally dubbed with the ship name EO, have not shared a scene since Organized Crime’s third season, though they were shown to speak on the phone in SVU’s Season 25 finale.\n\nMeloni is writing a Season 5 episode of Law & Order: Organized Crime, which feels like the perfect opportunity to bring in Hargitay. He discussed the possibility with People, sharing that he wasn’t sure he would make an appearance on SVU this season, but there was a chance Hargitay could make it into Organized Crime, and he would love to see it happen in his episode.\n\nMore: How did Law & Order: Organized Crime Season 4 end?\n\n“I’m going to have an opportunity to… I don’t know… I’ll tell you what. Hopefully, uncover, peel away a little bit more of the onion or uncover a little more depth of feeling between them,” he shared.\n\nFans of Law & Order have long been divided into camps regarding whether a relationship between Benson and Stabler would be a good thing or a bad thing, but it’s fair to say most fans at this point probably want a resolution either way. It has, after all, been a long time coming.\n\nHargitay agreed that it was time for the two of them to share a scene again, at the very least. Back in May, she told TVLine that it needed to happen this upcoming season. “Chris and I were talking about it, and it’s time,” she said. “It’s time now for us. This was a long time not being in each other’s universe. That’s why we did the calls and stuff like that. But we’re excited to get back in there, get back in the ring.”\n\nMore: Here’s who’s joining Law & Order SVU for Season 26\n\nWhether that leads to the romance some people are waiting for or not remains to be seen, but most people will agree that either way, it will be great to have Hargitay and Meloni sharing a screen once again.\n\nLaw & Order: Organized Crime is the sixth spin-off in Dick Wolf’s Law & Order franchise. It follows former SVU‘s Detective Elliot Stabler as he returns to the NYPD to battle organized crime after his wife’s murder.\n\nEpisodes of Law & Order: Organized Crime can be streamed on Peacock."
