        "text": "In his Reddit AMA, Wicked City actor Jeremy Sisto recalled his relationship with his first actress girlfriend, Reese Witherspoon. (Getty Images/Getty Images)\n\nThe cutest trip down memory lane! Wicked City actor Jeremy Sisto conducted his Reddit Ask Me Anything on Monday and revealed what it was like to date his first actress girlfriend, Reese Witherspoon.\n\nSisto, now 41, met Witherspoon on the 1992 TV-movie drama Desperate Choices: To Save My Child. In it, a then-unknown Witherspoon, now 39, portrayed a teenage girl whose life turns upside down when when she’s diagnosed with leukemia. A fan brought up the movie and Sisto’s subsequent real-life relationship with the future Legally Blonde star.\n\nPHOTOS: Reese’s style through the years\n\nBruce Davison, Reese Witherspoon, Joanna Kerns in 1992’s Desperate Choices: To Save My Child. (Everett Collection)\n\n“You played the boyfriend of a then-unknown Reese Witherspoon in the TV-movie Desperate Choices: To Save My Child,” the AMA user wrote. “Again, what was it like working with her?”\n\nPHOTOS: Costar couples\n\n“Great,” Sisto replied. “She was my first actress girlfriend. We had a long distance relationship for a long time. I was so into her.”\n\nBut, like every great romance, theirs ended — with some miscommunication.\n\n“Then she went to Africa to do a movie,” he recalled of Witherspoon’s 1993 film, A Far Off Place. “And i guess i thought she had broken up with me because she didn’t call that much, so i moved on and met my ex-wife Marisa [Ryan]. When she returned, i found out that wasn’t her intention but i had already gotten involved. Felt badly. She’s a great person.”\n\nPHOTOS: How these celeb couples first met\n\nThough the exes cleared the air, they almost had a near reunion on the 1995 set of Clueless. The cult classic’s writer-director, Amy Heckerling, shared this past summer in As If!: The Oral History of Clueless, that Alicia Silverstone faced some strong contenders for the role of Cher.\n\n“I had my heart set on Alicia. [But] Fox … wanted me to explore all the [options],” Heckerling wrote. “Then they go, ‘You’ve got to see the girl in [Flesh and Bone].’ I never got to see her. I guess she was off on other things. That turned out to be Gwyneth Paltrow.”\n\nPHOTOS: '90s nostalgia pictures\n\nThere was also Witherspoon. “I met with Reese because everyone said, 'This girl’s amazing. She’s going to be huge.’ I saw some movie where she had a southern accent. Maybe it was on TV, a movie of the week. But I did see some scenes of hers and went, 'Wow. She’s amazing.’ But Alicia is Cher.”"
