        "text": "Jeremy is known for his candid acting and his humor in some of the famous sitcoms like ‘Suburgatory’. Jeremy Sisto is the 70s kid who has had a typical life being born to parents Reedy Gibbs and Richard Sisto, who belong to the Art industry. Jeremy's father Richard was a Jazz musician and his mother, an actress. So it was typical and obvious of Jeremy to develop a keen interest in acting and he did so in his career. Born in Grassvalley California, Sisto moved to Chicago along with his mother Reedy and his sister after his parents divorced. He went to Francis W. Park School and his interest in acting began from there.\n\nSisto born on 6th of October, 1974, was seen on several commercials during his teens and his mother was working as an actor during his stay with her. It led him to pursue his career seriously into acting and hence he chose to attend UCLA to better his acting skills. After which, he shifted base to Hollywood in pursuit of getting worthy roles. He kept auditioning for supporting roles and he is seen in a number of shows on television and movies playing the second fiddle to the protagonist. Jeremy’s first brush with the movies came about when he was just a teenager and it was for a supporting role which had big stars in it like Steve Martin and it was directed by Lawrence Kasdan.\n\nAfter this movie, doors opened for Jeremy who was seen in many supporting role characters on the telly. During the early 1990s, he appeared in Desperate Choices: To Save My Child and The Shaggy Dog. But his role as an affluent teen named Elton in 1995’s show ‘Clueless’ got him a platform in Hollywood. He went on to appear in The Day Lincoln Got Shot and hit sitcom playing a God in a miniseries by CBS called ‘Jesus’, where he plays the title role. In some minor roles, he was seen in movies like ‘Hideaway’ playing Vasago, Frank in White Squall, Malcolm in Playing By Heart and T.K. in Suicide Kings.\n\nBut it was the role of Jack in the iconic and unforgettable movie ‘Titanic’ that got away. Jeremy did an audition for the role of Jack, but it ultimately went to Leonardo to DiCaprio. Jeremy’s acting career was shared between the small screen and the big one. He was seen as a guest star in many television series during the 2000s and also in movies. He was seen in some of the shows like The Outer Limits, The Twilight Zone for two episodes and Dawson’s Creek in 2003. It's his ability to portray different and unique roles on screen that got him the desired attention. He is seen in comedy, drama, and also in horrors and thrillers.\n\nHis movies released were also of different kinds. His movies A Lot Like Love, Wrong Turn and ‘Thirteen’ are some of the famous ones to recall. He is also seen in the horror Flick Unknown where he plays the guy who was handcuffed, Bobby. Jeremy is seen in over fifty films briefly and all of them were appreciated for his incredible acting skills and critically applauded. Jeremy played the role of Billy Chenowith in 2005 show Six Feet Under , and it got him many fans and also success. This HBO drama series which ran for five years till 2005 got him closer to the people. He was even nominated collectively for Outstanding Performance By An Ensemble at the Screen Actors Guild Awards.\n\nHe was also seen in The Movie Hero, which is a light-hearted comedy with a blend of romance in it. His acting also flourished and he became popular in a play by Richard Greenberg called Take Me Out. Jeremy’s skillful role of a baseball player coming out of the closet (as homosexual), was widely appreciated. And it is said that it is nominated for LA Drama Critics Circle Award. His another famous role on a television show is a cop aka a Detective Cyrus Lupo in Law And Order.\n\nHe was seen on the show for three seasons until the year 2010. While on this show, Jeremy was also seen in a season of the show ‘ Kidnapped ’ which aired in 2007 but it was shut down later. He goes on to voice Batman in one of the Justice League movies and appears in few episodes of My Boys and ‘Numbers’ before his even bigger break on television. From 2011 to the next three years, till 2014, he was seen in ABC productions’ show Suburgatory. In this hit show which has Jeremy in over 75 episodes, he became famous and was also appreciated for the role of George Altman.\n\nAltman is a divorcee and is seen along co-stars Cheryl Heins. This portrayal fetched him a nomination at Critics Choice Awards for Jeremy. As versatile as he can be, Jeremy was cast in a movie based on tennis and he had to undergo intense training for that. The movie ‘Breakpoint’ (2015), has Jeremy playing a tennis player struggling to qualify in the mixed doubles category. Jeremy was also seen as Jack Roth in TV horror series Wicked City during the same year wherein he plays a cop yet again.\n\nHis next and upcoming work has Jeremy doing the awfully scary and horrifying movie The Other Side Of The Door, which released the trailer in 2016 earlier. The story involves a trip to India and nothing much is disclosed. Jeremy is twice married with two kids but is rumored to have been dating some of his co-workers.\n\nHis first marriage was when he and her (his wife Marisa Ryan) were just 18 and they split very quickly. His second marriage was to Addie Lane and the marriage took place in 2009. The couple has two kids and Jeremy continues his acting in Hollywood. He likes Italian bowling or so is said about him and likes to play guitar during his leisure."
