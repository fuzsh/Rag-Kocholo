In the same year, he starred in the short-lived NBC drama series Kidnapped, top-lined the direct-to-video mystery horror film Population 436, and starred in the crime-thriller film Unknown.

That same year, he appeared as Earl Hunterson opposite Keri Russell in the comedy-drama film Waitress.\n\nIn 2008, Sisto joined the cast of the NBC crime drama series Law & Order, as Detective Cyrus Lupo, replacing Milena Govich's Detective Nina Cassady as the partner of Jesse L. Martin's Ed Green. Sisto had already appeared on the show, as a lawyer, in the previous season's finale. Sisto stayed on for the series' next three seasons, and his character became partners with Anthony Anderson's Detective Kevin Bernard after Martin left the series near the end of season 18. Also in 2008, Sisto starred in the drama film Gardens of the Night, and voiced the role of Batman in the direct-to-video film Justice League: The New Frontier. In 2009, he played a Catholic priest, alongside Kristin Chenoweth as a prostitute, in the independent drama film Into Temptation. The following year, he starred in the Manhattan Theatre Club production of Spirit Control at the New York City Center, gaining rave reviews for his performance as Adam Wyatt.\n\n2011–present: Suburgatory, screenwriting debut and FBI\n\nFrom 2011 to 2014, Sisto starred in the ABC comedy series Suburgatory, which premiered on September 28, 2011. He played the role of George Altman, the divorced father of the series' main character, for three seasons, after which the series was cancelled.

In 2015, Sisto produced and starred as Aaron Miller in the British thriller film Hangman, which had its premiere at South by Southwest. That same year, he joined the cast of ABC's crime drama series Wicked City. Sisto portrayed Detective Jack Roth, an LAPD officer searching for a serial killer on the Sunset Strip. The role was originally portrayed by Adam Rothenberg, but after the series was given its premiere date, the role was recast. It was poorly received by critics and was cancelled by ABC after airing only three episodes following weak ratings.\n\nSisto was then cast alongside Archie Panjabi in ABC's drama pilot The Jury, but the project was not picked up to series. From 2016 to 2018, Sisto starred as Freddy Green in Antoine Fuqua's Audience Network drama series Ice, opposite Cam Gigandet and Donald Sutherland.
