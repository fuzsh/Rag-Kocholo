Emmy Award winner Dick Wolf and the team behind the Law & Order franchise.\n\nFBI follows a typical crime-procedural format, similar to shows like Law & Order, CSI, and Criminal Minds.\n\nThe series focuses on the day-to-day operations of the Federal Bureau of Investigation's field office in New York City.\n\nFeaturing an ensemble cast, multiple special agents interact with one another and work together to solve crimes.\n\n\"This elite unit brings to bear all their talents, intellect, and technical expertise on major cases in order to keep New York and the country safe,\" as described by CBS,\n\nThe agents investigate a variety of cases, ranging from organized crime and counterintelligence to terrorism and serial killers.\n\nThe show premiered on September 25, 2018, with a 22-episode first season that concluded on May 14, 2019.\n\nSince then, the show has remained on air for five seasons, with only the occasional hiatus due to the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020 and the SAG-AFTRA and Writer's Guild strikes in 2023.\n\nUnlike other shows in the Dick Wolf universe, like the Chicago One franchise, viewers seldom learn about the characters' personal lives, and primarily see them only at the office or in the field.\n\nHowever, the show's sixth season may usher in some changes to the show, like showing the agents' lives outside of work.\n\nHow can I watch?\n\nThe much-awaited sixth season of FBI premieres on Tuesday, February 13, 2024.\n\nThe show typically airs weekly on CBS at 8 pm ET.\n\nIt will be followed by the season three premiere of FBI: International at 9 pm ET, and the season five premiere of FBI: Most Wanted at 10 pm ET.\n\nFans of the hit series can also catch up (or rewatch!) the first five seasons on Paramount+.\n\nAll 100 episodes are currently available on
