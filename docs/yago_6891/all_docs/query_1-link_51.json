        "text": "After creating the Law & Order and Chicago franchises for NBC, producer Dick Wolf is building another television universe on CBS with the hit show FBI, billed as \"a fast-paced drama about the inner workings of the New York office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.\" The procedural, which premiered in 2018, has proven so successful that CBS has given the green light to two spinoffs so far: FBI: Most Wanted premiered in 2020, and FBI: International got a series order the following year, per Deadline.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFBI's success is good news for its cast members, especially because many of them have families to support. Lead star Missy Peregrym, for starters, had her first child after the show's second season wrapped. (Sharp-eyed viewers might have spied Peregrym's baby belly hiding under her character's bulletproof vest.)\n\nAnd she's not the only FBI star who's married with children. Scroll down to check out which cast members show are partnered and which are parents!\n\nMissy Peregrym, who plays Agent Maggie Bell on the show, tied the knot with Australian actor Tom Oakley in a small wedding in Los Angeles in December 2018 with her Goldendoodle, Charly, in attendance, as People reported at the time. The actress showed off her Vivienne Westwood gown and the groom's Ralph Lauren tux on Instagram a couple of days later. According to Oakley's IMDb profile, he appeared in the Australian TV shows Out of the Blue and All Saints and guest-starred in one episode of FX's American Horror Story.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn April 2020, Peregrym announced that she and Oakley had welcomed their first child, Otis Paradis Oakley, the month prior. In an Instagram post at the time, she shared a photo of Otis sleeping with his head on her shoulder. \"These afternoon naps are the greatest feeling in the world,\" she said.\n\nPeregrym, who's also famous for her roles in the TV show Rookie Blue and the film Stick It, was previously married to Shazam! actor Zachary Levi. She and Levi split in April 2015 after less than a year of marriage, per People.\n\nSela Ward, who starred on FBI's first season as Special Agent in Charge Dana Mosier, married entrepreneur Howard Sherman in 1992, according to the Mississippi Clarion Ledger.\n\nThe duo met on a blind date the previous year, but Ward was initially skeptical of Sherman's congressional ambitions. \"I was falling madly in love with her, and she said, 'Well, I'm the wrong woman for you,'\" he told the newspaper. The actress fell for Sherman before long, though, and they're now the parents of son Austin and daughter Anabella. \"He listened. He wanted to know me,\" she told Parade in 2011. \"I felt cherished. I was used to anger and chaos with men, but Howard is very gentle — kind, funny, even-keeled. Even before we kissed, and he's a great kisser, he had me.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe couple stayed in Los Angeles for two and a half decades before they sold their Bel-Air home in 2016 and started living full-time on their 500-acre property, Honeysuckle Farms, in her hometown of Meridian, Mississippi, per the Clarion Ledger. Sherman finally ran for one of Mississippi's U.S. Senate seats in 2018, but he lost in the Democratic primary runoff, according to Ballotpedia.\n\nAlana de la Garza, who plays Special Agent in Charge Isobel Castille, married Michael Roberts in 2008, per People. Roberts was a stuntman for Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Alias before an injury took him out of that profession, according to The Hollywood Reporter. He became a screenwriter, and in 2013, CBS Films optioned Olivia Twisted, a script Roberts wrote as a spin on the Charles Dickens novel Oliver Twist.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe couple welcomed son Kieran Thomas in 2010 and daughter Liv Elena three years later. \"I love seeing my son with a look of adoration at his new 'baby sista,'\" de la Garza told People nearly three months after Liv's arrival. \"I love seeing my husband cuddle our children, and I love looking at my kids and feeling like our family is complete.\"\n\nShe described motherhood as her \"most challenging role\" in that People interview but also expressed gratitude for her brood: \"In life, the most important thing to me is family. Everything else comes and goes, but your family stays — changing and evolving — but they are permanent.\"\n\nJohn Boyd and his wife, Nicole Vicius, both appeared on a Dick Wolf show long before his FBI days: She guest-starred on Law & Order in 1998, while he appeared on the series in 2005 and 2006, according to his IMDb profile. Vicius' filmography also includes a seven-episode arc on the daytime drama All My Children and small roles in the films Half Nelson and 500 Days of Summer. The actress' last screen credit came in 2013, with the film Some Other Time, but she's still a regular presence on Boyd's Instagram page, where he chronicles their life as the parents of three young children.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBoyd also paid tribute to Vicius in a Mother's Day 2019 Instagram post, writing, \"The sky could be falling and you wouldn't skip a beat. Fierce. The way you can show them they are loved and seen and heard, no matter what is going on, is nothing short of incredible. Thank you for bringing these lives into our world. And for everything you do. I love you, mama.\"\n\nThe couple tied the knot in Los Angeles in June 2012, according to their registry on The Knot.\n\nZeeko Zaki, the actor behind FBI's Agent Omar Adom \"OA\" Zidan, is in a relationship with Sam Schneiter, as seen on their Instagram accounts. In November 2020, Zaki posted photos from their trip to Mohonk Lake in New York, not too long before Schneiter uploaded travel photos of the two of them in Antigua. And in January 2021, Zaki shared a photo of the two of them with the caption, \"Us with the dog Sam didn't get me for my birthday.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to her since-removed website, Schneiter is a content creator and a carbonara enthusiast. \"Life is a gallery of pictures in which there are few originals and many copies,\" she says in her bio. \"I strive to create original content that has the power to elicit an emotional response. ... I love making pasta and I love making art. Same thing, right?\"\n\nAs a photographer, Schneiter has captured images for the brands Poppy Bikinis, Blue&Cream, and Stone Island, as was seen in her since-removed online portfolio. She can also list collaborations with Lady Foot Locker, Secret deodorant, Conway Electric, and Guess.\n\nJeremy Sisto plays Assistant Special Agent in Charge Jubal Valentine on FBI, a role that reunites him with former Law & Order co-star Alana de la Garza.\n\nOff screen, Sisto has a family with wife Addie Lane. The duo tied the knot in New York City in 2009 with then-4-month-old daughter Charlie in attendance, according to People. Sisto and Lane welcomed their second child in March 2012 but waited to name the newborn Bastian until a month after his birth. \"He felt like a 'B' somehow ... and we went for the B's,\" Sisto explained to People at the time. \"Like that NeverEnding Story movie — [the protagonist's] name was Bastian.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe actor revealed a bit more about Lane in 2012, as he gave Us Weekly a list of fun facts about his life — saying, for example, that she's an \"amazing horseback rider\" and a former model who once posed for a trucker calendar. \"I'm certain my wife has saved my life and will again,\" he added.\n\nSisto was previously married to actress Marisa Ryan, according to People."
