        "text": "In 1992, Jeremy Sisto only had eyes for Reese Witherspoon.\n\nThe pair, then just cute teenagers, co-starred in the TV drama “Desperate Choices: To Save My Child.” But on Monday during a Reddit Ask Me Anything chat, Sisto, 41, explained why their love went south.\n\n“It was great. She was my first actress girlfriend,” the “Clueless” alum said when asked what it was like working with Witherspoon. “We had a long distance relationship for a long time. I was so into her.”\n\nBut their romance took a hit after Witherspoon booked a movie, “A Far Off Place” according to Us Weekly, which was shot on another continent.\n\n“Then she went to Africa to do a movie. And I guess I thought she had broken up with me because she didn’t call that much so I moved on and met my ex-wife Marisa [Ryan],” Sisto recalled. “When she returned I found out that wasn’t her intention but I had already gotten involved.”\n\nLooking back, Sisto said he “felt badly” about it, but that she’s a “great person.”"
