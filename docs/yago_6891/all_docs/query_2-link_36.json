        "text": "Who is the FBI Cast Dating and Married to in Real Life?\n\nWhile there is little room for romance on FBI due to the fast-paced nature of the CBS procedural, thankfully that’s not the case for many of the actors’ personal lives. Who is the FBI cast dating? Here’s who the cast is dating or married to in real life.\n\nFBI is CBS’ fictional crime drama, produced by Dick Wolf, that follows the special agents at the New York office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The elite team investigates the most dangerous criminal cases, including terrorism, organized crime and counterintelligence. The series premiered in 2018 and is currently in its fifth season. CBS ordered two FBI spin-offs, FBI: Most Wanted in 2020 and FBI: International in 2021 (and the three shows often do crossover episodes).\n\nWho is the FBI cast dating? Read on the learn about the real-life partners of your favorite FBI characters, including Missy Peregrym, Zeeko Zaki, John Boyd, Shantel VanSanten and more.\n\nMissy Peregrym (Maggie Bell)\n\nActress Missy Peregrym, who plays the lead in FBI as special agent Maggie Bell, has been married twice. She tied the knot with her first husband, actor Zachary Levi (Shazam!, Tangled, The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel) in 2014 in Hawaii, before divorcing nine months later in 2015. Los Angeles Superior Court documents cited the reason for their split as “irreconcilable differences,” and Peregrym legally changed her name back to her maiden name.\n\nMissy then started dating Australian actor Tom Oakley, who’s appeared in projects like Out of the Blue, All Saints and American Horror Story. They got married on December 30, 2018, in Los Angeles, according to People. “It was an intimate and fun evening shared with family and close friends,” sources told the publication, adding that “of course” Peregrym’s goldendoodle Charly took part in the celebration. Missy and Tom welcomed their first son, Otis Paradise Oakley, on March 21, 2020, and their daughter, Mela Joséphine Oakley, two years later on June 6, 2022. The actress took her second maternity leave from FBI at the end of Season 4 to the beginning of Season 5.\n\nZeeko Zaki (Omar Adom ‘OA’ Zidan)\n\nZeeko Zaki, who plays Omar Adom ‘OA’ Zidan, is engaged to his now-fiancée, Renee Monaco, a digital content creator. In May 2023, Entertainment Tonight spoke with Zaki about his proposal, which finally happened when the couple traveled to Morocco and went on a romantic camel ride. “I don’t think she had any idea that it was gonna happen there, but I was not gonna waste a camel ride into the desert, so it was definitely the moment, and it was a dream come true,” Zaki told ET’s Rachel Smith.\n\nThe actor also said that he could not remember what he said to Monaco during the proposal – as he did not plan out his comments beforehand. “It’s so funny that’s the one thing that I didn’t prepare because I was like, ‘It will come to me in the moment,’” he added. “I don’t know why I didn’t prepare something because every line I’ve spoken in the past five years has been written for me, so I feel like I should have at least put in a little more there, but it was so magical. It was unbelievable.” On her Instagram with more than 220K followers, his fiancée shared a video of the picturesque engagement and captioned the post: “Don’t mess with me I’m marrying an FBI agent.”\n\nJohn Boyd (Stuart Scola)\n\nJohn Boyd, who portrays FBI agent Stuart Scola, married his wife Nicole Vicius in 2012. The FBI actor has chosen to keep his wife and family out of the public eye but occasionally shares photos of his wife and kids on his Instagram page (which he mostly dedicates to FBI photos). For example, he posted one of the only photos of his wife nearly a decade ago back in February 2014. More recently, he shared an Instagram photo of him and his three kids on June 25, 2017.\n\nShantel VanSanten (Nina Chase)\n\nFBI and Hallmark actress Shantel VanSanten, who portrays Nina Chase, is currently going through a divorce. She married her husband, actor and fellow Hallmark star Victor Webster, in 2021. The pair had a weekend of celebrations, starting with a civil ceremony at Pasadena City Hall in California on August 9, 2021 — VanSanten’s grandparents’ wedding date, according to Brides. The second wedding celebration was in October 2021 in Napa Valley, California, while the third was in Luverne, Minnesota, so VanSanten’s elderly family could attend.\n\nBut less than two years later, Webster filed for divorce from VanSanten in January 2023 and listed the date of their separation as January 10, according to court documents obtained by People. In June 2023, Us Weekly reported that VanSanten and Webster “are in mediation and any issues regarding spousal support will be determined” through that process. VanSanten also requested that the court acknowledge that she and Webster had yet to decide on how to allocate their shared assets. “The determination and distribution of community and quasi-community property to be determined in mediation,” the filing stated.\n\nJeremy Sisto (Jubal Valentine)\n\nJeremy Sisto, best known for playing Jubal Valentine on FBI, is currently married to Addie Lane. The pair tied the knot in October 2009 in city hall. They have two children together: a 14-year-old daughter named Charlie and a 10-year-old son named Bastian. In an interview with the Rachel Ray Show in October 2022, the actor explained why his daughter Charlie started using his wife’s last name instead of his own. “I think it’s because she’s got a really cool last name. My wife’s name is Addie Lane,” he explained. “Charlie Lane, it makes you immortal. You’re a street name. And it could also be because she’s embarrassed of me.”\n\nIn the 1990s, Sisto was previously married to actress Marisa Ryan (Sex and the City, Major Dad, Wet Hot American Summer) for several years. They divorced in 2002 after nine years of marriage. The couple didn’t have any children together.\n\nAlana de la Garza (Isobel Castille)\n\nAlana de la Garza, who joined FBI in Season 2 as Isobel Castille, Special Agent in Charge, married her long-time boyfriend, Michael Roberts in May 2008. They share two children together. Their son, Kieran, was born in September 2010, while their daughter, Liv Elena, was born in July 2013. “It feels like our little family is complete. She’s been here a week and I just can’t imagine our lives without her,” the former Law & Order actress told People shortly after Liv was born.\n\nShe added that Kieran was so excited to be a big brother. “He was so excited and in awe! He kept kissing her forehead and saying ‘Baby sista’s not in Mama’s belly anymore!’” she said at the time. “It was one of the sweetest things I’ve ever seen and most proud I’ve ever been.”"
