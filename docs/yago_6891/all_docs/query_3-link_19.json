        "text": "While not a marquee name, actor Jeremy Sisto rightfully earned a solid reputation in dozens of supporting and leading man roles. Sisto made his feature film debut while still in high school, playing Kevin Kline's son in Lawrence Kasdan's ensemble drama, \"Grand Canyon\" (1991). He quickly racked up a number of supporting roles opposite Hollywood's most popular names in such high-profile films as \"Clueless\" (1995) and \"White Squall\" (1996). Recognized for a calm intensity he brought to his characters, he went on to win the title role of the messiah in the biblical drama \"Jesus\" (CBS, 2000), opposite the likes of Jacqueline Bisset and Gary Oldman. Sisto gained further recognition for his recurring role on all five seasons of \"Six Feet Under\" (HBO, 2001-05) as Billy Chenoweth, the emotionally troubled brother of Brenda (Rachel Griffiths). During that time he took the lead in another sweeping television biopic, this time as the Roman emperor \"Caesar\" (TNT, 2002). Equally convincing as world leaders and working stiffs, he was suitably detestable as Keri Russell's boorish husband in the winning dramedy, \"Waitress\" (2007) and always dependable as homicide detective Cyrus Lupo on the seminal crime drama, \"Law & Order\" (NBC, 1990-2010). In one of his lighter roles, Sisto later starred as a fish-out-of-water single father on the quirky sitcom, \"Suburgatory\" (ABC, 2011-14). Adept at both intense drama and raucous comedy, Sisto enjoyed a robust acting career, as prolific as it was diverse."
