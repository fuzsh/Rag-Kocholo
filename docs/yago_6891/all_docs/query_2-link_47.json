So, I moved on and met my ex-wife Marisa (Ryan). When (Witherspoon) returned I found out that wasn't her intention, but I had already gotten involved. Felt badly. She's a great person.\"\n\nJeremy ended up eloping with Marisa and exchanging vows in Las Vegas in August, 1993, but the union didn't last - the young couple split just two days later, although they didn't get a divorce until 2002. He has since settled down with second wife Addie Lane, who he wed in 2009."
