        "text": "As an eighteen-year-old, John Landis (b. 1950) got a job in the mailroom at 20th Century Fox, only after he had his hair cut and promised to wear a tie. Most of the legendary filmmakers he met in those days, like George Stevens, Alfred Hitchcock, William Wyler, and Billy Wilder, were all still alive—and working—and they had been in films since the silents, so he had this amazing wealth of experience to draw on. ‘I started working at Fox when they were making “Hello, Dolly!” They were doing “Beneath the Planet of the Apes” and George Cukor was there directing “Justine.” The lot was filled with actors and extras, all in different kinds of costumes. You had the showgirls, the African natives, the spacemen; they were all there—just like when you see them in those old documentaries about the Hollywood studios. The Fox backlot was a very unique and exciting place. It is Century City now, but back then, it was just so fabulous, with jungles, rocket ships, railroad stations… You name it, they had it!’ Mr. Landis says enthusiastically in an extremely lively conversation, filled with laughter and some occasional cursing.\n\nMeeting with Mr. Landis was a pretty unique experience since he—as a true film buff—breathes film all the way. Movies are his way of living: he’s a film encyclopedia on his own, passionate about film as anyone you’d ever wish to talk to about his craft and about the history of American cinema.\n\nFrom the Fox mailroom, he worked his way up to become one of the most prominent filmmakers of his generation with several blockbuster hit movies in the 1970s and 1980s, and in between, he directed Michael Jackson in his “Thriller” (1983) and “Black or White” (1991) music videos. But first, let’s go back to his early days at Fox.\n\nSo Mr. Landis, you met with all those awesome and influential screen veterans like George Stevens when you were even still a teenager?\n\nYes! George Stevens was making his final movie, “The Only Game in Town” [1970] with Elizabeth Taylor and Warren Beatty. It took place in Las Vegas, they shot it in Paris because of Miss Taylor’s tax situation, but they also did a few things on the Fox lot. So all of a sudden, there I saw George Stevens walking to the commissary, and I said to him, ‘Excuse me, Mr. Stevens.’ ‘Yeah?!’ ‘I’m sorry, but I’m such an admirer of yours.’ He then looked at me and asked, ‘You’re such an admirer of me? How old are you?’ ‘I’m seventeen.’ ‘What? You’re seventeen, and you’re an admirer of mine? Name five films I directed.’ So I went “Alice Adams” [1935], “A Place in the Sun” [1951], “Shane” [1953], “Giant” [1956], “The Diary of Anne Frank” [1959], and “The Greatest Story Ever Told” [1965]. Then he asked, ‘Have you seen those movies?’ I said, ‘Yes sir. And I know that you started as a cameraman, and you worked with Laurel and Hardy.’ And then he said, ‘You’re so young, and you’re not even French!’ [Laughs.] It was so funny! Back then, I didn’t know what it meant of course, to him I was just this young American jerk. Anyway, that was my encounter with George Stevens.\n\nAnd now, with your latest feature, “Burke and Hare,” you seem to be drawn to England to make movies there again. What’s the attraction?\n\nWell, I’m drawn to anywhere that I’m offered a job, and I like the country a lot. They speak English over there; it’s a big advantage for me.\n\nWere you in any way influenced by the Ealing comedies?\n\nWell, the great Ealing comedies were all very dark. My favorite is “Kind Hearts and Coronets” [1949] which is a very witty film about a serial killer, and in another one of them, “The Ladykillers” [1955, both starring Alec Guinness], the entire cast has murdered one another by the end of the film. Have you ever seen “The Man in the White Suit” [1951], this one is just great. I mean, they made real dark comedies. After Ealing went out of business, their very small studio—only three or four soundstages—was used by the BBC. It was there that they shot all the Monty Python television shows [1969-1974]. About ten years ago a man bought it as a real estate deal, and now they’re using the studio again to make movies. And when I met this man, he told me he got a script he wanted me to read. What attracted me in “Burke and Hare,” was that those men were absolutely despicable, terrible, really loathsome people. It’s completely inappropriate material for a romantic comedy. So the challenge was to take those villains and make them likable. I know that’s perverted, but it was a challenge.\n\nDid you also shoot in the Ealing studio?\n\nYes, but only for one day: the interior of the prison was the only set we used there. All the rest was shot on location.\n\nSo you accepted this script because it was a challenge. Are there any other standards you might use to make a movie?\n\nFirst of all, somebody has to give you the money to make it. There are a lot of good scripts out there. You know, a script is a strange thing: it’s a bastard because it’s not literature, and it’s not a film. I have seen very great screenplays made into terrible movies, and I’ve seen terrible screenplays made into great films. Ultimately, the director is the one who is making the film. A lot of great screenwriters became directors—Billy Wilder and Preston Sturges became directors because they were so upset when they saw what was done to their scripts. But for me, it depends. I just care if the script is good. I read a lot of stuff, and a lot of it is bad. On the one hand, I’m lucky; I have made a lot of movies and a lot of them made a lot of money. So I don’t have to work. But on the other hand, it’s frustrating because if you want to try anything risky, it’s very difficult. The studios are very conservative; it’s all about presales, marketing, franchising, and serials now. Filmmaking has become an international corporate business, the bottom line is totally different now, so there are only very few directors left, like Steven Spielberg, George Lucas, and Clint Eastwood, who still make movies like we all did in the 1970s and 1980s. But the studios don’t make small pictures anymore, because their films have to play all over the world. No wonder you get the “Spider-Man” and “Transformers” kind of movies. Some of them are very good though, like the “Harry Potter” movies which I love. It’s a different time now, and the films reflect it.\n\nYou talk about marketing. How big an issue is it?\n\nEverything has to do with marketing! And I understand that: the cost of marketing a movie now is so huge that they don’t want to take a risk. When a studio makes a movie, it has to open in Buenos Aires, and Bruges, and Tokyo—and it needs to make money, so the audience has to show up. Consequently, marketing a movie is so prohibitively expensive now. Take, for example, “The King’s Speech” [2010]. The movie cost about nine million dollars to make, a very inexpensive movie made in the U.K. But Harvey Weinstein spent like thirty-five million dollars in the United States to promote it, and he’ll make a nice return, but it’s not enough for a studio. At the end of the day, he might make fifteen or twenty million dollars. You might think that’s a lot, but not for a studio; that’s nothing. Keep in mind that Warner Bros. is one percent of Time Warner, and Columbia is just a small portion of Sony. These are massive multinational companies that own the studios, and that’s a real problem.\n\nWould you be able to run a studio?\n\nIf I wouldn’t have to make a profit, sure! The studios are all run by businesses, and there’s nobody in charge. There are layers and layers—it’s like committees. It’s very difficult to make movies that way. I mean, last year “The Social Network” [2010] came out, it was great, and it’s amazing, almost like a miracle that this picture came through. But in the 1970s and 1980s, Hollywood made so many great movies like that, “Midnight Cowboy” [1969], “Network” [1976]—there were just so many great movies, most of which no studio would make now. A few years after I had made “Animal House” [1978], Costa-Gavras made “Missing” [1982] for Universal, with Jack Lemmon. A great film; there’s no studio that would even touch that movie now. And talking about marketing, look at what is happening in France. I was in Paris recently for my movie; there are over two hundred and forty French films made every year. So what happens is this: they don’t have enough theaters! That’s a problem. Another problem is, and this is international, if your film doesn’t reach its audience within its first three days, you’re out of there. I have made a lot of movies that made more money in their second or third weekend. That can’t happen anymore. So it’s a very difficult thing. I wish there was an easy answer, but there isn’t. Having a star in your movie can help your movie at the box office, but then what? Someone told me this morning, ‘Well, you worked with big stars, you worked with Eddie Murphy and John Belushi?’ And I said, ‘Yes, but none of those people were big stars when I first worked with them.’\n\nAs a director, when you work with stars like Eddie Murphy, how do you keep these people with such big personalities controlled and constrained?\n\nWhen I made “Trading Places” [1983], Eddie Murphy was fabulous and very unsophisticated when it came to acting, but he’s just unbelievably gifted; he’s a genius mimic. He was great, and we had a great time. Five years later, we did “Coming to America.” Things had changed by then, but he’s not stupid. He did what I asked him to do. But I don’t know what had happened to him; we had a terrible fall-out when we did that movie. I’ve also worked with Sylvester Stallone and a lot of other big stars, and they do all what you ask them to do.\n\nWhat about Michael Jackson when you did “Thriller” and “Black or White”?\n\nHe was fabulous. Did you ever see ‘The Making of “Thriller”’ [1983]? That was very accurate; it was like working with a brilliant ten-year-old. I liked Michael; he was a hard worker and very professional. I’ve seen him many times performing live, and I can tell you, he was the greatest entertainer I have ever seen. I worked with everybody from Paul McCartney to James Brown—they all were giants, so amazingly talented, and you can’t teach talent. And Michael, he was a slender little guy, you could put your arm around him just like that, but when he was performing, you could not take our eyes off him. So much power!\n\nDo you know what makes someone a ‘star’?\n\nI don’t. There are so many stars, and I don’t even understand why they’re stars… You want to hear my theory? [Laughs.] Just look at the films made in Hollywood from 1924 for so many decades. They were so extraordinary! MGM made over fifty features a year for thirty-five years; Paramount made fifty features a year for forty years, Fox had sixty features a year. It’s unbelievable! And they were so good! Even a lot of the bad ones were very well made! And you know why they made such great films? Movies are only a hundred years old, it’s a brand-new business, and when they began making movies, the U.S. had about four thousand legit theaters—vaudeville, burlesque, music hall. You had these people like the Marx Brothers who performed for many years on stage. Groucho made his first movie when he was about forty years old; by then, he had spent over thirty years on stage. W.C. Fields—the same thing. Marie Dressler was almost fifty when she first appeared on the screen with Charlie Chaplin [in 1914]. Can you imagine?! Those people had these layers of the profession. When you look at people like Bob Hope, George Burns and all those guys, they could sing, they could dance, they could play an instrument, they could do comedy and drama—and that kind of training is gone. That experience is gone. I have worked with a lot of Hollywood actors from the Golden Age; they’re such a pleasure. William Holden and those guys; you have no idea how wonderful they all were. They never tripped on a cable, they always hit their mark, and they were always very camera-wise. Now, I think the best training is probably television because actors who come out of television series have a lot of experience with the camera. But if I would have made a movie in 1960 and I needed a leading man, look at my choices! If I make a movie now, the choices are more limited. But sure, there’s always real talent. I made a movie once, “Oscar” [1991] with Sylvester Stallone, and everybody who saw the movie and liked it, would never go out and see Stallone. We did a preview of the movie and someone wrote on the card, ‘Why didn’t he take his shirt off and kill anybody?’ [Laughs.] But we had an extraordinary cast; we had Kirk Douglas, Don Ameche, and a girl who had never been in a movie before: Marisa Tomei. She was so extremely great from the first day! And what had she done before? Practically nothing! Now, that’s talent. She was so unbelievably good.\n\nDo you think you got a specific style of your own?\n\nI’m always taking great pride in the fact that—I hope—I don’t have a style of my own. If you look at “The Blues Brothers” [1980], “Trading Places” [1983], or “Thriller” [1983], I hope people won’t say, ‘Those are made by the same director.’ Directors get typed very easily, just like actors. I always wanted to avoid that, and that’s why I tried to make very different films—one film totally different from the other. But the job of a director, whether you’re doing a comedy, a horror film, a musical—any genre really—the job is exactly the same: you try to tell your story as good as possible. I really don’t care about the genre when I’m making a film. Let me tell you something, I wrote “An American Werewolf in London” in 1969, but I made the film twelve years later. Why did it take me that long? People didn’t know what it was all about: was it funny, a comedy, or was it scary—a horror movie? I wanted it to be funny, but I don’t think it’s a comedy at all. It’s not a happy story; it’s a very tragic story. So when I do a film, the genre is of no importance to me. The story you’re trying to tell is what matters. Also, if you talk about genre films, most horror films are exploitation. The reason that so many directors, including myself, get started in exploitation is because that’s where the money is. Exploitation means you have an idea you can exploit, like a monster, for example. But you will always need a story; you don’t get anywhere if your movie is not in support of a story.\n\nWith your background and your experience, what advice would you give to young filmmakers?\n\nI don’t have to give advice. Anyone can make a film now. I remember when I was a teenager, it was very difficult to make movies. We had to make 8mm or 16mm movies, those were expensive. And now, with the new technologies, you can make a feature film for two hundred dollars. You can edit it on your laptop; it’s extraordinary. And the truth is, if you’re talented, you’ll be noticed. You know, from the beginning of cinema, from Thomas Edison to Georges Méliès, it’s always been called the movie business, or the industry. It’s never been called a craft! So it has always been about profit. So even now, what’s a good movie? In the real world, a good movie is one that makes a lot of money. But we know that really good movies fail all the time, and really bad movies are giant hits. But those directors get more money and go on. That’s just not fair. So to get back to your question: my only true advice to filmmakers would be, ‘Make films.’ Do you know the filmmaker Costa-Gavras? He’s my best friend. His wife Michèle [Michèle Ray-Gavras] is a producer and had a movie in competition in Cannes a couple of years ago. My wife [costume designer Deborah Nadoolman] was a member of the jury, so I also came to Cannes, and Costa was there too. We were the spouses; we were like the wives [laughs]. So we were walking on the Croisette, and I remember I told him, ‘Costa, do you realize that anyone can make a film now? People have cameras on their phones now; it can’t get any easier than that!’ The democratization of the medium is amazing. And I went on and on about it to him, and then Costa said, ‘John, there have been pencil and paper for a thousand years. And how many good books are there?’ [Laughs]. And you know, he’s right!\n\nWhat’s in your opinion so great about making movies?\n\nOne of the great things is that you get to go all over the world and work with all kinds of people. If I shoot a picture in London, Rome, New York, Chicago, there’s this amazing arm tray that you’d never have as a regular person. That’s one of the things I love. I have worked with American crews, French crews, Italian, German, Mexican—all kinds of people from anywhere, and what you learn is that people individually are exactly the same. That’s what is so interesting. In a group, they can be pretty scary, but on one to one, they’re kind of the same person with the same fears and the same desires.\n\nIn the late 1960s and early 1970s, you worked as a stuntman on a lot of movies…\n\n…you bet!\n\nDid you realize then that you wanted to become a film director?\n\nNo, I wanted to be a director from the time I was eight years old after I had seen “The 7th Voyage of Sinbad” [1958], my very first total movie-going experience. I’m sure this wasn’t the first movie I ever saw, but I still remember it very vividly. And to answer your question about being a stuntman, I know it must sound like a joke, but I accidentally fell into stunts. To make a long story short, one day, I was asked, ‘Do you do horse falls?’ And I said, ‘Yes…!’ And the next day was like, ‘Aaaahh!’ [Yells and laughs.] But actually, in the end, I got pretty good at it. I’m sure you’ve seen me being shot in so many movies. I only really got hurt once on some stupid Italian pirate movie [laughs] with Franco Nero, shot in Spain. We were supposed to jump from the mast into the ocean; there were eight of us. It was a good fifty feet, and I know I had asked, ‘Is it gonna hurt?’ I had my doubts, but I did it anyway, and as I was falling, I knew it was gonna hurt: it was like hitting concrete. I was all black and blue, really in pain. The last stunt I got paid for, I think, was in “Spider-Man 2” [2004]. I played the surgeon who was thrown onto the wall. But stunts have changed completely now. All through the history of American movies, stuntmen came from American rodeo. They were all real cowboys. Basically, it was a cowboy business, and these guys were tough. Now, most of the stuntmen are gymnasts. And because now it’s mostly digital, it takes the danger and so many risks away for ninety percent of it, so the digital revolution in cinema has changed it a lot for the better.\n\nWilliam Friedkin once told me, ‘There’s no movie ever made that is worth a squirrel getting a twisted ankle.’ So that’s the bottom line?\n\nAbsolutely. You took the words right out of my mouth!\n\nBrussels International Fantastic Film Festival, Brussels (Belgium)\n\nApril 13, 2011\n\n“The Blues Brothers” (1980, trailer)\n\nFILMS\n\nTHE GOOD, THE BAD & THE UGLY (1966) DIR Sergio Leone PROD Alberto Grimaldi SCR Sergio Leone, Furio Scarpelli, Agenore Incrocci, Luciano Vincenzoni (story by Sergio Leone, Luciano Vincenzoni) CAM Tonino Delli Colli ED Nino Baragli, Eugenio Alabiso MUS Ennio Morricone STUNT PERFORMER John Landis CAST Clint Eastwood, Eli Wallach, Lee Van Cleef, Aldo Giuffrè, Luigi Pistilli, Rada Rassimov, Enzo Petito\n\nTHE CHARGE OF THE LIGHT BRIGADE (1968) DIR Tony Richardson PROD Neil Hartley SCR Charles Wood CAM David Watkin ED Hugh Raggett MUS John Addison STUNT PERFORMER John Landis CAST Trevor Howard, Vanessa Redgrave, John Gielgud, Harry Andrews, Jill Bennett, David Hemmings, Ben Aris, Peter Bowles, Laurence Harvey, Joely Richardson, Natasha Richardson\n\nONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST (1968) DIR Sergio Leone PROD Fulvio Morsella SCR Sergio Leone, Sergio Donati (story by Sergio Leone, Dario Argento, Bernardo Bertolucci) CAM Tonino Delli Colli ED Nino Baragli MUS Ennio Morricone STUNT PERFORMER John Landis CAST Henry Fonda, Claudia Cardinale, Charles Bronson, Jason Robards, Jack Elam, Lionel Stander, Woody Strode, Gabrielle Ferzetti, Keenan Wynn, Fabio Testi\n\nKELLY’S HEROES (1970) DIR Brian G.
