        "text": "Jeremy Sisto had a crush on his \"Clueless\" costar, and although he and Alicia Silverstone never dated, his feelings were not wholly unrequited.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough Alicia Silverstone and Jeremy Sisto have successful careers filled with amazing projects, most fans will never forget them in the cult classic teen drama \"Clueless.\"\n\nSilverstone starred as the sassy and fashion-forward lead character, Cher, while Sisto portrayed Elton, an arrogant and wealthy student from Bronson Alcott High School.\n\nJeremy Sisto on \"Live With Kelly and Ryan\" in 2021 [Left] Sisto as Elton and Alicia Silverstone as Cher in the 1995 movie \"Clueless\" [Right] | Photo: YouTube/LIVEwithkellyandryan & Getty Images\n\nAlthough audiences rooted for Cher to end up with Josh (Paul Rudd), Silverstone and Sisto had crushes on each other in real life. However, they never dated.\n\nThe costars' feelings started while filming the 1995 film \"Hideaway.\" Sisto once recalled that they almost kissed during the film, but later on when filming \"Clueless,\" Sisto joked that she gave him the cold shoulder:\n\n\"But she ignored me when we were on Clueless because she was like, the star. No, I’m kidding.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDespite Silverstone ignoring him on set, Sisto revealed to The Post their mutual crushes might have had the opportunity to turn into a romance. However, there was one problem, they were both in relationships.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSisto was married to actress Marisa Ryan (they later divorced in 2002), and \"The Crush\" actress was dating Stephen Dorff, who she met filming a music video for the Aerosmith song \"Crying'\"\n\nJeremy Sisto arrives for the \"Frozen II\" Premiere, 2019, Hollywood, California. | Photo: Shutterstock\n\nThe costars might have flirted with the idea of being in a relationship but never acted on any feelings they had. But that is not to say Sisto did not enjoy his onscreen kiss with Silverstone in \"Clueless.\"\n\nFurthermore, Sisto once admitted to People Magazine that their kiss was a childhood dream come true, and he was sure his friends would have been jealous of him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYears later, Sisto and Silverstone reunited again as she guest-starred in four episodes of his ABC comedy \"Suburgatory\" in 2012. Their characters again shared a romantic story arch.\n\nSisto's character George met Silverstone's Eden at a local Farmer's Market. George was immediately smitten with her and impressed with her healthy eating habits.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo feeling Eden would make a fantastic role model for his daughter, Tessa, played by Jane Levy, Goerge pursues her, but perhaps in a relatively fast manner. At the time, Sisto remarked that audiences might feel old watching the \"Clueless\" costars together:\n\n\"[The reunion] is going to make some people feel a little old. I think it’s a great moment to see [us] back together.\"\n\nOf course, Sisto and Silverstone have grown up since their \"Clueless\" days. They both got married and welcomed children. Silverstone welcomed her son, Bear Blu, with her now-ex-husband, Christopher Jarecki.\n\nJeremy Sisto, and his children, Charlie Ballerina Sisto and Bastian Kick Sisto arrives for the \"Frozen II\" Premiere, 2019, Hollywood, California. | Photo: Getty Images\n\nAfter separating from his first wife, Sisto married his current wife, Addie Lane. The couple has two children, Charlie Ballerina, 12, and Bastian Kick, 9.\n\nSisto shared that the couple chose the name Kick after meeting costar Cheryl Hines' boyfriend's daughter, Kick. He felt a B name would go well with it, and so after going through the pages of baby name books, they settled on Bastian."
