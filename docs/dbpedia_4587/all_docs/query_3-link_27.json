        "text": "Harold Mayne Daly was a stockbroker and lawyer. He lived at 875 Chilco Street from 1911 to 1915. In 1915, he survived the sinking of the Lusitania.\n\nFamily Background\n\nHarold Mayne Daly was born at Stratford, Ontario, on April 23, 1880.\n\nHarold’s great-grandfather, John Corry Wilson Daly (1796-1878), was a merchant, politician and prominent citizen in Stratford, Ontario.\n\nHarold’s grandfather, Thomas Mayne Daly (1827- 1885) was a businessman, newspaper owner, and politician.\n\nHarold’s parents were Thomas Mayne Daly (1852-1911) and Margaret Annabella Jarvis (1852-1928). Thomas Mayne Daly was the federal minister of the interior from 1892 to 1896.\n\nEarly Life\n\nHarold began studying law at Brandon, Manitoba, probably with his father’s law firm.\n\nBy 1897, Harold’s father had set up a law practice in Rossland, British Columbia, along with Charles Robert Hamilton (1867-1938).\n\nIn 1898, Harold was a student at law with his father’s law firm in Rossland.\n\nHarold also worked with some of his father’s non-law businesses.\n\nOn February 8, 1900, Harold agreed to serve with Lord Strathcona’s Horse in the South African War, and he did serve until he was discharged on March 8, 1901. The 1901 Canada census indicated that Harold was a law student, living in Rossland along with his parents and his brother, Kenneth R. Daly.\n\nAfter Harold’s discharge, he wrote to the military authorities to ensure that he could collect all of the medals and awards that he was entitled to receive.\n\nShortly after Harold’s return to British Columbia, he became a lawyer. According to a story that Harold told in 1967, he was called to the bar without writing any law examinations, because the B.C. government of the time was “making gestures of that sort toward men who had been with the Canadian contingent raised to fight in the Boer War.”\n\nThe 1902 Vancouver directory listed Harold as a clerk with the law firm of Tupper, Peters and Gilmour. He was boarding at 1102 Seaton Street, which was the home of William Ernest Burns (1873-1946). Soon, Harold became a partner in a law firm with William Ernest Burns.\n\nIn 1905, Harold withdrew from the law firm to enter financial circles. He established a stockbroker and real estate business in Vancouver.\n\nBy 1909, Harold was also associated with the Glacier Creek Mining Company, Limited, which was attempting to develop lands on the Portland Canal, near Stewart, in northwestern British Columbia. (Gerald Trevor Johnstone Bevan, who lived at 2080 Haro Street in 1911, was the secretary of the company.)\n\nBy 1910, Harold had gone into business with Edward Arthur Chichester Studd (1880-1958), who lived at 1833 Comox Street in 1911.\n\nIn April 1910, the Vancouver and Edmonton newspapers announced Harold’s engagement to Grace Lowrey, who was the daughter of Mrs. Hayter Reed.\n\nThe Daly family had known Hayter Reed for several years.\n\nGrace Lowrey was born in New York on March 31, 1882. Her father was Grosvenor Porter Lowrey (1831-1893), a prominent lawyer who worked with many American corporations, including railroads, telegraphs, and Thomas Edison’s electrical enterprises.\n\nGrace Lowrey’s mother was Kate Armour, a daughter of John Douglas Armour (1830-1903), who was a lawyer and judge; Kate’s mother was Eliza Cory Clench (1834-1881). (Kate was a sister of Douglas Armour (1860-1927), a lawyer who lived at 875 Chilco Street in 1917 and 1918, and at 1898 Robson Street in 1920.)\n\nKate Armour’s granddaughter, Kate Reed, has created a website that describes Kate Armour’s life and work. Kate Reed: Decorator of Canada’s Grand Hotels: http://www.katereed.ca/. The website includes illustrations of Kate Armour’s family, along with some of the many hotel and mountain lodge interiors that she created in the early 1900s. (A book is also available for purchase, either on the website or in bookstores.)\n\nOn June 16, 1894, in Ottawa, Ontario, Kate Lowrey married Hayter Reed (1849-1936), who served for a time as the Deputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs, and who also worked for Canadian Pacific Railway hotels.\n\nKate later became well-known for decorating many of the Canadian Pacific hotels across Canada.\n\nThe wedding of Harold and Grace was at the Banff Hotel in Banff, Alberta, on August 31, 1910.\n\nAbout 1911, Harold built a small building in Vancouver called the Park Rooms. Maclure and Fox were the architects.\n\nDistrict: Vancouver Permit: Owner: Daly, H. M. Architect: Maclure & Fox Builder: Baynes & Horie Legal Address: DL: 541 Block: 14 Sub: Resub: Lot: 5 Date (Y-M-D): 1911-01-31 Street Number: 628 Street Name: Cordova Street Value: $12,000.00 Remarks: Brick stores & rooms Reference ID: VN-3200-3201-1000\n\nHeritage Vancouver Society Building Permits, 1901-1921, http://permits.heritagevancouver.org/, searched February 5, 2015.\n\nWar and the Lusitania\n\nAfter the First World War began, Harold became involved in the war effort, including getting the troops to vote in federal elections. One of his trips to Europe was on the Lusitania, which sank off the coast of Ireland on May 7, 1915, after a German U-boat torpedoed the ship. Unlike Kenneth John Morrison, who lived at 1829 Robson Street, Harold was able to escape from the ship. He later continued his political activities.\n\nTo Ottawa\n\nBy the end of the war, Harold was living in Ottawa. His brother, Kenneth R. Daly, was also living in Ottawa.\n\nHarold practiced as a lawyer in Ottawa. For a time he acted as a “parliamentary agent” in relation to amendments to the Trades Unions Act. In 1929, he was briefly in the news when he and Claire M. Moyer appeared at the Amalgamated Builders’ inquiry.\n\nLater Life\n\nIn the 1930s, Harold and Grace continued to live in Ottawa.\n\nGrace died in Montreal on Sunday, July 25, 1937. She left the income from her estate to Harold for life, and then the estate would go to Grace’s sisters.\n\nOn July 23, 1937, in New York City, Harold married Aline L. Fallon. She was born about 1898 in Atlanta, Georgia. Her parents were Richard H. Fallon and Kate Hargrove.\n\nHarold died in Ottawa on January 16, 1969.\n\nThere is a memorial to Harold in Pleasant Valley Cemetery in Dutchess, New York.\n\nAline died in 1991. There is a memorial to her in Pleasant Valley Cemetery in Dutchess, New York.\n\nSources\n\nJohn Corry Wilson Daly, (great- grandfather of Harold Mayne Daly)\n\nJohn Corry Wilson Daly, Wikipedia article, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Corry_Wilson_Daly\n\nDonald Swainson, “DALY, JOHN CORRY WILSON,” in Dictionary of Canadian Biography, vol. 10, University of Toronto/Université Laval, 2003–, accessed February 3, 2015, http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/daly_john_corry_wilson_10E.html.\n\nThomas Mayne Daly (grandfather of Harold Mayne Daly)\n\nThomas Mayne Daly, Sr., Wikipedia article, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Mayne_Daly,_Sr.\n\nDonald Swainson, “DALY, THOMAS MAYNE (1827-85),” in Dictionary of Canadian Biography, vol. 11, University of Toronto/Université Laval, 2003–, accessed January 30, 2015, http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/daly_thomas_mayne_1827_85_11E.html.\n\nDALY, Thomas Mayne, Parliament of Canada biography, http://www.parl.gc.ca/parlinfo/Files/Parliamentarian.aspx?Item=a47912a7-1945-4f11-be73-7a885f6baaee&Language=E&Section=ALL\n\n“Canada Census, 1871,” index, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/pal:/MM9.1.1/M476-H2L : accessed 3 February 2015), Thomas Mayne Daly, Stratford, North Perth, Ontario, Canada; citing p. 29, line 6; Library and Archives Canada film number C-9940, Public Archives, Ottawa, Ontario; FHL microfilm 4,396,682.\n\n“Find A Grave Index,” index, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/pal:/MM9.1.1/QVPS-7SMW : accessed 31 January 2015), Thomas Mayne Daly Sr., 1885; Burial, Stratford, Perth County, Ontario, Canada, Avondale Cemetery; citing record ID 135831739, Find a Grave, http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid=135831739.\n\nThomas Mayne Daly (father of Harold Mayne Daly)\n\nThomas Mayne Daly, Who’s Who in Western Canada, 1911, http://www.ourroots.ca/e/page.aspx?id=642987\n\nDaly Family Tree, Daly House Museum, http://www.dalyhousemuseum.ca/dalytree1.htm.\n\nThomas Mayne Daly, Wikipedia article, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Mayne_Daly.\n\nJohn Kendle, “DALY, THOMAS MAYNE (1852-1911),” in Dictionary of Canadian Biography, vol. 14, University of Toronto/Université Laval, 2003–, accessed January 30, 2015, http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/daly_thomas_mayne_1852_1911_14E.html.\n\nDALY, The Hon.

Daly, Ottawa Journal, July 11, 1964, page 2 [includes photograph of Harold M. Daly]: “In casting a retrospective eye over a full and sometimes exciting life, Ottawa lawyer Harold M. Daly, recalls sitting on the knee of Sir John A. Macdonald. It was in Room 17 of the House of Commons, and Sir John talked to his . . .[admirer] for half an hour. TOPS PMs Mr. Daly feels that Sir John tops the only three Canadian prime ministers with special . . .. They two others are Sir Charles Tupper ‘the Cumberland warhorse’ and the courtly Sir Wilfrid Laurier ‘who was a wonderful person.’ Mr. Daly has shaken hands with every prime minister since Confederation. . . Mr. Daly was aboard the Lusitania when it was torpedoed off the Head of Kinsale, Ireland. The ship had [1959] aboard, including the crew. Half of this number survived. Mr. Daly felt that as an officer in the Canadian Army he would-be among the last to leave the doomed vessel. He actually went down with the Lusitania. When he surfaced he was able to cling to a boat hook. He had been in the water for about an hour when he was picked up by a raft, one of a number which one of the passengers had cut loose as the ship was sinking. He was transferred from the raft to the trawler Bluebell and taken ashore little the worse for his misadventure.”\n\nScott Young, A Word for Longevity, Globe and Mail, February 6, 1967, page 6: “Mr. Daly must be one of the few men alive who has shaken hands with every prime minister Canada ever had.”\n\nHarold Mayne Daly (1880 – 1965), The Lusitania Resource, http://www.rmslusitania.info/people/saloon/harold-daly/. “Harold Mayne Daly (1880 – 1965), 35, a British subject from Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, was the son of Thomas Mayne Daly. Harold was going to England to deliver the Dominion Government ballot boxes. On board the Lusitania, he was assigned cabin D-4. His friends on board included Margaret, Lady Mackworth and Norman Ratcliff. . . .On the day of the disaster, Daly was playing solitaire, which another passenger had taught him to play. During the last few moments, he bought a cigar from the bartender who told him to get out. No sooner did Daly exit the door of the lounge, the water washed him overboard. He said the curious thing was that he was among a different set of people than who he had seen on deck when the ship sank, to which he attributed to the ship striking bottom, before she sank.”\n\nRMS Lusitania, Wikipedia article, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RMS_Lusitania: “RMS Lusitania was a British ocean liner, holder of the Blue Riband, and briefly the world’s largest passenger ship. She was launched by the Cunard Line in 1906, at a time of fierce competition for the North Atlantic trade. In 1915, she was torpedoed and sunk by a German U-boat, causing the deaths of 1,198 passengers and crew.”\n\n“Ontario Births, 1869-1912”, index, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/pal:/MM9.1.1/FM81-V3J : accessed 31 January 2015), Harold Mayne Daly, 1880.\n\n“Canada, Births and Baptisms, 1661-1959,” index, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/pal:/MM9.1.1/F22S-XN5 : accessed 31 January 2015), Harold Mayne Daly, 23 Apr 1880; citing Stratford, Perth, Ontario, 23 Apr 1880, reference item 2 p 356; FHL microfilm 1,845,400.\n\n“Canada Census, 1881,” index, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/pal:/MM9.1.1/MVFB-BG5 : accessed 3 February 2015), Harold Wayne Daly in household of Thos Wayne Daly, Stratford, Perth North, Ontario, Canada; citing p. 49; Library and Archives Canada film number C-13271, Library and Archives Canada, Ottawa, Ontario; FHL microfilm 1,375,907.\n\n“Canada Census, 1891,” index, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/pal:/MM9.1.1/MWG3-SQT : accessed 31 January 2015), Harold Daly, Peterborough Town, Peterborough West, Ontario, Canada; Public Archives, Ottawa, Ontario; Library and Archives Canada film number 30953_148166.\n\n“Canada Census, 1891,” index, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/pal:/MM9.1.1/MWKZ-JFG : accessed 31 January 2015), Harold Daly, Ward 6, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada; Public Archives, Ottawa, Ontario; Library and Archives Canada film number 30953_148099.\n\n“Canada Census, 1891,” index, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/pal:/MM9.1.1/MWK4-RH2 : accessed 31 January 2015), H M Daly, Brandon, Selkirk, Manitoba, Canada; Public Archives, Ottawa, Ontario; Library and Archives Canada film number 30953_148097.\n\n“Canada Census, 1901,” index, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/pal:/MM9.1.1/KHVL-XKG : accessed 31 January 2015), Harold M Daly in household of Thomas Mayer Daly, H, Yale & Cariboo, British Columbia, Canada; citing p. 10, Library and Archives of Canada, Ottawa.\n\nSouth African War, service records, http://www.bac-lac.gc.ca/eng/discover/military-heritage/south-african-war-1899-1902/Pages/item.aspx?IdNumber=8593&; Given Name(s):Harold Mayne; Surname: Daly; Regiment:Lord Strathcona’s Horse; Regimental number:323; Type of Records: Service files; Volume:24; Series:A1a; Microfilm Reel Number:T-2066; Reference:RG 38; Item Number:8593.\n\nSouth African War, land grant application, http://www.bac-lac.gc.ca/eng/discover/military-heritage/south-african-war-1899-1902/Pages/item.aspx?IdNumber=1547&: Given Name(s):Harold Mayne; Surname: DALY; Regimental number:1021; Type of Records:Land applications; Remarks: The land grant applications 601 to 1200 are missing.

His duties brought with them ‘a tremendous amount of patronage’ because the appointment of officers fell within his ambit. Daly described his office and the manner in which he a ted: ‘I was particularly good to lawyers, because I knew what business I was going into when I got out of the army; but I’m sorry to say that none of the lawyers remembered me after the war was over. I had done a lot for them – fixed up their sones, brothers, and brothers-in-law, none of them geve me any business.

It is of significance that the instructions for taking the soldiers’ vote contain an intimation that if a soldier feels incapable for any physical cause of marking his ballot he may have the Deputy Returning Officer mark it for him. This is taken by some to mean that many soldiers in the ranks will have their votes cast for them by Government officials.”\n\nSoldier’s Ballots Not on Lusitania: But H.M.

Every effort was made to have them ready for shipment on the Lusitania, but certain changes instituted in connection with the copies of the bill sent over for “instructional purposes” delayed the sending. The boxes, therefore, went via Halifax, it is understood, on the Parisian, and so were saved by the delay. There were 21 boxes in all. Harold Mayne Daly of Vancouver, however, who was sent over to supervise their delivery, sailed on the Lusitania, with the purpose of meeting the Parisian when it arrived and looking after the unloading.

He flounced off in a temper after the company’s chief architect, Walter S. Painter, summoned him to Montreal to discuss changes to the interior design. These were suggested by Kate Reed, wife of the company’s hotel superintendent, whose artistic taste had been refined by New York high society. She had advised Van Horne on his art collection, redecorated the Chateau Frontenac and prepared the royal train that took the Duke and Duchess of York across the country in 1901. Rattenbury’s irritation was not just that she was a company wife, or that she may have been inspired by English magazines like Country Life – he was too – but that he worked alone. He insisted on complete control and rarely chose to share credit with anyone.”\n\nTerry Reksten, The Empress Hotel: In the Grand Style, Vancouver, Douglas & McIntyre, 1997, page 41: “The hotel’s decorator, Kate Reed, like to work with colour – but only one colour at a time ‘in the interests of harmony.’ In decorating the CPR’s Royal Alexandra hotel in Winnipeg in 1906, she had declared, ‘Oh, everything is blue at present.’ For the Empress, everything was green, and the effect was somewhat overwhelming. Kate herself began to wonder if perhaps she had gone too far, particularly in the Palm Court. Within a few weeks, she ordered the columns and ceiling moulding repainted in cream, and she decided that the green-painted panels on some of the walls would be improved by the addition of verses.”\n\nPansy Patch – 59 Carleton Street, http://www.townsearch.com/remax/pansypatch.shtml; searched February 3, 2015: “Built in 1912, this historically significant home, resembles a Normandy farm-house with a thatched-style roof, round turret and small-paned windows; it is said to be a copy of Jacques Cartier’s house in St. Malo, Brittany. With its stunning design, its beautiful grounds and colourful gardens, it attracts attention and is the most photographed home in all of New Brunswick. Designed by Charles Sax, it was built by Kate and Hayter Reed. Being both artist and knowledgeable regarding interior design, Mrs. Reed was hired to do all the interior decorating for St. Andrews’ Algonquin Hotel as well as several other CPR hotels of the day. According to Willa Walker in her book, “No Hay Fever & A Railway”, Mrs. Reed had, “a flair for blending just the right colours and making the interior of each hotel unique and charming.” She brought that expertise fully to bear on her own home being built across the street from the hotel; affectionately known as the Pansy Patch.”\n\n“Tribute Paid Character of Late Mrs. Hayter Reed,” Vancouver Province, October 11, 1928, page 16: “Friends of the late Mrs. Hayter Reed will be interested to learn that a memorial service was held for her in London. Mrs. Reed was the eldest daughter of the late Hon. John Douglas Armour, justice of the Supreme Court of Canada and a sister of the late Mr. Douglas Armour, K.C., of Vancouver. She had a host of friends in British Columbia who were deeply grieved to hear of her death in England. In London, at the little Church of St. Ethelburga, the service was conducted by Rev. Geikie-Cobb. Her husband and son were present and among the Canadians in attendance were Sir George and Lady Perley, her brother, Dr. Donald Armour, and Mrs. Armour. The body was brought to Montreal for burial at Mount Royal Cemetery. The funeral service took place at Christ Church Cathedral with Dean Carlisle officiating, assisted by Canon Almond. The dean paid a moving tribute to the character of Mrs. Reed. An appreciation of her which appeared in an eastern newspaper says: “She had no enemies and was never too busy to ‘help some lame dog over a stile.’ She loved her home and home life best. For many years she had not been well and her suffering from insomnia was terrible, but through it all she never failed her friends. We who knew her brave heart will ever remember that though she was the cleverest woman in Canada she was also the most simple and the most loved.”\n\nMrs. Harold M.
