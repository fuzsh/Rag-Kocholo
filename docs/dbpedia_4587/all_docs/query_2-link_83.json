        "text": "Mr. SPROULE.\n\nI am not complaining of the length of time, but I want to know approximately when they will be out, because these questions are asked, and I desire to give information when they will be available.\n\nNext year we will have the first two charts, the chief engineer tells me, of Lake Huron, the first two charts only. They are generally about two years behind in getting the sheet charts ; from the time the survey is made until the sheet charts come back will be two years.\n\nThe hon. gentleman knows\n\nthat the vessel we employ on this hydrographic survey, the Bayfield, is a very old and almost worn-out vessel. Last year I tiled to get my hon. friend the Minister of Finance (Hon. Mr. Fielding) to give me some money to build a new boat, but he could not see his way clear to do it. I want to get a new boat now, but I have not got the money yet. There will be quite a large sum of money, $3,000 or $4,000 at the very least, expended in repairing the boiler and the machinery of the Bayfield to make her seaworthy. It is specially for that ; the whole $16,000, Mr. Stewart tells me, will be required.\n\nNot this year, but I am not without hopes that when we get the new vessel afloat we may be able to do something. We have called for tenders for her construction, although the contract has not been entered into yet. I hope she will be ready for service in a short time.\n\nHon. Mr. PRIOR.\n\nIf I understand the work these vessels have to do, I do not think they will have time to do any hydrographic work this year. No doubt these vessels are wanted badly, and they are wanted for customs work, and looking after smuggling and lighthouse service. The hon. gentleman will remember that last year a very strong effort was made by boards of trade in British Columbia to have that hydrographic survey carried on. The hon. gentleman must remember there is a tremendously large traffic going on now on that coast up to the Yukon, and also down to San Francisco. I think if he looks into it he will find that he ought to do something this year.\n\nLast year my hon. friend brought this matter up and I had it investigated. To a certain extent that coast has been already surveyed by Imperial officers but has not been as completely surveyed as it ought to be. The Quadra is now doing all the work out there, but it is contemplated to have a new ship launched, and the Quadra will be reserved entirely for marine work and the new ship devoted to the protection of the fisheries and customs. That need not necessarily absorb all her time, but neither\n\nI know he has, and the work he has done is very creditable to him, but I would not say that an officer of one of the Dominion steamers should not, when he discovers a rock, locate it properly on the chart.\n\nCare of sick seamen In Marine Hospital\n\nand other hospitals in the maritime\n\nprovinces $38,000\n\nShipwrecked and distressed seamen _____ 3,000\n\nThe increase of $3,000 in the first item is due to the increase of shipping, especially at the port of Montreal, where there is a very large number of seamen admitted to the General Hospital and the Notre Dame Hospital. In Montreal alone 340 seamen receive treatment, and the treatment of sick seamen at outlaying ports has also largely increased.\n\nLast year we spent $35,000, but that included $1,000 voted for the St. John cemetery. We estimate that we will require at least $2,000 more this year, basing our estimate on the increased number of patients in the Montreal hospital and the outlying ports."
