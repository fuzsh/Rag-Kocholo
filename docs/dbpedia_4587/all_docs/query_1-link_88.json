It also gave me an opportunity this year to visit the archives of the Ministère des Affaires étrangères français to review original documents from the Bering Sea Arbitration, held in Paris in 1893, for an article I am writing. The arbitration concerned freedom of the high seas and the protection of wildlife, in particular the North Pacific fur seal, which breeds on the Pribilof Islands off the west coast of the State of Alaska. The US objected to Canadians hunting the seals in the open ocean off the islands and began to seize Canadian ships, starting in 1886. After several years of negotiations and diplomatic maneuvering, a treaty of arbitration was agreed. Even though Great Britain was responsible for Canadian foreign affairs at the time, Canada had a prominent role in the arbitration, with Prime Minister Sir John Thompson sitting as one of the 7 arbitrators, Charles Hibbert Tupper, the Minister of Marine and Fisheries, acting as the Agent of Great Britain, and Christopher Robinson QC of Toronto, acting as one of the 3 lead counsel for Great Britain. The award recognized the principle of freedom of the high seas and also held that the US did not have a property right in the seal herd. But the tribunal also restricted the hunt within 60 miles of the islands and closed the season in May, June and July, in an attempt (largely futile) to maintain the herd’s population. #arbitration #internationalarbitration #diplomacy #wildlifeconservation #marinemammals #paw2023"
