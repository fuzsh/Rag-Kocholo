        "text": "Charles Stimson was a commission merchant. He lived at 804 Nicola Street from about 1898 to 1906.\n\nFamily Background\n\nCharles Stimson was born in Compton, Quebec on August 23, 1841. His parents were Arba Stimson (1806–1863) and Mary Greely Smith (1816–1857).\n\nArba Stimson was born in on July 19, 1806 in Duxbury Township, Vermont. He became a successful farmer and he operated a general store in Compton.\n\nOn November 11, 1839, in Hatley, Quebec, Arba Stimson married Mary Greely Smith. She was born about 1816.\n\nIn 1851 the Stimson family was living in Compton.\n\nMary Greely Stimson died in Compton on June 20, 1857.\n\nShe was buried in Compton Cemetery in Compton.\n\nIn October 1857, an auctioneer sold the stock of the Stimson and Doak store in Compton.\n\nIn 1861, Arba Stimson was widowed and living in Compton.\n\nArba Stimson died on June 12, 1863.\n\nHe was buried in Compton Cemetery in Compton.\n\nCharles Stimson: Early Life\n\nIn 1861 Charles Stimson was living in Montreal, Quebec.\n\nIn 1863 he was residing on Redpath Street in Montreal. He was working as a salesman.\n\nCharles later became a member of the leather merchants firm of Stimson and Richardson.\n\nCharles Richardson was the other member of the firm.\n\nMarriage to Melinda Le Moyne\n\nOn August 31, 1871, in Montreal, Charles married Melinda Mary Le Moyne (Melinda was sometimes called “Linda.” The spelling of her surname appeared in various ways, including “Le Moyne,” “Le Moine,” and “Lemoine.”).\n\nMelinda Le Moyne was born in Montreal on November 1, 1850. Her parents were Benjamin Henry Le Moyne (sometimes spelled Benjamin Henri Le Moine) (1811-1875) and Sophia Eliza McPherson (1812-1871).\n\nBenjamin Henry Lemoine and Sophia Eliza Macpherson were married on May 4, 1834. (Some sources say that the marriage was at Crane Island (Isle-aux-Grues), Quebec. Other sources state that Valcartier was the location of the marriage.)\n\nSophia Le Moyne died in Montreal on April 29, 1871.\n\nBenjamin Lemoine died in Montreal on April 18, 1875.\n\nFurther Business in Montreal\n\nBy the late 1870s Charles Stimson was in the leather business with Archibald Murray Cassils (1843-1891).\n\nArchibald Cassils was associated with the leather business, both in his own right and through his marriage. In 1873 he married Eva Albertine Shaw. She was the daughter of Brackley Shaw, who was a leather merchant.\n\nFailure of Cassils, Stimson\n\nThe Cassils, Stimson business was successful at first, and it had a wide range of suppliers and wholesale and retail customers.\n\nHowever, in 1884 Cassils, Stimson became insolvent, and this led to the failure of many companies that did business with Cassils, Stimson.\n\nIn 1884 the former business location of Cassils, Stimson and Company was available to rent.\n\nIn July 1884 an auctioneer sold Cassils, Stimson’s stock of leather goods.\n\nBy 1886, Charles Stimson and Archibald Cassils had established new leather merchant businesses under their own names.\n\nEven after Charles Stimson and Archibald Cassils established their own firms, the fallout from the failure of Cassils, Stimson and Company continued for several years. In 1887 the curator of the Cassils, Stimson estate declared a second and final dividend for the creditors.\n\nIn 1890 the Eastern Townships Bank obtained a $24,000 judgment against Cassils, Stimson and Company.\n\nArchibald Cassils died on March 6, 1891.\n\nEva Cassils died in Hollywood, California in 1941.\n\nCharles Stimson was in the Montreal city directory until 1892-1893.\n\nTo Vancouver\n\nAccording to an 1896 article in the Vancouver Daily World, Charles arrived in Vancouver about 1892.\n\nHowever, Charles Stimson’s name did not appear in Vancouver newspapers and directories until 1895.\n\nHe was a commission merchant, living in the first Hotel Vancouver.\n\nThe Hotel Vancouver originally had only a central section, but in 1892 and 1893 a new extension appeared at the south end of the original building. The builder of the extension was Augustus Eddy Barrett (1842-1907), who lived in Washington State.\n\nAddresses in Vancouver\n\nThe Stimson family lived at the following addresses in Vancouver. (The spelling of the family surname in the Vancouver directories was inconsistent: 1895, Stemson; 1896, Stimson; 1897, Steinson; 1898, Stimson; 1899, Simpson; 1900-1901, Stimson.)\n\nVancouver directory listings for Stimson family.\n\nSocial Life, Travel, and Business\n\nAfter Charles and Melinda Stimson arrived in Vancouver, they often appeared in the society pages, which sometimes described their travels to various parts of Canada.\n\nIn 1902, Charles received $5,000 from the estate of his cousin, Sydney Mason Smith, who was a wealthy capitalist in San Francisco. Sydney Smith died in San Jose, California on January 22, 1902.\n\nFriends with Jean Mollison\n\nMelinda Stimson was friends with Jean Mollison, who managed the C.P.R. Hotel in North Bend, British Columbia. Jean Mollison was the manager of Glencoe Lodge from 1907 to 1932.\n\nLater Life in Vancouver\n\nIn the early 1900s, Charles and Melinda continued to travel. In 1902 they went to Banff in the Rocky Mountains.\n\nIn 1903 they travelled to Quebec.\n\nIn early 1905, Charles Stimson retired from the shipping business. Robert Ward and Company (owned by Richard Vance Winch) took over Charles Stimson’s lease of the C.P.R. wharf at the foot of Abbott Street.\n\nIn the summer of 1905 Charles and Melinda travelled to Lake Louise in the Rocky Mountains.\n\nIn August 1905, Charles went salmon fishing on Vancouver Island with Charles McCulloch Beecher and Sir Charles Hibbert Tupper.\n\nCharles Stimson died in Vancouver on May 2, 1906.\n\nAccording to his probate records, Charles had a relatively modest estate. The total value of all of his property, both in British Columbia and elsewhere, was about $3675. His British Columbia real estate was worth $560, and his personal property was worth $260. Melinda Stimson was the sole beneficiary.\n\nMelinda Stimson: Later Life\n\nAfter Charles died, Melinda continued to travel and to take part in Vancouver society events.\n\nIn May 1906 she went to Montreal.\n\nIn August 1907 she became ill and she spent several days in St. Paul’s Hospital in Vancouver.\n\nMelinda appeared in the 1908 Vancouver society directory.\n\nMelinda died in Vancouver on December 2, 1909.\n\nFrederick Smith Stimson\n\nCharles Stimson’s younger brother, Frederick Smith Stimson (1842-1912), was a farmer in Quebec and a rancher in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains, west of Calgary.\n\nHe was born in Compton, Quebec on November 27, 1842. On June 27, 1866, he married his first cousin, Mary Greely Smith. He died in Montreal, Quebec on January 15, 1912.\n\nJohn McPherson Le Moyne\n\nJohn McPherson Le Moyne was Melinda Stimson’s brother. He was born in Montreal, Quebec on June 7, 1848, and he became a farmer in Compton, Quebec.\n\nOn June 7, 1881, in Compton, Quebec, he married Caroline Edith Boyle (sometimes referred to as “Catherine”).\n\nCaroline Boyle was born on Grindstone Island, Magdalen Islands, Quebec on February 13, 1859. Her parents were Rev. Felix Boyle (1829-1908) and Julia Louisa Arnold (1831–1865).\n\nJulia Louisa Boyle died on February 18, 1865.\n\nFelix Boyle died on November 16, 1908.\n\nJohn and Caroline Le Moyne arrived in Vancouver in 1907, and for most years after that they lived at 804 Nicola Street until the mid-1930s.\n\nJohn Le Moyne died in Vancouver on March 10, 1933.\n\nCaroline Le Moyne died in Vancouver on August 14, 1943.\n\nSources\n\nArba Stimson (father of Charles Stimson)\n\nArba Stimson (1806–1863); BIRTH 19 JUL 1806 • Duxbury Twp, Washington, Vermont, United States; DEATH 12 JUN 1863 • Compton, Quebec, Canada (ancestry.ca).\n\nAncestry.com. 1851 Census of Canada East, Canada West, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia [database on-line].
