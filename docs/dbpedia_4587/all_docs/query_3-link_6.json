        "text": "Tupper History, Family Crest & Coats of Arms\n\nOrigins Available:\n\nEngland\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly Origins of the Tupper family\n\nThe surname Tupper was first found in Saxony where they were an ancient family \"well known in the literature of Germany and France.\" 1 The family held a family seat at Thuringe in later years. The family became dispersed when they were beset by the religious conflicts of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. Under Charles V of France the main branch were described as Lutherans or \"tout-perd\" which in the Netherlands became Toupard. From this source, \"the principal branch went to Guernsey in 1548.\" 1 Another source follows this timeline but adds \"A branch of the family settled in England at Sandwich, Kent, whence another descendant, Thomas Tupper, went to America in 1635, and helped to found the town of Sandwich, Massachusetts in 1637.\" 2 Yet another source claims a completely different origin of the name. In this case, the name originated at \"York in 1365 [when] men were employed in beating and ramming (tupant) the earth and mud, strengthened with straw, with rammers (tuppis) and great hammers. As the rams were called tups, these workmen may well have been named tuppers.\" 3 The latter source may have some credence as early rolls revealed: Robert Tophird in the Subsidy Rolls of Yorkshire in 1327, 3 and Willelmus Tuphird in the Yorkshire Poll Tax Rolls of 1379. 4\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly History of the Tupper family\n\nThis web page shows only a small excerpt of our Tupper research.

By 1838, the British New Zealand Company had begun buying land from the Maori tribes, and selling it to settlers, and, after the Treaty of Waitangi in 1840, many British families set out on the arduous six month journey from Britain to Aotearoa to start a new life. Early immigrants include:\n\nTupper Settlers in New Zealand in the 19th Century\n\nH. Tupper, who arrived in Wellington, New Zealand aboard the ship \"Asterope\" in 1867\n\nTupper migration to West Indies +\n\nThe British first settled the British West Indies around 1604. They made many attempts but failed in some to establish settlements on the Islands including Saint Lucia and Grenada. By 1627 they had managed to establish settlements on St. Kitts (St. Christopher) and Barbados, but by 1641 the Spanish had moved in and destroyed some of these including those at Providence Island. The British continued to expand the settlements including setting the First Federation in the British West Indies by 1674; some of the islands include Barbados, Bermuda, Cayman Island, Turks and Caicos, Jamaica and Belize then known as British Honduras. By the 1960's many of the islands became independent after the West Indies Federation which existed from 1958 to 1962 failed due to internal political conflicts. After this a number of Eastern Caribbean islands formed a free association. 7\n\nTupper Settlers in West Indies in the 17th Century\n\nTho Tupper, aged 21, who arrived in St Christopher in 1635 6\n\nContemporary Notables of the name Tupper (post 1700) +\n\nMartin Farquhar Tupper (1810-1889), English poet and antiquarian, best known as the author of Proverbial Philosophy\n\nEliakim Eddy Tupper (1822-1895), Canadian block maker and politician who represented Digby County in the Nova Scotia House of Assembly from 1890 to 1895\n\nStanley Roger Tupper (1921-2006), American politician, U.S. Representative from Maine\n\nEarl Silas Tupper (1907-1983), American inventor of Tupperware, an airtight plastic container for storing food\n\nWilliam Johnston Tupper (1862-1947), Canadian politician, 12th Lieutenant Governor of Manitoba (1934-1940)\n\nBenjamin Tupper (1738-1792), American soldier in the French and Indian War, and an officer of the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War who achieved the rank of brevet brigadier general, co-founder of the Ohio Company of Associates\n\nJames Tupper (b. 1965), Canadian actor best known for his role as Jack Slattery on the ABC television series Men in Trees\n\nSir Charles Hibbert Tupper (b. 1964), 6th Baronet of Armdale, Halifax, Nova Scotia\n\nSir Charles Hibbert Tupper (1930-2008), 5th Baronet of Armdale, Halifax, Nova Scotia\n\nSir James Macdonald Tupper (1887-1967), 4th Baronet of Armdale, Halifax, Nova Scotia\n\n...

Mottoes first began to be shown with arms in the 14th and 15th centuries, but were not in general use until the 17th century. Thus the oldest coats of arms generally do not include a motto. Mottoes seldom form part of the grant of arms: Under most heraldic authorities, a motto is an optional component of the coat of arms, and can be added to or changed at will; many families have chosen not to display a motto.\n\nMotto: L'espoir est ma force\n\nMotto Translation: Hope is my strength.\n\nCitations +\n\nLower, Mark Anthony, Patronymica Britannica, A Dictionary of Family Names of the United Kingdom.
