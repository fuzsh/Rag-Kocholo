        "meta_description": "Lambdopsalidae is a family of extinct multituberculate mammals from the Late Paleocene of Asia. They are part of Taeniolabidoidea, a clade otherwise present in the Early Paleocene of North America.  The Lambdopsalids probably evolved from a single radiation that spread into Asia from North America in the mid-Paleocene or earlier. They are represented by the genera Lambdopsalis,  Sphenopsalis and Prionessus.[2][1]  This group was first defined in 1978 by Chow and Tao Qi.[3]",
