        "text": "Cranium\n\nThe cranial material from the Corral Bluffs study area is the most complete for Taeniolabis taoensis. This material, coupled with that previously described from the San Juan Basin (without the aid of µCT technology), allows us to provide descriptions of most elements in more detail than possible heretofore. This is preceded by an overview of cranial size and shape and how the latter differs from those in previous reconstructions.\n\nCranial Size and Body Mass Estimates\n\nVarious measurements of the available crania of T. taoensis are provided in Table 5. Employing overall cranial size (geometric mean of maximum cranial length and width) as seemingly the most practical metric for estimating body mass in multituberculates (Wilson et al. 2012; Lyson et al. 2019a), T. taoensis was estimated by Lyson et al. (2019a) to have had a body mass of 34.0 kg (95% confidence interval = 20.8–55.6 kg). The measurements and resulting estimate were based on DMNH EPV.95284, the most complete available cranium. We revise that estimate here because of the discovery of DMNH EPV.136300 (Fig. 6), which demonstrated for the first time that the premaxilla extended farther anteriorly (approximately 7 mm) in T. taoensis than previously realized, and thus that the condylobasal length in DMNH EPV.95284 (Fig. 4) was underestimated. Revised (only condylobasal length) and other measurements for DMNH EPV.95284 are provided in Table 5, as are original measurements for AMNH 16321 and UCMP 98083, the only other two specimens for which condylobasal length and bizygomatic breadth can be directly measured or calculated. Using the same regression equations as employed by Lyson et al. (2019a; see Krause et al. 2014a for equations and comparative data set of over 400 extant species belonging to 20 orders of therian mammals), the revised body mass estimate based on DMNH EPV.95284 is 36.6 kg (cranial size = 153.3 mm; 95% confidence interval = 22.4–59.9 kg). The body mass estimate based on cranial size of AMNH 16321 is slightly greater (39.7 kg; cranial size = 157.0 mm; 95% confidence interval = 24.2–65.1 kg), whereas that based on cranial size of UCMP 98083, the juvenile skull, is understandably much less (5.3 kg; cranial size = 87.2 mm; 95% confidence interval = 3.3–8.4 kg).\n\nCranial Shape\n\nBased on AMNH 3036, a partial cranium consisting of a few posterior fragments, the cranium of T. taoensis was originally reconstructed by W. D. Matthew (in Gregory 1910: fig. 8, who apparently mislabeled this specimen in the caption as AMNH 3075) as slender and elongate, with a narrow, pointed snout in dorsal view and a strongly arched (concave ventrally) diastema between the incisors and cheekteeth, a low braincase, and a distinct convexity above the orbit in side view. The discovery of AMNH 16321 resulted in major revisions to the dorsal outline and later reconstructions by Broom (1914: figs. 6, 8), Simpson (1926: fig. 2), and Granger and Simpson (1929: figs. 4–6) more accurately depicted a much shorter, broader cranium (almost as wide as long), with widely flaring zygomatic arches that, anteriorly, project almost directly laterally, and also a short, blunt snout. In lateral view, the cranium was reconstructed by these later authors with a large, relatively flat diastema, a very deep, strongly arched (convex dorsally, concave ventrally) zygomatic arch, and a strongly domed, relatively high braincase. The cranial reconstructions of Granger and Simpson (1929) became the standard depiction for T. taoensis and were frequently duplicated or closely followed in later works (e.g., Simpson 1935: fig. 16; Matthew 1937: figs. 71–73; Simpson 1937b: fig. 3; Romer 1966: fig. 309A; Sloan 1979: fig. 4, 1981: text-fig. 6.14; Krause 1982b: fig. 1, 1986: fig. 4; Kermack and Kermack 1984: fig. 8.13; Carlson and Krause 1985: fig. 1; Savage and Long 1986; Kielan-Jaworowska and Hurum 1997: figs. 10C, 11C; Kielan-Jaworowska et al. 2004: figs. 8.39I, 8.40C; Rose 2006: fig. 4.8; Weil and Krause 2008: fig. 2.2A; Rougier et al. 2016: fig. 29; Adams et al. 2019: fig. 1d; Wible et al. 2019: figs. 21C, 22C, 23C). The largest change to the reconstructions of Granger and Simpson (1929) was made to the lateral view by Sloan (1979, 1981; followed by Wible et al. 2019: fig. 21C), who concluded that the orbit was larger and more posteriorly situated, with the anterior part of the orbit occupied by a portion of the masseter muscle. Furthermore, Sloan (1979, 1981), unlike Broom (1914), Simpson (1926), and Granger and Simpson (1929), did not include a laterally visible jugal bearing a dorsally projecting postorbital process (marking the posterior limit of the orbit).\n\nThe new material from Corral Bluffs reveals that several adjustments need to be made to the cranial reconstructions of Granger and Simpson (1929), who depicted the cranium in dorsal (fig. 5A), ventral (fig. 6), lateral (fig. 4), and posterior (fig. 5B) views; neither they nor any other workers illustrated an anterior view. Revised reconstructions of the cranium of T. taoensis in all five standard views (dorsal, ventral, lateral, anterior, and posterior) are provided in Fig. 10a–e.\n\nDorsal View: (1) the premaxillae, with their anterodorsally projecting internarial processes, extend considerably farther anteriorly than previously known, thus completely obscuring observation of the upper central incisors (I2s) in this view and making the front of the snout more pointed than previously recognized (DMNH EPV.136300, Fig. 6c); (2) the angle between the snout and the root of the zygomatic arch is slightly more accentuated (DMNH EPV.136300, Fig. 6c); (3) the orbit is positioned farther posteriorly than reconstructed by Granger and Simpson (1929) but more anteriorly than reconstructed by Sloan (1981); see also “Lateral View” below; (4) the size (height) of the sagittal and nuchal (= lambdoidal) crests are taller and more ridge-like than previously estimated (DMNH EPV.95284, Fig. 4c; DMNH EPV.134082, Fig. 5c); (5) the cranial vault is not evenly rounded but instead ends in a distinct peak where the sagittal and nuchal crests intersect (external occipital protuberance), which is farther posterior than previously reconstructed (DMNH EPV.95284, Fig. 4c); and (6) the occipital condyles are not as anteriorly positioned relative to the nuchal crests as previously reconstructed (DMNH EPV.95284, Fig. 4b, d; DMNH EPV.134082, Fig. 5a–d).\n\nVentral View: (1) the premaxillae extend farther anteriorly, beyond the level of the upper central incisors (DMNH EPV.136300, Figs. 6d and 11); (2) the I3s are preserved in situ for the first time (DMNH EPV.136300, left side, Figs. 6d and 11); (3) the incisive foramina are slightly smaller and slightly more lateral, closer to the alveoli of I3 (DMNH EPV.136300, Figs. 6d and 11); (4) the maxillary portion of the palate is not as strongly domed (DMNH EPV.95284, Fig. 4d; DMNH EPV.136300, Figs. 6d and 11) as described by Granger and Simpson (1929); (5) the posterior end of the palate ends farther anteriorly, roughly at the level of the middle (DMNH EPV.95284, Fig. 4d) or posterior end (DMNH EPV.134082, Fig. 5d) of M2, rather than well posterior to M2, and has a more bulbous, midline, posterior projection; (6) the sutures between the premaxillae and the maxillae on the palate are seen for the first time in DMNH EPV.136300 (Figs. 6d and 11); (7) the sutures between the maxillae and the palatines can be discerned in DMNH EPV.134082 (Fig. 5d) for the first time (these sutures were not rendered by Granger and Simpson 1929: fig. 6, but were added by Kielan-Jaworowska and Hurum 1997: fig. 11C, incorrectly); and (8) details of the mesocranium and basicranium are revealed for the first time in DMNH EPV.95284 (Figs. 4d and 14b), DMNH EPV.134082 (Figs. 5d, 14c), and UCMP 98083 (Figs. 8d, 14d).\n\nLateral View: (1) the premaxillae, with their anterodorsally projecting internarial processes, extend farther anteriorly than previously known (DMNH EPV.136300, Fig. 6a, b); (2) the I3s are preserved in situ for the first time (DMNH EPV.136300, left side, Fig. 6a); (3) the orbit is more posteriorly positioned than estimated by Granger and Simpson (1929: fig. 4) but not as anteriorly positioned as estimated by Sloan (1981: fig. 6.14); (4) the jugal cannot be seen in lateral view rising above the level of the zygomatic arch as in earlier reconstructions; (5) a lacrimal bone is entirely absent (both on the orbital rim and within the orbit (DMNH EPV.136300, Fig. 12); (6) the frontal contributes substantially to the medial wall of the orbit, passing deep to the anterolateral extension of the parietal that passes forward to contact the nasal and maxilla (DMNH EPV.136300, Fig. 12); (7) the size (height) of the sagittal and nuchal crests are taller and more ridge-like than previously estimated (DMNH EPV.95284, Fig. 4a, b; DMNH EPV.134082, Fig. 5a, b); (8) the cranial vault is not evenly rounded posteriorly but instead ends in a distinct peak where the sagittal and nuchal crests intersect (external occipital protuberance), which is farther posterior than previously reconstructed (DMNH EPV.95284, Fig. 4a); and (9) the occipital condyles are not as anteriorly positioned relative to the nuchal crests as previously reconstructed and can be seen in this view (DMNH EPV.95284, Fig. 4b; DMNH EPV.134082, Fig. 5a, b).\n\nPosterior View: (1) the nuchal crests are taller and more ridge-like than previously reconstructed, such that the dorsal aspect of the cranial cavity is barely visible (DMNH EPV.95284, Fig. 4f; DMNH EPV.134082, Fig. 5f); (2) the paroccipital processes are not enlarged to the extent that they extend ventrally below the level of the occipital condyles (DMNH EPV.95284, Fig. 4f; DMNH EPV.134082, Fig. 5f); (3) the foramen magnum is triangular rather than rounded in outline and is bordered dorsolaterally on each side by a prominent rim (DMNH EPV.95284, Fig. 4f; DMNH EPV.134082, Fig. 5f); (4) a large posttemporal foramen in the petrosal can be identified for the first time (DMNH EPV.134082, Fig. 5f); and (5) the occipital condyles are not as large and bulbous (DMNH EPV.95284, Fig. 4f; DMNH EPV.134082, Fig. 5f).\n\nNasals\n\nThe nasals of Taeniolabis are extraordinarily long and broad elements that dominate the roof of the nasal cavity and form the dorsal margin of the external nasal aperture. They are wider posteriorly than anteriorly. As described and/or illustrated previously (Broom 1914; figs. 6, 8; Granger and Simpson 1929; figs. 4, 5A), each nasal articulates along strongly interdigitated sutures with the premaxillae and maxillae ventrolaterally, the parietal posterolaterally, and the frontal posteromedially. Interestingly, the midline suture with the contralateral nasal is also strongly interdigitated (rather than being planar) in at least AMNH 16321 (Figs. 3a, 7c); segments of this internasal suture can be discerned on the surface of DMNH EPV.95284 (Fig. 4c), DMNH EPV.136300 (Fig. 6c), and UCMP 98083 (Fig. 8c) but details cannot be distinguished. The medial aspects of the frontals project anteriorly to insert between the posterior ends of the nasals such that the nasal-frontal suture on each side is, from medial to lateral, oriented transversely, then obliquely (anteromedial to posterolateral), and then transversely again, ending at the triple junction with an anterolateral extension of the parietal.\n\nThe nasals are incomplete anteriorly in AMNH 16321 (Figs. 3a, b and 7a–e) and were reconstructed in dorsal and lateral views by Broom (1914: figs. 6, 8), Simpson (1926: fig. 2), and Granger and Simpson (1929: figs. 4, 5A) to extend anteromedially to meet their counterparts in the midline but to terminate at almost the same level as the premaxillae. DMNH EPV.95284 (Fig. 4a–c) and especially DMNH EPV.136300 (Fig. 6a–c), which have relatively complete premaxillae, demonstrate for the first time that these earlier reconstructions are inaccurate. The relatively complete premaxillae preserved in DMNH EPV.136300 (Fig. 6a–c) reveal the presence of strong internarial processes that extend the premaxillae considerably farther anteriorly than previously realized (see “Premaxillae” below). As such, the termination of the nasals anteriorly falls well short of the anterior extent of the premaxillae (see reconstructions in Fig. 10a, c). As seen in DMNH EPV.95284 (Fig. 4c), DMNH EPV.136300 (Fig. 6c), and UCMP 98083 (Fig. 8c), the anterior shape of the nasals in dorsal view is more squared than estimated by Broom (1914: fig. 6), Simpson (1926: fig. 2), and Granger and Simpson (1929: figs. 5A). We do not see definitive evidence of sutures near the midline anteriorly that might indicate the presence of an internarial bar formed by the premaxillae and inserted between the anterior ends of the left and right nasals but also acknowledge that none of the available specimens preserves this area pristinely; we therefore provisionally regard an internarial bar to be absent in T. taoensis. A distinct notch in the lateral outline of the external nasal aperture occurs where the nasal and premaxilla meet (Fig. 10a, c). This is not the same structure identified as an “anterior nasal notch” by Lillegraven and Krusat (1991; see also Wible and Rougier 2000), which occurs along the anterior margin of the nasal, not at its lateral edge.\n\nBroom (1914) and Granger and Simpson (1929) did not record the presence of nasal foramina in AMNH 16321 but at least one large nasal foramen, now obscured by matrix and/or plaster on the original specimen (Fig. 3a) but visible on the µCT scans (Fig. 7c, e), is present on the right side; the canal leading from it projects posterointernally. Miao (1988: 18; see also Hurum 1994) stated that nasal foramina were present in a cranium of Taeniolabis “being studied by Simmons (personal communication).” This is presumably UCMP 98083, which was illustrated in ventral (but not dorsal) view by Greenwald (1988: fig. 1A). We here also confirm the presence of nasal foramina in UCMP 98083 (Fig. 8a, c, e). The available µCT scans reveal that there are at least five large foramina in the left nasal of UCMP 98083, whereas only one is visible in the less well preserved right nasal. The foramina, which appear to pass internally into the nasal cavity, occur in the posterior half of each nasal and short neurovascular grooves extend generally anteriorly from the foramina toward the front or side of the snout. The single foramen visible on the right nasal is situated more posteriorly than any of those on the left. Four of the five foramina on the left are distributed along a more-or-less transverse line, with the fifth situated more anteriorly. We suspect that there are more foramina in the right nasal of UCMP 98083 (as illustrated in Fig. 10a) but that they are obscured by the relatively high amount of breakage on that side. Nonetheless, it is apparent that pronounced asymmetry in the number and position of nasal foramina is present. We could not conclusively confirm the presence of nasal foramina in any of the Corral Bluffs cranial specimens of T. taoensis but believe that this is owing to poor surface preservation.\n\nPremaxillae\n\nThe premaxillae were not well known previously, particularly anteriorly along the midline and on the palate. The sutures with the maxillae on the lateral aspects of the snout and with the nasals dorsally are as depicted by Broom (1914: figs. 6, 8) and Granger and Simpson (1929: figs. 4, 5A) in AMNH 16321. However, the premaxillae are fragmentary in this specimen and preclude evaluation of the presence or absence of the internarial process, the precise size, shape, orientation, and borders of the incisive foramina (anterior palatine foramina of Broom 1914; Granger and Simpson 1929), and the position and shape of the sutures with the maxillae on the palate.\n\nThe premaxilla bears two incisors (I2 and I3) and has three processes –– facial (posterodorsal), palatal, and internarial –– the last of which was previously entirely unknown for Taeniolabis. The facial process on the side of the snout is more or less vertical in orientation, but gently convex laterally, and ascends to contact the nasal along a strongly interdigitated, roughly horizontal suture. As it ascends, the process does not change greatly in anteroposterior length. The posterior suture with the maxilla, also strongly interdigitated, is longer than that with the nasal, extends from anteroventral to posterodorsal in lateral view, and is slightly convex anteriorly.\n\nThe palatal processes of the premaxillae are transversely domed, resulting in a gently concave palate, particularly anteriorly. The medial portion of the sutures between the palatal processes of the premaxillae and maxillae was previously unknown. We can confirm that, laterally, the sutures on AMNH 16321 (Fig. 7d) are as depicted in Granger and Simpson (1929: fig. 6), passing posteromedially from the premaxillary ridge (crista premaxillaris of Kielan-Jaworowska et al. 2005) for a short distance toward the midline. We cannot trace this premaxillary-maxillary suture on the palate of AMNH 16321 with confidence any farther toward the midline and therefore cannot determine if it intersects or passes posterior to the posterior border of the incisive foramen. Digital segmentation of DMNH EPV.136300, however, reveals that the suture passes directly medially from where it crosses the premaxillary ridge to intersect the incisive foramen toward its posterior end (Fig. 11). The suture then passes directly medially from near mid-length on the medial aspect of the incisive foramen to meet its contralateral counterpart on the other side of the interpremaxillary suture. This differs from the reconstruction in Kielan-Jaworowska and Hurum (1997: fig. 11C), who drew the suture as touching the posterior border of the incisive foramen but not passing any farther medially.\n\nAs definitively shown by DMNH EPV.136300, the incisive foramina are generally as conjectured by Granger and Simpson (1929: fig. 6, dashed lines) from AMNH 16321 but are smaller, more nearly oval (rather than reniform), and slightly more lateral, closer to the alveoli of I3 than described and depicted by those authors. Although Broom (1914) explicitly stated that the size of the incisive foramina could not be determined in AMNH 16321 because of breakage, Granger and Simpson (1929: 614) described them as “oval, about 15 mm. long, and quite lateral in position, just internal to I3.” The best-preserved incisive foramen is on the left side of DMNH EPV.136300 (Figs. 6d and 11); it is elliptical in shape and measures 10.3 mm long and 3.4 mm wide, thus shorter than estimated and depicted by Granger and Simpson (1929: fig. 6).\n\nThe alveolus of I3 lies completely within the premaxilla. Its anterior border is directly lateral to the anterior border of the incisive foramen and its lateral border is immediately medial to the premaxillary ridge (best seen in DMNH EPV.136300 [Fig. 6d] and AMNH 16321 [Fig. 7d]), which marks the boundary between the facial and palatal processes of the bone. The premaxillary ridge is not sharp but is instead low and rounded (best seen on right side of AMNH 16321; Fig. 7d). Wible et al. (2019) opined that the ridge is absent in Taeniolabis (and Ptilodus); we regard it as present but low and rounded and just not as sharp and crest-like as in some other multituberculates, although it also appears as quite low and rounded in forms like Catopsbaatar (Kielan-Jaworowska et al. 2005: fig. 2C) and Guibaatar (Wible et al. 2019: fig. 3). Kielan-Jaworowska et al. (2005: 489) considered the ridge to be a probable synapomorphy of Djadochtatherioidea, stating that “to our knowledge it does not occur in other multituberculates,” but its presence in Taeniolabis indicates that this is likely not the case. A premaxillary ridge is also depicted by Miao (1988: fig. 18) as quite sharp in Lambdopsalis. The alveoli of I2 and I3 in DMNH EPV.136300 (Figs. 6d and 11) are separated by short diastemata (Table 5) that are less than the lengths of the alveoli of I2. These distances appear to be shorter on AMNH 16321 but fracturing and plaster preclude accurate measurement on this specimen; plate XI in Broom (1914), which includes a photograph prior to reconstruction, suggests that the size of the diastemata are greater but this area is now damaged and less complete (compare Figs. 2b and 7d).\n\nThe anterior portions of the premaxillae of Taeniolabis were previously unknown; reconstructions of this region (Broom 1914; fig. 6; Granger and Simpson 1929; figs. 5A, 6), based on AMNH 16321, depicted a large empty space between the left and right I2s (see also Figs. 2a, b and 7c, d). The anterior parts of the premaxillae are, however, almost completely preserved in DMNH EPV.136300 (Figs. 6d and 11) and show, for the first time, that this space is occupied by substantial anterodorsal projections, the internarial processes, formed by the premaxillae. In lateral view, the internarial processes extend even farther anteriorly than the anterior-most extent of the I2s (Fig. 6a, b, d). The tips of the processes are, unfortunately, missing due to breakage and/or post-depositional erosion, thus precluding observation of their full height. However, because we do not see evidence of internarial processes inserted between the anterior ends of the nasals, we believe that they terminated shortly above where they are broken away and that they did not form a complete internarial bar separating the external nasal aperture into left and right halves (see reconstruction in Fig. 10a, c, d). The extensive bases of the left and right internarial processes abut one another and are separated only by the interpremaxillary suture. In anterior view (Figs. 6e and 10d), the ventral surfaces of the premaxillae form a strongly arched (concave ventrally) surface between the left and right I2s.\n\nSeptomaxillae\n\nThere is no evidence of septomaxillae in any of the new specimens of T. taoensis, confirming Broom’s (1914) earlier suspicion of their absence based on AMNH 16321.\n\nVomer\n\nWe were unable to detect convincing evidence of the vomer in any of the available cranial specimens but regard this as simply owing to preservational issues and, in terms of µCT imaging, to the poor density contrast between bone and rock matrix, although there are indications of its presence in DMNH EPV.136300. There is, however, a prominent longitudinal ridge, which may be paired, on the dorsal surfaces of the premaxillae and maxillae on DMNH EPV.134082 (Fig. 5c, e), which has the floor of the nasal cavity exposed. The ridge appears to be situated to the right of the midline but it may be a slightly displaced midline structure and may represent the base to which the vomer articulated. Other displaced bony remnants in DMNH EPV.134082 are preserved more posteriorly that could represent the actual vomer but it is impossible to determine.\n\nLacrimals\n\nThe lacrimal of Taeniolabis was described as having a small dorsal exposure by Kielan-Jaworowska and Hurum (1997). However, the lacrimal bone was not identified in Taeniolabis by Broom (1914), Granger and Simpson (1929), or other earlier workers, with Broom stating (p. 128) that, “[I]f one occurs, it must be very small and situated low down within the orbit.” Indeed, although the anterior rim of the orbit is fragmented in AMNH 16321 and, whereas the nasomaxillary suture is abundantly clear, there is no trace of a suture in this region, thus tentatively confirming that the lacrimal did not have any facial exposure and indicating that the maxilla contributed exclusively to the formation of the anterior orbital rim. Similarly, none of the Corral Bluffs specimens available to us reveals evidence of a lacrimal, either on the orbital rim or within the orbit. This is arguably the result of poor preservation of surface detail in these specimens but digital segmentation of the mid-region of the cranium of DMNH EPV.136300 (Fig. 12) did not reveal the preservation of a lacrimal, either on the orbital rim or inside the orbit. Furthermore, because we also do not see evidence of a lacrimal in UCMP 98083, we conclude that it was entirely absent in Taeniolabis.\n\nMaxillae\n\nThe maxilla of T. taoensis is a large element that houses a small, simple premolar (P4) and two, large, complex molars (M1, M2) in its alveolar process. The left and right cheektooth rows are approximately parallel to one another but diverge slightly anteriorly.\n\nThe facial process of the maxilla articulates via interdigitated sutures anteriorly with the premaxilla and dorsally with the nasal, essentially as depicted by Broom (1914: figs. 6, 8) and Granger and Simpson (1929: figs. 4, 5A). The facial process also extends posteromedially along and medial to the orbital rim to contact a long, anterolaterally directed projection of the parietal; this contact is possible, in part, because of the absence of an intervening facial process of the lacrimal. The contribution of the maxilla to the anterior orbital rim is more completely preserved in DMNH EPV.95284 (Fig. 4) and DMNH EPV.136300 (Fig. 6) than it is in AMNH 16321 (Fig. 7), in which much of the rim is broken away, but is best revealed by digital segmentation of the partially preserved anterior orbital rim (zygomatic root) in DMNH EPV.136300 (Fig. 12). This specimen demonstrates that the lacrimal is indeed absent and that the anterior orbital rim is composed solely by the maxilla. The only additional feature worthy of note on the facial process is a single, infraorbital foramen and a prominent groove extending anteriorly from it, situated directly anterior to the large root of the zygoma and well anterior to the level of P4.\n\nDigital segmentation of the mid-region of the cranium in DMNH EPV.136300 demonstrates that the maxilla provides a vast contribution to the medial orbital wall, extending dorsally for a considerable distance from the alveolar process (Fig. 12). There, it contacts the nasal anterodorsally and the frontal dorsally, although the suture between the maxilla and frontal cannot be discerned in one area. Unfortunately, features that plausibly lie within or bordered by the maxilla (e.g., maxillary and sphenopalatine foramina) on the medial wall of the orbit cannot be seen. Because a lacrimal is not present, the facial process of the maxilla contributes exclusively to the anterior and some of the dorsal part of the orbital rim, which is continued posteriorly by the parietal.\n\nThe facial process of the maxilla transitions into the zygomatic process but, in dorsal view, there is a prominent angle between the longitudinal axes of the two that marks the anterior margin of the root of the zygoma. The included angle, measured along the external margins of the two processes, in the least deformed of the Corral Bluffs specimens, DMNH EPV.136300 (Fig. 6c, d), is approximately 123°, slightly sharper than rendered by Granger and Simpson (1929: fig. 5A; ~129°) and especially by Broom (1914; Fig. 6; 138°) based on AMNH 16321 (our measurement of AMNH 16321 is roughly consistent with that obtained by Granger and Simpson). The anterior margin of the root of the zygoma is well anterior to P4 and the posterior margin begins roughly opposite the embrasure between P4 and M1.\n\nThe zygomatic process of the maxilla is extraordinarily deep and its dorsal surface forms the ventral margin of the orbit. The process extends posteriorly to contact the slightly less deep zygomatic process of the squamosal. The two processes articulate on the zygomatic arch along a planar suture that, in lateral view, is restricted to the anterior half of the arch (i.e., the zygomatic process of the maxilla is much shorter than the zygomatic process of the squamosal) and extends from anterodorsal to posteroventral.\n\nHopson (in Hopson et al. 1989) stated that the presence or absence of a jugal could not be determined in AMNH 16321. UCMP 98083 (Figs. 8d and 13) reveals the presence of an anterior fragment of the rudimentary jugal on the medial aspect of the zygomatic process of the maxilla (see “Jugals” below). This contrasts with the reconstructions by Broom (1914: figs. 6, 8) and Granger and Simpson (1929: figs. 4, 5A), which depict (in dotted outlines) a much larger jugal, with at least part of it rising above the zygomatic processes of the maxilla and squamosal, bearing a postorbital process. UCMP 98083 indicates that the jugal would likely not be visible in lateral view (Fig. 8b).\n\nAn anterior zygomatic ridge on the lateral aspect of the zygomatic arch of the maxilla, marking the dorsal boundary for the origin of masseter superficialis pars anterior, was described as present in AMNH 16321 by Kielan-Jaworowska et al. (2005: 509; based on observation of photographs in Broom 1914: pls. XI, XII). In addition, Yaoming Hu (pers. comm. to Kielan-Jaworowska et al. 2005: 509) was said to have identified an anterior zygomatic ridge in AMNH 16321. We are unable to confirm this identification on the original specimen; the right zygomatic arch is mostly missing but the left arch is quite well preserved, although fragmented with several small missing areas filled with plaster; compare Fig. 3a, b with Fig. 7a, c, d). We also cannot identify curved ridges on what is preserved of the right zygomatic arch of UCMP 98083 (Fig. 8b, c). The lateral surface of the zygomatic process of the maxilla on both AMNH 16321 and UCMP 98083 is essentially smooth (except for cracks) and gently convex. There is, however, a prominent depression, wide anteriorly and tapering and becoming indistinct posteriorly, on the ventral surface of this process in AMNH 16321 (Fig. 7d), that, despite incompleteness and fracturing, appears to be present in UCMP 98083 (Fig. 8d) as well. We assume, therefore, that the masseter superficialis pars anterior originated from this depression rather than from the lateral surface of the process. The poor surface preservation of the Corral Bluffs specimens precludes independent confirmation of these observations.\n\nGranger and Simpson (1929:614) described the maxillary portion of the palate on AMNH 16321 “as greatly arched or domed, reaching its greatest height between the premolars.” This region of the palate in AMNH 16321 is reconstructed with large amounts of plaster (Fig. 3b; see Broom 1914: pl. XI and Fig. 7d for images of the specimen without plaster infillings). The DMNH specimens, especially DMNH EPV.136300 (Fig. 6d), which is the least deformed in this region, indicate that the maxillary portion of the palate, although arched/domed, is not as strongly concave as reconstructed in AMNH 16321. The greatest degrees of curvature of the palate appear to be farther posterior, between the M1s, and far anteriorly, on the premaxillae between the I2s.\n\nOn the palate, the full extent of the suture of the maxilla with the premaxilla was digitally segmented in DMNH EPV.136300 and is shown to pass medially from the premaxillary ridge and intersect the posterior margin of the incisive fossa (Fig. 11; see more detailed description in “Premaxillae” section above). Faint sutures between the maxillae and the palatines can be seen on only one specimen, DMNH EPV.134082 (Fig. 5d); the fact that they are more or less symmetrically developed lends credence to their identification. The combined sutures (described more fully in the “Palatines” section below), beginning opposite the distal quarter of M1, result in a shape similar to that of a bell, with the top of the bell situated anteriorly (see reconstruction in Fig. 10b). We could not identify either major or minor palatine foramina but ascribe this to poor preservation rather than to true absence. Finally, whereas Broom (1914: 128) identified a “small, oval” palatal vacuity, Granger and Simpson (1929: 614) opined that AMNH 3041 (a specimen not seen in the current study) “seems positively to indicate that palatal vacuities were not present,” but then, in a later paper, Simpson (1937b: 735) left some doubt, stating that “[t]here was probably no palatal vacuity” in T. taoensis. The Corral Bluffs specimens, particularly DMNH EPV.136300 (Fig. 6d), demonstrate conclusively that palatal vacuities are absent.\n\nPalatines\n\nThe palatines appear to not have been preserved in AMNH 16321; they are now reconstructed in plaster (compare Figs. 3b and 7d; see also Broom 1914: pl. XI), although Granger and Simpson (1929: fig. 6) drew some dashed lines indicating that the hard palate extended well posterior to the distal ends of M2. Distinct palatine-maxilla sutures were reconstructed by Kielan-Jaworowska and Hurum 1997: fig. 11C) to indicate that the palatines were, together, roughly bell-shaped with a sharply pointed posterior tip and extending from medial to M2 to, again, well posterior to M2 but we are unaware of any previously known specimens that demonstrate this size, position, and shape.\n\nThe palatines are completely, although poorly, preserved in two of the Corral Bluffs specimens, DMNH EPV.95284 (Fig. 4d) and DMNH EPV.134082 (Fig. 5d), and anterior parts of them are present in DMNH EPV.136300 (Fig. 6d). Although fractured and deformed, they are also preserved in UCMP 98083 (Fig. 8d). Of these specimens, only DMNH EPV.134082 reveals faint sutures with surrounding bones (reconstructed in Fig. 10b) and even these must be characterized as somewhat uncertain. The anterior-most extent of the tentative suture with the maxilla is on the midline opposite the posterior quarter of M1. It extends laterally in a strong convexity and then posteriorly along a sinuous line until passing lateral to the pterygopalatine ridge and medial to the distal end of M2 and the retromolar extension of the maxilla. The fact that the maxillary-palatine sutures are symmetrically present on both sides in DMNH EPV.134082 provides some degree of confidence in their identification. It is clear that the central area of the palatines did not extend as far posteriorly as indicated in previous reconstructions and nor did they terminate medially in a very sharp point (Granger and Simpson 1929: fig. 6; Kielan-Jaworowska and Hurum 1997: fig. 11C; Wible et al. 2019: fig. 22C). Although the left and right palatines come together posteriorly to form a blunt, uvula-like tip that may have extended slightly past the level of the posterior margins of the left and right M2s, the main portions of the palatines did not. Also, although the posterior ends of the palatines appear to be slightly thickened toward the midline and potentially ventrally deflected slightly in DMNH EPV.134082 (Fig. 5d) and DMNH EPV.95284 (Fig. 4d), there is no convincing evidence for a large, strongly thickened, laterally expansive, markedly raised postpalatine torus as seen in several Late Cretaceous djadochtatherioids (see “Bony Palate” below). We therefore regard this feature to be absent in Taeniolabis, which is consistent with how it was scored by Rougier et al. (2016) and Wible et al. (2019). Finally, despite the new specimens, and µCT analysis of them as well as of previously known specimens, the positions of the major and minor palatine foramina cannot be discerned and whether or not the palatine has any exposure within the orbit also remains unknown.\n\nJugals\n\nBroom (1914: 128) reconstructed the jugal of Taeniolabis in AMNH 16321, stating that the anterior portion “did not reach far round the anterior orbital margin” and “probably had a postorbital process,” and that the posterior portion was “perfectly preserved” and “merely a narrow splint of bone.” Hopson et al. (1989:206), as had Simpson (1937b) previously, however, concluded that the presence or absence of a jugal in AMNH 16321 “cannot be determined due to the poor preservation of the bone surface on the zygoma.” We essentially concur with these authors but do see a depression on the medial aspect of the squamosal portion of the left zygomatic arch, along the dorsal half, that could represent a “scar” for the posterior end of the jugal (Fig. 7d). More anteriorly, there is a faint outline of what might be a suture for the rest of the element extending onto the zygomatic process of the maxilla. These traces are not convincing but are in approximately the same position as those depicted for the reconstructed zygomatic arch of Ptilodus depicted by Hopson et al. (1989: fig. 5); medial to the arch, along its dorsal aspect, and overlapping the maxilla-squamosal suture. Similarly suggestive, but not definitive, evidence of a jugal is present on the medial aspect of the right zygomatic arch of DMNH EPV.95284 (Fig. 4d). Digital segmentation of the right zygomatic arch of UCMP 98083, however, does reveal a fragment of bone that we tentatively interpret to be at least part of the anterior end of a jugal (Fig. 13). It sits within a shallow fossa on the medial aspect of the zygomatic arch but it is clearly incomplete, as indicated by broken surfaces. It likely would not have been visible in lateral view, at least not to the extent depicted by Broom (1914: fig. 8) and Granger and Simpson (1929: figs. 4, 5A), who showed it as a substantial element forming all of the ventrolateral rim of the orbit.\n\nThe dorsal margin of the preserved left zygomatic arch of AMNH 16321 is fragmentary in the region where one might expect a postorbital process indicating the position for attachment of the ventral end of the orbital ligament and marking the lower posterior boundary of the orbit. Broom (1914: fig. 8) had speculatively illustrated the postorbital process on the jugal, roughly opposite the postorbital process on the parietal. Although the zygomatic arches are not well preserved on DMNH EPV.95284 (Fig. 4), the narrowed, ridge-like dorsal edge may be preserved on the right side and, if so, indicates that the postorbital process is on the zygomatic process of the squamosal and slightly posterior to the position indicated by Broom; unfortunately, deformation and poor surface preservation of the specimen does not allow us to have confidence in that conclusion.\n\nFrontals\n\nThe frontals of T. taoensis were reconstructed by Broom (1914: fig. 6; followed by Granger and Simpson 1929: fig. 5A) in dorsal view, based on AMNH 16321, as small, flat, and unfused in the midline, with each having a long, straight medial margin, a shorter, slightly curved (concave posterolaterally) posterolateral margin, and an irregular margin anterolaterally that is still shorter. Overall, the frontals are in the shape of a stemmed arrowhead, with the acute tip directed posteriorly. The medial, posterolateral, and anterior/anterolateral margins articulate with the contralateral frontal, the parietal, and the nasal, respectively. The posterolateral suture, especially on the left side, is prominently displayed on DMNH EPV.134082, where its contact with the parietal has been substantially displaced (Fig. 5c, e). There is no contact with a lacrimal bone because that element is absent in Taeniolabis (see “Lacrimals” above).\n\nBroom (1914: fig. 8; followed by Granger and Simpson 1929: fig. 4) reconstructed the frontals as not contributing to either the dorsal orbital margin or to the medial orbital wall. Instead, the parietal was reconstructed as extending forward to contact the maxilla both above and within the orbit, thus contributing to the posterior part of the supraorbital margin (with the maxilla forming the anterior part) and also to the posterior part of the medial orbital wall. Digital segmentation of the medial orbital wall in DMNH EPV.136300 reveals that, although the parietal extends a process forward along the orbital rim to contact the nasal, it simply overlies the frontal in this area and the two main parts of the frontal, the dorsal frontal plate and the lateral orbital process, are connected deep to this parietal process (Fig. 12). Within the orbit, the frontal contacts the nasal anterodorsally and has a long, roughly horizontal contact ventrally with the maxilla, although parts of the intervening suture could not be fully discerned.\n\nParietal\n\nThe parietal of Taeniolabis, in dorsal view, is expansive. In the middle portion of its anteroposterior extent, it lies on either side of the frontals, the contact being V-shaped and paralleled posterolaterally by the low, rounded temporal ridges. Farther anteriorly, the parietal extends as narrow processes lateral to the frontals that pass so far forward that contact is made with the nasals anteromedially and, ultimately, with the facial processes of the maxillae anteriorly. Posterior to the acute V-shaped termination of the frontals, the parietal comprises the entire posterior portion of the roof of the cranial cavity. Although the posterior-most median portion of the parietal in AMNH 16321 (Fig. 7c) is broken away, and although the left temporal ridge is more fragmentary than the right temporal ridge, the portions that are preserved indicate that the temporal ridges converged ~32 mm from the back of the cranium but did not fully meet in the midline, thus forming a double-ridged sagittal crest, the long apices of the two, more-or-less parallel crests being separated by ~6 mm. This double sagittal crest is not particularly tall. By contrast, the sagittal crest in DMNH EPV.95284 (Fig. 4a–c, e, f) is considerably longer (~ 45 mm), taller, and is a single, prominent midline feature. The sagittal crest in DMNH EPV.134082 (Fig. 5a–c, e, f) is not as well preserved but appears to more closely resemble that of DMNH EPV.95284 than that of AMNH 16321 in length (~41 mm), prominence, and singularity. The nuchal crests are mostly broken away in AMNH 16321 (Fig. 7) but they are almost complete in DMNH EPV.95284 (Fig. 4) and DMNH EPV.134082 (Fig. 5), demonstrating that they were very prominent and sharp, flaring posteroventrolaterally (concave anteriorly) toward the squamosals, and overhang the concave occipital region. Unfortunately, the suture between the parietal and the squamosals cannot be identified with certainty in any of the available specimens and therefore it is impossible to know the relative contributions of each element to the nuchal crests. Similarly, the suture between the parietal and the occiput is obscured in all known specimens.\n\nDMNH EPV.95284 belies the conclusion of Simpson (1926: 233, 235) that “the sagittal and occipital [= lambdoid] crests are only moderately developed” in multituberculates and that “the temporal muscle was weak.” In this specimen (and DMNH EPV.134082, Fig. 5), these crests are very prominently developed. Gambaryan and Kielan-Jaworowska (1995: 82) had earlier observed that the sagittal crest is “prominent” in Taeniolabis (and Lambdopsalis).\n\nGambaryan and Kielan-Jaworowska (1995: 85) inferred the position of the postorbital process in Taeniolabis from illustrations in Broom (1914) as being “small and situated on the anterior part of the parietal.” We can confirm this position and the fact that it is a swelling rather than a distinct, pointed process from direct observation of AMNH 16321 (Fig. 7c) and DMNH EPV.95284 (Fig. 4c). This region is not well enough preserved on DMNH EPV.134082 to make similar assessments. Deformation of the cranium of DMNH EPV.95284 makes a conclusive determination of the size of the process difficult but, on the left side, it appears to be quite prominent.\n\nOrbitosphenoids/Alisphenoids (and Anterior Lamina of the Petrosal)\n\nSutures between the elements of the lateral wall of the braincase could not be distinguished in any of the specimens in our sample, including the extent of the orbitosphenoid, alisphenoid, and anterior lamina of the petrosal (see “Petrosals” section below). Nevertheless, a few features are visible. A large foramen for the mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve is visible in UCMP 98083 (Fig. 14d). It is oval (anteroposteriorly longer than dorsoventrally tall). A possible foramen for the ramus superior of the stapedial artery is visible roughly in the center of the lateral braincase wall in DMNH EPV.95284 (Fig. 4b) and UCMP 98083 (Fig. 8b). A deep groove extends anterodorsally from it along the lateral braincase wall.\n\nBasisphenoid/Presphenoid\n\nA subtle, low, rounded midline ridge extending directly forward from the basioccipital ridge toward the posterior margin of the choanae can be seen in DMNH EPV.134082 (Figs. 5d and 14c) and, to a lesser extent, in DMNH EPV.95284 (Figs. 4d and 14b). We interpret this ridge to be comprised of the basisphenoid and presphenoid, as interpreted for other multituberculates (e.g., Miao 1988; Wible and Rougier 2000), but, owing to poor surface preservation in these specimens, sutures delimiting either of these small elements are impossible to discern.\n\nPterygoids\n\nSutures that would delimit the margins of the pterygoid also cannot be seen in any of the available cranial specimens of T. taoensis but presence of the bone is indicated by tall, elongate, symmetrically curved (concave laterally) ridges that extend posteriorly from the end of the palate (reconstructed in Fig. 10b). Barghusen (1986) termed these structures ‘pterygopalatine ridges.’ More specifically, these ridges in Taeniolabis pass posteriorly from opposite the distolingual margin of M2 and then gently curve laterally, diverging slightly from one another before merging seamlessly (i.e., without a discernible suture) in the region of the promontorium on the petrosal. Although relatively poorly preserved in DMNH EPV.95284 (Figs. 4d and 14b), the pterygopalatine ridges are reasonably well preserved in DMNH EPV.134082 (Figs. 5d and 14c), where the one on the left side seems to be the least disturbed by postmortem taphonomic processes (the anterior part of the right ridge is displaced medially into the basipharyngeal canal). It is assumed that these pterygopalatine ridges articulate dorsally and/or laterally with the alisphenoids and that they articulate with the presphenoid/basisphenoid duo medially but this cannot be documented in any of the available specimens. Because of the poor surface preservation of this region in all available specimens, there is also no distinct pterygoid hamulus in evidence.\n\nSquamosals\n\nThe right zygomatic arch of AMNH 16321, except for a small section anteriorly, contributed by the zygomatic process of the maxilla, is composed almost entirely of plaster and the left arch is fragmented, with several small missing gaps having been filled with plaster, but not significantly deformed (compare Fig. 3a, b with Fig. 7). The zygomatic arches in DMNH EPV.95284 are preserved almost in their entirety (except for a short posterior section of the right arch) but are markedly bilaterally asymmetrical because of differential preservation and deformation (Figs. 2a, b and 4). Only the posterior half of the left zygomatic arch and very short anterior and posterior sections of the right zygomatic arch are preserved in DMNH EPV.134082 (Figs. 2c, d and 5), only the anterior roots of the arches are preserved in DMNH EPV.136300 (Fig. 6), and only an anterior portion of the right zygomatic arch is preserved in the juvenile cranium UCMP 98083 (Greenwald 1988: fig. 1A; Fig. 8). Measurements of depth and width of the zygomatic arches, where available, are provided in Table 5.\n\nAMNH 16321 (Fig. 7a) and UCMP 98083 (Fig. 8b) exhibit an obliquely oriented suture (from anterodorsal to posteroventral) between the zygomatic process of the squamosal and the zygomatic process of the maxilla, the suture ending posteroventrally at slightly less than midlength along the zygomatic arch. This is as depicted in lateral views by Broom (1914: fig. 8) and Granger and Simpson (1929: fig. 4), and in Figs. 7a, 8b, and 10c. The illustrations by Broom and by Granger and Simpson added a short dorsal section of the suture that turned posteriorly again, creating an asymmetrical V-shaped suture in lateral view. The dorsal margin of the zygomatic arch of AMNH 16321 is broken away anteriorly, precluding clear evidence for this, as well for a jugal that is depicted as rising above the level of the arch. UCMP 98083 (Fig. 8b) is inconclusive in demonstrating the shape of the maxillary-squamosal suture but indicates that the jugal probably did not rise above the dorsal margin of the zygomatic arch. Only the ventral-most part of this suture is visible on the medial side; more dorsally, the suture appears to be obscured by the diminutive jugal (see “Jugals” section above).\n\nThe cross-sectional shape of the zygomatic process of the squamosal is essentially that of a tall, isosceles triangle, the most acute angle of which is positioned dorsally. In lateral view, it is distinctly arched, convex dorsally and concave ventrally. Gambaryan and Kielan-Jaworowska (1995) identified intermediate and posterior zygomatic ridges (purportedly for the origins of masseter superficialis pars posterior and masseter medialis pars posterior, respectively), as seen on the squamosal of djadochtatherioid multituberculates, the anterior zygomatic ridge (purportedly for origin of masseter superficialis pars anterior) being situated more anteriorly and confined to the lateral surface of the maxilla. As stated above (section on “Maxillae”), Kielan-Jaworowska et al. (2005), based on observation of photographs in Broom (1914: pls. XI, XII) and a personal communication from Yaoming Hu, identified anterior and intermediate zygomatic ridges in AMNH 16321 and thereby implied comparability to the situation in djadochtatherioids. Our examination of the left zygomatic arch of AMNH 16321 indicates that some qualification is necessary. An elongate, shallow, lenticular depression facing ventrolaterally (more ventrally than laterally) on the squamosal extends anteriorly from just lateral to the anterior end of the glenoid fossa to approximately mid-length on the arch, anterior to the maxilla-squamosal suture. The lateral margin of this depression is likely equivalent to the intermediate zygomatic ridge of Gambaryan and Kielan-Jaworowska (1995) but it is important to emphasize that the depression itself faces more ventrally than it does laterally (unlike in djadochtatherioids). Following Gambaryan and Kielan-Jaworowska (1995), the depression served as the site of origin for pars posterior of the superficial masseter. Medial to this depression is a shallow groove that, following the inferences of Gambaryan and Kielan-Jaworowska (1995), may have served as the origin for masseter lateralis. It is relatively wide posteriorly, extending forward from just anterior to the glenoid fossa; the level of its anterior termination is not distinct.\n\nThe glenoid fossa, best preserved on AMNH 16321 (Fig. 7d) and DMNH EPV.134082 (Fig. 5d), is very large and somewhat tear-drop shaped (the sharp apex of the tear situated anterolaterally), being slightly longer anteroposteriorly than wide mediolaterally, although its anterior termination is not distinct (see estimated measurements in Table 5). Its longitudinal axis is not strictly anteroposterior but, instead, trends in a slightly anterolateral to posteromedial direction. The articular surface of the fossa is flat anteroposteriorly but shallowly concave from medial to lateral, with distinct rims both anteromedially and posterolaterally, as best seen in AMNH 16321 (Fig. 7d).\n\nAs stated above (see “Parietal”), the suture between the parietal and the squamosals cannot be discerned in any of the available specimens but, farther laterally, immediately anterior to the very prominent nuchal crests, Granger and Simpson (1929: fig. 5A) identified a partial suture between the squamosal and the petrosal in dorsal view.\n\nPetrosals\n\nThe description of the petrosal of T. taoensis is based on DMNH EPV.95284, DMNH EPV.134082, and UCMP 98083 (Fig. 14). Of those specimens, DMNH EPV.95284 is the most intact but the surface of the petrosal is altered because of postmortem taphonomic processes, and some finer structures are therefore difficult to discern. Furthermore, the density difference between sediment and bone is poor in this specimen and, as such, µCT data cannot aid significantly in identification of foramina or in tracing pathways of nerves and vessels. Although the external surface of UCMP 98083 (Fig. 14d) preserves greater detail (e.g., muscular attachments, grooves, foramina) than DMNH EPV.95284 (Fig. 14b), the basicranium of this specimen is more deformed. The ventral surface of the petrosal of DMNH EPV.134082 (Fig. 14c) is highly altered, however similarities between DMNH EPV.134082 and DMNH EPV.95284, including, for example, the position of the jugular fossa and promontorium, are evident. The density difference between sediment and bone is likewise poor in DMNH EPV.134082, particularly on the left side. The contrast is slightly better on the right side, where the inner ear is discernible. Most of the petrosal of AMNH 16321 is reconstructed in plaster and does not preserve actual morphology.\n\nIn ventral view, the promontorium is anteromedially-posterolaterally oriented, elongate, and forms a distinct ridge that divides the middle ear cavity into two deeply excavated spaces (Fig. 14). The surface of the promontorium does not appear to bear any distinct grooves for the internal carotid or stapedial arteries. This is best seen in the partially preserved promontorium of UCMP 98083 (Fig. 14d). DMNH EPV.95284 (Fig. 14b) does not preserve any grooves either, although it should again be noted that the surfaces of the petrosal are preservationally altered, and it is possible that any grooves might have simply been obliterated in the process. Much of the right promontorium is covered in matrix in DMNH EPV.134082 and that of the left is too poorly preserved to evaluate its surface morphology (Fig. 14c).\n\nBased on the µCT scans and preserved external morphology of the specimens, it cannot be confirmed whether the perilymphatic duct exited the inner ear through a perilymphatic groove from the perilymphatic foramen or was enclosed in a cochlear canaliculus (and that a true fenestra cochleae was present). In UCMP 98083 (Fig. 14d), a faint groove is visible on a block close to the perilymphatic foramen/fenestra cochleae, possibly representing a perilymphatic groove, but the block is separated from the petrosal and rotated out of position, and it is therefore unclear whether it truly connected to the perilymphatic foramen in life. Nevertheless, we tentatively refer to the foramen as the “perilymphatic foramen” in the description and comparison, as it is present in all multituberculates known to date.\n\nThe shape and size of the fenestra vestibuli and perilymphatic foramen are not obvious in DMNH EPV.95284 and DMNH EPV.134082 and are obscured by a large fracture in UCMP 98083. The fenestra vestibuli appears large in UCMP 98083, but the true size is difficult to estimate as the posterior and anterior edges appear to be broken (Fig. 14d). Separating the perilymphatic foramen and fenestra vestibuli is a short, narrow, and posteriorly trending bony ridge, the crista interfenestralis. Medial to the crista interfenestralis and extending along the whole length of the promontorium is a deeply excavated jugular fossa. The jugular fossa is somewhat teardrop-shaped, with a larger and rounded posterior edge and a narrower anterior edge. The outline and size of the fossa is best seen on the right side of DMNH EPV.95284. Although the position of the fossa is also recognizable in DMNH EPV.134082 (Fig. 14c), its size appears to be considerably exaggerated by erosion. The broken fragment next to the perilymphatic foramen obscures the posterior aspect of the right jugular fossa in UCMP 98083, but the anterior aspect is visible and confirms the shape seen in the DMNH specimens (the left jugular fossa is not visible). There are several small openings in the lateral wall of the jugular fossa (along the posteromedial edge of the promontorium). Based on the poor quality of preservation, it is unclear if these represent exposed emissary veins that drained medially into the inferior petrosal sinus or actual foramina for veins that drained medially from the inferior petrosal sinus into the jugular fossa (Fig. 14d).\n\nThe crista interfenestralis is continuous with the paroccipital process posteriorly dividing the rear of the middle ear cavity (divided post-promontorial tympanic recess). The space lateral to the crista interfenestralis and promontorium is likewise deeply excavated and extends slightly farther anteriorly than the jugular fossa (DMNH EPV.95284, Fig. 14b). Laterally, a prominent crista parotica defines the border of the lateral space, best seen in DMNH EPV.95284 (Fig. 14b), UCMP 98083 (Fig. 14d), and on the right side of DMNH EPV.134082 (Fig. 14c). At the posterior aspect of the lateral space, along a slightly elevated shelf, is an elongate fossa for the stapedius muscle (Fig. 14b, d). The stapedius fossa is best seen in UCMP 98083 and is barely visible in the DMNH specimens. The stapedius fossa does not seem to extend onto the lateral aspect of the crista interfenestralis as in Kryptobaatar and Guibaatar (Wible and Rougier 2000; Wible et al. 2019). The posterior wall of the lateral space is formed by the base of the paroccipital process. The paroccipital process is distinct, small, and rounded, extending ventrally only slightly past the surface of the petrosal. This is much smaller than reconstructed by Granger and Simpson (1929: fig. 5B), who illustrated it extending ventral to the level of the occipital condyles.\n\nThe crista parotica is anteromedially confluent with a broad and low lateral flange. The lateral flange is medially inflected and contacts the promontorium anteriorly (Fig. 14b–d). At the anterior tip of the lateral flange is a small foramen that could represent the canal for the ramus inferior of the stapedial artery (Fig. 14b, d). However, the foramen could not be traced through the µCT scans and its course is uncertain.\n\nSeveral other foramina should pierce the crista parotica and lateral flange but are not visible on the external surface or in the µCT scans of any of the specimens, including the foramen for the ramus superior of the stapedial artery, tympanic aperture of the prootic canal (for the prootic sinus), and the secondary facial foramen (for the facial nerve). This is clearly due to poor preservation and does not represent absence of the foramina as those foramina (or a combination of them) are generally present in multituberculates (see “Comparisons and Discussion”). Lateral to the crista parotica lies the epitympanic recess. The fossa incudis, for the crus breve of the incus, is not preserved in any of the specimens. In other multituberculates the posterior aspect of the epitympanic recess houses a narrow fossa incudis (Kryptobaatar, Wible and Rougier 2000; cf. Tombaatar, Ladevèze et al. 2010; Mangasbaatar, Rougier et al. 2016). Anterior to the epitympanic recess, in what possibly represents the anterior lamina, appears to be a large foramen that opens endocranially into the cavum epiptericum. The opening is best visible in UCMP 98083 (fmV in Fig. 14d), and appears to be a single large foramen, but due to poor preservation we cannot rule out that it is a fossa with two distinct foramina. We interpret this foramen to be an opening for the mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve. Finally, in occipital view, the posttemporal foramen, which we assume lies within the petrosal, is large; it is best preserved on the left sides of DMNH EPV.134082 (Fig. 5f) and UCMP 98083 (Fig. 8f). It is surrounded by a funnel-shaped entryway, the posttemporal fossa.\n\nThe following description of the inner ear of Taeniolabis is primarily based on UCMP 98083, the best-preserved specimen for this region in the sample (Fig. 15; measurements in Table 6). Much of the inner ear is intact in UCMP 98083 (aside from parts of the semicircular canals), but the endocast is infilled with sediment that has nearly the same density as the bone, which makes differentiation of the endocast difficult in some areas (e.g., cochlear canal on the left, semicircular canals on the right). Overall, the cochlear canal and vestibule can be better differentiated on the right side, whereas the semicircular canals are more visible on the left side. Some information can be gleaned from DMNH EPV.95284. The density difference between bone and sediment infill of the endocast is worse than in UCMP 98083, but still allowed for tracing a very coarse outline of the right and left inner ears. The outline, however, might not as reliably present true morphology. The right inner ear is discernible in DMNH EPV.134082. The density contrast is much poorer on the left side where only the vestibule and parts of the semicircular canals are visible. The inner ear is not preserved among the basicranial fragments present in AMNH 16321.\n\nThe cochlear canal is only gently curved laterally in dorsal or ventral view (49°). The basal portion of the canal is directed anteromedially, then curves to an anterolateral direction (Fig. 15). The slender cochlear canal gently changes from a relatively round cross section at the apex to a more oval cross section at the base, with a width and height of 1.8 mm and 2.0 mm at mid-length. The right cochlear canal measures 7.8 mm in length (measured from the apex to the contact of the vestibule and cochlear canal). The left cochlear canal is slightly longer (8.7 mm), however its outline is less visible in the µCT scans and we believe that the 7.8 mm measured on the right is a more accurate representation of the morphology. The cochlear canal constitutes about 8.1% of cranial length in the juvenile UCMP 98083. The apex of the cochlear canal is only very gently expanded, possibly indicating the presence of a lagena macula (Fig. 15). A separate canal for the lagenar nerve could not be discerned in the µCT scans. This does not necessarily imply the absence of such a canal because the density contrast in the specimen is simply not sufficient to clearly delimit whether a lagenar nerve canal was present or not. The cochlear nerve passes into the cochlear canal through what appears to be a single foramen along the dorsal aspect of the canal. Lack of contrast makes it unclear whether any bony support structures for the cochlear nerve or hearing membrane existed. Given that the cochlear nerve passes through a single foramen in most multituberculates (Meng and Wyss 1995; Fox and Meng 1997; Ladevèze et al. 2010; Luo et al. 2016; Csiki-Sava et al. 2018; Wible et al. 2019), it is plausible that the failure to see such structures in UCMP 98083 and DMNH EPV.134082 might represent actual absence of a cribriform plate and primary or secondary bony laminae.\n\nThe vestibule of Taeniolabis is large, with a volume of 253–270 mm3. It is smooth and rounded and does not provide any indications for the boundaries of the utricle or saccule. The vestibular nerve could not be traced reliably in the µCT scans and can thus not aid in the identification of the saccule or utricle. Of note is that the fenestra vestibuli opens into the vestibule, indicating that the scala vestibuli is incorporated into the inflation of the vestibule. The ampullae are slightly rounded and, in parts, difficult to differentiate from the enlarged vestibule.\n\nThe semicircular canals are better differentiated on the left side of UCMP 98083; although also present on the right side, the sediment infill on the right (Fig. 15b–f) is nearly the same density as the bony labyrinth and the canals could not be as reliably traced as on the left (Fig. 15g–k). The radius of curvature of the three semicircular canals is fairly similar, with the posterior canal being slightly the largest (Table 6). The difference in radius of curvature between the posterior canal and the lateral and anterior canals is greater on the left than on the right, which might be driven by a fracture in the left posterior semicircular canal. The left posterior semicircular canal exhibits a peculiar bend, but the corresponding part on the right could not be traced and it is unclear what the actual morphology might have looked like. The anterior and posterior semicircular canals meet to form a long and robust crus commune. A secondary crus commune is absent; the lateral and posterior semicircular canals do not merge but remain separate, leading to two ampullae.\n\nInterparietal\n\nDiscrimination of sutures in the occipital region is insufficient on any of the available specimens to resolve whether or not an interparietal (or, more finely, a postparietal and left and right tabulars) is preserved.\n\nOccipital\n\nThe boundaries of the various components of the occipital bone (supraoccipital, paired exoccipitals, basioccipital) cannot be observed on any of the adult cranial specimens preserving the occipital region in our sample (DMNH EPV.95284, DMNH EPV.134082, AMNH 16321) simply because the sutures necessary to do so are either fused or obscured, with or without the aid of µCT imagery. There is, however, suggestive evidence of the ventral aspects of the sutures between the supraoccipital and left and right exoccipitals in the juvenile cranium of UCMP 98083 (Fig. 8f). These slant from dorsolateral to ventromedial and indicate that the supraoccipital contributed to a small median portion of the dorsal margin of the foramen magnum. The dorsal boundary of the supraoccipital, presumably with the parietal, cannot be discerned.\n\nIt is not possible to know how much of the nuchal region of the cranium is contributed by the occipital (in addition to, potentially, the parietal, interparietal, petrosal, and squamosal), again because sutures are not visible, even in UCMP 98083. Furthermore, because of the poor surface preservation of the Corral Bluffs specimens and incomplete preservation, fragmentation, and/or deformation of the San Juan Basin specimens, other osteological features expected to be found in, or bordering on, the occipital cannot be differentiated. Despite these limitations, some major features of the occipital region of T. taoensis can be described for the first time.\n\nThe occipital region is tall and, assuming that an interparietal is not present (see reviews of distribution among fossil and extant mammaliaforms in Koyabu et al. 2012; Krause 2014b), ends dorsally in prominent nuchal crests. Whether or not the occipital bone extends to actually participate in the nuchal crests cannot be discerned but it does so, or nearly so, in all multituberculates for which this region is known (see “Comparisons and Discussion”). The nuchal crests themselves are very prominent, joining with the equally prominent sagittal crest of the parietal in a triple junction to form a salient, peaked external occipital protuberance. This therefore differs strongly from the reconstructions by Broom (1914: fig. 8) and Granger and Simpson (1929: fig. 4), at least in lateral view, where the posterodorsal outline of the cranium appears more evenly rounded (convex posterodorsally). Furthermore, the position of the external occipital protuberance is farther posterior than depicted by Broom (1914: fig. 6) and Granger and Simpson (1929: fig. 5A). The nuchal area dorsal and lateral to the foramen magnum, between it and the prominent nuchal crests, is concave. Overall, because the occipital condyles lie slightly posterior to the level of the external occipital protuberance, the nuchal area is slightly slanted from anterodorsal to posteroventral in lateral view.\n\nThe occipital condyles, previously unknown in T. taoensis, are preserved in DMNH EPV.95284 (Figs. 4b, d, f and 14b) but are best preserved in DMNH EPV.134082 (Figs. 5a–d, f and 14c). They project posteriorly, slightly beyond a transverse line formed by the nuchal crests, which is farther posterior than speculatively reconstructed by Broom (1914: fig. 6) and especially Granger and Simpson (1929: figs. 5A, 6). The condyles themselves, in posterior view, occupy the lower third of the area surrounding the foramen magnum and are large and rounded posteriorly and ventrally. In ventral view, the condyles are separated by a broad, V-shaped (approximately 90º) odontoid (= intercondyloid) notch. In posterior view, the foramen magnum, as preserved in DMNH EPV.95284 (Fig. 4f) and DMNH EPV.134082 (Fig. 5f), is triangular in shape, slightly wider than tall (Table 5), with each of the two dorsolateral sides of the triangle being straight, posteriorly projecting crests. The foramen appears to be more rounded laterally in the juvenile UCMP 98083 (Fig. 8f). The foramen itself is directed straight posteriorly. A linear, vertically oriented projection of bone midway between the dorsal margin of the foramen magnum and the external occipital protuberance on DMNH EPV.95284 (Fig. 4f) represents a remnant of the external occipital crest. The crest is more faintly visible in DMNH EPV.134082 (Fig. 5f), AMNH 16321 (Fig. 7f), and UCMP 98083 (Fig. 8f).\n\nThe basioccipital, on the ventral surface immediately anterior to the foramen magnum, is poorly preserved in all of the specimens. The best indication of its morphology is preserved in DMNH EPV.134082, where a low, midline ridge, with two shallow fossae on either side of it, extends anteriorly for a short distance (Fig. 14c). Farther laterally, the basioccipital contributes a significant medial border of the jugular fossae. A faint, transverse suture anterior to the low, midline ridge and two shallow fossae flanking it may mark the position of the spheno-occipital synchondrosis in DMNH EPV.134082.\n\nDentary\n\nThe dentary of T. taoensis has been described and/or illustrated by Cope (1884a: fig. 3a–d; 1884b: pl. XXIIIc, fig. 1, 1a–c [specimen number not provided]), Osborn and Earle (1895: fig. IA, C [specimen number not provided]), Gregory (1910: fig. 8 – AMNH 748 and AMNH 968), Broom (1914: fig. 8 and pl. XI – AMNH 748), Simpson (1926: fig. 5D [specimen number not provided]); Granger and Simpson (1929: fig. 4 – AMNH 16310; condyle based on AMNH 745; reproduced or redrawn in Matthew 1937: fig. 71; Simpson 1937a: fig. 3A; Simpson 1937b: fig. 3D; Sloan 1981: fig. 6.14; Kielan-Jaworowska and Hurum 1997: fig. 12 [coronoid process based on holotype dentary of T. lamberti, CCM 70–110]; Kielan-Jaworowska et al. 2004: fig. 8.40C; Weil and Krause 2008: fig. 2.2A; Rougier et al. 2016: fig. 31; Wible et al. 2019: fig. 21C), Greenwald (1988: fig. 1B, C – UCMP 98083), Gurovich (2006: fig. 4.7 [specimen number not provided]), and Kondrashov and Lucas (2015: fig. 4 – NMMNH P-8631). The following descriptions and comparisons are based primarily on first-hand examination of DMNH EPV.130973 (Figs. 2g, h, 9a–c) and AMNH 16310 (Figs. 3c, d and 9d–f), complemented with observations from µCT-scanned images of the juvenile dentaries of UCMP 98083 (Fig. 8g–l; see also Greenwald (1988: fig. 1B, C) and photographs of AMNH 745 (Fig. 3e, f), AMNH 748 (Fig. 3g, h), AMNH 968, and AMNH 27734 (Fig. 3i–n). DMNH EPV.130973 (Figs. 2g, h and 9a–c) is among the most complete dentaries known for T. taoensis and is missing only the dorsal portions of the coronoid process, the terminus of the mandibular condyle, and a few inconsequential fragments elsewhere; its surface preservation, however, is not as pristine as that of AMNH 16310 (Figs. 3c, d and 9d–f). The horizontal ramus of AMNH 16310 is complete and very well preserved but only the anterior half of the ascending ramus is preserved; as such, much of the coronoid process, much of the pterygoid and masseteric fossae, and all of the mandibular condyle are missing. Both dentaries of UCMP 98083 (Fig. 8g–l) are preserved but both are missing large portions (particularly posteriorly), have numerous cracks, and are considerably deformed. AMNH 745, AMNH 748, AMNH 968, and AMNH 27734 reveal more of the coronoid process and mandibular condyle than is preserved in DMNH EPV.130973, AMNH 16310, and UCMP 98083. Combined, these specimens permit a full reconstruction of the dentary of T. taoensis (Fig. 10f–h) and indicate significant changes to the size, shape, and position of the coronoid process and mandibular condyle.\n\nThe prior descriptions and illustrations of the dentary have revealed or confirmed that the horizontal ramus houses i1, p4, and m1–2; that there is a long diastema between i1 and p4; and that the ramus is short and deep (see Table 7 for measurements). The horizontal rami are also extraordinarily thick mediolaterally and meet anteriorly at an included angle of approximately 40–45º (precise measurement is not possible because of the difficulty of orienting specimens consistently and because the symphysis is unfused; see also fig. 1C in Osborn and Earle 1895). Given that the cheektooth row is set obliquely relative to the longitudinal axis of the dentary, and given the inferred palinal direction of the power stroke of the chewing cycle, the left and right rows would have been roughly parallel in life.\n\nIn lateral view, the ventral margin of the dentary is sinuous (most strongly developed in AMNH 16310; Figs. 3c, d and 9d, e): convex anteriorly in the region of the incisor root (ventral to the diastema), concave ventral to m1, and convex posteriorly (ventral to the masseteric fossa). The posterior convexity extends posterodorsally in a smooth arc toward the condyle in DMNH EPV.130973 but has a bend that is variably expressed in AMNH 745, AMNH 748, AMNH 968, and AMNH 27734. The ventral surface below the masseteric fossa is notable in being wide (widest at midlength and tapering anteriorly and posteriorly), flat, and strongly tilted in the coronal plane from ventrolateral to dorsomedial. The dorsal margin of the horizontal ramus is strongly concave in the region of the diastema, with the section above the incisor root being at an approximate right angle to the section anterior to the root of p4. On the lateral aspect of the dentary, a single mental foramen is present, situated anterior to and below the nadir in the arc of the dorsal margin of the diastema. The foramen is small; the canal immediately deep to it, measured in AMNH 16310, is only approximately, on average, 1.15 mm in diameter, which seems extraordinarily small for such a large animal.\n\nThe masseteric fossa is defined by anterodorsal and anteroventral margins (variably expressed as ridges) and extends anteriorly onto the horizontal ramus in the adult specimens in the sample, converging to a rounded point below p4. In the left dentary of UCMP 98083 (Fig. 8g), which represents a juvenile individual, this point appears to be slightly more posteriorly positioned, ventral to the anterior part of m1, but it is below p4 on the right (Fig. 8j). The names applied to the anteroventral margin of the masseteric fossa were reviewed by Gambaryan and Kielan-Jaworowska (1995); we follow those authors in referring to it as the masseteric crest even though it presents as a low rounded ridge in T. taoensis. Passing posteriorly, where it intersects the ventral margin of the dentary in lateral view, the masseteric crest becomes the masseteric line, which continues posteriorly and then posterodorsally to form the ventral and posteroventral borders of the masseteric fossa. Both DMNH EPV.130973 (Fig. 9a) and AMNH 16310 (Fig. 9d) reveal a gently curved ridge, convex anteriorly, inside the masseteric fossa that begins dorsally at the approximate level of the embrasure between m1 and m2. There appears to be good evidence for this ridge in the photographs of AMNH 748 (Fig. 3g) and AMNH 968 (not illustrated) as well, but it is less clear in those of AMNH 745 (Fig. 3e) and AMNH 27734 (Fig. 3i). When present, the ridge descends through the masseteric fossa and becomes less distinct as it continues ventrally to ultimately intersect the masseteric line close to where the latter transitions to the masseteric crest. We refer to this feature as ‘intramasseteric ridge 1.’ The depression anterior to the ridge, bounded anteriorly by the convergence of the anterodorsal and anteroventral (masseteric crest) margins is the masseteric fovea (fovea massetericus of Gambaryan and Kielan-Jaworowska 1995). In other words, the masseteric fovea is the anterior-most component of the masseteric fossa (which is not the case for all multituberculates – see “Comparisons and Discussion” below). It is likely that intramasseteric ridge 1 represents the dividing line between portions of the masseter muscle. Gambaryan and Kielan-Jaworowska (1995) regarded the fovea as serving as the insertion area of masseter medialis pars anterior (anterior deep masseter of Sloan 1979 but also known as the infraorbital portion of zygomaticomandibularis Druzinsky et al. 2011), whereas the rest of the masseter muscle inserted posterior to the fossa. Farther posteriorly, at least as seen in DMNH EPV.130973 (Fig. 9a), the masseteric fossa is divided by another ridge, here termed ‘intramasseteric ridge 2,’ which ascends from the masseteric line where it changes directions from the ventral to the posteroventral boundary of the massteric fossa. The ridge appears to become less distinct dorsally but this observation is based on DMNH EPV.130973, which exhibits some breakage in the area (Fig. 9a). This ridge presumably marks yet another division of the masseter muscle. Based on DMNH EPV.130973 (Fig. 9a) and AMNH 27734 (Fig. 3i) in particular, we infer that the masseteric fossa (and the dentary as a whole) was shorter posteriorly than reconstructed by earlier workers (e.g., Granger and Simpson 1929: fig. 4A), in part because the mandibular condyle was not suspended on a long, posterodorsally projecting condylar process.\n\nKielan-Jaworowska et al. (2005) inferred the presence of a masseteric protuberance in Taeniolabis taoensis based on illustrations in Granger and Simpson (1929: fig. 4) and Simmons (1987: fig. 4.4). In AMNH 16310, DMNH EPV.130973, and UCMP 98083, all of which preserve good surface detail in this region, however, the masseteric crest, defining the anteroventral border of the masseteric fossa, does not end abruptly anteriorly in an enlargement similar to that identified as a protuberance in forms like Catopsbaatar (Kielan-Jaworowska et al. 2005: figs. 7; 9B1) or Djadochtatherium (Kielan-Jaworowska and Hurum 1997: fig. 5A). Indeed, the anteroventral margin of the masseteric fossa becomes less distinct as it passes anteriorly. We also see no evidence of a protuberance in the photographs of AMNH 745, AMNH 748, AMNH 968, or AMNH 27734. Finally, it must be noted that Fig. 4.4 in Simmons (1987) is of the holotype dentary (CCM 70–110) of T. lamberti (not T. taoensis) and the anteroventral margin of the masseteric fossa is broken posteriorly, thus precluding determination of relative prominence along the margin and confident appraisal of the presence or absence of a masseteric protuberance; we suspect it did not exist in that species either.\n\nOn the medial side of the horizontal ramus, the mandibular symphysis is unfused (contra Weil and Krause 2008). It occupies much of the area ventral to the diastema and is comma-shaped with the head of the comma positioned anteriorly and the tail trailing posteriorly along the ventral aspect of the ramus; this is most pristinely preserved and best seen on AMNH 16310 (Fig. 9e). AMNH 16310 exhibits a distinct ridge passing posteroventrally from the dorsal portion of the symphysis, ending below the mesial portion of m1; this ridge is much less distinct on DMNH EPV.130973 (Fig. 9b). In coronal section, the medial side of the horizontal ramus below the cheek teeth is gently concave (AMNH 16310) to almost flat (DMNH EPV.130973), bounded inferiorly by a ridge that becomes stronger as it passes posteriorly to form the ventral border of the pterygoid fossa, the pterygoid shelf, on the ascending ramus. As measured on the medial side of both DMNH EPV.130973 and AMNH 16310, the occlusal plane of the molars lies at an angle of approximately 20° relative to the ventral surface of the dentary; this is considerably higher than scored for Taeniolabis in recent phylogenetic analyses by, for example, Kielan-Jaworowska and Hurum (2001: char. 35, “11–17 degrees”), Mao et al. (2016: char. 7, “11–17 degrees”), and Wible et al. (2019: char. 73, “equal to or less than 10°”).\n\nThe pterygoid fossa, more complete on DMNH EPV.130973 (Fig. 9b) than on AMNH 16310 (Fig. 9e), is massive and deeply excavated laterally and anteriorly, providing a huge insertion area for the medial pterygoid muscle. Its anterior border is very distinct and gently convex anteriorly, merging ventrally with a very strong pterygoid shelf (pterygoid crest of Simpson 1926), which bounds the entire ventral aspect of the fossa. The pterygoid shelf itself is very wide but narrows as it ascends posterodorsally toward the posterior margin of the mandibular condyle, just as the pterygoid fossa becomes shallower posteriorly. The mandibular foramen, for passage of the inferior alveolar nerve, could not be identified in any of the specimens available to us, either on the specimens themselves or through µCT imagery. It is likely to have been positioned as in T. lamberti, on the anterior wall of the pterygoid fossa at a level below m2 (see Simmons 1987).\n\nThe size and shape of the mandibular condyle and its position relative to the rest of the dentary have not been well documented previously. It is not preserved on any of the specimens we were able to examine firsthand (DMNH EPV.130973, AMNH 16310) or through µCT imagery (UCMP 98083) but is preserved on the specimens for which we have photographs (AMNH 745, AMNH 748, AMNH 968, AMNH 27734), courtesy of AMNH curator Jin Meng, and therefore can now be documented more fully. The condyle is best preserved on AMNH 27734 and is illustrated here in four views (Fig. 3k–n). The condyle was not as large and globular or with as long a neck as reconstructed by past authors (e.g., Osborn and Earle 1895; fig. 1A, C; Gregory 1910; fig. 8; Granger and Simpson 1929; fig. 4A), and certainly not as much as reconstructed in plaster on AMNH 16310 (Fig. 3c, d). In dorsal view (Fig. 3m), the condyle is lenticular in shape, strongly convex posteriorly and gently concave anteriorly, with the ridge passing anteriorly to form the mandibular notch doing so from the medial side of the condyle. In posterior view (Fig. 3n), the condyle extends only a short distance onto the posterior surface and has a distinctly convex ventral margin. The lateral and medial views (Fig. 3k, l) document a short and unconstricted condylar neck and a gently convex dorsal surface that becomes more convex posteriorly. The mandibular notch, in side view, is evenly rounded (concave dorsally) extending forward from the condyle and merging with the posterior margin of the coronoid process (Fig. 3i, j).\n\nThe coronoid process is incomplete in all specimens known to us; it was reconstructed as very low by Cope (1884a: fig. 3a, b; 1884b: pl. XXIIIc, fig. 1, 1a), who also incorrectly reconstructed a distinct angular process, as very tall and recurved by Osborn and Earle (1895: fig. 1A), and as moderately tall and recurved by Broom (1914: fig. 8) and Granger and Simpson (1929: fig. 4A). The process is, however, nearly complete and well preserved in AMNH 27734 (Fig. 3i, j), missing only some fragments along the posterior edge; it is the only specimen preserving the full anterior margin and dorsal tip. This specimen demonstrates that the coronoid process, while moderately tall, was likely not recurved, at least not strongly. The anterior base of the process is also at least partially preserved in DMNH EPV.130973 (Figs. 2g, h and 9a, b), AMNH 745 (Fig. 3e, f), AMNH 748 (Fig. 3g, h), AMNH 968, and AMNH 16310 (Figs. 3c, d and 9d, e). In lateral view, the anterior base arises opposite the posterior portion of m1 (i.e., m2 not visible in this view; DMNH EPV.130973, AMNH 748, AMNH 16310) or the anterior portion of m2 (AMNH 968, AMNH 27734). Acknowledging that there is also variability depending upon how the dentary is oriented, this is in slight contrast to Simmons (1987) who observed that it arises only opposite m1 and used it as a diagnostic feature differentiating T. taoensis from T. lamberti, in which, in the holotype and only known specimen preserving the dentary, it arises opposite the anterior part of m2; there appears to be more intraspecific variation in this feature than previously known. The process extends posterodorsally from the anterodorsal margin of the masseteric fossa, and produces a broad, shallow, U-shaped temporal groove (sulcus temporalis of Gambaryan and Kielan-Jaworowska 1995) between it and the buccal alveoloar margin of m2. The dorsal apex of the coronoid process is peaked, and the anterior and posterior edges descend more or less symmetrically from that peak, although the anterior edge is longer and less vertical. Although the posterior edge of the coronoid process is not preserved in AMNH 27734, it has been reconstructed in plaster to descend and then merge in a concave, rounded outline with the mandibular notch that seems natural (Fig. 3i–l). This shape was used in the reconstruction of the dentary in Fig. 10f, h.\n\nComparisons with the craniomandibular morphology of other multituberculate taxa are warranted because of the new anatomical information provided for our subject taxon, Taeniolabis taoensis, but also because many new cimolodontan multituberculate taxa have been described, many of them represented by skull material, since the last major descriptions of T. taoensis material (Broom 1914; Granger and Simpson 1929). This includes specimens of other taeniolabidids, consisting of a dentary of Taeniolabis lamberti (see Simmons 1987) and a few cranial fragments of Kimbetopsalis simmonsae (see Williamson et al. 2016). But more detailed comparisons are possible with cranial specimens of the family most closely related to taeniolabidids, lambdopsalids, in part because of new material of Sphenopsalis (Mao et al. 2016) but, most significantly, nearly complete skull material of the type genus and best-known representative, Lambdopsalis (Miao 1988). Of particular importance also is the recent discovery of a nearly complete skull (and partial postcranial skeleton) of Yubaatar, regarded as the immediate outgroup of Taeniolabidoidea (Xu et al. 2015). In addition, a plethora of skull material of many new genera and species of cimolodontan multituberculates has been discovered in the Late Cretaceous of Asia and Europe, primarily in the form of djadochtatherioids and kogaionids, respectively. The former has been described in considerable detail (e.g., Kielan-Jaworowska 1970a, 1970b, 1971, 1974; Kielan-Jaworowska and Dashzeveg 1978; Kielan-Jaworowska et al. 1986, 2005; Hurum 1994, 1998a, b; Gambaryan and Kielan-Jaworowska 1995; Hurum et al. 1996; Rougier et al. 1996b, 1997, 2016; Kielan-Jaworowska and Hurum 1997, 2001; Wible and Rougier 2000; Ladevèze et al. 2010; Wible et al. 2019) but only preliminary details of the latter have been published to date (Rădulescu and Samson 1996, 1997; Smith and Codrea 2015; Csiki-Sava et al. 2018).\n\nCranial Size and Body Mass Estimates\n\nThe cranium of Taeniolabis taoensis is the largest known among multituberculates. There are no other multituberculates that are known, even from fragmentary remains, that might have approached the size of T. taoensis, which we estimate from cranial size relative to a large sample of extant therian mammals to have had a body mass of approximately 35–40 kg (see “Description”). For the comparisons below, except for the closely related taeniolabidid Kimbetopsalis simmonsae, which is not known from the lower dentition but reported to be ~21% smaller than T. taoensis (based on length of M1; Williamson et al. 2016), we primarily use size of m1 because it is the only element in common to compare with most other large multituberculates.\n\nThe length and width of T. taoensis m1s are 18.7–21.4 mm and 9.4–11.4 mm (n = 35), respectively, and the length and width of its M1s are 21.9–24.4 mm and 10.8–12.1 mm (n = 22), respectively (Simmons 1987; table 2), thus establishing it as the largest known multituberculate, Cenozoic or Mesozoic, from anywhere. The only m1 assigned to the congeneric T. lamberti is 16.0 mm long and 8.0 mm wide (Simmons 1987: table 3). Bubodens magnus, known from a single m1, is the largest known Mesozoic multituberculate from North America (Wilson 1987), but the length (12.8 mm) and width (6.0 mm) of the tooth are less than two-thirds the average dimensions of the m1s of T. taoensis. B. magnus is considerably larger than the largest known Mesozoic multituberculate from Eurasia, Yubaatar zhongyuanensis (m1 length = 9.2 mm; width = 3.6 mm) (Xu et al. 2015), which is less than half the size of T. taoensis. Boffius splendidus is the largest known Cenozoic multituberculate from Europe (M1 length = 15.2–15.3 mm; width = 8.7–9.0 mm; m1 width = 9.6–10.0 mm) (Vianey-Liaud 1979; De Bast and Smith 2017: table 1 [m1 measurements for IRSNB M2195 not used because they pertain to m1 of the palaeoryctid Belgoryctes thaleri; T. Smith, pers. comm. – see De Bast and Smith 2017: table 4]) and Sphenopsalis nobilis is the largest known Cenozoic multituberculate from Asia (m1 length = 13.6 mm; width = 7.3 mm) (Mao et al. 2016); both are, on average, considerably smaller than T. taoensis. All of the multituberculates, purported or substantiated, from Gondwanan landmasses are much smaller than any of the above forms (see review in Krause et al. 2017).\n\nCranial Shape\n\nThe most apt descriptor of the cranium of T. taoensis is “robust,” evoking comparisons with those of extant Australian wombats (Vombatus ursinus) or North American beavers (Castor canadensis). It is almost as wide as long (Table 5) and is, in general, of very heavy construction, with massive, squared zygomatic arches, a short, blunt snout, and prominent sagittal and nuchal crests indicating bulky masticatory and cervical musculature (Fig. 10). By contrast, the crania of other multituberculates are, in general, relatively gracile (see comparison figures including some of the most recently described cimolodontan taxa in Csiki-Sava et al. 2018: suppl. fig. 8; Wible et al. 2019: figs. 21–23). The cranial shape of Lambdopsalis most resembles that of Taeniolabis, the primary differences being the relative narrowness (in dorsal or ventral view) and shallowness (in lateral view) of the snout and the presence of inflated vestibular apparatuses on either side of the occipital condyles that superficially resemble tympanic bullae; these apparatuses are not present in T. taoensis.\n\nSnout Region\n\nSnout Shape\n\nThe snout of T. taoensis, relative to those of other multituberculates, is short and broad, although the anterior extension of the premaxilla revealed by DMNH EPV.136300 (Fig. 6) changes these proportions somewhat relative to earlier reconstructions (e.g., contrast dorsal views by Broom 1914: fig. 6; Granger and Simpson 1929: fig. 5A with that of the revised reconstruction in Fig. 10a). The strongest contrast in snout shape is with the long, narrow, tapered snouts of the European Late Cretaceous kogaionids (see Csiki-Sava et al. 2018: suppl. fig. 8D–F for dorsal reconstructions of Kogaionon, Barbatodon, and Litovoi). Taeniolabis and its close relative Lambdopsalis (Miao 1988: fig. 12) are noteworthy in that the sides of the snout, in dorsal view, are relatively parallel and are distinctively set off from the rest of the cranium by strong indentations at the roots of the zygomatic arches. The latter feature is also seen in at least some of the kogaionids, most notably in Kogaionon (Csiki-Sava et al. 2018: suppl. fig. 8D). A strong indentation is also apparent on an incomplete maxilla (UALVP 28212) of the basal taeniolabidoid Valenopsalis illustrated by Fox (2005: pl. 6, fig. 11). By contrast, the snouts of the ptilodontoids Ptilodus (Simpson 1937b: fig. 5), Ectypodus (Sloan 1979; fig. 1; Gingerich et al. 1983; fig. 2A), and Filikomys (Weaver et al. 2021: fig. 1, Extended Data fig. 4) and a variety of djadochtatherioids (see Wible et al. 2019: fig. 23) have a much smoother transition in this region whereas those of the microcosmodontid Microcosmodon (Fox 2005: pl. 1, figs. 1, 2), the eucosmodontid Stygimys (Sloan and Van Valen 1965: fig. 4), and the cimolomyid Meniscoessus (Archibald 1982: fig. 27a) seem to be intermediate in this regard.\n\nBony Composition of Snout\n\nThe snout of T. taoensis receives contributions from the nasals, premaxillae, and maxillae only. Despite the report of a septomaxilla in a specimen (V.J. 451–155) of the paulchoffatiid Pseudobolodon by Hahn and Hahn (1994), this could not be confirmed by Wible and Rougier (2000) or Rougier et al. (2016); as such, this element appears to be absent in all multituberculates, and we confirm its absence in T. taoensis as well.\n\nThere is also no evidence for facial exposure of the lacrimal in Taeniolabis; indeed, the bone appears to be entirely absent (Fig. 12), as has also been reported for the lambdopsalid Lambdopsalis (Miao 1988). The lack of facial exposure on the snout in taeniolabidoids stands in contrast to the condition in djadochtatherioids, which have a prominent, generally subrectangular facial exposure of the lacrimal, consistently articulating with the maxilla anteroventrally, the nasal anteromedially, and the frontal posterolaterally (Wible et al. 2019: fig. 23D–K). Extensive facial exposure of the lacrimal is also apparently present in the eobaatarid Sinobaatar (Hu and Wang 2002; Kusuhashi et al. 2009) and in the cimolomyid Meniscoessus (Weil and Tomida 2001). The lacrimal in the stem taeniolabidoid Yubaatar is reported to have “a narrow exposure on the skull roof” (Xu et al. 2015: 6) and, although not reconstructed as present in the kogaionid Barbatodon by Smith and Codrea (2015: fig. 2N, O), Csiki-Sava et al. (2018: suppl. appendix p. 49) scored the facial process of the lacrimal as “very small and arcuate” in both Barbatodon and Litovoi (although it was not depicted in their cranial reconstructions of the two genera [suppl. fig. 8E, F]). A facial process of the lacrimal was also not reconstructed for Kogaionon by either Kielan-Jaworowska et al. (2004: fig. 8.42A1) or Csiki-Sava et al. (2018: suppl. fig. 8D). As such, the condition in kogaionids is unclear. Simpson (1937b: 740) stated that “there is no suggestion of facial exposure of a lacrimal” in the ptilodontid Ptilodus and depicted it as absent (figs. 4, 5) and yet it was scored as “small and arcuate” by Kielan-Jaworowska and Hurum (2001) and subsequent workers; this appears to be in error. Presence of the lacrimal on the face was indicated as “uncertain” in the microcosmodontid Microcosmodon (Fox 2005: 15), and it is not depicted in the drawings of the neoplagiaulacid Ectypodus by Sloan (1979: fig. 1) and Gingerich et al. (1983: fig. 2A). Concerning relatively early-branching forms, Kielan-Jaworowska et al. (2004: 266) stated that, although the lacrimal was reconstructed as small in paulchoffatiids by Hahn (1969, 1978b), it is “very poorly preserved, and one cannot depend on the reliability of this reconstruction.” This may be underscored by the fact that Simmons (1993: char. 55) scored the facial process of the lacrimal in Paulchoffatia (now Meketichoffatia; Hahn 1993) as “large.” Mao et al. (2016: char. 93; and derivative character matrices) scored a facial process of the lacrimal as “large, roughly rectangular” in the paulchoffatiid Rugosodon but its condition appears to be unknown (Yuan et al. 2013). In conclusion, given the complete absence of the facial process of the jugal in Lambdopsalis, Taeniolabis, and Ptilodus (and possibly other forms), it appears that the character states frequently used to describe facial exposure of the lacrimal should be separated into two characters, with the first documenting presence versus absence and the second documenting size and shape (“small and arcuate” versus “large and roughly rectangular”).\n\nThe nasal bones of Taeniolabis are very large, both broad and long, and are not confined to the roof of the snout; instead, they extend well posterior to the anterior margins of the orbit. In all other cimolodontan multituberculates except Lambdopsalis (Miao 1988: fig. 12), Yubaatar (Xu et al. 2015: fig. 3b), and perhaps Ectypodus (Sloan 1979: fig. 1), the posterior margin of the nasals lies level with or anterior to the anterior margin of the orbitotemporal fenestra.\n\nThe facial (posterodorsal) process of the premaxilla in Taeniolabis does not insert between the nasal and the maxilla as sharply as it does in most djadochtatherioids (Sloanbaatar being a possible exception; see Wible et al. 2019: fig. 21) and at least some kogaionids (Barbatodon and Litovoi; Csiki-Sava et al. 2018: suppl. fig. 8E, F). Relative to other multituberculates, the premaxilla in Taeniolabis houses a massive central incisor (I2), which has been related to an enhanced gnawing function and concomitant reduction of shearing lower premolars (e.g., Simpson 1937a; Bohlin 1945; Gambaryan and Kielan-Jaworowska 1995; Weil and Krause 2008; Weaver and Wilson 2020).\n\nThe facial process of the maxilla in Taeniolabis is unremarkable other than the fact that it contributes, in the absence of a facial process of the lacrimal, to the entire anterior orbital rim. It does not exhibit the lateral bulging described for djadochtatherioids such as Catopsbaatar, Djadochtatherium, Kryptobaatar, Mangasbaatar, and Tombaatar, a condition that Rougier et al. (2016) and Wible et al. (2019) attributed to possession of an enlarged maxillary sinus.\n\nTip of Snout and External Nasal Aperture\n\nThe external nasal aperture of T. taoensis, although not illustrated previously in anterior view, is profoundly different than previously known, primarily because of the presence, as revealed by DMNH EPV.136300 (Fig. 6a–e), of a prominent internarial process on the premaxilla and more anteriorly extended nasals (Fig. 10a–d). Although the dorsal ends of the left and right internarial processes are not preserved in DMNH EPV.136300, we tentatively infer from their shape that they ended in blunt tips (much as in the gondwanatherian Vintana see Krause 2014a: fig. 1d; 2014b: fig. 5B, C, the marsupialiform Didelphodon see Wilson et al. 2016: fig. 1a, b, d, f, g, h), or the “Gurlin Tsav deltatheroidan” Szalay and Trofimov 1996: fig. 22; G. Rougier, pers. comm.) and did not extend posterodorsally to insert between the anterior ends of the left and right nasals, for which we do not see direct evidence in the form of sutures near the midline.\n\nAn internarial bar, formed by a complete internarial process (variously also called the internasal, prenasal, dorsal, or ascending process) dividing the external nasal aperture into left and right halves is found in tetrapods ancestrally and, despite being rarely preserved in fossils, is known to have been retained in a variety of non-mammaliamorph cynodonts (e.g., Beishanodon, Dadadon, Galesaurus, Menadon, Riograndia, tritylodontids) as well as in some early-branching mammaliamorphs such as Sinoconodon, Morganucodon, Hadrocodium, Haldanodon, Necrolestes, and probably Docodon (Kemp 1982; Hopson and Barghusen 1986; Rowe 1986, 1988; Sues 1986; Lillegraven and Krusat 1991; Flynn et al. 2000; Wible and Rougier 2000, 2017; Bonaparte et al. 2001; Luo et al. 2001; Kammerer et al. 2008; Gao et al. 2010; Rougier et al. 2015; Pusch et al. 2019). Rowe (1988: 251) declared the internarial process to be “absent in adult Monotremata, Multituberculata, and Theria, rendering the external nares confluent in postnatal ontogeny.”\n\nMiao (1988), however, inferred the presence in Lambdopsalis of an internarial process on each premaxilla that extended posterodorsally to insert between the anterior ends of the left and right nasals, thus forming an internarial bar and dividing the external nares. Although not completely preserved on any specimen, Miao’s evidence included, in addition to internarial processes projecting dorsally at the anterior ends of the "
