        "meta_description": "Background Two recent studies published in the same issue of Nature reached conflicting conclusions regarding the phylogeny of early mammals: One places the clade containing haramiyidans and multituberculates within the Mammalia and the other separates haramiyidans from multituberculates and places the former outside of the Mammalia. These two contrasting results require that the minimally oldest divergence time of the Mammalia was within the Late Triassic or the Middle Jurassic, respectively. Morphological descriptions of the species named in the two papers were brief, and no comparisons between the newly named species were possible.  Principal Findings Here we present a detailed description of the dentary bone, teeth, occlusal and wear patterns of the haramiyidan Arboroharamiya and compare it with other haramiyidans and Megaconus. Using this new information, we suggest that tooth identifications and orientations of several previously described haramiyidan species are incorrect, and that previous interpretations of haramiyidan occlusal pattern are problematic. We propose that the published upper tooth orientation of Megaconus was problematic and question the number of upper molars, the length of dentition and mandible, and presence of the mandibular middle ear in Megaconus.  Conclusions The additional morphological descriptions and comparisons presented here further support the view that Arboroharamiya, as a derived haramiyidan, shows similarity to multituberculates in tooth and mandible morphologies. Our comparison also suggests that Megaconus lacks many diagnostic features for the family Eleutherodontidae and that its close affinity with multituberculates cannot be ruled out. The detailed morphological data demonstrate that haramiyidans are more similar to multituberculates than to any other mammaliaforms.",

        "text": "Mandible\n\nBoth dentaries are preserved. The buccal side of the right dentary and the lingual side of the left dentary are exposed (Fig. 2A–B). Only the incisor and p4 are preserved in situ in the right dentary, whereas the incisor, p4 and m1 are preserved in the left dentary. The alveolus for the left m2 is posterior to m1 and filled with matrix. The mandible is proportionally short and deep. The left dentary measures 31 mm (30 mm for the right one) from the anterior edge of the incisor alveolus to the posterior border of the mandibular condyle and 37.65 mm from the tip of the incisor to the posterior border of the condyle. The dentary depth on the medial side of the left mandible is 9.93 mm, measured from the alveolus edge of m1 to the bottom of the dentary; the depth on the lateral side of the right mandible is 11.65 mm, measured at the same position. The diastema between the incisor and p4 is distinct and about two-thirds of the length of p4. The diastema is short for a dentition that lacks a canine and has only one premolar.\n\nA, Buccal view of the right mandible with p4 and the incisor (i).

Nature 500: 199–202 (DOI: 10.1038/nature12353). Reproduced by permission of Nature Publishing Group. Abbreviations: ap, angular process; am2, alveolus for m2; amf, anterior extremity of the masseteric fossa; cp, coronoid process; mc, mandibular condyle; mf, mandibular foramen.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0113847.g002\n\nThe body of the dentary is dorsoventrally deep relative to the length, with its ventral edge being slightly concave below m2. The condyle is similar to that of multituberculates; it extends dorsoventrally instead of mediolaterally. The condyle has a semi-circular outline in lateral view and is situated lower than the tooth row. The coronoid process is small and triangular in lateral view, pointing posterodorsally. The dorsal border of the process thickens to form a rounded coronoid ridge that gradually narrows toward the tip of the process. The coronoid ridge and the blunt ridge along the ventral border of the dentary confine a broad but shallow masseteric fossa that ends anteriorly at the level of p4. The right dentary is broken at its anterior part on the lateral side, which may slightly alter the position of the incisor, the premolar and the coronoid process, but it is clear from the preserved part that the anteroventral border of the dentary is smoothly curved, as in multituberculates. There is no foramen on the preserved lateral surface of the mandible.\n\nThe left dentary shows that the symphysis is small, which indicates an unfused and movable symphysis for such a robust mandible. Posterior to the symphysis and anterior to the mandibular foramen, the medial surface of the dentary is smooth. Breakage on the medial side of the dentary reveals that the incisor extends posteriorly to the level of m2. The mandibular foramen is large and opens posteriorly into the pterygoid fossa. The pterygoid fossa is gently concave and extends from the mandibular foramen to the medial side of the condyle; the fossa is deeper anteriorly than posteriorly. Posteroventral to the m2 alveolus there seems to be a rudimentary coronoid bone that overlaps on the dentary and has an irregular suture.\n\nVentral to the pterygoid fossa is a blunt ridge with a smooth surface that terminates posteriorly as the angular process. Unlike multituberculates in which the ventral margin of the dentary is inflected and forms the pterygoideus shelf [4], the angular process of Arboroharamiya bends medially. It is clear that there is no groove in this area for the Meckel’s cartilage or any postdentary elements. Fig. 2C shows a magnified image of the region, since the original images and report for lack of the groove [26] were considered insufficient to determine the morphology [29]. Lack of the groove indicates detachment of the postdentary bones and thus acquisition of the middle ear ossicles.\n\nLower Premolar\n\nThe only premolar of Arboroharamiya is considered as p4. Its identification as a premolar is based on its morphology, which resembles those in known haramiyidans and some early multituberculates [13], [14], [20]. The lingual side of the left p4 crown is exposed and its tip is broken. The buccal side of the right p4 is exposed but partly broken at its base.\n\nIt is difficult to assign the p4 cusps using existing terminology because of the variety of the premolar morphologies in haramiyidans. Differing from Allostaffia [12], [30], [31] and Sineleutherus [14], [15], [32] where two rows of cusps or a series of distinctive cusps are present, the p4 crown of Arboroharamiya is predominated by a mesial main cusp and a distal heel bearing several minor cusps. In the description we identify the mesial cusp as the main cusp and refer to the minor cusps with numbers. It is likely that the main cusp is a1. What are numbered as 1–3 are row a cusps, but cusp 4 should belong to row b (Fig. 3).\n\nA, Lingual view of p4. B, Buccal view of p4. Abbreviations: 1–4, cusps 1–4 on the heel of p4, ranging from the lingual to the buccal side of the tooth; brd, buccal ridge on the main cusp of p4; lrd, lingual ridge on the main cusp of p4. Note the lack of serrations on both sides of the tooth crown.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0113847.g003\n\nThe p4 has two strong roots, with the anterior one extending anteriorly and the posterior one vertically. It is significantly larger (longer) than m1, with a p4/m1 length ratio of 1.44. The tooth enamel extends to a low position on the anterior surface of the anterior root (Fig. 3). The enamel is thick at the tip and edges of the tooth crown and gradually thins toward the root. Because the two p4s are in the mandibles that are embedded in the slab, the width of the tooth cannot be measured. However, it is clear that the tooth crown is mesiodistally elongate and transversely narrow.\n\nIn lateral view, the hypertrophied main cusp has a triangular profile and accounts for more than two-thirds of the p4 length. The apex of the main cusp extends posterodorsally so that its anterior side is much longer than the posterior one. The anterior surface of the main cusp is smoothly convex, bearing no cingulid, cuspules or ridges. This differs from the p4 of Jurassic multituberculates, such as Kermackodon, in which the p4 bears at least three serrations [13]. The posterior edges of the main cusp are ridge-like, with the lingual one being more anterior than the buccal one. The posterior surface of the main cusp is flat or slightly concave. The posterobuccal edge of the main cusp continues distally as a crest that defines the buccal border of the heel and terminates posteriorly at cusp 4 (Fig. 3). The posterolingual edge of the main cusp merges with the weak lingual crest of the heel, which is lower than the buccal crest of the heel. The distolingual margin of the heel is decorated with three small cusps, denoted as cusps 1–3 (Fig. 3). These cusps are subequal in size and much smaller than cusp 4. The heel has a shallow concave basin.\n\nAlthough the p4 of Arboroharamiya is mesiodistally elongated, the tooth morphology indicates that the main cusp was used for crushing food, not for cutting or shearing. This matches well with the basin-shaped upper premolars, as will be described below. Among the haramiyidans and early multituberculates for which the lower premolar morphology is known [10], [12], [14], [15], [20], [25], [33], p4 of Arboroharamiya is most similar in general shape to that of Kermackodon ([13]: Fig. 6B), one of the two earliest known multituberculate genera. However, because the p4 of Kermackodon is preserved as an isolated tooth, its orientation is less certain than that of Arboroharamiya. Given its current orientation [13], the lingual morphology of p4 of Arboroharamiya is more comparable to what has been identified as the buccal side of p4 in Kermackodon ([13]: Fig. 6B3). This suggests that the differences in the general tooth plan of the p4 in Kermackodon and Arboroharamiya are either due to different origins or to the possibility that the orientation of p4 in Kermackodon may have been reversed, with the left tooth being identified as the right one.\n\nAmong non-multituberculate allotherians, lower premolars preserved in situ were previously known only in Haramiyavia [25] and now in Arboroharamiya and Megaconus. Haramiyavia is morphologically primitive in possessing four premolars, designated as p1-4 [25]; Megaconus has two, designated as p1-2 [28]. Arboroharamiya is apparently more derived in having only one enlarged premolar, designated as p4. In Haramiyavia, the ultimate premolar (p4) is double rooted, larger than the penultimate premolar (p3) and has three tooth cusps that decrease in height distally. A similar morphology is assumed in other haramiyidans [14], [15], [20]. In Megaconus, the ultimate premolar (denoted as p2) is single-rooted and much smaller than the double-rooted p1, which is unique among mammaliaforms (see discussion below).\n\nThe ultimate premolar is important in the systematics of allotherians. Butler ([19]: 331–332) wrote: “The blade-like (sectorial) p4 is one of the most obvious multituberculate apomorphies, but it may be foreshadowed by ‘Thomasia II’ and ml of Haramiyavia, in which the buccal row is reduced and confined to the distal part of the tooth. If Thomasia II is homologous with m1 of Haramiyavia, as suggested in this paper, the three molars of that genus could represent p4 to m2 of multituberculates. (It should be noted that the nomenclature of Haramiyavia is morphological, without implications of replacement).” In those that have only isolated teeth preserved, identification for some of the premolars remains uncertain. For instance, the Thomasia II group teeth were compared with p4 of multituberculates by Sigogneau-Russell [10] and most of them are still considered as the premolars [20]. Butler [19], however, compared Thomasia II with ml of Haramiyavia. In Eleutherodontidae, to which Megaconus is referred to [28], whether those identified as posterior or ultimate premolars (premolariforms) can be compared with the ultimate premolar of Megaconus is debatable. In Zhou et al. ([28]: Fig. S5) the premolars of Sineleutherus [14], [15] were designated as “left p1”, equivalent to that of Megaconus. In our view, however, the tooth listed as “left p1” is most likely the ultimate premolar and is a right tooth.\n\nOcclusal Relationships and Wear Patterns\n\nThe right m1 and M1 from the same specimen of Arboroharamiya are preserved in good condition and are large and strong enough to allow manipulation to illustrate cusp relationships in occlusion (Fig. 11). When fitting the two teeth together, there is only one matching occlusal position, as shown in Figure 11A–D. This position most probably represents the beginning stage of the palinal cycle during chewing. At this stage, the hypertrophied a1 of m1 occluded with the mesial part of the M1 central basin (Fig. 11C), whereas A1 of M1 was positioned in the distal end of the central basin of m1 (Fig. 11A). This occlusal relationship was termed “double engaged” [26]. The relationship is also illustrated in Figure 11G. In addition, the distal view of row a cusp of m1 is seen at the notch between A1 and B1 of M1 (Fig. 11A). Row b of m1 is located buccal to A2-4, and A5 of M1 is mesial to the gap between a1 and b1 of m1. When the lower and upper molars occlude in such a relationship, it is impossible for the lower jaw to move either proally or transversely. From this position the lower jaw can only move palinally.\n\nA–D, Distal, lingual, mesial and buccal views of the right M1 and m1 in occlusion.

Images are not on the same scale.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0113847.g011\n\nFigs. 11A–D and G represent only one position of the chewing motion. It can be inferred from the wear markings that before reaching the illustrated position, a1 must have been in contact mesially with the distal sides of A7 and B7 to create wear on those cusps. Similarly, A1 must have been distally in contact with a6-7 to create wear on those cusps. In such an occlusal relationship as illustrated in figures 11A–D and G, the orthal and palinal motions of the lower molar will create wear facets at certain areas of both upper and lower teeth. For m1, wear facets are present on the lingual and buccal sides of a1, on tips of all cusps, on the lingual side of row a (lingual) cusps, and on the ridges in the central basin. The buccal sides of the row b cusps are not worn. For M1, wear facets are present on the basin sides of all cusps as well as on the buccal sides of A1-4. There is no wear on the lingual side of any row B cusps. The wear facets illustrated here and in Figure 4F indicate that it is the lingual cusps, most importantly a1, that occluded with the basin of the upper molar and then moved palinally during mastication. The lingual side of row a cusps must have been in contact with the buccal side of row B cusps of the upper molar during chewing to create the wear facets on the lingual side of row a cusps. The tooth morphology and wear patterns also show that it is impossible for the buccal row (row b) of m1 to have occluded with the valley between A and B rows of M1 and for the lingual row of M1 to have occluded with the valley of m1, which is a common view held for occlusion of haramiyidans [11], [13], [17]–[20].\n\nThe flat wear facet on the tip of cusp 2 (on cusps 3 and 4 as well) of the upper incisor does not show any directional striations, suggesting that the tooth has been used to pick up food in life (Fig. 12). The striations on the wear facet at the distolingual side of the tooth are nearly parallel to the mesiodistal axis of the tooth crown, which indicate shearing motion of the incisor. The directions of the striations on the lingual and buccal sides of a1 of m1-2 (Fig. 12H, I) indicate that a1 occluded with the valley of the upper molar and moved palinally during chewing. The wear on the small cusps in the basin of P4 (Fig. 12J) must have been created by contact with the main cusp of p4 during the puncturing or crushing cycle of the mastication. Moreover, the direction of the striations on the lingual and buccal sides of A1 of M1 (Fig. 12E, K) indicates that A1 occluded with the valley of the lower molar and the latter moved palinally during chewing.\n\nA, Crown view of the upper left incisor.

Images are not on the same scale.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0113847.g012\n\nThe occlusal relationship and tooth wear pattern of Arboroharamiya are unique among mammals, differing from that of multituberculates and from what has been interpreted for haramiyidans [11], [13], [19], [20]. However, in multituberculates, even in the early forms, such as the Paulchoffatiinae [35], [36], the occlusal relationship of M2/m2 are similar to that of Arboroharamiya in that the lingual cusps of m2 occluded with the central valley of M2 and the buccal cusps of M2 occluded with the valley of m2.\n\nTooth Orientation and Occlusion in Haramiyidans\n\nIn addition to the tooth morphologies and identification of the haramiyidan premolar and molar, there exists a major issue regarding the tooth orientation. Prior to the discovery of Arboroharamiya and Megaconus, Haramiyavia was the only taxon with teeth preserved in situ. In Haramiyavia a1 (the mesiolingual cusp) is the largest cusp on the lower molars, whereas the distobuccal cusps (A1) of upper molars are the largest ([25]: figs. 2, 4). Thomasia was considered to have a dental condition similar to Haramiyavia [19]. This condition is again present in Arboroharamiya [26]. However, in Eleutherodontidae, the hypothesized orientation of the isolated teeth is different.\n\nThe tooth orientation of Eleutherodon was first proposed by Kermack et al. [34], based on the upper tooth root condition and wear facets. In determining the upper tooth orientation, Kermack et al. ([34]: 585) wrote: “Among the teeth, EF FM/56 is unique in having long, well preserved roots with a strong lateral curve (Figs 1 and 14). In an upper molar the roots must follow the curve of the maxilla, i.e. curve medially. In no way could they curve laterally and remain within the bone. This makes EF FM/K56 a right upper molar and enables the rest of the teeth to be oriented, cusp A being distal and lingual.” These authors (34: Fig. 2) also noted “there is a true wear facet on what was deduced from the above to be the lingual side.” This wear facet is illustrated as 13 ([34]: Fig. 2A) and w1 in Figure 13C–D. In orienting the lower molar, Kermack et al. ([34]: 585) wrote: “In BDUC J. 461, a lower tooth, there is a facet (21a) on one of the lateral surfaces of the tooth: in all except highly specialized tetrapod dentitions, the upper teeth overhang the lower buccally; thus facet 21a would be on the buccal surface of the tooth and the β teeth now have been oriented, the largest cusp (cusp a) being mesial and buccal.” Butler [19] changed “cusp a” to cusp b2, because he thought that this cusp must have occluded in the basin between rows A and B of the upper tooth and was probably homologous with b2 of Thomasia on the buccal row. Similarly, Butler ([19]: 327) considered cusp A in the upper molar “could be homologized with B1 of Haramiyavia and Thomasia.” The tooth orientation of eleutherodontids has since been followed by others [13], [14], [28] (Figs. 13D, F, G), although the terminology, such as cusp BB and Bx, was used slightly differently in Butler and Hooker [13].\n\nThe hypothetic skull outline shows the palatal region where the occlusal views of the upper teeth are illustrated. In scenario A, which is the interpretation of Zhou et al. [28], the longer cusp row in M3 (row B) and the shortest cusp row in M2 are on the lingual side. Relative to the last molar, M1 and M2 shift lingually. In scenario B, which is our interpretation, the longer cusp row in M3 (row A) and the shortest cusp row in M2 are buccal. In relation to M1 and M2, M3 shifts lingually. The tooth images are from Zhou et al. [28]. A Jurassic mammaliaform and the earliest mammalian evolutionary adaptations.

([34]: 586), however, noted that the tooth orientation of Eleutherodon differed from those of other haramiyidans and wrote: “This orientation contradicts that of the teeth of Haramiyavia clemmenseni, and probably that of haramiyidans, where the largest cusp is buccal on the upper molars and lingual on the lowers. However we consider that the morphological, chronological and geographical distances between the two samples may account for this discrepancy, and we estimate the above arguments as firmly established”.\n\nJenkins et al. [25] observed that a1 (mesiolingual) was the largest cusp on the lower molars of Haramiyavia, but still considered that the buccal row of the lower molar of Haramiyavia was used for occlusion. These authors [25] wrote: “From the distribution of wear facets and their relative wear, Hahn [7] correctly deduced (as did Parrington [5]) that the upper and lower teeth were offset to provide interlocking occlusion of rows and basins. Hahn also concluded from the relative wear on the facets that the lower of the two cusp rows on both upper and lower teeth (row B) made occlusal contact with the opposing basin. Although the teeth of Haramiyavia clemmenseni are only slightly worn, this occlusal pattern (Fig. 4) is verified as a feature common to haramiyidans and the earliest known true multituberculates.” The consensus view has therefore been that in haramiyidans row B (lingual) of the upper molar occludes in the valley between lower rows a and b of the lower molar, and in a similar manner row b (buccal) of the lower molar occludes between upper rows A and B [19].\n\nGiven the orientation of eleutherodontids, there are several questions that can be asked: Why was the largest cusp (a1) developed at the mesiolingual end of tooth but not used for occlusion in Haramiyavia and Thomasia? Why did extra cusps (C cusps) develop on the buccal side of row A in upper molars if only row B (lingual and lower) occlude with row b in Haramiyavia? On the other hand, why was the largest cusp developed on the buccal row (denoted as b2) and used for occlusion in eleutherodontids? Why is there a distinct wear facet on the lingual side of cusp A (sensu Kermack et al. [34]: Fig. 2), yet none on the lingual side of cusp B if the lingual row of upper cusps bites into the valley of the lower molar? What could “the morphological, chronological and geographical distances” [34] be, that would explain the difference between eleutherodontids and Haramiyavia plus other haramiyidans?\n\nIt has been difficult to orient isolated teeth of haramiyidans. The criteria used by Kermack et al. [34] and others were greatly restricted by the limited information from isolated specimens available at the time. We still do not know the morphology of the maxilla of eleutherodontids, even if Megaconus [28] is considered to be an eleutherodontid. Thus, it is still unknown how the long root of Eleutherodon, which appears to be a common feature for haramiyidans, was implanted in the skull. The root curvature at its distal end in EF FM/56, in our view, is not so significant; it is in the space of bone that contains a much thicker proximal portion of the root. The wear pattern of the lower molar of Eleutherodon on the buccal side of row b ([34]: Fig. 2B) is identical to that on the lingual side of row a in Arboroharamiya (Figs. 4, 11, 12). The wear pattern of the holotype upper molar of Eleutherodon oxfordensis ([34]: Fig. 2A) and those in Butler and Hooker ([13]; Fig. 13D) are also highly comparable to that of the right upper molar of Arboroharamiya (Figs. 9, 11, 12), except that the lingual and buccal sides were reversed. That upper molar was identified as the right one [13], but in our view it is a left upper molar. Originally, the wear facet (denoted as facet 13) on the lingual side of cusp A was identified ([34]: Fig. 2A). As observed by Kermack et al. [34] (p. 598) “The third wear facet, 13, lying on the lingual side of the upper tooth, begins at cusp A and becomes deeper as it passes mesially and eventually ends before the level of cusp B.” This wear pattern is identical to that of the upper molar of Arboroharamiya if the left tooth was considered as the right, or vice versa. The wear on the buccal side of A in Eleutherodon was not illustrated. This is because Kermack et al. [34] emphasized the lingual wear in order to determine the orientation of the tooth. Nonetheless, it was noted that a wear facet in the larger tooth valley (facet 11) cuts through the distal margin of the tooth [34], which is on the buccal side of cusp A. The buccal wear of cusp A is clearly shown in the SEM photographs ([13]: Fig. 1A, B) and is illustrated as w2 in Figure 13C and D. The wear facets on both sides of the large distal upper cusp (denoted as B1) of Eleutherodon were also illustrated ([19]: Fig. 5B). The wear facets denoted as w1 and w2 (Figs. 13C, D) on the lingual and buccal side of the main distal cusp are unique, and can be created only if this cusp bites into and “moves” along the valley of the lower molar in a fashion illustrated in Figure 11.\n\nIn light of the evidence from Arboroharamiya, it is clear that the tooth of previously known eleutherodontids has been incorrectly oriented. What has been identified as a left molar is actually a right one, and vice versa. In other words, “b2” of the lower molar in known eleutherodontids should be a1, and B cusps in known eleutherodontids should be A cusps, as we indicate in Figure 13 (D, F, G). With the correction, the cusp patterns that a1 is the largest cusp of lower molars and that the largest cusp is distobuccal on upper molars become consistent within haramiyidans. With the new orientation, the occlusal wear and masticatory patterns of Eleutherodon ([34]: Fig. 23) become highly similar, if not identical, to those of Arboroharamiya ([26]), as shown in Fig. 11.\n\nLate Triassic Haramiyavia and Thomasia are more primitive in that they have or were interpreted to have more teeth in their dentitions. For instance, Haramiyavia has a lower dental formula of i4-c1-p4-m3 [25]. In addition, the upper molars of Haramiyavia have extra cusps (cusp C) developed on the buccal side of cusp row A. Although Arboroharamiya and other new haramiyidans [41] are more derived in both tooth and mandibular morphologies than Haramiyavia, we think the new data allow us to entertain alternative interpretations for the occlusal pattern in Haramiyavia and tooth identification and orientation in Thomasia.\n\nFor Haramiyavia, contrary to the interpretation of Jenkins et al. [25], it is highly probable that the lingual cusp row of the lower molar occluded with the valley between cusp row A and B of the upper molar. There are several lines of evidence to support this interpretation. First, this reinterpretation is consistent with the occlusal pattern of Arboroharamiya [26] (this study) and other new haramiyidans in which the teeth are preserved in situ [41]. It is more parsimonious to assume that the occlusal pattern did not change during the evolution of haramiyidans. In other words, Arboroharamiya retained the occlusal pattern of Haramiyavia, although the former became more specialized with a hypertrophied cusp a on lower molars. Secondly, if the lingual (B) cusp row of the upper molars occludes with the buccal row of the lower molar, as interpreted by Jenkins et al. [25], it would be difficult to explain why cusp a1 in the lower molar is the largest and why extra C cusps developed on the buccal side of row A in upper molars of Haramiyavia. A large cusp a1 unused in occlusion, and the addition of cusps on the non-functional buccal side of the upper molar, make little functional sense. Finally, it is generally true that in multituberculates the primary functional cusp row usually bears the largest cusps, particularly so for the upper molars. For M1 teeth with only two upper cusp rows in multituberculates the lingual row usually has the more robust cusps. For M1 teeth with a secondary lingual ridge or cusp row, as in many cimolodontan multituberculates, the medial row (the original lingual row) still retains the strongest cusps. The occlusal condition of the M2 of multituberculates is different. The buccal cusp row of M2 is the primary functional row and it bears the largest cusps regardless of whether there is a secondary ridge or cusp row developed on the buccal side of the original buccal cusp row. Compared with the multituberculate dentition, it is most likely that cusp row A in the upper molar of Haramiyavia is the primary functional row because it bears the strongest cusps. It is highly probable that row A of Haramiyavia occluded with the valley of the lower molar, which also means that row a of the lower molar occluded with the valley between row A and B of the upper molar. In this occlusion, the buccal (b) cusp row of the lower molar would occlude with the valley between row A and C cusps of the upper molar, which explains why C cusps are developed on the buccal side in upper molars of Haramiyavia. Phylogenetically and functionally this interpretation is meaningful.\n\nComparison with teeth of Thomasia is more difficult because the genus was based exclusively on isolated teeth. Identification and orientation of those teeth were affected by the conventional view that the buccal cusp row of the lower molar occluded with the lingual cusp row of the upper molar (e. g. [25]). In light of the new data from Arboroharamiya [26] and other euharamiyidans [41] we consider some teeth previously identified as upper molars of Thomasia, such as M214 and M2401C [11], to be most likely right lower molars. This is because the general morphology of these teeth is comparable to the lower molars of Arboroharamiya in which the mesiolingual cusp (cusp a1 in our interpretation) is inflated as the largest tooth cusp and is positioned near the longitudinal axis of the tooth. The wear facets indicated by arrows on those specimens ([11]: figs. 3–5) would be reinterpreted as on the lingual side of the lingual cusps, similar to those of Arboroharamiya. We consider some other specimens, such as M216, M222, SNP59, SNP350 and SNP660 in Butler & Macintyre [11], to be most likely upper molars because these teeth have the largest cusps (A1 and B1 in our interpretation) more distantly separated at the distal end of the tooth so that the valley of those teeth is open distally to allow palinal movement of the lower tooth, again as in Arboroharamiya. Our reinterpretation of the teeth of Thomasia implies that the two sets of teeth originally assigned to Thomasia and “Haramiya”, respectively, may not be exclusively from opposing dentitions of the same genus [10]; instead, each set of the two may contain both upper and lower teeth of the same genus or even different genera. The teeth currently assigned to Thomasia show a considerable variation; it is perhaps necessary to reexamine and identify those teeth in light of the tooth morphology and orientation of Arboroharamiya and other new evidence. Reexamination may result in reinterpretation of those teeth and thus cast new light on the evolution of the allotherian tooth pattern, which remains one of the most difficult problems existing in the study of mammalian evolution.\n\nTaxonomy of Megaconus\n\nAlthough Megaconus has fragments and impressions of skull and skeletal elements preserved in split slabs, its identification as an eleutherodontid haramiyidan was mainly based on dental morphologies. This is because haramiyidan taxa are principally based on isolated teeth and diagnosed primarily by dental characters. Zhou et al. ([28]: Supplementary Information) wrote: “Among mammaliaforms Megaconus is most similar to Thomasia, Haramiyavia and Theroteinus, but differs from these forms in having three functional cusp rows on upper molars 1 and 2 instead of two rows on upper molars as in Thomasia, and two functional rows plus labial cuspules with occlusion as in Haramiyavia and Therotenius. Most similar to Eleutherodon and Sineleutherus in similarity of hypsodont roots of molars, and multiple roots that are proximally confluent, and in having an enlarged anterior cusp on the labial row, …”.\n\nWe can list more differences between Megaconus and other haramiyidans, but our discussion will focus on Eleutherodontidae, in which Megaconus was placed. After considering the original diagnosis for Eleutherodontidae [19], which we quoted above, we found that previously known eleutherodontids and Megaconus share only one character “in having an enlarged anterior cusp on the labial row” of lower molars. Because the lower tooth with occlusal view preserved (as a CT-image) is the left m3 (Fig. 13H) whose mesial end was broken, the sizes of the mesial cusps are not certain. Judging from the trench-like straight groove on M3 in which the lower cusps would fit into, it can be estimated that the mesial cups of m3 in Megaconus must not be greatly enlarged. In all eleutherodontids previously known, the mesial cusp of the lower molar is enlarged because a broad basin in the upper molar can accept it.\n\nThe tooth orientation of Megaconus can be determined by the tooth position in the dentary. If the mesiobuccal cusp in Megaconus is indeed enlarged, then this enlarged cusp is different from the condition in previously known eleutherodontids. As we demonstrated in the previous study [26] and here (see above), the enlarged cusp on the lower molar of previously known eleutherodontids should be a1 (mesiolingual), not b2. Thus, the enlarged mesiobuccal cusp in the lower molar of Megaconus actually differentiates it from other eleutherodontids.\n\nThe other feature that Zhou et al. [28] used to group Megaconus with eleutherodontids is the “hypsodont roots of molars and multiple roots that are proximally confluent.” The root condition was not previously considered one of the diagnostic features for Eleutherodontidae [19]. Among haramiyidans where the tooth roots are known, a similar root condition exists in Eleutherodon [13], [34], Sineleutherus uyguricus [14] and in Arboroharamiya, as we show in this study. To cite one more example, the m2 of Hahnodon taqueti [42] has a root condition similar to that of Megaconus ([28]: Fig. S4J). Hahnodon taqueti was originally placed in the family Hahnodontidae [42], which also contains Denisodon moroccensis [43], and the family was considered a member of the paulchoffatioid multituberculates [4]. Butler and Hooker [13] removed Hahnodontidae from Multituberculata to Haramiyida because hahnodontids have “basined wear” on their teeth. However, Hahn and Hahn [20] disagreed and retained Hahnodontidae within multituberculates because their tooth structures, such as “two large anterior cusps closely attached to each other”, differentiate them from haramiyidans. Unfortunately, other tooth roots of Hahnodon taqueti are unknown, but its m2 root condition lends support to Butler and Hooker’s [13] view if the proximally fused roots represent a haramiyidan condition. If so, then the root condition is not exclusive to Megaconus and previously known eleutherodontids but is found more widely across derived haramiyidans.\n\nThe last feature that links Megaconus with eleutherodontids is its interlocking mechanism between adjacent molars [28]. In Megaconus the upper teeth, particularly between M1 and M2, have a clear interlocking relationship, but that relationship is not so obvious in eleutherodontids ([28]: Fig. S6D). Because eleutherodontids are known only from isolated teeth, whether they actually have the interlocking feature is subject to future testing. The tooth identified as an upper molar of Eleutherodon oxfordensis ([34]: Fig. 6, BDUC J.185) was regarded as an M2 ([28]: Fig. S6D), but that tooth in our view could be a lower molar because its fusiform outline differs from the rhomboidal shape of the upper molar.\n\nWhile few similarities were present to support the taxonomic position of Megaconus as a eleutherodontid haramiyidan, Zhou et al. [28] listed several differences between them: Megaconus “differs from Eleutherodon and Sineleutherus in having pyramidal cusps of subequal size, and straight valleys, instead of fusiform valleys or basins and the large and anteriorly curved last cusp on the upper molars, and a single recurved and enlarged anterior cusp and coalesced marginal cusps on the lower molars.” It is also noted that Megaconus is different from other eleutherodontids in lacking the dense flutings on the tooth crown ([28]: 163), although enamel flutings are variable in presence within eleutherodontids [14], [21]. Moreover, if our interpretation of the upper premolars in other eleutherodontids [13] is correct (Fig. 13A–B; see below), then eleutherodontids are distinct from Megaconus in having basined upper premolars with enamel flutings. Our conclusion is that the placement of Megaconus in the family Eleutherodontidae needs to be tested by future phylogenetic analyses.\n\nWhile Megaconus is similar to multituberculates in having pyramidal cusps of subequal size and straight valleys between cusp rows, several characters have been cited to distinguish Megaconus from multituberculates [28]. Of those features, there are two critical ones from the molar morphologies: Megaconus was interpreted to have three molars and M1-2 are lingually offset from M3. In contrast, there are only two upper and lower molars in multituberculates and the most important synapomorphy of all multituberculates is that M2 is offset lingually to M1. However, we found that these differences are highly questionable, as discussed below.\n\nMandible and Middle Ear of Haramiyidans\n\nA more detailed image (Fig. 2C) reemphasizes our confidence that the dentary of Arboroharamiya lacks the postdentary trough or the groove for the Meckel’s cartilage [26]. Previously, the only known haramiyidan dentary was that of Haramiyavia [25], which was considered to resemble that of Morganucodon and Kuehneotherium in several aspects: the masseteric fossa does not extend beyond the posterior part of the last molar, the condyle is above the level of the teeth, and most importantly the postdentary-trough is present [19], [20]. The latter is one of the characters differentiating haramiyidans from multituberculates [25]. The dentary of Arboroharamiya is highly specialized and drastically different from that of Haramiyavia, but resembles those of derived multituberculates such as taeniolabids [4] in being short and deep and having only one lower premolar. Most importantly, it does not have the postdentary-trough. Lack of the postdentary trough suggests formation of the definitive mammalian middle ear (DMME [44], [45]). If Haramiyavia is a basal haramiyidan whereas Arboroharamiya represents a derived species, then the similarities of the lower jaw and formation of the DMME between Arboroharamiya and those of multituberculates and other mammals display a mosaic evolutionary pattern. Under this phylogenetic hypothesis the DMME in allotherians must have evolved independently from that of therians and monotremes. This is not a surprise since independent evolution of the DMME has been implied at least in Yinotheria within the crown mammals [46].\n\nWhether Haramiyavia has the postdentary trough is a matter of debate. Averianov et al. ([15]: 105–106) argued that “However, a groove of Haramiyavia that was proposed to contain postdentary bones [10; Fig. 2] is not suitable for this, because it is located anteriorly rather than posteriorly to the mandibular foramen. This groove likely contained Meckel’s cartilage. In Haramiyavia, the bone lacks a fragment posterior to the mandibular foramen; thus, it is impossible to recognize whether or not it had a groove for postdentary bones.” In discussing the transitional mammalian middle ear (TMME) in eutriconodonts, Meng et al. [47] have pointed out that most of the prearticular of Morganucodon, as interpreted by Kermack et al. [48], [49], is probably the ossified Meckel’s cartilage, which is located distoventral to the mandibular foramen ([47]: Fig. 2a). This notation gains support from Zhou et al.’s ([28]: Fig. S3) reconstructions of the lower jaws of Sinoconodon and Morganucodon, in which the postdentary bones are located posterior to the mandibular foramen and the Meckel’s cartilage is located anteroventral to the ultimate molar. Given the interpreted location of Meckel’s cartilage in Sinoconodon and Morganucodon, it is highly possible that the groove on the medial side of the fragmentary dentary of Haramiyavia ([25]: Fig. 2) is for the ossified Meckel’s cartilage (OMC), as suggested by Averianov et al. [15], even though the groove appears deeper than those that have the OMC actually preserved, such as Repenomamus [50], [51], Yanoconodon [46] and Liaoconodon [47]. Because only a short segment of the dentary containing m3 is preserved in Haramiyavia, we cannot rule out the possibility that the groove in Haramiyavia accommodated the OMC, not the postdentary bones.\n\nThe postdentary trough and bones were interpreted to be present in Megaconus. Although we are not convinced after examination of the specimen by two of us (JM, YW), we choose not to reinterpret those uncertain structures but wait for new material to prove the contrary. We do however raise the concern that, if the postdentary bones do exist in Megaconus as interpreted [28], there is a need to explain how the lower jaw function with the mandibular ear attached.\n\nMorganucodon was known to have a “double” jaw joint: the dentary-squamosal (secondary) articulation on the lateral side and the articular-quadrate (primary) articulation on the medial side [48], [49], [52]. A similar double joint probably exists in docodontans [53], [54], and the yinotherian Pseudotribos [55]. Even in eutriconodonts, such as Liaoconodon [47], the primary joint may also have been affected by jaw mastication. In all these forms, however, the secondary craniomandibular joint had a hinge-like movement when the jaw opened up, which can be inferred from tooth morphology and the shapes of the mandibular condyle and glenoid fossa. In contrast, the mandibular condyle of Megaconus is ventrodorsally deep. Zhou et al. ([28], Suppl. Info.) stated that “the craniomandibular joint is formed by the dentary condyle and the squamosal glenoid, in addition to the quadrate (incus) and the articular (malleus) joint.” As inferred from tooth morphology and wear facets, Zhou et al. [28] also concluded that Megaconus has dorsoposterior jaw movement, as a derived character shared with multituberculates. This raises a challenging question on the mechanism of jaw movement and hearing in Megaconus."
