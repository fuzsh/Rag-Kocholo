        "text": "Paulchoffatiidae is a family of extinct mammals that lived predominantly during the Upper Jurassic period, though a couple of genera are known from the earliest Cretaceous. Some undescribed fossils from the Middle Jurassic of England may represent earlier versions. Remains have been reported from Portugal, Spain and England. Paulchoffatiids were members of the order Multituberculata. They were relatively early representatives and are within the informal suborder of \"Plagiaulacida\". The family was named by G. Hahn in 1969, and it honors the Portuguese geologist LÃ©on Paul Choffat. Two subfamilies are recognized."
