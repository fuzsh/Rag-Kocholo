        "text": "DISCUSSION\n\nHomology of the Posterior Process\n\nAs briefly reviewed by Meng and Hou (2016), the homology of the stapes still remains controversial despite of its early discovery in the mid-16th century (Mudry, 2013). Among the three middle ear ossicles the stapes is of the second branchial arch origin, whereas the malleus and incus are first arch derivatives (Goodrich, 1930; de Beer, 1937; Crompton and Parker, 1978; Kontges and Lumsden, 1996; Tucker et al., 2004; Chapman, 2011; Kitazawa et al., 2015). It remains open whether the stapes is derived from a unique source of the second branchial (hyoid) arch (Rodríguez-Vázquez, 2005, 2009; Rodríguez-Vázquez et al., 2006) or from dual sources, with the footplate being from the otic capsule and the rest of the stapes as the dorsalmost derivative of the second branchial arch (Cauldwell and Anson, 1942; Anson, 1960; Masuda et al., 1978; Ars, 1989; Mallo, 1997; Nandapalan and Tos, 2000; Whittemore et al., 2013). In addition, whether development of the stapes is related to formation of the fenestra vestibuli remains disputable (Rijli et al., 1993; Mallo, 1997, 2001; Kanzler et al., 2000). From an evolutionary perspective, it is also not crystal clear whether the mammalian stapes is homologous strictly with the “reptilian” and bird otostapes or with the proximal columella of sauropsids and other tetrapods without the extra-stapedial elements (distal columella; Allin, 1975; Cambas, 1983; Presley, 1984; Novacek and Wyss, 1986; Allin and Hopson, 1992). In reporting the stapes of the eutriconodontan Chaoyangodens, Meng and Hou (2016) raises the issue about the homology of the PISM, which in turn is relevant to the development of the stapedius muscle that functions for protecting the inner ear from overstimulation by excessively loud sound and/or for frequency tuning in mammalian hearing (Wever and Bray, 1942; Fleischer, 1978). The basic issue is whether the PISM in mammals is homologous to the dorsal process of the sauropsid extrastapes or to the ossified proximal (stapedial) end of the interhyal.\n\nThe dorsal process is present on the stapes of some non-mammaliaform therapsids (Watson, 1953; Hopson, 1966; Allin, 1975; Parrington, 1979; Allin and Hopson, 1992; Rodrigues et al., 2013; Ruf et al., 2013; Gaetano and Abdala, 2015) and the PISM is present in extant mammals (some have it reduced) (Doran, 1878; Fleischer, 1973; Novacek and Wyss, 1986; Fig. 3). The developmental process of the stapes has been explored in many studies (de Beer, 1937; Presley, 1984; Allin and Hopson, 1992; Rodríguez-Vázquez, 2005, 2009; Rodríguez-Vázquez et al., 2006). The general pattern is that during early embryonic stages, the mesenchymal blastema of the second branchial arch has two processes, the medial and lateral, at its dorsal end. The medial process ossifies in sauropsids as the stapes proper (the otostapes) and in mammals as the entire stapes. The medial process, or stapedial anlage (Rodríguez-Vázquez, 2005), has two distinct parts: the dorsal part that forms the footplate and the ventral part forms the crura and the head of the stapes. The lateral process of the second branchial arch, part of the Reichert's cartilage (Rodríguez-Vázquez, 2005), chondrifies as the dorsal process of the sauropsid extrastapes and as the tympanohyal (laterohyal) that fuses to the crista parotica of the otic capsule in mammals (Hanson et al., 1962; Cambas, 1983; Allin and Hopson, 1992; Rodríguez-Vázquez, 2005, 2009). In other words, the tympanohyal of mammals and the dorsal process of sauropsids are homologous, which is supported by their topographic relationships to the jugular vein and hyomandibular branch of the facial nerve, and the articulation with the crista parotica (Cambas, 1983; Rodríguez-Vázquez, 2005, 2009). During the early stage of development in mammals, the interhyal temporarily connects the embryonic stapes with the dorsal process (or the cranial end of Reichert's cartilage); its proximal part (the stapedial portion) becomes the tendon of the stapedius muscle, and sometimes a sesamoid cartilage (of Paauw) within this tendon, whereas the thinner distal (external) part disappears at the beginning of the fetal period and the stapedius muscle joins the interhyal at a later stage of development (Rodríguez-Vázquez, 2005).\n\nBased on the developmental evidence (de Beer, 1937; Presley, 1984; Allin and Hopson, 1992; Rodríguez-Vázquez, 2005, 2009; Rodríguez-Vázquez et al., 2006), Meng and Hou (2016) posited that the PISM of the mammalian stapes, including the one from the eutriconodontan Chaoyangodens, is most probably homologous with the ossified proximal (stapedial) end of the interhyal on which the tendon of the stapedius muscle attaches, but not homologous to the dorsal process of the sauropsid extrastapes, although the PISM of Chaoyangodens is proportionally larger than those of extant mammals (Doran, 1878; Segall, 1970; Fleischer, 1973; Henson, 1974; Schmelzle et al., 2005).\n\nGaetano and Abdala (2015), however, presented an excellent documentation of the stapes in gomphodont cynodonts. According to the authors, the dorsal process is a triangular-shaped lamina pointing dorsally or dorsomedially from the dorsolateral portion of the posterior crus of the stapes in non-mammaliaform cynodonts (except for some specimens of Thrinaxodon) and compatible to the insertion of a small ligament or muscle such as Paauw's cartilage or the stapedial muscle. The authors interpreted that the stapedial muscle connected the stapes, by attachment to the dorsal process, to the paroccipital process in basal cynodonts. From the developmental evidence, it seems that the dorsal process is unlikely homologous to the PISM, as discussed above; then it remains open whether the stapedial muscle attached to the dorsal process, as interpreted in gomphodont cynodonts by Gaetano and Abdala (2015), is homologous with the stapedius muscle attached to the PISM in mammals, a subject beyond the scope of this study.\n\nThe stapes of Arboroharamiya is considerably smaller than those of non-mammalian cynodonts in absolute size and size relative to the skull length (see below). However, the peculiar posterior process of the stapes is unique and proportionally large as part of the stapes; it compares neither with the PISM in mammals nor with the dorsal process in non-mammalian cynodonts. By far, the most robust PISM in known mammals was from the eutriconodontan Chaoyangodens (Meng and Hou, 2016; Fig. 2i), but it is still proportionally much smaller than the posterior process of Arboroharamiya. Although proportionally large, the absolute size of the posterior process is unquestionably minuscule; thus it cannot contact any cranial structure, such as the paraoccipital process as in some sauropsids and synapsids (Romer, 1956; Allin, 1975). Similarly, the size and shape of the posterior process does not suggest any contact with the tympanic membrane as an extrastapes, a hypothesis on middle ear evolution that has been discussed in many studies (e.g., Westoll, 1943, 1944; Hopson, 1966; Allin, 1975, 1986; Parrington, 1979; Novacek, 1993). Taking the pattern of related structures into account, including the small size of the stapes and incus, lack of the postdentary trough and Meckelian groove, and presence of the dentary-squamosal craniomandibular joint, we interpret that Arboroharamiya already developed the DMME and that the posterior process on the stapes functioned as the site for attachment of the stapedius muscle; thus it is homologous to the PISM in the eutriconodontan Chaoyangodens and other mammals (Fig. 2) and was developed from the proximal (the stapedial) portion of the interhyal.\n\nSize of the Stapes\n\nThe relative size of a stapes is usually obtained by comparing the footplate diameter and/or stapes length to the length of the skull, a quantitative character that has been used in phylogenetic reconstruction of mammals (Wible, 1991). Usually, the stapes is robust and proportionally large in non-mammalian cynodonts (Watson, 1953; Estes, 1961; Bonaparte, 1966; Allin, 1975; Parrington, 1979; Kermack et al., 1981; Novacek and Wyss, 1986; Rowe, 1988; Lillegraven and Krusat, 1991; Wible, 1991; Allin and Hopson, 1992; Crompton and Luo, 1993; Wible and Hopson, 1993; Rodrigues et al., 2013; Ruf et al., 2013; Gaetano and Abdala, 2015) but considerably reduced and proportionally very small in mammals (Doran, 1878; Segall, 1970; Fleischer, 1973; Henson, 1974), such that small middle ear ossicles have been regarded as an apomorphy of the mammalian crown group (Kielan-Jaworowska et al., 2004). The skull length to the footplate diameter ratio is 43 in Morganucodon (Kermack et al., 1981), 35.2 in Haldanodon (Lillegraven and Krusat, 1991) or 43.5 (Ruf et al., 2013), 21.4 in Thrinaxodon, 17 in Galesaurus, 24.8 for Trirachodon (based on measurements from [Parrington, 1949]), and 22.6 in Brasilitherium (Rodrigues et al., 2013). The same ratio is 110 in adult Tachyglossus (Kermack et al., 1981) and 53.5 in the eutriconodontan Chaoyangodens (Meng and Hou, 2016).\n\nSimilarly, the stapes length (measured or estimated) as a percentage of the skull length is usually greater in non-mammalian cynodonts than in mammals. The primitive stapes/skull length percentage ranges from 7.5 to 13% in non-mammaliaform taxa (Wible, 1991; Wible and Hopson, 1993), whereas the derived condition ranges from 3 to 5.5% in extinct mammaliaform taxa, such as Sinoconodon, morganucodontids, multituberculates, and Vincelestes, and 0.05 to 4.2% in extant mammals, although only two states were actually used for phylogenetic analysis: stapes length-greater than 7.5% (0) or less than 5.5% (1) of skull length (Wible, 1991). The same percentage is 8% for Thrinaxodon, 9.4% for Galesaurus, 12.1% for Trirachodon, based on measurements of Parrington (1949), and 9% for Brasilitherium (Rodrigues et al., 2013). In gomphodont cynodonts (Diademodon, Langbergia, Trirachodon, Scalenodon, Luangwa, Massetognathus, Menadon, and Exaeretodon) the percentage ranges from 7 to 13% (Gaetano and Abdala, 2015: table 2), nearly identical to the percentage range for non-mammaliaforms recognized by Wible (1991). The same percentage is 3.3% in the multituberculate Lambdopsalis (Meng, 1992) and 2.97% in the eutriconodontan Chaoyangodens (Meng and Hou, 2016).\n\nThe skull of Arboroharamiya was not preserved, but both lower jaws were nearly intact. Using the lower jaw and skull length ratio from other euharamiyidans in which the cranium and lower jaws are nearly intact, we can estimate the skull length of Arboroharamiya. In the paratype 1 (WGMV-001) of Shenshou lui, the lower jaw measures 24 mm from the tip of the incisor to the distal border of the mandibular condyle (the maximum length) and the skull length is 31 mm (Bi et al., 2014); thus, the lower jaw length is 77.4% of the skull length. In the holotype of X. linglong (IVPP V16707, Bi et al., 2014), the lower jaw and skull length is 24.8 and 32 mm, respectively, yielding a jaw/skull length percentage 77.5%. In other mammals where the mandible and skull lengths from same individuals could be measured or reasonably estimated, this percentage is 80% in the eutherian Acristatherium yanensis (Hu et al., 2010), 78% in the eutriconodontan Liaoconodon (the measured skull length is 50 mm and the dentary length is 35 mm without incisor [Meng et al., 2011] but 39 mm with the incisor), and 62–67% in Kryptobaatar dashzevegi (lower jaw length measured from the incisor base; these numbers would be slightly greater if the length is measured to the tip of the incisor; (Wible and Rougier, 2000: table 2).\n\nThe mandible length of Arboroharamiya is 37.65 (Meng et al., 2014). Using the mandible and skull length percentage (77.4%) of Shenshou lui, the skull length of Arboroharamiya is estimated as 48.64 mm. Thus, the skull length/footplate diameter ratio is estimated as 51.74 and the stapes/skull length percentage is 4% for Arboroharamiya. Both numbers show that the relative size of the stapes of Arboroharamiya is within the range of mammals. In the eutriconodontan Chaoyangodens the skull/footplate length ratio is 53.5 and the stapes/skull length percentage is 2.97% (Meng and Hou, 2016). These indicate that the size of the footplate, therefore the size of the fenestra vestibuli, of Arboroharamiya is similar to eutriconodontans (Meng et al., 2011; Meng and Hou, 2016), but the length of the stapes in Arboroharamiya is proportionally longer than that of Chaoyangodens.\n\nShape of the Stapes\n\nThe stapes of Arboroharamiya with nearly parallel crura and broad distal end is probably best assignable to the “rod-like” category of Novacek and Wyss (1986). The general stapes shape of Arboroharamiya is similar to those of non-mammalian cynodonts, such as Thrinacodon, Exaeretodon, Probainognathus, Pachygenelus, Sinoconodon, Morganucodon, and Haldanodon (Watson, 1953; Estes, 1961; Bonaparte, 1966; Allin, 1975; Parrington, 1979; Kermack et al., 1981; Novacek and Wyss, 1986; Allin and Hopson, 1992; Crompton and Luo, 1993; Rodrigues et al., 2013; Ruf et al., 2013; Gaetano and Abdala, 2015). Differences do exist, including that the stapedial foramen is more extensive, the crura are thinner, and there is a long posterior process in the stapes of Arboroharamiya. In addition, it seems that there is no distinct footplate that is wider than the margin defined by the crura, contrasting to those of Morganucodon and Haldanodon but more or less similar to the stapes of the eutriconodontan Chaoyangodens that also lacks a distinctive stapedial footplate (Meng and Hou, 2016).\n\nCompared with other mammals, the stapes of Arboroharamiya differs considerably from that of monotremes that has a “T” shaped stapes in lateral view with a slim imperforated columelliform shaft (Doran, 1878; Fleischer, 1973; Novacek and Wyss, 1986). Many therians have a perforated stapes, but therian stapes, including that of the Late Cretaceous eutherian (Archibald, 1979), differ from the stapes of Arboroharamiya in having a restricted (narrow) head, a distinct footplate and a small PISM (Doran, 1878; Segall, 1970; Fleischer, 1973; Henson, 1974; Novacek and Wyss, 1986; Schmelzle et al., 2005). A restricted stapedial head is also applicable to multituberculates where the stapes is known: it can be either a stirrup shaped, as in the Late Cretaceous Kryptobaatar (Rougier et al., 1996b), or a columelliform, as in the Tertiary Lambdopsalis (Meng, 1992). As Meng (1992) noted that a restricted stapedial head conforms reduction of the incus and formation of the lenticular process for the stapes; the latter often bends at a right angle to the long process and articulates to the head of the stapes (Meng, 1992; Meng and Hou, 2016).\n\nThe stapes of Arboroharamiya clearly indicates that the incudostapedial articulation is sizable, compared with that of extant mammals; this suggests that the incus probably have not developed a slender long process with a restricted lenticular process. Among mammals, the stapes of Arboroharamiya is comparable to that of the eutriconodontan Chaoyangodens in which the stapes is also rod-like (Meng and Hou, 2016). The stapes of Arboroharamiya again supports the notion that the rod-like stapes with a broad end-on-end contact with the incus is a primitive condition for mammals (Novacek and Wyss, 1986; Meng, 1992; Rougier et al., 1996b). The derived condition is characterized by reduction of the distal end of the stapes to form the stapedial head, which Meng (1992) considered as the most significant modification of the stapes within a triossicular ear and is consistent with the evolutionary trend of reduction in the incus and malleus for more sensitive airborne hearing in mammals.\n\nIt is worth to note that the morphology of the stapes and incus of Arboroharamiya may be related to special adaptation of hearing and/or locomotion. As known from other mammals, the ear ossicles are specialized for detection of different vibrations in adaptation to different life styles, ranging from aquatic, fossorial to arboreal (Doran, 1878; Fleischer, 1973; Nummela et al., 1999; Ketten, 2000; Mason, 2001; Tubelli et al., 2014). Arboroharamiya and other euharamiyidans were probably tree dwellers, possibly gliders; they were specialized in having relatively short metapodials but long phalanges in both manus and pes, differing them from other arboreal mammals (Zheng et al., 2013; Bi et al., 2014). The ear ossicles may represent an adaptation for a special arboreal life that was unfamiliar to us.\n\nStapedial Foramen\n\nThe perforated stapes as the primitive condition for mammals have been widely accepted (Goodrich, 1915, 1930; Kuhn, 1971; Henson, 1974; Fleischer, 1978; Novacek and Wyss, 1986; Lillegraven and Krusat, 1991; Wible, 1991; Meng, 1992; Novacek, 1993; Wible and Hopson, 1993; Gaudin et al., 1996; Rougier et al., 1996b; Sánchez-Villagra et al., 2002). This is partly because a perforated stapes is the common condition present in non-mammaliaform cynodonts and basal mammaliaforms, such as Thrinacodon, Exaeretodon, Probainognathus, Pachygenelus, Brasilitherium, Sinoconodon, Morganucodon, and Haldanodon (Watson, 1953; Estes, 1961; Bonaparte, 1966; Allin, 1975; Parrington, 1979; Kermack et al., 1981; Novacek and Wyss, 1986; Rowe, 1988; Lillegraven and Krusat, 1991; Wible, 1991; Allin and Hopson, 1992; Crompton and Luo, 1993; Wible and Hopson, 1993; Sánchez-Villagra et al., 2002; Rodrigues et al., 2013; Ruf et al., 2013; Gaetano and Abdala, 2015; Fig. 2). The stapes of Arboroharamiya again add additional support to the notion that the perforated stapes is primitive for mammals. The large stapedial foramen suggests presence of a functional stapedial artery in Arboroharamiya, although no basicranial structure was preserved in Arboroharamiya to furnish additional evidence.\n\nIncus\n\nIn ancestral forms of extant mammals, such as monotremes and marsupials (Doran, 1878; Fleischer, 1973), the malleus usually has a long anterior process and does not have an inflated or bulbous body. This is true in the malleus of the eutriconodontan Liaoconodon (Meng et al., 2011). However, in advanced forms, such as human, there is a distinctive head of the malleus. The incus (or its precursor quadrate) in non-mammal cynodonts (Parrington, 1955; Kemp, 1969, 1979; Kermack et al., 1981; Luo, 1994; Luo and Crompton, 1994) is more likely to have a relative bulbous body or head; thus, we interpret the element in question as the incus.\n\nAmong Mesozoic mammals, the incus or element interpreted as the incus is known at least in two eutriconodontans, Yanoconodon (Luo et al., 2007a) and Liaoconodon (Meng et al., 2011), in the Late Cretaceous multituberculate Chulsanbaatar vulgaris (Hurum et al., 1996), and possibly in the Cretaceous eutherian Daulestes (McKenna et al., 2000). Among Mesozoic mammals, only the incus of Liaoconodon has preserved an unequivocal shape and relationship with other middle ear bones; it has a hinge-like articulation with the malleus and does not have an elongate long process with a lenticular process (Meng et al., 2011). This morphology is consistent with the shape of the stapes reported in another eutriconodontan, Chaoyangodens (Hou and Meng, 2014; Meng and Hou, 2016), which has a broad distal end to articulate with the incus. In the multituberculate Chulsanbaatar, the incus is a flat bone (Hurum et al., 1996), generally similar to the inferred incus in the Tertiary multituberculate Lambdopsalis (Miao and Lillegraven, 1986; Meng and Wyss, 1995). In addition, the preserved part of the incus of Chulsanbaatar is roughly A-shaped with the short process (crus breve) being longer and more robust than the more gracile but incomplete long process (crus longum), similar to that of Liaoconodon (Meng et al., 2011). Compared with the multituberculate Chaoyangodens and Lambdopsalis and the eutriconodontan Liaoconodon, the exposed portion of the incus of Arboroharamiya is distinctive in at least two aspects: it has a bulbous body or head and a slim process that is interpreted as the short process of the incus.\n\nIn contrast, the precursor of the incus, the quadrate, has been known in several non-mammalian cynodonts. The quadrate is proportionally large, has a simple dorsal plate and is suspended by multiple bones or in articulation with the petrosal (Parrington, 1955; Kemp, 1969, 1979; Kermack et al., 1981; Luo, 1994; Luo and Crompton, 1994; Kielan-Jaworowska et al., 2004; Luo et al., 2011). The small size and the exposed bulbous body or head show that the incus of Arboroharamiya does not seem to have a strong dorsal plate that inserts into the deep fossa in the petrosal, as in Morganucodon (Kermack et al., 1981; Luo and Crompton, 1994). This is supported by a completely developed and longitudinally orientated glenoid fossa, similar to that of multituberculates, in Shenshou and Xianshou, that implies an exclusive dentary-squamosal craniomandibular joint (Bi et al., 2014). The greatly reduced incus was most probably moored to the cranium via a ligament as in extant mammals, although it differs from the incus of extant mammals in lacking a narrow and long stapedial process. In other words, the incus was freed from the cranium and functioned solely as part of the auditory apparatus, meaning again that euharamiyidans already acquired the DMME as early as in the early Middle Jurassic.\n\nMandibular Characters\n\nIn addition to the middle ear ossicles, some mandibular structures also provide important information for evolution of the mammalian middle ear and, as critical osteological characters, contribute to phylogenetic reconstruction of mammals, which in turn affects interpretation of the middle ear evolution. The general morphology of the mandible is similar among euharamiyidans (Zheng et al., 2013; Bi et al., 2014; Fig. 3 and Figs. S1–S5) and to those of multituberculates (Kielan-Jaworowska and Hurum, 1997; Kielan-Jaworowska et al., 2004). In both groups, the mandible is proportionally short and dorsoventrally deep and has a distinct diastema between the sole incisor and the mesial premolar. In both groups, the postdentary trough and Meckelian groove are absent. In addition, the masseteric fossa is large and extends anteriorly, and the mandibular condyle is vertically orientated. The mandible of euharamiyidans differs from that of multituberculates in having a small angular process that inflects medially. Based on the mandibular characters, presence of the DMME was inferred for euharamiyidans (Zheng et al., 2013; Bi et al., 2014; Meng et al., 2014), which is confirmed by the small ear ossicles reported here.\n\nIn a recent phylogenetic analysis, Luo et al. (2015) used one of the data matrixes of Bi et al. (2014) but modified codings of over 50 characters for euharamiyidans, Arboroharamiya included. The outcome of the phylogenetic analysis with re-coded characters fundamentally altered the phylogenetic position of “haramiyidans” and thus, interpretation of the middle ear evolution within mammaliaforms. The character re-coding for euharamiyidans was not justified, but we found it unusual that the original codings of over 50 characters for euharamiyidans were changed either to “?” or, for most characters, to “0.” These changes ought to reduce the similarities between “haramiyidans” and multituberculates and other mammals but increase similarities of “haramiyidans” to basal members of mammaliaforms. In this study, we examined five mandibular characters re-coded by Luo et al. (2015) because these characters are relevant to interpretations of mammalian middle ear evolution; other recoded characters will be revisited in separate studies.\n\nA comparative discussion and illustrations about the five mandibular characters in euharamiyidans are provided in the supplementary online material (Figs. S1–S5). The way Luo et al. (2015) re-coded those mandibular characters indicates that these authors believe that Arboroharamiya, Shenshou, and Xianshou have the Meckelian groove and the postdentary complex (for Shenshou and Xianshou), lack the anterior extension of the masseteric fossa, and do not have a vertically orientated mandibular condyle. We disagree with those changes made by Luo et al. (2015).\n\nPresence of the Meckelian groove suggests a persistent Meckel's cartilage or OMC in adult individuals (Wang et al., 2001; Meng et al., 2003) and presence of the TMME (Meng et al., 2011). A persistent Meckel's cartilage or OMC have been observed in several Mesozoic mammals, such as eutriconodontans (Repenomamus, Gobiconodon, Yanoconodon, Liaoconodon, and Chaoyangodens) (Wang et al., 2001; Li et al., 2003; Meng et al., 2003, 2011; Luo et al., 2007a; Meng and Hou, 2016) and “symmetrodontans” (Zhangheotherium and Maotherium) (Meng et al., 2003; Ji et al., 2009). A persistent Meckel's cartilage or OMC was also inferred for various taxa in which a distinctive Meckelian groove was present on the medial surface of the dentary (Meng et al., 2003, 2011). The Meckelian groove is absent in euharamiyidans, as illustrated in Fig. 3 (see also Figs. S1–S5). Moreover, the TMME was by far only inferred from mammals without a palinal (posterior) jaw movement, such as eutriconodontans and “symmetrodontans.” In contrast, euharamiyidans probably had a palinal jaw movement during mastication, as shown by their tooth morphology, wear facets and striations on teeth, shape of the mandibular condyle and shape of the longitudinally orientated glenoid fossa that lacks the postglenoid process (Butler and MacIntyre, 1994; Butler, 2000; Butler and Hooker, 2005; Zheng et al., 2013; Bi et al., 2014; Meng et al., 2014; Fig. 3). Absence of the Meckelian groove, and thus lack of the TMME, is consistent with the inferred jaw movement of euharamiyidans. Otherwise, when the lower jaw moved backward, how the middle ear functioned remains a challenging issue, if possible at all.\n\nPresence of the postdentary complex (surangular, articular, prearticular, and angular) implies presence of the MdME and a compound jaw joint, which is typically shown in Morganucodon (Kermack et al., 1973, 1981; Figs. S1b, S3b–S5b). Figure 3 shows clearly that, similar to Arboroharamiya (Figs. S1–S5), the jaw suspension is exclusively between the dentary and the squamosal in Shenshou and Xianshou. The postdentary complex and trough are absolutely absent in euharamiyidans.\n\nThe anterior extension of the masseteric fossa in Arboroharamiya and other euharamiyans is obvious and cannot be the same as in Morganucodon (Fig. S4b). The condition of euharamiyidans is similar to that of multituberculates in which the masseteric fossa is large and anteriorly extended, usually ending below the junction of p4 and m1 on the lateral surface of the dentary (Gambaryan and Kielan-Jaworowska, 1995; Kielan-Jaworowska et al., 2004). In Morganucodon, the masseteric fossa is relatively small and its anterior extremity does not extend anterior to m3. The anterior extension of the masseteric fossa is associated with the enlarged lower incisor, morphology of the mandibular condyle and the jaw movement during mastication. There is no reason to score euharamiyidans as having the same condition of the masseteric fossa as in Morganucodon.\n\nThe mandibular condyle and the condyle process of Arboroharamiya and other euharamiyans are also similar to those of multituberculates (Kielan-Jaworowska and Hurum, 1997; Kielan-Jaworowska et al., 2004) and differ significantly from those of Morganucodon (Fig. S5b) and most Mesozoic mammals. The vertically orientated condyle, along with other mandibular features, is probably related to the palinal move in mastication in euharamiyidans, as in multituberculates (Krause, 1982; Gambaryan and Kielan-Jaworowska, 1995).\n\nEvolution of DMME\n\nSmall middle ear ossicles have been regarded as an apomorphy of the mammalian crown group (Kielan-Jaworowska et al., 2004: table 3.4). The greatly reduced stapes and incus of Arboroharamiya are thus highly mammalian. Coupled with absence of the postdentary trough and Meckelian groove, as well as the shape of the mandibular condyle and glenoid fossa in euharamiyidans (Zheng et al., 2013; Bi et al., 2014; Meng et al., 2014; Fig. 3), it is clear that euharamiyidans have evolved the DMME. However, the significance of the middle ear ossicles of Arboroharamiya to the evolution of the mammalian middle ear depends on the higher-level phylogeny of mammals. Unfortunately, the phylogenetic relationship of “haramiyidans” has long been controversial (Simpson, 1929, 1947; Hahn, 1973; Sigogneau-Russell et al., 1986; McKenna, 1987; Hahn et al., 1989; Butler and MacIntyre, 1994; Jenkins et al., 1997; McKenna and Bell, 1997; Kermack et al., 1998; Butler, 2000; Kielan-Jaworowska et al., 2004; Hahn and Hahn, 2006). There remain at least two fundamental issues: whether “haramiyidans” are closely related to multituberculates to form the clade Allotheria and whether allotherians, regardless the content of the group, are phylogenetically in or outside of Mammalia. Most phylogenetic analyses concurred the notion that allotherians include “haramiyidans” (commonly represented by Haramiyavia) and multituberculates and that allotherians are nested within Mammalia (Luo et al., 2002, 2007a,b, 2011; Luo and Wible, 2005; Rowe et al., 2008; Ji et al., 2009; Meng et al., 2011; Zheng et al., 2013; Bi et al., 2014; Krause et al., 2014), but alternative hypotheses do exist (Averianov et al., 2011; Luo et al., 2015). Although the hypotheses are diverse (see Meng [2014] for a brief review), two are commonly mentioned in literatures, as illustrated in Figure 4.\n\nAssuming the interpretation that Haramiyavia has the postdentary trough (Luo et al., 2015, but see Averianov et al., 2011), then H-I predicts that there is one evolutionary step from the condition of Haramiyavia to give rise to the DMME in the common ancestor of euharamiyidans and multituberculates. In H-II, however, the DMME in euharamiyidans and multituberculates must have evolved independently. Our evidence shows that H-II is weakly supported. This is not only because H-II requires convergent evolution of the DMME in multituberculates and euharamiyidans but also requires parallel evolution of numerous derived similarities in the dentition, occlusion pattern, mandibles, cranium, and postcranium between euharamiyidans and multituberculates as well as between euharamiyidans and other mammals (Bi et al., 2014). More importantly, after we corrected the coding of the five mandibular characters in the data matrix of Luo et al. (2015), the phylogenetic result became nearly identical to that of Bi et al. (2014; supplementary online material). This indicates that the modified coding of the five mandibular characters played a key role in pulling “haramiyidans” out of Mammalia in Luo et al.'s (2015) analysis. Once only the five codings are corrected (there are more than 40 character codings to be examined), the phylogenetic result of Luo et al. (2015) no longer holds. Thus, based on available evidence, we regard H-I as the working hypothesis in interpreting evolution of the mammalian middle ear. Based on H-I, the DMME evolved at least three times independently in Mammalia. These events took place in the lineages leading toward allotherians, monotremes and therians, respectively.\n\nInterpretation of the DMME evolution depends not only on phylogenetic hypotheses but also on interpretation of the middle ear of Hadrocodium (Luo et al., 2001). Hadrocodium was originally considered as having the DMME because its dentary bone was interpreted as lacking the postdentary trough and its brain as so expanded as the mechanism to pull the postdentary bones (middle ear ossicles) off the dentary (Luo et al., 2001). Luo (2011: 363) considered Hadrocodium “the earliest form in which both the postdentary trough and Meckel's groove for holding the middle ear are completely lost” and the inferred separation of the middle ear from the dentary represents an independent acquisition of the DMME either in Hadrocodium or in the common ancestor of Hadrocodium and crown Mammalia. Whether brain-expansion is the mechanism for the detachment of the middle ear ossicles has been controversial (Wang et al., 2001; Meng et al., 2003, 2011), but a new interpretation about the middle ear of Hadrocodium reversed the original interpretation. In the new interpretation, the postdentary trough and bones were considered as present in Hadrocodium (see Bi et al., 2014; supplementary online material). Because both the postdentary trough and Meckelian groove were still coded as absent in Hadrocodium (Luo et al., 2015), a confusing message has been signaled about the middle ear of Hadrocodium. At present, we can only entertain two possibilities for Hadrocodium, presence of the DMME or MdME, as shown in Figure 4. If the former is true, Hadrocodium represents the earliest known member of mammaliaforms that evolved the DMME in the Early Jurassic, independent that of mammals.\n\nLITERATURE CITED\n\nAllin EF. 1975.
