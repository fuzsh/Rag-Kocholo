        "text": "The multituberculate assemblage from the Early Cretaceous Khovoor locality in Mongolia, based on the study of 112 specimens in PIN collection, includes three taxa: arginbaatarid Arginbaatar dmitrievae Trofimov, 1980 (=Monobaatar mimicus Kielan-Jaworowska et al., 1987, new synonym) and two eobaatarids, Eobaatar magnus Kielan-Jaworowska et al., 1987 and Nokerbaatar minor (Kielan-Jaworowska et al., 1987), comb. nov. Both eobaatarid taxa from Khovoor differ from other known eobaatarids by lower incisors with enamel restricted to ventrolateral side. Contrary to the previous claims, in both Eobaatar magnus and Nokerbaatar minor P5 is sectorial tooth, as in other eobaatarids, different in morphology from P4. In Eobaatar and Nokerbaatar gen. nov., there is pronounced sculpture of radiating ridges on the upper premolars, which is partially also present on the upper molars. In Nokerbaatar, there is a ventrolingual groove on the lower incisor and p3 is relatively small, lacking serrations. In Eobaatar, there is a pronounced ventrolingual ridge on the lower incisor and p3 is relatively larger, with serrations. The number of infraorbital foramina is variable in Arginbaatar, with most specimens having two foramina. In Arginbaatar, the cusp ornamentation is poorly developed or absent on upper premolars and absent on upper molars. The sectorial dP5 was likely not replacing by P5. The molars (M2, m1–2) have conical cusps. The p4 is very large and highly variable in size and number of denticles (11–18). It lacks labial cusps and has restricted enamel. The p4 rotates mesioventrally during the ontogeny, which is unique for the Multituberculata. The p2 and dp3 are shed early during the ontogeny. The p3 is fully formed but cannot erupt because it is overhang by p4. In upper dentition, there is a replacement of dP3 by P3. Arginbaataridae are currently known only from Khovoor valley in Mongolia, while Eobaataridae were widely distributed in the Early Cretaceous in Asia and Europe.\n\nMesozoic deposits of the former Gondwanaland are depauperate in early mammals, in general, and multituberculate mammals, in particular. Until now, the oldest multituberculate mammals known from the Gondwanan continents come from the Early Cretaceous of Morocco, NW Africa. Here, we report the presence of a new multituberculate mammal, Indobaatar zofiae gen. et sp. nov., from the Lower/Middle Jurassic Kota Formation, Pranhita-Godavari valley in peninsular India. This is the first record of a multituberculate from the Mesozoic rocks of India and possibly predates the oldest known multituberculates from Gondwanan continents. The new specimen, representing an upper premolar (P(4)), compares well with the upper premolar morphology of Eobaatariinae multituberculates known from the Early Cretaceous of Mongolia, China, England, and Spain. Together with the recent findings of cimolodontan multituberculates from the Early Cretaceous of Australia and Late Cretaceous of South America, the new discovery indicates a wide temporal and spatial distribution for multituberculate mammals in the former Gondwanaland.\n\nTwo eobaatarid multituberculates, Heishanobaatar triangulus gen. et sp. nov. and Eobaataridae gen. et sp. indet., and an ?albionbaatarid multituberculate, Kielanobaatar badaohaoensis gen. et sp. nov., from the Lower Cretaceous (Aptian to Albian) Shahai and Fuxin formations in Liaoning Province, northeastern China, are described. Heishanobaatar triangulus is a moderate-sized multituberculate characterized by lower jaw dental formula 1.0.3.2, slender lower incisor, single-rooted p2, triangular p3 in lateral view, p4 with eight serrations, m1 with cusp formula 2:2, and m2 with cusp formula 1 (coalesced):2. Kielanobaatar badaohaoensis is characterized by upper anterior premolars with relatively flat occlusal surfaces, roughly pentangular P1 in occlusal view, P1 and P2 with three cusp rows (cusp formulae 1:3:2), and P3 with four cusps (cusp formula 2:2). Together with already described three species of eobaatarids from the same localities, they demonstrate that there were quite diverse multituberculates in Asia in the late Early Cretaceous, and suggest that the mammalian fauna known from the Shahai and Fuxin formations probably show a transitional state from the mammalian fauna of the Yixian Formation to Late Cretaceous Asian faunas.\n\nThe Late Jurassic (late Kimmeridgian) multituberculate assemblage from the Langenberg Quarry in Northern Germany includes Paulchoffatiidae indet., the pinheirodontid Teutonodon langenbergensis, and Cimbriodon multituberculatus gen. et sp. nov. of the paulchoffatiid line. A fragmentary m1 that was formerly attributed to Eobaataridae indet. is now assigned to the paulchoffatiid line. Teutonodon langenbergensis is one of the largest known Jurassic multituberculates and most derived known member of Pinheirodontidae. Cimbriodon multituberculatus, a derived member of the paulchoffatiid line is characterised by the upper premolars P4 and P5 showing three rows of cusps, with P5 having numerous cusps and being distinctly longer than P4, and the lower premolars p3 and p4 showing five serrations with long ridges. The new taxon is unique among multituberculates by the presence of several lingual cusps on p3 and p4. Rugosodon from the Late Jurassic of China differs from Paulchoffatiidae or Pinheirodontidae by seven serrations on p4, significantly reduced buccal cusps on p4, a p3 that has half the length of p4, and a simple bicuspid I3, and is referred to the paulchoffatiid line. Allodontidae is known only from western North America, Paulchoffatiidae and Pinheirodontidae only from Western and Central Europe (Portugal, Spain, Great Britain, and Germany). Plagiaulacidae is known from the earliest Cretaceous of Great Britain and of western North America. Zoobank: urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub:D8ECDD1D-931D-47E3-AAEE-D421B4C7079D"
