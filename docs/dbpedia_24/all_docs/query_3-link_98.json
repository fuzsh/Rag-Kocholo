The need for such a book became apparent from a graduate seminar in mammalian evolution I have taught over the past 20 years at the Johns Hopkins University. While we have witnessed the primary literature in the ﬁeld increase at an astonishing pace, it became evident that there was a real dearth of general books on the subject. Except for Savage and Long’s (1986) Mammal Evolution (which is now outdated and gave only a superficial account of many Paleogene groups), there was no available book that synthesized basic data on the extant mammals together with a survey of the rapidly improving mammalian fossil record to provide an overview of mammalian evolution. The Beginning of the Age of Mammals is intended to help ﬁll this void by presenting an in-depth account of current knowledge about mammalian evolution in the Early Cenozoic. It is designed to provide both graduate and undergraduate students with a comprehensive summary of the diversity and rich history of mammals, focusing on the early radiations of living clades and their archaic contemporaries. I hope it may serve as a useful reference for professionals as well. This is a book about fossils. The focus is on the anatomy preserved in the fossil record, and what it implies about relationships, phylogeny, evolution, behavior, paleoecology, and related issues. Other topics, such as geology, paleoﬂora, climate, and molecular systematics are discussed where they are pertinent, but they are subsidiary to the principal objective, which is to summarize the mammalian fossil record. I have chosen to concentrate on the Early Cenozoic part of that record not just because that is my personal interest, but also because it is the most critical part of the fossil record xi\n\nxii\n\nPreface\n\nwith regard to the origin and early adaptive radiations of almost all the major clades of extant mammals. Furthermore, substantial recent advances in our knowledge of mammals during this pivotal interval make this summary timely. I have endeavored to survey the literature through the end of 2004 and have added a few particularly pertinent references that are more recent, in order to furnish a review of all higher taxa of Paleocene and Eocene mammals that is as current as possible. Treatment of different groups is unavoidably uneven, a reﬂection of multiple factors, including the Early Cenozoic diversity of particular groups, the interest level they have generated, and the intensity at which they have been studied, especially recently. Judgments had to be made as to what was signiﬁcant enough to be included in a review of this sort and where to include more detail. I hope there have not been serious omissions. I have borrowed liberally from the classiﬁcation and range data presented by McKenna and Bell (1997, 2002) and have beneﬁted greatly from their vast experience. Although I have not always agreed with their arrangement (and have noted in the text where modiﬁcations were necessary), their monumental compilation provided the essential framework, without which this book would have been far more difﬁcult to achieve. One of the most important aspects of this kind of book is the quality and scope of illustrations. Rather than prepare new ﬁgures or redraw existing ones in an attempt at uniformity, I opted to reproduce the best available illustrations of a wide diversity of fossil mammals. The drawback of this approach is that multiple styles of illustration are often combined in the same composite ﬁgure. However, I believe the beneﬁt of using original illustrations signiﬁcantly outweighs the aesthetic of redrawing them all in the same style, with its inherent risk of introducing inaccuracies. For ease of comparison, I have taken liberties in sizing and reversing many images, with apologies to the original artists for anomalies of lighting that may result. I have tried to illustrate at least\n\none member of each Early Cenozoic family (except a few obscure families, and some families of the highly diverse artiodactyls and rodents). Figures were selected to give readers an impression of the diversity of fossil mammals, the state of the evidence, and the most important specimens or taxa. Throughout the book, my goal has been not just to present current interpretations of the mammalian fossil record but also to highlight the quality of the evidence and analyses on which these inferences are based. I have tried to indicate where the data are particularly sound and convincing, as well as where the evidence is more tenuous or ambiguous. The latter examples should be especially fruitful areas for further research. I hope that I have been able to impart some of my enthusiasm for mammalian paleontology, and to demonstrate that fossils are not just curiosities but are the key to understanding the extraordinary history of life. George Gaylord Simpson perhaps best captured the allure of paleontology in his classic Attending Marvels, recounting his 1930–1931 Scarritt Expedition to Patagonia in search of fossil mammals (Simpson, 1965: 82): Fossil hunting is far the most fascinating of all sports. I speak for myself, although I do not see how any true sportsman could fail to agree with me if he had tried bone digging. It has some danger, enough to give it zest and probably about as much as in the average modern engineered big-game hunt, and the danger is wholly to the hunter. It has uncertainty and excitement and all the thrills of gambling with none of its vicious features. The hunter never knows what his bag may be, perhaps nothing, perhaps a creature never before seen by human eyes. Over the next hill may lie a great discovery! It requires knowledge, skill, and some degree of hardihood. And its results are so much more important, more worth while, and more enduring than those of any other sport! The fossil hunter does not kill; he resurrects. And the result of his sport is to add to the sum of human pleasure and to the treasures of human knowledge.\n\n} ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nA\n\nN UNDERTAKING OF THIS SORT could not be accomplished without the support, assistance, and input of many people. First, I thank my colleagues in the Center for Functional Anatomy and Evolution (FAE), Valerie De Leon, Chris Ruff, Mark Teaford, and Dave Weishampel, for their encouragement, illuminating discussions, sharing of knowledge, and numerous other favors. I also thank the FAE graduate students, past and present, who have helped to inspire this book. Many of them have read and corrected chapters, offered helpful insights, or provided information or other assistance, which is much appreciated. Jay Mussell and Mary Silcox deserve special mention for many stimulating discussions and enlightening me on several topics. I am especially grateful to Shawn Zack, who has freely shared his broad knowledge of mammalian fossils and the literature, and who has helped with countless tasks in the preparation of this book. The assistance of Arlene Daniel in the FAE administrative ofﬁce has been much appreciated during all stages of the project. I am enormously indebted to Anne Marie Boustani, who undertook the formidable task of scanning, resizing, arranging, and labeling all of the ﬁgures in the book, in some cases multiple times, to achieve the best possible result. In so doing she has made a huge and fundamental contribution to this work. She also drafted all the cladograms and a number of original ﬁgures. Her dedication, perseverance, and cheerfulness throughout this painstaking process are very much appreciated. Part of the preparation of this volume was undertaken during my tenure of an Alexander von Humboldt Award in the Institut für Paläontologie at the University of Bonn, Germany, in 2003–2004, for which I thank the A. von Humboldt Foundation. The faculty, staff, and students at the Institut für Paläontologie, especially Prof. Wighart xiii\n\nxiv\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nvon Koenigswald, created an ideal environment for this work, and I am very grateful for their support. Throughout preparation of this book, I have consulted with numerous colleagues about their areas of expertise. Their generosity in providing advice, information, casts or images, permission to reproduce illustrations, and other assistance has been overwhelming and has been instrumental in completion of the work. I extend my gratitude to them all. Almost half of those listed sent original photographs, slides, drawings, or electronic images, which often required considerable time and effort on their part. I have attempted to acknowledge here all those who have contributed; nevertheless, as this project has been a decade in development, inadvertent omissions are likely, and I ask the indulgence of anyone overlooked. My appreciation goes to David Archibald, Rob Asher, Chris Beard, Lílian Bergqvist, Jon Bloch, José Bonaparte, Louis de Bonis, Tom Bown, Percy Butler, Rich Cifelli, Russ Ciochon, Bill Clemens, Jean-Yves Crochet, Fuzz Crompton, Demberelyin Dashzeveg, Mary Dawson, Daryl Domning, Stéphane Ducrocq, Bob Emry, Burkart Engesser, Jörg Erfurt, John Fleagle, Ewan Fordyce, Dick Fox, Jens Franzen, Eberhard Frey, Emmanuel Gheerbrant, Philip Gingerich, Marc Godinot, Gabriele Gruber, Gregg Gunnell, Jörg Habersetzer, Gerhard Hahn, Sue Hand, Jean-Louis Hartenberger, Ron Heinrich, Jerry Hooker, Jim Hopson, Yaoming Hu, Bob Hunt, Jean-Jacques Jaeger, Christine Janis, Farish Jenkins, Dany Kalthoff, Zoﬁa Kielan-Jaworowska, Wighart von Koenigswald, Bill Korth, Dave Krause, Conny Kurz, Brigitte Lange-Badré, Chuankuei Li, Jay Lillegraven, Alexey Lopatin, Spencer Lucas, Zhexi Luo, Bruce MacFadden, Thomas Martin, Malcolm McKenna, Jim Mellett, Jin Meng, Michael Morlo, Christian de Muizon, Xijun Ni, Mike Novacek, Rosendo Pascual, Hans-Ulrich Pfretzschner, Don Prothero, Rajendra Rana, Tab Rasmussen, John Rensberger, Guillermo Rougier, Don Russell, Bob Schoch, Erik Seiffert, Bernard Sigé, Denise Sigogneau-Russell, Elwyn Simons, Gerhard Storch, Jean Sudre, Hans-Dieter Sues, Fred Szalay, Hans Thewissen, Suyin Ting, Yuki Tomida, Yongsheng Tong, Bill Turnbull, Mark Uhen, Banyue Wang, Xaioming Wang, John Wible, Jack Wilson, and Shawn Zack. Wherever possible, illustrators have been acknowledged as well (see the last printed pages of the book). Special thanks\n\nare due the following scientiﬁc illustrators for allowing reproduction, and in many cases providing images, of their work: Doug Boyer, Bonnie Dalzell, Utako Kikutani, John Klausmeyer, Mark Klingler, Karen Klitz, Jay Matternes, Bonnie Miljour, Mary Parrish, and especially Elaine Kasmer, my illustrator for many years. I have also beneﬁted from the experience and wisdom of friends and esteemed colleagues who reviewed sections of the text for accuracy, including Rich Cifelli, Mary Dawson, Daryl Domning, John Fleagle, John Flynn, Ewan Fordyce, Jerry Hooker, Christine Janis, Zoﬁa Kielan-Jaworowska, Wighart von Koenigswald, Zhexi Luo, Thierry Smith, Scott Wing, and Shawn Zack. I am grateful to all of them for numerous corrections and clariﬁcations, which improved the text substantially. I am especially indebted to Bill Clemens and Malcolm McKenna, whose critical reading of the entire text and sage advice has been invaluable. Although I have relied on the counsel of these distinguished authorities to avoid errors, omissions, and ambiguities, I did not always follow their suggestions, and any shortcomings that remain are, of course, my own responsibility. I take this opportunity to acknowledge the encouragement and guidance of several people who fostered my interest in paleontology during my student years (listed more or less chronologically): Dave Stager, Margaret Thomas, Bob Salkin, Don Baird, Nick Hotton, Clayton Ray, Glenn Jepsen, Elwyn Simons, George Gaylord Simpson, Bryan Patterson, and Philip Gingerich. Without their support, particularly at pivotal periods in my life, I would not be a vertebrate paleontologist today. This project would never have made it to fruition without the able guidance of my editor at the Johns Hopkins University Press, Vincent Burke. To him, as well as to Wendy Harris, Linda Forlifer, Martha Sewall, and Carol Eckhart at the press, and to Peter Strupp, Cyd Westmoreland, and the staff at Princeton Editorial Associates, I extend my sincere thanks for seeing this volume through. Last but not least, I am most grateful to my family— my wife Jennie and daughters Katie and Chelsea—for their unwavering faith in me and their steadfast encouragement throughout the long gestation of this project, especially when it seemed unachievable. They are to be credited with its completion.\n\nThe Beginning of the Age of Mammals\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\n1 Introduction\n\nM\n\nAMMALS ARE AMONG THE MOST successful animals on earth. They occupy every major habitat from the equator to the poles, on land, underground, in the trees, in the air, and in both fresh and marine waters. They have invaded diverse locomotor and dietary niches, and range in size from no larger than a bumblebee (the bumblebee bat Craseonycteris: body length 3 cm, weight 2 g) to the largest animal that ever evolved (the blue whale Balaenoptera: body length 30 m, weight > 100,000 kg). Just over a decade ago, the principal references recognized 4,327 or 4,629 extant mammal species in 21–26 orders (Corbet and Hill, 1991; Wilson and Reeder, 1993), the discrepancy mainly in marsupial orders. The most recent account now recognizes 29 orders of living mammals (the increase mainly reﬂecting the breakup of Insectivora), with more than 5,400 species in 1,229 genera (Wilson and Reeder, 2005). But many times those numbers of genera and species are extinct. Indeed, McKenna and Bell (1997) recognized more than 4,000 extinct mammal genera, many of which belong to remarkable clades that left no living descendants. The great majority of extinct taxa are from the Cenozoic, the last one-third of mammalian history. What were these extinct forms like? What made them successful, and what led to their eventual demise? How were they related to extant mammals? When, where, and how did the ancestors of modern mammals evolve, and what factors contributed to the survival of their clades? This book addresses those questions by focusing on the mammalian radiation during the Paleocene and Eocene epochs, essentially the ﬁrst half of the Cenozoic Era. Although this radiation has attracted far less popular interest than that of dinosaurs, it was a pivotal interval in the history of vertebrates, which set the stage for\n\n1\n\n2\n\nthe beginning of the age of mammals\n\nthe present-day mammalian fauna, as well as our own evolution. At its start, the end of the Cretaceous Period, the last nonavian dinosaurs disappeared, leaving a vast, uninhabited ecospace. Mammals quickly moved in, partitioning this landscape in new ways. They were not, however, the ﬁrst mammals. Mammals evolved from their synapsid ancestors around the end of the Triassic Period, more than 200 million years ago, and coexisted with dinosaurs, other archosaurs, and various reptiles (among other creatures) for at least 140 million years during the Mesozoic Era. But during that ﬁrst twothirds of mammalian history, innovation was seemingly stiﬂed—at least, in comparison to what followed in the early Cenozoic. It is fair to say that mammals survived during the Mesozoic but, with a few notable exceptions, rarely ﬂourished. The biggest mammals during that era were little larger than a beaver, and only a few reached that size. Most Mesozoic mammals were relatively generalized compared to the mammals that evolved within the ﬁrst 10–15 million years of the Cenozoic—although recent discoveries hint at greater diversity than was previously known. KielanJaworowska et al. (2004) present a thorough, current account of mammalian evolution during the Mesozoic. Like most clades, mammals were severely affected by the terminal Cretaceous mass extinctions. Most Mesozoic mammal radiations became extinct without issue. Indeed, twothirds of the 35 families of Late Cretaceous mammals listed by McKenna and Bell (1997) disappeared at the end of the Cretaceous. In the northern Western Interior of North America, mammalian extinctions were even more severe, affecting 80–90% of lineages (Clemens, 2002). A small number of clades crossed the Cretaceous/Tertiary (K/T) boundary, most notably, several lineages of multituberculates, eutherians, and marsupials; the latter two groups quickly dominated the vertebrate fauna on land. (Multituberculates are an extinct group of small, herbivorous mammals that were the most successful Mesozoic mammals; see Chapter 4.) Those few lineages that survived the K/T extinctions are the mammals that ultimately gave rise to the diversity of Cenozoic mammals. It is notable that all three of these groups had existed for at least as long before the K/T boundary as after it, yet the fossil evidence suggests that only the multituberculates radiated widely during the Mesozoic. The Mesozoic was the heyday of multituberculates. They shared the Earth with dinosaurs for 90 million years or more, becoming diverse and abundant in many northern faunas, only to be outcompeted by other mammals before the end of the Eocene. Even those other mammals—metatherians and eutherians (often grouped as therians, or crown therians)—had diverged from a common stem by 125 million years ago. But this divergence occurred well after the multituberculate radiation was under way. Perhaps competition from multituberculates and other archaic mammals—as well as archosaurs— prevented metatherians and eutherians from undergoing major adaptive radiations during the Mesozoic. Whatever\n\nthe reason, during the Cretaceous, these groups failed to attain anything close to the morphological or taxonomic diversity they would achieve in the ﬁrst 10–15 million years of the Cenozoic.\n\nTHE EARLY CENOZOIC MAMMALIAN RADIATION The fossil record documents an extensive and rapid— often described as “explosive”—adaptive radiation of mammals during the ﬁrst third of the Cenozoic, characterized by a dramatic increase in diversity of therian mammals soon after the mass extinctions at the end of the Cretaceous (e.g., McKenna and Bell, 1997; Alroy, 1999; Novacek, 1999; Archibald and Deutschman, 2001). Nearly all of the modern mammal orders, as well as many extinct orders, ﬁrst appear in the fossil record during this interval (Rose and Archibald, 2005). This era was the “Beginning of the Age of Mammals” alluded to by Simpson (1937c, 1948, 1967). The adaptive radiation was particularly intense soon after the ﬁnal extinction of nonavian dinosaurs at the K/T boundary. In the famous Hell Creek section of Montana, for instance, Archibald (1983) found that diversity increased from an average of about 20 mammal species immediately following the K/T boundary to 33 species within the ﬁrst half-million years, 47 after 1 million years, and 70 after 2–3 million years. For the same intervals, the number of genera rose from about 14 to 30, then 36, and ﬁnally 52. Although some of these numbers could be inﬂated as a result of reworking (discovered subsequent to Archibald’s analysis), the overall pattern was upheld in a more recent study by Clemens (2002), who reported that 70% of early Puercan mammals of Montana were alien species new to the northern Western Interior of North America. Similarly, Lillegraven and Eberle (1999) observed a signiﬁcant mammalian radiation, particularly involving condylarths, at the beginning of the Cenozoic (after the disappearance of nonavian dinosaurs) in the Hanna Basin of southern Wyoming. Only nine mammal species, including just two eutherians, were present in uppermost Cretaceous strata. By contrast, 35 species (75% of them eutherians), almost all presumed immigrants, were recorded from the earliest Paleocene. They further reported that “major experimentations in dental morphology and increasing ranges of body sizes had developed within 400,000 years of the [K/T] boundary” (Lillegraven and Eberle, 1999: 691). Based on ranges provided by McKenna and Bell (1997), 52 families of mammals are known worldwide from the early Paleocene, but only eight of them continued from the Late Cretaceous—more than 80% were new (Fig. 1.1). Only ﬁve therian families are known to have crossed the K/T boundary, two of which are present in late Paleocene or Eocene sediments but have not yet been found in the early Paleocene. On a more local level, Lofgren (1995) reported that the survival rate of mammalian species across the K/T boundary in the Hell Creek area of Montana was only about 10%.\n\nIntroduction\n\n3\n\nFig. 1.1.

(Compiled from McKenna and Bell, 1997, with minor modiﬁcations.)\n\nThus there appears to have been a sharp decline in mammalian diversity at the end of the Cretaceous, followed by a fairly rapid rise in diversity soon after the K/T boundary. Although the geographic source of many of the newcomers is uncertain, it is important to note that many early Paleocene metatherians and eutherians can plausibly be derived either from other early Paleocene forms or from known Late Cretaceous therian families (including some that did not cross the boundary). For these mammals, it is not necessary to postulate long periods of unrecorded evolution. But it is questionable whether all the diversity that emerged in the Paleocene can be traced to the small number of lineages that we know crossed the K/T boundary. Could the alien species of the northern Western Interior represent clades that were evolving in areas that have not been sampled? And if so, could these clades have existed for a substantial period during the Mesozoic? The answers to these questions are unknown. However, as shown in Fig. 1.1, the fossil record documents that family-level diversity continued to increase through the middle Eocene, then declined somewhat into the early Oligocene, after which it rose again to an all-time high in the middle Miocene (a standing diversity of 162 families). Notably, up to the middle Eocene, the number of new families equaled or exceeded the number that continued from the previous interval. The present volume is an attempt to summarize current knowledge of the record of this extensive PaleoceneEocene radiation and the roles of mammals in the world of the Early Cenozoic, which are essential for understanding the structure and composition of present-day ecosystems. This volume focuses on the fossil evidence of these early mammals and what their anatomy indicates about interrelationships, evolution, and ways of life. First it is necessary, however, to touch on several issues that affect the interpretation of that record. These include the timing of the radiation, how phylogenetic relationships are established, the\n\ninterrelationships and classiﬁcation of mammals, and the chronologic framework of the Early Cenozoic.\n\nTIMING OF THE CROWN-THERIAN RADIATION The question of when the therian radiation took place is a contentious issue, whose answer depends on the kind of data employed—paleontological (morphological) or molecular. There are three principal models of the timing of origin and diversiﬁcation of placental mammals (Archibald and Deutschman, 2001), which also apply generally to the therian radiation (Fig. 1.2): 1. The explosive model, in which mammalian orders both originated and diversiﬁed in a short period of about 10 million years after the K/T boundary (see also Alroy, 1999; Benton, 1999; Foote et al., 1999); 2. The long-fuse model, in which mammalian intraordinal diversiﬁcation was mostly post-Cretaceous, but interordinal divergence took place in the Cretaceous, when stem taxa of the orders existed (Douady and Douzery, 2003; Springer et al., 2003); and 3. The short-fuse model, in which ordinal origin and diversiﬁcation occurred well back in the Cretaceous (e.g., Springer, 1997; Kumar and Hedges, 1998). Paleontological evidence generally supports either the explosive model or the long-fuse model, whereas molecular evidence generally supports the short-fuse model. Let us consider the molecular evidence ﬁrst. Although this book is about the fossil record, the impact of recent molecular studies on our understanding of mammalian interrelationships and divergence times has been substantial and cannot be ignored. It is chieﬂy molecular evidence (genetic distance, as measured by differences in nucleotide sequences\n\n4\n\nthe beginning of the age of mammals\n\nFig. 1.2.

(From Archibald and Deutschman, 2001).\n\nof mitochondrial and nuclear genes) that has been used to suggest that many therian mammal orders originated and diversiﬁed during the Cretaceous, some of them more than 100 million years ago (e.g., Hedges et al., 1996; Springer, 1997; Kumar and Hedges, 1998; Easteal, 1999; Adkins et al., 2003). According to this hypothesis, it was the break-up of land masses, not invasion of vacated niches following K/T extinctions, that accounts for the mammalian radiation (Hedges et al., 1996; Eizirik et al., 2001). Other recent molecular studies, however, have produced later divergence times, much closer to the K/T boundary or even early in the Cenozoic, which are more consistent with the fossil record (Table 1.1; Huchon et al., 2002; Springer et al., 2003). It is often claimed that molecular evidence is more reliable (if not infallible) for assessing divergence times and relationships than is the fossil record, leading some molecular systematists to dismiss fossil evidence entirely. But discordant divergence estimates in different studies—and their variance with the fossil record or with anatomical evidence— raise questions about their dependability. The literature contains many examples of molecular divergence times and phylogenetic conclusions that have subsequently been discredited. Discrepancies in divergence estimates may result from various factors, including the choice of molecular sequences and taxa used, calibration dates, phylogenetic methods applied, and the assumption of a constant rate of molecular change (Bromham et al., 1999; Smith and Peter-\n\nson, 2002; Springer et al., 2003; Graur and Martin, 2004). It is now known that rates of molecular evolution are heterogeneous both between and within lineages, and at different gene loci (e.g., Ayala, 1997; Smith and Peterson, 2002). Moreover, it appears that molecular clock-based estimates consistently overestimate divergence times (Rodriguez-Trelles et al., 2002). In view of these potential problems, divergence estimates based on molecular data should be viewed with caution. The fossil record provides the only direct evidence of the occurrence of mammalian orders in the past. But fossils merely indicate the minimum age of a clade, which is likely to be younger than its origin (i.e., its divergence from a sister group or ancestor). Nearly all “modern” orders—those with living representatives—are ﬁrst seen in the fossil record after the K/T boundary, apparently supporting the explosive model, or possibly the long-fuse model. Indeed, only four extant orders of mammals are potentially known from the Cretaceous, and the ordinal assignments of the relevant fossils are far from secure. They include the monotreme order Platypoda and two living orders of marsupials, Didelphimorphia and Paucituberculata (McKenna and Bell, 1997). Among placental mammals, only a single extant order, Lipotyphla, has so far been tentatively identiﬁed in the Late Cretaceous of the northern continents. There is a possible Early Cretaceous record of Lipotyphla from Australia, but it is highly controversial. Several other Cretaceous fossils might be related to the Cenozoic radiation, but all are too distant morphologically and phylogenetically to be assigned to modern orders. Notable among them are zalambdalestids and zhelestids, the oldest of which are about 85 million years old. Zalambdalestids are considered by some experts to be stem members of the superordinal clade (Anagalida) that includes rodents, lagomorphs, and possibly elephant-shrews (Macroscelidea), whereas zhelestids have been considered to be basal ungulatomorphs (at the base of the ungulate radiation). But recent phylogenetic analyses based on new morphological evidence have challenged these hypotheses. Even if the original assessments were correct, they would at best place a minimum age of 85 million years on some superordinal divergences, which would be consistent with the long-fuse model. Other therians of similar age can be identiﬁed as metatherians or eutherians, but they are so primitive that they are not assignable to extant orders or even superordinal clades. It is not until the latest Cretaceous (Maastrichtian or Lancian), the last 5 million years or so before the K/T boundary, that a small number of lineages are present that could represent “modern” clades or stem taxa of extant orders. Thus, taken at face value, the fossil record seems to provide overwhelming evidence that most modern orders did not evolve until the Early Cenozoic. Robertson et al. (2004) proposed an intriguing scenario that could explain the “explosive” appearance of the early Cenozoic mammalian radiation. They postulated that the terminal Cretaceous bolide impact resulted in a short-term (hours-long) global heat pulse that “would have killed un-\n\nIntroduction\n\n5\n\nTable 1.1.

They further speculated that a small number of Cretaceous mammal lineages found shelter in subterranean burrows or in the water and survived the heat pulse. In their scenario, it was these lineages that ultimately gave rise to the Cenozoic mammalian radiation. This scenario supports the longfuse model. Several other possible explanations for the absence of modern orders in the Cretaceous have been advanced (Foote et al., 1999). Some researchers have claimed that the Cretaceous fossil record is too incomplete to reveal whether the mammalian radiation occurred during the Cretaceous or subsequently (e.g., Easteal, 1999; Smith and Peterson, 2002). Alternatively, it has been argued that Cretaceous fossils of modern orders might actually exist but are unrecognized because they lack any distinguishing characters. In other words, genetic divergence may have preceded morphological divergence (Cooper and Fortey, 1998; Tavaré et al., 2002). Neither argument is very convincing. The possibility that mammals were diversifying somewhere with a poor fossil record, such as Africa or Antarctica (dubbed the “Garden of Eden” hypothesis by Foote et al., 1999), of course cannot be ruled out. Our knowledge of Cretaceous faunas remains limited both geographically and temporally, and the possibility exists that none of the explorations to date has sampled the locations or habitats where the antecedents of modern orders were evolving (see Clemens, 2002, for a recent discussion). Nevertheless, it is also notable that the fossil record of Cretaceous mammals has increased exponentially in recent years, extending into areas and continents where the record was formerly blank; yet no new evidence of the presence of extant orders has materialized. Instead, an array of mostly archaic Mesozoic clades has emerged. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that fossils of extant\n\norders have not been discovered in the Cretaceous because they had not yet evolved (Benton, 1999; Foote et al., 1999; Novacek, 1999). It is also true that if molecular and morphological evolution were decoupled, it might be impossible to recognize early ordinal representatives (in analogy with the genetic but not morphological separation of sibling species). However, no precedent is known for such a lengthy period of signiﬁcant genetic evolution without concomitant anatomical change, and the fossil record argues against it. Although gaps remain in our knowledge of the origin of many orders, the past decade or so has seen the discovery of many remarkable fossils that appear to document post-Cretaceous transitional stages in the origin of orders, including Rodentia, Lagomorpha, Proboscidea, Sirenia, Cetacea, and Macroscelidea. Both fossil and molecular evidence are pertinent to resolving the timing of the therian radiation. Better understanding of both are necessary to resolve remaining conﬂicts. It will also be important to understand the actual effects on the mammalian fauna of physical events, such as the terminal Cretaceous bolide impact.\n\nMAMMALIAN PHYLOGENY, INTERRELATIONSHIPS, AND CLASSIFICATION There is only one true phylogeny of mammals, and deciphering it is the challenge of mammalian systematics. All phylogenetic studies are works in progress, based on the evidence at hand or, more often, subsets of the available evidence. They should be regarded as hypotheses based on that evidence. Some are better (and presumably more reliable) than others, but none is likely to be the last word on the subject. Each hypothesis is only as good as the evidence\n\n6\n\nthe beginning of the age of mammals\n\nit is based on, the characters chosen, how carefully those characters have been examined, and the phylogenetic methods and assumptions employed.\n\nDetermining Relationships: The Evidence of Evolution Two fundamental kinds of evidence are used to determine relationships and phylogeny of mammals and other organisms: anatomical and molecular (genetic). Anatomical evidence usually includes features of the skeleton, dentition, or soft anatomy. Molecular evidence typically consists of sequences of proteins or segments of mitochondrial or nuclear genes. Until the last 25 years or so, mammalian relationships were usually based largely or entirely on anatomical features. The extent of similarity was often the chief criterion, and the distinction between specialized or derived (apomorphic) and primitive (plesiomorphic) features was often blurred. However, it is now virtually universally accepted that only shared derived features or synapomorphies —specialized traits inherited from a common ancestor—are signiﬁcant for establishing close relationship, whereas shared primitive features (symplesiomorphies) do not reﬂect special relationship. In practice it is not always self-evident whether a trait is primitive or derived. This distinction, the polarity of the trait, is always relative to previous or later conditions, hence its correct determination depends to some extent on the phylogeny we are trying to decipher. It follows that the same character can be derived relative to more primitive taxa and primitive with respect to more advanced taxa. Circularity is avoided by using many independent characters to determine phylogeny; nevertheless, polarity is usually an a priori judgment, based on predetermined ingroup and outgroup taxa. The choice of such taxa (and their character states) ultimately determines the polarity of characters in the ingroup. Thus a change in perceived relationships can result in a change in character polarity. The polarity of some characters is relatively obvious. For example, modiﬁcation of the forelimbs into wings in bats is an apomorphic condition among mammals, a synapomorphy of all bats, and at the same time a symplesiomorphy of the genera within any family of bats. Less obvious is the polarity of transverse crests or cross-lophs on the upper molars of some basal perissodactyls. This feature has been considered either primitive or derived, depending on the presumed sister-group of perissodactyls. The terms “primitive” or “plesiomorphic” versus “derived” or “apomorphic” are sometimes extended to taxa, to reﬂect their general morphological condition, but they are more properly restricted to characters. Of course, not all derived features shared by two animals necessarily reﬂect close relationship. It is well known that similar anatomical features have independently evolved repeatedly in evolution. Such iterative evolution is often associated with similar function, and it occurs both in groups with no close relationship (convergence) and in closely allied lineages with a common ancestor that lacked the derived\n\ntrait (parallelism). Independent evolution of similar traits is called homoplasy. The challenge for systematists is distinguishing synapomorphic from homoplastic traits. This problem has long been realized by morphologists, and examples of morphological homoplasy abound. In some cases it is easily recognized by the lack of homology of the similar trait or by signiﬁcant differences in other characters. For instance, there is ample evidence to demonstrate that the Pleistocene saber-toothed cat Smilodon was convergent to the Miocene saber-toothed marsupial Thylacosmilus, that creodonts and borhyaenid marsupials were dentally convergent to Carnivora, and that remarkably similar running and gliding adaptations evolved multiple times independently. But whether the specialized three-ossicle middle ear evolved only once in mammals or multiple times convergently is more ambiguous and may require additional evidence (see Chapter 4 for new evidence suggesting multiple origins). Despite widespread assumption to the contrary, molecular sequences are also susceptible to homoplasy, as recent examples demonstrate (e.g., Bull et al., 1997; Pecon Slattery et al., 2000).\n\nMonophyly and Paraphyly Just as synapomorphic features indicate common ancestry (monophyletic origin), the extent and distinctiveness of synapomorphies reﬂect proximity of relationship. The term “monophyletic” was long used to indicate descent from a common ancestor, but following Hennig (1966), monophyly now usually connotes not just single origin but also inclusion of all descendants from that ancestor (holophyly of Ashlock, 1971). Monophyletic groups or taxa are called clades. Groups believed to have evolved from more than one ancestor are referred to as polyphyletic and, once demonstrated, are rejected. Such was the case with the original concept of Edentata, which consisted of xenarthrans, pangolins, and aardvarks. Each is now known to constitute a distinct order with a separate origin. However, bats, pinnipeds, rodents, odontocetes, and Mammalia itself have all been claimed to be diphyletic or polyphyletic at some time during the past several decades, but recent analyses once again suggest that all are monophyletic. The term paraphyletic is often applied to groups that are monophyletic in origin but do not include all descendants. Such groups lack unique synapomorphies. Some authors prefer to avoid paraphyletic taxa, or to enclose their names in quotation marks. That convention is not adopted here. Although at ﬁrst glance elimination of paraphyletic groups would seem to streamline taxonomy, it may instead introduce new problems, including a highly cumbersome hierarchy and taxonomic instability. These problems arise in part because some taxa once thought to be paraphyletic, when better known, are now regarded as monophyletic, and vice versa. Some groups seem to be obviously paraphyletic (e.g., the current conception of condylarths, the stem group of many ungulate orders), but for many others, their status is less clear. For example, phenacodontid condylarths could\n\nIntroduction\n\nbe either the monophyletic sister taxon of perissodactyls and paenungulates or their paraphyletic stem group. Mesonychia, for the last 30 years regarded as the paraphyletic stem group of Cetacea, is now considered by some to be a monophyletic side branch, as Cetacea appear to be more closely related to artiodactyls. Artiodactyla, long held to be one of the most stable monophyletic groups, could in fact be paraphyletic unless Cetacea are included. These examples highlight the uncertainty of identifying and verifying paraphyly, even in the face of a good fossil record. Carroll (1988: 13) concluded that as many as half of all species are paraphyletic and that “the existence of paraphyletic groups is an inevitable result of the process of evolution.” In fact, it is often the paraphyletic taxa—especially those that gave rise to descendants that diverged sufﬁciently to be assigned to separate higher taxa—that are of greatest evolutionary interest. Undoubtedly we have only begun to recognize which taxa are paraphyletic. Consequently no attempt is made in this text to eliminate paraphyletic groups. Some, such as Condylarthra, Plesiadapiformes, Miacoidea, and Palaeanodonta, are retained for convenience, and their probable paraphyletic nature noted, pending a better understanding of their relationships.\n\nPhylogeny and Classiﬁcation Phylogenetic inferences ideally should be based on all available evidence, but practical considerations restrict most analyses. The majority of studies have been based on either morphological traits or molecular sequences, and usually on only a subset of those data partitions. For example, analyses of fossil taxa are necessarily limited to the anatomy of the hard parts, because soft anatomy and molecular data are not available. In addition, the outcome of phylogenetic analysis may vary depending on such factors as the choice of taxa, outgroups, and characters, the description and scoring of those characters, weighting of characters, and methods used. Consequently there are many reasons not to accept phylogenetic hypotheses uncritically. Recent attempts to combine morphological and molecular data, optimistically called “total evidence” analysis, suffer from our ignorance of how to analyze such disparate characters meaningfully. How do individual base-pairs in a gene sequence compare with speciﬁc anatomical features, and should they be equally weighted in phylogenetic analyses? Total evidence analyses commonly treat individual base-pairs (sometimes even noninformative base-pairs) as equivalent to anatomical characters. Because a single gene segment may consist of hundreds of base-pairs, this practice almost always results in the molecular characters far outnumbering anatomical characters and potentially biasing the outcome. Another approach to combining data partitions is called “supertree” analysis. This method constructs a phylogeny based on multiple “source trees” drawn from individual phylogenetic analyses of morphological or molecular data (e.g., Sanderson et al., 1998; Liu et al., 2001). It is not clear, how-\n\n7\n\never, that this approach is superior to the individual analyses on which it is based. Some of the weaknesses of this approach were summarized by Springer and de Jong (2001). Phylogenetic analyses typically use such methods as parsimony for morphological data sets and maximum likelihood or Bayesian analysis for molecular data sets. Which method is more likely to yield the most accurate tree is debatable, but it is probable that evolution does not always proceed parsimoniously. The results of these analyses are presented in cladograms that depict hypothetical relationships in branching patterns. The best resolved patterns are dichotomous; unresolved relationships are shown as multiple branches from the same point or node (polytomies). This text focuses on the morphological evidence for mammalian relationships, although mention is made of contrasting phylogenetic arrangements suggested by molecular analyses. Most chapters include both classiﬁcations and cladograms. Although both are based on relationships, their goals are somewhat different. Cladograms place taxa in phylogenetic context by depicting hypotheses of relationship; consequently they are inherently more mutable. A classiﬁcation provides a systematic framework and should therefore retain stability to the extent possible while remaining “consistent with the relationships used as its basis” (Simpson, 1961: 110; see also Mayr, 1969). Most classiﬁcations adopted in individual chapters loosely follow the classiﬁcation of McKenna and Bell (1997, 2002). Minor modiﬁcations, such as changes in rank, are present throughout the book; but where signiﬁcant departures from that classiﬁcation are made, they are noted in the text or tables. For ease of reference, families and genera known from the Paleocene or Eocene are shown in boldface in the tables accompanying Chapter 5 and beyond. The cladograms presented reﬂect either individual conclusions or a consensus of recent studies, and they do not always precisely mirror the classiﬁcations. The taxonomy employed in this volume represents a compromise between cladistic and traditional classiﬁcations, while attempting to present a consensus view of interrelationships. Such a compromise is necessary in order to use taxonomic ranks that reﬂect relationship and indicate roughly equivalent groupings, and at the same time avoid the nomenclatural problems inherent in a nested hierarchy (McKenna and Bell, 1997). The standard Linnaean categories, as modiﬁed by McKenna and Bell (1997), remain useful and are employed here, although unranked taxa between named ranks are necessary in a few cases (e.g., Catarrhini and Platyrrhini in the classiﬁcation of Primates). As pointed out by McKenna and Bell (1997), among others, taxa of the same rank (apart from species) are not commensurate. For example, it is not possible to establish that a family in one order is an equivalent unit to families in other orders (or in the same order, for that matter). Nor are the orders themselves equivalent. Nevertheless, the taxonomic hierarchy does provide a useful relative measure of afﬁnity within groups and of the distance between them. As recognized in this volume, higher taxa are primarily stem-based. A stem-based taxon consists of all taxa that\n\n8\n\nthe beginning of the age of mammals\n\nFig. 1.3. Stem-based versus crown-group deﬁnition of taxa, illustrated by the Proboscidea. A crown-group deﬁnition limits Proboscidea to node B, equivalent to the extant family Elephantidae. Using a stem-based deﬁnition, Proboscidea includes all taxa more closely related to living elephants than to Sirenia or Desmostylia or Embrithopoda, as indicated here at node A. This stem-based deﬁnition is adopted in the most recent study of primitive proboscideans (Gheerbrant, Sudre, et al., 2005) and is followed here. See Chapter 13 for details of the proboscidean and tethythere radiations.\n\nshare a more recent common ancestor with a speciﬁed form than with another taxon (e.g., De Queiroz and Gauthier, 1992). For example, Proboscidea is considered to include all taxa more closely related to extant elephants than to sirenians (Fig. 1.3). Therefore, using a stem-based deﬁnition, extinct moeritheriids and gomphotheres are proboscideans. This convention leaves open the possibility that other unknown stem-taxa may exist and could lie phylogenetically outside the known taxa, yet still lie closer to elephants than to any other major clade. Such was the case when the older and more primitive numidotheriids were discovered. A node-based taxon is deﬁned as all descendants of the most recent common ancestor of two speciﬁed taxa. In the example above, a node-based Proboscidea could be arbitrarily recognized at the common ancestor of numidotheres and other proboscideans, or of moeritheres and other proboscideans (thus excluding numidotheres). A special category of node-based taxa, which has been applied by some authors to mammalian orders, is the crown-group. A crowngroup is deﬁned as all descendants of the common ancestor of the living members of a speciﬁed taxon ( Jefferies, 1979; De Queiroz and Gauthier, 1992). By such a deﬁnition, nearly all fossil groups are excluded from Proboscidea, and other well-known basal forms are excluded from higher taxa to which they have long been attributed and with which they share common ancestry and diagnostic anatomical features (Lucas, 1992; McKenna and Bell, 1997). Stem-based taxa are here considered more useful than node-based taxa for reference to the Early Cenozoic mammalian radiation. The synoptic classiﬁcation of mammals used in this book is given in Table 1.2. Mammalian relationships based on morphology are shown in Fig. 1.4, and those based on molecular data in Fig. 1.5. Although the discrepancies between morphological and molecular-based phylogenies have garnered considerable attention, it is important to note that\n\nthere is substantial agreement between most morphological and molecular-based phylogenies (Archibald, 2003). This consensus underscores the signiﬁcance of the discords that do exist. The two kinds of evidence have been particularly at odds with regard to two conventional orders, Lipotyphla and Artiodactyla, molecular data suggesting that neither is monophyletic. According to molecular analyses, the traditional lipotyphlan families Tenrecidae and Chrysochloridae form a monophyletic group together with Macroscelidea, Tubulidentata, Proboscidea, Sirenia, and Hyracoidea, which has been called Afrotheria. No morphological evidence supporting Afrotheria has been found. Molecular studies also indicate that the order Cetacea is nested within Artiodactyla as the sister group of hippopotamids. These debates are further discussed in the relevant chapters in this volume. Disagreements also exist at the superordinal level, but the anatomical evidence for higher-level groupings is weak. Thus gene sequences support recognition of four main clades of placental mammals: Afrotheria, Xenarthra, Laurasiatheria (eulipotyphlans, bats, carnivores, pangolins, perissodactyls, artiodactyls, and whales), and Euarchontoglires (primates, tree shrews, ﬂying lemurs, rodents, and lagomorphs), the last two of which form the clade Boreoeutheria (e.g., Eizirik et al., 2001; Madsen et al., 2001; Murphy et al., 2001; Scally et al., 2001; Amrine-Madsen et al., 2003; Nikaido et al., 2003; Springer et al., 2003, 2005). Eizirik et al. (2001) concluded that this superordinal divergence occurred during the Late Cretaceous (about 65–104 Ma) and speculated that it was related to the separation of Africa from South America. These studies further suggest that Afrotheria was the ﬁrst clade to diverge, followed by Xenarthra (usually considered the most primitive, based on morphology). However, morphological evidence suggests that most of the afrothere groups are nested within the ungulate radiation and are not closely related to tenrecs and chrysochlorids (see Chapters 13 and 15). This inconsistency implies that either the morphological or molecular data must be misleading. Methodological problems that can lead to erroneous phylogenetic conclusions in molecular analyses have been reviewed by Sanderson and Shaffer (2002) and are not further discussed here. Notwithstanding the substantial contribution molecular systematics has made to our understanding of mammalian relationships, anatomical evidence from fossils plays the predominant role in resolving the phylogenetic positions of extinct taxa and clades for which molecular data are unavailable.\n\nGEOCHRONOLOGY AND BIOCHRONOLOGY OF THE EARLY CENOZOIC The Paleocene and Eocene epochs make up the ﬁrst 31 million years of the Tertiary Period of the Cenozoic Era (from 65 Ma to 34 Ma; Fig. 1.6). The chronology of the Paleocene and Eocene used here (Fig. 1.7) is based primarily on that of Berggren et al. (1995b) and McKenna and Bell\n\nTable 1.2.

(2004). This table and all others presented in this book represent a compromise between traditional and cladistic classiﬁcations and are an attempt to provide a consensus view. Ordinal-level and higher taxa are shown in upper case; unassigned taxa immediately below a higher taxon are either plesiomorphic or of uncertain phylogenetic position within that taxon. Many taxa are probably paraphyletic, but no attempt is made in the tables to differentiate them from those believed to be monophyletic; instead these distinctions are discussed in the text. The dagger (†) denotes extinct taxa. 1\n\nMcKenna and Bell (1997) assigned monotremes to the subclass Prototheria and recognized two orders, Platypoda (platypuses) and Tachyglossa (echidnas). Trechnotheria is essentially equivalent to the concept of Holotheria. 3 Essentially equivalent to Tribosphenida. 4 Several taxa considered grandorders by McKenna and Bell (1997) are considered superorders here. 5 May be basal eutherians. 6 Monophyly of Cimolesta and interrelationships of its constituents are very uncertain. 7 Relationship of Chiroptera to other archontans is in dispute. 8 Monophyly questionable. 9 Monophyly of Zhelestidae and their relationship to ungulates are controversial. 10 May be nested in Artiodactyla. 2\n\n(1997), with modiﬁcations as indicated in the following discussion. Geologic periods and epochs may be subdivided into successive stages/ages (chronostratigraphic and geochronologic units) and, in the case of the Cenozoic epochs, land-mammal ages (a biochronologic unit). Land-mammal ages “describe the age and succession of events in mammalian evolution” based on characteristic mammal assem-\n\nblages, lineage segments, or in some cases ﬁrst or last appearances (Woodburne, 2004: xiv; see also Walsh, 1998, for an insightful discussion of the deﬁnition of land-mammal ages). Although absolute dates have been placed on many of these units using a combination of magnetostratigraphy and radiometric methods, such as high-precision 40Ar/39Ar dating (Berggren et al., 1995b; Gradstein et al., 1995, 2004),\n\nIntroduction\n\n11\n\nFig. 1.4. Relationships of higher taxa of mammals based on morphology. Thicker lines indicate documented geologic ranges. (From Wible et al., 2005, based on Novacek, 1999.)\n\nprecise dating of some intervals remains tenuous and in some cases controversial. Geologic time applies worldwide, whereas land-mammal ages are speciﬁc to each continent and are relatively well constrained geochronologically only in North America and Europe. Nevertheless, their sequence is reasonably well understood, as is the correlation between North American Land-Mammal Ages (NALMAs) and standard stages/ages (more widely used in Europe than land-mammal ages). For this reason, land-mammal ages and their subdivisions (or stages/ages, particularly in Europe) provide a useful framework for placing fossil mammals in relative chronologic\n\ncontext, and they are employed throughout this volume. As we shall see, the precise age and the correlation of Asian and South American Land-Mammal Ages with those of North America and Europe are more controversial. Hundreds of radiometric dates are now available for the Mesozoic, permitting a relatively accurate estimate of the age of the oldest known mammals (Gradstein et al., 1995, 2004). Based on these data, mammals ﬁrst appeared at least 205–210 million years ago, and perhaps as much as 225 million years ago (see Chapter 4). They survived alongside dinosaurs for the ﬁrst 145 million years of their history, up to the K/T boundary at about 65 million years ago, when the last\n\n12\n\nthe beginning of the age of mammals\n\nFig. 1.5. Relationships of higher taxa of mammals based on molecular data. Most higher taxa in these studies are based on only one to ﬁve species. Interrelationships among taxa within Afrotheria are particularly unstable. (Modiﬁed after Murphy et al., 2001, and Springer et al., 2005.)\n\nnonavian dinosaurs became extinct. The K/T boundary, and thus the base of the Paleocene, is situated near the top of geomagnetic polarity chron C29r and has been dated at 65.0 million years ago (Swisher et al., 1992, 1993; Gradstein et al., 1995) or, most recently, 65.5 million years ago (Gradstein et al., 2004).\n\nPaleocene/Eocene Boundary The Paleocene/Eocene boundary is situated in the lower part of polarity chron C24r, but its precise position and age have been contentious. Dates range from about 54.8 (Berggren et al., 1995b) to 55.8 million years ago (Gradstein et al., 2004) in various reports over the past decade or so, most centering around 55.0 million years ago. The debate here, as for the Eocene/Oligocene boundary, stems partly from the difﬁculty of correlating mammal-bearing continental beds with discontiguous marine strata on which much of Cenozoic geochronology is based. As a result, the Paleocene/Eocene boundary has varied relative to the Thanetian/Ypresian Stage/Age boundary in Europe and the Clarkforkian/Wasatchian Land-Mammal Age boundary in North America. For example, different authors have considered the Clarkforkian to be entirely Paleocene, or all or partly of early Eocene age, and the Wasatchian to be entirely Eocene or to have begun during the late Paleocene. In Europe, a stratigraphic gap was found between the Thanetian and the Ypresian, further complicating matters and making precise placement of the boundary uncertain. This dilemma has been largely resolved by the recent decision to place the beginning of the Eocene at the onset of the isochronous, worldwide Carbon Isotope Excursion (CIE), a major perturbation in the global carbon cycle reﬂected by a negative excursion in δ13C (Kennett and Stott, 1991; Dupuis et al., 2003). The ultimate cause of this sudden input of massive amounts of carbon into the atmosphere is controversial (volcanism or comet impact are just two hypotheses; Bralower et al., 1997; Kent et al., 2003), but most authorities agree that it can be traced to the release of methane gas on the ocean ﬂoor (Dickens et al., 1995; Katz\n\net al., 1999; Norris and Röhl, 1999; Svensen et al., 2004). The CIE coincided with a brief period of global warming, the Initial Eocene Thermal Maximum (also called the PaleoceneEocene Thermal Maximum; Sloan and Thomas, 1998; Aubry et al., 2003) and has been recognized in both marine and terrestrial sediments globally. Its onset also coincides with the beginning of the Wasatchian Land-Mammal Age in North America and the beginning of the Ypresian Stage in Europe, which are characterized by substantial faunal turnover, including the abrupt appearance of perissodactyls, artiodactyls, euprimates, and hyaenodontid creodonts. By this convention, the Clarkforkian is entirely of Paleocene age. In northern Europe, cores now ﬁll the former stratigraphic gap and show that the CIE is situated near the base of the “gap,” just above the Thanetian (Steurbaut et al., 2003). Although there is now agreement on exactly where to place the Paleocene/Eocene boundary, controversy persists over its calibration, because no absolute (radiometric) dates are known for this event. Consequently its age has been interpolated based on radiometric dates tied to the geomagnetic polarity time scale, together with data from astronomical cycle stratigraphy. Thus Aubry et al. (2003) dated the start of the CIE at about 55.5 million years ago (but allowed that it could be closer to 55.0 Ma), whereas many other authors place it at 55.0 million years ago (e.g., Bowen et al., 2002; Gingerich, 2003; Koch et al., 2003). However, Röhl et al. (2003: 586) noted that their earlier estimate of 54.98 million years ago (Norris and Röhl, 1999) was “likely to be too young by several 100 k.y.” because of inaccuracies in the calibration points used, which suggests that the estimate by Aubry et al. was closer. The most recent time scale placed the Paleocene/Eocene boundary at 55.8 ± 0.2 million years ago (Gradstein et al., 2004). Aubry et al. (2003) proposed that the name “Sparnacian” be used as a new earliest Eocene stage/age to encompass the time represented by the hiatus between classical Thanetian and Ypresian. The term “Sparnacian” was already applied to early Ypresian faunas by some paleomammalogists (e.g., Savage and Russell, 1983), but the Sparnacian stratotype, as well as some classic Sparnacian assemblages, may not be of\n\nFig. 1.6. Geologic time scale of the Geological Society of America, 1999. The newly adopted time scale of the International Commission on Stratigraphy (Gradstein et al., 2004) differs in relatively minor ways from this one: epoch and age boundaries during the Paleocene and Eocene are shifted up or down by 0.2–1.0 million years. The largest difference is the Paleocene/Eocene boundary, placed at 55.8 Ma by Gradstein et al. (2004). © Geological Society of America 1999.\n\nIntroduction\n\nearly Ypresian age (Hooker, 1998). Consequently, Sparnacian was not accepted in the most recent time scale (Gradstein et al., 2004) and is not used in this volume. It should be remembered that, regardless of the absolute age put on the Paleocene/Eocene boundary, it is coincident with the onset of the CIE.\n\nEocene/Oligocene Boundary The Eocene/Oligocene boundary in Europe was long equated with a major episode of faunal turnover called the “Grande Coupure” (Stehlin, 1909; Savage and Russell, 1983; Russell and Tobien, 1986; Legendre, 1987; Legendre et al., 1991). In North America the Eocene/Oligocene boundary was believed to correspond to the boundary between the Duchesnean and Chadronian Land-Mammal Ages (Wood et al., 1941). With the advent of high-precision 40Ar/39Ar dating and the correlation of the Eocene/Oligocene boundary in the marine record with the extinction of the planktonic foraminiferan family Hantkeninidae (Hooker et al., 2004), the position of the epoch boundary has been revised on both continents. The boundary is now generally placed within magnetochron C13r at a little less than 34 million years ago (Berggren et al., 1992, 1995b; Prothero and Swisher, 1992; Prothero and Emry, 2004). This time coincides with the boundary between the Priabonian and Rupelian stages (see Fig. 1.7). The principal faunal turnover at the Grande Coupure took place between the Priabonian and Rupelian Stages (Paleogene mammal reference levels MP 20–21; see the section on European Land-Mammal Ages, below), although it is now acknowledged that it was a protracted event. It involved extinction of more than 50% of the indigenous fauna, together with an inﬂux of numerous immigrants from Asia. Disagreement persists over how closely the turnover coincided with the Eocene/Oligocene boundary and whether it was caused by climatic cooling or other factors (see Berggren and Prothero, 1992; Hooker, 1992a; and Legendre and Hartenberger, 1992, for contrasting views). However, the epoch boundary, based on the foram extinction noted above, is now known to be slightly older than the major cooling event that correlates with the Grande Coupure; consequently these events are now dated as earliest Oligocene (Hooker et al., 2004). In fact, there were several major phases of faunal turnover in Europe beginning in the middle Eocene and extending into the early Oligocene (Legendre, 1987; Hooker, 1992a; Legendre and Hartenberger, 1992; Franzen, 2003), but none appears to correspond precisely with the Eocene/ Oligocene boundary as now recognized. Nevertheless, this\n\n15\n\nrevision is so new that most recent accounts continue to place the Eocene/Oligocene boundary at the beginning of the Rupelian Age (Paleogene mammal reference level MP 21) at about 34 million years ago. In North America, as a result of the revised Eocene/ Oligocene boundary, the Chadronian, long considered equivalent to early Oligocene, is now situated in the late Eocene. The Orellan Land-Mammal Age is early Oligocene, and the Chadronian/Orellan boundary coincides with the Eocene/Oligocene boundary (Prothero and Emry, 2004).\n\nEuropean Land-Mammal Ages As mentioned earlier, standard ages are more widely used for biochronology of European faunas than are the European Land-Mammal Ages (ELMAs), and are therefore used in this text. This preference for the former may have come about because the ELMAs are for the most part equivalent in time to the standard ages (“Dano-Montian” = Danian; Cernaysian = Selandian and Thanetian; Neustrian = most of the Ypresian; Rhenanian = the rest of the Ypresian through the Bartonian; and Headonian = Priabonian; McKenna and Bell, 1997). For greater resolution than is afforded by the standard ages, faunas are correlated by a series of European reference levels, arranged in sequence by stage of evolution and ﬁrst and last appearances. In the Paleogene they are numbered from Mammal Paleogene (MP) 1 to MP 30 (Schmidt-Kittler, 1987). Levels MP 1–5 are reserved for lower Paleocene faunas, although only one (Hainin, Belgium) is currently known. MP 6 is used for the late Paleocene site of Cernay, France. When late Paleocene mammals become better known in Europe, more levels will surely be necessary. MP 7–10 are early Eocene (Ypresian), MP 11–16 are middle Eocene (MP 11–13 correspond to Lutetian, MP 14–16 to Bartonian), and MP 17–20 are late Eocene (Priabonian; e.g., Legendre and Hartenberger, 1992). If the Grande Coupure actually took place in the earliest Oligocene rather than at the Eocene/Oligocene boundary, as Hooker (1992a) argued, then MP 20 straddles the boundary.\n\nNorth American Land-Mammal Ages The sequence of NALMAs initially proposed by Wood et al. (1941) has been widely applied and provides a useful and well-documented biochronology for mammals of North America. Excellent summaries of the NALMAs and their mammal assemblages are found in the two volumes edited by Woodburne (1987, 2004). The NALMAs of interest in\n\nFig. 1.7. (opposite) Early Cenozoic mammalian geochronology and biochronology. Chart shows the time period emphasized in this book (Paleocene-Eocene), approximate age in millions of years (Ma), and correlation with the geomagnetic polarity time scale (GPTS), standard stage/age (commonly used in Europe), and land-mammal ages in North America (NALMA), Asia (ALMA), and South America (SALMA). White bands in GPTS column are intervals of reversed polarity (r), which precede the normal (n, black) interval of the same number. Hatching and dashed lines in ALMA and SALMA denote uncertain boundaries. The position of the boundary between Arshantan and Irdinmanhan ALMAs is unknown. Upper and (especially) lower limits of the Casamayoran SALMA are uncertain. The long span shown reﬂects this uncertainty, and may overestimate the actual duration of this land-mammal age. (Drafted by W. v. Koenigswald and T. Smith, based on Berggren et al., 1995b; Flynn and Swisher, 1995; McKenna and Bell, 1997; Aubry et al., 2003; Dawson, 2003; Flynn et al., 2003.)\n\n16\n\nthe beginning of the age of mammals\n\nthis volume are those of the Paleocene (Puercan, Torrejonian, Tiffanian, and Clarkforkian) and Eocene (Wasatchian, Bridgerian, Uintan, Duchesnean, and Chadronian). These land-mammal ages have been subdivided into sequential biochrons that are variously based on ﬁrst or last appearances, lineage segments, abundance zones, or assemblage zones. The North American Paleocene-Eocene record is the most nearly continuous in the world, although it is largely concentrated in the region of the Rocky Mountains. In addition to the details discussed in the preceding sections, the following observations and changes concerning the original concepts may be noted. The Paleocene Puercan and Clarkforkian Land Mammal Ages are the shortest ages, about 1 million years each (Lofgren et al., 2004). Of the Paleocene NALMAs, however, only the Puercan is constrained by radiometric dates, whereas the duration of the others, including the Clarkforkian, is estimated (Clarkforkian was considered to be only half a million years long by Woodburne and Swisher, 1995). The current convention of dividing the Paleocene into only early and late portions (e.g., Berggren et al., 1995a; McKenna and Bell, 1997) results in shifting the Torrejonian NALMA, long considered middle Paleocene, into the early Paleocene. This practice is largely responsible for the apparent temporal range extensions of many mammals discussed later in the volume, although in some cases new evidence has actually extended the range stratigraphically lower into sediments of Puercan age. Landmammal age occurrences are speciﬁed in the text where there might be confusion. The Tiffanian and Clarkforkian together make up the late Paleocene and are believed to account for a little more than half of Paleocene time. The beginning of the Wasatchian Land-Mammal Age now coincides with the onset of the global CIE, which is also designated as the beginning of the Eocene. Although the exact date of that event is uncertain (but most likely between 55.0 and 55.8 Ma), several 40Ar/39Ar dates are now known from tuffs and volcanic ashes of latest Wasatchian age in the Bighorn and Greater Green River basins of Wyoming, ranging from about 50.7 to 52.6 million years ago (Wing et al., 1991; M. E. Smith et al., 2003, 2004). The Wasatchian/ Bridgerian boundary appears to be at about 50.6–51.0 million years ago (Smith et al., 2003; Machlus et al., 2004). The Bridgerian, long considered equivalent to the middle Eocene, now straddles the early/middle Eocene boundary; nonetheless, all Bridgerian occurrences were listed as middle Eocene by McKenna and Bell (1997), which could affect some ranges discussed in later chapters. Numerous dates for the Bridgerian range up to slightly younger than 47 million years ago, and the Bridgerian/Uintan boundary is situated in chron C21n at about 46.7 million years ago (Smith et al., 2003). With the shift of the Eocene/Oligocene boundary to the beginning of the Orellan, the Chadronian (formerly early Oligocene) is now late Eocene; and it is 3 million years long, not 5 million, as previously believed. The Uintan and Duchesnean NALMAs (long considered late Eocene in age) are now correlated with middle Eocene. Several 40Ar/39Ar dates on ashes and ignimbrites from Texas and New Mexico indi-\n\ncate that the Duchesnean spanned from 37 to almost 40 million years ago (Prothero, 1996a; Prothero and Lucas, 1996). The Duchesnean/Chadronian boundary is situated near the top of chron C17n.\n\nSouth American Land-Mammal Ages The South American mammalian record is relatively incomplete, with discontinuities between all the Paleogene South American Land-Mammal Ages (SALMAs). Nevertheless, a seemingly stable sequence of Cenozoic SALMAs of presumed age has been in use for decades. In the Paleogene, the following sequence has long been recognized: Riochican (late Paleocene), Casamayoran (early Eocene), Mustersan (middle Eocene), Divisaderan (middle or late Eocene), and Deseadan (early Oligocene; Simpson, 1948; Patterson and Pascual, 1968). Relative ages were assigned mainly by stratigraphic position and stage of evolution, as the faunas are entirely endemic. Over the last 30 years or so, however, magnetostratigraphic studies coupled with radioisotopic dates, together with new fossil discoveries, have forced signiﬁcant revisions in the SALMAs, with particular impact on those of the Paleogene. Three additional Paleocene land-mammal ages or subages are now recognized that precede the classic late Paleocene Riochican: Itaboraian, Peligran, and Tiupampan (see Fig. 1.7). The Tiupampan fauna was initially thought to come from the El Molina Formation of Late Cretaceous age, but it is now known to come from the overlying Santa Lucía Formation of Paleocene age (Marshall et al., 1995). The Itaboraian is presumed to be earlier late Paleocene (but it derives from ﬁssures, which are difﬁcult to date accurately), whereas the Tiupampan and Peligran are considered successive early Paleocene land-mammal ages (e.g., Flynn and Swisher, 1995). The Riochican appears to correlate with late Paleocene marine strata, but radiometric dates indicate only that it is younger than 63 million years. It may correlate approximately with magnetochron C25n. Low-precision radiometric dates conﬁrm Paleocene age for the three underlying ages as well, but their durations and precise placement within the Paleocene are speculative. Recently, for example, Marshall et al. (1997), using magnetostratigraphy, recalibrated the Paleocene SALMAs and considered all four to be of late Paleocene age, about 55.5–60 million years ago. Furthermore, they concluded that the actual sequence is Peligran-Tiupampan-Itaboraian-Riochican. Because the original Riochican section spanned the entire late Paleocene, they considered all four to be subages of a single late Paleocene Riochican Land-Mammal Age. Most researchers, however, have accepted an early Paleocene age for the Tiupampan and consider it to be the oldest Cenozoic SALMA. This consensus is followed in this volume. The Peligran Land-Mammal Age is especially problematic. Thought to correlate approximately with the Torrejonian NALMA, it is founded on a new Argentine “fauna” consisting of a few very fragmentary specimens of ﬁve mammalian species, together with frogs, turtles, and crocodilians\n\nIntroduction\n\n(Bonaparte et al., 1993). The mammal species include the gondwanathere Sudamerica (an enigmatic group whose afﬁnities are very uncertain), the only non-Australian monotreme, and three supposed condylarths, one of which could instead be a dryolestoid. In some respects this assemblage has more of a Mesozoic than Paleocene aspect. Whether this enigmatic fauna proves to be older or younger than Tiupampan, the available fossils are an inadequate basis for establishing a land-mammal age. Recently there has been even greater change in the concepts of the Eocene SALMAs. New 40Ar/39Ar dates on rocks from the later part of the Casamayoran SALMA (Barrancan subage), conventionally considered early Eocene, yielded the surprising result that they could be as young as late Eocene (35.3–37.6 Ma), almost 20 million years younger than previously thought (Kay et al., 1999). This ﬁnding would indicate that the Casamayoran extended much later in time than previously thought and that the Mustersan SALMA is latest Eocene. It also raises the possibility that Riochican could be Eocene, and that there might be an even longer gap in the South American Eocene record than has been acknowledged. But the early Casamayoran fauna (Vacan subage; Cifelli, 1985) is more similar to the Riochican fauna, suggesting that the hiatus is more likely between the Vacan and the Barrancan subages. Flynn et al. (2003) reinterpreted the Casamayoran radioisotopic evidence to indicate a minimum age of 38 million years, and indicated that the lower boundary could be anywhere down to 54 million years ago (see Fig. 1.7), which would equate Casamayoran with most of the early and middle Eocene. This calculation of its duration may be too long, but age constraints are so poor that a more precise estimate is not yet possible. The revised age estimates for the Casamayoran compress the Mustersan and Divisaderan into a short interval at the end of the Eocene. The relative age and even the validity of the Divisaderan are especially tenuous. Finally, highprecision 40Ar/39Ar dates for the recently proposed Tinguirirican SALMA indicate that it either bridges the Eocene/ Oligocene boundary (Flynn and Swisher, 1995) or is of early Oligocene age (Kay et al., 1999). The younger age was upheld by Flynn et al. (2003), who dated the Tinguirirican at 31–32 million years ago but indicated that it might extend back as far as 37.5 million years ago (latest Eocene). Radiometric dates also show that the Deseadan is much younger than long believed, shifting it to late Oligocene (Flynn and Swisher, 1995). Figure 1.7 follows Flynn et al. (2003) for the Eocene SALMAs. Note, however, that most of these revisions are so recent that they were not known at the time of McKenna and Bell’s (1997) compilation, and obviously were unknown to Simpson and other earlier workers. Therefore occurrences and ranges of South American taxa in this text reﬂect the traditional terminology, namely, that Casamayoran was equivalent to early Eocene, Mustersan and Divisaderan to middle Eocene, and Tinguirirican to the Eocene/Oligocene boundary. Wherever possible, the age of fossils is clariﬁed with the SALMA of origin to avoid confusion.\n\n17\n\nAsian Land-Mammal Ages The Asian Land-Mammal Ages (ALMAs) are the most recently named and the most tentative. Several schemes have been proposed over the past two decades or so. The sequence used here follows that of McKenna and Bell (1997), which stems principally from Li and Ting (1983) and Russell and Zhai (1987), although a few of the ages were initially named by Romer (1966). Important modiﬁcations were made by Tong et al. (1995) and Ting (1998). A comparison of these reports reveals that there is still no consensus regarding the appropriate name for some of the ALMAs. With a few exceptions, the Asian land-mammal sequence is poorly constrained geochronologically, and the sequence has been based largely on stage of evolution. Therefore further revisions and reﬁnements are to be expected. There is general agreement that the Shanghuan ALMA is early Paleocene and the Nongshanian ALMA is late Paleocene. Wang et al. (1998), however, suggested that the Nongshanian may overlap with the late early Paleocene, partly based on the ﬁrst K-Ar date (61.63 ± 0.92 Ma) from the Paleocene of China. Ting (1998) resurrected the Gashatan ALMA, named by Romer (1966), for latest Paleocene faunas that appear to be correlative with the Clarkforkian NALMA. Several names have been used for the ﬁrst Eocene landmammal age in Asia, including Ulanbulakian (Romer, 1966) and Lingchan (Li and Ting, 1983; Tong et al., 1995), but Bumbanian, proposed by Russell and Zhai (1987), is now generally accepted. The position of the Paleocene/Eocene boundary relative to the Gashatan and Bumbanian ALMAs has been controversial. However, the discovery that the CIE (and thus the Paleocene/Eocene boundary) is situated between Gashatan and Bumbanian faunas in the Lingcha Formation of China indicates that, at least in that section, Gashatan is entirely late Paleocene and Bumbanian is early Eocene (Bowen et al., 2002). The issue is not fully resolved, however, because it has been suggested that certain other Bumbanian faunas could be older than that of the Lingcha Formation. Eocene ALMAs following the Bumbanian are very poorly constrained. There is general agreement that three ages can be recognized during the middle Eocene—Arshantan, Irdinmanhan, and Sharamurunian—but their boundaries are very uncertain. The Ergilian ALMA was proposed by Russell and Zhai (1987) as the earliest Oligocene ALMA, but it is now correlated with the late Eocene Priabonian and Chadronian. Consequently, the Shandgolian (Russell and Zhai’s middle Oligocene ALMA, equivalent to Ulangochuian of Li and Ting, 1983) is early Oligocene and corresponds to the Rupelian and Orellan Land-Mammal Ages.\n\nPALEOGEOGRAPHIC SETTING DURING THE BEGINNING OF THE AGE OF MAMMALS The evolution and dispersal of mammals during the early Cenozoic were strongly inﬂuenced by the positions of the\n\n18\n\nthe beginning of the age of mammals\n\ncontinental plates, the connections among them, the amount and distribution of subaerial exposure, and the marine barriers separating or dividing continents. The salient aspects of paleogeography at that time summarized here are based primarily on McKenna (1972, 1975b, 1980a, 1983) and Smith et al. (1994). At the end of the Cretaceous, a wide epicontinental sea extended between the Arctic Ocean and the western Atlantic, dividing North America into eastern and western landmasses (Fig. 1.8A). The western portion was joined to Asia across Beringia (site of the present-day Bering Strait), whereas the eastern part was more closely approximated to Greenland, which was close or joined to northwestern Europe. North America and South America were separated by a wide seaway that connected the Paciﬁc and Atlantic oceans. During the Late Cretaceous and early Paleocene, an epeiric sea apparently divided South America into northern and southern faunal provinces, limiting faunal exchange between the two regions (Pascual et al., 1992; Wilson and Arens, 2001). The southern parts of South America and Australia were close to Antarctica but lacked subaerial connections to that continent. South America and Africa were much closer to each other than they are today, though still separated by a sizable marine barrier. A narrow seaway split northwestern Africa from the rest of that continent, and the Tethys Sea (predecessor of the Mediterranean) came between northern Africa and Europe, which consisted of several islands. The Tethys extended eastward, south of Asia, where it was continuous with the Indian Ocean. India had recently separated from Madagascar and begun its drift northward. The rest of Asia was a large landmass separated from Europe by an epicontinental seaway (the Obik Sea to the north and the Turgai Straits at the southern end), which joined the Arctic Ocean to the Tethys Sea. This was the paleogeographic setting at the beginning of the Age of Mammals. Interchange of land mammals between any of the landmasses separated by marine barriers could only have occurred by Simpson’s sweepstakes dispersal (Simpson, 1953; McKenna, 1973). By the end of the early Paleocene a major lowering of sea level was under way, exposing more extensive land areas. North America was now a single landmass, as the epicontinental sea had diminished to a narrow extension from the Caribbean northward to the middle of the continent. Land bridges joined North America to northern Europe and to Asia, allowing faunal exchange. The Eurasian epicontinental sea also receded, exposing land bridges or islands between Europe and western Asia (Iakovleva et al., 2001). India was almost halfway to its junction with Asia. The brief interval of global warming at the beginning of the Eocene (the Initial Eocene Thermal Maximum) resulted in increased continental temperatures as well as surface warming of high-latitude oceans (Sloan and Thomas, 1998). These changes turned the high-latitude North Atlantic land bridge (and, to a lesser extent, the North Paciﬁc Bering bridge) into a hospitable corridor for mammalian dispersal. Geophysical evidence in fact suggests the presence\n\nof two North Atlantic land bridges during the late Paleocene– early Eocene: the northern De Geer Route and the southern Thulean Route (Fig. 1.8B, numbers 2 and 3). The De Geer Route—which was probably farther south in the early Tertiary, near the present-day Arctic Circle—joined northern Scandinavia, Svalbard (including Spitsbergen), northern Greenland, and northern Canada in the region of Ellesmere Island, and could have served as a direct passage between northwestern Europe and the Western Interior of North America. The Thulean bridge would have connected the British Isles to Greenland via the Faeroe Islands and Iceland, a geothermal “hot spot” in the early Cenozoic (Knox, 1998). Although little fossil evidence is known from along these proposed land bridges, Simpson (1947: 633) long ago established that the extent of exchange between Europe and North America indicated that these land masses were “zoogeographically essentially a single region at this time.” About 50–60% of early Eocene mammal genera from northwestern Europe are shared with western North America (Savage, 1971; McKenna, 1975b; Smith, 2000). In contrast, only onethird of earliest Eocene genera were shared by northern and southern Europe, suggesting that the continent was sporadically divided by some kind of barrier during the Paleogene, but whether it was geographic or climatic is unknown (Marandat, 1997). Ellesmere Island, which was within the Arctic Circle and at about the same latitude in the Eocene as it is today, has produced early-to-middle Eocene mammals and reptiles (crocodilians) that indicate a warm climate (Dawson et al., 1976; West et al., 1977; McKenna, 1980a). Several of the mammalian taxa are similar at the generic or family level to those found on both continents and suggest dispersal across Ellesmere in both directions (Eberle and McKenna, 2002). The effect of highly variable periods of daylight (and seasonal darkness) on the biota at such high latitudes remains problematic. By the middle Eocene (Lutetian), faunal disparities indicate that the opening of the North Atlantic by sea ﬂoor spreading had already interrupted the Euramerican land bridges. The Bering land bridge (Beringia, Fig. 1.8B, number 1) seems to have been emergent throughout most of the Cenozoic (Marincovich and Gladenkov, 1999). However, it was evidently at even higher latitude (about 75° N) during the late Paleocene and early Eocene than it is today and consequently may have acted as a ﬁlter rather than a corridor (McKenna, 2003). Nonetheless, similar taxa found on both continents at that time (e.g., arctostylopids, uintatheres, carpolestids, omomyids), many of which are unknown from Europe, indicate faunal exchange. A more southern bridge across the Aleutian area may have existed as well, but probably not before the middle Eocene (McKenna, 1983). Europe continued to be separated from Asia for part of the early Cenozoic by a marine barrier consisting of the Obik Sea and, at the southern end, the Turgai Strait. Current evidence suggests, however, that occasional subaerial connections may have been present at the northern and southern ends (Fig. 1.8B, numbers 4 and 5), particularly around the Paleocene/Eocene boundary (Iakovleva et al.,\n\nIntroduction\n\n19\n\nFig. 1.8. (A) Paleogeography during the Late Cretaceous (Maastrichtian), about 70 million years ago. Shaded regions represent subaerial landmasses; white areas are oceans; lines show present-day coastlines. (B) Paleogeography during the early Eocene, about 53 million years ago. Numbered arrows indicate hypothesized dispersal routes during the Early Paleogene: 1, between Asia and North America via Bering land bridge; 2, De Geer route; 3, Thulean route; 4, between Asia and Europe at the northern end of the Obik Sea; 5, across the Turgai Strait; 6, probable sweepstakes dispersal between North and South America via Central America or perhaps a Caribbean archipelago; 7, between southern Europe and north Africa; 8, between South America and Antarctica; 9, between Antarctica and Australia. Some routes shown as marine barriers in this reconstruction might have been intermittently subaerial during the Early Cenozoic. (Modiﬁed from Smith et al., 1994.)\n\n2001). A marine recession at the Eocene/Oligocene boundary ﬁnally exposed signiﬁcant land bridges across the former seaway, allowing the immigrations from Asia that characterized the Grande Coupure. It is now generally thought that the Indian Plate began to collide with Asia in the late Paleocene. Beck et al. (1998) even hypothesized that this collision could have precipitated\n\nthe CIE (by triggering the release of organic carbon from the northern continental shelf of India) and the concomitant climatic and biotic changes that took place at the Paleocene/ Eocene boundary. Fossil evidence regarding the time of collision is equivocal. Frogs and crocodilians of Laurasian afﬁnity and the mammal Deccanolestes (see Chapter 10) have been cited as evidence of limited contact with Asia as early\n\n20\n\nthe beginning of the age of mammals\n\nas the Late Cretaceous (e.g., Jaeger et al., 1989; Sahni and Bajpai, 1991; Prasad et al., 1994), but other records (ﬁshes, turtles, and dinosaurs) imply that some animals dispersed from Madagascar or Africa to India in the Late Cretaceous (about 80 Ma; Sahni, 1984). South America was isolated from other continents through much of the Cenozoic, and most of its endemic early Cenozoic mammal fauna seems to be derived from at least two sweepstakes dispersal events, an earlier one (no later than early Paleocene) from North America, and a later event (late Eocene) from Africa. Close proximity or a possible land connection between Patagonia and the Antarctic Peninsula is implied by the discovery in Antarctica (Seymour Island) of a small number of typically Patagonian taxa. The late middle Eocene age of the assemblage (Bartonian, or in the gap between the early and late Casamayoran) suggests that these were relict taxa that were isolated from the early Paleogene Patagonian fauna (Reguero et al., 2002). Nevertheless, the presence in Antarctica of marsupials believed to lie near the base of the Australian radiation supports the hypothesis that therian mammals reached Australia through Antarctica by the early Eocene, and probably before then (Woodburne and Case, 1996). Known Early Cenozoic faunas from Africa are largely conﬁned to a few areas of the northern Sahara, with an important exception from the middle Eocene of Tanzania (see Chapter 10). Although many groups appear to be endemic, there are hints of afﬁnities with European faunas, which might have dispersed between present-day Spain and Morocco.\n\nPALEOCENE-EOCENE CLIMATE AND FLORA The world of the Paleocene and Eocene was very different from that of today. It was much warmer and more equable during most of that interval than at any other time during the Cenozoic (Wing and Greenwood, 1993). Temperatures varied little seasonally or latitudinally, mid-latitudes were largely frost-free, and there were no polar ice caps. Conditions were generally wet or humid. A paleotemperature curve reconstructed from deep-sea oxygen isotope records (Zachos et al., 2001) shows that early Paleocene temperatures continued as high as, or higher than, those at the end of the Cretaceous. Following a slight decline at the start of the late Paleocene (59–61 Ma), ocean temperatures increased steadily through the rest of the late Paleocene and the early Eocene (52–59 Ma) and peaked in the late early Eocene, about 50–52 million years ago (the Early Eocene Climatic Optimum, the warmest interval of the past 65 My). Thereafter, temperatures deteriorated more or less continuously to the end of the Eocene, when an abrupt, substantially cooler interval corresponded approximately with the Eocene/ Oligocene boundary (or more accurately, the earliest Oligocene). This interval also corresponds with the appearance of permanent ice sheets in Antarctica for the ﬁrst time in the Cenozoic, and possibly Northern Hemisphere glaciation as\n\nwell (e.g., Coxall et al., 2005). Antarctic glaciation probably resulted in part from changes in ocean circulation following the isolation of Antarctica. The only signiﬁcant interruption in these overall trends was the Initial Eocene Thermal Maximum, the short-term global warming alluded to earlier, which further raised temperatures for about 100,000 years at the beginning of the Eocene (Sloan and Thomas, 1998). A few other episodes of elevated temperature during the early Eocene have been identiﬁed recently, but they are of lesser magnitude (e.g., Lourens et al., 2005). The relatively high temperatures of the Paleocene and Eocene have led to the characterization of this interval as a “greenhouse,” compared to the “ice house” of the post-Eocene. Deep ocean temperatures during the Paleocene and early Eocene, deduced from oxygen isotope ratios in benthic foraminifera, ranged from 8 to 12° C (Zachos et al., 2001). Continental temperatures have been estimated from the proportion of leaves with entire (untoothed) margins, which has been shown to be higher in warmer climates (Wolfe, 1979; Wilf, 1997), from multivariate analysis of leaf physiognomy (Wolfe, 1993, 1994), and from oxygen isotope composition analyzed from paleosols and fossil teeth (Fricke et al., 1998; Koch et al., 2003). Although estimates based on these different methods do not always agree, the overall pattern is consistent. For western North America, leaf-margin analysis (supported by oxygen isotope data from foraminifera) d"
