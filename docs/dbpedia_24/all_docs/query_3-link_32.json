        "meta_description": "The earliest mammaliaforms are difficult to assess because the fossil record is poor and because their distinctive morphologies cannot be directly compared with more recent mammaliaforms. This is especially true for the haramiyid genus Theroteinus, only known in the Saint-Nicolas-de-Port locality (Rhaetian, France). This study presents a new definition of the type-species Theroteinus nikolai. A new species Theroteinus rosieriensis, sp. nov., is named and distinguished by the lingual shift of distal cusps, a larger size, and a stockier occlusal outline. Comparisons with Eleutherodon, Megaconus and Millsodon suggest that Theroteinus has potential close relatives among the Jurassic haramiyids.",

        "text": "Lower molariforms\n\nThe crown is dominated by two longitudinal rows of cusps which delimit a central basin, the lingual row a and the labial row b. The central basin is confined mesially by the saddle which joins cusps a1 and b2, and distally by the u-ridge which joins rows a and b. The central basin gets deeper and narrower from the mesial extremity to the distal extremity.\n\nCusp row a includes two cusps. Cusp a1 is the largest one of the teeth and rises vertically in lateral view. This cusp extends over the mesial half of the tooth. Cusp a1 shows a weak mesial carina which splits into two segments. One segment runs mesially and the other bends labially to join cusp b1. At the level of the base of cusp b1, the mesial segment turns into a short, horizontal cingulum to join cusp b1. A distal crest starts from the distolabial side of the apex of cusp a1 to join cusp a2. This crest is straight in lateral view, but it is curved labially in occlusal view. A sulcus underlines the lingual side of this crest and descends to the base of cusp a1. A second crest, straight in occlusal and lateral views, starts from the labial side of the apex of cusp a1 to the base, where it takes part in the saddle. The distal and labial crests delimit a concave, narrow surface on the distolabial flank of cusp a1, which extends from the apex to the central basin. Cusp a2 is twice lower and labiolingually narrower, and much mesiodistally shorter than cusp a1. Cusp a2 is more lingual than cusp a1. The lingual flanks of cusps a1 and a2 are aligned and parallel to the mesiodistal axis of the tooth on MNHN.F.SNP 61 W, but deviate distolabially on MNHN.F.SNP 366 W, and MNHN.F.SNP 787. The occlusal outline of cusp a2 is semicircular with a convex, lingual side and nearly flat, labial side. The labial side shows a vertical, weak ridge in the middle. In distal view, the slope of the labial flank is more vertical than the slope of the lingual flank. The latter is slightly convex. In labial view, the mesial base of cusp a2 is higher than the distal base of the cusp. In lingual view, the bases of cusps a1 and a2 are at the same level. Cusp a2 shows two crests, respectively mesial and distal, straight in lateral and occlusal views, and aligned mesiodistally. The first crest starts from the mesiolabial side of the apex to join the distolingual crest of cusp a1. The second crest starts from the distolabial side of the apex to the extremity of row a. The distal crest is much longer than the mesial crest. The slope of the mesial crest of cusp a2 is weaker than the slope of the distal crest of cusp a1 and the slope of the distal crest of cusp a2. The slope of the latter is more vertical than the slope of distal crest of cusp a1.\n\nCusp row b includes four cusps, less distinguished from each other than the cusps of row a. Cusp b1 is the most mesial of the tooth. This cusp is subequal in size with cusp b4, or larger in MNHN.F.SNP 61 W. Cusp b1 is located in front of the saddle, but tends to rise lingually to join the mesiolabial carina of cusp a1. Cusp b2 is the largest cusps of row b. This cusp is slightly smaller than cusp a1, except in MNHN.F.SNP 366 W where cusp b2 is slightly larger and higher than cusp a1. Cusp b2 is labial to cusp a1, its base extends as mesially but much less distally, and its apex is slightly more distal, or much more distal in MNHN.F.SNP 61 W. Cusp b2 shows two crests, straight in occlusal and lateral views. The first crest runs labially, but mesiolabially in MNHN.F.SNP 61 W, to take part in the saddle. The second crest runs distally and joins cusp b3. Both crests define on the one side a slightly convex, distolingual occlusal outline, and on the other side a large arc of a circle. Cusp b3 is much smaller than cusps a1, a2, and b2 and slightly smaller than cusps b1 and b4. Cusp b3 is directly distal to cusp b2, except in MNHN.F.SNP 787 where it is slightly more labial. This cusp is more mesial than a1–a2 notch in MNHN.F.SNP 787, aligned with a1–a2 notch in MNHN.F.SNP 366 W, and more distal than a1–a2 notch in MNHN.F.SNP 61 W. The apex of cusp b3 is slightly higher than the apex of cusp a2, or at the same level in MNHN.F.SNP 61 W. The long axis of cusp b3 slightly deviates distolingually from the mesiodistal axis of the tooth, except in MNHN.F.SNP 787 where both axes are parallel. Cusp b4 is distal to cusp b3 and slightly more lingual. Consequently, the long axes of both cusps are aligned, except in MNHN.F.SNP 787. The apex of cusp b4 takes place slightly lower than the apex of cusp a2 and faces the distal crest of cusp a2. Cusp b4 shows a lingual carina, which is well developed in MNHN.F.SNP 787. The u-ridge is a low crest which extends row b and bends lingually to join the extremity of row a.\n\nComments on MNHN.F.SNP 266 W and MNHN.F.SNP 497 W\n\nMNHN.F.SNP 266 W and MNHN.F.SNP 497 W are difficult to describe because they are extensively damaged. The surface of MNHN.F.SNP 266 W is not well preserved (Fig. 1C) and MNHN.F.SNP 497 W is heavily worn. For these reasons, they have not been incorporated in the description above. About MNHN.F.SNP 497 W, it may be noticed that row b is less developed than in other specimens, with a strong reduction of cusp b4 (Figs. 2C and 3D). In the absence of clear morphological characters, both specimens are referred to Theroteinus nikolai following morphometry (see Comparisons. Identification of Theroteinus species below).\n\nUpper molariforms\n\nThe crown is dominated by three longitudinal rows of cusps: labial row A, central row B and lingual row BB. Rows A and B define a labial basin delimited distally by the saddle, constituted only by the lingual crest of cusp A2, and mesially by the u-ridge which joins rows A and B. Rows B and BB define a lingual basin, smaller than the labial basin, delimited distally by the meeting of cusps B2 and BB1, and mesially by the crest which joins rows B and BB. Both basins get deeper and larger mesially.\n\nRow A includes three mesiodistally aligned cusps. The three cusps take place at the same level on the crown. Cusps A1 and A3 are subequal in length and width, cusp A1 is slightly higher than cusp A3. Cusp A2 is twice mesiodistally longer and higher, and labiolingually much wider than cusps A1 and A3. The occlusal outlines of cusps A1 and A3 show a semicircular, labial flank and a relatively flat, lingual flank, sometimes concave because of wear. Cusp A1 shows two crests, straight in occlusal and lateral views. The longest crest runs distolingually from the apex to cusp B1. The other crest runs mesially to cusp A2. The slopes of these crests are subequal. Cusp A3 shows two crests, straight in occlusal and lateral views. The longest crest runs mesiolingually from the apex to take part in the u-ridge. The other crest runs distally to cusp A2. The slopes of these crests are subequal. Cusp A2 shows three crests, straight in occlusal and lateral views. The first crest runs distally to cusp A1. The second crest runs mesially to cusp A3. The third crest runs lingually but does not join another structure. The distal crest is the shortest and shows the strongest slope. The lingual crest is much wider than both other crests. The lingual and mesial crests define a flat surface on the mesiolingual flank of cusp A2. A1–A2 and A2–A3 notches are equal in depth, but A1–A2 notch takes place higher than A2–A3 notch.\n\nA small, supplementary cusp takes place under the labial flank of cusp A3.\n\nRow B includes five cusps. Cusp B1 looks like a distally curved semicircle. This cusp is slightly smaller in length and width than cusp A1, but much smaller in height. Cusp B1 is more distal and more lingual than cusp A1 and is mesiodistally aligned with the saddle. Cusp B2 is slightly smaller than cusp A2. Cusp B2 is much more lingual than cusp B1 and is labiolingually aligned with the A1–A2 notch. This cusp is cone-shaped and does not show any crest. Three small cuspules take place at the base of the mesiolingual flank of cusp B2. Cusp B3 is directly mesial to cusp B2. The apex of cusp B3 is slightly more labial the apex of cusp B2 and slightly more mesial than apex of cusp A2. Cusp B3 is subequal in size with cusp B1 and take place slightly lower than cusp B2. Cusp B4 is directly mesial to cusp B3. This cusp is smaller in all dimensions and takes place lower than cusp B3. Cusp B4 is labiolingually aligned with A2–A3 notch. Cusp B5 is the most mesial cusp of the tooth. This cusp is smaller in all dimensions, takes place lower, and is slightly more labial than cusp B4. The mesial extremity of cusp B5 shows two crests. One crest runs labially to take part in the u-ridge of the labial basin. The other crest runs lingually to mesially close the lingual basin.\n\nRow BB includes two cusps. Cusp BB1 is sub-equal in size to cusp B4 and takes place at the same level. Cusp BB1 is placed right next to cusps B2 and B3, directly lingual to the B2–B3 notch. Cusp BB2 is mesial to cusp BB1 but slightly more lingual. This cusp is subequal in length and width with cusp B5, but slightly higher. A cusp BB3 was possibly present, but this part of the crown is broken. Row BB is extended by a crest which runs mesially and then bends labially to close the lingual basin.\n\nComments on MNHN.F.SNP 722\n\nOnly the distal part of MNHN.F.SNP 722 is preserved, with cusps A1, B1, B2, BB1, and a part of cusps A2 and B3 (Fig. 1B). Since morphometry is not applicable, this specimen is referred to Theroteinus nikolai following the position of cusp B2 in relation to cusps B3 and BB1. However, some doubts remain because cusp B3 is fragmentary. MNHN.F.SNP 722 differs from MNHN.F.SNP 78 W by a smaller cusp A1 and presence of only one cuspule at the base of the mesiolingual flank of cusp B2.\n\nLower molariforms\n\nThe crown is dominated by two longitudinal rows of cusps which delimit a central basin, the lingual row a and the labial row b. The central basin is confined mesially by the saddle which joins cusps a1 and b2 and distally by the u-ridge which joins rows a and b. The saddle is very high compared with the u-ridge, except in MNHN.F.SNP 309 W where the difference is weaker. The central basin gets deeper and narrower from the mesial extremity to the distal extremity.\n\nRow a includes two cusps. Cusp a1 is the largest cusp of the tooth and rises vertically in lateral view. This cusp extends over the mesial half of the tooth, even more in MNHN.F.SNP 487 W, RBINS.RAS 74 FW, and RBINS.RAS 77 FW. Cusp a1 shows a weak mesial carina which splits into two segments. One segment runs mesially and the other bends labially to join Cusp b1. At the level of the base of cusp b1, the mesial segment turns into a short, horizontal cingulum to join cusp b1. A distal crest starts from the distolabial side of the apex of cusp a1 to join cusp a2. This crest is straight in lateral view, but it is curved labially in occlusal view, except in MNHN.F.SNP 487 W, RBINS.RAS 62 FW, and RBINS.RAS 74 FW where it is straight in both views. A sulcus underlines the lingual side of this crest and descends to the base of cusp a1, absent in MNHN.F.SNP 487 W and RBINS.RAS 74 FW. A second crest, straight in occlusal and lateral views, starts from the labial side of the apex of cusp a1 to the base, where it takes part in the saddle. The distal and labial crests delimit a concave, narrow surface on the distolabial flank of cusp a1, which extends from the apex to the central basin. Cusp a2 is half as cusp a1 in height, labiolingual width, and mesiodistal length, even less in RBINS.RAS 74 FW. Cusp a2 is more lingual than cusp a1. The lingual flanks of cusps a1 and a2 are aligned and deviate distolabially from the mesiodistal axis of the tooth. The occlusal outline of cusp a2 is semicircular with a convex, lingual side and nearly flat, labial side, except in MNHN.F.SNP 487 W because of wear. In distal view, the slopes of the labial and lingual flanks are subequal. The latter is slightly convex. In labial view, the mesial base of cusp a2 is higher than the distal base of the cusp. In lingual view, the bases of cusps a1 and a2 are at the same level. Cusp a2 shows two crests, respectively mesial and distal, straight in lateral and occlusal views, and aligned mesiodistally. The first crest starts from the mesiolabial side of the apex to join the distolingual crest of cusp a1. The second crest starts from the distolabial side of the apex to the extremity of row a. The distal crest is much longer than the mesial crest. The slope of the mesial crest of cusp a2 is weaker than the slope of the distal crest of cusp a1 and the slope of the distal crest of cusp a2. The slope of the latter is more vertical than the slope of the distal crest of cusp a1. These crests are not preserved in MNHN.F.SNP 487 W and RBINS.RAS 74 FW.\n\nRow b includes four cusps, less distinguished from each other than the cusps of row a. Cusp b1 is the most mesial of the tooth. This cusp is subequal in high and mesiodistal length with cusp a2 but wider and more voluminous. Cusp b1 is located in front of the saddle, but tends to rise lingually to join the mesiolabial carina of cusp a1. Cusp b2 is the largest cusps of row b. This cusp is slightly smaller than cusp a1, except in MNHN.F.SNP 309 W and RBINS.RAS 62 FW where it is much smaller but still larger than other cusps. Cusp b2 is labial to cusp a1, its base extends less mesially and distally, and its apex is slightly more distal, or much more distal in MNHN.F.SNP 309 W. Cusp b2 shows two crests, straight in occlusal and lateral views. The first crest runs labially to take part in the saddle. The second crest runs distally and joins cusp b3. Both crests define on the one side a slightly convex, distolingual occlusal outline, and on the other side a large arc of a circle. This part of the crown has been removed by wear in MNHN.F.SNP 487 W. Cusp b3 is much smaller than cusps a1, a2, b1, and b2 and slightly smaller than cusp b4. Cusp b3 is distal and slightly lingual to cusp b2. This cusp is labiolingually aligned with the a1–a2 notch. The base of cusp b3 is slightly lower than the base of cusp a2. The long axis of cusp b3 deviates slightly distolingually from the mesiodistal axis of the tooth. This part of the crown has been removed by wear in RBINS.RAS 74 FW and RBINS.RAS 77 FW. Cusp b4 is distal to cusp b3 and slightly more lingual. Cusp b4 is mesiodistally aligned with the saddle and labiolingually aligned with the distal crest of cusp a2. The base of cusp b4 is slightly lower than the base of cusp b3. In MNHN.F.SNP 487 W, RBINS.RAS 62 FW, and RBINS.RAS 77 FW, a low crest extends row b and bends lingually to join the extremity of row a. In MNHN.F.SNP 309 W and RBINS.RAS 74 FW, this crest splits into two segments. The first segment bends lingually to join the extremity of row a. The second segment bends labially and runs down the side of the crown and turns into a thin bulge which extends into the base of cusp b2.\n\nComments on RBINS.RAS 800\n\nThe occlusal surface of RBINS.RAS 800 is not well preserved. As a consequence, the cusps are difficult to describe. For these reasons, this specimen has not been included in the description above. In the absence of clear morphological characters, this specimen is referred to Theroteinus rosieriensis following morphometry (see Comparisons. Identification of Theroteinus species below).\n\nUpper molariforms\n\nThe crown is dominated by three longitudinal rows of cusps: labial row A, central row B and lingual row BB. Rows A and B define a labial basin delimited distally by the saddle, constituted only by the lingual crest of cusp A2, and mesially by the u-ridge which joins rows A and B. Rows B and BB define a lingual basin, smaller than the labial basin, delimited distally by the meeting of cusps B2 and BB1, and mesially by the crest which joins rows B and BB. Both basins get deeper and larger mesially. The lingual basin is very shallow in MNHN.F.SNP 335 W.\n\nRow A includes three cusps. In MNHN.F.SNP 335 W, cusp A3 is slightly more labial than cusps A1 and A2. In MNHN.F.SNP 2 Ma, cusp A1 is more lingual than cusp A2 and cusp A3 is more labial than cusp A2. The three cusps are located at the same level on the crown. Cusps A1 and A3 are subequal in height and width, cusps A1 is slightly longer than cusp A3. Cusp A2 is twice mesiodistally longer and higher, and much labiolingually wider than cusps A1 and A3. In MNHN.F.SNP 2 Ma, cusps A1 and A3 are less wide than cusp A2. In occlusal view, cusps A1 and A3 show a semicircular labial flank and a relatively flat, lingual flank. Cusp A1 shows two crests, straight in occlusal and lateral views. The longest crest runs distolingually from the apex to cusp B1. The other crest runs mesially to cusp A2. In MNHN.F.SNP 2 Ma, the mesial crest is present but cusp A1 shows a flat side in front of cusp B1. Cusp A3 shows two crests, straight in occlusal and lateral views. The longest crest runs mesiolingually from the apex to take part in the u-ridge. The other crest runs distally to cusp A2. The slope of the distal crest is more vertical than the slope of the mesial crest. Cusp A2 shows three crests, straight in occlusal and lateral views. The first crest runs distally to cusp A1. The second crest runs mesially to cusp A3. The third crest runs lingually but does not join another structure. The distal crest is the shortest, and the slopes of the three crests are subequal. The lingual crest is much wider than both other crests. The lingual and mesial crests define a concave surface on the mesiolingual flank of cusp A2. A1–A2 notch is less deep and takes place higher than A2–A3 notch.\n\nRow B includes four cusps. Cusp B1 is subequal in size with cusp A1 in MNHN.F.SNP 2 Ma, but smaller in MNHN.F.SNP 335 W. Cusp B1 is more distal and more lingual than cusp A1 and is mesiodistally aligned with the saddle. Cusp B2 is slightly smaller than cusp A2. Cusp B2 is much more lingual than cusp B1 and is labiolingually aligned with the A1–A2 notch. This cusp is cone-shaped and does not show any crest. One small cuspule takes place at the base of the mesiolingual flank of cusp B2. B2–B3 notch is labiolingually aligned with cusp A2. Cusp B3 is more labial than cusp B2 and slightly more lingual than cusp B1 (MNHN.F.SNP 2 Ma) or mesiodistally aligned to cusp B1 (MNHN.F.SNP 335 W). Cusp B3 is much smaller than cusps A2 and B2 and slightly larger than cusps A1, A3, and B1 (MNHN.F.SNP 2 Ma) or subequal with cusps A1 and A3 (MNHN.F.SNP 335 W). In MNHN.F.SNP 2 Ma, cusp B3 is wider than long. Cusp B3 takes place slightly lower than cusp B2. B3–B4 notch is labiolingually aligned with the A2–A3 notch. Cusp B4 is directly mesial to cusp B3. This cusp is smaller in all dimensions and located lower than cusp B3. In MNHN.F.SNP 335 W, a cusp B5 was potentially present but is now removed by wear. The mesial extremity of row B shows two crests. One crest runs labially to take part in the u-ridge of the labial basin. The other crest runs lingually and closes the lingual basin at the mesial side.\n\nRow BB includes three cusps in MNHN.F.SNP 2 Ma. In MNHN.F.SNP 335 W, the cusps cannot be described because of the wear. Cusp BB1 is sub-equal in size to cusp B4 and takes place at the same level. Cusp BB1 is placed right next to cusps B2 and B3, slightly more mesial than the B2–B3 notch. Cusp BB2 is mesial to cusp BB1 but slightly more lingual. This cusp is smaller and takes place lower than cusp BB1. Cusp BB3 is the mesialmost of the tooth. This cusp is mesiodistally aligned with cusp BB1. A crest extends row BB and runs labially to mesially close the lingual basin.\n\nComments on MNHN.F.SNP 14 FW\n\nOnly the distal part of MNHN.F.SNP 14 FW is preserved, with cusps A1, B1, B2, BB1, and a part of cusps A2 and B3. Since morphometry is not applicable, this specimen is referred to Theroteinus rosieriensis following the position of cusp B2 in relation to cusps B3 and BB1. MNHN.F.SNP 14 FW differs from other teeth described above by a less developed cusp A1 and more developed cusp B3.\n\nMorphology\n\nIn upper molariforms, two sets can be defined by the position of cusp B2 which is either mesiodistally aligned with cusps B3 and B4, or lingually shifted to face the lingual basin. In lower molariforms, two sets can be defined by the position of cusp b4 which is either aligned with row b, or lingually shifted to face the saddle. Both of these variations are related together, because of the occlusal pattern. Indeed, cusp B2 occludes lingually to cusp b4, consequently the latter cannot be shifted lingually if the former is not shifted either. Table 4 presents other morphological differences between sets defined above. However, in the current stage of knowledge, it is difficult to say if these differences are related to taxonomic, ontogenetic or individual variations.\n\nEvaluating if observed differences are individual, populational, ontogenetic, sexual, or systematic variation is a hard question; especially with haramiyids for which these different variations, except systematic, are terra incognita for now. Such a question will be addressed when an adequate material is discovered. In this framework, it is more careful and parsimonious for the taxonomy to consider the most important observed differences as systematic variations, as do other studies (e.g., Bi et al., 2014).\n\nThe sets defined by morphological and morphometric characters perfectly match. The lower and upper molariforms are associated following characters presented above and the two sets are considered as two species of the genus Theroteinus. The set including MNHN.F.SNP 78 W (defined as holotype by Sigogneau-Russell, Frank & Hemmerlé, 1986) is identified as Theroteinus nikolai and the second set is identified as Theroteinus rosieriensis sp. nov. Since the new hypodigm of T. nikolai includes all specimens referred to Theroteinus sp. described by Hahn, Sigogneau-Russell & Wouters (1989), they are attributed to Theroteinus nikolai."
