        "text": "Description\n\nThe holotype of Yubaatar zhongyuanensis shows the diagnostic craniodental features of multituberculates, such as cheek teeth with multiple cusp rows, molar cusps subequal in height and arranged in at least two longitudinal rows, M2 positioned one cusp row lingual relative to M1, a single pair of enlarged lower incisors, ultimate lower premolar with serrated dorsal margin and oblique fine ridges on its lingual surfaces, low and wide skull with the jugal on the medial side of the zygomatic arch ( and ). Yubaatar zhongyuanensis differs from tritylodontids30 in having only two upper and lower molars that have pyramidal cusps and in lacking the postdentary trough, thus the postdentary bones, on the medial side of the dentary. It differs from non-allotherian mammaliaforms in having only two upper and lower molars with at least two rows of multiple cusps. It differs from “haramiyidan” allotherians31,32,33,34,35,36 in having molar cusps of nearly equal heights and M2 displaced one cusp row lingual relative to M1.\n\nThe Late Cretaceous Yubaatar is unquestionably a member of Cimolodonta that contain some Early Cretaceous (Aptian-Albian) and all Late Cretaceous and Paleogene multituberculates1,2,6. Yubaatar possesses the common cimolodont dental formula: 2.0.1-4.2/1.0.1-2.2. Its p4 is arcuate (plesiomorphic) with weak oblique enamel ridges (shared with Arginbaataridae), rather than being rectangular as in ‘Plagiaulacida’. Among cimolodontans Yubaatar is similar to several advanced taxa in having only one lower premolar, such as some microcosmodontids (Acheronodon, Pentacosmodon), eucosmodontids (Stygimys, Eucosmodon), taeniolabidoideans (Catopsalis, Taeniolabis, Lambdopsalis, Sphenopsalis and Prionesus), Buginbaatar and Kogaionidae (Barbatodon)1,2,6,37,38.\n\nCranial morphology — The rostrum of the skull is crashed and the premaxilla and upper incisors are not preserved, but it is still discernible that the rostrum was broad and probably short in relation to the mandible ( and ). In ventral view ( ), the palatal process of the maxilla is broken, but the preserved portion of the palate shows that a pair of large palatal vacuities is present. The alisphenoid forms the lateral wall of the lateral pterygopalatine trough within the choana that has the anterior border levels with the M1-M2 junction. Posteriorly, the alisphenoid extends to the ear region, but the suture delimiting its posterior end is unclear. The zygomatic process of the squamosal anterior to the glenoid fossa is strong and subequal in length to the zygomatic process of the maxilla. The glenoid fossa is slightly concave. The exoccipital and basioccipital appear fused. The axial portion of the basioccipital is rectangular and slightly convex. The occipital condyles have well defined and convex articular facets and are separated by a narrow odontoid notch. In the ear region, the most conspicuous feature is the promontorium of the petrosal. The surface of the promontorium is irregular and bulged ventrally into a blunt ridge that extends anteromedially. This bony ridge may serve as the supporting site for the medial sides of the malleus and ectotympanic. There is no sign of any groove for either the internal carotid or stapedial artery on the ventral surface of the promontorium. Two apertures, the fenestra vestibuli and the perilymphatic foramen, separated by a narrow crista interfenestralis, characterize the posterior end of the promontorium.\n\nIn dorsal view ( ), the nasal is large and forms most of the roof of the nasal cavity; it has an extensive contact with the maxilla laterally and the frontal posteriorly, and bears 4-5 vascular foramina. The lacrimal occupies the anteromedial corner of the orbit and has a narrow exposure on the skull roof. The anterior portion of the frontal is broad, with its lateral wing forming the dorsomedial rim of the orbit. Anteriorly, the frontals form a bilobed square-shaped process that inserts between the nasals. The frontal narrows posteriorly into a triangular process that wedges between the parietals. The facial and zygomatic processes of the maxilla are large. The facial process occupies the preorbital region lateral to the nasal and contributes to the anterior rim of the orbit. The single infraorbital foramen opens on the rostrum within the maxilla at the level of P4. The zygomatic process of the maxilla is strong; it tapers posteriorly and is overlapped by the long zygomatic process of the squamosal. On the medial side of the conjunction between the maxilla and squamosal there is the plate-like jugal. The parietal is extensive and roofs most of the cranial cavity. Anteriorly, the parietals contact the frontals in a broad V-shaped suture. The anterior portion of the parietal extends to the orbit and forms a blunt postorbital process that has a rough surface and defines the posterior rim of the small orbit. Posteriorly, the parietals form the medial portion of the nuchal crest. In lateral view, the most prominent feature of the petrosal is a large anterior lamina that contacts the parietal dorsally, the frontal, orbitosphenoid, and the alisphenoid anteriorly, and the squamosal posteriorly. The dorsal flange of the squamosal is extensive and sutures with the anterior lamina of the petrosal anteromedially, the parietal medially, and the dorsal exposure of the petrosal posteriorly.\n\nMandible — The mandible is 56.6 mm long, measured from the mesial edge of the incisor alveolus to the distal end of the mandibular condyle ( ). The depth of the mandible is 13.1 mm on the labial side at the mesial part of m1. The horizontal ramus is robust and the ascending ramus is proportionally small. The diastema between the incisor and p4 measures 9.6 mm, about 19% of the total mandibular length. The masseteric fossa is gently concave, with the deepest area below the coronoid process, and extends mesially to the mid-length of m1. The coronoid process is distolabial to m2, with its mesial base placed below the alveolar margin of m2. The mandibular condyle does not have a neck and extends above the occlusal surface of the molars. The mandibular foramen lies below the distal part of m2 and opens into a concave area that continues distally to the deep pterygoid fossa.\n\nUpper dentition — From the worn P1 to the erupting P4, it appears that the premolar eruption occurred in a mesiodistal sequence ( a and b). All premolars have two roots and smooth enamel. The crown of left P1 is damaged and that of the right one is deeply worn, but it is clear that P1 crown is significantly longer than wide with its distal half being wider than the mesial one. P2 has a major labial cusp and two lingual cusps; it is smaller and mesiodistally shorter than P1. In the right side dentition, a deeply worn and double-rooted tooth is positioned lateral to P2 ( a and d). This unusual location does not seem to be caused by distortion of the maxilla, although the maxilla was fractured in this region. This tooth is tentatively interpreted as an unshed deciduous premolar (?dP2). Distal to the right P2, P3 and P4 (dP4) are not preserved. Because of distortion of the skull, the right maxilla bearing M1-2 was mesially pushed so that the space between P2 and M1 is shortened. A concavity distal to P2 is presumably the alveolus for P3; it is not long enough as the alveoli for both P3 and P4 (dP4). The left P3 has two lingual cusps that are worn to form a continuous wear facet facing ventrolingually. The labial side of P3 also bears two major cusps, with the distal one being the largest of the tooth that is followed by a conule at its distal base. The tooth denoted as the left P4 sits distal to P3. It is not fully erupted and is only partly visible so that its complete morphology cannot be ascertained ( a and b,c). From the exposed portion, the crown of P4 appears similar to that of P3. The occlusal surface of P4 is lower than that of P3, but it already has a notable wear facet on its lingual side. This wear facet is continuous with that of the dP4. The tooth identified as dP4 is rectangular; it is shorter than M1 and wider than the mesial portion of M1. The tooth is deeply worn but its ridge-like distal cusps are still discernable. The mesiolingual part of dP4 was worn off or broken; otherwise dP4 would completely block P4 in occlusal view. The general outline and multicuspate crown of dP4 indicate a molariform tooth. The cusp formula of M1 is 6-7:7:5; it is narrow mesially and broad distally due to addition of the lingual row of cusps. The cusps of M1 are subequal, separated by narrow furrows, and have an opposing arrangement in which a lingual cusp aligns transversely with a labial cusp. After wear the labial cusps are taller than those of the medial and lingual rows. The lingual cusp row extends mesially to about two thirds of the tooth length. The cusp formula of M2 is 2:3:4. As in all multituberculates, M2 is distolingually displaced relative to M1."
