        "text": "You are the Music\n\n​while the Music Lasts\n\n​Quotations from Four Quartets\n\n​“We shall not cease from exploration\n\nAnd the end of all our exploring\n\nWill be to arrive where we started\n\nAnd know the place for the first time.”\n\n\"The voice of the hidden waterfall\n\nAnd the children in the apple-tree\n\nNot known, because not looked for\n\nBut heard, half-heard, in the stillness\n\nBetween two waves of the sea.\n\nQuick now, here, now, always—\"\n\n​“Humankind cannot bear very much reality.”\n\n​“Time present and time past\n\nAre both perhaps present in time future\n\nAnd time future contained in time past.”\n\n​\"Time past and time future\n\nWhat might have been and what has been\n\nPoint to one end, which is always present.\n\nAt the still point of the turning world. Neither flesh nor fleshless;\n\nNeither from nor towards; at the still point, there the dance is.\"\n\n“Or music heard so deeply\n\nThat it is not heard at all, but you are the music\n\nWhile the music lasts.”\n\n.\n\nQ is for Questing\n\n​\n\nLeaving Room for Thunder\n\nFour Quartets is TS Eliot's last great work, composed against the background of imminent and actual world war. It consists of meditations on the relationship between time, love, death, religion, and cosmology.\n\nEven as it is deeply philosophical, it is not possessed by definitions. In this it resembles Part V of Whitehead's Process and Reality, where Whitehead, too, was meditating on time and humanity in a poetic way, free from addiction to axiomatic prose.\n\nDylan Thomas says that poets leave room \"for holes and gaps, so that something that is not in the poem can creep, crawl, flash or thunder in.\"\n\nIn Four Quartets Eliot leaves room for the thunder, and Whitehead does the same in Part V of Process and Reality.\n\nThere is a freedom in the exploration: a freedom to explore and enjoy the mystery of having been moved by words, without landing on positions. In the spiritual alphabet of process theology, borrowing from Spirituality and Practice, Q is for questing. Leave room for thunder.\n\n​- Jay McDaniel, 11/12/22\n\nOn Not Being Possessed by Definitions *\n\n“You're back with the mystery of having been moved by words. The best craftsmanship always leaves holes and gaps. . .so that something that is not in the poem can creep, crawl, flash or thunder in”.\n\n​- Dylan Thomas\n\n​\n\n​\n\n\"Poets are soldiers who liberate words from the steadfast possession of definition.\"\n\n- Eli Khamarov\n\n“Difficult poetry is the most democratic, because you are doing your audience the honour of supposing that they are intelligent human beings. If you write as if you had to placate or in any way entice their lack of interest, then I think you are making condescending assumptions about people. I mean people are not fools. But so much of the populist poetry of today treats people as if they were fools”.\n\n- Geoffrey Hill\n\n​\n\n* All quotations from Professor Belinda Jack's lecture below"
