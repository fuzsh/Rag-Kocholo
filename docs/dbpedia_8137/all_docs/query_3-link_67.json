        "text": "T.S. Eliot, the Poet, is Dead in London at 76\n\nTuesday, January 5, 1965\n\nWriter, Born in U.S., Gained Fame With 'The Waste Land'\n\nSpecial to The New York Times\n\nONDON. Jan.4--T.S. Eliot, the quiet, gray figure who gave new meaning to English-language poetry, died today at his home in London. He was 76 years old.\n\nEliot was an American, born in St. Louis. He moved to England at the beginning of World War I and became wholly identified with Britain, even becoming naturalized in 1927.\n\nNevertheless, when President Johnson recently awarded the Medal of Freedom to leaders in American literature and public life, Eliot was among those honored. He did not make the trip to the United States, however, to receive the award.\n\nThe influence of Eliot began with the publication in 1917 of his poem \"The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock.\" Perhaps his most significant contribution came five years later in the lengthy poem \"The Waste Land.\"\n\nFrom time to time Eliot would give readings of his poetry in public. He read softly, but when he ended \"The Waste Land\" in a quick rush of words audiences were always moved.\n\nEliot was a convert to Anglo-Catholicism and his religious belief showed up strongly in his later works.\n\nEliot won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1948 and was awarded the order of Merit by Britain in the same year.\n\nThis is the way the world ends\n\nThis is the way the world ends\n\nThis is the way the world ends\n\nNot with a bang but a whimper\n\nThese four lines by Thomas Stearns Eliot, written as the conclusion to \"The Hollow Men\" in 1925, are probably the most quoted lines of any 20th-century poet writing in English. They are also the essence of Eliot as he established his reputation as a poet of post-World War I disillusion and despair.\n\nThey were written by an expatriate from St. Louis, a graduate of Harvard College, who had chosen to live in London and who was working as a bank clerk.\n\nThe \"bang and the whimper,\" together with \"The Waste Land\" published three years earlier, established Eliot as a major poet. From there he went on to mellowness, fame, financial independence and a Nobel prize but he always remained in the layman's view, the poet of gray melancholy.\n\nThis persisted despite notable literary criticism that established new pathways in the field and despite two plays of considerable merit, \"The Cocktail Party\" and \"Murder in the Cathedral.\" These, while not of flaming hue, were not yet gray.\n\nCursed though he might be with that reputation, Eliot's early poems but did not represent the more mature conclusions of his later years about the state of mankind and the world as stated in \"The Four Quartets\" or his delicious sense of humor, which included himself:\n\nHow unpleasant to meet Mr. Eliot!\n\nWith his features of clerical cut.\n\nAnd his brow so grim\n\nAnd his mouth so prim\n\nAnd his conversation, so nicely\n\nRestricted to What Precisely\n\nAnd If and Perhaps and But...\n\nWhereas Eliot began his seminal \"The Waste Land\" with the line \"April is the cruellest month\" and ended it 434 lines later with \"Shantih shantih shantih,\" his more seasoned reflections included these lines from \"The Four Quartets\":\n\n...And right action is freedom\n\nFrom past and future also.\n\nFor most of us, this is the aim\n\nNever here to be realized;\n\nWho are only undefeated\n\nBecause we have gone on trying;\n\nWe, content at last\n\nIf our temporal reversion nourish\n\n(Not too far from the yew-tree)\n\nThe life of significant soil\n\nNot only did Eliot shift his philosophic outlook, but his poetic accents also became almost conversational, verging on the informal.\n\nLacked Flamboyance\n\nIn his later years he had an office in London in the publishing house of Faber & Faber, of which he was a director. There he carried on his business, writing letters and articles, somewhat like the clerkish type he resembled.\n\nIn appearance he was then, as he was in early life, a most unlikely figure for a poet. He lacked flamboyance or oddity in dress or manner, and there was nothing of the romantic about him. He carried no auras, cast no arresting eye and wore his heart, as nearly as he could be observed, in its proper anatomical place.\n\nHis habits of work were equally \"unpoetic,\" for he eschewed bars and cafes for the pleasant and bourgeois comforts of an office with padded chairs and a well-lighted desk.\n\nTalking of his work habits, he once said:\n\n\"A great deal of my new play, 'The Elder Statesman,' was produced in pencil and paper, very roughly. Then I typed it myself first before my wife got to work on it. In typing myself I make alterations, very considerable ones. But whether I write or type, composition of any length, a play for example, means for me regular hours, say 10 to 1. I found that three hours a day is about all I can do of actual composing. I could do the polish perhaps later.\"\n\nEliot's dress was a model of the London man of business. He wore a bowler and often carried a tightly rolled umbrella. His accent which started out as pure American Middle West did undergo changes, becoming over the years quite British U.\n\nThe U was complete and unfeigned. \"I am,\" he said stoutly, \"an Anglo-Catholic in religion, a classicist in literature and a royalist in politics.\"\n\nEven so, his ascetic austerity drew the line at gin rummy, which he delighted to play of an evening. He also kept a signed photograph of Groucho Marx, cigar protuberant, in his study at home.\n\nThese touches lend credence to Eliot's attempts in later years to soften some aspects of his credo. His religious beliefs, he asserted, remained unchanged and he was still in favor of monarchy in all countries having a monarch, but the term classicism was no longer so important to him.\n\nThe poet was born on Sept. 26, 1888, into a family of some privilege that had a good background in the intellectual, religious and business life of New England. After a year at Milton (Mass.) Academy, he entered Harvard in 1906 in the class that included Water Lippmann, Heywood Broun, John Reed and Stuart Chase. He completed his undergraduate work in three years and took a Master of Arts degree in his fourth.\n\nTea With Students\n\nAlthough he never took his doctorate, he completed the dissertation in 1916. It was titled \"Experience and Objects of Knowledge in the Philosophy of F.H. Bradley.\" This thinker's monist view of personality greatly influenced Eliot's poetic sensibility, reinforcing his themes of human isolation in guilt.\n\nHis Harvard classmates recall that he dressed with the studied carelessness of a British gentleman, smoked a pipe and liked to be left alone.\n\nThis aspect of Eliot was hardly altered when he returned to Harvard in the nineteen-thirties for a half-year as a sort of poet in residence.\n\nIn that sojourn he lived in an undergraduate house near the Charles River and entertained students at least once a week at teas. The tea was always brewed and he poured with great delicacy, his long and tabescent fingers clasping the handle of the silver teapot. The quality of his tea, the excellence of the college-provided petit fours and the rippling flow of his conversation drew overflow crowds of students who sat on chairs, on the floor and on windowsills.\n\nAt these functions, Eliot was shy and patient with the halting undergraduates, and he must have suffered many fools, but such was his courtesy that he never showed it openly. He just sat and talked, reclining on a high-backed cloth chair, puffing and relighting his pipe, crossing and uncrossing his tweed-covered legs.\n\nEliot was an omnivorous and retentive reader. He consumed philosophy, languages and letters and this lent his poetry an erudition and scholarship unmatched in this century. Indeed, he carried scholrship so far as to footnote \"The Waste Land\" as though it were a thesis for a doctorate.\n\nHe was also able, because of his extensive reading, to converse (and hold reasoned views) on a range of subjects from Shakespeare to Karl Marx.\n\nHis views and his expression of them were usually pungent.\n\n\"No one can go very far in the discerning enjoyment of poetry,\" he once remarked, \"who is incapable of enjoying any poetry other than that of his own time and place. It is in fact a part of the function of education to help us to escape--not from our own time, for we are bound by that--but from the intellectual and emotional limitations of our own time.\"\n\nHe had a strong dislike for most teaching of poetry, and he once recalled that he had been turned against Shakespeare in his youth by didactical instructors.\n\n\"I took a dislike to 'Julius Caesar' which lasted, I am sorry to say, until I saw the film of Marlon Brando and John Gielgud, and a dislike to 'The Merchant of Venice' which persists to this day.\n\n\"It may be that a few plays and poems must be sacrificed [in school] in order that we learn that English literature exists and that an ordinary acquaintance with it is desirable.\"\n\nEliot believed, moreover, that \"unless a teacher is a person who reads poetry for enjoyment he or she cannot stimulate pupils to enjoy it.\"\n\nPursuing this theme, he once described how teachers of literature should go about it:\n\n\"My Ideal Teacher will teach the prescribed classics of literature as history, as part of history which every educated person should know something about, whether he likes it or not; and then should lead some of the pupils to enjoyment, and the rest at least to the point of recognizing that there are other persons who do enjoy it. And he will introduce the pupils to contemporary poetry by exciting enjoyment; enjoyment first and understanding second.\"\n\nEliot, however, was not one to minimize the difficulties of understanding poetic complexities or achieving empathy with its mood and feeling. \"The reader of a poem,\" he admonished, \"should take at least as much trouble as a barrister reading a decision on a complicated case.\"\n\nTaught in London\n\nIn 1915 Eliot became a teacher in the Highgate School in London, and the next year went to work in Lloyds Bank, Ltd.\n\nHints of this commercial experience, of which he rarely complained, although the work must have been tedious, peep unexpectedly out of his poetry. For instance, \"A Cooking Egg\" contains these lines:\n\n...We two shall lie together,\n\nlapt\n\nIn five percent Exchequer Bond\n\nEliot's association with the \"little\" magazines--those voices of protest against the Establishment--began when he was assistant editor of Egoist from 1917 to 1919.\n\nHe established The Criterion, a literary publication that never had a circulation exceeding 900. Later he was a working editor for Faber & Faber.\n\nThe first poem that started Eliot's reputation was \"The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock\" in 1917. In it he assumed the pose of a fastidious, world-weary, young-old man, aging into ironic wit. The poem is full of exquisitely precise surrealist images and rhythms, but it also has some everyday metaphors. Part of it goes:\n\nI grow old...I grow old...\n\nI shall wear the bottoms of my trousers rolled.\n\nShall I part my hair behind?\n\nDo I dare to eat a peach?\n\nShall wear white flannel trousers and walk upon the beach...\n\nEliot's strictures on applying concentrated efforts to the understanding of poetry could well apply to his next major poem, \"The Waste Land.\" Heavily influenced by Ezra Pound (it was in fact dedicated to that other poet of obscurity), \"The Waste Land\" was an expression of gigantic frustration and despair. But it made his reputation, although its author conceded in later years that he wrote it \"simply to relieve my own feelings.\"\n\nThe poem, a series of somewhat blurred visions, centers on an imaginary waste region, the home of the Fisher King, a little-known figure in mythology, who is sexually impotent. Writing on \"The Waste Land,\" Helen Gardner, an authority on Eliot's writings, noted: \"The sense of boredom and horror behind both the beauty and ugliness is expressed by juxtaposition of the beautiful and the ugly.\" In another reference, Miss Gardner wrote of Eliot's \"union of the common and the formal, the colloquial and the remote, the precise and the suggestive.\"\n\nAfter \"The Waste Land,\" Eliot's development was tortured and hesitant, but was clearly marked. His interest in the spiritual development of man rather than in his spiritual inadequacies grew after his early period, when he poked more or less good-natured fun at the church in such works as \"The Hippopotamus.\" He sees the haloed hippo ascending into heaven:\n\nBlood of the Lamb shall wash him clean\n\nAnd him shall heavenly arms unfold.\n\nAmong the saints he shall be seen\n\nPerforming on a harp of gold.\n\nHe shall be washed as white as snow,\n\nBy all the martyr'd virgins kist,\n\nWhile the True Church remains below\n\nWrapt in the old miasmal mist.\n\nIn one of his poetry readings at Columbia University, Eliot recited \"The Hippopotamus,\" which had been published in 1914. He said: \"It doesn't seem shocking to anybody now, I think, as it did all those years ago.\" He discussed his comparison between the hippopotamus and the church:\n\n\"The True Church need never stir\n\nTo gather its dividends.\n\nHe recalled \"A good many years after I had written those lines I became a church warden and we were wondering how to keep the church going on the collections. So one lives and learns.\n\nEliot was regarded as an important literary critic as well as a poet. Much of his criticism was published in literary reviews or delivered from the lecture platform, without subsequently appearing in book form. His first book, \"The Sacred Wood,\" was published in 1920.\n\nThis book and much of Eliot's subsequent criticism introduced certain types of writing to the intelligent reading public with accompanying evaluation that heightened interest in important writers who were not so well known.\n\nIt is possible that Eliot is most widely known through his drama \"Murder in the Cathedral,\" which was often produced in this country and which was made into a motion picture. It is a grim, sardonic account of the murder of Thomas à Beckett, Archbishop of Canterbury, in 1170.\n\nAn opera, \"Assassinio Nella Cattedrale,\" written by Ildebrando Pizzetti, was based on the Eliot drama and enjoyed a critical success.\n\nTwo of Eliot's plays enjoyed critical success in London and New York. \"The Cocktail Party,\" published in 1954, was a story of deeply religious experience told against a background of highly literate and amusing British people.\n\n\"The Confidential Clerk\" told of bastardy and general unhappiness.\n\nIn his lighter moments (and there were many) Eliot was an unabashed aelurophile. He kept cats at home, bestowing upon them such names as Man in White Spats; he also wrote a book of poems called \"Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats\" and in his dry, cadenced voice he read the verses on the platforms and for recordings.\n\nThese lines from \"The Naming of Cats\" illustrate Eliot's profound insight into the narcissistic world of the feline:\n\nBut I tell you, a cat needs a name that's particular.\n\nA name that is peculiar, and more dignified,\n\nElse how can he keep up his tail perpendicular.\n\nOr spread out his whiskers, or cherish his pride?\n\nOf names of this kind, I can give you a quorum,\n\nSuch as Munkustrap, Quaxo or Coricopat.\n\nSuch as Bambalurina, or else Jellyorum--\n\nNames that never belong to more than one cat.\n\nBut above and beyond there's still one name left over.\n\nAnd that is the name you will never guess;\n\nThe name that no human research can discover--\n\nBut THE CAT HIMSELF KNOWS, and will never confess.\n\nWhen you notice a cat in profound meditation,\n\nThe reason, I tell you, is always the same:\n\nHis mind is engaged in rapy contemplation\n\nOf the thought, of the thought, of the thought of his name;\n\nHis ineffable effable\n\nEffeineffable\n\nDeep and inscrutable singular Name.\n\nThose critical of Eliot's writing accused him of obscurity for its own sake. They found his verses full of coy and precious little mannerisms. They accused him of loading down his writing with obscure code references that could not possibly be known except to a few intimate friends such as Pound. Unless you knew that Eliot called Pound \"Mop\" and that Pound called Eliot \"Possum\" you couldn't possibly know what they were getting at, these critics asserted.\n\nIn politics, Eliot liked to say that he was a \"monarchist,\" although most of his friends suspected that he saw the monarchial principle as a symbol rather than as a political instrument. The doctrines of the Anglo-Catholiscism were probably the greatest influence in later life and writings. He was a vestryman at a fashionable London church.\n\nIn 1927, Eliot became the first important American man of letters since Henry James to become a British subject. He said at the time:\n\n\"Here I am, making a living, enjoying my friends here. I don't want to feel like being a squatter. I might as well take full responsibility.\"\n\nIn 1949, King George VI conferred the Order of Merit on the poet. This is one of Britain's highest awards. No more than 24 persons may hold it at one time.\n\nLectured at Harvard\n\nEliot returned to his native country many times and in 1948 resided in Princeton, where he worked at the Institute for Advance Study.\n\nIn 1950, he gave the first Theodore Spencer Memorial Lecture at Harvard on \"Poetry and Drama.\" He lectured frequently and gave readings of his poems in New York and throughout the country.\n\nEliot was a rather stooped man of a little over 6 feet who had a somewhat prim appearance which mingled with a slight air of anxiety common to persons who are shy.\n\nIn London, Eliot lived in a comfortable, modern apartment in Chelsea overlooking the Thames. In 1915, he married Miss Vivienne Haigh-Wood, who died in 1947. They had no children. In January, 1957, Eliot married Miss Valerie Fletcher, his private secretary. He was then 68 years old and his bride about 30.\n\nA new play by Eliot, \"The Elder Statesman,\" was first performed at the Edinburgh Festival in 1958 and ran briefly in London, where it was not received with any particular enthusiasm. It was in the spirit of his previous plays, \"The Cocktail Party\" and \"The Confidential Clerk,\" and dealt with the tragic lack of communication between a British father and his son.\n\nIn that year Eliot was 70 and in an interview said: \"I am just beginning to grow up, to get maturity. In the last few years everything I'd done up to 60 or so has seemed very childish.\"\n\nIn connection with Eliot's 70th birthday, a book was published entitled \"T.S. Eliot: A Symposium for His 70th Birthday.\" It contained anecdotes about the poet, comment on his writings and other matter concerning Eliot written by 50 persons, most of whom knew him.\n\nHis Verse Reflected Spiritual Despair After First War\n\nIt is very likely that when the literary history of our time comes to be written, it will be characterized as the Age of Eliot, just as we speak now of the Age of Pope or Tennyson.\n\nFor no man in the period between the two World Wars so dominated his time as critic and creator as did T.S. Eliot. And no man did more to help shape the standards by which he was judged. For this expatriate American caught and expressed in his verse the sense of a doomed world, of fragmentation, of a wasteland of the spirit that moved the generation after the war.\n\nIt was a generation that felt tricked by the politicians, felt that the enormous bloodletting of World War I had been a fraud and saw in the disintegrating Europe of their time the symbol of their own lives. Their mood of spiritual despair was exquisitely rendered in Eliot's poetry.\n\nIt is said that he resented being spoken of as the poet of a wasteland, and yet the dry tone, the arid physical and spiritual landscape of his early poetry, the bleakness that stared out of his verse, whether he wished it or not, summed up for a generation their own sense of defeat, their sense of barrenness. They echoed his words, \"I have seen the moment of my greatness flicker.\"\n\nBy transplanting himself from the America where he was born and nurtured to England he gave physical proof of the alienation and exile that were a hallmark of the sensibilities of the nineteen-twenties.\n\nThe tone of fastidious weariness that characterized \"Prufrock,\" was welcomed eagerly by the young on both sides of the Atlantic. In this poem, where high purpose has been dissolved into the niceties of social behavior, they found an excuse if not an answer to their lack of purpose and direction. In the character of Sweeney who inhabits his poems, Eliot expressed the contrast between the mindless and brutalizing force of the world and the permanent values that are destroyed by it.\n\nBut it was \"The Waste Land,\" whose very form seemed to reflect the title, that gave a heading to the time. The poem, too, by its borrowings from different literatures and cultures, by offering complexities and helping with solutions, also gave a further turn to the critical taste that delighted in explication and esoteric burrowings, which felt that explanation almost came before enjoyment.\n\nWith \"Ash Wednesday,\" Eliot turned to the support and succor of faith, and in \"Four Quartets\" he worked out with a calm music a statement of the strength of abiding belief. There was, too, a mordant and satiric side to the poet as in \"Conversation Galante\" and \"Cousin Nancy\" and a playful one, best found in \"Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats.\"\n\nIn his critical essays Eliot wrote with a transparency of style and certainly of tone that were enormously persuasive. By his disapproval of the overweighted character of Milton's lines, he turned a generation of scholars to the complexities and involved conceits of the metaphysicals and those who derived from them.\n\nThough perhaps not a formal member of the New Critics, he gave them encouragement and support by his own poetic practice and by the choice of subjects and treatment in his own work. By borrowings and paraphrases he made new readers aware of the writings of the French symbolist poets.\n\nMore than all this, however, by asserting that \"Poetry is not a turning loose of emotion, but an escape from emotion; it is not the expression of personality, but an escape from personality\" and by demanding that the poet must search for the object, situation or event that objectively expresses the emotion, Eliot supplied critical tools to both maker and critic alike.\n\nIn his verse plays, Eliot hoped to restore poetic drama to a place it once occupied, though whether there is enough life in his characters and whether their moral dilemmas will carry over to another age needs best be left to time. Only \"Murder in the Cathedral\" seems to have the necessary staying power, at least in book form, if not on the stage.\n\nAlthough Eliot's influence began to wane in the last decade of his life, we are still too close to the light he shed to take his measure accurately. That his poems will have a permanent place in that tradition he so cherished is certain. And whatever judgment is made of his criticism, no consideration of 20th-century literature in English will be able to bypass him. If we judge a man by the vacancy that his absence from his time would have caused, T.S. Eliot was a giant.\n\nPoets and critics, many of them friends of T.S. Eliot for a number of years, paid tribute to him yesterday. Following are some statements on his death.\n\nROBERT LOWELL, poet and author of the play \"The Old Glory:\" \"He was a dear personal friend. Our American literature has had no greater poet or critic.\"\n\nALLEN TATE, poet, critic and professor of English at the University of Minnesota: \"I knew him for 36 years. Mr. Eliot was the greatest poet in English of the 20th century and he had the same relation to this age as Samuel Johnson had to the 18th century.\"\n\nCONRAD AIKEN, poet, now in Savannah, Ga: \"I was one of his oldest friends since 1908. We put out the Harvard Advocate together. There is no question about it; he was one of the great poets of our time. I loved him very much as a man. He was an extraordinary poet and also wrote one of the outstanding plays, 'Murder in the Cathedral.'\"\n\nLOUIS UNTERMEYER, poet: \"Eliot made a revolution in the language of modern poetry, and our whole attitude toward what we call modern poetry. He has influenced every young poet whether he knows it. He changed the vocabulary of poetry, which in the past was on the level of poetic diction. He brought into writing what was beautiful and what was banal. He contrasted the ugly, the commonplace and vulgar, with what was beautiful. He showed the horror, the boredom and the glory of life. His influence will last at least for another century.\"\n\nHORACE GREGORY, poet: \"This is a very great loss indeed. As a man he was very generous and kind to younger poets. He never gave indiscriminate praise. I'm very much upset about this.\"\n\nROBERT PENN WARREN, poet, critic: \"He is the key figure of our century in America and England, the most powerful single influence. This is his age. He gave us the sense of the culture crisis of the Western world, when we were suddenly thrown on our own in a different way than ever before. This awareness of the state of the individual in the face of a cultural crisis was his greatness.\"\n\nJOHN CROWE RANSOM, poet, critic and teacher: \"I started out years ago with a criticism that was a little antagonistic to his 'Wasteland.' I soon got over that. He had a wonderful power for the dramatic.\""
