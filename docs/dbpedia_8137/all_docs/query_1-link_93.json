        "text": "The English Eliot: Design, Language and Landscape in Four Quartets\n\n1st Edition\n\nBy Steve Ellis\n\nMay 26, 2017\n\nThis book, first published in 1991, supplies a neglected cultural context for T. S. Eliot’s writings of the 1930s and 1940s, particularly Four Quartets, and attempts to disprove the widespread belief in Eliot’s unproblematic commitment to England, and the ‘Englishness’. The book traces Eliot’s ...\n\nPoetry and Belief in the Work of T. S. Eliot\n\n1st Edition\n\nBy Kristian Smidt\n\nMay 23, 2017\n\nThis title, first published in 1961, explores the general background of attitudes, beliefs and ideas from which Eliot’s works have originated. This study examines the influences of Eliot’s work, and includes Eliot’s personal views as told to the author. The book also looks at technique, structure ...\n\nT. S. Eliot: A Friendship\n\n1st Edition\n\nBy E. W. F. Tomlin\n\nMay 23, 2017\n\nFirst published in 1988. Fredrick Tomlin and T. S. Eliot were friends for almost thirty-four years. What emerges from Fredrick Tomlin’s memories and the many letters which passed between them is a private Eliot, seen only by his closest family and a trusted few. Tomlin evokes the man as he was – ...\n\nT. S. Eliot Between Two Worlds: A Reading of T. S. Eliot's Poetry and Plays\n\n1st Edition\n\nBy David Ward\n\nMay 23, 2017\n\nThe basis of this critical examination of Eliot’s work, first published in 1973, is the investigation of his transmutation of this and other philosophical, mythological and religious motives into the textures of his verse. This book focuses on Eliot’s peculiar eclectic approach to what he described...\n\nT. S. Eliot and the Romantic Critical Tradition\n\n1st Edition\n\nBy Edward Lobb\n\nMay 23, 2017\n\nEdward Lobb’s study, first published in 1981, is a thorough examination of Eliot’s relation to Romantic criticism. This title also makes extensive use of Eliot’s Clark Lectures on metaphysical poetry. Delivered in 1926, the lectures complete the picture of literary history set out in Eliot’s ...\n\nT. S. Eliot's Romantic Dilemma: Tradition's Anti-Traditional Elements\n\n1st Edition\n\nBy Eugenia M. Gunner\n\nMay 23, 2017\n\nThe fact that Eliot disapproved of Romanticism is clear from his critical essays, where he often appears to reject it absolutely. However, Eliot’s understanding of the term and his appreciation of literature developed and altered greatly from his adolescence to his years of scholarly study, yet he ...\n\nThe Poetry of T. S. Eliot\n\n1st Edition\n\nBy Kristian Smidt\n\nMay 23, 2017\n\nIn this fascinating and revealing book, first published in 1952, Maxwell shows the development of Eliot’s poetry and poetic thought in the light of his political and religious attachments. This study traces Eliot’s style from the earliest poems to the Quartets, and examines the characteristics of ...\n\nYeats, Eliot, Pound and the Politics of Poetry: Richest to the Richest\n\n1st Edition\n\nBy Cairns Craig\n\nMay 23, 2017\n\nIt has long been recognised that there is an apparently paradoxical relationship between the revolutionary poetic style developed by Yeats, Eliot and Pound in the period during and after the First World War, and the reactionary politics with which they were associated in the 1920s and 1930s. ...\n\nRoutledge Library Editions: T. S. Eliot\n\n1st Edition\n\nBy Various\n\nDecember 04, 2015\n\nThis set reissues 10 books on T. S. Eliot originally published between 1952 and 1991.
