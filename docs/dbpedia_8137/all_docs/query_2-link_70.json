        "text": "Eliot was born in St. Louis, Missouri, in 1886, and he became one of the most prominent modernist poets. He was a famously private person—Leonard Woolf said he was \"like someone in a sealed envelope\"—but he did put a few personal touches into this collection. He himself was \"Old Possum,\" a nickname from Ezra Pound, and the poems were intended for his godchildren. Critics suggest the puns and silliness hinted at Eliot’s sense of humor and counteracting the serious reputation he’d earned with most of his literary output, like \"The Lovesong of J. Alfred Prufrock\" (1915), The Waste Land (1922), and \"Ash-Wednesday\" (1930). (Check them out in this collected volume, or as an e-book.)\n\nSo, as much as we’d love to see a no-CGI version of the upcoming movie, we’ll stick to the source material here and suggest some books based on the personalities of our favorite cats from Eliot’s original poems. Feel free to check out this quiz from PBS (!) for a more personalized recommendation, too.\n\nAnd if you just can’t get enough feline books in your life, take a look at our book experts’ suggestions for their own favorite cat books and for young cat enthusiasts.\n\nAre we really about to recommend books to fictional cats? You bet your sweet Skimbleshanks we are.\n\nJennyanydots\n\nI have a Gumbie Cat in mind, her name is Jennyanydots;\n\nHer coat is of the tabby kind, with tiger stripes and leopard spots.\n\nAll day she sits upon the stair or on the steps or on the mat:\n\nShe sits and sits and sits and sits—and that's what makes a Gumbie Cat!\n\nBut when the day's hustle and bustle is done,\n\nThen the Gumbie Cat's work is but hardly begun.\n\nAnd when all the family's in bed and asleep,\n\nShe tucks up her skirts to the basement to creep.\n\nShe is deeply concerned with the ways of the mice—\n\nTheir behaviour's not good and their manners not nice;\n\nSo when she has got them lined up on the matting,\n\nShe teaches them music, crocheting and tatting.\n\nRebel Wilson plays Jennyanydots in the movie, and she’s a trickster, all right. Astound and delight your fellow cats with sleight-of-hand from Magic Tricks with Coins, Cards, and Everyday Objects by Jake Banfield.\n\nGus the Theatre Cat\n\nGus is the Cat at the Theatre Door.\n\nHis name, as I ought to have told you before,\n\nIs really Asparagus. That's such a fuss\n\nTo pronounce, that we usually call him just Gus.\n\nHis coat's very shabby, he's thin as a rake,\n\nAnd he suffers from palsy that makes his paw shake.\n\nYet he was, in his youth, quite the smartest of Cats—\n\nBut no longer a terror to mice and to rats.\n\nFor he isn't the Cat that he was in his prime;\n\nThough his name was quite famous, he says, in its time.\n\nIn one of many acts of brilliant, nearly inexplicable casting, Ian McKellen plays Gus in the film. The esteemed Shakespearean actor is also a prolific audiobook narrator, with dozens of titles to his name; download his work on recordings of The Odyssey, Henry IV, or Asylum from the Library.\n\nMacavity the Mystery Cat\n\nMacavity's a Mystery Cat: he's called the Hidden Paw—\n\nFor he's the master criminal who can defy the Law.\n\nHe's the bafflement of Scotland Yard, the Flying Squad's despair:\n\nFor when they reach the scene of crime—Macavity's not there!\n\nIdris Elba doesn’t need help from us, but maybe Macavity could use some tips on international espionage, in case he ever decides to take his criminal mastermind act on the road. And in that case, Work Like a Spy: Business Tips from a Former CIA Officerby J.C. Carlson could help Macavity up his game even further.\n\nBustopher Jones\n\nBustopher Jones is not skin and bones—\n\nIn fact, he's remarkably fat.\n\nHe doesn't haunt pubs—he has eight or nine clubs,\n\nFor he's the St. James's Street Cat!\n\nHe's the Cat we all greet as he walks down the street\n\nIn his coat of fastidious black:\n\nNo commonplace mousers have such well-cut trousers\n\nOr such an impeccable back.\n\nIn the whole of St. James's the smartest of names is\n\nThe name of this Brummell of Cats;\n\nAnd we're all of us proud to be nodded or bowed to\n\nBy Bustopher Jones in white spats!\n\nClearly, this James Corden cat cares a great deal about being well dressed, so we’re recommending the full complement of Tim Gunn’s style guides and and books of fashion advice. Make it work, Bustopher!\n\nOld Deuteronomy\n\nOld Deuteronomy's lived a long time;\n\nHe's a Cat who has lived many lives in succession.\n\nHe was famous in proverb and famous in rhyme\n\nA long while before Queen Victoria's accession.\n\nRespect must be paid to this cat, and obviously, Dame Judi Dench could play Old Deuteronomy in her sleep. Check out her autobiographies, Behind the Scenes and And Furthermore.\n\nRum Tum Tugger\n\nThe Rum Tum Tugger is a Curious Cat:\n\nIf you offer him pheasant he would rather have grouse,\n\nIf you put him in a house he would much prefer a flat,\n\nIf you put him in a flat then he'd rather have a house.\n\nIf you set him on a mouse then he only wants a rat,\n\nIf you set him on a rat then he'd rather chase a mouse.\n\nYes the Rum Tum Tugger is a Curious Cat—\n\nAnd there isn't any call for me to shout it:\n\nFor he will do\n\nAs he do do\n\nAnd there's no doing anything about it!\n\nMischievous and curious is a dangerous combination—and in the new film, Jason Derulo plays Rum Tum Tugger as the sexiest cat in a whole cast of sexy cats. We’re not sure this is exactly what Eliot had in mind, but hey, maybe Rum and his pals could all use some advice from the wisest woman of the book and the screen, Nora Ephron. The Most of Nora Ephroncollects dozens upon dozens of her essays, as a final gift to her devoted readers.\n\nDo you have a favorite Cat, and an idea about what book they’d read?"
