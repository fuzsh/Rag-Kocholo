        "text": "An American-English poet, playwright and influential literary critic, T. S. Eliot was a leader of the Modernist movement in poetry, producing important works such as ‘The Waste Land’ and ‘Four Quartets’. His work exerted a strong influence on Anglo-American culture from the 1920’s until late on in the century. His experiments in diction, style and versification helped revitalise English poetry, while his critical essays challenged old orthodoxies and forged new approaches. Eliot was awarded the 1948 Nobel Prize in Literature “for his outstanding, pioneer contribution to present-day poetry”. The Delphi Poets Series offers readers the works of literature’s finest poets, with superior formatting. This volume presents Eliot’s complete poetical and dramatic works, with related illustrations and the usual Delphi bonus material.
