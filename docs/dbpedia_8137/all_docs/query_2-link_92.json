        "text": "I’ve enjoyed posting poetry series themed around the Christian year in the past couple of years (see “Poetry for Lent” and “Poetry for Easter“). I will continue that with a series called “Poetry for Ordinary Time.” Ordinary time includes two sections of the church year between Christmastide and Lent and Easter and Advent. The word “ordinary” here derives from the word ordinal by which the weeks are counted. Still, ordinary time does serve an opportunity to embrace the ordinary spaces and places of our lives, and the themes of the poems will express this.\n\nHere is an excerpt from the second part of T. S. Eliot’s poem Choruses from ‘The Rock’. Thomas Stearns Eliot is probably the most famous twentieth-century English-language poet, renowned for his groundbreaking work typified in poems like “The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock” (1911) and The Wasteland (1922). Eliot was born in the United States but resided in England for most of his adult life.\n\nOf all that was done in the past, you eat the fruit, either rotten or ripe.\n\nAnd the Church must be forever building, and always decaying, and always being restored.\n\nFor every ill deed in the past we suffer the consequence:\n\nFor sloth, for avarice, gluttony, neglect of the Word of GOD,\n\nFor pride, for lechery, treachery, for every act of sin.\n\nAnd of all that was done that was good, you have the inheritance.\n\nFor good and ill deeds belong to a man alone, when he stands alone on the other side of death,\n\nBut here upon earth you have the reward of the good and ill that was done by those who have gone before you.\n\nAnd all that is ill you may repair if you walk together in humble repentance, expiating the sins of your fathers;\n\nAnd all that was good you must fight to keep with hearts as devoted as those of your fathers who fought to gain it.\n\nThe Church must be forever building, for it is forever decaying within and attacked from without;\n\nFor this is the law of life; and you must remember that while there is time of prosperity\n\nThe people will neglect the Temple, and in time of adversity they will decry it.\n\nWhat life have you if you have not life together?\n\nThere is no life that is not in community,\n\nAnd no community not lived in praise of GOD.\n\nEven the anchorite who meditates alone,\n\nFor whom the days and nights repeat the praise of GOD,\n\nPrays for the Church, the Body of Christ incarnate.\n\nAnd now you live dispersed on ribbon roads,\n\nAnd no man knows or cares who is his neighbour\n\nUnless his neighbour makes too much disturbance,\n\nBut all dash to and fro in motor cars,\n\nFamiliar with the roads and settled nowhere.\n\nNor does the family even move about together,\n\nBut every son would have his motor cycle,\n\nAnd daughters ride away on casual pillions.\n\nMuch to cast down, much to build, much to restore;\n\nLet the work not delay, time and the arm not waste;\n\nLet the clay be dug from the pit, let the saw cut the stone,\n\nLet the fire not be quenched in the forge.\n\nPrevious poems in this series:"
