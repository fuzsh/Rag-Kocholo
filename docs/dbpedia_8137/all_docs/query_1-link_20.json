        "text": "\"There are possibilities for verse which bear some analogy to the development of a theme by different groups of instruments; there are possibilities of transitions in a poem comparable to the different movements of a symphony or a quartet; there are possibilities of contrapuntal arrangement of subject-matter.\" -- T.S. Eliot, \"The Music of Poetry\"\n\n\"The music of a word is, so to speak, at a point of intersection: it arises from its relation first to the words immediately preceding and following it, and indefinitely to the rest of its context; and from another relation, that of its immediate meaning in that context to all the other meanings which it has had in other contexts, to its greater or less wealth of association.\" -- \"On Poetry and Poets\"\n\nA quartet has a number of movements; each has its own keys, meters, rhythms, tempos, themes, and colors. Quartets build their effect on repetition, variation, point, and counterpoint. Its instruments imitate and answer each other; they develop previous themes in new directions, add new or different harmonies, change tones, as well as reverse melody lines and chord changes.\n\nE.g. Burnt Norton 1 (lines 1-15), 2 (lines 61-73a), East Coker 3 (compare lines 102-129 with 135-148)\n\nRoses (BN 1 -- the rose-garden, BN 2 -- \"the moment in the rose-garden,\" EC 2 -- \"Late roses filled with early snow,\" EC 4 -- \"the flame is roses,\" LG 2 -- \"Is all the ash the burnt roses leave,\" LG 3 -- the folding Rose, LG 5 -- \"the fire and the rose are one.\" [Likewise, one could note the use of flowers in general -- the clematis (BN 3), the ailanthus and lavender (DS 1 and 3), the snow blossoms on the hedgerow (LG 1)\n\nLight and Dark (BN 1 -- the light on the roses and filling the pool, BN 2 -- \"a white light still and moving,\" BN 3 -- the darkness of the subway, BN 4 -- The unturning light of God, BN 5 -- \"Sudden in a shaft of sunlight,\" EC 3 -- the darkness of the funeral age, DS 5 -- \"lost in a shaft of sunlight,\" LG 1 -- the sempiternal light, LG 2 -- the night of the bombing\n\nMovement [Subways, Dances, Voyages, etc.] (BN 3 -- the subway as \"a place of disaffection,\" which moves \"on its mettaled ways,\" EC 3 -- the conversation in the subway; BN 2 -- \"The dance along the artery,\" BN 5 -- \"The crying shadow in the funeral dance,\" EC 1 -- the country marriage dance, LG 2 -- \"Where you must move in measure, like a dancer,\" LG 5 -- \"The complete consort dancing together\". DS 2 -- the movement of the dock workers, the continual movement of the river and the sea; DS 3 -- \"Not fare well,/ But fare forward, voyagers.\" LG 5 -- \"We shall not cease from exploration/ And the end of all our exploring/ Will be to arrive where we started.\"\n\nStillness [The Wheel, Love, etc.] (BN 2 -- \"At the still point of the turning world\" that is the hub of the wheel and God. BN 3 -- \"But abstention from movement,\" BN 5 -- \"Love is itself unmoving,\" EC 3 -- \"wait without hope [...] without love [...] without thought,\" DS 4 -- \"Lady, whose shrine stands on the promontory\".\n\nTime, The Past/ The Present, History -- (BN 1 -- opening lines, BN 2 -- \"Only through time time is conquered.\" EC 1-2 -- associated with Thomas Elyot and past ways of expressing poetic ideals; EC 5 -- \"There is a time for the evening under starlight/ A time for the evening under lamplight.\" DS 2-3 -- \"We cannot think of a time that is oceanless,\" \"Time the destroyer is time the preserver,\" Time is no healer,\" DS 5 -- In the Incarnation \"the past and future/ Are conquered, and reconciled,\" LG -- the whole poem is based on the way past symbols and conflicts are resolved in the present: \"A people without history/ Is not redeemed from time, for history is a pattern/ Of timeless moments.\"\n\nThe Way of Negation (BN 3 -- \"Desiccation of the world of sense,/ Evacuation of the world of fancy,/ Inoperancy of the world of spirit,\" EC 3 -- \"You must go by a way wherein there is no ecstasy [. . .] You must go by a way which is the way of ignorance [...] You must go through the way in which you are not.\" DS 5 -- \"And taken, in a lifetime's death in love/ Ardour and selflessness and self-surrender.\" LG 1 -- \"And what you thought you came for/ Is only a shell, a husk of meaning\" LG 3 -- \"For liberation -- not less of love but expanding/ Of love beyond desire\".\n\nWordless Prayer (BN 5 -- \"Words, after speech, reach/ Into silence,\" EC 3 -- \"I said to my soul, be still, and wait without hope/ For hope would be hope for the wrong thing,\" DS 2 -- \"The prayer of the bone on the beach, the unprayable/ Prayer at the calamitous annunciation?\" DS 4 -- The Angelus, DS 5 -- \"the rest/ Is prayer, observance, discipline, thought and action.\" LG 1 -- \"And prayer is more/ Than an order of words, the conscious occupation/ Of the praying mind, or the sound of the voice praying.\""
