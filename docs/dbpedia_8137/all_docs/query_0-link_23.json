        "text": "A friend and I lamented the other night how we were only taught T.S. Eliot‘s early poems in undergrad: The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock (1917) and The Waste Land (1922). She came over so we could discuss the suite of four poems Eliot wrote after his conversion to Christianity and what I would claim as his magnum opus: the Four Quartets (1935-1942).\n\nI fell in love with Prufrock as much as the next budding English student swept away by the angst of modernism. This poem and The Waste Land were taught as Eliot’s crowning achievements, as if that was all there was to the man. It wasn’t until this year that I read his entire collected poems and realized if you just stop at his early works, you rob yourself of the bigger, more complete picture of who this famous poet was.\n\nThere’s no doubt T.S. Eliot is intimidating to read. He can throw down references to the Baghavad Gita as easily as the Bible, and there is a level of erudition from the reader his poems require. Every word and image matters, and there are so many layers to his work you could be peeling the onion forever.\n\nOne of the biggest differences that struck me in comparing his earlier poems to his later poems is the emergence of hope in the latter. Prufrock and The Waste Land are notable for their lack of hope—the despairing landscape they paint after World War I. A recurring theme in Eliot’s work is the failure of words to adequately describe human experience.\n\nWe see this in The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock:\n\nAnd would it have been worth it, after all,\n\nWould it have been worth while,\n\nAfter the sunsets and the dooryards and the sprinkled streets,\n\nAfter the novels, after the teacups, after the skirts that trail along the floor—\n\nAnd this, and so much more?—\n\nIt is impossible to say just what I mean!\n\nWe find a similar sentiment in East Coker, the third poem in the Four Quartets, and yet there’s a twist. I’m including this whole passage because it’s my favourite in the Four Quartets:\n\nSo here I am, in the middle way, having had twenty years—\n\nTwenty years largely wasted, the years of l’entre deux guerres—\n\nTrying to learn to use words, and every attempt\n\nIs a wholly new start, and a different kind of failure\n\nBecause one has only learnt to get the better of words\n\nFor the thing one no longer has to say, or the way in which\n\nOne is no longer disposed to say it. And so each venture\n\nIs a new beginning, a raid on the inarticulate\n\nWith shabby equipment always deteriorating\n\nIn the general mess of imprecision of feeling,\n\nUndisciplined squads of emotion. And what there is to conquer\n\nBy strength and submission, has already been discovered\n\nOnce or twice, or several times, by men whom one cannot hope\n\nTo emulate—but there is no competition—\n\nThere is only the fight to recover what has been lost\n\nAnd found and lost again and again: and now, under conditions\n\nThat seem unpropitious. But perhaps neither gain nor loss.\n\nFor us, there is only the trying. The rest is not our business.\n\nMy friend posited that the early T.S. Eliot would have stopped after “by men whom one cannot hope to emulate”, and I tend to agree. But this T.S. Eliot didn’t. Hope is the difference. You wouldn’t keep trying if you didn’t think it was worth it, after all. There is a significant change in his worldview.\n\nI love this passage not only because it speaks to me as a writer, but also because I sense this is actually Eliot talking, not the speaker. It’s rare to get these vulnerable glimpses of the man behind the poet, and it draws me closer to him, hearing him wonder on the page if he wasted twenty years, if his work matters, if he matters.\n\nT.S. Eliot may be intimidating, but the irony is that he’s so human in his questions and observations. There are passages in the Four Quartets that completely stump me, and others that make me laugh out loud with how in touch he is with human behaviour:\n\nThe tolling bell\n\nMeasures time not our time, rung by the unhurried\n\nGround swell, a time\n\nOlder than the time of chronometers, older\n\nThan time counted by anxious worried women\n\nLying awake, calculating the future,\n\nTrying to unweave, unwind, unravel\n\nAnd piece together the past and the future….\n\nPerhaps the biggest joy I had in reading the Four Quartets was discovering he was the author of a phrase I had heard before and cherished, and never knew it was him who had penned it (it’s not the Julian of Norwich reference, but the first four lines). This is the stanza that ends the Four Quartets and which I never would have guessed came from the T.S. Eliot I studied in school. People change, and all his searching, questioning, and exploring led him to a beautiful place."
