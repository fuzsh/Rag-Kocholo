To his many friends and colleagues, Phillips was an inspirational and gracious person who combined a deep intellect, a lively spirit, and a generous heart that matched his passionate interest in the geophysical sciences. Phillips was born on 30 December 1930 in Parramatta, N. S. W., Australia. In 1948 he enrolled in the University of Sydney, where he earned a B.S. in applied mathematics in 1952. That same year, he joined the Cavendish Laboratory at Cambridge University as a research student, where he began to apply to the ocean concepts in turbulent flow recently developed by Andrei Kolmogorov, G. I. Taylor, and George Batchelor. While attending the 1956 celebration of Taylor's seventieth birthday, Phillips heard Fritz Ursell declare that âthe process by which ocean waves are generated by the wind cannot be regarded as known.â In 1957 the Journal of Fluid Mechanics contained two remarkable papers offering contrasting theories for ocean wave generation. One paper, by the applied mathematician John Miles (J. Fluid Mech., 2(5), 417-445, 1957), proposed that energy transfer from the air to the sea occurs at a critical layer in the atmosphere boundary layer. The other paper, by Phillips, then 26 years old (J. Fluid Mech., 3(2), 185-204, 1957), proposed that turbulent pressure fluctuations in the wind resonate with propagating ocean waves, forcing them to grow. Together these became known as the Phillips-Miles process, and it was the opening salvo in Phillips's 50-year career of innovative contributions to geophysics through fluid mechanics.\n\nJ. Robert Oppenheimer - A Life\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPais, Abraham; Crease, Robert P.\n\n2006-04-01\n\nThe late Abraham Pais wrote the definitive biography of Albert Einstein, \"Subtle is the Lord,\" which won an American Book Award. As a distinguished physicist and Einstein's colleague, Pais combined a sophisticated understanding of physics with first-hand knowledge of this notoriously private individual, offering rare insights into both. It is his unique double perspective that makes his work so valuable. Now Abraham Pais offers an illuminating portrait of another eminent colleague, J. Robert Oppenheimer, one of the most charismatic and enigmatic figures of modern physics. Pais introduces us to a precocious youth who sped through Harvard in three years, made signal contributions to quantum mechanics while in his twenties, and was instrumental in the growth of American physics in the decade before the Second World War, almost single-handedly putting American physics on the map. Pais paints a revealing portrait of Oppenheimer's life in Los Alamos, where in twenty remarkable, feverish months, under his inspired leadership, the first atomic bomb was designed and built, a success that made Oppenheimer America's most famous scientist. Pais, who was his next-door neighbor for many years, describes Oppenheimer's long tenure as Director of the Institute of Advanced Study at Princeton, but also shows how Oppenheimer's intensity and arrogance won him powerful enemies, who would ultimately make him one of the principal victims of the Red Scare of the 1950s. Told with compassion and deep insight, J. Robert Oppenheimer is the most comprehensive biography of the great physicist available. It is Abraham Pais's final work, completed after his death by Robert P. Crease, an acclaimed historian of science in his own right.\n\nPhillips during EVA\n\nNASA Image and Video Library\n\n2005-08-18\n\nISS011-E-11948 (18 August 2005) --- Attired in a Russian Orlan spacesuit, astronaut John L.

O.; Giguere, T.\n\n2017-01-01\n\nRecent remote sensing studies have identified complex volcanism in the floor-fractured crater (FFC) Oppenheimer U, located in the northwest floor of Oppenheimer crater (35.2degS, 166.3degW, 208 km dia., Figure 1) within the \"South Pole - Aitken basin\" (SPA) region of the lunar far side. Up to 15 sites of pyroclastic volcanism have been identified in the floor of Oppenheimer crater. Studies of Moon Mineralogy Mapper data (M3, 0.4-3 microns, 86 bands, [5]) indicated that the pyroclastic deposits are comprised of mixtures of clinopyroxene and iron-rich glass, with the Oppenheimer U deposit showing variable composition within the FFC and having the most iron-rich volcanic glass thus far identified on the Moon. Here we examine the floor of Oppenheimer U in more detail and show evidence for possible multiple eruptive vents.\n\nPhillips Laboratory Geophysics Scholar Program\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n1993-09-30\n\nresearch at Phillips Laboratory .

In 1888, he published a paper that outlined how the assessment of music skills in patients with aphasia could lead to a better understanding of aphasia and language. Oppenheim conducted the first comprehensive music assessment as part of a neurologic examination and presented the first case series of music in aphasia. His paper was widely cited and had significant influence over the next 30 years. Although largely unrecognized as such, Oppenheim was an important historical figure in the study of music and neurology.\n\nPhillips during EVA\n\nNASA Image and Video Library\n\n2005-08-18\n\nISS011-E-11958 (18 August 2005) --- Attired in a Russian Orlan spacesuit, astronaut John L.

Linear scaling with a low pre-factor is achieved using density matrix purification with sparse matrix algebra and a numerical threshold on matrix elements. The extended Lagrangian Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics formalism [A. M. N. Niklasson, Phys. Rev. Lett. 100, 123004 (2008)] yields microcanonical trajectories with the approximate forces obtained from the linear scaling method that exhibit no systematic drift over hundreds of picoseconds and which are indistinguishable from trajectories computed using exact forces.\n\nSomething Incredibly Wonderful Happens: Frank Oppenheimer and the World He Made Up\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nK.C.

As a general account, it is intended to apply equally well to both non-human and human interactions which are prima facie communicative in character. However, so far, Scott-Phillips has provided little detail regarding how his account is supposed to apply to the latter set of cases. After presenting what I take to be the most plausible way of filling in those details, I argue that his account would appear to be too narrow: it (minimally) fails to capture a range of human interactions which strike us as instances of communication. To wit, these are cases in which some but not all of the information an act is designed to convey to a reactor actually reaches that reactor. An alternative account incorporating Scott-Phillips' main insights is then sketched, and it is suggested that this account, or something like it, would accommodate the full range of non-human and human interactions that are intuitively communicative.\n\nOn the orthogonal dissipative lax-phillips scattering theory\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nNeidhardt, Hagen\n\n1988-08-01\n\nThe paper is devoted to the so-called orthogonal dissipative Lax-Phillips scattering theory. A parametrization of all possible orthogonal dissipative Lax-Phillips scattering theories is obtained in terms of ordered 6-tuples consisting of unilateral shifts and contractions which can be, roughly speaking, freely chosen. In this parametrization the wave and scattering operators as well as the scattering matrix are explicitly calculated. Moreover, a description of all analytical contraction-valued functions admitting a Darlington synthesis is found.\n\nBorn-Oppenheimer approximation for a singular system\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAkbas, Haci; Turgut, O. Teoman\n\n2018-01-01\n\nWe discuss a simple singular system in one dimension, two heavy particles interacting with a light particle via an attractive contact interaction and not interacting among themselves. It is natural to apply the Born-Oppenheimer approximation to this problem. We present a detailed discussion of this approach; the advantage of this simple model is that one can estimate the error terms self-consistently. Moreover, a Fock space approach to this problem is presented where an expansion can be proposed to get higher order corrections. A slight modification of the same problem in which the light particle is relativistic is discussed in a later section by neglecting pair creation processes. Here, the second quantized description is more challenging, but with some care, one can recover the first order expression exactly.\n\nEstimated Rock Abundance and Thermophysical Parameters in Oppenheimer Crater on the Moon\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBauch, Karin E.; Hiesinger, Harald; Ivanov, Mikhail; van der Bogert, Carolyn H.; Pasckert, Jan-Hendrik; Weinauer, Julia\n\n2016-04-01\n\nOppenheimer crater is located in the north-east of the South Pole-Aitken basin (SPA), the largest impact structure on the Moon [e.g., 1]. The crater is Ë215km in diameter and has an estimated age of Ë4.1 Ga [2]. The floor of Oppenheimer shows evidence of dark mantling deposits and a concentric system of graben structures close to the rim of the crater [3]. Image and topography data show that the floor is flat apart from the graben structures and subsequent impacts on the floor. Oppenheimer-U (Ë40km) and -H (Ë35km) are floor-fractured craters within the north-west and south-east portions of Oppenheimer crater [3]. Dark mantling deposits on the floor are associated with the graben system. [3] estimated an age between Ë3.98Ga and Ë3.66Ga for the pyroclastic activity, based on crater size-frequency distribution (CSFD) measurements on Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) WAC and NAC images. In this study we compare the mapping results of [3] with temperature data of the LRO Diviner experiment [4] using a numerical model [5, 6]. Nighttime temperature variations are directly influenced by the surface and subsurface thermophysical properties, namely bulk density, heat capacity, and thermal conductivity [7, 8]. These properties can be summarized to a thermal inertia, which represents the ability to conduct and store heat [8]. Low thermal inertia units, such as dust and other fine grained material, quickly respond to temperature changes, which results in large temperature amplitudes between the lunar day and night. On the other hand, high thermal inertia material, e.g. rocks or bedrock, take more time to heat up during the day and reradiate the heat during the night [8]. Relative rock abundances are derived from temperature measurements of the same location at different wavelengths. Brightness temperatures are a function of wavelength and increase with decreasing wavelength [9, 10]. This nonlinearity of the Planck radiance can be used to determine the amount of\n\n7.

N.; Gaddis, Lisa R.; Greenhagen, Benjamin T.; Allen, Carlton C.; Hayne, Paul O.; Bell, James F.; Paige, David A.\n\n2016-07-01\n\nOppenheimer crater is a floor-fractured crater located within the South Pole-Aitken basin on the Moon, and exhibits more than a dozen localized pyroclastic deposits associated with the fractures. Localized pyroclastic volcanism on the Moon is thought to form as a result of intermittently explosive Vulcanian eruptions under low effusion rates, in contrast to the higher-effusion rate, Hawaiian-style fire fountaining inferred to form larger regional deposits. We use Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera images and Diviner Radiometer mid-infrared data, Chandrayaan-1 orbiter Moon Mineralogy Mapper near-infrared spectra, and Clementine orbiter Ultraviolet/visible camera images to test the hypothesis that the pyroclastic deposits in Oppenheimer crater were emplaced via Vulcanian activity by constraining their composition and mineralogy. Mineralogically, we find that the deposits are variable mixtures of orthopyroxene and minor clinopyroxene sourced from the crater floor, juvenile clinopyroxene, and juvenile iron-rich glass, and that the mineralogy of the pyroclastics varies both across the Oppenheimer deposits as a whole and within individual deposits. We observe similar variability in the inferred iron content of pyroclastic glasses, and note in particular that the northwest deposit, associated with Oppenheimer U crater, contains the most iron-rich volcanic glass thus far identified on the Moon, which could be a useful future resource. We propose that this variability in mineralogy indicates variability in eruption style, and that it cannot be explained by a simple Vulcanian eruption. A Vulcanian eruption should cause significant country rock to be incorporated into the pyroclastic deposit; however, large areas within many of the deposits exhibit spectra consistent with high abundances of juvenile phases and very little floor material. Thus, we propose that at least the most recent portion of these deposits must have erupted via a Strombolian or more continuous fire\n\n78 FR 11633 - Application To Export Electric Energy; ConocoPhillips Company\n\nFederal Register 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014\n\n2013-02-19\n\n...Phillips Company AGENCY: Office of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability, DOE.

Robert Oppenheimer: Why Did the Scientific Community Miss the Black Hole Opportunity?\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nOrtega-RodrÃ­guez, M.; SolÃ­s-SÃ¡nchez, H.; Boza-Oviedo, E.; Chaves-Cruz, K.; Guevara-Bertsch, M.; QuirÃ³s-Rojas, M.; Vargas-HernÃ¡ndez, S.; Venegas-Li, A.\n\n2017-04-01\n\nWe assess the scientific value of Oppenheimer's research on black holes in order to explain its neglect by the scientific community, and even by Oppenheimer himself. Looking closely at the scientific culture and conceptual belief system of the 1930s, the present article seeks to supplement the existing literature by enriching the explanations and complicating the guiding questions. We suggest a rereading of Oppenheimer as a figure both more intriguing for the history of astrophysics and further ahead of his time than is commonly supposed.\n\nDiagonal Born-Oppenheimer correction for coupled-cluster wave-functions\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nShamasundar, K. R.\n\n2018-06-01\n\nWe examine how geometry-dependent normalisation freedom of electronic wave-functions affects extraction of a meaningful diagonal Born-Oppenheimer correction (DBOC) to the ground-state Born-Oppenheimer potential energy surface (PES). By viewing this freedom as a kind of gauge-freedom, it is shown that DBOC and the resulting associated mass-dependent adiabatic PES are gauge-invariant quantities. A sum-over-states (SOS) formula for DBOC which explicitly exhibits this invariance is derived. A biorthogonal formulation suitable for DBOC computations using standard unnormalised coupled-cluster (CC) wave-functions is presented. This is shown to lead to a biorthogonal version of SOS formula with similar properties. On this basis, different computational schemes for evaluating DBOC using approximate CC wave-functions are derived. One of this agrees with the formula used in the current literature. The connection to adiabatic-to-diabatic transformations in non-adiabatic dynamics is explored and complications arising from biorthogonal nature of CC theory are identified.\n\nSummary of reported agriculture and irrigation water use in Phillips County, Arkansas, 1991\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nHolland, T.W.; Manning, C.A.; Stafford, K.L.\n\n1993-01-01\n\nThis report summarizes the 1991 water-use reporting through the Conservation District Office in Phillips County, Arkansas.

Localized pyroclastic volcanism on the Moon is thought to form as a result of intermittently explosive Vulcanian eruptions under low effusion rates, in contrast to the higher-effusion rate, Hawaiian-style fire fountaining inferred to form larger regional deposits. We use Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera images and Diviner Radiometer mid-infrared data, Chandrayaan-1 orbiter Moon Mineralogy Mapper near-infrared spectra, and Clementine orbiter Ultraviolet/Visible camera images to test the hypothesis that the pyroclastic deposits in Oppenheimer crater were emplaced via Vulcanian activity by constraining their composition and mineralogy. Mineralogically, we find that the deposits are variable mixtures of orthopyroxene and minor clinopyroxene sourced from the crater floor, juvenile clinopyroxene, and juvenile iron-rich glass, and that the mineralogy of the pyroclastics varies both across the Oppenheimer deposits as a whole and within individual deposits. We observe similar variability in the inferred iron content of pyroclastic glasses, and note in particular that the northwest deposit, associated with Oppenheimer U crater, contains the most iron-rich volcanic glass thus far identified on the Moon, which could be a useful future resource. We propose that this variability in mineralogy indicates variability in eruption style, and that it cannot be explained by a simple Vulcanian eruption. A Vulcanian eruption should cause significant country rock to be incorporated into the pyroclastic deposit; however, large areas within many of the deposits exhibit spectra consistent with high abundances of juvenile phases and very little floor material. Thus, we propose that at least the most recent portion of these deposits must have erupted via a Strombolian or more continuous fire\n\nOn the mathematical treatment of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nJecko, Thierry, E-mail: thierry.jecko@u-cergy.fr\n\n2014-05-15\n\nMotivated by the paper by Sutcliffe and Woolley [âOn the quantum theory of molecules,â J.

K. U.; Vuilleumier, Rodolphe\n\n2017-07-01\n\nDescribing the dynamics of nuclei in molecules requires a potential energy surface, which is traditionally provided by the Born-Oppenheimer or adiabatic approximation. However, we also need to assign masses to the nuclei. There, the Born-Oppenheimer picture does not account for the inertia of the electrons, and only bare nuclear masses are considered. Nowadays, experimental accuracy challenges the theoretical predictions of rotational and vibrational spectra and requires the participation of electrons in the internal motion of the molecule. More than 80 years after the original work of Born and Oppenheimer, this issue has still not been solved, in general. Here, we present a theoretical and numerical framework to address this problem in a general and rigorous way. Starting from the exact factorization of the electron-nuclear wave function, we include electronic effects beyond the Born-Oppenheimer regime in a perturbative way via position-dependent corrections to the bare nuclear masses. This maintains an adiabaticlike point of view: The nuclear degrees of freedom feel the presence of the electrons via a single potential energy surface, whereas the inertia of electrons is accounted for and the total mass of the system is recovered. This constitutes a general framework for describing the mass acquired by slow degrees of freedom due to the inertia of light, bounded particles; thus, it is applicable not only in electron-nuclear systems but in light-heavy nuclei or ions as well. We illustrate this idea with a model of proton transfer, where the light particle is the proton and the heavy particles are the oxygen atoms to which the proton is bounded. Inclusion of the light-particle inertia allows us to gain orders of magnitude in accuracy. The electron-nuclear perspective is adopted, instead, to calculate position-dependent mass corrections using density functional theory for a few polyatomic molecules at their equilibrium geometry. These data can serve as input for the\n\nPhillips removes Failed RPCM (Remote Power Controller Module)\n\nNASA Image and Video Library\n\n2005-09-20\n\nISS011-E-13361 (20 September 2005) --- Astronaut John L.

The equations of motion are derived directly from the extended Lagrangian under the condition of an adiabatic separation between the nuclear and the electronic degrees of freedom. We show how this separation is automatically fulfilled and system independent. The generalized equations of motion require only one diagonalization per time step and are applicable to a broader range of materials with improved accuracy and stability compared to previous formulations.\n\nGeneralized Born-Oppenheimer treatment of Jahn-Teller systems in Hilbert spaces of arbitrary dimension: theory and application to a three-state model potential.\n\nPubMed\n\nVarandas, A J C; Sarkar, B\n\n2011-05-14\n\nGeneralized Born-Oppenheimer equations including the geometrical phase effect are derived for three- and four-fold electronic manifolds in Jahn-Teller systems near the degeneracy seam.

Each of these spacecraft fulfills a unique set of program requirements. These program requirements range from a short-lived `one-of-a-kind' mission to the robust multi- mission role. Because of these diverging requirements, each program is driven to use a different design philosophy. But regardless of their design, there is the underlying fact that small satellites do not always equate to small missions. These spacecraft with their use of or ability to insert new technologies provide more capabilities and services for their respective payloads which allows the expansion of their mission role. These varying program efforts culminate in an ATSSB spacecraft bus approach that will support moderate size payloads, up to 500 pounds, in a large set of orbits while satisfying the `cheaper, faster, better' method of doing business. This technical paper provides an overview of each of the five spacecraft, focusing on the objectives, payoffs, technologies demonstrated, and program status.\n\n78 FR 53137 - Flint Hills Resources Alaska, LLC, BP Pipelines (Alaska) Inc., ConocoPhillips Transportation...\n\nFederal Register 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014\n\n2013-08-28\n\n...

However, the terminology used in connection with the basic approximations is variously, and somewhat confusingly, represented with such phrases as \"adiabatic\", \"Born-Oppenheimer\", or \"Born-Oppenheimer adiabatic\" approximation. Concerning the closely relevant and important Franck-Condon principle (FCP), the IUPAC definition differentiates between a classical and quantum mechanical formulation. Consequently, in many publications we find terms such as \"Franck-Condon (excited) state\", or a vertical transition to the \"Franck-Condon point\" with the \"Franck-Condon geometry\" that relaxes to the excited-state equilibrium geometry. The Born-Oppenheimer approximation and the \"classical\" model of the Franck-Condon principle are typical examples of misused terms and lax interpretations of the original theories. In this essay, we revisit the original publications of pioneers of the PES concept and the FCP to help stimulate a lively discussion and clearer thinking around these important concepts.

Electrons and nuclei are treated equally in terms of the parametrization of the non-relativistic total wave function, which is written as a linear combination of basis functions constructed from explicitly correlated Gaussian functions and the global vector representation. The integrals of the electric transition dipole moment are derived corresponding to these basis functions in both the length and the velocity representation. The calculations are performed in laboratory-fixed Cartesian coordinates without relying on coordinates which separate the center of mass from the translationally invariant degrees of freedom. The effect of the overall motion is eliminated through translationally invariant integral expressions. The electric transition dipole moment is calculated between two rovibronic levels of the H2 molecule assignable to the lowest rovibrational states of the X (1)Î£(g)(+) and B (1)Î£(u)(+) electronic states in the clamped-nuclei framework. This is the first evaluation of this quantity in a full quantum mechanical treatment without relying on the Born-Oppenheimer approximation.\n\nCoherent states, quantum gravity, and the Born-Oppenheimer approximation.

The analysis presented here fits into a rather general framework and offers a solution to the problem of applying the usual Born-Oppenheimer ansatz for molecular (or structurally analogous) systems to more general quantum systems (e.g., spin-orbit models) by means of space adiabatic perturbation theory. The proposed solution is applied to a simple, finite dimensional model of interacting spin systems,moreÂ Â» which serves as a non-trivial, minimal model of the aforesaid problem.

The use of narrow Raman resonances and careful examination of systematic shifts enabled us to measure 13 bound-state energies for three isotopologues of the ground-state ytterbium molecule with standard uncertainties of the order of 500 Hz. The atomic interactions are modeled using an ab initio based mass-scaled Born-Oppenheimer potential whose long-range van der Waals parameters and total WKB phase are fitted to experimental data. We find that the quality of the fit of this model, of about 112.9 kHz (rms) can be significantly improved by adding the recently calculated beyond-Born-Oppenheimer (BBO) adiabatic corrections [J. J. Lutz and J. M. Hutson, J. Mol. Spectrosc. 330, 43 (2016), 10.1016/j.jms.2016.08.007] and by partially treating the nonadiabatic effects using distance-dependent reduced masses. Our BBO interaction model represents the experimental data to within about 30.2 kHz on average, which is 3.7 times better than the \"reference\" Born-Oppenheimer model. We calculate the s -wave scattering lengths for bosonic isotopic pairs of ytterbium atoms with error bars over two orders of magnitude smaller than previous determinations. For example, the s -wave scattering length for 174Yb is +5.55812 (50 ) nm.\n\nPhillips exercises with RED in Node 1/Unity module\n\nNASA Image and Video Library\n\n2005-05-18\n\nISS011-E-06404 (18 May 2005) --- Astronaut John L.

The particle and the medium are modeled by a set of harmonic oscillators. The dynamic interaction of the particle with a single local mode is treated explicitly without the use of BOA. Two particular situations (symmetric and non-symmetric systems) are considered. It is shown that the difference between the exact solution and the true BOA is negligibly small at realistic parameters of the model. However, the exact results differ considerably from those of the crude Condon approximation (CCA) which is usually considered in the literature as a reference point for BOA (Marcus-Hush-Dogonadze formula). It is shown that the exact rate constant can be smaller (symmetric system) or larger (non-symmetric one) than that obtained in CCA. The non-Condon effects are also studied.\n\nSynthetic Minor NSR Permit: ConocoPhillips Company - Sunnyside Compressor Station\n\nEPA Pesticide Factsheets\n\nThis page contains the response to public comments and the final synthetic minor NSR permit for the ConocoPhillips Company, Sunnyside Compressor Station, located on the Southern Ute Indian Reservation in La Plata County, CO.\n\nSynthetic Minor NSR Permit: ConocoPhillips Company - Ute Compressor Station\n\nEPA Pesticide Factsheets\n\nThis page contains the response to public comments and the final synthetic minor NSR permit for the ConocoPhillips Company, Ute Compressor Station, located on the Southern Ute Indian Reservation in La Plata County, CO.\n\nSynthetic Minor NSR Permit: ConocoPhillips Company - Argenta Compressor Station\n\nEPA Pesticide Factsheets\n\nThis page contains the response to public comments and the final synthetic minor NSR permit for the ConocoPhillips Company, Argenta Compressor Station, located on the Southern Ute Indian Reservation in La Plata County, CO.\n\nA modified Lax-Phillips scattering theory for quantum mechanics\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nStrauss, Y., E-mail: ystrauss@cs.bgu.ac.il\n\nThe Lax-Phillips scattering theory is an appealing abstract framework for the analysis of scattering resonances. Quantum mechanical adaptations of the theory have been proposed. However, since these quantum adaptations essentially retain the original structure of the theory, assuming the existence of incoming and outgoing subspaces for the evolution and requiring the spectrum of the generator of evolution to be unbounded from below, their range of applications is rather limited. In this paper, it is shown that if we replace the assumption regarding the existence of incoming and outgoing subspaces by the assumption of the existence of Lyapunov operators for themoreÂ Â» quantum evolution (the existence of which has been proved for certain classes of quantum mechanical scattering problems), then it is possible to construct a structure analogous to the Lax-Phillips structure for scattering problems for which the spectrum of the generator of evolution is bounded from below.Â«Â less\n\nClarifying the Dynamics of the General Circulation: Phillips's 1956 Experiment.\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLewis, John M.\n\n1998-01-01\n\nIn the mid-1950s, amid heated debate over the physical mechanisms that controlled the known features of the atmosphere's general circulation, Norman Phillips simulated hemispheric motion on the high-speed computer at the Institute for Advanced Study. A simple energetically consistent model was integrated for a simulated time of approximately 1 month. Analysis of the model results clarified the respective roles of the synoptic-scale eddies (cyclones-anticyclones) and mean meridional circulation in the maintenance of the upper-level westerlies and the surface wind regimes. Furthermore, the modeled cyclones clearly linked surface frontogenesis with the upper-level Charney-Eady wave. In addition to discussing the model results in light of the controversy and ferment that surrounded general circulation theory in the 1940s-1950s, an effort is made to follow Phillips's scientific path to the experiment.\n\nHarry S.

Follow-up observations are made using the 16-inch DFM telescopes at the Phillips Academy Observatory and at the HUT Observatory near Eagle, Colorado, as well as with a remote-access 20-inch at New Mexico Skies Observatory near Mayhill, New Mexico. The Catalina Sky Survey can provide additional photometric measurements. Confirmed variables, with light curves and periods, are submitted to the International Variable Star Index and Journal of the American Association of Variable Star Observers. Asteroid rotation studies are published in Minor Planet Bulletin.\n\nPhillips at Robotics Workstation (RWS) in US Laboratory Destiny\n\nNASA Image and Video Library\n\n2009-03-20\n\nS119-E-006748 (20 March 2009) --- Astronauts Lee Archambault, (foreground), STS-119 commander, John Phillips and Sandra Magnus, both mission specialists, are pictured at the robotic workstation in Destiny or the U.S. laboratory.

The extended Lagrangian framework enables the geometric integration of both the nuclear and electronic degrees of freedom. This provides highly efficient simulations that are stable and energy conserving even under incomplete and approximate self-consistent field (SCF) convergence. We investigate three different geometric integration schemes: (1) regular time reversible Verlet, (2) second order optimal symplectic, and (3) third order optimal symplectic. We look at energy conservation, accuracy, and stability as a function of dissipation, integration time step, and SCF convergence. We find that the inclusion of dissipation in the symplectic integration methods gives an efficient damping of numerical noise or perturbations that otherwise may accumulate from finite arithmetics in a perfect reversible dynamics.

It is founded on the observation that the energy scale of the electron dynamics in a molecule is larger than that of the nuclei. A very similar physical picture can be used to describe QCD states containing heavy quarks as well as light-quarks or gluonic excitations. In this work, we derive the Born-Oppenheimer approximation for QED molecular systems in an effective field theory framework by sequentially integrating out degrees of freedom living at energies above the typical energy scale where the dynamics of the heavy degrees of freedom occurs. In particular, we compute the matching coefficients of the effective field theory for the case of the H2+ diatomic molecule that are relevant to compute its spectrum up to O (m Î±5). Ultrasoft photon loops contribute at this order, being ultimately responsible for the molecular Lamb shift. In the effective field theory the scaling of all the operators is homogeneous, which facilitates the determination of all the relevant contributions, an observation that may become useful for high-precision calculations. Using the above case as a guidance, we construct under some conditions an effective field theory for QCD states formed by a color-octet heavy quark-antiquark pair bound with a color-octet light-quark pair or excited gluonic state, highlighting the similarities and differences between the QED and QCD systems. Assuming that the multipole expansion is applicable, we construct the heavy-quark potential up to next-to-leading order in the multipole expansion in terms of nonperturbative matching coefficients to be obtained from lattice QCD.\n\nCombined neural network/Phillips-Tikhonov approach to aerosol retrievals over land from the NASA Research Scanning Polarimeter\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDi Noia, Antonio; Hasekamp, Otto P.; Wu, Lianghai; van Diedenhoven, Bastiaan; Cairns, Brian; Yorks, John E.\n\n2017-11-01\n\nIn this paper, an algorithm for the retrieval of aerosol and land surface properties from airborne spectropolarimetric measurements - combining neural networks and an iterative scheme based on Phillips-Tikhonov regularization - is described. The algorithm - which is an extension of a scheme previously designed for ground-based retrievals - is applied to measurements from the Research Scanning Polarimeter (RSP) on board the NASA ER-2 aircraft. A neural network, trained on a large data set of synthetic measurements, is applied to perform aerosol retrievals from real RSP data, and the neural network retrievals are subsequently used as a first guess for the Phillips-Tikhonov retrieval. The resulting algorithm appears capable of accurately retrieving aerosol optical thickness, fine-mode effective radius and aerosol layer height from RSP data. Among the advantages of using a neural network as initial guess for an iterative algorithm are a decrease in processing time and an increase in the number of converging retrievals.\n\nSemiempirical evaluation of post-Hartree-Fock diagonal-Born-Oppenheimer corrections for organic molecules.\n\nPubMed\n\nMohallem, JosÃ© R\n\n2008-04-14\n\nRecent post-Hartree-Fock calculations of the diagonal-Born-Oppenheimer correction empirically show that it behaves quite similar to atomic nuclear mass corrections. An almost constant contribution per electron is identified, which converges with system size for specific series of organic molecules. This feature permits pocket-calculator evaluation of the corrections within thermochemical accuracy (10(-1) mhartree or kcal/mol).\n\nMore Than 100 Gather to Honor Joost Oppenheim on His 80th Birthday | Poster\n\nCancer.gov\n\nBy Nancy Parrish, Staff Writer They came from as far away as Russia and Japan, and from as nearby as the NCI at Frederick/Fort Detrick campus, Bethesda, and Baltimore, all with one purpose: to honor the mentor, colleague, and friend they have in Joost Oppenheim, as he celebrated his 80th birthday.\n\n33 CFR 165.1709 - Security Zones: Liquefied Natural Gas Tanker Transits and Operations at Phillips Petroleum LNG...\n\nCode of Federal Regulations, 2010 CFR\n\n2010-07-01\n\n...: Liquefied Natural Gas Tanker Transits and Operations at Phillips Petroleum LNG Pier, Cook Inlet, AK.

Several widely available electronic structure software packages are used to calculate the leading contributions to the total isotope shift for commonly occurring isotopologs of each species. Computed quantities include diagonal Born-Oppenheimer corrections (mass shifts) and isotopic field shifts. Mass shifts dominate for light nuclei up to and including K, but field shifts contribute significantly for Rb and Sr and are dominant for Yb. We compare the ab initio mass-shift functions for Li2, LiK and LiRb with spectroscopically derived ground-state BOB functions from the literature. We find good agreement in the values of the functions for LiK and LiRb at their equilibrium geometries, but significant disagreement with the shapes of the functions for all 3 systems. The differences may be due to contributions of nonadiabatic terms to the empirical BOB functions. We present a semiclassical model for the effect of BOB corrections on the binding energies of near-threshold states and the positions of zero-energy Feshbach resonances.\n\nExperiments on waves under impulsive wind forcing in view of the Phillips (1957) theory\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nShemer, Lev; Zavadsky, Andrey\n\n2016-11-01\n\nOnly limited information is currently available on the initial stages of wind-waves growth from rest under sudden wind forcing; the mechanisms leading to the appearance of waves are still not well understood. In the present work, waves emerging in a small-scale laboratory facility under the action of step-like turbulent wind forcing are studied using capacitance and laser slope gauges. Measurements are performed at a number of fetches and for a range of wind velocities. Taking advantage of the fully automated experimental procedure, at least 100 independent realizations are recorded for each wind velocity at every fetch. The accumulated data sets allow calculating ensemble-averaged values of the measured parameters as a function of time elapsed from the blower activation. The accumulated results on the temporal variation of wind-wave field initially at rest allow quantitative comparison with the theory of Phillips (1957). Following Phillips, appearance of the initial detectable ripples was considered first, while the growth of short gravity waves at later times was analyzed separately. Good qualitative and partial quantitative agreement between the Phillips predictions and the measurements was obtained for both those stages of the initial wind-wave field evolution.\n\nVibrationally averaged post Born-Oppenheimer isotopic dipole moment calculations approaching spectroscopic accuracy.\n\nPubMed\n\nArapiraca, A F C; Jonsson, Dan; Mohallem, J R\n\n2011-12-28\n\nWe report an upgrade of the Dalton code to include post Born-Oppenheimer nuclear mass corrections in the calculations of (ro-)vibrational averages of molecular properties. These corrections are necessary to achieve an accuracy of 10(-4) debye in the calculations of isotopic dipole moments. Calculations on the self-consistent field level present this accuracy, while numerical instabilities compromise correlated calculations. Applications to HD, ethane, and ethylene isotopologues are implemented, all of them approaching the experimental values.\n\nPhillips and Acaba with Lithium Hydroxide (LiOH) canisters on Middeck (MDDK)\n\nNASA Image and Video Library\n\n2009-03-19\n\nS119-E-006645 (19 March 2009) --- Astronauts John Phillips (left) and Joseph Acaba, both STS-119 mission specialists, work with the lithium hydroxide (LiOH) canisters beneath Space Shuttle Discovery's middeck while docked with the International Space Station.\n\n3.

It is known that, generically, modifications to general relativity affect the bulk properties of neutron stars, e.g. their masses and radii, in a way that depends on the specific choice of theory. In this presentation we review a theory-agnostic approach to model relativistic stars, called the post-Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff formalism. Drawing inspiration from the parametrized post-Newtonian formalism, this framework allows us to describe perturbative deviations from general relativity in the structure of neutrons stars in a parametrized manner. We show that a variety of astrophysical observables (namely the surface redshift, the apparent radius, the Eddington luminosity and the orbital frequency of particles in geodesic motion around neutron stars) can be parametrized using only two parameters.\n\nbbÌ udÌ four-quark systems in the Born-Oppenheimer approximation: prospects and challenges\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPeters, Antje; Bicudo, Pedro; Wagner, Marc\n\n2018-03-01\n\nWe summarize previous work on bÌ bÌ ud four-quark systems in the Born-Oppenheimer approximation and discuss first steps towards an extension to the theoretically more challenging bbÌ udÌ system.

This month's issue features her fourth poem in this journal, titled \"Autumn Chores\" (Phillips, 2015). We were interested in learning more about Julie's creative writing, why she writes poetry, how she balances writing and a demanding academic medical career, and what she hopes her poems might contribute to clinical practice and medical education. Colleen Fogarty interviewed her to find out the answers in this article. Julie's poems are indeed, as she says, carved from small moments in time, but they have a disproportionately large emotional impact. Her poems tackle issues such as the tension between medical and parental authority; professional boundaries; worklife balance; the still-gaping holes in our health care system; and what it means to care for others.

Tobias as an anatomist.\n\nPubMed\n\nStrkalj, Goran; Pather, Nalini\n\n2013-05-01\n\nThe article outlines the career of the renowned South African scientist Phillip Vallentine Tobias. While he made substantial contributions to a number of scientific disciplines, Tobias spent most of his career teaching anatomy at his alma mater, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, and saw himself primarily as an anatomist. The first part of this article presents Tobias' major contributions to science and demonstrates that his profound knowledge of anatomy was the basis of many of his groundbreaking research accomplishments. The second part of the article focuses on Tobias' career in anatomy and his significant contribution to anatomy teaching and administration, particularly in establishing and organizing the Anatomical Society of Southern Africa. The article also demonstrates how Tobias' academic career was constrained by the oppressive system of apartheid South Africa and how social engagement was an integral part of his intellectual activities.

In previous work [K. Glampedakis, G. Pappas, H. O. Silva, and E. Berti, Phys. Rev. D 92, 024056 (2015)], we developed a \"post-TOV\" formalismâinspired by parametrized post-Newtonian theoryâwhich allows us to classify in a parametrized, phenomenological form all possible perturbative deviations from the structure of compact stars in general relativity that may be induced by modified gravity at second post-Newtonian order. In this paper we extend the formalism to deal with the stellar exterior, and we compute several potential astrophysical observables within the post-TOV formalism: the surface redshift zs, the apparent radius Rapp, the Eddington luminosity at infinity LEâ and the orbital frequencies. We show that, at leading order, all of these quantities depend on just two post-TOV parameters Î¼1 and Ï , and we discuss the possibility to measure (or set upper bounds on) these parameters.\n\nBorn Oppenheimer potential energy for interaction of antihydrogen with molecular hydrogen\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nStrasburger, Krzysztof\n\n2005-09-01\n\nInelastic collisions with hydrogen molecules are claimed to be an important channel of antihydrogen (\\\\overlineH) losses (Armour and Zeman 1999 Int.

One attractive approach to meet both daunting tasks is Born-Oppenheimer ab initio QM/MM molecular dynamics simulation (aiQM/MM-MD) with umbrella sampling. In this chapter, we describe our recently developed pseudobond Q-ChemâAmber interface, which employs a combined electrostatic-mechanical embedding scheme with periodic boundary condition and the particle mesh Ewald method for long-range electrostatics interactions. In our implementation, Q-Chem and the sander module of Amber are combined at the source code level without using system calls, and all necessary data communications between QM and MM calculations are achieved via computer memory. We demonstrate the applicability of this pseudobond Q-ChemâAmber interface by presenting two examples, one reaction in aqueous solution and one enzyme reaction. Finally, we describe our established aiQM/MM-MD enzyme simulation protocol, which has been successfully applied to study more than a dozen enzymes. PMID:27498636\n\nNon-adiabatic effects in thermochemistry, spectroscopy and kinetics: the general importance of all three Born-Oppenheimer breakdown corrections.\n\nPubMed\n\nReimers, Jeffrey R; McKemmish, Laura K; McKenzie, Ross H; Hush, Noel S\n\n2015-10-14\n\nUsing a simple model Hamiltonian, the three correction terms for Born-Oppenheimer (BO) breakdown, the adiabatic diagonal correction (DC), the first-derivative momentum non-adiabatic correction (FD), and the second-derivative kinetic-energy non-adiabatic correction (SD), are shown to all contribute to thermodynamic and spectroscopic properties as well as to thermal non-diabatic chemical reaction rates. While DC often accounts for >80% of thermodynamic and spectroscopic property changes, the commonly used practice of including only the FD correction in kinetics calculations is rarely found to be adequate. For electron-transfer reactions not in the inverted region, the common physical picture that diabatic processes occur because of surface hopping at the transition state is proven inadequate as the DC acts first to block access, increasing the transition state energy by (âÏ)(2)Î»/16J(2) (where Î» is the reorganization energy, J the electronic coupling and Ï the vibration frequency). However, the rate constant in the weakly-coupled Golden-Rule limit is identified as being only inversely proportional to this change rather than exponentially damped, owing to the effects of tunneling and surface hopping. Such weakly-coupled long-range electron-transfer processes should therefore not be described as \"non-adiabatic\" processes as they are easily described by Born-Huang ground-state adiabatic surfaces made by adding the DC to the BO surfaces; instead, they should be called just \"non-Born-Oppenheimer\" processes. The model system studied consists of two diabatic harmonic potential-energy surfaces coupled linearly through a single vibration, the \"two-site Holstein model\". Analytical expressions are derived for the BO breakdown terms, and the model is solved over a large parameter space focusing on both the lowest-energy spectroscopic transitions and the quantum dynamics of coherent-state wavepackets. BO breakdown is investigated pertinent to: ammonia inversion, aromaticity\n\nNon-Born-Oppenheimer calculations of the pure vibrational spectrum of HeH+.\n\nPubMed\n\nPavanello, Michele; Bubin, Sergiy; Molski, Marcin; Adamowicz, Ludwik\n\n2005-09-08\n\nVery accurate calculations of the pure vibrational spectrum of the HeH(+) ion are reported. The method used does not assume the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, and the motion of both the electrons and the nuclei are treated on equal footing. In such an approach the vibrational motion cannot be decoupled from the motion of electrons, and thus the pure vibrational states are calculated as the states of the system with zero total angular momentum. The wave functions of the states are expanded in terms of explicitly correlated Gaussian basis functions multipled by even powers of the internuclear distance. The calculations yielded twelve bound states and corresponding eleven transition energies. Those are compared with the pure vibrational transition energies extracted from the experimental rovibrational spectrum.\n\nEinstein-Langevin and Einstein-Fokker-Planck equations for Oppenheimer-Snyder gravitational collapse in a spacetime with conformal vacuum fluctuations\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMiller, Steven David\n\n1999-10-01\n\nA consistent extension of the Oppenheimer-Snyder gravitational collapse formalism is presented which incorporates stochastic, conformal, vacuum fluctuations of the metric tensor. This results in a tractable approach to studying the possible effects of vacuum fluctuations on collapse and singularity formation. The motivation here, is that it is known that coupling stochastic noise to a classical field theory can lead to workable methodologies that accommodate or reproduce many aspects of quantum theory, turbulence or structure formation. The effect of statistically averaging over the metric fluctuations gives the appearance of a deterministic Riemannian structure, with an induced non-vanishing cosmological constant arising from the nonlinearity. The Oppenheimer-Snyder collapse of a perfect fluid or dust star in the fluctuating or `turbulent' spacetime, is reformulated in terms of nonlinear Einstein-Langevin field equations, with an additional noise source in the energy-momentum tensor. The smooth deterministic worldlines of collapsing matter within the classical Oppenheimer-Snyder model, now become nonlinear Brownian motions due to the backreaction induced by vacuum fluctuations. As the star collapses, the matter worldlines become increasingly randomized since the backreaction coupling to the vacuum fluctuations is nonlinear; the input assumptions of the Hawking-Penrose singularity theorems should then be violated. Solving the nonlinear Einstein-Langevin field equation for collapse - via the Ito interpretation - gives a singularity-free solution, which is equivalent to the original Oppenheimer solution but with higher-order stochastic corrections; the original singular solution is recovered in the limit of zero vacuum fluctuations. The `geometro-hydrodynamics' of noisy gravitational collapse, were also translated into an equivalent mathematical formulation in terms of nonlinear Einstein-Fokker-Planck (EFP) continuity equations with respect to comoving coordinates\n\nMS Lonchakov and MS Phillips work with an IMAX film magazine bag in Zarya\n\nNASA Image and Video Library\n\n2001-04-23\n\nS100-E-5345 (23 April 2001) --- Cosmonaut Yuri V.

The algorithm is based on an implementation of the second-order spectral projection (SP2) algorithm [ Niklasson, A. M. N. Phys. Rev. B 2002 , 66 , 155115 ] in sparse matrix algebra with the ELLPACK-R data format. We illustrate the performance of the algorithm within self-consistent tight binding theory by total energy calculations of gas phase poly(ethylene) molecules and periodic liquid water systems containing up to 15,000 atoms on up to 16 CPU cores. We consider algorithm-specific performance aspects, such as local vs nonlocal memory access and the degree of matrix sparsity. Comparisons to sparse matrix algebra implementations using off-the-shelf libraries on multicore CPUs, graphics processing units (GPUs), and the Intel many integrated core (MIC) architecture are also presented. The accuracy and stability of the algorithm are illustrated with long duration Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics simulations of 1000 water molecules and a 303 atom Trp cage protein solvated by 2682 water molecules.\n\n78 FR 64196 - Foreign-Trade Zone 3-San Francisco, California; Application for Subzone; Phillips 66 Company...\n\nFederal Register 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014\n\n2013-10-28\n\n...
