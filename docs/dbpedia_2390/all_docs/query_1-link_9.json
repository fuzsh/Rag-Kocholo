Equally important,\n\nincome from revenue sources other\n\nthan dues has grown significantly\n\nwither and our programs would soon\n\ndie. I'm not trying to pin the reason\n\nfor a dues increase on the Postal Service\n\nthey do an excellent job\n\nbut\n\nthe fact still remains that postal costs\n\nhave risen 327 percent in just nine\n\nsince 1983.\n\nFor example, compared to 1983,\n\nEmblem Sales income is up $1.7 million (38 percent).\n\nAMERICAN LEGION\n\nmagazine advertising income is up\n\n$4.1 million (135 percent). \"Other\n\nsources,\" which include MBNA\n\nAmerica Visa/MasterCard card\n\nincome (which is shared with the\n\nDepartments) and fund-raising revenues, are up $7.5 million (185 percent). Total revenues, including dues\n\nincome, have grown from $25.9 mil1992\n\nup 62 percent.\n\nBut the growth in income, impressive as it is, has failed to keep pace\n\nwith the extraordinary growth in certain key areas of expense.\n\nPostage, for example, cost $1.8\n\nmillion in 1983; today it stands at\n\nnearly $7 million and is expected to\n\ntop $8 million by the end of the year.\n\nPrinting expenses for such things as\n\ndues notices and membership cards\n\ncost $219,000 in 1983; today it's $1.6\n\nmillion. The cost of paper, printing\n\nand postage for producing THE\n\nAMERICAN LEGION magazine has\n\ndoubled in 10 years, raising the actual\n\ncost of production to $4.80 per member, while we each pay only $2.50 per\n\nyear.

John McCain, (R-Arizona)\n\nAs\n\nPresident\n\nBush\n\naptly\n\nSen. Christopher\n\n—\n\n—\n\nCold War victory.\n\nAt the same time, that\n\nvictory will not be complete\n\nuntil\n\nwe\n\neliminate unneed-\n\ned weapons and return to\n\nthe American taxpayer a\n\ntrue peace dividend.\n\n10\n\nNO\n\nYES\n\ndeclared in his State of\n\nthe Union message on\n\nJan. 28, 1992, \"Communism died this\n\nyear\" and \"America won the Cold War.\"\n\nIt is apparent that we must cut the\n\ncostly weapons systems that were\n\nintended for a superpower conflict with\n\nthe now-collapsed Soviet Union. These\n\nweapons include the B-2 bomber, the small intercontinental\n\nballistic missile and the Seawolf submarine.\n\nThe type of threat that could justify the Seawolf no\n\nlonger exists, and there is no other nation in the world that\n\nis a potential adversary which justifies this level of expense\n\nand technology.\n\nIn fact, this expense is so great that this one single\n\nweapons system consumes 25 percent of the entire shipbuilding budget of the U.S. Navy.\n\nI understand and appreciate how important this particular\n\nweapon system is to the people who work in the shipyard\n\nand companies building the SSN-21, and to the representatives of those people. But we are faced with a dramatically\n\nshrinking defense budget and, as the details of President\n\nClinton's budget are revealed, we will see further reductions\n\nin defense spending beyond those already proposed.\n\nThere is no doubt that the Seawolf program must be terminated, or we will be left without the resources necessary\n\nto meet our future defense needs.\n\nThe men and women who manufacture this weapon system are outstanding people. I am not insensitive to the pain\n\nthey are caused by defense cuts of this nature.\n\nBut we cannot maintain funding for these expensive\n\nweapons systems\n\nno matter how rapid, sophisticated and\n\neffective they may be\n\nsimply to protect jobs. Our\n\ndefense industrial base must be guarded, and I have long\n\nurged the Pentagon to ensure that our critical defense technologies are protected as budget cuts occur.\n\nThe administration's plan to eliminate these weapons\n\nshould be supported, and programs to aid workers displaced\n\nby these actions should be strengthened. Unquestionably, we\n\nhave an obligation to meet the retraining and transitional\n\nneeds of the people who built the weapons that ensured our\n\nDodd (D-Connecticut)\n\nJ.\n\nOne\n\nof the most difficult\n\ndebates in Congress last\n\nyear centered on the proposed termination of the Seawolf submarine program. At issue was the arbitrary decision to close\n\ndown\n\na critical\n\nindustrial capability without carefully\n\nassessing the long-term implications to\n\nour national security infrastructure. That\n\nfor three important reasons.\n\nFirst, the issue of cost. In 1991, Congress had authorized\n\nand approved funding to build two Seawolf submarines. The\n\nfirst submarine is currently under construction, and half of\n\nthe money to build the second has already been spent. Terminating the program would have meant paying almost $1\n\ndecision\n\nwas flawed\n\nbillion in contract fines\n\nand cancellation\n\n—\n\nfees.\n\nThe message was clear\n\nit would have cost the same\n\namount of taxpayer money to terminate the program as it\n\nwould to simply complete the project.\n\nSecond, our national strength\n\nis\n\nnot based solely on the\n\nnumber of weapons. Our true strength lies in our innovation and dominance of technology and manufacturing techniques. Terminating the Seawolf program would have\n\nmeant\n\nthe immediate closing of nearly 200 suppliers and\n\nmanufacturers who are the sole producers of critical components for our nuclear Navy. Allowing those venders and\n\ntheir valuable experience to simply \"dry up and blow\n\naway\" would have been reckless and a serious mistake for\n\nour industrial capacity and our national security.\n\nA single submarine is almost useless to the Navy without at least one additional submarine to train and assist\n\nwith ongoing sea operations. Like our other high-tech\n\nforces, such as the stealth fighter and the B-2 bomber, the\n\nSeawolf represents a \"silver bullet\" force package that can\n\ndo more, with less detection, than any other weapon sys-\n\ntem in its class.\n\nOur nation has an\n\nobligation to provide the best possible\n\ndefense for the lowest possible cost to the taxpayer. In the\n\nfinal analysis, the\n\nSeawolf submarine program clearly pro-\n\nvides that defense while using the very latest in stealth tech-\n\nnology.\n\nOur men and women\n\nin\n\nuniform depend on that tech-\n\nnology, and the American taxpayers deserves a reasonable\n\nreturn on their investment.\n\nYOUR OPINIONS COUNT, TOO\n\nSenators and congressmen are interested in constituent viewpoints.
