        "text": "NOTE: The Lucky Bag said he spent one summer with C. M. T. C. It stands for Citizens’ Military Training Camp held at about 50 Army posts nationwide from 1921 to 1940. Some known participants: Harry Truman, Ronald Reagan and Chuck Yeager (from Wikipedia.)\n\nFrom the Dayton Daily News, February 16, 1937:\n\nLieuts. Hain and L. Q. Forbes were classmates at Annapolis and members of the championship rifle team that competed in the annual matches last year at Camp Perry, O. They flew east to ferry back several planes, to the naval base. Lieut. Hain visited Dayton last week, on his return trip. Lieut. Forbes, flying a new plane, crashed Saturday in the western mountains and was killed.\n\nFrom the Dayton Daily News, Ohio, November 24, 1937:\n\nFuneral services and burial for Lieut. Vernon Rex Hain, 30, Dayton naval flyer, who was killed late Tuesday when the plane he was piloting crashed at Benson’s Dry Lake, 59 miles east of San Diego, Cal., will be held Friday in Coronado Beach, Cal. Also killed in the crash was G. M. Keller, seaman, second class, who was flying with Hain.\n\nThe plane apparently lost a piece of cowling, which knocked the pilot unconscious, and went into a dive at 3500 feet, according to the announcement from United States fleet headquarters at North Island. A board of investigation was scheduled to meet Wednesday to complete the investigation of the accident.\n\nThe plane had been engaged in dive bombing practice with the entire squadron, and the air station reported the cowling of the plane probably ripped loose under pressure. The men were the only occupants of the plane.\n\nLieut. Hain was stationed at San Diego, and was attached to the VB-4 squadron, assigned to the U. S. S. Ranger, airplane carrier, last July. He was a member of the squadron assigned to the U. S. S. Lexington, which was sent in search of Amelia Earhart. The navy lieutenant was a graduate of the naval academy at Annapolis with the class of 1931, and was the oldest of six children.\n\nHe was born in Dayton Oct. 12, 1907, attending Longfellow grade school and Steele high school, from which he graduated in 1926. He worked at the N. C. R. a year as a screwmaker before receiving his appointment to the naval academy.\n\nFollowing his graduation from the service academy Lieut. Hain served on the battleship New York and for 15 months was in training in Pensacola, Fla. Five years ago he was married to Mildred McCannon, of Boston, whose father was the commander of the Boston navy yard.\n\nBesides his parents, Mr. and Mrs. Dennie W. Hain, of 111 W. McPherson st., he is survived by his widow, Mildred; a two-year-old son; four brothers, Lieut. Robert W. Hain, United States army, stationed at Ft. Totten, Long Island; Richard Hain employed at the Dayton Daily News in the classified advertising department; John, a member of the firm of the Standard Radio Parts; Clark, a senior at Steele high school, and a sister, Alice, a junior at Steele.\n\nThe lieutenant’s last visit to Dayton was in February where he stopped at Wright Field while ferrying a new plane to the naval base in San Diego.\n\nAt Steele high school, Vernon was president of the Philomathean literary society and spoke on the Panama Canal at a meeting in January, 1937. He was also a member of the Social Science club and Hi Y. As a high school senior, Vernon appeared in the class play “The Dulcy.” From the class prophecy: Mayor Hain Flays Air Traffic. City Commissioners Chrisman, Markland, Allison and Olt today convened to consider the problem of air traffic, at the instigation of Mayor Hain who is highly incensed over the disregard of air rules. Mayor Hain in an address before the Aircraft Uplift Society stressed the importance of immediate reform.\n\nVernon was appointed to the Naval Academy by Congressman Roy G. Fitzgerald. At graduation, he received the prize awarded by the Sons of the Revolution for the midshipman who stands one for the course in practical ordnance and gunnery. His name was engraved on the cup. He then reported to the rifle team on June 10 and remained for practice until August 1. The team then went to Camp Perry on Lake Erie for the matches.\n\nHe married Mildred Mannette McCammon on August 16, 1932, at her home. Their son Elliott Rex was born June 25, 1935, at Coronado, California."
