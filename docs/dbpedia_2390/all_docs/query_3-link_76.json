        "text": "2.5. Gene Expression Analysis\n\nTen μg of human reference total RNA (Agilent) was simultaneously reverse transcribed and labeled as described by Ouellet et al.54 Briefly, 18.5 μL of a solution containing 10 μg of total RNA, 7 μg of 5′-Cy3-labeled random nonamers (Biomers), and 1.5 μL of nuclease-free water was heated to 70 °C for 5 min for heat denaturation. After 5 min, the solution was immediately cooled on ice. 13.5 μL of reverse-transcription buffer was prepared by mixing 6 μL of 5× first-strand buffer (Invitrogen), 1.5 μL of 0.1 M DTT (Invitrogen), 1 μL of 10 mM dNTP (Thermo Scientific), 4 μL of 200 U/μL superscript III (invitrogen), and 1 μL of 40 U/μL RNaseOUT (Invitrogen). To this, the denatured solution was added and incubated at 25 °C for 5 min, followed by a 3 h incubation at 42 °C. For the hydrolysis reaction, 200 mM NaOH and 200 mM EDTA were taken in a 1:1 ratio, and 32 μL of the solution was added to the previous mixture. This was then incubated at 65 °C for 10 min 64 μL of 1 M HEPES at pH 7 (Carl Roth) was added to the mixture to neutralize the reaction solution. Purification was performed using a QiaQuick PCR purification kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer’s protocol. The amount of cDNA was measured using a NanoDrop One (ThermoFisher Scientific). The yield of labeled cDNA was estimated to be 40%.\n\nIn the gene expression analysis experiments, 5 μg of Cy3-labeled cDNA was used per array. The hybridization solution was prepared by mixing 150 μL of 2× MES buffer, 3.33 μL of 10 mg/mL herring-sperm DNA (Promega), 16.67 μL of 10 mg/mL acetylated BSA (Promega), and equal volumes (11.11 μL each) of 100 nM solutions of three quality control synthetic Cy3-labeled oligonucleotides: “QC 25mer”, “ECO1BioA1”, and “ECO1BioD2”. Five μg of labeled cDNA in nuclease-free water was added, and the solution was brought to 300 μL with nuclease-free water. After self-adhesive hybridization chambers (Grace Bio-Labs SecureSeal SA200) were applied over the arrays, the hybridization buffer was pipetted into the chambers, which were sealed using stickers and incubated at 42 °C for 20–24 h with rotation. The slides, with hybridization chambers still attached, were immersed in 50 mL nonstringent wash buffer at 42 °C in a Petri dish. The hybridization chambers were removed while still immersed in the buffer to disperse the hybridization solution. The slides were immediately transferred to 50 mL Falcon tubes for sequential washing in nonstringent wash buffer for 2 min, stringent wash buffer for 1 min, and final wash buffer for a few seconds. The slides were dried using a microarray centrifuge and then scanned at 2.5 μm resolution with a PMT voltage of 350 V. Intensity data from the scanned images were extracted and analyzed using NimbleScan 2.1 (Roche-NimbleGen), employing robust multichip analysis (RMA55) for interarray normalization purposes. The gene expression data analysis is based on two arrays (control A and control B) per scatterplot. Each gene expression array contains three unique 60mer probes for each of 45,033 human genes.\n\n3.1. Hydrolytic Stability during Hybridization\n\nTo assess the hydrolytic stability of the DNA on microarrays synthesized on dipodal-versus monopodal-functionalized silanes, we synthesized DNA microarrays on glass surfaces functionalized with each silane. Using in situ photolithographic DNA synthesis, we generated simple microarrays with 11 sequences: a 30mer (5′-GTCATCATCATGAACCACCCTGGTCTTTTT-3′) and 10 stepwise truncations of this sequence from the 5′ terminus. After synthesis, the microarrays were hybridized for either 2 or 24 h with a Cy3-labeled oligonucleotide complementary to the full-length sequence on the microarray. Green-colored fluorescent images of representative arrays functionalized with the three silanes are shown in . In addition to the silane treatment, we initially also experimented with the use of piranha solutions (5:1 ratio of sulfuric acid/hydrogen peroxide) to increase the surface hydroxyl density of the glass slides. Although piranha solutions have frequently been used prior to silanization, including in the context of in situ synthesis of DNA arrays,42,56,57 we observed only a few-percent improvement in fluorescence signal due to the piranha treatment in preliminary experiments and decided to omit this step in all experiments due to its safety risks. Therefore, all experiments presented here are based on slides that were silanized without any prior chemical oxidation or cleaning steps.\n\nAfter the 2 h hybridizations, the substrates functionalized with monopodal monohydroxyl and dipodal dihydroxyl silanes exhibit similar fluorescence intensity patterns, but the fluorescence on the dipodal monohydroxyl silane was significantly higher. Additional arrays were hybridized in exactly the same manner but for 24 h. All three substrate types exhibited a decrease in fluorescence intensity relative to the 2 h hybridization, which we attribute to a loss of DNA probes due to hydrolysis of the siloxy bonds and subsequent detachment of DNA from the glass surface. In the case of the monopodal monohydroxyl silane, the loss is very high and requires digitally increasing the brightness of the image by a factor of 10 relative to the other images to render the spots visible ( b).\n\nTo quantify the loss of DNA from the surface, we extracted the fluorescence intensity from all 350 on-array replicate features for each oligonucleotide length from each of the six replicate arrays for each silane surface functionalization. For each silane, the equivalent probes on each of the six arrays, a total of 2100 replicates, were averaged across the arrays to generate 350 data points per probe length. These data for both 2 and 24 h hybridizations and for the 30mers, 25mers, and 20mers are plotted in . The data, expressed as the signal divided by the background (unhybridizable array areas), show that functionalization with both the dihydroxyl and monohydroxyl dipodal silane results in significantly higher signal intensities, relative to the monopodal silane, for all probe lengths except for the shortest (20 nt) in the case of the dihydroxyl dipodal silane. Expressing the hybridization-intensity data as signal-to-background ratios accounts for possible differences in nonspecific binding to the surface, but no significant differences in background intensity were observed, with typical values of 30 to 50 units of arbitrary intensity for the hybridization experiments performed in this work.\n\nThe higher signal intensities of the longer oligonucleotides are due to their higher duplex stability. We hypothesized that longer probes would be more likely to be lost from the surface with increased hybridization times as they would experience greater hydrodynamic forces that could potentially pull them off the surface if the silane bond is weak. This does not appear to be the case, as the presumed weaker surface bond of the monopodal monohydroxyl silane does not result in a differential loss of the 30mers vs 20mers between short and long hybridizations (Table 2). While the dipodal dihydroxyl silane surface also shows little length-dependent loss of DNA, the dipodal monohydroxyl silane does, but in the opposite direction, with a proportionally stronger hybridization signal for the 30mers vs 20mers after the longer hybridization. A possible explanation for this effect could be a higher initial surface density of available hydroxyl groups, resulting in a surface density of DNA probes that is too high to fully hybridize due to molecular crowding but which becomes less crowded due to DNA losses during the 24 h hybridization. In this case, the reduced crowding partially compensates for the DNA loss. The issue of the surface density of DNA synthesized on these substrates is explored below. This would imply that the 20mers are a better indicator of DNA loss from the surface, as they hybridize too poorly to result in surface densities that hinder further hybridization.\n\nTable 2\n\nSubstrate30mer (%)25mer (%)20mer (%)monopodal monohydroxyl–83–82–82dipodal dihydroxyl–31–23–25dipodal monohydroxyl–5–23–60\n\nIt is clear from the signal-to-background hybridization data that both dipodal silanes result in a surface functionalization that is much more stable than that of the monopodal silane. We had hypothesized that the dipodal dihydroxyl silane would outperform the dipodal monohydroxyl silane because surface functionalization with both monopodal and dipodal silanes does not result in a well-defined surface monolayer with 3 or 6 bonds to the native hydroxyl group on the glass but rather forms multilayer aggregates with polymerization between silane molecules.58−60 Thus, we expected that the additional hydroxyl group of the dipodal dihydroxyl silane would increase the extent of polymerization and contribute to the stabilization of the functional layer. Looking at the data for the 20mer in Table 2, we see that this is indeed the case. We hypothesize that the two primary hydroxyl groups of the dipodal dihydroxyl silane participate in cross-linking reactions during the formation of the functional layer, contributing to its stability, but at the expense of a lower density of hydroxyl groups available later for DNA synthesis, resulting in fewer surface-bound DNA probes and lower hybridization intensity. Conversely, the single, less reactive, secondary hydroxyl of the dipodal monohydroxyl silane does not contribute much to cross-linking reactions, resulting in a less-stable functionalization compared to the dipodal dihydroxyl silane. These hydroxyl groups then remain available as initiation sites for DNA synthesis, resulting in a higher initial probe density and a greater hybridization signal.\n\nAlthough hybridization intensity and retention of this signal during extended exposure to warm aqueous buffers are a primary consideration in evaluating the suitability of silane functionalization, an equally important parameter is intensity homogeneity across the surface. Extracting quantitative data from high-throughput surface assays with up to circa one million probes per square centimeter requires uniform functionalization that results in signal homogeneity among equivalent surface probes synthesized at different positions across the surface. To quantify this aspect of substrate functionalization with the three silanes, we evaluated the hybridization data according to the standard deviation of the equivalent surface probes distributed across the array surface.\n\nThese results are presented in . In these plots, the signal-to-noise ratio is calculated as the average intensity of n-mers positioned at multiple locations across three replicate surfaces divided by their standard deviation. The standard deviation includes contributions from error sources independent of the surface functionalization, i.e., inhomogeneities due to the in situ photolithographic synthesis (e.g., chemical gradients and variations in light intensities reflected by the digital micromirrors), spatial patterns due to the hybridization and washing steps, and spatial artifacts introduced by the fluorescence scanner. Of these, synthesis and scanning sources contribute negligibly, but inhomogeneities due to hybridization can be significant. We took care to perform the hybridizations on the different surfaces as consistently as possible and assumed that the observed differences between the substrates could be attributed to the different surface functionalizations. The data in show that there are no major differences between the three substrate types in terms of homogeneity. After the 2 h hybridization, the pattern is very similar to that in a, indicating that the differences in signal-to-noise are primarily due to differences in signal, with the two dipodal silane functionalizations clearly superior to the monopodal silane. After 24 h ( b), the two dipodal silanes perform similarly, both with signal-to-noise values approximately five times greater than the monopodal silane. Overall, it is clear that the dipodal silane surface functionalizations are superior, particularly that of the dipodal monohydroxyl. These results are summarized in , which plots signal retention after a 24 h standard hybridization at 42 °C: 17% for the monopodal silane and 69 and 95%, for the dihydroxyl and monohydroxyl dipodal silanes, respectively. In all cases, these values are relative to the losses after 2 h, i.e., we assume no losses in the first 2 h of hybridization. This approach allows us to use standard conditions that do not result in a uniform hybridization in less than 2 h. Phillips et al.27 compared in situ oligonucleotide synthesis on glassy carbon and diamond thin films using the same monopodal monohydroxyl silane and found losses for the latter of approximately 95% after 24 h. We attribute their higher losses to their experimental approach, which involved rehybridizing and scanning the same array at multiple time points up to 24 h. We have observed that the additional array processing steps associated with sequential hybridizations of the same array result in greater losses. Specifically, a 24 h hybridization following a 2 h hybridization that was washed, dried, scanned, and dehybridized with warm deionized water resulted in a cumulative loss of 98% for the monopodal monohydroxyl silane and 43 and 35% cumulative losses for the dipodal monohydroxyl and dihydroxyl silanes, respectively. Otherwise, in all of our experiments, arrays were each hybridized and scanned only once, either after 2 h or after 24 h.\n\n3.4. Gene Expression Array Analysis\n\nTo test the potential of dipodal silanes for complex and particularly demanding applications in high-throughput biological assays, we synthesized high-density human gene expression microarrays on glass substrates functionalized with each of the silanes. The array of 60mer probes includes two replicates for each of three unique probes for each of ∼45,000 human transcripts plus quality control and reference sequences, for a total of 382,928 probes. These were then hybridized for 24 h with Cy3-labeled cDNA from reverse transcription of total human RNA. Since the purpose of the arrays was to evaluate the silane functionalization rather than gene expression patterns, the expression data from each array were compared with those of another array functionalized with the same silane and hybridized with another aliquot of the same cDNA. Therefore, the scatter in the data reflects experimental noise rather than over- or under-expression.\n\nshows representative images from the hybridized gene expression arrays synthesized on substrates functionalized with each of the three silanes as well as the corresponding log2 scatterplots. The three image details closely match the intensity profiles shown in b for fluorescence intensities after 24 h hybridizations of low complexity arrays of 20 through 30mers. In particular, the surface functionalization with the dipodal monohydroxyl silane results in a significantly brighter image in comparison with that of the dipodal dihydroxyl silane, which in turn is about ten times brighter than that from the monopodal monohydroxyl silane array. The corresponding scatter plots reflect this pattern, demonstrating that the loss of probes due to silane hydrolysis, particularly for the monopodal silane, results in a large loss of signal and a concomitant decrease in the signal-to-noise ratio of the assay. To quantify the improvement in the signal-to-noise ratio of the gene expression data resulting from the use of dipodal silanes, we calculated the root-mean-square error (RMSE) of each of the 51,957 points on the scatter plots in relative to their error-free value, represented by the diagonal line. These RMSE values are shown in Table 4, along with the mean intensities (nonnormalized) of the corresponding genomic and synthetic spike-in controls. Although the two metrics cannot be directly compared, the RMSE values are consistent with the signal-to-noise ratios for the 30mers plotted in b, also for 24 h hybridizations, with both dipodal silanes being significantly better able to discriminate signal from noise relative to the monopodal silane. We also note that for direct comparison purposes, the hybridization data shown in – and are all based on arrays synthesized with dT5 linkers. An additional signal enhancement of about 30% in the case of substrates functionalized with the dipodal monohydroxyl silane can additionally be achieved by increasing the linker length to 20 nt, as shown in , albeit at the expense of a few minutes of additional synthesis time.\n\nTable 4\n\nmonopodal monohydroxyldipodal dihydroxyldipodal monohydroxylroot mean square error (RMSE)0.880.420.30RMSE relative to monopodal silane10.480.34mean genomic probe intensity31123337mean spike-in probe intensity1036799820,476"
