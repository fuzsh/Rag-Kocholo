        "text": "The historiography of Brazilian race relations does not typically include a transnational element. Hence the lack of research on connections during the Cold War between Brazil and southern Lusophone Africa. As the Movimento Negro Unificado gained traction throughout Brazil and built its membership, it went beyond Brazil’s borders. Liberation movements in Angola and Mozambique established Marxist governments, the MPLA and FRELIMO, respectively. Like other black movements in Brazil, the MNU sought inspiration from Africa, whether that be religion, politics, or black identity, and the MNU did not differ. The Brazilian military dictatorship (1964-1985) surveilled and followed the MNU throughout its time in power. The MNU launched an attack against the concept of racial democracy, threatening the status quo during the dictatorship. Racial democracy acted as a cornerstone of Brazilian race relations for the military dictatorship. However, the military dictatorship used two concepts to its advantage during its time in power. Southern Lusophone Africa challenged lusotropicality from abroad. The military dictatorship in Brazil used both of these concepts to its advantage by arguing that Brazil lacked racism and that there existed a brotherhood amongst Portuguese speaking countries. The military dictatorship clamped down on power and movements that challenged it. The MNU sought relationships in Africa, especially Angola and Mozambique. By doing so, the MNU (racial democracy) and southern Lusophone Africa (lusotropicality) challenged two concepts highly crucial to the military dictatorship. Racial democracy began to fail in the 1960s and 1970s in Brazil as challengers argued it a myth. Lusotropicality started to crumble as colonialism collapsed and Portugal lost its colonies. However, three actors, the MNU, MPLA, and FRELIMO, confronted these concepts as falsehoods and contributed to bringing them down. This thesis, therefore, illuminates the larger scope of Brazilian race relations during the Cold War and adds a transnational focus.\n\nBrazil established the longest relationship between a region of the Americas and the African continent. At the centre of this connection was the transatlantic slave trade, which led to the forced migration of approximately 5.5 million enslaved Africans (44% of the 12.5 million who went through the Middle Passage) between the sixteenth and nineteenth centuries. Brazil was linked to areas both within and without the Portuguese Empire, but the strongest connection was to Angola. From the mid-seventeenth century onwards, Brazilian-based merchants scooped a growing slice of the slave trade from their metropolitan counterparts, and the African coast became a privileged space for illegal commerce with Dutch and English traders. The importation of enslaved Africans was so important for Brazilian elites that, after independence, they resisted British abolitionist pressure for decades. After the suppression of the traffic in 1850, Brazilian intellectual and political elites sought to forget the continent that had forcibly supplied most of the migrants responsible for settling Brazil, but multiple connections were actively sustained by Afro-Brazilians on both shores of the Atlantic in the following decades for cultural and economic reasons. Nevertheless, these direct links gradually waned after the dawn of the twentieth century, though imagined connections were revived from the 1930s onwards, both from above and from below. Therefore, this chapter offers an overview of Brazil-Africa relations from their beginnings to 1960, when the Independent Foreign Policy of Jânio Quadros and African decolonization brought significant change to the connections between Brazil and Africa."
