After graduating from the Classical Gymnasium in Split he pursued theological, philosophical and biblical studies in the same city. He continued these studies in Rome, where in 1935 he received his Ph.D. at Gregorian University. After achieving licentiate in Semitic languages in 1938, he traveled to Palestine. During World War II he lived in Switzerland where at the University of Geneva he finished studies in comparative literature in 1945. By 1947 he completed his studies at the Institute of Political Sciences, also in Geneva. As an official of the United Nations he worked in Geneva and Paris; from 1949 to 1952 he was employed in Lebanon for the U. N. among the Palestinian refugees. In 1952 by way of India, Burma and Japan he arrived as an immigrant in California. After a brief employment at the Bank of America in San Francisco Kadic, began teaching South Slavic languages and literatures at the University of California at Berkeley in 1953. In 1959 he started to teach at Indiana University in Bloomington where he became a full professor in 1965. He taught there until his retirement in 1980. Since he was assigned to teach contemporary Russian Literature as well, he visited Moscow and Leningrad in 1961 and 1968. Kadics first book in America was the Croatian Reader with Vocabulary (Berkeley, 1957, new edition by Mouton in 1960). In 1960 he published his Contemporary Croatian Literature (Mouton) and in 1964 his Contemporary Serbian Literature appeared. His most significant book is From Croatian Renaissance to Yugoslav Socialism (Mouton, 1969). This collection of essays, like many of his articles, studies, and books deals not only with literary themes but with cultural, social and political history as well. In Croatian he has published Domovinska Rijec: knjizevnopovjesni ogledi (Barcelona, 1978) and Ise1jena Hrvatska (Chicago, 1979). Both books discuss a variety of subjects, many writers, poets, distinguished Croatians in foreign countries, and the problems of emigration. Over the years Kadic has published many articles and some lengthy studies and critical analyses on numerous subjects in various Croatian papers and periodicals. His contribution to Hrvatska Revija-Croatian Review, an excellent quarterly (published in Barcelona by Vinko Nikolic, now in its thirty-second year) is outstanding. At many conventions and conferences of Slavic Studies in the United States and abroad Professor Kadic held lectures on subjects from Croatian, South Slavic and Slavic cultural history. He has visited many foreign countries in the course of his academic career, has gone to his homeland several times and has described his experiences, impressions and meetings with many people in various essays.

Ivan Katic found work almost immediately at the Barger Metal Company, located in Cleveland, Ohio, as a general utility worker. Ivan Katics brother, Slavko and his wife Barbara, came to the United States in 1971; Slavko joined Ivan at the Barger Metal Company. At the company, they met a shop foreman, Astor Branham, and together they laid the groundwork for what would eventually become Enterprise Welding & Fabricating, Inc. With a strong desire to run their own business, the Katic brothers asked Branham to help start a welding company. All three borrowed money from friends, totaling $2,000.00 and proceeded to form Enterprise Welding & Fabricating in Mentor on November 8, 1975 in a 3,000 square foot building. Less than a year later the company was struggling and ready to go out of business before Myers Products, a Cleveland snowplow maker, gave Enterprise Welding a $30,000.00 contract which turned things around for the struggling company. After nearly thirty years in this country, the Katics have created a successful Enterprise Welding & Fabricating Inc. at Heisley Road, Mentor, a thriving sheet-metal fabricator in a 55,000 square foot building. With new high-technology machines, such as lasers, robot welders, and CNC machines, Enterprise Welding & Fabricating has grown into a multi-million dollar company whose clients include great industrial giants such as Caterpillar Co. Ivan and Slavko Katic attribute their success to all of their uncles, cousins, and close friends who helped them out in the beginning as well as the present employees of the company. Ivans children, Mile, Ana and Ivana as well as Slavkos children, Josip and Vera have been obtaining a practical education for running the business to succeed their parents and continue the success and growth of the company. Ivan Katic other brother, Milan, emigrated from Croatia in 1982 and worked at Enterprise Welding. Helped by Ivan and Slavko, he opened a machine shop, Enterprise CNC in Mentor, which has also become a successful and expanding business. The youngest of the Katic brothers, Josip, arrived in Cleveland in 1979 at the age of 15. After graduating from high school, he served in the United States Army for four years. With the guidance of his brothers, Josip also opened his own machine shop, Quality CNC Machining, which expanded and moved into a new 8,000 square foot building. Completing this enterprise minded family is Kata Mazar, Katics sister who is in the commercial and residential decorating business. Ivan Katic said all four brothers have operated under the same principle: ìIf you want to work ten, or twelve hours a day, the opportunity is there for you to succeed.\n\nKATICH, MARTIN Restaurant\n\nMartin Katich, a resident of Oakland for more than a quarter of a century, has for the past eight years been successfully engaged in business as sole proprietor of the Avenue Cafe, a high-class restaurant located at the corner of Sixteenth street and San Pablo avenue in Oakland, California, A native of Dalmatia, Croatia, Martin Katich, however, came with an uncle to California when he was but thirteen years of age, in 1887.

After graduating the grammar grades, Martin Katich entered the Oakland high school. The Avenue Cafe is second to none in the city in excellence of appointments and cuisine. Meantime Mr. Katich made a journey back to his old home in Dalmatia to visit his parents there, in 1899, he married Miss Annie Urlovich.

The country was at that time under control of the Dual Monarchy with Frantz Joseph, the Emperor. The people of the time were mostly ignorant because schooling was not mandatory and most children were working to help support their families. But that didn't stop William Kauzlarich from getting four years of important education. This tiny bit of formal education proved to be helpful in the latter years of his life. Since villages had no modern forms of recreation like our radios and television sets thay had to make do with their own talents. They sang folksongs and danced and attended church. Weddings were big and lasted several days and they always took place in the church. Without their dancing and music, life would have, indeed, been very dull. People either worked in the fields from sun-up to sun-down or else they were employed in small shops or the few factories that existed. After he went to school William Kauzlarich worked in a furniture factory where he worked up to foreman for which he got paid meagerly at 80 cents per days work. Factories of this sort were owned mostly by British and French interests. After the supply of wood disappeared from the countryside, the factories shut down leaving the workers jobless. At the age of eighteen, he was drafted into the newly formed Austro-German Army. He fought in a war against Russia in which after losing the war, the Congress of Berlin gave Russia very little land in relation to the losses she suffered. He also fought a war against the declining Ottoman Empire. The war ended decisively in favor of the Austro-German Army but the price was more that paid for. During battle, mostly with swords and some guns, William Kauzlarich was severely wounded in the arm and stabbed in the back. After spending three months in the hospital and being promoted to Captain and serving three years in the Army, he decided he didn't like serving the Emperor and fled to France where, after a short time, he boarded a ship as a steerage passanger. A month later, in 1891, he arrived in the United Stated and instead in a big city like New York or Chicago like a good many immigrants did, he headed for Appenoose County, Iowa, where he stared work in agriculture and the mines. After living the required five years, he became official American citizen in October, 1896. From Appenoose County he had some Croatian friends headed down to Thurber, Texas to open a new mine. The town went into full swing and bloomed. Reaching a population of about 10,000 it soon receded and is now a small town in a sparsely populated region of Texas but is still on the map. From there it was on to California to do more agricultural work. Being tired of thinning fruit trees and of the desert heat, he then went to Coos Bay, Oregon where he worked new mine. Producing poor quality coal, the mine soon shut down. Today after about 80 years, the mine is being re-considered for re-opening to help ease the energy crunch. In 1898, at thirty years old, William Kauzlarich was living in Roslyn, Washington, again at work in coal mines. After five years of hard work and saving he opened the \"Corner Saloon\" complete with a real, full length, mahagony counter and fifteen foot plate mirror with \"The Order of the Eagles\" engraved on it. He was one of the first officers of this beginning organization and being the only man of thousands of Croatians that could speak both Croatian and English, he served as translator, translating legal documents, letters, and conversation among the town people. With this bilingual and other qualities, he served on the city council for seven years. He also was the first person in the city to install pluming with a toilet and bathtub. With the prohibition of 1915 and debtors who never paid back, it was back to the mines for William Kauzlarich, after another four years of savings, he bought the Scott Ranch in Nachez, Washington. The ranch was purchased \"sight unseen\". The ranch yielded the first hops in the state but the primary crop was apples. Pears and cherries and other fruit was grown also but with less emphasis. The ranch was continued after his death in May of 1948 by his three sons; Anthony, William Jr. and Steve until they sold the place in 1974 to an Engineer from California.\n\nKAZULIN CLAN Boat Builders\n\nThe Kazulin familys tradition of designing and building fine watercraft began seven generations ago on the Island of Brac, Dalmatia, Croatia. Since then, generations of the family produced commercial and pleasure boats in Europe and North America. In the early 1900s, Simon Kazulin built many of the early motor driven wooden fishing boats when he ran Skansi Boatworks in Gig Harbor Washington USA. His son Mike then continued this tradition with his line of Kazulin-Cole wooden boats into the 1960s in nearby Tacoma, Washington.\n\nMeanwhile, Simons youngest son and Tonys father Velko remained in Croatia designing and building very fine wooden excursion boats. He progressed into fiberglass in the late 1950s and built not only the very first fiberglass production boat in Eastern Europe, but also one of the first modern retro boats. This was a 5 meter (17 feet) barcha in fiberglass, based on the Adriatic coasts traditional lapstrake, trumble home fishing skiff. Subsequently, these boats were produced in the thousands over a period of 30 years, and continue to this day to have a presence in all the ports of the Adriatic. \" Velko states. Along with these fiberglass boats, Velkos excursion vessels were sought after by the locals who knew the Kazulin reputation of superior building and design abilities. When I visited the Coast last summer, I saw one of my old boats moored at a local dock....40 years later, how wonderful! Velko states (1999).\n\nIn the late 1970's, the family tradition came to Canada when the Kazulins immigrated to Vancouver, B.C. where Tony and Velko set up shop in their garage. After Tony completed university, the real work began; and in 1984, the 18 Mistral and the 570SS were launched as the first Kavalk line of luxury speedboats. A reporter for Pacific Yachting says in her review of the boats, she was expecting just another powerboat and upon seeing the Mistral she realized nothing could be further from the truth. The Mistral and the 570SS made their debut at the 1984 Vancouver Boat Show, but the true introduction of these boats occurred in 1986 in Toronto. The overwhelming response at the Toronto Boat Show was encouraging and the tour was extended to Seattle, San Francisco and Miami. Boats of such hand-crafted quality and workmanship were seldom found in the boat market; whereas, their performance was matched only by the beauty of their lines. \"Impressive\" was often used to describe the first Kavalks by this father and son team.\n\nIn 1987, upon listening to a suggestion made by a customer looking for a \"special\" runabout in the spirit of the old gentleman's racer, the Kazulins went back to the drawing board and started designing. The Kavalk Classic 19 premier at the Toronto Boat Show in 1988, where the first one was purchased by its progenitor, Mr. Don Grant. \"This boat was designed specifically for the Muskoka region of Ontario, whose history of mahogany gentleman runabouts and racers is well-known. We wanted to continue the Canadian tradition of beautiful runabouts,\" explains Tony. Glowing reviews in major boat magazines combined with high sales in Ontario, Canada opened the door to the international market. In 1989, the Kazulins started exporting their boats to the USA, Europe and Japan. \"If fiberglass had not been invented, this is what mahogany runabouts styling would have evolved into.\" Trailer Boats (USA) Tony Kazulin attended the major boat shows in Chicago, Miami, Dusseldorf and Tokyo where the Classic 19 sat alongside its big sister, the newly launched Kavalk SportCruiser 29. \"If you are looking for something different, a Kavalk sports boat is the one to choose. They will never go out of fashion or date, they look the same whether they are five or ten years old, yet they still provide outstanding performance.\" Sports Boat Magazine (UK) These semi-custom boats can be found all over the world which is testimony to the workmanship, design and innovation of the Kazulin family business. Through the years the Kazulins continue to design and produce their line of boats, as well as branching off into design, prototype and tooling work. Whatever the project, Kazulin's distinction is timeless design, excellent craftsmanship and functional quality of construction.

The Kerhins lived in Chicago, Pueblo, Colorado, and Pittsburgh, PA, but finally settled in Gary, Indiana. Kerhin was active in civic affairs, and particularly in the development and promotion of Croatian singing and music societies. He helped found the Singing Zora Society in Chicago and the Society Javor in Pittsburgh. Kerhin was also active in Croatian American activities nationally, helping to organize two singers' alliances, the Mihanovic (in Chicago), and Faller (in Pittsburgh). In 1949, these zupe became part of the national American-Croatian Singers Federation (Americko-Hrvatski Pjevacki Savez); Kerhin served as its president off and on during the 1950's and 1960's.\n\nKELEZ, GEORGE Fishery Scientist\n\nThe government research vessel, George B. Kelez, was named after a prominent Croatian-American fishery scientist who lost his life in an Alaskan plane crash. Tom Dunatov out of Seattle fished commercially for a few years before taking a job as a seaman aboard the government research vessel George B. Kelez. Tom was from Iz Mali.\n\nKENTRA, JOHN Silver Mines-Centerville\n\nJohn Centras-Kentra, a Slavonian (Croatian), was one of the most prolific mine locators in Nevada. John used the name Centers, but signed his name Centras. It is not known where he was born but the name Kentra comes from Dubrovnik. John left few personal traces in Nevada except to report to the 1880 Federal Census taker at Grantsville that he was from Austria. He left his son, John, with Sylvester Calabota, a Dalmatian, in San Francisco in 1880. Calabota reported as a Slavonian and was a member of the Slavonic Illyric Society. The Tybo Sun Newspaper in 1877 reported: John Centre and son left Monday for San Francisco. He goes down below on business connected with mines, and to place his little boy with friends until he arrives at a proper age to be put to school. No record is found of John Centras past the 1880s. He could have returned to Dalmatia. John left the first record in 1863 that the Slavonians were in Nevada in numbers with his Sclavonian Gold and Silver Mining Company. An editor reports on his activities in 1867 in the Austrian area: From Empire District-- Yesterday afternoon John Centras brought to our office a specimen of ore weighing upwards of 60 lbs., that was obtained from the Jerusalem Ledge in the Empire district. It was a curious mass of very rich mineral, and appeared to be a conglomerate of a variety of quartz herd in a gangue of quartz. It presented more native silver in different forms than we had previously met with; there were threads of silver, single of many entangled, small spongy masses of silver, tiny nuggets, delicate filaments, and broad and fantastic shaped laminae. The specimen was procured from the depth of twenty-five feet, at which point the ledge is said to be four and a half feet thick. One ton of ore from the Jerusalem reduced at Keystone mill, yielded 467.00 by assays of its pulp. John had many ventures throughout the mining districts: Inyo Gold and Silving Mining Company, San Francisco Even. Bul. 7-11-1863. Waukasin (Vukasin) G&S Mining Co., S.F. Evening Bulletin 7-11-1863.

Mining Claims, Univ. of Nevada, Belvidere Mine 3-25-1881 Spec. Col. Mining Claims, Univ. of Nevada, Various editors report on Johns activities: John Centras, who has just returned from Downeyville, has shown us some immensely rich ore taken from the Centras and Smith Mine, seven miles from that place. The ore is of the most beautiful character assaying from 250 to 16,000. John is confident that he has a big thing. Sclavonia: This ledge is situated between Yankee Blade Ravine and San Francisco Canyon, and was located in the early spring, but has been allowed to remain undeveloped until quite recently. John Centras, the Supt., informs us that he has started an incline, and at a depth of only 11 ft. has uncovered a ledge upwards of 8 in width of solid quartz and specimens submitted to our inspection were really fine looking and made us wish we were the possessors of a few tons of the rock, just to buy for grub this winter. John Center, a former resident of Tybo, it is reported, has struck a very rich mine ten miles from Downieville. If what we hear is true, John has at last realized what he has always claimed was lying around loose for him, a bonanza, that will place him above want and keep the wolf from the door the remainder of his days. John Centras- First Settler. Tybo is twelve miles south of Hot Creek, and about forty miles southeast of Belmont, in a mining district of the same name, which is situated on the eastern slope of the Hot Creek Mountains. Ore was discovered in 1866, and in 1870 some important locations were made. John Centers was its first settler, having made his home there in August 1866. Its altitude is about 6,500 feet, and it is surrounded by fine mountain scenery. It is called Centersville. John Centras left a commendable record in early Nevada and a few firsts as a pioneer.\n\nKERPAN, J. L. Academic\n\nBorn in Lovinac, Croatia, in 1888. Emigrated to the United States in 1907.

He was born in Westmorland County Pennsyania in a log cabin owned by the silent picture movie star William S. Hart to immigrant parents (Valentine and Veronika) with a love for the music of their homeland. At the age of 4 a Bisernica was put in his hands, and each Sunday he would listen to his father and the old fellows as they played for their own pleasure. His grandfather's singing encouraged him and soon he too was Singlng /Samo Nemoj Ti\". At 5 years of age he had his first performance at the Radnici Hall Dome in East Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. When his father had to leave Westinghouse in 1925, the family moved California. Charlie no longer had the Sunday home concerts, so he bought a 25 cent Marine Band Harmonica and began to play. Not long after a friend showed him how to play a concertina accordion and his dad bought him a full size accordion which he still owns and plays today. The Croatian families would get together for picnics and Charlie would play, and when Joe Radich came to California the children began to be given instruction in all the Tamburiza. instruments. Charlie continued to learn to play in an orchestra called \"Jorgovan\", and with the Los Angeles Tamburiza Orchestra. Charlie was his star singer and performer, and learned not only how to play all the Tamburiza instruments but make them as well. He also learned to write and arrange music. In high school Charlie teamed up with a violinist named Alex Alhandie and began performing with his accordion at private parties and restaurants including the \"American Legion\", \"Masons\", \"Moose\", and \"Rotary\" clubs. Charlie served in the US Army during WW 11 as a radio and rifleman on the front lines of the South Pacific with the 7th Division 17th Infantry where a chaplain learned of his talents and had him playing a pedal pipe organ. Following the war he started to play in an adult group taught by Mirko Kolesar and played with Pete Gaspich, Joe Radich and J. Latkovich. He also began his career with the City of Los Angeles as an Electrical Tester for 37 years, but on week ends and evenings continued Tamburiza playing with the 2nd L.A. Tamburiza Group at various places including \"Starkist Tuna\" with M. J. Bogdanovich and the radio program \"Slavic Hour,\" in Pasadena, Californi. He has been married to a supportive wife, Alice, for 46 years, has two boys and 3 grandchildren. Also, after the war he attended college and joined an opera workshop group, and performed in the Mannon Opera by Massenett. His abilities were recognized and became part of a long time friendship with other talented musicians including Theodore Radish and the Hajduk Tamburiza Group. Charlie is the leader in the group and many talented musicians including family members have played with them through the years. lie has recorded, performed with famous dance groups including the \"Aman Ensemble\" and even toured Croatia playing and singing. He has also, performed for movie stars, at Disneyland Studios, Knotts Berry Farm, and, head of states; but Charlie's favorite is weddings. Charlie has been involved in teaching Tamburiza, writing the music along with making and repairing of the instruments for over 60 years. At the age of 74 he has no intention of refiring from music and still leads his \"Hajduk Tamburiza Orchestra\". Among his many other accomplishments is his volunteer work with The Lincoln Training Center, a workshop for the mentally handicapped. Charlie is a cofounder \" and an active member for over 40 years serving in many capacities including the position of President of the Board of Directors.\n\nKINKUSICH-KINK, PAUL Fisherman\n\nThe Kink family was originally from Sinj, a town 35 KM North inland from Split, Croatia. It is the first town on the road through the Klis Pass. The town was in Turkish hands for over 150 years. In 1715, twenty years after its liberation, it repelled a Turkish siege. It was at this time that the Kink family fled the mainland and settled on the far out Island of Vis, Dalmatia, Croatia. In Komiza, Paul Kinkusic met and married Victoria Reskusich. They had 3 sons and 2 daughters. Sons: Dominic (Dick) married Margaret Evich in Everett, Washington. Their children are Victoria, Paul, and Mary. Paul married Maria Evich in Bellingham, Washington. Their children are Victoria, Peter, Dick, Mitchell, and Marie. Tony married Lucy Pribicic in Bellingham, Washington. They had 4 children, Victoria, Paul, Peter, and Jeanie. After Lucy's death, Tony married June Hughes-Ward and they had 3 children, Stanley, Madeline, and Kitty. My father came steerage to New York 1898. He somehow traveled to Colorado and worked in the mines there for a few years and saved his money. He made his way to San Pedro, California but was not too happy there. He then moved North to Everett, Washington. There he met his fellow Komizian, Paul Martinis, who wanted to stay in Everett and get started in purse-seine fishing. He also met and married Margaret Evich in 1912. She had been living with her brother John, and his wife, Maria (Costanti).\n\nWhen he heard that many of his friends were living in Fairhaven and starting to do well in salmon fishing, he came to Fairhaven and felt he had found his \"Mecca.\" He brought his wife and they moved into a rental on' 12th Street. He bought a small purse seiner, the Bellingham and did well in the fishing game. He sent for his two brothers, Paul and Tony. At about the same time he bought a pool hall and a small general store. When his brothers came, he put them there to manage the businesses. But these two young men were too good looking and the \"gals\" were treated royally, everything free!\n\nWhen the Bellingham came in after a good catch - \"Big Brother\" Dick sold the pool hall and the store and his brothers became his crew - so he could keep his eye on them.\n\nIn 1912 he had his boat the St Paul built. During the winter he worked as \"night watchman\" at the Campbell Cannery on Chuckanut Bay. his first child was bom in 1913 and named Victoria for her paternal grandmother. In 1915, son, Paul was born and named for his paternal grandfather. In 1917 a second girl was bom and named for her maternal grandmother (Mary). The Saint Paul was fished in Puget Sound and Alaskan waters for many years. On one trip to Cape Flattery, it was so rough that Dad had to tie his cook, Nick Mu1jat, to the stove to keep him on his feet and to hold the pot of stew on the stove.\n\nAnother time, Vince Dulcich was the cook and had just finished chopping the lettuce. Antone Costello came in the galley and asked what it was for. Vince told him it was for a salad. Antone. picked up the lettuce and threw it overboard and said \"That is for chickens!\" Then grabbed ahead of lettuce, bit off a chunk and said, \"This is salad!\" It was such fun when the St Paul came home from Alaska. We three kids all got Eskimo fur slippers that smelled awful - but were appreciated. Dad had so many stories to tell us about Alaska. He loved the Matanuska Valley, the Glaciers, the seals and the bears. Speaking of stories, my dad learned to read with me. Together we read my first primer, Ist grade reader, 2nd grade reader, and third grade reader. Then he started taking the daily paper -- he really self-taught himself to read the English language. In the early twenties my dad brought his mother to America. She was a very sweet, petite grandma. Dad built our home at 1102 Donovan Avenue where I was born. The house is still standing and looks great! Dad wanted to live near other immigrant nationalities so he would get a better understanding of what America was going to be. Neighbors were the Rene LaCasse family, the\n\nBert Sybrant's, the Keen family (Indian), Mr. Mahoney -- a Civil War Veteran -- Officer of the Confederacy, Mrs. Rathman and her four daughters. The South Bellingham fire station was three houses away from ours and the Chief of Police lived a few blocks away. We also had some Dalmatians close by: The Anton Costello family from Kotor (we really loved them), Gorgo and Matija Zaninovich from Vis, Spiro and Yube Karuza from Solta were great people. Spiro fished on the St. Paul. The Vince Dulcich family from Hvar were very dear friends.\n\nBut of course all our close friends from the Island of Vis were very special. We were together for weddings, funerals, baptisms, first communion, confirmations, St. Nicholas Day -- Christmas to New Years Day was one party after another. I can remember walking home after midnight from 12th street to Donovan (no cars)... I can also remember falling asleep under Mu1jat's kitchen table (no baby-sitters)... the adults sang, danced, and told fantastic stories. The food was Dalmatian pastries, candy, and nuts. My dad and Nick Mu1jat made some snazzy guitars from 5-gallon oil cans and cat-gut strings. They strummed them like seasoned musicians and sang songs in a guttural voice. They were destined to become the Elvis Presleys of Vis! In the spring when the seiners were clean and freshly painted -- many picnics to various islands were held. Sometime two boats were tied together -- We had to anchor out for there were no docks -- then the skiffs were rowed to the beach bringing food, kids, etc. The men would build a fire on the beach, getting it down to hot, hot coals and barbecue the choice cuts of meat. The ladies made the salad: Lettuce, tomatoes, green onions with olive oil and vinegar dressing with home-made croutons. Long loaves of French bread (crispy) were cut in thick slices (no butter) -- the drinks were wine for adults, pop for the kids and watermelon for dessert. Svete was also brought to go with coffee. The food at those long-ago picnics are now considered gourmet! So many wonderful meinories! By Mary Irvin.

Joe is the only remaining charter member of the Sloboda Junior Tamburitzans and has continued being an active participant. He truly enjoys assisting the learning of the tambura to youngsters as well as his own children. In 1976 he coordinated the first youth trip to Croatia for the 10th Annual Croatian Cultural Festival and again this year for the 20th Festival in Zagreb. In Dallas, Texas, where rarely a tambura was heard, Joe was instrumental in bringing tambura music alive to eager enthusiasts. Joe believes that no other ethnic group on earth enjoys the culture and heritage of their forefathers as do the Croatians. This beautiful music has been a major factor that brought him through serious illnesses as well as given him a beautiful musical life!\n\nKIRIN, MILAN and ANNA Slavulj Chorus\n\nTogether they gathered Croatian singers from all parts of the Southland, because they believed in an idea, because they had a vision of tomorrow, because they heard stirring echoes of their beloved homeland tunes beating in their hearts and felt compelled to listen. These two, Milan and Anna Kirin, co-founders of \"Slavulj\" have been its life-blood from the inception to the chorus. Working tirelessly to promote the chorus before and after its founding, they still give it their endless support. So on this 20th anniversary of \"Slavulj\" in 1968 we particularly share our congratulations with Milan Kirin, co-founder, and also with his wife, Anna. And we pause to honor them in profound appreciation. Croatian National Association.\n\nKIRIN, MILAN Croatian Activist\n\nMilan was born in Hrvatska Dubica, Croatia on September 18, 1888 where he secured his grammar and high school education. On May 5, 1905 he completed his training as a cabinet maker. In February 1907, he came to America and settled at Braddock, Pennsylvania, where he took up the trade of pattern maker in the plant of the Westinghouse Electric and Manufacturing Company. In 1911 he moved to Detroit where he followed his trade of pattern maker in various automobile plants until 1930 when he moved to Los Angeles. Mr. Kirin joined the Croatian Fraternal Union in 1909 and held positions on the executive committee at various times. At the C.F.U. convention in Gary, Indiana he was elected a member of the high trial board. In 1931 he married Anna Murvin. Milan, along with John Fill organized the Croatian singing society Slavulj in Los Angeles in 1948.\n\nKISAK, PAUL CIA Officer-Engineer\n\nMr. Paul F.

Mr. Kisak was the first student to graduate from the University of Michigan with 3 degrees in Engineering and went on the found KKItm which was the first company to offer award winning commercial-off-the-shelf satellite simulation software for the personal computer.\n\nKISICH, PASQUAL Restaurant\n\nPasqual Kisich, who has been a resident of Oakland for more than a quarter of a century, is the well known proprietor of the beautiful Saddle Rock Cafe at No. 418 Thirteenth street. His birth occurred in Dubrovnik, Croatia, on the 16th of October, 1869, his parents being Michael and Svieta Kisich. At the age of seventeen he emigrated to the United States and settled in California, being employed on a ranch near Santa Clara for three months. He then came to Oakland and worked in a restaurant for two years. On the expiration of that period, in association with John Marcovich, he opened the Saddle Rock Cafe at the corner of Twelfth and Washington streets and in 1893 purchased the interest of his partner. In 1900 he removed to Broadway, between Thirteenth and Fourteenth streets, there remaining until 1905, when he came to his present place of business at No. 418 Thirteenth street. Here he conducts an attractive and handsomely appointed cafe that is considered the best in Oakland. As the years have gone by he has won a measure of success that is well merited and that entitles him to recognition among the prosperous and representative citizens of his community. On the 12th of April, 1898, in Oakland, Mr. Kisich was united in marriage to Miss Nettie C. Stroinski, by whom he has three children, namely: Oliver, who is fourteen years of age and a high-school student; Bernice, eight years old, who is in school in a convent; and Pasqual, a little lad of three.

He is a member of organizations whose aim is to promote the expansion of Oakland, belonging to the Chamber of Commerce, the Oakland Commercial Club and the Mercahnts Exchange, of which he is a director. 1914\n\nKLARIC, JOHN Contractor-Military-Engineer\n\nJohn Klaric founded Klaric Contracting Company, to become internationally recognized for construction and restoration. Klaric's company has built and beautified some 50 historically significant churches and university institutions in the United States, including the restoration of St. Louis Cathedral and construction of 50-story granite Southwestern Bell Headquarters in downtown St. Louis. John Klaric was born in the town of Drivenik (selo Klarici), Hrvatsko Primorje, in Croatia, to Mate and Katarina Katunar Klaric. His brother Matt was born one year later. When John and Matt started grade school, their schoolmates called them \"Amerikanci\" because their grandfather, father, and uncles had been to America. Supporting their family from overseas, the men would return to Croatia periodically before going back to work in St. Louis, Missouri. John's father had prepared to bring John's mother and the boys to the United States in 1927. However, because of the Great Depression, the trip was postponed for ten years-until September 1937. John was fifteen years old, and Matt was fourteen, when they set off for America. Life in a rather primitive village had not prepared them for the life they viewed from the train as they traveled through the cities of Western Europe. When they reached the French port city of Cherbourg, they boarded the Cunard White Star ship, the Berengaria. Since John's father was a citizen of the United States, John and Matt were told that they would be citizens as soon as they set foot on United States soil. It was a meaningful and exciting moment for them to feel they belonged to this new country. John's father had died before the boys reached St. Louis. Instead, the boys were greeted at the train station by Aunt Helen and Uncle John Klaric. Uncle John told them their grandfather had helped to build the train station they were in, before the turn of the century. Aunt Helen and Uncle John became very important in John's life. Their support and encouragement were invaluable in all his future decisions.\n\nThey learned quickly; John was able to graduate with his contemporaries from junior high and then completed his four years of high school. He was considering attending college, but in that time war clouds were already forming in Europe. When the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor, America was outraged. Shortly after that unprovoked attack, John and many other young Americans volunteered for duty. John's naval unit was attached to the Third Marine Division, Second Raider Regiment. Guadalcanal was the first United States offensive against the Japanese forces. The fighting men endured brutal combat there and on other Pacific Islands. John and Ira Hayes-the Native American who helped to raise the American flag on Iwo Jima-were foxhole buddies on the island of Bougainville.\n\nAt the war's close, John was discharged from the Navy on December 23, 1945. The following month he enrolled at St. Louis University to study Civil Engineering. Four years later he completed his studies at the University of Missouri. In May 1950, John married Marilee Ann Prendergast, whose grandparents came from Ireland and settled in Princeton, Illinois. John and Marilee were blessed with three children: Marion, William, and Elizabeth, and then seven grandchildren: Gregory, Jessica, Christine, Lindsay, John, Theresa, and Zachary. That same year John received his license to be a masonry contractor. Not long after, he received a contract to perform stonework and other masonry on a large Catholic church, St. Martin of Tours. Uncle John Klaric had an outstanding reputation as a stonemason in St. Louis, and he became John's superintendent. John's brother Matt joined the company as foreman. After World War 11, the demand for commercial buildings and religious institutions catapulted Klaric Contracting Company into the biggest economic expansion St. Louis had ever experienced. Over the years, Klaric Contracting had the opportunity to restore and improve many beautiful and famous buildings. John's company also restored the St. Louis Cathedral. John even met Ivan Mestrovic when Klaric Contracting Company was setting a Mestrovic sculpture of Pope Pius XII in front of the Pope Pius XII Library on the campus of St. Louis University.\n\nJohn has returned to visit Croatia many times and has enjoyed visiting his birthplace and renewing his kinship with his relatives. Also during that time, Sveti Dujam, Drivenik's parish church, was in need of repair. The church was 400 years old, and the Klaric family had worshipped there for generations. John's mother made certain that John and Matt donated the money needed to repair Sveti Dujam. Professor Marion Haberle, an architect and professor at the University of Zagreb, asked John to come to Zagreb to inspect the Zagreb Cathedral because extensive repairs were being considered. Father Antun Ivandija, Professor Haberle, and John inspected the cathedral and John published their conclusions in the Croatian Catholic Union's Nasa Nada and the Croatian Fraternal Union's Zajednicar.\n\nAs we all know, in 1991 Jugoslavija was coming apart. As a Croatian-American, John called a meeting of Croats in the St. Louis area. The meeting was held at St. Joseph's Croatian Church hall, where everyone who attended agreed that immediate steps must be taken to give aid to our people in their dire need. Thus, a legal non-profit organization was formed to be known as the American Croatian Relief Project (ACRP). The response to the organization was overwhelming. Klaric Contracting Company supplied 10,000 square feet of space in their warehouse to store donations. Donations were packed in 20 ton containers and shipped to Croatia on Croatian ships. Sixty containers of food, clothing, medical equipment, and even ambulances were sent in care of Monsignor Vladimir Stankovic, to be distributed by the Croatian Caritas Foundation. John was president of the ACRP for two years. He traveled to Croatia several times to deliver ambulances in the name of Mary Morgich Robert and the ACRP.\n\nA highpoint in John's life occurred in 1988 when he accompanied his daughters, Marion and Beth, to Rome for the canonization of Rose Philippine Duchesne. Beth is a teacher at Sacred Heart Academy in St. Charles, Missouri, where she and Marion finished their elementary and high school education. St. Rose Philippine Duchesne founded Sacred Heart Academy, which was the first school opened west of the Mississippi River. Beth was chosen to do one of the readings at the canonization Mass that was held in St. Peter's Basilica. After the Mass, John and his daughters attended an audience with Pope John Paul 11.\n\nKLICINOVICH-BELL, ANTHONY TONY Policeman-Military\n\nAnthony J. Bell (Klicinovich) was born on September 1, 1902 in the village of Postire, Island of Brac, Dalmatia. Croatia. He joined the Slavonic Society in 1931. He campaigned for a stronger society advocating changes to guarantee the longevity of the society. He actively participated in the building of the Slavonic Cultural Center, admittance of women into the SMBS, rewriting of the constitution and by-laws, and participated in many comniittees. His two years as president provided the groundwork in streamlining the operation of the SMBS and the promotion of high ethical standards in the club by his successful term of office. Tony was appointed a sworn member of the San Francisco Police Department on September 11, 1934. This was one of the most cherished moments in his life- becoming a police officer in San Francisco. Tony was one of the founding fathers of the San Francisco Police Officers Association, and he formally participated in this organizations incorporation in 1946. Tony was a fighter for right and benefits for San Francisco police officers. His loyalty and dedication to the Police Association did not stop when his police career ended in 1964. For eight years Tony served on the POAs Board of Directors most ably representing the retired members. For 18 years Tony volunteered his time every Friday to assist the Associations office staff. These efforts will never be forgotten because they were so unusual. Tonys heart was always with the Association he helped form, incorporate and develop. Tony was and active member in the Police Veterans Post. He was also the executive officer of a volunteer neighborhood watch organization in Oakland. The work and service that Tony accomplished will long remain as will memories of his deep felt affection for the Police Officers Association and its entire membership. Tony was one of a kind-a truly outstanding human being. Tony was a life long member of the Slavonic Society of San Francisco.\n\nTony has received awards from local governments, TV and radio, various police officer's associations, and from the SMBS. Highlights of Tony's recent 80th birthday celebration at our Slavonic Cultural Center was the receipt of birthday greetings from the President of the United States, Ronald Reagan, and his wife, Nancy. Tony has a daughter, Frances Biggins, and two grandsons. Tony is married to Alene who was the first woman to join the SMBS. Tony, Alene, Frances and the grandchildren are all participants in the SMBS Building Fund. Tony's life was touched with tragedy with the loss of two children, Russell and Antoinette, at early ages. Brother Tony's spirit, achievements and dedication in making the SMBS a better society could be best described by Tony's recent statement to this writer, \"I am dedicated to the perpetuation of our heritage and language and I am constantly striving to upgrade our image.\"\n\nKLISURA, KATHERINE Banking\n\nKatherine was born June 30, 1907 in San Francisco. In 1917 her family moved to Los Angeles where her education was completed. She attended UCLA, USC and the American Institute of Bankers. A good deal of her education was assisted by scholastic prizes for achievement. Klisura was a prominent worker among Croatians, always interested in their welfare, and was a contributor to various California newspapers\n\nKLOBUCHAR, JOHN Restaurants-Military\n\nJohn Klobucar, namesake of the Big John Steak & Onion, is not a large guy. \"I'm not so big, am l?\" the 5-foot10 Klobucar said with a laugh when asked about the moniker. \"Actually, I'm shrinking.\" Secondly, although he's a selfmade millionaire because of his successful restaurant chain, Klobucar joked about his business acumen. \"I don't know if I'm a good businessman, but I am a damn good cook,\" he said. \"That's what I love to do.\" And last, his real name is Klobuchar, not Klobucar. A mixup on his birth certificate when he joined the Navy in 1942 seemed insignificant, and he took on his newly spelled last name. He is a member of Flint, Michigan Croatian Fraternal Union Lodge 561. Actually, Klobucar doesn't care what you call him as long as you're enjoying those steak, onion and cheese subs.\n\nThe son of Croatian immigrants, David and Madeline Klobuchar, who initially settled in Eveleth, Minnesota, Klobucar's family moved to Flint in 1929 during the Depression. Living on Flint's east side, Klobucar graduated from Central High School in the 1940s. After working at AC Spark Plug, Klobucar joined the Navy and was part of a World War 11 flight crew. \"I was no war hero\" is all he'll say about that period of his life.\n\nAfter returning to Flint, Klobucar worked in a factory before opening his first restaurant in 1949, The Old Trail Inn, on Dort Highway near Court Street in Flint. But Klobucar and his partner split up three years later. He later became a salesman for restaurant supplies, but in 1955 bought a building near Dort Highway and Lapeer Road in Flint and named it \"Johnny's Cross Road Pizza and Barbecue.\" In 1961, Klobucar decided to remodel his restaurant and obtain a Kentucky Fried Chicken franchise. \"It's still there,\" he said. \"And I still own it.\" A later trip to Florida gave him another idea - to market his own brand of Philly cheese steak hoagies that he had enjoyed there. \"I said, 'I know Flint is a hot dog town, but maybe this will work there,'\" he recalled. So in 1972, Big John Steak & Onion was born. Following the KFC logo tradition, Klobucar used his own picture as a logo. I wanted to personalize it, give it a franchise look,\" he said. He said grilling the meats in front of customers and cooking their sandwich to order is part of the appeal. Klobucar shares his wealth with loyal employees, whom he calls part of the corporate family, by letting them own and operate their own franchises. He also donates to his favorite charities, but won't blow his own horn or tell where he spreads the wealth. \"Money is a good thing to make so you can give it away,\" he said. He said Big John will open restaurants in Clio and Grand Blanc Township this year, which also will mean new employees.\n\nKNAUS, JOHN V.

He is a member of the Knights of Columbus, the Illinois State Bar Association, the American Ear Association, the Croatian Fraternal Union of America, the Croatian Catholic Union, and scores of other organizations. During World War II he was very active in defense leagues, the Red Cross, the U. S. 0., defense bond and stamp sales, and other forms of war services. He was honored by the American Legion for his outstanding work on the Selective Service Board, and for his interest in the welfare of veterans and their families. Mr. Knaus is a member of many Chicago organizations, and enjoys the respect of all Americans and Croatians. He is Editor of the Croatian American Historical Review. He is married to the former Dorothy Kelly, and lives with his wife and three children at 8926 Haiper Avenue, Chicago, Illinois.\n\nKNEGO, PETER Writer-Photographer-Maritime Historian\n\nHe has produced an excellent CD-Rom featuring over 2,000 interior and exterior images of some of the world`s greatest passenger liners. Also within the 999 pages there are \"rare\" ships featured alongside classic ships such as the American Star(formerly America-Australis), Achille Lauro, Canberra, Constitution, Rotterdam V and the Scandinavia are all featured prominently. This CD-Rom is the culmination of 5 years research and world wide travelling to acquire information and photographs. In 1960, Peter Knego developed an interest in ocean liners and cruise ships at an early age. In 1973, his 7 grade American History class required a paper on the Lusitania. After researching the subject, young Knego became enamoured with the beauty and power of the great transatlantic liners. The hobby grew into a life-long passion with Knego devoting his time and efforts to researching the history of all liners. After his first visit to the S/S Arcadia on 20 January 1974, few passenger ships would call at Los Angeles without a visit from camera-clad Knego. As he matured and his camera skills (and cameras) evolved, his commitment to documenting the fragile world of cruise ships held forth. In 1992, his photographic efforts would include video, and out of this a series of videos entitled \"The World's Passenger Fleet\" was born. In 1997 Knego joined forces with instructional media + magic to create the first commercially-available enthusiast-oriented CD ROM on 150 of today's current and recent liners. This ground-breaking project took on the name of Knego's earlier video series. In the meantime, Knego continues to pursue and document liners throughout the world in a never-ending quest to preserve the history of the vanishing \"classic\" passenger ships. Knego is a member of the Steamship Historical Society of America, The World Ship Society, and the Ocean Liner Society. His articles and photographs have been published in a variety of sources, such as: Ships Monthly, Voyages, Sea Lines and the Millergram. Knego also enjoys lecturing about his favorite subject both ashore and afloat. He has a Bachelor of Arts degree from U.C.L.A., is a successful record promoter, and currently lives in Moorpark, California.\n\nKNEGO, PETER V. Restaurant-Fuel-Croatian Activities\n\nBorn in Brgat near Dubrovnik, Dalmatia, Croatia, in 1884. Came to America in 1903 and for the first three years resided in Truckee, California. Settled in San Francisco in 1906 and for several years was engaged in the restaurant business. Engaged in fuel business since 1921. He is a member of the Croatian Sokol of San Francisco , which he joined twenty-one years ago, and has served as its President for nearly half of that period. This office he now occupies. He has also been President of the Slavonic Mutual and Benevolent Society; Croatian Unity of the Pacific; Past President of the Croatian Benevolent Society Zvonimir (now Zvonimir-Dalmatia); and Past President of the Croatian Grand Sokol Lodge of the Pacific. In addition to these offices, Mr. Knego has served on numerous local committees which had been organized for various special purposes, ordinarily as chairman. The enumeration of the offices which Mr. Knego has held or is holding today does not, however, sufficiently describe his activities. He is not merely an officeholder, but contributes all his energy and experience toward the success of the work on hand. Indeed, very few men in public life undertake their functions with as much zeal and altruism as he does. It is this quality which makes him a desirable associate in whatever the task might be. His presence is invariably a guarantee that the work will be done, and done well. Due to his many-fold activities, his personal sacrifices in behalf of every good cause, his sound judgment and personal integrity, Mr. Knego is today one of the most popular Croatians in San Francisco.\n\nKNEZEVICH, DONALD E. Tamburitza Hall of Fame-Composer-Teacher\n\nTamburitza music has been a major part of Donald E. Knezevich's life for the past 45 years. He is a respected musician, was a beloved teacher, a writer of original Tamburitza compositions, developed and wrote an instructional book for Tamburitza students and conducted adult and junior Tamburitza groups. Mr. Knezevich is also an educator. He retired from the Beaver, Pennsylvania Area School System in 1993 after 33 years as a public school teacher. His teaching encompassed high school band, instrumental music and elementary school vocals. He was dubbed with the nickname, \"Mr. K\", during his years as a young teacher/director of the Jadran junior Tamburitza group in the late 1950s ... a nickname which has stayed with him to this day. To honor this remarkable career, Mr. Knezevich has been chosen as one of six 1995 inductees to the TAA Hall of Fame. Mr Knezevich began his music career as a high school student in East Chicago, Indiana. He took professional accordion lessons and played the clarinet and saxophone in the Washington (Ind.) High School band and orchestra. He was also a member of the prestigious CYO band of Chicago and was a featured accordion soloist in adult Tamburitza concerts in the South Chicago area. In 1956 he graduated from the Duquesnes University School of Music, and earned a master's degree in music in 1959. As an undergraduate, he was selected to perform in the Duquesne University Tamburitzans, which toured France, Italy and Croatia during the summer of 1952. He was named director of the Duquesne Tamburitzans following his graduation in 1956. \"Mr. K\" began his career in public education in the Aliquippa, Pennsylvania School System in 1960. From 1959 to 1972, Mr. Knezevich directed the Jadran, Midland and the New Brighton Tammies, groups which participated in every junior Federation Tamburitza Festival at that time. Under his leadership, the Jadran and Midland tammies groups recorded long-play albums which included many of Mr. Knezevich's own compositions and arrangements. \"Mr. K\" retired in 1973, to spend more time with his family. However, after about 10 years, he answered the call to return from retirement as director of the Sevdah Adult Tamburitzans of Croatian Fraternal Union Lodge #540 in Conway, Pennsylvania. Three years later, he resumed his directorship of the Jadran group and led the two groups on three tours of Croatia. In recognition of his work with Tamburitza and modern combos, Mr. Knezevich was inducted to the Beaver Valley Musicians Hall of Fame in 1993. He also served as guest conductor of the special Junior Tarnburitza Festival celebrating the 100th anniversary of the Croatian Fraternal Union in 1994. Mr. Knezevich and his wife, Millie, live in Conway with their son, James, and daughter, Christine.-His mother, Mary, also lives in the Beaver Valley area.\n\nKNEZEVICH, JOHN Newspaper Editor\n\nJohn Knezevich arrived in the United States in 1913 when he was 14 years of age. After two and a half years in St. Louis, Missouri, he moved to Los Angeles, California. His first job was working for the first Croatian newspaper in Los Angeles, Novo Vreme (The News Times) published by the late Baldo Skar-Skaramucha from Dubrovnik. He was an honest man and a most devoted Croatian. Then, John Knezevich with Danilo Chabraya started the Jugoslavenski Zurnal, in 1919. Chabraya soon gave up publishing. Thereafter began publishing Jedinstvo (Unity). John Knezevichs offices and printing shop were on the spot of the present City Hall of Los Angeles. At the same time several other Slav papers sprung up. The late Frane Akacic from Oakland, California, moved his Jadran (Adriatic) to Los Angeles, this was a Croatian paper. Also, the late Victor Vodvodich published a magazine Sokol (the Falcon). Also, the late Spiro Grassi from Split, Dalmatia, published a periodical. Then one Dr. Leposava Djordovich published a magazine once a month. Also the late Milan Sokolovich, a Communist. It was picnic when we all would meet in my office. I was on speaking terms with all of them, that, I could not say for the rest. After I gave up publishing the Jedinstvo, I refunded the unexpired subscriptions to all subscribers. John J. Knezevich\n\nKNEZOVICH, JOHN Baseball-Military\n\nBrother John was the youngest son of Ivan and Matija Knezovich, both of Rascana, Dalmacija, Croatia. John's parents migrated here to Oakland, California in the early 1900s where they settled and opened a family grocery store. They raised five children, Mary Valerio, Katherine Cetinich, Eva Salle, Steve Dragi Knezovich and brother John Knezovich. All of their children married Croatian descendants from the Dalmatian coast. This made their parents very, very happy. John, as a young adult, was drafted by the Cincinnati Reds Baseball Team, and he played on their farm league. But John had to leave this career when he entered World War 11. He was in the Army Air Base Wings, and he spent a treacherous game of island hopping, invading one island after another as the United States forces crept ever closer to Japan. John was injured with a piece of shrapnel which he carried with him in his shoulder the rest of his life. This was the reason he never returned to professional baseball. John worked as a sheet metal man after he left the army. He married Lucille Chumo in 1949 in Oakland. They would have celebrated 50 years of marriage last year, but Lucille preceded John in a sudden death in 1997. John and Lucille were parents to two children, John Peter Knezovich and Nicoline Mathea Knezovich, both of Walnut Creek. John Peter lived with his parents his entire life, and misses their presence deeply. Nicoline and her husband George and their three children Kayla, Keegan and Konnor all miss their loving Papa and Nana. John worked for over 40 years as a sheet metal man after leaving the army. He enjoyed gardening, painting, remodeling, building fences and pruning his fruit trees, especially his pomegranate trees. John spent 35 years during his spare time coaching youth Little League Baseball, sharing with others his passion for a sport that he loved so much. He taught hundreds of children for 35 years in Little League, and he was known all over the Contra Costa County as Mr. K the coach and teacher for Spring, Summer and Winter Training for baseball. Brother John Knezovich had just reached 50 years of Golden Membership with the Croatian Fraternal Union. He died at the age of 79, the day after his birthday on February 29, 2000 in Walnut Creek, California. At his funeral, many of his former students ranging from ages 8 to 30 attended, wearing their \"Mr. K\" Baseball caps and shirts. As a final tribute, John Knezovich was escorted out of the church to the tune of \"Take Me Out To The Ballgame,\"with many of his present and former Little Leaguers singing his favorite song and his pallbearers wearing baseball caps.\n\nKOCIJAN, DIOMIRA Sister Catholic\n\nBorn on the Island of Olib, Croatia in 1933 and immigrated to San Francisco in 1947 where her father Benjamin lived and worked without his family for years until after WW II when he was able to bring them to the USA. She and her mother and sisters were among the first to leave Olib after WWII. She went to the convent in 1956 in the order of the SIsters of St. Joseph of Orange, California and is still there today.\n\nKOJICH, NIKOLA Restaurant-Fisherman-Croatian Activities\n\nIn the year 1906 Nikola Kojich of Babino Polje came straight to Oakland and stayed there until 1919. Soon after his arrival in America he became a member of the Croatia Benevolent Society \"Tomislav\" of Oakland, lodge number 356 of the National Croatian Union. In 1918 he was elected to represent the Croatian Benevolent Society \"Tomislav\" at a convention of the Union in Chicago. From 1918 to 1926 Nikola Kojich was a member of the Union's main board and actively took part in the organization. When the first Croatian Sokol club was created on the Pacific coast in Oakland, Nikola helped to organize it and eventually became its leader. He was also a member of other emigrant organizations. From 1914 to 1918, he purchased and ran his own store in Oakland. As this job didn't go very well, in 1919 he moved to Tomales Bay, which is 80 km from San Francisco. There, with his wife Franica's brothers Grga, Miho, and Andrija Matkovich, originally from Hvar, he fished mainly herring. Often he fished alone in his motor launch along the Pacific, from San Diego and San Pedro in Southern California, to Eureke, 320 miles north of San Francisco. His fishing expeditions along the Pacific, usually alone, but sometimes with additional fishermen, were written about in four issues of Oakland's \"Narod\", arranged by the journalist Frane Akacich. Nikola Kojich owned the seafood restaurant \"Nick's Cove\" in Tomales Bay. When he was not on the Pacific he was often visited by emigrants, and he went to visit them in Monterey, San Pedro and other cities also. He died in 1961, without ever having had children.\n\nKOLAK, MARIA L. Pediatrician\n\nMaria Kolak is a pediatrician in New York City and resides at Forest Hills, New York.

He started fishing on his dads boat in Kali in the early 50's. After finishing high school, instead of coming home, he was kidnapped and taken to Italy with his dads cargo schooner ship. He was sixteen years of age and spent two years in a refugee camp there, Camp Frashette. He eventually made it to New York, stayed there for two years and moved west to San Pedro, California.\n\nIn 1963, he bought a fishing boat, Pevan, and went salmon fishing in southeast Alaska, around Ketchikan. He met many Croatian fisherman there. They came from all over, especially Tacoma, Anacortes, Gig Harbor, and the Pacific Northwest. They've been coming up there since the beginning of the 20th century, most with Croatians as part of their crews. They were hard working crew and fisherman and were known for this in the fishing community.\n\nAfter one summer there, he came back to San Pedro and in 1964, with a friend, bought a boat in Bristol Bay, Alaska. The name of the boat was AR-7. It was a small 32ft wooden boat, which is the limit for this area even today. In the beginning there was only a few Croatian fisherman in the Bristol Bay. The Brother's Viljusic from San Pedro had a seven boat fleet for their company (1964). Another man, Mr. Racic, started building boats for Bristol Bay in San\n\nPedro. By 1968, there were about 27 Croatian fishing boats in the Bristol Bay area. In 1964 we hoisted a Croatian flag up in Naknek for the first time for the\n\n4th of July festivities.\n\nAs the years progressed, more and more Croatian fisherman came up to the Bristol Bay to fish for sockeye salmon. The first boat that my dad had burned down in 1966 from a cannery fire. His second boat, King Tomislav, he fished with his partner Ante Huljev (San Pedro). They fished together on this boat for\n\nten years. After that he bought his own boat, King Kresimir. In Alaska, a number of the Croatian fishing boats had Croatian names; Zrinski, Jadran, Kornat, Queen of Croatia, Zadar, Danica, and Croatia, to name a few. Most of the fleet fly both the Croatian and American flags, even to this date.\n\nBefore the fisherman (ribari) left for the fishing season in Alaska, it was a tradition to have a Fisherman's Night party at the Croatian Club in San\n\nPedro. This was one of the biggest celebrations of the year, with fishing nets, music, dance, food, and even a selection of a queen for the night. My dad was\n\none of the original founders of the club which opened on December 10, 1972. This was the first Croatian Club on the west coast. Today, the Croatian fishing fleet is still there, but it is diminishing in size. We lost a few boats to fire and weather in Alaska. We lost fisherman on the sea and shore through the years. After 40 years in Alaska, my dad is still fishing in the Bristol Bay. He has a new boat, F/V Sea Fire, which he acquired in 1989. We still proudly fly the Croatian flag on all Croatian boats in Alaska. His sons, Martin and Tomislav, also came up to the Bay during the summers to help out.\n\nSince 1963, after the fishing season in Alaska, my dad came to the Puget Sound to fish on his boat, Pevan. He fished here for four different species of salmon. He ended up settling down in Anacortes, Washington in 1974 and started a family. There was a large Croatian population living there because it reminded them of the Dalmatian coast. Most of them decendants from the island of Korcula. They owned canneries, shipyards, and had a big fishing fleet. Some of these are still here today, including Anton Lovric's shipyard in Anacortes and Martinolic in Tacoma. My dad also fished for dungeness crabs in 1968 around the islands of the Puget Sound. He just recently sold his license and pots, as well as his boat of over 40 years, Pevan. He still goes to Bristol Bay, Alaska to fish for salmon. One day hoping to retire from fishing and instead return to the Adriatic and the islands that he left in his young age.\n\nKOLIBASH , ALBERT J.

The following biography of brother Rudy appeared in the TAA souvenir program book: Music has been part of Rudy Kolich's life for over 60 years, fifty of those have been focused on tamburitza music. Self taught and proficient on bugaria, prim, slap bass, mandolin -- tamburitza music is an important part of Rudy's life. Born in 1928 to Karl and Anna Matasich Kolich, Rudy started playing trumpet in the sixth grade, switching to tuba for the high school marching band, and standup bass for the school orchestra. Upon graduation from high school, he enlisted in the Navy, during which time he played mandolin with a small combo.
