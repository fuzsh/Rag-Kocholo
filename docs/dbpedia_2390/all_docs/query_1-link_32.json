During the summer of 2012, three Midshipmen were assigned to work with the XCP Division at LANL for approximately 5-6 weeks. As one of the nation's top national security science laboratories, LANL stretches across 36 square miles, has over 2,100 facilities, and employs over 9,000 individuals including a significant numbermoreÂ Â» of students and postdocs. LANL's mission is to 'apply science and technology to: ensure the safety, security, and reliability of the US nuclear deterrent, reduce global threats, and solve other emerging national security challenges.' While LANL officially operates under the US Department of Energy (DoE), fulfilling this mission requires mutual cooperation with the US Department of Defense (DoD) as well. LANL's high concentration of knowledge and experience provides interns a chance to perform research in many disciplines, and its connection with the DoD in both operation and personnel gives SARA students insight to career possibilities both during and after military service. SARA students have plenty of opportunity to enjoy hiking, camping, the Los Alamos YMCA, and many other outdoor activities in New Mexico while staying at the Buffalo Thunder Resort, located 20 miles east of the lab. XCP Division is the Computational Physics division of LANL's Weapons Department. Working with XCP Division requires individuals to be Q cleared by the DoE. This means it is significantly more convenient for SARA students to be assigned to XCP Division than their civilian counterparts as the DoD CNWDI clearance held by SARA students is easily transferred to the lab prior to the students arriving at the\n\nIndicators of induced subacute ruminal acidosis (SARA) in Danish Holstein cows.\n\nPubMed\n\nDanscher, Anne Mette; Li, Shucong; Andersen, Pia H; Khafipour, Ehsan; Kristensen, Niels B; Plaizier, Jan C\n\n2015-07-17\n\nThe prevalence of subacute ruminal acidosis (SARA) in dairy cows is high with large impact on economy and welfare. Its current field diagnosis is based on point ruminal pH measurements by oral probe or rumenocentesis. These techniques are invasive and inaccurate, and better markers for the diagnosis of SARA are needed. The goal of this study was to evaluate clinical signs of SARA and to investigate the use of blood, faecal and urinary parameters as indicators of SARA. Six lactating, rumen cannulated, Danish Holstein cows were used in a cross-over study with three periods. The first and second periods included two cows on control diet and two cows on nutritional SARA challenge. The third period only included two cows on SARA challenge. Control diet was a conventional total mixed ration [45.5% dry matter (DM), 17.8% crude protein, 43.8% neutral detergent fibre, and 22.5% acid detergent fibre (DM basis)]. SARA challenge was conducted by substituting control diet with grain pellets (50% wheat/barley) over 3Â days to reach 40% grain in the diet. Ruminal pH was measured continuously. Blood samples were collected once daily at 7Â h after feeding. Samples of faeces and urine were collected at feeding, and at 7 and 12Â h after feeding. Blood samples were analysed for pCO2, pO2, pH, electrolytes, lactate, glucose, packed cell volume (PCV), and total plasma protein concentration. Milk composition, ruminal VFA, and pH of faeces and urine were measured. SARA was associated with decreased (PÂ <Â 0.05) minimum ruminal, faecal and urinary pH. Daily times and areas of ruminal pH below 5.8, and 5.6 were increased to levels representative for SARA. Significant differences were detected in milk composition and ruminal VFAs. Blood calcium concentration was decreased (PÂ <Â 0.05), and pCO2 tended to be increased (PÂ =Â 0.10). Significant differences were not detected in other parameters. SARA challenge was associated with changes in faecal and urinary pH, blood calcium concentration and\n\nSubacute ruminal acidosis (SARA) challenge, ruminal condition and cellular immunity in cattle.\n\nPubMed\n\nSato, Shigeru\n\n2015-02-01\n\nSubacute ruminal acidosis (SARA) is characterized by repeated bouts of low ruminal pH. Cows with SARA often develop complications or other diseases, and associate physiologically with immunosuppression and inflammation. Ruminal free lipopolysaccharide (LPS) increases during SARA and translocates into the blood circulation activating an inflammatory response. Ruminal fermentation and cellular immunity are encouraged by supplementing hay with calf starter during weaning. SARA calves given a 5-day repeated administration of a bacteria-based probiotic had stable ruminal pH levels (6.6-6.8). The repeated administration of probiotics enhance cellular immune function and encourage recovery from diarrhea in pre-weaning calves. Furthermore, the ruminal fermentation could guard against acute and short-term feeding changes, and changes in the rumen microbial composition of SARA cattle might occur following changes in ruminal pH. The repeated bouts of low ruminal pH in SARA cattle might be associated with depression of cellular immunity.\n\nPathophysiological evaluation of subacute ruminal acidosis (SARA) by continuous ruminal pH monitoring\n\nPubMed Central\n\n2016-01-01\n\nAbstract Evaluation of the radioâtransmission pHâmeasurement system for monitoring the ruminal pH and subacute ruminal acidosis (SARA) in cattle is described. This is done in order to reveal the possible application of this system for detection and pathophysiological research of SARA by continuous ruminal pH measurement. The possibility of using this system for assessment of the ruminal pH in SARA cattle, and the presence of negative correlation between the ruminal pH and ruminal temperature in heathy and SARA cattle were determined. In addition, the 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing analysis showed that the ruminal microbial community was simpler in SARA cattle, and the bacterial numbers in SARA cattle were lower than those in healthy hayâfed cattle. Concentrate feeding might have reduced the diversity of the ruminal microbial community. Changes in the ruminal microbial community of SARA cattle might be related to the changes in ruminal pH followed by the decrease in the number of some bacteria. Continuous monitoring of the ruminal pH using the radioâtransmission pHâmeasurement system would be applied for detection and prevention of SARA in the field and pathophysiological research of SARA, including ruminal zymology and bacteriology, which have been determined previously by sampling of the ruminal fluid and measuring of ruminal pH.

A common problem of manual logging is that users often disengage within a short time because of high burden. In this work, we propose SARA, a novel app to engage users with ongoing tracking using timely rewards thereby reinforcing users for data input. SARA is developed for adolescents and emerging adults at risk for substance abuse. The rewards in SARA are designed to be developmentally and culturally appropriate to the target demographic and are theoretically grounded in the behavioral science literature. In this paper, we describe SARA and its rewards to increase data collection. We also briefly discuss future plans to evaluate SARA and develop just in time adaptive interventions for engagement and behavior change.

We hypothesized that ruminal E. coli in grain pellet-induced SARA carried virulence factors that potentially contribute to the immune activation during SARA. One hundred twenty-nine E. coli isolates were cultured from the rumens of 8 cows (4 animals per treatment) in which SARA had been nutritionally induced by feeding a high-grain diet (GPI-SARA) or a diet containing alfalfa pellets (API-SARA). The population structure of the E. coli was evaluated with the ABD genotyping system and repetitive sequence-based (rep)-PCR fingerprinting. Twenty-five virulence factors were evaluated with PCR. Escherichia coli numbers were higher in the GPI-SARA treatment than in the API-SARA treatment. The genetic structure of the E. coli was significantly different between SARA challenge models. Isolates from GPI-control (46%), API-control (70%), and API-SARA (53%) were closely related and fell into one cluster, whereas isolates from GPI-SARA (54%) grouped separately. The ABD typing indicated a shift from an A-type E. coli population to a B1-type population only due to GPI-SARA. Of the 25 virulence factors tested, curli fiber genes were highly associated with GPI. Curli fibers were first identified in E. coli mastitis isolates and are potent virulence factors that induce a range of immune responses. Results suggest that under low rumen pH conditions induced by a grain diet, there is a burst in the number of E. coli with virulence genes that can take advantage of these rumen conditions to trigger an inflammatory response.

A software tool for the multi-purpose analysis of MR perfusion-weighted datasets and quantitative ischemic stroke assessment.\n\nPubMed\n\nForkert, N D; Cheng, B; Kemmling, A; Thomalla, G; Fiehler, J\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThe objective of this work is to present the software tool ANTONIA, which has been developed to facilitate a quantitative analysis of perfusion-weighted MRI (PWI) datasets in general as well as the subsequent multi-parametric analysis of additional datasets for the specific purpose of acute ischemic stroke patient dataset evaluation. Three different methods for the analysis of DSC or DCE PWI datasets are currently implemented in ANTONIA, which can be case-specifically selected based on the study protocol. These methods comprise a curve fitting method as well as a deconvolution-based and deconvolution-free method integrating a previously defined arterial input function. The perfusion analysis is extended for the purpose of acute ischemic stroke analysis by additional methods that enable an automatic atlas-based selection of the arterial input function, an analysis of the perfusion-diffusion and DWI-FLAIR mismatch as well as segmentation-based volumetric analyses. For reliability evaluation, the described software tool was used by two observers for quantitative analysis of 15 datasets from acute ischemic stroke patients to extract the acute lesion core volume, FLAIR ratio, perfusion-diffusion mismatch volume with manually as well as automatically selected arterial input functions, and follow-up lesion volume. The results of this evaluation revealed that the described software tool leads to highly reproducible results for all parameters if the automatic arterial input function selection method is used. Due to the broad selection of processing methods that are available in the software tool, ANTONIA is especially helpful to support image-based perfusion and acute ischemic stroke research projects.\n\nThe SARA REU Site Program\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWood, M. A.; Oswalt, T. D.; SARA Collaboration\n\n2000-12-01\n\nWe present an overview of the Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site Program hosted by the Southeastern Association for Research in Astronomy (SARA) for the past 6 years. SARA is a consortium of the six universities: Florida Institute of Technology, East Tennessee State University, Florida International University, The University of Georgia, Valdosta State University, and Clemson University. We host 10-11 student interns per year out of an application pool of ~150-200. Recruiting flyers are sent to the ~3400 undergraduate institutions in the United States, and we use a web-based application form and review process. We are a distributed REU Site, but come together for group meetings at the beginning and end of the summer program and stay in contact in between using email list manager software. Interns complete a research project working one-on-one with a faculty mentor, and each intern travels to observe at the SARA Observatory at Kitt Peak National Observatory. Interns give both oral and display presentations of their results at the final group meeting. In addition, all interns write a paper for publication in the IAPPP Communications, an international amateur-professional journal, and several present at professional meetings and in refereed publications. We include in the group meetings a ``how-to'' session on giving talks and posters, an Ethics Session, and a session on Women in Astronomy. This work was supported by the NSF Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site Program through grant AST 96169939 to The Florida Institute of Technology.\n\nEffects of SARA on oxygen-glucose deprivation in PC12 cell line.\n\nPubMed\n\nWang, Jiao-Qi; He, Jin-Ting; Du, Zhen-Wu; Li, Zong-Shu; Liu, Yong-Feng; Mang, Jing; Xu, Zhong-Xin\n\n2013-05-01\n\nIschemic stroke is a major composition of cerebrovascular disease, seriously threatening to human health in the world. Activin A (ActA), belonging to transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-Î²) super family, plays an important role in the hypoxic-ischemic brain injury through ActA/Smads pathway. While as an essential phosphorylation assistor in TGF-Î² signaling, the functions and mechanisms of smad anchor for receptor activation (SARA) in ischemic brain injury remain poorly understood. To solve this problem and explore the pathological processes of ischemic stroke, we used an Oxygen-Glucose deprivation (OGD) model in nerve growth factor-induced differentiated rattus PC12 pheochromocytoma cells and down regulated the expressions of SARA by RNA interference technology. Our results showed that the repression of SARA before OGD exposure reduced the expressions of Smad2, 3, 4 mRNA and the phosphorylation rate of Smad2 protein, but it did not affect the mRNA expressions of Smad7. After OGD treatment, ActA/Smads pathway was activated and the expression of SARA in the SARA pre-repression group was significantly up-regulated. The pre-repression of SARA increased the sensitivities of nerve-like cells to OGD damage. Moreover, the mRNA expression of Smad7 which was supposed to participate in the negative feedback of ActA/Smads pathway was also elevated due to OGD injury. Taken together, these results suggest a positive role of SARA in assisting the phosphorylation of Smad2 and maintaining the neuron protective effect of ActA/Smads pathway.\n\nBiogas Technology Application in Western Kenya-A Field Investigation in Nandi and Bomet Counties\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nVenort, Taisha\n\nThe integration of biogas technology into Kenyan farming systems is becoming more common since the launch of the Kenya National Biogas Programme (KENDBIP). A comprehensive assessment of the status, operation of biogas plants constructed through KENDBIP, and their role within rural farming systems, is undertaken in two important dairy herds of Kenya (i.e., Nandi and Bomet counties), towards understanding factors affecting applications, for energy and agronomic use. Data on farming systems, operation and application were collected from 242 farm households in both counties. A Binary Linear Regression model was developed to pinpoint constraint factors most influential to plants operation. Descriptive statistics were used to compare users' experiences, and capture farm households' trends in energy and fertilizer use. Higher operational rate in Bomet (77%) than Nandi (59%), reveal that plants' viability are impacted by subsidies 'liability schemes of local supporting programs. Records of partial substitution to biogas and bio-slurry seem to contribute to the reinforcement of local agro-forestry traditions through an increase in the adoption of zero-grazing practices, wood/tree lots retention, and more efficient agricultural land attribution in the smallholder context. These changes are all having a positive impact on farm households' livelihoods and food security. Key recommendations to biogas programs stakeholders are that local subsidy schemes take better account of liability towards local technicians, Quality Control responsibilities are decentralized to local enterprises, and Research & Development strategies further investigate biogas technology application in agriculture, and its role in directly impacted value chains (i.e., Dairy, African Leafy vegetables, Feed & Fodder), for better experiences by farmers.\n\nInfluence of Special Needs Education Policy on Access to Secondary School Education by Learners with Hearing Impairments in Nandi County, Kenya\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nMuhombe, Joseph Andrew; Rop, Naftali K.; Ogola, Fredrick O.; Wesonga, Justus Nyongesa\n\n2015-01-01\n\nThis study sought to examine influence of Special Needs Education Policy on access to secondary school education by learners with hearing impairments in Nandi County, Kenya.

The reticular and ruminal pH were measured simultaneously by a radio transmission pH measurement system. The mean reticular pH at 1-h intervals decreased gradually from the morning feeding to the next feeding time in both healthy and SARA cows, though the decrease in the ruminal pH was observed to be more drastic as compared with that observed in the reticular pH. The threshold of the 1-h mean pH in the reticulum for a diagnosis of SARA was considered to be 6.3, and a significant positive correlation was observed between the reticular and ruminal pH. No differences in the concentrations of lactic acid, ammonia nitrogen, and volatile fatty acids were noted between the reticular and ruminal fluids in SARA cows. These results demonstrate that the reticular pH can be used to detect SARA in cows, as opposed to using the ruminal pH.\n\nAvailability and Use of Instructional Materials in the Teaching of Conflict and Conflict Resolution in Primary Schools in Nandi North District, Kenya\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nTuimur, Hilda Ng'etich; Chemwei, Bernard\n\n2015-01-01\n\nThis paper examines the availability and use of instructional resources necessary for teaching Conflict and Conflict Resolution as a topic in Social Studies subject in primary schools in Nandi North District in Kenya.

The level of acute phase proteins (APPs) including haptoglobin (HP) and serum amyloid A (SAA) in plasma and their mRNA expression in liver, as well as plasma cortisol and genes expression of key factors controlling cortisol synthesis in adrenal cortex were compared between SARA and control goats. SARA was induced by feeding high concentrate diet (60% concentrate of dry matter) for 3 weeks (SARA, n=6), while control goats (Con, n=6) received a low concentrate diet (40% concentrate of dry matter) during the experimental time. SARA goats showed ruminal pH below 5.8 for more than 3 h per day, which was significantly lower than control goats (pH>6.0). SARA goats demonstrated a significant increase of hepatic HP and SAA mRNA expression (P<0.05), and the level of HP but not SAA in plasma was markedly increased compared with control (P<0.05). The level of cortisol in plasma showed a trend to increase in SARA goats (0.05\n\nSARA goats. The contents of 3Î²-HSD and P450 side-chain cleavage protein were increased by 58.6% and 39.4%, respectively, but did not reach the statistical significance (P>0.05).

After obtaining the permission, original SARA was translated into Japanese. To examine the reliability and internal consistency of the Japanese version of the SARA for the assessment of cerebellar ataxia in 66 patients with spinocerebellar degeneration. Intraclass coefficients (ICC) were observed to be greater than 0.8 except in the case of the inter-rater \"finger chase\" and \"fast alternating hand movement\" tests. The Japanese version of SARA is highly reliable and very useful for the assessment of cerebellar ataxia on a daily basis.\n\nSARA-Coffee web server, a tool for the computation of RNA sequence and structure multiple alignments\n\nPubMed Central\n\nDi Tommaso, Paolo; Bussotti, Giovanni; Kemena, Carsten; Capriotti, Emidio; Chatzou, Maria; Prieto, Pablo; Notredame, Cedric\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThis article introduces the SARA-Coffee web server; a service allowing the online computation of 3D structure based multiple RNA sequence alignments. The server makes it possible to combine sequences with and without known 3D structures. Given a set of sequences SARA-Coffee outputs a multiple sequence alignment along with a reliability index for every sequence, column and aligned residue. SARA-Coffee combines SARA, a pairwise structural RNA aligner with the R-Coffee multiple RNA aligner in a way that has been shown to improve alignment accuracy over most sequence aligners when enough structural data is available.

R.\n\n2016-12-01\n\nStormwater management strategies such as Best Management Practices (BMP) and Low-Impact Development (LID) have increasingly gained attention in urban runoff control, becoming vital to holistic watershed master plans. These strategies can help address existing water quality impairments and support regulatory compliance, as well as guide planning and management of future development when substantial population growth and urbanization is projected to occur. However, past efforts have been limited to qualitative planning due to the lack of suitable tools to conduct quantitative assessment. The San Antonio River Authority (SARA), with the assistance of Lockwood, Andrews & Newnam, Inc. (LAN) and AQUA TERRA Consultants (a division of RESPEC), developed comprehensive hydrodynamic and water quality models using the Hydrological Simulation Program-FORTRAN (HSPF) for several urban watersheds in the San Antonio River Basin. These models enabled watershed management to look at water quality issues on a more refined temporal and spatial scale than the limited monitoring data. They also provided a means to locate and quantify potential water quality impairments and evaluate the effects of mitigation measures. To support the models, a suite of software tools were developed. including: 1) SARA Timeseries Utility Tool for managing and processing of large model timeseries files, 2) SARA Load Reduction Tool to determine load reductions needed to achieve screening levels for each modeled constituent on a sub-basin basis, and 3) SARA Enhanced BMP Tool to determine the optimal combination of BMP types and units needed to achieve the required load reductions. Using these SARA models and tools, water quality agencies and stormwater professionals can determine the optimal combinations of BMP/LID to accomplish their goals and save substantial stormwater infrastructure and management costs. The tools can also help regulators and permittees evaluate the feasibility of achieving compliance\n\nInhibition of transforming growth factor-beta1-induced signaling and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition by the Smad-binding peptide aptamer Trx-SARA.\n\nPubMed\n\nZhao, Bryan M; Hoffmann, F Michael\n\n2006-09-01\n\nOverexpression of the inhibitory Smad, Smad7, is used frequently to implicate the Smad pathway in cellular responses to transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) signaling; however, Smad7 regulates several other proteins, including Cdc42, p38MAPK, and beta-catenin. We report an alternative approach for more specifically disrupting Smad-dependent signaling using a peptide aptamer, Trx-SARA, which comprises a rigid scaffold, the Escherichia coli thioredoxin A protein (Trx), displaying a constrained 56-amino acid Smad-binding motif from the Smad anchor for receptor activation (SARA) protein. Trx-SARA bound specifically to Smad2 and Smad3 and inhibited both TGF-beta-induced reporter gene expression and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in NMuMG murine mammary epithelial cells. In contrast to Smad7, Trx-SARA had no effect on the Smad2 or 3 phosphorylation levels induced by TGF-beta1. Trx-SARA was primarily localized to the nucleus and perturbed the normal cytoplasmic localization of Smad2 and 3 to a nuclear localization in the absence of TGF-beta1, consistent with reduced Smad nuclear export. The key mode of action of Trx-SARA was to reduce the level of Smad2 and Smad3 in complex with Smad4 after TGF-beta1 stimulation, a mechanism of action consistent with the preferential binding of SARA to monomeric Smad protein and Trx-SARA-mediated disruption of active Smad complexes.\n\nSARA: a software environment for the analysis of relaxation data acquired with accordion spectroscopy\n\nPubMed Central\n\nHarden, Bradley J.\n\n2014-01-01\n\nWe present SARA (Software for Accordion Relaxation Analysis), an interactive and user-friendly MATLAB software environment designed for analyzing relaxation data obtained with accordion spectroscopy. Accordion spectroscopy can be used to measure nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) relaxation rates in a fraction of the time required by traditional methods, yet data analysis can be intimidating and no unified software packages are available to assist investigators. Hence, the technique has not achieved widespread use within the NMR community. SARA offers users a selection of analysis protocols spanning those presented in the literature thus far, with modifications permitting a more general application to crowded spectra such as those of proteins. We discuss the advantages and limitations of each fitting method and suggest a protocol combining the strengths of each procedure to achieve optimal results. In the end, SARA provides an environment for facile extraction of relaxation rates and should promote routine application of accordion relaxation spectroscopy.

Protein abundance was determined using a quantitative value termed normalized peptide number, and overall, proteins known to be associated with the cell wall were more abundant early on in growth, while proteins known to be secreted into the surrounding milieu were more abundant late in growth. In addition, proteins from spent media and cell lysates of strain UAMS-1 and its isogenic sarA, agr, and sarA agr regulatory mutant strains during exponential growth were identified, and their relative abundances were compared. Extracellular proteins known to be regulated by the global regulators sarA and agr displayed protein levels in accordance with what is known regarding the effects of these regulators. For example, cysteine protease (SspB), endopeptidase (SspA), staphopain (ScpA), and aureolysin (Aur) were higher in abundance in the sarA and sarA agr mutants than in strain UAMS-1. The immunoglobulin G (IgG)-binding protein (Sbi), immunodominant staphylococcal antigen A (IsaA), IgG-binding protein A (Spa), and the heme-iron-binding protein (IsdA) were most abundant in the agr mutant background. Proteins whose abundance was decreased in the sarA mutant included fibrinogen-binding protein (Fib [Efb]), IsaA, lipase 1 and 2, and two proteins identified as putative leukocidin F and S subunits of the two-component leukotoxin family. Collectively, this approach identified 1,263 proteins (matches of two peptides or more) and provided a convenient and reliable way of identifying proteins and comparing their relative abundances.\n\n50 Lessons in Sara-Ngambay, Volume 2.

SARA observatories comprise a 0.96 m telescope at Kitt Peak, Arizona; one of 0.6 m aperture on Cerro Tololo, Chile; and the 1 m Jacobus Kapteyn Telescope at the Roque de los Muchachos, La Palma, Spain. All are operated using standard VNC or Radmin protocols communicating with on-site PCs. Remote operation offers considerable flexibility in scheduling, allowing long-term observational cadences difficult to achieve with classical observing at remote facilities, as well as obvious travel savings. Multiple observers at different locations can share a telescope for training, educational use, or collaborative research programs. Each telescope has a CCD system for optical imaging, using thermoelectric cooling to avoid the need for frequent local service, and a second CCD for offset guiding. The Arizona and Chile telescopes also have fiber-fed echelle spectrographs. Switching between imaging and spectroscopy is very rapid, so a night can easily accommodate mixed observing modes. We present some sample observational programs. For the benefit of other groups organizing similar consortia, we describe the operating structure and principles of SARA, as well as some lessons learned from almost 20 years of remote operations.\n\nChanges in Microbiota in Rumen Digesta and Feces Due to a Grain-Based Subacute Ruminal Acidosis (SARA) Challenge.\n\nPubMed\n\nPlaizier, Jan C; Li, Shucong; Danscher, Anne Mette; Derakshani, Hooman; Andersen, Pia H; Khafipour, Ehsan\n\n2017-08-01\n\nThe effects of a grain-based subacute ruminal acidosis (SARA) challenge on bacteria in the rumen and feces of lactating dairy cows were determined. Six lactating, rumen-cannulated Danish Holstein cows were used in a cross-over study with two periods. Periods included two cows on a control diet and two cows on a SARA challenge. The control diet was a total mixed ration containing 45.5% dry matter (DM), 43.8% DM neutral detergent fiber, and 19.6% DM starch. The SARA challenge was conducted by gradually substituting the control diet with pellets containing 50% wheat and 50% barley over 3Â days to reach a diet containing 55.6% DM, 31.3% DM neutral detergent fiber, and 31.8% DM starch, which was fed for four more days. Rumen fluid samples were collected at day 7 and 10 of experimental periods. Feces samples were collected on days 8 and 10 of these periods. Extracted DNA from the rumen and feces samples was analyzed to assess their bacterial communities using MiSeq Illumina sequencing of the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene. The induction of SARA reduced the richness, diversity, and stability of bacterial communities and resulted in distinctly different microbiota in the rumen and feces. Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes were the most abundant phyla and, combined, they represented 76.9 and 94.4% of the bacterial community in the rumen fluid and the feces, respectively. Only the relative abundance of Firmicutes in the rumen was increased by the SARA challenge. In rumen fluid and feces, the abundances of nine out of the 90 and 25 out of the 89 taxa, respectively, were affected by the challenge. Hence, SARAÂ challenge altered the composition of the bacterial community at the lower taxonomical level in the feces and therefore also likely in the hindgut, as well as in the rumen. However, only reductions in the bacterial richness and diversity in the rumen fluid and feces were in agreement with those of other studies and had a biological basis. Although the composition of the\n\nANTS/SARA: Future Observation of Saturn's Rings\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nClark, P. E.; Rilee, M. L.; Curtis, S. A.; Cheung, C. Y.; Mumma, M. J.\n\n2004-05-01\n\nThe Saturn Autonomous Ring Array (SARA) mission concept applies the Autonomous Nano-Technology Swarm (ANTS) architecture, a paradigm developed for exploration of high surface area and/or multi-body targets. ANTS architecture involves large numbers of tiny, highly autonomous, yet socially interactive, craft, in a small number of specialist classes. SARA will acquire in situ observations in the high gravity environment of Saturn's rings. The high potential for collision represents an insurmountable challenge for previous mission designs. Each ANTS nanocraft weighs approximately a kilogram, and thus requires gossamer structures for all subsystems. Individual specialists include Workers, the vast majority, that acquire scientific measurements, as well as Messenger/Rulers that provide communication and coordination. The high density distribution of particles combines with the high intensity gravity and magnetic field environment to produce dynamic plasmas. Plasma, particle, wave, and field detectors will take measurements from the edge of the ring plane to observe the result of particle interactions. Imagers and spectrome-ters would measure variations composition and dust/gas ratio among particles using a strategy for serial rendezvous with individual particles. The numbers and distances of these particles, as well as anticipated high attrition rate, re-quire hundreds of spacecraft to characterize thousands of particles and ring features over the course of the mission. The bimodal propulsion system would include a large solar sail carrier for transporting the swarm the long distance in low gravity between deployment site and the target, and a nuclear system for each craft for maneuvering in the high gravity regime of Saturn's rings.\n\nSARAS 2 Constraints on Global 21 cm Signals from the Epoch of Reionization\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSingh, Saurabh; Subrahmanyan, Ravi; Udaya Shankar, N.; Sathyanarayana Rao, Mayuri; Fialkov, Anastasia; Cohen, Aviad; Barkana, Rennan; Girish, B.

S.\n\n2018-05-01\n\nSpectral distortions in the cosmic microwave background over the 40â200 MHz band are imprinted by neutral hydrogen in the intergalactic medium prior to the end of reionization. This signal, produced in the redshift range z = 6â34 at the rest-frame wavelength of 21 cm, has not been detected yet; and a poor understanding of high-redshift astrophysics results in a large uncertainty in the expected spectrum. The SARAS 2 radiometer was purposely designed to detect the sky-averaged 21 cm signal. The instrument, deployed at the Timbaktu Collective (Southern India) in 2017 AprilâJune, collected 63 hr of science data, which were examined for the presence of the cosmological 21 cm signal. In our previous work, the first-light data from the SARAS 2 radiometer were analyzed with Bayesian likelihood-ratio tests using 264 plausible astrophysical scenarios. In this paper we reexamine the data using an improved analysis based on the frequentist approach and forward-modeling. We show that SARAS 2 data reject 20 models, out of which 15 are rejected at a significance >5Ï. All the rejected models share the scenario of inefficient heating of the primordial gas by the first population of X-ray sources, along with rapid reionization.

S.; Greiner, J.; Hartmann, D. H.; Schady, P.\n\n2018-06-01\n\nBL Lacertae (BL Lac) objects are prominent members of the third Fermi Large Area Telescope catalog of Î³-ray sources. Half of the members of the BL Lac population (â¼300) lack redshift measurements, which is due to the absence of lines in their optical spectra, thereby making it difficult to utilize spectroscopic methods. Our photometric dropout technique can be used to establish the redshift for a fraction of these sources. This work employed six filters mounted on the Swift-UVOT and four optical filters on two telescopes, the 0.65 m SARA-CTIO in Chile and 1.0 m SARA-ORM in the Canary Islands, Spain. A sample of 15 sources was extracted from the Swift archival data for which six filter UVOT observations were conducted. By complementing the Swift observations with the SARA ones, we were able to discover two high-redshift sources: 3FGL J1155.4-3417 and 3FGL J1156.7â2250 at z={1.83}-0.13+0.10 and z={1.73}-0.19+0.11, respectively, resulting from the dropouts in the power-law template fits to these data. The discoveries add to the important (26 total) sample of high-redshift BL Lacs. While the sample of high-z BL Lacs is still rather small, these objects do not seem to fit well within known schemes of the blazar population and represent the best probes of the extragalactic background light.\n\nAnderson's disease (chylomicron retention disease): a new mutation in the SARA2 gene associated with muscular and cardiac abnormalities.\n\nPubMed\n\nSilvain, M; Bligny, D; Aparicio, T; LaforÃªt, P; Grodet, A; Peretti, N; MÃ©nard, D; Djouadi, F; Jardel, C; BÃ©guÃ©, J M; Walker, F; Schmitz, J; Lachaux, A; Aggerbeck, L P; Samson-Bouma, M E\n\n2008-12-01\n\nAnderson's disease (AD) or chylomicron retention disease (CMRD) is a rare hereditary lipid malabsorption syndrome linked to SARA2 gene mutations. We report in this study a novel mutation in two sisters for which the Sar1b protein is predicted to be truncated by 32 amino acids at its carboxyl-terminus. Because the SARA2 gene is also expressed in the muscle, heart, liver and placenta, extraintestinal clinical manifestations may exist. For the first time, we describe in this study in the two sisters muscular as well as cardiac abnormalities that could be related to the reported expression of SARA2 in these tissues. We also evaluated six other patients for potential manifestations of the SARA2 mutation. The creatine phosphokinase levels were increased in all patients [1.5-9.4 x normal (N)] and transaminases were moderately elevated in five of the eight patients (1.2-2.6 x N), probably related to muscle disease rather than to liver dysfunction. A decreased ejection fraction occurred in one patient (40%, N: 60%). The muscle, liver and placental tissues that were examined had no specific abnormalities and, in particular, no lipid accumulation. These results suggest that myolysis and other extraintestinal abnormalities can occur in AD/CMRD and that the clinical evaluation of patients should reflect this.\n\nSarA based novel therapeutic candidate against Staphylococcus aureus associated with vascular graft infections.\n\nPubMed\n\nArya, Rekha; Ravikumar, R; Santhosh, R S; Princy, S Adline\n\n2015-01-01\n\nStaphylococcus aureus is a common pathogen seen in prosthetic vascular graft, leading to high morbidity and mortality. The virulence genes for severity of infections are under the control of global regulators. Staphylococcal accessory regulator A (SarA) a known master controller of biofilm formation is an attractive target for the drug development. A structure based screening of lead compounds was employed for the identification of novel small molecule inhibitors targeted to interact to the DNA binding domain of the transcriptional activator, SarA and hinder its response over the control of genes that up-regulate the phenotype, biofilm. The top-hit SarA selective inhibitor, 4-[(2,4-diflurobenzyl)amino] cyclohexanol (SarABI) was further validated in-vitro for its efficacy. The SarABI was found to have MBIC50value of 200 Î¼g/ml and also down-regulated the expression of the RNA effector, (RNAIII), Hemolysin (hld), and fibronectin-binding protein (fnbA). The anti-adherence property of SarABI on S. aureus invasion to the host epithelial cell lines (Hep-2) was examined where no significant attachment of S. aureus was observed. The SarABI inhibits the colonization of MDR S. aureus in animal model experiment significantly cohere to the molecular docking studies and in vitro experiments. So, we propose that the SarABI could be a novel substitute to overcome a higher degree of MDR S. aureus colonization on vascular graft.\n\nValidity and reliability of the International Cooperative Ataxia Rating Scale (ICARS) and the Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA) in multiple sclerosis patients with ataxia.\n\nPubMed\n\nSalcÄ±, Yeliz; Fil, Ayla; Keklicek, Hilal; Ãetin, BarÄ±Å; Armutlu, Kadriye; Dolgun, AnÄ±l; Tuncer, AslÄ±; Karabudak, Rana\n\n2017-11-01\n\nAtaxia is an extremely common problem in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. Thus, appropriate scales are required for detailed assessment of this issue. The aim of our study was to investigate the reliability and validity of the Turkish version of the International Cooperative Ataxia Rating Scale (ICARS) and Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA), which are widely used in ataxia evaluation in the context of other cerebellar diseases. This cross-sectional study included 80 MS patients with Kurtzke cerebellar functional system score (C-FSS) greater than zero and slight pyramidal involvement. The Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), C-FSS, and Berg Balance Scale (BBS) were administered. SARA and ICARS were assessed on first admission by two physical therapists. Seven days later, second assessments were repeated in same way for reliability. Intra-rater and inter-rater reliability were found to be high for both ICARS and SARA (p< 0.001) The Cronbach's Î± coefficients were 0.922 and 0.921 for SARA (reviewer 1 and reviewer 2 respectively) and 0.952 and 0.952 for ICARS (reviewer 1 and reviewer 2, respectively). There were no floor or ceiling effects determined for either scale except for item 17 of ICARS (p= 0.055). The EDSS total score had significant correlations with both SARA and ICARS (rho: 0.557 and 0.707, respectively). C-FSS had moderate correlation with SARA and high correlation with ICARS (rho: 0.469 and 0.653, respectively). BBS had no significant correlation with SARA and ICARS. (rho: -0.048 and -0.008 respectively). According to the area under the curve (AUC) value, ICARS is the best scale to discriminate mild and moderate ataxia. (AUC: 0.875). Factor analyses of ICARS showed that the rating results were determined by five different factors that did not coincide with the ICARS sub-scales. Our study demonstrated that ICARS and SARA are both reliable in MS patients with ataxia. Although ICARS has some structural problems, it seems to be more\n\nImpact of subacute ruminal acidosis (SARA) adaptation on rumen microbiota in dairy cattle using pyrosequencing.\n\nPubMed\n\nMao, S Y; Zhang, R Y; Wang, D S; Zhu, W Y\n\n2013-12-01\n\nThe objective of this study was to evaluate the changes in bacterial populations in the rumen of dairy cattle following adaptation to subacute ruminal acidosis (SARA) using 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing. Rumen contents were collected from four cattle adapted to either a 40% (control diet, COD) or 70% (SARA induction diet, SAID) concentrate feeds. DNA was extracted from each of the samples. Bacterial 16S rRNA genes of ruminal DNA extracts were PCR amplified with 2 bar coded primer sets and sequenced by 454 pyrosequencing. At a high taxonomic level, the percentage of Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes were reduced by SAID feeding, whereas Firmicutes and Actinobacteria were more abundant in the SAID than in the COD group. At the genus level, as compared with the COD group, the abundances of Prevotella, Treponema, Anaeroplasma, Papillibacter, Acinetobacter and unclassified populations including unclassified Lentisphaerae, and unclassified bacteria were lower (P < 0.05), while the percentages of Ruminococcus, Atopobium, unclassified Clostridiales and Bifidobacterium were increased (P < 0.05) in the SAID group. Feeding of SAID reduced (P < 0.001) the diversity of the rumen microbial community. Taken together, our findings provide a comprehensive picture of current knowledge of the community structure of the rumen bacterial ecosystem during SARA, and enhance our understanding about the ruminal microbial ecology that may be useful in the prevention of ruminal acidosis.

SARA was induced by feeding a SARA-inducing diet, and thereafter, 20, 50 or 100 g per head of a commercial BP was administered for 7 consecutive days during the morning feeding. Cattle without BP served as the control. The 24-hr mean ruminal pH in the control was lower, whereas those in the BP groups administered 20 or 50 g were significantly higher compared to the control from days 2 to 7. Circadian patterns of the 1-hr mean ruminal pH were identical (6.4-6.8) among all cattle receiving BP. Although the mean minimum pH in the control on day -7 and day 0 was <5.8, the pH in the treatment groups on day 7 was >5.8 and significantly higher than that of the control group ( >5.2). Ruminal volatile fatty acid (VFA) concentrations were not affected by BP treatment; however, the BP groups had lower lactic acid levels compared with the control group at 20:00 on day 7. Additionally, non-esterified fatty acid levels decreased from 8:00 to 20:00 in all BP groups on day 7. These results suggest that administration of 20 to 50 g of a multi-strain BP for 7 days might improve the low pH and high lactic acid level of the ruminal fluid in SARA cattle.\n\nEffects of a bacterial probiotic on ruminal pH and volatile fatty acids during subacute ruminal acidosis (SARA) in cattle\n\nPubMed Central\n\nGOTO, Hiroko; QADIS, Abdul Qadir; KIM, Yo-Han; IKUTA, Kentaro; ICHIJO, Toshihiro; SATO, Shigeru\n\n2016-01-01\n\nEffects of a bacterial probiotic (BP) on ruminal fermentation and plasma metabolites were evaluated in four Holstein cattle (body weight, 645 Â± 62 kg; mean Â± SD) with induced subacute ruminal acidosis (SARA).

Installed in 1968 this Boller & Chivens telescope fell into disuse for almost 20 years. The telescope and observatory have undergone a major restoration. A new dome with a wide slit has been fully automated with an ACE SmartDome controller featuring autonomous closure. The telescope was completely gutted, repainted, and virtually every electronic component and wire replaced. Modern infrastructure, such as USB, Ethernet and video ports have been incorporated into the telescope tube saddle boxes. Absolute encoders have been placed on the Hour Angle and declination axes with a resolution of less than 0.7 arc seconds. The secondary mirror is also equipped with an absolute encoder and temperature sensor to allow for fully automated focus. New mirror coatings, automated mirror covers, a new 150mm refractor, and new instrumentation have been deployed. An integrated X-stage guider and dual filter wheel containing 18 filters is used for direct imaging. The guider camera can be easily removed and a standard 2-inch eyepiece used for occasional viewing by VIP's at C.T.I.O. A 12 megapixel all-sky camera produces color images every 30 seconds showing details in the Milky Way and Magellanic Clouds. Two low light level cameras are deployed; one on the finder and one at the top of the telescope showing a 30Â° field. Other auxiliary equipment, including daytime color video cameras, weather station and remotely controllable power outlets permit complete control and servicing of the system. The SARA Consortium (www.saraobservatory.org), a collection of ten eastern universities, also operates a 0.9-m telescope at the Kitt Peak National Observatory using an almost identical set of instruments with the same ACE control system. This project was funded by the SARA Consortium.\n\nImpact of the Regulators SigB, Rot, SarA and sarS on the Toxic Shock Tst Promoter and TSST-1 Expression in Staphylococcus aureus\n\nPubMed Central\n\nVillanueva, Maite; Renzoni, Adriana; Monod, Antoinette; Barras, Christine; Rodriguez, Natalia; Kelley, William L.\n\n2015-01-01\n\nStaphylococcus aureus is an important pathogen manifesting virulence through diverse disease forms, ranging from acute skin infections to life-threatening bacteremia or systemic toxic shock syndromes. In the latter case, the prototypical superantigen is TSST-1 (Toxic Shock Syndrome Toxin 1), encoded by tst(H), and carried on a mobile genetic element that is not present in all S. aureus strains. Transcriptional regulation of tst is only partially understood. In this study, we dissected the role of sarA, sarS (sarH1), RNAIII, rot, and the alternative stress sigma factor sigB (ÏB). By examining tst promoter regulation predominantly in the context of its native sequence within the SaPI1 pathogenicity island of strain RN4282, we discovered that ÏB emerged as a particularly important tst regulator. We did not detect a consensus ÏB site within the tst promoter, and thus the effect of ÏB is likely indirect. We found that ÏB strongly repressed the expression of the toxin via at least two distinct regulatory pathways dependent upon sarA and agr. Furthermore rot, a member of SarA family, was shown to repress tst expression when overexpressed, although its deletion had no consistent measurable effect. We could not find any detectable effect of sarS, either by deletion or overexpression, suggesting that this regulator plays a minimal role in TSST-1 expression except when combined with disruption of sarA. Collectively, our results extend our understanding of complex multifactorial regulation of tst, revealing several layers of negative regulation. In addition to environmental stimuli thought to impact TSST-1 production, these findings support a model whereby sporadic mutation in a few key negative regulators can profoundly affect and enhance TSST-1 expression.

H.; Sival, Deborah A.\n\n2017-01-01\n\nAim: In children, gait and posture assessment provides a crucial marker for the early characterization, surveillance and treatment evaluation of early onset ataxia (EOA). For reliable data entry of studies targeting at gait and posture improvement, uniform quantitative biomarkers are necessary. Until now, the pediatric test construct of gait and posture scores of the Scale for Assessment and Rating of Ataxia sub-scale (SARA) is still unclear. In the present study, we aimed to validate the construct validity and reliability of the pediatric (SARAGAIT/POSTURE) sub-scale. Methods: We included 28 EOA patients [15.5 (6â34) years; median (range)]. For inter-observer reliability, we determined the ICC on EOA SARAGAIT/POSTURE sub-scores by three independent pediatric neurologists. For convergent validity, we associated SARAGAIT/POSTURE sub-scores with: (1) Ataxic gait Severity Measurement by Klockgether (ASMK; dynamic balance), (2) Pediatric Balance Scale (PBS; static balance), (3) Gross Motor Function Classification Scale -extended and revised version (GMFCS-E&R), (4) SARA-kinetic scores (SARAKINETIC; kinetic function of the upper and lower limbs), (5) Archimedes Spiral (AS; kinetic function of the upper limbs), and (6) total SARA scores (SARATOTAL; i.e., summed SARAGAIT/POSTURE, SARAKINETIC, and SARASPEECH sub-scores). For discriminant validity, we investigated whether EOA co-morbidity factors (myopathy and myoclonus) could influence SARAGAIT/POSTURE sub-scores. Results: The inter-observer agreement (ICC) on EOA SARAGAIT/POSTURE sub-scores was high (0.97). SARAGAIT/POSTURE was strongly correlated with the other ataxia and functional scales [ASMK (rs = -0.819; p < 0.001); PBS (rs = -0.943; p < 0.001); GMFCS-E&R (rs = -0.862; p < 0.001); SARAKINETIC (rs = 0.726; p < 0.001); AS (rs = 0.609; p = 0.002); and SARATOTAL (rs = 0.935; p < 0.001)]. Comorbid myopathy influenced SARAGAIT/POSTURE scores by concurrent muscle weakness, whereas comorbid myoclonus predominantly\n\nSARAS 2: a spectral radiometer for probing cosmic dawn and the epoch of reionization through detection of the global 21-cm signal\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSingh, Saurabh; Subrahmanyan, Ravi; Shankar, N. Udaya; Rao, Mayuri Sathyanarayana; Girish, B. S.; Raghunathan, A.; Somashekar, R.; Srivani, K. S.\n\n2018-04-01\n\nThe global 21-cm signal from Cosmic Dawn (CD) and the Epoch of Reionization (EoR), at redshifts z Ë 6-30, probes the nature of first sources of radiation as well as physics of the Inter-Galactic Medium (IGM). Given that the signal is predicted to be extremely weak, of wide fractional bandwidth, and lies in a frequency range that is dominated by Galactic and Extragalactic foregrounds as well as Radio Frequency Interference, detection of the signal is a daunting task. Critical to the experiment is the manner in which the sky signal is represented through the instrument. It is of utmost importance to design a system whose spectral bandpass and additive spurious signals can be well calibrated and any calibration residual does not mimic the signal. Shaped Antenna measurement of the background RAdio Spectrum (SARAS) is an ongoing experiment that aims to detect the global 21-cm signal. Here we present the design philosophy of the SARAS 2 system and discuss its performance and limitations based on laboratory and field measurements. Laboratory tests with the antenna replaced with a variety of terminations, including a network model for the antenna impedance, show that the gain calibration and modeling of internal additive signals leave no residuals with Fourier amplitudes exceeding 2 mK, or residual Gaussians of 25 MHz width with amplitudes exceeding 2 mK. Thus, even accounting for reflection and radiation efficiency losses in the antenna, the SARAS 2 system is capable of detection of complex 21-cm profiles at the level predicted by currently favoured models for thermal baryon evolution.\n\nSara Ruddick's theory of maternal thinking applied to traditional Irish mothering.\n\nPubMed\n\nRadosh, Polly F\n\n2008-07-01\n\nThis paper uses Sara Ruddick's theory of maternal thinking to explain patterns of Irish mothering that developed in Ireland following the Great Famine of 1845-1852. Ruddick's central thesis, that maternal thinking develops strategies for preserving the life of the child, fostering the child's growth, and shaping an acceptable child, is applied to the intersecting influences of famine memory, religion, education, and emigration in post-famine Ireland. The strict, moralistic, and highly inhibiting features of Irish culture that dominated the nineteenth and twentieth centuries are traceable to patterns of mothering that developed after the famine. While Irish mothers are often blamed for instilling values that stressed sexual repression and guilt, other cultural factors influenced maternal thinking. Mothers did foster highly repressive moral values that encouraged permanent celibacy and delayed marriage. This paper examines the larger cultural features that derived from political oppression and the famine as they imprinted these values.\n\nPushing and Pulling Sara: A Case Study of the Contrasting Influences of High School and University Experiences on Engineering Agency, Identity, and Participation\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nGodwin, Allison; Potvin, Geoff\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThis manuscript reports a longitudinal case study of how one woman, Sara, who had previously considered dropping out of high school, authored strong mathematics and science identities and purposefully exhibited agency through her experiences in high school science.

B.; Futaana, Y.; Asamura, K.; Kazama, Y.; McCann, D.; Varier, S.; Vijayakumar, E.; Mohankumar, S. V.; Raghavendra, K. V.; Kurian, T.; Thampi, R. S.; Andersson, H.; Svensson, J.; Karlsson, S.; Fischer, J.; Holmstrom, M.; Wurz, P.; Lundin, R.\n\nThe SARA experiment aboard the Indian lunar mission Chandrayaan-1 consists of two instruments: Chandrayaan-1 Energetic Neutral Analyzer (CENA) and the SolarWind Monitor (SWIM). CENA will provide measurements of low energy neutral atoms sputtered from lunar surface in the 0.01-3.3 keV energy range by the impact of solar wind ions. SWIM will monitor the solar wind flux precipitating onto the lunar surface and in the vicinity of moon. SWIM is basically an ion-mass analyzer providing energy-per-charge and number density of solar wind ions in the energy range 0.01-15 keV. It has sufficient mass resolution to resolve H+ , He++, He+, O++, O+, and >20 amu, with energy resolution 7% and angular resolution 4:5Â° Ã 22:5. The viewing angle of the instrument is 9Â° Ã 180Â°.Mechanically, SWIM consists of a sensor and an electronic board that includes high voltage supply and sensor electronics. The sensor part consists of an electrostatic deflector to analyze the arrival angle of the ions, cylindrical electrostatic analyzer for energy analysis, and the time-of-flight system for particle velocity determination. The total size of SWIM is slightly larger than a credit card and has a mass of 500 g.\n\nThe Moon observed in Energetic Neutral Atoms: Review of the Scientific Findings from SARA/CENA on board Chandrayaan-1\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nVorburger, Audrey; Wurz, Peter; Barabash, Stas; Wieser, Martin; Futaana, Yoshifumi; Bhardwaj, Anil; Dhanya, Mb; Asamura, Kazushi\n\n2017-04-01\n\nThe Sub-keV Atom Reflecting Analyzer (SARA) instrument on board Chandrayaan-1 was exceptionally successful. The instrument not only achieved all its set science goals but also revealed several hitherto unknown and unexpected properties of the solar wind interaction with the lunar surface. SARA's scientific findings can be divided into two groups based on the nature of the particles detected: The first group contains findings gained from ion measurements (from SWIM, SARA's ion sensor) whereas the second group contains findings gained from energetic neutral atom (ENA) measurements (from CENA, SARA's ENA sensor). Here, we present a review of all scientific findings based on ENA measurements. Since the Moon is constantly bombarded by solar wind ions. Until recently, it was tacitly assumed that the ions that impinge onto the lunar surface are almost completely absorbed, with less than 1% reflection, (e.g. Crider and Vondrak, Adv. Space Res., 2002; Feldman et al., JGR, 2000). However, recent observations conducted showed that on average 16% of the impinging solar wind ions are reflected as ENAs (e.g. McComas et al., GRL, 2009; Wieser et al., PSS, 2009; Vorburger et al., JGR, 2013). The energy spectrum of the reflected ENAs is broader than the spectrum of the incident solar wind protons (Futaana et al., JGR, 2012; Harada et al., JGR, 2014), and the characteristic energy is < 50% of the incident solar wind characteristic energy. This hints at multiple scattering processes taking place on the lunar surface. Determination of the ENA angular backscatter function showed that, contrary to expectations, as the solar zenith angle (SZA) increases, particles scatter more toward the sunward direction than in the anti-sunward direction (Vorburger et al., GRL, 2011; Lue et al., JGR, 2016). The ENA reflection ratio is rather featureless over the lunar surface (Vorburger et al., JGR., 2013), showing only strong variations at local crustal magnetic fields due to the interaction of the\n\nSara Lee: Improved Compressed Air System Increases Efficiency and Saves Energy at an Industrial Bakery\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nNot Available\n\nThis case study was prepared for the Industrial Technologies Program of the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE); it describes the energy and costs savings resulting from improving the compressed air system of a large Sara Lee bakery in Sacramento, California. The compressed air system supports many operations of the bread-making machines, and it had been performing poorly. A specialist from Draw Professional Services, a DOE Allied Partner, evaluated the system, and his suggestions included repairing a controller, fixing leaks, and replacing a compressor with a new one fitted with an energy-saving variable-speed drive. As a result, the bakery has reducedmoreÂ Â» its energy use by 471,000 kilowatt-hours annually and is saving $50,000 per year in operating and maintenance costs.Â«Â less\n\nSocial humanoid robot SARA: development of the wrist mechanism\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPenÄiÄ, M.; Rackov, M.; ÄaviÄ, M.; Kiss, I.; CioatÄ, V. G.\n\n2018-01-01\n\nThis paper presents the development of a wrist mechanism for humanoid robots. The research was conducted within the project which develops social humanoid robot Sara - a mobile anthropomorphic platform for researching the social behaviour of robots. There are two basic ways for the realization of humanoid wrist. The first one is based on biologically inspired structures that have variable stiffness, and the second one on low backlash mechanisms that have high stiffness. Our solution is low backlash differential mechanism that requires small actuators. Based on the kinematic-dynamic requirements, a dynamic model of the robot wrist is formed. A dynamic simulation for several hand positions was performed and the driving torques of the wrist mechanism were determined. The realized wrist has 2 DOFs and enables movements in the direction of flexion/extension 115Â°, ulnar/radial deviation Â±45Â° and the combination of these two movements. It consists of a differential mechanism with three spur bevel gears, two of which are driving and identical, while the last one is the driven gear to which the robot hand is attached. Power transmission and motion from the actuator to the input links of the differential mechanism is realized with two parallel placed identical gear mechanisms. The wrist mechanism has high carrying capacity and reliability, high efficiency, a compact design and low backlash that provides high positioning accuracy and repeatability of movements, which is essential for motion control.\n\n\"Sailing in Paper Boats\" Sexual Trauma, Psychosis, and a Critical Examination of the Freudian Metaphor in Antonia White's Autobiographical Fiction.\n\nPubMed\n\nNewton, Marcia Anne\n\n2016-01-01\n\nThis paper is part of a larger project on Catholic writer Antonia Whiteâs series of autobiographical novels, Frost in May, The Lost Traveller, and The Sugar House, in which readers are presented with a Freudian Oedipal drama that reaches a dramatic climax in the last autobiographical novel in the series, Beyond the Glass, where the main protagonist spirals into psychosis. A central question addressed is whether or not Whiteâs autobiographical fiction is an unconscious projection of sexual trauma from her own history. Psychoanalytically speaking, the answer depends upon whether one subscribes to Freudian or Ferenczian perspectives. The paper also addresses the question of whether Whiteâs accounts of psychosis in her autobiographical fiction are real and meaningful descriptions of lived traumatic experiences. Jacques Lacan asserts that it is impossible to authenticate narratives of psychosis and for readers to draw any meaningful value from them because they lack a coherent transfer of metaphorical language from the unconscious to the conscious in the pursuit of truth of a lived experience. He uses Judge Daniel Paul Schreberâs Memoirs of My Nervous Illness to support his case, a text in which Schreber confesses to only being able to communicate his experiences in similes and metaphors; therefore, he claims his experiences cannot be understood. I argue that Lacan does not give due credit to Schreberâs attempts to grapple with spiritual and sexual preservation in the throes of delusion through the agency of his alter egos. These alter egos are the other âself,â a deluded self that offers, paradoxically, truth to emotional experience of a manâs ego in crisis. Schreber shares these pursuits with Whiteâs alter egos in her autobiographical fiction, âThe House of Cloudsâ and Beyond the Glass. In an analysis of Whiteâs texts as recollections of her personal history, I highlight how Whiteâs experiences shape her testimony in its raw portrayal of an\n\nChemoprevention of Breast Cancer by Mimicking the Protective Effect of Early First Birth\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n2009-06-01\n\nmammary gland.

However, the molecular mechanism underlying Kindlin-1 regulation of TGF-Î²/Smad3 signaling remains elusive. Here, we reported that Kindlin-1 is an important mediator of TGF-Î²/Smad3 signaling by showing that Kindlin-1 physically interacts with TGF-Î² receptor I (TÎ²RI), Smad anchor for receptor activation (SARA) and Smad3. Kindlin-1 is required for the interaction of Smad3 with TÎ²RI, Smad3 phosphorylation, nuclear translocation, and finally the activation of TGF-Î²/Smad3 signaling pathway. Functionally, Kindlin-1 promoted colorectal cancer (CRC) cell proliferation in vitro and tumor growth in vivo, and was also required for CRC cell migration and invasion via an epithelial to mesenchymal transition. Kindlin-1 was found to be increased with the CRC progression from stages I to IV. Importantly, raised expression level of Kindlin-1 correlates with poor outcome in CRC patients. Taken together, we demonstrated that Kindlin-1 promotes CRC progression by recruiting SARA and Smad3 to TÎ²RI and thereby activates TGF-Î²/Smad3 signaling. Thus, Kindlin-1 is a novel regulator of TGF-Î²/Smad3 signaling and may also be a potential target for CRC therapeutics.

Granitic rocks yielded a Rbî¸Sr whole rock isochron age of 2555 Â± 101 Ma with an initial {87Sr}/{86Sr} ratio of 0.70121 Â± 0.00038. This age represents the time of granitoid emplacement. Kî¸Ar mineral ages range from 574 to 3420 Ma, which is very variable with respect to mineral type and locality. Mylonitic granodiorite very close to the Nandi Escarpment gave a Kî¸Ar age of 916 Ma from biotite, suggesting the time of the activity of the Nandi Fault, which may be an earlier phase of the Pan-African Orogeny. Ages of biotites in a zone between 4 and 6 km northeast of the Nandi Fault are anomalously high compared to those of coexisting hornblende and the Rbî¸Sr isochron age, confirming the existence of excess 40Ar in biotite. Excess 40Ar was probably introduced into biotite under the appropriate temperature conditions prevailing near the Nandi Fault. Taramite, a rare sodic-calcic amphibole, was found in a cordierite-biotite gneiss of the Kavirondian Supergroup and gave a typical Pan-African Kî¸Ar age of 574 Ma.

These were Nandi County, which is the main maize growing region in the country but where no human aflatoxicoses have been reported, and Makueni County where most of the aflatoxicosis cases have occurred. Two hundred and fifty-five households were sampled in Nandi and 258 in Makueni, and Aspergillus was isolated from maize. Aspergillus flavus and A. parasiticus isolates were tested for the presence of aflD and aflQ genes. Positive strains were induced to produce aflatoxins on yeast extract sucrose and quantified using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LCMSMS). Aspergillus flavus was the most common contaminant, and the incidence of occurrence in Nandi and Makueni was not significantly different (82.33% and 73.26%, respectively). Toxigenic strains were more prevalent than non-toxigenic strains. All the toxigenic strains from Makueni were of the S-type while those from Nandi belonged to the L-type. Quantitative differences in aflatoxin production in vitro between isolates and between strains were detected with S strains producing relatively larger amounts of total aflatoxins, B toxins and lower values for G toxins. This was in accord with the frequent aflatoxicosis outbreaks in Makueni. However some L strains produced considerable amounts of B toxins. Given the widespread distribution of toxigenic strains in both regions, the risk of aflatoxin poisoning is high when favorable conditions for toxin production occur.

Structural and socio-cultural constraints and forms of violence, including global and local economic inequalities, migration, racism, and intimate, gender-based abuses in both home and receiving countries interact in Antonia's experience to produce suffering and influence a form of gendered agency. This analysis points to the need for research and policies specifically designed to attend to the intersecting vulnerabilities migrant women who suffer DV often face, as well as their agentive acts.\n\nSARA South Observations and Analysis of the Solar Type, Totally Eclipsing, Over Contact Binary, PY Aquarii\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nChamberlain, Heather; Samec, Ronald G.; Caton, Daniel Bruce; Van Hamme, Walter\n\n2018-01-01\n\nPY Aqr (GSC 05191-00853) is a solar Type (T ~ 5750K) eclipsing binary. It was observed in July to October, 2017 at Cerro Tololo in remote mode with the 0.6-m SARA South reflector. Two times of minimum light were calculated from our present observations, a primary and a secondary eclipse:HJD Min I = 2457951.7762Â±0.0006 HJD Min II = 2458019.5295Â±00.0003. Both weighted as 1.0.In addition, four timings were determined from online data given in IBVS 5600 and five observations at minima were determined from archived All Sky Automated Survey Data:HJD Min I = 2452908.3165, 2452912.33612 HJD Min II = 2452877.5621, 2452913.34465. All weighted as 0.5.ASAS Observations at minima: 2452094.688, 2453478.882, 2453266.576, 2452093.685 and 54729.600. Each weighted as 0.10The following linear and quadratic ephemerides were determined from all available times of minimum light:JD Hel Min I=2452951.7443Â±0.0008d + 0.402093441Â±0.000000099 X E {1} JD Hel Min I=2452951.7439Â±0.0007d + 0.4020912Â±0.0000007 X E +0.00000000018 Â± 0.00000000006 X E2 {2}A BVRI Bessell filtered simultaneous Wilson-Devinney Program (W-D) solution reveals that the system has a mass ratio of ~0.34 and a component temperature difference of only ~40 K. One low luminosity (Tfact ~ 0.94, ~66 degree radius) large cool region of spots was iterated on the primary component in the WD Synthetic Light Curve computations. It appears in the Southern Hemisphere (colatitude 155 degrees). The Roche Lobe fill-out of the binary is ~17%. The inclination is ~86 degrees. An eclipse duration of ~10 minutes was determined for the primary eclipse and the light curve solution.

Low ruminal pH appears to be the main instigator of the pathophysiology of SARA, although other metabolites produced in the rumen may be involved. Inflammatory responses to SARA are variable but important determinants of a cow's response to SARA. SARA can be diagnosed at the herd level by integrating information about clinical signs and on-farm measures of ruminal pH. Prevention of SARA requires excellent feeding management and proper diet formulation. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Eight rumen-cannulated Holstein cows were assigned to a 2 Ã 2 crossover design with 2 SARA challenge models and 2 experimental runs ( = 8 per treatment). Each run lasted for 40 d, consisting of a 6-d baseline, a 6-d gradual grain adaptation, and a 28-d SARA challenge period. The 2 SARA challenge models were transient (TRA) and persistent (PER) SARA. Initially, all cows were subjected to a forage-only diet (baseline) and gradually switched to 60% concentrate (DM basis). Then, cows in the PER model were continuously challenged for 28 d, whereas cows in the TRA model had a 7-d break from the SARA diet and were fed the forage-only diet after the first 7 d of SARA challenge. Thereafter, the TRA cows were rechallenged with the SARA diet. Wireless ruminal pH sensors were used to obtain ruminal pH profiles and temperature over the experimental period. For the determination of VFA, free ruminal liquid (FRL) and particle-associated ruminal liquid (PARL) were collected once for the baseline and twice (d 20 and 40 for the PER model) or 3 times (d 13, 30, and 40 for the TRA model) during SARA, each time at 0, 4, and 8 h after the"
