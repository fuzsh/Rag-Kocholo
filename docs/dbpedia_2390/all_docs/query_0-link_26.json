West’s sources are undoubtedly excellent. His books are peppered with deliberate clues to potential front-page stories.”\n\nWEST HISTORICAL DICTIONARY OF\n\n—Sunday Times (UK)\n\nNigel West is a military historian specializing in intelligence and security issues, the European editor of the International Journal of Intelligence and Counterintelligence, a lecturer at the Centre for Counterintelligence and Security Studies, and the author of The Third Secret and Mortal Crimes.

Mr. West has been writing about intelligence and security issues for several decades, producing about twenty books on the British, Russian, and other secret services. He has also lectured extensively on the subject, was voted “the expert’s expert” by a panel of spy writers selected by The Observer, and recently received the first Lifetime Literature Achievement Award from the U.S. Association of Former Intelligence Officers.

After all, it is the oldest organized structure of its kind, although there were admittedly countless earlier precedents of states spying on other states (while trying to keep those other states from spying on them) and historically there were also simpler, more rudimentary arrangements within what became the United Kingdom before modern intelligence emerged. It was the British who developed most of the basic aspects, reﬁned most of the essential techniques, and put together the most intricate organization. For the longest time they were the paragons as regards imagination, effectiveness, and cunning, although they are now outpaced by the Americans on technical gadgetry and could never quite match the Soviets in terms of sheer ruthlessness. This does not mean that the British got everything right; they most deﬁnitely did not, and British Intelligence is still a work in progress, having gone through repeated reforms and doubtlessly headed for more further down the road. But, and not every other intelligence organization can say the same, the successes clearly have outnumbered the failures and, what is even more important, Her Majesty’s team repeatedly beat the bad guys and lived to tell the tale (or keep it secret, as they preferred). This volume provides considerable insight into the history and operations of British Intelligence. The entries cover a vast and varied cast of characters, the spies and their handlers, the moles and defectors, the political leaders, the top brass, and many further down. Other entries explain the techniques and jargon. And still others describe the many different ofﬁces and operations, whether MI5, SIS, or GCHQ (which are fortunately also listed with the acronyms for those whose memory is not inﬁnite). The chronology shows how this all evolved over time vii\n\nviii •\n\nEDITOR’S FOREWORD\n\nwhile the introduction puts things in context. The bibliography should not be forgotten, certainly not in this sort of book, because that is where readers can ﬁnd clues to the constantly increasing literature on what is one of the most fascinating of ﬁelds. Admittedly, this Historical Dictionary of British Intelligence cannot be read like a novel, but that does not really matter since there are so many of those around. It does something far more important: it provides rather quick and direct access to the information on which the many books are based and helps readers not only to ﬁgure out what is going on but also to estimate just how far the authors (whether of nonﬁction, ﬁction, or some indeterminate middle ground) can be trusted. This historical dictionary was written by probably the ideal author for the task, Nigel West. Already interested in intelligence and security issues while at university, he soon began writing on the subject, producing about 20 notable works of nonﬁction so far with more doubtlessly to come. Most deal with the British operations, while some focus on Soviet and other varieties. Most cover the periods of World War II and the Cold War, but others go further back. Taken together, there is nothing quite like it and Nigel West is widely regarded as one of the (or perhaps the) foremost authorities on British Intelligence. Indeed, in 1989 he was voted the Experts’ Expert by a panel of spy writers selected by the Observer. In 2003 he was awarded the U.S. Association of Former Intelligence Ofﬁcers’ ﬁrst Lifetime Literature Achievement Award. Aside from that, Nigel West has lectured widely and been a member of the House of Commons. As stated, probably the ideal person for the job.

The French have always complained about perﬁdious Albion, the Germans acknowledge having being outmaneuvered in two world wars by Britain’s professional intelligencers, and in 1942, as the transatlantic intelligence relationship was in its infancy, beguiled Americans were the neophytes invited into the brothel to learn the secrets of clandestine operations. Despite the change in role, from a global power controlling an empire that covered much of the world to a mere partner in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the European Union, the country’s famed security and intelligence apparatus continues largely intact and is recognized as ‘‘punching above its weight.’’ Feared by the Soviets, admired and trusted by the CIA, British Intelligence has provided the hidden dimension to the conduct of domestic and foreign policy, with the added mystique of Whitehall secrecy, a shroud that for years protected the identities of the shadowy ﬁgures who recruited the sources, broke the codes, and caught the spies. Any glance at history, from the plots mounted against Queen Elizabeth I to the military expeditions to the Sudan, from the Crimean War to the guerrilla campaign waged by the Boers in South Africa, from the trenches of Flanders to the Battle of El Alamein, and perhaps most starkly during the Cold War, reveals the essential role of intelligence, often covert activities channeled through a myriad of agencies, branches, bureaus, and covers. Even when the contribution made by the secret world is hard to discern or has been concealed behind years of ofﬁcial obfuscation and ‘‘plausible denial,’’ there remains the suspicion that there was a sub rosa component to all major Cabinet decisions, every military deployment, and most political triumphs. In recent years, xxi\n\nxxii •\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\ngreater transparency, the declassiﬁcation of ofﬁcial papers, and the relaxation of the rules of total conﬁdentiality have allowed the public to learn more about the inﬂuence of the men known by the initials ‘‘C,’’ ‘‘K,’’ and ‘‘M.’’ Far from turning out to have been faceless, colorless bureaucrats, some of these characters prove to have been larger than life, with the ﬁrst ‘‘C’’ being a one-legged admiral whose naval career had been curtailed by seasickness, ‘‘K’’ an asthmatic infantry ofﬁcer who had been the Daily Telegraph’s war correspondent during the Boxer Rebellion, and ‘‘M,’’ hardly 007’s ruthless chief, later the presenter of a children’s nature program on the BBC. Certainly stranger than any ﬁction, the true stories of these remarkable spymasters have yet to be disclosed in any detail. Nevertheless, their impact on events, albeit behind the scenes, is hard to exaggerate. For example, most historians agree that World War II was shortened by at least two years through the skilful exploitation of the signals intelligence derived from the Anglo-American cryptographic operation conducted at Bletchley Park, which successfully solved many of the Axis machine ciphers, including those generated on the Enigma. In addition, the cryptanalysts broke dozens of other codes and read the German Foreign Ministry’s trafﬁc and that of Japanese military attache´s across the world. The scale of the effort, amounting to 25,000 codebreakers, linguists, and intercept operators, was matched only by what they accomplished in the military and diplomatic ﬁelds. Interception of Axis future plans, current dispositions, fuel and ammunition stocks, availability of reserves, and even the complete enemy order of battle was but one part of the total picture that encompassed wholesale deception by the manipulation of controlled double agents, as well as the dissemination of false rumors, bogus wireless signals, and fake newspaper reports and the preparation of imaginary armies to mislead the enemy’s aerial reconnaissance. The intelligence techniques developed by the British helped save tens of thousands of lives, persuaded the enemy units launching rockets that their weapons were overshooting London, convinced Hitler that the D-Day landings would take place in the Pas-de-Calais, and bottled up several German divisions in Norway until the end of hostilities, where they surrendered with scarcely a shot being ﬁred. Intelligence and deception played key roles in winning the Battle of the Atlantic against the U-boats, pushing the Afrika Korps from the Libyan Desert, and destroying Nazi panzers at Kursk in the biggest tank battle of all time.\n\nINTRODUCTION •\n\nxxiii\n\nDuring the postwar era, and particularly in the Cold War, espionage and counterintelligence became the chosen weapons of the Great Powers in a largely unseen struggle that was fought away from the headlines. Indeed, secret wars were conducted in Southeast Asia, the Middle East, Africa, and South America, sometimes for years, before details of the conﬂicts made the newspapers. And even after some sketchy disclosures had been made, it would sometimes be decades before authoritative information reached the public about the ﬁerce counterinsurgency battles that had raged in such distant lands as Borneo, Belize, and Oman. Similarly, in the war against terrorism, it may be a long time before the full details are learned of how the Provisional IRA was penetrated or the Irish National Liberation Army was coaxed into self-destruction. But although the results of clandestine operations may manifest themselves only in cease-ﬁres, amnesties, and commitments to peace, the cognoscenti know all too well that such events are most likely achieved after a heavy investment in covert activities. Of course, not everything is quite what it seems in the conﬂict between spies and counterspies, and any assessment of British Intelligence has to take account of the disasters, failures, security lapses, and examples of hostile penetration. Some of the most celebrated names associated with British Intelligence are notorious traitors, such as the infamous ‘‘Cambridge Five,’’ Guy Burgess, Donald Maclean, Kim Philby, Anthony Blunt, and John Cairncross. Together they hemorrhaged classiﬁed documents from most of Britain’s secret departments before, during, and after World War II. They compromised British personnel, identiﬁed agents operating overseas, and wrecked innumerable schemes, including those to inﬁltrate partisans into postwar Albania and the Baltic states. These Cold War stratagems were effectively neutralized by the intervention of Philby and his network, which exercised an inﬂuence at the very highest level of British Intelligence. But while the KGB’s recruits, such as George Blake, Leo Long, and Michael Bettaney, sought to wreak havoc from their trusted positions within British Intelligence, what about the less well-known ﬁgures, such as the two Special Branch detectives who sold out to Moscow, or the Communist secretary who obtained a job in the heart of MI5’s innermost sanctum, the Security Service Registry? Few such names appear in the many books written about British Intelligence, but they are, nonetheless, vital participants in what Rudyard Kipling called ‘‘the great game.’’\n\nxxiv •\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe history of British Intelligence can be traced back at least 400 years, although it has been institutionalized only in relatively recent times. There is, nevertheless, a distinct strand that can be followed from the days of Sir Francis Walsingham, stopping those who sought to usurp the Crown, to the modern experts in ‘‘transnational threat,’’ who mount complex electronic surveillance operations to eliminate 21st-century terrorists and cybercriminals. Originally the conspirators hoped to seize the country and place a coreligionist on the throne, whereas in today’s era of global terrorism the atrocities are committed by religious fanatics who are opposed to Western society, its culture, and its values. British Intelligence is a generic term to cover all the many ofﬁcial agencies which have collected, collated, and distributed information for Whitehall. Although the modern organizations of the Security Service (MI5) and the Secret Intelligence Service (SIS) date back only to August 1909, the ﬁrst director of military intelligence (DMI), General Sir Henry Brackenbury, was appointed in June 1887. Looking farther back, there are records of payments for ‘‘secret service’’ dating to the Economic Reform Act of 1782, and it is known that Henry VIII took a close interest in the reports of his agents. Although MI5 and SIS (occasionally known by its cover military intelligence designation of MI6) are probably the best-known of Britain’s many intelligence agencies, with a history dating back to their formation together in 1909 as the Secret Service Bureau, neither is as large as Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), the codebreaking agency that developed from the Government Code and Cipher School (GC&CS), itself a direct descendent of the celebrated Admiralty cryptographers of Room 40 who were absorbed into GC&CS in 1919. Whereas MI5 was charged with defending the interests of the Empire and continues to post representatives abroad, Britain’s main overseas intelligence-gathering was, and is, conducted by SIS. In parallel, GCHQ collects signals trafﬁc across the globe from a network of intercept stations and circulates its product to Whitehall. Information from MI5, SIS, and GCHQ is distilled by the Assessment Staff of the Joint Intelligence Committee (JIC), which also relies on reports and imagery from a fourth agency, the Defence Intelligence Staff (DIS), which is dependent upon attache´s posted to foreign capitals, open sources, and technical intelligence gleaned from satellite surveillance and overhead reconnaissance platforms. Together, these four agencies supply the\n\nINTRODUCTION •\n\nxxv\n\nJIC’s independent analysts with the raw material that they skillfully craft into their weekly assessments. The Joint Intelligence Committee, at the apex of the intelligence pyramid, consists of the directors of the four intelligence-producing agencies, the consumers (being the senior civil servants from the Home Ofﬁce, Treasury, and Foreign Ofﬁce), the chief of the Defence Staff and the intelligence coordinator to the Cabinet. Chaired by a senior diplomat, the JIC manages it own independent Assessment Staff, subdivided into Current Intelligence Groups (CIGs) and organized on either a regional or topical basis, assembles the relevant data, and drafts reports for consideration at the weekly JIC meeting. Latin America, Africa, and the Far East have their own geographic CIGs, and additional groups will be formed to deal with particular events, such as a crisis in Kosovo, Afghanistan, or Iraq. Created in 1936, the JIC provides a focus that scrutinizes all the pieces of the intelligence jigsaw and sets objectives for the agencies. In the military intelligence (MI) establishment, the various MI departments have corresponded to their Military Operations (MO) equivalents, with the exception of MI5 and MI6 (MO5 is assigned to future plans). Thus, MI1 is the department of the director of military intelligence, and MI2 deals with Europe, MI3 with Germany, MI4 the Middle East. MI8 is the designation of the Radio Security Service (RSS), MI9 the escape and evasion branch of SIS, and MI19 the Combined Services Detailed Interrogation Centre (CSDIC). Within these branches are alphabetic subsections; for example, one of the little more obscure military intelligence units, MI4(b), was responsible before World War II for the preparation and printing of maps across the Middle East from Turkey to Aden. In the modern world, the military intelligence establishment coexists with the civilian agencies of MI5 and SIS, and until the reorganization of the Ministry of Defence in 1964, when the Defence Intelligence Staff was created by the amalgamation of the Naval Intelligence Division and the Air Ministry’s air intelligence staff, was dominated by the Joint Intelligence Bureau, the intelligence branch of the War Ofﬁce. Since the amalgamation, the DIS has been responsible for all armed services intelligence, and it manages its own analytical staff, which ﬁlters its product to the JIC. In the world of intelligence, the British version has always been\n\nxxvi •\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nunique, in terms of both the remarkable personalities drawn into it and the part it has played, and continues to perform, in British life, from the controversy surrounding the Zinoviev Letter to the more recent suicide of Dr. David Kelly, the Defence Intelligence analyst. Alphabetically, the list of historic events founded in intelligence runs from the Abdication Crisis to the Zulu Wars, and all can be found in the pages that follow. Inevitably, because of the traditional reliance on intelligence, and the pervasive nature of British secrecy, there is almost always another dimension to major historical episodes, even if only hints of the truth emerge 30 years later when ofﬁcial papers are released under the terms of the Public Records Act. Very often it takes many more decades for the full story to emerge and for the hidden hand of one of the secret agencies to be revealed. However, when the details are disclosed—for example, by the acknowledgment in 1974 that the Allied cryptographers of World War II read much of the most vital Axis strategic communications and thereby shortened the war by an estimated two years—the public’s perception of history can be altered radically. Certainly Generals Dwight D. Eisenhower and Bernard Montgomery were impressive tacticians, but in neither of their autobiographies did they refer to the stunning advantage they enjoyed over their adversaries, namely, the ability to know their entire order of battle, future intentions, current plans, and the status of their armored and Luftwaffe support. Thus the source codenamed ultra proved to be a trump card, and in the decades that followed, other cryptanalytical successes, including venona and the comprehensive eavesdropping on Warsaw Pact forces in Eastern Europe, enabled NATO to preserve a balance of deterrence with vastly inferior numbers. While venona allowed the counterintelligence authorities to identify Klaus Fuchs and Donald Maclean as long-term Soviet moles, the monitoring of Soviet wireless and cable trafﬁc gave the West a reliable trip wire that acted as an early-warning system to prevent the possibility of a surprise attack. MI5 and SIS achieved worldwide reputations, partly because of writers such as Ian Fleming, Somerset Maugham, Len Deighton, and John le Carre´, but also because of a series of embarrassing espionage cases, not the least of which was the scandal of the Cambridge Five, which cast a shadow over the supposed efﬁciency of the Security Service for decades. Thus Britain’s best-known security and intelligence agencies,\n\nINTRODUCTION •\n\nxxvii\n\nwhile seeking to retain an element of secrecy about their personnel and operations, were to be handicapped by the fact that many of their ofﬁcers were writers and self-publicists, and some others turned out to be traitors working for the Soviets. Although MI5, SIS, and GCHQ were to play pivotal roles in Britain’s Cold War history, the heads of those organizations went largely unknown and unrecognized and completed their careers in anonymous obscurity, protected by D Notices to discourage newspaper revelations and a convention of almost Trappist silence adopted by the staff. This was all the more remarkable considering the extraordinary personalities that were drawn into the intelligence world. Politicians, authors, musicians, playwrights, and scoundrels have participated in what to some might seem like a long, continuing drama, not unlike a family saga; many of those involved knew each other well, in many cases being related, having served together in the forces, or having attended the same universities and schools. From literature came Graham Greene, John le Carre´, Somerset Maugham, Compton Mackenzie, and dozens of others. The historians included Bob Carew-Hunt, Hugh Trevor Roper, and Roger Fulford. From the armed forces came many hundreds decorated for valor; the universities provided some of the country’s greatest intellects, their powers applied to cryptography; and politics gave cabinet ministers such as Sam Hoare, Richard Crossman, David Ennals, and Roy Jenkins. The Parliamentary benches were to seat John Buchan, Dick Brooman-White, Niall Macdermot, Stephen Hastings, Julian Amery, Tom Normanton, Henry Hunloke, Airey Neave, Hugh Gaitskell, George Cockerill, Billy McLean, Peter Smithers, Douglas Dodds-Parker, Sir Reginald Hall, Admiral Morgan Morgan-Giles, Walter Fletcher, Aubrey Jones, Bill Allen, Sir Frank Nelson, Henry Kerby, Rod Richards, Kenneth Younger, and Paddy Ashdown. The House of Lords produced the hereditary peers Tennyson, Ashley, Harcourt, Selborne, Sandhurst, Glenconner, Cottenham, Asquith, Rea, and Rothschild, who were joined by the life peers Meta Ramsay, Rex Fletcher, Kenneth Keith, Gladwyn Jebb, Daphne Park, Henry Hopkinson, John Cuckney, Bernard Ballantrae, and Cranley Onslow. The law provided Old Bailey judges, such as Sir Helenus Milmo, Sir Edward Cussen, Sir Blanshard Stamp, and John Maude; an Appeal Court judge, Sir John Stephenson; and a host of barristers and solicitors\n\nxxviii •\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nrecruited for wartime duties. Diplomacy offered Sir Peter Ramsbotham, Sir Peter Hope, Sir Brooks Richards and his son Sir Francis, Sir Robin Hooper, Sir Peter Wilkinson, Dame Barbara Salt, Baroness Ramsay, and Sir Alan Urwick. Among the bankers were Sir Robin Brook, Sir Charles Hambro, Sir William Wiseman, Harry Sporborg, and Louis Franck. Hollywood lent David Niven, Christopher Lee, and Sir Anthony Quayle, and the theatre gave Noel Coward and Paul Dehn. The world of intelligence drew in the queen’s dressmaker Hardy Amies and the king’s gamekeepers from Sandringham. Even Britain’s traitors were exotic, among them Sir Roger Casement, Sir Anthony Blunt, Guy Burgess, Kim Philby, Leo Long, and John Cairncross. The list from Fleet Street is an equally breathtaking cast: Malcolm Muggeridge, Derek Verschoyle, Alan Hare, Wilfred Hindle, Stephen Watts, Derek Tangye, Sir Geoffrey Cox, and dozens of others, not to mention the role played by Reuter’s, the international news agency actually bought and run with a secret government subsidy. The Secret Intelligence Service and Special Operations Executive were interested in explorers of the caliber of Andrew Croft; travel writers, including Archie Lyall, Xan Fielding, and Sir Paddy Leigh-Fermor; and experienced foreign correspondents such as Frederick Voight and Tom Sefton Delmer. The paradox is that few of the historians or journalists, who made their living from writing, ever revealed the true nature of their clandestine occupations. Accordingly, much of what is in the public domain concerning British Intelligence comes either from works of ﬁction or from the pens of Kim Philby, George Blake, and John Cairncross, all self-confessed traitors, hostile to the Crown and determined to undermine its secret institutions. Even Henry Landau and Leslie Nicholson, both disappointed SIS professionals who released their memoirs from a legal refuge from the Ofﬁcial Secrets Act in the United States, could not be described as fair or unbiased commentators on British Intelligence; talented though they were, their decisions to write about their experiences, in deﬁance of a ban almost universally respected by their colleagues, were prompted by an ulterior motive of striking back at an organization they believed had slighted them. The picture that emerges, therefore, from such tainted sources, is far from balanced, and the equilibrium can only be restored by taking a broader look at all the various facets of the British intelligence community.\n\nINTRODUCTION •\n\nxxix\n\nThe varying talents of philosophers, artists, and reporters were drawn to British Intelligence in a way unmatched by any other country, and the result is a rich tapestry of skill, innovation, and improvisation accommodated by an equally diverse set of organizations ranging from the Admiralty’s Room 40 cryptanalysts of World War I to modern agent-handlers of the Security Service seeking to penetrate terrorist groups. In between, MI5, SIS, and GCHQ, the country’s three main intelligence agencies, have been able to rely on active assistance and support from their counterparts in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Hong Kong, India, Malaya, the Persian Gulf, a score of former colonies in Africa, and a dozen dependent territories. In addition, they have developed strong, formal ties with their American allies, to the point that the CIA station chief in London sits on the JIC as an ex ofﬁcio member and GCHQ is fully integrated into the worldwide matrix of National Security Agency listening posts. Indeed, the need in recent years to combine against the common foe of terrorism has brought closer cooperation with even the Spanish, French, and Russian intelligence and security services and has seen the creation of dedicated intelligence exchanges, in Brussels and Bern, where information from delicate sources can be swapped in conditions of secrecy. Historically, the scale of British Intelligence has been extraordinary, ranging from clandestine bodies devoted to propaganda through to the more familiar covert bodies of today. In 1931 Sir Eric Holt-Wilson addressed a conference called to consider empire security and boasted that MI5’s staff of 600 ofﬁcers, ofﬁcials, and technical experts could call upon 7,000 detectives and more than 100,000 police, ‘‘all of whom were working in instant response to guidance from the headquarters of the Security Service.’’ In September 1940, when offering his services to the U.S. Embassy as a security adviser following his dismissal by the prime minister, Holt-Wilson explained that at the time of his retirement he could call upon ‘‘some 250 chiefs of Police at home and 50 more in British Territories overseas.’’ Many of Holt-Wilson’s subordinates had served what had amounted to an apprenticeship abroad, learning their craft with the Indian Political Intelligence bureau in Delhi, or with the Special Branch in Shanghai, and the scale of what they achieved is hard to underestimate. Certainly for decades a mere handful of expatriate intelligence experts kept the government of India well informed on the threat from Communist sedition, and the Combined Intelligence Centre\n\nxxx •\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nIraq, traditionally managed by Royal Air Force personnel, maintained order in prewar Baghdad on a level that has gone unsurpassed since. Over the years, the various components of British Intelligence became a veritable alphabet soup, including the OIC, SIME, BSC, ISLD, PWE, MEIC, SOE, CIFE, STS, JIC, SWG, CSO, and FRU. Together they covered the globe, supporting British rule over a quarter of it, from running intercept stations in the Northern Territory of Australia to the administration of Special Branch in Hong Kong, from MI5’s counterespionage operations in London to countersubversion activities in prewar Bombay. British Intelligence manned outposts in Cyprus, Masira, Singapore, and St. Helena and continues to send declared representatives to Washington, D.C., and Moscow, with others in undercover roles in Belgrade, Buenos Aires, and Basra. Over the years, these differing groups have had a measurable impact on British public life and politics, and a brief overview of Margaret Thatcher’s premiership illustrates the point, with her administration dogged by one intelligence or security incident after another seizing the newspaper headlines. She had scarcely been elected in 1979 before the former keeper of the queen’s pictures, Professor Sir Anthony Blunt, was exposed as Soviet mole who had penetrated MI5 and was stripped of his knighthood. There followed the intelligence failures that led to the invasion of the Falklands, the Zircon satellite affair, the arrests of Geoffrey Prime and Michael Bettaney, Matrix Churchill, the suspicions over Roger Hollis, several telephone tapping scandals, the banning of trade unions at GCHQ, the Cyprus signals base arrests, the SpyCatcher saga, and as a ﬁnale and backdrop to her departure from Downing Street, the unanticipated invasion and occupation of Kuwait by Saddam Hussein. The common thread running through all these events is the involvement of the security and intelligence agencies, demonstrating not only their capacity to cause ministerial embarrassment but also the consistency with which they can be relied upon to create problems for all governments. The difﬁculties that beset Mrs. Thatcher were far from unique. Anthony Eden was infuriated when Buster Crabb disappeared on a clandestine mission in 1956, and Harold Wilson came close to paranoia in his suspicions over plots he was convinced had been orchestrated by members of the Security Service. Harold Macmillan’s loss of power was in part due to the Profumo affair, and Ted Heath was infuriated to\n\nINTRODUCTION •\n\nxxxi\n\nlearn that his army minister had been visiting call girls at a ﬂat used by an MI5 surveillance operation, leading to the resignation of Lord Lambton and another minister, Lord Jellicoe. John Major’s government survived a Commons division on the Matrix Churchill ﬁasco by just one vote. Similarly, Tony Blair’s government failed to ﬁnd the weapons of mass destruction so conﬁdently described and predicted by the Joint Intelligence Committee, which then had its performance scrutinized by an independent inquiry conducted by Lord Hutton in January 2004. Although the government escaped censure, the JIC did not need to be reminded of the dangers of being sucked into the policy process or participating in what amounted to political pamphleteering and was obliged to endure further scrutiny from a panel of privy councilors headed by the former cabinet secretary Lord Butler. In the ﬁnal accounting, whatever the result of any proﬁt-and-loss calculation that assesses the contribution made by British Intelligence to the country’s history, there can be little doubt that the part played by the various organizations has had a major inﬂuence on events, strategy, and the public’s perception of each.\n\nThe Dictionary\n\n–A– A BRANCH. The MI5 department responsible for administration and support after the postwar reorganization. Subdivided into A1, A2, A3, etc. A DIVISION. The MI5 department responsible for administration prior to the postwar reorganization of the Security Service, subdivided into A1, External Services; A4, Internal Services; A5, Special Sections (dealing with telephone intercepts); A6, Scientiﬁc and General Post Ofﬁce liaison; and A7, Cipher Section. ‘‘A’’ FORCE. Cover name for the World War II deception unit in the Middle East headed by Colonel Dudley Clarke and accommodated in a ﬂat above a Cairo brothel. The ofﬁcially approved war establishment for ‘‘A’’ Force was three ofﬁcers, an Auxiliary Service personal assistant, 10 other ranks, one car, and four trucks. The unit became the acknowledged experts in building dummy tanks and gliders, camouﬂaging tanks as trucks, generating bogus engine noise, and simulating fake tracks and erasing authentic ones. ABBASSIA. The secret intercept site outside Cairo during World War II responsible for linking the Combined Bureau Middle East at Heliopolis to Bletchley Park via Whaddon Hall. Known as ‘‘the Cottage.’’ Abbassia interception duties were shared with another War Ofﬁce Y Group station at Sidhi Bishra, near Alexandria, Egypt. ABDEL. Code name for a nominal agent in World War II, supposedly a businessmen in Damascus supplying political information to pessimist y. 1\n\n2 •\n\nABDICATION CRISIS\n\nABDICATION CRISIS. During the history of MI5, very few constitutional crises have occurred during which the director-general of the Security Service has expressed concern about whether he should accept instructions from the prime minister. Sir Vernon Kell had not harbored any reservations when asked to investigate the background to the Cato Street Conspiracy and the corrupt behavior of Maundy, but in the period leading up to the abdication of King Edward VIII in December 1936, he consulted widely to be satisﬁed that Stanley Baldwin had demanded that MI5 tap the telephone of the king’s mistress, Wallis Simpson, and to place her and her social contacts under surveillance. MI5 and Special Branch ultimately reported that she was simultaneously conducting an affair with a Group Captain Trundle but was not engaged in espionage. ABDOOLCADER, SIRIOJ HUSEIN. A junior civil servant working in the Motor Licensing Department of the Greater London Council, 30-year-old Sirioj Husein Abdoolcader was the son of one of Malaysia’s most distinguished advocates, Sir Husein Abdoolcader. He had come to England in 1957 to read for the bar at Lincoln’s Inn, but opted to stay after he failed his law exams. As a clerk, Abdoolcader had access to the registration details of specially ﬂagged MI5 surveillance vehicles, and he was recruited by Vladislav Savin of the KGB’s London rezidentura in March 1967. He was betrayed by a KGB defector, Oleg Lyalin, and was arrested in September 1971 at his ofﬁce in County Hall. When searched, Abdoolcader was found to be carrying a list of MI5 car index numbers on a postcard addressed to Lyalin. He pleaded guilty in 1972 to breaches of the Ofﬁcial Secrets Act and was sentenced to three years’ imprisonment. ABEAM. Code name for a deception scheme undertaken in the Middle East over six months in 1941, intended to promote the idea that there were airborne troops based in Egypt planning to launch an attack behind the lines in Italy. Devised by Colonel Dudley Clarke, the plan was to exploit Italian fears, known from intercepted enemy wireless trafﬁc, of just such a surprise. In support of it, Clarke invented a nonexistent First Special Air Service Brigade and used ingenious methods to persuade the enemy it was training in parachute and glider techniques in the Transjordan desert. Captured enemy documents suggest that abeam succeeded.\n\nADMINISTRATION DIRECTORATE •\n\n3\n\nABWEHR. The principal German intelligence agency, and therefore the main adversary of British Intelligence during World War II. Headed by Admiral Wilhelm Canaris until his dismissal in 1944, the Abwehr (meaning ‘‘defense’’ in German) was not centrally organized, although the main headquarters was in Berlin’s elegant Tirpitzufer. Individual abstellen, or regional ofﬁces, were located within Germany’s military districts; the Hamburg abstelle was responsible for collecting intelligence against Great Britain. Information about the Abwehr’s structure, staff, and operations came from the interrogation of captured spies, who were questioned at MI5’s detention center, Camp 020; from the interception of the organization’s communications, known as isk and isos; and from defectors, among them Otto John and Erich Vermehren. ADAM STREET. Located just off the Strand, Adam Street accommodated one of the Secret Intelligence Service’s front addresses between 1919 and 1925. The location was compromised by surveillance mounted on the building by detectives working for William Ewer’s spy ring. AD/B. Special Operations Executive (SOE) symbol for the head of the SOE mission in Gibraltar during World War II. ADMINISTRATION DIRECTORATE. The Administration Directorate of the Secret Intelligence Service (SIS) was created in 1945 as part of the postwar reorganization and was initially headed by Captain Frank Slocum (designated DO/Admin). He was responsible for SIS’s administration policies, supervised the administrative machinery, and chaired the Selection Committee and the Permanent Committee for Registry and Archives. He also managed organizational development, oversaw administrative inspection of overseas stations, and ran the W Department, which handled the production of forged papers. His personal assistant was Miss M. Porter Hargreaves. The Administration Directorate was later to be placed under Mr. Musson, one of the joint directors for ﬁnance and administration. Slocum’s deputy (designated ‘‘A’’) was Commander B. A. P. Davis, responsible for management training and secret seaborne operations. The directorate included the following departments:\n\n4 •\n\nADMINISTRATION DIRECTORATE\n\n• A1 (Captain H. P. Taylor) was responsible for the training of SIS’s operational personnel and for liaison with universities, the Ministry of Labour, and other organizations that supplied candidates for recruitment, such as the Civil Service Selection Board. A1’s duties included the preparation of personnel dossiers, vetting, medical examination of new recruits, and running language proﬁciency exams. • A2 (Major G. D. Hiles) was responsible for ofﬁcers’ entitlements; sickness and family emergency leave; retirements and dismissals; issuing references and service records; pensions and emoluments; organizing training courses; organizing medical, dental, and optical services; and accommodating staff in London when necessary. • A3 (Major L. D. J. Wallerstein) was responsible for ofﬁcers’ postings, ﬁlling vacant positions, questions of salary, documentation of ofﬁcers’ marriages, payment of travel expenses, naturalization, and the granting of ex gratia payments and rewards. • A4 (Commander Pearse) was responsible for expense advances; messing allowances and expenses; living allowances; funds for equipment and clothing, including clothing coupons; compensation for loss of effects; and drawing up the Administration Directorate’s annual budget. • A5 (Captain F. A. Quinn) was responsible for support staff (porters, guards, messengers, lift attendants, etc.), including their recruitment, training, and enrollment; ﬁnancial aid; transfers; regular and early retirements; processing of marriages; and payment of pensions and gratuities. The problems of the passport control ofﬁcer staff, such as passports and statistical monitoring, were handled by Miss Middleton. Other matters handled by A5 included drawing up the organizational structure, ﬁnancial issues, salary scales, headcounts, control of identiﬁcation cards, maintenance of ﬁles on station and section personnel, compilation of regular staff lists, and running the daily staff movements register. • A6 (Colonel F. W. Niall) was responsible for the development of postwar conditions of service, the preparation of background papers to be used for advice on recruitment, and maintenance of the staff lists by rank, as well as acting as secretary of the A Advisory Selection Board (which dealt with senior appointments) and sitting as a member of the C Advisory Selection Board. A6 also handled a number of Head Ofﬁce staff administrative functions and liaison with the controllers for advice on Germany and Austria.\n\nAERIAL INTELLIGENCE •\n\n5\n\nADMIRAL GRAF SPEE. A German pocket battleship that sought refuge from the Royal Navy’s ‘‘A’’ Force in the harbor at Montevideo, Uruguay, early in World War II. In what was to be one of the ﬁrst major deception operations of World War II, the Kriegsmarine had been persuaded by the transmission of bogus wireless signals that a much larger group of British ships was lying in wait for the Atlantic raider to venture out of Uruguay’s neutral waters. The operation had been masterminded by the local Secret Intelligence Service head of station, Rex Millar, who also arranged for the British naval attache´, Captain Henry McCall, to make an ostensibly indiscreet telephone call to Buenos Aires over a line known to be tapped by the enemy. Convinced that the Graf Spee stood no chance and was heavily outgunned, Captain Hans Langsdorff blew up his own ship in December 1939 on a direct order from Hitler and later committed suicide. ADYE, SIR JOHN. Director of GCHQ from 1989 to 1996. Adye joined the organization from Lincoln College, Oxford, in 1962. In 1972 he was posted to Washington, D.C., as the special United Kingdom liaison ofﬁcer for two years. AERIAL INTELLIGENCE. A key component of the British Intelligence matrix, aerial observation originated in the ability to ‘‘see over the other side of the hill’’ and to direct artillery using tethered, manned hydrogen balloons and later developed into airborne reconnaissance using biplanes equipped with wireless during World War I. Prior to World War II, Sidney Cotton was employed by the Secret Intelligence Service to ﬂy photoreconnaissance ﬂights along the Maginot Line for the French, and both Fred Winterbotham and Cyril Mills undertook clandestine missions over German territory. In the postwar era, the Royal Aircraft Establishment participated in an Anglo-American program of overﬂight or ‘‘ferret’’ penetrations of Soviet airspace, intended to test radar defenses, provoke ﬁghter interceptions, and induce signal trafﬁc for collection and analysis. In addition to utilizing aircraft in the conventional Royal Air Force for these assignments, collection of air samples—to detect the frequency and composition of atmospheric nuclear tests—was conducted by aircraft of the nationalized airline converted to carry special air ﬁlters. In 1982 for the Falklands conﬂict, aerial intelligence collection in\n\n6 •\n\nAGABEKOV, GEORGES\n\nSouth America was enhanced by the deployment of three Canberra PR-9s from 18 Group, No. 1 Photographic Reconnaissance Unit from RAF Wyton, and two signals intelligence–modiﬁed Hercules to Punta Arenas, Chile, in Chilean Air Force livery (but NATO standard camouﬂage). AGABEKOV, GEORGES. An OGPU ofﬁcer based in Turkey, Georges Agabekov fell in love with his English teacher, Isabel Streater, and defected to Paris in 1930, where the following year he published his memoirs, OGPU: The Russian Secret Terror. His true name was Arutyanov but he adopted the new identity when he was assigned to Constantinople as the illegal rezident, a task he had fulﬁlled previously in Tehran. After they were married, the couple settled in Brussels, but in July 1937 he was lured to the Franco-Spanish frontier in a scheme involving smuggled artworks looted during the Spanish Civil War. He was never seen again and it is presumed that he was assassinated by the NKVD. His wife returned to England and died in New York in November 1971 while working for the British Mission to the United Nations. AGAR, AUGUSTUS. In the early summer of 1918, Lieutenant Augustus Agar was given command of a ﬂotilla of fast 40-foot coastal motor boats (CMBs) and sent to the remote island of Osea in Essex. He assumed that his role would be one of coastal protection until he was invited to London to meet Admiral Mansﬁeld Smith-Cumming, who asked him to take two of his high-speed craft to Finland. Their purpose was to ferry British agents across the Baltic, and in particular give a means of escape to ‘‘ST 25,’’ the Secret Intelligence Service’s star agent in Russia, Paul Dukes. Agar’s clandestine missions proved so successful that the admiral requested him to mount a surprise night raid on Krondstadt, across the Gulf of Finland, where the menacing Soviet ﬂeet was anchored. Operating from an abandoned yacht club at Terrioki, Agar’s CMBs sped over the water at speeds of up to 40 knots and launched their torpedoes against the Russian cruiser Oleg, which sank soon afterward, a feat for which Agar was decorated with the Victoria Cross and the Distinguished Service Order. Agar remained in the Royal Navy until his retirement in 1943,\n\nAGENT OF INFLUENCE •\n\n7\n\nwhen he was appointed commodore of the Royal Naval College at Greenwich. He stood for the Greenwich constituency in the 1945 general election but lost. For the remainder of his life, until his death in December 1968, he grew strawberries on his estate at Alton in Hampshire. Agar’s ﬁrst volume of memoirs, Footprints in the Sea, was published in 1959, followed by Showing the Flag in 1962 and Baltic Episode: A Classic of Secret Service in Russian Waters in 1963. AGEE, PHILIP. A career Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) ofﬁcer and a graduate of Notre Dame University, Agee spent 12 years with the CIA’s Latin America Division, serving in the Directorate of Operations in Ecuador, Uruguay, and Mexico. In 1967 he was posted to Mexico City, where his marriage broke down. He resigned two years later and became a source for the KGB and Cuban Intelligence. In 1971 he left the United States for London to write a controversial expose´, Inside the Company: CIA Diary, which revealed the identities of more than 2,000 CIA ofﬁcers and their agents, thus virtually paralyzing the CIA’s operations in the region. He also contributed to a radical magazine, Counter-Spy, which named Richard Welch as the CIA’s chief of station in Athens. Soon afterward, Welch was shot dead outside his home by Greek terrorists. Undeterred, Agee continued to campaign against the CIA and wrote Dirty Work: The CIA in Western Europe and Dirty Work 2: The CIA in Africa. Agee’s unwelcome activities in London resulted in his deportation in June 1977 after lengthy legal hearings, and thereafter he was expelled from France, the Netherlands, and Germany. Agee’s U.S. passport was withdrawn in 1979, but he was allowed to return to the United States in 1987, using a Nicaraguan passport, to promote his book On the Run and was never prosecuted. He now runs a successful, Web-based travel information company promoting tourism in Cuba. AGENT OF INFLUENCE. Whereas a spy requires access to classiﬁed information or undertakes clandestine assignments for an espionage network, agents of inﬂuence concentrate on peddling propaganda without overtly declaring their commitment to a cause. Accordingly, the activities of an agent of inﬂuence do not usually constitute a criminal offense.\n\n8 •\n\nAGENT PROVOCATEUR\n\nAGENT PROVOCATEUR. The widely used French term for a penetration agent deployed to collect information, often with a view to prosecution. Because of their dubious legal status, MI5 traditionally has been reluctant to employ agents provocateurs. In 1940 Harald Kurtz was compromised when he was deployed against Benjamin Greene in an attempt to obtain incriminating evidence of his supposed Fifth Column activities, and in 1943 it proved impossible to prosecute a self-confessed German spy, Ernesto Simoes, after an attempt had been made to entrap him. Strict, classiﬁed guidelines are issued to all case ofﬁcers setting the conditions under which agents may be allowed to encourage, but not incite, an illegal act. AIR BUBBLE. Code name for an MI5 investigation initiated in January 1964 into Dr. Jean-Paul Soupert, a French industrial chemist run by the Belgian Surete´ as a double agent against the East Germans. Soupert had received proprietorial information from two Kodak employees, Alfred Roberts and Geoffrey Conway, and although no classiﬁed material was compromised, the two Communist Party of Great Britain members were prosecuted for offenses under the Prevention of Corruption Act. They were acquitted, following some trenchant remarks from the judge about Soupert’s reliability as a witness. AIR INTELLIGENCE (AI). The intelligence branch of the Air Ministry, directed during World War II by Air Commodore Archie Boyle and then Charles Medhurst. Its sections reﬂected the conventional military intelligence designations. AI was subdivided into various branches: AI1(e) to deal with signals intelligence collection; AI1(f) with the examination of crashed aircraft; AI1(k) with the interrogation of captured Luftwaffe aircrew at Trent Park, Cockfosters; AI3 with enemy order of battle; and AI3(b) with the analysis of signals intelligence. AKHMEDOV, ISMAIL G. A career GRU ofﬁcer, Ismail Akhmedov defected in May 1942 in Ankara, Turkey, where he was operating under press attache´ cover as ‘‘Lieutenant Colonel Grigori Nikoyev’’ at the Soviet consulate. Although he initially approached the British, Akhmedov opted for the protection of the Turkish Security Inspectorate and remained in Turkey until 1948. There he was debriefed by\n\nALBANIA •\n\n9\n\nthe local Secret Intelligence Service station commander, Kim Philby, who discounted his value and reported everything he said to his Soviet contacts. Akhmedov subsequently went to Europe, and ﬁnally to the United States, where he still lives, having written his memoirs, In and Out of Stalin’s GRU, in 1984. In 1953 he gave evidence, using the name Ismail Enge, to the U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary. ALBANIA. The Albanian subsection of Special Operations Executive (SOE) in Cairo established a forward base, designated Force 266, at Bari, Italy, in 1944 to run operations into Albania. The country had been under Axis occupation since Easter 1939 when Mussolini’s troops had invaded, forcing King Zog and his family to ﬂee to Greece. After that, Julian Amery had plotted from Belgrade for Section D, and Fanny Hasluck had formed the nucleus of an Albanian Section by teaching a handful of volunteers about the country and its ﬁercely tribal people. Since the German invasion of Yugoslavia and the loss of the Secret Intelligence Service (SIS) station in the British Legation in Belgrade, there had been no news from Tirana, Albania’s capital. The ﬁrst mission to Albania was consensus in April 1943, in which Billy McLean and David Smiley parachuted into northern Greece intending to walk across the frontier; they were accompanied by Lieutenant Garry Duffy of the Royal Engineers, who was a demolition expert, and a wireless operator, Corporal Williamson. Their interpreter, an Albanian named Elmaz, decided at the last minute to abandon the mission. Despite this setback, consensus landed safely in Epirus, linked up with John Cook of SOE’s Greek Section and then undertook a trek across the mountains into Albania where, on the second attempt late in June 1943, contact was made with Enver Hoxha, the Communist leader of the local partisan guerrillas. Once relations had been established with him, by a series of airdrops to equip his men, permission was granted for the installation of a British Military Mission. The main British military liaison ofﬁcer, Brigadier Trotsky Davies, parachuted into Albania with a full headquarters team, dropped from two aircraft based at Benina, to a reception committee organized by consensus; a couple of nights later, Alan Hare arrived\n\n10 •\n\nALBANIA\n\nwith the remainder of the contingent. In July 1943, two Royal Air Force (RAF) ofﬁcers, Tony Neel and Andy Hands, were dropped, and in August four teams were launched on the same day in two Halifaxes from Derna: sculptor, led by Major Bill Tilman; sconce, by Major George Seymour; sapling, by Major Gerry Field; and stepmother, by Peter Kemp. Together these missions, attached to large mixed bands of Communist irregulars, Italian deserters, and Bulgarian stragglers harried the occupying forces by setting ambushes and organizing raids on local enemy garrisons. Although none of the actions by itself led to any general collapse of the occupation, the Germans were obliged to waste precious resources at a critical time by strengthening an area that had virtually no strategic value. McLean and Smiley were extracted in November 1943 by motor torpedo boat from the coast to Bari, and by that time SOE’s presence in Albania was considerable. Richard Riddell and Anthony Simcox were ﬂown in to replace McLean and Smiley, and John Hibberdine was dropped in December with Lieutenants Merritt and Hibbert. By the end of April 1944, Smiley was back, on consensus ii, this time accompanied by Julian Amery. These operations were not achieved without casualties. Two Halifaxes crashed in Albania while approaching their drop zones, killing their crews and two entire SOE missions. Major Field blew himself up with high explosives while ﬁshing, and Colonel Arthur Nicholls died of gangrene. sconce’s wireless operator, Bombardier Hill, was killed by enemy action and Trooper Roberts of stepmother died of exposure after he had been captured and then managed to escape. Brigadier Davies was also captured, in January 1944, along with Jim Chesshire, Captain F. Trayhorn, and his RAF sergeant, a former rear gunner named Smith. Another signiﬁcant loss was Philip Leake, killed in a German air raid six weeks after he landed in May 1944. SOE personnel sent to Albania endured appalling privations, but perpetuated the strategic ﬁction that the Balkans was the likely target for an Allied thrust straight into Germany. This scenario, ever popular with Winston Churchill, was never a likely prospect, but the German High Command failed to appreciate the strength of opposition articulated by the chiefs of staff and the Americans. In consequence, a disproportionate number of Axis units was kept tied up in southeast Europe by what amounted to a tiny group of Allied liaison\n\nALBANIA •\n\n11\n\nofﬁcers attached to a rather larger number of guerrillas who, it must be recognized, spent almost as much of their time ﬁghting each other as engaging the common enemy. SOE failed to persuade the disparate factions involved from participating in what amounted to a civil war in Albania and Yugoslavia. In both countries, SOE’s logistical support contributed to eventual Communist supremacy. Predictably, SOE’s experience in Albania included friction with both the SIS and the Ofﬁce of Strategic Services (OSS). Smiley and McLean fell out with a representative of the former, a Greek who called himself Tony Corsair, when one of their supply drops was hijacked. Perhaps unwisely, they had conﬁded their signal system to Corsair, who intercepted the containers ‘‘and used the weapons for his own purposes.’’ Relations with the Americans were strained because SOE ‘‘refused to cooperate with OSS agents unless they accepted British command and used British communications’’; the OSS was unwilling to accept these conditions, so no special operations teams were ever dispatched to Albania. Instead, some ﬁve SIS missions were sent, the ﬁrst of which, tank, arrived in November 1943 by an SIS-sponsored motorboat from Italy and based itself in a cave by the sea. This team was obliged to withdraw three months later following enemy activity in the area and the ill health of the group’s three members. They were replaced in March 1944 by bird, which provided a reception committee for three further OSS secret intelligence (SI) teams, all of which remained with the Communist guerrillas until Tirana was liberated. The OSS’s ofﬁcial historian had some harsh words for the lack of British enthusiasm for the SI Division’s efforts: ‘‘The principal difﬁculty encountered by SI/Albania was its lack of control over transportation. . . . Support of U.S. teams by the Balkan Air Force (British) was unreliable throughout. After months of waiting had beset several missions, the head of the Albanian desk unsuccessfully proposed, as had sections chiefs in other areas, the establishment of an OSS air unit to obviate such delays.’’ Several of those who emerged from Albania subsequently wrote about their experiences: Amery in Sons of the Eagle, Kemp in No Colours or Crest, Smiley in Albanian Assignment, Davies in Illyrian Adventure, and Anthony Quayle in A Time to Speak. Xan Fielding, himself a member of SOE’s Greek Section, recounted McLean’s adventures in One Man in His Time. Squadron Leader Neel’s memoirs,\n\n12 •\n\nALLEN\n\nthough written, have yet to be published. All have a common theme of mismanagement at SOE headquarters in Cairo and Bari, and they display great affection for the guerrilla bands with whom they lived and fought. After the war, SIS misinterpreted the loyalty expressed by some former comrades-in-arms and employed some former members of SOE’s Albanian subsection to subvert Hoxha. Hare, Hibberdine, Smiley, Kemp, Amery, Anthony Northrop, and Dayrell Oakley-Hill all played active parts in mounting an ill-fated clandestine offensive against Tirana in 1949. Blame for the debacle has often been attributed to Kim Philby’s duplicity, but the reality is that SIS’s postwar planners underestimated the determination of the Albanians to defend themselves, and even a despotic government, from external interference. The ﬁrst three missions sent into Albania by SIS overland from Greece or across the Adriatic suffered only minimal casualties, and it was not until the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) embarked upon large-scale airdrops, employing e´migre´s trained at a major camp in Germany, that the Communists inﬂicted a really heavy toll on the inﬁltrators. Most were captured and then subjected to show trials in Tirana that ended in executions or long terms of imprisonment. The prospects of those that completed their missions and tried to leave the country were not much better. Both the Yugoslav and Greek authorities were hostile to the scheme and refused to cooperate with SIS or the CIA. The whole project was ﬁnally abandoned late in 1951, leaving Albania to Hoxha, who ensured that it remained a political and economic backwater for the next half-century. ALLEN. MI5 code name for Arthur Lakey, a detective sergeant until his dismissal from Scotland Yard in August 1919 during the police strike. Formerly a Royal Navy rating for 11 years, Lakey joined the Metropolitan Police in November 1911. Later he was employed by the Vigilant Detective Agency, which was run by other former police strikers, and supplied information to MI5 about the Soviet espionage network run in London by William Ewer under the news agency cover of Federated Press of America (FPA). The FPA was closed in November 1927 and allen was given a redundancy payment.\n\nALLIANCE •\n\n13\n\nALLEN, WILLIAM. Educated at Eton, Bill Allen was elected the Unionist MP for West Belfast in 1929 but resigned in 1931 and became an ardent supporter of Sir Oswald Moseley’s British Union of Fascists (BUF). He was also one of Max Knight’s agents, supplying MI5 with valuable information about the structure, activities, personalities, and funding of the BUF. During World War II, Allen served in the Life Guards in the Middle East and Africa, and in 1943 he was appointed press attache´ at the British embassy in Beirut. Later he was to serve as a diplomat in Ankara until 1949. A lifelong friend of Kim Philby, Allen employed Philby to ghostwrite a history of his family’s Belfast-based publishing ﬁrm after the suspected traitor had been ﬁred from the Secret Intelligence Service. The book was published in 1957 without any acknowledgment of Philby’s role. ALLEN, VIC. A Communist Party of Great Britain activist and a founder of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, Professor Vic Allen was born in 1923 and left school at the age of 15 to become a bricklayer. He served in the Royal Air Force during World War II and later studied at the London School of Economics. After gaining his doctorate, he was appointed a lecturer at Leeds University in 1959. According to an examination of the Hauptverwaltung Aufklarung ﬁles released after the collapse of the Berlin Wall in 1989, he was also an agent of inﬂuence for East Germany. ALLEY, STEPHEN. A veteran Russian-speaking Secret Intelligence Service (SIS) ofﬁcer, Major Stephen Alley was based in Paris between the wars and worked with Sidney Reilly. During World War I, he had operated for SIS in St. Petersburg and had been evacuated in February 1918. After the war he served in MI5 for three years, and then moved to Paris where he ran a business trading in commodities. ALLFORD HOUSE. Headquarters of the Russian subsection of the Diplomatic Section of GCHQ in Park Lane, London, headed by Bernard Scott and including John Croft and Felix Fetterlien. A highly secure satellite of the Berkeley Street ofﬁces led by Alastair Denniston from 1942, Allford House produced the iscot intercepts. ALLIANCE. Code name of a successful intelligence network, with nearly 2,000 members, run by the Secret Intelligence Service in\n\n14 •\n\nALL-RUSSIA COOPERATIVE SOCIETY\n\nenemy-occupied France during World War II and headed by MarieMadeleine Fourcade. ALL-RUSSIA COOPERATIVE SOCIETY. The All-Russia Cooperative Society (ARCOS) was the principal Soviet trade organization in Britain in the 1920s, during the period when there was no formal diplomatic recognition of Lenin’s Communist regime. It shared premises at 49 Moorgate with the Soviet Trade Delegation. In May 1927, the ARCOS ofﬁce was raided by Special Branch on the suspicion that a classiﬁed Royal Air Force manual had been passed to an employee. The raid failed to recover the missing manual, thought to have been handled by Wilfred Macartney, but did succeed in ﬁnding a quantity of interesting documents and lists of Comintern cover addresses overseas. The police occupation of the building lasted 104 hours and resulted in the publication of a White Paper disclosing material seized from the strong rooms and incinerator, together with a selection of wireless trafﬁc intercepted and decrypted by Government Code and Cipher School. ALPASS, JOHN. A career MI5 ofﬁcer, John Alpass served as one of Dame Stella Rimington’s two deputy directors-general until 1994, when he was appointed intelligence coordinator to the Cabinet. In 1996 he played a key role in chairing the interdepartmental committee supervising the preparation and publication of The Mitrokhin Archive. AMERASIA. A pro-Communist journal based in New York. In January 1945 Amerasia published an article based on a British Intelligence assessment of postwar policy on southeast Asia concentrating on Thailand, and when scrutinized it was evident that the content had been drawn from a classiﬁed paper written by an Ofﬁce of Strategic Services (OSS) ofﬁcer, Kenneth Wells. Fearing a leak and following a complaint from the British, OSS’s security section conducted an investigation into the source of Amerasia’s information and made an illicit search of the editor’s ofﬁce on Fifth Avenue. Hundreds of classiﬁed ofﬁcial documents, from virtually every branch of the government, were found. Surveillance of editor Philip Jaffe and his staff resulted in the June 1945 arrest by the Federal Bureau of Investiga-\n\nAMERY, SIR JULIAN •\n\n15\n\ntion of seven suspects, among them an ofﬁcer working in the U.S. Ofﬁce of Naval Intelligence, Andrew Roth. Jaffe was convicted and ﬁned, but charges against the others were dropped because of OSS’s illegal entry. AMERY, JOHN. The son of the British Cabinet minister Leo Amery and an admirer of Hitler, John Amery joined the British Union of Fascists and lived in Germany throughout World War II. He was arrested in July 1945 by Italian partisans and charged with having recruited British prisoners of war into the British battalion of the German SS, the so-called Legion of St. George, to ﬁght on the Russian front. He had also made radio propaganda broadcasts into Britain, but after his capture he was diagnosed as suffering from a psychopathic illness by two Home Ofﬁce psychiatrists, who also acknowledged that he was not insane. To save his family from further embarrassment, Amery pleaded guilty to eight counts of treason at his trial in November 1945 and was sentenced to death. He refused to appeal and was hanged in December 1945. According to the hangman, Amery said, ‘‘I don’t suppose you would shake the hand of a traitor?’’ to which the hangman replied, ‘‘No, but I’ll shake the hand of a brave man.’’ AMERY, SIR JULIAN. Having only just come down from Oxford, Julian Amery was touring Albania when Europe was plunged into crisis in 1939. When he arrived in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, he was invited by a contact at the British embassy to join the Secret Intelligence Service’s Section D. Although his knowledge of Albania was limited to the visit he had only recently completed, Amery was represented as an expert on the country, and this was to be his entre´e into the secret world. On the basis of his experience in Section D, Amery was appointed deputy head of the Balkan branch of Special Operations Executive (SOE), based in Cairo, and supervised the inﬁltration of the ﬁrst British military mission into enemy-occupied Yugoslavia in September 1941. Thereafter, Amery concentrated on SOE’s Yugoslav Section, though he later joined an SOE mission to the Communist guerrillas in Albania. Amery recalled the solid grounding he had been given in the espi-\n\n16 •\n\nAMIES, SIR HARDY\n\nonage ﬁeld by having read the exploits of earlier secret service personnel: ‘‘As a young member of those services, I proﬁted a great deal from the memoirs of Paul Dukes and Compton Mackenzie and others who had been through the mill. What they had to say taught me a lot and in a sense was an inspiration.’’ Thus one generation of intelligence ofﬁcers gave a lead to another. After the war, Amery continued his interest in Albania and was one of those consulted when SIS hired David Smiley to train and inﬁltrate anti-Communist guerrillas into Albania to topple Enver Hoxha’s regime. Amery was elected to the House of Commons as the Conservative member for Preston in 1950 and eventually retired in April 1992. The following month he was elevated to the House of Lords. AMIES, SIR HARDY. The World War II head of T Section, the Belgian section of the Special Operations Executive (SOE), Hardy Amies was ﬂuent in French and German, having managed a factory in Germany before the war. He joined SOE in early 1941 from the Intelligence Corps as an instructor on the German Army at Beaulieu. In November 1941 Amies began training T Section, and in August 1943 he succeeded Claude Knight as its head; he was deputy to Philip Johns until the Low Countries Section was created. In September 1944, Amies led SOE’s forward mission into newly liberated Belgium. He remained in SOE until July 1945 when he returned to the world of couturiers, being appointed the queen’s dressmaker and receiving a knighthood in 1989. ANAND PARBAT. Situated northeast of Delhi, India, Anand Parbat was the location of the Wireless Experimental Station (WES), GCHQ’s regional headquarters during World War II, accommodated in Ramjas College. The WES was headed by Colonel Patrick MarrJohnson and was divided into ﬁve sections: A, Administration; B, Analysis; C, Codebreaking and Translation; D, Trafﬁc Analysis; and E, Radio Interception. ANDAMAN ISLANDS. One of the most successful strategic deception campaigns of World War II, masterminded by Peter Fleming, resulted in two Japanese divisions being used to defend the Andaman\n\nANGLO-GERMAN FELLOWSHIP •\n\n17\n\nIslands. Fleming persuaded the Japanese that the largely uninhabited atolls, located between Burma and India in the Indian Ocean, were politically signiﬁcant because they were the only Indian territory occupied by the Japanese during the conﬂict, and he succeeded in isolating a large enemy force for much of the war. At the end of hostilities, the islands were liberated by a small force with no ﬁghting. ANDERSON, SIR ROBERT. The assistant commissioner of the Metropolitan Police until 1901, Robert Anderson had been a civil servant in the ofﬁce of Lord Mayo, the chief secretary for Ireland, when in 1868 he was appointed as an adviser in the Home Ofﬁce on political crime. Anderson had employed an agent, Thomas Beach, alias ‘‘Major Henri le Caron,’’ to penetrate the ranks of the Fenian Brotherhood in the United States and foil several plots, including a plan to dynamite Westminster Abbey during the Jubilee service of thanksgiving in 1887. In that year Anderson wrote a series of anonymous articles for the Times describing what had been achieved by undercover operations, but his authorship did not become public until 1910, long after his retirement, when he made more controversial disclosures in Blackwood’s magazine, prompting demands that he forfeit his pension for revealing secrets. ANDRE´, JOHN. While serving as adjutant-general to General Sir Henry Clinton, the commander of British troops in New York during the American Revolution, Major John Andre´ of the 54th Foot Regiment ran the local intelligence apparatus. He was arrested in September 1780 while meeting one of his agents, Benedict Arnold. Andre´ had negotiated the surrender of the fortiﬁcations at West Point, New York, but had been caught as he attempted to return to the British lines with a safe-conduct pass signed by Arnold. He was tried and hanged at Tappan, New York, in October 1780, the British having refused to exchange Arnold for him. In 1821 his body was exhumed from a grave at the foot of the gallows and reinterred at Westminster Abbey. ANGLO-GERMAN FELLOWSHIP. A society with an open membership, the Anglo-German Fellowship was dedicated to the im-\n\n18 •\n\nANGLO-TURKISH SECURITY BUREAU\n\nprovement of relations with Germany and in the 1930s was considered a front for pro-Nazi political activity. A banquet held at the Savoy Hotel in July 1936 to honor the kaiser’s daughter, the Duchess of Brunswick, when the organization boasted a membership of nearly a thousand, was attended by Admiral Sir Barry Domvile, Lord Redesdale, and Kim Philby. ANGLO-TURKISH SECURITY BUREAU. Created in 1941 at the initiative of Commander Vladimir Wolfson of the Naval Intelligence Division, the Anglo-Turkish Security Bureau acted as a conduit to the Secret Intelligence Service for information about wartime travelers to and from the Balkans. This intelligence was collated in Cairo with isos material and enabled Section V to monitor the movements of suspected enemy agents. ANGOLA. In 1943 Special Operations Executive (SOE) established in Angola a network of intelligence agents, mainly reporting on economic topics and the supply of strategic minerals. The agents worked under the commercial cover of the Sogedex Rubber Company. Headed by Colonel A. W. Smith, based in Cape Town, South Africa, SOE recruited the ‘‘S Organisation’’ of Pro-British Portuguese with key positions in the army, railways, and post ofﬁce. Among its plans was one to seize Axis shipping, which was not pursued. ANKER GCHQ. Code name for intercepted wireless trafﬁc transmitted from Ankara, Turkey, during World War II relating to the Soviet Union and Britain in the Middle East. ANTHROPOID. Special Operations Executive (SOE) code name for the mission to assassinate the hated SS-Obergruppenfu¨hrer Reinhard Heydrich in Prague. The operation was planned for the Czech National Day in October 1941, but bad weather forced two postponements, so the team did not assemble in Czechoslovakia until late December. Eventually, after further delays, a new date was set in May 1942. The plan was to ambush the Nazi leader as he was being driven to Prague from the country mansion he occupied. The trap was set at a sharp bend in the road on the outskirts of the city; as the chauffeur-driven Mercedes slowed to negotiate the corner, two SOE\n\nANTHROPOID •\n\n19\n\nmen would step into the road and attack the open-topped limousine. The two SOE assassins were a pair of Czech paratroopers, Jan Kubis and Josef Gabcik, from anthropoid; they were supported by two members of out distance, a three-man team that had arrived in March, Josef Valcik and Adolf Opalka. During the ambush, Gabcik’s Sten gun jammed at the vital moment, but Heydrich was mortally wounded by a Mills grenade thrown by Kubis. The SOE men escaped the scene, only to be betrayed to the Gestapo soon afterward by the third member of out distance, Karel Curda, who identiﬁed his comrades and their hiding place in return for a reward. Curda alone survived the war—to be hanged for treachery. anthropoid was to prove controversial because of the appalling civilian reprisals taken by the Nazi occupation forces. Thousands perished in a wave of executions, and the populations of whole villages were deported to concentration camps. One village, Lidice, was systematically reduced to rubble; the site remains untouched to this day as a memorial to those who were murdered. More than 13,000 people were arrested in the aftermath of Heydrich’s assassination, prompting many to wonder whether SOE’s Czech Section had been wise to launch such a provocative operation. In fact, however, SOE did little more than give logistical support to anthropoid, for the plan was certainly Czech in origin, having been hatched by the Czech government-in-exile in London, initially with SS-Gruppenfu¨hrer Karl Hermann Frank, the protektor’s hated state secretary, as the target. The assassins Kubis and Gabcik, who had transferred to the Free Czech Army from the French Foreign Legion, had been trained by SOE in Scotland and at Bellasis (STS 2) and had undergone their parachute course at RAF Ringway, but throughout they were still ofﬁcially attached to the Czech 1st Brigade at Cholmondeley Castle, near Whitchurch in Cheshire. The Secret Intelligence Service was also a party to anthropoid, as conﬁrmed by the then head of the Czech Deuxie`me Bureau, Colonel Frantisek Moravec, who recalled that the scheme ‘‘was necessarily shared with several ofﬁcials of the British MI6, who worked with us on the technical side.’’ anthropoid’s effect was to decimate the number of potential resisters in Czechoslovakia, reduce the willingness of the inhabitants to help parachutists, and ensure that SOE’s Czech Section would play only a peripheral role in the eventual liberation of that country.\n\n20 •\n\nTHE APOSTLES\n\nTHE APOSTLES. Ofﬁcially known at Cambridge University as the Conversazione Society, the Apostles is an exclusive, private club that dates back to the early 19th century. It acquired notoriety because of the secrecy surrounding its membership and the fact that some of the traitors of the period, including Anthony Blunt, Leo Long, Alister Watson, Guy Burgess, and Michael Straight, had been part of its self-selecting elite in the 1930s. The society had been created to discuss contemporary literature and philosophy, and Alfred, Lord Tennyson was its greatest poet, but in the prewar era it tended to elect Marxists and left-wingers, which was to cause some embarrassment to Lord Rothschild, who had twice delivered papers to the society. ARDAGH, SIR JOHN. A former private secretary to the viceroy of India, General John Ardagh was appointed director of military intelligence in June 1896. In his ﬁrst three years in the post, Ardagh supervised the collection and distribution of intelligence relating to 30 wars fought across the globe by British troops, from China to Nigeria to British Guiana. Under his direction, the Colonial Section of the Intelligence Division established links with 40 overseas administrations but was criticized by the Elgin Commission for failing to anticipate the Boer War. ARKLEY VIEW. Established by the Post Ofﬁce as a wireless intercept site in 1938, Arkley View, Barnet, became the headquarters of the Radio Security Service (RSS) in October 1940. Headed by Colonel J. P. G. Worlledge, RSS was staffed by 1,500 voluntary interceptors, who were responsible for monitoring the airwaves for the enemy’s illicit signal trafﬁc. Designated Special Communications Unit (SCU) 3, Arkley View was taken over by the Secret Intelligence Service’s Section VIII in 1941, and Worlledge was replaced by Professor F. J. M. Stratton, with Kenneth Morton Evans as his deputy. ARMOUR. Secret Intelligence Service code name for a well-connected Italian double agent who was part of an Abwehr stay-behind network in Rome in 1944. He was an aeronautical expert who had been employed to penetrate the Abwehr for the Servicio Informazione Militare and had volunteered to work for the British as soon as the Germans withdrew. His wife was also a member of the network,\n\nARTIST •\n\n21\n\nacting as his cipher clerk, and together they conveyed supposedly high-grade political intelligence, some of it derived from contact with Marshal Badoglio, to the Germans until the end of the war. ARMSTRONG, GEORGE. A Communist Party of Great Britain member, George Armstrong deserted his ship in Boston and in October 1940 was reported by British Security Coordination (BSC) as having attempted to contact the Abwehr in New York using the alias George Hope, offering information about transatlantic convoys. BSC tipped off U.S. immigration authorities, and Armstrong was arrested and deported. He was detained upon his return to Cardiff in February 1941, tried under the Treachery Act in June, and executed at Wandsworth in July. ARMSTRONG, ROBERT. Later ennobled as Lord Armstrong, Robert Armstrong was Cabinet secretary when Peter Wright published his memoirs in Australia in 1986 and traveled to Sydney to appear as a witness to support the British government’s attempts to suppress SpyCatcher as a breach of the author’s duty of conﬁdentiality to MI5. Armstrong argued that Wright’s book contained information that was highly classiﬁed and had not been released elsewhere, but the court found that much of the content had in fact appeared elsewhere, with the implicit consent of the Thatcher administration. Earlier in his career as a civil servant, Armstrong had been indoctrinated into venona and undertook a research project to identify a Soviet spy with access to the White House in 1944, referred to in venona texts as ‘‘Agent 19.’’ MI5 subsequently concluded that Agent 19 was probably the Czech prime minister, Eduard Benes. ARNIKA. Code name for the intelligence supplied by Colonel Oleg Penkovsky, the GRU spy arrested in 1962 and executed the following year. Penkovsky’s access to Soviet missile handbooks provided the Secret Intelligence Service and the Central Intelligence Agency with invaluable insight into Soviet missile strengths and revealed the distinctive trapezoid conﬁguration of surface-to-air missile sites that proved so useful during the Cuban Missile Crisis. ARTIST. Code name for a Secret Intelligence Service agent, Johann Jebsen, who was an Abwehr case ofﬁcer based in Lisbon during\n\n22 •\n\nASCENSION\n\nWorld War II. Jebsen was responsible for handling a double agent named tricycle but was arrested by the Gestapo in April 1944 and later executed at Oranienberg concentration camp. ASCENSION. Secret Intelligence Service (SIS) code name for an ingenious UHF communications device developed at Whaddon Hall during World War II by the technicians of SIS’s Section VIII. ascension enabled agents on the ground to use a voice channel to a low-ﬂying aircraft circling in the vicinity. ASHANTI CAMPAIGN. The ﬁrst war to be fought with a formal intelligence division was a punitive expedition in 1895. The Ashantis of West Africa had defeated the British commissioner in 1892 and since then had used his skull as a ceremonial drinking vessel. The tribe was so feared that native troops would not approach even the body of a dead Ashanti, so General Sir Garnet Wolseley led a force of three regular battalions, drawn from the Riﬂe Brigade, the Royal Welsh Fusiliers, and the Black Watch, with the dashing Captain Redvers Buller acting as the head of intelligence. Buller received a comprehensive brieﬁng from Major Charles Wilson of the new Intelligence Branch, then only six months in existence, and succeeded in recruiting a 250-strong Corps of Scouts, which located King Coffee Kalkali and his army. By interrogating prisoners, deploying reconnaissance patrols, and watching the enemy, Buller’s unit laid the foundations for a signiﬁcant victory at Kumasi in early February 1875, conclusively demonstrating the value of an intelligence branch. Among those serving with Buller was Captain Henry Brackenbury, later the ﬁrst director of military intelligence. ASPIDISTRA. Code name of a huge 700-kilowatt radio transmitter located in a bunker deep in the Ashdown Forest at Crowborough, near King’s Standing in Sussex, used to broadcast to Europe during World War II. Purchased from the Radio Corporation of America by British Security Coordination with the personal approval of the prime minister for more than £110,000, aspidistra was the world’s most powerful radio and used an antenna strung between three specially constructed 115-foot masts. Its signals carried Calais-Sender programs, recorded by the Political Warfare Executive, intended to de-\n\nATKINS, VERA •\n\n23\n\nceive German troops. It also occasionally participated in dartboard and jammed enemy transmissions on the medium wave suspected of assisting Luftwaffe navigation. aspidistra transmissions, supervised by Secret Intelligence Service technicians, began in November 1942 and continued until the end of hostilities. In 1944 an unsuccessful attempt, codenamed silent minute, was made to use aspidistra to jam the guidance systems of V-2 rockets. At the end of the war, the Diplomatic Wireless Service took over the site; it was later acquired by the BBC World Service. In 1984 the Home Ofﬁce developed the bunker as a secret nuclear headquarters, but two years later it was handed over to the Sussex Constabulary as a police training facility. ASSESSMENT STAFF. Since 1968 the Joint Intelligence Committee (JIC) has had the beneﬁt of a small, independent analytical component. Its personnel are drawn on temporary secondment from the armed services, Whitehall, and the agencies. Organized into Current Intelligence Groups, the Assessment Staff prepares weekly reports for the JIC’s consideration. ASTOR, LORD.
