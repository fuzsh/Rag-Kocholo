Among the mourners are Little Richard, Andrae Crouch, Della Reese, The Temptations' Ali-Ollie Woodson and Joe Cocker, who sings his Preston-penned hit \"You Are So Beautiful.\"\n\nThe 59-year-old keyboardist, known for his collaborations with the Beatles and the Rolling Stones, as well as solo hits like \"Will It Go Round In Circles\" and \"Nothing From Nothing,\" died on June 6 after being in a coma for several months. Little Richard, who brought a teenage Preston on tour with him in 1962, praises his unparalleled talent. \"[He] made that piano walk and talk,\" he said. \"Nobody in the world played the piano like Billy. He never got the credit he deserved.\" Preston isn't just remembered as a musician, but as a friend. Letters pour in from colleagues who aren't present at the service, including the Stones, Eric Clapton, and Bonnie Raitt. Paul McCartney, who performed with Preston on the Beatles' Let It Be album, including the hit \"Get Back,\" writes: \"I am deeply saddened to lose such a wonderful friend. I love you, Billy.\" Preston is often referred to as the \"Fifth Beatle,\" as his amiable presence during the album sessions held the fractious band together. He was also present for the group's last public performance on the rooftop of Apple Studios in 1969. Musical tributes include Joe Cocker singing a stirring rendition of \"You Are So Beautiful,\" his 1975 hit co-written by Preston, and former Temptations' lead Ali-Ollie Woodson belting \"With You I'm Born Again,\" Preston's Top 10 duet with Syreeta Wright. Tata Vega also sings the gospel tune \"Walk With Me\" in remembrance. The prolific performer's credits stretched over four decades in support of countless acts. His last public performance was in support of the re-release of the 1972 film The Concert for Bangladesh in 2005, where he was joined by Dhani Harrison and Ringo Starr on a rendition of George Harrison's \"Isn't It A Pity.\"\n\nCategories\n\nFunerals"
