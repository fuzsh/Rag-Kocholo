        "text": "THE ROLLING STONES CHRONICLE\n\n1975\n\nI've got to fly today on down to Baton Rouge\n\nJanuary 19, 1975: Keith Richards contributes to a recording session by Alexis Korner in London, England. Keith\n\nRichards and Anita Pallenberg are by now living at Ron Wood's home, The Wick.\n\nJanuary 22-February 9, 1975: The Rolling Stones, with Billy Preston, start rehearsing guitarists and\n\nresume recording sessions for Black and Blue in Rotterdam, The Netherlands, using the Rolling\n\nStones Mobile Studio. Guitarists showing up include Jeff Beck, Wayne Perkins and Rory Gallagher.\n\nThe Rolling Stones start work on Crazy Mama, Slave, Melody and Worried About You among others.\n\nFebruary 10-March 1, 1975: Bill Wyman uses the Rolling Stones Mobile Studio at his home in England to work on\n\ncompiling unissued old Rolling Stones recordings for the planned but never released Black Box album.\n\nFebruary 12, 1975: Mick Jagger attends a Led Zeppelin concert at Madison Square Garden in New York Ciy. He\n\nalso introduces Jimmy Page to David Bowie.\n\nMarch 1975: The U.S.S.R. denies the Rolling Stones' demand to perform in that country, claiming they would not\n\nhelp Russians to achieve self-perfection.\n\nMid-March 1975: Mick Jagger jams with Ron Wood and members of Wings at the Record Plant in Los Angeles.\n\nMarch 25-April 4, 1975: The Rolling Stones continue recording sessions for Black and Blue at Musicland\n\nStudios in Munich, West Germany, with guitarists Wayne Perkins, Harvey Mandel and Ron Wood.\n\nMemory Motel, Hot Stuff, Hey Negrita and Hand of Fate are among the tracks recorded.\n\nKeith Richards (1975): In the Munich studios\n\nBasically, the Rolling Stones are a two-guitar band. As far as records go, it's no big hassle for me not to have another guitar player 'cause I'm used to doing all the parts. It's just I LIKE working with another player, that's the turn-on for me, hearing someone else fill in the spaces. We crossed the problem of Brian's death so successfully that it's actually harder to cross this one, 'cause Mick Taylor dropped out so naturally. A band doesn't stay together unless there's a reason.\n\nAs a guitar player I know what I can do. It doesn't matter about the B.B. Kings, Eric Claptons and Mick Taylors, 'cause they do what they do - but I know they can't do what I do. They can play as many notes under the sun but they just can't hold that rhythm down, BABY. I know what I can do and what I can't. Everything I do is strongly based on rhythm 'cause that's what I'm best at. I've tried being a great guitar player and, like Chuck Berry, I have failed.\n\nEarly April 1975: Ron Wood's home in Richmond, Surrey, is busted while he is away and his wife Krissy Wood is\n\ncharged for possession of cocaine.\n\nApril 14, 1975: The Rolling Stones issue a press statement announcing Ron Wood will accompany the\n\ngroup on their upcoming tour of the Americas.\n\nApril 26, 1975: The Rolling Stones arrive in New York City.\n\nLate April-May 1975: The Rolling Stones start tour rehearsals at Warhol Church Estate in Montauk,\n\nLong Island, New York.\n\nMay 1, 1975: The Rolling Stones, with Ron Wood, announce their 1975 Tour of the Americas by\n\nperforming Brown Sugar on a moving flatbed truck down 5th Avenue in New York City.\n\nKeith Richards (1975): The last time?\n\nThe last time? I don't know where that comes from. Nobody in the band gives off that impression or even thinks that. They said it in '69; they said it in '72; why the fuck should THIS be the last time? What else are we gonna do? Get a job in an ad agency?\n\nMick Jagger (1975): Reasons for doing the tour\n\nThat's like me asking you if there's a specific reason for you doing an interview with me. I mean it's my job, it's my vocation... no musician is beyond that, no musician is until they get too old. That's my vocation, or my pleasure.\n\nMay 17, 1975: Mick Jagger smashes his hand through a restaurant window in Montauk, Long Island, requiring\n\ntwenty stitches on his wrist.\n\nMay 20-25, 1975: The Rolling Stones rehearse on their stage set at an airport in Newburgh, New York.\n\nMay 26-28, 1975: The Rolling Stones rehearse in Montauk, Long Island again.\n\nMay 31, 1975: The Rolling Stones are in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, going through the last rehearsals.\n\nMay 31, 1975: The Rolling Stones' first compilation album on their own label, Made In The Shade, is released in the U.S..

This is the only time on the tour the Rolling Stones perform two concerts\n\non the same day, a frequent occurrence on previous tours.\n\nJune 3-6, 1975: The Rolling Stones perform concerts in San Antonio, Texas and Kansas City to 53 000\n\nat Arrowhead Stadium. The inflating penis balloon during Star Star is not used in San Antonio,\n\nfollowing police pressure.\n\nJune 4, 1975: The Rolling Stones hold a photo shoot at the Alamo.\n\nMick Jagger (1975): Not a lonely rock star on the road\n\nI'm very happy. (I'm not l)onely... no, not lonely at all. Why should I be? I have my dearest friends with me, Keith, Charlie... most of the band are my friends, and a lot of other people who have been my friends for years. It's not like I'm on tour and I'm the Lonely Rock Star. I mean forget it, doesn't apply to me.\n\nJune 6, 1975: Against the Rolling Stones' wishes, ABKCO Records releases Metamorphosis, an album of unreleased Rolling Stones and Andrew Oldham Orchestra/Jagger-Richards recordings/demos from 1964-1969.\n\nJune 8-18, 1975: The Rolling Stones swing through the north, performing in Milwaukee, Wisconsin;\n\nSt. Paul, Minnesota for the first time; Boston; Cleveland to a record 82 000; Buffalo, New York; and\n\nToronto for two concerts at the Maple Leaf Gardens, the sole Canadian stop on the tour.\n\nJune 22-27, 1975: The Rolling Stones perform six concerts at Madison Square Garden in New York City.\n\nEric Clapton and Carlos Santana join in on encores.\n\nJune 29-July 2, 1975: The Rolling Stones perform two concerts each in Philadelphia and Washington\n\nD.C.

Cocaine is also found in the trunk of the car but\n\nKeith & Ron manage to escape charges. The weapon charge is later dropped.\n\nJuly 6, 1975: The Rolling Stones perform at the Cotton Bowl in Dallas, Texas.\n\nJuly 7, 1975: Now in Los Angeles, the Rolling Stones attend a surprise birthday party for Ringo Starr at the Beverly\n\nWiltshire Hotel, which Keith Moon also attends.\n\nJuly 9-13, 1975: The Rolling Stones perform five concerts at the Forum in Los Angeles, California.

Fourteen... and that was mature music compared to Venus and Blue Jeans which was the hit at the time I started. The band I was in at the time was playin' music by 40-year-old men. So this guy says to me the other day, You're over 30, how can you write rock and roll songs? But I started off by singing songs by 40, 50, 60-year-old men... You Gotta Move was written by a 70-year-old man. I mean what does it matter?\n\nThe thing about rock and roll is - I never wanted to be a rock and roll star. I've never been into singing teenage lyrics, and when I started I did these songs written by old people. Perhaps that's why people were sometimes shocked by my lyrics... well, not shocked, but interested, at a point where there was no real interest in lyrics...\n\nThere is a perpetual adolescent influence because what I was doing when I was 18 I'm doing now. I mean the room I had at the Olympic Hotel in Seattle is the same room I would have had in 1964. I mean it wasn't any grander, it was the same room. And I'm doing the same things, slightly different of course. Instead of travelling on commercial planes we've got our own, but it's still the same thing. And the responsabilities I have are much less than someone who used to come to our concerts when they were 17 and now they've gotten married and have five children and two cars and three mortgages. I'm married and have children and all that, but I don't sort of worry about it because I'm doing what I did before... when I was an adolescent.\n\nI only discovered this really by looking at other people in rock and roll... it perpetuates your adolescence, for good or bad. I don't know if it's good or bad, because I can't evaluate it. It feels real nice and I don't give a shit... I don't feel responsabilities other people feel. Obviously, being in a rock band makes you more adolescent than if you worked in an IBM company and really had to worry about your future. I don't worry about the future. I'm living out my adolescent dreams perpetually.\n\nJuly 23-28, 1975: The Rolling Stones swing through the Great Lakes region, performing in Chicago,\n\nBloomington (Indiana) and Detroit.\n\nJuly 30-August 2, 1975: The Rolling Stones play concerts in the southeast, in Atlanta, Georgia;\n\nGreensboro, North Carolina; and Jacksonville, Florida at the Gator Bowl.\n\nAugust 2, 1975: The Rolling Stones announce they are cancelling what would have been their first-ever\n\nconcerts in Latin America (Mexico, Brazil and Venezuela).\n\nAugust 4-6, 1975: The Rolling Stones perform in Louisville, Kentucky and, for the first time, Hampton,\n\nVirginia.\n\nAugust 8, 1975: The Rolling Stones end their 1975 North American Tour with an added, extra concert\n\nin Buffalo, New York.\n\nMick Jagger (1978): On the 1975 tour being about spectacle and buffoonery\n\nIt may have looked like that, but I didn't feel like that. Which means I wasn't acting it properly... (I)t's easy to say: Ah well, they're not as good as they were before. It may be your eyes that are jaded, rather than US.\n\nAugust 13, 1975: Mick Jagger purchases bootleg records in New York City.\n\nAugust 15-November 1, 1975: Ron Wood performs his last tour with The Faces, playing North America again.\n\nAugust 25-31, 1975: Bill Wyman holds recording sessions in Sausalito, California for his second solo album.
