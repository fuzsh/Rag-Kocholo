        "text": "All of the nostalgia for Beatlemania that America went through the other week, on the fiftieth anniversary of the group’s appearance on “The Ed Sullivan Show,” had me doing what I’m sure a lot of people were doing: thinking about my Beatles upbringing. I’m too young to remember the performance; I was asleep in my crib at the time, my mom reported when I talked to her last week. I clearly remember the Beatles cartoons, but I used my grandfather’s turntable to play his copies of “Meet the Beatles” and “Abbey Road,” and entered pop-music maturity long after the Beatles were broken up. My generation saw them as solo artists.\n\nA Beatles reunion seemed unlikely, though everyone had their favorite Beatle and favorite Beatles album. My cool friends liked the George and John songs on “Revolver,” but I was a Wings man, leaning toward Paul, who was at the top of the charts when I was in high school, although it felt a little fake when they played old Beatles songs, especially in their Wings outfits. Then, in 1980, a reunion became a moot point when John Lennon was killed. After that, I began to dread the idea of a Beatles reunion, given that the remaining Beatles had become even more singular.\n\nAnd yet, strangely, a Beatles reunion seemed to grow more likely, owing to rock-music currents of the time. It was the era of the supergroup. Cream is an oft-cited early example (Eric Clapton, Ginger Baker, and Jack Bruce), while Asia (members of King Crimson, Yes, and Emerson Lake and Palmer) is a later example that is, thankfully, less cited. The supergroup was an attempt to turn the perfectly sound rock-group category up to eleven. If the Beatles were to reunite after successful solo careers, they would not be the Beatles but a supergroup, and a problem.\n\nA related phenomenon was the temporary supergroup. I guess you could call it the super lineup: they usually appeared toward the end of the giant charity or cause concerts that started happening around then, such as George Harrison’s Concert for Bangladesh or the No Nukes concerts at Madison Square Garden, in 1979, performed by the Musicians United for Safe Energy collective (MUSE), with Jackson Browne, Graham Nash, Bonnie Raitt, and Bruce Springsteen. Growing up in New Jersey, I heard this show on the old WNEW-FM, and I remember liking individual performances but dreading the inevitable lineup of multi-guitarists, which led to mush.\n\nThe worst part of all this super-ness was the multiple sets of drums. Though I was getting closer to understanding that I myself was not good enough to make my living playing drums, my drum tastes were refining, or so I believed. I was listening to more jazz, as well as music that my now-adult kids can’t believe existed—i.e., jazz-rock or funk—and when multiple rock drummers drummed it sounded like clutter, with the possible exception of the Allman Brothers, who worked in a bluesy space that allowed for exceptions. Sure, there have been some successful super lineups: everyone singing “I Shall Be Released” in The Band’s “The Last Waltz,” for instance, though that works because there is only one extra guitar, Ron Wood, who looks a little like he walked into the wrong hotel room. The super part is the chorus, which led eventually to “We Are the World,” and then to parody.\n\nI read that Julian Lennon did not attend “The Night That Changed America: A Grammy Salute to the Beatles,” which aired last week and the week before, speaking of overkill. The younger Lennon said he feared it would seem like karaoke, and it sometimes did. I watched a little during the first airing, and then a little more during the repeat, and I found myself defending Katy Perry for the first time in my life when the guy at my stationery store attacked her rendition of “Yesterday” as having taken too many liberties. “At your own concert, O.K., but not at a tribute concert,” he said. The so-called Beatles reunion segment felt, sadly, like a mini-supergroup. Ringo sang “With a Little Help from my Friends,” and Paul did a short set of tunes ending with “Hey Jude,” the audience all singing along, a pale reënactment of the 1968 “Hey Jude” performance on TV.\n\nI should mention my bias, which is that I went through a time in my post-teen-age life when my favorite Beatle drove me nuts. I get it now; Paul just loves playing—can’t get enough of it, loves it. And I am still amazed by the drum fills he played on “Back in the U.S.S.R.” and “Band on the Run,” and the other day I happily listened to “Ram.” But the past month’s events had me going back to a moment, about a decade ago, when he and all the post-Beatles Beatles really impressed me, when I was in a hotel room in Wisconsin and saw the band reunited.\n\nIt was the “Concert for George,” a night in 2002 in London, directed by Eric Clapton and accompanied by several supergroups’ worth of musicians from Harrison’s life. Everything about it—all the potential super-ness—made me wary. It was at the Royal Albert Hall, and the band played beneath a portrait photo of an early-Beatles-era Paul. The first half opened with a Sanskrit prayer read by Ravi Shankar, followed by Indian music played by Shankar’s daughter, Anoushka, and others. It was beautiful. The second half opened with a comedy routine directed by Eric Idle that featured a butt-naked Tom Hanks, among other butts naked. (The takeaway: George was fun!) The band was even a super supergroup in some ways—Clapton, Tom Petty, Jeff Lynne, Billy Preston—but it saved itself from super-ness by being in humble service to the evening, remembering a friend a year after his passing. There was a sense, to the viewer in a Holiday Inn Express, who may have been having a beer and was drained from a day of driving, of balance and equanimity.\n\nI was driving across the country with my wife and our two kids. It was one of those horrible driving nights when you strain to stay awake and then, when you finally arrive at the motel room, you are suddenly wired, sleep nowhere in sight. As my family passed out one by one, I sat in a chair, at first casually watching the concert on cable, then locked in, and then, by the time Ringo sang “Photograph,” I was mesmerized.\n\n“Photograph” was a song Ringo had written with George for “Ringo,” an album that not just George but Paul and John had played on. The John and George parts were recorded in L.A. and the Paul parts in London, as some drug arrests were apparently keeping Paul out of the U.S. On “Photograph,” the Beatles had reunited after all, and now, at this musical wake, they were playing a piece from their long-ago afterlife. Ringo sang the lyrics that he co-wrote with George: “I can’t get used to living here while my heart is broke; my tears are crying for you.” “The meaning’s changed now, of course,” Ringo said, in his matter-of-fact Ringoliness.\n\n“Photograph” was great, not just Ringo schlock. And then, after a Carl Perkins cover, Ringo announced Paul. At that, Ringo hurried to his drum kit, next to not one but two other drummers. I winced—Oh, God, no!—but there was nothing to fear. Paul played an old Beatles song (“Two of Us”) and a charming version of “Something,” and then, without saying anything (so unlike Paul!), he played the last song, the one that got me—the title track from what remains the best-selling Beatles solo album, “All Things Must Pass,” a giant, three-disk record of pent-up songwriting by George.\n\nAs the story goes, George, like a lot of the guys who were playing onstage that night, was blown away by The Band when he first heard them. He travelled to Woodstock to hang out with Levon Helm and company, and ran into Bob Dylan, who he wrote a song with. According to Joshua Greene’s “Here Comes the Sun: The Spiritual and Musical Journey of George Harrison,” George was inspired to write “All Things Must Pass” by a Timothy Leary poem, Leary being another former Hudson Valley resident, and by The Band.\n\nIt is a simple lyric, a description of the cycle of the day, and it is orchestrated for a big, even super, Phil Spector-like sound. You can hear the Beatles slog through it halfheartedly in outtakes from “Let it Be,” the film of the band’s late recording sessions, in which Paul and John reject it—was the title alone too much of a metaphor when they were all trying to keep the band together? Eric Clapton reported that Paul had to re-learn the song for the “Concert for George,” and there is the indication that Paul was humbled. When the song starts, the thousand guitarists (or so it seems) of the superband’s super lineup create a panoramic valley of acoustic strumming through which horns and strings flow. The multiple drums are powerful and clutter-free. See Jim Keltner make room for Ringo’s fills, see Ringo listen for Keltner. See them make space, because great drumming is about not drumming, one of the few life lessons that drumming has to share with us all.\n\nPaul sings it beautifully, Paul being Paul. “The darkness only lasts a nighttime; in the morning, it will fade away,” he sings. It is his William Cullen Bryant moment, another Hudson Valley-inspired “Thanatopsis.” And at one point, he turns to the guitarist behind him to smile. It’s George’s son, Dhani, who is beaming. I remember losing it at around this moment, my family all asleep, not just in nostalgic sadness but with happiness about the road ahead, coffee in the morning—it was one of those motel moments of transcendental delight."
