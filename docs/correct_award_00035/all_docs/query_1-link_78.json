He was one of the key figures in the Manhattan Project during World War II, which led to the creation of the first controlled nuclear chain reaction. Fermi’s work also extended to other areas of physics, and he received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1938 for his discoveries related to artificial radioactivity.\n\nBorn: September 29, 1901\n\nDied: November 28, 1954"
