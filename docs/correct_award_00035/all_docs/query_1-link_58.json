        "text": "Lise Meitner helped discover the radioactive element protactinium, and was the first to describe and coin the term “nuclear fission” in a scientific paper. She was the first woman physics professor in Germany. The rise of the Nazis forced Dr. Meitner to flee Germany because of her Jewish ancestry. Her name was left off scientific papers in Nazi Germany. She continued her work in Sweden. Having overcome so many obstacles in life, Dr. Meitner actively supported women in science for the rest of her career. In 1997, element 109 was named in her honor: meitnerium.\n\nThis page on Lise Meitner is part of the Women in Radiation History section of RadTown."
