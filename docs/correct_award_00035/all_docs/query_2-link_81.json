        "text": "Enrico Fermi (1901-1954)\n\nPhysicist\n\nFaculty, 1939-42\n\nIn the words of Richard Rhodes, Enrico Fermi was \"the last of the double-threat physicists: A genius at creating both esoteric theories and elegant experiments.\" In 1938, Fermi won the Nobel Prize for his work in the field of neutron physics by determining that slowed neutrons were effective in creating radioactive transformations. Fermi later built on this work with the Manhattan Project, in which Fermi and his colleague Szilard co-invented the nuclear reactor. In 1942, Fermi and his fellow scientists assembled the first full-scale nuclear reactor and tested it in the University of Chicago's doubles squash courts. The achievement was earth-shattering. As fellow scientist Eugene Wigner noted: \"For some time we had known that we were about to unlock a giant. Still, we could not escape an eerie feeling when we had actually done it.\" Fermi continued to perfect nuclear reactors at Los Alamos, and was present at the first test of the atomic bomb in 1945. Thereafter, Fermi served on the Science Advisory Panel that counseled the government on the use of nuclear weapons. Though Fermi argued against the use of the bomb, he was ultimately convinced that the U.S. had to use it militarily; he and his fellow scientists wrote: \"We can propose no technical demonstration likely to bring an end to the war; we can see no acceptable alternative to military use.\""
