        "text": "Description A physicist who was awarded a Nobel Prize in 1938 for his work on induced radioactivity. Fermi was born in Rome, Italy and earned his Ph.D. at the Scuola Normale Superiore in Pisa. At the age of twenty-four he became a professor of atomic physics at the University of Rome. With the rise of Fascism in Italy, Fermi was offered a position at Columbia University and the family moved to a house on Summit Avenue in Leonia. The trip to Stockholm to accept the Nobel Prize had been their means of escape from Italy. The Columbia team moved to the University of Chicago to begin construction of the first nuclear pile and then finally the Manhattan project, as it came to be called, moved to Los Alamos, New Mexico. Fermi is frequently referred to, along with J. Robert Oppenheimer, as the \"father of the atomic bomb\"."
