        "text": "Who is Enrico Fermi?\n\nEnrico Fermi was born a citizen of Rome, Italy in 1901. While in grammar school, he excelled in Mathematics and Science and was encouraged to study hard and do well. Later, Enrico Fermi attended the University of Pisa, where he obtained a doctorate degree in Physics; becoming well known for his work in the field of Nuclear Fission.\n\nIn 1938, Enrico Fermi received the Nobel Prize in Physics for his exploration of slow neutrons, chain reactions and new radioactive elements. After receiving the Nobel Prize, he and his family immigrated to the United States of America, where he became a Professor at Columbia University, continuing his explorations of physics.\n\nMost notably, Enrico Fermi is known for his discovery of nuclear reactions, leading to the development of the atom bomb. We all are impacted by Enrico Fermi''s work today as his discoveries lead to the use of s-ray machines, radiation treatment for cancer patients and the creation of electric power through the use of clean nuclear energy. Enrico Fermi later passed away in November 1954, as a result of stomach cancer. We, the World Community, are indebted to Enrico Fermi, for his drive and passion to positively impact human kind; hence honoring him by naming our school after him."
