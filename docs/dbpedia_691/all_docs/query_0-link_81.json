I spent some time going through this book, exploring the words and activities that are a part of it. At the end of The Artist’s Way I found this prayer and, though I did not at the time consider myself an artist, it helped me to settle into my own space, to not feel quite so frazzled, and to work on what needed working on. I share with you for when it is needed.\n\nAn Artist’s Prayer by Julia Cameron\n\nO Great Creator,\n\nWe are gathered together in your name\n\nThat we may be of greater service to you\n\nAnd to our fellows.\n\nWe offer ourselves to you as instruments.\n\nWe open ourselves to your creativity in our lives.\n\nWe surrender to you our old ideas.\n\nWe trust that it is safe to follow you.\n\nWe know you created us and that creativity\n\nIs your nature and our own.\n\nWe ask you to unfold our lives\n\nAccording to your plan, not our low self-worth.\n\nHelp us to believe that it is not too late\n\nAnd that we are not too small or too flawed\n\nTo be healed ---\n\nBy you and through each other - and made whole.\n\nHelp us to love one another,\n\nTo nurture each other’s unfolding,\n\nTo encourage each other’s growth,\n\nAnd understand each other’s fears.\n\nHelp us to know that we are not alone,\n\nThat we are loved and lovable.\n\nHelp us to create as an act of worship to you.\n\npeace,\n\nRenee Arundhati"
