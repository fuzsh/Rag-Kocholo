Julia Cameron is an award-winning poet, playwright, and filmmaker. Julia has written thirty books, ranging from her widely-praised, hard-hitting crime novel The Dark Room to her volumes of children’s poems and prayers.\n\nThe Artist’s Way has sold more than two million copies worldwide, and her followup bestsellers The Vein of Gold, Walking in this World and The Right to Write are likewise flagship books which are taught in universities, churches, human potential centers and even in tiny clusters deep in the jungles of Panama.\n\nCredited with founding a new human potential movement that has enabled millions to realize their creative dreams, Julia Cameron eschews the title creativity expert, preferring instead to describe herself simply as an artist. “Artists have always mentored, I just do it on a wider scale.”\n\nChampioned by such people as Washington Post music critic Joseph McClellan who cites her “enormous gift for melody,” Cameron explains, “Most of us have no idea of our real creative height. We are much more gifted than we know. My tools help to nurture those gifts.”\n\nHoping to inspire others to “simply start,” Cameron has penned two “into-the-water” books: The Right to Write and The Sound of Paper. Gentle, but powerfully catalytic, these works serve both as introduction and reminder of the power of creative living.\n\nCameron recently published a romantic novel entitled Mozart’s Ghost. In it, creative ideas are the stuff of everyday magic.\n\nJulia Cameron lives in New York City with two dogs.\n\nThis interview was conducted byMicheál O’Mathúna who is a Journalist, Author, Filmmaker, Media Relations Consultant and Radio Show presenter. He also conducts one-to-one coaching, group coaching and delivers transformative workshops in various areas of health and wellbeing. He is also the founder of The Health Zone, which an inspiring, motivational and educational platform to empower people to be healthier, happier, more authentic and realise their true potential in their lives.
