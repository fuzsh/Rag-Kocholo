        "text": "Walk the Talk Show with Waylon Lewis presents:\n\nIn this episode of Walk the Talk Show with Waylon Lewis, an award-winning video and podcast series hosted by Elephant Journal, Waylon talks with Julia Cameron. Author of The Artist’s Way, Julia talks about guidance and how we can empower ourselves to seek it, and use it, in our daily lives.\n\nShe calls it the essential fourth tool of The Artist’s Way—though she hasn’t spoken much about it since the original book was published. She uses it in her daily life, and now we can as well.\n\nAn excerpt about guidance from her new book: Living The Artist’s Way: An Intuitive Path to Greater Creativity. ~ Julia Cameron\n\n“It’s a book about guidance, and about the fact that we all have access to a higher power and to wisdom. When I wrote ‘The Artist’s Way’, I introduced the tool of guidance. I said, it’s normal, it’s natural. You can do it. Please try it.\n\nThen I let it go.\n\nAnd I went for 30 years without mentioning guidance again, even though I was using it all the time.” ~ Julia Cameron\n\nA clip of our conversation:\n\n“It’s separate from Morning Pages. You do your morning pages, you finish them—and they open you up to asking for guidance.\n\nYou might want to keep a separate journal for your guidance. You have your morning pages in one book, and then you’re asking for guidance and answering it in another book.” ~ Julia Cameron\n\nOr listen to the podcast:\n\n“It’s really very simple. You simply put the pen to the page and say, ‘What about X’?\n\nThen when you have asked, ‘What about X?’, you listen for a response and it comes quickly and steadily, and it becomes something that you can count on. It becomes something that you can look back and say, ‘Oh, I thought it was farfetched. But in fact, it turned out to be right.'” ~ Julia Cameron\n\nWant the rest of this convo?
