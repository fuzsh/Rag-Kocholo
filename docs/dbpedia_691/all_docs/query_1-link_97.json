Passion gives you a positive vibe that can protect you against burnout. And the same passion can make you go too far, so you are more likely to burn out.

And there are always people who don’t […]\n\nOn Wikipedia I found the most simple definition of an artist: a person who creates art. And when art originally just meant ‘skill’ or ‘craft’, it’s now used as an abbreviation for creative art or fine arts. ‘Creating’ is the key here.
