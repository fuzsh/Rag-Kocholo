        "text": "“Do you think everything happens for a reason, or that it’s all random, or like a Forrest Gump-style mix?” I asked my new friend Tom last weekend, sitting at lunch under some live oaks, surrounded by kiddos.\n\n“You know,” he said, relaxing his body a minute, “I don’t know.”\n\n“That’s a good answer,” I said.\n\nPsst: This site uses affiliate links.\n\nI love the space of I don’t know. In my spiritual life, led by the likes of Tara Brach and Eckhart Tolle, whose teachings encompass lessons from all spiritual traditions, the not-knowing, an attempt at still openness, has been central.\n\nI never prayed into that openness, until my conversation with Julia Cameron.\n\nIn her book Seeking Wisdom, she recounts how prayer became a key tenet in her creative life, as much as morning pages or artist’s dates. And she convinced me to try it.\n\nIn moments when I don’t know what to do, I am able to ask. Can anyone or anything hear me? I don’t know. Am I praying to an external entity, or simply my highest self? I don’t know. Is my father here, in some kind of afterlife, watching and rooting for me? I don’t know.\n\nBut I do know that when I say what I need, when I ask for it, I am greeted with a wave of calm. I have put it out there. I have done my part. There’s only so much I can control.\n\nWatch my conversation with Julia at the link below!\n\nI created a full year of writing prompts for writers looking for a little more ooomph in their daily practice. Want to get a topic to write about each day in your inbox?"
