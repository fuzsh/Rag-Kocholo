        "text": "In her new book, The Listening Path, Julia says, \"And what does it mean, to listen? We listen to our environment, whether it is the chirping of the birds or the commotion of the city streets—or perhaps we don't listen, tuning it t instead. We listen to others—or perhaps we wish we listened better. Others listen to us—or we wish they did. We listen for our instincts, our hunches, our guidance—and perhaps we wish we could hear them more clearly and more often.\"\n\nIn this Poetic Listening with Julia Cameron interview, my first question was, can you talk to us about your relationship with poetry and how it has informed the work you've done over your career? Guess what? Julia answered by saying, poetry is my secret vice, followed by a lovely poem titled Remembering. And the interview goes from there with more poetry, a summary of her new book, The Listening Path, and a few reflections on how and why Julia's work has become an indispensable tool for anyone who wants to live a more creative life.\n\nClick HERE to listen to Julia Cameron’s ideas on poetry, listening, and creativity.\n\nYour Listening Path\n\nJulia's willingness to listen poetically is one of the top reasons her work (50 plus titles) endures and grows. Check out Julia's new book The Listening Path / The Creative Art of Attention. Julia also gives an excellent summary of her book in this podcast.\n\nIf you're willing, like Julia, you can listen poetically too. Here's an example of poetic listening. Close your eyes and list the sounds around you. Here's mine: Fly buzzing, fridge running, crickets, my breath, my fingers typing the keys, lawnmower in the distance, fly hitting the window, my feet moving on the floor, a distant songbird, and truck pulling into the driveway. After you finish your list, do a ten-minute timed writing using some or all of the elements on your list.\n\nMeanwhile, enjoy this interview. I'll catch you on the turn-around somewhere down the line. Stay in touch.\n\nClick HERE to listen to Julia Cameron’s ideas on poetry, listening, and creativity.\n\nClick HERE to listen to more Twice 5 Miles Radio Shows, alway aired first on WPVMFM-Asheville."
