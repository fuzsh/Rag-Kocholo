        "text": "Join us for this very special three-part event with Julia Cameron.\n\nDuring this 3-session virtual intensive, Julia Cameron will teach the fundamentals from her classic bestseller The Artist's Way and her brand-new book Living the Artist's Way.\n\nDrawing from her decades of experience, Julia's wisdom will free you as a writer so you can finally make your ideas a reality.\n\nTogether we will explore the foundational tools that make a writing life possible, like:\n\nMorning Pages\n\nArtist Dates\n\nMeditative Walking\n\nOutside Guidance\n\nMoving on from the fundamentals, she will outline how writing is not dependent on mood.\n\nContrary to common writing mythology — which tells us writers need special times, special places, and even special pens — you will learn how to write at any time and in any place by the end of this class.\n\nThe three 90-minute workshops will take place March 13, March 20 & March 27 at 4 pm PST/7 pm EST\n\nEach session will include time for Q&A, and every attendee will get access to replays for four months.\n\nAbout the Author\n\nHailed by the New York Times as “The Queen of Change,” Julia Cameron is credited with starting a movement in 1992 that has brought creativity into the mainstream conversation— in the arts, in business, and in everyday life. She is the best-selling author of more than 40 books, fiction and nonfiction; a poet, songwriter, filmmaker, and playwright. Commonly referred to as “The Godmother” or “High Priestess” of creativity, her tools are based in practice, not theory, and she considers herself “the floor sample of her own toolkit.” The Artist’s Way has been translated into forty languages and sold over five million copies to date.\n\nClick here to visit her website"
