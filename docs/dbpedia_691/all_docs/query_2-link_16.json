        "text": "How Artist Dates and Daily Writing Are The Key To Your Happiness\n\nSo, we’re almost halfway through 2024 and yes this is the first time you are hearing from me this year. (To all the new subscribers – a belated hello and welcome!) Previously I would have felt a lot more guilt regarding the fact that I haven’t written to you more because\n\nA) I’m a writer and so surely I should be sending you more of my writing and B) What does it say about me that I haven’t sent anything out this year other than what I’ve posted on social media?\n\nWell, firstly 2024 has been quite the year. Over and over I’ve been hearing stories of pain, loss, death and destruction. People are tired. Tired of the BS. Tired of being lied to. Tired of false promises and a lack of compassion or a sense of community. The world that we once knew is falling apart and it’s been difficult for us all to find our feet post-pandemic. I’ve had my own struggles these past few months but to help me cope better, I’ve been working on not just being compassionate and showing up for my students and clients but also showing myself the same kindness and mindfulness when it comes to my own life and writing practice.\n\nI don’t want to be sending you a monthly piece just to tick a productivity box. I am intentionally choosing to write more from a place of contemplation and honesty and if that means you only hear from me in this format a few times a year, so be it.\n\nI hope when you read this that you too find yourself in a moment of quiet contemplation. If you’ve ever faced the daunting abyss of a blank page, you know it can feel more like navigating an endless sea than standing before a welcoming invitation. As a writer, I’ve been there too—sitting down to write and engulfed by a storm of worries and doubts, questioning the significance or the impact of my words.\n\nIt’s a familiar scene for many of us, isn’t it? Those moments when self-doubt tiptoes in as subtly as the evening shadows. It’s precisely during these times that carving out a sanctuary for our thoughts proves most valuable and we attempt to slay the dragon that is Imposter Syndrome or the dreaded Writer’s Block.\n\nPhoto by Brandon Russell on Unsplash\n\nThis is why I am excited to let you know that I will be facilitating Julia Cameron’s “The Artist’s Way” course—a creative haven just for you in the comfort of your own home. Whether you’re picking up your pen for the first time in years or you journal regularly, this course is crafted to guide you through a journey of creativity and healing. You do NOT have to consider yourself a creative or work in a creative field to do this course. It is designed for anyone that is looking to reconnect with themselves or wants more daily magic in their lives.\n\nHow often have we promised ourselves, “I’ll start writing/painting/exercising tomorrow,” only to see tomorrow slip away? Procrastination is a cunning adversary, making the mere thought of beginning seem insurmountable. The Artist’s Way provides gentle guidance and structured exercises that inspires daily action over apathy. Week by week, you will discover the magic of morning pages that will revolutionize your writing and daily routine.\n\nPhoto by “My Life Through A Lens” on Unsplash\n\nHave you caught yourself endlessly refining the same sentence, chasing an unattainable perfection? Perfectionism can be crippling, barricading our creativity with fears of inadequacy. The Artist’s Way will help you welcome imperfection, celebrating your unique voice as not only sufficient but utterly vital. We delve into the philosophy of process over production encouraging you to relish the act of creation itself and get over your need to ‘get it right’.\n\nThat persistent whisper (or maybe it’s a lot louder in your mind) doubting your right to write—”Who am I to do this?”—is an all-too-common refrain. Imposter syndrome can make us feel like frauds in our creative journeys. For 12 weeks, you will be provided with course materials that are tailored to boost your confidence, empowering you to embrace and affirm your creative identity in whichever way you choose to express yourself.\n\nPhoto by Laura Chouette on Unsplash\n\nBut don’t just take my word for it, here’s what previous course participants had to say:\n\n“I always believe we meet the right people at the right time. Amy, your fresh perspective and wise insight to things really changed my life. I’m excited and inspired to take all that I have learnt on The Artist’s Way and continue on this creative path with more motivation. I’m really glad our paths have crossed. The course is way more than just about art. Such a wonderful life changing experience” – Tasneem A, South Africa\n\n“If you had told me by the end of this course that I would look forward to spending time by myself going on creative adventures, I would have laughed. Amy has taught me how to value my time and the power of intentions. If you are looking for incredible support, accountability and want real change, do The Artist’s Way with Amy Kaye. You will not regret it!”\n\n– James S, United Kingdom\n\nAs a blog subscriber, you get to benefit from an exclusive discount on the course fee.

Payment plans are available.\n\nLet’s transform whispers into roars and doubts into declarations. I eagerly anticipate welcoming you into an online space where you can reclaim your creative spark and take your life back.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this and know of someone that you think would benefit from hearing about this work or would like to join one of the upcoming courses, workshops or want some one-on-one coaching, please support my work by spreading the word and sharing this.\n\nGet Unstuck, Tell Your Story and Write On!\n\nWill you allow yourself the gift of time, self-care and peace this festive season?\n\nSo we’ve made it to December and already the festive season is in full swing. A lot of us have this Disneyfied fantasy in our heads of how we hope the holidays will be but then reality sets in and with that comes added pressure, anxiety and expectations both of ourselves and others.\n\nIt’s okay if the end of the year is not your favourite time of year. It’s okay if instead of feeling the excitement of a child, the thought of spending time with people makes you want to self-isolate. To be honest, the thought of having to deal with the public, traffic or the never-ending queues when shopping makes me feel overwhelmed just thinking about it. Yikes.\n\nIf you are feeling a bit burnt out, compassion fatigued or stressed about the next few weeks, I’m not surprised. This year has been a LOT and our minds and bodies are feeling it.\n\nHave you taken any time out this year to process what has happened?\n\nThis festive season, will you be brave and listen to what your heart needs instead of giving in to the pressures all around you?\n\nCan you allow yourself a few hours a week to be still amongst the chaos and put yourself first?\n\nAs an introvert and highly sensitive person, I know how hectic this time of year can be. With that in mind and based on feedback from my students, I have created a course for those of you who would like to end the year off by letting go of any stories that no longer serve you while exploring and expressing yourself in a safe space free from judgment or criticism.\n\nFor course details, click on the link below:\n\nWriting Sacred – An Advanced Course\n\nAs a narrative coach and expressive writing teacher, I believe that creativity is the key to personal growth and self-discovery. Writing Sacred is an 8 week online course tailored to help you understand and shift the stories and beliefs you hold about yourself and your life and help bring about positive changes.\n\nEach week we will look at a different time period in your life from birth until present day. You will be given weekly journalling prompts so that you have time to process and reflect on each step of your writing journey.\n\nOver the course of two months, we’ll explore expressive writing techniques, dive deep into our creative dreams and help each other overcome any obstacles or resistance we may encounter along the way.\n\nYou will be part of a small select group of like-minded individuals who share a passion for creative expression and personal development.\n\nOur weekly sessions will provide a safe and supportive space for you to share your ideas, get feedback and you will receive guidance and support from me.\n\nTogether, we will explore different creative approaches that will help you break through any creative blocks and tap into your fullest potential.\n\nAccountability and community are key to maintaining a consistent creative practice. In Writing Sacred, you’ll find both. Our weekly meetings will give you the space and time to reflect as well as the support and encouragement you need to keep going while we celebrate our wins together however big or small.\n\nAs Writing Sacred is an advanced course, it is only available to any students who have previously completed one of my courses. The only requirement is a commitment to your creative journey.\n\nThrough Writing Sacred, I believe that you will gain confidence in your artistic abilities and nurture your inner artist. You will learn to prioritize your creativity, cut down on wasting time and establish healthy habits for all areas of your life.\n\nAs December is my birthday month, I will be giving an exclusive discount to all subscribers so remember to use the word DISCOUNT when getting in touch.\n\nWriting Sacred starts on Sunday 10th December from 6pm – 8pm SAST until Sunday 4th February 2024.\n\nPlease note there will be no class on Sunday 31st of December but we will resume the following week.\n\nLet’s end the year off together by telling our stories and stepping into next year feeling refreshed, rested and revitalized by tapping into our creative magic.\n\nHappy holidays to you and yours – Write On!\n\nThanks for reading Write On! – A Blog About Writing As A Tool For Healing!\n\nSubscribe for free to receive new posts, get exclusive discounts and support my work.\n\n11 Years of storytelling and expressive writing magic\n\nOn the 29th of August 2012, 11 years to the day, I ran the very first Write On workshop at a collaborative artist’s studio in Cape Town, South Africa. At the time, I wasn’t sure what to expect. I was a secret writer for many years because I didn’t feel that my writing was good enough to share, I struggled with procrastination (hello writer’s block!) and had major imposter syndrome. Who was I to help other people tell their stories if I couldn’t even tell mine?\n\n“If there’s a book that you want to read but it hasn’t been written yet, then you must write it.” – Toni Morrison\n\nI still struggle with putting myself out there. As an introvert, I live mainly in my mind and spend a lot of my time observing the world. I would much rather spend my time people-watching than making small talk at a party. But I have found that if you start to ask people the right questions, you begin to discover how complex and surprising they are. Write On is a safe space to tell your story where you will not be judged for how you see the world or criticized for your spelling, grammar or writing style. Write On is a place to let it all hang out, warts and all while giving yourself the time to process what you have been through in order to figure out where you want to go next.\n\nI still can’t believe that I get the profound privilege of hearing so many different stories from so many different walks of life. Eleven years of stories that have made me laugh and cry. Stories have changed me and the way I see myself and others. Stories that have given me hope in a world which is broken and made me feel more connected to humanity. From American university students, inspiring change makers, sex workers, frustrated parents, self-aware and self-conscious teenagers, aspiring actors, domestic abuse survivors, corporate management, European delegates and exhausted teachers – these are just a few examples of some of the amazing people I have worked with. In eleven years, I’ve helped you ‘birth’ poetry, scripts, non-fiction and children’s books with narrative coaching and editing sessions and have felt like a proud book mom seeing you sign books at your first book launch.\n\nIf you’ve been with me from the start or have only just found out about Write On, this is a reminder that it’s never too late to tell your story. If you are struggling with procrastination, writer’s block and imposter syndrome and feel stuck; if you want to start but have absolutely no idea how to begin and need some support then allow me to be your support, accountability partner and expressive writing guide.\n\nWant to reignite your creative spark before the year is over? Join me online for Julia Cameron’s The Artist’s Way. It’s the perfect guide to overcome creative fatigue while on a journey of self-discovery. With fun, engaging exercises, weekly artist dates and mindful writing practices, you’ll discover new ways to express yourself and reconnect with your inner artist.\n\nThis is a reminder that this is the LAST time that I will be running this course this year and places are limited so that each student gets individual attention.\n\nBut don’t just take my word for it, here is what some previous students have had to say:\n\n“I never thought of myself as a creative or artistic person but with Amy’s guidance and this incredible course, I have found my voice. In just three months, I am so much more open to life and have a beautiful daily practice that I will continue to do long after the course. Don’t overthink it – do the course – it will change your life! ”\n\n– Nandi Ngesi, Johannesburg\n\nWrite On 10 Year Celebration 2023 – Photo by Jesse Kramer Photography\n\n“If you had told me by the end of this course that I would look forward to spending time by myself going on creative adventures, I would have laughed. Amy has taught me how to value my time and the power of intentions. If you are looking for incredible support, accountability and want real change, do The Artist’s Way with Amy Kaye. You will not regret it!”\n\n– James Smith, United Kingdom\n\nAs my little way of saying thank you to all of you who have subscribed to this blog and for continuing to support the work that I do, I would like to offer you a discount on Julia Cameron’s The Artist’s Way which I will be running online from the 10th of September 2023. Use the code TAW11 at the link below to be eligible.\n\nPlease note this is a time-sensitive offer and can only be used until Sunday the 3rd of September 2023.\n\nhttps://tellyourstorywithwriteon.wordpress.com/courses-and-workshops/the-artists-way/ The Artist’s Way\n\nIf there’s one thing I know to be true, every single person has a story to tell. Your story is as unique as you are. Your story has power and by sharing it, you give other people permission to do the same. Here’s to you and your wonderful stories. Thank you for an incredible life-changing eleven years. Write On!\n\nThanks for reading Write On! A Blog About Writing As A Tool For Healing ! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work.\n\nSo it’s been a while since I wrote a blog piece and I’m not quite how to feel about that. In fact, this is the first blog piece that I’m sending out for 2023 and the first quarter is almost over. Yikes!\n\nAs a narrative and writing coach, I spend most of my time helping people get unblocked creatively, deal with procrastination and find their voices using writing as a tool for healing. One would think that I would find it easy to write a monthly blog, right? Right?! Well, it’s not that I haven’t been working it’s just I’ve been so busy running workshops in person, giving talks and facilitating courses online that well, this newsletter has taken a back seat, to be honest.\n\nLadies, this one’s for you.\n\nIf you have been meaning to do an expressive writing course this year but\n\nA) Can’t commit to doing it in person because you aren’t based in Cape Town\n\nB) Have an unpredictable schedule and would prefer to write at your own pace\n\nC) Have wanted to do a course with me but have Zoom fatigue\n\nD) Would prefer to do a course exclusively for women from around the world\n\nthen In Her Own Words may be just what you are looking for.\n\nAs a narrative and writing coach, over the last 10 years, I’ve seen time and time again how creative anxiety can hold people back from expressing themselves fully. I know because it’s something I personally struggle with. For years as an introvert and somebody who was bullied throughout my schooling, I struggled to tell my story and share my truth. Even sending out this newsletter leaves me feeling vulnerable if I’m perfectly honest.\n\nBut even though I worry about what you will think, the whole reason why I started Write On! was because I knew I wasn’t alone in my struggles. I was looking for a safe space to express myself without fear of having my writing critiqued and was looking for others that were also struggling with creative anxiety. That’s why I created my latest e-course, In Her Own Words. It’s a safe, supportive online space where women can learn to overcome their fears and get unblocked creatively.\n\nIt’s a 21 day e-course in which you will receive daily emails with prompts, guidance and you will be invited to join an exclusive group online where you can connect with other women around the world while being guided on this journey. When we share our experiences, struggles, triumphs and life lessons, we realize how much we have in common. By sharing our stories, we give ourselves and others permission to also be vulnerable, imperfect and human.\n\nSharing your truth isn’t always easy especially when it’s with strangers on the internet – I get it. It requires courage, vulnerability and a willingness to be open and honest. It means facing your fears and embracing your authentic self. It means acknowledging the parts of you that you may have been hiding for fear of judgment. No wonder we feel scared! But not to worry, that’s where I come in as your trusty creative guide.\n\nBut don’t take my word for it, this is what Amy Gerreyn from Australia had to say about the course:\n\n“What an amazing course! Amy has put so much thought and love into every day of this challenge and to be able to do it with a group of women is wonderful. You may be scared to share your inner thoughts with others but Amy has made it such a safe space that you really do feel like you’re with a like-minded community.\n\nI would recommend this course to anyone feeling like they aren’t at one with themselves, feel like they can’t write from the heart or want to be more in touch with their soul.\n\n5 stars! ”\n\nIf you have been wanting to write but don’t know where or how to start, join me next week from Monday 27th March 2023 for In Her Own Words. You don’t need to have any previous writing experience to take part.\n\nFor all course information, click on the links above. As a blog subscriber, use the code EARLY BIRD by Thursday 24th March to receive an exclusive discount.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this and know of someone that you think would benefit from hearing about this work or would like to join one of the upcoming courses, workshops or want some one-on-one coaching, please support my work by spreading the word and forwarding this.\n\nThank you for your support.\n\nGet Unstuck, Tell Your Story and Write On!\n\nLike a good writer, I’ve been procrastinating. (Did you know that 90% of writers when they have to write procrastinate?! It’s a thing, it’s not just you!) I’ve been wanting to write this to you for over a month now but the words wouldn’t come. Well, not exactly. The words have been milling around in my mind keeping me up at night but nothing felt right.\n\nThe thing is Write On! celebrated a HUGE milestone this year. I’ve been doing this work for an entire decade and to commemorate that, I hosted a 10 year celebration.\n\nPhoto by Jesse Kramer Photography\n\nStudents from over the years were invited to give readings both virtually and in person. It was one of those things that like a good concert or performance can’t be encapsulated in words but what a special evening it was to be reunited with the Write On community some of whom I have not seen for many years.\n\nIt was heartfelt, life-affirming and it was incredibly special to laugh and cry with some of the people that have been on this journey with me and to hear their stories from over the years.\n\nSpecial thanks go to all contributions both virtually and in person and to those who braved the elements to join me one November night in Camps Bay. Photos of the evening will be up on social media in the New Year so if you haven’t seen them yet, check out Instagram https://www.instagram.com/writeonza/ or Facebook https://www.facebook.com/WriteOnSouthAfrica/\n\nAs it is the last day of 2022, it would be a bit weird if I didn’t do some reflecting. In fact, I’ve spent pretty much the whole of December looking back so that I can be ready for 2023. There are a number of ways I could share this with you. I could tell you how many courses and workshops I have facilitated and created both online and in person this year. I could tell you how many students have taken the next step in their writing journey and have taken private coaching sessions with me to edit their first book or have managed to get published. I could tell you how Thursdays have become my favourite day of the week because On Thursdays We Write (I run a weekly Zoom class every Thursday where students from around the world gather to do ‘social journaling’). But I think the best way to do this is to share with you some writing from one of my students because to witness the words of my students is to understand what Write On! is all about.\n\nFor our final drop in class this week, the theme was all about letting go and clearing space in order to be ready for 2023. Use the following prompts to help you gain some insights or clarity as to where you are right now and create new possibilities going forward.\n\nTwo of the prompts were:\n\nWhat questions were you asking yourself and/or others in 2022?\n\nWhat questions will you be asking yourself in 2023?\n\nHere is what Kerrythe Mahaffey wrote in class:\n\nWhat questions were you asking yourself and others in 2022?\n\nWhy? What is the point? What is driving you and me? How did you get to where you are? How did I get here?\n\nWhat’s at the root of it all? How do I continue moving forward?\n\nHow can we move forward?\n\nIs there something I can do to help you move forward?\n\nHow to really let go? How do I accept this? Do I accept this? Why don’t I accept this? If I don’t, what do I do? How do I remove myself?\n\nHow do I make a real choice?\n\nWhen will it stop? Will it stop? If it doesn’t, what do I do?\n\nDo I do anything?\n\nOr do I just stand and see and be patient?\n\nWhat questions will you be asking yourself in 2023?\n\nHow do I get to know myself? How do I really get to know myself, more than ever before? And how can I\n\nallow that me to be seen? In vulnerability. And be OK.\n\nHow can I be OK?\n\nI am OK.\n\nHow can I be more than OK? Do you need to be more than OK? Why do you need to be more than OK?\n\nHow can I learn to be OK with being OK?\n\nAcceptance.\n\nBut then there is growth.\n\nHow will I grow if I just accept? If I don’t make it grow, how will it happen?\n\nIt will just happen.\n\nOn its own. In its own time.\n\nSeemingly without you.\n\nBut you’re still part of it.\n\nHow?\n\nYou witness. Witness it all and let it be.\n\nThank you again Kerrythe for sharing these incredible insights with us. If you have taken a course with me and would like some support going into the New Year and want to try your hand at drop in classes, you might be the right fit for On Thursdays We Write.

It has sold over 4 million copies since it was published in the early 90s and is considered THE course on getting unblocked creatively.\n\nIt’s one of those things that every time you do it, it shows you something different and have had some students do The Artist’s Way with me multiple times as it has such powerful results.

It was the end of primary school and awards were being given for academic and creative excellence.\n\nBefore going to take my place and wait for the awards ceremony with all the other children, I was told to “not be disappointed if I don’t win any prizes or awards.” I already had low self-esteem thanks to years of bullying and was hoping that high school was going to be easier socially than primary school had been. Boy, was I wrong! But that bit of ‘advice’ was not what I needed to hear.\n\nIn my mind, I doubted that I was smart, creative or ‘good’ enough to be acknowledged even though I was doing well academically.\n\nAs the teachers and principal called out students to receive their prizes, you had to get up and walk across the stage in front of all the parents and children. A nightmare for introverts. Suddenly my name got called. Not once but over and over and over again. I excelled in reading, writing, Drama and English. At a moment when I should have felt proud of myself and in a mood for celebrating, I felt incredible shame. The eyes of all the other students felt like daggers in my back. Nobody congratulated me and it felt like the opposite of success had happened. I felt like a fraud, a failure. Now the kids hated me even more. Every time I heard my name called out, I wanted to disappear. Ah Imposter Syndrome, you old bugger. Ever since then, we’ve been battling.\n\nLooking back, I wonder how different that moment would have been for me if I had acknowledged my achievements instead of focusing on the jealousy and criticism of others?\n\nCan you remember who you were before the world told you who you should be?\n\nDid you know that according to psychologists there is not one but SEVEN inner critics? No wonder, we are struggling with Imposter Syndrome when things go well!\n\nThe good news is that as well as seven inner critics, there are also seven inner coaches/champions. These are the parts of you that know you are enough and want you to succeed and be happy without having to prove yourself to be worthy.\n\nWhat if instead of giving your inner critics power, you started listening to the compassionate, supportive parts of you instead?\n\nDue to public demand, for the first time I’m going to teaching in a new venue in Durbanville so for those of you based in the Northern Suburbs, I hope you will join me.\n\nPlease note this is the only time I will teaching this course in person this year.\n\nIf my story has resonated with you, join me for Silence Your Inner Critics, an 8 week immersive therapeutic writing course. No previous writing experience is needed to take part. You do not have to consider yourself a creative person to join but you do have to commit to daily journalling and be open to self-reflection.\n\nTo reserve your spot, please click on the link below:\n\nhttps://tellyourstorywithwriteon.wordpress.com/courses-and-workshops/silence-your-inner-critics/\n\nPlease note that there are only 8 spaces available and bookings are made on a first-come, first-served basis.

My hunger for knowledge is insatiable. Put me in a book store or a library and time will easily fly by. Whenever I start a new book, the anticipation still thrills me. I’m grateful that we have access to almost any information thanks to the internet but call me old school, I would still read a paper copy of a book if given the choice. There’s something special about it being tangible and something you can physically see. I would hate for my bookshelf to only be a virtual one.\n\nI’ve been trying to step out of my comfort zone the last few months but being a procrastinator and perfectionist, I find that I am often the one getting in my own way.\n\nOne thing that I find that helps me is to draw on the wisdom of those that have gone before me.\n\nMaybe these words of wisdom might help you too.\n\nPicasso said everything you can imagine is real.\n\nO’Keefe said I’ve been absolutely terrified every moment of my life and I’ve never let it keep me from doing a single thing I wanted to do.\n\nBasquiat said it’s not who you think you are that holds you back, it’s who you think you’re not.\n\nMonet said I would like to paint the way a bird sings.\n\nHaring said whatever you want to do, the only secret is to believe in it and satisfy yourself. Don’t do it for anyone else.\n\nVan Gogh said things are done by a series of small things put together.\n\nKahlo said nothing is absolute. Everything changes. Everything moves, everything evolves.\n\nRoss said we don’t make mistakes, just happy little accidents.\n\nKandinsky said the artist must train not his eye but also his soul.\n\nIf any of these words from the artistic masters have inspired you to take that first step, why not join me for Writing Scared – The Beginner’s Course, my most popular and previously sold-out course.\n\nNo previous writing experience is needed to take part.\n\nTo reserve your spot, please click on the website below:\n\nhttps://tellyourstorywithwriteon.wordpress.com/courses-and-workshops/writing-scared/\n\nPlease note that there are only 4 spaces left and bookings are made on a first-come, first-served basis.

Your life is predictable.\n\nMaybe you take comfort in the safety of knowing what each day will bring considering how tumultuous the last few years have been.\n\nBut… what if there’s a story inside you burning to be told?\n\nWhat if the thought of your life being exactly as it is right now brings up a feeling of dread?\n\nWould you be willing to step out of the comfort of familiarity in order to make the changes you want?\n\nAs part of Writing Scared, students get given writing prompts each week for homework. Kirsty Fox recently completed the beginner’s course and is somebody who has had to deal with many big changes in her life. The piece below is what she wrote in week 5 in response to one of the homework prompts. I was incredibly moved by her bravery and honesty and she has kindly agreed to share this piece with you too.\n\nA love letter to my body – Kirsty Fox\n\n“I know it seems like all these conditions are related but the reality is that you’re just unlucky.”\n\nThis is an actual quote, from an actual doctor, giving me his medical diagnosis: bad luck. If you look only at the surface of things, as I’ve learned as many doctors do, it would seem like he was right. Asthma, allergies, endometriosis, acne and not just any acne – severe recalcitrant acne. Acne that when asked about the link between a medication he was prescribing and suicide would lead a dermatologist to say to my mom, “We can’t be sure it’s the medication causing that. I mean, if your skin looked like hers, wouldn’t you want to kill yourself?”\n\nIt would take four years of failed treatments before we tried Roaccutane. Originally developed as a chemotherapy medication, this was the nuclear option. I was prescribed a heavy dose that brought side effects like nose bleeds, joint pain, lips so dry they cracked and bled but it all seemed worth it to me at the time because it also brought me clearer skin. It wasn’t to last though as I was in the 1% of patients whose acne re-emerges when they’re weaned off the medication. I would spend the next ten years blasting my system with this drug, struggling to keep my acne at bay.\n\nLocked in a war against a body that just refused to co-operate. “Why is this happening to me?”, I would often tearfully yell into the mirror. It was always a rhetorical question.\n\nI never really sat quietly to think about why. Not until things got much worse. Acute bilateral uveitis. My immune system attacking my eyes. Again, the only help the doctors could give me was a horrific medication that caused more problems than it solved. Steroid eye drops. One every hour. These drops would thin the lining of my eyes, causing a cataract in one. They would run down my sinuses into my ears causing a perforated ear drum and chronic tinnitus. I will never experience silence again.\n\nFor this price that I paid, did the drops work? No. My eyes kept flaring up. Left, then right, then both. Coming and coming and coming until I broke. For this was it in the end, the condition that nearly blinded me was the one that finally made me see.\n\nI had to stop. I had to be still and listen. I thought my body was making things so difficult for me when I didn’t realise my body had the hardest job of all – to change me. To make me feel all the feelings I had been running from. To learn to let go. To find acceptance. To grieve. My body had been blasting a message out all over my face but it was in a language I didn’t understand. Not until it sent that same message up into my eyes did I start to realise what my body had always been shouting at me.\n\n“Help me – I’m filled with hurt and I need to be loved and tended to”.\n\nSo now, if this was it and my journey in my body was coming to an end then my message would be this:\n\nI’m not angry. I don’t think you’ve failed. I know better than anybody all that you’ve been through and you know better than anybody all that I’ve been through. I thought you were broken and damaged but now I see you were willing to sacrifice parts of yourself so I could learn what I needed to learn. You have been my greatest teacher. I always thought you were keeping me from my path but I see now that you are my path. I love you and I thank you.\n\n***************************************************************************************************************\n\nIf the thought of spending another evening literally in the dark (thanks loadshedding!) makes you want to give up, how about an alternative?\n\nIf you are ready for change but struggle with imposter syndrome or a very loud inner critic, join me in person from next Monday in Camps Bay for Writing Scared, the beginner’s course.\n\nTo reserve your spot, please click on the website below\n\nhttps://tellyourstorywithwriteon.wordpress.com/courses-and-workshops/writing-scared/\n\nNote there is an exclusive time sensitive discount available for blog subscribers.\n\nPlease note that spaces are limited to 6 participants and bookings are made on a first-come, first-served basis.

We have lost loved ones, jobs, friendships and who we used to be.\n\nSome of us have been lucky enough to find ourselves during this time but may still be struggling with merging our old life and our new life and the expectations of others around us.\n\nIt’s important that we look back at what’s been, let go of the stories that are no longer serving us in order to make space for what’s to come.\n\nIt’s time for a reset. The world is craving all things new and that includes stories.

People are ready to start writing, processing and healing. People are ready for change and the steps necessary to take it.\n\nFor the last few weeks, I’ve been spending time creating a new course and enrollment is now officially open for Writing As Ritual – An Advanced Course.\n\nPlease note that this course is exclusively for students that have previously attended a Write On course.\n\nIf you have not attended a Write On course before, there are other course options available.
