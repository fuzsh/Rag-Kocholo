        "text": "After years of teaching workshops on creative unblocking and self-publishing her exercises, Julia Cameron launched a global phenomenon in 1992 with the publication of The Artist’s Way. The book has since been translated into 40 languages, sold over five million copies and, along with companion workshops, brought creativity into the mainstream conversation— in the arts, in business, and in everyday life. Along the way, Cameron has authored more than 40 books, plays and screenplays, written for Rolling Stone, The Washington Post and The New York Times, and collaborated with legends of television and movies, including Martin Scorsese, who would, for a time, become her partner in life as well. In today’s conversation, we dive into Julia’s early years, her entrée into the writing life, her years-long struggle with addiction and awakening from it, her time in the world of movies, and her fierce commitment to her craft and to helping others find their creative voices and let them out."
