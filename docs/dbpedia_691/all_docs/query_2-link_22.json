        "text": "Martin Scorsese is a creative powerhouse. But his ex-wife was the true creative genius. She created a method to unlock creativity for artists globally. - Julia Cameron was a burnt-out writer in search of another way. Before her method, Hollywood believed it was the “tortured artist” who produced greatness. But, as Julia would show, that’s not true at all. - Julia developed what’s known as The Artist’s Way. Those who followed her method have won Oscars, Tony awards and sold millions of books. “Without her, there would be no Eat, Pray, Love,” says Elizabeth Gilbert. - The Artist’s Way has two foundational practices. These practices have repeatedly produced creativity breakthroughs. Here’s how they work (and how anyone can use them): - PRACTICE 1: MORNING PAGES Every morning (no exceptions), write three pages in a journal. The rules: 1) Never judge the writing - just write 2) Keep the pen moving no matter what Write “I don’t know what to write” repeatedly if you must. - The writing can be BIG, messy, double spaced. It just needs to be done. Once you fill up three journal pages, you’re finished. - WHY THIS WORKS FOR CREATIVITY Morning Pages does 3 things: 1) Creates momentum. You’ve created SOMETHING each day. 2) Gets anxious, judgmental or unproductive thoughts out of the way for creative ideas later. 3) Creates space for unexpected ideas or insights that can be used elsewhere. - PRACTICE 2: WEEKLY DATES WITH YOURSELF The second foundational practice: Take yourself out on a “date” each week as if you were romancing yourself. Julia’s reasoning: “Many of us have squandered our own creative energies by investing disproportionately in the lives, hopes, dreams, and plans of others.” - The rules for these dates: No one else can come It must be at least 90 minutes It should fuel your interests, likes, and desires These should fill you up with creative energy. - WHY THIS WORKS FOR CREATIVITY 1) You’re filling yourself up with experiences connected to your authentic interests. 2) You get out of your routine. Monotony gets broken. 3) You have unexpected connections and encounters combined with the space to reflect. - Solo dates can be uncomfortable at first, but you become more connected with your authentic interests. Art needs playful inflow to sustain. Solo dates prioritize and protect that play for you, the artist. This is more important than ever. - The Artist’s Way exercises are designed to “discover, recover and protect” your inner artist. For anyone working on creative output, Julia’s methods are worth a try. If you have other methods, what works for your creativity?"
