        "text": "I felt quite nostalgic reading my younger-self words on the back. Full of the joy of travelling the world and being in a place close to paradise. I was happy. Although at that time, I wasn’t an artist, I was blown away by the level of creativity and the artisan way of life everywhere you looked. I was captivated. I bought a lot of creative things to send home, some of which I still have.\n\nIn my card, I said… “it looked a beautiful life and I sure would like to go back one day”. Little did I know that it would take me almost 3 decades to be head back.\n\nAnd heading back I am… with Ivy Newport next year.\n\nWe have a beautiful week planned filled with creativity, adventuring and touring the area, staying in exquisite accommodation with chef prepared meals, daily. I can’t wait to head back with new artistic and creative eyes with beauty everywhere the eye can see and how I will be incorporating this into my work. Blue and cyanotype blue has been making an appearance in my work and I’m excited to keep playing and exploring this beautiful added element this year.\n\nOnce again, I hope you will join us in this special part of the world for this next adventure.\n\nI have been finding time #inmystudio and I am for sure, a little rusty. It has been hard at times but mostly I am happy to be back here on a more full time basis. As usual, I am trying to focus on finishing works, because I have a bunch of incomplete works piling up and I have been sneaking in some new pieces too. I know it’s very naughty of me but I can’t help it... I just love it so much. Also when new ideas come up, I feel they need to be responded to. I know this season needs to be one of discipline and I am feeling ready for that.\n\nThis weekend I worked on this incredible soul. Her stance is breathtaking and I am always a little amazed at how many layers of paint these pieces need and take and it’s a game of patience and love. Both of which, were so utterly satisfying. I will share more soon as I finish works as I go, but all in all my creative love tank is filling up.\n\nWhen I have experienced fatigue and burnout… I can take rather long to return to my happy place due to fear and anxiety.\n\nI tend to find myself popping in and out and not committing to serious time or serious work. It’s almost like I trick my creative mind into thinking, it’s not really creating so as not to overwhelm it because if I get overwhelmed I may never return. The fear sends me into freeze or flight mode and both of which I have been doing since my last auction, understandably.\n\nThere is no better way for me to find my way back home than through beautiful non-committal play. Not taking myself or my work too seriously. After all there is that perfect quote from Julia Cameron who says “Serious art is born from serious play.” I do know I live by this quote even when I’m operating from a healthy space #inmystudio. Most of my best creative ideas are born from non-committal play. I heard another brilliant quote last week by Martha Beck…. “The opposite of anxiety is creativity”.\n\nI almost dropped my phone. … It’s not calm!!! It’s creativity!!! Then this means it’s an action word.\n\nI mean, of course, we know this, right…. Us creativities use our creativity to ground ourselves and use it as a way to manage many things. Yet at the the same time our fears and anxieties can keep us from creating too. If we can show up in spite of ourselves, we can get past ourselves and heal our fears and anxieties with beautiful time in the seat and maybe this is through non-committal play.\n\nI apologise if I have shared this concept before in one of my many epiphanies but it feels a new to me right now in this current season and maybe it is just deeper levels of leaning into the way I work and create and finding my own literacy and peace about it.\n\n©JeanneMarieArt 2024\n\nI have this gorgeous BIG works in progress. Yes I am finally facing my BIG untouched canvases. They have been calling for me for some time and I am trying to be courageous and challenge myself to work bigger again. This is how far I got in my first sitting and obviously I have a long road ahead of me but I am ready for the journey. I can’t wait to get back here too.\n\nI haven’t wanted to share too much of my works in progress because I can get a little locked into the finished curated works look and when Courteney was here the other day she asked me why I am not sharing more of all the little things I’ve got on the go. I want to be more mindful about this. I know it appears that I have been MIA the last 8 months but I have been showing up in this odd way of my mind not clocking it. I know it’s a little tricksy and a little naughty but I am here.\n\nPlease let me know if you also do these little quirky little things to get your hours in. That being said, May is here and my film season is officially over. We closed off some things today and last bit tomorrow and I am beside myself excited. I already have my studio schedule worked out of new, beautiful, unafraid time in the seat.\n\nLooking so forward and looking forward to sharing more with you as I go.\n\nMuch love, xxx\n\nThis has sparked so much joy for me. I have been thinking about how come it has. It’s kind of tickled me pink.\n\nI remember seeing a guy in my office building once, ride into the building, got off his bike, folded it up and climbed into the lift with it in hand. I was so taken by this concept and I knew I needed one of those oneday. I am a bit of gadget junkie so this ticked a lot of boxes for me. I am not kidding when I say that was around a decade ago. The idea popped up again recently and I spent a few weeks looking for one. A fold-up bike in these parts are near impossible to find. I did however, find this cutie pie through one of Courteney’s cycle buddies. It’s a popular American brand and I had done a lot of research about this exact brand, I couldn’t believe my luck. It is previously owned but in excellent condition. The best part is it folds right in half and fits into a carry bag and it means it can go everywhere with me. I tested it, it fits perfectly in my boot, even the front seat.\n\nI feel so giddy about it.\n\nI found a dorky helmet to go with it and I have used her to commute a few times to meet friends for coffee and when I hop on, it just makes me so happy. I love the little stand, the bell and the rack on the back. I got some panniers for it this week so I can use the bike now for shopping errands.\n\nIt just feels like happiness. I think it’s one of the nicest things I’ve done for myself in a long while.\n\nI met my friends the other day and they each took her for a spin, they were giddy too and I was so blown away to see how come this was case and that it wasn’t just me. We were all laughing and it was pure delight. I think there is something about this little bike that invites our inner-child to come out and play. Who knew that something so simple could spark so much joy.\n\nI sure am grateful.\n\nIsn’t that accurate, the comment {the costs of living beyond human scale}… It does feel like that, doesn’t it? It really has for me the past 5 years and it doesn’t feel like it’s easing up any time soon.\n\nI tend to always be a little late to all things mainstream. Is it fear… perhaps, but I think on the most part, like in my studio, I don’t outsource any part of my practice because I want to feel authentically connected to everything I put out in the world. From the creation of my work, to how I wrap each parcel, to the cards I write that go with them. I am deeply connected to the experience from start to finish and I am deeply connected to how it will be for you to receive it in the manner in which it is sent.\n\nHowever, without help can we continue living beyond human scale even for small little practices / business like my own. It’s given me much to think about. How can we do this while remaining authentic in our own voice and style. It is for this reason I still haven’t downloaded chat.gpt and the other AI tools to help me with everyday this and that because I am afraid I might lose myself in it. It’s hard to explain, I can’t seem to find the soul in all things AI. I am finding it equally hard to find the soul or myself in middle of algorithms and formulas of the social media platforms too and finding it harder to post these days. I know I am not alone in this. It used to be a joy and a place for us artists to authentically connect and stay connected but now it feels more lonely and isolating. The algorithms have made it impersonal.\n\nIt will always be the connection I am after and it will always be what I am seeking, not only to you but to the self too. I would love to know your thoughts around this and ways you are navigating this new world we find ourselves in.\n\nOpen to hearing and learning more.\n\nAlmost 6 months have passed since my trip to India and looking back I can see the gifts from the challenges. It was a silent yoga retreat and hiking in the Himalayas. It has been one of the most challenging trips I have taken for many reasons. In one of our philosophical teachings, we came across the beautiful word {equanimity} and I realised a lot of the work I have done the past few years has been around this virtue. I can’t thank those enough who have been helping me around this… from the incredible books I have read, podcasts, therapy, yoga, meditation and recently tai chi. I know I still have so much to learn. I have chosen this to be my one word for this year but in all honesty, maybe it will continue to be my life’s word and work.\n\n🙏🏼🍃🐉🧘🏼‍♂️📚🎨✍️\n\n{Equanimity is a state of psychological stability and composure which is undisturbed by the experience of or exposure to emotions, pain, or other phenomena that may cause others to lose the balance of their mind.}\n\nLast week we celebrated this handsome boy’s birthday. He is my constant, my little shadow and where I am, he is. I know we don’t have too much time left together, the days and nights are getting harder. He sleeps all the time now and his comfort and dignity are my priority. His back legs are going and aren’t supporting him so well anymore and he no longer wants to leave the house. Not even to go into our garden anymore and this has been a big shift in his little world. He also won’t come down the back step to greet me anymore when I get home, he waits at the top, throws his head back and howls his hellos. Truly the highlight to every homecoming.\n\nHe’s been one of those dogs who seemed to have a soul connection with all of us at different times. The last few years, he has been my dog, that might have to do with him being vulnerable in his old age and he knows I’m the Momma but whatever it is, it has been such an honor having him as my little sidekick. I do believe dogs are the true empaths of the world and he has the most tender heart. He has been the best dog with the biggest soul and I couldn’t have asked for a better friend. As I prepare my heart for what’s coming next, as much as is what is humanly possible, I do know this, when he departs this world, he will be going with a big part of my heart, in fact, all of ours.\n\nI am popping in to say my first Hello for 2024.\n\nIt was my plan to tiptoe quietly into 2024 and to stay a little inconspicuous for the next while. Unfortunately, 2024 found me creeping across the threshold and grabbed me by my hair and flung me smack bang into the back of a massive Ford Ranger Raptor 4 x 4 truck to remind me to think again about being so sneaky.\n\nTongue in cheek aside, it is definitely not how I wanted to start my year, with my sweet mint-green Fiat 500 being written off. I have no words to express how I feel about this big set back. However, that being said, I have to take the good with the bad - I am alive with no broken bones, I had no passengers with me and no one else was hurt except me and my little love bug of a car. I am bruised, a little battered and every part of my body not happy with me right now but on the most part I am good. My heart feels a bit bruised to be honest, which is to be expected. My airbags deployed and gave me a swift upper cut to the nose, lip and chin and I can’t quite figure out what happened to my chest cavity, but laughing and coughing is no fun. Neither is touching my nose so doing my best not to cry.\n\nThank you to those who have been so kind and for the extra help the past few days, indeed humbling but I am doing my best along with being kind to myself around recovering.\n\nOther than this and that, I am recovering from the burnout I experienced at the end of last year. I went radio silence after my auction as I was really taking the time to look after myself. I push so hard sometimes and I am recognising that I am not always that kind to myself. So many valuable lessons in there for me and I am listening.\n\nMy days are quiet and I am filling my time with some film work, lots of walking, some cold water swimming and lots and lots of yoga. I have been learning the quiet practice of Tai Chi called Swimming Dragon which moves slowly and deeply and it’s really helping me find my grounding again. I have been farming mushrooms at home and it’s felt like pure alchemy. I have also been enjoying all the beautiful blossoming trees and bursts of color everywhere the eye can see. Even though the heat has been awful and energy sapping, I do enjoy the visual beauty of this time of year. Autumn will be here soon enough, which is my preferred season of choice and film season will be over and it means I will be moving back into my studio fulltime. I have been stealing moments to paint but still going slowly but I can see some pieces forming in front of me and it does fill my love tank and have been doing some creative play dates with special friends, all very nurturing… oh and lots of coffee moments.\n\nSo for now, taking life one moment at a time, one breath at a time.\n\nWishing you the most beautiful year ahead and no more sneaking around this year but rather dancing into 2024 with no car and all and thank you for being patient with me to return to this space.\n\nMuch love, always… Jeanne-Marie\n\nTonight is my showing night for The Quirky Show.\n\nI know my work can fall into or under the genre of quirky and a little odd at times and I kind of love that. I guess there is an element of that in my nature too and why it tends to come out in my work. I have learnt to lean into it, work with it and find my own peace with it.\n\nTo find myself part of this show a few times, always feels a little like home to me and I was thrilled to be included in this year’s show especially for my little clay works. My Soul Bearers still continue to show up on my studio desk and still continue to hold me captive all these years in. They are little story tellers in their own right. From the dramatic tilt of their heads, to their knowing eyes and to their expressive hands…. there is always something going on when they gather together.\n\nPieces coming together…\n\nIt is always so special for me to see my works coming together as I start walking towards my auction / sale date. Completing works is sacred ground for me because for many years I had a tendency to start new projects before completing old ones. It became a bit of a habit, a bad one and I have to work very hard with myself to complete tasks. I think this is a very “normal” thing for many artists and Julia Cameron has a section about it in her book, The Artists Way. So I do understand the psychology behind it but it doesn’t make it any less challenging for me to do the work to show up and finish strong. Please let me know if this is also something you struggle with.\n\nI love seeing my completed works along side each other as it encourages me to keep finishing these canvases before I whip out new ones. I do love seeing the story of each body of works unfold together."
