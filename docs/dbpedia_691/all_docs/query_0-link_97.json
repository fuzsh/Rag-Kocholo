        "text": "Hi Friends!\n\nWhat will you remember most about January 2024? Here in the Midwest, January brought us many snowy days, dangerously cold temperatures, gentle rains and several foggy mornings. Our snow has finally melted. This morning, as I walked through our winter garden, I was so happy to see the healthy, green foliage of the ‘cool flowers’ that I direct sowed in the garden last September! My heart was warmed by tiny, green growth at the base of many perennials throughout the garden, too. So, I truly hope for another thick blanket of snow to protect the garden before our next deep freeze. I wonder what surprises the next seven weeks of winter will bring us? ❄️🌨️☀️\n\nHow did you prepare for the beginning of this brand new year? Sharing our traditions and inspiration among friends is one of the special pleasures that I look forward to on the blog every January! I hope that you will share with us today, too…\n\nFor me, the new year always means a brand new, dot-grid, bullet journal overflowing with blank pages… and new possibilities! As the month began, I spent many hours happily creating the new pages in my 2024 Self-Care bullet journal. It always feels like I am truly creating a new beginning!\n\nThis year, I’m celebrating my seventh year of keeping a Self-Care bullet journal. Adding splashes of color and artwork help to keep it interesting! Tucked behind this January ‘dutch door’ page, I wrote a focus statement for the month and a long list of things that I was looking forward to in January.\n\nEach month, I also create pages to track my daily sleep, workouts, and number of steps. There is something very powerful about transferring the data (in ink, in analog form) from the app on my phone and my Fitbit onto the pages of my journal each evening. This really helps to keep me accountable when it comes to important healthy habits! 😉\n\nEach evening, I also add to my Gratitude page (so very important during life’s stressful times), list a daily Creative Step, and what I did to Nurture myself during the day. This nightly bedtime routine only takes a few moments and is such a peaceful way to end each day before drifting off to sleep.\n\nFor the past three years, I have also enjoyed a lovely morning routine at my journaling desk. My Morning Pages journal holds my thoughts on creativity, my worries, and my creative plans for the day. Inspiration gathered during walks in nature and my weekly Artist Date are often a topic in my Morning Pages. Inspired by Julia Cameron’s brand new book, Living the Artist’s Way, this month I have begun writing for guidance in my journal. Perhaps this will also become a daily practice.\n\nMy Morning Pages always end with several creative affirmations (from my Self-Care bullet journal, shown above). Over the past three years, I have discovered just how valuable these strong, positive statements can be! In her groundbreaking book, The Artist’s Way, Julia Cameron reminds us, “Affirmations help achieve a sense of safety and hope.” As I close my journal and watch the sunrise from our kitchen window, I feel more centered and ready to face another busy day. Julia Cameron’s words are so true, “Morning Pages allow you to happen to your day, instead of your day happening to you.”💕 When I must miss a day of Morning Pages, I can definitely feel the difference all day long!\n\nChoosing a ‘word’ to guide me throughout the new year is one of the most powerful ways that I welcome each new year! Every Autumn, I begin listening for “One Little Word” that will help me grow in powerful, new ways in the new year. As I listen with my whole heart, a ‘word’ always finds me! Throughout our home and garden, there are visible reminders to focus on my ‘word’ each day ( on the fridge, on tiny banners, on bookmarks, on garden stones,…).\n\nThis year celebrates my thirteenth “One Little Word.” I can already tell that this will be a very important year of growth as I focus on my new ‘word’ nurture and continue to mindfully practice all twelve previous words! Throughout the year ahead, I look forward to sharing inspiring books, new artwork, and lot of new learning, as I focus on nurturing myself… and the flowers and herbs in my garden, that fill my heart with so much JOY.\n\n🍃🌸🍃🌸🍃🌸🍃\n\nI learned something new today… and I thought you might enjoy this video about the tradition of Candlemas Day, too. 😊\n\nHeartfelt thanks for visiting today!\n\nHope you will share…\n\n🌸 something that you enjoyed during the month of January\n\n🌸 a January tradition that you love\n\n🌸 your ‘word’ or goal for 2024 (We will all cheer you on!)\n\nShine brightly sweet friends,\n\n🩷 Dawn\n\nHi Friends!\n\nHappy Autumn! (Happy Spring!) I hope you are feeling well and are safe from all of the wild weather as the seasons change. Our weather suddenly changed from hot and humid to delightfully cool just in time for the equinox!\n\nMy Midwest cottage garden is flourishing again after several rainy days. The perennials are showing off their white, yellow, pink, and purple blossoms. The herbs seem to have doubled in size overnight!\n\nFor the past week, however, I have only been able to hobble through the garden a few, short times. I fractured a bone in my left foot and will be spending the coming weeks wearing an orthopedic shoe while the broken bone heals. My foot definitely lets me know whenever I have taken a few too many steps! Ouch!😢\n\nTime in the garden has always filled me with creative inspiration while healing my heart and soul. No wonder that the garden is my favorite place to be! Nature’s colors, patterns, and shapes inspire my use of inks, papers, stamps, dies, watercolors, and more…\n\nBunnies are always welcome to nibble the clover, Creeping Charlie, and wild violets from our ‘meadow’ lawn. Recently, a few bunnies have been visiting my little Paper Garden studio downstairs, too.\n\nThe pollinators have been so busy in the garden all Summer long. They have been making an appearance on my handmade cards recently, too.\n\nWhat could be sweeter than using a dried ‘Annabelle’ Hydrangea blossom, in place of a bow, on a gift for a dear gardening friend?💕\n\nOur ‘Hidcote’ Lavender in bloom inspired me to add Lavender stems to handmade cards. I even tucked a few paper stems inside each card!\n\nDo you wear garden gloves? I always wear them while I play in the garden and somehow, I still get muddy hands.😉\n\nI’m really looking forward to harvesting herbs in the coming weeks. I’m going to experiment with an easy, very clever way to dry a few of the herbs. (I’ll report back soon.😊) Herbal inspiration is already on its way to my Paper Garden studio!\n\nJust the other day, as I hobbled past our ‘Autumn Blaze’ Red Maple tree, I spotted the first red leaf nestled in the grass. Very soon, there will be watercolored leaves in my sketchbook and miniature twig wreaths created with ink and paper in the studio. I’m also dreaming of tiny, paper, patchwork quilts! So cozy!\n\nLast week, I began my fourth consecutive Creative Cluster book study for The Artist’s Way, by Julia Cameron. Over the next twelve weeks, our large group of artists from all disciplines will continue to grow as we travel along our creative paths. It feels like such a blessing to nurture our creativity in community with so many talented artists seeking joy!\n\nYou might enjoy the Artists for Joy podcast, with Merideth Hite Estevez, our very talented facilitator/coach/musician/writer/friend! (You can find it wherever you listen to podcasts. Always inspiring!)\n\n🌻Thank you so much for visiting today!\n\nWhat excites you most with the change of season?\n\n🌻Hope you will share with all of us in the Comments!\n\nPerennially yours,\n\n💗 Dawn\n\nHi Friends!\n\nIt has been quiet here for much too long. I have really missed you! 💕How are you? I hope you are warm, safe, and healthy in your little corner of the world. We are well here and taking extra-good care of one another. Everything seems to require so much more careful planning these days, doesn’t it? I really miss the good old days of spontaneity, traveling, and gathering with groups of friends in person.\n\nLast year, I felt so very fortunate to connect with a truly wonderful community of artists through ArtistsForJoy.org and the Lumina Arts Incubator. Oh my, it felt amazing!! Artists of all kinds gathered, via Zoom, on Tuesday evenings to share a powerful, encouraging journey together. This international group included musicians, writers, photographers, potters, performance artists, painters, glass artists, songwriters, poets, quilters, mixed media artists, card makers (like me!), and so many more. Our 13-week Creative Cluster welcomed aspiring artists as well as professional artists. Everyone was so supportive and understanding as we all traveled along our interesting creative paths.\n\nIn recent years, I had slowly felt my creative well running dry. Creativity has always been an important part of my life and I knew that it was time to ‘fill the well’ so that my creativity could flow joyously again!\n\nThe key to my creative recovery was already sitting right on my bookshelf… just waiting to be read! Published thirty years ago, Julia Cameron’s groundbreaking book on creativity, The Artist’s Way, held the inspiration, necessary tools, and tasks I would need to find creative joy again. Although I had attempted to read it on my own, The Artist’s Way is meant to be worked through in community with other artists.\n\nLast February through May, I could ever-so-slowly feel my creative spirit returning as our Creative Cluster met each Tuesday evening to explore our relationships with our own creativity. Reading one chapter of The Artist’s Way each week, writing daily Morning Pages, planning a weekly Artist Date, and trying a few of Julia Cameron’s introspective weekly tasks lightened my heart and taught me so much about my own creativity. 💕\n\nThroughout the Summer months, I continued to write Morning Pages and plan occasional Artist Dates. In the Fall, I joined the next Artists for Joy Creative Cluster for another 13-week exploration of my creativity. Several artists also participated again, along with many, many artists new to our group. Oh my, I made so many more new discoveries about my own creativity as I worked through The Artist’s Way a second time!💕\n\nJulia Cameron writes that Morning Pages are “the trail we explore and the trail home to ourselves.” Julia reminds us that “an Artist Date need not be expensive. The point is that it feels fresh and exciting to you.” Many of my Artist Dates happened right here at home! It felt so healing to play with watercolors in a sketchbook on a sunny, Winter afternoon. These uncertain times have a way of even changing the ways we nourish our creativity.\n\nNow I’m eagerly awaiting the start of the next Artists For Joy\n\nCreative Cluster and…\n\nYOU are invited to join us! 😊\n\nOur new Creative Cluster begins in February. The sessions will be held on Tuesday evenings from 7:00-8:30 EST, via a secure Zoom meeting. This 13-week adventure will run from February 15th through May 10th. There is no cost to participate. Participants are required to purchase their own copy of The Artist’s Way. (I’m using my older edition and it works just fine, too.)\n\nWe begin each Zoom session with a 30-minute group activity. Then we are randomly assigned to Breakout Rooms of 3 or 4 participants for 30 minutes to discuss the weekly topics, tasks, our discoveries, successes, and challenges. Finally, we gather again as a whole group for 30 minutes for a thoughtful creative activity. Each week, I leave with renewed spirit and gratitude for the chance to grow in new ways!💕\n\nOur wonderfully, talented facilitator is Dr. Merideth Hite Estevez (Director of the Lumina Arts Incubator). Merideth is a Juilliard trained professional oboist, a podcaster, a creative coach, and is currently writing her first book on creativity. Most importantly, she would want you to know that she is a busy wife and mother of two delightful young children! Merideth brings joy to our weekly gatherings.\n\nYou can ‘meet’ Merideth on her inspiring podcast, Artists for Joy, available wherever you listen to podcasts. Each episode is definitely worth a listen. I enjoy listening in my little Paper Garden studio while I work.\n\nYou can register for The Artist’s Way Creative Cluster at:\n\nArtistsForJoy.org\n\nNo matter what creative passions fill your heart and soul, you will grow through Julia Cameron’s wisdom and guidance as you explore your creativity in a most welcoming community!\n\n⭐️ Update: Follow the link above if you would like to reserve your space in the Fall Creative Cluster. It will begin in September 2022. Hope you can join us!\n\nI’m happy to answer any questions you might have about the Creative Cluster. I look forward to hearing all about your current creative projects. Do you ever feel ‘stuck’ creatively? What do you do to ‘fill your well’ creatively? Hope you’ll share with us!\n\nThank you so much for stopping to visit today. I’m really happy to begin blogging and visiting my blog friends again. You always inspire me!💕\n\nTake extra-good care,\n\n💗 Dawn\n\nP.S. In the blog archives you will find many posts about my creative journey!☀️\n\nHi friends!\n\nWelcome to all of our new friends, too! ♥ I am delighted that you joined us here in our cozy, little gathering place. I hope that today finds you enjoying small moments of self-care, nurturing yourself with hot tea in your favorite cup, and setting an intention for the days ahead.\n\nCreativity has always been an important part of who I am… and who I am becoming. Just last week, I began a long-awaited, creative journey that truly feels like a river moving through me! It’s introspective, joyful, a bit scary😉, and filled with challenging opportunities to learn and grow. You’re invited to come along, from time to time, as I tiptoe down this new, creative path!\n\nI feel so grateful to be a part of a (virtual) Creative Cluster exploring The Artist’s Way by Julia Cameron. For over twenty-five years, this best-selling book has been helping artists discover and nurture their creativity. We are a large group of creative souls ~ including writers, painters, musicians, poets, dancers, and many more. We work with paints, paper, fibers, wood, music, words, fabric, etc. For the next twelve weeks, our diverse group of creative souls from across the U.S. and other countries will gather each Tuesday, via Zoom, to explore Creativity as we work through The Artist’s Way course together.\n\nOur wonderful leaders, Merideth and Vanessa, warmly welcomed us all as they skillfully guided us through an introduction to The Artist’s Way. We learned more about the key parts of this guided course in Creativity: weekly reading assignments, daily Morning Pages (three pages of handwritten journaling each morning), planning a weekly Artist Date (an intentional, sacred time to explore our inner artist), and completing some of Julia Cameron’s weekly tasks. We all committed to adding these important activities to our busy lives through mid-May!\n\nBefore long, we were all randomly assigned to ‘breakout rooms’ of three or four “soon-to-become-friends” for the next hour to explore several discussion topics. Within moments, two other artists and I met and discovered that we were kindred spirits! We shared our thoughts, plans, hopes, and dreams so easily. We had such interesting discussions about excellence vs perfection, making time for creativity in our very busy lives, sharing our creativity through blogging and podcasting… and so much more. What a joy to connect with other creative souls as we travel along this path! Our time together flew by so quickly as we shared inspiring books, poets, and podcasts.\n\nAs we gathered together as a whole group again to share our thoughts, it warmed my heart to see the faces of so many talented creatives in our new, artistic community! Soon it was time for each one of us to make our very own Creativity Contract, inspired by Julia Cameron. We made it official with a contract signing ceremony and a group photo! 🙂 The next day, I used a bit of Washi tape to attach my Creativity Contract to my Morning Pages journal.\n\nFour years ago, I participated in a lovely, international book club to work through another very inspiring book by Julia Cameron, It’s Never Too Late to Begin Again (an Artist’s Way Program for Retirees and Other Creative Souls). The tools we used to explore our creativity included Morning Pages, Artist Dates, Solo Walks in nature, and prompts for Memoir Writing. I was so blessed to meet my cherished friend, Vicky, in that book club. We continue to encourage one another as we travel along our creative paths. The distance between Illinois and New Zealand seems so tiny for kindred spirits! Blog posts about that Artist’s Way experience are: here, here, here, and here\n\nIt feels so nurturing to begin each day at my journaling desk writing Morning Pages again. I can already feel my creative inspiration ever-so-slowly returning. I’m really looking forward to planning Artist Dates each week! 🙂 They will just feel very different to me during the pandemic when so many public places are closed and we are staying at home. However, it will be a unique opportunity to s-t-r-e-t-c-h our creativity in many, new directions!\n\nJulia Cameron cautions that this twelve-week path to creative recovery or discovery will raise strong emotional peaks and valleys, including joy, skepticism, giddiness, grief, resistance, and hope. Over the next three months, I’m hopeful that I will grow more resilient and confident as I develop the skills to make and execute my creative plans and dreams. From time to time, I look forward to sharing my progress with The Artist’s Way here on the blog. Our positive, encouraging, gathering place for kindred spirits seems like a cozy, nurturing space to share my new, creative journey! ♥\n\nIf you are visiting from our Creative Cluster, I’m so happy that you stopped to visit! 🙂 Be sure to introduce yourself in the comments. We’d love to ‘meet’ you! ♥ You will find my introduction on the About page of the blog!\n\nWhat creative projects are you planning or enjoying this week?\n\nBe well! ♥ Stay healthy!\n\nHeartfelt hugs,\n\n♡ Dawn\n\nSave\n\nHi Friends!\n\nAs the winter days and weeks pass, I have been on the most wonderful, heartwarming journey! This path has led me to lovely places of inspiration, time in nature, quiet hours of thinking and journaling, and most importantly, creative time in my little Paper Garden studio downstairs. Matters of the heart… most certainly!\n\nAll year long, I am focusing on nourishing my creative heart and soul. It feels great… and has yielded happy discoveries that warm my heart and assure me that this journey is a truly important one! One of my ‘guides’ on this journey is the inspiring book, It’s Never Too Late to Begin Again (An Artist’s Way Program for Retirees and Other Creative Souls), by Julia Cameron. Enjoy this post from January to see how this journey began.\n\nSeveral times a week, I now begin my days by writing Morning Pages. It has become a quiet time of discovery, connections, and enthusiastic planning for my creative hours in the studio. One of my favorite discoveries has been the creative ‘ribbon’ that has curled throughout my entire life! From the ages of 8, 18, 28 and into my Renaissance (the ‘R’ word that I use for my retirement), my love for lettering, playing with inks and watercolors, photography, making cards, writing letters, and collecting quotes has always had a special place in my heart. So many sweet memories… I thought about my childhood journals. I remembered my early years as a teacher, with no money for art supplies, when I would heat emboss sentiments for cards over my toaster (not recommended!). I recalled having the entire kitchen floor of my apartment covered with handpainted green flourishes drying as I created Christmas cards. I smiled as I thought about all of the famous quotations, lettered with pen and nib and black ink on parchment, that decorated the long staircase up to my apartment. (They were my homework assignments from years of Calligraphy classes in my 20s ~ perfect for decorating on a budget!) I can still hear my friends saying, “You can get a college education just climbing the stairs to Dawn’s apartment.” Yes, truly… matters of the heart!\n\nSo, it was a joy during the past few weeks to be able to nourish my creative heart by attending two lettering workshops, a cardmaking workshop, and two Saturday Papercrafting Crop days with my crafty ‘tribe.’ I have spent so many mornings enjoying glorious time in the studio… feeling fresh and inspired!\n\nWeekly Artist’s Dates have become one of my favorite parts of The Artist’s Way program. Taking the time to nourish my creative spirit makes even familiar, favorite places seem new again! While walking through beautiful Orchid Greenhouses I thought about the color combinations on the blossoms.\n\nRather than shopping, I wandered through my favorite store, Crate&Barrel, with a whole new purpose. I looked at patterns, textures, and colors for inspiration.\n\nThe textures, patterns, and colors on upholstery fabric and duvet covers caught my attention. Paisley patterns danced in my head for days.\n\nMatters of the heart…\n\nIt was time to create some Paisley patterns of my own, using paper and ink!\n\nA rare warm, sunny January afternoon inspired an Artist’s Date at the Morton Arboretum. As I strolled along the beautiful ‘Conifer Path’ I was immersed in the heady evergreen scents. Nature’s scents are what I miss the most in the middle of winter. I noticed all of the shades of green and the forms of the needle-filled branches.\n\nNow I look forward to creating some evergreen branches of my own using watercolors\n\nand perhaps adding a hand lettered quotation.\n\nThese are matters of the heart… that nourish my creative soul!\n\nLast week, my Artist’s Date was a quiet morning spent in a wonderful, independent bookstore, Prairie Path Books. I could instantly feel that I was among friendly, interesting, kindred spirits there! They were curious to hear about my journey through The Artist’s Way program. In fact, they have even hosted Artist’s Way gatherings there in the past. So, they completely understood that I wasn’t shopping, but there to learn and discover instead. I spent time reading the opening passages of several beautiful memoirs. The words of each author filled my heart with new inspiration.\n\nMatters of the heart… I have given so much thought to each exciting ‘tool’ in It’s Never to Late to Begin Again over the past few weeks: Morning Pages, Artist’s Dates, Solo Walks, and Writing Memoir. Each one is so valuable and each takes time. Since my goal this year is to nourish my creative heart with creative time in my little studio, I will be tweaking The Artist’s Way plan going forward. There must also be family time, time for workouts, time for home and garden projects, tea with friends, reading, scrapbooking, blogging, and travels.\n\nSo, I have decided to s-t-r-e-t-c-h this 12-week journey of discovery into a 12-month journey. Ahhhhhh! I’m really looking forward to working at a much slower place, and having more time to write memoir. It’s something that I have long wanted to begin. Telling our stories and documenting our lives in different ways is yet another ‘ribbon’ that curls throughout my life.\n\nMatters of the heart…\n\nand when my heart speaks, I always listen!\n\n♥♥♥\n\nBe sure to let me know if you are interested in reading more about\n\nthis journey of discovery or possibly joining in!\n\nYou can leave your thoughts below,\n\nor contact me quietly through ‘Say Hello’ on the blog.\n\n♥♥♥\n\nThank you all so much for taking time\n\nto read Petals.Paper.SimpleThymes.\n\nThe kindness, encouraging words, and creativity\n\nof the friends who gather here always inspire me.\n\nHeartfelt thanks for being a part of my life…\n\nand for allowing me to be a part of yours!\n\nHappy ♡ Day!\n\nWarm hugs,\n\n♡ Dawn\n\nSave\n\nSave\n\nSave\n\nHi Friends!\n\nNew beginnings ~ I have always loved them! Whether it is the beginning of a new school year or a brand new calendar year, I am always excited by 365 new opportunities to learn and grow! Sometimes, all of this newness can feel a bit scary or intimidating. Having a thoughtful plan, though, can help new beginnings feel joyful!\n\nFor each of the past five years, I have chosen ‘One Little Word’ to guide me along this path of learning and growing. What a difference it has made for me each year! In late November, I began listening closely to my heart so that I could choose OLW for 2017. Within a few weeks, my word ‘chose’ me. As I was reading, one word jumped right off the page and into my heart! At that very moment, I knew that this was the word to guide me through the new year. I didn’t tell anyone… I just let this word settle into my soul. It felt perfect! As we rang in the New Year, I celebrated my new ‘One Little Word’ 2017! With paper and ink, I created bunting, a card, a bookmark, and a magnet to keep my word visible each day. Now it’s finally time to share… 🙂\n\nFamily and friends have watched and encouraged as I have followed my creative heart during my Renaissance (the ‘R’ word that I use for my Retirement). So, now it’s time to take the next step ~ one that feels so important to me. My ‘One Little Word’ will help me in so many ways…\n\nnourish\n\n1. to sustain with food or nutrient;\n\nsupply with what is necessary for life, health, and growth\n\n2. to cherish, foster, keep alive, etc.\n\n3. to strengthen, build up, or promote\n\nSource: Dictionary.com\n\nThroughout my entire life, I have always been a “Work before play” kind of person. This philosophy served me very well throughout my career. A few years into my Renaissance now, it is time to make a change. It is my intention to prioritize my creative time, downstairs in my Paper Garden studio. Rather than taking care of our home and garden first, often feeling uninspired to be creative later in the day, I am planning to take time in the morning to be creative! Mornings were just made for paper, inks, stamps, paints, brushes, and being messy in my little Paper Garden studio! ♥\n\nFortunately, I have found the most wonderful book to guide me as I nourish my creative side!\n\nThe Artist’s Way, by Julia Cameron, has been inspiring creative souls for twenty-five years. It has been on my reading list for a very long time. As I shopped for the book last Fall, I discovered that the author has a newly published version of The Artist’s Way Program for Retirees and Other Creative Souls, called It’s Never Too Late to Begin Again. It holds so much inspiration to nourish my creative path! I’m already on my way…\n\nIt’s Never Too Late to Begin Again is\n\na step-by-step, twelve-week program with four basic tools:\n\nMorning Pages (daily)\n\nArtist Dates (once a week)\n\nMemoir (weekly, with five tasks)\n\nWalking (twice a week)\n\nSo, I’m excited to share a bit about the ways I have been nourishing my creative side this week…\n\nI’ve always loved writing, so Morning Pages are becoming a part of my early morning routine. Filling three pages, in longhand, with my morning thoughts has been quite pleasurable ~ and powerful! For quite a while, I have been thinking about ways to bring more creative time into my day. While writing my thoughts on January 1st, I actually formulated a real plan. The slow, thoughtful process of writing can be a beneficial way of problem-solving, setting intentions, voicing worries, and putting dreams into action.\n\nSince this whole process feels like a wonderful gift to myself, I am writing Morning Pages in my nice handwriting (just as I do when I write cards to loved ones). Soft music and a cup of tea accompany me as I write. It takes time and my hand feels tired, but so far I am enjoying it immensely! Julia Cameron reminds us not to share our Morning Pages with anyone, so my husband understands that he cannot peek. 🙂\n\nOn Wednesday morning, I planned my very first Artist Date. I bundled in layers to protect me from the -8 F windchill and headed off to a tropical paradise ~ a very large Orchid grower’s greenhouses! It is one of my favorite places to visit each winter. Since we are having such a frigid week here, it was the perfect way to combine my Walking in nature with an Artist Date.\n\nAt first, my focus was on Walking throughout the 150,000 square feet of greenhouses. Julia Cameron encourages two 20-minute walks each week, without a companion, phone, or even a pet. It is a time for quiet thinking and observing.\n\nThen it was time to begin my first Artist Date (and take out my camera). Rather than focusing on the names of each variety of Orchid, my attention was drawn to the colors and patterns in the blossoms and foliage. As I meandered, I found colors just like the inks on my studio desk ~ Spiced Marmalade, Picked Raspberry, Scattered Straw, and Worn Lipstick distress inks, and Blushing Bride, Daffodil Delight, Wild Wasabi, Elegant Eggplant, and Gumball Green dye inks.\n\nThese graceful orchid forms will truly inspire my stamped and watercolor floral designs and layouts.\n\nJulia Cameron encourages each Artist Date to be thoughtfully planned in advance. One must go alone, rather than invite a friend. This intentional, mindful tool benefits our creativity and independence as we visit inspiring places of interest. I have a growing list of places for my weekly Artist Date ~ old favorites and new adventures!\n\nI have always wanted to write Memoir and have even participated in a Memoir workshop in the past. So, I am really looking forward to filling my new Memoir Journal with treasured memories! Each week, Julia Cameron assigns five different writing tasks around a weekly theme. Our first week’s theme for our writing prompts is “A Sense of Wonder.”\n\nEach week, my Memoir writing will focus on a five-year span of my life. In our first week, we are writing about discoveries, cherished memories, and surprising connections from birth through age five. What fun to read through my Baby Book (Thanks, Mom!!) and reminisce with old photo albums! I’m going to love, love, love this walk down memory lane… and can’t wait to see what connections and discoveries are made! It’s just exactly the inspiration I need as I nourish and rekindle my love of scrapbooking! ♥\n\nAdding The Artist’s Way tools to my very busy life will be both challenging and exciting. It will most certainly nourish my creative heart and soul in unknown ways! Since my days are so full already, I plan to stretch out The Artist’s Way a bit longer than twelve weeks. I truly want to savor each weekly theme (Purpose, Joy, Vitality, Connection, Motion, Adventure,…) as I learn and grow on my creative path this year. I will be enjoying mornings in my Paper Garden studio, too! ♥♥\n\n⚙⚙⚙\n\nDo any of The Artist’s Way tools sound interesting to you?\n\nIf any of our kindred spirits would also like to take this creative journey this year,\n\nI would love to connect and quietly share our discoveries! (Just contact me through ‘Say Hello’ on the blog.)\n\nPlease let me know, in the comments, if you would like to read a few blog updates\n\nas I travel along The Artist’s Way!\n\n⚙⚙⚙\n\nThanks so much for being a part of my creative journey!\n\nWarmest hugs!\n\n♡ Dawn\n\nSave\n\nSave\n\nSave\n\nSave\n\nSave\n\nSave"
