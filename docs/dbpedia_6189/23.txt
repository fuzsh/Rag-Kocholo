Something I noticed in my recent travels to the U.S – the Chinatown in Washington D.C. is probably the only one that calls Chinatown as well, ‘China Town’, translated (see above). Most others are translated as ‘Tang Ren Jie’ – meaning street of the ‘Tang’ people.

To those in the know, this has allusions to the fact that the Teochew (the biggest component of the Chinese diaspora, and ‘legendary’ entrepreneurs) were the main instigators behind the development of Chinatowns around the world.

Teochews preferred to be associated with the Tang dynasty, and not the Han, like most other ethnic Chinese – hence the name Tang Ren Jie for Chinatowns – a cultural and social reference to the originators of these satellites of Chinese-ness around the world. Based on the principle that most ethnic Chinese belong to the Han stock, this would mean these Chinatowns should be called Han Ren Jie (Street of the Han People), but they are not. In the case of D.C., it is called neither, but simply ‘China Town’ without any of the indicative cultural referencing.
