        "text": "As we walked into the church for my dad’s funeral, I noticed a stranger among many familiar faces. The oddity of his presence was lost in the craziness of the day and his identity was only later discovered while going through countless cards from loved ones. Among them was a handwritten letter from the stranger. He wrote of a time a decade before that my dad had helped him - a stranger to him. My dad wrote his name and number on a sheet of paper and told him if he ever needed anything to call him. The man attached the piece of paper with my dad’s chicken scratch in the letter. The stranger said he kept it in his wallet all those years as a reminder that there are guardian angels among us on earth - and that he needed to be one for others too.\n\nI kept the letter and hold it as the most precious gift from that day.\n\nYou see, I read it as an opportunity to be a name and number in someone else’s wallet - an opportunity to pay it forward. However, my dad had other plans...\n\nAt the time I had been swimming 365 days a year - only missed a week due to his death. Day in and day out, an elderly woman swam next to me... we never spoke, only exchanging smiles and nods - until the day I returned from his funeral. I hopped in and she asked me to walk a few warm up laps with her. Through the brief conversation she mentioned having visited her granddaughter - her “Ellie-bell”. I almost lost my footing, that was what my dad called me... I told her so, but kept my emotions in check, and we wrapped up the brief conversation and went on to our individual workouts. Later in the locker room she came up and handed me a slip of paper with her name and number on it... I was not in a frame of mind to connect all the dots, but I kept her number.\n\nA month or so later, again at the gym (I never converse with people in the locker room – avoid eye contact), I had a very brief conversation with a woman, a stranger - nothing of importance spoken. Before she left the gym she approached with a handwritten piece of paper with her name and number and told me if I ever needed something to give her a call.\n\nI was starting to see the pattern...\n\nMore than a year had passed, I was traveling home from Chicago on business. My original flight was going to arrive late to MSP, so I talked my way into getting bumped to an earlier flight. I could hardly contain my enthusiasm, the bump meant getting home at 9pm vs 1am. I had a middle seat, a man to my left, a woman to my right, nestled between them I had no complaints. She deep in a book, he with headphones on and his eyes closed. About 15 minutes before landing the woman asked where I was headed. I told her that when we landed I had 2 hours in the car, driving in the snow - so every second spared was a blessing. We briefly commiserated about commuting and how bothersome it was. She said “you don’t know me - I have a husband, grown children and a few grandchildren. I assure you I am a good person and would never do you harm.” Slightly baffled, I told her I did not doubt her. She reached into her work bag and pulled out a pen and her business card. She wrote her cell and home phone on the back and handed it to me. She said, “I live by your work, if you ever need a place to stay - for whatever reason, I am just a phone call away.” I welled up with tears and told her the Good Samaritan story about my dad. I told her how I was not supposed to be on that flight. With tears quietly running down my cheeks - I told her I have lived my life looking for opportunities to be someone’s name in their wallet, and all the while - my dad was placing people in my life who were names in mine! We were both in awe of the serendipity.\n\nI have not received any names in a long time. They came along when I needed them. Restoring my faith. Guardian angels among us on earth…\n\nI often fall short of living up to the expectation I set forth for myself - but am forever mindful of the need to be a name in someone’s wallet – helping people when I can and how I can (regardless of limitations). I am also keenly aware of the people that have been placed in my life to help, guide and steer me - also noting the importance of taking help when it is offered.\n\nNow more than ever – we need to be the name in someone’s wallet, we must strive to be more compassionate, more kind and more generous than ever. We all have it within us."
